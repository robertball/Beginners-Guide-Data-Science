I read alot of reviews on this and just kinda figured either I would really like it or really hate it.  Here's what I did based on other reviews: used 1 tsp minced garlic with the butter, only used about 1 1/3 cups milk and 4 oz. of parmesean (half a container of kraft grated), about 1/4 tsp black pepper and a few grinds of sea salt.  This was the best alfredo I have ever had!!!  I didn't even taste a hint of cream cheese and the sauce turned out smooth and creamy and cheesy!!  I served it with cut up grilled chicken and fettucine.  I LOVED it and so did my boyfriend!! I had some extra sauce so I took it to my friend and she thought it was super delicious!! This will be the only alfredo I make from now on! I hate the jar stuff!  The best advice I can give is to have some patience and the whisk IS A MUST!!  Put the milk in a little at a time and just keep stirring.  Don't use too high of heat and I'm telling you your sauce will turn out perfect!!  Thank you for such a great recipe!

I used light cream cheese and skim milk and it was still excellent.  The recipe states that this makes 4 servings, but I would say that it easily doubled that.  Assuming the 4 servings, using these substitutions drops the calories per serving by 85 and drops the fat by 11.8 grams.  The cholesterol drops by 39 mg. (Well worth doing as it is still excellent.)

I have been making this recipe for several years and still can't get enough of it! It is my husband's favorite dish (in fact, I'm pretty sure this is why he married me!) and he requests it constantly.  The only time I had a problem with separating or a heavy butter flavor was the one time I used real butter instead of margarine.  It still tasted very good, but the flavor was MUCH richer and it was significantly thicker overall.  If you have trouble with the parmesan being too grainy or sticking to the bottom of the pot, try adding it right after mixing in the cream cheese and whisk well.  It will be super thick before adding the milk, but the parmesan will blend better.  If you are worried the 2c milk is too much, try mixing everything together and leaving it on low heat while you boil water for the pasta.  It will thicken alot as it cools too.  Other than that, the only real tweaking that I have done is to always ALWAYS add a healthy dash of oregano.  Other seasonings may come and go, but I find oregano essential for rounding out that Italian flavor. **update** Since a few reviews suggested nutmeg I decided to experiment on what I thought was already perfection and it was definitely worth it!  A good dash or two of nutmeg really adds depth and compliments the oregano too. **more update** For those who say they taste too much cream cheese, make sure you are using the whole 6oz of Parmesan. If you are using enough Parmesan it should become the dominant flavor.

Very good and unlike other reviewers, I did not taste the cream cheese, like in so many other savory dishes that use cream cheese it adds smooth richness to it.  VERY good.  Made alot which I like b/c I was feeding 5 of us.  Served over penne, added chopped fresh tomatoes and basil to mine.  Easy, cheap and comforting, and not super greasy like my other recipe.  I did add a few dashes of nutmeg and parsley, pepper, and more salt to taste once I had tossed it.  Thanks!

BY THE WAY: DON'T rate a recipe if you COMPLETELY change it!!!!  That is extremely unfair and none of us want to hear about how you changed every measurement and dumped a bunch of ingredients in it and thought it was so-so.  Not cool!!

Outstanding. Sublime. Fantastic. I could think of infinite adjectives to describe this sauce becuase its so wonderful. I am generally a traditionalist, but the addition of cream cheese is pure genious. I have never made such a velvety alfredo before.  This is my new standard recipe. I did, however, make the following changes; I used some cream and some milk. I also used more parmesan than called for, and topped it off with some nutmeg and fresh parsley. I have also used this sauce as a base for many other sauces, creamy pesto, garlic and mushroom, creamy basil and tomato, the possibilities are endless.  Thanks very much for a great recipe.

I was highly disappointed and will not make again! With all the rave reviews I was expecting something comparable to the sauces in finer Italian restaurants. To me, this sauce is equal to that of a “fast-food” one.  It tastes too much like a cream cheese sauce, not alfredo. I doctored the sauce up at bit. Try sautéing some garlic, diced ham and fresh peas in a tsp. of butter then add to the sauce before serving over cheese tortellini. The added ingredients made the sauce edible.

This really is a great tasting sauce!!  I was surprised that you can not taste the cream cheese at all; very "authentic" texture & flavor!!  (I was a bit worried at first when my butter and cream cheese did not blend smoothly, and I thought it was because I used margarine and lite cream cheese, but upon adding the first bit of milk it became creamy and the end result was wonderful.)  This is an instant classic at my house.

Very excellent recipe. So much smoother, creamier, and easier than other alfredo recipes I've tried. I did make a few of my own adjustments; I used 1 cup of cream and 1 cup of milk like a few others suggested, I used nutmeg instead of garlic powder and pepper, and used parmesean and romano cheeses. It was so luxurious, and reheats slightly better than some homemade sauces. Great for tossing with pasta or more substantial items like meat and veggies. Definately a keeper!

We made this for dinner last night.  It was awesome!  My daughter likes it better than my old recipe.  Her boyfriend said it tastes like Olive garden.  I served it with noodles and topped with grilled chicken.  The recipe is easy to make.  The key trcik here is to make the sauce on low heat and add the cheese a little at a time. Do not let it start to boil as the butter will seperate.  We will definitely be using this recipe again.  We made no substitutions but made the recipe exactly as written.  Please help me encourage other Allrecipe reviewers to not rate any recipe lower than 5 stars if they do not follow the recipe exactly.  Why do people make changes to recipes and then rate them 3 stars?  Makes no sense to me.

This was ok just going by the recipe. Asked my husband to taste test it, he said tasted more like milk gravy. So I added nutmeg, black pepper, and Italian seasoning. I will admit it is quick, but not really any quicker than making it from a homemade roux.

Outstanding recipe!! I lightened it up a bit by using fat-free half and half and reduced fat cream cheese. Also added steamed broccoli, cauliflower and carrot cuts and some grilled chicken. Everyone raved!

First of all, don't be surprised if your cream cheese doesn't get smooth before adding the milk. Mine stayed quite granular, but smoothed out as soon as I added the milk. I did add a little nutmeg and that perked it up nicely. My husband is a James Beard award-wining restaurant critic and he enjoyed it, but thought the cream cheese was "a little weird." I called him a Poopy Head and informed him I'd be making it a lot, so he'd better just shut up. I think I have a pretty good palate and thought it was yummy-ummy-umptious. I enjoyed it more than the alfredo sauces at most restaurants and it couldn't be easier. This is a keeper, folks. And can be easily modified to fit your personal preferences.

I had a similar recipe years ago that I lost, so I was happy to see this one.  The only difference I remember in mine was using basil in addition to garlic (I rarely use garlic salt or powder).  
For taste this recipe only rates a three (I think true Alfredo Sauce is better) however, I bumped it up a star because it is so quick and easy.  Lets face it I don't always have time to stand in front of the stove and make sauce.  I add sliced cooked chicken breasts to mine and serve over fetticini.  Final thing, I use just milk rather than 1/2 and 1/2.  Maybe that is why mine isn't as creamy?

I was a bit hesitate about making this since it didn't call for a rue, but it came out perfect.  I too used skim milk, low fat cream cheese, and light butter.  I also just used garlic powder instead of actual minched garlic.  It turned out great.    I got about 8 servings out of mine, but it really just depends on how much sauce you want to add and how much pasta you consider a serving.  Anyway, for 8 servings I got 163 calories, 8g of fat, and 0g of fiber (translate into 4points for anyone on Weight Watchers).  Super yummy recipe!  I made some parmesan crusted chicken to go along with it! =]

This recipe is very simple and absolutely delicious! Just some words of wisdom: the sauce thickens as it COOLS not as it gets heated. Please take notice to this as it will save you A LOT of time. If you are heating up your sauce in hopes that it will finally thicken, STOP. Its not going to happen. So turn off the stove, and give yourself a pat on the back; your sauce is perfect, you've done well.

UNBELIEVABLE!  Can we get more stars for this recipe?? :)  I have to admit, I wasn't sure about this recipe and expected a cream cheese taste to it, not only that but I thought 6oz of parm had to be a misprint.  I used butter and sauted 4 cloves of minced garlic before adding the cream cheese.  Once the cream cheese melted and the first cup of milk was in, I added broccoli florets then the parm.  Once melted I added the second cup of milk, lots of fresh pepper, dash of freshly ground nutmeg and grilled chicken cut into slices WOW amazing dish!!  I plan to try this with shrimp next week.

This recipe gets 5 stars for being exactly what it says it is, quick and easy!...I needed an alfredo sauce in a pinch and I didn't have the heavy cream for my usual sauce....tried this one, with tepidation, and was delightfully surprised...I did use fresh garlic and fresh grated parmesan cheese, don't think I would have been quite as pleased if I hadn't...will use this recipe again, when needed, but will stick to my old one, that incorporates white wine, when my fridge is stocked better...Thanks Dawn for a super recipe!

Absolutely great, quick and easy!  Made this twice, exactly as recipe states, but the second time I used Parmigiano-Reggiano in place of domestic parmesan.  Do yourself a favor and do the same.  It’s worth spending the extra money on the Reggiano.  Which ever parmesan cheese you decide to use, DO NOT use the stuff in the green can.  It’s just not good.  If you can, make this a day ahead.  Flavor is superior the next day.

If you want to easily lighten this recipe, just cut out the butter.  I have been making it this way for years.  It does not need the butter at all!

No one liked this one.  For starters, real Alfredo sauce (from Alfredo's in Rome, Italy) does NOT have garlic, let alone garlic powder. Cream cheese also adds a strange, unreal tang. Genuine Alfredo sauce uses only butter, cream and freshly grated Parmesan. Simple and incredibly easy. What's hard to understand is, real Alfredo sauce takes little more time to make than this does. Why not just make the real thing?? This looks like Alfredo, but that's the closest it comes.

Great sauce! I did add about 1.5 c parmesean and extra 1 tsp of minced garlic when the butter was melted then added a garlic salt/parsley blend. I made just a small batch tonight to see how would turn out but going to double and do chicken alfredo tomorrow night!! YUMM!!  :)

I was making a recipe of shrimp, fettucini and peppers and that called for a jar of alfredo sauce; hate that stuff, so I decided to try this recipe; never attempted alfredo sauce before: this was just magnificent!  Very easy, full of flavor, made it just the way it was written; I will use this recipe again & again.  Try it , you'll love it!

Followed the recipe exactly as written.  Learned my lesson - Alfredo sauce is worth the effort.

If you are a connoisseur of Alfredo sauce, this recipe is not for you.

I have to say this is the best homemade Alfredo Sauce I have even had.  It honestly gives Olive Garden (they are well known for having outstanding Chicken Alfredo) a run for their money.  I'm not a fan of the Alfredo Sauce that comes in jars at all.  I made this recipe EXACTLY as is.  No tweaks or substitutions. I understand it's quite fattening BUT sometimes it's ok to just eat without guilt.   Thanks for sharing.  I will be making this dish again and I'm sure VERY soon.  :-)

wow this is so good.  I just made it, and I could not stop "testing" it!  I used the canned parmesan cheese and it still tastes fab so I can only imagine how great it would be w/ fresh parm.  The previous reviewer mentions the cream cheese curdles with the butter--and it does, but once you add milk, it smooths itself right out!  Delish

I have often wondered what the key ingredient to my favorite restaurant alfredo sauce that is always missing in mine and I am fully convinced now that it is the cream cheese. I have never made it this way and am on my way to perfecting the above mentioned! I do prefer fresh garlic, so chopped up two cloves instead of the powder. I also toned down the parmesan flavor a little by adding some mozzerella towards the end. Not a huge parm. fan, so this was powerful, but you can easily play with other Italian cheeses after making it the first time to get an idea what you're dealing with. If you're having problems with it separating, I would have to say you're trying to rush it or have the heat too high. I used the whipped cream cheese because I thought it would melt better and it took a few minutes to come together before I could add the milk, but it did get creamy. It took a good 20 minutes on the right temperature after adding the milk etc. to get it hot and creamy to let the cheese fully melt at a good pace. Not understanding what the complaint with making too much is all about. I poured it over 1 lb. of hot pasta and it stuck perfectly and wasn't too much. I made 2 lbs. after reading the reviews and it was a waste of noodles!

This is beyond awesome! As I learned from some of the reviews, I used 1 1/2 cups milk (2%). I also kinda estimated the cheese, probably putting in a couple of cups of freshly grated grana padano and pecorino romano. I also used 2-3 cloves of minced fresh garlic, along with a few shakes of garlic powder. White pepper might be more appropriate for appearance's sake, but really doesn't matter--I will never again used jarred sauce! I've always made my red sauce from scratch, but never alfredo.  Thank you for a wonderful recipe!

I tried this twice with all the wonderful reviews.  This recipe just doesn't make sense.  Going back to traditional recipe that calls for heavy cream and parm cheese.  In my opinion, this recipe is over-rated!!!!

This recipe has the potential to be really good... however next time I make this I will NOT use 2 cups of milk.  I didn't even use the whole 2 cups and it was very watered down.  I would say 1 cup of milk would do.  Mine never really thickened, but had great flavor.  I used 2 cloves of fresh garlic & fresh parmesan cheese.  I will make this again with grilled chicken!  Make sure to have some rolls handy to mop up the left over sauce!! YUMMY!!

I did not care for this recipe at all. I cannot beleive the rave reviews it received. This is worse than can pasta. True alfredo sauce is actually easier to make and does not compare. Cream cheese is now on my list of things that do not mix with italian cuisine right next to cottage cheese in lasagna...

Great sauce.  I added half milk and half cream for extra richness.  I also used asiago and parmesean cheese.  This sauce adapts well to the substitutions.  The texture is wonderful!!! Definatley add fresh basil if you have it- great!!

So easy! Great taste! Never buying jarred sauce again. I thought it was going to be a buttery mess for a bit with the cream cheese, it just wouldn't incorporate, but once you put the milk in, it all comes together perfectly. I added a little dried basil and parsley for some color and taste. Fresh grated parmesan is a must for flavor! Thanks for the recipe!

This one had me wishing that I could have given it a 6/5! It was so delicious. The consistency was just right, (I did use about half of the liquid called for though--and milk with a 1/4 cup of cream) and it didn't stick to the pan. I served it to my family over farfalle, everyone loved it!

I also added a little oregano and some mushrooms sauted in garlic.  Enjoy!

I usually use the packaged Alfredo sauce. I tried this recipe and loved it. Instead of garlic powder, I cut two gloves of fresh garlic and sauteed with butter. After adding Parmesan cheese, I added white cooking wine to my tasting. No more packaged sauce for me!

This is pretty good stuff. I usually cut back on the cream cheese, milk and parm cheese. This sauce thickens alot as it stands. Heats up wonderfully too, not greasy/buttery like other alfredo sauces. I usually add salt and pepper to taste!! Also good for dipping sauce for garlic bread!!

Okay alfredo sauce.  The measurement for the Parmesan cheese really needs to be in cups rather than weight.  I had a large container of pre-shredded Parmesan, so I had to guess at how much was needed based on adding a little and tasting, then adding more until it tasted "right".  At the end, I added a splash of white wine, which really helped.  I probably won't use this as my regular alfredo sauce recipe, but if I'm desperate for alfredo in a hurry, this will work.

Excellent & very easy sauce.  I chose to use a double boiler instead of direct.  I also added about a cup of shredded low fat mozzarella.  I cooked whole wheat penne pasta & after draining, tossed that with 2 cups of diced leftover roasted chicken and 1 cup of leftover green peas.  The alfredo sauce I poured over the pasta mixture in an oven proof casserole. Baked at 375 for about 20 minutes to just toast the top.  My husband says this is an absolute favorite from now on.

Followed the recipe exactly.  Powdered garlic is too apparent and parmesean cheese dominates the flavor of the sauce. Will not do again.  I'll stick to the jars of alfredo sauce.

My husband and I were very disappointed with this sauce. I followed the recipe and used grated parmesan (kraft parmesan in the plastic round container) which made the sauce very grainy. I will not make this again. If you are looking for a great sauce I usually use the cordon Blu II sauce minus the cordon blu(only white wine, chicken boullion, butter, corn starch, and heavy whipping cream) and it is awesome. I was just looking for something different and I saw all the reveiws for this sauce. Sour, powder like taste was nothing like alfredo sauce should be. I am so confused my the ratings it has received.

Excellent recipe and soooo delicious! I scaled it back to one serving and it made enough for at least 2 people! I used Land O'Lakes Light Butter, a store brand (Publix) light cream cheese, fat free milk and Kraft (green bottle) parm cheese, which made it a little healthier. ;) You HAVE to stir constantly or it won't get thick and creamy. Next time I will try grating fresh parm cheese.  This was one of the best Alfredo sauces I have ever had and I will definitely be making this again soon!

This was delicious... followed the recipe almost exactly (I hardly ever measure things precisely, so maybe I ended up with a little more/less of each ingredient, but I always adjust to taste).  This is the best alfredo sauce I've tried.  Definitely love the addition of cream cheese; that's what made the dish. Will be making this again!

I have made this twice now and it comes out perfect!! I have never been a big fan of Alfredo... maybe because it is so fattening, but by using skim milk and reduced fat cream cheese I don't feel guilty at all! Whole family loves it!!

This was fantastic! My only suggestion is adding the parmesan at the same time as the cream cheese, and leaving it on low while you boil noodles to allow it to thicken. Oregano also adds a really nice touch.

I love this alfredo sauce. I think next time, I will add fresh minced garlic instead of adding the garlic powder. I also used skim milk (it was all I had on hand). Plus, I think the skim milk made the suace a bit less fattening then called for. Using skim milk did not ruin the texture of the sauce at all. It turned out very thick and creamy - just how I like it. I also used low fat cream cheese. I'm very health conscious! I also lowered the heat to low while I cooked my shrimp, broccoli, and spinach to go as a side. I then poured the entire suace into my pot of linguine pasta. Then, I topped it off with my shrimp+veggie mixture. This turned out superb. Protein, fat, and carbs all in one dish. I will make this again, though not any time soon since it is so high in fat.

This is my all-time-favorite "allrecipes" recipe (and I have lots!). I've been making this for a few years now and my husband wouldn't complain if we had it for dinner every night. When I make it, I use a bit less butter (around 1/3 cup), an additional 2 tsp. garlic (or to taste), and a few pinches of nutmeg. I keep adding and tasting, until I can taste a hint of the nutmeg. Try it... it makes all of the difference! It will taste like Olive Garden's... only better. I also usually roast a clove of garlic in the oven and add the roasted cloves to the sauce. If your alfredo is too runny, keep adding parmesan until you get a consistency you like. Goes perfect with bruschetta.

When another Alfredo recipe from this site flopped because my heavy cream turned out to be past its prime (whoops!) I ran back online and grabbed this recipe because I always have cream cheese on hand.  At first I was scared because the butter and cream cheese looked curdled in the pot, but as soon as I added some milk, it smoothed right out.

This sauce was delicious and I will most definitely make this again.  I recommend using fresh garlic instead of the powdered stuff.  And I also found that this worked out perfectly well using low fat cream cheese and 1% milk.  I added a bit of extra Parmesan and a dash of nutmeg to really set the whole thing off.  I served this tossed with linguini and steamed broccoli, and accompanied with homemade focaccia (also from this site).  One last recommendation for folks who say their sauces are grainy- make sure you use freshly grated Parmesan straight from the block.  Don't use the shredded or grated stuff in the tub or the green can.  It is dehydrated and will not melt properly.  That stuff is best used on top of the finished dish or on pizza.  Invest in the real deal and a Microplane grater for this sauce and for most other dishes and you'll never go wrong!  And if you really want to jazz this up, go for Parmigano Reggiano or even Peccorino or Asiago.  That would probably be delicious!

Wow! Creamy, creamy, creamy! I made this twice in one week. The secret really is the cream cheese. A very sensual meal served hot over linguine or fettucine. Pair it with a tangy caesar salad. Be sure not to rush the prep time. Constantly stir and add all of the ingredients alittle at a time. It really makes a difference in the consistency.

Have used this recipe numerous times and still love it.  However, for a lighter and not so "heavy" sauce, I use chicken broth instead of milk or cream.  Has same great flavor, but not as heavy.

This made a good tasting alfredo sauce.  I added some oregano and nutmeg per a few of the reviewers.  My sauce wasn't smooth, and it was a lot thicker than I wanted.  I will try it again using a lower heat setting and adding ingredients in a different order to see if that helps.

I love this recipe.  It's a great sauce as is and you can add things to make it different as you want.  I like using it as a gravy ontop of pork chops with onions and mushrooms added. I can't tell you how often we use this recipe.

I have tried a few different alfredo recipes, and this is my favorite!  I hate cream cheese and never go near it, but all the reviews convinced me to try this recipe...I did not taste any cream cheese! :) I used a pinch more parm cheese than called for, and 2 cloves garlic, minced, in lieu of the garlic powder.  I'll make this again, thanks!

So fast and easy!  I cut down a little butter and milk and added oregano, parsley and a dash of nutmeg.  My cheese butter mixture seemed clumpy but it came together when I added the milk and kept whisking.  Great recipe!

This was really good!  I think like anything with parmesan cheese, the quality of your cheese will really make a difference in the flavor.  I made more sauce than I needed in one night so I saved the rest, and I had a lot of difficulty getting the consistency back when I went to use it again...that's the only downside.

Made this for Olive Garden's Chicken Alfredo Pizza (found in an old Woman's Day magazine) and I had no alfredo sauce.
Very good! I have leftover sauce to make a pasta dish tomorrow! Thanks for a "keeper" of a recipe!

I have to say this recipe was perfect! It is smooth, creamy and cheesy and is easily adaptible w/ low fat ingretients.  I used  "I can't belive it's not butter. Light"- lowfat cream cheese-1% milk and lowfat mozz. cheese. Even w/ reducing the calories that much it was stil super yummy.  I'll use this as a base for many cream sauces from now on!

SO Easy and SO Yummy!  Used FF cream cheese (there's enough fat in the butter!) and extra parmesan.  It thickens up quite a bit AFTER cooking, I had to thin mine out w/milk (I let it sit to cool and it thickened a LOT).  Both my girls (ages 2 & 4) wanted seconds!

This dish is good steaming hot. It's not the best Alfredo sauce out there, but it didn't claim to be either. I loved how quick and easy it was. I had all the ingredients around the house already but didn't have enough fresh grated Parmesan cheese as I would've liked. I used fresh garlic and fresh chopped green onion and cilantro. I also added pre-cooked shrimp to mine. It tastes great as leftover too! As soon as it was gone my boyfriend requested for me to make it again for our next meal!

I didn't like this recipe at all. It was too cream-cheesy and stiff for my liking. I come from and italian family and this is nowhere near a true alfredo sauce. Others gave this a wonderful rating so I decided to try it since I love cream cheese and I didn't have any heavy cream for the "real thing". I will not make this again.

I am having trouble rating this one....Hubby disliked immensely-too much garlic.  I, on the other hand, didn't mind the garlic to go with my prawn and crab linguini with alfredo sauce!!  I guess to each his own, but I will give this an honest review.  I liked it , but Alfredo with that much garlic? A little overwhelming, but would certainly make again! Thanks.  UPDATE: Had the linguini with sauce for leftovers the next day, and it was fantastic!! Next time I will wait a while to serve as the flavours just got better over time! Will ahve again for dinner!! YUMMY!!

Had to work late last night so needed something very quick & easy to fill the gaping hole that is Mr P's tummy. This fit the bill perfectly. Added some cooked leeks to the sauce, served with pan-fried veal escalopes and voila - supper in under 20 minutes. Many thanks for this recipe, it's so very quick to make, so yummy and so versatile it will definitely become a staple Chez Pooter.

Wonderful!  A few tips: for the best flavor, use unsalted butter and a crushed clove of garlic, instead of the powdered variety.  Also, I used skim milk, lower fat cream cheese, and only about 3 oz. parmesan, and it was still superb, but much lower in calories.  

I did not use a non-stick pan, and had no problems.  

After incorporating the milk, I didn't cook it over a few minutes or so.  It was thin, but thickened up nicely as it sat.  I used this sauce instead of tomato sauce when making lasagna, and it was fantastic!

For anyone even thinking about making this recipe...DO IT!!!  It is so amazing!  My husband is the pickiest of picky when it comes to sauces...this is his absolute favorite dish that I make..he would eat it every night if I would let him!  I take boneless chicken breast and coat them with olive oil, italian spices and garlic and grill them on my george foreman until done...then I slice the chicken up and place it on top of the pasta with some roasted red pepper and some chopped fresh basil! YUM...its BETTER than the restaurants! =)

I loved the simpleness of this recipe.  When I made it I added onion powder, and cajun spices as I was making it with cajun chicken.

Thanks for sharing.

This is a mirror to the Olive Garden's Alfredo sauce, add broccoli and chicken strips for a special treat.

YUM!!  I only had chive-n-onion cream cheese in the house, so I used that, and it was great!  Takes a while to thicken, but be patient -- this sauce is fabulous!  Sooo easy, too.  :o)

I made this for my best friend and although she said it was pretty good, she said it was rather tasteless. I suggest adding more spices to anyone who's making the recipe.

This is a really great quick and easy recipe. I made a couple changes: First, I use fresh minced garlic - 1-2 cloves according to taste. I don't like the garlic flavor of some of the powders and many of them tend to have salt in them. Saute the garlic in the hot butter for a few minutes before you add the cream cheese.  

Second, I cut the amount of parmesan to only 3-4 oz because I add white cheddar to the sauce. Usually around 3-4 oz, depending on how thick I want the sauce and how much of the white cheddar flavor I want. You have to wait until the milk is good and hot - it's got to be steaming before you add the white cheddar otherwise it doesn't seem to melt well. And make sure you wisk! The reason I use white cheddar is because I think it cuts down on the parmesan taste and adds more texture to the sauce. It's got almost a gritty texture - but not clumpy. It's hard to explain. I had a white cheddar alfredo sauce at a restaurant once which gave me the idea to try it. 

Finally, I do use the ground black pepper, but like other people I also add just a touch of nutmeg. It doesn't hurt to sprinkle a bit of chopped fresh parsley on each plate right before serving, either!

I have been making an alfredo sauce like this for over a decade. My oldest daughter absolutly loves it and won't eat alfredo from a restaurant anymore. I use a little less milk and add sauteed mushrooms. Sometimes I throw in extra cheese.

Halved the recipe, but made it as stated. Consistency was perfect and the basic flavor was pretty good, although I did feel as though it needed a little something extra - adding more garlic & a few more spices perked it up quite nicely. Overall, a good recipe!

It's obviously not the best alfredo that ever existed but it's quick and easy. I joined just to leave this review. I read through and I tend to read the worst reviews first and I thought I'd still try it out after so many bad reviews. I made VERY little because I didn't want to waste. I melted the butter, whisked in a little cream cheese, added in milk CONSTANTLY WHISKING and it came together just fine. Added in the cheese and spices and it was fine. I kept adding milk until I got the desired consistency and even added a few broccoli florets for flavor. It was fine. I didn't measure a thing and it was FINE. I don't see how so many people are having trouble. The cream cheese is not overpowering and it WILL blend if you whisk constantly. I think a lot of people just can't cook because this was ridiculously simple and tasted just fine.

I gave this 5 stars because it was easy to prepare and my husband, and son both devoured it and said it was yummy.  I subbed 1 tsp minced garlic in place of garlic powder/salt, added a dash of sea salt, and used about 4 oz fresh parm, and 1 1/3 c of 2% milk.

It's... edible. I used fresh garlic, rather than garlic powder and added a little dried minced onion; other than those changes, I followed the recipe exactly. To begin, it tastes nothing like a traditional alfredo sauce. I love cream cheese so I wasn't concerned about some of the reviews that said that flavor was strong -they were right. The cream cheese lends richness but it overpowers the other ingredients and creates an odd taste. I served the sauce with leftover chopped pork and whole wheat pasta. It wasn't bad, hence the two stars, but I wasn't rushing back for seconds. It's a decent basic white cream sauce that's easy to put together but be prepared to make adjustments. It needs something to make the flavors blend. As it is now, it tastes as if something is missing. If I make it again, I'll play with the seasonings. It's a good starting point for a creamy sauce but in no way is it comparable to alfredo.

I love this sauce!  I have made it several times and have doubled and even tripled the batch at times (when I'm making a huge recipe of pasta to take to new friends with babies).  Super easy, and it tastes better than what you'll find in most restaurants (since so many restaurants use a packaged mix for sauces like this nowadays).  I came to the site just now to double check the amounts of all of the ingredients - I'm going to put it in a casserole with pasta that has cooked chicken, bacon, spinach, and mushrooms in it - yum!!

Delicious! I used real butter and it was not too overpowering, nor was the cream cheese flavor. I strongly recommend that you use real parmesan cheese instead of Kraft as well. I also used the full amount of milk. Go slow, whisk as directed, leave it on the stove until you have consistency you desire and you won't be disappointed. I agree with others that this was far more than 4 servings. I have 2 children that had seconds and myself and I still had a 16 ounce jar filled to the rim of left over sauce.

This really is so easy.  I did not taste cream cheese at all, it was just a mild, creamy alfredo.  Texture was wonderful - smooth, rich, clung to fettucine well.  I added steamed broccoli and topped with grilled chicken.  I also added two cloves minced garlic with the butter, in place of the garlic power, and added about a half-teaspoon each of dried basil and oregano.  I might add spinach next time or fresh-cut ribbons of basil.  I used Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, and still would have liked more cheese and garlic flavor.

This was edible, but it wasn't flavorful. My boyfriend turned his plate away after a few bites stating that it was too bland for him and instead had oranges for dinner. I did what I could to salvage mine - a lot more spices and some salt, but it still wasn't that great. I won't be making this again.

This was a fantastic alternative to the horrible alfredo-in-a-jar from the grocery store.  It isn't an authentic alfredo sauce, but is amazingly creamy and delicious.  I added some parsley and it was superb.  This is now the only alfredo sauce I make for my boyfriend and myself.

Easy and tasted great. This will be my standard alfredo sauce from now on. Highly recommended.

after you add the parm. dont be worried if its not very thick, once you take it off the heat it will start to thicken pretty fast.

I am always on a quest to find great new pasta sauce recipes and this one fit the bill.  I added some fresh steamed broccoli and grilled chicken to mine and used fresh minced garlic instead of garlic powder.  Instead of using just shredded Parmesan, I used a mixture of shredded Parmesan, asagio, and mozarella.  Served it over cheese tortellini and it was fabulous.  I will definitely make this again :)

Pretty darn good.  Needs full amount of parmesan.  Mine was a little thin when I used less cream cheese than called for.

WOW! I was amazed at how easy and how great this was! Needless to say this was an absolute hit in my family even with a picky 4 and 7 year old who hate it when mommy makes new things. Even my 7 year old was talking about it the next day and asked if he could have the leftovers for lunch. Definitly as as good as a local italian restaurant that we go to just for their alfredo. I did make a few changes. used reduced fat cream cheese (couldn't tell the diff at all) 2% milk, low fat margrine. added fresh garlic cloves to the margrine while it was melting along with green onions and mushrooms (our fav italian restaurant uses the green onion and mushroom combo and i love it) i was worried that there was not enough sauce but when i added it to the pasta it was plenty. at the very end i added some cooked chicken that i had cooked previously with olive oil and italian seasonings. YUM! will defintly make again!

This was exactly as the name suggests - quick, easy AND delicious. But it only took 1 cup of milk... Anyway, I added some crab meat, my husband added bacon. Both were good. This is a keeper.

I thought this was very impressive for a "quick & easy". If you find you want to jazz it up and offset the cream cheese overtones I suggest you saute an onion and a julienned red pepper in the butter (which you can cut in half since the veggies contribute their moisture)first and then follow the rest of recipe as directed. The result was subtler flavors and pretty darn polished for a quickie! Also if you want to maintain the integrity of this as a 'white' sauce use white pepper :)

Awesome!  I never have heavy cream so this is perfect.It tastes just like a restaurant and not fake like out of the jar. So easy too!! Perfect! Thanks for sharing!! No curdling problems here either this sauce was smooth as silk just soften the cream cheese first!
Update: I have been making this for years and still never a problem...this is an awesome recipe. I just throw a little salt in sometimes veggies and meat but always do the recipe as written. Perfect every time and everyone loves it! I have been making this forever...
Another update: to reheat cover with plastic wrap and it will stay creamy...

Awesome recipe.  Followed the recipe exactly as written.  It was smooth and yummy and just the right consistency.  I think the key is to whisk the entire time and wait until the cream cheese and butter are completely incorporated before slowly adding the milk.

While it had a nice consistency, it tasted mostly like cream cheese even after adding some garlic and nutmeg as suggested by other reviewers. It was faintly alfredo but the cream cheese overpowered it. Maybe a fat free cream cheese would work well because the flavor is less intense. I'll keep looking for that perfect alfredo recipe

This was a very good sauce, I served it with chicken and fettuccini noodles, definetely do not use crumbled parmesan, it makes it too gridy stick with fresh shredded parmesan also too much garlic. But very good

Easy to prepare, delicious, less costly than many other recipes, and if you have a big group, or are a caterer like I am, it cooks up well, and stays on the "line" with no problems.

This Alfredo sauce was a hit at my house.. I did change a couple of things, I added minced garlic instead of garlic powder I dropped the romano cheese and added much more parmesan and added a pinch of nutmeg. I never saw my wife and kids enjoy a meal as much.

This is absolutely fabulous!  I put it on angel hair pasta and then threw some shrimp scampi on top.  It passed my teen son's taste test as well and that's a big accomplishment.  I pass this recipe on to anyone who says "I wish I knew how to make alfredo sauce."  It doesn't get any easier than this!  Thank you for sharing!

This was one of the most amazing recipes that I have used from All Recipes!  I doubled the recipe as I was using it for Portabella Mushroom Raviolis that I recently purchased from a school Market Day event.  I was almost sorry I had purchased them because I never have made a sauce I was totally happy with because they tend to seperate and the jar sauces taste rather gross considering the premium price that stores charge for them!  This sauce really complimented the ravioli perfectly!  As another poster noted, the sauce makes a lot.  I made a mistake of making 2 batches, but given the fact I have 3 teenagers that eat everything in sight, I thought it would be a good idea to double it.  I will not make that mistake again....one would have been plenty!  This sauce tastes better than any of the jarred sauces on the market and best of all it really is easy to make....I highly recommend it!

Needless to say this sauce came out far better than the jar version which I am too accustomed to using!  So when I decided to make the best real thing this is the recipe I chose.  For a first timer I sure looked like a pro!  Tasted absolutely delicious!  Will use again and again.
I did try suggestions:  less garlic powder, add salt, add seasonings, add cheese...  Next time I will use less butter and less milk, took much too much time to thicken.

I love this recipe, very easy.  I used low-fat ingredients where I could, including reduced-fat butter, but of course the parmesan cannot be reduced.  We could probably get by on less parmesan.  Hence, still a rich-tasting recipe with lesser fat!

We loved this sauce.  I used half and half instead of milk and fresh grated Parmesan and it turned out great.  I think its important to adjust the garlic to taste gather than starting out with 2 teaspoons.  If your garlic powder has been on the shelf for a while it won't be as potent. I Served it over bow tie pasta and grilled chicken, but I think it would also be great with any kind of seafood and pasta.

YUM!!!!!!!!!! I love Italian food, and this was absolutely the best alfredo sauce I've had. And it's SO easy to make!!! I added some heavy cream to give it a little more thickness, as well as some frozen peas and chopped ham. YUMMY, I'm telling you!!!

I liked this alfredo sauce but will cut back on the garlic powder next time.  I must have added the milk too quickly because it did not thicken as much as I would have expected.  I will definitely try this recipe again.

I used fat-free cream cheese and reduced calorie margarine, and it still tasted great. I ate this with pasta shells and wished I had made enough for 10 more servings! The only thing was that I think it needed more garlic, I couldn't really taste it in this recipe. Just my tastes, though.

I took the advice of a previous critic, and added sauted mushrooms with fresh garlic and oregano.  The sauce was excellent.  It was quick and easy to prepare, and very tasty.

Easy and delicious!! I found that sautéing a half of a white onion in the butter and adding a splash of dry white wine makes it even better! Sometimes I'll add broccoli or diced roma tomatoes and slices mushrooms. Great recipe as is. Mmm. Enjoy!

This recipe is super easy and very good! I followed the directions but started off by cooking 2 cut up boneless chicken breasts in olive oil seasoned with garlic, salt & pepper, and Italian seasoning. Once the chicken was cooked through I removed it & made the sauce following the directions exactly. Next time I will use a little less milk, but it does thicken upon standing. While the sauce was cooking I shredded the chicken and stirred it back into the sauce. I tossed penne pasta and sauce with chicken together and it was just YUM. This was a hit for my picky family (kids included)!

What a great recipe!  After seeing my cream cheese clump together and whisking like crazy to try and incorporate all the lumpy ingredients, it magically came together and hubby fell in love.  I did halve recipe (which made more than enough for 4 people), used a combo of fresh garlic and powdered, added a dash of Italian seasoning and a pinch of parsley.  I was worried about the amount of milk based on prior recipes, but ended up using just shy of the full cup.  Thanks so much!

Is it authentic? Not really. Is it quick, easy, creamy, rich, and simple to make with ingredients in your fridge?  Totally.  Came out perfectly for a quick thrown together dinner!

YAY! I made this as a sauce for shrimp pasta (I went a little heavy on the garlic because we love it) and it was PERFECT. Much, much better than store bought. Mine turned out thinner than expected, but I'm glad it did. Not too thick and heavy...just creamy and delicious! Safe to say I'm now an alfredo sauce eater!

Super easy!  My family loved this sauce!!!!  I had fettuccine noodles and shrimp and was looking for a quick and easy sauce to make with items I already had at home.  After reading the reviews I  felt we would love it or leave it...  Well, we LOVE it!!!!  I only made minimal changes... I used real garlic instead of garlic powder, and I didn't use all the milk... I slowly added it until my sauce reached   the perfect thickness.  I turned out to be about 1-1/2 cups of milk.

This was quick and easy to make. I made a half batch for a half-pound of fettuccine and it was more than enough sauce to cover the pasta. I used a non-Philadelphia cream cheese and didn't notice any cream cheese taste. I added a minced garlic clove (instead of garlic powder) to the melted butter before adding the cream cheese. The flavor was good, not great, but the texture was a little grainy.

I love the flavor.  Made as per recipe.  However half way eating it got a little too rich.... Thinking it might be a tab too much cream cheese.  Next time I will double it and use only 12 ounce cream cheese and reduce the milk and add sour cream.  Will update after I try that combination....  Thanks so much for sharing!

Raves from the family!  Definitely a keeper.  I halved the recipe, except sauteed 1 teaspoon minced garlic in the 4 tablespoons butter, then whisked in the 4 oz cream cheese to that, then stirred in 2/3 cup 2 % milk in several batches, continuing to whisk frequently, then even less cheese--2 ounces (used shredded parmigiano reggiano from Costco), healthy dose of sea salt and pepper and the several dashes of nutmeg as others suggested.  Then threw in 6 ounces cooked shredded rotisserie chicken breast I got at Harris Teeter, let it all cook together a few minutes while my pasta cooked (6 oz dry), then tossed it all together, adding in 3 cups of steamed broccoli.  This dish all together with the pasta, chicken, sauce and broccoli made 4 hearty servings.  Calories per serving calculated on www.myfitnesspal.com:  412.    Extremely filling and everyone thought the sauce was excellent.

This was very good. I was under the impression it may taste too much like cream cheese, but it didn't. I used light cream cheese and skim milk. I added 1/2 cup heavy cream as I had some open. I added this to only 1 cup milk. This makes more than 4 people could eat. I was happy there was leftovers, but it definitely serves more than 4. I added chopped broccoli the last few minutes it cooked. I subbed garlic salt for half of the garlic powder as I was using unsalted butter.  Glad I did as I feel it might have tasted a little bland otherwise. Definitely will make again.

Best alfredo I've ever made. I couldnt stop eating it. My four year old and hubby loved it. Husband said to be sure and cook it at least biweekly. I could eat this sauce like soup. I followed the recipe exactly.

This recipe was good but took longer than 5mins to cook, that's why I gave 4 stars. I used 2% cream cheese and 1% milk to cut fat and it was still good. I also cut the recipe in half since I'm cooking for 2 and I had enough sauce for 4 servings still.

Quick and easy! I used shredded parmesan cheese instead of grated, and minced (jarred) garlic -- yum! The parmesan cheese was a little goopy at first, but after whisking a little more it incorporated nicely. I added a dash of nutmeg and a dash of italian seasoning and that really made it flavorful. I served this over garden vegetable pasta (12 oz box) and it was way too much sauce. Probably about right for 16-20 oz. of dried pasta instead.

I've made this one before.  It makes a great base sauce for Pesto Alfredo, Chipotle Alfredo, and Green Chile Alfredo, all of which I've made with this sauce!  Thinking about adding bacon next time....delish!

We all thought this was a delicious alfredo sauce. The cream cheese makes it so rich and creamy but you really don't taste it.  I used a little less milk, minced garlic instead of garlic powder, and added about 1/4 tsp of nutmeg right at the end.  I didn't mix any herbs into the actual sauce, but you could definitely sprinkle some FRESH oregano or parsley over the top of your pasta dish...even basil would be quite nice. Awesome!

Absolutely delish.  However, I did add a full cup of Parmesan rather than 6 ounces, and a slash of white wine.  Perfect every time.

this was excellent! I used minced garlic in the butter, 1/2 a pack of cream cheese and a can of milk, because that's what I had on hand! Super Yummy! I will not buy jarred alfredo ever again! Thanks for this easy yummy recipe.

This recipe is wonderful!  I change it up for what I need.  I use cheddar when I want Mac and Cheese (and it doesn't have that flour taste in it).  I have used this sauce for Fettuccine Alfredo, on pizza and for chicken alfredo lasagna.  I have added a few cubes of chicken bouillon also.  I use this in casseroles too. I saute a tbsp or so of fresh garlic with a teaspoon or so of butter in the microwave and then dice up the cream cheese and soften it there. This is so my younger kids can help me with it.  Then the older kids take over and we transfer it to a saucepan and the stove and add 1c milk and 1c water in place of the milk to cut down on the fat.  To us, it tastes the same.  Sometimes, we use 1 1/2 cup milk with 1/2 c water.  Depends on our mood. This recipe is great as written, but also it leaves room to change up for many more uses.  Tomorrow we are trying calzones with this sauce in them, with broccoli and chicken and maybe ham.  Another use is laying refrigerated crescent rolls in a wreath like shape on a cookie sheet.  lay chicken, sauce, small cut up broccoli, and cheese, and a little bit of this sauce.  wrap ends around this to make it look like a wreath. Top with a little cheese.  Bake in oven per instructions on tube. Sometimes, we put a little of this sauce over it when serving. This is a great recipe to make extra of one day and then you have a second different kind of meal for later in the week. We LOVE this recipe!

Quick and Easy. Probably not as great as the real thing,but,had all the ingredients on hand and used light everything to reduce the caloric value. Not a bad sub, and really quick too.

Let me start by saying that I’m not an Alfredo connoisseur or aficionado. I needed an Alfredo sauce for a baked tortellini with asparagus and broccoli recipe that I made up to use the veggies. I read quite a few of the reviews, especially the lower ratings and most helpful. I cut the butter to five tablespoons; used the Parm in the green shaker jar (gasp); and added a sprinkle of oregano and cayenne. We thought the sauce was excellent. Rich and flavorful and no taste of cream cheese at all; consistency was good: thick enough to cling but not too thick, or too runny. I actually think I could use even less butter next time. I did think it was a bit salty but assume that was because of the cheese. I would definitely use this recipe again! It may be quick and easy compared to others, but to heat and whisk the cream cheese, milk, and Parm, a bit at a time, does take some time and attention. Not sure how that compares to Alfredo that’s NOT quick and easy!

Awesome recipe! Reliable and easy. I scaled it down for only one serving (myself), and based off that I used 1/2 TB less butter; however I used the exact amounts of the other ingredients.  I also used fresh garlic instead of powder, added 1/2 slice of provolone cheese, and a dash of nutmeg.  I wouldn't recommend adding the provolone like I did unless you like very hearty alfredo sauce; it was creamy-overload for me, in my opinion.  The smoky provolone coupled with the nutmeg gave the sauce a warm, rich, and savory flavor.  I had this over noodles with a breaded chicken breast and some roasted zucchini and tomatoes on the side.

Used this recipe in a pinch when I was out of the jarred alfredo sauce. Used only 1/4 cup of butter, 2 pressed garlic cloves, and an Italian cheese blend. It turned out great! Added the sauce to penne pasta with chicken, mushrooms, and spinach and topped it off with more shredded cheese. My picky 5 year old and husband loved it. Easy to make and never need to buy jarred sauce again. Thanks!

This was just "OK" for us.  We found it rather thick even after adding milk to it.  It got super thick when we added it to our pasta on our plates.  The taste was okay; it wasn't horrible but I don't think I'd make it again.  At least I tried it but I think I'll stick to another recipe I use normally.

This recipe was great.  I took the advice of some of the other viewers in that I used a little less milk than the original recipe called for and cooked chopped garlic in the melted butter.  I have made traditional Alfredo sauce and I found this recipe to be more forgiving and more tasty than the authentic versions.  Stirring with the wire whisk helps the sauce come out smooth.  Oh, and don't forget the nutmeg!

This was good, my husband loved it so much that he had seconds. However I felt that this was missing something, it tasted a little bland. It probably needed more parmessan cheese or salt, not sure? I used fresh garlic instead of garlic powder which made the sauce smell really good, other that that I used about 1 1/2 cups of milk and added the oregano and nutmeg as suggested. I will make this again. Thanks for sharing.

A very good recipe BUT - I think it should be noted that grated Parmesan is very hard to melt! Make sure that the milk is HOT when added - otherwise, you'll just have strands of Parmesan in your sauce.

This recipe was great, very easy and quite tasty.  I made it as directed but threw in about 1/2 c of Italian blend shredded cheese.  Was a huge hit with my son and even my husband who isn't a big fan of alfredo liked it.

I thought I would regret making it after I put in the cream cheese, but it was surprisingly delicious.  Add used fresh garlic and added a little corn starch and nutmeg.  Will make again!

This sauce is AMAZING! I have looked for years to find an at-home sauce that is worthwhile, and let me tell you, this is IT! I know this is "quick and easy" but if you have the time try this: Roast a bulb of garlic beforehand and incorporate it (whole is fine)-wow. I had one leftover from the other night and after adding it, well, it rocked my and the fiance's socks off! I also used the other suggestions and added fresh garlic to the melted butter instead of powdered. I served this over pasta with oven roasted tomatoes, rosemary and garlic (400 degrees for approx. 1 hour). Delish!  Definitely a keeper!

I followed the recipe exactly using 2 cups of milk. It was way to runny so I had to simmer it for about 45 minutes to steam off some of the liquid. After that the consistency was good thankfully it didn't clump. Next time I will use only half cup or one cup maximum.

I LOVE this sauce!! You cannot taste the cream cheese at all. Some people said that you could, I'm thinking they just have super sensitive taste buds. My husband and I cannot get enough of this stuff. You might have to add some more milk if you have leftovers, it does get a little thick.

WOW!  This was easy, actually reheated unlike other Alfredo sauces and was super easy.  The cream cheese makes it.  Don't use fat-free.  It just didn't taste right.  The texture was off.

This wasn't *nearly* as quick as I expected it to be...especially when it says the sauce thickens rapidly. I made it exactly as the recipe states and it took about 10 minutes to finally thicken. I kept thinking I'd done something wrong. After I tasted it, I stirred in a pinch of nutmeg and wished I'd used real garlic instead of powder. It was easy, but I'm not sure it was any easier than a "regular" alfredo sauce. Thanks for sharing your recipe.

This was very good.  I added more garlic powder, just because it wasn't quite enough for us. I sauteed seasoned chicken tenderloins and served on top.

This is an amazingly good sauce! Only thing is I cut it down to 1 portion and only used 1/4cup of milk instead of the 1/2cup the recipe called for. So easy!

I read several reviews before I decided to make this. I was either going to love it or hate, I decided to risk it.... I am so pleased I did!! I served with steamed brocolli and grilled chicken. I followed the recipe with a few minor modifications. Instead of 2 cups of milk I used 1 cup milk, 1 cup half + half and added a dash of nutmeg. It was very creamy. Like others, I didn't taste the cream cheese and don't know if I would add the expense of using marscapone next time. Be aware this recipe makes A LOT! I have enough for three meals for my family of three. Don't be afraid to try this!!

This recipe is just too easy and comforting not to get 5 stars. It isn't gourmet maybe but it is delicious and my kids all ate it up!! There wasn't a thing left in their bowls. From this mom...that equals 5 stars!  *I did add minced garlic, freeze dried basil, nutmeg and a sprinkle of Italian seasonings.

My wife and I love an Italian restaurant in the Chicagoland area called Maggiano's because their alfredo sauce is amazing.   This recipe yielded similar results.   I used Neufchatel cheese from Aldi, two cloves of garlic, 1 cup of heavy cream (as a substitute for one of the cups of milk), Kraft parmesan, a dash of nutmeg, basil and oregano. Absolultely delicious!!!!!   I made it for my wife because I just felt like cooking for her and she was moaning all the way through the meal.   If anyone has problems with the consistency because of the cheese; I took the advice of another reviewer and added it right after the butter and Neufchatel.  Whisking continously is a must.  I also let the milk and heavy cream come to room temperature and added them little-by-little, whisking all the while. Thank you Dawn Carter for this wonderful recipe and all of you reviewers who make such insightful suggestions!

I created a membership profile just to comment on this. I am not a novice cook, but after this my family may never trust me again. The cream cheese was the dominating flavor and despite following advice from others and using my own experience, the sauce separated. The result, a big pool of butter with a lump floating in the middle. I was able to salvage it into a pizza sauce, but that was only out of a desire to save the ingredients. You are better off making the real thing - it isn't any more difficult.

Very good and easy. However, I like to use fresh pressed garlic instead of garlic powder. I sautee it with the butter. I added shrimp to the sauce at the end and then stirred in some cooked penne pasta. Yummy.

OMG! Easy and delicious recipe! I added a large grated garlic clove to the butter and used low fat cream cheese. I added salt, pepper and a dash of nutmeg. Mmmm. That was perfect!! But then I thought, since I have alot of fresh basil growing that would be a great addition. I was right! I threw about a handful in. Uhhhhh, SO SO GOOD!

This makes a very yummy sauce.  After reading some of the comments, I decided to make a half recipe for my family of four and there was still sauce leftover.  I was also rather intimidated by the fat content so I used skim milk (I would have used lowfat cream cheese, too, but all I had was regular).  The skim milk made it a little runny, so I added in a mix of 1 tbsp cornstarch and 1 tbsp milk and that thickened it up just fine.  I also used fresh crushed garlic instead of powder (although I forgot to cut the garlic in half as I did the recipe so it came out rather strong on the garlic flavor).  I really like that this recipe uses cream cheese to add creaminess and richness instead of a ton of cream and butter.  I also added a dash of nutmeg (which I always use in white sauces) and a dash of italian seasoning.  I added in some shrimp at the very end and served over the spinach noodles from this site.  Very yummy indeed!  I'll definitely make this recipe (or my own variation with little tweaks here and there) on a regular basis.

LOVE IT!  This is something I make weekly at our house, it is in our top 5 favorites for sure!  We have tried lots of variations depending on what we have on hand.  It's really yummy to use fresh garlic and saute it in a little butter before adding everything else, mmmm.  We use skim milk and lower fat cream cheese.  We've tried margarine...yuck.  Fresh parmesian is better than not, but it doesn't make a HUGE difference, there is a difference though.  We love adding chicken and broccoli and serving over noodles.  The broccoli soaks up the sauce like a sponge, it is mouth watering.  Definitely a favorite at our house!  PS: Keep the heat down on the cream cheese and butter until it gets nice and "whippy."  Sometimes I get in a hurry and turn up the heat to high and it gets a little wild.

Hubby says this is a keeper! Followed recipe exactly.....but added some leftover shrimp and parsley for color, last minute! Served over bowtie pasta! Very cheap dinner and great way to stretch shrimp!

I just threw away all my other Alfredo Sauce recipes. Doesn't matter if you use whipping cream, half and half, or whole milk. It tastes virtually the same. I've now made it with all three. I did add the 1/2 tsp nutmeg and a little more salt. But it IS the greatest sauce so far. Throw in some dried parsley and away you go. Use the powdered garlic tastes better. Next time I'll try the cream cheese and chives. Absolutely wonderful.

I must say I was way hesitant to try this (with the cream cheese) and am more than pleasantly pleased!  It was delish!!!  After enough stirring, the cc and butter blend to what looks like melted marshmallows, and then I just added milk to the right consistency.  I upped the meal by turning it into Pasta Primavera -- with the addition of sauteed red bell peppers, mushrooms, onions, garlic, asparagus & shrimp -- a PERFECT Lenten meal.  I'm dying for the leftovers today for lunch!!!!!!!!!

Best White sauce ever! We bought a deli chicken, deboned it and cut in cubes. Added it to the sauce and tossed with pasta. Tasted better than what we have and our favourite Italian Restaurant. And best of all, it is sooooo easy & quick. We also tried it another time by adding fresh mushrooms which was very good but not as good as the deli chicken. Thank you for sharing. This recipe is a keeper!   We tried it again with fried bacon & mushrooms and it was really good as well...have to say that the best is still with roast/deli chicken. It's so good that mom wants the recipe.

This was the easiest alfredo I have ever made. The taste was also good, I didn't have quite 6 oz. of cheese (maybe only 3oz.) but sauce still tasted good!

I decided to try this recipe since it had so many good reviews. It was horrible to say the least. The taste of cream cheese did not go well at all. Never will I make this again. Tried doctoring it up but I was so disgusted I trashed the whole meal.

This was great! I added broccoli and scallops to the sauce. I also used a 3 cheese blend, which I probably wouldn't do again - I would just stick with parmesan. I also used minced garlic instead of the garlic powder. Definitely be using this as my "go to" alfredo sauce from now on.

This is really easy to make and has a good flavor. I've made it about 5 times now, though, and each time I make it, the consistency is different. Many times it is too runny but sometimes I get it just right.

I thought this was really great!! Definitely easy as well. I think next time I'll add some fresh basil. I followed someone else's suggestion of cooking the butter with the minced garlic first. Definitely recommend this.

Really good & easy!  As is, this easily serves about 8.  I used skim milk & light cream cheese.  I think the key is to slowly stir in the milk.  Thanks for sharing!

Yummy Yummy.  I am a very great cook. I cook almost every single day, and I have tried zillions of Alfredo sauce recipes and this one is da best! Tonight I cooked my famous Alfredo Steak and Chicken Casserole using this sauce, and it was to die for.  The only thing different I did was add 1 tsp of sour cream, extra garlic, italian seasonings, and I used "fresh" parmesan instead of the powder crushed kind.  This sauce on top of my Olive Oil grilled chicken breast and thin slices of steak, broccoli, and pasta made for an excellent dinner.  I will be making this sauce again without a doubt!

Oh. MY. GOSH!  This recipe is so good that I'm not even done eating it yet, and I had to come review.  This is good.  There is nothing else to say.  This recipe is delicious.  I made the recipe as is, I just changed the order.  I put the garlic powder and the butter in the sauce pan to melt down.  I also added in some oregano and parsley.  I added in the parmesan next, letting it melt into the butter to make a nice cream.  Then added the cream cheese to melt into the above.  I did all this over low heat.  When I started to whisk in the milk, I increased the heat to the medium.  To the people who couldn't get it to thicken - it probably needed more heat.  It came out delicious.  I ate it over angel hair pasta with some precooked turkey meatballs.  So yum that I can't even fully convey.  I so want to eat more, but my waistline won't appreciate it later.

Excellent recipe, I used low fat cream cheese and doubled the recipe,but only used 3 cups milk instead of 4.  I used basil parmesan cheese...turned out a little green but so good! I then tossed it with seafood I boiled in a little old bay then fried with some garlic for a coupld of minutes and linguini. Thanks so much for an amazing sauce!!

The VERDICT is in...this is my absolute favorite recipe on AR (so far)!!! So freaking creamy and delicious!!! I used 1 can of Carnation Milk and about 8 ounces of shredded parmesan cheese. The key is to whisk, whisk, whisk on a medium to low setting before adding the milk and use quality ingredients (this is not the time to skimp). Be sure to add the milk little at a time as the recipe states this will ensure a lump-free sauce. At the end I added some nutmeg as others suggested. Also I added steamed broccoli and sautéed shrimp. My hunny thought this was better than any Italian restaurant and kept saying....ouuu that was soo good when are you making it again!?!

This is the best Alfredo sauce I've ever made/tried! It's very rich and thick, my family loved it! I did make a few adjustments, I added a little dried Parsley, I used 1 1/2 cup of 1% milk and 1/2 half & half. 
You could add some cooked/seasoned chicken to this and that would be really good too!

This was really good. Easy to make and I had no complications making it. I added it to spiral pasta and some Atlantic salmon and it was fantastic. I did change it a little, i used 1 clove of fresh crushed garlic instead of powder and added a tiny pinch of salt. I also found that if you double the recipe and add 1/2 a cup of both cheddar and mozzarella cheese it makes a delish white sauce for lasagna.....YUMMY!

I followed the recipe exactly as written and used fresh grated parmesan. Although it looked great & was very creamy and smooth, it didn't taste great. We just didn't like the flavor. Four of the five in my household didn't like it. Next time I will try a more traditional Alfredo sauce.

Yummy!  I added some nutmeg and tossed the sauce with some mushrooms I sauteed in bacon fat and then added back the bacon into the shrooms.  Then I tossed it all with chewy egg noodles and my husband is now a very happy man.

This wasn't bad alfredo, but even after adding 8 oz. of Parmesan instead of the called-for 6 oz., I could still taste the cream cheese pretty clearly. The rest of the family liked it and couldn't taste the cream cheese.

I am only reviewing this recipe because I actually followed it exactly... Measuring spoons out and all! The taste was very rich, but wonderful. Like something you would eat in a restaurant. I mixed in chicken I had sauteed in olive oil and seasoned with salt, pepper, and garlic powder, and penne pasta. Garlic toast to "sop" up all the sauce at the bottom was essential!! 
The only ONE thing I would say about this recipe.. it is DEFINATELY more than 4 servings!! More like 6 to 8, depending on what you mix in. One full (14.5 oz) box of pasta and 2 chicken breasts were a perfect proportion, and unless you have 4 large, hungry men, it is more than 4 =)
Thanks for this awesome recipe! Now I can make alfredo sauce without it taking all day!

Made this dish for dinner and everyone loved it.  Used fresh garlic and grilled chicken breast to the sauce.   It was delicious!

I'm not sure I would classify this as an "Alfredo", but it sure is YUMMY! The first time I made it, I poured it over a chicken/pasta/spinich/mushroom dish and it was a big hit. But last night, I used it (instead of red sauce) over eggplant parmegian and even my teenaged sons went back for seconds (a FIRST in my house -- the eggplant, NOT the "seconds" :)). I included fresh parsley (dried would be OK, too, as would cilantro) and a shake or two of cayenne pepper. A genuinely WONDERFUL recipe and a REAL keeper!

I love alfredo sauce, but I rarely find one that I really like.  This sauce was amazing.  My husband doesn't care for pasta, and this is one of his new favorites.  I used hamburger with this sauce, on top of macaroni noodles.  I also added more cheese to it.  Wonderful!

Nice and creamy, works best with whole milk or cream, but the best "easy" alfredo sauce I've tried yet.

Excellent recipe. Very tasty and smooth. It has become a staple in our household. I did make some changes to cut the fat down a little. I omitted the butter and instead added 1/4 cup of flour to the milk for thickening and heated it up before adding the cheeses. It comes out just as rich and velvety without the fat from the butter. I also used skim milk and low fat cream cheese. I added fresh garlic instead of powder for more garlic taste. It is a really wonderful sauce that I make once a week at least!

It really doesn't get much easier than this recipe.  I added cooked broccoli for color and substituted a good spoonful of minced garlic for the powder.  I also used heavy cream instead of milk and low-fat cream cheese (-it balances, right? lol).  Is this recipe healty? NO.  Is this recipe tasty, easy and showy? Yes.   A definite keeper.

I didn't have sour cream available, so I tried this recipe. So glad I did!  It is absolutely delicious!  And so easy!!  We could have easily halved this though, for family of 3.  It made a ton.  Had a lot left over, even after lefovers.  Will definitely be making this on a regular basis.

This was better than any Alfredo sauce I have ever had in a restaurant! I made some minor adjustments... I added about 1/4 cup of white wine, and instead of using 2 cups of milk, I used one cup milk, and one cup heavy cream. I also added some basil, oregano, and a couple dashes of crushed red pepper. This recipe was so delicious! Extremely fattening, and EXTREMELY worth it! This will DEFINITELY be my standard Alfredo recipe! YUM YUM!!

THIS SAUCE WAS GREAT!!!! At first I didn't think that the cream cheese would be a good touch. When I started, the texture was also lumpy until I added the milk...then it was great! The second time I made it I used whipped chream cheese and the texture was even better...my boyfriend claims it gives Olive Garden a run for its money! I'll be using this again!

I was amazed at how much this tasted like "the real stuff." I eyeballed the ingredients though, when melting the butter and cream cheese together I didn't bother measureing the milk since most previous reviews said that it thickens fast, and it does. I always use more parmesean and garlic than suggested, heehee, and I used low fat cream cheese, you can't tell the difference. My only real complaint is that it will not heat up and be creamy again, leftovers aren't happening with this sauce, that just means you have an excuse to gobble it all up at once.

This is great. Excellent flavor for a dish so quick and flexible. I can throw in tuna or chicken or shrimp to give it some extra substance. I've even thrown in corn or peas with the meat and served it casserole style. Guests and family always love it!

I wish there was a 3.5 rating here because a three is too low and a four is just too high. I totally agree with "Cynderpoppy" and "Beboc" regarding the cream cheese issue. I tripled this recipe, yet I only used four ounces of the cheese. I'm crazy about cream cheese, but for a serving of four, it would have been a little hard to take. Now that I've seen this recipe, I'll continue to use some C.C., but just enough to help make it thicker and creamier. Thanks Dawn.

This recipe is wonderful.  If you are having problems with the curdling of the cream cheese, try softening it in the microwave.  It will help when whisking.  I added fresh shimp to my sauce over linguini.  Definatly a keeper.

While I really enjoyed this recipe, easy to make, tastes great, I did find that if you plan to add other ingredients, ie, Shrimp, chicken, vegetables, the sauce does "break down" and becomes very watery and will not thicken.  In the future, I will make the sauce, then serve with the meat & vegetables separately to combine all at the table with the noodles.

YUMMY! I have been making this sauce for years. We just love it! I even had one of my hubby's friends ask me to teach his girlfriend how to make this! I sometimes add sun dried tomatoes to this. I usually also add dried parsley for interest if not for taste. Sometimes we toss in cubed, cooked chicken for a main dish. I use 1/3 less fat cream cheese in an attempt to make myself feel better about eating this delicious sauce!

This is a wonderful recipe! You can omit the parmesan cheese if you don't have any, and it is good as well. I have tried it both ways.

Its a good sauce.  Its quick, easy and to the point.  I scaled it for one and it was fine.  I found it needed a lot of pepper.  I kind of thought it was "missing something" but that's just personal taste.   Anyway it isn't grainy if you use fresh parmesan cheese.  Also here are some lump tips.  First, remember to let the cream cheese melt down completely.  Secondly, always use a wire whisk for this.  Third, add the milk slowly and you'll find it comes together nicely.  Just a nice slow drizzle will do.  Also for those with thickening problems I found my sauce to be a little thin too so I let it sit for a minute and it thickened right up.   Four stars for a quick, easy, tastey alfredo sauce!

I really didn't like this recipe very much. It was okay and everyone liked it, but it tasted absolutely NOTHING like alfredo. It tasted too much like parmesan. It didn't have much flavor at all other than that. I will definately NOT make this recipe again. Thanks for putting it on anyway. I can see from the other reviews that many people liked it. I know that people have different tastes, but it doesn't even taste like what it is supposed to be.

I really loved this.  I had my doubts but the sauce turned out great and was an improvement over traditional alfredo sauces because the consistency stayed smooth and creamy even as it cooled.  I did make one change and used one cup of half-and-half and one cup of milk.  The recipe says that it makes four servings but it seems to make at least six.  I'm going to use the left over sauce on some steamed veggies tomorrow for dinner.  This is definately a five star recipe!!

Ehhhhh,... this is good if you don't have heavy cream to make traditional alfredo sauce, but make no mistake you will definetly lose alot in flavor. It is imperitive that you add a nice sized pinch of nutmeg and some pepper if you do not want the bland results mentioned before. Also evaporated milk works well ( my cabinets and refrigerator were almost bare !)

This is a really good, and really easy sauce to make.  I used skim milk and reduced fat cream cheese and the taste was excellent.  The Parmesan did not melt completely.  I might try cooking a bit longer next time.  I recommend that you add 1/8 tsp. of nutmeg.

This was good, but I didn't think it was out of this world like most other reviewers.  I did appreciate how easy it was to make and the fact that I had all the ingredients on hand.  It was a nice, basic, alfredo sauce.  I gave it more flavor with lots of red and black pepper.

I have looked far and wide for a good Alfredo sauce recipe but I need look no farther.  This is the BEST I've ever made, including a recipe I got from an Italian cook!  I too added a dash of nutmeg and usually stir in some salad shrimp.  My whole family just loves it!  Another great feature, is that it reheats beautifully and tastes just as good the next day.  A REAL big winner.  Thanks for sharing!

Wow!  This tastes exactly like the chicken alfredo from Olive Garden!  This was so easy, I had it made in 30 mins.  I used finely minced garlic and I didn't have real parmasan, so I had to use the can stuff (it was a mix of parmasan and romano cheese) and it didn't seem to mix that well, but it tasted great anyhow.  I will use freshly grated parmasan next time.  I also threw in a pack of already prepared grill chicken strips, sauted some onions and bell pepper and threw in frozen brocoli.  Couldn't have been any easier.  Perfect dish for company.  Will make again, thank you!

This recipe was great.  It was definitely "quick and easy".  My husband also really liked it, although my 8 year old wasn't wild about the sauce.  I did make a few changes:  I used real garlic, light garlic cream cheese, 1/2 teaspoon of Italian seasoning and substituted 1 cup of the milk for fat free half and half.  I also added 1 pound of medium shrimp.

I tried this recipe because I didn't have cream. This was wonderful, a real keeper. This will now replace my former recipe. I added 2 Tbs of Basil Pesto, just because I love it in Alfredo sauce.

This sauceis totally awesome, nice and creamy, I did use 1 cup milk and 1 cup half and half like suggested by others.  Quick and easy and delicious. I added a few of my own spices, and sauted some fresh shrimp in butter and lemon garlic pepper  and served all over linguine and it was out of this world.  Thanks for that great recipe!!!!!!!

The recipe was very easy and a very true alfredo.  Was just a tad too much garlic for my liking so I cut it back some and added a little salt and tad more pepper.

This was an excellent recipe! It was surprisingly delicious, quick to make, and was a hit with my entire family. This alfredo sauce is definitely superior to anything that I have ever bought in a store and is comparible to alfredo sauces that I order at restaurants (I put alfredo sauce on nearly everything) The only thing is that it didn't thicken nearly as quickly as I thought that it would.  I put only 1/2 the required milk, but as it sat in the pan it thickened up considerably (it took some time though).  Overall, this was very good!!!

This was very easy sauce to prepare.  It tasted great!  I added it to rotini, ham and peas ..... it was a great meal that my husband and I loved.  The picky daughter loved it and the son who loves everything was not very enthusiastic about his meal.  Just goes to show that you can't please everyone!  Thanks I will use this recipe again.

FANTABULOUS!!!! This is sooo wonderful!! Thank you for sharing! I cut down on fat by using skim milk and light butter. Next time I will try light or fat free cream cheese. I added chopped chives also and fresh garlic. Everyone who loves alfredo has got to try!!

I didn't really like the taste, but once i added garlic powder, tons of salt, pepper, spices, it was okay. i still prefer the traditional method of making white sauce from a roux.

The sauce was really good. I would add some oregano and a little more garlic the next time I cook it though. I think the pasta shells that I got tasted a bit weird, so I wasn't too satisfied with it. The texture of the sauce was smooth and tasted great on its own.

Very good sauce, an instant hit in our house.  My husband would like it a little spicier, but he likes -very- spicy food.  It took quite a lot longer for it to cook than 5 minutes though.

I thought the sauce was a little "blah" to stand on its own.  The second night, I reheated it and served it over pasta topped with grilled salmon and it was outstanding!  Really needs something with it - I think any seafood over pasta would go well with this sauce.

I made this exactly like the recipe said & I thought it needed a little something extra, it was bland for my taste buds.  The next day I topped my serving with  one tablespoon of parmesean regiano cheese blend & it tasted perfect.  Next time I make this recipe will use 6 oz of parmesean regiano cheese blend instead of just plain parmesean.

I added truffle oil, fresh garlic, light cream cheese and non fat milk with some lemon juice and zest. Its super creamy and rich, butt he flavors balabce nicely by the mouth coating, flavor lasting of the garlic and truffle oil, then the lemon cuts through the fat of the cream cheese and it makes for a fresh, palate pleasing dish :) love! Plus i made this on the fly at midnight because the boyfriend needed a lunch for his night shift, hopefully he likes it just as much as me :) thanks

My son really likes this recipe.  It's the only one we make at our house for alfredo.  It freezes well.  To reheat frozen portions, warm in a skillet with a bit of milk and it works really well. We like it better reheated than the first time around.

Awesome recipe, my picky husbands favorite! Parm cheese is difficult to melt so I start the sauce an hour before dinner and let it simmer on low at the end while stirring occasionally so it gets nice and creamy. I also use half & half instead of milk, because if you are going to eat alfredo, you should really eat alfredo. I also double the pepper... This is not the recipe for you if you are on a diet! ;) Serve with pasta, broccoli, and chicken and BOOM, better than Olive Garden!

Followed the recipe pretty closely except substituting Neufchatel cheese for the cream cheese. I also used skim milk which worked perfectly with lower fat and calories! Once it was the right consistency I added peeled shrimp and served atop whole wheat spaghetti. Added a dash of oregano and parsley on top as garnish which next time I'll actually include while simmering. A+++++ a real winner with the whole family!

This is so delicious and super easy, I add bacon crumbles, rotisserie chicken chunks and broccoli.  The whole family loves it, picky eaters included.

Definately a keeper, My family and I enjoyed it. I used freshly minced garlic instead of the powder and added nutmeg as other reviewers suggested.

I think this recipe is a great base for a good sauce. I've made it several times, each time a little different. Sometimes with fresh garlic, sometimes with whipped cream cheese, and sometimes with half and half instead of milk. I recommend adding a bit of salt and a little extra garlic. Overall, great recipe!

I never leave reviews but had to for this one. I followed the recipe exactly and it was insanely good. As it was cooking I was suspicious of it but after all was said and done, amazing.

This is a variation of the Alfredo recipe I found in a light Italian cookbook years ago. 4 stars as is. To make it 5 stars for our family, I saute minced garlic in 1-2 tbs olive oil-not butter. I do use low fat cream cheese and use 2% milk (whatever you have works) and start with one cup. As it thickens, I use white wine to get it to my desired consistency. Then I add a dash or two of nutmeg and a sliver of butter at the end to make it glossy. Use good Parmesan! I have also used a Parmesan/Romano combo.

THIS IS AWESOME!!  Smooth and rich and delicious.  It could be a base for a lot of imagination, but just like this, it is great too.  I hate it when people give a rating based on what they added, or took away.  I like to know how the recipe was...as written.  It is not a fair review otherwise, whether the review is favorable or not.  As written, this recipe is wonderful.

This made a very good, creamy sauce. I added some extra spices: lemon pepper, nutmeg, and italian seasoning. Didn't quite need all the milk... had about 1/2 cup left over. Served over bucatini and broccoli. Yum! Thanks.

I had a garlic flavored cream cheese, so I added that, instead. At first I was upset, because it was watery, but then I let it boil for a while, AND IT WAS BETTER THAN THE STORE BOUGHT KIND!!!! I didn't add pepper, because I'm kind of sensetive to it. I really liked this recipe!

This recipe Is great. I have made it quite a few times it tastes amazing!! There is no negative review from me for sure. I have to say to those who have negative reviews.. you really need to get your taste buds fixed. Not every alfredo sauce is going to taste the same. You just don't know what tastes good. And no it does no taste like milk gravy. This is to JOYCE BTW you most likely made it wrong. As to most of you who have a negative review about it. :) no trying to be rude but its true.

Best, easiest Alfredo I've ever made!  I tried this out a year or more ago now and It gets made frequently.  I have made this for company or just a regular family supper.  My four year old loves it as chicken broccoli alfredo....and So do I.  I always get compliments on this meal.  Delish!

This is absolutely my favorite Alfredo recipe! Admittedly, I was VERY surprised to find that Italian seasoning staples such as oregano, thyme, and tarragon leaves didn't make their way into the recipe. I usually add those and season to taste, along with mushrooms and shrimp sauteed in butter, olive oil, and one clove minced garlic. But, generally, this is a great base. The Parmesan can be overwhelming if it's not really your thing. If it isn't, I would only add the cheese one ounce at a time to your particular tastes. I, however, really enjoy that taste. It's such a wonderful recipe. My family adores it!

Fantastic Alfredo sauce! I do not use quite as much milk because we like it a bit thicker and I used fresh garlic because I had it on hand. Hands down this is the tastiest and easiest Alfredo sauce ever. I'd also like to add that I use this sauce for my chicken, artichoke and cheese pizza...everyone loves it! Thanks for sharing such a great recipe, Dawn.

I followed the recipe but did add nutmeg, oregano and some parsley.  I couldn't believe how easy it was and although not exactly like real Alfredo sauce, it is very good and most people have these ingredients on hand.  Once the milk is added the sauce turns creamy and will not be lumpy.  Use a whisk and keep stirring and adding a little milk at a time until it's the consistency you want.  I served it over some baked chicken pieces and spinach fettuccine.  I did not think the cream cheese overpowered the sauce at all. 
Something I don't understand is the people leaving negative reviews saying this is nothing like real Alfredo sauce.  If you're such a connoisseur why would you even try this recipe in the first place?

When I first made this I accidently put in mozzerella cheese instead of parm cheese....i realized the mistake halfway through making this....and put some parm in there....I liked this mistake because it made it thicker and stuck together better...gave it a nice flavor as well....love this! I make this as much as I can!

My husband hates alfredo, he ate this and said he really liked it! I think the fact that there is no flour in it keeps it from getting too think and gelatinous.  We had ours with baked salmon.

This recipe was super easy and quick...coming from someone who is a novice. Instead of parmesan cheese, I grated swiss-which could be the reason I found the sauce rather bland. Very easy to manipulate with spices though-like a blank canvas!

So yummy!  I used it over ravioli and smoked chicken. My family gobbled it up.  I added a bit of onion powder and salt in addition to the recipe.

Very good,  Used over lobster ravioli and did not overpower the lobster taste. Very mild. I think if I was to put it over plain pasta, I would add more spices though.

I really like the no fussing for this, and the only reason I gave it a 4 star was because I added a little lemon and garlic.  I will definitely make this again, who knows my husband may even try it...and it is much lower in fat. Thanks

I have nothing but good things to say about this recipe. I had always made alfredo from a box becus I didn't know how to make a good sauce. There are so many variations and I am extremely picky - this recipe is WORTH trying out. It is VERY rich, I might add, so I may use half cream cheese and half the Parmesan cheese and try a tbsp or two of flour. I would also love to try this recipe with feta cheese. But if I were to make this recipe for someone trying it for the first time I would def keep everything the same becus when I took the first bite I couldn't put it down. Only downside is possible stomach ache if you eat too fast like I did!

I love this recipe. I did read through the other reviews and did add in the parmesan cheese after I mleted the cream cheese. I also used heavy cream instead of milk. I got lots of compliments. This sauce is excellent!

A great sauce, versatile, flavorful without being overdone. Easy to add a pinch of this or that too, I've made one with sauteed shallots at the start, another with 1/2 the cream cheese and about 1/3 cup of greek yogurt in place. Thanks

I had waited along time to try this..but I finally fixed this for my wife and kids...we love it!! I used margarine instead of butter, and 2% milk, and also used fresh chopped garlic, only 1 and 1/2 cups milk and 5 oz. of parmessian cheese..this was fabulous !!

Very tasty, quick and easy is exactly right. My as well use a jarred sauce, it would be quicker. As for the person who says it gives Olive Garden a run for its money. I’m not sure that’s a compliment!!

At first I freaked out!  I was making a large quantity of this for a buffet but had never made it before(all the recipes at allrecipes I've tried always turn out great!).  I couldn't get the butter and cream cheese to blend.  Finally after the cream cheese was all melted I started adding in the milk  and THEN everything finally combined!  Great receipe, got awesome reviews.  I think I will try to use reduced calorie milk, cream cheese and possible a substitute for the butter to see if I can lighten it up. I also used crushed garlic that I sauted with the butter, gave it a great flavor.

Just made this today.  I loved it!  My son gobbled it up.  We used penne pasta and sauteed chicken and steamed broccali.  My hubby said it was just the right amount of garlic.  For my tastes, I might use 1/2 tsp less garlic next time, but still I'll give this recipe 5 stars.  It was like I was in an Italian resturant!

Easy to make and tastes amazing. I used crushed garlic (instead of garlic powder) and sauteed it in the butter for a couple of mins while the cream cheese was melting..also inexpensive to make. This recipe is a keeper.

AWESOME! just when you think its not going to work it all comes together.  My advice would be to melt the butter then add the cream cheese and let it melt down a little bit before slowly whisking it into the butter.  I cooked cubed chicken breast seasoned with onion powder and fresh garlic. browned the chicken, and steamed some broccoli and everyone assembled their own plate (I love it with broccoli, the boys won't touch the green stuff).  This is good enough to serve guest and super easy. By the way, I use skim milk and its still creamy and delicious. Thanks for sharing!

Quick, easy recipe. The only problem I had was using 2 cups of milk, the sauce turned out a little runny, though I'm typing this right after I made it. I'm seeing that as it cools down it's starting to have much more of an Alfredo consistency. I'm curious to see how the sauce will set in the fridge. Sometimes food is best the 2nd day! This recipe is more than enough for a 1 lb bag of spaghetti. Added a few dashes or oregano and it seemed to really add the "Italian" flavor to it. Awesome recipe! Great for those who have limited time on their hands

Though I subbed light cream cheese, margarine, and 1% milk and put this onto wheat pasta, this was super creamy and indulgent...so good!  Very easy, as well.  I added some parsley, salt and a bit more garlic.  The sauce does thicken/harden fast while eating.  That is my only gripe.  Not a big enough gripe to take away a star, though.  I will make this again.

Excellent basic Alfredo, doctor it up! Try adding some finely chopped fresh basil and Italian parsley and or a dash of nutmeg. Maybe a little sliced fresh mushrooms or some lemon zest to serve over shrimp, how about some crumbled bacon or sun dried tomatoes? The possibilities are endless.

I don't cook.  At all.  Never really have.  But I had leftover chicken and was desperate to find something my picky teenage daughter would eat.  She recently had surgery and all the meds have really been bothering her stomach and decreasing her appetite.  I  used some light cream cheese in the tub I had in the frig, 1/4 cup butter, 1/4 cup margarine, frozen fresh minced garlic cube and skim milk.  Took others' advice and added more pepper and some oregano (didn't have nutmeg, will definitely get some now).  Also took the advice of adding the parmesan (used shredded paremesan in the tub) before the milk.  Also threw some frozen petite broccoli in with my whole wheat fettucini halfway through.  Not only did my daughter eat two plates, so did my 11 year old son and husband.  My son asked me to make it again and my daughter didn't argue with him.  Thanks so much for posting this and inspiring me to cook!

This was pretty good.  It wasn't the best I've had though, and I probably won't make it again.

Made this sauce and poured it over some thin spaghetti noddles and chopped chicken breast and it was delicious. I really didnt expect it to turn out so well, but this sauce was extremely tasty. it was an extra dish for a party and everyone thought it tasted great.

I have always made my Alfredo with cream cheese, so I thought I would try this recipe. I chopped fresh garlic and sauteed it in the butter, I also added some chopped green onion. I also cut the butter by 2 tbsp and did not use fresh Parmesan, bu tused the jarred type and this turned out great. Will be making this again.

WOW!!  I tried this tonight - as the recipe stated... WOW!  Season to taste- that's all I can say.  It's rude to say you "tweaked" the recipe.  As is- season to taste - wowowowoweeee.....  My kid- who is picky- very picky.... Gobbled it up... Preperation time is longer than 5 minutes thoough..  Slow - low heat... cream cheese already at or above room temp...  Big hit!!  So easy!   Thank you Dawn!

This recipe is absolutely delicious the way it is. However I tweaked mine. I use 1 cup heavy whipping cream, and 1 cup 1/2 and 1/2. I use REAL butter not margarine. In addition to the Parmesan Cheese, i also use 4 ounces of Mozzerella. I love CHEESE! I didn't use the pepper. 

Now with this recipe, I made my own person "Zuppa Toscana" Soup from Olive garden. I used half of this recipe for the alfredo sauce, then I poured the other half into my soup which is: 2 quarts of chicken broth and 2 quarts of water that boiled  6 medium sliced potatoes until tender. As the potatoes are boiled, I cooked a full pound of Jimmy Deans Hot Tube Sausage, and drained the grease. Once the potatoes were tender I added the sausage and the alfredo sauce that I made to my chicken broth with potatoes. Let it simmer for about 20 minutes on low, and stirring occasionally so the cheese from the alfredo sauce doesnt scorch in the soup on the bottom. 

Ready to eat with bread sticks! BETTER THAN OLIVE GARDEN's soup or Alfredo Sauce! 

This recipe made two totally great different meals!

Amazingly yummy.  But I'd say there are at LEAST 12 servings.  Unless you are planning on drinking the stuff.  My family used it for 3 meals, so 15 servings and we still had leftovers.  It was great on spagetti squash with chicken!

We used this for a pizza sauce and it was delicious.  Instead of garlic powder we used minced garlic, and lots of it.  Very creamy.

Thank you Dawn for this simple and tasty recipe. By itself with no changes made I give this recipe a solid 4 out of 5. With these easy changes I give it a 5+++! First and foremost do NOT use a wire whisk in your non-stick cookware. Generally this will chip the coating and can then turn your pot into a health hazard. I always use a metal pan on low heat and never have any issues with scorching. I add a handful of fresh minced Italian parsley, minced garlic and basil. I add this to my butter and saute it a bit then add the cream cheese and between 7-8 ounces of Parmesan Romano Cheese and if possible use half cream and half milk. It makes a lot and tastes even better the second day :)

This was amazing!  Simple, quick and very tasty!  It also makes A LOT more than 4 servings.  I reduced the sauce by 1/2 and it's EASILY enough to serve 5 or 6 people!

Made this last night and it was definitely quicker and easier than my usual recipe....and oh so delicious!  I did 'steal' a few ingredients from my old one to spice this one up a bit such as 1/4 cup of olive oil added to 1/4 cup of butter to cut down on some of the fat.  I also used a 1/4 cup of white wine, 1/4 cup of half and half milk and 3/4 cup of whole milk.  Instead of garlic powder I used minced garlic.  Along with the grated Parmesan cheese (yes, in the green can), I used a handful of shredded Kraft Mexican Four Cheese Blend.  Spices/herbs thrown in (just a dash) were ground red pepper, nutmeg, oregano, parsley, and basil.  We didn't taste the cream cheese either.  I know I changed the recipe quite a bit, but I've been making the same Alfredo sauce for a few years now and I know what we like.  Adding these other ingredients to this recipe made it taste like the sauce we have come to love....it was just quicker and easier for me to make.  Thanks for sharing the secret of cream cheese.

Not the classic homemade version, but still very quick and tasty.  I will make this 4 out of 5 times unless something special is happening when I bust out the fresh cream to do it the right way.  Kids don't care, this works just fine for them...  :-)

Very good stuff.  Even my picky kids loved it.  Only problem I had was mine didn't thicken very well despite following the recipe to the letter.  It was still very good and I plan to make it again.  I served sauteed chicken breast over it for protein.

I'm surprised to be telling you we did not like this at all.  We all found it very bland and boring.  Indeed we saved it with the addition of hotsauce. some nutmeg and a lot more pepper.  Even with these additions we didn't bother saving the leftovers so it was a real waste.
I will stick to my family favourite Alfredo which is more work but well worth it as it IS delicious.

Tasty, but incredibly rich and difficult to eat much of it. I'd recommend it for when you're serving pasta as a side, not a main dish. Try adding chicken or shrimp to it. Adding veggies will help it taste less heavy.

YUM! I am a fiend for Alfredo sauce but didn't think it could be so simple to make. This recipe is a dream come true. I would give the flavor 4 stars, but overall a 5 since it's SO easy and closest thing to restaurant style I can get at home.

I make this alfredo sauce ALL the time.  It's quick, easy and delicious!  Plus, the recipe is easy to memorize.  I usually add some red pepper to give it a little kick.  We add chicken and broccoli to the pasta - yum!

I like this recipe, but I totally used it as a base recipe and changed it! Sorry, but we like flavor. I fried about 8 chicken strips in olive oil to golden brown, sauteed 2 large onions, with 3 chopped elephant garlic cloves. I then melted 2 boxes of cream cheese, and added a nice handful of parm cheese, and 1.5 cups of milk and a large can of diced tomatos. I salted and peppered, and added large amounts of chopped fresh flat leaf parsley. I love tomatos with cream cheese, they really love each other, so I sort of turned this recipe into an alopra sauce...

Very, very good.  Especially for the ease of cooking.  Not my holy grail though.  If it seems a little bland to you, add a touch of salt.  That really made the flavor POP for me.  Also, let it sit for a little bit.  That makes the flavor a LOT better.

Delicious and simple. I love recipes that use things most people have on hand. I added some minced garlic as well, but that's the only change I made. The longer it sat, the better it tasted:)

Err...This sauce was amazing.  My husband wanted to lick the pan!  We made a couple of revisions, based upon what we had on hand. I used grated cotija cheese, instead of parmesan.  It is the same consistency, but with a mexican flare.  Could not taste the spice in the sauce.   Also used half and half instead of milk.  I was a bit worried that the butter and cream cheese would not incorporate, but adding the half and half a bit at a time helped to quicken that process. The sauce was very good, but doesn't look as appetizing as I'd like. (It's very "white") Next time, I'll try adding some parsley or some other fresh herb to make it more pleasing to eye.  Sauce thickens nicely after being removed from heat.  Thanks for the recipe!

This sauce was quick, easy and creamy.  I could taste the cream cheese though.  It was not enough to ruin the sauce but it did taste different from alfredo I am used to.  I would use it again when I need quick alfredo but I would love to find a really authentic tasting recipe.

If you keep in mind this is a quick and easy recipe, you will be pleased with the results.  I thought it was a nice white sauce, as did my toddler.  This is not a replacement for the real thing, but does a good job in a pinch!

This was a really good recipe! I made one small change, and that was putting one clove of minced garlic in the sauce instead of garlic powder (I love fresh garlic!).  I also put in the Parmesan cheese after the cream cheese melted like one comment suggested. The sauce tasted cheesy and it was very good. My s.o. really liked the flavor and said ''it didn't taste like garlic!'' He hates canned/jarred Alfredo sauces because they just taste like garlic. 
I thought the butter (i used lactose free margarine) in the sauce was separating but after it cooked for  a bit and i mixed it more it seemed to stay together just fine. It DOES however take MORE than 10 minutes to make, I thought. (but maybe that is because I was cooking everything else at the same time).

I thought this was really good and simple to make
I did have some separating while it sat after cooking but once mixed a bit was ok to toss.  This is my second time and the separating is very small this time.  This does not taste like cream cheese at all once the parmesan is included, just a creamy cheese sauce.

Very smooth and creamy.  I used freshly grated parm cheese and loved the flavor.  I would say that this recipe makes far more than 4 servings.  Probably closer to 8 and I use lots of sauce on my pasta.  Next time I make it I might add a bit of fresh chopped basil to the pasta.  I used fat free half and half and it turned out very creamy and rich.  A real keeper!

I really don't understand the rave reviews for this recipe.  I decided to try it against my better judgment because a lot of people said it didn't taste like cream cheese.  Well it taste very much like cream cheese, which seems obvious given the ingredients.  I won't make this again.

I really enjoyed this recipe! I used Clove of garlic instead of the garlic powder. I also added shrimp & mushrooms & tossed with penne pasta.  Husband & I loved it! It was creamy & delicious! Wouldn't have it any other way! =)
Thank you for the recipe! Cream cheese is excellent idea!

I tend to doubt the quick and easy recipes but this alfredo sauce is delicious! It is a hit every single time I make it.  Very tasteful and way better than those typical out of the jar sauces.  I ran out of parmesan cheese one time while cooking this so I put 2oz parmesan cheese and 4oz mozarella cheese.  This made it cheesier for those cheese fans and was still good!

Anything with butter, cream cheese and garlic has to be terrific!!!  I mixed this with smoked salmon and fettuccine noodles...fantastic!!!  I just won't be eating very much of this at a time due to the high fat content...probably best to save for potlucks.

Delicious and super easy to make! When I made it my family was so impressed, they had no clue how simple it was!! My 9yr old daughter said that it was the best alfredo she had ever had, and she orders alfredo at nearly every italian restaurant we've ever taken her to!

Way too soupy. Half the butter and milk.  Plus add fresh garlic and another 6ounces of good parmesan (stay clear of the pre-grated).

Boo! As I read the reviews, and I read some of the low rated ones, I thought: Well maybe they're just being food snobs about the recipe. But I made this tonight, and it tasted like melted and creamy cream cheese! :( NOT Alfredo sauce at all! I tried to save it with a bit more Parmesan cheese but in the end I got a jar of alfredo sauce out of the pantry. The consistency was fine, but the taste was just not good. It really just didn't work. I'm wondering why this got such a high rating...

Delicious and easy to make healthier! I used fat-free cream cheese, lowfat butter made from yogurt, and added in some fat-free sour cream to make a lower fat cream sauce.  It went wonderfully with chicken and vegetables!

This was absolutely delicious. I prepared as written and it was great The whole family enjoyed it.  I served it with grilled chicken on top as shown in one photo.  Next time I might add a bit more garlic.   I will use this recipe again and again.  Thanks for posting a great dish.

This came to the rescue last night.  I bought a store bought alfredo sauce that was absolutely inedible.  I found this on here and it was perfect! It went great with my butternut squash raviolis.

Yummy!  And definitely super easy, which was the best part.  I'll certainly make it again!  I used skim milk and light cream cheese, and next time I might try dropping some of the butter to lighten things up a bit more, but it was definitely easy and tasty.

Wonderful!  I made the recipe almost to the letter.  I used half & half and real garlic.  It really was delicious.  I had read the reviews and someone said how bland it was.  There was plenty of flavor and so creamy.  I did find that the pasta soaked the sauce up.   Next time I will double the recipe for the 2 lbs of pasta my family eats.

I thought this was really good! I used light cream cheese, and skim milk, and instead of butter used smart balance with omega 3 along with adding a touch of low fat mozzarella cheese, garlic and herb seasoning, two tablespoons of reduced sodium cream of mushroom soup and a dollop of light sour cream to make it a little extra creamy. came out fantastic and my whole family loved it!

This was VERY easy and very good, however I did substitute fat free cream cheese, skim milk, low fat margarine and part skim parmesan cheese.  Even making these substitutions, it was delicious.  Also, I used this as a topping to spiced tilapia.  I recalculated the nutritional values figuring 8 servings b/c I had more then twice left over.  It worked out to 210 Calories and 13.5 grams of fat.

This Alfredo sauce was AMAZING! I made a few changes but I'm sure it would have been perfect without them. I used one pint of heavy whipping cream instead of the milk. I also used white pepper instead of black. This makes a lot of sauce. I absolutely loved it! I will never use another Alfredo sauce EVER!!!! Thanks Dawn this was awesome!

This was quite good, not to mention super easy, and went together quickly.   I made mine early in the afternoon and refrigerated it until reheating.  It reheated beautifully and was just as smooth and creamy as when I first made it.  I do agree with other reviewers that this makes more sauce than needed for four servings of pasta – I’d say you could get at least six servings out of this.  I served this with Marinated Grilled Shrimp, also from this site, which made for a nice pairing.

I thought that this was great for what it's intended to be:  a QUICK and EASY alfredo!  Is it gourmet?  No.  But it is good, quick and easy.  I have to admit to being worried (and a bit skeptical) when I was whisking the butter and cream cheese together.  It was kind of....broken looking, wouldn't incorporate, and I didn't think it would come together in the end.  I kept whisking away though and as I began adding the milk, it did start to come together.  Because I didn't want the sauce to thicken too quickly, I removed it from the heat and then whisked in the parmesan.  I followed the recipe as written and will use this again.  The only addition that I would make would be salt.  Perhaps 1/2 tsp., depending on your tastes?

Is exactly as the title states: quick & easy. It's not the best sauce I've had, but by substituting items for fat free, it becomes a not too bad for you Alfredo sauce.

I've made traditional alfredo sauces in the past, but never will again!  This is absolutely excellent, creamy and tasty.  I did use fresh garlic, that's just a preference.  I warmed some up slowly in a saucepan the next day, and it was still great.  I'll never use another alfredo!  Thanks so much for sharing such an easy and delicious recipe.

Excellent! Never used cream cheese in Alfredo sauce before, but since I had only milk (no cream), I gave it a try. I used fresh crushed garlic instead of powder, so I sauteed it in the butter before adding the cream cheese. I followed another member's suggestion of stirring in the Parmesan cheese before the milk with good results - no lumps or curling. Added a dash of nutmeg - this is such a subtle but  key ingredient in Alfredo sauce.

Great, easy alfredo. We had all of the ingredients so it was a snap. We did use fresh garlic and a pinch of nutmeg. Served over brown rice pasta with mushroom turkey meatballs.

This is 5 stars!  I made this a while back to make a potato pizza w/ alfredo sauce and LOVED it, but forgot to rate it then.  My BF mentioned he wanted some alfredo this week and I remembered this sauce recipe and whipped it up (we had everything for it already) and he was amazed!  You cannot tell it has cream cheese in it at all!  It's as good as any I've had and beats ANY jar sauce BY FAR!  So easy!  I can't say enough about this one!  Thanks for a great recipe!

Followed a combination of reviews: added oregeno and nutmeg. Also used a clove of garlic while the butter was melting. Added salt. I did use the whole 2 cups of skim milk and the full amount of parm and cream cheese.

Too cream cheesy with absolutely no flavor whatsoever. The parmesan and asiago cheese drowned in the cream cheese. I used 2 cloves of garlic and more than 1/2 a bottle of garlic powder, tons of pepper but even that did not make any difference.

Just as the name suggests, this recipe is quick, easy and with a few modifications, one of the healthiest Alfredo sauce recipes I've come across! Used only 2 tbsp of low fat butter, fat free cream cheese and low fat Parmesan. Will definitely revisit this recipe soon!

This recipe was great for me because I didn't have any cream.  I changed it up just a little bit and put minced garlic and sundried tomatoes along with the other ingredients it called for and I added some nutmeg.  This is one of the best Alfredo sauces I have had!

I made a half recipe, which was enough for 3 adults.  I used margarine and less milk than called for (3/4 c for half recipe).  I also used a little more pepper, and added some oregano and nutmeg.

We liked the thickness of the sauce, but we were disappointed with the cream cheese flavor.  Honestly, my husband makes a sauce much better than this one,  but we tried this for something new.  I'm sorry, but I think we'll stick with his.

Despite what several reviewers have said about not being able to taste the cream cheese, it was evident and not authentic alfredo sauce in the opinion of my family. We will not eat this again.

I am not one to experiment or deviate from the recipe. I feel that this alfredo sauce is amazing, delicious, and easy to make. My family loves it just as much as I do. Definately worth making..you will not be disappointed.

I've used this many times now, and everyone loves it in my house (me, husband, 2 small kids).  It's super easy to make and tastes oh so good!   If it looks too lumpy in the early stages, don't worry, once you add the milk, it smooths right out. Yum!

I was in search of an alfredo sauce recipe that incorporated cream cheese and I came across this one.  I must say, hands down, this is the best alfredo sauce I've ever tasted!!  I adjusted the recipe to serve about 15 people and the recipe was definitely quick and easy to follow.  I tossed  rotini in the sauce and the end result was FANTASTIC!!!  Better than I imagined!  I received many compliments.  This is a wonderful recipe and I highly recommend!!

First let me say that with a simple recpie like this out on the web, it's a surprise that most restaurants I get alfredo pasta from are unable to really deliver on the flavor.  This recipe does just that!  It was full of flavor and was so simple to make.  A couple of things I will do differently the next time I make it though: 1) I will probably make it thinner while on the stove (by using more milk for desired consitency).  What I didn't think about was the fact that after I poured it over the pasta and chicken it would continue to thicken quite a bit.  By the end of the dish it was a little thick and dry but the flavor was still there.  #2) I will probably start this fairly later than the pasta and chicken.  This recipe was so easy that it barely took me 10 minutes.  Leave this piece for last when making pasta and/or chicken.  Other than that, it was delicious.  I am happy to say I can make my own homemade alfredo sauce now.  I probably will not order alfredo when I go out to eat anymore because it is rarely ever this delicious.  Another good find on Allrecipes.  Thanks Dawn.

Mine is similar but I use chicken broth and heavy cream in place of the milk. Good for a quick sauce.

Not sure what I did wrong except maybe that I used real grated parmesan, not the stuff in the can. It tasted way too much like melted parmesan cheese.

Excellent!!  Easy to make, and so delicious!  Everyone had seconds and thirds.  We're definitely keeping this recipe!  I did add minced garlic to the melting butter, and also added a few dashes of nutmeg, which I think is a must for alfredo sauce.  Thanks for sharing!

This really was not appetizing. I was surprised that my husband and I felt so strongly about it despite the awesome reviews it received. I rarely ever disagree with the ratings on recipes. This, however, did taste like the alfredo sauce you would find at an italian fast food restaurant, or maybe even in a jar somewhere. It doesn't taste authentic. I was disappointed :(

The recipe was really quick and easy to make.  I made some of the suggested substitutions to reduce the fat (skim milk and reduced fat cream cheese) and the sauce was still very rich.  I mixed it with small shells and a lot of chicken and spinach to balance the creaminess.  I will definitely make this sauce again, probably with fettuccini pasta and broccoli.

I've made this recipe several times. The first time I made this recipe with the exact instructions and found it a little bland for my family's taste. I definately found that adding nutmeg was helpful and a bit more pepper. I increased the garlic and one time used fresh garlic for truly enhanced flavor. Overall, this is a fantastic recipe. I can even put all the ingredients in my Vitamix blender and whip it up until contents are hot and creamy; no stove or microwave needed. Truly a time-saving recipe that can be adjusted to personal tastes quite effortlessly. Bravo for the submission.

YUM!  Recipe followed as-is is wonderful.  Additions of your favorites are great for changing it up a bit.  My husband loves to add jalapeno peppers whereas I prefer a bit of crushed red pepper.

FANTASTIC! Used 1/3 fat cream cheese and reduced fat margarine. Probably the best alfredo sauce I've ever made.

This was a great sauce but, I would have to agree with other reviewers it does not taste like a true alfredo. Add alot of Parm (Fresh) and it helps. Great base for more experimenting!!!

This is a great recipe! my only complaint is that you don't have to use that much cheese but it's just as good anyway. I took mine to lunch and my co-workers were like 'What's that good smell?' when you do something that good,you know you made something worthwhile.

Great quick sauce, I added grated garlic instead of the powder and used 1/2 parmsean cheese and 1/2 Bogart (a cheese my husbands farm makes & sells).  I am going to make sure I always have cream cheese on hand so I can make this on a night when I get home late.

I give it 5 stars because it is a great base recipe, i used fresh minced garlic wich i added right after the butter melted and let it release the aromas, then added the c/chesse and only used about a cup of milk first, added a bit at a time more untill the thiknes i wanted (wich ended up to about 1 1/4 cup) seasoned it with powder chiken bullion(maggy, about a tbsp. kosher salt and pepper)and did not add the parmesan (i used fresh shreded). instead i dished my noodles, pour the sauce over toped it with a sauted fresh mushrooms and baby spinach(fresh)mix and than sprinkled with the shreded chesse. this will make my "easy middle of the week meal" options, everyone liked it a lot.

My husband says this is even better then Olive Garden! You may easily make it lower fat with substitutions; margarine instead of butter, low fat cream cheese, etc.) You may need to add a little more milk, but it is just as good!

Really good, easy to make; a big hit with my family. Maybe a little bland for my personal tastes, but I spiced it up with a little extra pepper.

This is a great recipe for quick Alfredo sauce.  The flavor and texture are really nice!  After trying the recipe as is (because you really can't rate a recipe unless you're rating it as written) I've subbed 1/2 the butter for olive oil, used reduced fat cream cheese and skim milk with equally tasty results.  The key for this sauce is the garlic to avoid it tasting like cream cheese.  The combination is wonderful.  I like to use chopped fresh garlic in this dish, sauteed in the butter/olive oil before adding the rest of the ingredients.  Finish it off with some chopped parsley or basil and the sauce is excellent with grilled chicken and roasted red peppers over pasta!

Yummmmmmmmmmmm! My family's favorite place to eat is Olive Garden, for their Fettucine Alfredo and the Alfredo dipping sauce. We don't need to go there to eat anymore because this sauce tastes just as good! We LOVE it! I probably cut back a smidge on the garlic, and always double the recipe, but it is so easy and fast. Thank you so much for this recipe!

I guess I'm in the minority, but we did not like this at all.
The only change I made was to use fresh garlic instead of powdered.
Not good - won't be making it again.

I thought this recipe was very good.  At first I didn't think it was going to work out right, I couldn't get the butter and cream cheese to blend well.  But, once I started adding the milk it became very smooth.  Next time I may try using fresh garlic instead of garlic powder.  It makes a great dipping sauce for rosemary bread that I also make from this site!

This was weird.  The parmesean would not melt even though I cooked it a long time (~30 minutes).  I used cheese that I had grated myself about an hour before using it so I thought the fresh cheese would be good.  The butter also started to separate from the cream cheese and milk.  Whenever it wasn't being stirred, the butter rose to the top.  I've made better alfredo so I won't try this again.

10 / 14 / 2008: My very first ever meal, made from AR--and it was EXCELLENT!! I tweaked and used heavy cream instead of milk. First time--and I got the Olive Garden recipe right...and became the family hero!!

Same taste second time I finely diced red and green peppers, which worked very well and gave the alfredo a Christmas holiday appearance!!

March 30, 2017: This one still IS my favorite.  Adjust thickness to your liking, between the milk and Parm cheese ( I like a fine mix between powdery Parm and finely shredded Parm ). 

Don't fret if you make it TOO thick: finely dice up some green onions or add generous dash of parsley. Chill till firm--and you got some very tasty Game Day chip dip.

This was so easy and so delicious.  I followed the recipe up to the end when I took half of the Alfredo Sauce and added diced tomatoes and sauce to make a creamy tomato sauce.  This way my son could have his own "white alfredo sauce", and we had our tomato alfredo.  Yummy!!  Thanks so much for this recipe.  It's a keeper.

I make this when we have company over. Very rich and thick and cheesy. My family loves it. I never use the whole 2 cups of milk that it calls for though. I just slowly add it as needed. I think it would be too runny if I used all the milk.

Pretty good!  I used light cream cheese and only 1/4c butter.  I added more pepper, a little dried parsley and a dash of nutmeg.  My dad loved it!  It was much cheaper to make than other recipes we've tried.  Next time I'll try adding some sun-dried tomatoes or roasted bell peppers and mushrooms.

This is the first time that I have made a recipe from allrecipes.com that I didn't like. Unfortunately, my Alfredo sauce came out too oily (I think that 1/2 cup butter is WAY too much), the ingredients never really got together, and too runny! I am so surprised that some reviewers wrote theirs was too thick... mine was like soup! Ok, the taste was not too bad, but the texture was awful. I will try it one more time, with less butter and less milk, but I have to say, I am very disappointed... :(

This was so easy to make. The only thing I did different was I added Pepper    basil and I thickened it by adding 3 TBS flour to 1 cup of milk. (I used 1 cup of half and half and 1 cup of milk)I also sprinkled in a few TBS of fresh shreaded asiago cheese. It was amazing

I don't keep cream on hand at home, so I was excited to find an alfredo recipe that didn't require a trip to the grocery store. The sauce turned out ok; being from Wisconsin, I'd probably add more cheese to thicken it up a bit.

loved it. my fiancee's manager asked me to make her some alfredo and noodles so i added a personal touch here and there and it was good. its even better when you use fresh everything it adds about 5 more min to prep but so worth it and if its not alfredo enough get some pre made sauce and add a smidge for a little more flavor

There was nothing bad tasting about this recipe.  It just wasn't the nice, smooth, good tasting alfredo sauce recipe I was looking for.  I'll try some others.  It was nice to have all the ingredients on hand and in a pinch, I would make this again.  I wouldn't make it for guests, though.  It's not THAT good.

this was a very easy recipe, but it didn't have much flavor and it took a long timw to set. I would suggest putting some sort of seasoning in this recipe.

I originally found this recipe in some church cookbook years ago, and have been making it for my family since then. In some other reviews it was mentioned that the cream cheese mixture is grainy-to solve the problem whisk the butter/cream cheese/milk together as it melts. Doing so will insure that it is creamy. Also, in a pinch, this sauce is easy to make in the microwave-put the cream cheese in a bowl and melt it by itself for a bit. Then add the butter and let all melt together. Before adding the milk, whisk together and continue whisking while adding the milk. To keep it from being too runny, add the milk a little at a time until it is at the consistency you prefer.

Awesome recipe! I love that I always have the prescribed ingredients on hand. I also recently invested in a silicone whisk, so I now make this recipe in a nonstick sautee pan. Thanks! It's perfect!

THE best alfredo sauce I have come across!! I knew with the reviews it had to be good but once we tasted it..it was out of this world. Just be careful because once you start eating it you can't stop & my husband was miserable...only because he made a pig out of himself!! Have made it twice in 10 days!

Ah, cream cheese... I ate a white pizza the other day made by my neighbor's BFF in which she used this sauce. I loved it, so I tried it on a few of my own pizzas. Topped one with Italian sausage crumbles. The other pizza got grilled chicken and blanched broccoli florets. Husband was not crazy about sauce, but he has a cream cheese mental block. I thought it was totally great on the pizzas. The recipe was so easy to make and turned out thick and creamy just like everyone said it would. I used about 2 cups finely shredded Parmigiano Reggiano and it made the sauce more tangy and flavorful. The sauce also needed salt and onion powder, and I didn't use all the milk.

Excellent!! I made this recipe as is and would not change a thing. I made it with real parm cheese that I grated in my food processor, however the cheese was expensive so I might "expereiment" and use the cheese in the can the next time.  I added cubed chicken to the sauce mixture after it had thickened up.  I served the mixture over noodles and broccoli.  Very tasty, will make this again!!!

This was THE BEST alfredo recipe I have ever made!!! My kids and husband thought it was better the any restaurant!  I will definately make it again.  I did add some dried Italian seasoning and about 3 strips of fried bacon, crumbled.  It was so easy to make and didn't have to mess with flour clumping up! Yummmm

I've made this twice now and the second time I discovered what it needed. The first time I tried adding some basil and oregano - that was delicious and beautifully creamy, but it still tasted a little weak. The second time I added that, some extra parmesan, two more teaspoons garlic powder and a teaspoon of cornstarch - and it did the trick. Fabulous.

As is this recipe was fine especially when you're in a hurry... my rating is based upon my family as a whole.  All four of us were indifferent to it.  Wasn't bad, wasn't great, just something to eat because we were starving.

My husband dubs this "my specialty".  My family gets SO excited when I make it.  My favorite way to use it is with Turkey Kielbasa (sliced and lightly sauteed), Broccoli and Penne pasta.  
I have been told it's better than restaraunt alfredo!!  The only thing I changed is that I used Heavy Cream.  Hey, if you are going to do it - do it right!!!!  :)  I also concentrate on making sure that my cream cheese and butter are blended REALLY well before I add anything else.  It almost looks like frosting till I'm done.  Then I add the rest. 
EXCELLENT!!!!

This was AMAZING!! I made a few changes, I sauteed 2 large garlic cloves in the butter and used mostly fresh sheredded parm. cheese and just a little  of the grated kind. I also added a little nutmeg and salt. My husbad couldn't get enough. This is a keeper for sure. The best part is it was ridiculosly easy to make.

This makes me happy! Since I was using the alfredo sauce in another dish, I left out the garlic and spices and added enough 2% milk until it reached the consistancy I desired. It was thick, rich and delicious. My husband, who used to own a restaurant, was really impressed.

I used this alfredo sauce for chicken and brocolli pasta, and WOW!!!.  It was great.  The whole family loved it.  My sister and neice said it tasted at least as good as the dish they order at Ruby Tuesday. My husband also gave rave reviews and my 3-year old cleaned her plate (does not happen very often).  It is a definite keeper for me.

So easy and so versatile!  Follow the other reviews to suit your taste (we love garlic but thought it is too much as listed).  I use reduced-fat cream cheese, 1 % or fat-free milk, and unsalted butter to lighten it up.  I add cheese tortillini or chicken and can't wait to try shrimp.  Leftovers don't separate.  This is a keeper recipe - just look at the number of reviews!

This recipe got rave reviews at our Christmas dinner table.  We are not huge garlic lovers, so I cut the garlic powder in half. I used 2 percent milk, and light cream cheese. It was fabulous - and even better heated up the next day. I will be making this again.

This is pretty tasty for how quick & simple it is to make.  I was worried about the separation issues some people had, but I didn't have that problem at all.  Just whisk it continually while melting the butter & cream cheese, and keep right on whisking as you add the milk gradually.  My hubby used to work at Olive Garden for several years as a server, and he agreed the taste is pretty close to their alfredo sauce.  I did find it needed a tiny bit of salt and more pepper, but overall we were happy with the dish. Thanks for sharing!

Very good recipe. We used a blue cheese Marscapone cheese, which is very similar to cream cheese, fresh parmesan reggiano, and fresh garlic minced super fine. At the very end we added some cubed honey ham and heated through.
You have to whisk constantly, but the result is worth the effort. We loved this and will use it again.

I modified this recipe for 20 servings for the weekly football players dinner.  It was a huge hit with all (and didn't take all day to make!) I added 6 lbs. of cut chicken breast and reduced the recommended 3 TB garlic powder to 2 TB.  Delicious!

I will never make alfredo sauce any other way, this is fantastic!
I halved the recipe and only used 1 tbsp of butter and it was enough for 4 servings of tortellini. also used 1 tsp minced fresh garlic and basil.
If it seems to thin wait until you toss with the pasta it thickens with the starch and cooling.
Today, I made with lactose free milk and margarine, still turned out very good. My son was very happy!

Great recipe! I used real garlic instead of garlic powder....added about two cloves. Will add more next time for my taste. Otherwise was very quick, easy, and affordable!!! I have made this several times since finding this recipe and recently made if for brother and sister-in-law. The next day we were at the Cheesecake Factory for lunch and both told me my alfredo was better then theirs'. Thanks for the great recipe!!!

This recipe is the 'Creme De La Creme' of  alfredo sauces!  Awesome with freshly grilled chicken & steamed brocolli as a side dish.  This is now my only alfredo sauce recipe!  Passing it on to my 4 sisters.  Thank you very much!

This recipe is wonderful it is very simple yet delicious. My family has made this recipe at least a dozen times over the last year.
I highly suggest using unsalted sweet cream butter for this for the best taste.  Also Name brand cream cheese allowed to soften out of the fridge for about an hour before preperation blends the best and is also less likely to seperate when refridgerated. The amount of garlic can be easily changed to yuor taste prefrences, also pull out your pepper mill for this at the table it adds alot more deepth then the canned stuff while heating.

I am not one to write revies or to like alfredo sauce, but I HAD to write about this one.  This is THE BEST Alfredo sauce I have ever tasted, including restaurants.  I have made it 5 times in the past month for family and friends because it is so quick and easy.  No one I talk to believes I put cream cheese in my sauce.  This has easily become MY signature dish for family functions.  The only thing I do differestly is 1/4 cup less milk.  Thanks for the AWESOME recipe.

Good, but not great.  It does not quite taste like alfredo, but is much lighter and is very quick.  I added chicken, mushrooms, and asparagus. I will probably make again when I need something filling and quick.

I love this recipe because it can be made to be reduced fat.  I used it as a base for a shrimp alfredo sauce.  I used no fat cream cheese, added shrimp and crab, and a tablespoon of old bay seasoning.  Everyone loved it in my family.  Thanks for the idea of putting cream cheese in the sause instead of fattening cream.  This is def. a keeper!!

I haven't had too many alfredo sauces, but this is by far the best I've had. I even made a mistake and put the parmesan in with the garlic before putting in the cream cheese. I just kept stirring it with a wisk and it came out fine. I did half the recipe for only three of us, which was plenty. It was just as good the next day. No more jar or dry envelope alfredo sauce for us here, definitely will be making this one again.

I love this recipe but made a few changes.  I use fresh garlic instead of powder.  I use half the amount of butter it calls for and low fat cream cheese.  I also use skim milk.  I think it tastes better with the lower fat ingredients and less butter, otherwise it is much too rich for me.

This was so easy and had an absolutely FANTASTIC flavor!   I added a little cajun seasoning to mine and omitted the pepper.  I also did not have garlic powder, so I added minced garlic to the melted butter.  I sauteed bay scallops in olive oil, garlic and cajun seasoning, then I transferred them to the sauce and poured it all over pasta!  This is a real keeper!  TRY IT, you will not be dissapointed.

This is such an awesome recipe!  I was 100% satisfied.  I was surprised that it called for cream cheese, but decided to go ahead with it since it got such high ratings...I am SO glad I did!  

The first time I used this recipe, I used one cup of heavy cream and one cup of milk, and added maybe one extra ounce or so of cheese.  It turned out really nice, but very rich.  I joked around by calling it "sophisticated macaroni and cheese" because the consistency was very thick and almost clung to the pasta, which is NOT a bad thing if you're in the mood for that!    

The second time I tried it, I used the 2 cups of milk the recipe called for, and it was still stellar.  I have shared this recipe with several friends, and they have had perfect results also.

Awesome recipe, Dawn!  Found this one last minute, trying to find something to use Krab in.  Perfect addition!  I also sprinkled some oregano and seasoned salt (don't know how much - just til it looked good:) and used a 10 oz pouch of Krab meat, and it was absolutely delicious!  Won't use heavy cream again for an alfredo sauce!

To add a twist, I add 2 tablespoons of cajun seasoning after I add the cheese. I  serve with  thinly sliced grilled cajun chicken breast and diced tomatos for garnish.  Goes great with a salad.

Amazingly easy and a good base for variations, I've made this twice, once with shrimp and once with chicken, and it works beautifully.  You've got to love a sauce that is easy enough to prepare after work and good enough to serve to guests.

Bland.  The only thing that made it decent was that I added nutmeg and used fresh minced garlic instead the garlic powder.  The texture was a little grainy, too.  I'll definitely stick to the traditional alfredo recipes with heavy cream from now on.  This is a quick recipe, but it honestly doesn't take much longer to make the real thing.  Sorry!

I thought I still had cream cheese left in the fridge but instead it was the neufchatel cheese, so I halved this recipe just in case if it didn't turn out right. I was wrong!. Neufchatel cheese worked just fine and definitely put more parmesan cheese, a pinch of nutmeg, and sprinkled with some chopped parsley and basil. I served this also with steamed broccoli and mushrooms. YummY.

For a quick and easy Alfredo sauce, this recipe is at the top of my list. I used minced fresh garlic rather than powder and half&half rather than milk.
Its creamy, smooth, and velvety. For a tasty variation, try adding a teaspoon or two of Dijon mustard, then use the sauce to top the Parmesan Chicken submitted by Mollie Hall on this site.Yummy. Thanks for sharing.

I use a similar version to this and love it, but wanted to chime in the THE SECRET to a smoother sauce is to grate your own cheese! For some reason, the pre-grated stuff doesn't blend as well!

I quadrupled this recipe for a group of about 14 and it worked great, it simmered as other things finished cooking leaving it thick and rich- ahlthough I do have tons left over since I wanted more than enough, it has done well in the fridge for the past few days and I'm thinking about freezing it as it is holding up so well which is rare for Alfredo sauce... this recipe is as many others have raved- " a keeper" and if yours happens to be runny I sugest letting it cook longer until just right...

This alfredo sauce was so extremely delicious! I couldn't keep from dipping my finger in it before the pasta was done. It tasted just like it was made in a restaurant and there were absolutely no leftovers! I will definitely be using this over and over. UPDATE: Not too long ago my fiancé told me that this alfredo sauce was the BEST thing i've ever made for him...and I've made A LOT for him. Needless to say, a few days later we made fettucini alfredo together with this sauce and we devoured it! I love love LOVE this recipe!

This is a good recipe alternative for alfreo sauce that typically requires cream.  I had no problems with the consistency. I used low fat (neufchatel) cream cheese and 2% reduced fat milk.  I didn't bother measuring the milk and just poured as much as needed to get the desired consistency.  I've made this recipe twice... the first time using minced garlic and the second time with garlic powder.  The minced garlic had an overwhelming flavor.  I much preferred the powdered garlic my second time around.  Served with tri-color bow tie pasta and broccoli.  Delicious.

This recipe is AWESOME!!!! You must use a whisk for it to turn out perfect. No whisk and it won't turn out as good. Isn't is funny how over 95% of the people reviewing this recipe all rate it so high, but a few mark it down. This is definately the BEST!!!!

This tasted good, but the texture wasn't as smooth as I'm used to.  I even tried adding more milk, but it was to no avail.  It has a grainy texture and that's not quite what I was going for.  I'll keep looking.  Thanks.

I have to give this 5 stars purely for the ease of making it.  The only thing easier is opening up a jar or ordering out.  The taste will appeal to children, not too strong and just the right texture.  You must use a whisk when stirring to keep it smooth.

This was so easy! I love that these are all ingredients I always have on hand. Problem with the overpowering cream cheese taste? Add more parmesan.. I doubled the parmesan. Delicious and quick! Thanks

This is OK, though I really wasn't all that impressed. I think that the cream cheese is way to overpowering. Usually I'm a cream cheese finatic, but this is just too much. I prefer a cream and wine alfredo suace I think. Sorry :(

Loved this!  I used lowfat butter, lowfat cream cheese and skim milk and it tasted fantastic.  Mixed it with some spinach and sauteed mushrooms then served over linguine.  Can't wait to use it on other pasta and add some blackened chicken.  I highly recommend this easy and very tasty sauce!

This recipe is incredible.  I have worked with Chefs in the past and this is on the same calibur as the Chefs!  My entire family loved it!

HINT!!!  If you want CREAMIER sauce, use 2 Cups of Heavy Cream instead of milk.

This was very, very good!  I did make a few changes to cut down a bit on the fat calories.  I used 6 Tablespoons of butter instead of the 1/2 cup and used Neufchatel cheese instead of the cream cheese.  It was still fantastico!!

I added extra parmasean cheese to cut down on the cream cheese flavor.  This was extremely simple and easy to make.  I tossed it with sauteed shrimp, broccoli, and penne pasta.  Tasted great!

This sauce should be called "Alfredo for Dummies". I have made it several times (sometimes with skim milk even) and it has been perfectly creamy every time. Bless you, bless you. My kids love this sauce so much, I am able to slip in brocoli and mushrooms and they eat it all!

It was okay, but I feel too much butter( and I love butter) and too much parmesean. Might want to experiment a bit to suit your own taste. But, otherwise it was good when I did a little add and subtract.

Quick, easy and delicious. I always have the ingredients on hand and don't have to make a run to the store for heavy cream or special cheeses. No worries about burning the milk. It has the same consistancy and flavor everytime.

Wow! I have gone to many expensive italian restaurants and my mom and I think that this is the best fettucine that we have ever had before! Thanks for sharing this:) You really do have to add the cream cheese a little bit at a time and only add about half of the garlic that is called for.

This was very good and easy to make.  I used reduced fat neufchatel cream cheese, and skim milk, hopefully making it a little more healthy.  I didn't use it all, and have refrigerated it. It is not separating, as I was afraid it might.

This is the BEST Alfredo Sauce! We make it all the time modifying the recipe by adding a pinch of nutmeg and using Neufaschtel cheese instead of full fat cream cheese.
AWESOME! Thanks so very much!

I am not big white sauce fan however, this was simple and easy to make.  I used 3 oz of both  freshly grated Romano & Parmesan cheeses.  I also added 1/2 c. additional milk and used minced garlic. (and lots of it!!!) The key is to WHISK WHISK WHISK.  Will most definitely make again.  Thanks.

This is a five star recipe for a few reasons:
1. Minutes before I wanted to cook dinner I found this recipe and had all of the ingredients.  It uses cream cheese instead of cream.  I do not use cream often I don't have it on hand typically.  I would be able to make this recipe anytime.
2. It’s so easy to make, anyone could do it. Just make sure you keep on stirring while cooking.
3. It goes with almost anything. I mixed some nice looking pasta with chicken pieces.  Presto - chango! Chicken Pasta Alfredo - Restaurant style.
4. It's Delicious - for anyone from infants to grandparents.  My one year old loved it. Me too!

I'll never buy Alfredo sauce in a jar again! This is definitely a five star recipe as far as Alfredo sauces go. It reminds me of  the sauce at one of my favorite restaraunts (where my favorite entree is Fettucine Alfredo). The beauty of something like this is that since it replaces a store-bought variety, not only is it less expensive, you can use light ingredients to make it even more health-conscious. I also added a little parsley just for color. Absolutely delicious! Thank you!!

After trying several different recipes for alfredo sauce - I was skeptical when I saw the cream cheese.  I was so used to buying the more expensive heavy whipping cream - I just wasn't sure.  I will never go back!!  This is the BEST sauce, so quick, easy and CHEAP to make!!  Definitely whisk the entire time you are adding the cheese and I always use fresh garlic (just personal preference) for that extra kick!

Love this recipe.  I sometimes use 1/2 and 1/2 to add that little extra instead of milk, it freezes great and I just reheat it on the stove top.

This is DELISH! I won't be buying the jared version any longer! As Dawn says, it's "quick, cheap, and easy"! I served it over wheat rotini. I used 1/3 less fat cream cheese, 1% milk, and added half a bag of frozen broccoli and the consistency was still perfect. In the future I'll try using shredded parmesan and adding mushrooms, chicken, shrimp, or tuna.

I am the worst cook ever. I was never blessed with the gift to please others (as well as myself) with my cooking ability. This recipe is the first thing that I have ever been able to cook that really tastes good. I have had the most compliments on this recipe than anything else that has come from my kitchen. My boyfriend now believes that I might actually have a good chance to turn into a domestic woman. Thanks!

I have to admit, I was very skeptical about this recipe before trying it.  My father and my husband both make killer alfredo sauces and, as a result, I am incredibly picky about my alfredo sauce when I go out to a restaurant.  But I must say, this recipe was fantastic and tastes just like the ones that my father and husband make, although with a lot less effort and a more reliable result.  We used crushed garlic instead of garlic powder, but other than that, kept the recipe.  This is a keeper!

wow and wow!!!  This sauce was easy to make even with a year old holding onto my pantleg.  I added some cooked chicken (2 boneless breasts, cubed) and 4 oz. steamed broccoli.  I tried white pepper instead of the black...more of a bite and it kept the white sauce, WHITE!

Have tried a few alfredo recipes and so far, this one has turned out the creamiest.  I used low fat cream cheese and it was still good.  Also, DON'T EVEN THINK about using the canned parmesan.  Fresh only!!!  It may take a lot longer to grate but it's worth it.  This recipe makes enough sauce for one package of alfredo, and it really does thicken up quickly.  Thank for the great recipe!
Edit:  I would probably use less garlic powder next time or maybe real garlic instead, and reheating it's not as good, kinda clumpy, still delicious, though.

This recipe was okay. I used the kraft parmesan cheese and it made the alfredo taste artificial, and that was all I tasted. If I make this again I will use fresh parmesan and less of it.

Wow!  When I first saw this recipe I was thrown by the cream cheese and never would have tried it if it weren't for all the good reviews.  I'm so glad I did.  My husband and I both agreed the results were delicious and reheated well the next night WAY better than some alfredo sauces we've brought home from restaurants.  I'll definitely make this again.

Well, it's not the best alfredo I've ever eaten but not bad.  My 13 year old daughter just loved it and my husband didn't bother to try it. As for me I thought it was pretty good and 
needed more garlic.  It was definetly easy.  I will definetly
make it again, but with more garlic and I bet it would taste
even better if the garlic was fresh, not powder.

I wish I could give this recipe MORE than 5 stars!! It is the best sauce I have ever had! I printed it out about a year ago and have used it SO many times! I've used it over pasta, I've used it in lasagna, I've used it as a pizza sauce, and I've even used it in Tuna casserole! I get so many compliments on this sauce no matter how I use it. I've taken it to pot lucks, family gatherings and to "couple's dinner night" and have had to print this recipe out time and time again to pass out. I love it just the way it is. I have lessened the amount of milk if I want a thicker sauce, or I added more garlic to make it a garlicy pizza sauce, but usually I keep it just the way it is!!! I will probably use this recipe forever!!!

This took longer than 5 minutes, but was very tasty.  I used about half of it for one package of refrigerated linguine, so had plenty leftover for another time.  I misread and used garlic SALT instead of powder (whoops!), but it actually turned out great.  (I suspect it might even need some additional salt if you just used powder as directed.)  Used about a cup of fresh grated parmesan -- husband and I both enjoyed it.   Thanks, Dawn!

I read several reviews and decided to try this recipe and spice it up a bit since the biggest complaint was that it was too bland.  I added 1 tsp. coarse sea salt and 1 TBS dried parsley.  I used fresh garlic instead of powder and doubled the pepper.  Mine was not thick enough so I added 1 TBS Wondra flour and it was perfect.  Also, I used lite cream cheese because that's what I had in the frig and 1% milk for the same reason.  It does make ALOT of sauce, too much for 1 lb cooked linguini, and we used it generously on the linguini.  You could easily half the recipe I think.  Good luck, we loved it and will make it again!

This is soooo good. I've tried some of the suggestions here: lots of fresh garlic, some zing with cayenne flakes, have tried with reduced fat milk and heavy cream too, used the sauce with pasta and veggies (serve it immediately for best yumminess as it doesn't sit very well), with grilled prawns and fish (add some lemon juice in sauce), as a dip, had it with crusty sliced bread. Excellent. Thanks Dawn.

Much better than from the jar. We have a lot of really good, authentic Italian restaurants where I live and it wasn't quite as good as what we can get there.  Still it was creamy and rich, the best I've made at home and will make it again.

This recipe is absolutely amazing! So quick, so easy, so good! This recipe was the only one I've ever tried for making homemade alfredo sauce and I hit the jackpot with it. My father actually calls me up and asks me to make it and take it to him! I've made it with fresh garlic and garlic powder and it's come out just as good with either. Also fresh parmesan cheese in the block form is a rariety in this area, so I have always used the canned stuff and it has always come out perfect. No grainy texture, just a wonderful smooth sauce.

W-O-W !!!!!!!!This is sooooooo easy and sooooo good.  This is the first time I have ever tried alfredo sauce that didn't come in a jar.  I will NEVER go back to premade processed sauces.  This sauce was so creamy and had the best flavor.  I used half milk and half heavy cream.  Very fattening, but also very tasty.  I sauteed diced chicken with mushrooms, onions, garlic powder, onion powder and Mrs. Dash.  Served with fettuccini noodles and this sauce, and my husband was in heaven.  Even my picky 3 year old ate it without a fight.  Thank you for this incredible recipe Dawn!!

This recipe was so easy.  The only thing I changed was to use fresh garlic that I browned at the beginning with the butter.  This recipe works great with Dried Parmesan cheese too!  My husband and my kids loved it.  It also reheats really well - no separation.

I LOVE this sauce!  After I prepared it once as directed, I tried my own little variation: I browned some minced garlic in a TBSP of olive oil with some oregano and italian seasonings while the butter and cream chese were melting.  Then I drained the oil (and set it side for another recipe) and added the browned garlic to the sauce.  I added a little more seasoning (I love italian herbs!) and it was great.  This recipe is so easy, and can easily be added to to suit your own tastes.  Anyone can make this.  My 19 month old son loved this sauce.  It's even great to turn into a blush by adding a little marinara to it.

This sauce is excellent!!  Better than any sauce I have ever tasted.  For the cream cheese, I used low fat, and used 2% milk, and I think the trick to making this sauce great is the type of parmesan cheese you use.  I used an expensive parmesan cheese I purchased at the local Central Market which carries a huge variety of cheese, it tasted wonderful!  I will make this again very soon!  thanks for the great recipe!!!

Pretty good.. definitely EASY.. although I'm feeling a bit light headed right now due to the richness of the sauce! I didn't really measure the amount of milk used, and when i tossed the sauce with pasta it solidified quite quickly, probably due to lack of milk.. so i'll use more, as the original recipe suggests, next time.

This is quick and easy with pretty good results.  It does make more than four servings though!! I used a little less garlic powder and even though I used this in a recipe that called for alfredo sauce, I can't wait to make this again for noodles. Thanks!

Excellent recipe and so easy to make. I sauted fresh garlic in the butter instead of using garlic powder and the taste is awesome! I also saute some vegetables on the side (onions, bell peppers, mushrooms and zucchini) seasoned with dried basil and oregano and add it to the sauce in the end. The recipe is a definite keeper.

I was disappointed with this recipe.  It did cook up very quickly but the sauce was to thick and had an overpowering garlic taste.  I wouldn't make it again.

so easy and so good! One batch makes enough for a pound of cooked egg noodles.  I also added just a pinch of nutmeg.  Not cream cheesy at all, just rich and delish.  No more boxed noodles for me!  Thanks

Absolutely wonderful!!! I used suggestions listed in reviews and used part milk and part half and half. I also added fresh garlic and basil. The end result: creamy sauce with fantastic flavor. Beats the Olive Garden and Carrabba's HANDS DOWN!!!

I have made this recipie tonnes of times and people rave about it each and every time! I aded caramelized onions and white button mushrooms  and the sweetness of the onions and the flavour of the mushrooms came through beautfifully! I tired adding flaked salmon or smoked and it was heavenly! Tip: While using smoked salmon, cut down on the salt as it can be too salty. Also, I used only one and a half cup of milk as I liked it thicker and I always use full cream milk, like Masters. The calories are worth it!

WOW!!!! I don't know how I've gone my entire life without this!!! It was exactly like the Olive Garden, now I can make it at home without having to make a trip to the resteraunt and spend so much!!! This is wonderful. Nice and creamy, I served mine over buttered fettucini noodles. Thanks sooooo much :)

Well I can agree with the 'quick' and the 'easy', I didn't think that the flavor was worth the calories. I followed the recipe exactly and used best ingredients, but it still fell a bit short of what I am looking for taste-wise. Oh well, off to the gym to work off the 600+ calories per serving!

Very easy to prepare. Takes just as long to cook as it does the noodles. Taste far better than 
Olive Garden. Even better with crab meat.

I would have liked this to have a little more bite.  A little spicier, perhaps?  It's lacking a little something.

Fantastic Sauce! If you eat meat, small crispy bacon bits added to the sauce is a great variation.

My husband and I love this alfredo sauce recipe. It is easy and quick. We love a rich sauce so I sometimes substitute the milk with whipping cream. No calorie counting here. It is wonderful. YUM!! May 8, 2003: I have made this sauce a hundred times with no problems and much success...until today when I used lowfat ingredients. I had a terrible time with it, the ingredients (which are the same as when previously made, except I used lowfat cream cheese and milk instead of half & half/cream in combination with milk) did not want to blend and the sauce never did get thick. I ended up adding additional Parmesan cheese and cream cheese...still no luck. Maybe I am used to a thick sauce but using the lowfat items was very disappointing. PS. I used the lower fat products because I am planning on freezing the sauce and was told that sometimes high fat items do not freeze well.

Since we love Alfredo sauce, I have been looking for one that uses basic ingredients I generally have on hand; so I was very excited to find this recipe!  It is wonderful.  I used just over half of the garlic called for because it was too strong for the kids, but everyone loved it.

I used fat free cream cheese and this still made a very creamy dish.  My family thought the garlic was too strong-I'll use less next time.

This was excellent. I used fresh garlic rather than powdered. I also didn’t have milk so I used heavy cream mixed with water. I also added some dried basil (from my garden). Grated Parmesan. It makes a lot. Loved it though. Great flavour! Incidentally, I think it might depend on the quality of the parm that you use. (If you think it tasted like cream cheese)  I always buy and grate it myself vs the instant stuff.  It also freezes and thaws well in case you are interested. When I reheat it though, I do it in a pan and not too high a heat or for too long or it will separate.  Either way, a keeper! Thank you!

Easy - yummy - FAST! Oh my...  this is the best. 
Based on a couple of reviews I used 1 tsp. of fresh minced garlic in place of 1 tsp of garlic powder. I increased the parmesan to 1 cup... and I added a little more milk (2 -1/4 cu.) and cooked it down but left it a little runnier to better cover the broccoli . This sauce with penne, sauteed chicken and broccoli florets was the best I've ever tasted. It will be a staple in my home -  THANK YOU!!

Since I found this recipe a few years ago, it has become my go-to Alfredo sauce recipe.  You can't tell there is cream cheese in it at all.  Another reviewer suggested they couldn't eat it at all unless they added (meat veggies and pasta) to it....but I kind of thought that was the point.  I've never eaten just a giant bowl of Alfredo sauce.  Maybe some people do that.  I don't know.

My family's favorite way to have this is over linguini noodles with shrimp and broccoli.  It's a quick and easy pasta meal that is super delicious!

I had some half and half which I used in place of some of the milk, and used some Romano Parmesan mix, and i added chopped leftover turkey and it turned out great! But it made quite a lot of sauce, enough for a family and I’m only one, so I froze the leftovers, and when I defrosted it, it was even better! I plan to make this again!

OoooK  I don't understand bad reviews  I made this.   I made it as stated except I only used 3 oz. of Parmesan cheese , as the reason I don't like most  Alfredo sauces is that they have too much Parmesan flavor.  What I liked most is that it stayed in liquid form even hours later.  Do not hesitate to make this sauce it was amazing!!!

I made this the other day, and let me tell you.. I will NEVER use a jar of Alfredo sauce again!! I made it exactly as the recipe said to and it turned out great! I put it over bow tie pasta, added a bag of steamed broccoli and some cooked chicken breast served with garlic bread...yum! Made a delicious meal for my family. And easy on the budget! This will be my go-to recipe for Alfredo sauce, thanks!!

we use less milk, adding until I we like the consistency of the sauce.  This is the best Alfredo sauce.  The entire family (kids ages 2-19) likes this recipe.

Quick, easy and amazing. I made this sauce in a last minute crunch. I kind of followed the directions and did not have a whisk, but the sauce still came out delicious—a true testiment to how easy this recipe truly is. I added some cottage cheese and garlic flavored Greek yogurt dip because I did not have enough cream cheese. I think it came out healthier and more to my liking than traditional Alfredo sauce which I find too heavy for my taste. But even if I had added all the cream cheese recommended by the recipe I am sure the sauce would have turned out to my liking. Never going back to store bought again!

It is in fact quick & easy. Tasted delicious. I've made it exact to recipe as well as a few times with some onion powder added. Perfect with pasta and chicken. My family loves it. Also great as a large batch to freeze for later.

It helped that a previous reviewer hinted that the secret is patient whisking. Because I added the milk slowly and didn't overheat, this recipe turned out smooth and creamy with no clumps. I made it exactly as directed for a family of 6 (including 4 little girls between 3-10 years old). It served all with some leftovers. And it was a hit. Even the pickiest girl in the bunch had seconds. Also, it was FAST, and for this busy mom, quick counts!!

It was so easy & quick! I followed the recipe except used less milk as one reviewer suggested. EXCEPT: I had to make several substitutions simply because I refuse to go to the grocery store. So, I used 4oz feta cheese, 6oz cream cheese and light butter. I added ground turkey to the final product. I also added fresh broccoli because I was raised to always add something green to alfredo cream sauces. This was super easy. I just chopped up the broccoli & tossed it in. The heat from the sauce warms the broccoli just fine & it added a good crunch!

The butter kept separating from the sauce and the sauce itself was grainy. I made the recipe as written and the flavor was just off.. I'm not sure how to explain it.

DELISH!! EASY!!! and FAST!!!
Made it a bit more health conscious - used fake butter, low fat cream cheese, 2% milk, and only 4oz of parmesan. Also sauted so half of white onion in the butter. Served it over zucchini/spinach veggie noodles -- My very picky 5 year olds had seconds!!!

Love this!  It is super easy to make.  My only "complaint" is that the recipe does not suggest how much pasta to serve with it.  I found that a full batch is enough for 16 ounces of fettuccine.  For my husband and me, I cut the recipe in half and we still have leftovers.

Absolutely fantastic!! I recently made this for a pasta dish, and the entire family of eight loved it, and they can be picky! It had a lovely creamy texture that was a very pleasant difference from some of the previous recipes I've tried before. Of course, I found no complaint for the flavor either. Defiantly saving this recipe!

Yum, so good!  Hubby and I both really enjoyed this recipe. It was my first time making Alfredo sauce, and I'm so glad I chose this recipe. I used light cream cheese and it was still rich and flavorful. It makes a LOT, so next time I'll cut in half. Thanks for sharing!

We used this recipe (doubled for family of 6) . It was awesome.  we used spaghetti noodles from a church supper.  We put the noodles in the casserole dish, added the alfredo sauce and put shrimp pieces on top and baked in the oven for 30 minutes.  It is all gone. We will use this recipe frequently. Shamrockbell.

Made this for my picky kids last night...they loved it! Following others' suggestions...I used a clove of garlic and reduced the milk to 1 3/4 cups. So simple and delicious...we will be making this ALL the time!

Sauce turned out great and was super easy. Once sauce was added to the Noodles, it had the perfect thickness and texture. I added paprika and cayenne pepper for a little zing.

I made this recipe last night, with the assistance of a suggestion made in a previous rater.  It turned out well.  Rather than garlic powder, I will opt for fresh garlic next time.  I enjoyed the cream cheese, as it assisted, in the forming of the base of the recipe.  It's always a tough call as to what temperature to keep in on, after everyone is served.  The burner was turned off, and like cheese does, it solidified again.  Warming it up for lunch in the microwave, a few seconds at a time, seemed to do the trick.  I would choose to make it again.  YUM!

I live alone and try to come up with quick things I can make, often in microwave.  I was thrilled to find I can put these ingredients in my small processer,  (half recipe) except use canned  coconut milk in place of milk.  Two or three frozen meat balls in cup or bowl  with spiraled zucchini, squash and/or spinach, or whatever desired, a little Alfredo sauce and have a delicious, nutritious meal  in three or four seconds in microwave.  Thick, creamy and delish!

We liked this a lot.  I didn't have much cream, so needed a recipe I could adapt to make an alfredo sauce.  Great in a pinch!  I didn't add any milk, just approx. 3/4 c. of cream and 1/4 c. of butter.

I made this last night and I didn't have any problems making it. The cream cheese and butter mixed smoothly. I used fat free half n half and 3 ounces of parmesan  and 3 ounces of Romano cheese. It blended smoothly and looked good but I did not care for it at all. I could taste the cream cheese slightly and to me it didn't taste like Alfredo sauce. I don't think my switches in cheese and milk would change the taste enough to cause me to dislike it, if anything it would have made it taste better to me. After several bites I had to through it away, I just couldn't tolerate the taste.

Four and a half stars, but not five. Very quick and easy and simple for a short-cut recipe, but a few changes to upgrade the flavour. First of all, I used fresh garlic instead of powder. Secondly, I didn't feel the need for a full brick of cream cheese, so I reduced it by half. And finally, some fresh chopped parsley to finish.

This is a fantastic recipe. I followed it step by step exactly and it turned out great. My family loved it. My husband said " I know how to make a man hungry" when he walked in and smelled it cooking he couldn't keep his spoon out of the sauce. Always a good sign. I didn't change anything. Just doubled it as I have a big family and added chicken breast for meat. Thats it :) Thank you so much!!!!!

This couldn't have been easier! I cut it in half, to use on french bread white pizza. I put a sauce pan on med-low, cut the butter and cr.cheese in chunks, let it start to melt and whisked untill it was smooth...it looked pretty lumpy at first, but magically smoothed out after a minute. I added a tsp of Mrs. Dash italian seasoning also. It was great and took less than 5 mins to whip up!!! So rich! I would not hesitate to use low-fat cr. cheese/milk! I AM going to add a dash of nutmeg to the rest to see how that perks it up!

This was a very easy and tasty sauce. I halved the recipe and used fresh garlic instead powder. I only have whole milk because that's what my kids drink. I added a sprinkle of Italian seasoning which added extra flavor. Half of the recipe was more than enough for a jumbo size container of Buitoni tortellini. I think following this recipe would make a ton of sauce

Super simple and delicious recipe! I loved that I had all of these ingredients on hand. I did, however, substitute fresh garlic for the garlic powder and I also added Slap Ya Mama seasoning because I like food on the spicy side. Very tasty! I will be adding this to our regular menu. Thank you for sharing! :)

This was really good. 4+ Stars. When you are first mixing the cream cheese with the melted butter, it starts to look congealed, which scared me, but I kept whisking it and it came together. Added a whole rotisserie Chicken cut into bite size pieces and some cooked broccoli to the sauce. My men were happy. Thanks for the new recipe!

Not in ten minutes, the cream cheese and butter would not easily mix, I heated it to near boiling and had to use an electric whisk and the Parmesan was hard to blend in, it took around 20+ minutes until the milk was slowly added and it finally did come together somewhat. The flavor was good, but next time will use Gorgonzola or Bleu cheese instead of cream cheese

on 1/4/15 just finished eating some of this an it is a wonderful an easy recipe followed recipe as written no complaints at all. my own personal taste says a little more garlic powder maybe 1/2 tsp more at the most and some salt I do not know maybe 1/4 tsp - 1/2 tsp more. I used less milk because some said it was to thin mine was thick but I did not mind will use the full 2 cups next time though being to thin will not be a issue but my experience with this recipe is great again I have no complaints or criticisms thank you so much for sharing this easy and delicious recipe

Made this tonight and it was delicious! Would cut back on the Parmesan a little, and I added minced garlic and a tiny bit of white wine.  I sautéed some garlic, onions, mushrooms, spinach and chicken sausage and tossed it over some fettuccine with this sauce...amazing! Next time I will make sure I have some breadsticks to dip in the leftover sauce. Definitely a new staple in my house :)

This is an excellent recipe. My 13 year old daughter loves alfredo sauce, but dislikes cream cheese. While I was making this, she stated, "Wow Mom, what are you cooking? It smells so delicious! I placed some on a spoon and had her taste it. Her face lit up with a huge smile and then puts two thumbs up. Then I mentioned the secret ingredient...cream cheese...hehehe. It is true what others stated about not being able to taste it in the sauce. I adjusted the garlic to 1 teaspoon and added salt and a dash of nutmeg. This sauce is so creamy and full of flavor...we love it!

This recipe is exactly what it promises.  Quick and easy - it was a crowd pleaser at my dinner table, too.  Followed Reg927's advice and added some fresh minced garlic to the butter.  Used half and half with the cream cheese.  I used my cast-iron grilling pan to make grilled chicken breasts and sautéed some sliced mushrooms.  For my vegetarian stepdaughter I left out the chicken on her plate.  Threw in a dash of dried oregano at the end.  Easy, tasty, good.

FANTASTIC! I made the recipe exactly as it was given and got great results. So quick and easy....and sooo delicious. I hate buying jarred alfredo sauce because it's never as good as the restaurants, so this is a brilliant alternative. My 18 month old and husband love it! It made enough to use for one night, and I jarred the rest for use throughout the rest of the week. Just make it as is and see what you think, then change it if you want. Seems pretty flexible if that's desired, but very good as is!

I'm not a huge salt user, and this needed salt...but with it, it was wonderful. There's enough sauce for a 12oz box of noodles (we used bow ties). We had only used part of the box since it says it's a 6 serving box, and had already started the noodles when I realized there would be more than enough sauce to do all of them, so we just piled on extra sauce and are enjoying it now. Great recipe for my first time making alfredo at home.

Loved it~! I did change a few things .. used Light Herb&Garlic cream cheese and Olive Oil Margarine instead of butter. I also only used a small container of cream cheese vs the 8oz package so i cut back the milk - best advice i can agree with is to make sure you're only adding SMALL amounts of milk at a time to get the desired consistency - can get runny really easily. Over all I loved how fast this recipe was to throw together - THANK YOU ! :)

Hands down best alfredo sauce I've ever had! All I did differently was sweated some baby bellas and added the juice to my sauce as I was reducing then added the mushrooms themselves when I was done. I also added some cheeses that I love, swiss, Monterey jack, and some of my other white cheese faves to add to the mix. Delicious!

This recipes was DELICIOUS! It tasted just like Olive Garden's Alfredo sauce! The only thing I changed is I did only one teaspoon of garlic powder and then added a teaspoon of minced garlic.

This recipe changed my cooking experience! I always cooked from packages, frozen dinners, using cream of something soup. I am a baker, through and through. I love baking anything and everything, and am extremely experimental when it comes to baking new things, but never cooking. This recipe is absolutely remarkable. The simplicity is amazing, and it creates something you never thought you'd be able to create out of those ingredients. I love using small pastas like penne, rotini (corkscrews), and bowties (farfalle) for this recipe as I find it absorbs sauce better. I always add chicken, and sometimes broccoli and fresh cherry tomatoes, but it absolutely sublime on it's own for a midnight meal. I'm a cheese girl, if I was asked what food I'd  want for the rest of my life it would be cheese (or this alfredo), and I love adding in some extra mozzarella as it's cooking for some thickness and texture. This pasta sauce has become my life, and if you follow the directions correctly it is extremely simple.

I really like this idea.  The cream cheese makes a very yummy sauce that's quick and easy to make.  With all food, there will be some adjustments based on personal taste/preference.  For me, this needed a lot less milk. I used almost half as much as the recipe called for.  I also used a pecorino romano cheese.  The type of cheese you use will make a big difference as to whether or not your sauce tastes like cream cheese.  Mine did not.  It was just rich and creamy with a lovely pecorino romano taste.

I have made this  several times, as chicken and broccoli, straight Alfredo, seafood Alfredo with scallops and shrimp, and broccoli Alfredo. Suggestion to all, I use minced garlic and add it to the melted butter and Saute it a couple minutes. Then add my pepper. After adding the cream cheese I bring back up to temp. Then add either grated parmesan cheese or shredded(IMHO combo of both works best). If I am just using straight grated I bring out the immersion blender to help mix the grated parm in. Hope any of this helps.

While this tasted good, this was nothing like alfredo sauce. But it's a quick and easy recipe, extremely convenient for a weeknight dinner, with a very short list of ingredients. The key is to cook on low heat and to keep stirring with the whisk constantly. Instead of garlic powder, I sauteed real garlic in the butter. I used half-n-half and shaved Parmesan and that made the sauce thicker. In a pinch, you could use this as a dip for chips if you reduced the milk by 1/2 cup.

Tried this recipe and LOVED IT! The ONLY substitution I did was 1 teaspoon minced garlic instead of the powder since I ran out of the garlic powder. I also like additions to my Alfredo so I added some mushrooms and shrimps. YUMMY!

"Good Stuff" to quote my husband. My children chowed it down! I did do a few things different but I don't believe I changed the recipe enough not to rate it according to how it is written. I didn't use powdered  garlic but used left over roasted garlic (3 cloves) and I freeze my cream cheese so when I melted the cream cheese and added the cloves I used my emulsifier to cream the mixture. I tried the sauce and it was awesome on its own, but I wanted to use up some left over smoked chicken so I added that and it added a nice layer of flavor. Also, I was concerned when I mixed it with my noodles that it was too thin, but it does thicken up! So don't freak out when you add it to your noodles, give it a little time like the recipe states and it will turn out nicely.

it's quick, easy and tasty. no, it's not the sauces Nic said,"something comparable to the sauces in finer Italian restaurants". just looking at the ingredients that is obvious. also ANYTIME it says, "quick and easy" it's not going to be necessarily restaurant quality. it's perfect for a nice meal at home with any dish. i just make it chicken and penne pasta. my family ate it up. it's definitely tastier and more flavorful than package or fast food alfredo. i'll definitely be making it more often. also i will add different cheeses to make it in the future.

Wow. It's so good, a lot better than I was expecting. I've often seen good reviews of this recipe, but for some reason didn't think I'd love it. But it was great, just as good if not better than the normal cream- butter-parmesan Alfredo that I usually make. Though reviews said it, I was surprised I didn't taste the cream cheese. Maybe a tiny hint of it, but if you didn't know it was in there, you wouldn't guess. I used light cream cheese because that's what I had on hand, and it still made a nice rich sauce. I would definitely make this again.

I don't know if I seasoned it properly.  Maybe I needed more?  It had more of a cream cheese taste than I wanted.  Will probably make again, but adjust the seasonings.

This is a very easy and tasty sauce.  I did have to add a little corn starch to mine as it was a little too thin for me.  Great flavor, This is going to be one of my go to recipes.

The original recipe didn't have enough garlic for my family so I added more and some salt as well. I added chicken and broccoli to the sauce as well. With just a little doctoring this came out really great and was really easy! I was also very surprised that you couldn't taste the cream cheese at. Overall I was very happy. ^__^

This sauce was absolutely delicious! We have tried making homemade Alfredo sauce on a handful of occasions but none of them turned out as beautiful and tasty as this recipe. I followed the recipe but also as other reviewers suggested, added some oregano, nutmeg, and thyme to give it a little kick! I made this sauce using the lower end of heat settings on my stove (settings 1-3) in fear that I would overcook it too fast. Doing this also allowed me time to prepare the noodles and chicken that I was serving without having to rush. I will continue to use this recipe and now refuse to buy pre-made sauce!

So the Alfredo sauce turned out great! Though I did not realize that I did not have all of the proper ingredients before I started so I had to improvise. I only had about 3 ounces worth of Parmesan so I added about an ounce of Romano also and about 1/8 of a cup of shredded mozzarella. I also doubled the amount of pepper, added 2 tablespoons of flour, and 1/4 cup of milk extra. It turned out fantastic!

I have made something similar to this before and couldn't remember the recipe I used before. The reason I rated it so low is this had no flavor. I followed it to a T. I added some salt, Italian herbs, oregano, onion powder, and more pepper. The added flavor helped a lot. It made the sauce go from bland to tasty.

Tasted pretty good and was easy to make. I used neufchatel cheese which is the lower fat cream cheese and I wouldn't recommend that because it created a texture that was a bit grainy. This also could use some salt.  I think anyway, I'm pregnant and I think my taste buds changed a bit.  I definitely added a lot of salt :) I will still make this because, as the title indicates, it is quick and easy to make.

Amazing! Let me tell you, I will not order anything with Alfredo at restaurants as I'm afraid of the homemade stuff and it alwayz tasted weird to me. Yes, I preferred jarred sauce. I have made this numerous times (never really knowing if I'm using as much cheese as it calls for) and it is amazing! I have stopped buying jarred! As is this recipe is amazing, and it plays nice with adding anything (cayan, chipotle peppers, mushrooms).

Really easy/real good.  Second time I made it, I used an asiago/Romano/Parmesan blend.  It sharpened it up a little bit.  Good as is though.  So much better than jar sauce!  Hubby's favorite with shrimp, spinach, grape tomatoes over spinach fettichini.

Excellent!  I can definitely taste the cream cheese, although it's not overpowering!  I did a pinch of pink sea salt.  Mixed with spinach, mushrooms and pasta - outstanding!

I am known as the worst cook in the family, but I enjoy it so I keep trying!  I was given some fresh spinach and chicken ravioli by a neighbor and knew that the best sauce to compliment them was alfredo.  Allrecipies.com to the rescue again!  I followed the recipie exactly as written and my sauce did not separate before adding milk.  Took a few minutes to get creamy tho.  Just when I was about to give up whisking my life away, there it was, smooth and creamy.  Added the full 2c of milk and all 6 oz of green can parm.  Amazing! Even my 3 year old gobbled it up!

I read all the reviews (well the ones on the main page) and decided I would switch the recipe up a little :) 
I added fresh tomatoes, garlic paste, basil, and Italian seasoning and let that simmer (first) with some olive oil
then I added the butter
then the cream cheese
after that was cooked down I added the milk, but instead of 2 cups of milk I used 1 cup milk and 1 cup chicken broth 
I let that simmer a little and then added shredded mozzarella cheese
I topped it off with some fresh basil, ground black pepper, and a little garlic powder. 

it was delicious!

I think the recipe was good, but could be so much better! First off I traded the garlic power for a few cloves of minced garlic and let it sautee in the melted butter until golden and fragrant. I used 1 1/2 cup skim milk, and a parmesan and mozzarella mix. I added double the pepper and just a pinch of salt. I was skeptical when I added the cream cheese to the butter, it didn't seem to be mixing, but once you add the milk and whisk away it all comes together. It had a great flavor, no cream cheese taste at all! Super smooth and creamy, I put it with linguine, shrimp, mushrooms and a little lemon. If only I had capers! The recipe says it makes 4 servings but I think it could easily be 6-8 depending on serving sizes.

Great sauce! I added about 3 tablespoons of frozen minced basil and a 16 oz package of chopped spinach.  Waited until the last moment to add the shredded cheese along with the cooked pasta.  Creamy deliciousness!!

I thought this was a very good basic alfredo sauce. Easy to make with very little hassle. I did add fresh garlic, oregano, and basil to it to add extra flavor.

A pretty decent sauce, however a little bland on its own just by following directions. I modified it, by adding more spices to my own preference.  Worth giving a shot!

Made this for two picky teenagers and a picky wife, was a big hit and just a little tweeking needed, was a little gritty with the parm. but good. the best part is from stove to table very little time needed. it takes longer to peel the shrimp than it does to make this.

Not an authentic Alfredo sauce but definitely a delicious cheese sauce. I guess the difference is the absence of cream. Followed the recipe exactly. Only difference was that instead of garlic powder I added 2 cloves of grated garlic.

This was good and rich.  I cut the cream cheese by half and still found it a little rich for my taste. Will make again with a little tweaking.  Used with angel hair pasta and added broccoli as a side dish with baked fish.

As is: perfect.  I've added blended cauliflower and spinach a few times now to sneak some more veggies into the meal; usually served over penne and steamed broccoli. I've done with and without nutmeg- didn't notice a difference. I guess we go easy on the sauce in this house because I have found this to yeild wayyy more than 4 servings- this is a family favorite (even picky 15 month old!)...thank you for sharing!

Delicious! And so quick and easy! Next time, I'll try the recommendation of gruyere cheese, instead of parmesan -- she was right: parmesan doesn't' t melt too easily.

Fantastic sauce!!  All 3 of my kids and my husband loved it.  We ate it with chicken and vegetables over pasta, and also dipped bread sticks in it.  The only change I made was I used fresh pressed garlic.  Wonderful and very versatile!

This recipe is so simple to make and tastes waaaayyyy better than the generic jarred kind from the grocery store. I'll never use the kind in the jar again. Instead of Parm, I use the shredded Sargento Italian blend cheese. Delish!!! :)

I had some issues with this and can't tell if it was user error.  First, my sauce never really thickened. The cream cheese and butter mixture didn't look too promising, but when I poured in the milk it immediately smoothed up and looked beautiful. As I poured in more and more milk, it got too soupy and not saucy any more. I wished I would have stopped when it looked right but I wanted to follow the recipe. After that, I didn't know if it was ruined or if I just needed to keep cooking until it thickened, so I stirred and stirred and nothing happened.  I eventually mixed in some flour paste in hopes that it would thicken. I finally gave up and took it off the heat, and it promptly began to separate. It is possible that I overcooked it waiting for it to thicken, but the instructions are too vague to know how long to stir or what to expect to see.

The end product was tasty even though it was a little oily. It was VERY rich!  I think it had too much Parmesan. I served it over sautéed chicken, broccolini, and rigatoni. No one had seconds.  It did have a restaurant quality flavor, but I won't probably make this again, especially not for my kids.

This came out really delicious and like others have said you do not taste the cream cheese. Now, I'm not able to compare it to other homemade alfredo recipes because I just recently went from being a pasta-roni girl to trying to cook stuff from scratch lol, but I can tell you this tasted really good.   
I made two changes: At the advice of other reviewers I threw in a dash of nutmeg; And instead of garlic powder, I minced some garlic fresh and used that. 
I would definitely recommend at least giving this recipe a chance. We will be using it at our house again!

Very good! I've used this for years. My husband and daughter can't get enough. I add just a touch of nutmeg, but that's the only thing I do different.

Okay so I have been using this for years and years. Changes I made: I use garlic OR parmesan since they are quite strong together. I have cut the butter almost completely, and sometimes throw in sour cream. Sometimes I use heavy cream instead of milk. My entire family loves this sauce, and we have used variations for so many things! Sauce for white lasagna, casseroles, etc. It's not just a great alfredo, but a wonderful base for other things!

I ran out of Parmesan cheese and ended up using the cheap-o grated stuff from the green can. It still was awesome!

This is the first time making this sauce and  I thought it was a great fast Alfredo sauce, I made a few changes, instead of using plain cream cheese, I used Kraft Philadelphia Herb & Garlic spreadable cream cheese. I also added about 4 clove of minced fresh garlic instead of garlic powder. The main thing to remember when melting the cheese is keep the heat low and slow and it will turn out smooth and creamy.

This recipe is awesome! I was worried about the cream cheese but you can't even taste it. By far the easiest Alfredo I've ever made. I make it with shrimp, salmon and scallops . The family loves it!

This was a hit for my 5 year old little girl. She loves Alfredo sauce and tries it at every Italian food spot we go. It came out perfect she gave it two thumbs up! I cut the recipe in half since I only made it for her and used Penne pasta. I tried some myself and love it! Thanks for sharing this recipe!

This recipe is AWESOME! What I did was buy the shrimp scampi from Sam's Club and I used the garlic/butter sauce from the shrimp as the butter and garlic in the recipe! Fabulous!

I just made this for dinner tonight. I cut the recipe in half; just me for dinner. I used only 2 ounces of the cream cheese and used 1/2 cup of milk and 1/2 cup of heavy cream. I will not use jar sauce again, this is so much better tasting.

I prepared this for my roommates and my boyfriend and they couldn't get enough! It saves very well, can be adapted to whatever tastes you prefer. I added oregano, basil, and bay leaves because I'm fond of that particular spice combination but it can adapt to whatever you want to through at it. It's also great with shrimp or chicken. That being said, I added 4 oz of Mozzarella and 4 oz of Parmesan instead of just the latter because it didn't taste cheesy enough for my particular palette. All in all, it's a great base recipe however not one that I would say follow to the letter.

Pretty great and easy. I cut the Parmesan down to 4 oz and it still tasted plenty cheesy. I also added some parsley, oregano, and rosemary.

My husband and I both loved it.  It was very rich and creamy.  I followed a few of the suggestions, adding a dash of nutmeg and oregano.  My only issue was that maybe it was too good and I can see myself getting chubbier very quickly if I eat this too often. :)

This was really great tasting and pretty easy to whip up.  I was a bit short on the cream cheese, probably only had about 6 ounces, but it still tasted great and easily served 4 large portions of chicken with veggies and pasta for a fairly quick pasta alfredo. I had sauteed the chicken and veggies in olive oil and didn't drain it for this dish --it worked nicely with this sauce. I used parmesan already SHREDDED -- the kind in a plastic tub that is pre-packaged --  and that is pricey to buy (almost $5) and the cream cheese is around $1.50, so this sauce is about a $7 undertaking on average. Depending on sales, you could likely buy the alfredo in a jar for cheaper, but it doesn't taste as good as this in my opinion.

My 14 year old son made this and was skeptical due to some of the reviews. He was quite happy with results and said it is quite delicious. We used Neufchâtel  and 1% milk and worked well with less fat and calories.

This was delicious and so easy.  The only change was I used fresh chopped garlic which I sauted in the butter before adding the other ingredients.  I am just amazed that cream cheese is one of the main ingredients!  I think I may try whipped cream cheese next time so that when it cools slightly it may not be so thick.

Loved it. Used 2 tsp minced garlic vs. garlic powder. If not served right away, must add sm amounts of milk often. Wife and kids were wowed with the flavor.

I made this tonight, and it was amazing. My entire family loved it. I did make a few changes. I used minced garlic instead of garlic powder and sauteed it in the butter a bit. I used half and half instead of milk, but I will use milk next time because it was just a bit too rich with the half and half. I also added a pinch of nutmeg. YUM! I'm never going back to the jarred stuff after this.

I gave this recipe a 3 out of 5 because it made a great soup! BUT it NEVER set up. I follow the recipe at written-- didn't change a single thing, but 20 minutes after I finished cooking it the consistency was reminiscent of creamy broccoli (without the broccoli). However it did taste really awesome- so I added some freshly diced chives and tomato and used the small shells pasta- VOILA- alfredo soup! It was really great for a failed then salvaged recipe....but I will have to try this again one day to see if the recipe failed me (which I find hard to believe due to the wonderful reviews) or if it was just me mucking something up. But even when my alfredo turns out great, I love a fresh tomato garnish! If you haven't before give it a try the cold crisp tomatoes give it a good texture balance!

I made this sauce for tonights dinner with bow ties pasta. I thought this recipe was excellent...I pretty much followed the recipe. but instead of 2C milk I used 1 1/2 Cups milk..added extra parmesan cheese than it called for, couple hands full of cheddar cheese, parsley leaves, and cubbed chicken breast...it was so delicious...my husband  loved it. sometimes your own variations make a big difference. Mine did...Thank you...Linda

We really liked it.  Made as written but used "Lite" cream cheese and non-fat milk, only to reduce some calories.  Oh, and I did add some chicken at the end.  Excellent...will make again.

Yumo!! Very good, rich and creamy. I added a little more Parmesan cheese otherwise the dish was terrific! I think I will add steamed broccoli next time! Not bad for quick alfredo when you are in a pinch and have the craving. Its not like true authentic alfredo, but certainly satisfies the craving.

Delicious and perfect as-is in my opinion. Also, if you refrigerate it overnight, it thickens to the texture of a spread and is great on crackers. I am definitely saving this recipe :)

Best (and only) Alfredo Sauce I've ever made! Will definitely be making again. I will never again buy the pre-made alfredo sauce in a jar after trying this. Thanks for the recipe!!

The title says it all, but it could say Quick Easy and Absolutely Delicious Alfredo Sauce.  As others have reported, I used non-fat milk and lite cream cheese and you'd never know.  I've made it twice and it's terrific, last time I added some fresh basil paste, too.

Maybe I did something wrong but this tasted horrible. I could only taste the cream cheese yuck. I followed the directions so I’m not sure what went wrong. I saw all the great reviews but was really disappointed once I tried it. I threw it out and made something else.

Bravo!!!  Quick, easy and delicious!  Used skim milk and 1 full cup fresh grated parm, and always freshly minced garlic, 1 clove.  Served over spinach egg noodles with sautéed shrimp.  Not for those on a diet but great for a reward.  Restaurant quality for sure!

This is THE BEST Alfredo Sauce EVER !!! Even my Italian GF's who swear by the "old" method of heavy cream, etc. etc. have switched.  My other half would eat it every night, if he could. As another reviewer stated... it's creamier, smoother and easier. Absolutely outstanding!

Fantastic!  Made with one cup milk, one cup wipping cream. Added more parmesan to thicken. Added 5 garlic cloves minced.  Made it with spinash ravioli and cooked salmon which was left over from yesterdays dinner.  Salmon was baked using Magic salmon seasoning, squeeze lemonmand sprinkle of basil.  My. Boyfriend raved over it and asked me to keep this recipe to make again.  Very tasty and not that difficult to make.  I supposemyou could make it also with left over chicken as it works as a good base.

Read the reviews, made the some changes, ended up adding Italian seasonings and a little extra salt by the end, but it was delicious! Tossed it over 1 box of cooked penne and it was the perfect amount of sauce. Topped with extra parm. This was how I made it: 1/2 cup butter with 2 cloves minced garlic heated just under medium till melted, added 8oz cream cheese and "whisked" (stirred around) until it became "smooth" (almost like a cottage cheese consistency... it never actually gets "smooth" at this stage), slowly added 1 3/4 cup almond milk and cream and water mixture (mostly cream) because I didn't have straight milk, whisked till smooth, added 1 cup of grated parm (a little more than 6oz) and stirred till melted, added about 1/8 tsp black pepper, 1 tsp of italian seasonings by the end and about 1/2 tsp of salt. Thickened up nicely even after being tossed with pasta. Nom nom nom nom nom.

I made a carbonara on this site last night and the family did not like it....I didn't want to throw it out since ingredients were expensive. So, made the easy alfredo sauce and OMG.....it is delicious on its own but did the miracle of making the left over carbonara into a dish the hubby wanted seconds...Thanks Dawn!

Delicious! Easy and quick, I made it for some frozen cheese raviolis and the sauce was excellent. However I only gave it 4 stars because it was so fattening.

Thank you for this wonderful recipe!! My kids thought this was great, even asked me to make it a regular dinner dish. I loved that it was tasty and easy to make!  I followed the recipe, but had to make some changes due to lack of ingredients on hand.  I used lactose fat free milk,   garlic salt and fresh grated Parmesan. I used this with pasta, but this great Alfredo sauce would be yummy on veggies or in chicken lasagna!  Thanks again!!

This is an excellent easy alfredo.  I wanted a little richer sauce so I substituted 1 c. sour cream + 1 c milk for the 2 c. milk.  Also add parsley and oregano and cooked the sauce in a double broiler.  Easy peezy! Saving this to my recipe box!

This recipe is simply amazing. It takes little time to prepare but is one of the most delicious sauces I have ever ate. I sauteed some Portabella mushrooms and added that to the sauce after. Served over speghetti pasta, it was easily one of the best meals I've had in a while.

I love how easy this recipe is. There would be a few changes I would do. I would use fresh garlic instead of the powder and sautée it with the butter. Plus, I would use more pepper than it asks for. It does have great cheese flavor!

This a great recipe! I double it and keep it in the refigerator.  I keeps forever and comes back with l little heat and added milk. Sometimes when I make it, it doesn't want to mix too easily (maybe my fault). I just pop in a big blender and hit it a good lick and it is a creamy as can be.

This is the best sauce by far!!
To avoid having clumpy cream cheese, I actually just blended all of the ingrediants first, them warmed. It turned out great, and smooth!!!

This recipe allowed me to enjoy an alfredo sauce for the first time in my life.  I used a little less parmesan cheese than the recipe asked for, boyfriend hates parmasan, and bought a herbed dill cream cheese from a local bulk cheese store to use in place of plain cream cheese.

Bravo!  I was looking for a last minute recipe that was delicious.  This fit the bill to a tee.  I had fresh garlic and low fat cream cheese, but that was my only change to this recipe. It was creamy, and delighful and when my 3 boys tasted it, they said it was out of the park.  This is definitely a keeper.  Thanks for sharing!

A big hit with my 4year old as well as my husband! I tried reheated leftovers and they were yummy. It was  really easy to make too...

I made this last night for dinner and it was soooo good!! I did make some changes- I sauted onions and fresh garlic in the butter then followed the steps. I added chicken, bell peppers and cayenne pepper to it for spice and it was a hit!!! I will definitely make this again!

I thought this sauce was MUCH more flavorful than the jar stuff I used to buy.  I only used 1 1/2 C of milk per other reviews, and I still thought it was pretty thin on the stovetop.  Since my husband ended up working late that day, however, I finished it off in the oven and it ended up a little dry.  I think it I were to BAKE it again, I'd use all the recommended milk, but will eyeball it if I make it on the stovetop. It was wonderful flavor though; the butter and garlic were melt in my mouth good!

this was awesome! im only 14 and cant cook well at all! it was easy and fast but good tip for the very beginners like me that timing is everything! i was so enthralled that i could make alfredo sauce that i completly forgot to make pasta and grill the shrimp. the only thing id suggest is adding in more spices like oregano or parsley :)

I wanted to make an alfredo sauce because the stuff in the jar is gross. I saw this one and I thought it would be easy to make. I was a little hesitant because I thought the cream cheese would be kind of weird. 

I did make a few changes to make it lighter: I used fat free cream cheese, light butter, and skim milk. I also used fresh garlic instead of powder. 

It was delicious! I am so glad I found this recipe and anytime I need to make Alfredo Sauce this will be the recipe I use. Thanks!

I needed a gluten free sauce and this worked perfect. I am not a huge fan of Alfredo sauce, but my family is, and I even liked it. We topped with grilled chicken. Next time I will wilt some spinach in the sauce! Thanks for a simple low cost recipe.

I love this recipe!  I can't even list the number of different ways I use it in addition to  alfredo over pasta.  One of my favorites is in a tuna broccoli alfredo casserole that calls for a jar of store bought sauce.  This is so much better!  For those who said it had a "fake" taste, try using a better kind of Parmesan- not the powdered kind in the jar.  Sometimes I used fresh minced garlic as others have done and if I'm in a hurry I used powdered, but either way it is delicious.

I am not a pro in the kitchen, but this easy recipe was fantastic! I can't believe I made it, and it was delicious! I added salmon to the sauce, over fettuccine.  Thank you!

If you follow the recipe exactly, you will end up with a delicious Alfredo Sauce. But this recipe is perfect for 'tweeking' to your liking too. I often add roasted garlic instead of powdered garlic and I use low fat cream cheese - scrumptious!! I also occasionally add some Italian spices like basil and oregano and sometimes parsley. This is just a super easy, super delicious sauce that you can customize to your family's tastes.

I love this sauce!  I have been making it for 3 years!  I came across this recipe and thought that sounds easy and I love cream cheese.  I have made it with powdered Parmesan cheese as well and it still tastes good and is something I usually always have on hand.

This is really easy and delicious, albeit it needs a lot of additional spice to really give it some flavor (in my opinion). I am a huge sucker for Italian food and any kind of pasta in general.  I added a lot more garlic powder, pepper and 21 seasoning salute from Trader Joe's (which is a GREAT blend of spices and I definitely recommend looking into!!) Overall, this is great alfredo sauce and easy to whip up with some vegetables for a quick pasta meal.

Its very good. I used a few cloves of garlic instead of powder and  subbed 3oz of the parmesan cheese for ricotta because I've been trying to use that anywhere I can. Still came out delicious. Thanks

So easy and SO good! I used about 1/2 tbsp. of minced garlic, added when butter was almost melted, and a dash of nutmeg. If you want thick sauce like we do, I'd suggest using about 1/2 the amount of milk...I just whisked in a little at a time until I got it to the consistency I wanted.

three stars because although it was ok, it just didnt wow me or my family. I believe this recipe calls for too much cream cheese. I do like the cream cheese but it was just to much. I also added 2 cups heavy cream but it was just too thick, so I added about a 1/2 cup of milk and that helped. Dont skimp on the parmesan because then the sauce would def. taste just like cream cheese. I also added oregano and more pepper and Im glad I did because with out it, it was just to bland. We have left over sauce so Im gonna tweak it again tonight for left overs.

This sauce is SO good and SO easy to make.  I added 4 cloves of fresh, minced garlic to the butter.  The sauce didn't "come together" until I started adding the milk.  We used this sauce on a homemade chicken, spinach and onion pizza.  YUM!  Thanks for sharing this awesome recipe.

I have never made alfredo sauce before in any form.  This was spectacular!  I think you could pour it over mulch and it would be great!  I followed the recipe exactly and thought it was heavenly.  Thank you for the contribution.  A definite keeper.  Oh, my kids loved it to and I served it over bow tie pasta with mushrooms, red bell pepper and broccoli.  Yum!!

I tried this last night! WOW! Perfect! I used a little less milk and grated cheese in the can as I did not have any fresh and it was just awesome!

After reading the reviews I added the milk a little at a time to get to the right consistency.  I found that adding only 1 & 1/3 to 1 & 1/2 c. of milk was the perfect solution.  That way it was not too thin and not too thick, but nicely coated the pasta. That's the only I'm giving it 4 stars - because I had to make the adjustment to the recipe as written.  Great flavor and really easy.  I also put in some fresh grated nutmeg as I like to do that with cream sauces.  I will definitely be making again, with the reduction of milk, in the future!

I followed the recipe as stated, and it came out too watery.  It did not thicken.  It still tasted good, but I would prefer thicker.

This was the best Alfredo sauce I have ever had! The only thing I added to mine was salt, but my husband loved it just the way it was. Next time I will try it with light or reduced fat cream cheese to cut the fat a little bit. Other posters said it was just as good. Thank you so much for this!!! It was exactly what I was looking for!

Great.  Whole family loved it.  I use 2-3 teaspoons of garlic from a jar and saute it in the butter.  We like more garlic flavor.  Makes a ton of sauce.  Always left overs and I am feeding a family of 10.  Simple and quick for last minute dinners.  Even my kids make it.

When I made this, I did 1.5 times the original recipe. The Parmesan cheese was shredded rather than grated. For the milk, I used 1 pint of whipping cream instead. It came out rich and creamy. It was absolutely delicious and easy to make.

followed exactly (used parmesan in the jar) and it was delicious. Don't give up on it and a whisk is absolutely necessary. Makes more than enough for 1lb. of fettuccine. Reheat with a little milk for leftovers (IF you have any!!) Definitely a keeper.

I really like this version of alfredo. 
I personally feel that it needs a splash of lemon juice to brighten it up. 

I also find that cutting the recipe in half is enough sauce to thoroughly coat 1lb of pasta. 
If you are all about extra sauce then dont cut it in half.

This is the BEST aflredo sauce ever! So simple and easy and easily changed to your liking. I have made it twice already. THe first time I followed the directions only adding a bit of nutmeg and using whole milk. It was excellent and rich. The next time I cut it back to skim milk and was perfect to my family's liking; rich but not overly so and super flavorful. I served over liguine with sauteed chicken. It does make a lot of sauce though, so I had leftovers.

I host various cooking events in my home and used this recipe. My guests were in such ahhhh with this recipe. I did make this recipe twice. The first time was with grated Parm Chz, it came out very gritty. The day of the event, I bought shredded Parm Chz from the deli area, and oh my was it sooo much better. I will continue to make this recipe again and again. Thanks for sharing.

First time I made this ... put too much parmesean and too little milk. Second time around ...used 1 cup parmesean and 2 1/2 cups milk. We are a garlicky family so added a bit more garlic and herb seasoning and a bit of onion powder. Also added bacon bits while it was on the stove.

DON'T forget to use the blender! It makes it sooo much easier! My sister text me and said that she had leftovers the next day for lunch and said it was like "heaven in her mouth" lol. 

Only reason it's a four star is because I tweaked it a bit. But other than that... super fantastic!

I have made Alfredo sauce for years from the packets... went to make dinner tonight and no packets! Jumped on google and this was the first recipe that came up. My family in total liked this sauce better then any I had previously made. One change I made was heavy cream instead of milk. Yum! It was quick, easy and delicious! Thank you! NO MORE PACKETS, EVER!

Tasty! I used light cream cheese, skim milk and replaced about 1/4 of the milk with heavy whipping cream. This will definitely be my go to alfredo sauce from now on!

I used heavy whipping cream instead of milk which made it a little thick but I wanted a richer flavor.  I had to thin it down with 1/2 cut water so I'm not sure if counteracted my attempt.  Turned out great though.  It made a lot.  I think I will cut the recipe in 1/2 next time.   Quick, easy, and very good.

Yum! I liked this recipe because I had all the ingredients already. I made a few modifications and the results were amazing, it was the BEST alfredo sauce I've ever had. First, I like my sauces pretty thick, so I started with a ruex of 1 T butter and 1 T flour. Then I continued the recipe as directed. However, I added a teaspoon of ground nutmeg and the results were out of this world yummy. Seriously DELICIOUS!

Thought this was pretty good- only felt it was "missing" something- garlic & salt- so added more, and was perfect!

I was at home thinking of something good to make in about 10 minutes.  I knew I wanted pasta, but I didn't want just butter or red sauce, so I searched for an easy Alfredo sauce to make.  This one was extremely easy and only took me about 10 minutes to make it!  It didn't look like it would taste good, but I put it on cheese tortellini and it was amazing!!  The only thing that would make it better is if it were creamy-er.  I highly recommend this recipe.

Yum!!!! I only had butter, flour, milk, parm, chicken stock and nutmeg but it was really really good. I used very little parm cheese, just until thickened. I will be making this again! (as soon as I work this meal off!)

I had 30 minutes to prepare a meal and a head of broccoli I needed to use up.  After deciding to make pasta topped with broccoli alfredo, I looked up "quick alfredo sauce" and chose this one.  I have to say, it fit the bill perfectly!  I just happened to have all the ingredients on hand and finished the recipe in time for dinner.  The only thing I would change is the consistency of the sauce that I made... It was a bit runny, and I didn't even use all the milk called for in the recipe.  I think if I hadn't been rushed, though, I could have let it cook longer to thicken it.  Also, I used minced garlic instead of garlic powder because I was out of it.  This is a quick and easy recipe, and I will definitely use it again

This is a very good recipe. I subbed real garlic for the powder and it turned out fantastic. It makes a very rich and creamy sauce. Theres a very very small hint of cream cheese if you know to look for it. Otherwise, you would never know.Not a 5 star recipe but extremely close to it and also better than anything that comes out of a jar by far.

This is fantastic and super easy. I will never buy jarred alfredo sauce ever again and when I order alfredo at restaurants I find myself wondering why I am paying so much for something I could make just as well at home. I do use pressed garlic instead of powdered. I also mix in the parm with the cream cheese before adding the milk and it does make it smoother. Then just add milk to your desired consistency. An A+ recipe! *** Also tonight I made it and mixed in canned crab meat and it was fantastic on fettucini with some diced tomatoes! Yum!

Not exactly gourmet but not bad either.  I tossed it with some linguini, chopped chicken breast and a bag of frozen veggies and we had dinner in 20 mins.  Subbed minced garlic for garlic powder and decreased milk to 1 1/2 cups.

I checked prior reviews, as we all do, and made some of the suggested changes.  Mixed the parmesan in before the milk; used 1 1/3 cup of milk; added onion powder; minced garlic instead of garlic powder and because we like some kick - added cayenne pepper!  Next time, more garlic and cayenne.  GREAT recipe, Dawn.  Everyone has individual tastes and you nailed the perfect "base" recipe to allow anyone to suit to their own preference!  A definite keeper.  Thank you!

easy and tasty!!!!   So much better than the jar of Alfredo sauce that so many recipes call for.  I also like that I can make it richer by adding half and half or tone it down by adding lowfat cream cheese and milk.  Very good - Thanks for sharing

Amazing!  I was a little worried when the melted butter and cream cheese didn't seem to be coming together, but adding the milk made it very creamy.  I used shredded parm instead of grated, and it took a long time for it to melt.  Overall, the time given to make the sauce was a little off (at least for me) but it was well worth it.  We'll definitely make this a regular in our line-up!

I liked it, ready to see what others think tonight. I believe a nice creamy alfredo sauce such as this definitely deserves five stars. Way better than the nasty stuff you can buy in a jar lol.

I really enjoyed this recipe.  It was easy, and fast.  I didn't have all the ingredients, so I used whole milk, and not fresh parm.  It still turned out great, which is a good thing.  I am pregnant, and this is the only thing that sounded edible to me.  I also added shrimp to it.  I definitely will make this again.

Made this recipe tonight and it was a huge hit!  No more jarred sauce for us.  I followed the recipe except for omitting the garlic powder and sauteing a tbs of minced garlic with the butter. 
I am so glad I read the reviews because I would have freaked out at the separated mess the cream cheese and butter made, but it smoothed out beautifully once I added the milk.  I also let the sauce simmer on low while I made the pasta.  It ended up a nice thick garlic sauce.  The husband couldn't taste the cream cheese at all!  Oh and I did use Kraft shredded parmesan & romano cheese in the black can.  Very good!!

I followed the directions, and it turned out perfectly--just the kind of sauce I like: super cheesy!  Mixed the sauce with some chicken, broccoli, and pasta and it was delicious!

This is super-quick and tasty. I added extra garlic because we love garlic.  I didn't add as much milk; I'd guess it was approx 1 1/2 cups or so. Thank you!

We really enjoyed this recipe. It wasn't bland at all, like alfredo sauce can sometimes be. I used a clove (or two) of fresh garlic instead of the powder. I used 2% milk because it's all we buy so I did end up having to dissolve a little cornstarch (about a tbsp) in a little milk (just enough to dissolve the cornstarch) and added it. It thickened right up. I also used low fat cream cheese and 6 cheese italian blend. It was yummy! I served grilled chicken over it and added some sweet cherry tomatoes (halved) and summer squash, both of which I had sauted in EVOO until tender. Excellent meal!

Thanks so much for this recipe! I saw the melted butter and thought "oil!" so I substitued half of the butter for olive oil. The second time I made it I used all olive oil minus 1 TB of butter and it still tastes great. I might switch back and forth between varying amounts of butter knowing I can make it lighter or more buttery when I want to. i used this in an Olive Garden dish I was mimicking: Carbonara! (bacon, pasta, chicken or shrimp). Love this sauce.

I'll never buy a jar of this again.  This was easy and wonderful.  I most of the time add fresh mushrooms and sundried tomatoes, and maybe some red pepper flakes.  Just to give it some extra umpf. Still this was a very good base recipe.

I made this one night for my wife when we were pretty much tired of regular spaghetti sauce. Now she won't stop asking for it! She says it's even better than the jar sauce!

One thing we do is use I Can't Believe It's Not Butter, Fat Free Cream Cheese, and Skim Milk in order to eliminate a lot of the fat. Surprisingly, it still comes out the same!

This is a  good for a quick Alfredo but doesn't taste authentic nor like a restaurant, but it is very good.  For more flavor I used cayenne pepper and added some fresh basil. I also used half the amount of butter because this recipe is fatty

I first found this recipe in 2003 and made it exactly as the recipe states.  I thought it was great! Easy and very tasty.  I made it again today as is and just as always it is great as is. 
 
If you are having trouble with it being too thin or are having other problems consider the ingredients you used (such as low fat, no fat ingredients or grated Parmesan cheese vs the powdered kind in a bottle, or even margarine instead of butter) these can make a huge difference in your recipe.  Use REAL ingredients and you will be happy with the results, this is obviously not a low cal, low fat recipe nor should it be and is GREAT as is.

Excellent basic recipe.  Used light cream cheese and sauce was a great consistency. As a variation  puréed 1 can of chipotle peppers in adobo sauce and added 3 tsp of the paste to the sauce.

I made this with chunked ham, tricolor pasta and peas (I like them mixed in). My whole family gobbled this up! I am not sure if this is any cheaper than jarred alfredo sauce, but it sure is yummier!!! I only used half of the recipe for the 17+oz bag of pasta I cooked. Will use that soon. No more jars for us!!!

I did not like this dish at all.  Cooked to instructions and only added a little extra garlic and pepper for flavor; but in the end it had only one STRONG taste. Cream Cheese.  For whatever reason it had the consistence of a nice garlic parmesan cream cheese on a bagle.  Moist and eaten all at once...   It had good initial flavor.  Would recommend cutting the amount of cream cheese to half serving....  has promise.. but needs a little mellowing in my opinion.

This recipe would be hard to beat...and of course, you can add ANYTHING to the top (though unnecessary, it's great as the recipe reads) - broccoli, bacon pieces, sauteed mushrooms...goes on and on. Very good. Thank you.

Fantastic alfredo sauce!I used two tsp of minced garlic instead of powder and I let the cream cheese soften and ripped it up into chunks. After adding the milk, it took about 5-10 minutes to thicken.I put in parmesan till it didn't taste so cream-cheesy & I also added a pinch of dried oregano and salt. Used this in a seafood alfredo, everyone went back for seconds :)

Loved the flavor! Compliments from all the 3 of my children, which is hard to do.  A little more time consuming than I realized since I added the cheese in slowly.  I'm sure with practice, I'll be more efficient.  Definitely try again.

While there is nothing quite like authentic homemade alfredo, this recipe is perfect for a weeknight meal. It's so quick and delicious! I try to use roasted garlic, if I have time, and more parm cheese. I also add chicken or seafood and broccoli.

This recipe was so easy to make and tasted great.   I will never buy Alfredo sauce in the store now that I know how easy it is to make.  Just add some grilled chicken, cooked spinach, mushrooms... perfect!  If I had bacon that would top it off perfectly.

Delicious!! I followed the recipe pretty much exactly, and it came out great. Thanks to this recipe, I also learned to substitute cream cheese + water when I don't have heavy cream on hand. Thank you!!

Very good! I thought the cream cheese taste was a little strong, so next time I will use less cream cheese and more Parmesan. The amount of sauce was perfect for 1 lb of pasta.

I have never made Alfredo Sauce before. This was the BEST I have ever tasted. It was easy, fast and so delicious. The only thing bad about it is that it did not fit in well with my new diet. However, if you are doing Weight Watchers, 1/2 cup of this sauce is only 9 points and well worth ever drop!

Really good. I love the cream cheese. It makes a very creamy sauce. Unfortunately, as most cream sauces are, it is hard on the stomach.

After making this, I would never buy jar sauce again!  The flavor was incredible!  The only change I made was to use 4 cloves of real garlic because we love garlic!  Very easy and quick to make.  A definite keeper!

I must say that I did make a few changes to this when it came to the measurements and used freshly minced garlic instead of powder.  My 13 yr old daughter attempted this one time and it just did not work.  A little skeptical to try this again, I did because I had all of the ingredients, but so glad I did... This sauce turned out perfect!  I found that if you cubed the cream cheese and cut the butter into pads, adding all ingredients in the sauce pot and have this on just above low, once they were about 1/2 way melted started whisking until smooth... everything came together wonderfully!  Thank you for sharing!

Tasted good, easy to make. We used powdered (in the green bottle) parmesean and it probably would have turned out thicker if we used grated. A tad rich because of the cream cheese, but still very good! We put mixed  veggies and chicken in it, turned out very nice; cut down on the richness.

Very good!

very good, creamy and EASY !  i used LOW FAT ingredients like lite cream cheese and fat free half and half instead of milk.   Reheats very well, too...does not "break".   Added what I had on hand to this : grilled chicken, mushrooms and baby peas.  I will definitely make this again.

For an alfredo that will leave you feeling less guilty, I make a recipe like this, but substitute with margerine, skim milk, and fat free cream cheese. My boyfriend can't get enough of it!

I read a few poor reviews and was worried, but all for naught.  This was DELICIOUS, exceeds most restaurant quality sauces in my opinion.  I put the sauce over angel hair pasta and added added lemon pepper seasoned chicken and broccoli florets.  I did use a bit less milk, as 2 full cups makes it rather thing.  The dash of oregano & nutmeg really added depth to the sauce like others have suggested.  I will never use another jar of crappy alfredo sauce again with all the preservatives.  This was just superb...will definitely be making again when I can afford to splurge on my diet!

Quick, easy, and surprisingly tasty! A must try for cream cheese lovers. I will say that when mixing the butter and cream cheese I thought it was going to be bad; The cream cheese did not smooth out until I added the milk and parmesan. But like others have said, I was licking it off the spoon!

For some reason, mine turned out salty (perhaps the mixture of margarine I used and the Parmesan cheese).  Overall, the flavors were okay, but I wouldn't say this was anything spectacular.

Wonderful!!! this is so good and so easy! I've made other Alfredo recipes from this site, but this is by far the best!!! I made mine for a party. I took the advice of other AR cooks and made the base the day before. Right before my party, I added the Parm cheese and added chicken (I cooked previously as well).  It was delicious. I'm not a huge garlic fan so I used a little less. Also, some people commented on the cream cheese flavor...I didn't tast it at all.

Is it something you will find at a  5 star Italian restaurant? No

Is it better then the store bought jars? YES!

So easy to make and so good my picky kids loved it as they dont like the jarred sauces.
I added a little more garlic and spinach to the sauce yum will be making again!

The only thing I did differently to the recipe was to add a little cayenne. My husband didn't really care for it too much. I think it was because I was unable to get the butter to blend very well with the cream cheese and it seemed like the noodles were sitting  in butter. I'm not a very experienced cook so it's very possible it was me and not the recipe. Not bad overall, but would use less butter if I made this again.

This was a pretty good alfredo sauce.  It was a little stringy though, but I think that is because I put in too much cheese.  I used the grated kind in the bag, not that powder stuff in a can, so that might have been why.  Next time I'd put in 4oz like the other reviewers recommended.  I used fat free cream cheese and skim to cut down on calories.  I used minced garlic since I like it better.  It tasted good but next time I'll put in more since I like a garlic-y alfredo.

used whipping cream instead of milk because it was what I had on hand and it worked out great! We also used fresh garlic instead of the garlic powder and just browned it in the butter. DELICIOUS! Quick and easy. Who could ask for more?!

This was very good, although it was less 'creamy' than I was hoping and the parmesan still felt a little grainy, even after thorough cooking. In the pan, the sauce looked very watery. Once it got on the pasta, though, it thickened up much more than I had expected...put more on than you think! I agree with other reviewers, this makes a lot of sauce; half this recipe was comfortably enough for 3 people. Overall satisfying on many levels; easy, inexpensive, quick, and tasty!

I  followed the recipe exactly and the flavor turned out great! I did not have the problem of too much cream cheese flavor like others. However, it was too thin. I should have added smaller amounts of milk at a time to make sure not too thin it out. It did not thicken up after standing or reheating (I ended up adding a little flour and it was good enough) A little less milk and it would have been perfect!

My newly pregnant daughter is starting to have cravings - when she requested pasta with alfredo sauce, I turned straight to allrecipes and this was the first one to pop up. It was very easy to make, EXTREMELY tasty, and pleased the pregnant daughter immensely.  I used fresh minced garlic instead of garlic powder, however, since I don't usually keep garlic powder in the house...

VERY easy and tastes amazing!  MUCH better than any jar Alfredo.  I used this recipe to make a casserole, so added about 1/2 cup to a cup more milk before putting it in the oven.  It came out just perfect--not too soupy.

Pretty good for an easy alfredo- a few notes however:  1) it makes a ton of sauce!  For 2-4 people I would halve the recipe.  2) Also, I read some earlier reviews and added crushed garlic (not power) and some salt. 3) I also used skim milk and it was still a pretty good consistency. 4) I would also double the black pepper.  Overall, easy and quick!  Great with shrimp and pasta.

this sauce is simply AMAZING. each time I use this to make chicken fettuccine alfredo I am asked for the recipe. As a tip though I'd recommend using heavy cream instead of the milk to get a silky texture, which is what I do. If done this way then the butter can be omitted as well

Consistency was great.  Lacked a little taste; maybe needed another spice or more pepper.  Will make again and try with some pesto for a creamy pesto sauce.

Five stars for quick and easy! I thought the sauce turned out great. The only thing I changed is to add more pepper and use fresh garlic sauted in the butter, instead of garlic powder. Thanks for sharing.

Definitely use less milk if you like your alfredo thick.  I typically make this with 1 1/2 to 1 3/4c milk and add both garlic powder and fresh minced garlic.

After reading reviews I melted 1/2 cup of butter with a grated large clove of garlic (little kids don't like chunks of garlic) added the cream cheese and melted it down (all on low) added 1 1/3 cup of milk then 4oz Parmesan and pepper.  This was AMAZING and so easy!  Will make this again and again.  I also made blackened chicken to put on top of the pasta and sauce.  YUMMY!  Kids loved this too.

So easy, so good! My whole family (including 2 picky kids) love this! I follow the recipe, but add a little extra cream cheese and a little salt. We like to top it with crumbled bacon. Not exactly diet friendly- but delicious!

Fantastic! We made this in two foods classes I teach. Couldn't get enough of it. The cream cheese takes a while to melt; be patient, when you stir in the milk it will eventually turn creamy and delicious. Yumm!!

I tried making it as was directed, but  couldn't get the melted butter and cream cheese to cream together.  They separated.  Did anybody else have the same problem? Well, looking at this soup of butter and goo of cream cheese, I was kind of glad that it didn't work out - that's a LOT of butter AND cream cheese! - can't be good for anybody's artery.....  I ended up making a simple garlic-olive oil sauce for my pasta.  I don't think I would try this recipe again.  Sorry.......

For a quick prep at home sauce, this is excellent. Taste wise, it is far better than the store bought sauces. I personally had a little trouble smoothing out the globs of cream cheese, it is still a good recipe though!

Very easy.....a little salty for my taste so I added some basil and thyme to cut the salty taste.  Maybe unsalted cream cheese.

We love this recipe!! The cream cheese makes such a wonderful CREAMY alfredo sauce. So often the jar sauces get absorbed too quickly by the noodles but not this sauce.

this is what i wanted, i did not want cream or nutmeg in mine. However, i could tell it would be too runny, so i used 3 8o pkgs of cream cheese, & kept the same amount of milk, and added a dash of white wine & extra fresh parmesan.  mmmmmmmmmmmm

I really enjoyed this sauce although I did tweek the recipe. I used one cup milk and one cup cream. I also used half a can of grated parmesan as well as some 'real' shredded parmesan (I don't know how much cause I usually just go by the taste of things). Make sure to add a dash (and I mean a dash) of nutmeg as it really completes the sauce. Served with fettucini noodles along side chicken florentine. Supurb!

This Alfredo sauce had pretty good flavor but it never seemed to thicken up enough for me.  It was pretty runny.  This recipe is definitely something you could work with though and make your own.

This is a good recipe for easy alfredo. I used can't believe it's not butter, fat free milk, and low fat cream cheese. I tried to use my regular recipe for alfredo sauce(it calls for heavy cream) and use the fat free milk...it did not work. This recipe turned out GREAT! My family prefers the original alfredo sauce but to this is really good without all the fat and calories.  Used the sauce over chicken (no pasta) and it served 7 adults and 1 child.

We make this all of the time, but I hate to use a stick of butter so I now use almost a cup of chicken broth or almost a cup of water and almost a teaspoon of chicken boullion granules.  My family loves it this way, and I feel better about eating it!  I also usually add a little red pepper.  (Just noticed, my recipe only calls for 1 cup of milk, and 3/4 c. parmesan.)  Play with it, it's a great start!!

I found this recipe to be very easy to make. I served it over spinach ravioli that was bought at Costco and it tasted delicious!   Some additions/modifications I made: - Substitute Asiago cheese for the Parmesan because I find Parmesan doesn't melt all that well. I actually found Asiago cheese with Rosemary at Trader Joes for a reasonable price  - Add 1/4 cup wine to spruce up the taste  - substitute low-fat cream cheese  - substitute milk for 1/2 & 1/2  - substitute 2 cloves of garlic for garlic salt

WOW! I followed the recipe completely, except I added all the milk at one time, which didn't change a thing. The sauce was perfect. I give it a perfect 5/5!

This made more than I needed, so I froze what I didn't use and saved it for a future meal.  It was in good shape a month later.  I would add a bit more salt or something - I thought it was a bit bland.  Thanks!

I followed the suggestions given by Reg927.  I let the butter and cream cheese come to room temperature. Then I whipped them together in a bowl before adding them to the saucepan, because I wasn't sure how the cream cheese would melt into the sauce.

It was amazing. I used half grated Parmesan and half shredded 6 cheese Italian. It was still a little thin at the end still, so I added about 1/2 to 3/4 cup more shredded cheese and whisked it in while the sauce was still hot but not on the heat. To. Die. For.

I was very excited about making this sauce after so many great reviews.  Adjustments made were to use 1 cup milk, 1 cup half-n-half, added nutmeg and oregano.  Taste was OK.  My son said it tasted like Olive Garden alfredo sauce.  I don't care for Olive Garden but he does so I took it as a compliment.  My only trouble was in melting the parm cheese.  I had to stir and raise heat to 7 in order to heat it up enough to melt.  My whisk had clumps of cheese at the bottom as I stirred.  I gradually poured the sauce over the pasta, and then would go back and stir some more, pour out some, stir some more until it went from lumpy to stringy to smooth.  Flavor was mild and good.  Absolutely nothing wrong with this sauce, but I don't think it's exactly what I'm looking for.  It needs something more, but I don't know what.

I made this sauce and OMG!!! I didn't use any milk...I used chicken broth(I didn't measure, just used enough to keep the sauce from thickening too much!!) and minced garlic...it was DELIOUS!!! My children ate it and my husband was please as well.  This recipe will stay on top of the others from now on. You will have to adjust accordingly for more company.  This recipe makes enough for my family but any more than 4 you would need to make adjustments.

Love this...Thanks! I used minced garlic instead of powder,Low calorie milk and Non fat cream cheese. It was great. Next time I would use at least 1 tsp. of salt. Plenty of sauce (will feed more than 4).

This was delicious. My family adored it. My mother was surprised when she saw me using cream cheese in a savory sauce. I added various spices to taste but I tasted the original result first. I will definitely make this again!

Absolutely delicious! I've made alfredo sauce before but this one so easy to make, and the consistency came out creamy, velvety and smooth. The cream cheese didn't overpower at all, and all the flavors blended in nicely. I did make some changes, and added minced garlic and a dash of nutmeg and some crushed red pepper flakes to give it a nice kick!

This is a great quick and delicious recipe. I especially like the fact that you can use milk instead of cream because cream can get expensive. This cooked very well for me. I used it for shrimp alfredo and the only thing i did differently was add about a teaspoon of salt and an extra teaspoon of garlic powder. Thanks!

best alfredo sauce i've made yet! note: it definitely helps to add the parmesan cheese in the beginning with the cream cheese and garlic powder, that way you dont get that gritty texture at the end.

My husband absolutely HATES cream cheese. But I convinced him to try it, and he loved it. Thick and creamy!

Made this as is, and it was excellent. I would still however like it to have more flavor. I don't know what to put into it to make it better though. Maybe more Parmesan? I might look at the other Alfredo recipes and put something together.

Excellent! I will definitely be making again .. especially since my husband and I are low carbing it. I will be low carbing forever since I have had the Duodenal Switch weight loss surgery.  My husband is on board to do Low Carb diet and has already lost 8 lbs! Here are the Changes I made: I DID use the REAL stick BUTTER , not margarine I used Spreadable Whipped Cream Cheese (All I had on hand) I used 1 cup Half & Half and 1 cup milk instead of the two cups of milk (to reduce carbs) To reduce carbs even more I could have used two cups half and half but I didn't want to use up all my half and half that I need in the morning for my coffee LOL. I used the Kraft REAL grated Parmesan cheese that comes in the plastic shaker tube thing. I did not use 6 ounces. I used less .. about 4. When I placed 6 ounces of the cheese on my scale it was a HUGE pile and the smaller amount seemed fine. It takes a long time to melt the real harder pieces of parmesan grated cheese. They take forever to melt .. but patience is KEY.  Because you don't want to boil it or the milks can curdle.  The sauce was SO SCRUMPTIOUS. Smooth. RICH. Too bad I can't have it over pasta LOL since I am watching my carbs right now.  They do make Dreamfields low carb pasta but I am not sure I trust that it is Truly low carb. Ha Ha Doesn't matter.. we serve this on Chicken and vegetables! You can spoon this stuff over lots of things: even over Scrambled eggs with diced up veggies in the scrambled eggs!! Eggs Alfredo LOL

Great! Very tasty! Tasted excatly like the cream version I normally would make, but with out the nasty overly full-galbladder attacks that would follow! LOL! I've been trying to find one that was different & this is it! Next I'm trying it with a reduced fat cream cheese I'm sure it will taste excellent. Thanks for a better -less belly upsetting- recipe!

Great recipe.  I tried it with 1 cup buttermilk, 1 cup milk and added fresh-pressed garlic in place of garlic powder.  Also added some oregano and a dash of italian seasoning.  Probably didn't use enough parmesan (ran out of it) and most of the butter used was unsalted.  Still tasted mighty fine!  :)

If I could I would give it a 4 for flavor and a five for being so easy, but I can fix the flavor- more garlic more garlic. Really this was a great alfredo. I had my concerns when I mixed the cream cheese with the butter, it did not look like it was going to come together but you just have to keep stirring and give the cream cheese time to soften and melt. I used this for some ravioli with a big salad and crusty bread and it was great. It did make alot though and I had enough to use later in the week with macaroni, left over chicken and broccoli. Big hit with my 2 1/2 year old.

Excellent and resturant quality. Here is what I did differently: I had some extra heavy whipping cream left over from the crab soup I made so I used half milk (skim) and half cream. I also didn't have enough cream cheese, I did have some neufchatel cheese so I used it too. (Again, half cream cheese and the other half nuefchatel.) I also used 2 cloves garlic, not garlic powder. Then I added a splash of basil. I threw in some scallops with butter and garlic in a pan and seared each side for a couple of minutes. I topped each plate of fettucine with a couple scallops and a splash of parsley and served it. Everyone loved it. Great!!!

Definitely lives up to its title as being quick and easy.  I combined several of the reviewer suggestions and added: 1 tsp oregano, 1 tsp parsley, doubled the black pepper to 1/4 tsp, used a few dashes of nutmeg and used fresh garlic in the butter, but still I think it needs a few dashes of cayenne or more of all those seasonings for zip.  I also sauteed in olive oil in a separate pan: more fresh garlic, chopped onion, 3/4 lb. shrimp, and a cup of coarsely chopped spinach which I stirred into the sauce and pasta.  I used this sauce over 1 lb. of linguine, but using 1 1/2 lbs. pasta would have been a better amount.  Overall the sauce has a bland flavor, but you can add various things to make it more interesting.  Definitely earns points in the quick and easy category, but get creative with add-ins to make it really good.

This was pretty good but definitely use fresh garlic over powdered! I found the same thing as another reviewer - the butter and cream cheese didn't mix together very well until I added milk, then it became smooth. I used the leftover filling from Mouth-Watering Stuffed Mushrooms for this, which had one clove of garlic in it, and I added 2 more but could have done with even more. Great idea and very fast - thank you!

I have fixed this multiple times and can never get it to thicken and I followed the directions exactly. However, the flavor more than makes up for it being a bit runny. We just eat it with a spoon! :)

This was a great sauce! After reading other reviews I melted the butter with crushed garlic and then added the cream cheese. I then added fresh grated Parmesan and only about 1 1/4 cups of milk. I also added some sea salt with the black pepper and served it tossed with tortellini, veggies and chorizo. It was a big hit with my family!

Not great, but pretty good.  This doesn't exactly taste like the real thing, but it's pretty good stuff and I rarely have the ingredients for the real thing anyway.  I used it on the typical fetuccini.  I used 2 oz. pasta per serving, but really this was enough sauce for 3 oz per serving (i.e. 12 total) - and that's even considering I like a high sauce to pasta ratio.  I guess that's my long way of saying it's more than 4 servings.

I have made this several times already and the whole family is crazy about it! I even entered into a cooking contest using it over these great chicken rolls that I found on here, that are more like spinach stuffed chicken, and took 1st place! I use half garlic salt and half garlic powder as we like the flavor and saltiness of it. Since I found this recipe no one wants to eat italian at an restaurant anymore. It is worth it to be slow about getting the ingredients mixed and melted just right as the ending result is sooooo rewarding. And I use my stainless steel pans and they never burn or anything you just have to know how to control the temperature. For those who said this was mediocre and a waste of time, you obviously have missed something or are used to that nasty grocery-store jar sauce. This is just like the sauce from our local Italian hot spot. A-mazing! Thanks so much!

I have never been able to find a store-bought alfredo sauce that I like, but this was AMAZING!  And really easy and fast to make.  My husband and 2 year old love it too.  I've now made it about a dozen times and have never had a problem getting it to turn out perfect every time.  I now even use fat free cream cheese and half the butter and it still turns out perfect.  I've also started adding about 1/4 cup of white wine while cooking and I really like the taste of it.  We serve it with chicken marinated in italian dressing and fettucine noodles.  Thanks for the great recipe!

I fixed this alfredo sauce for an italian themed holiday party for my husband's company's board of directors.  They absolutely loved it.  I used skim milk and it was a hit.  My 16 year old loves fettucine alfredo and this is by far the easiest and tastiest recipe.  Thanks so much for sharing!!

I tried this with great success after reading the reviews and making the following changes:  1 1/3 cups of milk, 1/3 C butter, 1 clove of garlic, minced.  I added oregano and a couple grates of nutmeg at the very end.  Make sure you add the milk in small increments and whisk it as you go. Great recipe, Dawn!  Thanks!

This sauce was really good but nothing special. I have used other recipes on this site before that I think I like better. However like I said it was very good and would make again. I like how few ingredients you need for this recipe. I used a little more cheese then called for and added nutmeg. I think if I make this again I will use half milk and half and half or whipping cream to thicken it up so I dont have to use so much cheese.

Who knew an alfredo sauce could be so quick, easy, and oh-so good?!! I even used skim milk and reduced fat cream cheese. It took a while for mine to thicken, so I added a little more parmesan cheese. You can switch up the variations with this sauce...add grilled chicken, or better yet chicken and spinach (10 oz frozen package, thawed and drained) with the noodles for an awesome Chicken Florentine:)

This has got to be the BEST alfredo ever!  I have made it for my family several times now, and have never had any left over.  Everyone who has tried it LOVED it.  Definitately a keeper, thanks for the money saver!

Simple & easy!  Everyone enjoyed this dish.  I used low fat cream cheese & 1% milk, also used fresh minced garlic.  I had some left over spinach that I added as well.

This was very good and easy, even though I had a hard time getting it to thicken up, flavor was still good.  I added a bit of nutmeg.

Overall a good recipe.  Will make again, but will experiment with adding Romano cheese as well as minced garlic instead of the powder. This recipe seems to be missing something, but I just can't figure it out.

This sauce is really delicious and easier than any Alfredo sauce I've ever made. I did, however, make one substitution - I used mascarpone instead of cream cheese to avoid that tangy cream cheese flavor. Everyone loved it and I will definitely make this again.

This was an easy recipe. My kids LOVED it!! I could taste the cream cheese but no one else mentioned it so it's my little secret ;) Thanks will be making this again. I added more Parmesan cheese Double the amount.

I followed another reviewer's advice and added tsp minced garlic and reduced milk to 1 1/3 cups and parmesan to 4 oz (good thing - only had 4!). When whisking the cream cheese into the butter I did panic at first. It was VERY lumpy and didn't look like it would smooth out. Even though it said "until smooth" I didn't think it was smooth. The cream cheese just wouldn't incorporate totally with the butter. It almost looked like curdled milk. So I just added the milk anyways a little at a time. The more milk I added, the smoother it became. It wasn't lumpy at all and was quite yummy. The whole family agreed!  Oh and I also added about a Tbsp of dried parsley near the end too - just for a bit more flavor and color.  Definitely recommend and will make again!

It is a bit different than traditional Alfredo sauce...definitely has a slight cream cheesy taste, but wonderfully creamy.  I do not think it any easier than making a traditional roux Alfredo.  I did add a t. minced garlic to the butter (I used real butter), used 1 1/3 c 2% milk, a little less than 1/2 a container of Parmesan cheese (all I had) and S/P.  All these changes were based on the review written by Reg927.  I did also add pumpkin spice because at that very moment I realized we were out of nutmeg!!  I used this Alfredo with the Lasagna Alfredo Roll-Ups (AR).  My family thought the entire dish was wonderful!  Though, my 18 month old didn't have anything to do with the dish.  The whisk is a must!  Do have patience and just when you think the sauce is looking meek, grainy, separating and not coming together nicely...whala!  It'll all come together and be perfect!  Keep over medium heat.  Don't rush it!

FANTASTIC ALFREDO SAUCE. Its very hard to find a good alfredo sauce and the jar stuff is disgusting, but this one was delicious. I used half &half rather than milk for a more creamy sauce and it was wonderful!

Bring sauce to a boil, quickly lower the heat and then serve immediately.  My issue was that I could not get the sauce to thicken up all that much, but as soon as I boiled it and then reduced the heat, that did the trick!  Also, if you want to add spinach, I bought the green giant frozen package of 10 oz spinach, cooked in the microwave, squeezed out the juice (use gloves, it'll be hot...), and stirred in with the sauce before bringing it to a boil.  Stick with the recipe when it comes to the milk: 2 cups is plenty, just be sure to have all of your 'before' ingredients nice and smooth (the butter, cream cheese) BEFORE adding the milk, otherwise you will end up with a clumpy mess.  Also, if you want to save any of the sauce, spoon out what you want to eat and then pour the rest into a jar/container right away, otherwise it will be very thick and hard to get out of the pan!  Hope this helped, Thanks for a great recipe!

The most amazing sauce!!  It made more than 4 servings, but that is fine with me, I just froze it!   It was creamy, and just velvety.  Its important to make sure the cream cheese is warmed and it will incorporate with the butter much easier!    I definitely will pass this on to all my friends!!

This was wonderful!! I followed the recipe EXACTLY except that I added some parsley and a pinch of basil. My husband pan-seared chicken strips in an Italian seasoning blend and it was the perfect compliment to the sauce. Much better than store bought, and almost as good as Olive Garden at a fraction of the cost!. Make sure you add the milk AND Parmesan cheese very slowly. I will definitely make this again.

Great recipe!  Very easy to make.  I cut it in half without any difficulties.  I didn't have garlic powder, but used a garlic salt grinder instead and it tasted great.  I used it with shrimp and pasta with diced red peppers, portabeo mushrooms and onions.  Yummm.

This is an excellent recipe. I didn't change much but I use 2 containers of the whipped cream cheese with chives and it is delicious. I also use the Janes meal makers chicken for a very quick and delicious dinner for the family.

I give this five stars for flavor (after mod.):***** I give it three stars for directions:***  I used fresh garlic instead of powder.  The flavor was awesome!  It took a very long time for in to thicken.  I think this recipe should call for fresh parmesan, because the Kraft never really "melted" into the mixture. It left for a strange texture, although very tasty.  Next time I will use 1/3 cup butter, 2 1/2 cups milk, FRESH parmesan, of course fresh garlic, and will remember to prepare to cook for quite some time.

Very good, but for how fattening it is, it better be.

This is very good.  The only issue is , although I rarely salt this dish for some reason this receipe needed lots of salt. I used  1 C. half and half and ! C.milk.

This is my new alfredo sauce.  Others require much more time and this was a huge hit with all my kids from 3 to 17 and my husband is still telling me how much he loved it.  Its a keeper. Thank you for sharing.

This sauce was amazingly tasty. Like a few of the others, I changed it slightly. I used fresh minced garlic instead of the powder, 1 part whipping cream to 3 parts milk, and added a dash of nutmeg. It was absolutely delicious!

My 11 year old loves to cook. She made this to go over pasta and we both loved it! We used light cream cheese and skim milk to make a little healthier. It will be a keeper for both our recipe files!

Decided to try this since I had all the ingredients for it, and man, am I glad I did! Super delicious, and super easy! They only thing I changed was adding the parmesan at the same time as the cream cheese and garlic, as one reviewer had suggested. I served over pasta noodles, grilled chicken strips and broccoli/cauliflower/carrot medly. So good, thanks!

Added a medium chopped onion, some sliced mushrooms, and fresh garlic to the butter. Once the onion was translucent, I added the cream cheese, 1 1/2 cups milk, 1/2 cup of half and half, and the parmesan. To make it more of a meal I mixed in a frozen package of spinach (cooked and strained) and about 2 cups of chopped ham that was leftover from Christmas. Tossed in the pasta and we had a delicious one pan dinner!

For a homemade sauce, this is quick, easy and tasty! And the only things I did different was to use fresh garlic instead of powdered and added a dash of nutmeg. The only reason why I didn't give this five stars was the whole stick of butter! It makes it taste good but, holy moly! The coronary! :o)

Have been making it this way for years and my entire family loves! You can take away some calories without reducing flavor by using lowfat parmesan cheese and lowfat cream cheese. I also add a couple teaspoons of Italian Seasonings for good flavor.

This was easy and tasted ok.  I am a salt freak so I had to add alot and the garlic powder wasn't enough garlic flavor for me.  I did add some extras to this recipe.  (shrimp, sun dried tomatoes, red pepper).  Overall was easy and good.

We tried this for dinner tonight...what a great sauce! Creamy, though I added a lot of garlic since we love garlic! I used lowfat evaporated milk, and half the cheese called for. Easy, yummy, and a sure hit!  Thanks for a great recipe.

I have a 6 year old and 12 year old who want to eat at Olive Garden every time we ask where we're going for dinner.  They love this recipe and beg for it weekly.  I had been using a different recipe that called for heavy cream, but found that the cream was not only more expensive, but left a filmy texture when eating it.  We don't notice the separating of the butter as much with this recipe, and I use real butter.  Overall for the ease in cooking, the handiness of the ingredients and the taste, it's definitely one of the top 5 in my recipe collection.

Wonderful alfredo sauce!  My husband and I absolutely love this recipe.  It is so quick and easy and never turns out bad.  If we have fresh garlic on hand we swap a clove or two for the garlic powder.  I normally will use 1 cup of half-and-half and 1 cup low-fat milk.  This is delicious time and time again!

We make this all the time, its the only way I make Alfredo now.  I have followed the recipe 100% and sometimes I like to deviate a bit and toss in some basil or other spices to be different.  Hands down though, this recipes is fantastic!

This is an incredible recipe! My girlfriend and I decided to add a drizzle and serve it to both of our families. We heated Balsamic Vinegar and Sugar in a saucepan until it was like a light syrup and drizzled it over each plate we served. It added a sweet taste to the Alfredo sauce and is now a family favorite! Thank you Dawn!

This sauce tastes just as good with low fat cream cheese and is a bit healthier.  Reduced fat milk can also be used.

I made a few changes to "zest" up this recipe to our liking.  I used light cream cheese and included 2tbsp. Ricotta cheese.  The slightly-granular flavor adds to the texture and taste.  At the end, I added a handful of scallions and one finely diced green chile--gives this kick!

I made this recipe for dinner tonight for my family and we all loved it.  I hadn't made alfredo for a while so it was nice to have it again.  This recipe was very simple and I was fortunate to have all of the ingredients on hand.  The only addition I made was to add crumbled bacon bits when I tossed the pasta with the sauce.  Thanks for sharing the recipe, Dawn!

The flavor profile for this dish was spot on!  I just added a few extra touches and have one recommendation.  Use freshly grated Parmesaen!!!  I used the shredded cheese in a bag and it did not melt properly leaving the sauce delicious but lumpy.  Use the fresh stuff!  I sauteed chicken, mushrooms and asparagus and added once the sauce was complete.  The dish was a success at my house.  I would definitely make it again.

I used margarine as this is what I had on hand, and light cream cheese. Very easy to make and my son the pasta king wants me to make it again as it is very good

Delicious...I used fat free cream cheese, butter, and fat free milk. I also used about 1/3 a cup of half and half and 2 cloves of garlic fresh pressed. The sauce came out creamy and delicious...perfect! The cream cheese and butter don't blend at first but when you add the milk it gets very creamy and smooth :)

This is definitely quick and easy and way better than any store bought brand, even the pricey ones. Still not 'real' alfredo. My parmesan clumped a little, maybe my sauce was too hot when I added it?  Otherwise, the flavor was great and I will try this again.  I did use fresh garlic added to the butter and some fresh basil at the end, a very good versatile recipe.

Excellent! I followed the great advice of another reviewer. I used 2 cloves of minced garlic and mixed that in with the butter. I also used 1 1/3 cups milk, 1/2 container parm. cheese, black pepper, a few grinds of sea salt, and oregano. SUPERB! I will never have to buy that nasty jar alfredo again! I've been looking for something this good for a LONG time and I LOVE it! I added grilled chicken and broccoli - mmmmm.

I was really excited about making this, but it did not end up as I hoped. I followed the recipe and took other people's suggestions on how to make it better, but it was still not what I wanted. Maybe it was the cheese I used.....

I am so glad I found this recipe!  I read a few reviews and here's what I came up with:  I used low-fat butter and cream cheese, added 2 cloves of minced garlic, 1 tsp oregano.  Tip: let the cream cheese sit out awhile so it will melt easier in pan.  I served it with pasta twists and cooked chicken and it was absolutely delicious!  I will be making it again and will add broccoli florets next time.  I'm already looking forward to it.

I thought this recipe was okay, but lacked flavor. I added 1 crushed garlic and minced basil. My hubby didnt care too much for this recipe either. It tasted too much like cream cheese, than an alfredo sauce. But dont get me wrong, it did taste pretty good, just lacked in the flavor department.

I followed the recipe for the most part, but followed other reviewers' advice and cut down on the milk.  I only used a cup as I like really thick alfredo sauce.  I also used minced garlic instead of the garlic powder.  I don't generally rate reviews after I alter the recipe, but I have to say that when done right, this sauce was amazingly easy.  You really need to keep whisking and I brought the consistency up before I added the cheese at the end.  I whisked in the cheese until it was melted and used fresh cracked pepper.  It was great stand alone but then I sauteed smoked sausage and roasted red peppers.  I added the sauce and the sausage/peppers to the cooked pasta and mixed well.  It was served to my fiance, a couple of friends, and a picky three year old (I gave her noodles and sauce and had to remove the sausage and peppers from hers).  Everyone loved it.  Personally, I use recipes as a jumping point, but if you are a novice cook, then follow the recipe first and then tweak to your tastes.  I come from an Italian family, so I personally always use fresh garlic, pepper and cheese.  I have "shaky cheese" as my daughter calls it, but I use it as a topper and not a mix in to my recipes.

I made this last night for 8 people, didn't change a thing. Had plenty of sauce. Got rave reviews. Couldn't tell it had cream cheese in it. Will definitely add this to dinner rotation. Maybe next time I'd add peas and shrimp or chicken.

Great quick alfredo sauce.  I made as the recipe stated and also made another time subbing chicken broth for the milk and added some fresh basil before tossing with homemade pasta.  Wonderful and easy.  Thanks!

Very easy to make, you definitely need to cook low and keep whisking.  I made with kraft parmesan and that was the only thing I could taste.  Next time will make with fresh grated parm and use a little less.

This is so incredibly easy to make with delicious results. It lends itself well to modifications such as adding  lots of garlic, or grilled chicken or shrimp at the end. I just love how quick this tasty dish comes together.

The cream cheese in this recipe made this the silkiest sauce ever!!  Absolutelty delicious!  You do have to be patient and whisk and whisk on low to medium heat, however the time spent cooking this the right way makes it all worthwhile! One thing I did change was I used heavy cream instead of milk and added more parm cheese!!  YUM!

This was only 'ok'.  the garlic powder really needs to be fresh garlic, and for me there wasn't enough seasoning even though I added both italian season and extra pepper while cooking.  It is definitely easy and the kids liked it ok, but I was only able to eat it on top of garlic bread.  It also never thickened up for me and I only used 1 1/2c milk.

Tasted great and quick to make!  I think I like this better than "traditional" recipes I've tried.  I used light cream cheese and 2% milk.  Could have cut down the butter to make it a bit healthier.  Also reheated well the next day.

I really did like this, but I did change it to suit how we eat.  To lighten it up, I use only 1/4 cup of butter.  It still comes out rich and creamy, and I feel better about it.  Second, I use half the amount of garlic powder.  The first time I made it, I used all the garlic powder to rave reviews, but it was too strong for me.  I serve this over whole grain penne with sauteed chicken breasts and fresh vegetables like zucchini, summer squash, asparagus, mushrooms-- whatever is on hand and in season.  With delicate fresh vegetables, I want their flavor to stand out. This sauce comes together quickly and easily, and is good with all the garlic or half, but I definitely recommend cutting the butter in half.  The kids have requested to have this more often.  High praise!

It tasted good but a bit bland, so I added crushed red pepper flakes.  I used fat-free cream cheese and 2% milk, which probably affected the richness of the sauce.  Disclaimer: I tasted a few bites of this, but this is primarily my bf's rating because I made it for him.

This is delicious and easy to make.  I had everything on hand too.  I made this to go over some leftover pasta and grilled veggies.  It was nice and smooth and had a nice rich flavor.  I did not think the cream cheese was overwhelming.  My family didn't actually know there was cream cheese in it until I told them.  I will use this recipe again.

This was pretty good, but definitely not the real thing. You can taste the difference between this one and the authentic Alfredo sauce and I prefer the latter by far. This would make a great white sauce for pizza though, but I wouldn't call it Alfredo sauce.

This was extremely disappointing! I followed the recipe exactly except used fresh garlic instead of powder. After tasting the finished product, I found it too bland so I followed other reviewer suggestions and added nutmeg and oregano, two things I've used in other alfredo recipes and enjoyed. The sauce was too heavy (yes, I know alfredo is a heavy sauce to begin with) and lacked the strong flavor of a traditional alfredo sauce. I think maybe the cream cheese dilutes the parmesan taste. My family could barely finish it (a rare occurrence). The time saved just wasn't worth it. I'll stick to garlic, butter, cream, and parm.

This is one of those recipes that I had my doubts about, but, with the ingredents in my frig, and nothing else for dinner, away I went into the kitchen.  My family loves it!  I make it often now, much easier than the real thing.  We call it "Not Alfredo"  and it is one of my favorites.  Thank you.

Very quick, easy and tasty.  I wish I would of listened to my instincts though and sauteed some minced garlic in the butter and left out the garlic powder.  I really think it would improve this dish.  Having said that...I used low fat cream cheese, non fat half-n-half, smart balance butter and added sauteed mushrooms, zucchini, some blanched broccoli and the best thing.....some big fat healthy shrimp & mixed it all with some fettucini.  Even with the low fat ingredients this was good. Consider the fresh minced garlic - Next time I'm adding at least 3 cloves.  Thanks Dawn for sharing your recipe.

Very very good and very easy.  I made it with low-fat cream cheese, skim milk, and once with fat-free milk and loved it each and every time. I/we enjoy it without pasta and just over steamed veggies--spinach, broccoli, cauliflower, zucchini, peppers . . . great!

This is wonderful and super easy. I double the cream cheese but that was the only change. A keeper for sure.

I just finished making this literally 2 minutes ago for my hubby's father's day lunch. It is delectable and so incredibly easy! I haven't even finished making my pasta yet and we probably could drink this as the meal! I actually used lower fat ingredients and it still tastes wonderful. I will definitely be making this over and over again!

This sauce is awesome.  I don't really measure with most sauces, just look at the general amounts needed then go from there.  I served it with portabello raviolis and it was amazing.

Truth be told, I am an awful cook. I can mess up even the simplest recipes...but not this one! So easy, ingredients are cheap and are generally on hand, and very tasty. I had it with basil pesto-filled pasta - a great combo!

I can't believe that such an easy recipe could be SO good! I'm a huge Fettuccine Alfredo lover and this sauce is the best I've made. However, I was shocked to find that my fiance, who doesn't really care for Alfredo sauce, thought this was to die for! So it's good enough to please both Alfredo-lovers and non-lovers. I make just a few tiny modifications: I mince a few cloves of garlic and saute with the butter (we are garlic lovers) and cut back on the garlic powder. I also add a few shakes of ground nutmeg at the end; this adds just a little something special (but it doesn't taste "nutmeg-y" so don't worry). I also add a bit of coarse Kosher salt or sea salt and I put the parmesan on the table instead of stirring it into the sauce so everyone can choose how much they want. My final tip: use a wire whisk to mix the cream cheese into the butter (and again when you add the milk). When I do this, it's always 100% lump-free!

Made this for a graduation party pasta bar along with a marinara recipe also from this site.  Received many, many compliments on this sauce.  My sister-in-law put it together for me which is a good thing because I was going to toss it out. It looks very strange before the milk gets added, almost curdled.  So if you think it looks awful, hang in there...it will turn out!!!

This recipe is mind blowing. My boyfriend and I were extremely impressed. The sauce was very creamy and had great texture. The only thing we did different was sautee onion, garlic, bell peppers, and shrimp to go with it. This recipe will definitly be made over and over again!

this is my boyfriend and I's favorite alfredo recipe.  Definitly better than any sauce you'll buy in a jar.  I like my sauce a little thicker so I used about 1/2 the amount of milk.

Well, I have to say that I am a LOVER of all things cream cheese, and use it as a base for just about any cream/cheese sauce I am making instead of a traditional rue. With that being said, I have NEVER used cream cheese as the base for an Alfredo sauce! I am a traditionalist when it comes to Alfredo, and always went through the painstaking task of making it entirely from scratch. I have to say, though. This is just as good, if not better than most I have made/tried. The best testament to the sauce was a girlfriend of mine who was visiting while I was cooking. I was making homemade fettuccine noodles to go with the sauce. She kept making the comment that she HATED Alfredo sauce. When the meal was ready, she ate her helping, her sons, and I nearly had to arm wrestle her for what was left in the pan! ;) Fantastic sauce! I did take the suggestion of a few posters and added a dash of nutmeg and oregano, along with half heavy cream and half milk, you know if you are going to eat, go all out! The depth and flavor added by these simple changes made it outstanding! I tried it just by the recipe guidelines and it was also really great! I topped the pasta with the sauce and a mixture of marinated chicken breasts, and bacon-SINFUL! This is a meal I will be making again and again! Thank you so much for the posting! Great idea!

If I could rate this a 5+ I would!  I was admittedly a little skeptical about making this with cream cheese but gave it a try anyway.  WOW!  It was excellent.  Better than any Alfredo I have had out of a jar and possibly even in a restaurant!  My two toddlers loved it.  My 4 year old had seconds, which is rare! My husband, who is NOT an Alfredo sauce fan at all, even liked it.  He said he would taste a bite and see if he liked it and then proceeded to heap his plate with a huge serving and ate it all!  You can not tell that this has cream cheese in it at all.  The only things I did change was to change the 2 tsp of garlic salt to 1 tsp garlic salt and 1 tsp minced garlic.  I also added a dash of basil and nutmeg as other reviewers had suggested.  I also tossed in some steamed broccoli.  I can't wait to make this with some grilled chicken.  Thank you for sharing this recipe!  I will never buy Alfredo sauce again!

Wow, where was this recipe the first time I attempted Alfredo Sauce? This recipe is perfect exactly as written. I didn't change a thing except the quantity. I changed the portion size to one, and still ended up with 2 servings.

This was very easy and great tasting!  Followed the suggestions of other reviewers and added fresh garlic, nutmeg, and put in some oregano.  Cooked some chicken breast and one of those broccoli steamers in the microwave then when the chicken and broccoli was finished I mixed it in the alfredo sauce and served over fet. noodles.  My dad who is so picky when it comes to foods raved about it.  Believe me, if it tastes bad I would hear about it.  Very nice... thanks so much! This was my first time making an alfredo sauce and is sooo much better than the jar kind.

I made this especially for my very it.  I halfed the recipe, used skim milk and shredded parm. Otherwise followed it.  Very basic and great.  I served it to her over multigrain penne pasta with a large side of brocolli. It's a keeper.

This is by far the easiest and best alfredo recipe I have ever made!  The only complaint from my husband was that there wasn't enough!  I did as other reviewers recommended and added a dash of oregano and nutmeg, but this sauce would have been delicious without it.

Bland and the cream cheese is overpowering. I wouldn't make this again. Another overrated recipe in my opinion-sorry :(

Good recipe.  I've made it twice already. Next time I will use a little less parmesan and make it a bit thinner.  I love to experiment!

This recipe was wonderful and super quick and easy. Will make again and again! The only change I made was I cooked fresh garlic in the butter instead of garlic powder, then added cream cheese.

This recipe, AS IT IS WRITTEN, is better than some that I've had at nice Italian restaurants. I did used fresh, minced garlic in place of the powder. 1/4 tsp garlic powder = one medium garlic clove. YUM! Thanks for the great recipe!

I wasnt too impressed with this recipe. It was very creamy, which was a plus, but the flavor was not so great, pretty bland. i tried adding romano to help it out; nothing. i added more pepper; nothing. it was barely edible, but i did, as im trying not to waste food.

I made this last night on a whim (I've been meaning to make it for about 2 years). I just so happened to have all of the ingredients in my kitchen. I scaled this down to two servings (which really is about 3 or 4) and used a little less than 1 cup milk, about 3 tbs butter, 3 tsp minced garlic, and a about 3 ounces of cream cheese - I wanted to make as little as possible. It turned out FANTASTIC. In the end I added a LOT of ground black pepper, but that's just how I like my alfredo. I was so surprised at how tasty this recipe was, expecially since the main ingredient was cream cheese! I will defninitely be making this again!

I was very, very, skeptical of an Alfredo recipe that called for cream cheese, but I was also very, very desperate for some fettucine Alfredo. I'm glad I tried this. The flavor was excellent. I used 2% milk, reduced-fat cream cheese, and pre-grated Parmesan from the green can and it was still great. It was cheaper and better than, Alfredo sauce from a jar, and easier than a traditional homemade Alfredo sauce.

Great recipe.  I took the advice of other reviewers and added 1/2 chopped onion and 2 garlic cloves to butter as it melted, and used less milk (about 1 1/4 cup). I also added some Italian herbs and a few red pepper flakes.  DELICIOUS.

While making this recipe I wasn't sure if it would turn out because it was so lumpy and just didn't look to great.  It smoothed out eventually though.  The taste wasn't that great for me.  I thought it kind of tasted like buttermilk.  My boyfriend liked it though.  The next day it was alot better tasting.  I suppose the flavors were able to settle some.  I still had to add alot of salt and pepper too.  I would say this is a start possibly to a good recipe, but it's just not there yet.

I have made this recipe multiple times and it is so easy and SO tasty... my husband leaves no leftovers! In a pinch I have made it with mozzerella cheese or the powdered parmesan and it still turns out good. I have recommended this recipe to many others, and they all love it too!

This was an okay sauce, but nothing close to real Alfredo. I made a double batch, but I found there was too much Parmesan, tasted too much of cream cheese and I only used a little more than half the milk required. Perhaps this affected the outcome. I may or may not make this again.

Awesome!  It was soooo easy.  I used low fat cream cheese and skim milk.  The only change I made was to reduce the milk to 1.5 cups and it was the perfect consistency.  I think it would have been really runny if I had used 2 cups.  My guess for the necessary reduction is due to lack of fat, which is thicker, in the milk.  I'll try adding some pesto or sun-dried tom next time.  Thanks for the recipe!

I have to give this five stars because I don't like the jar stuff and have never attempted to make it from scratch until now. I read all the reviews (well most) and followed the recipe almost to the tee. I added italian seasoning, fresh ground black pepper, no salt (it didn't need any). It came out sooo creamy, I wish the parmesan cheese would melt better than it does though, then I could say it was "silky", but it wasn't, I could feel the parmesan on the palate, but it was good nontheless. I had left over chicken, so added chopped chicken and laddled it over my spaghetti pasta (ran out of fettucine and linguine) and topped with chopped fresh parsley/cilantro and another turn of the pepper grinder.  EXQUISITE!!! Mahalo for this recipe!!!

amazing! my hubby said it tasted like olive garden!!! the only thing I did differently was I added the milk to the consistency i wanted and didn't add as much cream cheese as it calls for! I also added fresh minced garlic and a dash of nutmeg!(definitely makes a huge difference!)  Don't be afraid if at first the cream cheese looks a little bit clumpy-once you add the milk it will all come together!

Seriously delicious alfredo.  The only think I did differently was to add some oregano and nutgeg.  Will make again! UPDATE:  this sauce is very versatile and can be used with many different recipes.  I have made tuna casserole using this recipe (add 2 cans tuna) with great results!

This worked out so much better for me than other alfredo recipes. You cannot taste the cream cheese, and it makes it so much easier! I think next time I will add the parmesan earlier to give it more time to melt without over cooking the sauce. Thank you!!

Yum!  This recipe was wicked good, although I found that it called for too much milk.  It ended up being a bit runny.  But it tasted delicious!  I made the Slow Cooker Lemon Garlic Chicken II from this site, then added some egg noodles for the last 25 minutes.  I served the sauce over the noodles, then topped with the chicken.  The hubby loved it!  I will definitely be making this again.

I was absolutely surprised by the result of this recipe. It didn't taste like authentic alfredo. Although it was easy, I couldn't enjoy it at all. My husband ate it, but I won't make it again. I was shocked because of the amount of reviews and such high positive rating. I was very disappointed and I have always agreed with the rating and excellence of the recipes on this site.

I love it! I love it! I love it! Simply too good! I did follow a few suggestions by other reviewers: sauteed minced garlic and used only 1 1/2 cup of milk! I also added one TBS of mayonnaise. I didnt have parmesan, so i used cheddar instead and it turned out just fine! . I used two tsp of crushed green chillies to add more flavor! This recipe is a keeper! I will try it with fettucine next! Thank you for sharing the secret!

Simple, FAST, and delicious recipe. I had everything on hand, no shopping or chopping needed.  I halved the recipe for two of us and added some leftover rotissere chicken breast.  The only change was to add a bit of fresh ground nutmeg.  This will be a go-to recipe for busy nights.

This may be a good base to start but in my opinion there is too much butter!  I have made mine similar by using lower fat cream cheese, one cup of chicken broth and a handful of parmesan cheese.  I also add 1/2 red pepper diced, 1/3 cup green onions, chopped and four garlic gloves, minced and saute in a little olive oil before melting the cream cheese.  My family (husband and two children) love my recipe!

This recipe was wonderful! I followed it almost exactly and it turned out creamy and delicious. Alfredo I can actually afford! My husband loved it and was coming up with idea after idea of how we could use it. Someday, when we're no longer poor students, I plan to substitute some of the butter for olive oil to make a healthier and lighter sauce. This ones a keeper!

This is a great recipe.  I use light cream cheese and low-fat milk, and it still is wonderful.  This was the first recipe I ever made for my boyfriend, he still asks for it all the time! I always use a lot of garlic, and I usually mix it with chicken, broccoli, and sauteed mushrooms.  So good!

This sauce was awesome! So easy to make and way better than anything from a jar. Mom husband even liked it and he is not a fan of anything with pasta. I finally found an alfredo recipe that is easy and great. I will definitely be making this again.

I loved this recipe.  To me it was as good or better than my favorite restaurant Alfredo sauce.  So easy too.  I had some 1/2 and 1/2 that I wanted to use up, so I used that for half of the milk and skim for the other half.

Holy smokes, this is GOOD! Made it for dinner last night and my husband absolutely loved it! I used skim milk and fat free cream cheese--it thickened just fine. I added diced garlic and sauteed shrimp, it was DIVINE!!! Can't wait to eat the rest for lunch today :) Thanks for sharing

very, very good-make sure cream cheese and butter is mixed completely. i prefer to add parm to this mixture before adding milk.  i also like to use a blend of cream and milk. even better with sauted baby bella mushrooms/onion/garlic and grilled chicken.

We just finished having this for dinner, and my husband said this favorably compared with Olive Garden's alfredo sauce, which he loves.  I used low fat cream cheese and skim milk, and threw in some shredded Italian cheeses.  The flavor and texture were excellent!  Thanks for the recipe.

Great recipe.. I used marscapone cheese instead of cream cheese, and it worked great!  I also discovered after I'd already begun cooking that I was out of parm. cheese, so I used grated mozarella instead.  Even with my substitutions, it was still super yummy!  Thanks!

I only had some spreadable spinach and feta cream cheese on hand, so I took a gamble and tried it out. This turned out so well and in the words of my husband is "one of the best things I've ever made!"

Was very easy to make.  I am a newbie to the cooking thing.  I did find adding the Parmesan Cheese before milk helped melt it better.  I only used 1 3/4 cup milk.  It was just thick enough.

I found it a bit bland. I added some salt to bring out the flavors and it turned out quite good. One thing I've learned in cooking is if it tastes like something's missing... it's probablly salt!

Better than what comes in the jar, but not really Alfredo Sauce.  It's excellent as a white cheese sauce though.

This just didn't have much flavor to me.  I used some half and half with the milk because I had only skim milk and I thought it would make it better.  We ate it but it was a waste of butter, cream cheese, milk, parmesan cheese and the expensive tortellini I bought.  Not to mention the calories!!!  I've had better alfredo sauce from a powder in a packet.

Amazing. I did take some suggestions and cut the amount of milk in half and added a dash of nutmeg and Italian seasoning, but definitely 5 stars.

OMG so tasty. I gave it 4 stars because I tweaked the recipe a bit. I first melted only 1/4 stick of butter and threw in some fresh chopped garlic. I then added low fat cream cheese until melted. Added only about 1 1/4 cup of 2% milk then seasoned w/ salt, pepper, & a dash of nutmeg. Oh and I also put in about 1/4 cup of shredded aged parmesan cheese.  Served it with pumpkin ravioli's. My hubby and I ate almost the whole thing ourselves!

My daughter and I loved the flavor.  The texture wasn't very creamy.  I used skimmed milk and added it after the cheese so I thought either of those factors may have made it that way.  I added steamed broccoli.  If I use regular milk next time and it is creamier, it will be just about perfect.  I added a dash of nutmeg too.

The title says it all...this recipe was quick and easy and very good I might add :) I used 1/3 less fat Philly cream cheese and organic skim milk.  I served over bow pasta and pesto chicken breast with garlic bread. For those who like to add nutmeg, etc. to their Alfredo, this recipe allows you the flexibility to do so...I chose to follow recipe exactly this time around and was happy with the result.
UPDATE:  I now add a little nutmeg (very little, as a little goes a long way) and it does seem to add some depth to the flavor.  It was great before and now, I think it's even more amazing with the touch of nutmeg.  Hope this helps!

This is a great alfredo sauce.  I used real garlic, half the recommended amount of butter, and shredded refridgerated parmesan (not the fake stuff).  It's the perfect consistency for me.  Thick and creamy.  Wonderful!

Never again will I make this. I did not care for this recipe. Runny. Grainy. Tasted like it came out of a powdered mix. DH ate it just to cheer me up. The fact that this has so many positive reviews is startling as I followed exact directions. I'll stick with the recipe from America's Test Kitchen-100 times better.

It was pretty good, quick and standard I'd say.  I guess Alfredo is not my favorite sauce so it is difficult for me to be amazed by it.

Well after coming back here I must have read too many reviews and changed the original some. I was in a pinch and only had limited ingredients on hand, was hoping this would work. I used heavy whipping cream and a little half and half instead of milk.  I only had canned parmesan and didn't want the sauce to be grainy, so I put it in my blender first.  Added some cream to the blender too so I could get all the parmesan out.(ha ha)  I only used half of the cream cheese cause that was all I had and I microwaved it first to get it soft.  Was hoping it would be easier to blend with the butter and garlic I sauted.  Seemed to work pretty good, I had no problems with it being grainy or oily just a nice sauce.  My husband even put it on his hot dog.  Mind you I don't recommend that, cause I did not try it. Sounded yuck to me, but he assured me it wasn't.  Yes we were really scraping the cupboards today!!

Good recipe.  Nice alternative to jarred sauce.  I like to put this on top of bow tie pasta and chicken with cheese on top and then bake until the cheese has melted.

I thought this was pretty good.  I will definitely make this again.  After reading a few of the other reviews I made some slight changes.  I used 1% milk, Low Fat Cream Cheese and only 1/4 cup of butter.  I also added some nutmeg.  I'm sure my sauce didn't have the same taste as if I followed the recipe as written but I wanted to cut out some fat and calories.  I really did still enjoy it.  Thanks!

WOW! This tastes great and I really enjoyed the convienence of the ingredients since I never carry cream in my household and always have cream cheese! Can't forget to mention how easy this was to make, I can see how adding minced garlic would give it a fresher flavor, even better some fresh pasta to go w/ it!

Oh, my gosh.  This is wonderful.  I used chicken breast, cooked it up with fresh garlic and set aside.  Then, I used fresh garlic again with the sauce, sauteing the garlic with the butter.  ah...  served with garlic bread and California blend veggies.  WONDERFUL.  Will make again!

This is a very good alfredo sauce. It is easy to make and tastes like what you would get in a restaurant. We added chicken and served with garlic bread. I doubled the recipe and ended up with nine adult servings and a little to spare.

this was definately a great and easy alfredo sauce.  Next time I will cut back on the garlic and also I will use fresh parmesean to get rid of some of the grainy texture.  Would be great with shrimp alfredo.

I really liked this alfredo sauce.  It was easy to make with on-hand ingredients.  I always have milk, butter, cream cheese & parmesan - but rarely have a spare quart of heavy cream in my fridge.

I served this over pasta with steamed shrimp.  Very nice.

Great, simple recipe. I made it a couple weeks ago and it worked out well. Today, I used 8 oz marscapone instead of cream cheese and simmered the sauce on low for about 20 minutes. The marscapone is milder and smoother and I could really taste the garlic and parmesan in the sauce. Good recipe either way, though. Kudos for innovation.

Very good and simple to make. However, with all the rave reviews, my expectations were much higher. Followed the recipe with the addition of nutmeg, Italian seasoning, and slightly more black pepper. Makes way more than just 4 servings. AT LEAST 8.

I made this while the in-laws were here and I was not really sure if they would like it. They are more into southern style cooking, but it went over very well. It was delicious and easy to make with things that I had on hand. The cream cheese was great in it, I would never have thought to use it but it added real consistency to the sauce. Delicious. I will make this many more times I am sure. Great recipe!

This recipe is wonderful!  I like the creaminess that the cream cheese imparts.  And this is so fast and easy.  In the time it took to cook the pasta, I had the sauce done, as well sauteing some mushrooms for DD and grilling a chicken breast for her boyfriend to add to their plates.  I cut back on the garlic due to dd's preference and it was still wonderful.  Thanks for a great, easy recipe!

I was making dinner for some friends, but I work until pretty late in the evenings. I made this sauce the night before. I added some nutmeg (after reading the reviews). It was wonderful the night before - it was smooth, velvety, perfect. Last night, however, when I was getting ready to serve it, it seperated a little bit. It still tasted wonderful, but the seperation caused the texture to be a little less than great. I highly recommend making the sauce for the same night it will be served. Oh! I was having 6 people for dinner, so I upped the servings to 6. I ended up with a TON of alfredo. The original recipe would have easily sufficed.

Used FF 1/2 n 1/2, 6 oz of light crm cheese (was afraid it would be too heavy crm cheese taste with 8oz. I am glad I only used 6oz), 3oz of reggiano and 3 oz fresh grated parm. I added 2 cloves of fresh minced garlic and a pinch of nutmeg (an essential in alfredo sauces)

My daughters and I wanted an alfredo sauce for our fettucine.  This one is outstanding!  It was so easy and very delicious.  It didn't specify what kind of milk, and I only had skim, so I tried it and it worked wonderfully.  Next time I may even try reduced fat cream cheese, too. I don't know what these cooks didn't like who scored it so low.  It was fabulous, my daughters agree.

Very good recipe and easy too. Only used 1/2 cream cheese and used parm. cheese to taste (I like mine strong) it wouldn't thicken up for me so I just poured it into my Penne that I only drained (did not rinse) It turned out perfect. Thickened nicely and really coated the pasta well. I will use this recipe again and again. Thanks.

I needed a quick Alfredo sauce to use on a white pizza I found on this site. This was perfect. I only used one cup of milk as that seemed to bring the sauce to the consistancy I needed. I also added pepper. This recipe definetely was quick and easy and pretty tasty on a white pizza, too!

This is very good and oh so easy.  I did have to let it sit for 8-10 minutes after removing from the heat before it thickened up.  Also, make sure all that grated parm melts before you take it off the burner or the sauce will seem a little gritty.  I used the reduced fat cream cheese, 1% milk, and 2 tsp of minced garlic.  Next time, I'll add grilled chicken, shrimp, and some broccoli.  This is a keeper.

I really wish that I liked this recipe since it is so easy to put together but it tasted too much like cream cheese. I think that maybe if I would have added some veggies to the dish that it would have tasted better, or maybe a little more milk to make it taste a little less "cream cheeseish".

This did not turn out as good as I had hoped it would.  I could not get it to thicken, no matter how long I let it sit.  I finally had to add a flour/water mixture to get it to thicken, and then it got too thick, and I had to thin it!  I also thought it was too bland, and had to add extra garlic powder, salt and pepper.  I also feel 1/2 cup of butter is too much.  Not sure if I will make this again.  If I do, I will cut down on the butter, and add some extras to the recipe as suggested by other reviewers.

My husband said "excellent!". OK, it was for a dinner party, so calories were not an issue. Instead of milk and garlic powder, I actually heated some heavy whipping cream and added fresh garlic to infuse the flavor. I also slightly heated the cream cheese for about 15 seconds in the microwave to soften it. This was a really easy recipe to follow. Everyone seemed to love it. I blackened some chicken breast tenders a laid them on top. Yummy! Great dish for a party!

Absolutely wonderful!!! Made this with fettuccini. Added steamed broccoli and grilled chicken. My entire family LOVED it. Also re-heats very well for left overs.

I was so pleasantly surprised how good this tasted.  I used all fat-free products and nobody missed their "fat".  I only used half for my recipe and stored the remainder about a week in the fridge--still tasted good after reheating--and most importantly, still kept its texture.

I am very picky when it comes to alfredo sauce, but I found this one to be absolutley delicious! It just needs to be a bit thicker. In the end, my husband and I agreed that it was best homemade to date!

This is absolutely wonderful! So easy and quick to make. No hassle, no fuss, and very delicious and authentic tasting. You really do not taste the cream cheese in there. For those who had a hard time blending the cream cheese with the butter over the stove, I think it might help to have the cream cheese at room temp before you start. However, it is not such a problem, because everything starts coming together nicely once you start adding the milk and whisking at the same time. I added some leftover cooked chicken pieces and a bit of nutmeg to the sauce, and I also added some mixed frozen veggies to the pasta during the last 3 minutes of cooking. After draining the pasta, I mixed in the sauce. Perfectly complete meal in one single dish! Contains all food groups. Love it! Thanks for sharing the recipe!

I found this recipe on 6/2.  I am a simple type of cook! I don't like alot fuss & definitely not alot of mess! Plus I like things to have fresh & simple taste! I wasn't really sure about the cream cheese, but figured I would give this recipe a try. It was very easy to make,extremely creamy, and tasty!!!  Since I don't use whole milk, I used 1% milk and also fresh garlic.  I think because I used 1% milk, it didn't quite thicken like I wanted  that night. Plus I made the sauce pretty late at night. So I would imagine it would have thickened a bit better had I made the sauce at a more reasonable dinner hour. I probably could have let it thicken a little while on medium heat. But again, it was late & I was hungry! I definitely will use this recipe again!  I may try it with light cream cheese and 1% milk to see how that comes out!
6/26- I made this recipe again and decided to do it with whole milk this time. I was making it for me and my boyfriend at his place. Not sure if it was his stove or what. But when I tried to melt the cream cheese, it really just wouldn't melt.  So intstead of just wasting it, I put the melted butter and 'sort of' melted cream cheese in a blender. Then I added the 2 cups of milk, garlic, a bit of salt and pepper. That all blended very well! Lastly I put that mixture bank on the stove to heat it up and added the parmesan cheese. It thickened really quickly! My boyfriend loved it and said it was extremely creamy! I loved it too! It was even better than the

I would give this a 3.5. My biggest problem was the consistency. It seemed like it was too thin, so I kept on adding more and more parmesan cheese. After the sauce sat awhile, it tasted gritty when we had 2nds. I added grilled chicken and served it over bow-tie pasta. It was good, but it might be easier just to stick with the can variety.

I will admit I was a bit unsure about the cream cheese, but I was impressed. It did turn out a super creamy sauce. I would recommend using a real cheese not imitation (i.e. Parmigiano-Reggiano, what I use, or Grana Padano) because that is the main flavor. Like others, I also used fresh garlic, more pepper and served with chicken over spinach pasta instead of regular for health as well as taste. For me, I thought the recipe made way too much. I had a ton of leftovers (not great for reheating in the microwave, but did ok on the stove—I would also recommend not mixing extra sauce with noodles so you can re-wisk the sauce). Next time I will use 1/4 of the recipe, which should be plenty for 3-4 people. Overall great recipe!!

Wow this recipe is fantastic!!! My husband and I both gobbled it right up.  Awesome recipe for being so quick and easy.  The only change I made was I used 4 fresh garlic cloves instead of the powder.  Will definetly be making this one again!!  Update: We had about half the sauce leftover  so the next night I sauteed some bacon with sliced green peppers and mushroom then added the sauce in and WOW! It was absolutely amazing over the pasta!! It reminded my of Linguine Chicken Tettrazini from East Side Marios.  Way awesome :)

This was a super easy alfrdo sauce, and it just tastes really good. I put a little nutmeg in it to give it a bit of a twist. The cream cheese just does something wonderful for the sauce. My hubby loves it. Pour over chicken and pasta with some hearty veggies and it'll be a knock-out!

Wow!  I made my pasta, left it in a bowl, and made my sauce in the same pot without even washing it.  It was done before my pasta even got cold.  It's so amazing to think that my having tossed a hunk of butter, some cream cheese, a splash of milk, and a sprinkle of garlic salt could have come out to be so utterly delicious!  I'll be using this recipe again and again.  Thank you!

FABULOUS this sauce was not only easy to make, but it also tastes better than the one you buy in a jar from the grocery store that are supposed to taste restaruant style. This is restaraunt style. Thank you for this recipe.

OMG... best alfredo recipe I've ever had.  I went to a 5 star Italian restaurant in my travels in WA and had the best Alfredo.  I referred it to all I knew.  This, I think, is better! Don't change a thing... I DO use fresh parmesan... however, one night in a pickle, I grated some chedder cheese for the cheesy texture (all I had) and added the dried grated parmesan.  Wasn't bad - ALMOST as good.
Thanks for the great recipe.  Definitely a keeper!

This is quick and easy for sure but when I make this again I will start with a little less butter, milk, and garlic powder. I very much like the idea of the cream cheese and to be honest, if I had not made this myself I would not have guessed it contained cream cheese.

This recipe is awesome!!! It will replace the one I already have in my file. I made two changes. I used fresh garlic and I used half milk and half cream because I'm not worried about the fat content. It does make alot, at least enough for four adults. Not sure how it reheats, I havn't tried to reheat it yet. Yummy, thanks!

Holy cow!  This is a great receipe.  I cut it in half for the same serving size, and used low fat cream cheese. It saved on calories, but was still very creamy and delicious.  I also added pesto sauce which was great, but it would have been just as good alone. A keeper!

If 10 stars was an option, this recipe would get them! The best we've ever had, including the best of italian restaurants! So smooth, creamy and flavorful- even SMELLS delicious.I used lite butter, lite cream cheese and cut back on the milk just a tad as we like really thick sauce. I passed this on to every cook I know. Thanx so much for this oh-so-ez recipe.

Simple and delicious. It's a hit with my son, who is four and does not like "red" sauce. Great on anything: pasta, veggies, fish...he likes to dip things into it. I'm very glad I found this recipe and I've been using it for years!

I followed the recipe exactly, and it did not thicken hardly at all, no matter how long I let it sit.  My boyfriend thought it tasted okay, but I thought it just tasted like garlic powder and milk.  I wouldn't make it again.

Super recipe!  I had all the ingredients on hand - doesn't usually happen!  My whole family loved it -even little kids!  I do not usually make Alfredo because of the calorie content, but using skim milk and lite cream cheese, I felt a little bit better.  I added broccoli to the pasta, and my kids even loved the broccoli!  Now that is saying something! Will definitely make again and again!

I love this recipe; its easy and very quick. I made the sauce in the time it took to cook the noodles. Also I used low fat cream cheese and 1% milk and it was delicious. It was a little to greasy, but I think that you could easily cut the butter in half without effecting the taste.  I sliced some fresh mushrooms and sauted them before adding the cream cheese and they were delicious.  I will definitely make this again next time with less butter.

I followed the instructions exactly. I made this yesterday and I couldnt believe the outcome...amazing!! I was a bit concerned when I stirred in the cream cheese b/c it didnt get as smooth but once you stir in the milk it comes out to perfection.

Really easy and really great! I didn't taste the cream cheese at all in this recipe. I did however make one change, I used minced garlic instead of the garlic powder. Will definitely make again. Thank you for the wonderful recipe!

I am so convinced that this is the best Alfredo recipe in existence that I would bet real money that whoever rates this recipe low didn't actually make it or didn't follow the directions! It beats the store bought jarred stuff by light years and more! Where else are you going to get Alfredo sauce other than a restaurant?? If restaurant food is what you want go to a restaurant and quit comparing home cooking with dining out!

This wasn't the best for me. My family LOVED it. Husband really likes a creamier thicker restaurant style alfredo sauce. I like very traditional thinner sauces. I'll make it again for them, but make my own once in a while too. Still get's the four stars from me, because it was easy and turned out as it was supposed to.

This is the best, quick alfredo sauce I've ever tried.  I had mixed 4 T. butter, 1 t. Italian Seasoning, 1 t. Parsley, 1 glove of Garlic, and 1/4 t. Black Pepper into my last 8oz. block of cream cheese the night before to put on crackers.  I had most of it left over so, I used that in a pinch!  I left out the Garlic called for in this recipe since the cream cheese already had some in it.  It gave the sauce a GREAT flavor!!  My mother and aunt told me to remember how I had made this because they want it again.  

P.S.  My one year old twins gobbled it up too!! I made theirs with the large size pasta shells.

Really good sauce. Easier than I ever could have imagined!! I made a serving for 6 with a whole box of fettucini (8 servings) and I had SOOO much left over. Makes ALOT! I used some heavy cream with the milk. I used salted butter but this still needed salt. I used a little more cheese than it called for. Really good! will make again. (This is more of a special occasion sauce because it is SO bad for you. It's not the kind of thing you'd want to feed your family on a regular basis)

This was a very quick and easy dish to prepare, but, it had very good flavor - the cream cheese made it rich and creamy.  I did make a few changes.  I only had 1% milk and thought it would be too thin, so, I used part milk and part heavy cream. I also marinated and cooked some chicken and steamed some broccoli that I added to the dish.  It does make a lot of food.  I would definitely make this again.  Next time, I plan on leaving out the broccoli and adding some sun-dried tomatoes.

Excellent!!!! Since tomorrow is Christmas Eve and we have 3 big family dinners ahead of us,I wanted to try something different. I have tried other alfredo sauces from this site and they have been okay, but this one is a keeper! I used 1 1/4 cup of milk and 3/4 cup of half-and-half because I needed to get rid of what little I had left. I also used fresh garlic and added italian seasoning to the sauce.

This is an exceptional Alfredo sauce.  I added some chopped bacon, chicken, and mushrooms to the sauce and served over Fettuccine.  I used a little less garlic than the recipe called for.

This sauce was excellent!!! Our family of four ate this up and loved it. I only had whipped cream cheese and grated pecorino romano cheese (3/4 cup was what I equated the oz. measurement with) and it came out lovely. We all loved it and the best part is it keeps well in the refrigerator and didn't separate or lose flavor like many other alfredo sauces. I will definitely make this again and again.

Update: This works just using the 1/4 cup of butter and also using just milk. I tried to freeze the extra and it wasn't good. Even after only a week. 11/28/07:Totally nummy! I wanted to substitute fat free 1/2 & 1/2 like another reviewer but decided to stick the the exact recipe first. I realized I had accidentally bought Neufachetel (sp?) cream cheese, but it was great. I was afraid it wasn't going to thicken because it was taking a while at first, but it suddenly thickened right up after I stopped stirring and let it heat up every once in a while. Next time I will try the fat free 1/2 & 1/2, and not use quite as much butter, I think it would work just as well with just 1/4 cup. Thanks!

Honestly, don't expect this to taste like alfredo. But if you expect it to taste like a tasty garlic and cheese sauce, you'll be pleased. And it really is quick and easy.

Extremely easy and great recipe. My kids and I thought it needed a bit more cheese..so maybe next time 8 oz instead of 6 oz. but oh yes I can see using this for many different meals. thanks!

Wow! This was delicious, quick, easy and yummy! U would never know its base is cream cheese. I unfortunately didnt let my cream cheese soften first, so it got clumpy. I softened it the 2nd time and it was perfect. Thank u for this keeper!

Quite possibly the best Alfredo sauce I have ever had. I used it in large quantity,  "16 servings," to serve alongside spaghetti sauce & meatballs for a co-op of 20 people. It was by FAR the favorite sauce and the little bit that was left over even heated up quite well when heated on the stove with a little more milk added.

I'm sorry- this wasn't good for us. The garlic is the main flavor, and it had a funky texture. My children, who love pasta and love alfredo, wouldn't eat this. Definately not a keeper in my household.

Quick, easy, inexpensive, delicious,  perfect!!!  I added a little more cheese and a bit of fresh grated nutmeg. I made this a few weeks ago and we enjoyed it but there was a lot of sauce leftover.  I intended to make an alfredo chicken pizza but didn't get to that so I put the sauce in a baggie and froze it. I figured I could throw it out now or throw it out later if it didn't hold up to the freeze. It did.  We had the rest last night and it was perfect again.  Thanks, Dawn. Update: Made this easier and healthier last night.  2T butter in sauce pan to melt.  1 1/2 C  2% milk, low fat cream cheese, canned parmesan, pepper, garlic powder and appx. 1/4 t. fresh grated  nutmeg into the blender then poured that into the melted butter. Kiddo never would eat alfredo.  This is now her new favorite.

This works well even with low fat ingredients.  It does thicken really fast (thus the 4 stars)--too fast, I had to add more milk (and more cheese for flavor).

Yum! I have never tried to make my own alfredo sauce. This was good and inexpensive to make. Even my husband, who isn't a fan of alfredo, liked it. I would probably add a little less cream cheese next time. I did have a problem with the sauce not thickening, so I added a litte corn starch and water and it worked fine. Thanks for the recipe.

Wow, this is great! Okay like all cooks a few "tweeks".  I used heavy whipping cream, upped the seasoning and added italian seasoning too.  It all depends on what meat I am serving this with or pasta.  It is versitile and easy.  The secret is to use a hand held little mixer to incorporate all the ingredients.  The cream cheese can be a bit lumpy.  Try it, you will never go back to any thing else, even a jar!

This is the best "homemade" Alfredo recipe I have tried. It was very quick and creamy. It doesn't taste too much like cream cheese like the other recipes I have tries. This recipe made enough sauce that I refrigerated some and had it over pasta the next day too. 
The only thing that I changed in this recipe was that I used minced garlic instead of garlic powder, and added that when I was melting the butter. The rest I did according to the recipe. Very creamy and yummy!!

This is the alfredo recipe that I have been waiting all of my life to find! The texture and consistency is gourmet restaurant quality. I followed the recipe exactly but added Tones Chicken Base (a chicken broth paste found at Sam's Club and restaurant stores), to taste, (about 2 tsps) sprinkled some nutmeg in and the alfredo was to die for.

absolutely awesome.  super creamy and as was mentioned earlier...so versatile!  it's a great start of a sauce and you can customize it for all your needs.  the first time i added pine nuts and bacon for a carbonara type sauce and it was super rich but to die for.  i would definitely recommend using fat free milk and low fat cream cheese because it is super rich even with just those - you can not tell you used them.  i think it would be overkill if you used regular products.  so amazing though - the cream cheese makes it!

This was so easy and tasted great!!! I added some Nutmeg and served the sauce over Linguine and grilled chicken strips. I will definitely make this again and might try the lower fat version that other reviews have suggested.

This was great!  I'm very picky about my alfredo sauces and usually make mine from scratch using eggs, parm, and heavy cream. This was a delightful change and I may even start using this instead of my own recipe.  Nice creamy taste... just what I was looking for that night.

It was certainly quick and easy but the recipe looked bland so I doctored it.  I sauteed chopped onion and minced garlic with the butter.  I added a large dash of nutmeg, 1/4tsp of red pepper flakes, a dash of cayenne, italian seasoning, and salt because I used unsalted butter.  I added julienned ham and peas to make a more filling meal.  I only added 1 cup of milk and that still made it a little too thin but I turned up the heat and it thickened.  It was good, but it needed to simmer for a while to let the spices balance out the cream cheese taste.  There is a cream cheese taste, although I imagine if you used one full cup of milk, it'd be less obvious.  The cream cheese taste was unnoticeable with the pasta, though.  I think this would make a good base for another sauce.  It was good but a traditional Alfredo sauce is already so easy.  But for times when I don't have cream, this will be my stand-by.

Easy, easy Alfredo sauce. The next day, when heating up the pasta, it doesn't separate into that oil yucky mess that some sauces do. It makes a huge batch and is a bit rich...but YUM!

Great recipe!  I followed the recipe exactly how it's written, with only one exception.  
I prefer my dishes a little saltier, so I just added more to taste!!

This is the best sauce. I make this quite often. It is quick, delicious, easy, and cheap to make. So much better than alfredo sauce in a jar and not much more time to prepare. I will always use this recipe it is wonderful.

I never knew making my own alfredo sauce could be so simple and delicious. The only changes I made were that I used fresh chopped garlic (and I'm so glad that I did) and I only used 1.5 cups of whole milk because I like my sauce thick. I added shrimp and served it over linguini. YUMMY!!

This is the BEST alfredo sauce and so easy!  My husband does not like alfredo sauce but he LOVES this one!! I have made this several times for my husband and I as well as for dinner parties - everyone raves about it. I prefer this to the kind out of the jar.

i only used a cup and a half of milk because i wanted a thicker sauce.  it ended up being pretty amazing considering how easy and cheap it was to make.  picky bf had seconds, it was great.  will make again.

Just made this as a dish-for-one. Super easy and tasty, too!  I used lighter versions of all the ingredients, added peppered bacon bits, and tossed it with fetticine, broccoli, and a few diced tomatoes.  Next time I'm going to try it with chicken sausage...

Easy and delicious. I used 1 1/2 cups of 1/2 and 1/2 instead of 2 cups milk. That was the only change! Just loved it with noodles, chicken and broccoli! Kids asked for the meal next day! YUM

This recipe was really delicious and easy.  I used reduced fat cream cheese and fat free half & half (one cup instead of two). The sauce turned out perfectly. I also added cooked ground chicken for some protein and it was great!

Quite yummy for being so easy. It wasn't the best I have ever had, but it was the best I have made! I screwed up the order of the ingredients so I am sure that's why mine was a tad bit gritty. It was still good nonetheless. The only problem I had was that it thickened up a great deal. I added some caramelized onions, peas and cooked bacon to mine.

This does not taste like alfredo sauce.  And nomatter what I did I could not get it completely creamy even with fresh parm.  It tastes like something that you would get frozen.

Amazing. Never had anything like it. And i'm not even a huge fan of 'white' pasta sauces. I added some steamed broccoli and fresh mushrooms towards the end of cooking; and a pinch of cayenne!

Did Olive Garden get their recipe for this sauce here?! Seriously amazing. I used garlic salt instead of garlic powder, and replaced butter with Blue Bonnet. Two words: simply marvelous! I put this sauce over bow-tie pasta and kielbasa turkey sausage (a recipe from this side) and it was a major hit.  :)

Alfredo sauce used to be a problem with me until I tried this recipe. It always came out lumpy and the ingredients didn't combine well. This sauce is smooth and tasty. Thanks

Congratulations! This is the best and easiest recipe I've ever come across. It's great on it's own or as a base to many pasta recipes. 

The second time I made it, I microwaved 3 cups of frozen broccoli florets in 1/4 cup of water for 5 minutes, strained them, then stirred them into the sauce before mixing it with  rotini. It was wonderful!

 Store bought grated parmesan works just fine. Of course, the higher quality ingredients you use, the better the sauce will taste.

I will never buy jarred alfredo sauce again! The store bought stuff is bland and expensive. This recipe is the complete opposite! Its very cheap and wondeful. It's not like Olive Garden but it definitely works for homemade. I used lite butter, cream cheese, milk and cream and they came out fine. I used 1 c. fat free creamer and 1 c. milk. Also, the butter/cream cheese will blend better once the milk/creamer is added. I also used more parmesan and about 1 1/2 t. garlic powder and a little bit of italian seasoning. Mine wasn't too runny or too thick. I'll definitely add this to our regulars!

This Alfredo sauce is the best I've ever had.  It is tasty and light, not too heavy.  I used it over a penne and mushroom dish.  The did decrease the milk to 1-1/2 cups and used a little less then 1/4 cup of grated cheese and it was perfect!!!

ABSOLUTELY WON-DER-FUL The kids asked to have just a bowl of the sauce. I only used 1 1/2 cups of milk and added some parsley for color. So easy to make and delicious. Try this before you buy storebought.

All I can say is Yum!  I was a little worried at first, because the cream cheese and the butter didn't smooth together very well, but once the milk is stirred in, it did very well.  Added a little precooked chicken, a little more salt, pepper and garlic powder than what the recipe called for, and poured it on top of cheese tortellni.  It was amazing.....Thank you!

Great, easy recipe.  I did make a few changes.  I used 8 oz. Neufchatel Cheese (1/3 less fat), 1/2 cup Smart Balance buttery spread (instead of butter), 1 clove of garlic, 4 oz. shredded parmesan cheese and 4 oz. grated parmesan cheese, 1 1/2 cups milk.  Loved how easy this was!

I used 1 garlic clove (crushed) instead of the garlic powder and 8 oz. of parmesan instead of 6. The only negative is that it had a bit of a grainy texture. I refrigerated the leftover sauce and used it 2 days later. It was smoother, creamier, and better tasting than the night I made it, so in the future I will make it ahead of time.

This recipe is more expensive to make than buying the jar alfredo sauce.  I doubled the recipe and the parmesan cheese alone costs over $7!  I will stick with the jar sauce and watch for sales and coupons before I would try this again.  For a family of 4 or 5 this recipe is a must to double as one batch only makes a small saucepan worth.

Very easy and tasty, but not exactly Alfredo sauce--the taste of cream cheese was quite noticeable.

This worked ok, though I probably will revert back to a "true" alfredo sauce in the future.  I used 4 cloves fresh minced garlic, rather than garlic powder.  Only used 1c of milk, rather than two; 2c of milk would have made this too thin & runny. Doubled the parmesan.  These changes made a good thickness for this sauce. Because the parmesan wasn't melting well, I ran it through the blender and it came out smooth.

WOW!  An easy and impressive Alfredo sauce; and with less fat than the real deal, I daresay.  I used Neufchatel to lower the cream-cheese fat even further.  Only other change I made was using 4 cloves of fresh garlic put through a fine garlic press instead of the garlic powder.  Such a simple and TASTY recipe; thanks!

This was awesome, I have another recipe that uses heavy cream instead of milk and it tastes identical!  It is one of our favorites but now I'll use this one instead!  I only added a touch more parmesan cheese to make it a little thicker and a little bit of garlic salt w/parsley to give it that little something extra, this is great!!!

This was wonderful!! It was my first attempt at making alfredo sauce  and it turned out delish! I will make sure I use unsalted butter next time as the parmesan is salty enough for my taste. Thanks so much for the recipe!

This was super easy and as great as everyone said it is!  It took a little longer than 5 minutes to thicken, but was well worth the wait!  I served it over pasta and topped it with sliced grilled chicken.  My husband and (2) boys loved it!  Thanks for the great recipe~I'll make it again!

Wonderful sauce and very easy to make! I made this for the Seafood Lasagna II recipe also on this site.  It was delicious, but VERY fattening, I'm afraid!  I do definitely recommend making this alfredo sauce rather than buying one already made in the jar at the grocery store.  The store bought sauces have a very fake taste to me.  This is more like a great Italian restaurant alfredo sauce!

This is so easy and it turns out great everytime.  Use stick butter for best results.  I break cream cheese into pieces then use a wisk to make it creamy.  Also we use almost a whole shaker of cheese. A lot less work than the original and my family loves it.  Our next attempt will be to use on a pizza crust with chicken and mozzerella.  Can't wait!!!

I'm not an alfredo sauce expert, but this was wonderful!  I used this recipe as a base for crab alfredo -- added garlic cloves and some onion and squash (sauteed separately to keep them from disintegrating during the cooking process).  Then added canned crab and served over pasta with bacon bits on top ... YUM!  Even made it with the reduced fat (NOT fat free) cream cheese and skim milk and it tasted fine.  Will use this often.

I didn't like this at all. It tasted like warm cream cheese and garlic powder. I even used good quality parmigiano reggiano. Not recommended for alfredo connoisseurs.

Delicious!!  The sauce was creamy, rich, and so simple to prepare.  I added 4 cloves of garlic to the butter while it was melting and omitted the garlic powder. Served ours with chicken and broccli over fettucine noodles.  Even our 5 yr old daughter said "This is delicious!!"  Thanks for the post.

I made this for my vegetarian boyfriend. Couldn't find vegetarian parmesan (most cheeses contain animal-derived rennet), so i used a little mozzarella instead. maybe mozzarella wasn't flavourful enough to cover the taste of the cream cheese... I found it too strong for my liking in an alfredo sauce. Will try it again with parmesan next time...

This recipe is fabulous!  I have made it many times now, and although its five star as is, I have changed a few things to suit my tastes.  I use 2 tsp of garlic paste because it has better flavor than powder imo, and I add about a tsp of dry basil.  Also sometimes I like to saute chicken and broccoli and add that in at the very end.  Taking about a 1/3 of a lemon and squeezing the juice into the sauce then slicing up the remainder of the lemon into round slices for garnish adds great flavor and an elegant look.  One thing I do recommend is using fresh shredded parmesan rather than Kraft grated or some such.  You can buy it already freshly shredded to save time, its usually near the fresh pastas.  This recipe is not only delicious but its versatile too. Can be kept simple for a side dish or can be combined with veggies and chicken or shrimp for a main meal.  I feel like a gourmet cook when I make this lol.  It's deffinately restaraunt quality.  Thanks so much Dawn for a great recipe!

Good basic recipe you can change around to your personal preference, i used lots of fresh garlic thrown in with the melting butter. Also put in a cup of peas, and some shrimp, very tasty. A bit runny, maybe i didnt put enough cheese in it, or should have let it cook longer.

OMG ... this is absolutely fantastic!  Thank you ever so much for this recipe.  It's too bad I can only give it a 5 star rating, it deserves at least a 10.

The Alfredo Sauce is all made, it's sitting in the pot (what's left of it).  LOL  It's not quite 5:30 p.m. and I have to wait until 6:00 p.m. before I can put on the Gnocchi (potato dumplings) that I'm going to pour this over.

I only made a half a batch as it's only the two of us and I'm serving the gnocci with Alfrdo sauce along with a ham steak. 

I doubled the garlic (the fresh diced garlic in the jar).I grated fresh parmesan but as I was tasting it I grated extra and threw it in.  Then I added some more (this time it was Tre Stella in the jar because I had used up all my fresh parmesan).  I doubled the pepper and used white pepper instead of black.

I sure hope the gnocchi doesn't ruin the taste of this excellent sauce.  LOL

I bought a lot of cream cheese on discount and since this recipe received so many rave reviews I simply must try it. Instead of using garlic powder, I fried it using the melted butter first, then add in the cream cheese, and I substituted evaporated milk instead of the milk. Turned out creamy, rich and lovely. If only my digicam hadn't been loaned out to my mates, would had made a good photoshoot. I also tossed in some dried parsley flakes for a nice touch of colour.

I will never buy alfredo in a jar again!  This recipe refrigerates well and made 3 dinners for my husband and I.  One suggestion I would make is to ensure that the milk is warmed through before adding parmesan, otherwise it doesn't melt too easily.  Very tasty!

I doubled the recipe, otherwise followed it to the letter. It was WONDERFUL! I served the sauce over seashell pasta for the kids, and for me I poured it over some imitation crablegs. YUM! I used the neufchatel cheese and skim milk, and it still turned out great! Thank you!

Really yummy sauce.  It didn't really get smooth after adding the cream cheese, but it ended up being very smooth and great flavor and the best part...so easy.  Tastes like a Alfredo sauce that takes a lot longer to make.

I made and served this with Pesto Chicken Florentine. I used about half the parmesean cheese, and it tasted great, easy reheated, and can be thinned with milk. Thumbs up for this recipe! Its going to my recipe box.

This recipe is true to it's name, it was very quick and very easy... not to mention very tasty!  I had actually made a penne pasta, brocolli, and chicken dish that was a little bland.  I made this recipe in order to add some flavor to the other dish and it worked like a charm.

Easy recipe but it was very thin.  I would add less than 2 cups of milk next time to make it thicker.  It also needed salt as it was kind of bland.  I did follow the recipe exactly using real butter and real cream cheese - nothing light.  Will try again but with improvements.

This sauce was so easy and SO good!  I put it over pasta, chicken (with more garlic), and veggies, and made enough to have leftovers, but it was DEVOURED!  Thanks for coming up with a great recipe.

If I could give this more stars I would!    I make this at least once every 14 days and any guests we have that evening rave about it.   We will grill chicken and pour over it with noodles.   Perfect!

I LOVE this sauce.  It is very easy & VERY tasty!  I've made it several times now.  I found that it reheated great... maybe because I used whole milk.  We sometimes add sauteed mushrooms, chicken &/or broccoli.  The sauce is super, served w/cheese tortellini.

Great recipe!  I upped the garlic by a teaspoon, because who doesn't need more garlic in their lives?  Sauce came out creamy, cheesy, and delicious.  Perfect recipe for homemade alfredo.

wow, what a great recipe! I used fat free cream cheese and non fat half and half and it still turned out great. My boyfriend who hates cream cheese had no idea this was the "secret" ingredient, he loved it.  I did add salt and pepper to the sauce.  I halfed the recipe and it still turned  out great.  Does not re-heat very good though.  This is a keeper.

Very good.  I did not have grated Parmesan cheese so I ended up substituting shredded Parmesan cheese and it worked out well.  Served over chicken & cheese stuffed ravioli.  Thanks Dawn.

This is a quick and easy recipe.  My 14 yr old step son is leanrning to cook, so we did this together.  The only changes we made were to use reduced fat/whipped cream cheese and fat free milk.  It was really good....thanks for sharing!

I would have to say that when I looked at the recipe I wasn't sure about the cream cheese, man I was so wrong.  The family and I loved it.  I only used 5 oz. of the Parmesan cheese, used minced garlic instead of garlic powder, and added shrimp mushrooms and sun dried tomatoes.  To make it a little less fattening I used margarine and 1% milk.  Turned out great!  Thanks!!!

This is fantastic!!!  My husband and I both loved it.  It does make alot so I added cooked broccoli, red peppers, mushrooms, peas, zucchini, onions, and halved cherry tomatoes to a lb. of angel hair and tossed every thing together.  It reheated very well as, without the cream, you don't have to worry about separation.  We lived on it for a couple of days and were as happy as clams.  Another advantage is the ease of proportion so you can make just as much as you need - even for a side dish.  Oh, I also added some fresh garlic.  My mouth is watering just thinking about this recipe.  Excellent!!

I made this for a birthday party dinner I threw. Used a really good, really firm, parmesan cheese and used roasted garlic instead of the garlic powder, doubled the recipe and added some salt and parsley. It turned out so creamy, yummy, and delicious it had my guests (even the picky eaters who swore they didn't eat pasta) raving! The sauce was perfect and didn't get dry or sticky. I was so pleased with the end result. I was a happy host who didn't have to spend tons of time or money on this dish. Will def. use this recipe time and time again! Thanks for sharing this classic.

This was the 2nd time I have attempted to make alfredo from scratch, and this one was a hit! Both my girls even said they liked it better than the jar sauce I usually buy. I only gave it 4 stars because it isn't quite the same consistency as a real alfredo, but it was good. Best of all, I usually have all of these ingredients on hand. Awesome! Thanks!

This turned out really good. I used the canned parmesan cheese and the sauce was a little grainy, like it didnt melt, but it was still very good.

This sauce is great. It doesnt seperate like alfredo sauces made using thick cream. Those still taste good of course, they just look really gross! This tastes good and looks appealing as well!

Busy night and you want to slap something comforting together? Thank you, Dawn, this is it! It is a bit cream-cheesy, but you can dink around with it a little with garlic, maybe some sauté onions and/or ‘shrooms, some ham (I did all of that, and a couple of drops of Tabasco at the end – stole that idea from James Beard--) and make something quite nice, quite easy and real quick...and ya gotta love that in a dinner! I’m clapping my wooden spoons in applause for this one!

I made this and used it with shrimp and scallops.  It was sooooo good.  I used margarine instead of butter and had some problems with the cream cheese melting and blending in with the margarine. Once I started adding the milk into the mixture it all worked out fine. Will use butter next time! Makes a lot of sauce, so make a lot of noodles!

I was a bit skeptical, because when I added the cream cheese to the butter, it just became clumpy and not smooth at all.  I went ahead and started adding the milk and whisking it - it turned out perfect.  The flavor wasn't very strong, so I may add more cheese next time.  The consistency was perfect, although I may take some other suggestions and add parsley and chives next time.  Thanks for a great homemade alfredo sauce!

I have used the same alfredo recipe for years and decided to take a peek at the ones on this site.  I am so glad I did!  This recipe blows my old one out of the water!!  It was creamy and delicious.  I served it over chicken & veggies and the entire family went nuts for it.  Wasn't sure about the cream cheese but it was the ingredient that tied it all together.  I have already shared it and will continue to use this one.

Yum!! We are very picky about alfredo sauce, and we both loved it. The kids (2yrs and 3yrs) loved it too, which is saying something. The cream cheese made it pretty rich, so I might reduce that a bit next time, but otherwise it was great.

Excellent! This was so easy and exactly what I was looking for in an alfredo sauce. My family loved it and I'll be making it again. My only recommendations are to add more salt and more garlic (personal preference). I'm also going to try it with lower fat cream cheese just to decrease some of the high fat content.

This alfredo sauce was awesome! It was quick and delicious and my family loved it! My one suggestion is to put it way more ground pepper.  1/8 teaspoon is definitely not enough! But it was great anyway!

Creamy and delicious!  I used low fat cream cheese and used 2% milk and Fat-free coffee creamer (not flavored) and it still tasted great.  I mixed in some fresh lump crab meat, served a Caesar salad and garlic bread and had a wonderfully satisfying meal!  Who would have thought cream cheese alfredo sauce would taste so yummy?  :o)

This is so rich and creamy! I love to make a low fat version using nonfat cream cheese and cut the butter in half.  I promise you won't even notice the difference! Have fettucine alfredo on a regular basis!

Very easy and quick to make.  I used 4 cloves of minced garlic,rather than the garlic powder, and sauted in the butter for a few minutes.  Also cranked in more fresh ground pepper before serving.  I would suggest that it makes at least 6 to 8 servings of sauce.

This sauce is very close to an alfredo sauce at a local restaurant that is absolutely wonderful. Next time I'll add about 5-6 garlic cloves and some red pepper flakes. Overall this is an excellent sauce. Fattening but oh so worth it. Make it, eat it, enjoy it.

I was really skeptical of this recipe.  Nothing this easy can be so good is what I thought.  Boy was I wrong. It is easy to double, or even half, and is our favorite alfredo sauce hands down now.  It goes well with any pasta, or as a cream sauce for chicken breast or fish fillets.  Our favorite way though is shell pasta cooked with broccoli, julienne carrots, peas and cooked chicken bites.  And it does get very thick after it is removed from heat.  I didn't think it would at first.  Like I said, I was pleasantly surprised, and this is definitely a keeper.  Thanks so much for this recipe.

easy and tasty,  I added 2 cloves of garlic to a double recipe, maybe 3 next time.  The first time i made it I doubled the recipe, but didn't have 2 cr. cheeses, so I just added a little whipping cream (that I wanted to use up) and cut back the milk, just alittle.  I don't think you can ruin this recipe.  I will probably try this recipe with lemon chicken instead of just plain whipping cream.  Actually, I think a little lemon would be good to this sauce when using as an alfredo!!

Great sauce!  I added some Bay leaves to it for some extra taste and it still tasted great.  Very easy to make and delicious. Thanks!

My husband and I have looked and looked for a great alfredo sauce and we finally found it.  This is the best!  We will never use anything else again.  I use less milk then the recipe calls for about 1 1/2 cups or a little less.  EXCELLENT!

This recipe is great, quick and easy!!  I used butter, light cream cheese and evaporated skim milk.  It worked very well.  After the cheese melted,  I took the sauce off the stove for it to thicken.  I also added a bit of nutmeg.   The family loved it.  This is enough sauce for 6-8 hearty sauce servings.

awesome! the cream cheese is definately essential to a great alfredo sauce as i learned from this recipe. ive made this several times and i found that its even better with heavy cream instead of the milk.

Incredible base - I combined this and another recipe that I love on this site - I added 1/3 cup of pesto and then shrimp to this recipe - it was great! I also used fresh garlic instead of powder and added salt and pepper.  Husband asked what I had done differently this time -  I told him about the cream cheese - he said this way was alot better.  Will use again

Very easy to make and cooks up quickly.  The sauce thickens very quickly so
make sure to start your pasta at the same time or a little before.  Absolutely
delicious!

This recipe is so easy and tastes just like a recipe a popular italian restaurant makes.  I fed
five people including 3 hungry teenagers and had a little left over. I added grilled chicken breasts and 2 cloves fresh minced garlic instead of powder.  The whole family thought it was awesome.

This is definately quick and easy to make (and tasty).  I did think that my sauce needed a little salt, but other than that, I followed the recipe to a 'T'.

This was awesome!  I am so picky about sauces and this was the best.  My husband loved it.  I might try a lower fat version next time with less butter and lowfat cream cheese.  I did use nonfat milk and did add the nutmeg.  I think I'll also add veggies next time. Fantastic!

Really easy and really simple.  It blows away any store bought brand in taste.  My husband even said it tasted better than Olive Garden's alfredo sauce.

Very good. I was a little apprehesive about using garlic powder but it gave a very nice garlic flavor.  My 2 year old loved it!  I have problems getting it to thicken, I think because I only had fat free milk.  I'll use something else next time.  I'll use freshly grated parmesan next time too.

Awesome!! My whole family loved the creamy texture and it was so easy!  It makes alot - and I feed 3 teens and 2 adults.  I also added 1/2 tsp. of dried parsley for some color.  Great week-night dinner spooned over browned chicken breasts and a veggie.  Will surely make again!  THANKS!

This makes more than four servings.  This is enough for six to eight people.  I added chicken, broccoli and fettucini to this and it was an good weeknight dinner.

Delish!  It even reheats well, and doesn't get separated & funky like Alfredo. I added some roasted peppers for some variation & color.

This is perfect, Dawn.  Finally an alfredo sauce with a little zip to it.  My husband always says alfredo is tasteless and watery -- this one definitely was neither.  We really enjoyed this and used it with spinach fettucine noodles and sliced chicken.  Thanks!  :)

I made this for my son's birthday because he loves fettucini alfredo.  Everyone absolutely loved it!  I have some comments though.  I took other reviewers advice and used 1 cup milk and 1 cup half and half.  The sauce didn't thicken up as well as it could have so I made a roux and threw that in and it turned out fine. Also, I will probably only make this on special occasions as it's so rich and high in fat and calories.  It's an awesome sauce nontheless!

Rich and creamy and sweet. I liked this very much though I added a few more spices to it.  The kids were not at all impressed and they love their pasta.  I think this is an adult  dish!  very good though thanks!

This sauce was amazing.... I fond it to be so tasteful and easy to make.  I had some cream chesse in the fridge that needed to be used up, so when I saw this recipe I was thrilled.  My husband doubted me the whole way when I said I was going to make Alfredo sauce from scratch.  The dinner cam out perfect!!  Thank you.... 

I did use the full amount of milk and it was think enough for me to cover a pound of pasta.

This was my first alfredo sauce ever and it was so delicious. I didn't have enough parmesan so I added some shredded italian cheese. It thickened it instantly.I also sauteed some chicken breast in basil, garlic, and salt and pepper. My husband loved it! Thanks Dawn!

So easy and quick to whip together. I used it for a spinach lasagna recipe and it turned out great. Such a nice change from the regular tomato based sauce.

This sauce has a great texture, taste, and it reheats well--not that this sauce makes it long enough to need reheating!  The family devoured it!  I am one to change recipes to my liking--I didn't do that with this one!

Made this in a pinch, because I was out of heavy cream. It was horrible. It was runny, tasted more like cream cheese than Alfredo. Had to use cornstarch to thicken it up and doctor it up with Italian seasoning, pepper and minced garlic.

I made a variation of this.  I used half n half (not sure how much since I don't measure anything)and I didn't use butter, I just opted for small amt of olive oil that I had sauteed my fresh veggies in. I used fresh garlic, mushrooms, grape tomatoes, spinach and the threw in a dash or crushed rosemary and 3 bay leaves then when was fragrant, I took out bay leaves and added shrimp and scallops. At very end, add fresh grated parmesan cheese till melted and serve

I’m not sure what I did wrong but my sauce never thickened so I had to add some flour.  Also we found it to be very bland  I also had to use more Parmesan cheese than called for. The amount of milk may have been to much but I read the reviews and it seemed like 2 cups would be ok. It made a lot of sauce, fed the four of us with a little left over even. It wasn’t a heavy sauce either even though there’s so much butter. I did use real butter as well. With some modifications I brought it up to what we like. I added 2 Tbl of little devil hot sauce, some old bay seasoning, more herbs more pepper and more garlic. While it was cooling I added my Shrimp, they were perfectly cooked.

I followed the recipe exactly and this Alfredo is DELICIOUS. What makes it even better is its simple and super quick. It take ls longer to cook the pasta than to make the sauce. I've been making this well over a yr. Occasionally I'll add a little extra salt or some garlic and herb seasoning. Be even without it, fantastic Alfredo

I made this for dinner last week. My kids are pretty picky and they both had seconds!  When you initially mix the cream cheese with the butter, it looks like a total fail.  When I added the milk, it all came together in a nice sauce.  I did not taste the cream cheese at all.

Really, really enjoyed this sauce. So quick and the flavor was delicious. I did sub heavy cream for the milk plus added addit'l  1/2 cup of whole milk to thin out. Other than that, stuck with the recipe. I'll never buy bottled alfredo sauce again.  Added to my repeat dish!

This sauce is delicious and makes a perfect amount for my family of five. I follow the recipe as-is, though I don't always have the full amount of parmesan cheese on hand and it always turns out fine.

It was quick and very easy. When I first tasted the sauce I thought it might be to salty, but when combined with the chicken and noodles it was a perfect balance. Will definitely make again.

I give it 5 stars after I made a little tweaking. I substituted 2 cups heavy whipping cream for the 2 cups milk, added about a cup of sour cream, and 1/2 tsp salt. Perfecto!

I loved, loved, loved this recipe and my son loved it even more. This was so easy, I added shrimp to my pasta dish the first time. I will be making this again on tommorow for our Sunday dinner and this time I will include scallops in addition to the shrimp. Can't wait!

I made this sauce substituting  2 cloves of garlic instead of the powdered garlic. I also doubled the recipe. Very easy to make! I tossed the sauce with one and a half boxes of cooked penne pasta and 4 sliced up chicken breast. Topped it with a 8 oz bag of Italian blend cheeses, parsley and a sprinkle of Tony Chacheres creole seasoning, baked for 10-12 min, until the cheese was melted. Served it with a side of garlic bread.  My family absolutely loved it! Delicious!!!

I made mine with chicken and tripled the recipe since we have family visiting. The only thing I would change would be more chicken. But it’s amazing and just as good as Olive Gardens too.

This was restaurant quality fabulous!  The cream cheese added a tang, without tasting like cream chessstook the suggestion to add a small pinch of nutmeg. Yep!  Added that extra-special flavor.  It’s a keeper!

I made this for my husband and I and it was very good! I didn't have quite enough cream cheese, so I added a little bit of sour cream. It was very creamy and we liked the little bit of tang. I also added some fresh spinach and cooked chicken and served over fettuccine. Delicious! Definitely will add to my collection!

I love Alfredo Sauce but have always found recipes that had too many ingredients I don’t normally keep in the house.  I came across this recipe today and realized I had all of the ingredients so I thought I would give it a try.  Great that you use cream cheese instead of heavy whipping cream.  It was so easy to make and was delicious.  I served it over spinach pasta and it was a huge hit at dinner.  This recipe is definitely a keeper and I will absolutely make it again!!

My family and I absolutely love this fettuccine Alfredo sauce! I will never go back to store-bought again, I have made this sauce over 10 times now and it’s my only go to sauce because the flavor is amazing and it’s super easy and quick to make! I personally have added 1 cup of Ricotta cheese, softened, to this recipe and the flavor gets even better!

Honestly think I like this more than making alfredo sauce with heavy cream! The cream cheese just seems to agree with the ingredients more, it combines better with the milk and parmesan, and tastes sooo much richer! My only suggestions for improvement are put a lot of garlic in the butter before adding the cream cheese and let it brown a little, and add some parsley (fresh or dried), adds a wonderful touch! I saw another reviewer say it's a little too much sauce for a pound of pasta and I agree, but the sauce tastes so great that we don't mind at all!

After reading several reviews I made this and also tweeked it a bit. The whole family loved the dish. I made a Cajun Chicken Alfredo Pasta dish. I added the pinch of nutmeg that  others suggested. I also used 1/2 c grated Parmesan and 1/2 c shredded Parmesan. I used 1 tsp garlic powder and 1 tsp minced garlic. We loved it and I will make it exactly the same again. The consistency was perfect.  Can't wait to share it with my daughter who loves Alfredo sauce

Very good!  Can't taste the cream cheese, and it makes it so wonderfully creamy!  Added a bit of extra pepper.  Will definitely be making again!

The only thing I changed was using 1-2 cloves of real garlic depending on the size. This recipe is fantastic.

Good for a quick pinch and my favorite  recipe. My husband and kids actually prefer jar (and used to complain up a storm when I didn’t  have it on hand) but now they are used to it. 

A few things you need to know. 

-Stop at one cup milk and add more slowly to reach your desired consistency. 
-Real Parmesan cheese melts slowly so be prepared. 
-The lower your milk fat the thinner your result will be so you may need to adjust your cheeses and/or milk amounts.

This pretty much the recipe that I used and its amazing. I only Sub. the mozarrella cheese instead of parmesan which integrates so well with rest of the ingredients.

Delicious! Everyone loved it. It needs a little less milk (maybe 1-1/2 cups) because it never got very thick.

We thought it was very good. Had just the right amount of richness in flavor and not over-powering. Will make it again. Used it with bow tie pasta and had leftover sauce to try with pizza.

OMG!  Quick, so easy and delicious.  My hubby is doing KETO, but not so much me.  Great sauce for bland chicken! I sautéed chunked chicken, then added rough cut onion, mushrooms and fresh broccoli.  Fabulous new “go to” meal!

My daughter and I love Alfredo with pasta or to dip our bread sticks. I just winged it with these ingredients. I used whipoed cream cheese, real butter and milk, kraft cheese because that's what I had on hand. I used garlic salt with parsley and crushed some black pepper over it. I just melted everything by mixing all ingredients slowly. It came out delicious. I highly recommend this for anyone thay enjoys going out for pasta. It's just like the restaurants. Maybe not authentic Italian but I'm not Italian so I wouldn't know. Thank you lord for this deliciousness!

I know some people hate it when recipes are tweaked. I'm not one of those people.  This was really good. It was smooth and creamy and delicious. I added about 1/2 tsp of oregano, a shake of nutmeg, and I had some nice ham that I cut up and added. So good.  Make the sauce on low heat. It's very easy and delicious. I'm going to be craving this often.

I followed this exactly.  Only change  (by default because it's all I had) was using  "I can't believe it's not butter" vegan spread instead of butter. I was very surprised! This was fantastic.  Oh and I added bacon bits! Delicious. Great recipe... thank you!

Wow this was super easy, and turned out SO good. Way better than any Alfredo sauce from a jar for sure and it’s nice that it just uses ingredients that you’re likely to have around. I just used the pre-grated Kraft Parmesan and it worked just fine. I will definitely make this again. I couldn’t get the sauce to come perfectly smooth but I think I may have cooked it in too high of heat - didn’t affect the taste though! I served mine on rotini noodles and it was really good! Also - appreciate how well this actually sticks to the noodles.

I made it with part cream cheese and part allouette garlic and herb spreadable cheese. I used heavy cream instead of milk. Then added the Parmesan and pepper. Eye balled the measurements. It came out rich creamy and yummy.

I've been using this recipe to make Alfredo sauce for well over a year now. Everybody in the family loves it! I won't use any other sauce. This recipe is delicious and blows the store bought sauce out of the water!!!

I raised 4 kids on this recipe!  Now it is made in their homes with their families. My oldest daughter still requests it for her family birthday dinner every year. Now I make it for the hubby and I, then take the left overs  for me and the girls at work.  It’s quick it’s easy, it’s delicious and it feeds and army.

This is my absolute favorite alfredo sauce! I use different pastas or different kinds of meat.  One favorite is grilled chicken with artichoke & mushrooms.  Smothers is shrimp and spinach.  I e done chicken & bacon.....plenty of ways to be creative!

Absolutely the best!! I made it for the most part as is except I split the Parmesan cheese with half grated from the bottle and half fresh. I also added red pepper flakes for a little kick. I was skeptical about the cream cheese but added it anyways and every one was right about it not really being noticeable. Definitely keeping this recipe!!

I followed the recipe and found it rather bland. I used the grated cheese like you put on spaghetti; maybe that was the problem. I think this a good starting point but think I'll play with it a little.

I will make it again but I will not add 2 cups of milk. I will reduce it to about 1 1/2 cups. I might reduce the Parmesan also and increase the garlic

I loved it!!!! I used mixed cheese and a pinch of parmesan. It was good but it was a bit sandy. But I bet if I had used the right cheese that it would be better. Mine tasted really good though. Like a slightly grainy Olive Garden sauce. But overall I LOVE IT!! I can no longer eat the jarred sauce anymore!

Made this for first time tonight, and was pleasantly surprised and all 3 of my kids loved it. I've tried making other Alfredo recipes before, but couldn't get it to taste just right, but this came closest so far.  The only change I made was using minced garlic instead of garlic powder, and I was 1 oz shy of how much Parmesan was called for, but it was fine.  Onky reason I gave 4 stars is because Alfredo is supposed to have a garlic flavor, and powder wouldn't do it on it's on.

This is exactly what it says it is, quick and easy. It's also a great alternative to jar alfredo sauce.  I used 2% milk and low fat cream cheese. Excellent!

I used fresh grated garlic and just over 1 cup of milk. I added mushrooms and spinach to the sauce and served with it tortellini. My husband loved it and said it's better than store bought.

I make this one often. Mostly I like the minimal level of difficulty to get a decent alfredo sauce. I will make this and use it in all kinds of pasta dishes where a white sauce is good to have.

This is the best alfredo is the world!! I have made it for years as is and it's great!  But with a few recent additions, it's superb!! If you have these ingredients, I highly recommend trying this! Add 1 tsp of minced garlic to butter. Then put in cream cheese and whisk until it is totally melted and you can't see any butter.  Add 1 cup whipping cream and 1 cup milk instead of 2 cups milk.  It will be very milky. Add 4 oz grated (in shaker) and 3 oz of shredded parmesan and whisk over low. If you love garlic as we do, add 1/2 tsp fine grnd garlic to sauce. Increase pepper to 1/4 tsp, 1/4 tsp nutmeg and  1/2 TBSP oregano. OMG!! HEAVEN!! Hint: While noodles are cooking, take sauce off the heat. It will thicken beautifully!

Great sauce! I did add a touch of nutmeg and a good dose of oregano, but followed the recipe exactly other than that. My advice would be use a good quality parmesan and keep whisking. I will definitely be making this again!

Easy and very tasty! I would just add the milk slowly, I only use a 1 1/2 cups.

I LOVE Alfredo sauce and have never made it the same way twice. This is no exception because I didn’t have cream cheese or milk. Soo I used sour cream and almond milk and minced garlic...it worked very well! My husband is picky with Alfredo and he’s actually having seconds as I type this!! Very easy and so yummy!!!

If I use margarine, it is a thinner base, and does not separate.  But we prefer butter and sometimes it separates, no matter what I did!  I found after finishing, rather than adding the last bit of milk, if I use a bit of the water from boiling the pasta, it smooths out, and blends perfectly!!!   My ONLY change is a personal one, we prefer roasted garlic to the powder.  I roast garlic every couple of weeks, and I squeeze a couple of cloves into this and it is AHHHHMAZING!!!

I find this recipe through an ingredient search. With limited ingredients on hand, I couldn't make  my usual sauce. Wow, how lucky can you get? I did saute garlic and onion in my butter per preference. I also roasted some tomatoes in olive oil, salt, pepper and garlic; parboiled some broccoli. OMG, even the hubs, who hates anything Italian, couldn't stop raving bout the sauce.  He ate his entire plate.  I did not use med heat when adding the cream cheese, but low heat. I continued low heat when adding the milk. BTW, I used reconstituted evaporated milk . There was no taste of cream cheese.......only a perfect sauce. This second-generation Italian now has a shortcut to a perfect sauce.  Buon mangiare i miei amici

Used real garlic instead, the cream cheese didn't really melt, only went smooth once I started adding the milk.  Added white and black pepper, nutmeg.  Otherwise, was a bit bland.   A good base recipe, although very rich and high cal lol!

This is the absolute best alfredo I have every had or made. My favorite thing about this recipe is that is can be tweaked quite a bit in a lot of different directions depending on how thick, cheesy, creamy, or flavorful you want it. It is incredibly easy to make and only takes a few minutes, which is a bonus.

AMAZING!!!!!! Didn't change a thing and it came out fantastic! 

Note: It makes a LOT of sauce so you'll have leftovers unless you're feeding 20 people; I put my leftovers into a glass jar from pasta sauce to store better in the fridge.

Amazing! I am not buying Alfredo sauce anymore! I used garlic salt with parsley. The would suggest reducing the milk to 1 2/3 - 1 3/4 for a thicker sauce. Too much Parmesan and the sauce ends up tasting grainy so I wouldn’t change the original amount unless that is what you want. For a richer taste, I would use half and half. Taste of cream cheese was not noticeable at all.

I did adjust the recipe the 2nd time I made it, and was happier with those results.  I only used 4 ounces of cream cheese and 1 cup of milk, and added one cup of heavy whipping cream, I also used minced garlic rather than powder.

I've made this recipe a few times now, and I just love it. The cream cheese gives it a great velvety texture without being super heavy, like some traditional alfredo sauces can be. If the cream cheese flavor is too overwhelming, just add more parmesan! I followed the recipe pretty much to the letter, except i used minced garlic instead of powdered, and added a healthy pinch of salt and oregano to add a little more depth of flavor.
I've also used this sauce as a base for a pasta bake and it was phenomenal.  I tossed with rotini, diced chicken sausage, spinach and roasted red peppers and topped with a little shredded mozzarella- bake in a casserole dish for 30min at 350. Delicious!

This was my first attempt at making homemade Alfredo sauce and it was a hit! I have to admit that I was a jar Alfredo gal but after my family’s reaction I will never use it again. The sauce was so creamy and definitely restaurant quality. This recipe was also very simple. I doubled the recipe and tweeked by using 3 cups of milk and 3/4 cup heavy whipping cream. I also added a little cheddar and more garlic powder with chicken and broccoli.

I have made this so many times and writing this review as I make it again. I make into a Cajun Chicken Alfredo, but this base sauce recipe is amazing! Don’t let your butter or cream cheese get too warm or it will separate (NOTE: it is still good when this happens, but it’s a thousand times better when you go low and slow). I mince some garlic and add into the butter (before the cream cheese). The Parmesan part can be tricky, but when you’re stirring it, if you see it’s starting to thicken up around whatever you’re stirring with, that’s exactly what you want. Be patient and it’ll come out perfectly! If you want to try a Cajun kick, use Tony Cachere’s Creole Seasoning (I like the “more spice”).

This is a wonderful and simple alfredo sauce. I added more garlic because we love garlic. After the sauce was assembled and hot I also added 8 ounces cream cheese cut into small cubes stirring constantly until smooth. I removed it from the heat and poured it over hot pasta. My husband complimented this dish 5 or 6 times during dinner. My thanks to the woman that sent in this recipe.

I don’t eat alfredo because I find it bland and unexciting. But I made this recipe because of the ratings and because the canned stuff just wouldn’t do! All I can say is WOW! This recipe is amazingly good and very easy. I used minced garlic instead of powder and I used the shredder Italian blend of cheese instead of just Parmesan. BEAUTIFUL!!!!

Made this receipe tonight and my wife loved it. Minced garlic and added bay scallops.  Light sauce turned out terrific. This receipe is a keeper.

WOW this was amazing!!! I made it exactly as listed. It was so creamy and delicious. I can't believe how easy it was to make homemade alfredo, and it tasted so good. I made it with penne pasta and baked chicken. My kids were in love. And my 6 year old (the picky eater) loved it so much he wanted to take cold leftovers for his school lunches the next two days. HA!

Very good and easy.  Beats the jar stuff and beats the  out of most of the expensive, time-consuming alfredo I've made over the years.  I did add a pinch of nutmeg and a squirt of lemon but it would've been delicious even if I didn't have those additions handy. (I also cut back just a tiny bit on the milk).

Perfect.  My picky 15 year old got herself 3 bowls of this alfredo with noodles!  Even the next day, I don't see that the butter separated like you often see in restaurant alfredo sauce, so I am planning on having the leftovers again tonight.  This recipe made a good amount of sauce, enough for a pound of noodles.

I made this recipe as originally posted and was satisfied with such a good tasting creamy sauce. I simmered the sauce slowly until all the cheese was melted. It did not taste like cream cheese to me. It was a huge batch so I split it up and froze it for future use.

This is some of the best Alfredo sauce I’ve ever had!!!! It beats Italian Restaurants who’s make the sauce professionally. The only thing I might do different next time is use a tad bit less garlic powder, but that’s just personal opinion.

This is great and easy recipe. I used it to make other dishes calling for alfredo sauce. Reminds me of what mom used to make for us kids to whip up a lunch of "milk noodles".

Loved this recipe. I’ve never made my own Alfredo sauce before. I will definitely make it again. Only issue I had was it didn’t thicken for me. Not sure if I should have cooked longer.

I was skeptical that the sauce would be too thick using cream cheese as the  base, but it's not too thick or too rich. My family is quite particular  and they LOVE this recipe.  I've made it now twice and the recipe is graduating to my personal recipe book.  Seems too easy to be this good.

Yummy! Whole family enjoyed it. I added 1/2 teaspoon garlic salt. I added 16 oz pkg of cooked pasta, steamed broccoli, and steamed red onion to the sauce. Easy and tasty and fast.

This was a great sauce! My first time making an alfredo sauce. It reminded me a bit of Olive Garden, which, I understand isn’t true Italian. But it’s good in a pinch!

It tasted great. I used half and half so it got pretty thick. It makes a lot as well. I froze the remaining. Hopefully it will be just as good when I defrost it for my pasta next time.  Pretty rich too. I won’t buy jar Alfred sauce again.

This was very easy to make and tasty. The author is right that it gets very thick; very thick! I think that I will add heavy cream and some fontina cheese next time to make it a bit richer in flavor. Will make again.

Was wowed by this recipe! I added some minced fresh garlic to the butter as it melted to add extra garlic flavor and instead of just parm, I had an italian mix  shredded cheese of parmesan, romano, provolone and mozzerella that I melted into it after the butter,cream cheese and milk were thickening.  Wonderful!

I made this with one tweek since I doubled the recipe but did not have two packages of cream cheese, I subbed with sour cream.  Of course added double the fresh Parmesan. Super yummy!!!!

Easy Peasy and Delicious! Made as written, except only a half recipe due to what I had on hand.  Had with chicken and gluten free penne! Couldn’t have asked for anything better! I did read the reviews prior to making and appreciated someone saying not to worry about the cream cheese looking lumpy until you whisk in the milk.  I did make the mistake of making it too early, as I couldn’t believe it would be that quick. But, I am now a believer!  Will time it out better next time. And, all the times after that, as this recipe is definitely a keeper!

This is my go-to Alfredo recipe. Much better and just as easy as any store bought brand. I don't whisk, I put the cream cheese and milk in the blender and put it into a pot that has minced garlic sauteed in butter.  Once the sauce is thickened to my liking I add LOTS of pepper and parmesan. Done!!

10.16.18 ... https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/19402/quick-and-easy-alfredo-sauce/ ... While I liked this, I probably won't make again. I thought it was going to be "quick & easy."  It wasn't any quicker or easier than the real deal using butter, cream & parmesan cheese.  I couldn't see the cream cheese thickening two cups of milk so subbed one of those cups with half & half.  It still didn't & I thickened with 1T cornstarch.  Maybe it was the cheese, but before thickening it was melted cheese on the bottom & eversoslightly cheesy milk on top.  I added the parmesan very slowly.  I made it to use with this ... https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/23425/pesto-lasagna/ ... because I'm certain freshly made three ingredient alfredo would separate.  'Surprised this didn't taste like cream cheese.  'Would've been okay, if it did though.  'Tastes like alfredo.  :)   I didn't add any garlic or pepper & used unsalted butter.

Good but would be better with half heavy whipping cream and half milk but since I didn't have any cream, I decided to look for a quick recipe that uses only milk. 
Changes I made :
Minced garlic in place of powder.
Added about a 1/3 cup of flour after melting the cream cheese because we like ours thicker. 
Then I doubled the milk.
And of course added chicken!!
It was a little too cream cheesy for my liking but my kids devoured it.  Next time I make it I'll half the cream cheese and I'm sure it will be prefect.

This was a quick and easy sauce that I was able to make with ingredients that I had on hand. My daughter came home from playing with the neighbor and said, "Mom, can you make that white sauce for dinner?!?!" as my friend already had it going on her stove. With this great recipe, I was able to pull off dinner and it turned out great!  This will be my "go to" Alfredo sauce recipe.

Good recipe. I’d probably use half the cream cheese next time because it was a little overpowering and thickened the dish ALOT. Don’t really taste the Parmesan so I might add more of that instead. I always like to add heavy cream into dishes that require milk so I definitely made sure to substitute half the milk with heavy cream. Don’t be afraid to toss in a healthy amount of oregano and basil as well, you can never have enough lol.

Delicious, quick and easy for sure.  I was afraid at first that the cream cheese and butter wouldn't combine but patience and stirring made a beautiful sauce.  I added cubed chicken breasts for a delicious meal.

This was an excellent Keto friendly sauce! I halved the amount of milk and increased the amount of butter. It still made a huge amount of sauce! I will be using it as a base for several different Keto recipes, starting with Keto cheeseburger soup :D

Best Alfredo sauce. I use the low-fat cream cheese and low fat milk, and it works perfectly. My family thinks this recipe is better than any restaurant Alfredo sauce. They asked me to make it every time we are having pasta.

It was probably a 4 for me but a definite 5 for my husband. We had to thicken it with cornstarch so it’s consistency was off so next time I’m going to try with slightly less milk and or sub it for cream

Acceptable but rather strange tasting. I think the proportions of ingredients are a bit off- too much cream cheese, not enough parmesan. It also needs salt.

I used heavy cream instead of milk and Mrs Dash garlic blend. The sauce was really good and easy. I would however suggest cutting cream cheese in cubes to make it melt easier.

It turned out pretty good. I didn't like that the Parmesan was noticeable. What I mean is that I could tell it was there because the sauce wasn't completely smooth. Not sure how to describe what I mean. Yet, I will be using this again.

Ok because all my pans are nonstick and all I had was a wire wisk after I heated the cream cheese w/butter in pan.. I then Poured it into a mixing bowl and mixed it on med until creamy because I was having a hard time keeping it together, then added it back to the stove for the rest and ended up putting my hand mixer over in the pot to be sure everything was blended well... Overall great recipe the kids & hubby loved it and I had a mess!! LOl Thank you!! I will be using this recipe again...

I sautéed Minced garlic in the butter and then added some shrimp. Removed the shrimp, completed the sauce and add the shrimp back in along with some torn spinach. It was excellent!

Excellent recipe, but I did make some minor changes. 

- I used 1 tsp of garlic powder and 2 crushed cloves of garlic instead of 2 tsp of garlic powder. 

- I only had to use about 1 1/4 cups of milk to reach the desired consistency.

This is my entire family’s favorite recipe (even our picky 3 and 5 year olds)! I have it over broccoli while the rest of the family has it over small shells. The only changes I make are I use real garlic instead of garlic powder, and I add a little bit more milk.

I did as one of the other comments suggested and reduced the amount of milk by a little. I also added more seasoning. I had a difficult time getting the butter and cream cheese to combine and have a smooth consistency at first. I ended up taking the pan off the heat  while I was whisking it and it combined more easily that way. It turned out smooth, creamy, and delicious! Would recommend.

This was my first time making an Alfredo Sauce and it was so easy and delicious! I used fat free milk and low fat cream cheese and served it over spinach/mozzarella ravioli - so good!!! Next time I make it I will add roasted garlic instead of the garlic powder.

Very good and very easy. Perfect for a low carb diet.  We ate it over chicken and broccoli. I substituted heavy cream and water for the milk to make it very low carb!

I wish I could give this zero stars. Cream cheese does not belong in true Alfredo sauce. This made my stomach turn and tasted horrible. The consistency was grainy, separated, and only somewhat thick. The flavor was completely off. It did not coat my pasta at all.

I don’t usually like Alfredo sauce, so I went into this with some skepticism. I’m glad I tried it! Cheesy and delicious, it went perfectly with the angel hair and shrimp I made. I followed one reviewer’s suggestion and added oregano. Soooo yummy!

I used heavy cream instead of milk and added dried parsley, oregano, and a dash of nutmeg at the end. It was the best alfredo I've ever made!

College student here, I made this dish for 6$ by using all off brand stuff. The sauce is going to last me about 5 or 6 meals. I added some peas to the sauce. This was amazing, my only complaint is that the cream cheese has a very strong flavor. I plan on going out to add more parm to the sauce, hopefully that'll even it out. I added Italian seasoning, oregano, and parsley, which tasted great. This is definitely going to be used again.

With some doctoring it is passable. I cut back on the amount of packaged cream cheese, added garlic, a little white wine and more parmesan cheese.

This recipe was fine, got a good dinner out of it, but I'm still searching for the right alfredo recipe. Followed it exactly as written and ended up with a good consistency, but it quickly soaked into the pasta leaving a goopy and grainy Parmesan texture. Maybe it was something I did.

I was not impressed with the outcome at all. For some reason, it just had no real Alfredo sauce flavor. Don't know what it was, but I won't be using that recipe again, sorry.

Used almond milk, and fresh garlic..very good! Too thin, though may have been due to using almond milk, but possibly able to thicken up by allowing it to heat away water. Also, if using fresh garlic - make sure to mince tiny and crush to get it to mix more homogeneously.

Quick and easy if you get all your ingredients prepared ahead. I cut the recipe in half and combined some garden vegetable cream cheese with the regular cream cheese and used 1/2 c. of heavy cream with one full cup of milk.

Tried it for the first time,  don't have the cream cheese block but I have the whipped cream cheese; added 1/2 romano cheese and 1/2 parmesan, 1 c heavy cream and 1 c milk, came out good, gets thicker as it cools. Also added shrim which I cook first in butter, then set aside and mixed with the sauce before serving.

I cannot stand canned Alfredo, but this recipe is so easy and so amazing! I don’t know why some people think it tastes too much like cream cheese because this is the only recipe I like cream cheese in! Perhaps they aren’t using quality Parmesan? I don’t know. It is definitely worth trying for yourself. My favorite way to use it is on pizza with a little Cajun seasoned chicken

Wow this was delicious.  And fairly easy to make, once I got past My own mistakes and faulty cookware.  Will definitely make this again (and again)!

I have to recommend using whole milk and real butter; that's actually in most recipes but particularly in one such as this one, where those ingredients are so important.  Also, if you have the time/energy/equipment, I cannot tell you how superior freshly grated Parmesan cheese is to the store bought Kraft stuff.  The difference is very pronounced.

I made a double batch and used one 8-oz wedge of Parmesan.  I also slightly reduced the amount of milk (I didn't actually MEAN to do that, but the container I put the milk in before adding it to the pot leaked a little).  Also used fresh ground black pepper, as in everything I eat or cook.  Buying a pepper grinder at the store is really not that much more expensive than a pepper shaker, and it makes a world of difference.

One thing that did horrify Me in the instructions though: using a wire whisk in a non-stick pot.  NO!  NO!  A thousand times NO!  Just use a wooden spoon or a non-metal whisk unless you feel like replacing your pot frequently, since metal utensils scratch up the non-stick coating unless you're REALLY careful.

All in all, this turned out even better than I could have imagined.  I used it on some pasta with freshly sliced mushrooms and a sprinkle more of Parmesan (just a sprinkle, so I did use the store-bought Kraft in this instance).  Absolute heaven.  It's like an

A great base. I added 5 chopped cloves of garlic with the butter, I was a little short on cream cheese,  my milk (2%) was slightly sour, and about 1/6th of my butter was old herbed butter. I also subbed Monterey Jack cheese (sue me), which I'm guessing is why it didn't thicken up much, and I don't own a whisk (sue me) so I used a wooden salad-tossing-fork.  Served with spinach tortelloni and a pinot noir (I like a bold red with a fatty dish) and it was great. Delicious and surprisingly forgiving, considering my weird off-balance ingredient situation, though the final texture was a little grainy. Maybe I cooked it too long after adding the cheese? This is a great way to use up dairy products that are about to go bad, and can handle improvisation. Did not taste like cream cheese,  but maybe ease up on the milk if you're using a softer cheese.

The very BEST Alfredo sauce I've made by far.  The creamy richness of the creamed cheese makes the dish all the more delightful.  I did however, change one little thing, I used fresh garlic and cooked with the butter as opposed to garlic salt and added a bit of garlic and herb cheese (left over) with the parmasean  cheese.    Love this and will make it more often.

Super easy and great flavor. I used fresh garlic as well as garlic powder. Topped with fresh parsley. Yummy!! Definately in my repeat dinner recipes.

Excellent recipe, especially if you're just cooking for one or two people!  I had a bag of Trader Joe's Chicken & Mushroom Pelmenis (yeah, I know, frozen pasta, I was lazy) and wanted to make a nice sauce for them; I didn't have any parmesan but I did have some nice Tillamooks white cheddar.  It grated beautifully and a quarter of the recipe made plenty of sauce for the whole bag of pelmenis; delicious!  Definitely a keeper.

I cut the recipe in half, because there are only two of us, but otherwise I followed the recipe exactly. The sauce never thickened. Maybe I didn't let it simmer long enough, but with all those dairy products in it, I was afraid it would scorch. It was very tasty, and we had leftovers, so when I warm it up, I'll add more grated Parmesan.

This is really good and incredibly easy recipe.  I swapped out 1/2 cup of 2% milk for heavy cream and it was divine.   I also used fresh garlic (about 1 TBSP) that I added to the melting butter.  Before you start hating me for changing a recipe and rating it, I had to get rid of the heavy cream before it went bad. 

Also - for those that are saying that cream cheese shouldn't be used, cream cheese can be used in most recipes as substitute for heavy cream as long as the recipe doesn't require the cream to be whipped.  I didn't taste cream cheese at all.

One really good tip that I could have used... this makes a ton of sauce.  Easily enough for 2 pounds of pasta (pre cooking weight).  I cooked only a small package of pasta, and had to cook a second box just to have enough pasta for the sauce.

I also threw in some grilled chicken and it was excellent together.  Great recipe and much  easier than traditional alfredo.

This was great and easy to make.  We halved the recipe and still had too much.  We used 1/2 cup (approx 3oz) grated parmesan that comes in the bowl and served with spaghetti noodles and chicken.

This just didn't do it for me.  I tried suggestions by adding oregano and nutmeg but nothing helped.  Also, with all the fat from the cream cheese I think I'd rather make traditional alfredo, then at least it would taste good.

So good and so fast! I actually needed to make this for one, so I cut everything into fourths. That normally isn't smart, but I went for it and it was so so good! I opted for garlic salt rather than powder and shredded parm because it was what I had on hand. Got nervous after I added the cream cheese and it didnt mix but once I added the milk it was so smooth and it worked so well! Would totally recommend.

If the cream cheese has trouble melting at first, add a little milk to the mix, and the cream cheese liquifies more efficiently.

Very good. I used half & half instead of milk though and cloves of garlic instead of powder. I love the cream cheese addition. Tasty!

I made no changes and this was sooo yummy! I love cream cheese, garlic and parmesan! I used about 5 cloves of fresh garlic and added garlic powder while butter was melting .  Hubby says I can't cook and i got a huge thumbs up! I will never use jarred sauce again!

Absolutely the best alfredo sauce ever! Better than Olive Garden! So easy! I followed the recipe exactly and the family loves it. I usually try adding or substituting when I try a recipe the second time, mainly because I'm adventurous. I will never change this recipe! Its perfect the way it is! Thank you!

Best Alfredo sauce I’ve found & I’ve tried quite a few. I like that this recipe does NOT include eggs since we have an egg allergy in the family. You don’t need to but I substituted the milk with heavy whipping cream. It comes out extra thick that way. But I’d use less than 2 cups. Using the milk gives you more sauce. But hands down the best Alfredo sauce I’ve ever made!

We loved this. I made it after church a couple of weeks ago so it was nice that it was quick. I did use a can of evaporated milk and a half cup of water to prepare because that was the only milk I had. I also put in a couple of cups of leftover cooked chicken and a package of steamed broccoli. I also used the bottled parmesan be once again that's what I had on hand. For once I did not have one complaint from anyone.  It may not be authentic but it was so yummy.

This is an excellent recipe.  So much better than the jar.  Going to make and pour over turkey meatballs for the crock pot for tomorrow's dinner.  Always keep a block of cream cheese in the fridge, just for this recipe.

I love cream cheese, but it wasn't like a real Alfredo sauce.  My son loved it so maybe I'll use less cream cheese and more of something else.  We shall see ...

This was amazing! It definitely tasted like I was eating Alfredo from a restaurant. Definitely making Alfredo sauce at home like this for now on. I did make a slight adjustment and used fat free cream cheese, half a container of parmesan, and 1 tsp of garlic powder.

I used a little less milk and more parmesan cheese and garlic powder.  I basically seasoned it to taste, with a pinch of old bay.  I agree with earlier comments that the secret is whisking and letting the heat slowly work its magic. THIS CAME OUT PERFECT!  TRY IT and your family will be asking for seconds and thirds. 

This sauce was awesome and easy for a quick weekday mealI!  I added grilled shrimp marinated in balsamic vinaigrette.  Hello, shrimp fettuccine!!!! Thanks for a great home cooked recipe!

very very yummy. I did add minced garlic into the melted butter instead of garlic powder. Don't be afraid to stir that cream cheese into the butter, get it good and creamy. I used half and half just for texture and about 7 oz of finely shredded parmesan. I added the parmesan in two batches to get it good and melty. Poured it over pasta with chicken and broccoli and my husband is now on heaping serving number 2.

Eh, it was okay. The problem, in my opinion, is that the name is wrong. It is "Easy Cream Cheese Sauce" *not* Alfredo sauce. My teenage son liked it. But having worked in a restaurant that served high quality authentic Alfredo, I can say that this just is not like the real thing. To the "lumpy" reviewers - use a whisk! Make sure the heat is not too high, too. This is more of a college student in a hurry recipe, not a bring guests over for Alfredo recipe.

Great! I changed a few things- used minced garlic instead of garlic powder & only like 2oz cream cheese & like 8-10oz Parmesan because I didn't have a full package of cream cheese. Also added a little lemon juice because my bf likes it that way.

Awesome. Easy. I used it for lobster omelettes and eggs Benedict too. And I didn't really measure anything, just threw it in, so don't worry if you're missing something or short on something.

A word of warning: this recipe calls for an absurd amount of garlic, and believe me, I love my garlic! I probably used half of a teaspoon and it was more than enough. I also didn't have enough regular cream cheese, so I used whipped cream cheese and it still turned out great. It will look gross and scary while you're mixing the cream cheese and butter together, but it will magically turn into a perfect, creamy sauce as soon as you add the milk. This is great for people who are bad at making sauces, like me! Everyone loved it!

Quick and easy was definitely the point to this recipe, and it did not disappoint.  This was an easy recipe to put together.  It came out very tasty.  I would make this again.  I recommend adding other ingredients if you want to make  it more sophisticated, like mushrooms, onions, or roasted red peppers.

My husband and I both loved this recipe.  So easy to make and very delicious.  Alfredo is his favorite sauce and after he tasted this recipe, he said it was the best he had ever eaten.  I will continue to make from scratch from now on.

I tweaked the recipe a bit.  I added onion with the melted butter, I only used about half of the garlic, and I added some cooked chicken.  I also used an additional 3 oz of fresh Parmesan, and I used half milk/half heavy cream.  My family LOVED it.  It is not what you would find in a fine Italian restaurant, but it is a hit at my dinner table!

Delicious but it makes a lot more than 4 servings - probably more like 8-10 servings.

We were concerned with how thin the sauce started out (once we added the milk and we only added 1.5 cups), but it just took longer than we expected for it to thicken. We topped it with shredded citrus pressure-cooked chicken and sauteed veggies, and mixed with spaghetti.

I've made this sauce several times and it's always amazing. This time, I made the sauce as is and added it to one pound bag of egg noodles. Then to that I added 2 cans of tuna and 1 frozen bag of peas and carrots! One of our favorite meals now!!

Delicious, I used more pepper because we like pepper, a dash of salt and added shrimp at the end, so yummy! My son thought I was kidding when I told him it would be much better than jar sauce and then he tasted it! I never use jar sauce and try to stay far from any processed foods. A keeper!

Great sauce. Didn't have any garlic powder or patmesan so I put 2 cloves of minced garlic in with the butter at the start and used a mozzarella cheese stick and a Lil garlic salt at the end. It turned out fantastic on top of some lemon herb chicken with pasta!

I've made it twice, and will certainly make it again and again!!!  I add grilled chicken, sautéed portabella mushrooms and sometimes cooked asparagus.  You can use this recipe and add whatever you want and it will be great (bacon for a carbonara or pancetta).  Just delicious and easy!!!  Almost an everyday recipe since it is so easy!!!  Grilling chicken or making the pasta takes longer than the sauce, plus this is a recipe that you can double or triple without giving up the taste!!!  Great for a leftover, just add a bit more milk so it isn't too thick!  This is now one of my "go to" recipes!!!  Be creative and enjoy it!  Even a bit of red pepper flakes to add some heat!!!

This is easy and can be adapted. I didn't have the required amount of ingredients so I made a 50% recipe and it was fine.
I used Half n Half instead of milk and that covered some of the "mistakes" for not having all the ingredients. But everyone complimented the pasta and sauce. It's a keeper.

I made this following the suggestions of some reviewers by adding nutmeg and Italian seasoning. I also cooked some bacon, sauteed mushrooms, and seasoned chicken to add to the sauce, but before adding, I tasted it.  It didn't need anything else.  It was perfect as it was.  Adding bacon made the bacon overbearing.  The mushrooms didn't make it any better or worse, and the chicken was not any help either.  This is a great recipe.  Thanks for sharing it.

LOVE how easy  this is! I followed the recipe exactly the first time. This time I sauteed 1 small onion and 2 garlic cloves in butter. Then added a few finely chopped mushrooms and sauteed until they were cooked through. Then I added 2 cups of frozen peas and about 3/4 cup cubed up roasted chicken breast.  I let that heat through about 4 minutes then transferred it to a bowl. I used the same skillet to follow the original recipe but cut the amount of garlic powder in half. After the cheese was added, I added a Tablespoon of chopped parsley and a few grinds of black pepper. Then I stirred the chicken breast mixture back in.  Just as it started to bubble, I took it off the heat and added it to hot pasta.

This is the best alfredo sauce HANDS DOWN! I've used allrecipes.com for years and this is the first time I was compelled to leave a review.  This sauce is sooooo delicious!  I followed the recipe as-is and salted to taste.   Thank you for sharing this "Heaven food", as my daughter called it.

I have made this recipe a ton of times over the past 9 years and it never fails that I need to make a second batch just to finish making the meal. Everyone comes and uses it as a dip with French bread, chips, or cut veggies and my husband has me make it for his specialty lasagna. I went a bit further and took a 10-12.5 oz can of chicken and saute it in a drizzle of olive oil, minced garlic and fresh sliced onions on low while the sauce and pasta finish up then mix it into the sauce. Pour the combo over any kind of macaroni you want and garnish with a dash of paprika (for color)!

Used Neufchâtel for 1/3 less fat but then ended up adding in more butter for silkiness,  so I didn't save any extra calories. Still far fewer calories than a cream-based alfredo. Quite good as a go to sauce. Will save the genuine alfredo sauce for special occasions.

We loved this recipe. I didn't have nutmeg as others suggested so I added a dash of all spice.  I also used half cream and half milk. The only thing we didn't live was how quickly the sauce thickened as it cooled while we were eating but overall it was a big hit!

The sauce tasted great except had trouble getting the cream cheese smooth in the melted butter. Next time I will add the milk and seasonings to the butter, then once heated, melt the cream cheese in the milk and seasonings . I used the sauce over cooked penne pasta with chicken that sauted in a little butter and fresh garlic. Added crushed red pepper, black pepper, and sea salt.

I have made this sauce a few time, and included some of the changes suggested by other cooks. I added shredded Asiago cheese and nutmeg. I also double the recipe and freeze it in portions for future meals. It does freeze well and once reheated tastes just as good as when I initially made it. I reduced the rating by 1 star only because it is better with the additional ingredients.

I was making a baked ziti recipe that called for a jar of Alfredo sauce, so I decided to make my own. One weird thing, I only have soy milk, and I didn't feel that would work here. So for the milk, I took a regular can of cream of chicken soup, and diluted with water to make 2 cups.  Instead of garlic powder, I sautéed 2 crushed cloves of garlic in the butter, along with 1/2 tsp of Italian Seasoning (herbs) and a dash of ground nutmeg.  I melted in 8 oz of low-fat cream cheese, then took the pan off the heat while I incorporated the parmesan using a whisk. (Adding the parmesan at this stage, and off the heat, avoids lumps and sticking to the pan.) At this point, it's a clumpy mess lol. Then I gradually whisked in the diluted soup (or milk if you're using that) over med-low heat. Despite being ugly in the early stages, this became the most lovely, velvety Alfredo sauce ever! Follow these directions and you won't go wrong. Note: My family really likes garlic, so you might want to start with one clove the first time if you're not sure.

One of the best Alfredo recipes out there! Only thing I do is add fresh minced garlic to butter and saute. This can be made in minutes and you can add precooked chicken or shrimp to dish. My kids love this.

I did change this:
I used 4 cloves fresh pressed garlic instead of garlic powder; 1 TBSP chopped fresh basil; and about 1 tsp freshly grated nutmeg for garnish. 
This dish was very good - even my very picky husband loved it. I served it with tricolor rotini (that's what I had on hand) and garlic sauteed chicken breasts as well as a tossed salad with Good Seasons Italian dressing and garlic bread made with extra virgin olive oil and fresh sliced garlic.
A very yummy meal indeed! I will make this again and again!

I halved the recipe since I was only cooking for myself, and I used a cheese other than Parmesan. It's really really good but I would add a little less cream cheese and a bit more salt if I made it again!

This recipe is amazing! It makes more than 4 servings, though. I doubled it and it was enough for two boxes of pasta. I added green chillies to the left over sauce to change it up and it was really good.

Great! I used 2 slices of fresh garlic in the butter, cooked 2 minutes. Complete the rest of the recipe, add a little sea salt, but don't over salt, add pepper, and thin with heavy cream. Top with parsley. Serve over ziti with Parmesan and chopped seeded tomatoes.

I was pleasantly surprised with this recipe - I found it to be creamy and delicious!  The only thing I will change up next time will be to add in some red pepper flakes to spice it up just a little.

This recipe was easy and gave that rich, creamy flavor a good Alfredo Sauce should have (without the heavy cream).  I used low-fat cream cheese and added 1 Tablespoon of dry vermouth (like white wine) to give it a tangy, savory spin.  Half of the recipe makes enough for 2 different meals for a couple...  I used it as a side over linguini served with grilled fish and for the next meal tossed with shrimp,veggies and rotelli pasta.  Next time I might add some freshly-grated nutmeg since it'll compliment the cheese so well.  It kept well in the refrigerator for a week.

It is a very good starter recipe, but we found it quite bland as is.  We tweaked it to: 
2 chicken breasts cubed 
Only 1/2 cont. cream cheese 
Roasted garlic - 2 cloves + a little garlic powder
1 TBS Italian spices
1 cup Parmesan 
Broccoli, carrots, and peapods (frozen mixed bag)
2-4 TBS flour with sauce for thickener before adding cheese & veggies.  My daughter & husband said it was better than any restaurant Chicken Alfredo they'd ever had.

I gave it 3 stars because while it was ok, it wasn't exactly a traditional Alfredo sauce. It's more of a cheese sauce. And i used shredded parmesan like someone suggested to get a smoother texture and it was still gritty and left a gritty feeling on my teeth. Gross. If you want traditional alfredo sauce don't use this one.

This REALLY is a quick and easy Alfredo Sauce! For those complaining...I recommend adding your own twist of flavor. I spiced mine up a bit with cayenne pepper and my own blend of special seasonings. It's a consistent hit!

My wife and I LOVE alfredo sauces. But we were having hardest time finding a favorite. This one blew the others out of the water. I like to add some chicken for a little protein and it always turn out amazing!!!!!!!! Just be careful to watch the consistency, it thickens real fast.

Easiest I have ever made, and very good. I will say that I had some whipping cream I wanted to use up, so I substituted that for the milk. It made the sauce MUCH thicker than I expected it would, so maybe don't do that haha. Still delicious though.

Made a few changes to make it a little less fat.  Switched to Neufchatel cheese instead of cream cheese and exchanged milk with almond milk.  Family loved it.  Definitely using this recipe again!

I used a cup of heavy cream, and doubled the batch. Poured over four cheese spinach ravioli. Everyone loved it. They were even dipping bread sticks in it.
It's absolutely delicious. Thanks :-)

The melted butter and the cream cheese would not mix together at all! All I really tasted was the cream cheese. This did not taste anything like alfredo sauce.

I love this! It's my favorite alfredo recipe and easy! If I am just making this for adults, I add fresh garlic. As is, it's great for everyone! I use coconut milk from a can for the milk and water it down some. It makes a great consistency!

UNBELIEVABLE! Can we get more stars for this recipe?? :) I have to admit, I wasn't sure about this recipe and expected a cream cheese taste to it.
I love  alfrado and I thought I try this,it was outstanding!! I loved it and so did my family I have made this twice already!!
I did add chicken, oregano, and Greek seasoning. I thought I'd give it a twist.

Please help me encourage other Allrecipe reviewers to not rate any recipe lower than 5 stars if they do not follow the recipe exactly. Why do people make changes to recipes and then rate them 3 stars? Makes no sense to me.

I think this was an excellent though basic sauce.  I may have under measured the amount of cheese but it still came out very good. I added it to a big batch of tortellini and added some spinach and roasted red peppers. My daughters loved it which is all I really care about ;)

I used both grated gouda cheese, parmesan cheese, fresh garlic and doubled the recipe, it  turned out AMAZING.
Definitely have this recipe saved for use more often.

I absolutely loved it so did my family!! 
I thought it was an outstanding meal; people who don't like probably didn't make it right .
I love Alfredo so this was a great recipe.
I never thought of putting cream cheese in alfrado. It was super easy to make and it was so creamy and delicious!!??
I added Greek seasoning , a little oregano and some cut up chicken.You can also put it over broccoli but I chose not to b/c I don't like broccoli but my other family members did.
Please help me encourage other Allrecipe reviewers to not rate any recipe lower than 5 stars if they do not follow the recipe exactly. Why do people make changes to recipes and then rate them 3 stars? Makes no sense to me.

I made this last night to use with some penne pasta and pan fried chicken breast. It was so delicious! Tasted better than any restaurant dish I've had (of chicken Alfredo). I ended up using about a third of the Parmesan called for because that's all I had, and double the margarine (recipe calls for butter, but the oiliness of margarine really helps the flavor and texture in my opinion). I had my burner on too hot so I also ended up using more milk to even it out. The end result was wonderful and cheesy and smooth

This is a really good basic recipe for Alfredo sauce that is versatile and easily adaptable. I tweaked it a bit by adding a tablespoon of lemon pepper and a pinch of nutmeg. Mix in some broccoli, chop up leftover grilled chicken breast with cooked pasta and it becomes the base for a great one dish meal!

Turned out great. Very creamy. But I made a few modifications. Used 3/4 stick of butter instead of an entire stick & one 12oz can low fat (2%) evaporated milk instead of 16oz regular milk. Only used 6oz low fat cream cheese instead of 8oz full fat cc. And I combined Parmesan Reggiano with Locatelli cheese, both freshly grated. Added cooked chicken pieces, steamed broccoli & angel hair pasta. Very tasty.

I loved it! Came out perfect to me. I added fresh parsley, minced garlic, and salt for a little flavor but other than that it was good. Next time the kids said I should've added mushrooms so I may do that. Idk what others did but I followed the recipe to the letter and it came out great. Way better than the pre-made sauce

Yumm!  Made it with a teaspoon of garlic and 1-1/3 cup milk.  Otherwise as written.  I thought it was delicious and so did my family!  It's a keeper!

Absolutely delicious. Only change I made was I added a bit of minced garlic while melting the butter. I did not taste cream cheese like other reviewers claim. Just rich, cheesy goodness. I will definitely make this again!

My family loves alfredo, and this recipe is the best!  We make it a few times a month and keep some in the freezer for last minute meals.  It's quick, easy, and way better than anything in a jar or even from many restaurants.

Made this recipe tonight and my 12 year old daughter said it was beter than Carraba's & Olive Garden Fettucinne Alfredo.....by far the BEST and her new favorite. 
I will say this makes a very RICH, thick and creamy sauce but you can add more milk and season to taste to tone it down a little or thin it out. 
We will definately make it again!!

This is such an easy, quick and tasty recipe. I would made a little more sauce. My tortillas were also to large; use the size on the recipe. I think this could be frozen for a quick meal.

My go-to recipe. Tastes just as good with half the butter, and shredded Parmesan is much easier to work with than grated.

Rich and an easy fix.  I used fresh garlic, only a half a cup of the Parmesan cheese and would consider using Neufchatel cheese as a substitute for regular cream cheese.

I'm in culinary school and I made a Alfredo pasta pizza and I used this sauce. I won a competition with it. I hate cream cheese and it tasted nothing like it so that was good. The best Alfredo sauce I've ever had in my life.

I made this with minced garlic, half-n-half and the kraft parm cheese to lower the Na.  Came out quite tasty and a good pasta alternative for my families dietary restrictions.

Really good! I added a little less garlic and it was a little bit too thin. Easy to fix by adding a little more Parmesan cheese. I halved the recipe because I didn't need as much. It was plenty. I definitely recommend this. Be careful with the garlic thought! :-)

It was ok/good.   Mainly it was really bland.

I did have to make some substitutions for health reasons.  Full fat cream cheese became light cream cheese.  6 oz of Parm (I use the real very salty stuff) was changed to 4 oz of Mozzarella & 2 oz of Parmesan.  I don't think that was an issue though, it tasted like alfredo.  I cracked a lot of pepper, added some salt and it was ok.  The texture was great.  The flavor was close, but again...it was kinda bland.  May have been my fault for substituting Moz.  but seriously, 6 oz of Parm (with all that salt) and all that butter seemed like it would be too rich.  Anyway, I'm ranking it as "Good" since it was "OK" with substitutions.

Quick and easy recipe.  I use 3 cloves of crushed garlic instead of garlic powder.  We also like to add about a pound of cooked chicken breast pieces and cooked chopped broccoli to sauce after it has been prepared.  Most times I slice up couple of a chicken breasts into bite size pieces and cook in a fry pan while making the sauce and noodles.

I gave this 4 stars because it makes a great base sauce but needs help to make it an awesome sauce. I doubled this sauce for two adults and three children( we like left overs). Besides what the basic list of ingredients I added 2 cups of heavy whipping creme, 6 small to medium sized gloves of garlic finely minced, 2 sticks of unsalted butter, and a cup of finely grated Parmesan cheese. I also added a teaspoon of cilantro, oregano, Mediterranean basil. overall the family loved the sauce.

I really enjoyed this sauce I made it a few times. First time I followed recipe it was very good. Next time I had chopped frozen spinach and cooked chicken to the sauce.  It was a very tasty dinner.

I only had sharp white cheddar cheese and grated Parmesan so I used a combo of these 2.  Sauteed cubed chicken breast in olive oil and a bit of garlic salt and quartered mushrooms with penne and rotini pasta.  Served with broccoli and was great!

Great idea to use cream cheese really wanted to try it. Had used plain yogurt in different dishes just to see what effect it had. Turned out very well and simply delicious.

So easy! I added minced garlic and parsley and I thought it tasted better than the jarred stuff. Will be making it again :)

Fast and easy recipe to follow.  sauce had great texture and flavor.  Changes I made - I used it for left over spaghetti squash instead of pasta, put in a tiny pinch of nutmeg, and garnished with shredded prosciutto on top.

Hands down, this is my go-to recipe for alfredo sauce and my family loves it.. I also add a couple of dashes of nutmeg to give it a little more flavor, but all in all, this is a great and easy recipe.

Very rich and tasty, but really unhealthy. I made the following changes: same amount of butter, 1/4 package of cream cheese, 2 cups milk, a little extra parmesan,  1 tsp garlic powder, 1/4 tsp black pepper, and corn starch to thicken it.

This recipe is fantastic. My picky eaters love it. Don't make the mistake I did by listening to those who say to add more cheese. It was too strong so I ended up almost having to double everything else. I did use the suggestion of 1 cup of half and half and 1 cup of milk, I also added a touch oregano. The consistency was perfect, no separation like some talked about, although I did whisk nonstop for about 15 minutes. I will absolutely make this again!

My husband and I loved this!  I had to make 1 change to lesson the fat content but it didn't affect it at all.  It was still very rich and creamy.  I cut the butter to 1/4 cup and used mozzarella cheese as I was out of Parmesan .  Next time I will make about 3/4 of the recipe as we had more than we needed.  I will certainly make this again.  Thank you!!

Amazing, made this for my fiancé when we first met because I knew she didn't like tomatoes.  We both love it and she gets excited whenever I make it.  It's so easy to make.  I cut the recipe in half so it's just enough for both of us.  Also, I do half garlic and half nutmeg.  The nutmeg really sets it off.

This is, by far, the best Alfredo recipe I've found. Instead of milk, though, I use heavy whipping cream. The cream cheese is what makes it so good. And it's super easy. I also add some Italian seasoning. It's so delicious!

I didn't make this. But took inspiration to make a crock pot chili with a cream cheese base. Yum!  I tossed 8 oz cream cheese, 4 boneless thighs, a can of pinto beans, a can of black bean, a can of chopped tomatoes with chilis, corn, sliced black olives and it was wonderful!  I sprinkled cheese on top when serving. Very easy and tasty.

This is a good substitute to traditional Alfredo sauce when you are fresh out of cream. Please please please use fresh, REAL Parmesan cheese. Not the pre shredded or stuff in a container, it truly makes all the difference.   The nice thing about this sauce is that it doesn't seperate upon reheating like the traditional Alfredo.  Also, fresh garlic is always better, I used 5 cloves.   My family really enjoyed it over spinach ravioli.

This is probably the easiest and best Alfredo sauce I've made. Rather than powder garlic I use fresh minced garlic. Then I fry up some fresh mushroom in garlic butter and add it to the sauce just before serving. Sometimes we add either cooked chicken or bacon to be served with the pasta and Alfredo sauce. Even with the mushrooms, the Alfredo sauce does freeze well.

This turned out great. I had the fresh ingredient to substitute, so I did - I used (3) cloves fresh garlic, grated hard Parmesan, and heavy cream for half the milk called for. I added about a cup of halved cherry tomatoes with the butter, and fresh basil toward the end. This time, I served with grilled chicken breast, but grilled shrimp is even better.

This was great!  I was looking for something to make with the ingredients I had in the house.  I used neufchatel cheese (french cream cheese), reduced the garlic to 1 teaspoon, used part skim milk & part whole milk (next time i will decrease the amount of milk slightly), and the big change was I used 1 cup mozzarella cheese and just sprinkled in grated Parmesan.  I would have used fresh grated Parmesan, but was out.  It turned out so well!  I'm going to throw away my traditional recipe.  I tend to have cream cheese in the house, but not usually heavy cream.  I find the jar Alfredo awful, but I feel this was quality of a restaurant.  My husband loved it too.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was so delicious! I did change a couple things (which I know people hate, but oh well)... I used lots of minced garlic (the jarred kind) instead of powder because I like garlicky Alfredo. I also only added milk until it was the right consistency. I made it once with the recommended amount andit was too runny. Great flavor and super fast! Also, it warmed up the next day well without getting oily like a traditional Alfredo.

I really love this sauce and everyone in my family did also.  I only added a bit of salt.  I am glad I read the reviews also as the butter/cream cheese mixture looks as if it will create a big clumpy mess but,  as noted by another user, adding the milk and whisking well resulted in a nice creamy sauce.  I added sautéed chicken pieces and mushrooms and I can certainly see the options to add shrimp also.  Delicious

This recipe was fantastic! My 7-yo son and I made this together. I thought it would be an easy recipe for him to follow. We followed it exactly and it turned out great. The only thing was that the sauce was a little grainy, but in fairness, I was was preparing it with a 7-yo who is still learning patience, so had we let it go a little longer it would have probably been perfectly smooth. It was a little thicker than my personal taste, so we did add additional milk to thin it out, but this does come down to personal taste. I did not find it to taste more like cream cheese as some of the reviews stated. We sautéed some shrimp in lemon, garlic, and evoo to compliment the sauce. My 7-yo loved it, as well as, my 10 yo. We will definitely be doing this recipe again. Next time, we may use some of the other suggestions like adding nutmeg and using part heavy cream in place of the milk, however on fairness to reviewing this recipe, we made is exactly as written and it was very good.

I made exactly from recipe. The taste was okay but you could definitely taste the cream cheese. Plus, the cream cheese made for a weird texture especially as the pasta cooled on your plate. The kids only ate one bite. I won't be making again.

I was looking for an easy alfredo sauce and this is great. I already had the ingredients for this tasty and simple recipe. I did add more pepper, I used 1/2 teaspoon instead of 1/8. It came out perfectly for my tortellini and my family loved it.

This has been by go-to alfredo sauce for about a year now.  I usually make it for just my fiance and I, so I halve the recipe and it still makes more than enough for 10 ounces of pasta.  I'm going to make it again tonight with chicken and broccoli.  I was never a fan of alfredo sauce, because the jarred stuff sucks.  I was pregnant last year and had all sorts of cravings for things that I usually didn't eat, and now this is a staple in our dinner repertoire.  It's so easy to make and I always have the ingredients on hand.

Yum! Simple and delicious! I had half a box of cream cheese that needed used so I halved the recipe and used a tad more Parmesan. Then stirred in a cup of homemade Pesto and a pound of raw shrimp, which I cooked for 5 or 6 minutes until they turned pink. Tossed with half a pound of al dente linguine and topped with a little more Parmesan. I will definitely be using this as my creamy base for pasta dishes in the future!

I made this recipe just as its written and it came out very tasty. What I like about it is that it's made with ingredients that are already in your fridge and pantry. Plus it's made within minutes! I'm keeping this one for sure to make it again and again when needed. My family loved it!

Turned out great. I used whipped cream cheese (since that's what I had on hand) and it was fine. It's not a real thick sauce which is what I prefer. I added butter sautéed frozen shrimp and crumbled up some cooked bacon and voila!! Yum yum dinner per my kids. Served pizza on the side and salad.

I personally added more pepper to the sauce and I would add some minced garlic next time on top of the garlic powder and I added salt and pepper on top of the pasta before serving. So good!! We are very picky and we loved it!!
I just made it a second time but the store didn't have shredded Parmesan cz so I grabbed a bag of mixed Italian cz  and sadly it didn't not thicken . Don't sub cz unless
You want it a more liquid sauce.

My boyfriend loves Spinach pizza, but it called for white sauce. Rather than giving up and getting a jar, I decided to look up a recipe in hopes of finding an easy one to use. I decided on this one, and I'm glad I did. He said it was the best pizza he had ever had, and begs me to make it again all the time!

Be forwarned, the cream cheese could be an aquired taste. There is a bit of a zing to it, as is the usual case with cream cheese. If you like cream cheese, it shouldn't bother you. But if you don't, you may want to consider another recipe.

I did go with pre-shredded parmasean, and even though people say to always do it fresh, I feel that with pizza, using the canned stuff was a good call. I didn't want the cheese in the sauce to be overpowering, since it was going to be covered with mozzerella cheese anyway. The blandness worked in out favor. However, definitly get FRESH parmasean if you're making this for pasta, which won't get a mozzerella boost like pizza will.

I love love LOVE this alfredo. It is so easy, and tastes great! I always add oregano, but it is very comparable to an alfredo at restaurants!  My friends turned up their nose to the cream cheese at first, but once it cooks down all you taste is the creamy cheesy goodness, and I made them believers.

I used a little less cream cheese than the recipe calls for. I also added oregano and nutmeg as other reviewers suggested. I was skeptical of this whole recipe, especially the added nutmeg, but it is amazing! My last alfredo recipe was great but this out does all my previous recipes.

I made the sauce following the recipe, with no alterations.  I was a little disappointed as to how runny it came out BUT the family thought the flavor made up for it.  When I went back to serve seconds the cheese had settled to the bottom and I reheated but it was still runny.  I will have to read through the reviews to see if anyone had the same problem....I should have done that to begin with.

Please use half the butter it asks for, you do NOT need as much as it asks.  Really doesn't need as much parmesan cheese either.  Also I had skim milk for some reason so used it and it was fine, with that and not as much cheese it took a little while longer to thicken but I would rather it be healthier than quicker!  Also I added a pinch of nutmeg as I do to all white sauces!  Oh, finally, I halfed the recipe to make an entire pot of tortellini for a family of 4.  And I still didn't use all the sauce, so I can't imagine I would ever make the full recipe.  Enjoy.

I just made this and normally I would read a ton of the reviews and then make my own version but I was pressed for time so I made it as is except I used really garlic instead of powder.  It is absolutely DIVINE!!!  I will be making this over and over.  Super easy and really tasty!!!!   I used really good parm also.
Thank you!!!

I did exactly as the recipe said but it was too much garlic. It felt fuzzy in my mouth and on my teeth. Not a make again.

I used margarine and low-fat cream cheese and 4 oz of Parmesan because that's what I had available, still delicious. I served this over fettuccini and served with grilled chicken from my George Forman grill and some garlic bread. My family of 6 clean their plates.

This was quick, easy and delicious! My husband isn't a fan of any white cheese sauce, especially Alfredo. I made this so I could bring it for my lunch. He wanted some for his dinner (which I thought he'd already eaten), so I shared?? He absolutely loved it! After 15 years of not making Alfredo, I can make it again knowing it will be a terrific success. I used minced fresh garlic instead of garlic powder.

Needs more than 1/4 teaspoon of pepper but perfect other than that! Made plenty! I thought maybe minced real garlic might be better but then not as quick. Very tasty w/ the powdered garlic though! Not super easy due to the need to stir constantly but it was very much worth it!! Can't stand the jarred variety!

I have not tried it with the grated (I call it fake) Parmesan that apparently keeps at room temp unopened, but I use the (real) parnesan petals, and OH MAN. Best Alfredo sauce I have EVER tried! I'm a cream cheese addict, so this is right up my alley, it's creamy and its cheesy!

This recipe I frequently make only half the recipe since it makes a lot of sauce.

This alfredo is the best I've ever had and it's SO easy! This is my go-to recipe when I need something quick and delicious. Everyone loves it.  I have  made this recipe with the "grated parmesan" and I have made it with shredded parmesan.  I definitely recommend using shredded parmesan.  The sauce has a better texture and the taste is just a teensy better (a more zippy taste).

I only made half the recipe and I used some minced garlic instead of garlic power, and I didn't have any Parmesan cheese, which is probably why it came out kind of thin and I used some powdered coffee creamer to thicken it, came out kinda weird i think but it tasted good, had it with linguine, broccoli and a chicken breast. Was a good dinner for one with some leftover for lunch tomorrow.

Best alfredo sauce I have ever tried.  I used just a stick of butter because I added bacon oil (I wanted meat in my pasta) I didn't have a whisk so I just used a wooden spoon.  I was afraid that the cream cheese would be just fried in the butter but adding the milk slowly made the mixture blend together eventually.  You just need to be patient.  Garlic powder and fresh parsley gave this sauce a nice blend of flavor.  This makes is a very good base sauce for any white sauce recipe.  I can imagine using this for tuna fettuccine or chicken breast + broccoli.  I will definitely make this again.

This alfredo sauce was DELICIOUS and is now my go to recipe!  Thick, creamy, full of flavor and very easy to make.  I followed some of Reg927's recipe tweeks:  1 tsp minced garlic with the butter,  1 1/3 cups milk, and about 1/4 tsp black pepper and a few grinds of sea salt.  I had no trouble melting the Parmesan cheese into the mixture (and I used shaved Parmesan).  The cream cheese is an ingenious ingredient; nice flavor but you don't know there's cream cheese in the final product.  My only advice:  whisk, whisk, whisk.  Don't leave ingredients to melt; whisk them gently together from beginning to end and be patient.  It will all come together.  I found the act of standing there and whisking quite calming.

I sautéed minced garlic in the butter before adding the rest of the ingredients...we are a big garlic family. I didn't add the whole 6 oz of parmesean cheese, I felt like that was alot. It was delicious!! I added some grilled chicken at the end that we had left over from dinner last night too. No complaints on this end. Super easy and tasty!!

I used the airy cream cheese as it was all I had on me and the sauce came out runny instead of think. Wait and buy the block cream cheese if you want it to come out right. I also recommend you  use real garlic over garlic powder, taste is better.

I am so glad I came upon this Alfredo sauce. So quick and easy! I cut this recipe in half since it was just me and still had enough sauce left for another dinner. My only change was I minced one clove of  fresh garlic instead of powder and sautéed in the butter. Served this over crab and shrimp filled ravioli topped with sautéed bay scallops.  Delicious!! This is a keeper for sure!

This is a perfect sauce!  I made exactly as written; there was plenty of sauce for pasta and breadsticks.

Love this sauce & have been making it for years.  I sometimes add a little basil, depending on the final product I am targeting.  For the record, 6 oz parmesan cheese is 1 1/2 cups parmesan cheese...I don't know why people write the weight of ingredients when they know everyone is using measuring cups!  Every time I make this, people think it is from a restaurant...very tasty (even my picky daughter will eat it!).

I did not add parmesan since I did not have any. Instead, I cooked mushrooms in butter before adding cream cheese and milk. It turned out amazing!

I don't know that it was any faster than a traditional alfredo but it's a keeper for me because I'm much more likely to have these ingredients in my fridge than a pint of heavy cream. I added additional pepper and salt to taste, along with a splash of white wine (JC lovers - one for the pot and one for me!) and some thyme. It was a little bland prior to that. Overall, great easy dinner recipe and the kids gobbled it up.

okay this one is the one.  I have tried 3 others from this site.  Only changes were 1 tsp of cayenne pepper, one full cup of parmesan cheese or a bit more.  Also used penne pasta.  Cook sauce on low heat for cream cheese to dissolve.  I used my cream cheese at room temp/

I USED A HALF CUP LESS OF THE MILK AND A LITTLE LESS OF THE PARMESAN.  I was cooking for one so I froze the rest and can then use it at a later time.

Only changes I made were to lessen the amount of garlic and use more fresh ground pepper. My crew isn't real big on heavy garlic. It actually served 6.

This is an excellent base for Alfredo sauce. What I did to beef it up a bit was to add Basil (didn't have fresh, so used dried). I started with 1/4 tsp., whisked it in, added a wee bit more (by the pinch) until I got the level of Basil that I liked.  I also added a scant 1/4 tsp. of ground nutmeg, some chopped freeze-dried Italian parsley.  I did up the Parmesan to 1 cup, though.  I was making Italian stuffed chicken breasts and instead of using a marinara sauce on top, I topped it with some of this sauce after baking them sprinkled with more Parmesan cheese before baking.  The remainder of the sauce I added to Fettucine, after blending in some steamed chopped broccoli for a side dish.  Serve with a crusty Italian bread, some herb-olive oil for dunking the bread and an Italian salad--complete meal!

Let me start by saying that I'm not a cook. I don't like to cook, and I'm not good at it. But, I need to save money and get healthier, so staying at home it is. Today, I needed some creamy alfredo to soothe my sore throat, and I was about to call pizza hut for a pasta bake when I saw this and decided to give it a try. So easy and so delicious. My two-year-old is scarfing it down. No doubt much healthier than pizza hut (used 2% milk) and much better tasting. I made the recipe according to the directions, but I used minced garlic - not garlic powder - and fresh shredded Parmesan from the artisan cheese section. This recipe helped to build my confidence!

Definitely creamy but it lacked depth or interest. We had to add a ton of salt to give it enough flavor. I'll be sticking to "Alfredo sauce" by Rebecca Swift (on this site).

Not everything needs to be gourmet, or exotic or twee. Folks, I had cream cheese in the house and little else. This recipe worked well. But do heed the warning that the sauce will thicken =quickly=. I only had the cheaper, powdery Parm cheese and I wouldn't recommend that; I couldn't get a perfectly smooth texture. A hearty meal for anyone in a pinch. Thanks!

Had a packaged sauce which left little to be desired; almost ordered out instead. Decided to try to kind a quick easy cream sauce to add to it. We made only half the amount and I omitted the pepper. Much better than any jar or packaged sauce I ever had. I love to chop up chicken into bite sizes pieces and bread it with Italian bread crumbs. Then cook the chicken until golden brown. Mix with the sauce when ready to serve. Nice texture ... great flavor!

I didn't make any changes this first time....and I LOVED IT.    When I make it again, I don't think I will do anything different either.  I did use organic cream cheese, whether this enhanced the overall flavor or not, I do not know.  oh boy though, yummy and easy and held up well in the refridgerator.

This is fantastic! I make it regularly and it is always a hit at the table. My only modifications are that I always add chicken which has been browned in butter. I also use skim milk because it's what I have. Certainly our favorite pasta dish. Thanks for sharing it

Great recipe!  I used a bag of Asiago combined with Parmesan and it turned out very tasty.  I added the milk and combined completely before wisking in the cheese.  The sauce was creamy and smooth.  I will be making my own sauce from now on.

This recipe is a keeper.  I did add garlic salt instead of the powder,  dash of ground nutmeg, onion powder and dried oregano.  I just love dried oregano.  I also added fresh spinach.  This is very forgiving and you can add any kind of protein or veggie.
It was very creamy and not heavy.  This is  the first time I used cream cheese when making alfredo sauce and it was great.
If the sauce gets too thick, you can always add pasta water to it.  I added a few ladles.

very yummy! instead of using all Parmesan cheese i used 5 ounce Parmesan and 1 ounce Irish Cheddar. Also using half and half makes the sauce creamer then just plain milk. other then that i  would recommend and  definitely make  it again!

Excellent flavor with the addition of 1/8tsp salt, 2 cloves chopped garlic sautéed in the butter, and 1-2 Tbsp chopped fresh parsley added at the end.  All other ingredients as listed. (had a block of parm cheese on hand so used fresh, finely shredded parm) This one is a keeper!

I loooove this recipe. It's quick and easy just like it says. And while it doesn't taste like authentic Alfredo, it's a decent substitute when you're more concerned with convenience.
I've also subbed the milk with almond milk and decreased the butter to "lighten" it up. It's definitely not as tastey that way, but it still comes together fine and the texture turns out like you would hope.

Thank you Dawn, for such an easy recipe!  I took the advice of Reg927 and used fresh minced garlic with the butter. I didn't have any parmesan, so I grated a hunk of asiago instead. I set my burner to low/medium low and stirred stirred stirred! It was smooth and creamy and delicious!

Well after finding out my G/F liked Alfredo and I wanted to do something a little more special on Valentines Eve then jar Alfredo I decided to try this recipe with Linguini .  I also picked up a jar of Alfredo just as a backup.  Well certainly didn't need any backup as this recipe was awesome.  She even wanted to take the rest home with her.  

I don't know why people are saying they can taste the cream cheese.  I couldn't at all.  I did have to make one modification, it called for Roasted Garlic and Olive oil butter from L.O.L. I didn't see that so I used just the L.O.L. Butter with Olive oil.  I will also try minced Garlic next time instead of Garlic Powder.

This is SO easy and delicious! I've made it as written and I've also followed others' advice and added some fresh garlic, parsley, and fresh ground pepper. I also use shredded parmesan instead of grated. My family LOVES this alfredo sauce. This has become a staple in our home. Thank you for sharing it!

I'm sad to say that I was disappointed. I may have done something wrong though I feel as if I followed the recipe correctly. The sauce was thin and tasted like cream cheese no matter how much extra parmesan I added. I tried to let it cool based on the advice of others who said it would thicken. It never did. Regardless of the thin consistency the taste was just meh. Edible but not memorable.

This was really good. I didn't change anything. I was glad I read the reviews about it not really coming together until the milk was added. I used real shredded Parmesan cheese--I think some of the problems with other reviews may be that they used the dried Kraft green container kind. It made enough sauce for an entire box of fettuccine with probably a little extra.

I made half a batch. I went by recipe but didn't drag out my measuring cups, hit or miss I did approximately the same other than I had a bit of heavy cream so I added it with the milk (skim) AND used my jar of chopped garlic instead of powder..I like both. Also I  had a bowl of graded parmesan instead of my usual "spaghetti" parm which will work ok as well.

No changes! Loved this recipe, family loved it. Said it tasted like The Olive Garden's. Super easy. I've made this twice in the last week!! I thought it might taste odd not being made with cream, but the cream cheese is what made it.

I tossed this with chicken and pasta.  We thought the cream cheese was overpowering and made the sauce too heavy.  But it wasn't horrible and we polished it off!!

Oh my good golly this was good! Really quick and easy, and especially good if you's craving something heavy and rich. Well, okay maybe mine just turned out that way because I made a few necessary substitutions due to the sparseness of my pantry. I didn't have any milk so I just used whipping cream, and I didn't have any parmesean so I just decided to use up the rest of a block of havarti I had lying around. Probably because of these subs mine turned out a little different- but hey, I'm sure the original is even better! In any case, I was  happy with it!

The only thing I did different was I added minced garlic instead of powdered garlic. This recipe is one of the best I've made especially the next day when I reheated it. It is very easy to make and I recommend it. My family loved it.

Made this to use in Lasagna Roll Ups, another recipe from this site and although everything was fine when I put it in the oven, it was a curdled mess when I took it out.  Ruined my whole dinner. Will not be repeating.

So here's my 2 cents... I used minced garlic instead of garlic powder. I added a 1/4 basil pesto and a diced up rotisserie chicken served on fettichi noodles. Very good!  I will make again but may alter somewhat more.  I did get the underlying cream cheese flavor

Since finding this recipe it has become a common me in my house. We love it! I don't measure the milk, I add it until it's my desired thickness.

Very nice! It's creamy with that nice garlic flavor. I used minced garlic (personal preference) instead of garlic powder. This mixes up very quickly. I like that it uses cream cheese instead of heavy cream, as I often have cream cheese, rarely the cream. Will keep this recipe to use again.

It's good but next time I'll definitely experiment because it's turns out extremely creamy and I like my Alfredo sauce to be a tad less creamy and it lacked some flavor though I'm not sure which one yet, hence the experimenting!

I made some healthy changes to this wonderful recipe!  I used only 1/4 cup butter.  I used fat free cream cheese.  I used fat free half and half instead of milk to give it a creamier consistency.
I threw away my old alfredo recipe and will definitely make this one from now on!

Doubled the Ingredients to make enough for 6 people and added some Italian seasoning  and frozen broccoli to sauce. For meat I baked 3 chicken beast @ 400 for 45 min with salt, pepper, and paprika. I cut the chicken into diagonal medallions and placed on top  of sauce ,over peni regatta  mixed with butter, garlic powder, and pepper. I am a stay at home dad trying to learn how to cook for 3 picky teenagers and they loved it. I thought it was awesome as well.

Followed as written mainly, except I used half & half for more richness and I added 2 pinches of sea salt.
I served this sauce with linguine, cooked chicken cubes, roasted red pepper strips and mushrooms . You could use any pasta really. I've used peas and bacon to make a carbonara. Great base recipe - a real keeper.

Delicious.  I sauteed a couple cloves of garlic and red peppers in the butter.  A 1./2 cup of butter was too much.  Removed  about 3 tablespoons  after sauteing the pepers .  Will definitely make again with these changes.

I only used 1/4c. butter and added 1 tablespoon minced fresh garlic to the butter, sauteing it for a couple minutes, then added lo fat cream cheese, then skim milk.  I only had grated parmesan, which worked, next time I will get fresh shredded.  We liked it and the lower calorie version is something we can have occasionally.    I liked it and my teenagers thought it was geat!  Am going to use this for an alfredo lasagna with mushrooms, italian sausage and spinach for our Christmas family gathering-can't wait!

Great tasting and easy to make. I changed a few things. Used minced garlic with the butter and added sautéed spinach, garlic, and chicken.  Very tasty.

I made this and my family loved it. I did make the change the someone else said to add cheese in the beginning with the cream cheese. I also added the  oregano. My daughter asked to not add the whole amount of cream cheese but I think it was fine. Needed some salt but otherwise it was great. Will make it again.

I added some Italian seasoning while it was cooking. Super yummy! My husband said it was the best Alfredo he'd ever had and went back for thirds! He didn't even complain about eating the leftovers the next day ;)

I used the alterations of the first comment on the page. I think the little changes like 1 1/3 and the 1/4 cheese made the difference. My wife lived in italy a portion of her life because her parents were Navy and she liked the sauce. Very good! Will be making again!

followed the recipe and it was too bland to eat.  it is fast and easy, but be prepared to add your own flavors.  See other reviews for lots of input....I grabbed what was on hand: sundried tomatoes, white pepper and some Cavender's.  This sauce could have seriously benefited from fresh basil and fresh garlic.  Maybe some asiago too....it just didn't have that "OMG this is so good" flavor

Quickest, Easiest and Best tasting Alfred I've ever made.  My granddaughter said I was no longer allowed to use the jar sauce.  This recipe is so quick and easy there's no reason not to make if fresh!

We tried this tonight, but all I had was 2% milk and with that much cream cheese,  it  ended up being too sweet for my taste.   I have another recipe I prefer that calls for less butter, only 3 oz of cream cheese, 1 to 1 1/2 cups of 2% milk, more parmesan and fresh parsley (and I add a bit of white wine). I think next time we'll go back to that one.

This is honestly the best Alfredo I have EVER had! Better than any jar, restaurant or recipe. The only things I did different was use 3 cloves of fresh garlic, a bit of fresh parsley and I stirred the parmasean in to the cream cheese before the milk.  It was smooth and flavourful with no separation and did NOT taste at all like cream cheese! This recipe yields ALOT of sauce. Probably enough for 2 meals. And that's great! Because it is soooo good!

The family loved it! I added chicken, broccoli, and three cheese tortellini. It was delicious and it thickened up the longer it sat. My only concern was the milk for my lactose sensitive family members. If I can find a recipe as good as this that is lactose intolerant friendly, then I will have hit the jackpot!

I followed a few of the suggestions and this sauce turned out great. I would use 4oz of parmesan next time because mine turned out really rich and I used real minded garlic. I ended up having extra sauce left over, used it for a white chicken pizza and it was delicious!

rich tasting, and easy to make!  added cooked shrimp, broccoli and pasta to serve for supper, it was great.  Made as listed.  next time I will add some seasonings as others did - maybe the dash of nutmeg and some basil.  but as shown it was a great sauce!

Made this tonight. Was pretty good, but next time I will probably add more garlic. Good base recipe for Alfredo sauce.

I used a little less milk and tryed the minced garlic as suggested.  I'll definitely make this again, but next time no minced garlic, the garlic make it lumpy, and a little less powered garlic.

I didn't enjoy the tang of the cream cheese.  I thought it took away from the traditional alfredo flavor. It wasn't bad but it wasn't traditional and I'm still craving good alfredo sauce for my pasta.

Thought this was fantastic! Only change I made was to reduce parmesan to 4oz and doubled the black pepper for personal taste.

My hubs made this for dinner tonight along with some grilled chicken - the end result was delicious! It was so fast to prepare, and even the kids loved it! He did use two large cloves of fresh garlic in place of garlic powder; as well, we reduced the amount of Parmesan cheese considerably (a heaping quarter cup).  We will make this recipe again for sure - delicious and on the table in under 30 minutes - it doesn't get any better than that.

Easy and Delicious! The only modification I made was I substituted the garlic powder for 2 fresh cloves of minced garlic. Mixed sauce with broccoli, chicken, and pasta noodles. Dinner turned out great! Will definitely make this sauce again.

The flavor was good, but the cheese cooled too quickly and was gritty. I will make it again but with a different type of cheese next time.

Super quick & easy!  I made no changes to this recipe.  We all loved this easy recipe.  I used this recipe because my "go to" alfredo sauce uses heavy cream and I didn't have that.  I did have cream cheese. My husband said this is hands down his favorite alfredo sauce.

Just made this, and actually stuck to the original recipe! It is wonderful, consistency is perfect and no need to add salt, the park covers that. This will be my go to alfredo recipe, but will most likely use reduced fat cream cheese and milk next time.

This was very good and I will make again.  I did tweak it slightly based on the other reviews. Instead of garlic powder, I sautéed a clove of garlic with the butter. I also sprinkled some black pepper after everything was melted together.  For this recipe I used skim milk and Romano cheese instead of Parmesan because I prefer the taste.  Also, as another reviewer suggested, whisk, whisk, whisk! I mixed it with cooked chicken and broccoli and put it over whole wheat pasta.  Great "Alfredo" recipe with just the basic items you might already have in your kitchen.

*Note to self: even if you think you're hungry for Alfredo, you're not! You never like it. The kids won't even eat it. Just make something else!!
 Couldn't get the butter and cream cheese to mix at first, (I think I let my butter get too hot) but once I added the milk (1 1/3 c) it blended just fine.

This Alfredo is amazing! I poured it over 5 cheese tortellini and served it with shrimp cooked in butter and garlic topped with parsley. I also served it with Parmesan crusted chicken cooked in butter with garlic salt, garlic powder, a dash of fresh ground pepper and topped with a little parsley and a drizzle of lemon juice for those who don't care for seafood in the family. It all was so delicious! A little steamed broccoli, small side salad and warm bread... Perfect!

My girls and I loved it! The only thing I did different was use real garlic instead of powder which I added to the butter and let cook about a minute before adding the cream cheese. Setting out all the refrigerated ingredients except the milk helps everything incorporate much easier, I had no trouble at all with the cream cheese. Tossed with some grilled chicken breasts and caramelized onions with mushrooms and it's hard to stay out of! I served this with a salad. Definitely a keeper!
On a side note this makes quite a bit of sauce, I made 16 oz of fettuccine pasta and still had sauce left over.

Just made it and I like it. It seems to be a very forgiving recipe. I didn't measure anything, and made it all in my vitamix blender. Tossed it all in and Just let it run on high about 7 mins to heat it up and it came out great! I added chopped dried garlic instead of garlic powder, since I was low on milk, did half milk, half heavy cream because that's what I had on hand.

I will make it again!

I followed the recommendation of adding minced garlic to the butter, and I added less milk than called for to make a thicker sauce.  I also used shredded parmesan instead of grated (because that's what I had).  Excellent flavor.  I will definitely make this again.

This Recipe was delicious and so quick to make. I do agree with some reviews that following the recipe as is, was a bit bland but I just added a pinch of some of my favorite Italian seasoning that I had on hand and it was perfect!! I also added some Jumbo Shrimp to my fettuccine and My husband who doesn't really like Italian food LOVED IT!

I WILL be using this as my favorite Alfredo sauce! I using fresh minced garlic and doubled the amount because I love garlic, didn't need all of the milk unless I was trying to keep it hot, longer. After tasting it I was thinking how I could use this as my base for chicken tetrazzini... Keeping!!!

Pretty good. I would make it again but maybe with fresh garlic? It was lacking something. Or maybe it was too much cream cheese flavor coming through? Also, my cream cheese did not readily melt and blend with the butter. Seemed to take a lot of coaxing.

Folowed recipe to the letter. The flavor was really really great. It was very creamy and better than any Alfredo sauce I've gotten out of a jar. It really is easy to make and even added shrimp to the pasta as well. The only complaint I have is how this site has changed. Again incredible sauce so good we had no leftovers. Follow the recipe and enjoy...

This was great! I used the suggestion of skim milk and light cream cheese. I added fresh sage and basil also.  I used mince garlic not powder and I added mushrooms on top of the pasta! YUM! Thanks!!!!

I tried this recipe because I lacked cream, but did have cream cheese to hand. This sauce has a pleasant taste and was nice over pasta with peas for a quick dinner. Unlike some others here, I don't feel that this tastes like an authentic Alfredo, nor would I describe it as "superb" or "excellent" but good nonetheless.  I also felt the sauce tasted heavily of cream cheese, but, as I love cream cheese, this was not a bad thing at all and I  ended up adding additional cream cheese to it.  I also did not have powdered garlic btw, and so used fresh garlic instead. All in all, more like a cream cheese sauce than an Alfredo, but good  for a quick weeknight supper!

Loved the sauce! Easy to make.  Sauteed chicken, mushrooms, fresh minced garlic and spinach to add to the pasta and sauce.  Enjoyed every bit of it.

I have been making this for years. I get so many requests for the recipe. The secret is the cream cheese. Instead of black pepper, I use white pepper. I also substitute whipping cream for the milk.

Delicious!!!! I love Alfredo but rarely eat it because the heavy cream upsets my stomach, so the cream cheese is an awesome factor here! I stuck with the recipe except for  substituting margarine for butter and adding some parsley flakes in!! Will definitely make again!!

Delicious! I used neufchâtel cheese, and nonfat milk for mine. Still wonderful, just a little fewer calories. Added some grilled shrimp and fettuccini, and it was to die for. Now I make it for my family at get togethers!

I wanted to make an Alfredo sauce, but didn't have heavy cream on hand which I usually use, so came on here and thought perhaps the cream cheese would make a tasty sauce (though perhaps not an authentic Alfredo sauce.) Some negative reviewers say their cream cheese curdled...cream cheese will not actually curdle/go bad, though it might separate and the texture of the sauce might have some lumps...In my sauce I used butter and the cream cheese did separate a bit when initially added but when I added the milk and my freshly-grated Parmesan it all melted smoothly together. One thing is probably key...use freshly grated Parmesan cheese. That junk that is pregrated has ingredients in it to prevent it from clumping together in the package, which also prevents the cheese from melting smoothly in a sauce recipe (same with other pregrated or preshredded cheeses...these are okay as toppings for things like tacos, but terrible for melting/using in sauces). This recipe didn't taste overwhelmingly of cream cheese, imho, as some stated, it wasn't quite "Authentic Alfredo" either, but it was a nice, tasty, creamy, easy sauce with ingredients I almost always have on hand so I will likely make it again.

It was very  thick and  had to be  thinned out a lot. 
It was good  but not what my kids were  expecting. I'll stick with  the  traditional  method  next time for  alfredo.

I was able to make this recipe which turned out well but I had to substitute a few items.  I found that I only had 1/2 a block of cream cheese and no milk but heavy cream.  I didn't have garlic powder but garlic salt and I added two tablespoons of sugar.  It turned out really good.  My son says it had great flavor.

It was very very easy to make I did do alor of adding to it. Adding sautéed mushrooms, red peppers, red onion, and shrimp. The whisk is a must have and you have to be prep
 To keep stirring. I did have a small problem with the parmesan being grainy but I added heavy cream and more milk and turned the heat up a tad and that solved that. I also added oregano, cajun seasoning, onion powder, and nutmeg(from other reviews) and it came out absolutely great couldn't even taste the cream cheese. It was smooth and the en the added ingredient OMG. My boyfriend loved and just keeps raving about my cooking now. This one will DEFINITELY stay in my head.

I love it and will use it again. The only thing I didn't like was how it looked a bit curdled after settling. That may have been because I mixed the sauce and noodles all together so after sitting when I went to put it in Tupperware it looked a little funky. After reheating and stirring it looked fine.

I didn't have Parmesan but I did have Gruyere!  I used that and added some chopped fresh basil and chopped fresh oregano. This sauce made my head explode with flavor! It was AWESOME. I don't think I'll be able to buy alfredo in a jar ever again after this.

I couldn't even wait to finish eating this to rate it. Superb and easy to make. My only change was fresh garlic instead of garlic powder. I let the butter and garlic simmer just a bit before adding the cream cheese. Wonderful!

I was pleasantly surprised with the cream cheese.  I did use my chicken drippings along with garlic, scallions and fresh herbs (in cheese cloth) and white wine reduction before adding the cream cheese and milk.  The sauce easily allows for lots of herbs and garlic so don't be shy in using them.  Brilliant idea!

Very good! I added minced garlic to the butter because we love garlic. No more jars of sauce in this house.

This was a fast and easy recipe. I did change it up a little by  adding sautéed onions, green bell pepper, and shrimp. My family loved and I will be making this dish again. ??

This was an awesome recipe.  If you do not want it too rich or oily, use less butter since you will use 8 oz cream cheese and 8 oz Parmesan. I used half and half only because I love my pasta creamy.  IInstaed of just Parmesan cheese, I used half Parmesan and half creamy cheddar cheese.  It was pretty good.  I even used fresh garlic instead of the garlic powder and added fresh minced parsley and salt.

I made this to go on homemade ravioli. It was perfect! Much easier to get the right consistency than other alfredo recipes I have tried. It kept nicely in the fridge, too, so later in the week I mixed it with pesto and tossed that with pasta, chicken, and veggies. I'll be coming back to this recipe for alfredo sauce in the future.

I've been making this for a few years now and I don't ever change a thing. I've added it to so many different dishes. It is so rich and flavorful, and EASY. And I get so many compliments. My very picky kids request it all the time, and even my niece (whose father is a chef at a big time restaurant) asks for it. You can't go wrong with this!

This is a family favourite - my kids like it better than what they get at a restaurant we frequent on birthdays. I can get home from work and have it whipped up from scratch in less than 1/2 hour :) Fantastic, delicious and easy!

I used a little less garlic powder so my young boys would at least try it--they both loved it (and they HATE sauces of any kind)!!! Easy Ingredients that were already in my kitchen in a must for me--however still tasted a bit toops much like cream cheese initially--easily spiced up with other seasonings!

Never considered adding cream cheese. I'm in love with the smoothness of this sauce. I added one finely chopped onion, about 4 cloves of fresh garlic, 4 finely chopped pimento peppers and topped the pasta with some fresh celery. OMG! Yummyness!!

Love this Alfred sauce. We saute ground beef and pork sausage, steam broccoli, then mix altogether with the sauce. We were out of milk tonight so I used almond milk with a little bit of heavy cream. DELICIOUS! Also, we only use half the amount of milk to make it thicker and add pesto which adds a lot of flavor. And BTW, the sausage we used was COUNTRY spicy.

It tasted great.

But, What the complete heckus is with the fat content?! I've got chronic GERD, and it flared up again almost immediately after finishing the meal. My wife made this with a recipe tonight, left this tab open, and I just found it now. I unknowingly ate probably half a package of cream cheese and a 1/4 cup of butter. I have told her like 15 dangbillion times I can't eat fatty foods!!!! Put a warning on this recipe, or at least add TUMS AS AN INGREDIENT

Quite good flavor that is flexible enough to accept lots of variations. I used the full amount of 2% milk and 1/3 less fat cream cheese. Chives and Green Onions added some color and flavor...with the combo of smashed and chopped garlic clove w/ World Spice Garlic Granules...Whole Wheat Fettuccine is cooking. The Grilled Salmon I recipe will go w/ the pasta.

I love this recipe! The only change I make is using 1 teaspoon minced garlic instead of 2 teaspoons powered. I just prefer minced. Sometimes I cook a pound of ground chicken in another pan and add it this sauce when it's finished for a simple chicken Alfredo. This makes a lot of sauce. I can mix it with an entire box of cooked pasta and it coats all of it. I do not but jar Alfredo sauce anymore since finding this recipe. :-)

I made the recipe exactly as listed and it's good. But I think I'll use just a little less Parmesan cheese next time because it's a little gritty for me.

So it's not authentic, but five stars because this is so yummy, easy and used ingredients on hand when I didn't have cream. This also has fewer calories than a full cream version, especially if neufchatel is used. I have made a number of times now, once subbing Pecorino Romano for the Parmesan. I learned not to sub a slicing cheese...it clumps, but I managed to salvage a batch made with provalone by stirring in 2 tablespoons of roux (2 Tbsp. butter & flour cooked together) which dissolved the clumps, and I added a few ounces of Parm at the end.  My picky grandkids, 5, 7 & 8,  lap this up each time, even with canned clams added to the mix. It is one of the dishes they request on a regular basis.

good, very very rich though. i guess i could have thinned out the sauce with more milk, but i followed exactly. great flavor though and no hint of the cream cheese, just very heavy. I would make it again, just with it being thinned out.

I have made this several times now, and I absolutely love it! A few times I didn't add the parmesan, and it still turned out quite lovely. I add either canned or cooked chicken when it is finished and it makes it perfect!

This sauce is AMAZING! I use minced garlic instead of powder and cut the milk back 1/2 cup. Makes a great sauce for homemade white pizza.

Love it! Tastes even better the next day, and doesn't get all weird and oily after being microwaved. I like to make this with chicken, broccoli and mushrooms. Don't worry if your sauce seems too thin when you're cooking it. It'll thicken a bunch as it cools!

My wife and I love this! The only thing I changed when I made it a second time is cutting the milk I added in half, not because it didn't taste good but because my wife loves her alfredo sauce really thick. Excellent recipe!

We loved this! Flavor was perfect. Sauce never thickened so I placed cooked fettuccine noodles and sliced grilled chicken in a baking dish then poured sauce over it. Baked 20 minutes, let cool 10 minutes and sauce was the perfect consistency. Will be making this for guests in the future....

The greatest Alfredo sauce I have EVER made! I did not have garlic powder so I used one clove of real garlic and added some garlic salt. I even grilled some chicken with Italian seasoning on my george foreman, cut/shredded it, and added it to the mix. SO GOOD! And I'm carving it again now.

Great recipe! I like it to have a bit more kick personally, so a bit of cayenne did the trick. But as is, it's perfect for family members who don't tolerate much spice.

This recipe makes a really good Alfredo sauce. My husband and I both loved it ( he usually complains when I tell him we are having Alfredo anything for dinner). I made the mistake of using kraft Parmesan because it was all I had and it was very gritty.  Will definately use real Parmesan cheese next time.

This recipe is delicious. However, I did change it up a tiny bit using just 1 1/3 cup milk (like another person suggested) and I used about 1 1/12 tsp. of garlic paste instead of the powder (I love me some garlic hehe).

I love cheese so I use the whole container of parmesan and it turns out great every time. I also use basil and other Italian seasoning in it. It also refrigerates and heats up beautifully. A fav of my family!

Makes a lot! I will probably have enough for 2 different recipes (the one I used it for and then one other). (UPDATE: I did have enough for both of my recipes).

I didn't make any changes, made exactly as the recipe states. I did use fresh grated Parmesan rather than the pre-packaged stuff though. 

UPDATE: With the first recipe I made, a Pesto Alfredo Chicken pasta casserole it was great, but the pesto added a lot of flavor. But with just plain chicken fettuccine Alfredo it was a little bit bland. Next time I'm going to try adding some oregano, garlic salt, and minced garlic (we love our garlic here lol).

P.S. This freezes great! After making this for my initial recipe I had about 12oz left over and I froze it in a freezer-safe container. To re-heat I heated it in a saucepan over low heat and added a splash of milk. It came out great! So if you're a make-and-freeze kind of person, this is a great recipe for that.

Have made as is written and it's great!  This last time I used asiago cheese instead of parm and it was even better. This can be made a lot of different ways.  Usually add broccoli and chicken.  Family eats it up and it's so much better than a jar and no preservatives!

This is great.  I added left over barbecued chicken breast to the sauce along with fettucine.  Since I only had 5 oz of cream cheese, I added sour cream.  I also didn't have 6 oz of parmesan cheese .  I only had about 2 or 3 oz of Parmesan cheese so I added cheddar cheese.  I still turned out great.

I was asked to bring Alfredo sauce to a community spaghetti dinner, but there was a problem. I had never made it before, so I went looking for a recipe when I stumbled upon this one. It was amazing! I made it exactly as written, but had no milk, so in my double recipe used three cups half and half and a cup of water with a little more to thin. I made it on the stove and it took almost a half hour. When it was ready, I put it in a crockpot on low to serve. Everyone loved it and asked for the recipe.

As Alfredo Sauce is my son's favorite, I was really hoping to surprise him with this easy sounding recipe. Unfortunately, it was butter soup. I followed the recipe to a tee. So I don't know what I did wrong. I would love to make it again. Any advice?

Cooking for kiddos can be a challenge. Especially if you want to feed them whole, healthy foods. This recipe was an absolute winner for us. My 2 and 4 year old gobbled every bite. I put broccoli in for veg but you could easily put peas or carrots. If you scan your dairy aisles for items with less than 5 ingredients (all of which you can pronounce) you can easily make this and feel very good about serving it. For garlic powder I used fresh garlic but, either way, it's such a small amount I don't think anyone would feel guilty about it. It's not gourmet but it will get even picky eaters to eat everything you mix with it!

Instead of adding garlic powder I sautéed 1 small chopped onion for 7-8 mins in the butter. I only used a 1/2 stick of butter instead of the whole stick. After 5 mins I added 4 crushed garlic cloves to the sautéed butter and onions. Then after whisking all the cheeses and milk together I added a lg. bag of frozen organic peas. I used tortellini for the pasta. Yummy

The first time I made home made alfredo sauce was with this recipe. I haven't tried any others since. I followed it closely, putting in an extra ounce of cheese so as not to waste, and it came out pretty darn fantastic. I loved it and still do!

(I had no problems with the cream cheese, I don't know what these other people are talking about...)

I'm not actually fond of cooking so this quick and easy recipe is perfect for me.

Thank you so much for sharing it!

Easy recipe, great taste!  I doubled this recipe and added a pound of penne pasta, broccoli, and the chicken I grilled out and flavored with blackened seasoning from krogers. This and a salad filled everyone up...even the 3 senior football players who are always hungry!

This was good, but a little bland. I added minced garlic as well, and added a little salt to give it a little more taste. I also added portobello mushrooms.

I had a half a container of jalapeno cream cheese left.  I used it and it gave it a little kick.  
Would recommend that minor substitution.

I just made this tonight and put it over penne with chicken and broccoli. It was amazing. My littlest little is somewhat of an alfredo connoisseur and told me that this on was way better than her fav hometown restaurant that makes their sauce fresh from scratch everyday (she won't even touch alfredo from a jar). I did make a couple changes just because it was what I had on hand but it was smooth, creamy and totally "alfredo-y." I used neufchatel instead of regular cream cheese and shredded parmesan rather than the grated. In my opinion, the grated never melts or blends just right. The shredded worked into the sauce beautifully although it did take a bit longer and a little more wisking. I used one cup heavy cream and one cup low fat milk (1%) rather than straight milk. I didn't have any garlic powder, however, I used 3 medium sized cloves fresh garlic chopped tiny and sauteed in the butter for awhile before I added anything else. I did otherwise follow the directions to a T and couldn't be happier, especially for my first time making alfredo from scratch! :)

This is the BEST creamy alfredo sauce.  Period.  It was super easy to make and quick to cook.  We were dipping bread in this sauce while we waited for it to thicken up a bit more, that is how good it was because we could not wait till we poured it over pasta.  You will not want to ever buy the store-bought sauce by Bertolli or any other brand.  Thank you Ms. Dawn Carter for making this for us! (^_^)

I know people don't want to hear how this tastes altered but I was just looking for a guide to making the sauce.  I was cooking for one so I didn't follow the measurements but I did follow the ingredients except for using minced garlic instead of powder. It was delicious and I think the cream cheese is a great addition since it may help the sauce stick to the pasta.  I wanted chicken with my alfredo penne pasta so I cut boneless breasts into bite sized pieces and sauteed them in olive oil and butter and seasoned the chicken in the pan with McCormicks Perfect Pinch Roasted Garlic and Bell Pepper Seasoning, salt and pepper and a dash of red pepper flakes. The chicken came out delicious and didn't go into the pasta as bland cooked chicken.

I love this recipe for Alfredo sauce! It's FULL of flavor & very easy to make. My whole family enjoyed it over penne pasta & topped with grilled chicken. Only made 2 little changes used to large cloves of garlic minced instead of the powder & added dried parsley for color!

Made this today and it was delicious!!! My husband's exact words "Super-Duper"!!! Only thing is, I used 1% milk. It would've been much richer if I'd used whole milk or even half and half.

Amazing!
I added some sauteed mushrooms and tossed it with grilled chicken.  Also added a few drops of lemon juice to cut the richness a little.  White wine would work nicely as well.

I love this alfredo recipe. It tastes like quality alfredo, contrary to what some have stated. The key to a good alfredo sauce is high quality ingredients. Use real butter, real milk (not skim), fresh grated parmesan (not canned), grate a bit of garlic (instead of powdered) and finally use Neufchatel cheese, rather than cream. All my ingredients were also organic, but that's not necessary. Heat it VERY slowly and keep the heat very low throughout and everything will blend just fine. Fresh, quality ingredients are key to this recipe yielding a quality sauce!

I absolutely loved this sauce!!! It is so easy to make and my family loves it!  I have been using the exact recipe for several years now, however, about 2 weeks ago I wanted to make it but I was out of Parmesan cheese.  I had a block of Romano cheese on hand and decided to use that instead.  And WOW!!!  What a huge difference it was soooo much better!! I urge anyone using this recipe to try it with Romano cheese just once. Even if you don't like that cheese (I didn't care for it either by itself)it is delicious in this dish!!

Just made this recipe, but changed a couple little things. I used low fat cream cheese and low fat milk. I also used a little over a cup of parm. cheese and upped it to a teas. of black pepper. It was amazing, my family thought it was better than Olive Garden. That's quite a compliment.

This was delicious! Very easy to whip up quickly. I was skeptical at the amount of Parmesan in it- I don't usually like powdered Parmesan- but it was really good. This took me a total of twenty minutes to make!

Awesome recipe.  Didn't use the entire amount of parm. cheese, but kept rest of recipe the same.  Even my picky kids said this was the BEST I've ever made.  Will definitely keep this one!

Sooo good!  I couldn't stop licking the empty pan.  I was worried that it would taste too much like cream cheese, but it most definitely did not.  The only change I made was using fresh garlic instead of powder.  Those who didn't rate this recipe 4+ stars must have missed a step.  I like this better than any alfredo I've tasted at restaurants before as I generally prefer a tomato based sauce.  Used this recipe for baked gnocchi, will be using it again in many other ways!  Thanks!

Very simple, very easy, and very good!  Don't worry too much about the whisk as I have found that a wooden spoon works just as good in the end (depending on your pan).

This recipe is perfect.  A sprinkle of chopped parsley is nice on top.  MOST IMPORTANT:  If you don't want it to separate or solidify, heat the bowls slightly in the oven before plating.

Loved this recipe! It was really flavorful and my family loved it. I did not have regular cream cheese though and instead used onion and chive cream cheese, still it turned out great. I also did not use all of the garlic powder that the recipe called for. I thought it was too much. I used about 1 tsp garlic powder. Still this recipe was amazing and I will definitely make this sauce again.

I absolutely love it my boyfriend loves anything Alfredo and Italian so I looked up a recipes and he fell in love with it. I tweaked the amount of parmesan cheese added more and add some salt and a pinch a teaspoon of flour while the butter's melting to thicken it quicker or some of the pasta water after your noodles are cookedbut all in all the original recipe is heavenly I will never buy Alfredo sauce from a store or jar again.Kudos to you ;)))))

This is an excellent recipe.  It tasted great and was very creamy.  I used chopped garlic instead of powdered as suggested, and added some fresh parsley (like in the picture if not the recipe).  I also used Parmigiano Reggiano which adds to the flavor a great deal.  I also use butter for flavor since it has the same calories as margarine and the health differences are marginal.

This is the best alfredo I have ever had!  This completely outshines Olive gardens alfredo.  When I made mine, my brother was supposed to be helping but he walked off so the butter burnt a bit, but it still tasted amazing in the end.

Very good!  I was scared at first when my butter and cream cheese separated and didn't seem like they were going to mix well.  After using my emersion blender it was perfect.  Ended up fantastic and my kids love it!

Instead of using garlic powder I used real garlic (2 cloves) and grated it up. I also substituted some shredded mozzarella cheese for some of the parmesan since I had the Kraft stuff and didn't want to use it all up. I did't measure it but went by consistency of the sauce. I thought it was delicious and my family enjoyed it too. Much much tastier than the sauce from jars. After I finished making the sauce I added a few big hand fulls of spinach, grilled chicken, and roasted red pepper (brushed with oil and put on the BBQ). Would have added mushrooms but didn't have any around.

Oops! Accidentally hit send. Anyway, instead of using plane cream cheese I used 4 oz garden veggie and 4 oz chive and onion. I added organic: blackened chicken thighs, spinach and mozzarella raviolis, browned brussle sprouts, spinach, and cherry tomatoes. I am no gourmet chef but this was pretty good!

I was nervous to try a recipe without heavy cream (I didn't have any at hand) and this was...amazing! Seriously, I've saved this recipe and plan on using it every time I make alfredo sauce. I rate myself a 1/10 in terms of cooking ability and I'm happy to say I was able to easily make this.

I really like this sauce.  It's easy & has only a few ingredients.  I did tweak it, as so many do.  I chopped a clove of fresh garlic and let it mellow with the butter as it melted over low heat.  Then I whisked in about 2 tablespoons of the cream cheese (I thought 8 oz might be too much for my taste)I gradually whisked in 1 3/4 cups of milk,then the cheese (I mixed Romano & Parmesan, because it is what I had on hand.  I like a thicker sauce, so I stirred 2 Tbsp cornstarch with the last 1/4 cup of milk, added it to the sauce and let it bubble until it was thick! Add some salt & pepper to taste...GREAT!

I liked this recipe but I think you should add only 6 oz of cream cheese, 1 1/3 a cup of milk, 4 oz of Parmesan cheese. Also adding nutmeg, oregano and real garlic enhances the flavor. Otherwise a good recipe.

Really liked!!! Was very easy to make, I used my vitamix to blend everything together instead of having to stand and stir forever. I also added rosemary and truffle salt to the sauce for seasoning :D YUM!

Love this!! This is the only alfredo cheese sauce I make! Don't forget to add a lot of pepper though for taste.

This was great! Delicious and I loved the cream cheese substitute -- much easier to find than heavy whipping cream. Thanks for sharing.

We just made this per the recipe but scaled down to one serving.  It has been too many decades ago and too few times that I have been exposed to what was very good Alfredo Sauce so I can't comment on its authenticity.  What I can comment on is that it went together very smoothly and tasted great. (Use your good Parmesan.) 

We used it as the sauce on a chicken and roasted garlic pizza (red bell pepper for color and black olives for comic relief).  A quarter batch was more than enough for a 12" pizza.  

This won't supplant red sauce as top dog on our pasta/pizza but it will add variety to our menu.  It is worthy of a company dish.

What would I change? Non è una cosa.

Tastes like eating expensive Italian!  Everyone in my whole house loved it!  I didn't have any garlic powder so I used 1 big clove of minced garlic and a couple twists of fresh black pepper.  It was awesome.  I also used super aged hard Parmesan that I grated myself.  This is definitely going in my weeknight supper box!

I love this recipe, I followed it to the letter the first Time and then I changed it to mine and my family's tastes. I replaced the milk with heavy cream and I only use fresh grated Parmesan, and my family loves garlic so I use 3-4 teaspoons of it. All in all the small changes that I've made to it have made it so creamy and very good. I mix it with fettuccine noodles, and chicken then  toss in red bell peppers and tomatoes, my family and best friend keep asking me to make it, lol I've made it once a week for a month.

Love it! Will never buy another jar of Alfredo again! I did accidentally use the wrong cheese the first dozen times I made this. I used a finely shredded Italian cheese blend instead of grated Parmesan cheese. I enjoy it so much I've never tried to make it the right way!

Was skeptical about trying this recipe so I did with a little change, I used fresh garlic because powder just wasn't gonna do for a first time sample. I also used 2 boullion cubes as I sauted the garlic in margarine. I also added a little mozzarella cheese and grilled chicken cubes. This was excellent to me and I would definitely make it again and use shrimp as a substitute for chicken. The sauce did get thick while sitting on the pasta so maybe a little more milk so that it stays smooth. Fast, simple and delish! A.G.

I like to twist this recipe just a little. Try substituting the parmesan with some Asiago. It is a wonderful change in the taste.

Tried this recipe, followed every instruction and it was okay. But I was expecting more like San Remo's instant Alfredo pasta, and this was far from it. Also, my biggest gripe was the serving size. I had suspected 2 cups of milk for 4 servings would've been too much, but I thought I would just follow the recipe and see from there. I was right, it was more like 6 servings to me.

Great recipe. The only advice I have is do not subsitute butter for margarine. The margarine is too oily and it will dissociate to the top. I will say though the only issue I found was it was a little runny but that could have been because of the margarine. A little oregano and onion powder also added to the flavor.

Great recipe. It is very creamy and is easy to make. The consistency isn't as great as I had hoped. It is hard to mix the parmesan in right, but practice makes perfect. I still like the heavy cream version tho.

Following what the recipe stated didn't seem like exactly what I had in mind, so I added sauteed mushrooms, sauteed garlic and real bacon bits (the kind from Hormel in the jar, much less grease than bacon from a package). I cooked the pasta in salted water and it helped immensely. This was delicious!

OH MY GOSH! SO SO good! I used fresh garlic. Next time I'll cut the fresh parm in 1/2. I also combined with fresh asparagus, bowties, put in oven with mozzarella on top on broil for about 5 minutes. I will make this over and over and over!  I also added about 1/3 cup fresh chopped parsley to the sauce (at the point which you add the pepper and parm). I cannot say how easy and totally wonderful this is!

What a great way to use cream cheese.  This was really good, really fast and I doctored it up the way my family likes.  I will keep this trick in my back pocket for quick thick sauces.

This was a very good sauce for how quick it cooks up. I'm a mom of a 2 month old and a 19 month old so anything thats quick AND good gets five stars in my book. I made mine with chicken and my little boys favorite, bow tie pasta. Next time I think I'll try to add the nutmeg. There will definitely be a next time bc my little boy ate it all up and I think it's something my husband might like. Hes working away but got a text saying he was missing out on supper tonight!

I needed to use this for another recipe and it worked perfect.  Not for dieters though.  I'm sure with lo fat ingredients it wouldn't turn out as well.

Thank you for this easy recipe!  It's great because I always have these ingredients on hand, and it so simple!  Taste great too!  For the people who complained that this is not a high end restaurant style Alfredo sauce, is ridiculous thing to say, because the recipe states "quick and easy".  I only had onion and chive cream cheese on hand, but still it turned out outstanding.  Thank you!  His is a keeper!

Super easy!! Great creamy texture and tasty! WAY better than any jar, that's for sure.  My kids loved it and we have now found our "alfredo in a hurry" sauce for week night meals.  Love it!

So I was really desperate to make pasta alfredo for a quick easy meal for myself and 4 small children. I've used this before and it has always pleased my, however, I DID NOT HAVE ANY PARMESAN CHEESE!! Oh the horror! lol. I even asked my neighbors but to no avail. However, it still turned out ok. Just so you know. :)

I enjoyed this recipe.  I used about 1.5 c milk and 1/2 c heavy cream because I wanted to use it up.  I also used about 8 ounces grated parmesan - I used the 2nd smallest size on my multi-size cheese grater.  When adding the liquid, I added about 1/4 c at a time, whisking constantly.  I also added the parmesan by pinches, whisking constantly.  It came out with a smooth, enjoyable texture that way.  Next time, I might add more garlic and more pepper.  

What I liked most about this sauce is that, unlike almost all other alfredo sauces that seem to become chunky and thick before I'm done trying to eat, this stayed smooth in consistency until the last bite.  Yum!

bravo to the submitter! i was extremely skeptical about the sauce since it involved strong tasting cheeses. but as another reviewer commented, you couldn't really taste the cream cheese. i plan on using this recipe again for when i run out of the jarred stuff. :)

This recipe is very good and very easy to make.  I usually tweak recipes a lot but followed this fairly closely. I didn't have any fresh garlic  which I would have preferred, so I used the powder instead.
It takes a little patience to make...I would tell other people who had trouble to let the cream cheese soften slightly before starting to cook, cut it into smaller blocks so its easier to combine. Once the cream cheese breaks down in the pan (part way) add a small amount of milk and whisk. Add the milk bit by bit and continue to whisk.
And lastly....use REAL Parmesan or Pecorino Romano (I prefer Romano)...it may be more expensive but its so much better than that junk in the green can - buy a block and grate it yourself, your taste buds and your dinner guests will thank you!! You will also see that the sauce doesn't come out gritty at all....the Parmesan should melt very easily wi no grit. 
So, overall...I'm not a fan of cheese or cream sauces but this was tasty, was not overly rich and most importantly, everyone in my family of 5 will eat it, so this will become an addition to our monthly meal plan! Thanks for posting!!

This is a fantastic recipe. Nobody can tell that it isn't made with heavy cream. As others have stated, you can't taste the cream cheese. I usually put in some peas and shrimp and toss over fettuccini noodles and everyone loves it. I have tried subbing minced garlic for the powder and it is somewhat better, but not necessary. So easy to make!

Because I wanted to rate it based on the exact recipe I am giving it a 4. I didn't change a thing even after reading a lot of the ratings. What I found that is was a little "too cheesy" for me. I like cheese but it was almost tart. (My son 12 ate it but also said a little too cheesy) I will for sure make it again but I will cut back a little of the Parmesan and add a little broccoli. I will use fresh garlic instead of the powder and as others suggested I may add a tiny amount of nutmeg. Overall it was easy to follow, I had all the ingredients on hand, and very fast which is very nice.

This was a very easy and quite delish Alfredo. Like any recipe I add a bit of my own flair. Instead of garlic powder I used the minced garlic in olive oil, some nutmeg, fresh lemon, and some dried parsley. Poured the Alfredo over linguini and shrimp. It was really very good. Oh! I used fresh grated parmesan cheese. Enjoy!!!

This was actually pretty great! I was not expecting it to be so simple. It is definitely going to be added to my recipes. My only issue is the serving size, I think that it makes more than 4 servings (but I'm also not exactly sure how much a serving is). I split the recipe in half for two people and I ended up having about 12oz jar leftover.

This alfredo was amazing! I reduced the servings to 3 and my family of 3 had a lot left over. I did add cumin and garlic as others suggested and I used an aged parm. It smelled soooo good. I don't like the jarred alfredo. It tastes bland to me. I cooked a strip and a half of bacon then sauteed mushrooms, ham, and leftover grilled chicken in the drippings. I steamed a little broccoli. I tossed everything together with rotini noodles. Highly unhealthy but amazing!

Great recipe! I made it according to the recipe. My kids are super picky and I have a hard time making food both of them will eat. At the table, all I heard was mmmmm and thanks mom! This recipe made enough for two meals. I only needed half of the sauce and put the rest in the freezer. Love it when I can get two meals for one.

This was my first time trying out an alfredo sauce recipe. Made as is this sauce is super rich (once it reduces) but a little bland. After adding extra garlic, pepper, and a little seasoning salt it was perfect! I like how easy it was to make and that it called for milk instead of cream. Saves us a few calories (-:

I used low fat milk and part skim cream cheese and turned out great.  I did have to add a little salt.  Great recipe.

I enjoyed making this Alfredo but, what I will do next time is cut down on the amount of Parmesan because I found it to be very rich tasting. I also added some shrimp.

My husband won’t eat another alfredo sauce since I made this. I add some parsley for a little color, but the recipe doesn’t really need adjusting. Perfect!

Made this tonight exactly as directed but added a 1/4 cup or so of chopped fresh parsley. Next time I will use fresh grated Parmesan instead of the green can kind. This was the absolute best Alfredo I have ever had and I am hard to please when it comes to Alfredo sauces. Have made many before but this is the keeper. The longer it sat after cooking, the better it tasted. Amazing!!!!!

It was good, but no rave reviews from this reviewer.  This is not the best Alfredo sauce I've ever tasted, I'd still rather have a Buca Alfredo or similar; but it is better than the canned options out there. I can see why some would say this is bland. I used a lot (almost the entire) Parmesan cheese container and added some Mozzarella cheese as well-- salt and pepper.  It was definitely creamy and smooth-- but to achieve this a whisk is needed or I could see this becoming a gloopy mess, and it helps keep the mixture from burning to the bottom of your saucepan. I would try again to continue to tweak-- probably the addition of chicken would help.

So Easy! We had some noodles and really wanted alfredo sauce but I didn't have any, this was an easy recipe to whip together - only change I made was I didn't have enough parmesan so I used what I had (about half the called for amount) and a Mozzerella/Provelone Shredded cheese blend I had. Turned out GREAT!

One of the easiest and most delicious pasta dishes I've ever had! I scaled the sauce down to 4 servings, even though I only used angel hair pasta for one. As others have subbed the milk, I also used non-fat dairy creamer in its place with great success....also added a little white wine. I used two cloves of garlic but I would even add more, I love it so much. I topped with parsley, and I found it needed salt, as well. Absolutely delish! Thanks for sharing your creation, Dawn!

This turned out really well for me. The only thing I did differently was to add some crushed garlic to the butter and let it cook for a couple of minutes before adding the cream cheese (careful not to let the garlic burn or it will ruin your sauce). I omitted the garlic powder since I used fresh. I also added a pinch of nutmeg at the end. Was creamy, garlicy, and super easy. My boyfriend usually doesn't eat creamy sauces and he loved this. Will definitely make this again!

this is a GREAT alfredo-type sauce.  I don't put garlic powder in it.  I do add a grating of fresh nutmeg though and it is wonderful.
thanks for this easy recipe - I can't stand that jarred alfredo stuff!!

I tried this as a basic recipe, but replaced the cream cheese with: 1/3 a 250 g pkg of the spreadable variety of regular cream cheese and 1/3 herb and garlic.  I then added two cloves of crushed garlic to it.  I also cut down the milk to just over 1 cup, but I think that all depends on personal choice for consistency.  It turned out great with rave reviews!

I made this recipe exactly as written. It could not have been easier or more delicious! I used 1% milk and for the Parmesan cheese, I used the Sargento cheese brand (in my opinion it's better than Kraft or the store brand cheese) I used this sauce for Angela's Alfredo Ham recipe on this site, and it was deeeeeeeelicious!!!!! Tasted like it was from a restaurant! All the company went back for seconds, including the kids, so you know it had to be good!! I really look forward to using this sauce with chicken and broccoli, too! Thanks!!!

I''m a newbie cook, so new that in trying the recipes out i usually take twice the amount of time to prepare and cook, and blotch the entire thing 1 out of 3 tries. So i usually try the easy recipes with affordable ingredients (you dont want to use expensive ingredients if you have a good chance of failing, ha!)

Anyways, i cooked this for my boyfriend and he loved it! I loved it! Quoting: "It's really good. Congratulations. It's restaurant level pasta. If you undercook the pasta a little, its Mamu (famous high end restaurant here innthe Philippines that serve great pasta and steak) level pasta. Im proud of you." 

Notes: 
In the original recipe, Parmesan was used instead of cheddar but we like the cheddar more coz its saltier. And  1 teaspoon garlic powder was recommnded but since i didnt have garlic powder, i used real garlic instead. 

So for future use (definitely!), i'll stick to cheddar and undercook the pasta a little. And i agree, the cream cheese really is the magic ingredient!!

Great recipe!  This is exactly what I was looking for.  It is a creamy cheesy sauce, so different from the bland Alfredo sauces I've tried before.  Best of all, it is easy to prepare.

I ended up not using all of the milk (maybe about 1 cup) and adding some salt.  Also, I didn't have any garlic powder, so I added in some fresh minced chives at the very end of cooking.  I also added some frozen peas near the end of cooking for color and texture though that may not be to everyone's taste.  Next time, I might saute some onions and mushrooms and add them, too.

This was a fantastic sauce! I left out the pepper only because my son is highly picky when he sees the black flecks in anything! I used low-fat cream cheese and 1% milk because that's what I had on hand. I substituted 1/4 cup of the milk with half & half since I didn't have whole milk. Everyone in the house loved it!!

Amazing!!  I accidentally doubled the garlic and it still came out great. I have never made Alfredo sauce before trying this recipe. I usually try a few different recipes to find one that is perfect, but not in this case.  I can't imagine a better recipe.   My son who is an extremely picky teenager even liked it.

I made this just now and it tastes really good, I made it with 1 lb. of pasta for four people and it was perfect. I added some more Parmesan on top after mixing the sauce with the fettuccini. It's really tasty, quick, and simple. Perfect for throwing a meal together in 20 minutes for the family!

I was not sure because of cream cheese in an alfredo sauce but this garlicky sause was YUM! Great alternative to using cream. I always use real garlic, crushed, sauted in the butter.  Have made this a couple times and will continue to. Our go to for white sauce :)

My hubby really liked it but I thought it was okay.
I followed the recipe exactly except using fresh garlic.
I thought it was a bit too salty and grainy(due to parmesan) I didn't like the texture of Parmesan in it too much.
I was a bit surprised that my hubby liked it so much though. Since he liked it so much, I'll definitely make it again but next time, I think I'll use shredded Parmesan not the powdered one.
I added asparagus(sauteed in garlic and olive oil) on top with grilled chicken(store bought). I'm really curious how it would come out with the shredded Parmesan. I'll update once trying.

It did in a pinch, but unless I made it wrong, I could absolutely tell there was cream cheese in it and could taste it. I'll have to keep looking for a real alfredo recipe.

I followed the suggestions of reg927 for making this sauce, then used probably 1/4 cup cream in place of some of the milk reg927 suggested.  I served this with the baked herb perch fillet recipe...minus the bread crumbs, doubling the Parmesan cheese and baking in the melted butter in a 9x13 pan...on this website and steamed cauliflower.  A monochromatic meal but garnered me great compliments. :-)

YUMMO! I took one reviewers advice and used 1 1/3 cup milk, I actually used Half & Half because I did not have any milk. I also used 2 garlic cloves just because I had them and lots of shredded parmesan! This really was super easy and super super yummy!

Super easy and delicious! I used whole milk and combined the onion powder and cream cheese with my hand before placing in the skillet. It was a perfect sauce for my homemade three cheese sausage pizzas!

I love how tasty this alfredo sauce is - and EASY! It is rich, creamy, and everything I love in an alfredo sauce. The reason people probably didn't enjoy it is because they didn't let it boil down from its milky state into a creamy and condensed state. I made it for my family - 5 stars!

I needed half this recipe to put with other ingredients in my crockpot, so I halved it and it was better than the store bought Alfredo.  I will never buy it from the store again, this was a great recipe and my husband loved it.

I used this recipe for the first time last night for a family dinner & everyone was super impressed. It came out amazing. I added just a little dash of salt & a little more pepper for a little extra flavor for my taste. I also served with chicken & broccoli. It was way better then the olive garden recipe I had used & way easier to make. Definitely sticking with this recipe from now on.

This was the most disgusting thing I have eaten in a long time! I followed the directions exactly and let me tell you the cream cheese ruined this whole thing. This is not Alfredo Sauce at all, it is not even an appropriate sauce for anything I can think of. If you are a fan of Alfredo I suggest using the butter and cream recipes. It was creamy sticky like melted marshmallow consistency and the flavor was horrible and I am a huge cream cheese fan. I know what some of the other reviewers meant by a big buttery blob because that is how it was for a long time. I am even dreading going back into the kitchen and doing all the dishes. What a waste of cream cheese!

I have made this several times, and every time it is wonderful!!!! And it smells like Texas toast!!!!
I have also made it with homeade noodles and store bought.  Obviously the homemade is always better, buts is so easy to make this dinner, so much better than bottle Alfredo. I had dinner ready in all less than 30 min!

This is by far the best Alfredo sauce I have made, and I've tried many.  My children and husband all complimented me with how yummy it was.  Simple, easy, and delicious.

Never buying jarred sauce again!  This is much tastier and simple to make. You don't even need to follow the recipe exactly to have it turn out delicous. Tip: add fresh chopped parsely when mixing in the cheese and pepper.

Everyone loved it, said we shouldn't buy the jars anymore. It wasn't as thick as the stores but it was delicious. I cut the recipe in half, covered enough pasta to feed 4.

I had to use part butter part margarine, but it was good. A little salty by itself, but good for flavoring the noodles and broccoli. I guess I don't eat the sauce by itself anyway, except for tasting. Lol.mine looked clumpy until milk was in, but thinned out beautifully.  I did low- medium until the milk was added, then turned to low, stirring occasionally, and it thickened a little, then turned off heat, and just left it on the burner, and it has a great consistency. Will make again.

Made it exactly as stated and it was excellent. The cream cheese keeps it from separating when cool. Definitely an easy, go to recipe.

I just made this recipe for my family & it's a hit! I adjusted some of the flavoring by adding some dried basil and thyme, but other than that it's a really good base.

Family loved this! Used alittle less milk: 1-1/3 c milk, and the cream cheese was reduced fat cream cheese. Added grilled chicken and (microwave steam in bag) broccoli. Mixed noodles, chicken, broccoli up and then added sauce. (Looked like it was going to be too much sauce but it was just right.) Easy and delicious!

Miam! I used only 1/8 tsp of garlic powder and I added basil, italian seasoning, and oregano. It was still good, though.

For a change use cream of mushroom soup (no milk or touch if too dry) instead of the cream cheese.  I have learned the kids find the cream cheese too heavy and rich they prefer the mushroom soup.

Yummers! I really enjoyed this. Don't be intimidated if it takes a few minutes to smooth out the cream cheese; just keep whisking. I used garlic paste instead of powder and 1/3 c of heavy whipping cream and 1c of milk. I used spinach linguine from trader joes and added chicken and peas. My three kids enjoyed it and I will definitely make it again.

LOVE LOVE LOVE this recipe. I have made it so many times because it is so good, so quick (seriously), and most importantly you can make it reduced fat. 
I used less than half of the butter than it called for, and it still tasted amazing. I also 1/3 reduced fat cream cheese and skim milk and with these two changes it was still thick and creamy. 
This is my new go to because I usually have all of the ingredients and it is seriously so quick and honestly so delicious!

I am in love with this recipe!
Just the right consistency and flavorful!

I was a bit skeptical at first after seeing cream cheese in this recipe and thinking that was so not the flavor I would want in an alfredo, but I was very pleasantly surprised at how well this tasted!  The key thing is to just keep whisking because it will look kinda weird at first and you just have to be patient.  The only extra thing I did was to add just a sprinkle of nutmeg because I really love that element of flavor in an alfredo.  This is an easy, delicious recipe that I'll be keeping!  Thanks for sharing! :-)

Tried this recipie for the first time, it was ok.  The parmesan cheese didn't melt the way I would have liked it to, it isn't a very smooth sauce.. Just ok.

This is a great sauce for kids and it is so quick. I have made this three times and I always end up tweaking it a bit, but it is a usable base to start from. I often add various seasoning, and I cut up chicken and brown it first in the pan, then add back after sauce is made.

I made this as is and it was just ok. The parm just wouldn't melt and to heck if I pay $11/lb for Gruyere! I could still taste hints of the cream cheese, too. I stirred my butt off! The sauce got plenty thick, but it was almost slimy and gooey . As for the flavor, I didn't think it taste anything like "OliveS GardenA"(Popular Italian chain). It wasn't terrible tasting and it was pretty quick and easy to make. I probably will not make this again.

Very easy and very delicious! I used whole milk. I did have a little trouble at first, it seemed that the butter and cream cheese were never going to mix but I added a tbsp of flour and started adding the milk and it came together.

I really loved this sauce. I did use some of the suggestions that I read in one of the reviews and it turned out great. When my grandmother tasted just the sauce she even loved it and said she would eat the sauce right by itself.

This was not good. I really wanted it to be because of all the high reviews.  I think it was the cream cheese and parm combo. It didn't work for me. Ill be trying something different next time.

I did not care for this recipe. 
It curdled directly after I cooked out the lumps.  
It didn't have any distinct flavoring, it was bland... and had WAY too much butter. 
I'm not a fan of this and won't be making it again.

The first time I made it, I had to use margarine, since I didn't have butter. It turned out great! It thickened in couple minutes and it's nice that it didn't call for extra salt. Today, I made it again, using butter this time. This time, it got really oily when I dumped the milk in, and pretty much stayed that way. It also didn't thicken nicely as it it did the first time. It wasn't still an okay consistency, and still tasted good, but I'd give it 5 stars if it would've worked out just as nicely (or, if the recipe called for margarine, instead).

This is a perfect and simple quick alfredo that tastes delicious! My 3 yr old loves it! I added a tablespoon of parsley for fun and minced garlic (because I love it) and it was even more amazing. It can be even more delicious with shrimp/chicken and broccoli florets!

This is a great recipe for Alfredo sauce. The only thing different I do is I add another tsp of garlic powder, leave out the pepper, and use less milk. I don't measure the milk I just put enough in to make it thick and creamy. If I have any leftover, which is usually not the case as my family loves this, I do need to add more milk. It becomes pretty solid after it is refrigerated, because I don't use as much milk as the recipe calls for. When my kids' friends come for dinner they always ask, "are you making Alfredo tonight?"

We didn't like this at all.  The cream cheese made it taste kind of sour and it took over 10 minutes of constant stirring to get rid of all the clumps.  We won't be making this again.

I followed the advice of a few other readers and used 1 1/3 cup milk, but I didn't have enough parmesan cheese, so I used grated mozarella too. It was very creamy and had great flavor, but a bit too much garlic for my taste...my husband loved it though, so it's a keeper. Next time I may cut the garlic in half and make sure I have enough parmesan. Great recipe, and you can't taste the cream cheese- easy super to make too.

Needed a quick, easy meal tonight and came across this recipe.  I loved it and my kids loved it!  My two year old can be hard to please, so this was awesome!  Will definitely be making again!

I have tried a lot of different alfredo recipes and this is the best! I will be making this one very often, my family loved it and we were fighting over the leftovers.  Thanks for sharing!

Quick and easy. I loved that it used milk (we use 2 percent), and not cream. I didn't have enough parmesan the first time, but it still was fine with half the amount. The second time I made it, I had the right amount and it was even better. I used half a container of the powdery kind, but I think I'm going to try fresh parmesan next time. For a super fast recipe, I think it was very good. Thank you for sharing it!

I made this last night with Grilled chicken Ravioli from Sam's because I didn't have any Alfredo Sauce on hand. I LOVED it! I did read the reviews and make the changes suggested....1 tsp minced garlic with the butter, only used about 1 1/3 cups milk and 4 oz. of parmesean (half a container of kraft grated), about 1/4 tsp black pepper and a few grinds of sea salt. Next time, I would probably add a little more parmesan...maybe the 6 oz. It also did not thicken quickly, it took a good 5-10 minutes. 

I will definitely not be buying canned sauce again! The cream cheese does give it a little of a different flavor than traditional Alfredo, but it is a really good white sauce to use with your Italian dishes!

used half-and-half instead of milk...still tasted amazing! Also, added a little spinach for that health kick, and topped with MORE parmesan cheese. SO GOOD, will make again!

I think that on its own, it wouldn't have been enjoyed by my family.  As I went, I doctored it up.  Nutmeg, touch of oregano, fresh garlic, extra parm, extra pepper.  I am not sure I love the texture with the cream cheese still, I think I would have preferred to just use whole milk.

Ok, so I can't eat dairy right now because I'm breastfeeding and my baby can't tolerate it. Alfredo is my favorite food group and i was dying without it. I was able to find a vegan cream cheese spread, and vegan grated parmesean topping. i subbed almond milk for regular milk. I did use the butter, but probably would have been ok subbing olive oil if needed to be completely dairy free. It was pretty good. Only slightly worse than the dairy version. I'm giving this 4 stars because I have an amazing alfredo recipe that no other recipe can beat, and I can't wait to get back to making that one!

Easy and amazing! Found it to not be quite as thick as I wanted so added a little cornmeal/water mixture to thicken. Also added some frozen broccoli heated in the microwave and chicken I had on the George Forman. My friend who ate it with me made it for her parents the next night. Huge hit!

I needed a very quick and easy Alfredo recipe since forgot it at the store and I was already cooking dinner.  THIS WAS BETTER THAN STORE BOUGHT! I will definitely make this instead of buying a jar; even my very picky husband loved it! Great recipe.....

My initial two times with this recipe I added garlic salt, garlic, onions, parsley, a few dashes of cayenne pepper and used olive oil instead of butter.  Delicious!  The next time I continued with my previous additions and used onions and chives cream cheese and about 1-2 tablespoons of white wine.  I combined this with shrimp and fettucine.  Absolutely fantastic/restaurant quality!

I absolutely adored this recipe, as did my daughter. I used real garlic instead of garlic powder, which added to the taste, and I made the entire recipe dairy free using tofutti cream cheese, soy milk, vegan parmesan, and vegan margarine, due to my daughter's dairy allergy. Even with all the substitution it was fabulous, and I would recommend it to anyone!

I wasn't a huge fan. I sauteed minced garlic and mushrooms before adding the cream cheese and milk. The flavor of the cream cheese overwhelmed the entire dish. I'll make a roux next time.

mmmmm Yum!! This was excellent! I made a few changes because I didn't have the right kind of cheese and I just wanted to add my own flare:) I used grated gouda cheese, tamari sauce, extra garlic (minced and powder) a fresh variety of herbs and chopped onion and chicken sauteed in raw organic coconut oil. I aslo added a couple pinches of cayenne powder to give a slight kick. Everyone loved it! I really knew it was good when my 18 year old brother went to the stove and started scraping out the pan and asking me if I could make it again tomorrow :) Very good and simple recipe that would be good by itself but is also a great starter for your style alfredo!

Always wondered how they did that sauce with those one skillet meals...now I know. It's not that bad that I would  not do it again if I needed a fast and very simple alfredo sauce, as in a sudden menu change. However I would not use this recipe to attempt to demonstrate my skills making sauces. To me it simply doesn't have a lot of zing or make a very strong impression. I would use minced garlic and very coarsely ground pepper for starters. Like I said it's a beginning but leaves a lot of room for improvisations and improvement, but I did save it for future tweaking!

I was really in a pinch when I did a search for this recipe. I had just finished making some oven baked chicken and some cheese tortellini when I realized I didn't have any Alfredo sauce on hand. I'm not a fan of the jar version but it's quick for my kids. I found this recipe and saw that I had all the ingredients on hand to make it. It was a time-saver and really, really good! I think next time I will use a little less milk, fresh garlic and some herbs to liven it up even more but it is just fine as it is if you're in a hurry. I will never buy the jar version again. Thank you to the OP for sharing this wonderfully easy recipe!

This was such a delicious and easy recipe. This was so good that even my super picky 7 year old daughter loved it. I did make one small change. I am a heavy whipping cream lover, so I used 1 cup of milk and one cup of heavy whipping cream instead of 2 cups of milk. I love really thick sauce so I knew that the heavy whipping cream would give it the perfect thickness. I prefer linguini noodles and they were so delicious. I was a hero at dinner tonight! THANKS

It was definitely cheesier than store bought, but the texture came out just a little grainy.  Taste was fine.  I cut down the calories by using neufchatel cheese.  Still used whole milk b/c I was concerned about altering the recipe too much.

Update:  I added more milk when reheating to thin out the sauce, and it turned out markedly better.

This was great!  Not EXACTLY the same thing as regular alfredo, but delicious just the same, super quick & easy.  My husband HATES alfredo sauce, but likes this!

Fabulous! This is my first time making Alfredo sauce. Mixed with chicken, broccoli and pasta. Baked in the oven. Everybody LOVED it.
It is simply a very tasty sauce.
Made the following changes based some of the reviews:
1> added fresh garlic (minced)
2> added a little bit oregano
3> added a couple of dashes of nutmeg.

I cut everything in half since I don't need that much sauce.

Thanks for shairing!

Very pleased.  Better than I expected.  With home-made pasta to accompany.  If I knew it was this easy I'd have made my own sauce years ago.  Not calorie free but for a special occasion this one will please your guests or the kids.  Negative reviews I believe may just be based on taste preferences or over or undercooking.  I took my time with this one and did not rush the recipe.  Perfect!

This sauce was very yummy and super simple! The only change I made was adding seasoned chicken breasts and canned tomatoes. Fresh tomatoes would have been better but I didn't have any on hand. I was shocked at how delicious this was for such a simple recipe! I will use this again and again for many pasta dishes in the future!

I love this alfredo sauce but my family thinks its too rich and heavy. Maybe adding a little more cream would thin it out. I loved it, my boys did not.

Well this recipe had a few mixed reviews so I was concerned, but I did not have any heavy cream on hand and did not want to go to the store. I followed the directions exactly except only added 1 2/3 cup milk and added another 1/2 cup of shredded cheese (mix of asiago, parm, romano, and provolone). This sauce was wonderful! Did not have a heavy cream cheese taste at all. Tasted like alfredo sauce.

It was easy and tasty - a good base sauce - I sprinkled some salt on my portion and of course my meat eater husband wanted some chicken in it ;) I used half and half but I am sure milk would have been fine

Recipe was great but I substituted a minced clove of garlic for the powder. I think 2 cups of milk made it a bit runny so next time I'll use one or some half and half.

this was a really good tasting recipe.  I followed the suggestions of the 'most helpful review' and added about 6 oz parm. cheese instead to thicken it up a bit.  Also added just a pinch of onion powder.  SO good!  Thanks for sharing this one.

I did not have that much milk or cream cheese.  so here is what I did.  I used 1 can cream of mushroom, around 3 ounces of plain cream cheese, 2 ounces of cream cheese with onion and chive(I did not have enough cream cheese, but this worked out), I used a 1/4 of a cup of milk, the remainder of my Parmesan and mozzarella, which was only about a 1/4 of a cup.  I used the last of my ricotta, which was about 3 tablespoons. I blended this well and heated through, to make sure the ricotta was not grainy.  I served this over gnocchi, and it is awesome! I did add the butter and pepper, but left out the garlic powder, as the cream of mushroom had enough flavor in it!

I just made this and it tastes wonderful. The sauce is done before the pasta that tells you how fast and easy it is to make. I will be making this again.I followed a few of the suggestions by using minced garlic and 1 1/3 cup of milk. Thank you for sharing your recipe.

I used nonfat milk and reduced fat cream cheese, and it was soooooooo gooooood! It's perfect for those of us who lack the particular skill needed to make a roux - it truly is fool proof, a child could probably make this. Traditionally Alfredo sauce is made with Parmesan, but you can use any kind of cheese you want - I used Gruyere and it was amazing! And it great the next day too, and it made a really good cold dip too for veggies or chips or whatever. This sauce can do no wrong :)

Followed it more or less.  Made less in general.  Didn't do a lot of measuring.  I went a little light on the cream cheese, but put some in there.  It was a BIG HIT.  I made home made spinach and greens pasta, which my hubs wouldn't like, but the sauce was good enough to redeem the whole plate.  He said this is a definite do-again.  Thanks!

My family loves this recipe.  It's quick and simple.  I use low fat cream cheese, 1% milk to make it lower in fat and calories. You have to use the real parm.  Not the Kraft stuff in the plastic container.

I made a double batch of this for a dinner party this past weekend. I was skeptical because of the lack of heavy cream but it was fantastic! I used fresh garlic sautéed in the butter and a touch of nutmeg. I did add chicken to the top of mine. I also have to say this was even better the next day! I am making this again tonight, great recipe!

Wow! What a great recipe. I was looking for an  Alfredo Sauce that my husband and I can enjoy (giving I'm not a fan of Alfredo Sauce) and this one is terrific. I used a pre-shredded blend (mozzarrella, provolone, asiago, parmesan, romano and fontina) and it melt beautifully and tasted delicious. Highly recommended.

When I made this I didn't have enough cream cheese or parmesan. I used some shredded mozzarella to try and make up for it and followed the rest of the recipe pretty closely. Best homemade alfredo sauce I've ever had! I can't wait to try it again with all of the right measurements. But honestly, you can sub in any yummy white cheese and it'll probably work. For those that say they taste too much cream cheese, try some different combos or just lessen it (as I said, I didn't even have enough when I made it)! Perhaps not the most authentic Alfredo, but the tastiest and fastest in my opinion. Thanks!

I used less Parmesan and i did 1 1/2 cup of 1% milk and used 10% cream for the other half cup, just to give it a bit more richness :)

I made this wonderful easy sauce this evening after looking through 9 recipes today.  I was quite impress with the results...I would although add 2 pinches of sea salt and use mince garlic instead of garlic powder to boost the flavor ...My family really enjoyed it, I rade Chicken Alfredo with tri color peppers and fresh basil.

Yummy!  I will double the recipe next time for my family of four (hub + two boys).  Had to ration it out to coat pasta sufficiently.

I used 2 cups low fat half & half instead of milk, and 1 t. minced garlic instead of garlic powder.  A definite keeper!

I made this wonderful sauce and thought it was amazing.  Very creamy and flavorful.  It kept well in the refrigerator for a few days also.  I will definitely make this again.  Wonderful with angel hair noodles and broccolli.

OMGOODNESS!  This is the best alfredo sauce I've ever made.  The recipe was dead easy BUT I revamped it a little for the fat content factor (cholesterol watchers take note!).  Since I live in Canada, I used Becel instead of butter and I used low fat Philadephia cream cheese instead of the regular.  And to top it off, I used skim milk!  Worked like a charm and my hubby said to put it on the `to do again` list!  Excellent!

This is a great recipe and i am not a big fan of alredo sauce.  My kids loved it .  I cut the butter in half and added a little less cream cheese, added a sprinkle of both oregano and nutmeg. It turned out great.

Quick and Easy. I used fat free cream cheese and fat free milk (just added less milk).  Added parsley and nutmeg.  Everyone loved.  Worth making again.

Do you mean that you're supposed to actually pour this over something like  pasta? You're not supposed to just eat it as is out of the pan? Ok, I really do get it, but I love this stuff! 

I've never had alfredo chicken at OG because I'm a vegetarian and have never bought it in a jar, so can't compare, but this sauce is delicious.

I've used garlic powder in the past but today I used fresh minced garlic sauted in the butter, and I like the powder better in this recipe because it's smoother. 

I made it specifically to use in spinach/artichoke dip trying to replicate the one at Longhorn. Theirs is the best I've had...what is their secret ingredient? 

But I'm going to chop up some fresh garden tomatoes and pour it over pasta, mushrooms and tomatoes (if I don't eat it all first!)

I followed the recipe exactly except for the garlic today.

I had a similar recipe in a church cookbook so this was exactly what I was looking for. I love it with the cream cheese...we add sauteed mushrooms and peas Delish! Made exactly as directed took a while to thicken.

We loved this!  I halved it and didn't worry too much about measurements, and still got a fantastic sauce.  Here's what I did:
Sautee 2 cloves garlic in 1T butter, add 1 T flour.
Whisk in 1 cup milk, heat through.
Add 1/2 brick cream cheese, handful of Parmesan, and pepper.
Heat until thickened.

I have to agree with other reviewers that this did not taste like alfredo sauce. It tasted like a cream cheese sauce which isn't bad but not what I was looking for. I increased the amount of Parmesan cheese in order to avoid this problem but the cream cheese was still the dominant flavor.

Great, quick Alfredo sauce recipe! I used 1/4c butter, 8oz Neufchâtel cheese, low fat milk, and green-can Parmesan cheese. It worked (surprisingly) well with the green-can Parmesan (it's what I had on hand), but I'll be using the real stuff next time. I'll also probably add a dash of nutmeg next time, too.

I followed the recipe and the sauce never thickened. I also added mushrooms and broccoli and it was pretty good. Just wish the sauce would've thickened. I would say less milk.

I thought it smelled kind of like fast food, but it definitely tastes better.  My boyfriend LOVED it.  The thing I like about this recipe is that the sauce came out really smoothly, which hasn't been the case for other alfredo recipes I've tried.  I did find that I had to stir a lot initially to get the cream cheese to blend in well with the butter/garlic.

Instead of using garlic powder, I used 5 cloves of real garlic (minced).  I also added double the pepper (although I might recommend adding a whole teaspoon) and a teaspoon of oregano.  I think basil would be a nice addition as well, but I didn't have any.

Very quick, very easy, and good for the price and effort.  Not the best recipe I've had, but still really good.

amazing! as good or better than Olive Garden. I had to look up an alfredo recipe because most store bought ones have romano or ricotta cheese in them, which i am allergic to. one tip, just keep whisking! oh, and add the parmesean cheese BEFORE the cream cheese, it dissolves better :)

EXCELLENT! The cream cheese adds taste and also creates a smoother alfredo sauce. 5 stars.

I think the recipe comes out tasting a bit too buttery. I added an additional 1/8-1/3 parmesan cheese then it was quite tasty!

Yummy!
I added mozzarella cheese to thicken and add salty flavor.
I also added frozen green peas to my dish for nutritional value.
It came out FINGER-LICKING GOOD!

It was good but I definitely tasted the cream cheese in this and it threw me off a bit. Although I liked it and I would use it again in a pinch. Thanks!

I made this recipe with the ingredients exactly measured.  I have made many alfredo sauces which were anywhere from fair to excellent, but all were time consuming.  This was the easiest and best home prepared alfredo I have ever made.  
My review is based on the exact recipe.
After completing the recipe I decided to make it a "creole" alfredo and add 1 1/2 tsp of Tony Chacere's Creole Seasoning.  I would give the creole version 6 stars if I could!  We used it as a sauce for baked tilapia.  We served it with fresh oven fries and a green salad.  Yummmmm.
***if you decide to make a creole version please adjust the amount of seasoning to suit your personal taste.  I would start with no more than 3/4 tsp***

Wow this sauce was fabulous and SO easy! My family absolutely loved it. I doubled the recipe, and sliced up mesquite chicken breasts and tossed into the recipe after it was well blended. I stored the leftover sauce and we had it again 2 days later. Like other reviewers I highly recommend making sure it is well blended first. Because the parmesan cheese is a bit grainy you will want to make sure it is fully melted and blended. Otherwise I made this recipe exactly as written and it was perfect. This one is definitely a keeper and the family has already asked when I am going to make it again.

Tried this tonight, and it wasn't bad!  I'm not a huge fan of the canned alfredo sauces- there is a weird taste that I dislike, but this is pretty good.  Next time I will add some veggies and grilled chicken, since it makes quite a bit of sauce for the amount of pasta I used (1lb)

This is a great recipe if you want Alfredo fast. I followed the recipe exactly and found it almost on the runny side (even after setting it aside) and ever so slightly bland (but I usually prefer foods to be saltier than the norm), and no, I didn't find the cream cheese to be overwhelming. Regardless, this is definitely a recipe worth trying, and it's a good one to customize to your own tastebuds with!

I was looking for a quick alfredo and gave this a try. I changed sauce just a little... used fresh garlic and asiago/parm cheese...added grilled chicken with mushrooms and onions and it was amazing! Even my picky eaters loved it! My college son wanted the recipe!

I've only tried an alfredo sauce maybe once before, coz I HATE adding flour- this one was BOMB. Fam of 6 LOVED it- 5-11yr olds mowed. Kudos to your cream cheese genius discovery!

ok, I used 4 oz. of cream cheese b/c it's all I had left.  Increased parmesan to 8+ oz. Also, sauteed 1 clove of minced garlic and 1 T. minced fresh onion in the butter before adding the cheeses. Seemed a little thin so made a slurry w/2 T. each of flour and butter which I whisked in to thicken b/c my intention was to serve over warm biscuits. Most importantly, I stirred in cooked carrots and broccoli and 3 cans of drained tuna. Guess you could call it Tuna Alfredo over biscuits! Delicious!

This is a great alfredo sauce if you are short for time and/or cooking impaired.  I can mess up any recipe, but this one turns out well every time.  

I use less butter than it calls for and buy the flavored cream cheese (the garlic flavored is awesome in this).  I also use 2% milk.  

Toss the sauce with some of the refrigerated or frozen cheese tortellini, some peas and bacon/ham/pancetta and you have a great meal!

My boyfriend and I made this sauce with fettichini for my family dinner, at it was very well received and tasty! Unfortunately it thickened very quickly during dinner, which is understandable and hard to avoid. For leftovers I found that adding a little milk when you heat it up makes it runny again. Very tasty, and easy to make!

I took others recommendations and added less milk (ended up using only 1/2 a cup to keep the sauce thick), 1 cup of Parmesan, and 1/4 tsp nutmeg. The sauce was way too garlicky. I didn't taste the cream cheese at all. It just tasted like a garlic cream sauce. I may try it again with much less garlic and more Parmesan.

Best Alfredo sauce! I used low fat cream cheese, milk and Parmesan but this was still so delish I think we might make it two nights in a row! I also added a little bit of fresh Italian herbs which enhanced this but it would still be good without.

I've never made alfredo sauce, but i had made spagetti squash and wanted to try it with alfredo sauce.  I didn't have cream, which most recipes call for, but I did have cream cheese so I tried this recipe.  My sister ate it, and she loves alfredo sauce, and she says this is one of the best she's ever tasted.  I think it will be a regular in my house now!

WOW!! I had to throw a quick dinner together and pasta is always the choice.  Since I had no alfredo sauce I looked to the intranet and found this one.  Amazingly good ~ better than my favorite brand and very easy to make.  I don't think I will even bother to purchase it anymore... home made it much better!!

Delicious! I used fresh garlic and added some dried herbs to the butter, and used asiago cheese instead of parmesan. It turned out very nicely.

This sauce was easy to make and very creamy it just lacked flavor to me and my husband. Just a little bland.

Loved this! The only thing I did different from the suggested ingredients, is not use all 2 cups milk. I used approximately 1 1/2 cups skim milk. Thanks for sharing! This is now my go to recipe for Alfredo sauce!!

This was the easiest alfredo sauce I have ever made.  It was thick and creamy and delicious!  I actually did the recipe exactly as it says and it turned out amazing.  It does make enough for 8 so invite your friends!

It sounds so simple, but this is incredibly good. I use it with sauteed, chunked chicken breast...removed and set aside, boil up the garlic/cheese tortellini and and then toss both into the sauce...really rich.

I make my own homemade alfredo sauce all the time and i didn't have the ingredients on hand and i didn't feel like going to the store. so i searched for an easy sauce and i found this one. i hand all ingredients on hand and it gets a 5 star for saying exactly what it is, quick and easy. but it's also very rich and tasty too. i only made one minor change. i added the parmesan before adding the milk. it helps to melt the cheese, then i add the milk. oh i added a little cayenne too. but truly it was great without it.

This is simple and yummy.  I followed the recipe exactly.  I did half the recipe for just me and my husband without leftovers and it was perfect!  Very easy and very flavorful.  

I did not find it to be too rich.  Maybe because I used light cream cheese, I don't know.  But the taste was great and I will for sure make this again!

This is a great alternative to jarred alfredo sauce (ugh). I made it exacalmost exactly how the recipe stated, and it was great. I used low-fat cream cheese instead of full fat and it was delicious.

The only change that I would make next time is use real grated cheese. I needed a quick sauce so I used Kraft grated parm cheese this time (not recommended).

I didn't like the cream cheese in this one.  It made it thick but gave it a different texture and taste than I expected in my alfredo sauce.  I won't be making this one again.

Made it in a hurry tonight. Very easy to make. Did it while talking on the phone! It was really quite heavy and both my son and I didn't finish our plate. May have been the whole wheat spaghetti we were eating it or could have been the margarine...I don't know. I found it didn't really have a lot of flavour and needed some salt, but when I'm eating my leftovers tomorrow for lunch, I'll toss it with some pesto. Who knows, it might work! lol

Very good, and easy with ingredients I usually have at the house. The second time I made this I only had 6oz of cream cheese so I supplemented with velveeta and a little extra milk and it also came out great!

OMG this was SO yummy and easy! Way way better than any jarred alfredo sauce. This will be my go to recipe for ever! I did sub minced garlic for the garlic powder. Next time I make it I will definitely have to have bread sticks to dip in it.

I needed an Alfredo sauce to make something and I figured with so many great reviews this had to be good.  I wasn't disappointed.

Two minor, minor alterations when I made it though: 
I used fresh garlic rather than garlic powder (it's worth the 2 extra minutes of effort, just make sure you cook the garlic long enough to cut the sharpness before adding the milk), and 
I used white pepper (since Alfredo sauce is white, it's just more aesthetically pleasing).
Awesome recipe though, will definitely be making this again soon.

This alfredo sauce was great! I had a chipolte pasta so I spiced up the sauce a little bit with 3/4 tsp of chili powder and 1/8 tsp of cayenne  pepper, 1 tsp onion powder and a little more black pepper. I will definitely be using this recipe again :)

I LOVE this recipe. I've been making it for so long. My entire family asks me to make this so they can come over and have dinner. I have it about once a week and my boyfriend NEVER gets tired of it. I did make a few changes. I use minced garlic instead of powder, I use half heavy cream and half milk (I just started doing that, is still fantastic with just milk) I lowered the amount of milk added because we all like thick sauce. I also use a block of parm that I grate myself instead of the already shredded kind, makes it so much yummier. I also use a lot more Parmesan than called for. When I first made this sauce exactly how it was written out, it was still awesome. I just added and subtracted a few things as I make it. I believe I have it perfect! 
Thanks for this recipe!

This was one of the best Alfredo sauce recipes that I have ever tried.  This is going to be a keeper for sure.  Even my picky wife loved this, and we were fighting over who got the leftovers.

I'd never made Alfredo sauce before... or bought it in the store for that matter! I wanted to make something special for my boyfriend and he loves pasta. This came up for Alfredo sauce and it was so delicious and easy to make! I've cooked it several times since then. Thanks! :)

It is not a restaurant quality sauce but for being done in 10 min, it's tastes really good! It is a bit grainy, but still the taste makes up for that.
I sauteed the garlic for a minute in the butter and didn't put as much milk as it reached a perfect thickness with only half a cup or so.
Definitely recommended for working moms who want to serve a tasty dinner in an instant

This is really simple. I didn't have any pepper so I used Tony's seasoning and it was excellent! Will make it again. Also, I agree with another reviewer that stated this recipe makes 8 servings. I halved it and easily had 4 servings. Yummm!!!!

We LOVE this in our house!  My husband can't get enough of this.  I always half the recipe since I cook for two.  The first batch we made was a little thin. The second batch, I used 3/4 cup of milk, and it was perfect!  We will never use another alfredo recipe!

Easy, foolproof, and perfect for a weeknight at home with sauteed and seasoned chicken.  I used it as a pizza topping and had enough left over for the scavenging teenagers who live in my house to eat with pasta.  Ok, so it's not REAL alfredo (which must be served immediately or it will break) but an excellent imposter.

This was really good for a quick alfredo sauce! It didn't taste authentic to me but it was quick, easy and used up the ingredients I had in the house. I normally make a recipe using heavy cream and never tried the cream cheese before. The sauce was creamy and it didn't taste the cream cheese. I used 2% milk and ended up adding a little more at the end to thin it out slightly. I served it over penne because that is what I had in the house and it was still very satisfying.

After tasting the alfredo sauce, I am disappointed. It is creamy yet does not taste like alfredo at all; it tastes like cream cheese. It is still edible though. I followed the recipe using reg927's modification. 

I will not make this recipe again.

Yum! This was awesome (though fattening)- I followed Reg927's recommendations and used 2 tsp minced garlic, 1 1/3 C 1% milk and 4 oz. parm. cheese. Next time, I might add the sea salt and a bit more pepper. Sooo tasty! I poured it over pasta, broccoli and tuna.

I love this recipe! I took away a star because it is INCREDIBLY fattening. I have some on the stove now, actually. Tonight, I used FF milk, FF cream cheese, and a good quality parmesagn cheese instead of the powdered kind. The FF cream cheese had a harder time mixing in, but it turned out very well. I'd recommend this if you think you'll want more than one serving (or if you want to fit into your jeans the next day).

So good, strong yummy flavors, made as is or with a lower fat milk. I have used whole milk and 2% and my family cannot tell the difference.

This made the best alfredo sauce ever! I did make a few changes: I cut the butter back to 1/3 cup, and sauteed 2 cloves of garlic in it. I used Neufchatel cheese instead of cream cheese. And I did not have milk so I used half and half. (Good thing I cut back on the fat in the amount of butter and the lower fat cheese!) Thanks so much for posting this, it is fabulous!

This is absolutely the BEST alfredo sauce in the world! Better than Olive Garden! Until my husband discovered it has Cream Cheese as an ingedient, now he wont eat it. :( Anyway, this is awesome & I make it for myself now and love it! You don't even need to make any changes to this recipe. So good!

Thought I'd give this a try with the cream cheese - but it was a "no go" at my house. No one liked this version. Will stick with classic alfredo which includes heavy cream, butter, parmesan cheese, garlic, salt, white pepper etc.  I love cream cheese - but it adds a flavor that traditional alfredo does not have. Sorry...

I've used this for years as it's always worked well for me.  The only problem I have noticed it after you refrigerate it, it doesn't really heat back up well.  It's not horrible but definitely not the same consistency as when you poured it over the pasta.  Also, it develops more of a cream cheese look after it's been refrigerated.  If you mix it directly with the pasta and plan to have any leftovers, keep this in mind.  It might be better to store the sauce separately from the pasta if you plan on using some of it later.  A good recipe, just the storing and later usage is the only issue I had with it.....and that could have just been me.

Anyways, for taste, I highly recommend this.  You can also use shredded Parmesean, if you have any of that lying around.  I've also substituted a 4 cheese Italian blend and it turned out well, with a slightly milder taste.

I didnt follow the recipe exactly, I thought it sounded like a lot of milk so i left out a little, maybe 1/4 cup. But even with a little extra milk i think this would have still turned out REALLY thick. the flavor was okay but it was just so heavy and thick i felt like i could feel it clogging my arteries. Maybe if i try it again i would decrease the amount of cream cheese and increase the milk. Also doctor it up with some herbs or veggies.

I found that the sauce needed some tweaking, I added a little creole seasoning, a pinch of sugar and a little smoked paprika,  it was a little runny so I added a little flour to thicken and it was delicious will use it again thanks

So, I just got done enjoying this recipe.  It was quick to make and delicious to eat!  I added a red pepper and some green onions when I melted the butter to add some flavor and color.  I also added blackened chicken to the dish.  That obviously added more spice which was great!  This is now saved in my recipe box!  Thanks, Dawn!

I have used a very similar recipe forever (minus the garlic powder although I will have to try it next time) and it is always a huge hit.  Its so easy that when I first made it, I just kinda made up the recipe myself in my head and my recipe is just like this one.  My kids and husband love it and its an easy quick meal for a weekeday dinner when we are all soo busy.  You can add broccoli or grilled chicken to your pasta dish as well.  YUMMY!

It had a little too much cream cheese for my families liking.  Also, next time I would cut the recipe in half and still use a whole lb. of pasta.  Way too saucy!

This was delicious and super-easy!  I will definitely make this again.  The only thing I will do differently next time would be to either cook it a little longer or cut down on the milk.  It was a little runnier than I would have liked (but whether that's due to the recipe or the cook is yet to be seen).  Good stuff!

This is fantastic- and really easy- I pair it with very spicy Cajun-style chicken- the cool of the dairy offsets anything spicy very well. One warning! do not use low fat cream cheese! -you can do without the butter but even 2/3 fat cream cheese made this sauce loose its creaminess significantly- thanks for sharing this recipe.

This is the best Alfredo I've ever had and it always keeps me coming back for seconds. I will never go back to any other Alfredo again. I ordered fettucini Alfredo a couple of months ago at a restaurant and it didn't compare at all. This is by far one of the best recipes I've picked up from the site. The only adjustment is that I use fresh garlic.

Quick and easy recipe that can server as a base for many others requiring an Alfredo sauce. I used fresh garlic (2 cloves, minced), a pinch of nutmeg and I did use 2 cups of milk as per the recipe. This was perfect. Thanks!

Quick and delicious!  I used it over a box of whole wheat pasta I was needing to get out of my pantry because my family HATES the whole wheat pasta.  They actually LOVED this!  They didn't even gripe about the pasta...not one comment!  They actually said they LIKED dinner!!  Score!    I used 1 TBSP jarred, minced garlic instead of powder because that's what I had.  I also had a half box of some sliced, fresh mushrooms I needed to use before they went bad.  So I sauted (sp?) them with the butter before adding the rest of the ingredients and made it more of an Alfredo/mushroom sauce.   I did double the pepper and added some salt to taste.    This may not be a super gourmet sauce, but I will keep this recipe for a fast cream sauce I know my family will actually eat!!!!

I just made this! Like another reviewer I couldn't stop TASTING it!! I didn't bother to use garlic powder, I used fresh minced garlic. I sent my brother to the market a few hours ago to get jarred sauce...but I will be returning the jarred sauce to the market today. Never again will I use jarred sauce. Thanks for this great recipe!!

Yum, yum, yum! I was in the mood for some pasta with alfredo one evening but didn't want to run to the store for any missing ingredients like heavy cream. I figured I'd try looking online for an easy alternative & came upon this recipe. I had just enough cream cheese to make a serving for myself & I loved it! I threw in some chopped broccoli...yum. It is such an easy recipe & tastes just like the alfredo from my favorite restaurants. I volunteered to make this for an upcoming holiday pasta dinner & I never typically partake in bringing anything for the holiday meals :)

Definitely a go-to recipe! 2nd time making this. 1st time it was too rich & I had to thin it out w/ water. Everyone still raved about it. This time around I wanted more of a garlic butter cream sauce. Sauteed shrimp, chicken sausage, roma tomatoes, & bella mushrooms in (approx 1 1/4 cup) EVOO (instead of butter) w/ 1tbsp of minced garlic. Added 1/2 pack of cream chz, approx 1/4 cup of shredded parmesan, romano & asagio chz & 2tbsp of grated parmesan. Reduced with some white wine & voila!! Tossed with angel hair pasta & it was perfect.   *All measurements are approximate due to the fact that I rarely measure when cooking.

This is a good recipe (with alterations), but it is not alfredo sauce.  No matter what any other review says you can taste the sourness from the cream cheese.  Yes it is smooth, yes it is cheesy, yes it is good, but it is not IMHO as good as a heavy or light cream based alfredo.  When I make this again (which I will) I will probably use it as a topping to fish or chicken where the sourness plays better instead of against pasta.  I would NEVER put this with shrimp.  The sourness would dominate the delicate taste of the shrimp.

This recipe is so easy and quite good.  I served one half with alfredo and to the other half I added some pesto sauce.  Took the leftovers into the work and the men loved it - one even asked for the recipe!

I followed this recipe exactly and it was way too bland and too thin. It tasted like I was eating watery milk. It definitely needs more garlic or something for flavor , the only way I was able to eat it was to put a bunch of garlic salt and extra parmesean cheese on top. Will not be making again : (

thanks for saving my pizza!!! I usually go foodshopping today, but the kids kept me from it, so with nothing in the frig I did as I always do and made a pizza dough in the bread maker.... rolled it out and realize I have no red sauce, I was about to open a can of diced tomatos when I realized I had a bag of fresh spinage need use...and this became the best dinner ever!!!!!!!!!

Very easy.  I added the fresh garlic to the butter.  The only other changes I made was white pepper and heavy whipping cream instead of milk (to make it lower carb).

It was delicious. the only thing I changed is I had a jar of chopped garlic in oil so I used 1 tbsp of that instead of garlic powder. I served this sauce mixed with fettuccine noodles with scallops and stir fried fresh veggies from my garden was delicious and a hit for a family get together.

I wanted to use fresh garlic instead of the powder and when I converted the powder to cloves (ratio wise) it turned out WAY too garlicky. Next time I'd try it with less garlic. Otherwise, yummy.

good if you like cream cheese sauce for your pasta... even with my changes (adding spices & garlic) along with more cheese and less cream cheese, still tasted too much like cream cheese.

I feel bad for the people who rated this down, they must not have cooked it right....I made this recipe for the first time making any pasta sauce and it was amazing!!! Couldn't stop eating it! I followed the recipe exactly, and it turned out great. Suggestion: try putting it on toasted Italian wheat bread. YUM!!!! In fact, I'm eating the leftovers right now!!

Thanks for posting this!  I didn't have parmesan, so I used Farmers cheese, believe it or not, which I'd imagine it'd just be better with parmesan or gruyere.  - I was making a chicken alfredo lasagna here on allrecipes, but I was supposed to buy TWO jars of alfredo sauce and I only had one.  I figured, okay- then I'll just make some.  So thanks for saving dinner last night, it was deeelish!

This sauce is amazing! just the right amount of every flavor and DEFINITELY not bland at all! I made this up using real garlic and shredded Parmesan instead (its what i had) and it was awesome. For the dinner i was making though i added in 2 cans of regular rotel and it turned it into a spicy tomato alfredo. I also put in 2 green and 1 yellow bell pepper for a little more substance. served it over three cheese spinach ravioli and WOW what an amazing meal! next time i'm adding in chicken and black olives.

This is a good base recipe, but it was missing something.  Mine stayed milky when it was supposed to thicken up and didn't have enough flavor so I added 1/2 T dried parsley, 1/4 C white wine, and a few tbsps of flour (to get it to thicken up).  I also used garlic salt instead of garlic powder. I would recommend buying good parmesan and grating it yourself. Before making these changes, it was bland and runny.  With the changes I would give it 5 stars!

This was superb!  Made homemade pasta and it was perfection!  Will use this recipe from now on!  Thanks!
**UPDATE I noticed that this recipe has an awful lot of butter in it.  Since starting to use this recipe I have cut the butter down to almost half and it still taste WONDERFUL and comes out FANTASTIC!

Five stars for being SUPER easy and SUPER tasty! The only change I made was to add a bit more freshly grated Parmesan (some is good, more is better!) and used fresh garlic instead of garlic powder.

This was a very good recipe.  My husband loved it.  I can believe I am saying this but it almost tasted like there was too much butter in it.  I will be making this again though!!  Very easy and flavorful!  It thickened up nicely too, however, I did cut back on the milk by about 1/2 cup.

Not the best of the best, but will do. Just a tad strong on the cream cheese taste. Add garlic powder and Italian Seasoning to the sauce.

Awesome, tasty, easy recipe!! So convenient and way tastier than any jarred sauce.  Its easier to blend when the cream cheese is room temperature or either warmed in the microwave that way you're not adding cold cream cheese to warm butter...also, try warming the milk for easier combining.  I used some fresh garlic in addition and also some parsley.  Perfect!! Will def keep this around to make over and over.

This was the best alfredo sauce we have ever eaten.  It was easy to make and I used all organic ingredients.  I did add the nutmeg and extra pepper that someone else suggested.  It came out fantastic.

Outstanding, also not as thick as i expected.  I ended up adding a bit on flour at the end to thicken.  Flavor was outstanding and very easy to make.  Fam LOVED it.  Served with ziti shells and baked chicken.  Very Good!!!

I made this recipe as written and was very disappointed with the very bland taste. I used half and half in place of the milk. After tasting at the end I found there was no taste at all so I added a total of 3 cups of Parmesan before it had a taste of Alfredo sauce. Will not make again

This recipe is awesome!  Quick and easy with grilled chicken and light cream cheese.  Definitely add a couple of teaspoons of nutmeg for a more authentic taste.  It's nice not to fuss with fattening cream and egg yolks.

I made this and changed only a couple things. I did use 1 cup milk and 1 cup cream. I didnt use garlic powder and instead used fresh nutmeg. You cant make a cream sauce without fresh nutmeg. It turned out perfectly creamy. I however think it taste just like the kind from the jar you can buy in your grocery store. It was smooth and it was very good but I dont think I will use cream cheese again.

Pretty darn good. Used reduced fat cream cheese and skim milk and it still tasted nice and creamy. As other's suggested used minced garlic instead of the powder.

We didn't really like this sauce. It was simple enough to make, though I wouldn't call it "quick" considering how long it took for the cream cheese to melt in, despite cutting it up a bit first. The sauce, however, was much too rich and creamy for our liking. The taste was VERY rich and it was so creamy that the texture was almost pasty. I even used light cream cheese. Oh, and I used 1 tsp minced garlic instead of the garlic powder. My two-year-old son refused to eat this altogether, and my husband and I felt sick to our stomachs after doing so. I won't be making this again. Thanks anyway!

Didn't taste like any Alfredo I've ever had. It had no real taste to it - sure, it was creamy and garlicky, but even with some other added spices to try and jazz it up, it was disappointing.

I really liked that this recipe was easy and fast to make.  It's great for those without tons of cooking experience like me.  However, it did taste kind of like a fast-food alfredo and a bit too cream-cheesy.  Pretty good, but not exactly Olive Garden.  Next time I'll probably use one of the recipes that uses heavy cream, it's just that this one had all the ingredients I had on hand.

Excellent!  I added dried chives and a package of onion soup mix, minced roasted garlic from a jar, along with some Mrs. Dash type no salt substitute from the Mennonite store.  In addition to the parmesian cheese, I had some 5 cheese Italian cheese I had on hand also.  I cubed up some grilled chicken and simmered for awhile, then added some fett. noodles.  Served with Italian Seasoned Buttery Garlic Bread and Salad.  Yum Yum Yum.  mmmm yummy

This is awesome for being thrown together with ingredients I had on hand.  I used skim goat milk, whipped cream cheese, powdered Kraft Parmesan, and added Italian seasoning (literally what I had on hand).  I followed Reg927s suggestions and it came out great.  Oh, and it makes a lot more than 4 servings- there's a ton of leftover sauce, but that's okay, my husband said he's looking forward to leftovers!

Easy, yummy, and quick. This was the first homemade alfredo sauce I made and I loved it. Not ony did I love it but also my family including my picky seven year old.  I would suggest using real butter opposed to margarine just as a side note.

I made this tonight and it was wonderful!  I used Kraft Philadelphia Sundried Tomato and Basil cream cheese, and cut down to 1 cup of milk.  I poured it over Penne Rigate pasta and seasoned to taste.  It was so good, and my picky husband LOVED it!!

Perfect sauce. I used 2 percent milk and it still made a perfect alfredo. I love the fact that it is better than the jar and the sodium is much less than the jar as well. Perfect recipe all the way around. Thank you.

After reading all the reviews I decided to try this out as-directed first. And let me just say: AMAZING!!! The only did 2 things differently, I used Smart Balance Spread instead of butter (i try not to use butter or margarine), and I added a pinch of Greek Seasoning. I was afraid this would be too liquidy or too cream cheesy, but after simmering it for a few minutes, it was perfect! My boyfriend and I loved it so much I even froze some to use later!  In the future I'd definitely use fresh garlic instead of garlic powder -- if it was this amazing with garlic powder I can't wait to have it with the real deal!!

I don't actually like alfredo sauce (don't know why I wanted to make some...must be because I'm pregnant lol) but this was soooo good. I always have cream cheese around but I would have had to make a trip to the store for heavy cream so this recipe was perfect. I used it to make the "creamy chicken piccata" recipe from allrecipes. The sauce was fantastic! I will use this one again! Unless I lose my taste for alfredo when I'm not pregnant anymore HAHA

Awesome and incredibly easy. It did not taste like cream cheese at all (as I was worried it would). I used minced garlic instead of garlic powder and 1C milk and 1C heavy cream. Also, I ground the black pepper on without measuring, but i'm pretty sure I used more than the recipe called for. Anyway, this was delicious, and for the less than ten minutes it took to make, I'll always make this instead of using canned alfredo sauce in the future.

This sauce is AMAZING. Roomie #1 took the first bite of his pasta and went, "Mmm! This is good!" I love how easy it was to make this. It's great that I don't have to buy any of that jar stuff anymore.

This was delicious and very easy to make!  The only drawback was it was a little on the runny side so I had to add a thickening agent to it.  Next time I'll use only a cup and a half.  It looks scary when making as the cream cheese looks like its curdling or something but when you add the milk it turns right into the perfect sauce.  Def will use this again, thank you!

Simple, quick and very tasty. I've tried other Alfredo sauce recipes with many more ingrediants and this is the simplest and tastes great.  I used Garlic butter instead of butter and garlic powder. My daughter loves it.

Perfect Alfredo sauce. I'm not sure how much milk I ended up using. We like it pretty thick, so instead of measuring it out, I just put a little in at a time till it got to where we wanted it. We used it for a Sea Food Alfredo, so added shrimp, scallops & Salmon. We ended up going a little heavy on the garlic, due to a miniature helper in the kitchen grabbing the bottle and pouring it in, but still tasted great!

We have been using this sauce for sometime. My daughter (15) usually makes it.  I add crushed garlic to the recipe to improve the flavor.  It is very easy and worth it.

This is the best Alfredo sauce I have ever had.  It is also the most fattening.  Tastes great with 1/3 less fat cream cheese, but is still 2/3 fat.

I made this for dinner, and it tasted fantastic! I substituted half of the butter for margarine, and used light cream cheese instead of regular. Topped off with some fresh basil from the garden and mixed with mushrooms and cut up chicken - it was great!

This was very good and super easy! We added steamed broccoli and marinated/grilled chicken. Yum!  I did use 1/2 milk and 1/2 half and half since I had some from some leftover from homemade ice cream. But other than that, made as written. Thanks for a great recipe!

This was easy to make but came out bland.  I added a bunch more pepper, onion powder, some salt, some crushed garlic, and about a 1/4c Cougar Gold cheese.  Then it was great.

This was easy to make and came together nicely, but it was much too salty.  I won't be making this again.

Excellent.  I made this for a family dinner and added shrimp and parsley.  I got compliments over and over again.  I did use half & half instead of milk.  I'll never buy alfredo sauce in a jar again as this was so simple to make.

My son isn't a big fan of Alfredo Sauce but loved this version so did my husband. This was quick, easy and tasty. Based on another reviewer, I used reduced fat cream cheese and skim milk, only change I might make next time is a little less milk.

This sauce is true to it`s name-it is really a quick and easy Alfredo Sauce! The taste and texture are fabulous! Before I made it the first time I was concerned that the Cream Cheese taste might be too strong but it really isn`t. I have made this sauce countless times and to rave reveiws always!!

This is so easy and it turned out so good. I used fat free cream cheese and skim milk to make it a little more diet friendly.  I also added mushrooms and brocolli when we put it on the pasta. My husband said it was the best Alfredo sauce he ever had.

Everyone knows that jarred alfredo sauce is nasty, so I gave this a try instead. While it was really easy to make (delightfully so, actually) I would definitely cut down on the garlic in the future as it was all I could taste. My mother thought it was great, however, so I guess it's just my own personal preference.

This sauce was simple AND delicious. I actually made it as a base for my spinach and artichoke heart pizza this evening. I have leftovers to serve over homemade spinach noodles.  I used fresh minced garlic.  Whisking constantly helped the cheeses to melt well and it turned out very smooth.  I cut the butter down by half.  As others say, it makes a LOT!

Very good...and VERY quick and easy.  Made it just as written with a dash of nutmeg (wasn't sure about that but went on previous reviews) and subbed white cheddar for the parmesan cheese (my parm cheese had turned into a science experiment).  I do question past reviewers claims that, even with their changes, this was "healthy", but that aside, it was quite tasty.  And again, super quick and easy.  Threw it under chicken.  Yummy.

My boyfriend and I love this recipe...I use low fat cream cheese, as well as low fat milk and parm cheese.  I sautee some spinach and sundriend tomatoes with a little oil and a touch of balsamic vinegar...add them to the pasta and pour the sauce on (with grilled chicken of course)!  Thinking about it is making me hungry!  Thank You so much for the recipe!

I scaled this recipe to 2 servings, instead of 4.  It called for 1/2 of 8oz of cream cheese, however I found that adding more is better.  I like the sauce to be very thick.  Also adding a bit of salt was neccessary.

The best alfredo sauce you will ever taste! I used fresh minced garlic with the butter first instead of the powder. I've made this several times alone, but last time I added sauteed shrimp and broccoli too :) MMMMMMMM

This was pretty good. I don't like my sauce so sweet so I used 4 oz cream cheese, but it was still noticably sweet. I used half and half instead of milk and used only 1 cup. I also used fresh chopped parsley in the sauce and basil on the top as I served it I served this on fresh sauteed fish. I first sauteed onions, garlic and sweet red and green peppers untill tender. Add some sundried tomatoes and heat through. keep warm. Then I sauteed the fish. Top the fish with the veges and then the Alfredo sauce, then add the basil and some sundried tomatoes for color. Beautiful!

I'm sorry to say I did not care for this, which is a bummer because I really wanted to. All I could taste was the cream cheese.  It was very overpowering, and I only used one clove of garlic and it was way too garlicy for me.  But maybe that's personal preference.  Anyway, it may be great for some other people, but it's not my cup of tea.  I think if I want alfredo, I'll splurge for the real deal.

Incredible is the only way I can describe this sauce. I think this every bit as good of any Alfredo sauce that you can get at a 4 star restaurant. When melting the better I took 2 large cloves of garlic and grated into the butter. I used 1 cup no fat milk and one cup of cream.  Penzey's Italian spice (1tbsp.)  Fresh ground black pepper. My partner is a very good chef/cook of italian foods, and he loves it. I would highly recommend this recipe to anyone attempting Alfredo for the first time.  Just remember to take you time and not try to rush with high heat etc.

Very good recipe!  Easy to make and absolutely delicious!  The only thing I changed was to use 1 cup low fat milk and 1 cup cream.  I served it with fettuccine and chicken and it was yummy.  I will never use sauce from a jar again!

This recipe is delicious!  I have been making it this way for probably 10 years or so.  I originally found the recipe on the inside of a PHilly Cream Cheese container.  Very good and easy to make.  Sub low fat cream cheese and it is just as good.

So delicious!  I don't understand anyone who DOESN'T love this recipe.  It's simple, full of flavor, and reheats well.  It's a heck of a lot cheaper than those prepackaged sauces, plus tastes far more authentic to me.  I do add a bit more garlic powder & pepper than what's called for, plus some salt.  YUM CITY.

OMG just prepared this for dinner and was a total success... As recommended by other users reduced amount of milk and used garlic instead of garlic powder, also added a pinch of rosemary, 1/8 tbsp oregano and lots of basil.

My family LOVED it. I added some organic basil, creole, Cajun seasoning, and black peppercorn, 3 cloves of garlic instead of the garlic powder  and it was AWESOME this is now the recipe I will use to make Alfredo sauce.

This was a great recipe! I had a little trouble with the butter separating from the sauce once it was finished. I also cut the amount of garlic powder needed in half, since my brother doesn't like it. And for once, my entire family agreed on something: this sauce was fantastic!

This quite simply is the best alfredo sauce!!  Everyone I have made this for absolutely loves it.  Very quick and easy and I haven't had to change a thing.  I also tried many other alfredo sauces and nothing comes close to this one!

I just made the recipe exactly as stated except: One heaping teaspoon of refrigerated garlic added to the butter that is melting.  OMG! THE BEST EVER!  Forget the reviews that can taste the cream cheese.  (Maybe they used grated and not shredded parmesan?)  This is the best alfredo I have ever eaten!    YUMMMY!

This had a good flavor.  My family absolutely loved it, however to me it had a cream cheesy taste to it.  I'm a cream cheese lover and it just didn't taste right to me.  Guess I'm used to OG.

My family loved it!  I used half and half instead of milk and also used minced garlic along with the garlic powder!  I peared it with chicken and have enough left over to use shrimp another day as I made enough for leftovers.

I experimented with this recipe and came out with my own quick and easy sauce- add 1/4 head of garlic, 1/2 a med white onion some half and half (fry with the butter).  No matter what you do the recipe is great as is or as a base for your own creation.  Everyone loved this sauce with shrimp and penne pasta!

One of my favorite things about this recipe is that it's great as leftovers.  Cream and butter based alfredo sauces turn to an oily mess when re-heated.  This stays smooth and creamy.  A family favorite!

I made this tonight for my fiancé’ and he absolutely loved it. I’m rather new to the cooking world, but I’m trying to polish my skills for my soon to be “wife” role. I think this recipe will be one of my staples. I didn’t really measure anything but I think this recipe is pretty versatile. I use both olive oil and butter, used minced garlic instead of garlic powder, and I used parmesan and mozzarella cheese as well as cream cheese. I also cooked scallops before hand and threw them in when the Alfredo was finished. This recipe was a great tool in helping me create a fantastic easy dinner that I’m sure I’ll continue to make for years.

I made this Alfredo saunce on Valentine's Day for my family, and I have to say, this sauce was THE BOMB!!! Best sauce I have EVER had! My husband said that he felt like he was eating in a restaurant! I used 1 1/3 cups of milk and used 2 tablespoons of minced garlic instead of garlic powder. I also added Italian-style diced tomatoes, mushrooms, and broccoli and served it over cheese-stuffed tortellini. Delicious!!

Sooooo delicious!  I didn't have parmesan on hand, but I did have grated Romano, so I used it and it was great!  I made steamed mussels using "Scott Ure's Clams and Garlic" recipe from this site, tossed the mussels and their sauce with some linguine and topped it with this Alfredo sauce.  An absolute keeper! Thank you so much for the best and easiest Alfredo I've ever made!

Delicious! Perfect Quick recipe for Alfredo Sauce! No, it's not restaurant quality but when you're searching for Quick and Easy This one is it! Thus 5 stars! Very tasty and smooth!!! I served with penne and tomatoes(seeds removed) and added Italian seasoning. I also used Garlic Salt since I didn't have powder on hand turned out great!! Next tiem i serve with Grilled Shrimp! Did I mention this was fast. From the time I looked it up and served it on the table 30 minutes max including time for noodles to cook.

Used Smart balance instead of butter, 2% milk, lowfat cottage cheese (only 3/4 of it too), three handfuls of parmesan, added more pepper & a bit of salt. I also used 1 tsp granulated or you could use choped garlic as well as 1 tsp of garlic powder. Really really produced a thick thick sauce, I'm sure it could have taken another cup ofr even two of milk easily. It's still so rich. ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS!

This sauce was so delicious. It tastedMUCH better than any restaurants Alfredo sauce and definetely better than any jar sauce. It was so creamy and flavorful and simple. I served this with some pan-seared skinless chicken tenders breaded with parmesan bread crumbs, some fresh parsley and basil and diced tomatoes. What a wonderful meal. Thanks!!!

I found this recipe under Vegetarian, and I think that if you are going to use cream cheese, then you may as well make a normal Alfredo sauce because this sauce is every bit "COW" as any other fattening animal recipe out there and tastes like it tool.

good! It took kind of a while to thicken, so I added a little more parmesan cheese to help speed things up a little. Definitely stir often, or this will scorch on the bottom of the pan. I used this both on pasta and as the alfredo sauce for Artichoke & Spinach Dip Restaurant Style. Very yummy :)

I did add the nutmeg as others suggested, however I also substituted 1/4 of the Parmesan cheese with fresh grated Romano.  I added the cheese in the butter and cream cheese before adding the milk so that it was smooth.  Not sure if it is because I used Skim milk, but we only needed half of the milk to reach a good consistency.

It did not clump.  It did not look greasy.  It was simple.  What a hit!!!  I added Italian seasoning and used, of course, fresh garlic and onion.  Served on sauteed chicken breasts.  Yummy!!!!!

This sauce is great! I used about a 1/4 cup of butter - my sister in law said 1/2 was just a little much for her taste. Will keep this recipe forever!

OMG...best recipe I've ever used for Alfredo Sauce! The best! I followed the recipe & used other reviewers suggestions of skim milk & low fat cream cheese...I also added 2T. of Asiago cheese (because I like the added flavor) But absolutely the BEST ever sauce! Will be saving & using from now on! WOW! Yum! Thank you for sharing! (-=

Not a huge fan of alfredo but this looked so easy I had to try it for my son, who loves noodles. It is easy enough to even do in the micorwave. Make sure cream cheese is room temp. The flavor is not too bad if you doctor it up to hide the cream cheese flavor. I used garlic and added oregano. I added quite a bit more milk. It got way too thick for me. Absolutely use fresh Parmesan. And make sure it is grated not shredded. The shredded will clump together into a ball. The grated will disperse into the sauce better.

This was very good.  I tried to reduce calories by using low fat cream cheese, non fat milke, and smart butter.  I also added red pepper.

So easy and delicious.  The family liked it. I only made half, plenty for 4 people. I used 1% milk and light cream cheese to cut down on calories and cholesterol, and a little less parmesan to cut down on the salt.  It took a little longer to thicken but so yummy, especially with the garlic powder and  freshly ground pepper.  Next time I may try it with a cholesterol-lowering margarine, although I hesitate to mess with the buttery flavour...I also might try it with shredded Italian 6-cheese blend.  I also like the idea someone else had of using this as a base sauce with mushroom, fresh basil, sun-dried tomatoes etc.  I used this over veggies as well as pasta, and even mixed it with some canned diced Italian tomatoes and browned ground turkey to make a creamy tomato sauce. Versatile!

I have just read through a lot of reviews.  On the rare negative review, there seemed to be a problem with consistency.  I cannot stress enough the need to use low heat and....whisk, whisk, and whisk some more, especially after adding the cheese. I used the whisk almost contantly. My son-in-law works in well known resturant, and he also gave it five stars.

Easy and awesome! What a great recipe for a rushed evening--the whole family loved it. I crushed fresh garlic into the melted butter and added basil after the milk got the sauce going, but otherwise just followed the recipe and it worked! Deliciously rich and satisfying.

This was a phenomenal alfredo sauce. I made it as is and it turned out perfectly. Next time, I think I might add a bit less milk and some oregano like some other reviewers suggested.

I modified this recipe a bit because I didn't have regular cream cheese or parmasean so I used herb and garlic cream cheese  and mozarella and just added a pinch of garlic powder.  It turned out great!

I LOVE this recipe. At first I didn't know if this was going to taste good or not and this definitely exceeded my expectations. I have made this recipe numerous times and all my friends LOVE it. I use a little bit less parmesen cheese than the recipe calls for, but this is absolutely an amazing recipe. I'm glad I found it!

The name says it all. I only had cream cheese with chives and onions but it was a good substitute. I think next time I will use less parmesan per my DH's choice. And I used white pepper instead of black. Will make again.

My family loved this!  It was very easy to make and I already had the cream cheese due to buying extra for the holidays.  I used the leftover the next day and spread it on a pizza crust with chicken and shredded cheese on top.  My 13 year old couldn't get enough of this and he loves alfredo sauce. Thank you for taking the time to share this recipe.

Use REAL cheese, not the canned variety, makes all the difference in the world... also used fresh garlic and a dash of nutmeg...... sooo simple and sooo delish!  Going on my rotation, thanks Dawn!

Recipe was relatively good.  Personally it was a little salty for me.  In my opinion I think it would be better with a dash of lemon juice, less garlic and perhaps a little more cheese and heavy cream versus milk.  Definitely was a simple and great start :)

This is awesome! thanks for sharing!
Edited to add.... I make this using light butter, reduced fat parm, reduced fat cream cheese, and low fat soymilk and it's still wonderful!  (only 410 calories per serving rather than 600+)

My wife made this for us today and she used exactly what the recipe called for aside for the cheese: She used a cup of Parmesan, added some onion powder, basil, rosemary and oregano (We have a spice grinder) It was not at all cream cheesy tasting. She added chopped spinach (the kind that comes frozen in a box) and Italian sausages cut into coins and then halved. We had this with three cheese tortellini.

I have been making a variation for years.  In mine I use veggie cream cheese - started with just a T of it, but now I use all the veggie type.  I make with shrimp and always sprinkle tiny chopped tomato pieces on the top for color.

Very easy and good.  I put about 3 t. of jarred minced garlic instead of powdered.  I poured it over a mixture of farfalle pasta, mushrooms, bacon, spinach, and chicken.  My family loved it.  The only thing I might do next time is saute some onion with the bacon.  YUM!

This recipe isn't necessarily quicker than "normal" alfredo sauce, but I almost NEVER have heavy cream in the fridge, so this recipe works great for me! I use 1/3 less fat cream cheese and skim milk and it turns out really good, and I ALWAYS leave out the garlic powder. I like to saute a zucchini, a yellow squash, and some fresh garlic in a little olive oil and chop up a few tomatoes and add them to the pasta and sauce. Yum! I've made this sauce recipe many times, and it all turns out great.

This recipe was an instant hit!  We love garlic so instead of using garlic powder, I minced 2 garlic cloves and added it to the melting butter in the saucepan.  This made a HUGE difference in the flavor.  I am NEVER buying alfredo sauce again.  Thanks for an excellent recipe!  Definitely a keeper!

I thought making the sauce would be complicated. But when i found this recipe it looked easy enough.  So I decided to give it a go.  I made it with one change, I didn't have butter. So I used "I Can't Believe It's Not Butter". It turned out great.  My kids absolutely loved it.  This will definite be a go-to dinner staple.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!!

Not 100% spot on authentic alfredo, but pretty good none the less.  I took others suggestions and added oregano and a dash of nutmeg which really made a difference.  This will definitely do in a pinch.

This Alfredo sauce is so easy, you would never know there is cream cheese in it!  Instead of Garlic powder I used chopped Garlic from a jar and used fresh grinded pepper YUMMY!!!!!!

I made this sauce and it was great! However I added and oregano and other Italian spices and also used all whipping cream instead of milk. The only real issue I had though was seperation. It did not reheat well due to the amount of seperationt that occured.

This was good however, I like my Alfredo with more flavor. It diffidently needed thyme and basil. While it was cooking I thought it was way too thin. Then I added it to the pasta and it immediately thickened....almost to much. So be aware it might look thin but more than likely it won't be once added to the pasta.

This is such a great and quick way to make alfredo sauce, and the best part about it, is it's VERY good! I make this all the time with angel hair or tortellini and it's a quick and family favorite! And it's very cheap to make! With the pasta, sauce, and choice of meat (Chicken or shrimp recommended) it is EASILY an under 20 dollar meal. Under TEN if you shop wisely. Just make sure you don't go too cheap on the cheeses. It's important if you get good cheeses for the sauce. Other than that, enjoy!

This is, without a doubt, the BEST alfredo. I do not usually like alfredo, many places make it too heavy and it spoils my appetite.  The only thing I did differently was to use margarine (it was what was in the fridge).  This was nice and creamy, with an excellent flavor.  Next time I may add a few herbs, but this stands on its own as is.  Plus it's quick and easy to make!  This will become a regular at my house.

Great flavor and soooo easy.  I accidently used heavy cream because I got confused looking a several recipes prior but it came out great with the heavy cream.  I'll never buy store bought again with Lord knows what in it.

This sauce was delicious except for the fact that the garlic was overwhelming. I will definitely make this again, but I will reduce the amount of garlic. Otherwise it was awesome! You can't even tell that it was made with cream cheese.

This sauce is amazing! I followed a few other reviewers suggestions and used 1/2 heavy whipping cream and 1/2 milk, a dash of nutmeg and fresh garlic. I also added 1/2 a chopped shallot.  I tossed it with some penne pasta and sauteed yellow & red peppers, mushrooms and carrots. Served a grilled chicken breast on top.  The whole family left the table groaning because they ate too much. Thanks for the great recipe!

I like this sauce.... but it doesnt taste like alfredo to me and thats why it doesnt get 5 stars. I may have done something wrong though I read the directions over and over and cant see what I might have misunderstood. It just wasnt spectacular.

My 25 yo son didn't tink it was possible to make a good alfredo sauce.  as I was melting the butter and cream cheese, he was reading the directions and adding ingredients as directed, he was still skeptical.  I used a little more cheese than directed, but he loves it!!  The recipe was easy and delicious.

This is an excellent alfredo sauce that is easy to make and delicious.  You would never guess that it is made with cream cheese.  There might be a little too much garlic powder for some.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I LOVE this sauce.  It's creamy, easy and delicious.  I used fresh garlic rather than garlic powder, and sauteed it in the butter before adding the cream cheese.  I also took some reviewers' advice and added nutmeg, oregano and basil.  It turned out wonderfully.

I loved this recipe. Definitely one i will be making again. I substituted the ingredients with the reduced versions (reduced fat cream cheese, milk, butter) to cut down on the fat content. It was served with grilled chicken sauted with onions and garlic. The recipe does make quite abit of sauce so i will be freezing the left overs for future meals.

This is fantastic. My husband who normally doesn't like alfredo sauce at all LOVED it. I pretty much followed the recipe, only added a bit of garlic powder for a small hint of garlic. I highly recommend this and I will be making it often, as it's not only delicious but its super quick and easy to make!

I made this tonight for the first time just like the recipe stated and my family loved it! My daughter said it tasted like Olive Garden’s. Next time I do want to try it with half whipping cream just to see the difference.

Not as rich as my usual recipe, but definitely much healthier. I used lite butter, 1/3 fat cream cheese and FF milk. (No wonder it wasn't as rich!) My hubby prefers it over the usual rich thick one though. He would probably give it 5 stars.

I hesitated to make this recipe for a while, having read the negative reviews and been put off.  I'm so glad I decided to go ahead and try it.  I won't ever buy jarred sauce again.  The only changes I made was adding chopped spinach to the sauce.  I tossed it with farfalle pasta and cooked chicken breast.  Will definitely make again.

I lighten up on the butter a little - didn't use quite as much Parmesan either. It was a bit thin so I added a few tsp. of cornstarch to thicken.  It was very rich and creamy - I used it to make Chicken Lasagna.  This will be my only Alfredo Sauce recipe!

For the first time in history, my 8 year old son asked for THIRDS!  He hates pasta and usually chokes it down with some milk.  This sauce is great.  My (picky) family loved it!

This is the only homemade alfredo recipe I've ever tried.  I love it, and it's super easy.  Serve immediately.  I made it ahead once, and it got too thick.

I lightened this up a bit by using whipped cream cheese, low fat milk and whipped butter.  I had to let it cook a bit longer to thicken up but it was delicious.  Oh, I also added a few grains of nutmeg.

This is the best alfredo sauce ever.  I think I used a bit too much cheese and need to reduce it next time, but it was great and even the kids liked it.  Far superior to jar sauces.

I loved this recipe. I read through it and added my own touch. I added the butter with garlic powder and cut up some garlic cloves as well, added cream cheese, then milk (about half what was called for) I then added salt, parmesan, and seasonings. I also added ricotta cheese and fresh parsley. It was wonderful!!!! I baked mine and made a little extra sauce to pour on when the baked pasta was done. Delicious.

great sauce!  I added some salt.  While I melted the butter, I sauteed some diced sweet onion, green and red bell peppers with dried basil before I added the cream cheese.  I steamed some broccoli and tossed it with chicken and angel hair... awesome

This recipe was great because I had all the ingredients available - and it allowed for easy modification to make it my own. I used 1 T of minced garlic instead of the powder to the basic recipe. Then, after it was heated, I added two slices provolone cheese, two cubed chicken breasts and a half-pound of left-over baby bella mushrooms that I had sauteed in butter, onions, and garlic.   It didn't come out as creamy as some alfredos, but I like that the sauce remained saucy (instead of paste) as it got cooler in my plate while I was eating.

This is great! I tossed with some gnocchi for my fiance's birthday dinner along with veal parmigiana. The only complaint, it makes a LOT! Next time I'd cut back to half or even a quarter of the written recipe. It seriously makes like 5 cups!!

This was so easy to make.  Delicious!  It is now my favorite alfredo sauce recipe.  It says 4 servings, but it's more like 8.  I doubled it for our large family and still had leftovers for several more servings.

Words cannot express how much I love this recipe. I usually use low or no fat milk and cream cheese and it's still awesome (if a little thin). I always throw in a few crushed garlic cloves in addition to the garlic powder to more closely mimic the sauce at my favorite italian restaurant.

Loved this recipe. I added onion and garlic. I substituted part of the milk with half and half (and didn't use 2 full cups of liquid)and added less cream cheese, and maybe a dash more Parmesan. The asiago addition is a great idea and I may try that next time. I also served (pasta, of course and)chicken breasts, which I first browned in EVOO, then added onion, garlic, salt, pepper and fresh basil leaves on a low simmer. My 13-year-old son was crazy over this recipe and he's a picky eater.

We Just finished up eating this for dinner. I used Ziti and threw in some chicken. I am overdue for grocery shopping and was looking for something quick and easy with what we had! Only had 4 ounces of Parmesian cheese, and no garlic powder and it still came out amazing! Everyone loved it, and even my sisters friends (all teens!!) enjoyed it!

This is a fantastic and quick recipe.  My family really likes it!  I saute 12oz fresh spinach in olive oil and a 1 clove minced fresh garlic and then add to the finished sauce.  Serve with grilled chicken and pasta.  YUM!

Fast recipe for ingredients I always have on hand and with a family on the run some times that what I need.  I served this over left over spaghetti with cut up chicken breast from the crock pot, a side of frozen broccoli steamed in the microwave = a fast meal.  Now that I know the family liked this recipe I will try to trim down the fat content as some others have done.  Thanks for sharing :)

This is easy.  All I had on hand was a combination Asiago/Parmesan cheese.  The Asiago cheese gave it a little punch.

I followed the recipe exactly.  It came out tasting like cream cheese, and super-creamy.  A very easy recipe to make (and test out), but personally, I won't be making this again.

This was delicous!! I made it last night to pour ontop of chicken, broccoli ziti. It was amazing!! Soo much better than the jar stuff. And it was so easy & quick to make so that was an added plus! The only thing was it was a little thinner than I would have liked. I think next time I will cut down on the milk a bit. But other than that it was awesome!!!

Delicious and easy! I used 1/3 less fat cream cheese and 1% milk and the sauce turned out creamy and delicious.

Like others, I cut the amount of butter to 3/4 of the original quantity. I also used 1/3 fat cream cheese, and skim milk. It turned out very well, but you can definitely tell it is made with garlic powder - yuck. Next time I will use fresh garlic. I didn't have any this time, unfortunately.   I put the Parmesan cheese in before the milk so it would melt... I hate the gritty texture.   I also added oregano and nutmeg, and will add even more next time. This is great and easy!  Finally, this makes a TON of sauce. I cut the recipe down to two servings and it still made enough for at least 3.

Very quick, easy sauce.  I had to add more pepper to balance out the garlic and cream cheese flavor, but otherwise very nice!

Our family loves this sauce.  I've only used grilled chicken and pasta with this sauce but am looking forward to taking the recipe with us to make for my family on our vacation on the coast of Florida and using fresh shrimp as well!

I'm constantly trying new Alfredo sauce recipes, as its a favorite in my house, and I despise the jar kinds.  This one was really tasty, although I initially only selected it because I had about five things of cream cheese and no cream.    The taste really is very good, although I think I do slightly prefer a more traditional Alfredo sauce.

Fast, Easy, and very delicious.  I steamed a package of veggies to add to the sauce which I thought added to the meal. I used tortelini.  I would love to try to make it with less fats.  I will be making it again.  Oh, it makes alot of sauce.

I made this sauce tonight to for a pizza, and it was delicious! I followed the recipe as is except used low fat cream cheese and olive oil instead of butter. I also added black pepper and dried basil to taste. Outstanding! This recipe will be my staple alfredo sauce from now on!

I made this last night for my boyfriend and some friends for dinner.I used it with cheese ravioli. They all loved it! My one friend is not big on white sauce but he really liked this one. I used fresh garlic instead of powder and added a pinch of nutmeg. This recipe will be used often.

Have used this recipe many times. I use lo-fat cream cheese and extra garlic powder and Parmesan. My husband does not like cream cheese, but he loves this Alfreda sauce. The sauce is creamy and very flavorful. I use it in my chicken alfredo all the time.

Very quick and easy!  Like others, i used non-fat cream cheese, low-fat milk and only half the butter.  I added more garlic powder for flaver (i'll try fresh garlic next time) and I used a little more salt and shredded parmiggiano regiano instead of grated parmasean.  I served it over multi-grain pasta with salmon, asparagus and zuccini.  it was great!! i will make it again.  I can only imagine how great it would be if I used the fatty stuff! :)

This was really good!  We recently ate out and my 4 y.o. had alfredo for the first time and loved it, so I was looking to recreate an alfredo sauce minus some of the fat.  I used 1/3 less fat cream cheese and skim milk and it turned out great!  I just poured it over whole wheat noodles and the toddlers (2,3,& 4) ate it up! I only made 1/2 the recipe and it was plenty for lunch.

This is so far the best alfredo sauce I've found. I never would have thought to use cream cheese. I used fat-free, and next time will reduce the butter like other reviewers have tried - just in the interest of reducing cals. But loved this and thanks so much for the recipe.

An excellent, quick alfredo sauce.  Adjust the amount of cream cheese to your personal tastes, and the result will be a perfect alfredo sauce!  I use about 4 oz. cream cheese with 6 oz. parmesan.  Also, I mellow out the flavor with a small handful of shredded mozzarella.  Don't add too much or your sauce WILL turn rubbery. Very, very tasty!!

Easy Peasy...Thats what I'm talking about. Being a working parent of an active family could not have an easier supper meal. The whole family loved it. It has an incredible flavor. I did sub. the garlic powder and chopped up 2 small garlic cloves and sauted with the butter. Also, putting in sea salt and a good heaping of oregano, 1 can drained mushroom and whatever forzen vegys you have in the freezer if you like. I had broccoli, carrots, califlower mix makes this dish irresitable. Grilled chicken gives it that extra flavor for the best alfredo sauce ever.....

This was really great and easy, I will never buy it ready made from the supermarket again. I do miss some spiciness though as I am a spicy girl, will possibly try adding some chilli next time. Even my son who claims he hates pasta loves this recipe!

Wow!!!  This was soooo good!  We served it over lobster and crab ravioli (store bought).  It tasted just like Olive Garden's alfredo sauce!  Next time I will make it with shrimp.  Have some fresh, warm breadsticks to dip with!!!!

I made this last night and it was so easy and so yummy, way better than store bought bottled alfredo sauce. I did make a few alterations...While melting the butter and the cream cheese I added a garlic clove cut in half and then reduced the garlic powder to 1 tsp. I served my sauce with Cheese Tortelini with a a cup of frozen peas and real bacon pieces sprinkled on top....My Family LOVED it even my picky 3 yr old daughter.....I can't wait to make it for friends and family.

Wonderful but unless you want to drink the sauce, it could be cut in 1/2 and mixed with the pasta. Great flavor!! and easy as can be.  Subbestions, you could add chicken or shrimp and mushrooms, or ham and peas for a carbonara..No matter what you add, this is FABULOUS AND FAST!! thanks

The only change i made was add dried parsley and a little salt.  It was YUMMY.  will def. make it again and have my hubby try it

I thought this recipe was great! It was really easy to make because it uses common household items (Like cream cheese instead of whipping cream, or half & half). The only draw back is, everytime I make this, it seems to be too runny. I don't think I'm leaving on the stovetop too long, but I might be, who knows. Anyways, If this happens to you, a quick fix is to use a quick mix flour (Like a sauce thickener for gravy). It helps tons!

Perfect!  I didnt really measure but I think I added a little less milk and a little more parmesean.  Very creamy and rich.  Everyone loved it!  No evidence of cream cheese whatsoever.  Mmmmm, thanks!  =)

I was out of Alfredo sauce, but did a quick Google search and this recipe came up.  I'm always looking for things I can make with ingredients found in the fridge.  Fortunately I had all the ingredients and in a couple of minutes had the perfect sauce.  My 5 yo loved it!

I LOVED this sauce!  It tasted great, and totally fooled my foodie date.  I put it in a lasagna so I wasn't too worried about the consistency.  The cream cheese didn't really break down and melt all the way though.  If I had been making it for a fettuccine or something, I just would have run the immersion blender it is for a bit, and it would have been perfect!  It does not taste jarred at all, unlike what some other reviewers had to say.  Jarred sauce is disgusting.  Make sure you use regular cream cheese, and not low fat.

I would ABSOLUTELY give this ecipe four stars if i could as well, with a few changes (which others mentioned).  Namely, fresh minced garlic in place of the powder, less milk.  And be patient!  The sauce is amazing when it thickens up.  I have also frozen the leftovers several times, and they are still great.  LOVE IT!

This was DE-LISH! I read reviews before hand and I too used half milk, half cream and half parmesan, half romano cheese. I did not find the cream cheese over powering at all. The texture is great and it reheats wonderfully! This is definitely a keeper in our house!!

Excellent!  Never would have thought to use cream cheese.  The best Alfredo sauce I have ever made.  I added chopped spinach and chicken to it and let it simmer together for a bit then poured over some pasta.

This is really good but to make it great sub one cup of the milk for heavy whipping cream. The texture becomes more creamy and its delightful. Not a hint of cream cheese, though I like cream cheese and that wouldn't be terrible

I am giving this 5 Stars, I am sure it would have been extremely fabulous if I had followed the recipe. Had all the ingredients out to use, I thought. I was tempering the butter and cream cheese. My husband interrupted me, telling me "I had to go to Home Depot for him to get light bulbs for a ceiling fan he was installing." (Home Depot sold him the wrong lights) We have all heard a variation on that story. (Smiles)  When I returned I started cooking everything. The aroma was wonderful, consistancy was the pitts. Maybe I should check the amounts of ingredients, before I start, everything was right except for the butter. I had doubled the amount of butter. Oh Well, add some more milk, after fixing all my mistakes. It came out tasting great, consistancy wasn't what I wanted. Poured sauce over Bow Tie Noodles, Served with Butterfly Pork Chops, Italian Mixed Veggies, Italian Garlic Bread and a Chardony Wine. (Moral to this review while cooking. Don't run errands for your husband while trying to fix dinner.) The next time I make this I will make sure I have all the correct amounts ready to go. Thanks for a great recipe.   I have 2 Saint Bernards (200 pounds each) that stay in the kitchen with me while I cook, they are no trouble at all, they just lay there waiting for Mom to drop goodies.(Smiles) Peggy BigDogsMom

This gets 5 stars simply for how quick and easy it is.  It tastes great, although I have had better at a restaurant, this is still the best one I have ever made.  My only addition was nutmeg.  Also sub. heavy cream for milk.

Simply the best hands down. I have used powdered and fresh garlic. Fresh garlic added so much more to the taste.

Good.  Mine turned out a bit thin but good.  I suggested definitely letting it stand to thicken before adding it to the noodles.

This was incredibly easy and delicious! I fed about 25 people today using this recipe times 6. I used fresh garlic instead of powder and included romano with the parmasean. I also used cream instead of milk.  It was nice and creamy and extremely flavorful. I did a dash of nutmeg like others suggested. After I poured the sauce over the pasta I toped with chopped tomatoes, green onions and grilled chicken breasts. Very acctractive and mmmmmm!..... People were raving about the sauce! Highly recommend this recipe for those who want to serve a LOT of people and are on a budget and who want many COMPLIMENTS.

delicious and easy! even my DH, who doesn't like white sauces, gave his compliments to the chef ;) to prepare this sauce, I halved the recipe and it fed my family of 5 quite nicely. as other reviewers suggested, I did add a dash of nutmeg; I also added 1/8 t of dry mustard, used white pepper instead of black, and subbed heavy cream for half of the milk. I tossed the sauce w/vermicelli and fresh spinach and topped each serving w/a sprinkling of pine nuts - my whole family, including my kids, gave this two thumbs up! it's a keeper! :)

After eating @ an italian restaurant this past wknd, I wanted to duplicate the amazing meal we had. Tortellini in alfredo sauce with prosciutto. I will say, I think my meal was as good if not better than theirs. I tripled the recipe (big family), & added minced garlic, otherwise, made exactly as recipe indicates. It made a huge batch. The only thing I'd do differently is cut down on the butter, especially if I triple the batch. It was plenty rich on it's own. I may add peas or asparagus to it next time with the prosciutto. Add some candles, a glass of wine and some bread and you just created a very romantic getaway to Italy. YES, it's that good!   UPDATE: made this a second time & used diced, store bought, pre-cooked chicken & added broccoli that I had partially steamed. Again, very yummy. This is a nice basic recipe for the sauce. You can snazz it up any way you'd like.

This was an excellent recipe.  However, it makes a lot of sauce.  The listed 4 serving size would be a very large serving.  I measured the amount of sauce, and there was about 6 cups of sauce with this recipe.  I used about 1/4 cup of sauce on my noodles (1 1/4 cup) and chicken, and it was very saucy.  It is a very rich sauce so a little is very filling.  I will definitely make this again, but I will make a half recipe.  I used reduced fat cream cheese, skim milk, and only 3/4 stick of margarine.  It was great.

This sauce was great. I actually had some cream cheese that I mixed with a little italian dressing seasoning packet. I didn't even have any milk so I used chicken broth to thin it out. It turned out perfect. Everyone in  my house loved it!

I used light cream cheese and half and half.  It was easily 6-7 servings and pretty thick.  It was really good, my fiance says he'd have it again! I think next time I'd use less butter and maybe add some veggies.  All said and done great dinner!

Wow!  This alfredo sauce is absolutely scrumptious and oh-so-simple to make!  No hint of a cream cheese taste at all.  I threw in a teaspoon of minced garlic with the butter while it melted, then added 1/2 a teaspoon of garlic powder with the milk.  For the parmesan is used part shredded and part grated parm/ramano combo.  The result was perfect!  I served it over fettucine with cubed pre-cooked chicken thrown into the mix (a great time-saver!).  YUM!!  Thanks for sharing :)

This recipe certainly was "easy" but not quick enough for me.  I stood and stirred for 20 minutes before the sauce finally became thicker.  I added 2 t. oregano, 1 t. basil and a dash of nutmeg after reading other reviewers and it tasted GREAT!  Definetely a keeper!

I have tried a few recipes to make alfredo and this one by far using the cream cheese was extremely tasty and I made a flair or two for some added taste and it came out wonderful simply dice half of an onion and ad 3 table spoons of minced garlic and one cooking spoon of olive oil and simmer before adding the everythign in order as dirrected in the recipe it gives it more flavor....

Fanstic and extremely close to the taste of the original. Super fast & easy to make. Per other reviewer's suggestions, I added a 2 cloves of crushed garlic to the butter,1 1/3 cups of milk and a dash of oregano, and a dash of nutmeg to the sauce. Fantastic - it's a keeper in my recipe box!

LOL I did add oregano, minced garlic and added more butter and parmesean cheese, also instead of whole milk I used 2% reduced fat milk and tasted GREAT! I'm not much of an alfredo eater BUT this recipe is by far the BEST I've had.

The recipe was easy to make, and the texture was nice and creamy. However, the sauce did not have the "Alfredo Sauce" taste. All I could taste was the cream cheese. If I were to make this again, I would cut down on the cream cheese and possibly add a little garlic salt.

I have made this recipe several times now, and it always turns out fantastic. Scaling it down to 1 serving size is definitely enough for two people. I wouldn't change a thing!

Yum! This truly is "easy" -- and delicious! I substituted the butter with lower fat margarine (smart balance), low-fat cream cheese, and used 1% milk - and it was still creamy and tasty. Served it over whole wheat penne, and some blackened chicken breast - and it was great. Will definitely make this one again!

I was extremely surprised after I actually made this recipe. I'm normally pretty skeptical when it comes to other peoples recipes, but this one was wonderful. I will never go back to ragu, or classico etc. again.. I made it for two and just added about 1/4 cup more Parmesan then what the recipe called for. All I can say is Delicious! I would recommend it to anyone looking for a great pasta.

Simple, Easy, Delicious!  I used two cloves of fresh garlic in place of the garlic powder added to the butter, I also used 1% milk instead of cream and it was still thick and delicious.  I also added fresh nutmeg as others suggested. A simple recipe my family loves. Very nice!

I had this recipe in my recipe box for over a year and kept forgetting about it.  I made it one night and my son RAVED about how much he loved it with his noodles.  I used the lower fat cream cheese with no problem.  I did use a fresh garlic clove instead of the powdered stuff.  A great and easy cheese sauce, yum!

For taste, this was terrific.  But what do you expect from butter, cream cheese and milk mixed with garlic salt?  I sampled just a wee bit and it was phenomenal.  That said, I just couldn't bring myself to eat more than a teaspoon on account of the guilt.  Husband LOVED it!!

This is sooo addictive, because it's so easy to make. This ingredients are simple and it only takes 5 minutes to prepare! Great over tube pasta! (I've double the parmesan intake for more creamy goodness)

I made this sauce to go with another recipe and though I never tasted it alone, my finished product was wonderful!  I believe this sauce was a great contribution to the dish and I will use it from now on when I make meals that require alfredo sauce.

This is the best Alfredo on the site that I have tried...so far... I did use part cream/part milk and I added parsley also. A little salt helps and a little (very little) but of nutmeg. I really liked to and so did the people I was feeding. I have to cut a star because I think it is better with less milk I used about 1 3/4 cup and not the whole amount. But overall it is the best so far, just needs a little bit of dressing up.

Excellent! The flavor did not taste at all like cream cheese to me. I added extra garlic powder to the butter, and some basil paste. Also, I only used a 1 1/2 cups of milk as the sauce was pretty thin. I added 2 cups each of diced ham and green peas and served over fettuccine. Delish!!

Tasty. Nice to have a quick easy alfredo sauce. Will try fresh garlic the next time. Recipe did taste a little too processed with the garlic powder, bitter.

This was the most delicious meal I have ever made in twenty minutes.  I did not change the recipe one bit and it was fabulous.  Using a whisk really helps with the cream cheese.  Thank you so very much.  We will have it often.

I've been trying to master alfredo sauce for years and just when I thought I had it down, I see this recipe.  It's amazing.  The only thing I changed was using only 1 cup of milk.  Yummy!

I switched it up just a little. I used real garlic in place of powder, adding it to the melted butter first and letting it saute for a few minutes. I also used Half and Half for a creamier sauce. Some Italian seasonings and seasoned pepper to taste. I poured this over Angel Hair Pasta that had been topped with Drunken Cajun Chicken cubes. But that's a whole other recipe. It was so good it was the first thing I smelled when I walked in my kitchen this morning.  If it lingers that long in the home, imagine how long it will linger on your pallet!

The only change I made was adding fresh garlic. I was shocked at how much of a difference the cream cheese made, it was soooo creamy and flavorful. I really enjoyed it, thank you for the recipe!

This recipe saved dinner tonight!! I was making Chicken Broccoli Alfredo and I usually use a store bought jar sauce - but when I was ready to use my jarred sauce, pulled it out of the pantry and it was bad - the pop-top was popped.  I rushed to Allrecipes to find an easy recipe and it didn't fail.  Some recipes called for heavy cream...which I didn't have on hand.  This one called for cream cheese - so I tried it and was delicious. Kids loved it too - I doubt I will buy another jarred alfredo sauce again. This tasted really fresh..and easy to make!!

I haven't eaten a lot of Alfredo sauces to know how well this one compares, but my husband says it's really, really good.  Very easy to make, too.  Thickens as it cools.  I used the 1/3 reduced fat cream cheese, fresh garlic, and skim milk.

You HAVE TO try this recipe!  It is soooo YUMMY!  The first time I made this I used fat-free cream cheese and I didn't like it at all.  But I was determined to make this work for me because of all the reviews.  My second attempt I decided to use regular cream cheese instead of fat-free and it turned out like everyone said - DELICIOUS!  And it's super easy, too!  I followed the suggestion of other reviews and added the parmesan w/ the cream cheese.  Will definetly use fresh garlic next time and add chicken or shrimp.  Tastes just like Olive Garden - seriously! THANK YOU!

This was so wonderful and very easy! I followed the popular reviewer's tips (1 and 1/3 cup of milk, 4oz parm, etc) and it turned out wonderfully. The next time I made it, I used 1 oz of grated parmesan and 3 oz of store brand italiano cheese and it was more delicious this time! It's a keeper

This is really good! I dont know why some people didnt think so. The reason theres not tons of seasonings in the recipe is cuz seasonings are a personal preference. This is just a base recipe. You can add what ever seasonings you want.  I added minced onion, minced garlic, salt, and pepper. It was really good. (Served it over "Grandmas Noodles 2" from this site) I also use 1 cup grated italian cheese blend instead of parmesan and i use only 1.5 cups milk. i blogged about this recipe on my recipe site anickh(dot)blogspot.com

Followed the recipe precisely. It's very easy to make.  Excellent flavour and consistency.  This is a very versatile sauce.  Added sundried tomatoes and spinach and served on penne.  Also used it as a sauce for pizza and used spinach, mozzarella and chicken for toppings.  It was an excellent dish too.  This recipe makes a lot.  I used this amount for the above two dishes and still have some left over.  Really beats store bought.  Thanks for this excellent recipe.

I loved this recipe!  The sauce was creamy and flavorful, even with the lower calorie changes I made.  I used a stick of 50/50 butter and Omega3 spread, reduced calorie cream cheese, 1 1/2c. skim milk, and 4oz of freshly grated aged parm.  I agree with other posters that whisking the butter and cream cheese was key, as was adding the milk slowly.  I didn't have any issues with lumps, and my hubs was impressed!  This will be my alfredo recipe from now on.

I loved this recipe, but the "better-half" wasn't won over with it, so I can only rate as a 4 star. Regardless, the cream cheese was the key to achieving a wonderful texture, and didn't affect the taste (in my opinion).

it was really easy, but i followed it to a t & it just tasted flavorless to me. would be a good base (texture was perfect, & again, super easy,)to doctor up though- cajuin spice made a big difference.

This was very good.  I added shrimp and mushroom to the recipe.  I sauted actual garlic and mushrooms, then added the shrimp.  Then I used the recipe.  It turned out really good, but a little thin.  Next time I will add a little flour.

I loved it when it was fresh and warm, but the Leftovers got grainy and sort of liquidy at some parts. I served with Breaded Chicken, and tossed it with some Broccoli. I loved it!

Yummy!  I followed this recipe exactly and it came out great.  Very simple, and ingredients that most people would have on hand.  It makes quite a bit, so I will make a half batch in the future.  My family gave it rave reviews.

I followed the recipe exactly and it came out much to0 watery. I let it sit and it still didn't thicken.  Also, there wasn't enough flavor... I would next time use less milk, more cheese. Good start for a quick alfredo, but needs some adjusting.

I don't normally keep cream in the house, so this was a great alternative.  Next time I will use minced garlic instead of garlic powder, and add a bit of parsley for colour.  Quick & easy, definitely worth trying again!

This was easy & awesome! I only had cream cheese with chives so used that and it sure didn't hurt anything.  Also added some fresh mushrooms that I sauteed first in a little butter and then added at the end. I used fat free 1/2 & 1/2 in an effort to cut calories. Alfredo isn't suppose to be terribly healthy!

We loved this!  I did only use 3/4 stick of butter and light cream cheese to help with the calories.  I added minced garlic instead of garlic powder and it was great.  We served it with frozen broccoli pieces (thawed), chix, and over ravioli....YUM!  So quick and easy to make.

After reading the reviews, I had some changes I wanted to try, but I decided to follow the recipe closely the first time to get an idea of how it's supposed to taste before I change it up.  This recipe makes a very delicious alfredo sauce that was a big hit with my husband.  The calorie content makes me cringe, though, so I'm going to try cutting the butter in half next time.  I'll also reduce the milk by about a half cup, since the sauce was a bit thin and required some extra cooking time to thicken.  I'd also like to experiment with other spices (oregano, italian seasoning, and nutmeg).  I will definitely make this sauce again.

After reading the reviews, I went with 4 oz parm cheese, added to the cream cheese step, and only 1 1/3 c milk.  The cream cheese was light, and the milk was skim.  Turned out delish!  Good with shrimp (served it tonight over linguine).

I joined this website--no joke--just so I could rate this, on behalf of all the people who have found this recipe and enjoyed it as much as my boyfriend and I did but were in too big of a hurry to join the site themselves.  So from all of us cooks-in-a-rush, thank you!

This was the best alfredo sauce I have ever had! I did substitute Heavy Cream for milk. I did 1 cup milk and 1 cup hevay cream and it came out fantastic! My whole family loved it and I would make it again anytime!

Yummy!  I didn't have any cream or half and half so I decided to give this sauce a try for our Shrimp Fettucini tonight.  It was delicious!  It definitely does not have a strong cream cheese flavor, which was my main worry.  My only complaint was that it was still a little 'chunky' even after melting together on low and slowly adding the ingredients (I did use 1/3 less fat cream cheese).  But the lumpy texture is not that noticable because your busy shoveling it into your mouth!  We topped the pasta, sauce and shrimp with diced tomatoes... great meal.

Honestly, I wasn't too sure about the cream cheese in this dish, but OMG it all worked sooo perfectly. I didn't change anything and did it exactly like the recipe said, and the whole time I was unsure until the end when I was pleasently suprized.

This recipe is awesome! Super easy and tastes amazing...I used non-fat milk and added a bit of basil to it and it came out great. I highly recommend this Alfredo recipe to everyone.

Absolutely amazing! I had used another recipe from this site with an equally high rating & it doesn't even compare with this one. I tripled the garlic, as I can't get enough. Also, I did what other reviewers had suggested and added some nutmeg. C'était si bon!

Very very good! My sister and I loved this recipe. I added a few things to make it even better. I cut up 2 small chicken breasts, I added a small container of fresh mushrooms and then used about half of a small onion in tiny pieces and fried it all together. Then while boiling the pasta I added some frozen broccoli florets to the water. It truly tasted like something from a fine restaurant. I had a lot left over so I put it all in a large bowl and in the fridge. I honestly didn't expect it to heat up well the next day but I microwaved it and it was just as good  as the night before. Very creamy and no milk needed.  Cant ask for a easier Alfredo sauce!

Pretty good. I've never been a huge Alfredo fan but I made this thinking my toddler might like it (I didn't find out: he refused to even try it. Sigh. He's SUCH a two year old.), and I ended up eating his meal for dinner tonight. I made it with less butter than the recipe called for, reduced fat milk, and I had unfortunately run out of milk earlier so I just used half and half I had in the fridge for the recipe. If I make this again I would definitely use our standard 1% milk, because this was really a very heavy and rich dish.

This recipe is INCREDIBLE!!!! I am a HUGE fan. WOW. The only thing I suggest is to maybe use 1/2 or 3/4 of the butter. This is definitely restaurant worthy; but whips up pretty quick. I also added a pinch of nutmeg, and didn't notice it. Day two: Refrigerates and reheats well on the stove. So-so in the microwave.  It made so much sauce that we were dipping out carrots in it just so it wouldn't go to waste (made a nice carrot dip too)! End: try the sauce. If you like alfredo you won't be disappointed.

i'm giving this 5 stars because my kids said it's the best meal they have had in a long time eventhough i made blackeye peas, sweet homemade cornbread, greens, smoked turkey tails homemade mac and cheese and sweet candied yams the day before yesterday and i know they love that stuff. i would give it 4 stars because i knew off the back that 8 ounces would be too much cream cheese so i only used 4oz and i still could taste it but it was good! i did use half and half and heavy cream but not the milk and about a half tsp of flour to ensure thickness because of other reviews complaints of the sauce being too thin. i also used some minced garlic along with the garlic powder and i used dried parsley for the color. i will make this again but with more changes because it's so fattening and you could still see the butter after it cooled down so i'll definatly will cut that in half. my son said did you use butter in it cause i can taste it and i used about a tbls less than the recipe called for. i never bought real parmesan so i used the stuff in the plastic bottle grated parmesan and it worked out well.  all in all it is a good recipe and i will be making this again soon.

Easy and Yummy! This was easily thrown together on a busy weeknight and everybody was very happy. As another review suggested i added the parmesean with the cream cheese before the milk and also added a heavy dash italian seasoning and a dash of nutmeg.  thanks for the great recipe

I would give this 5 stars in taste, but overall 4 stars for all the fat. So rich and fatty it gave me a slight tummy ache :o( If I make it again this way I will only use half the amount of butter and fat free cream cheese. I'm sure that will be plenty and hopefully won't change the flavor much.

I just finished this sauce and was somewhat disappointed at first based on all the great reviews. It was too thin (used 1% milk w/out thinking)  But I let the sauce sit andit thickend up.  Needless to say, I have "tasted" more than my share!  It is way to good!  I plan on using it in the Seafood Lasagna II recipe from this website and I may have to make more!  I will definitely be making it again and trying different variations! Thanks for a great recipe!

When I tasted the sauce as it was cooking I was really disappointed. It wasn't until I added it to my noodles that it tasted decent.  I couldn't taste the cream cheese and I felt I had to add a lot more parm for it to taste good.

Mmmm this was very simple, fast and easy to make. I used it with pre-made frozen pasta (5-cheese, 3 colored ravioli) and it tasted wonderful! It was gone as fast as I made it. I also love that I got to use up some of my many cream cheeses that I purchased over the Christmas holiday. I will make this again for next weeks supper.

I really liked this recipe. It doesn't taste exactly like an alfredo sauce made from a roue but it was very fast and still delicious! Instead of using garlic powder I used fresh garlic. I think that makes a big difference. I also added grilled chicken cut into strips and sliced mushrooms and my husband and I couldn't get enough of it!

Whoa - as many have indicated, this alfredo sauce is quick easy and incredible. I also used skim milk and light cream cheese - I did not cut the milk amount down (as others indicated) because I wanted to stretch out the calories/fat from the parmesean also, so I added a teaspoon of cornstarch to compensate for the watery-ness of the skim milk. It worked PERFECTLY. So delicious, so satisfying, just as good or better than the sauces you get at these gourmet restaurants.   The only reason this fell short of five stars, was because of my tweaking. I like my sauce high on flavor, so I cut up an onion, added 1 tbsp of minced garlic (instead of garlic powder), nutmeg, oregano, and some cajun seasoning. I also battered and baked some eggplant to put on top - which just made this dish perfection

I totally "healthied" it up and it was still pretty darn good! I used fat free cream cheese (I know they say not to cook with it but its what I had and it still worked pretty well), fat free half and half, margarine, pepper, garlic, and steamed broccoli. I didn't measure as well as I should have (and cut the recipe in half to feed just me and my boyfriend), so I may have used too much cream cheese in ratio to everything else. In the end, it was very cream cheesy tasting, but I won't complain cuz I love cream cheese :)

This sauce was fantastic!  I added a few slices of gargonzola cheese, the last of some Cougar Cheese that I had, and added the parm. It was wonderful. And I always have cream cheese in the fridge. I just added shrimp, onions, and sun dried tomatoes. Yum!

This sauce was a good recipe if you don't have alfredo sauce in your cupbaord; but I think I'll stick to the jared sauce. It was kinda bland for being so fattening. I would recommend using angel hair pasta, as the feticinni pasta is too thick for the sauce.

This is a good recipe!  I did make some changes based on what I had in the pantry.  I used 1 teaspoon garlic pepper instead of the garlic powder followed by black pepper.  I also thought that the parmesan does not blend as well as you would expect.  It turns out somewhat grainy, but it gives it a unique texture that is still good.  I will definately give it another shot though!

I am preggo so i luv anything pasta or pizza and have been a frequent goer of Olive garden here lately. LOVE LOVE this sauce except i used about 3/4 cup parm and 1/3 less fat cream chees and kept the evoo i sauteed my chicken in to melt the butter( not quite 1/2 C.)  And used 6 med garlic cloves instead of garlic powder( can you tell i love garlic? LOL!) would be a great pizza sauce too. Had everything in my pantry. Nice, Awesome, Delicious!

I really liked the recipe.  I'm trying to watch my calorie intake and fat so I used fat free cream cheese and low fat milk.  It was still really good.  I made shrimp alfredo pizza and then shrimp alfredo wraps the next day.  Both dishes were great.

I roughly used this recipe last night using two cloves of garlic and some tumeric for color.  Added it to sauteed broccoli and summer squash, then tossed the whole thing with some rotini.  It was pretty good!  Will definitely use this instead of the Alfredo in a jar.

I did not like this recipe.  I halved the recipe and followed the directions to a tee.  Sauce is too thin and not well seasoned.  I did add some nutmeg, salt and pepper.  Cooked sauce for a long time thinking it would thicken up but it didn't - the ingredients just started separating.  Think I'll just go back to my old tried and true alfredo which starts with a basic white sauce. Thanks anyway.

this was fairly easy and my family LOVED it.  We did cook chicken to add to it, but only for some as there are vegetarians in the family.  Also added grilled peppers and toasted raw peanuts.  We figured how many different ways you can use this recipe, it is endless.  Even the leftovers were great the next day!

Excellent! This sauce was delicious and the best part is; it's quick and easy! I added presh parsley which I think gave it a fantastic finishing touch. I pan seared cubed chicken in olive oil and added it to the sauce and pasta. This will definitely be one of my permanent recipes.

I thought this was great! It didn't taste like authentic Alfredo sauce (was cheesier, richer and creamier), but I think it might actually taste better! So easy, too!   I used almost twice the garlic (my husband and I love garlic) and just over half the milk- I added slowly until it was the perfect consistency. To make it healthier, I did use light butter, skim milk, and neufchatel cheese.

I have never tried to make alfredo sauce before and I am so glad that I used this recipe.  It turned out fabulous!  Not too thick, not too thin.  I followed the recipe on everything, then added a dash of nutmeg and a dash of oregano. Perfect.

Great recipe. This is my first time cooking/eating alfredo sauce and it was good. You could taste the cream cheese, but it didn't overpower anything. I had some leftover chicken in the fridge and decided to cut in into small pieces and  cook it with the sauce. I just poured it over my 'elbows'. Really good. Next time i'll try it with shrimp

This is a nice base.  I added red pepper flakes, chives, parsley, smoked paprika, garlic and onion.  Then mixed with noodles, mushrooms and broccoli.  4 stars for taste and 5 stars for simplicity!!

I was given a recipe very similar to this one, several years ago.  Mine doesn't add the garlic powder (which I will try next time!!); has only 1/2 cup milk; and calls for 1 cup of parmesan cheese (which I cut down to 3/4 cup).  I add parsley for some color.  I have made this with low fat and fat free cream cheese, and you can't tell the difference!!  We are just 2, and this makes a perfect amount for 8oz of pasta.  It is so good, that we never order alfredo at restaurants any more cuz it is NEVER as good. LOL

This is not only quick and easy, but very delicious. It got rave reviews from my family as well! For those who are wondering about how the cream cheese works with this recipe, you can't even detect that it is an ingredient, it adds a wonderful creaminess to the sauce though. I used half skim milk and half cream. Stir occasionally to prevent lumps from forming, sauce will thicken as it cooks and as it cools. Season to taste and you'll have the perfect alfredo sauce. Wonderful creation Sarah, thanks so much for sharing.

I absolutely loved this recipe! It was very easy and was a big hit with my hubby and my two year old twin boys who are picky eaters, to say the least. The only thing I will change up next time is to add a little more seasoning - definitely some salt and perhaps some italian seasoning to punch it up a bit. Overall, a great, easy sauce recipe that can be dolled up for lots of pasta dishes! Thanks for posting!!

This recipe is fabulous as is.  I've made it many times and have made it a little healthier by using light cream cheese, skim milk, and less butter.  Still fantastic...restaurant quality even.

This recipe is very easy! It's not really a traditional alfredo, but it's really tasty and very quick (plus I almost always have the ingredients on hand). The only change I made: reduced the garlic powder to 1 tsp (2 seemed like it would be a bit much). I will definitely make this again!

My family loves this recipe, we sometimes add leftover chicken (shredded) and it is so easy.

Way yummy and makes lots of sauce.  I used about 3/4 a (17.6 oz) bag of Garofalo radiatori (found at Costco here), 1 1/2 cups precooked chicken, Italian seasoning, and chopped mushrooms.  The amount was perfect.

I looked up a recipe for my sister to use for a dinner party and saw this great review. I helped her and her friend make the sauce and I had them use 1 cup 2 percent milk and 1 cup heavy cream to make it slightly creamier and thicker. I also had them use 3 small to medium cloves of garlic, pressed and sautéed. The sauce does have a cream cheese taste to it so if you don't like cream cheese this really isn't a sauce for you. The second time my sister tried to make it she made it by herself and supposably followed the recipe completely. It was very garlicy and did not even have the same texture.

This was exactly what I needed!  Something quick to make after work for the family and all the ingredients were random things I had left in my fridge; nothing truly expensive or exotic as some Alfredo cheese recipes may desire.  Threw it atop some angel hair pasta with some garlic butter chicken breasts.

This is absolutely delicious!  I will make this every time since I always seem to have the ingredients around.  Changes made were: I used only 7 T. of butter instead of 1/2 c.  I think you could even get away with only using 1/3 c. butter. Only used 1 1/3 c. milk. Used minced fresh garlic and sauteed in butter instead of the powder.  Added a few shavings of fresh nutmeg.  This was the easiest sauce I've made.  It makes quite a bit and the leftovers would be deicious over some cheese tortellini.  Enjoy!

This recipe is amazing!  It is so easy to make, and as someone else suggested, when you make it leftover, add a little milk and the flavor is still great.  I did add a dash of cumin to mine and the flavor was fantastic!!

Very tasty!!  My husband is a big Alfredo fan and he thought this was great.  I couldn't get it to thicken properly, but I'm not sure if it was something I did or did not do.  Still tasted great!

Sooo good! I mixed it up with the hot fettucine and my husband and I were alone tonight and had quite a bit leftover so I put it in a freezer bag and will boil it in the bag another night. I love that you can adjust the thickness as well with the addition of more milk.

This is great Easy way, as it says, to make alfredo. I found a tablespoon of prepared pesto added towards the end makes this extra special.

SO SO SO DELICIOUS!!! I made a few changes, but the original recipe is excellent, too. I added about half the butter, because mine turned out a little too oily with a whole stick. Also, I did minced garlic instead of garlic powder, and added slightly less milk because I like thicker sauces. Other than that, I went by the recipe. This is soooo delicious, a must for any cream sauce lover!

Used this recipe atop penne noodles for a baby shower...turned out fabulous!  I quadrupled it as I was serving it as a side dish to 35 people and everyone wanted to know what restaurant I ordered it from!!!  LOL  So, a big hit!  I altered it a little based on other reviews -- used a combo of skim milk and half & half, used light cream cheese, and added some oregano and basil for flavor!  Delicious!!!

Fantastic! I used minced garlic in place of powder, added a bit of salt and whisked away! The sauce thickened up quickly. I used about half parmesan from the bag, and half from the plastic jar. Alter the ingredients to taste, this sauce is foolproof. You couldn't even tell there was cream cheese in it. A very yummy, easy sauce. Nothing like the alfredo in the jar. I served this over gnocchi to rave reviews. I highly recommend this recipe!

Our family is allergic to cows milk so I used the soft goat chevre which is similar to cream cheese.  This worked great! I also added the nutmeg and oregano that was recommended by others which added to flavor.  I added a little cream sherry (1 tsp) since the goat cheese is not as sweet as cow's milk cream cheese.  Love the recipe. Thank you!

Super easy to make and very tasty. Works great with spinach, mushrooms, and sun dried tomatoes as well. I saute these separately and mix them in with the sauce.

The base to this recipe is wonderful! But, I changed it up a bit, like I always do haha probably why I am so fat! I basically used 2 stick of butter, 4 cups of heavy cream, 9 oz. of shredded parmesan cheese, 8 oz. cream cheese and a roasted garlic head. OH MY WAS IT GOOD! My family kept saying it was better than a restaurant.....MMM MMMM! We had this with the Chicken Cordon Bleu II from this site.

Quick? yes. easy? yes. delicious? definately!! :) I absolutely loved this one. Definately the best alfredo sauce i have ever had, even from a restaurant. I chose to serve this sauce with slow roasted vegetable ravioli, which went together beautifully. Thanks a tonne :)

I used minced garlic instead of garlic powder, and I also used roasted red pepper & garlic spice mix. It was wonderful and will be my go to recipe for alfredo sauce.

My keeper recipe for Alfredo Sauce! A little nutmeg in the sauce is a must! (I've used this recipe many times, but this latest time I added fresh minced chives.  The first of the season from my herb garden!)

So, i was in the midst of using another alfredo recipe when i remembered I had cream cheese I wanted to use before it expired. So, I decided to switch over to this one. This was fabulous! Nice and thick, something I usually struggle with achieving. I also used heavy cream instead of milk because I had already poured it, leaving me with a fabulous (albeit fattening) delight. Served over penne rigate and it was fabulous. Thanks!

The name of this says it all! The kids LOVED this and are asking me to make it again. My youngest daughter LOVES alfredo so I tried this recipe not knowing what to expect and it was sooooooo good! Definitely going to use this when I am short on time! Thank you for such a great recipe!

For a fast, easy recipe with on hand ingredients, this can't be beat. The cream cheese does give it a taste unusual to a traditional alfredo but not in a bad way. Everyone in the family loves it!

Yum!  I was looking for a fast Alfredo recipe, and this was fast and easy - and it had great flavor!  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was b/c the consistency of my sauce was clumpy rather than smooth - I don't know if I did something wrong, or what.... I did saute garlic with the butter, then I cooked as the recipe stated, adding Italian seasoning for some more flavor.  Husband and 2 young kids loved it as well!  Excellent with shrimp.

Very easy/foolproof recipe and it came out great (use good cheese if you can- it makes the sauce soo much better). Just keep whisking and it comes out perfect!  Makes alot... had w/a pound of penne w/grilled chicken, and there was leftover sauce.

I looked this recipe up at the last minute. It was a great base recipe. I did add other seasonings to create more flavor, but it was easy, quick, and I had everything to make it. Will use again, but with less butter or other substitute.

Thanks for the base recipe - always needed something like this as the store ones are so high in fat. Used skim milk and fat free cream cheese, and also cut the butter in half. It was just delicious, no one could tell it was the 'healthy' version!

This was pretty good. I don't think I'll make it too often simply because it isn't very healthy. Although I did cut the butter in half and use low fat cream cheese. I also only used about half of the milk, used minced garlic instead of powder, added a little chopped onion, and instead of just parmesan used an Italian cheese blend. Served over penne. Very creamy and rich. The husband liked it, which was enough to make me happy! **I updated this to a five instead of a four for one reason...the leftovers! Way better than the first day! I had it two days later and it was excellent!**

Wow, I just made this for dinner and it was wonderful! My husband was floored and said it was better than Olive Garden's! I for sure think it is a very close second! I can only imagine the fat content but oh my is it worth it! Print this out and save it forever more! I will never make another alfredo sauce :o)

Great and easy like it says! This is a great base sauce! I have now made this recipe several times and it always a hit.  I used low fat cream cheese and low fat milk. It was also great when we subbed some of the parmesan for asiago. I add thinly sliced red and yellow peppers and cherry tomatos sliced in half that I saute first. I saute the peppers and then when they are about done I add the tomatos for a minute and then add everything to the competed sauce and then let it simmer for a few mintutes or until everyone is ready to eat. I also add a dash of cajun seasoning to give it a little spice and a pinch of crushed red pepper or a little basil depending on how I want the sauce to taste. I have also added baby spinach, stir in and let it cook for a minute or until spinach begins to wilt and then serve. Yummy! It always turns out great. I serve it over bowtie pasta and it looks really pretty with the peppers and tomatos.

This was definitely very quick and very easy, and the taste was really good (creamy and cheesy.)  I halved the recipe and it still made plenty for two for dinner and two servings for lunches the next day.  I added a little more fresh ground pepper than called for, a little parsley, and a dash of nutmeg.  Family really enjoyed it.  I think it would still be as delicious with using only half the called for amount of butter.  The butter and cream cheese mixture did not come together immediately, but I kept whisking and adding the milk slowly and the texture came out perfectly (just be careful not to splatter hot butter on yourself!)  Will make again and again.

The taste was just okay, not breathtaking. I ended up having to add fresh minced garlic, parsley, white pepper, and a pinch of nutmeg to give it more flavor. It needed more parmesan cheese also. I found the texture to be thin and watery. Good base recipe, just needs a lot more tweaking.

Good beginner sauce. I like herbage in my sauces so I added a lot of extra Italian seasoning. I thought the recipe needed a little salt as well. I also upped the pepper. As I said, good base to add stuff to.

These are the changes I made to this recipe.  I use 1 tsp of minced garlic, and 1 cup of milk, and also lowered the amount of parmasean to 1/4 cup.  Any more than that made it too sweet.  All other ingredience stayed the same.  This an excellent recipe.

I'm Italian, and pride myself on knowing good Italian food. And this sauce seriously surprised me. I must have bypassed this recipe over a dozen times and tonight I had a really pregnancy craving for Alfredo. This hit the spot. :) You can't even taste the cream cheese. The only thing I did differently was scale the recipe down to two servings. That was still enough for my husband and me to have 2 bowls each.

We really loved it. I added just a bit of parsley too.  I put cooked chicken that I cut up into cubes in the alfredo sauce before I poured it over the noodles. I also added more garlic powder then it called for. I Will make again.

I had high hopes for this recipe, but it didn't reach them. This sauce was not exactly my cup of tea. When I was done making the sauce to the tee, it didn't taste all that amazing, so I added 1/4 tsp basil, and 1/4 cup mozzarella cheese to it, which seemed to make it more flavorful, and I liked how the mozzarella made it more cheesy. The sauce wasn't horrible, it's just not something I would probably make on a weekly, or even monthly basis. Maybe if I had the ingredients at hand, I would give it another shot.

Love love love this recipe!  Have made it a few times now, the most recent being yesterday.  Usually follow the recipe to the letter, but yesterday added clams and served over spaghetti squash.  This is rich and creamy without tasting of cream cheese.  I have to say unless you like your pasta swimming in sauce, this is way more than 4 servings, which is also just fine with me!  Fantastic sauce recipe...  thank you for sharing.

This is the best alfredo sauce I've ever had. Before I made it for the first time, The idea of Cream Cheese in alfredo sauce was questionable to me, but when I tried it, It was amazing! This is better than ANY store bought sauce I've tried. It's delicious! My boyfriend loved it so much he kept snacking on it after dinner. Not much leftover! It will be a staple in our house for sure.
I did use fresh chopped garlic instead of powder, but I'm a fresh herbs kinda girl, so I'm sure it's great either way.

This was a good reciepe.  I added more garlic powder, nutmeg, salt, onion powder, and white pepper.  I think that next time I make it I will not put as much parmesean cheese in it. overall it was a good starter reciepe that needed some tweeking.

This was very easy, but I thought it was just okay.  Mt son, who adores alfredo, liked it, and my husband who dislikes alfredo, liked it, so perhaps I was too critical.  I have about a cup left and I am going to try it as a sauce for pizza.  If that isn't delightful, I probably won't make this recipe again.

I made this for dinner a few nights ago. We thought it was just ok. We've definitely had better...BUT, it's definitely worth keeping and experimenting with..adding more flavor. I made with FF cream cheese and served on whole wheat fettuccini.

So good! Made this in less than 10 minutes. You have to be patient with it at first bc it looks like it's not going to work but then the milk completes it! I added like a cup and a half of parmesean ( couldn't figure it out in ounces) and added oregano, salt and pepper when done :) Love! love! love!

YUMMY!!! The recipe makes a basic alfredo sauce. Not too rich , like recipes using heavy whipping cream and butter, and not too runny/gross, like bottled alfredo sauce. Next time I'll add pesto. *UPDATE* Used this for Pesto Chicken Florentine and it tasted great.

Addictive. The first time I made this I made this as written and had to make myself stop eating. Usually I send any leftovers with my husband to work, but not this time. I enjoyed it the next day, too. Another time I used spinach/artichoke cream cheese and will do so again.

This was very good but VERY garlic-y (even for garlic lovers)...I would only use 1 tsp next time.  Along with the sauce, I sauteed up some chicken, sun-dried tomatoes, bacon and threw in some peas and served it over ravioli.  Husband gobbled it up.  Very easy to make!

I been looking for a good alternative for heavy whipping cream in sauces, and the cream cheese is great also lower in fat. I'm not one for just alfredo sauce, but this was a great base into other sauces. just by adding other extra little flavors. i added a little roasted pepper, sundried tomato, and aseago cheese. other flavors will help with the richness of the cream cheese.

This sauce is great and does not seperate when reheated. I have tried many many sauces to find this keeper. I only made half for 1 lb of pasta. I added some chopped fresh baby spinach (3 0z for half recipe) to the sauce after I removed it from the heat and topped the dish with a fresh chopped tomato! YUMMY. I will also use this for my cheese ravioli topped with steamed chopped butternut squash and toasted pine nuts.  nuts!

This turned out really good and my family loved it.  I used low fat/fat free ingredients and it was still really good. I also used fresh garlic instead of powder.

This was a good and quick sauce, but extremely rich... a bit too much for me.  I think next time I would use light cream cheese and margarine instead of butter.

This recipe is fantastic.  SO easy and SO delicious.  No need to alter a thing it is perfect.  I have used it on noodles, on pizza and even poured over sliced potatos (sort of like a scalloped potato).  Thanks for the easy recipe!!

I loved it, and so did everyone else in my family. My hubby has been begging me to make it again. He says it tastes just like the one from Olive Gardens. We had it to dip some breadsticks in. Awsome, didnt change a thing!

I was looking for something quick to make on a late soccer night.  This was perfect because I had the ingredients all on hand.   I tossed in some asparagus, green beans, peas, and chopped tomatoes and served over bow tie pasta.  I was able to use up all of my leftover vegetables and still give the kids a dinner they liked and that they weren't used to.  Thank you!

This is very good for how easy and quick it is...i threw some grilled chicken on top, next time i'll thin out the sauce just a tiny bit more, it chunks up after it sits for a few minutes. Very good though, fiance loved it!

This recipe was just ok for me. The sauce was very thick and I kept having to add milk to thin it out.  It thickened even more after I put it on the pasta. Maybe I did something wrong... I'll have to try again.

This was commercial-tasting. I mean, it was OK. But it tasted bland, like it was out of a jar. Not at all like real alfredo. I should have been tipped off by the cream cheese. Sorry, not a keeper.

This recipe is waaay too thick and heavy, I think it would be better off without the cream cheese and I thought that after tasting the sauce that you could actually taste the cream cheese which doesn't bode too well if not in the right recipe, I will stick with heavy cream and freshly grated cheese.

This is okay for a quick in a pinch recipe. It was a little on the bland side for my husband and I, my parents and children love it though. I may try it again later and throw in some nutmeg like so reviewers suggested.

A couple of observations - definitely use a good quality parmesan that you shred yourself as the Kraft type just doesn't melt correctly.  Also, I saute mushrooms and chicken breast (1" pieces) together and add it with the pasta when I toss to coat in the sauce.  Then add a bit of reserved shredded parm on top.  My family loves it and it is special enough for company.  Oh, I use fresh garlic instead of powder, I mince enough for a heaping tblsp, you can add to taste though.  Enjoy!

You can't go wrong with this and the more you make it you will change and add to it to make it your own. I like my sauce a little thicker than this comes out so go ahead...play around with it. You can't mess it up!

Super easy, just as good as any restaurant style and easy to modify. For a real treat, add a dash of nutmeg, 3/4 c. pumpkin puree and 1TB shopped fresh sage. Amazing! - I have made this for a LOT of people and every time, it's a hit.

What a surprise! I really enjoyed this recipe. At first glance, I thought it would not taste any good, never mind the texture! But desperate times called for desperate measures and I used this recipe! I will definitely be using it again.

Pretty good. Served over linguine with cut up portabella mushrooms and added some Italian seasoning into the mix. Came out a little less thick than I would have liked, but was delicious when reheated as leftovers.

My kids give it 4 stars, but my husband and I really enjoyed the rich taste. I thought it tasted like Olive Garden's alfredo sauce (hope that's ok that I mention them here). This recipe was easy and excellent. I thought it was a bit soupy so I added a couple teaspoons of flour, and I also added more parmesan and italian seasoning. I think it would be excellent with some grilled chicken. I will definitely be making this again!

This was really yummy and very easy to make. This is definately the recipe I will use for alfredo sauce! I like to chop up fresh parsley and mix it into parmesan cheese and sprinkle it on top before eating.

quick and delicious.  I halved the recipe and used it with a bag of tortellini pasta.  Next time I might add a bit more milk, it got a little thick towards the end of the meal.

I used this as pizza sauce and it was fantastic. The cream cheese really does make a difference for this sauce. LOVE IT!

I was wanting to make alfredo and this was the perfect EASY recipe. Make some vegys and chicken and you have a great dish! I also added some red pepper to give it alittle kick.

It doesn't thicken up on its own very well.  I usually sprinkle cornstarch in it until it thickens. The taste is very good.

I've never been a real fan of alfredo, but decided to make it to be nice to my husband.
I did follow many suggestions from other reviews and added fresh garlic and nutmeg. I also add mushrooms, shrimp, and chicken from the grill. 
This turned out fantastic, and I am now an afredo fan!!!
Thanks for the recipe.

Great sauce for when you are in a pinch for a quick meal using ingredients we normally have on hand. Not quite restaurant quality, but much better than the premade sauces! Not "cream cheesy" at all.

I wasn't too sure about this recipe but it came out great.  Tasted pretty close to restaurant-quality alfredo sauce. 
I put a touch of pepper and the tiniest bit of nutmeg on the top and I thought it helped bring out the flavor, but the sauce was great exactly as the recipe makes it.  Easy too!

I'm always looking for good, quick, and easy; in that order.  This was terrific!  I added a glove of minced garlic (might be too much for the faint of heart) with the butter/cream cheese mixture. Once complete, I added about 1/2 to 3/4 of a pound of shrimp that I had cooked and shelled, prior to making the alfredo.  My family loved it!  This is a keeper! I couldn't believe how simple it was! Any novice cook could definately impress her (or his) most particular guest!

This recipe is so easy and tastes so much like the real thing. Many times the 'real' alfredo sauce I make turns greasy. This was so creamy. I agree that no one would ever know it had a cream cheese base. I added a little nutmeg and it made it taste like any restaurant's alfredo sauce.

For something more healthy, this is a good recipe to overhaul.  I used skim milk, fat free cream cheese, low fat butter, and reduced fat grated parmesan cheese.  Quite yummy and you feel a little better about eating that extra helping.  :)

Very good.  Not exactly the same as really excellent alfredo sauce you'd get in a great Italian restaurant, but very close!  The cream cheese helps the sauce not separate.

I rated this recipe a 4.5 because there could have been more flavor to it. I added a bit of Italian herbs to it, and it seemed that it could have been a bit more salty. And, if you're eating for one, then scaling down the recipe to a serving size of one is more than enough for a plate of pasta. Good luck!

OMG!!! This is the best! I did put 1 lg.can of evaporated milk and the rest regular milk. All I had was colby & Montrey jack cheese so I used that. This is the first time I have ever made my own Alfredo sauce but this is a keeper, that will be used often! Hubby loved it too!

This was so yummy! My very picky daughter ate this up with no problem. The first time I made it I used shrimp..delicious! With the left-overs (which was quite a bit) I used turkey italian sausage. Double yummy! I even liked it & I do not like Italian Sausage, but with the sauce, it was so delicious! I can't say enough about this recipe! It is quick, yummy & makes a ton! Eat on!

Made this today with a few changes. I added 1tbsp of minced garlic and some garlic salt. Used  only 2 ozs of butter, 10 ozs of evaporated milk and about 2-3ozs of parmesan cheese.Like another reviewer I softened the cream cheese before using and slowly whisked everything together. This sauce came together very quickly, was smooth and just the right consistency. ***Delicious***

I have tried dozens of different alfredo recipes and this is hands down the best.  I was skeptical about getting a smooth sauce because that's always been my problem, but I followed the instructions exactly and it came out velvety smooth and didn't separate at all.  Next time I think I will try adding fresh garlic instead of the garlic powder for a more bold flavor, but I will definitely make this again!!

This was awesome!  We used the Kraft Parmesan cheese (in the green plastic container) since we didn't have real parmesan cheese, and it was still good.  It took awhile for the sauce to thicken, but it eventually did.  The whole family loved it.  We put teriyaki chicken in it and it was perfect!

i used 1 cup of half & half cream and 1 cup of skim milk powder, and added in spinach, and it was GREAT.  my 6&7 year old daughters loved it, my 10 year old son said it rated a 4, my husband said it was very rich (which he meant as a good thing but i think that had to do with the cream). VERY EASY, very tasty, this one is definitely a keeper.

UNREAL how good this was!!!  I followed another person's suggestion and brought the cream cheese to room temp.  Instead of garlic powder, i used minced garlic, only because i didn't have powder, and it seemed to make sense.  
Really, a PERFECT sauce!

I loved how easy this was.  I thought it was a little thin at first but it worked quite well.  I tried something totally new.  I had sesame linguine and some spinach asago chicken sausage that I had to get rid of.  I also saltade asparagus and chopped in small pieces.  I did not mix just placed together after. Cocoction was a hit in my house everyone loved.  Added Salt and pepper fresh Garlic a few sprigs of curled & italian parsley as well as shreaded Aged Parm Cheese.  Will try a touch of Asago next time.

I have a different recipe for alfredo, but couldn't find it.  This was the closest that I could come to mine....this was MUCH better!  Mine always seemed too greasy (butter) and never mixed into a smooth mixture.  I will use this again and again from now on!!!
I didn't have any garlic powder on hand, so I used 1 1/4 teaspoons of garlic salt.  I thought that it was just the right amount of salt.  I only used 2 Tablespoons of butter, also.  This was a very smooth and creamy mixture.

Wonderfully flavored sauce.  Changes I made, I kept adding cheese until I was satisfied with the texture and taste.  6 oz just seemed to thin and milky still.  In addition I added a mix of Parmesan an pecorino cheeses.

This was delicious!  It's the best Alfredo recipe I've found yet.  I did find that you need to add extra salt for good flavor...

This was an *insanely* delicious base sauce.  I added a preliminary step by sauteing: onions, crimini mushrooms & garlic (seasoned with salt & pepper)and then, I made the sauce mixed with that.  I also took the advice of reviewers & added nutmeg & fresh parsley.  I lighten up the recipe & used 1/3 fat cream cheese, smart butter & added 2% milk slowly to control the consistency - it was plenty rich & creamy.  I put it over penne & brocc also mix it up with some leftover salmon.

Wonderful recipe! Everyone loved it. Although, I didn't put 6 oz of Parmesan cheese. I used 3 oz of Parmesan and 3 oz of Romano.

I found this recipe to be right on the money.  It was an absolute breeze to prepare, and the taste and texture were perfect.  I added two cans of chunk light tuna, in order to make a tuna alfredo for my 4 through 13 year old children.  They all loved it.  Next I will add some chopped ham instead of tuna, and ladel it over some sausage filled tortellini.

Truly FANTASTIC! I made it just as described the first time and it was wonderful. The next two times I used this recipe as a base and did some variations. The one last night was awesome so I have to share. So simple- only two added ingredients. Lemon and chives to your personal taste. YUMMM! Couldn't have been as great without this great starter!

Anyway, was in a bind for alfredo sauce to go with my easy sausage, pasta and veggie skillet dish. this was a lifesaver... I had all the ingredients and it was CAKE!  It does look very "wrong" before you put in the milk. Also, used the shredded parmesian vs. the grated and it never blended fully, or melted, but it served the purpose beautifully and was so easy. Next time I will cut back on buttah since it was puddling in the sauce. Thanks so much for such a find!!

This recipe is so easy and tastes awesome!!  Just be prepared that it is very rich so if you aren't a huge fan of alfredo this may not be the recipe for you.  I had grilled some chicken (flavored with garlic) and added it to the pasta.  Delicious!!

Oh my gracious! This was the most unbelievable recipe that I have ever used for homemade Alfredo Sauce!  In my opinion it is very close in flavor to Olive Gardens.  It was so easy to make.  I use shredded parmesan cheese instead of grated.  It was a little lumpy at first, but melted nicely.  It does thinken after it sits, but we re-heated it the next day and I added a little milk and it revived it totally!  I also use one cup half n half and one cup milk instead on 2 cups milk.  I will never use store bought alfredo sauce again.

I loved it! The only thing that threw me off was I tasted the sauce before I mixed with pasta and felt that it was way too salty, but once mixed, it was perfect.  D-E-L-I-C-I-O-U-S!

Wonderful! It was a little bland, so I added extra... well... everything, plus a little salt. Served with some gluten-free spaghetti... Mmm! This is the kind of thing  I've felt like I was missing out of since I  cut out the gluten.

This was absolutely wonderful!  I cooked dinner for 2 more people than normal and I usually just buy the Knorr Alfredo Sauce packet and spice it up myself...well - with all the extra pasta 2 packets just wasn't enough.  I didn't have the cream called for in most recipes, but plenty of cream cheese - your sauce was wonderful, more tasty, and simple.  AND it saved my dinner!  The only alteration was instead of the garlic powder which I didn't have, I used Johnnys Garlic Spread & Seasoning (Made by the Johnnys Seasoning people)  I was a bit worried at first, but it's fantastic!  Definately a keeper!

i found that this sauce was a little runny, i had to add a flour/water mixture to thicken it up, but other than that it was a wonderful sauce and easy to make as i typically have all of those ingredients on hand.

I absolutely love this recipe!! I've made this several times. I always use half and half and start with 1 cup and add until I get the consistancy I want. I usually make this when I have leftover chicken to use or I saute up some mushrooms. It's a recipe you must try!!

This had a funny flavor that we just didn't care for.  It was edible, but we won't be making it again.

The use of cream cheese with butter and milk has been a tried and true recipe in my family for years and everyone has always raved about the creaminess and flavor of the Alfredo Sauce... Easier than the "standard" Alfredo  recipe and the cream cheese makes it creamier than standard recipes.  This is definitely a "winner" recipe in family's book!

I didn't know that it was so easy to make Alfredo sauce from scratch.  This was delicious.  I was a little nervous about the texture - but it really worked itself out.  The only thing that I added was a few sprinkles of Garlic Salt.  I poured this over a bed of Egg noodles and served a baked Garlic Parmesan Chicken breast over it.  Superb...!

Wonderful and very rich sauce, I made this for my boyfriend and his parents and they loved it. Most alfredo sauces are solely based on the butter but this one is actually based on the cheese, which makes it even more delicious.

We loved it although I did change it just a bit by adding the Kroger version of Mrs. Dash to it.  I used it in a ham/alfredo pizza recipe. Really tasty for a different type of pizza using left over holiday ham.

Make the sauce rather thick by adding extra parmesan cheese.
Spread on pizza crust (adding your favorite spices to your specific tastes may be advisable)
cut-up ham 
chopped green and red pepper
chopped red onion
mushrooms (which ever type is your fav.  we like portabella and cremini)
top with mozzarella and or your fav. pizza cheese.  ( I would like to try it with Asiago cheese, but have not yet.  Bet it would be tasty.)
Cook according to your pizza crust package directions with a possible few extra minutes pending on how high your pizza is from all the yummy ingrediants.
I'm thinking about adding some banana peppers or green olives on my next pizza. Maybe even some spinache would be good.

I have used fat-free cream cheese and skim milk to cut-down on fat and calories.

Cut original sauce recipe in half to accomodate one 12" pizza.  Hope all else try and enjoy this recipe as we do!

This is a huge hit at my house!  I make it as the recipe says except I add a couple dashes of nutmeg and a little more black pepper.  I serve it over fettuccine, chopped broccoli, and chopped grilled chicken... this is one of my husband's favorite recipes.

Pretty good for something so easy. I doubled for a seafood lasagna recipe and used one block of cream cheese and one block of neufchatel and it had a weird wang to it. I added half a packet of Splenda and salt and it seemed to minimize it. My husband went wild about it, though.

I've been making this for a year or so now and I just located it on this site.  A few changes I have are, I sate onions, green peppers, and garlic in the butter before adding the cream cheese.  Everything else is pretty much the same, and it's always a big hit.  Thanks for posting it

This recipe is great, and so simple to make. The quality and taste is maybe even better than what you would expect to find in a good Italian restaurant. It is very rich and full of flavor, and we used light cream cheese and skim milk to lighten up the fat and calories. You can add whatever you like- parsley, basil, shrimp, chicken- so many possibilities! Thanks for this great recipe.

This was very easy to make, although I think the next time I'll use less butter. Also, if you use skim milk, you don't need to use the full amount--it made it a bit soupy.

Perfect, perfect, perfect.  I converted the recipe to fit 150 people for a church dinner. It was wonderful!!!. Everyone was wanting the recipe - even children. One change was using one-half milk and one-half chicken stock and adding steamed chicken.

This is a really good sauce. I don't like Alfredo sauce, and dairy makes me ill, so if I'm going to eat it, it HAS to be worth it.  My husband is a HUGE Alfredo-lover and he said this was better than 'real' Alfredo sauce!

This is the best Alfredo sauce ever!! I cut the recipe in half (for two) and used half and half instead of milk. Served it with Penne that I added some broccoli and chicken to and it was delish!! The ultamate comfort food.

I made this tonight and it was so easy and good.  I used two cloves of garlic because I did not have the powder, and because I had just a tub of cream cheese (16oz) I eye-balled half of that for the requisite 8oz.  I also had no idea how much 6oz of parmesan looked like - so I just grated it over the sauce and guessed.  It was awesome.  My husband - who is used to plain old spaghetti or mac and cheese (b/c of kids) was so thrilled that I actually cooked - AND I added scallops which were frozen in the bag.  I sauteed them first before adding to sauce.  I guess I could have cooked them in the sauce but I am so scared of raw everything!!!  Anyway - I loved it.  My husband was thrilled.  The kids didn't eat it - but they never eat dinner so who cares!!  Thanks!

I made this tonight with some small changes: used Neufchatel (the 1/3 less fat cream cheese), half whole + half 1% milk, and garlic salt instead of garlic powder.  I added some cajun smoked salmon with spinach fettucine.  A little bit of fresh grated parmesan on top with a side salad made a complete meal.  My husband is VERY picky about his cream sauces, and he LOVED this one!  We will be making this regularly!

I thought this was a little too cream cheesy and not enough salt. I did use half cream and half milk and real garlic instead of the powder. I may make this again in a pinch but I'll probably try something else.

Fantastic! I followed other reviews and used 1/2 milk and 1/2 cream, added both parmesan and romano cheeses and also used fresh garlic instead of powder. I added chicken and mushrooms as well. Yum yum yum. I think next time I will try using just milk as the sauce was just a little too rich, but still a fantastic addition to my recipe box! Thanks.

This recipe is wonderful,I served it and everyone who had it had seconds and thought it was real athentic. i didnt have very much parmesan, so i used only about a fourth of what was required and put shredded mozzarella for what else was needed, it was great, but it definitly did not have the same texture the next day, even though the taste was the same.

I have never been able to master the alfredo sauce just perfect.  This time I did.  It was SO easy to make.  I did do as others suggested and used 1 C milk and 1 C cream.  I also used minced garlic instead of powder and I sliced a couple cloves for added flavor.  It turned out great.

I tried this for the first time last nite.  It is quick to make and turns out yummy and very rich.  My boyfriend is a pastaholic and he loved it.  The next time, however, I will used a little less butter and a little less parmesan cheese.  I used about 1 cup of heavy whipping cream and 1 cup of milk instead of what the recipe called for and added salad shrimp, some canned crab meat with a couple of pinches of chili pepper for bite and 2 cloves of garlic in lieu of the garlic powder.  Even with my changes, it turned out splendidly.  This one is a keeper.

This was a very simple recipe that turned out great!  I loved the idea of using cream cheese.  I made this sauce to go on a pizza, and it was a little runny... I might hold back on the milk next time to give it a little thicker consistency.  The taste was great!  I added 1/8 tsp of white pepper along with the black which gave it a little extra punch.  I will definitely be using this recipe again in the future.

This was pretty easy and quick to make.  I used real butter, cream cheese, and fresh minced garlic.  I also used shaved parmesan, shredded romano and mozzerella, along w/ 2% milk.  I sauteed onions, bacon and pea to top.  (like a carbonara).  Came out rich, thick, and creamy... though next time I'll leave out the romano and add asiago for the taste I prefer.

Thoroughly enjoyed this sauce!  Exactly like the title "Quick and Easy", but remember to add "Delicious".  I added sauteed halibut to make a wonderful Halibut Fettuccine. Yuuummmm!

The consistency of this sauce was great, but the flavor was only okay.  I could definitely taste the cream cheese which gave the alfredo somewhat of a sour flavor.  Also, the garlic powder was overwhelming and the recipe needs salt.

What a great recipe! I even cheated- didn't want to run to the grocery store for real butter & fresh parmesan, so I used margarine and grated parmesan- just added it really slowly. Also added 1/2 & 1/2 milk and heavy cream.

This is a really easy and great recipe. It is freezing right now in Chicago and to cold for me to walk to the store with my son, however I have nothing in my fridge. I didn't even put butter in this because I was out and it still tasted great. I actually cubed the cream cheese and cut the recipe in half since it was for one person and just stirred in the milk to taste. I will totally use this recipe again since it is always so hard to find good recipes that are easy and include cream cheese! Thanks!!

I loved the ease in making this recipe, and how creative it is. The only thing I didn't like is how the sauce basically solidifies as soon as it cools. When it's hot it's an amazingly creamy and delicious sauce. Next time I will try using fresh grated parmesan cheese from a brick because I used powdered cheese, which didn't melt that well into the cream cheese mixture.

Absolutely the best yet! It was a bit tedious whisking the creme cheese, but worth every minute. I added 1# steamed shrimp for a seafood sauce. It was a hit. I will definitely be making this again, soon.

Very quick and easy.  There is no need to make a rue with this recipe--so it really can't be messed up. To make it more interesting I added sauteed frozen green vegetables, basil, and crushed garlic. I used whipped cream cheese, because it was all I had on hand, and it turned out great.

This sauce can be thickened with a little extra cheese and spinach and turned into a dip.

Since I first  made this sauce, I have shared it with so many people who just love it. It is easy. It is not cheap or healthy, but it is good. And if you happen to have leftovers, it warms well in the microwave. I always make a double batch just so we can have a bit left. Even my picky eater loves it. He will grill chicken to go with it.

Out of this world.  A secret to this is saute some uncooked shrimp in the butter and garlic first, reserve the shrimp then add once sauce is complete.  Also add a bit of cajan spice to kick it up.  for those that had issues with it not thickening, just use a TBLS of Corn starch and some cold milk and make a slurry then add to sauce once boiling. works perfect.

So good. Takes literally minutes to make and is wonderful over pasta. The cream cheese gives it a very creamy taste. It is different than the traditional alfredo ordered at restaurants, but in a good way. It just depends on what kind of alfredo you are in the mood for. But if you want it smooth and velvety -try this.

I greatly enjoyed eating this, however it didn't thicken as quickly as I hoped.  I also didn't particularly care for the garlic powder.  Next time I will most likely use fresh garlic.

I don't like alfredo sauces, but I love, love ,love this recipe! I use cracked garlic pepper and add a little of the romano and asiago as well. Whats great about this recipe is that its a good base and it also freezes really well for later use.

This is a very good quick alfredo sauce for a quick dinner.  I only used half the amount of garlic powder (it was plenty of garlic kick for us) and added some chicken.  My kids really enjoyed it too.  I served it with cooked veggies and broiled sourdough topped with fresh parmesan and parsley.

Oh....my....goodness!!!  This was fabulous!  I increased the parmesan to 8 ounces and added two dashes of nutmeg.  It's equally sinful as it is delicious.  I'd make this again and again and again.  Thanks so much for a hit recipe!
P.S. I whisked the sauce the entire time I prepared it and had no separation issues that other reviewers had.  Enjoy!

This sauce is creamy and delicious. I added sun dried tomatoes, crimini mushrooms and parsley to my sauce, which worked nicely and was a nice change from the usual alfredo. I served this at a dinner party and it was a big hit. I gave it four stars because the serving size seems way off - I doubled the recipe because I was serving so many people, but I easily could have stuck with the original 4 servings and had plenty. I will make this again.

Absolutely delicious...the cream cheese makes a world of difference.  This sauce can be refrigerated and is just as good the next day.  It does not separate.  This is the only alfredo recipe I use.  I will say that I use a little less parmesan than called for and it comes out perfect. I am forever grateful!!

I will NEVER go back to canned alfredo sauces EVER again. This recipe is too tasty and too simple to pass up! Wonderful! Must try.

I like to use lots of the 3 cheese blends (asiago, parmesean, and romano), rather than just parmesean. It gives it a little more punch. Also fun to add in a touch of white wine.

The only thing I did to this was add a touch more garlic and some parsley, for my taste.  I added the milk slowly and didn't have to use 2 cups.  I used Parmesan, Romano, & Asiago mix of cheeses.  This is really easy and really good!

SUPER EASY!  I used vegetable garden flavored cream cheese and it came out great!  I also realized after melting the cream cheese that I had no milk in the house, so I made up powdered milk.  I wouldn't suggest that route if you have real milk, but it's pretty darn good anyway!

We love this recipe! I've been looking for a good & easy alfredo sauce for over a year. I've tried several from this site, all good. But this one won our vote. 
I add a pinch of nutmeg, use a garlic clove & fresh grated parm.

What a great (and quick) way to prepare a rich and cheesy sauce! This is my staple alfredo recipe from here on in, wouldn't change a thing.. just tweak the amount of milk to keep it creamy. doesn't keep well, but what a hit!

The name of this recipe should be Quick, Easy and Fantastic Alfredo Sauce. My husband even claims it tastes better the second day. I have not used any other recipes for alfredo sauce since finding this one.

Yep, quick, easy & good. The only thing I did different was add 1/4 tsp. nutmeg. All alfredo should have nutmeg!

Pretty good.  I followed the recipe exactly and the sauce was still a little lumpy and lacking a little in flavor.

I loved this sauce.  The easiest alfredo I have every tried.  Mine usually seperates and I end up throwing it out but this is creamy and rich.  We used it for days with different dishes.

This recipe was great.  I added some fresh parsley, spinach, and some pork sausage seasoned with italian seasonings.  I also added 1 Tbsp of cornstarch to help thicken it.  Definitely a keeper.

This recipe was incredible, and we used all lactose-free substitutes (margarine, lactose-free milk, soy cream cheese and parmesean). It made a ton of sauce, so we used it on different things for a week!

Great recipe! I added in steamed broccoli and served this with cheese tortellini. The butter kept separating, though. It felt pretty heavy on the butter; next time I think I'll try olive oil instead. Also, when I made this, I used whipped cream cheese--so that might explain some of the separating. Next time, I'll probably also use light cream cheese. The sauce was pretty thin; I'll try some of the other reviewer's suggestions of lessening the milk to 1 or 1 1/2 cups (I used skim milk). Oh, and it reheats well!

This sauce tasted wonderful!  Mine was a little grainy, but that's because I used that dry parmesan in the plastic can, next time I will use freshly grated.

I love this recipe. I use half and half and minced garlic instead of garlic powder. I use this sauce for so many recipes. But it is great with manicotti stuffed with minced chicken, broccoli and ricotta and baked with mozzerella on top. No more jar sauce!

I use this recipe when I make cheese tortellini and everyone absolutely LOVES it!  My favorite alfredo sauce by far!  I usually don't use quite as much milk though (I half it down to 1 cup or just a little over), just because I like my sauce a little thicker.

Excellent! I no longer have to go to Olive Garden to get Alfredo sauce. So easy and so delicious! Thank you so much! The flavor is even better for leftovers which is great for my family. Use a silicone or nylon whisk though, so you don't scratch your nonstick pans. I used silicone and it did fine. I did use more parmesan. (about 2oz. more) I also served it with sprinkles of fresh parsley. I will try less milk next time to make it a little thicker. I used 2% milk and it tasted fine. I cannot wait to have it again.

AWESOME...i just made this and am eating it as i type...one of the traits of a classic recipe is this: SIMPLICITY,TASTE,TEXTURE,VERSATILITY. No more jar alfredo when you can get THIS VELVETY SMOOTH CLASSIC TASTE. Cream cheese-- never would have guessed it.  It's probably awesome with any meat you put w/ it-- i'm eating it with pasta!  I'll try with shrimp next!

Super Easy and good flavor!  I upped the amount of garlic powder and the cheese and only used maybe a cup and a half of milk, but it was very good!!!  I sauteed chicken breasts and mushrooms in some butter and olive oil along with garlic powder, salt and pepper and then mixed it in the alfredo sauce...excellent quick meal!!!  Great the next day, too!

I have made this two times.  The first time I poured it over ravioli, the second we mixed in grilled salmon and shrimp.  My family really liked the ravioli, but the seafood was just to die for!  This recipe also reheats much nicer than a traditional alfredo.  Will make again, and again!

This was excellent.  I used fat free half and half and fat free cream cheese and it came out delicious.  I also substitued the garlic powder for fresh garlic, and sauteed it in the butter for a few minutes before adding the other ingredients. Very creamy and delicious.

My oldest daughter loves Alfredo sauce and she loved this home-made sauce.  My family gobbled it up.  My hubby liked it but thought it was a bit too heavy in taste, so I think I may cut some of the cream cheese next time to lighten it up - other than that, loved it.

VERY Tasty!!!! However, mine turned out awfully loose.  Perhaps it was because I used a lower grade cheese (it didn't melt well at all), and possibly too much milk.  The boys gobbled it up like mad, so I will make this again, only tink with it to suit my aesthetic needs.

To be honest, just reading the ingredients I was a little unsure of this recipe, but I thought I would give it a try since it seemed so simple.  Im glad I decided to! Im not a fan of alfredo in general, the dh is, but boy am I a fan of this! Its fantastic! You can't even taste the cream cheese! Its SUPER! I did make a few changes.  I sauteed garlic and mushrooms with a bit of olive oil, salt and black pepper. Then I cooked chicken breasts sliced into strips.  I removed the chicken and mushrooms but left the liquid from cooking in the pan.  I made the sauce as the recipe calls for, only I used homogenized milk, added some more black pepper and garlic salt.  I also think the next time I make this, and I will definitely be making it again, I will add roasted red peppers! Mmmm... WONDERFUL!

Absolutely delicious, fast and super easy.
I did add a teaspoon of parsley for that little dash of color.

Neither I nor my boyfriend cared for this sauce. It was too rich for our tastes. My search continues for the perfect alfredo sauce.

AWESOME! I registered a user name on this site just so I could leave a righteous review for this sauce!

This is the best Alfredo sauce that I've ever made in my life! It's sharp, creamy and any pasta holds it extremely well. My fiancé keeps asking me to make it again.

KUDOS!!!!!

Not sure why, but my sauce never came together, butter and cream were completely seperate. Didn't bother to serve, opened a jar instead! I was really looking forward to it too...Maybe it was me??

This recipe was delicious!! I served it with spaghetti and grilled chicken and I was very pleased. After reading reviews, I used 1 tsp of garlic powder and regular cream cheese and it was perfect. No more store bought alfredo sauce for me! Thanks for the great recipe.

I thought this was wonderful! I used lower fat versions of the ingredients and turned out delicious. I used this sauce over cut up grilled chicken, cheese tortelini, and sauteed mushrooms. Toast up some garlic bread and you have such a decadent meal. Yumm!

I really love this sauce. My older son doesn't like tomato sauce on pasta, so I've looked for recipes for alfredo. It is fantastic as written, but I have added fresh herbs, mushrooms, italian sausage at different times; all to great results. Thanks for the recipe. A definite keeper for me.

I used light cream cheese and I didnt have that tangy "too-cream-cheesy" taste that others mentioned. Its a good idea to add the cream cheese gradually and taste as you go along just to make sure you dont put in too much for your tates

As a beginner in cooking I am often skeptical of recipes that say "its so easy" or "its so quick" because it rarely is. I made this last night and it really was very quick, very easy and very good. Will keep this recipe for the future.

It was nice to make a sauce instead of heating it from a jar. Unfortunately, I left it out to sit for too long (20 minutes on LOW) and it thickened. I put in milk to thin it out and kept stirring until all the food was ready, but it was still too thick.

I am the kitchen manager at a club where I live at and can basically make any special I want.  I used this alfredo recipe for a friday night special and got rave reviews from everyone that had it. I used it with steamed broccoli, mushrooms and chicken. It was a smashing success.  Thanks!

I quartered this recipe and simmered it down to a thick sauce and made spinach alfredo pizza.  It was excellent.  I didn't know making alfredo sauce from scratch could be so easy.

Quick & Easy!!! That's a plus with a 3yr old! This was really easy and really good.After reading some of the other reviews I only used a little garlic powder. Poured this over my noodles and broccoli. Delicious! Will make again!

Sorry, guess I'll have to stick to my "regular" alfredo sauce.  I followed the directions to the T and it never came together, just stayed a separated mess.  With the addition of the milk, it came together a little, enough so that I could at least use it and not toss it, but it was never smooooooth and creamy like alfredo should be.  Thanks anyway, it was worth a shot.

Wow!  This is the real thing!  I sauteed fresh garlic in the butter first and used evaporated milk instead of milk (didn't need the extra richness, milk would have been just fine) and put this on a chicken alfredo pizza.  Was easy to thicken up to a thicker consistency for the pizza and the cream cheese wasn't detectable at all.  Definately keeping this on hand, thank you!

This sauce is very good!  However, it can be a bit overpowering if you like to drench you noodles, just be sure to have bread/rolls as well.  Either way, I would call it a keeper!

This is the best alfredo sauce I've ever tasted but since I just joined Weight Watchers, I'll have to find a lighter alternative as the points on these equal two days worth of meals.

I was in a pinch one evening and needed a quick recipe for alfredo sce, using things I had on hand.  This is the most delicious alfredo sauce I've ever eaten.  I make it in batches and keep it in jars in the fridge to have on hand during the week.  We use it as dipping sauce for garlic bread, too.  It's so much better than anything you would find in a restaurant.  The only change I made was I used less garlic powder than called for.  It's fantastic w/the 2tbs, but my husband isn't a huge fan of that much garlic.  THANK YOU for this easy recipe!!!

Great! I multiplied this recipe by 6 and it wasn't as thick as I thought it would be. The flavor was great. I think that I'll try low-fat cream cheese next time, too, just so I don't feel so guilty.

best alfredo sauce, ever. I have tried to find a recipe similar to the Chicken fettucini alfredo at the Chees Cake Factory and this is actually better. Even my very picky husband and three year old loved it.

I really like this recipe and so do my kids and they are not easy to please. The only change I made was adding fresh crushed garlic instead of powder. I will never buy the premade alfredo sauce again.
Thanks for sharing.

My husband and I LOVED this!  The only slight problem I had was that I couldn't get it as thick as I wanted after simmering quite a while (maybe because I used reduced fat cream cheese?) so I added a couple of teaspoons of cornstarch--turned out perfect! I served it over cheese tortellini--YUM!  I will be adding this to the rotation!  Thanks, Dawn!

Easy to make. Milk is less expensive than heavy cream which most recipes call for. I used fresh garlic. I like that it does not separate when reheated. Use room temperature cream cheese and a whisk for a smooth texture.

Very good. Better than any of my favorite restaraunts. Can't wait to try an alfredo pizza with it!  Warmed well in the microwave. Just a few seconds is all it needs so that it won't separate.

Great alfredo sauce!  I too had the cream cheese get clumpy, but when i added the milk it mixed in fine.  I served this for company (I used the pesto chicken florentine recipe from this site) and everyone loved it!

This was the best alfredo sauce I ever had. I made it with shrimp, carrots, and snow peas. I used fresh garlic, asiago cheese (didn't have parmesan) and half and half. Put some scallions on top. My husband is still raving about it.

This sauce is easy and excellent!  I don't know what can be said about it that isn't already said...except maybe that if you like to have extra sauce for your garlic bread (like we do), double the batch!  Or double it anyway...it's that good!  My mom is an alfredo junkie and I thought she was going to throw all table manners out the window and lick her plate clean!  It really is THAT good!

I am a pasta lover and tend to rely on restaurants for alfredo becuase I have never found a recipe that I liked at home.  This recipe is probably the best alfredo sauce I have had anywhere and is now posted on the inside of my recipe cabinet so that I will alwasy know where it is.  Even my husband (the non-pasta lover) enjoyed this sauce!

This alfredo sauce is excellent. Using 2 garlic cloves instead of garlic powder was a great suggestion. I made the alfredo with shrimp and it tasted sooooo yummy!

I used fresh pressed garlic (and lots of it), garlic seasoned grilled chicken and spinach.  It added that extra flavour that sends it over the top. I also use low fat cream cheese, half the butter and 1% milk to cut down the fat content.
It is nearly impossible to get the cream cheese smooth before adding the milk,  but it will still turn out very smooth once the milk is added. We make a doulbe batch and freeze the sauce into dinner size portions, it tastes even better after all the flavours have had time to blend.

My husband said over and over what a good recipe this is.  Thank you!  I did add mushrooms and chicken and I didn't have any milk in the house so I used half and half.  I also added old bay's seasoning (yum, my fav seasoning)because I didn't have any garlic powder.  It was really good! My 14 month old baby loved it too.

Made this a few times with great results. Changed things a bit by melting butter and stirring in minced garlic and shallots, cooked 1-2 min then added frozen shrimp, cooked 2 min and removed shrimp. Made just like recipe called except grated a little nutmeg in. Cooked pasta, added shrimp to sauce then mixed with pasta. Salad, garlic bread, great. Hubby and father-in-law kept saying "good stuff". Quick and easy meal.

I tried this with provolone and it was amazing! Thanks for the tip of the cream cheese, the light stuff I had in my fridge kicked ! I also did a variation using sambal for a bit of a jalepeno kick.

This recipe was fantastic!  We used low fat cream cheese and skim milk for a low fat version and added a little more black pepper.  We cooked it with tortellini, proscuitto ham, and peas.  Great!

I don't really like Alfredo Sauce, but I thought I would surprise my husband because he loves it.  Well, we both really liked this. I made it with low fat creamcheese and skim milk and it turned out great.  I even served the leftovers the next night over steamed brocolli. Yum!

This is THE BEST alfredo sauce ever!  I used 2 fresh garlic cloves in place of the powder, and it still turned out terrific.  The thickness can be adjusted relatively simply.....we like our alfredo sauce a bit on the thick side so I only added 1 cup of milk- but if you like it thinner, definately add at least 1 & 1/2 cups milk.  Thanks so much for sharing this recipe! :)

Truly a quick and easy alfredo that tastes shockingly like the stuff you get at the Olive Garden.  I managed to pass it off on my family (the two pickiest eaters in the world) and they actually got mad when there wasn't any more!

It also works well as the base for other creamy sauces, and tastes fantastic with chopped mushrooms and/or roasted red peppers.

This recipe is absolutely wonderful! I used fat free cream chees, 2% milk, and low fat parmesean. I also added crawfish tails, shrimp, and crab meat (not imitation). I cut back on the milk some as I didn't want it too runny. This recipe is definately a keeper at my house! Thanks for sharing.

By far, Hands Down this is the creamiest alfredo sauce i've had.  Much, much better than anything out of a jar.

This alfredo sauce was the best I ever made! I changed it to 2 servings instead of 4, since I only cook for me and my boyfriend. I served it with grilled chicken breasts and mushrooms over bowties. It was amazing, great texture and flavor - it reminds me of a popular restaurant alfredo sauce that I love. :)

I am very much a beginner at cooking and this was easy enough for me to follow! I made it for Valentine's Day with some sauteed shrimp and it was fantastic. Creamy and flavorful without the heaviness you often get with alfredo.

WOW!  I didnt think that there really could be a homemade Alfredo sauce that tastes as good as this one!  I used fresh garlic-3 cloves smashed and diced- I put the buter, cream cheese, milk and garlic in all at the same time and used a whisk to mix all together. then when at a low simmer I added the parmesan cheese.  The only parm I had though was the grated stuff from kraft. I had no prob using that cheese!

I'm pretty picky about sauces and I was kind of worried that the cream cheese would be too much, but you cant really taste it. I added a little more garlic and pepper, but this sauce is irrisistable!

Just like the other ratings... this was delicious!  Tasted just like alfredo sauce and the cream cheese made it nice and velvety!  I will make this over and over again!  Since I cook organically, this recipe was easy... every ingredient is very easy to find in the organic section!  Thank you!

I have been wanting to try this recipe for a while, and finally got around to it tonight. It was exactly what I expected it to be: not a restaurant grade, but good enough for us. It was thinner than I would have liked, but still stuck to the pasta really well, I tossed the pasta with some of the sauce, then served it up onto plates and added a bit more for good measure. My boyfriend also liked dipping our homemade breadsticks in the extra. I'll try other recipes, but keep this in my collection.

This sauce is amazing.  I was a bit skeptical using a cream cheese for an alfredo sauce, but to my surprise, this was the best tasting alfredo sauce I've ever tried.  The texture is velvety and creamy.  It will definitely become my regular alfredo sauce recipe.

My fiance and I are living in Hungary for school and there are limited things we can get from here. SO I make things from scratch 90% of the time. This is quick and easy, but the taste and consistency wasnt what we expected. It was still good, just not something I would jump to use agian, I think I will look around for a better recipe.

I made this for my family, and the keds really loved it, even my picky daughter who generally doesn't like alfredo.  I made it according to directions, except I used minced garlic instead of granulated, and I added about 1/3 of a 28-oz can of tomato puree to make a tomato alfredo (haven't been able to find a decent recipe for that!).  It turned out wonderful!  However, it didn't thicken up much while it was cooking, but it did while it cooled.  We will definitely make this one again... and again.

I was looking for an easy recipe for dinner, and came across this one. It is one of the best ones I have tried. I used half and half cream as suggested and added a bit more Parmesan. It will be one of my new staple recipes :)

This recipe is just as easy as a packet and tastes better, courtesy of no added preservatives. My husband did suggest adding a bit more pepper next time.

I'm VERY glad I read the reviews of this before I tried it out. Otherwise, when the butter and the cream cheese didn't blend well, I'd have panicked.  This recipe was extremely easy to make, but had a flavor that wasn't exactly "alfredo".  It's not that it tasted like cream cheese, it just wasn't quite the traditional flavor I'd anticipated.  Once I mixed it with the pasta and my other ingredients, it was fine, and my kids loved it.  But for those of you who taste test while cooking, just be aware that it may not be exactly as you expected.

This was so good! I cut back a bit on the butter - used 6 T instead of 8. Next time I'll cut back some more. I also had 1/2 cup of cream, so I used that plus 1 cup of skim milk instead of using 2 cups milk (glad I did that or it would have been way too runny). I also used fresh minced garlic which was wonderful. I didn't have fresh parmesan and didn't have bad results using the packaged powdery stuff. Also used reduced fat cream cheese. I sauteed some shrimp, chicken, broccoli and mushrooms and added that to the sauce and served over penne - what a great meal.

The taste of this sauce was delicious.  I did put 2 cups of half & half instead of milk.  I thought the texture was a little bite grainy, due to the parmesan.  I think next time I will cut the parmesan back a little.  But overall great flavor.

Not to sound repetitive, but this was so 'quick & easy'. And to agree w/ other users, it does taste better the next day. I usually use the leftovers over some grilled tomatoes for brunch.

This was awesome!! I used Boursin cheese instead of cream cheese (cause that's all I had), so I cut back a tiny bit on the garlic powder. I also added a touch of half and half like the others suggested. Perfect for our New Year's Dinner tonight along w/ some stuffed mushrooms and crusty bread...perfection!!!!!!!!!!!

This is my "old standby" recipe.  My whole family (including my very picky 3 year old) loves it.  I love that it doesn't seperate like most Alfredo suaces when refrigerated, and it is just as good the next day.  This recipe makes plenty for lunch the next day.  I bought a plastic wisk specifically for this recipe, I make it so often.  Just be careful when wisking the butter, I tend to get butter splatters on me so I have to remember to wear an apron!  This is one of the best Alfredo sauces we have ever had and it's so easy.  I will try adding nutmeg next time, but I can't imagine it getting any better!

Super yummy and couldn't be simpler!  I scaled it for 1 person; two of us split it over our side of fettuccini. Used half & half I had on hand (instead of milk); a garlic clove minced (instead of powder); & a pinch of nutmeg, as others suggested. Delicioso!

This is how alfredo sauce is supposed to taste.  This recipe is perfect.  "quick and easy" sometimes makes me think "less authentic", but this is wonderful and a perfect standard alfredo sauce.

Easy and yummy. I use the low fat cream cheese, reduced fat Parmesan and 2% milk and it's creamy and thickens nicely. We toss it all together with pasta, chicken, and broccoli and the whole family - including a 4 and almost 2 year old - loves it!

I like the little bit of tang the cream cheese adds. I made this for sauce on a white pizza and it was a big hit! There was also plenty left over so I cooked up some egg noodles for a nice alfredo pasta. Very yummy!

It was different, not what I expected.  Too strong of a cream cheese "tangy" flavor and I found it to be too thin.

Doesn't taste much like "real" alfredo sauce, but still good. Was thick, but maybe I didn't add enough milk. Will make again if I need a quick, easy recipe. But will look for another recipe that doesn't use cream.

I really had my doubts about this at first!  I melted the butter and the cream cheese and it looked like it would never work.  But as soon as I started adding the milk it really came together.  I used milk and 1/2 and 1/2 and added some freshly ground nutmeg then threw in some proscuitto and my husband and I both gobbled it up with never a thought about the fat, calories, etc.  This is a definite keeper and whomever said it cost $7 to make.... where do you buy your groceries?  Neiman Marcus?

My family wasn't crazy about this one.  They didn't like the flavor of the parmesan, so that could have been the problem.  I bought the refrigerated plastic containter of grated cheese you find next to the gourmet cheeses.  I would have probably had better results by grating a higher quality (and expensive) brick of cheese myself and it would have melted better, also.

My son-in-law makes alfredo sauce using heavy cream instead of the milk and cream cheese.  The taste of his sauce is the same, but it is heavier.  I tried this recipe and prefer the cream cheese and milk.

I also agree that the amount of milk this recipe calls for is a bit too much.  The sauce comes a bit on the thin side (but still tastes delicious!).  I solved that problem by adding a tiny bit of corn starch (flour will do the trick as well).

I think I am going to try this recipe next time using low fat cream cheese.  If the taste is the same, I will continue to use it instead of the regular cream cheese.

Quick and easy recipe.  I will be adding this one to my collection!

Flavor wise - perfect.  Consistency wise?  Don't use stick margarine instead of the butter...  it works but it's not quite as good as butter.

This has to be the easiest and cheapest way to make your own alfredo sauce and it tastes great! I did make some changes: I used an Italian blend of shreadded cheese instead of just grated parm, added ALOT of minced garlic(because my family loves garlic) and I needed more milk probably due to the shreadded cheese. It was wonderful!! My husband told me to never buy jar sauce again, just make this.  Thank you for sharing!

This recipe is incredibly quick and easy.  The sauce was great!  I added a bit more parmesan than advised, personal taste.

What an easy recipe for alfredo sauce!  I added three cloves of garlic (minced) in while the butter was melting.  I, like other reviewers, did not add all the milk (I used about 1 1/2 cups) and the consistency was good.  Thanks for an easy alternative!

We like the tang of the cream cheese in this recipe. I actually ran out of milk & used half & half, and although I didn't use a full 2 cups of liquid or the full amount of parmesan, it was still a nice thickness for our angel hair. I added a dash of nutmeg, a few shakes of dried basil, and used a fat clove of garlic instead of the powder. We loved the flavor. Dawn, thanks for a great, easy recipe.

Very much what I was wanting.  Much cheaper than store bought and quite good.  I followed some other reviews and used 8 oz (whole can) parmesan cheese.  I also used Neufachtel rather than cream cheese and skim milk.  It's a winner!

We absolutely loved it. I halved the recipe and the only thing I changed was to add two small cloves of garlic and a little less garlic powder. I love garlic, so next time, I may add a bit more. I served it with some grilled chicken breast chunks. It was super fast, easy and very tasty. It's a keeper!

This recipe wasn't as good as I thought it would be.  The sauce was a little too runny and not thick enough and I agree that fresh garlic would've made the sauce even better.  I do have to say though that it's very quick and convenient to make!

I made this alfredo sauce to use in the Spinach and Artichoke Dip Restaurant Style from this site.  It made enough for two batches of the dip - so I froze one batch to use at a later time.  My husband is amazed at how awesome the dip was, and asked how to make the alfredo sauce.  He said that the sauce DEFINATELY made the dip AWESOME!

doesnt taste like alfredo perse but it is a good sauce. the mixture was a bit too thin but a long cooking time with constant stirring thickens it up a little bit.

This sauce is AWESOME and so easy to make.  I love that I didn't have to mess with cream and I could use what I had on hand.  It turned out wonderful!  I have tried several different recipes for alfredo sauce and this is by far the best yet!  Next time I might try adding some crumbled blue cheese with the parmesean just for fun.  Oh and I added a little nutmeg for flavor.

I made this as a low cal/ low fat recipe using fat free cream cheese, light margarine, skim milk and low fat parmesan. It was actually very good as a lower fat version!

This was way to rich. It gave my husband and I a belly ache. I will stick to the traditional way of making alfredo.

I have made this many times.  It is great on pasta or on pizza.  It is easy, fast and I think better than a lot of other alfredo recipes that use cream.

This recipe was wonderful and easy!  I made mine another way, but this turned out great!  The cream cheese does make all the difference!  I am making it again tonight because my boyfriend loved it so much!  Thank you!

This was so easy and delicious!  Alfredo sauce is my favorite - and this recipe is almost as good as resturant quality.

* I also used lowfat cream cheese, and low fat parm.  I don't think it makes a difference in the taste.

Exactly what the recipe says.  Flavor was good.  Next time I may add fresh garlic.  I mixed in with a pesto sauce with shrimp and fetticini.  YUM.

Just browsing for something quick and good to do with chicken and spaghetti. I threw in some green pepper that I had left over.  This was awesome.  I didn't have enough cream cheese so I cut the recipe in half and we had plenty for the 2 of us.  Asked the Mister if I should save the recipe (LOL) and he looked at me like I had 2 heads.  Thanks for the great dinner!

My daughter loves alfredo sauce, so when I chanced upon this recipe, I tried it after reading the reviews. I browned some diced chicken in butter,and added some dried oregano  and ground nutmeg. The texture was never lumpy, in fact it was very thin, so I only added 1 cup of milk. Delicious tasting sauce, will make again. Thank you Dawn.

Tasted good, but for some reason, my sauce did not thicken.  I cooked it for ten minutes more than the recommended time.  I'm not sure if it was me, but I followed the directions exactly.

This sauce is outstanding. I love Alfredo and have tried every package and jarred kind I can find, and this beats them all hands down. It keeps very well in the refrigerator and works great for a quick dinner for kids.

We are huge fans of Olive Garden's alfredo sauce.  This is the closest home recipe I've found to it. It was delicious!  Very easy and our family loved it. I used 1/3 less fat cream cheese to cut a little bit on the fat, and it was still rich, thick and licked clean.

This was fantastic.  My husband and I love alfredo and this is so much cheaper and better than the store bought.  We sautee shrimp in wine and asian seasoning and added to it.  It was devine.  I will definately use this again.

This was good but not great. I thought after reading all the wonderful reviews that this would be the one, but I feel that it was too rich and made way too much for 4 servings. I think I will keep searching.

Very good! I added a little extra parmesan and a touch of salt.  Served it over chicken, bell pepper and bacon on a bed of noodles.  Turned out great.It would have been a bit bland with just noodles.

Hmmm this was ok, i'm eating it as I type.  Although i LOVE the idea of using cream cheese, its just kinda bland.

I tried this recipe tonight and added it to pasta, cut up chicken breasts and broccoli.  It was very easy to make and was absolutely delicious.  My husband said it was THE BEST alfredo sauce he's ever had.  Wow, that made me really happy!  Thanks so much for this fabulous recipe!

I've always used a package mix to make my alfredo sauce and was hoping that by taking the extra effort to make the sauce from scratch it would taste as wonderful as the reviews made it out to be; however, even though it was relatively easy to make and had a nice creamy consistency, my entire family did not like the overwhelming taste the cream cheese gave this recipe. I guess it just depends on what kind of flavor you are used to - and this was not it.  If I were to make this recipe again, I would only use half of the cream cheese.

This turned out SO well! My husband loved it and when he took leftovers to work the next day everyone wanted to try it! The only thing I changed was using a homeade alfredo sauce in place of the premade. We will definately have this again!

This sauce is delicious.  I use fresh garlic and a little basil and fresh mushrooms in it.  I cook fettucine and sprinkle shredded chicken on top then pour the sauce over top. WONDERFUL

Thanks Dawn for this easy and great tasting recipe for alfredo sauce.  I have tried many but couldn't find the one that is a match for resturant quality.  I used Smart Balance instead of butter and used reduced fat cream cheese and milk.  It was creamy and tasking great. After I was done with this sauce, I mixed pasta sauce and my god, my pasta was very tasty.  My 2 year old finished her first serving without talking a single word and asked for seconds.  My husband had three serving.  It is a definate keeper.

VERY GOOD!!! It makes alot. Since we have 7 in our family I doubled it since I was putting it over tortelli. It was a nice change from our usual marinera sauce. We still have leftovers and are using it on many different things like leftover steak or as a dipping sauce. Very similar to the alfredo sauce at Olive Garden. It's the closest thing I found.

Wow!  This was, by far, the easiest and best alfredo sauce I've ever made!  When the cream cheese first started melting, and looked lumpy, I was worried.  However, it was a perfect sauce, in the end.  In fact, I had to fight off my teenage son, to be able to keep enough for my recipe!  Thanks for sharing; I will be making this frequently!

I suggest using freshly grated cheese.  It made my 2nd batch of sauce smoother than the first (I used the grated from the jar).

OK - I thought I had a bag of shredded parm cheese, but after I'd started the recipe I realized it was mozza...so I forged on!!  I used 1/2 cup parm from a can and approximately 6 ounces of the mozzarella and it tasted SO GOOD.  I thought it would be way too much garlic powder, but next time I might add more, and I will definitely try with the parm cheese.

Excellent recipe!  My friend is VERY picky about her alfredo sauce, and she thought this was the best she's ever had.  I believe her!  The cream cheese definitely makes this recipe work.  I mixed 1 part milk with 1 part half and half to thicken it up a bit  Other than that, followed the recipe exactly.  Yum!

I had my doubts about this recipe and how it would turn out but it was amazing. A couple of people said that it tastes just like the alfredo sauce at the Olive Garden and they weren't kidding! I had about a half cup of whipping cream in my fridge that I added & then I added about 2 more oz of cheese & a bit of corn starch because the cream thinned the sauce. It tastes amazing. I put half in the fridge for tomorrow! I will definately make this again!

WOW!  This alfredo sauce was great!  I loved it.  The best part of the recipe was the cream cheese.  That's what made this recipe!  Next time, I'm going to add a tad bit more garlic powder, just because I love garlic!!  Great recipe!!

Recipe is just as it states .. quick and easy.  The description is missing one thing, however, delicious.  I was sceptical about using cream cheese, but it's great.  Holds together well also vs. cream and butter which tends to seperate.  I highly recommend this one.  As my husband said .. "this one is a keeper"!  Enjoy  :)

i found the flavour on the bland side. though i used fresh garlic instead of the powder. perhaps i didn't use enough. maybe i'll try it using the powder next time. though i was impressed that it uses cream cheese instead of cream. i thought it would taste like cream cheese but it didn't.

This tastes exactly like the kind from The Olive Garden. I ate half of it with with pasta and the other with just a slice of toast. It was way too easy to taste this good. The best recipe I've tried in this site! Easy and delicious!Will not disapoint.

This is a winner! Especially with my picky eater children!  I'm not one to follow a recipe's ingredient list to a tee, and I don't care for too much parmesan.  I used a 4 italian cheese blend and not sure how much.  We will use this recipe often when looking for a quick meal. Thank you for this recipe!

This sauce turned out very well.  However, you have to serve it immediately, because it tends to thicken up rather quickly.  I didn't have plain cream cheese, so in a pinch, substituted chive and onion cream cheese, which complimented it nicely.  Leftovers of this dish were tasty also!

We loved this recipe, it was so simple and easy. I did make a couple changes. I added a tad of nutmeg to it to give it some zing. And I addes shrimp when I cooked the butter and let it simmer in the butter and garlic...it turned out very flavorful and tender-not chewy! I also added some salt, but it was unnecessary, I will omitt next time. The only down side is that I had way too much left over(its just me & dh), I will half the recipe next time.

I've tried quite a few recipes for alfredo sauce, which turned out okay but were usually somewhat complicated. This recipe is quite easy, and it was much better than all of the others! I'm sticking with this one from now on!

this is an AWESOME recipe for crab alfredo. Just add some canned crab meat not imitation or shrimp is great too. However if you choose not to add anything its a little bit too soupy for me but its still awesome!!!!

Very easy to make, but I guess I prefer a tomato based sauce.

OMGoodness! This is the best way to make Alfredo.  It really is quick and easy.  This time I did not have enough butter, so I used 1/2 EVOO.  They forgot to add the word yummy to the title.  My oldest son does not like cheese sauce, but he loves this.  I make mine with chicken or ground turkey.

Everyone in my family loved this and it was super easy to make. I didn't change a thing to the sauce.  I used shells and cut up chicken. 
Did I say YUMMY!

This is a great alfredo recipe.  I was looking for something that didn't use heavy whipping cream, like my normal recipe calls for.  This was perfect and tasted delicious!  It was very easy to make too.  I tossed it with chicken and fettucini noodles.

Eh, it was just OK.  If I made this again, I would use much less parmesaen cheese seeing as that's practically all I can taste in this.  I liked it, but, it wasn't anything special.  I still prefer the type from the jar.

Sorry, I just didn't think it was anything special.

I probably wont make it again.

I have never found a store bought alfredo sauce that tastes right, and now I can finally have alfredo at home!  This recipe is soooooooo good!  I'm looking forward to leftovers at noon! Also used fresh minced garlic instead of garlic powder. MmmMmm

My husband liked it, but I thought it was very cream cheesy tasting.  When I added the cheese, there was about 1 minute when the mix turned slimy and stretched out on the spoon.  I was concerned it was ruined!  But I kept cooking, and within another minute or two, the cheese melted and it was a wonderful consistency.  I used an electric mixer to make it very smooth before serving and remove a couple of lumps.  I will probably make again, but will only use about half as much cream cheese so it does not dominate the flavor.  I added a little lemon juice and nutmeg to try to change the flavor, but it still tasted like melted cream cheese to me.

This was absolutely delicious!  Much more flavorful than the store bought brand.  I, too, reduced the amount of butter and used low fat cream cheese.  You couldn't tell the difference.  I also added minced garlic to enhance the flavor (I love garlic).  I served it over the "Absolutely Fabulous Mushroom Tortellini".  Before he even sat down to eat, my husband had taken a bite and said I was going to love it- he was right!

I liked thie recipe, but I think it was lacking some strong flavor.  I sauteed shrimp as a bonus.  I think it would give it a better flavor is you used fresh garlic instead of the powder.

I tried another recipe that made the Alfredo sauce from scratch. But it took to long to make. Yours is much easier to make and it taste a lot better. It will be one of my favorites.

We all loved this recipe.  I added in some cooked broccoli and part of a rotisserie chicken and served over angel hair pasta.  I went to eat the leftovers the next day, but my husband got to them first!

This is fast, quick and SO easy (I love easy)- served it over al dente penne with some quick-fry crumbled sausage on the side. I never measure, just tossed in a stick of unsalted butter, pack o cream cheese, the milk and continued to add the grated Parm until I felt it looked right.  Don't go overboard on the garlic.... and bring the black pepper mill to the table!

The consistency for this recipe was PERFECT, but I, too, was overpowered by the creamcheese taste. However, the recipe is good enough that I'm going to continue to play with the recipe. If I can tweak it enough, I'll change my rating and share my changes!!!

I made this sauce to use in the seafood lasagna recipe I also found on this site. It called for alfredo sauce from a jar, but I can't stand nutmeg, so I searched for a recipe on this site. I have to say that this is the BEST alfredo I have ever had! I didn't even notice any cream cheese taste as another reviewer stated. My husband thought I used heavy cream! This recipe will be a permanent one in my book!

This recipe was a little bland to me. So added about 4 slices of white American cheese to give it a little kick. MMMMMmmmm Good!

I can always tell if my husband really likes a recipe if he takes left-overs for lunch. These didn't even make it that far! He had two servings for dinner and the rest for breakfast! Needless to say, I will have to make this again and again. So easy and so, so good.

The recipe in itself is not quite what i was looking for but it is a great start.  I couldn't quite get enough garlic in it the first time to make me happy but i am certainly willing to try again. Just needs a bit more kick to make me happy.  I will absolutely keep using it because it is so easy!

This is a very simple and very good recipe for a quick alfredo sauce. I prepare it for my wife and myself all the time, but rather than sticking to the measurements given, I play it by feel until I get the taste and texture I like.

Great thing about it is it'll work just as well with skim milk and reduced fat cream cheese.

HOLY SMOKES, THIS IS GOOD!!!!! The key is to use fresh parmesean cheese, not the stuff in the can. I have made it with chicken, and shrimp. I usually add just a touch of nutmeg and instead of the garlic powder, I always use fresh. I wish I could give this more stars. This is a family favorite!!!

This recipe is dangerous----it is sooo good that you could hurt yourself eating it.  I was looking for an alfredo sauce recipe since, I had never made it before, and came across this one.  My whole family loved it.  It is also great to dip breadsticks in.  All I can say is "Yum!!"  Super recipe!

The title says it all! Not only is it quick and easy but it is so yummy.  I have made this sauce for many people and they have nothing but great things to say!  Just as a quick note to all: I use garlic flavor cream cheese and cut out the 2 teaspoons of garlic.
Good luck and happy eating:)

This was good. I used extra fresh garlic and used more pepper. A good sauce for many dishes. Thanks!

UPDATE: My kids ask for this all the time "Mom will you make it homeade" instead of the expensive refrigerated ready-made I buy in a hurry....This is an excellent alfredo recipe! I added about a tsp of lemon juice (no lemon pepper), fresh ground pepper, kosher salt, and a bay leaf. I tossed in a handful of fresh parmesan cheese at the end. Less milk. Yum!

Very easy to prepare and I like that it uses cream cheese, which I usually have on hand, as opposed to whipping cream. I served it over angel hair w/ broccoli and chicken and it tasted great.

Excellent! This is so easy and because I was preparing two dishes (for our Italian night) for dinner, I didn't have alot of time to create an elaborate sauce. Plus, we live overseas and our nearest commissary is about 40 minutes away..which doesn't make running to the store for last minute ingredients an option. We really loved it and the cream cheese does give it good flavor. Just makes sure that use a quality parmesan cheese... it really does make all the difference. Thanks, Dawn!

It came out ok. It was grainy and very thick (ricotta cheese type thick),but I think it was my fault.I think I added a little too much cream cheese. The flavor itself was good,just not the texture. I used fat free cream cheese,half fat free milk and half fat free half&half,and shredded parmesan/romano cheese. I also took the advice of some people and cooked some minced garlic in the butter in the begining and I parcooked some pasta and put it in a casserole dish. I cooked it at 350 degrees for 10 minutes. I added some cubed cooked ham for added texture and salt.I ended up tossing it out only because it was toooooo thick and grainy. The taste was good enough to attempt to try it again next time. Hopefully, with better results in regards to the texture.  :-)

I just made this recipe (halved since I didn't have tons of macaroni to top) and I thought it was very good. I used light cream cheese, only 1 tbsp of margarine, onion and garlic powder, and both parsley and chives. I thought it was a great quick sauce and the consistency was perfect. I have tried many versions of alfredo sauce and this is versatile enough to make low, medium or full fat versions!!The parsley & chives really  added a extra flavor - thanks for a great recipe!@

I was expecting a good alfredo sauce with this recipe after reading all of the reviews, but my family did not like it at all.  I followed the recipe exactly and cream cheese dominated the flavor.  It tasted more like a cream sauce than an alfredo sauce. It also made a lot of sauce..too much for 4 people. While it was a nice consistency, it was really lacking in flavor.

This is a very good sauce. This was the first time I have made alfredo and it was quick & easy. I was a little low on milk so I used 1/2 milk (skim) and 1/2 heavy whipping cream. Next time I will use fresh garlic and a little more pepper to get a bolder taste. Overall I was very happy with this recipe!

I didn't make this exactly as stated as I wanted to cut down on the fat content. I used ff cream cheese, reduced fat parmesean, and ff evaporated milk instead of plain milk. I added extra garlic since my family loves it, but we still found this to be a little bland. Not too bad though, and easy to make.

This recipe was good, but way too rich. I'm not sure what I did wrong but there was to much cheese. I think next time I will spend the $5 on the good stuff in the jar. Sorry!!

I scaled this to one for myself and there was plenty.  I added chopped red bell pepper for color and a few chopped onions.  This is a very versatile basic recipe that can be adjusted to many ideas.  Also used 2% milk and 1/2 less fat cream cheese.  Excellent.

This was quick and easy and tasted so much better than the jarred stuff. I did use extra freshly grated parmesan, and a dash of nutmeg. I agree with the others, it does make a large portion of sauce, I mixed it with a bag of brocolli, carrot and shell blend with chicken breasts cut up in strips and browned. Excellent!

Excellent! I was searching for an easy alfredo sauce that didn't require heavy cream (I am all out!). I tried this one and this will be my staple alfredo from now on. Absolutely excellent!

Excellent recipe: cheap, quick and easy (ideal for students, even)! This is the kind of recipe that doesn't test my cooking expertise, and makes me come off as a pro. My boyfriend loved it. I browned some chicken and mushrooms and added them in as well. Just add a caesar salad and ta-da! You're set. Thanks, you saved me!

Wow!  Very good sauce!  I made it one night in a playful cookoff against my husband and I won, hands down.  Top top it off I used all lowfat or light ingredients and it was still awesome.  I will continue to make this again and again.

I'll give this a 3 or 4 star. I'm sure it would be better if you use full fat ingreds. but I used fat free cream cheese and skim milk. I also had way more sauce than for 4 people.

I like to call it "Poor mans alfredo sauce,"  because it really is "Quick" and "Easy" to make.  Not only that I doubled the recipe to take it to work and we had enough left over for the next week.  No one could believe I would spend so much money on expensive cheeses and such.  Great recipe!!

Awesome tasting sauce and I've tried a few others from scratch...the garlic added what my others were missing.  I would have given a 5 star but I think it calls for too much milk.  I halfed the recipe and only used 3/4 C. milk but had to add a few shakes of wondraflour to thicken.  I guessed on the amount of parmesean so maybe more cheese would have thickened it too.  AWESOME...will definately use again.

The best and easiest sauce ever! Will never buy bottled nor prepackaged sauce again.  I used minimal margarine, lowfat cream cheese and milk.  I parcooked the pasta. Placed it in a casserole dish with the sauce. Baked it covered for about 10 minutes at 350 degrees.  If the sauce gets too thick add a little more milk and margarine and place back in the oven. Sprinkled more cheese on top when serving.  My family was thrilled.  Will definitely make again and again. Thanks Dawn for sharing the recipe!

Too good to be true- quick, easy and you forgot...inexpensive! The first time I made it, we had it alone on pasta as a side dish, but add a bit of chicken and some fresh veggies and you have a complete meal.

Great! My picky 2 and 5 year old kids didn't complain at dinner tonight...  That means it was very good.  I used low fat cream cheese, 2% milk, sauteed garlic, pinch of nutmeg, and jar parm cheese.  Next time I will get fresh cheese and shred it myself.  Dinner was ready in 10 minutes tonight!  Thanks for the quick recipe!!!

This was the best alfredo sauce I have ever made; better than most restaurants.  I too used 1 cup heavy cream and 1 cup milk.  I used fresh chopped garlic, red bell pepper and green onions which were sauted in the butter.  For spices I substituted garlic pepper for the pepper.  Also added shredded broiled chicken breasts.  Thank You!

The Alfredo sauce tasted really good! It was fast and easy. I used 1 cup milk and 1 cup heavy whipping cream and cut back on the garlic. It turned out rather nice...however you have to stir constantly so the sauce won't burn. For a great meal...use the recipe on this site for the Italian chicken marinade and grill the chicken to top the pasta. For an even faster meal, grill the chicken using a "George Foreman" type of grill. FAST, EASY and DELICIOUS!

Outstanding!  My husband said this was restaurant quality.  Be patient with the cooking time, it was definitely longer than 5 minutes to get it thick and have the cheese completely melted.  I added mushrooms and salmon for more texture.

This is great!  I came across this recipe and happened to have all the ingredients, and made the Alfredo as a sidedish to chicken and green beans. I'm sure glad I did!  It's creamy and delicious. My fiance also loved it, and he doesn't really care for Alfredo.  Thanks for this recipe!!

Thank you so much for this recipe!!!  This was my first attempt at alredo sauce from scratch and it turned out great. I used chicken & broccoli & penne pasta with this sauce and my family thought that it tasted wonderful!!!  Thanks again this one is definitely a keeper.

I didn't care for this recipe...We thought it was bland, and the sauce was rather thin consistency.
Maybe next time I will try with heavy cream instead of milk.

This alfredo sauce was so tasty!  I couldn't believe how easy it was.  I used light cream cheese and chopped garlic and still tasted awesome!  When I make it again I may cut back on the butter.  Thanks Dawn for sharing!

Great, easy recipe.  I substituted sliced garlic, but you have to saute on really low heat so the butter won't burn.  Next time I'll use minced garlic.

Mamma Mia!!  This pasta sauce really is quick, easy and delicious!  My family loved it!  I was short 1/4 cup milk so substituted white wine.  Extra parmesan also added to the flavor.  Grilled chicken breast and steamed broccoli made a wonderful meal.  Thanks Dawn!

This recipe is absolutely perfect! My husband, who hates italian and cream cheese in anything absolutely loved this recipe. It's fast and tastes so good, I felt like we had gone out to eat afterward. I did add bottled garlic instead of garlic powder. This is the best recipe ever because it is fast and tastes perfect. Thank you so much, Dawn. This is one to pull out to impress company with...

Excellent sauce!  Very smooth and creamy, and so simple to make.  I added fresh minced garlic as the butter melted to give it that extra garlic flavor.  Yum!

This was not quite "restaurant quality", but much better than store-bought.  And it was great that I had everything for it on hand.  I would make it again.

This blend of cream cheese and milk is a surprisingly good combintation.  It tastes like authentic alfredo sauce from a restaurant, it's that good.  My whole family liked it...thanks!
