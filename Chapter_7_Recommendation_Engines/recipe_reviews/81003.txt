This recipe is a nice alternative even to alternative peanut butter. As an alternative to sugary peanut butter, I've been getting just plain peanut butter from a grinder in the natural foods section of our grocery store. This recipe is more palatable and doesn't dry out like the peanut-only butter. This definitely gets two thumbs up from me and my kids!

I make this often.  I halve the recipe and whirl it in my food processor.  Very good.

Let me start by saying, I NEVER eat peanut butter unless it's wrapped in chocolate.  I decided to make this recipe to use up roasted soy nuts that I had been given as a gift. I halved the recipe and let my six year old make the peanut butter. It tastes great as is, but I would prefer a creamier spread.  Next time I will use more honey and oil and process a bit longer.
