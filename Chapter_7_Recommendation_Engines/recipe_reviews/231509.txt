I made half a recipe to see if we liked it, which would be 3 each carrots and celery.  Once I chopped 2, I knew 3 would be too much, so I left them out.  Two cups of water wasn’t enough to even cover the chicken breasts, so more water and a little more soup base went into the pot initially.  I shredded the chicken and put it into the pot along with the veggies and the rice.  Once I mixed in the rice, I knew it needed even more liquid, since rice cooks at a 1 part rice to 2 parts liquid ratio, so I added some chicken broth.  After simmering for 30 minutes, neither the rice nor the carrots were cooked, so back on for another 15 minutes.  When I next checked, the rice had absorbed most of the additional chicken broth.  I know she says this is a very thick soup, but at that point, it was on the verge of totally drying out, so I added even more chicken broth to reach a soup consistency (and it was still “thick”).   The instructions aren't good, but it does taste good, so if you're prepared to tweak, go for it!

The addition of tarragon and basil in the recipe was BRILLIANT!! I've been making chicken soup for 35 years and was really hesitant to add the basil. I had no problem adding the tarragon as I love it with chicken, but basil? I just wasn't so sure. Well, the combination of them both was INCREDIBLE to say the least! The only change I made was to make my own chicken stock and to use the meat from a whole chicken. I will never make another pot of chicken soup any other way. Thank you Rubyjewel for a SUPERB receipe!!

This was a very flavorful soup that my husband gave a  thumbs up!  

I used 6 cups of chicken stock.   I chose to saute the recipe's veggies in EVOO prior to adding to stock, but reduced the carrots and celery stalks to 4 each.  I added white meat from leftover rotisserie chicken.   Did need to add more water since the rice does absorb the liquid.  I would opt to cook rice separately next time.

If I ever make this again, I'd use half the rice mentioned or skip it altogether and use orzo or other small pasta. It was WAY too thick to be called soup... or stew... more like a rice casserole. The tarragon made it very flavorful.

Great the first time.  Second and third time. Skip the cream of chicken and use a homemade chicken stock, and light cream. Add some green onions ends, shallots, or leeks. This recipe has so many ways to change it up to make something special to you. Add some smoked sausage, seafood, or pork with the trinity and make a great gumbo. Fabulous as presented, and so many options to add.

I have made this previously.  2nd time I made it, since my family isn't keen on celery so I used 4 stalks and chopped it into large pieces for the flavor but not the texture (if I am making, they will eat around it).  I also added a bit more water- 5 total cups and pre-cooked rice- as I found that it wasn't soupy enough for our tastes.  It smells and tastes good, especially with fresher vegetables, unlike the first time when I used frozen, as that is all I had in the house.  I do recommend this recipe

The tarragon is a great flavor for this soup! I make a similar soup, but use a lot more broth to rice.  The ratio of broth to rice that I use is probably more like 3-4 quarts broth to ***1*** cup of rice (but I use brown rice in a slow cooker, which might make a difference?).  Actually, I typically only make this when I have a roasted chicken.  After the bones are picked relatively clean, I place the leftover meat in the fridge, only adding it to the soup at the end, just to warm through. I the meantime, I place the bones in a 4-5 qt. slow cooker overnight with plenty of water, salt and vinegar, as well as onion peel scraps, and similar veggie scraps, if I have them on hand.  ---  In the a.m., I pull out the bones, strain the broth if needed, put in some fresh onions (chopped), and garlic (maybe whole cloves), possibly carrots, and the seasonings, plus the rice.  Shortly before serving, I place the chicken meat in, and possibly (but not often) some frozen peas.  The result is amazing comfort food.  SO, IMHO, RubyJewel did a great job on everything, except the amount of broth........, but then, I don't use white rice and don't do a quick stove-top cooking of the rice...., which might make a good bit of difference.

Required a lot more water, but filling 3/4 full left too little room for rest of the ingredients.  Once you work out the amounts for your pot, the rest is great.  Lots of flavor.

My wife declared this to be the best chicken rice soup she had ever had.  The only difference I made was to use thighs instead of breast but it was wonderful.  Definitely a favorite!

This was delicious. When I make soup I always use whatever  veggies I have on hand and all broth for liquid. This was actually a bit thicker so extremely filling. I would definitely make again.

I never do onion with chicken and didn't have fresh garlic so I used garlic powder. And I couldn't wrap my head around a TABLESPOON!! of Tarragon and Basil. Every one of my mom's recipes doesn't have more than a 1/4 to 1/3 tsp in there and she was an excellent cook. She could give you people a run for your money. And there was TONS of flavor with a third tsp in the soup. Tasted real good, This will be going into my Recipe's file

The flavor is great!  I only gave 4 stars because the water to rice and veggie ratio is not enough.  I ended up adding 3 more cups of stock to the pot.  Tarragon is wonderful!

I used marjoram in place of tarragon, twice the chicken base, and almost three times the water. Yum! I'll definitely make this again and again!

I have made this soup several times and it is simple and delicious. I used a little more celery than called for as I love the flavor but otherwise made as written. As other's have said you will need to add more water as it cooks but I find that with most soups.

If you don't have tarragon you can substitute it with an item below. 

Just use your choice of the following herbs in an amount equal to that which is called for in your recipe:
Marjoram.
Oregano.
Rosemary.
Dill.
Basil.
To substitute dried tarragon with fennel seed or anise seed, use one pinch for each teaspoon of tarragon the recipes specifies.

The BEST tasting chicken and rice soup I have made. I almost subbed thyme for tarragon because it's usually my go to for chicken dishes but I didn't and I'm SO happy I didn't. Since I prefer more liquid in my soup I did almost double the water and chicken base. I also always sauté my soup veggies first before adding liquid. Great recipe!

The flavor was amazing!  However, like the other reviews stated, I had to add quite a bit more broth than indicated in the recipe and I also added more salt.

I loved this recipe. The soup was delicious! That being said I did adjust some ingredients and amounts.
I used 6.5 cups of water, 2thighs, legs, 1 split breast. And I used precooked rice and threw it in last 10 minutes so it wouldn't get mushy (actually brown rice leftover from Chinese!). I simmered chicken in water w base for 45 minutes then removed meat from bones. Then simmered veggies and meat another 30 minutes b4 adding rice.

I liked this soup however I admit that after reading the reviews, I had to be ready to tweak the steps to make it happen. I used all the ingredients called for. In terms of the steps, I cubed the chicken breast and seared it in a teaspoon of vegetable oil. Then, added the vegetables and cooked them until softened then added the herbs, water, and soup base. I let it simmer for about 15 minutes and lastly added the rice. Then let it cook for 15 minutes with an extra cup of water. At all times, the water was added warm never cold. Also, I kept a close eye on the amounts of veggies and the rice given I made a bit less than half the recipe (4 servings). Two small carrots and one celery stick was enough. I used a mixture of white and brown rice, BUT  I  used slightly less rice. In fact, I removed about 1 tbsp of rice. I rectified salt and pepper at the end. It was very good even though the residual heat from the range top evaporated some of the liquid. I will make this soup again and will try it with a combo of dried parsley and basil instead of the tarragon. I think it would be a bit different in flavor but just as delicious!

This is a good, filling soup. I always use fresh ingredients for soup. We were snowed in,  and I still was able to make delicious soup.  I doubled the amount of everything except the rice. I used dried herbs, chicken bouillon , dried celery  dried onion, a bag of frozen carrots,  minced garlic from a jar, and a package of chicken cut for stir fry from the freezer.  Everyone loved it.  I can't wait to make this soup with fresh ingredients. YUM

I love this recipe I made it on a rainy day, super cozy. The first time I made this it ended up being super thick from just putting the rice in. So when my daughter wasn't feeling good I made it again and this time I rinsed off the starch on the rice.  The recipe makes a lot of soup so it would be great for a pot luck.

I made this soup for my friends that own a restaurant. I needed to make a ton because they tend to put what I make as a special on the menu. the tarragon(I used fresh) was perfect! I only added a few chopped zuchini to the pot for color and to bulk it up.  it was awesome! thank you!

Made this soup when I was nursing a bad cold and it was perfect! I did make a few modifications. You will most definitely need more than 4 cups of water. I used 4 cups of water with 4 additional cups of chicken stock. I only had a bone-in chicken breast and 2 drumsticks, so I just threw those in and removed and discarded the skin and bones after they were cooked. I used only 4 carrots and 4 sticks of celery and that was plenty. Lastly, I sauteed the veggies in a little olive oil before adding them to the stock. It smelled and tasted wonderful. Will definitely have this on my rotation, especially for sick days!
