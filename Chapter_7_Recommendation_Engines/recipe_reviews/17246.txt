I used cut-up chicken but next time will use skinless chicken breast. Overall quite tasty and the chicken was moist. Served with rice.

Made this for when some family came over was a big hit! Then I took the left overs to work and shared; almost everyone wanted the recipe. My husband put it on the "make again" list

I substituted the whole chicken for 4 chicken breasts. I also have a tip for making the sauce: mix your corn starch in with the room temperature peach juice before adding it to the hot pan! I am not familiar with corn starch so much and didn't know that it clumps when mixed with hot liquids. So- I had to make the sauce twice! It turned out very good it was pretty sweet. I served it over rice to balance out the sweetness.

A nice combination of sweet and tangy. Who would guess tomatoes and peaches could work together so well? I found it a little time consuming because of prepping the chicken and will probably just use 6 boneless skinless breasts next time. Even my picky son ate some!

I have loved this recipe for a few years now! It's very colorful and tasty tangy and juicy. I have had wonderful compliments on it. I serve it with wild rice and a vegetable and it's wonderful!

I used half the amount of peaches and I am glad I did. It was quite sweet..I liked the sweet but I do think it needed some heat so I added some crushed red pepper flakes. I used boneless skinless breasts and they did come out very moist
