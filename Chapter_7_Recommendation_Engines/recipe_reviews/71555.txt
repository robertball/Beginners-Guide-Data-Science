This recipe is just yummy...I did make two changes, though.  First of all I added garlic to the mix, because I love it and I only cooked the pork for the inital 10 minutes.  I then removed it while I cooked down the cream and broth mixture.  Once the sauce had cooked down, I put the pork back in to heat it up.  This is a terrific recipe and I really appreciate having found it!

This was spectacular - We made the 4 servings for the two of us and didn't stop until it was all gone.  Based on the reviews and what I had on hand, I made several changes. First, I used 1/2 tsp each dried sage and parsley in place of fresh.  I added 1 clove minced garlic, 1/2 tsp oregano and 1/2 tsp basil, all of which I associate with good Italian recipes. I also added an extra tablespoon sun-dried tomatoes.  I substituted fat-free half and half for heavy cream and used 1 cup along with 1 cup chicken broth.  I also added 2 tablespoons flour mixed with water to thicken the sauce.  The entire mixture was spooned over penne pasta at the table.  This can be made from uncooked pork tenderloin as the recipe calls for or from left-over tenderloin grilled using a marinade.  If using the left-over, add pork strips at the same time as called for, but remove prior to adding the broth and cream.  Keep warm, then add back to the sauce after thickened.  This is very easy to make and is a real gourmet treat.  Thank you so much Anna and reviewers!

Update: Fresh seasonings make ALL the difference.  I use FRESH sage, parsley, basil and oregano.  We make it so much we started an herb garden almost entirely for this recipe.  They are in 12" pots and come in the house during the winter.  Fantastic!

I am not a huge fan of pork, but my husband loves it so I thought I'd give this a try. I have made this a few times now, and it has quickly become one of our favorite meals. I do make a few changes. I sautee mushrooms and minced garlic along with the onions, herbs, and prosciutto. The first time I made this the tomatoes got a little too done for me, so now I throw them in with the pork instead of with the above ingredients. To make the recipe a little healthier, I use fat free half and half in place of the cream, and it's still great. When I have spinach on hand, I throw that in as well. Typically I omit the salt since there is already enough salt from the pork/prosciutto/broth. We eat this over brown rice. This is a simple dish to make that looks much more difficult and is great for company.

This was a very tasty recipe for pork tenderloin.  I did make changes as suggested by other reviewers.  I pan-seared the pork first which I cut into 1 inch thick medallions rather than strips and then removed them.  I didn't have fresh herbs so used 1/2 tsp. each of oregano, sage and basil and added garlic & mushrooms to the rest of the suggested ingredients.  I deglazed the pan with about a 1/4 c. of wine and let some of it boil off.  For extra sauce, I used 1 cup cream and 1 cup chicken broth mixed with 2 tbsp. flour to thicken it.  Once thickened, I added the pork to re-heat and cook through.  Served over mashed potatoes with steamed broccoli and my family just loved it!

Absolutely fantastic! Simple to prepare and it looked beautiful. I served with mashed potatoes instead of pasta. Also, poured a Covey Run Cabernet Sauvignon ($8 a bottle). Terrific match of flavors. The only tweaking I did was to use dried sage because I couldn't find any fresh and added a bit of fresh minced garlic. You cannot have Italian cooking without garlic. I may have added a bit more heavy cream and chicken broth because I didn't measure. This was wonderful and I cannot wait to make it again. This is in my top five of all time great Allrecipes contributions.

Lots of prep work for a dish that was  okay, but not stand out memorable. Even though I'm Italian and grew up with the stuff, I never did like prosciutto so I used bacon instead.  Used shallots because that's what I had, and added some garlic.  I sliced the tenderloin into medallions, dredged them with flour, then sauteed them. I removed them to a platter and set them aside while I sauteed the bacon, shallots and garlic. I deglazed the pan with white wine, then added the sun dried tomatoes, sage, parsley, broth and cream. I returned the pork tenderloin to the pan and cooked over medium heat until the meat was cooked through and the sauce had thickened. It certainly was a beautiful dish, but just didn't have the same wow factor in taste. I've made far tastier pork tenderloin dishes with fewer ingredients and half the effort.

Very good. A few notes: I added garlic, and just before serving (over penne pasta) I added about 1/4 cup grated parm. The sauce did not thicken even after 20 minutes...but it was still very tasty. Next time I probubly wont use the sage.

OMG!!! This was incredible and is my new favorite from All Recipes…what a great low carb dish!  I made this last night for my very picky in-laws and my neighbor who doesn't like pork tenderloin.  I was a little nervous about the sage and considered using basil instead; luckily the grocery store was out of basil.  Both my husband and father-in-law had seconds and my neighbor said not only does he now like pork tenderloin but also it was the best meal I have ever made (and we cook together a lot.)  Even the kids ate it up.

Per other recommendations I did double the sauce (good thing because we ran out!) and I also added a few cloves of garlic before I sautéed the first 5 ingredients.  I would also recommend thickening the sauce if you can stand the additional carbs.  I served it with gigli pasta (flower shaped) and sautéed spinach with garlic.  We also passed Parmesan for sprinkling.

Everyone asked for the recipe and I can’t wait to make this again, thanks Annacoyne!

Made this for my husband and I and it is certainly a keeper.   I did brown the tenderloin first, removed it and made the sauce separately.  Added the tenderloin at the end and allowed it to heat thru.  Pork remained juicy and tender amd it certainly is a perfect company dish.  Served it with coucous cooked in orange juice.  Thanks.

My husband was thrilled with this dish. . asked me to make a double batch and freeze individual portions to take to work. I thought it was very nice. I think i'd amp up the herbs a bit more.

This was excellent - the entire family enjoyed it.  I added some chopped garlic, and doubled the broth and heavy cream.  After it was finished, I poured some cooked penne pasta in the pan.  Next time I will probably add some flour or cornstarch to the pan before the liquids so the sauce will be thicker, but otherwise it was superb!

Very good base recipe for our taste.  To make this a 5 star we would need to make a couple of changes.  First the cooking times were off for my gas stove.  We like our tenderloin medium rare which would cut the meat cooking time in half.  Also, my sun dried tomatoes and prosciutto were almost starting to burn so I would lesson that by half also.  I would add garlic and up the sun dried tomatoes.  Thanks for sharing.  I will make this again with the changes and update my review from there.

There's not many recipes that my husband suggests we cook for his parents sometime, as a matter of fact-this was only the 2nd-and we've been together 13 years...HE LOVED IT! But I just liked it-I will add cornstarch or flour next time to thicken the sauce! Thanks for sharing!

Served with noodles. Added portabello muchrooms and used Wondra Flour to thicken the sauce a bit. Going to try recipe using chicken breasts next time. Would make a good make-ahead company meal.

Like some other reviewers, the recipe as is was slightly bland and lacked enough sauce to be served with pasta.  We tried it a second time and doubled the tomatoes, pepper and sage, used 32 oz. of fat free chicken broth and 3/4 cup of fat free half and half.  Thickened with  a little flour and served over whole wheat angel hair pasta.  This made it quite tasty and very saucy...

I made this for a special dinner that I was delivering to some friends, and it was great.  I definitely used some of the tips that were given in the reviews:
1.  Sear the pork slices (but don't cook completely) in olive oil before starting the sauce, then remove the pork and set it aside.  Reduce the remaining juice back to just the oil  If you don't remove the pork and reduce the juices, you'll have the problem some people mentioned--the sauce doesn't thicken because the pork releases too much juice.
2. Add fresh basil, oregano and sliced mushrooms to the mix, as well as garlic.
3.  Saute the onions and mushroom about 5-10 minutes before adding the rest of the herbs. tomato & prosciuitto.
4.  Add about 1/2 tbsp of flour or cornstach to help thicken the sauce.
5.  When you add the pork back in so that it can finish cooking, don't add the juice that has seeped out while it was sitting.
This is really a fast, easy and delious dish.  The tips make it sound complicated, but it's not at all.  Enjoy!

I really enjoyed this recipe. I did, however, make a couple of changes based on what I had on hand. I used bacon instead of prosciutto, dried herbs instead of fresh and doubled the cream, chicken broth and tomatoes. I will definitely make again!

Made this last week since I had a bunch of tenderloins in the freezer.  This is the 4th pork tenderloin recipe I have tried on Allrecipes.  Mine and my husband's favorite is still "Marinated Pork Tenderloin" (see my review) but this was still good.  Only change I made was to use dried sage instead of fresh.  Served with "Oven Roasted Red Potatoes" off of this site which were excellent.  We actually thought the pork tasted better the next day, after it sat in the fridge and had a chance to absorb more of the flavors.  Don't know if I would make this one again, it does require a lot of chopping for a recipe that is, in our opinion, only okay.  Definitely worth a try though.

I loved it.  I think it was wonderfully seasoned.  I probably used more prosciutto.  I also added red wine to deglaze the pan prior to adding the chicken broth and cream.  I probably cooked mine down longer than the 20 minute as in the recipe.  Then I served it over Risotto, the sauce was lovely on it.  I really look forward to having this again.

This was delicious!  Fresh ingredients are the key to these flavorful, creamy, moist pork chops, so splurging for fresh herbs is worth it!

This dish is fantastic.  It smells sooo good as it's cooking and did not disappoint.  I did add garlic and additional Italian seasonings as suggested by other posters and it was just perfect.  Thanks for the post.

I was trying to find a recipe to use up the sage leftover from Thanksgiving and this worked well, except that you can definitely add more sage than it calls for.  We ended up snipping some in after the first taste.  I also used chicken tenders instead of tenderloin and it tasted great!  And a garlic addition is a must.  Served it over egg noodles, quick and delicious!

This is awesome!! There are no other words for it. I LOVED THIS! The prosciutto and cream adds a nice flavor to the pork. I also added rosa cream sauce, white wine, and extra mushrooms. I will definitely make this again.

Excellent recipe!  I recommend doubling the sauce and serving with garlic mashed potatoes, (just boil the whole garlic cloves with the potatoes), and adding fresh mushrooms to the sauce.

The kids LOVED this recipe. I chose it because of the sundried tomatoes but was disappointed because they lost their gorgeous "zing" through the cooking.  Next time (and there will be a next time), I'll add them during the last 5 minutes of the simmer...

This tastes like it is much more difficult to make than it is. Very easy and really good.  I added flour at the end to thicken the sauce, otherwise followed directions exactly. Would serve with pasta or mashed potatoes.

This recipe was out of this world.  I did make some changes.  I used Hormel Pork Tenderloin, the one that is already marinated.  Instead of sage and parcley I used italian seasoning, a fresh tomato instead of the sundried and regular milk instead of the heavy cream. Despite all of these changes it was simply superb.  I served it with caribbean rice and a green salad.   Great recipe if you are trying to impress and very simple!!!

This is really good.  It's like something you'd get at an upscale Italian restaurant.  The sage is an interesting flavor.  Unless you knew it was in there, you would probably not guess what it is.  I will definitely make it again as it was very easy to prepare.  I served it over whole wheat angel hair pasta & with a green salad.  Also pairs well with Merlot wine.  Would be a good meal for company.

Wow!  The best pork tenderloin recipe I have ever had!!  I sliced a fresh pineapple and cooked it on the grill--ladled the pork and sauce over it on the plate w/ some spinach souffle.  Incredibly flavorful.  Don't overcook that pork!!!

This recipe is absolutely delicious. I made a few changes by adding garlic and extra onion and sun dried tomatoes. Also added fresh oregano, basil and thyme. Next time will make extra sauce and serve over penne pasta.

WOW, what an amazing dinner. I do not like pork usually, but I loved this. I served it with mashed potatoes and it was fabulous. I make a dinner from scratch every night and I hear that I am a great cook, but this was by far one of the best dinners ever. After the pork was done, I added a little flour and white wine.

Very good as is, and the true genius of this recipe is how forgiving it is.  No pork? Use chicken.  No cream? Use milk or half and half.  Proscuitto, ham or bacon all work, giving different tastes.  Add asparagus or artichokes. Serve over pasta or rice.   Overall, a really good recipe that you can adapt easily.

YUMMY! I too made a few changes.  I added a red bell pepper with the garlic and onions and spices and I used bacon.  I served it over egg noodles and it was yummy!!!!

I was a little dissapointed by the presentation. Greyish flabby looking pieces of meat in watery/chunky sauce. Bleh. Did taste great though and the pork was very tender!

note: do NOT use fat free half and half! It separated into a clumpy mess.

This was great.  I needed to add a little more of the mentioned ingredients to fulfill the amount of pork I had.  Could of used a little more cream. It was great anyway and a new family favorite. Easy enough for this husband to make.

This was delicious and I'll definitely make it again.  I made a couple of changes - I didn't have prosciutto so I used some maple smoked bacon.  And I doubled the sauce, as suggested by some other reviewers.  I almost with I would have quadrupled it because it's just so darned good!  I followed someone else's suggestion to reduce the sauce a little before adding the meat back to it.  It was tender and very flavourful.

Excellent - the only change I made was to double the sauce ingredients.  The pork was tender and the sauce was colorful and delicious.  Highly recommend.

I would give this more than 5 stars if I could.  I followed the recipe as is.  The fresh herbs make this meal awesome.  I made this meal for Mother's Day last year in an Italian themed dinner.  Everyone loved it!!!!!  All the ingredients blend great together.  
I served it with mashed potatoes w/ prosciutto & parmesan (recipezaar) and sauteed vegetables in evoo & Italian seasonings (red, yellow, orange bell peppers, onion, zucchini, yellow squash).  Soup was homemade minestrone and salad.  The appetizer was smoked mozzarella bruschetta (forgot where I found the recipe)
Will definitely make again.

My husband thinks this recipe is as good as anything he has eaten in a restaurant and I tend to agree.  I may also try it with chicken.  It is great and took very little preparation.

I have to admit that I made a few changes to this one.  I added two cloves of chopped garlic, subsitiuted basil for the sage (that is what I had)and I did not slice the pork like the pic. here on the site shows.  I cut them into thin ribbon strips.  I also added about a 1/4 cup of white wine before adding the stock and cream.  I made a bit extra sauce and served it over fettuccini. My husband loves this one!

I thought this recipe was very good.  I did make some changes though.  I don't care for sage, so I substituted basil, oregano & garlic.  Added additional chicken broth & milk (didn't have cream).  At the end I thickened with cornstarch & water.  Thought this was a very good recipe, next time I think I'll try chicken instead.  Sure is worth a try, quick & easy, too.

This recipe was excellent!  Like others suggested I browned the pork on both sides but then removed them from the pan as I simmered the sauce.  I added the pork back in when the sauce was almost finished to heat it through.  The pork was so tender we could cut it with a fork.  I did not have sun dried tomatoes so I used canned plum tomatoes, I was worried about the substitution but it turned out just fine.  The only other thing I changed was that I added a small amount of white wine to the sauce as it was simmering and I used garlic salt instead of regular.  My husband LOVED it and was surprised by how tender the pork was (he usually is not a big fan of pork chops), he was disappointed that I didn't make more than one 1 1/2 pound tenderloin because he was looking for another helping but we had eaten it all.  My 11 year old son, who generally is not a big fan of red meat or pork also really liked this dish.

The sauce was pretty thin but I did add wine and probably could have cooked it more to thicken it or let it sit for a little bit but we were too impatient to wait.  It was delicious the way it was anyhow.  I definately will make this again.

I should have read the recipe more carefully.  I would NEVER cook a tenderloin, beef or pork by boiling it in a sauce. This is disgusting and a complete waste of quality meat.
I would suggest  searing the medallions of meat in a very hot saute pan and cooking until med rare. Set the meat aside and once the sauce has thickened pour it over the perfectly cooked meat.  If you boil the meat in the sauce. You will not get to enjoy the "TENDER" loin only a chewy rubber ball.

Reviews sounds great. I have a 2/12 lb. pork loin roast in freezer and was thinking about marinating it and roasting it. Make the sauce from this recipes, increasing the cream and chicken broth. Slice the roast and serve sauce poured on top of slices of pork and some kind of pasta on the side.

Creamy savory delicious!!! My husband and I both loved it and went in for seconds! I made it with al dente penne pasta and roasted baby broccoli with chopped garlic.  I added extra sun-dried tomatoes.  I also followed a previous commenter’s suggestion to add garlic to the saute with the onions & fresh herbs  (I added the garlic first and tossed it around for 30 seconds-1 min before adding everything else ).  I took previous advice to take the pork tenderloins out of the pan after the intital 10-min browning and waited for the sauce to boil and simmer a bit before adding the tenderloins back to the heat again, using a thermometer to check it’s temp until it got hot enough.  This an A plus recipe!!

Loved it! One small change I made was by accident, I miss read the recipe and cut the pork into 1+" thick medallions. They were tender and I will repeat this error.  I doubled the broth and cream for the surplus added a little sugar. This is a keeper.

This was an amazing dinner!  We loved it so much we wanted seconds and thirds!  The only things I would change to make it even better then it already is, remove the "add salt", add garlic and increase the amount of broth and cream. There wasn't alot of sauce when it was ready to serve.  Overall, this is a definate keeper!

Super easy and turned our great! I used dried herbs and added some oregano. I cooked 2 pork tenderloins so I added a whole onion, 1 cup 18% cream and 1 cup chicken broth. It made a great sauce for the pasta I served it over. Awesome!

This was fabulous! We'll be making this over again and again,  I served this over baked potatoes and a fresh garden salad.  Didn't deviate from the recipe at all! We love the sauce blend with the sun dried tomatoes as much as the tenderloin which was as tender as could be.  Thank you!

O So Deliciouso, it is a great recipe.

I used it as a basic recipe then tailored it to my tastes.

I egg washed my pork, coated it with Wondra, then fried it in the oil, and set aside in a bowl to keep warm.

Added garlic, italian seasonings, more sage, more parsley, garlic, salt, pepper.

Used chicken stock instead of broth, doubled the quantity. Used half and half, and doubled the quantity. Doubled the dried tomatoes.

I added the onions first to cook. Then the fresh sage and parsley. I then added the stock, brought it to a boil, added the warm pork, and then the cream.

This was delicious! My husband made this for my birthday. We didn't have easy access to Sun Dried Tomatoes, so we used Sun Dried Tomato Pesto and it turned out great!

This was really pretty tasty. The flavor of the sauce was very nice.  After reading the reviews I decided to make a double batch of the sauce.  Glad I did, but it was a bit too thin.  Next time I will thicken it a little more.  Also served it over penne, and next time I will use a thinner, smaller pasta.  We had the leftovers a few nights later, and I almost think it was better.  Maybe the flavors of the sauce had more time to marry.  I will make this again, it is nice to do something different with a tenderloin for a change.

This recipe was excellent. I did double the sauce added a tsp of minced garlic and it was perfect and provided just the right amount. I served it over jasmine rice. A keeper for sure.

One of the best dishes EVER! This was so tasty, it melted in my mouth. I will never stop making this! I used bacon instead of prosciutto because of cost, dried herbs (didn't have fresh), beef broth & left out the sundried tomatoes (didn't have them & don't like them). Added garlic. Thanks!

We really enjoyed this.  I had enough for 2 nights so one night served it with pasta and the next with rice.  Great flavor with a creamy, rich sauce, lots of interesting ingredients.  Will look forward to serving this to company.  Excellent dish!

Wow, that was good! Had 4 people over for a dinner party and it was completely devoured. Served with "Gourmet Mushroom Risotto" and a green salad. Would make this over and over and over again.

This is one of my new favorites. I did add garlic and omitted the prosciutto, cause I was out. I used rubbed sage instead of fresh. Next time I will make sure I have both. I served it with bow tie pasta and lots of fresh parsley.

I have made this recipe for my family and for guests on several occassions, and this is one of our favorite dinners.  I didn't change a thing about the recipe except that I doubled the ingredients for the sauce so that we would have enough to pour over rice or noodles.  I am often guilty of preparing overcooked, tough pork.  But, this recipe really helped me to prepare a tender, flavorful pork dish.

This is a wonderful recipe!  The prosciutto / sun-dried tomato mixture was excellent; however, I will reduce the amount of sage next time to make the mixture less 'salty'.  Since I'm a visual type of man, this recipe goes well with scalloped, garlic potatoes and steamed green beans or carrots as side dishes.  Very colorful!

I have made this dish 5 times, and it is always a big hit.  Last night I served it for a party of 20 (adults and children) and they all loved it.  I changed the servings from 4 to 20, I loved that it was all calculated for me.  The only change that I made was to add a little bit of garlic.  I have served it over rice and pasta and both are great options.  I received rave reviews from everyone.  I used 7.5 pounds of pork tenderloin, and I was amazed that it all was gobbled up.  Yummmy.

This is decent. I'll probably try it again and update my rating when I do. Didn’t have fresh sage so used ¼ tsp. rubbed sage (scaled to 2 servings).

I used dried herbs, half and half, and served it over couscous.    I forgot to double the herbs and tomatoes when doubling the sauce, so it was a little bland, but otherwise, it was great!!

This recipe was absolutely delicious!  I very rarely cook pork, but this was a hit with my boyfriend and I.  I did make a few changes based on the reviews here, though.  I browned the pork in a skillet first, then set it to the side.   I then made the sauce (thankfully, I doubled it as suggested.)  I didn't have any of the herbs suggested, so I just used 2 tablespoons of Italian Seasoning and some fresh garlic.  I also omitted the salt because it was salty enough thanks to the prosciutto.  While the sauce was simmering, I added the cooked pork to heat it back up.  The sauce was so yummy... I served it  over mashed potatoes and with a side of peas.  I will definitely be making this one again.

This is a terrific recipe.  The pork was so tender, and the sauce was very flavorful.  I did use fat free half and half to make it healthier, so I had to thicken the sauce with a little cornstarch.  Even with this change, it was still delicious.

We thought this recipe was great. The only change I made was to add cooked pasta to the finished dish. Why waste great sauce? Actually next time I will double all ingredients (except for the pork) and have even more to enjoy.

Easy and delicious.  We could not find oil packed sundried tomatoes.  We used the sundried in a package and soaked them in olive oil.  We plan to add mushrooms and white wine next time.

My daughter (15 yrs old), who is a picky eater, loved this recipe.  I didn't think it was that good, although I had a cold that affected my taste and I also had to substitute some items.  I couldn't get the fresh sage, parsley, or oil-packed sun-dried tomatoes at my local grocery store so I had to use the bought bottle kind.  The tomatoes I used were just dried.  I had more tenderloin than it called for so I increased the cream and broth by 1/4 cup.  I had never had prosciutto and it was very expensive here (WV).  It almosted tasted like country ham to me!  I certainly enjoyed cooking it and seeing all those beautiful colors!

This was very good, pretty easy to make, and the pork was wonderfully tender.  Per other reviews, I added garlic and served over pasta.  The garlic worked well but the pasta didn't -- too little sauce and too thin.  Next time I'll serve with orzo or pilaf.  And there will be a NEXT time!

this was a good recipe .  I used white wine as suggested by someonelse instead of the heavy cream and then added flour to make a gravy.  It did not taste WOW piping hot but letting it stand for about 35 minutes before serving made this a great recipe.

I know it changes the point of the dish, but I did not use the sun dried tomatoes or fresh herbs.  Instead I used poultry seasoning.  I also prefer mushrooms to onions in this dish and seasoned the pork with a little seasoning salt while it browns.  But, it is SO good.  I have made this several times and we always eat every bite!

It was just alright.  I probably won't make it again.  I liked it the more I ate it but it wasn't a WOW for me or my family.

I have made this now several times and change it just a bit each time.  I do not put the prosciutto in it at all.  I add some garlic for a bit of taste and follow the rest of the recipe just as written.  I do double the sauce as we love it over some rice or mashed potatoes.  I think this is a great recipe to have on hand when you have tenderloin pork .

Letting it sit for 15 mins or so after it’s done allows the flavors the blend and overall has an enhanced taste.

I added garlic, used bacon instead of prosciutto. I also added 8 ounces of chicken bone broth and a quart of heavy cream at the same time as some whole grain penne. Let that all cook together and you have pasta with this meal.

I made this last week. THe only change was I used bacon instead of prosciutto simply because that is what I had, and I added garlic. We thought is was delicious. My teenage boy came home late for dinner and ate all the leftovers! Easily two helpings. We served it with wild rice and like that combo. Will try with pasta next time. Also anxious to try with prosciutto and get a slightly more salty taste.

I made this a little bit healthier by using skim milk and half of the olive oil. Regardless, it still tasted absolutely incredible! I love this recipe and will definitely be using it several yes over in my home!

This was absolutely delicious, enough so that I had to make that sauce again. I ended up adding in mushrooms and garlic as well as swapping out my pork for chicken breast on my second run through and my god was it fantastic! Tho this does not make enough sauce to cover noodles like I had hoped it would be when I first made it, so my second run also had me doubling the sauce recipe.

I basically made this into Pork Stroganoff. I used bacon and browned it, the onions and pork. I left everything in the sauté pan, added chicken stock, heavy cream and cooked until the pork was done and the sauce thickened somewhat. Finally I added about a cup of sour cream to finish and served over egg noodles.

Pretty  awesome. 

I did a taste test right before completion, and as someone stated, the sauce was a little too thin and needed a bit more umph. So I added a tablespoon of fresh minced garlic, a teaspoon or so of garlic powder, two tablespoons of butter and half a table spoon of corn starch which thickened it up perfectly. 

GREAT recipe, out of the box. Just needed a little twist for my own taste buds. 

THANK YOU!

Made this dish completely following the recipe.  The smells were amazing; however, the dish didn’t deliver a lot of flavor.  Too bland and plain for my taste.

Delicious!  Changed the recipe slightly based on what I had on hand—used a few tablespoons of shallots rather than onion; didn’t have quite enough fresh sage so added chopped fresh rosemary and thyme but no more than a teaspoon total; like a few other reviewers, added a small amount of chopped garlic;  I didn’t have sun dried tomatoes in oil but did have a sun dried tomato pesto, which was nice as it required no chopping.  Rather than braising the pork tenderloin in the sauce, initially roasted the tenderloin (rubbed in a mixture of chopped rosemary, chopped garlic, salt and pepper, olive oil.) at 425 for 20:minutes.  Served the sliced roasted pork  tenderloin topped with this wonderful sauce.  Rather than pasta, side was haricot vert with  sautéed chopped mortadella, a Julia Child recipe. Will definitely make this recipe again.  The sauce would be great with pasta or chicken.  Can’t wait!

I had extra cooked tenderloins that I wanted to use and this recipe looked like it could be a standout. I had to make several adjustments as I did not have all the ingredients on hand. Like others, I substituted on bacon instead of ham. I only had ground dried sage and frozen parsley. To top it off, I had no cream, so I just made a white sauce.  I added the sliced tenderloin to the mixture at the end and let it simmer on low heat until it had fully warmed up.

I have this recipe twice because my husband likes it so much. The first time I pretty much followed the recipe. The second time, I used substitutes as I didn’t have all the ingredients. I substituted bacon for prosciutto and a half can of diced tomatoes for the sun dried. I added minced garlic to the sauté and doubled the chicken stock and cream. Added some dried oregano and red pepper flakes for some pizzazz and finished sauce with a little arrowroot for thickening. Served over egg noodles. Thanks for a great springboard of a recipe!

This is so flavorful and smells wonderful while cooking.  A few additions I've tried is about 4 oz of sliced mushrooms added at the beginning, 1/4 tsp oregano, and a Tbsp of sour cream added with the broth.    Also, you can increase the broth and cream to 3/4 cup each for more sauce to serve over flat noodles.  Might need to add a tsp of cornstarch at the end to thicken if you care.

It was delicious. I had to use bacon and dry herbs but I can’t wait to try it with fresh herbs. I also used a lot more sun dried tomatoes. It’s a great low carb/Keto meal. For rest of family, I served it ver egg noodles.

This was very tasty and not overwhelming. The next time I make it, the broth will likely be omitted. The sauce did not thicken up at all. I poured the dish onto rice to preserve flavor and enable it to be eaten with a fork. Kiddos complained about dryness and ate around rice.

My husband absolutely loves this recipe! The only change I made is to add a touch of garlic and I slice the pork tenderloin which is then browned in the same pan which I first sautéed the prosciutto, onions, sun dried tomatoes, etc.  I remove to pan prior to browning the pork. After the pork is browned I again remove to plate and then add the broth to the same pan, scrap up all the browned bits from browning the pork then slowly add the cream(also works fine with half and half) and prosciutto, tomato, onion concoction back in bring to very slight boil and as it thickens readd the pork and cover and lower  the heat (to low) In 10 to 15 minutes it’s done and we gobble it down along with some rice and usually steamed broccoli. Very very yummy!

The dish was awesome!!! My whole family loved it, even my pickiest eaters. I made  just a few modifications. I added bacon vs prosciutto and vegetable broth vs chicken broth, only because I had those on hand. I also sautéed fresh mushrooms and garlic and added them to the dish. Other than that, I followed the directions provided. Thanks for the recipe. I will definitely be making this again.

The second time I made this, I seared the pork first, and then took it out of the pan.  I sautés the onions, tomatoes, etc, in the same, unwashed pan, and then added then pork back in with the cream and the broth to simmer.  The pork stayed much more tender, and it didn’t sacrifice any of the flavor.  Also try over diced portobello mushrooms!

Love it!  Didn't use prosciutto (too salty for me) - added mushrooms instead and sauteed with onions, garlic and 1/4 cup of white wine.  Used 1/2 teaspoon of dried basil, oregano, parsley.   Added tablespoon of flour to help thicken sauce and used half and half instead of heavy cream.

This dish is fabulous! My only ingredient change was pancetta instead of prosciutto. I rendered the pancetta, pulled it out, browned the pork, pulled that out, then sautéed onions. Everything went in the pan, except the pork, and when the sauce was finished, I put the pork back in to heat back up. 
Now I can’t say whether my swap made it better or worse, but it sure was delicious!

I made the following changes-

1. The pork: I presalted the meat the night before. On the day, I cut it into medallions, rubbed dried sage and rolled them in flour and pepper. I also didnt use any prosciutto.

2. I changed the order & cooking time: I seared the pork in the pan first, just to get a crusty skin. I remove them while they are still raw and turn off the heat. I used the residual heat to fry the onions and herbs so as not to brown them, added the garlic and tomatoes (turn on the heat again), then the stock and then put the meat back. I put the cream in and simmered covered for around 30. I put a bit of cornstarch slurry and continued to cook for 10 mins.

3. The herbs: I added garlic and used indian borage/mexican mint as I didnt have any fresh parsley or sage.

4. The sauce: I didnt have any chicken stock, so I used a beef boullion cube. I used dehydrated sun dried tomatoes and added the water used to rehydrate them to the stock. I also added flour and cornstarch to thicken the sauce. I also changed the ratio - 2 cups stock to 1 cup cream.

I added some chopped kale for extra nutrition. I served it both with mashed potatoes and crunchy focaccia. I recommend the focaccia and make it with a lot of sauce.

It was good. But I think the beef boullion dominated the flavor too much, so next time I will use chicken boullion. I will also simmer for longer to make the meat more tender.

This was absolutely delicious! Full of flavor, rich and the meat was very tender. I made it exactly as written except I did add a couple of cloves of garlic, just because everything is better with garlic! I also doubled the sauce, which I would definitely recommend. Next time I will probably not add the salt as it was a little too salty. I will also try half and half or milk to try and cut calories. All 3 kids loved it, thank you Annacoyne!

Delicious! Got rave reviews from the whole family. Next time I would sauté the pork with some rosemary, and possibly with some sliced crimini mushrooms.

Like many others, I cooked the pork for 8-10 min. removed, adding back at end to heat through.  I also had zucchini on hand so added 1/4 cup.  Plus punched it up a bit with some Penzeys Mural of Flavor spice.  Now a new fav for company!

I made this for the Italian side of my family during their recent visit. I give it five stars because we all found this to be a delicious meal. I served the recipe of cooked egg noodles. I had forgotten to pick up the prosciutto at the store, but I had ham on hand and used that instead. The sauce was thinner than I anticipated or would have liked. I did cover the dish while simmering, so that may have been a factor. I will definitely make this dish again.  I may serve it over zoodles (zucchini noodles) next time  to stay on my low-carb diet.

Doubled sauce, cooked pork 6 minutes and removed while sauce thickened, then added back in for a few minutes to reheat. Added garlic, fresh basil and oregano. Substituted FF 1/2 and 1/2 for cream. Thickened with 2 T cornstarch. Served over yellow rice. Excellent!

This was delicious! I, too, added basil and garlic and a smidge of sugar, added some red pepper flakes for a bit of punch. I was slightly short on broth, added enough vodka (!) to make a half cup, OMG. To die for!

We REALLY enjoyed this dish.  I don't see why anyone could say it doesn't have enough flavor.  Although, I made only one very small adjustment.  Like others, I enjoy garlic with any Italian meal.  So, I minced two cloves of garlic, and added them along with the chicken broth and cream.  It permeated the sauce so nicely, but wasnt a standout garlicky meal, just a nice subtle hint.

A great dish served over egg noodles!  With leftovers too!!  YUM!

This was delicious!  I sautéed the pork first and took it out and cooked everything else.  Added pork back in as the sauce was almost done simmering. The sun dried tomatoes were a huge hit in the recipe. I will add more the next time. The leftovers were great too.

Absolutely one of my most favorite recipes on this website.  It was so incredibly tasty. You MUST use fresh herbs. We doubled the recipe and I should have tripled the sauce. By the time it reduces you just don't have enough for left overs. And the sauce is scrumptiously amazing.

This will be a Sunday night staple for sure!

Love it. Recommend reducing the broth and cream in a separate sauce pan to avoid overcooking the pork.

Excellent! As others suggested, cut medallions about 1 1/2 inches thick, browned about 5 minutes, and simmered for about 10 minutes. We like ours pink in the center and the pork was slightly overdone for our tastes. Used cornstarch to thicken slightly and added oregano, basil, garlic, and Pecorino Romano.

Terrific recipe. I followed the recipe except for a minor change. I subbed evaporated milk for the heavy cream. I only used the 1/2 c that the recipe called for.  Next time I’ll Use the whole can because I’d like more sauce. (It was so tasty.) A reviewer suggested a flour and water slurry to thicken. I did and won’t do it again. It didn’t need thickening. Added a pinch of tarragon since someone suggested tarragon vinegar. It reheated well. Added more tomatoes to finish off the jar I had. I’ll definitely make this again. Easy to prepare and delicious!

I thought this was pretty good.  The sauce is delicious!  Next time I am not going to cut the pork tenderloin in strips.  I am going to cut into medallions and sear them, move off and then make the sauce.  Thicken sauce and then pour over medallions.

Great recipe and appreciated the comments. I also added lots of mushrooms browned by themselves and added in near the end.  I browned the pork tenderloin strips by themselves and added it all to the sauce at the end and simmered only for a couple of minutes so the meat was not over cooked. Like another cook, I used half and half and thickened the broth and cream with a little flour.  Added garlic scrapes from my garden to the onion etc. at the beginning.  Added way more dried tomatoes than recipe called for. Wonderful flavor to this dish!

I have made this recipe many times and it is one of my favourites.  The only change I make is to increase the chicken broth and cream to 3/4 of a cup each.  I also often use half and half  instead of heavy cream to cut down on the calories and it is just as good.

Yes! Everyone cleaned their plate, dish was served over long grain white rice, pork slices kept small makes it more manageable on plate while eating. Doesn't hurt to table the hot sauces for this one! Let them spice it up if they want. We'll return to this again!

Added shitaki mushrooms, used pancetta instead of prociutto.  Very good recipe.

Very easy to make. My wife doesn't like sundried tomatoes so I subbed roasted red peppers from a jar and it was delicious. They pretty much melted into the sauce.  New approach to pork. Would be delicious on top of pasta....just an idea.

Excellent. All  the Engels ate this. Served with rice. Made more sauce and thickened with flour.  Used Classico  sun dried tomato pesto in place of tomatoes in oil.  Also used bacon in place of prosciutto. Need to cook more tenderloin. Cook three next time.

No sage but used a bit of sage powder. Added a couple three cloves of garlic. A splash of white wine. At the end I added some flour to the existing broth to thicken it a bit. Went very nicely with the 'lemon spaghetti' I made along with it. Tastes better the second day around.

Read another review and opted to add garlic. Also, after browning meat, set aside while sauce reduced. Added meat back in toward end. Delicious, got the thumbs up among diners.

I agree completely with LIBBYHAB. Adding garlic is a good idea, and don't overcook, the tenderloin will cook fully during the saute phase. You can hold it after the thickening phase and then reheat with the meat, making it a great dinner party dish. Using fresh sage with the prosciutto and sundried tomatoes makes for authentic and wonderful flavors. A winner!

I quadrupled the recipe and did it in 2 pans and then combined for a large crowd. I sliced the pork in rounds and seared/browned on both sides to keep in juices. This is really important to keep pork tender as it will take time for the sauce to thicken. Everyone loved it. Pork was very tender. Only added garlic as per other reviews but not sure it made much of a difference. Served with egg noodles and asparagus on the side - but would have been good as well with rice or potatoes. Will definitely make again.

Beautiful over linguini!  After reading several reviews, I adjusted some seasonings.  I only used dried herbs, 1/2 teaspoon of: basil, oregano, sage and parsley.  I  doubled the sundried tomatoes and added 2 cloves of minced garlic.  I fried the pork until almost done and removed from the skillet.  After preparing the sauce, I returned the pork to the skillet just before serving.  The only change I would make next time is adding more garlic.  Thanks for another fabulous recipe!

I would definitely make this again, but not cook it as long in the final simmar.  The pork was a bit dry so I'd probably simmer for 15-20 minutes and maybe help the thickening process along by putting a little cornstarch in the mix.  VERY flavorful, very good!

The sauce was amazing. However, next time I will cook the meat first and set it aside. I found the meat over cooked, it was really dry. Next time, after I set aside the meat, I will incorporate it at the end. But the family still loved it even though it was over cooked.

It was edible but probably would not make it again. I did not have fresh herbs however. Didn't care for sage taste. Should also have added garlic and it may have made some difference. I expected much more flavor. I would not call this Italian.

This recipe is very simple and very delicious. I added garlic, as suggested, and doubled the sauce. Served over mashed potatoes for myself and Hubby, over noodles for the children. One of my picky eaters asked for seconds, and thirds as well; and to make my heart even prouder he put some extra sauce on his noodles- he's generally an avid sauce hater! An added bonus- this meal was very budget- friendly. I will definitely be making this again.

Followed some of the reviews and added fat free half and half, garlic (a must in any italian dish), mushrooms and extra sun-dried tomatoes which I thought were good suggestions.  Cut tenderloin in strips but next time I'd cut into slices and cover in searing flour to brown.  Liked the flavors of fresh sage and parsley.  Served w roasted butternut squash.  Trying to cut out carbs so skipped the pasta but think I'd serve with a little bit next time.  Also added little cornstarch/water mixture to thicken sauce a bit.  Doubled the amount of broth/cream which would have been good if had the pasta

I only gave this four stars because I did make some changes based on other reviews. I cut the tenderloin into one inch medallions, seasoned with salt and pepper and pan seared. After removing the tenderloins, I added four ounces chopped pancetta and cooked for about two minutes. I then added the onion and continued cooking until softened. Next I added the sage, parsley, and some chopped garlic. After cooking for a minute or two, I added the tomatoes. After another one to two minutes, I added one cup of chicken broth and one cup of cream. I allowed that to reduce and then added the pork back in to finish cooking.  Served with pasta.

Five-star recipe!  The sauce is divine.  My deviations were to add a bit of garlic and oregano to the sautee, and I did pour a bit of red wine in with the broth.  My husband I and both commented that this would be even better with chicken.  Some of the pork tenderloin was tough, but that's certainly no fault of the recipe.  When buying a tenderloin, you never know what you're going to get.  Thanks for a fabulous recipe!

Used this recipe as guide, because I changed things. Even if you don't change a thing, I'm sure it would be fabulous!  I used 1 cup La Crema Sonoma Coast Chardonnay as a substitute for the chicken stock, then added 2 tblsp. chopped basil and and 2 tblsp. of  Mezzetta capers, and omitting the salt, and let the sauce simmer for 15 minutes before finishing the dish with 3 tblsp 50/50 roux to thicken for about 5 minutes, then served with Black Forest style Spaeizel (German Egg Pasta), sprinkled with freshly grated parmesan. Finished off the bottle of Chardonnay, to complement the meal.  The creamy sauce is light and flavorful, the pork tender and juicy, and the capers made an excellent substitution for the salt

I made this with uncooked tenderloin and served over a bed of rice.  it was delicious and I loved the safe flavor.  The sauce consistency wasn't thick enough for my liking but I am new to this "trying new recipes" cooking thing so I probably did something wrong. I'm sure we will eat this again.

Yummy! This was a great case recipe. I had to change it because of lack of ingredients... substituted roasted red peppers for sun dried tomatoes and fresh rosemary for fresh sage. I also added a little minced garlic. Otherwise made it as written and thickened the sauce with some corn starch. Served it with mashed potatoes and green beans. Got a thumbs up from my picky-eater 16 yo daughter with a request to make it again sometime. Completely gone between 4 teens and myself.

Excellent recipe. I added fresh garlic and sliced mushrooms. Used dry herbs as I didn't have time to pick any up. Either way, dish was a winner in our house! Thanks for sharing it!!!

I looked for a recipe to use up some prosciutto we had left over from making Proscuitto Wrapped Asparagus (yum!) and found this.  We had to use dried herbs so it needed a bit more moisture.  Since very few Italian recipes don't have red wine, we added 1/2 cup towards the end of browning.  A very easy recipe, and very quickly ready.  We served it over a savoury brown rice and fresh carrots.  Yum!

I made this recipe with no changes. We like the flavors but when I make it again, I will roast the tenderloin whole and keep the sauce separate, and double the ingredients.

This was the most wonderful tasting dish we have had in a long time and so easy to make!  The fresh herbs make all the difference in the world.    I used a spicy prosciuttino instead of prosciutto as we like a little bite to our foods and to cut calories a little, I used 1/2 and 1/2 instead of whole cream and served it over cauliflower mash...another recipe from Allrecipes!  Thank you so much for sharing!

Just AWSOME, the only thing I did not put are the roasted tomatoes, not a fanatic of it, and I did have to take the meat out to add flour to get it creamy, but it is my fault I use a frozen tenderloin, I should have drained the water after  it was cooked. But soooo yummmmy

Great recipe.  I used reduced sodium broth, and my husband still found it a little on the salty side, so I will not add the salt next time.  I've made just the sauce (without the proscuito) for pasta, and it's a keeper!  Also - you can add way more sun dried tomatoes....and some spinach.

Love the idea of adding garlic (I thought it was odd not to) and more fresh herbs.  And mushrooms!  Yes - that would be fantastic!!

Excellent!!  I totally agree with the recommendation for fresh herbs and double the sauce. I also used low salt chicken broth to offset the salt in the prosciutto.  Excellent, will keep as a favorite!

This recipe is awesome - all of us had seconds.  I followed some other reviewers advice and made medallions,pounded them slightly and dredged in flour with pepper.  Don't use any salt because the prosciutto gives off just the right amount.  I didn't use sage because it didn't seem like a good fit.  This is a keeper, thanks

The dish turned out excellent and I  made this for my wife and the in laws (they all loved it).  I took some of the modifications that others had written and it helped round out the dish.  I added two cloves of garlic, basil and oregano.  After I cooked the pork in the first go around of the recipe and cooked the sauce by itself.  I doubled the sauce ingredients and added a handful of flour to help thicken it.  Once it started to evaporate off I then added the pork back in and covered.  Served it over penne pasta

I came across this recipe and decided to try it using thinly sliced pieces of chicken breast. I used basil and garlic as some others suggested. Served it over thin spaghetti sprinkled with parmesan cheese and bacon. My husband and I both had seconds. Definitely adding this to the rotation. Easy too!

This was awesome. My husband and two teenage boys loved it!  The only thing I did different was pound my boneless pork loin chops to make them like cutlets and added 4 cloves of garlic minced.  Will make this again many times.

So tasty! My husband made this for dinner and I loved it. The sauce has a rich taste. The sundried tomatoes make it kind of tangy and next time I would serve it with pasta. Will have to make this again.

Omg, I just finished the dishes and can't wait to say how delicious this dish is.  I forgot to pick parsley, so I ran without it, and a had a little tomato sauce left over from pizza the other  night so stirred a little into the sauce, just a few tables spoons to pink up the sauce.  I was licking the plate clean soooo good and very adaptable!  I served it with angel hair pasta mmmm mmm good

I doubled the amount of sauce and served with mashed potatoes.  I thought it was very good, but hubby kept adding salt and pepper to his plate.  We both finished off rather large portions,  so it must have been pretty good.    Next time I will add more Italian species, basil and oregano (and salt and pepper), and serve as a pasta sauce to see if I can please both hubby and me.

Excellent!! This is my go-to recipe when I want to impress, but want something easy. I am not a huge fan of pork, but this recipe is mouth-watering!

When I made this pork the other night, I had an incident with the first batch(I will spare you the details), so the final product was slightly different than the recipe called for.  However, it turned out well and I would make it again.  Here is what I ended up doing: cut the pork into medallions and cook them 4-5 mins per side in the olive oil.  Set aside the pork and cover to keep warm.  Add ham (my husband suggests trying bacon instead!), 1/2 tbsp dried sage, 1tbsp dried parsley, tomatoes, and a dash of onion powder.  Let cook for a few minutes.  Add chicken broth, cream (I used half and half), salt, and pepper.  Put pork back in skillet to coat with sauce and warm through.

Made this recipe just as the recipe states. Used sliced pork medallions as one reviewer suggested, but simmered all for the 15-20 minutes. It was very good. The pork was tender and flavorful. Served with "Gormet Risotto" and "bread maker Foccacia". It made a very nice meal. Thank you for sharing the recipe!

Doubled recipe for a dinner party, and it was a big hit, including 1 comment that it was the best pork they ever tasted.  Made a couple modifications.  Added about 3/4 cup shiitake mushrooms.  Soaked pork in brine solution around 6 hrs before cooking, brine flavored with herbes de provence.  Pork came out very tender and moist.  Made extra sauce by doing 2 cups each broth and cream instead of 1.5, which makes it go a longer way if served with pasta or rice and doesn't waste the remaining 1/2 c of cream that I probably wouldn't use otherwise.

So this will now be a staple in our house!  I used more prosciutto, more sage, more parsley, more sun dried tomatoes (like 3-4 tbsp each) and no salt (the prosciutto does it all).  We wanted to lick the plate it was so good!  The flavors just burst forward and make a very tasty, easy dinner.  As I say, we'll be doing this recipe again and again!
