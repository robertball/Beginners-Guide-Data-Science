Very good - very easy!  Made it last week for a holiday gathering, and will be making it again this week for another party.  I added 5-6 drops of bottled hot pepper sauce rather than the ground red pepper.  After shaping the dip into a wreath on a holiday platter, I took very thin red bell pepper strips and made a pretty bow and also used the red bell pepper for little berries, and used the suggested parsley as holly leaves.

Good flavor and beautiful appearance.  The chopped red pepper makes it a pretty pale pink or salmon color, which looked great with the chopped parsley.  I plan to make this again next Christmas.

Attractive looking for our Christmas Eve get together. Made enough for 20 or 30 people, much more than we needed. Taste was a little flat - needs more of something. Pehaps some hot pepper sauce, or more worcestershire or horseradish or something!

We love to make this to go with the pita chip recipe from this site.  I increase the amount of red bell pepper quite a big, sometimes I omit the onions (depending who I'm making it for) and increase the Worcestershire sauce and red pepper for a little extra flavor!  This is a favorite!

This is a very tasty cheese dip.  I used green and red peppers and it made it look very festive!  I will use more peppers next time--the added crunch was really good.
