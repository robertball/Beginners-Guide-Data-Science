Pro-tip: If you want to eat the blossoms and have zucchinis, use the extra male blossoms you have on the plants to make these! Just pick the ones without the little fruits on the bottom!

I thought this recipe was a little boring and bland; If I'm going to eat a great ingredient like zucchini blossoms, I want a little pizazz from the recipe!  I added tomatoes and basil to the top and that helped.  If I were to make this again, I would add herbs to the bread crumbs and some veggies to the blossoms to give it more taste.

I went to a local farm where they clipped the blossoms fresh for me.  When my husband looked in my brown bag and saw what I was making for dinner he was skeptical at best.  He's not a big zucchini fan, never mind eating flower blossoms.  When he saw the finished product I told him to just pop one into his mouth...and he did. And he kept popping! He loved these and couldn't stop talking about them.  It was an easy recipe and I can't recommend it enough.

First time to ever make these and also my first time to eat them! I made both recipes on this site and these were good although I did prefer the crispy zuchinni blossums a little better. I used blossoms from my garden using both pumpkin and zucchini . I did not change anything from the recipe and it turned out great .

These were really good and worth the effort of going to 3 different grocery stores to find zucchini blossoms. The feta add a great flavor. Gotta remember to keep the oil hot enough so they fry up quickly without the feta melting too fast.

The zucchini blossoms were hard to find, but were definitely well worth it! I doubled the amount, and saved the rest...they make a delicious snack dipped in ranch or Greek dressing. The feta makes this dish, I think, and these will probably be popular with a crowd. Will be making these again!

Yummy.  I had crumbled feta, so I just added a little bit of the egg to hold it together.  Very good.  I also used fresh bread crumbs, and after I was done frying the blossoms, I added the remaining fresh bread crumbs and fried them up golden as a topping for another dish.  I will definetely do this again!

This was good as is. Next time I think I will use fresh bread crumbs seasoned with Italian Seasoning.

YUMMY! I love the edible flowers of the Zucchini plants! I picked mine fresh from my vegetable garden.  I love the little piece of cheese inside of them.  It gives it a twist! Kids really like these as well. Great recipe. THX

Very tasty. I added some basil and oregano to the breadcrumbs and used crumbled feta in the blossoms. I just gave them a little twist to stay together.

I recently had these for the first time at a fancy Italian restaurant. They were delicious. I was very excited to try these, but sadly they didn't turn out the same as I expected. Everything was great, but the breadcrumbs were so heavy, it really weighed down the whole dish. Next time I think I might use a tempura batter, or just seasoned flour so it will be lighter and let the zucchini shine through. I made this as a side to serve with spaghetti and the sauce added a nice kick. I also used some goat cheese when I ran out of feta. Very tasty. Only complaint was the heaviness of my breadcrumbs!
