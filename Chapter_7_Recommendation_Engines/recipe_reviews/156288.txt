I made these for our Superbowl party and had way too many left over.  I was disappointed in this recipe.  While the taste was strong, it wasn't the best.  I love Dijon mustard and ranch flavor, but the two together just didn't mesh.  I expected the sauce to bake onto the wings, but it just slid off and made a soupy mess.  No one would eat them as leftovers, so I ended up picking the meat off the bones and making chicken salad as not to waste them.  I will not be making these again.

I made these for the super bowl.  I let them marinate for a few hours and the flavor was great -  even in the meat, since I don't eat the skin.  Loved these!

I've been looking for a wing recipe that is not deep fried. This one is awesome. Who would have though ranch dressing would be the hidden secret to big flavor? These were also super easy to make.  I might try this same recipe to make chicken strips for the kids.  Go Patriots!

Well, this is hard to explain.  I kinda liked the flavor, but they were not a big hit with friends and family.  The flavor was way too strong for our liking.  But if you like Mustard then you should love this recipe.  Sorry...

I wanted a close to fat free version of this recipe, so I substituted boneless skinless chicken tenders.  THEY WERE AMAZING!!!  Even the kids loved them!

I usually make wings on the grill, but when the weather didn't cooperate, I tried these.  They had a great flavor and were a nice change from hot wings.  I cooked them a little longer than what was suggested and they were very tender.

The kids liked this one and I was pleasently surprised! I only had dijon mild and creamy mustard on hand and it gave the wings a mild flavor.  I will definitly be making these again ~ little fuss and very tasty! I will try some different spices on them next time however.

These wings are FANTASTIC! A nice change from Buffalo wings...and these were super easy to make, no deep frying needed. I gave them about 7 minutes on broil once they were done cooking just to brown/crisp them up a bit...they came out perfect! Thanks, this is definately a keeper.
