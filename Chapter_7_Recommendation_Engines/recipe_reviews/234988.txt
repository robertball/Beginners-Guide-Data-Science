This is a great base recipe for any chia jam you might want to make! I used strawberries and rhubarb! Oh my goodness, it turned out so well!

Love this! I made these adjustments per what I had available; agave instead of honey and costco's frozen "nature's 3 berries" and their frozen strawberries. Came out great!

Great recipe. To much honey for my taste though. Will add a tad less next time.

I blended cooked fruit with vita mix and added white sugar. Turned out great!  Next up: blue grapes from ontario...I think it'll taste like concord grape jam.

Very good alternative to regular jam; no pectin and uses way less sugar.  Definitely a healthier jam.

So delicious and tastes so healthy! I had enough honey for what the recipe called for but found it a little too tart so then added some real maple syrup to taste. I also used fresh strawberries because they are currently in season. Thank you for such an amazing recipe. I won't buy store bought jam again because I now know that the natural thickened state of chia seeds make a perfect jam packed with nutrition.

I love jam  but they are usually made with so much white sugar. This recipe is great and easy. Thanks  for sharing!
