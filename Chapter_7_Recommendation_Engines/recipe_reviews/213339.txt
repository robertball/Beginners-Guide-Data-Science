Made this recipe for a St. Patrick's Day party and the family loved it! The only change I made was adding one clove of garlic to the mash. :-) Good the next day too.

I increased the milk/butter just a touch and I threw in a half pound of crumbled crisp bacon. Comfort food at it's best. I made Guinness Corned Beef to go with it. Excellent meal.

Caulcannon was a regular dish in my house when I was growing up in Canada, but my Irish mother also added other root vegetables such as carrots, turnip and rutabaga.  It's a great way to get kids to eat vegetables.  My kids loved it and now make it in their own homes. We also don't use any milk products only butter and salt and pepper.

This was wonderful! All three of my children LOVED it, including the baby! I did add the bacon AND colby cheese for a little extra flavor, but it definitely didn't need flavor. I will make this our new favorite cabbage recipe and will also make it every St. Patty's day week. Thank you for sharing this recipe!

I was told no Corned Beef on St. Patrick's Day but the Irish in me wanted to do something festive. I found this recipe and it was delicious! I only made half of the recommended serving amount and prepared it as a side dish. I did not use half-and-half but just added a little bit of milk at the end as well as a spoon full of sour cream. I also added crumbled bacon. It was perfect and a HUGE hit with my picky family!!!!

Good recipe, we save half the raw onions and add them after cooking the way my Nana did to give it a little more bite, and my kids like it with beef gravy on the side.  My mum used to call this Irish welfare food, it's what they ate when there was no money for meat...real traditional St Pats food.

Wow.  Good colcannon!  The half-half makes it ultra creamy!    I made a few adjustments for my subsequent meals.  Chicken broth and 1 TB of butter instead of cream and 1/4 cup butter.  I am trying to watch the hips, and it still tastes as good!  I dash some nutmeg on it to, which is a great flavor with this dish.

Yum! The addition of cabbage to regular mashed potatoes made for an extra hearty, buttery flavor. I made some minor subs based on what I had on hand - shallots instead of green onions, and 1% milk instead of half-and-half, but it was still great. Perfect for a snowy winter evening.

I doubled this recipe and I still had to keep my family from eating the whole thing and not leaving any for the next day's lunch. This is the real stuff, very rich and tasty. I used a hand mixer (rather than a fork) because of the quantity and it worked just fine.

Just made this and it came out delish.  I didn't peel the potatoes.  I used a stick of butter and half a cup of whole milk.  I also threw in a few chicken bouillon cubes to add some flavor.  The hubs loved it, and it was a nice change for St. Patty's day.

Kind of bland but then Colcannon is that way.  It's meant as a neutral side to a meat entree.  That said, I don't like cheese or bacon mixed into the dish.

I used cabbage from some left over corn beef and cabbage my dad had made (I think it really gave it a lot of flavor). Thank you for a delicious recipe.

This recipe is pretty amazing. After living in London for half a year, this really brought my memories back full force. As with most UK food, it needed a lot of salt and pepper, but tasted great on it's own, and with some shredded cheddar.

I doubled the potatoes and onions for the recipe, added about 3/4 of a diced rutabaga that I had and one small bag of shredded coleslaw mix I had.  After cooking and hand mashing I added 1/4 cup of butter, ~1/4 cup fat free half, celtic sea salt to taste, 6 strips of cooked turkey bacon and ~1/4 cup shredded cheddar cheese.  I'm glad I doubled the potatoes or we wouldn't have any leftovers for lunch tomorrow!

It was okay, but the cabbage flavor sort of disappeared in the potatoes, yet the potatoes "weren't quite right" either.  It did make great potato patties though.

I just made this last night and found it super easy and really good! The textures together are really good! It did require a lot of salt but I didn't add bacon or cheese, just made it exact to what the recipe called for! It's a great and easy twist to boring mash potatoes. :) Thanks for sharing!

I made this for St. Patrick's Day.   It needed more seasoning; I added more salt and pepper and some caraway seeds.  I had lots of leftovers (there are only three of us) so today I took it out, added some crumbled bacon and fresh chopped dill.   I put it in a casserole dish and sprinkled cheddar cheese.  It's in the oven at 300 degrees because we won't be eating for a while so I just want it to bake slowly.  All you wonderful chefs will figure it out for your kitchen.   But maybe 350 for 20-25 minutes, or until the cheese is yummy looking!

I make this with canbage and potatoes and drippings from fried pork chops. Beat it with hand mixer and serve with pork chops.  This is an old German recipe that my mother -in/law taught me.  I can spell it right but  it is pronounced seeskraut. It is one of my families favorite meals .  It keeps well in the frig and freezes well also just warm in microwave. I’ve been making this for 61 years.

03-17-16 ~ A St. Patrick's meal in our house requires a side of colcannon. This is a quick and easy version. I cut the serving portion back, but used the ingredients as listed and prepared, as listed. The results was a nice simple colcannon that went great with "Guinness Corned Beef' and 'Basic Irish Soda Bread' both from AR. I did shake, heavy handed with the salt and pepper.

We had a late St. Patty's Day dinner tonight.  My husband made a crappy face when I told him the recipe.  He said he didn't like mushy mashed potatoes.  So I cooked according to directions, mashed 1/2 of it, left the other half in chunks.  Everyone LOVED it.  My husband even liked it mashed! My picky 6 year old had seconds and thirds!
Only slight changes, added carrots to the chunks (didn't mash the carrots) and a clove of garlic.
Will definitely make it again, probably with more veggies :)

We used just whole milk (no cream on hand) and didn't need to full amount for a good texture.  Forgot to add any salt and pepper, and we still ate it right up (though it would probably be good to add).

This is exactly what I was looking for! I am by no means an expert in the kitchen, and I managed this without any frustration or blunders. As noted by the author, traditional Irish food is VERY bland, so use this as a base and then add whatever flavors you like to punch it up a bit. I added some reduced-fat shredded cheese and a little garlic. I also only had chives so I added those directly to the potato/cabbage mix at the end instead of boiling. Then I layered it in a baking dish over frozen corn and topped with sauteed mushrooms and baked at 375. After about 20 minutes I put slices of Gouda cheese over the mushrooms and baked 10 more minutes. It turned out even better than I had hoped! I served it with turkey meatloaf and my husband and 6 year old daughter both raved over it and cleaned their plates. Thank you for this recipe that I will be making over and over again!
