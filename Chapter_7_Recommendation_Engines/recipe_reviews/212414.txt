Considering all the ingredients in this recipe I expected more.  They were okay...not dry or heavy like some wheat muffins, but they seemed a little bland.  Maybe more spices.  I couldn't even taste the coconut or apple at all.....I think I'd add more of both, but probably won't make these again.

Perfectly sweet and very moist.  Great for breakfast or an anytime snack.
