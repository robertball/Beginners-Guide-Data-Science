Family really liked it! Cooked the beef ribs for 9 hours in crock pot. The meat fell off the bones. I had to use some Mango Chutney (recommended by local asian food market-Thanks!) in place of loquat preserves . Going to use pork country style ribs for a change of pace.

Addendum: The pork wasn't as good. Going back to beef...

The taste was amazing.  I didn't use the preserves.  I sautéed onions, peppers and mushrooms on the stove and after removing the short ribs from the crockpot added the sauce to the sautéed mixture and thickened it and served the meat and sauce over a bed of rice.  I will definitely make this again!

Definitely will make again. My husband loves the Asian flair,  to quote him "it is a keeper".  Did not use the loquat preserve as I halved the recipe.

It was delish! I used 1 cup of French onion soup instead of water and the packet of onion soup mix.

I used apricot preserves and this came out really good except there was too much sauce. You could cut in 1/2 and still have enough. I also fried the ribs before I put them in the crock pot.

Used apricot preserve instead of Loquat. Excellent and very tasty - stepped back on spice for the kids but worth it, can't wait till they like spice

I made this exactly as written with loquats. It was very good and reminded me of a Hawaiian dish. I would recommend adding a tablespoon of cornstarch as the recipe submitter suggested if you want a ticker sauce. My husband loved this and super easy to make.
