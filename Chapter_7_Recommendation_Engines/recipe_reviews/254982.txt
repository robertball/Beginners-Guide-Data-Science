I added my own seasoning to plain GF bread crumbs such as parsley, garlic salt, onion powder, sea salt and basil. I used a little less sauce as my family prefers less and a little extra cheese. It was delicious and I enjoyed it more the second day. Thank you so much for this recipe it was my first time eating eggplant too, now I’m hooked!

Simple to prepare and absolutely delicious! I love that the eggplant slices are dipped only once in egg and once in breadcrumb parmesan mix and then baked. I used a Misto sprayer with extra virgin olive oil to lightly oil the slices before baking.
I sprinkled Italian seasoning on top before baking and it added a subtle lovely flavor.
I will definitely be making this recipe again!

I loved this and so did my husband. I used seasoned bread crumbs (Not gluten free but I loved the recipe) I also left the skin ON and sliced it as you would a cucumber. I used two jars of marinara sauce. I cooked it for about 40 minutes instead of 25. It is just delicious.

Followed the directions closely, just added more cheese and sauce. It was delicious! Even my 9 year old who doesnt like eggplant finished her plate! One tip to get even slices of eggplant - use a mandolin.

Since I am allergic to dairy as well as celiac, I used the vegan cheeses for this dish.  They worked very well.  I also used panko gluten free Italian style breadcrumbs because that was all I had in the house.  I would not use the Panko again because it made the dish too crunchy.    Other than that, it had wonderful flavors and I would definitely make it again with the above changes.

This turned out great!!  Thank you so much for the idea!  I meal-prepped this on a Sunday and enjoyed it for dinner all week.  It was so comforting having a healthy, hearty, low-carb, GF, hot dinner to come home to after work.  I added Italian seasoned lean ground turkey, which I browned with onion, fennel seeds, and Italian seasonings, and I  added between the layers of sauced (already baked) eggplant slices.  I used a mandolin to make long, thin strips of eggplant.  I only sprinkled a tiny bit of Parmesan on the eggplant before baking and used very little mozzarella, just for purposes of calorie/fat reduction.  Delicious!  Will definitely make again soon!

I substituted burrata for mozzarella and fresh for dried basil (after baking).  Also, made tomato sauce with our own garden tomatoes which made this pretty labor intensive but totally worth it... the smaller amount of sauce required might make "from scratch" worth it.

I used a 13x9 pan and it was a bit on the dry side.   I will add more sauce next time, but the flavor was great!  Will definitely make again.
