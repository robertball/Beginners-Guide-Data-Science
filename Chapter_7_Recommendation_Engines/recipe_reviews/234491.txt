This is the tastiest pear pie I have ever made.  I made a few minor changes -- I used a 9" Deep Dish Pie pan and used 4 large, thinly sliced d'Anjou pears. The tang of the sour cream is just enough to offset the sweetness of the pears.  Served with triple Vanilla ice cream. Got raves from company and picky husband.

This pie is fantastic!!!  
I used 4 cups of pears in a 9" deep dish pie pan.  I didn't read through the recipe ahead of time and put the topping on before putting it in the oven instead of waiting until the last ten minutes.  It didn't burn (thank goodness) and turned out beautifully.  
This pie has a yummy custard-like filling that compliments the pears perfectly.  (Note: I used nutmeg instead of cinnamon.  If using cinnamon it tastes more like an apple pie.  USE NUTMEG!)
If you're looking for a good pie to use up all those pears with, try this one.  You won't be disappointed.

This pie is amazingly good. Sounded like it would be weird. I made it for Thanksgiving and everyone who tried it loved it!

I loved this pie! I am not a fan of pears, I only made this recipe because my wife wanted pie and we didn't have much on hand. My wife raved about. I will definitely make again. The only change I made was that I used canned pears because that's what I had.

I made this because I had a spare pie crust and pears are in season. I used light sour cream instead of regular but made no other changes. It is fantastic, everyone loved it!

This was so easy and turned out great!  My friend has a pear tree and gave me some pears. I used 2 cups pears, 1 cup blueberries, and the juice of one lemon(I don't know why- just seemed like a good idea- cut the sweetness a little?).  Also, I didn't have any sour cream, so I used the 2% plain greek yogurt I had in the fridge.  Delish!  We loved the sort of custard like consistency of the filling. I am not much of a baker, but, will definitely make this again!  I might try it with other fruit next time-apples and raspberries might work well, too.

This was excellent though I did have an issue with the crumb topping.  1/2 c butter with 1/2 c flour is mud.  I added more flour along with the spices so I could get it to crumb and that probably made too much topping.  The pie was delicious though.  I will definitely make this again.

We are not big pie eaters but my family loved this pie.  I followed the recipe except that I didn't have pastry dough available  so  I  made a graham cracker crust instead. Also, I misread the directions and baked the pie with the topping instead of adding the topping at the end of the baking time. However,  baking with the  topping  turned out fine and the crust Was a tasty, crunchy element.   I will definitely make this again but use  a pastry crust just so I can compare the difference.

I'm not a big fan of sweets so this pie was perfect for me.   The pears from our tree were not very ripe so I boiled the slices for about 4 minute.  With this slight modification they were perfectly cooked following the oven directions.

WOW! I've always liked pears but now I'm in love! The only thing I changed was to substitute a red delicious for one pear because I only had two. My Lord! Between my partner and I it was gone before morning. You've got to make this!

I didn't care for this at all. When eaten fresh, the crust was soggy. (The side was nice and flaky so I know it wasn't the crust's fault.) Then when eaten later, as leftovers, the texture was very mushy.

Fantastic pie! Pretty much followed recipe first time, nutmeg vs. cinnamon, rave reviews at Thanksgiving. We loved the custard so doubled that second time and 1/2 the crumble topping with brown sugar. Just out of out of oven....more feedback to come!

I had a ‘happy accident’ and ended up using a deep dish pie crust ... worked out very well, as it keep the pie from overflowing

Really good! We used home grown pears and added one apple for more crispness. Our oven is old, so I had to monitor the crust closely. Ended up adding several more minutes to the time and turned on the broiler for about a minute to crisp up the top. Made some fresh whipped cream for topping and we are all very stuffed and happy.

Made this tonight with pears that I desperately needed to use up. Simple, yet DELICIOUS. This is going into my keeper pile.
