Mmm-mm-mm!  As this recipe's first reviewer I can happily report that it is a winner!  These are soft pillows of sugar cookie goodness, frosted with the most luxurious creamy, billowy buttercream.  Melt in your mouth, not too sweet and pretty too.  Perfect in my mind.  Except… it’s a good thing that rolling out sugar cookies isn’t my thing and I had planned to roll these into balls and flatten them all along.  This dough is so soft and so gooey that there is no way you could roll it out if you follow the recipe as written.  And, since the dough is made with shortening, refrigerating it would do nothing to firm it up.  If you are hell bent on rolling these out, you’ll have to add more flour.  A better option?  Just roll these into about 1” balls, roll in sugar, then flatten to about 1/4” with the bottom of a glass dipped in sugar.  For soft cookies, bake until set but before they begin to turn brown around the edges.

Definitely a keeper. For the comments the batter was too sticky, I put in it the fridge for about 30 minutes. Stiffened it up and the rolling was easy. Thank you!

Great cookie! Pillowy soft! I used butter instead of shortening, decreased the salt to a half tsp. and used half of the frosting. I agree with the previous reviewer that these cookies are way to sticky to roll, so I used a round cookie scoop and dropped them directly onto the cookie sheet. My cookie scoop was quite large so I baked them for 14 minutes while not over baking! They were not at all flat and looked beautiful after frosting and topping with fall sprinkles.

My review based on the following modifications: Butter (not margarine) & 1/2 tsp salt.  I really like the texture of the cookies, but the amount of butter in the recipe makes them taste a little like corn bread rather than a sugar cookie (maybe increase the vanilla?) - Also, as others have said you cannot roll these out unless you've refrigerated the dough for at least an hour.  Overall, this is a good base recipe for cookies you intend to flavor (orange, cinnamon, etc) but not as an actual, stand-alone sugar cookie.

This recipe came out EXACTLY like Loft cookies. So soft and delicious! I didn't use the frosting recipe on this page because 3 cups of confectioners sugar sounded like a TON! But none the less, cookies are amazing. Didn't change a thing about the recipe. Highly recommend!

Good standard sugar cookie. It was a little sweet (even for sugar cookies), but other than that it was very good. Also, good ratio of ingredients. I hate it when I end with a bunch of extra frosting or dough after I'm finished. I have to make the obnoxious decision of either eating it and feeling gross or throwing out a bunch of unused ingredients. This one got it right on the money.

Really good! I made this recipe, following the review suggestions and because my husband likes sweeter frosting, I added 1/4 cup more powdered sugar and 2 more tbsp of milk. Simple, quick and toddler approved!

I really wanted a cut out cookie, and as written, this is not it.  However, I dumped approximately one more cup of flour in, mixed, then refrigerated for 30 minutes or so.  That did the trick, they rolled and cut easily then.

I also wanted more of a frosting 'glaze', again, as written, this is not it.  I was too tired and frustrated to thin the frosting out any further, so I simply spread it on.  I did add almond extract to the frosting, as that is what I've enjoyed in frosted sugar cookies in the past.  The cookies tasted great!

I tried this recipe for the first time and it is awesome.  I do agree that you cannot roll out the dough and tried the rolling in the ball and flattening with a flat bottom cup technique and it worked perfectly.  These are so good you don't need to even frost them if you don't want to.  This is definitely in my recipe box now and marked as a favorite..  :)

I used this recipe to make thumbprint cookies and they were awesome!!!! I did several variations... mini chocolate bars, ganache, and jelly filled! I used a cookie scoop to make sure they were all even. I rolled them in sprinkles and then used the back of a teaspoon lightly dusted in flour to make an indent. Put them in the fridge for 20 minutes to chill the dough. Baked them for 10 minutes then put filling in and back for another 2 minutes. They were perfect!

These cookies are delicious! ! I did however use butter  instead  of shortening.  They are not overly  sweet which is perfect by the time you iced them ! I was able to roll them out with no problem after I chilled the dough and added flour to rolling surface.

I made both the dough and the icing and just like a previous review stated, the portions are perfect. No leftover cookies or icing. That's awesome! Review of the cookie: sticky! I was making this to do w/ the kids and they were very excited to use the cookie cutters. No time to refrigerate so I just slowly added more flour. Problem solved. The flavor of the dough was a tad bland but that's because of the added flour. I did loved the softness and moistness of the cookie. Review of the icing: Very sweet but it worked well considering the blandness of the cookie. It was easy to put in ziploc bags and pipe onto the cookies and it does harden a little bit to where you can stack the cookies. Added peppermint extract to the icing to add more flavor and it was a great addition!

These tasted pretty good, but never got solid enough to use cookie cutters. They were fine as drop cookies.

definitely doesn't take like loft house cookies! the frosting came out all watery and so sugary and what the sugar in cookies lacked, the frosting was pure sugar, litterally! But since the cookies didn't turn out to be sweet and tasted like biscuits, next time just throw in some chopped bacon and peppers and you've got a great appetizer!

I wasn't pleased with these cookies at all. I followed the recipe exactly except for scaling down the salt to 1/2 tsp. The texture of the cookie threw it off. It tasted more like cornbread than a cookie. A total waste of ingredients.

DEEE-LISH!!! These cookies are addictive and really easy! I also decreased the salt to 1/2 tsp. I did some drop cookies and also rolled some out. Just refrigerate the dough for an hour or so before you roll them. Turned out absolutely perfect & I'm really picky!!

I have made this recipe many times for our family and also several dozen at a time for our church. I keep getting requests to bring them again and again! I cut the milk in half and use butter flavored crisco instead of regular. We never cut shapes out of these (I agree the dough is too sticky for that), rather roll them into 3 tbsp sized balls and they are just round and fluffy and perfect for frosting.

The cookie monsters in the family loved. The first few cookies to cut out was a little difficult. Dough was very soft. After had a tiny bit of flour from the board, things were just fine. Take your time with and they turn out beautiful. Very festive looking.

I also did not roll out cookie dough.  Put by tablespoon full and smashed down with sugar coated glass.  Very good.  The same as the "Loft" cookies.  I also used butter instead of shortening.

These are really good! If you prefer to measure your flour by weight, I did 128 grams per cup of flour called for in the recipe and it came out great when rolled into a ball and slightly flattened. Melt in your mouth tender every time. I experimented by rounding up to 130 which made the cookie ever so slightly tougher but i think would work better for rolled cookies. These would definitely need some time in the fridge before rolling. I did make one substitute by replacing the shortening with butter. I used salted butter and if you do this, I recommend cutting the amount of salt called for in the recipe in half. The first batch was a little too salty and that’s from someone who usually adds an extra pinch of salt to their cookies. Of course that’s no fault of the original recipe as it called for shortening and not butter. The texture of the cookie was so tender. Just like what you would expect from those colorful cookies in the deli section. The frosting was super easy and tasted good. I was impressed when I made this! I was going to get them store bought but thought I’d try making it and I’m glad I did. They are much better homemade! Thank you for an awesome recipe!

I used a gluten free flour mix so that might be why the cookies didn’t turn out. I would say the batter was definitely too thin. So thin that I wouldn’t call it a dough and certainly couldn’t roll it. Once they were cooked and frosted they were okay. But I probably won’t make again.

These are very good sugar cookies.  Another reviewer had added cinnamon and I did as well.  It adds a bit more flavor.  Also used a bit more vanilla.  Rolls very easily

I don’t think these are ANYTHING even remotely close to Lofthouse cookies. And, the flavor sucks. Maybe that’s because I used decorations instead of the frosting, but a cookie should be delicious standing alone. My mothers melt in your mouth sugar cookie recipe is better, so I’ll continue using it. Giving these cookies to the neighbors lol! They were easy to roll out and to make in general though.

Yum!  Makes sure to cool the dough before rolling, and since it's stickier, use plenty of flour on rolling surface.

Hard to roll out and cut out because it was so sticky, but well worth it! These tasted great! ( but I used a separate icing recipe )

These were good would have been better if I had not poured tooo much vanilla in batter. I did not have any shortening, so I used unsalted butter. I placed batter in fridge to stiffen up so I could roll ,but did not work so I just spooned on the cookie sheet. The imperfection made them even more homemade. The next time I make I will do the same way and measure vanilla.

These were ok. From the description in the reviews, I expected them to be more moist, especially because they're made with shortening. If not for the icing, they would be dry. I followed the advice of other reviewers and did not attempt to roll the dough out. I baked balls of dough at 350° for about 12 minutes. I don't think I would make them again.

I made these for St Patrick's day and thought they turned out excellent. I had read a few comments before making them, so I let the dough chill in the fridge while I did a few things and found them easy to roll out and work with. They baked up beautifully and the frosting was the perfect amount for the cookies. I was very pleased!

I kept the recipe the same and my family loved them. My niece and nephew made some for our local fire department to let them know how much we appreciate them. They were thankfull for the cookies and they told me that they were delicious. I will be making this recipe again.

I have made these a few times now and they never disappoint. I tend to put flour down for them not to stick to everything and they still are amazing.

This is my new favorite sugar cookie recipe.  My son requested softer sugar cookies, and I wanted dough that I could roll and cut out.  I was almost out of shortening, so instead of 1c shortening I used 1/3c of each shortening, coconut oil, and unsalted butter.  I put the dough in the freezer for about 10min to stiffen up a bit before rolling.  I worked the dough in batches leaving the remainder in the freezer when not in use.  I used a mixture of flour and powdered sugar to keep the dough from sticking to surfaces.  We baked the first tray for 10min and the cookies were a bit crisp, so we baked the next trays for 8-9min and the cookies were perfect.  
I made the frosting with room temperature butter (with vanilla and 2tbsp milk) and it seemed to be getting quite stiff before adding all 3c of powdered sugar, so I added an extra 1tbsp milk and only about 2 1/2 cups of powdered sugar.  I suggest adding a bit of salt to the icing, perhaps a few dashes (~1/8 tsp) if using salted butter or more (~1/4 tsp) if using unsalted butter.  
Happy baking!

I never write reviews but I just made these cookies and absolutely loved them! I don't use shortening for anything and didn't want to buy some since I was making these on a whim so I refrigerated unrefined coconut oil I had on hand until it was the right consistency and subbed that in for the shortening. This substitution made the cookies taste like coconut and were really good - definitely not bland at all. I just wish I read the reviews about decreasing the salt because they are a little salty as is which is why I deducted a star. I also had a problem with the dough being too sticky to roll so I just made drop cookies. I cooked the first batch for the whole 10 minutes and where the edges spread out got a little crunchy with the middles being soft and fluffy. For the second batch, I stuck the dough in the fridge for a while and rolled it in balls and flattened them and that worked out a little better. So if you think these cookies are bland, try coconut oil instead of shortening - you won't be sorry!

These cookies were delicious! As a teenager who loves to cook, my family loved when I wanted to make these. They are like the store brought cookies that I would find in my local grocery store. The only issue I had was that the dough was too sticky to work with immediately, so I kept incorporating flour into it until I was able to roll it out. Definitely will make these again!

My family and I loved them and we are making them for Santa later this month.  I really recommend this recipe to anyone who is in need of one.  Though,  I would add into the recipe to put the dough in the fridge for around 30 mins, so that it is easier to roll out. Overall, I thought this recipe was a keeper and we will be making more of them. Thanks so much! This is a big winner!

Very soft, made thick and baked for 9 minutes and they were perfect. Didn't have baking soda so I used baking powder instead. I'm a sugar cookie snob and have only found one other recipe I like that uses half butter. Very impressed for a recipe that calls for shortening - I did use the butter flavored shortening so I expect that helped.

Dough was not able to be rolled out, so instead of adding a tremendous amount of extra flour, I plopped dough balls on the baking sheet rather than cutting shapes. The dough made a pretty bland cookie. The frosting was not easy to spread, and was way too sweet. The finished cookies were okay, but I wouldn't recommend this recipe to anyone. Keep looking.

I substituted unsweetened almond milk for regular milk (all out of regular milk)   other than that change I followed the recipe and I thought these cookies were good!   They are not overly sweet so the frosting really adds to the overall sweetness and flavor.  The texture is soft, almost like corn bread but crispy on the edges although I think ten minutes was a bit too long to bake.  This are NOT a good cut out cookie recipe so I think modifying this to make cut outs would be frustrating and much easier just to go with a different recipe if wanting to make cookies with the kids. Warning...these are really addicting, Time to go for a walk and burn some calories!!!

I followed the recipe but added 1 more tsp of vanilla.  I'm sad to say these cookies did not live up to expectations. The cookies turned out poofy and soft, but as they cooled they hardened to be almost like a biscuit or cornbread texture. The frosting just wasn't right. Taste and texture were just weird. It was grainy and tasted like straight sugar. Will not make again.

I tweaked a little by instead of a full cup of white sugar I did 3/4 cup white sugar and 1/4 brown sugar, and instead of 1 cup shortening I did 1/2 cup butter and 1/2 cup shortening and added 1/2 teaspoon baking powder to dry ingredients.  Put the dough in the freezer for awhile and rolled dough and did cutout cookies.  The dough was a not as stiff as you would normally prefer for cutouts, but made it work and the cookies turned out amazing!  For frosting I did 2 cups butter, 2 ounces of cream cheese, 4 cups powdered sugar - whipped for fluffy.  for chocolate I added 2 tbsp of baking cocoa powder.  very yummy frosting for yummy cookies.

I was able to make this a Gluten Free recipe by using Cup 4 Cup Gluten free flour.  I also adjusted the shortening to 1/2 c and used 1/2 c butter.  As mentioned in other reviews, the batter was too sticky to roll so I used a cookie scoop and was able to make 3 dozen perfectly round, fluffy and delicious cookies!

My 8 year old son made these by himself and they were great. The recipe was very easy for him to follow - he used a cookie scoop instead of rolling out the dough & then pressed them flat with a glass dipped in sugar. He baked them for 12 minutes (slightly less time on a dark cookie sheet). The frosting was more of a paste than buttercream, so we added 2 teaspoons of shortening to make it fluffier. Very tasty!

Good recipe, but the batter was too sticky to roll out. I added flour until it was sticky anymore, then rolled it (didn't measure). The cookies still turned out delicious and fluffy. I made heart shaped cookies for Valentine's Day and added food coloring to the frosting since it wasn't a pure white. Cookies are delicious!!!

So good! My dough was really sticky, so I didn't try to roll it out and cut it. Instead, I just rolled it into balls that I then flattened out onto the pan. They were super soft and sweet. Yummy!

I made these for a 100th of school kindergarten party.  I followed the recipe but followed the advice to roll them into 1" balls and then into sugar.  I then flattened with a glass dipped in sugar.  Made 40 cookies.  The kids loved them and referred to them as "amazing"!  They decorated them themselves.  Will have to try the frosting next time!

I love the Loft House soft sugar cookies and they're my absolute favorite cookies in the world! I had a craving for them today so I decided to make them but I split the recipe in half. I used butter instead of shortening and took away about a 1/4 tsp salt. I added 1/8 tsp cream of tartar to the dough. I refrigerated the dough for half an hour and rolled the cookies into balls and pressed them down to 1/4" thickness with a glass. Baked them at 345 degrees F for about 8 minutes. They weren't as soft as the Loft House cookies and had a cornbread-like texture. The frosting wasn't really like a frosting, it was like a sweet grainy mixture. It had a very weird texture. These cookies were ok but did not taste like the storebought ones.

I have always hated these frosted sugar cookies like the icky sweet kind you buy at the grocery store during holidays.  I indugled my kids this St. Pat's because I hate all the dyes and ick that goes into the store bought ones.  OMG!  My little daughter begged me to try a bite and they were absolutely DELICIOUS!!!!  If you like extra sweet, make these.  They are easy and you can make them right away (no refridge needed).  The frosting is excellent.  Thank you for posting the recipe.  BTW, you want to roll them out with extra flour, (as with most sugar cookies), this way, if dough is soft, you can add what you need and they won't sick while cutting out.

These cookies turned out amazing! My family loves them, I made them for Christmas and I've made them 3 times since. I suggest not rolling it out with a rolling pin because it does stick, but just pressing with your hands with extra flour then use your cookie cutters. Fabulous cookies!

I followed this recipe exactly and these are NOT sugar cookies.  These little fluff balls are not sweet whatsoever.

It was a bit sticky so I refrigerated it for a 1/2 hour, generously floured my pastry cloth and rolling pin and had no trouble. (The first rolling I didn't flour the surface enough and a couple of cookies stuck) The final product was delicious and the frosting made just enough for the batch. Yummy!

very good!  I made a few alterations-I added a bit more sugar, used butter and lemon juice instead of vanilla!!!  Wowza!!!  Very good-when the cookies came out of the oven, i lightly pressed the tops with the spatula!

These cookies were really good! I used a cookie scoop and plopped the dough down for each cookie. When they were done cooking, they were a semi-dome shape. They were super soft, not too sweet, and have a light pillowy texture. I followed the directions exactly and they turned out great. I didn't give it five stars because I think it is possible there are better recipes out there, although these were super good. Thanks for a great recipe!

Easy & Delicious recipe. Thank you. I love that the dough did not have to be chilled first. Great kids project : )
