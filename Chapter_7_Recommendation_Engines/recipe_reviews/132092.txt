I made the first batch following the recipe, and they were good but needed a little somethine more. For the next batch I added coconut rum, and that seemed to do it. Four stars is based on the addition of the rum. I garnished with little skewers of cherries and fresh cubes of pineapple and served in chilled martini glasses. My guests liked them.

Pretty good.  I thought I was in the mood for a drink tonight, but after one sip I changed my mind and wanted something without any alcohol taste, so I added the rest of my can of pineapple juice to the drink.  I do like it, just a bit too much vodka for me--next time I'd do a bit less(maybe half).  But pretty colors!  I don't have a martini glass, so I just made it in a wine glass.  Thanks for the recipe!

I used regular vodka I had on hand and thought it was perfect! Not too sweet or too strong. Beautiful drink! Lovely taste!

I didn't have the vanilla vodka, but regular vodka worked just as well. I like that it is sweet, but not too sweet.
