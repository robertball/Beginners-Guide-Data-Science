I followed the recipe exactly.  It turned out really well.  I took it to a gathering and received lots of compliments.  Other Tres Leches recipes I looked at complained of excess liquid in the bottom of the pan.  I did NOT have that problem with this cake.  It was moist and delicious, but not runny.

Although mine didnt look half as pretty as the picture of this recipe...the taste was amazing. Company loved it.....very moist and so easy. Yes there really is a lot of liquid to absorb....so poke big holes!.... I let this sit overnight in the fridge to soak and absorb before I frosted with the cool whip (lite by the way). And I also dusted the top with cocoa powder instead of the shaved chocolate.  Easy and a crowd pleaser! Thanks!

OUTSTANDING.  I have been making Tres Leches Cakes for many years (since my husband's Army days in SW Texas and New Mexico).  This is a wonderful variation.  For those having trouble with the liquid absorbing - make sure you are pouring the liquid over the cake within 10-15 minutes of taking out of the oven.  Do not let it cool.

Really good!  I had quite a bit of liquid that didn't absorb so think I will try to remake this with bigger wholes before milks are poured.

All I need say is....YUMMY, YUMMY, YUMMY!!!!!
Don't let the cake cool before you poke holes & pour mixture over top and you won't have a problem with it not soaking in. Try using a straw to poke your holes and then blow the cake pieces out into a cup periodically.

Made this for company to go along with a Mexican themed dinner.  It was very delicious!  Company enjoyed it.  I followed another suggestion in a review and used a straw to put holes in the cake.  I didn't have a problem with the sauce being absorbed!

I found I also had some problems with the sauce not soaking in well, but in the end everyone really enjoyed it and found it to be super moist.

Made with real whip cream instead of cool whip and topped the entire cake with chocolate shavings and it came out perfect. Really rich.

I thought this cake tasted good, but there was A LOT of liquid. I didn't put it all in actually, and it was a pretty messy frustrating process. Thought the cake tasted good, although could have been a little sweeter for our tastes.

I made this for a Cinco de Mayo food day at work. I really liked how it turned out and it was quite pretty. My only warning is to make sure this is refrigerated until the last possible moment before serving. If it is allowed to warm too much it gets a bit soggy.

This was beautiful.  Delicious kind of a "malt" flavor to the cake.  Very special---made it for dessert when we had a Mexican meal!
