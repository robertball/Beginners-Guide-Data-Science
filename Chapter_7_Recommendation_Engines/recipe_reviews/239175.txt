Sooo this is more like an over-easy egg, not really a tortilla. I had to add more flour to make it actually edible with Mexican fixings.

I don't recommend this for anything other than breakfast.

Decent and easy but definitely not a tortilla as other review says. First one came out like a crispy holey egg flake. Couldnt tell it had flour in it even. So I added a bit  more baking soda,  the texture looked more efficient already. Poured it in skillet and it was denser this time, but came out like half burnt scrambled eggs. Thought I screwed up THEN noticed the other review. The original poster REALLY needs to edit this, as its really deceptive. I added in more flour. My third one I gave up right away and made scrambed as well. So glad I was making quinoa already as this recipe is a flop.
