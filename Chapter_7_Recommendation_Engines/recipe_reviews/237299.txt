I made this salad exactly as printed (except no orange zest) and served it in individual bowls.  Got rave reviews!

I made this for a large crowd and everyone loved it!   It was a great addition to our holiday dinner.   I did include some orange zest in the salad.  I highly recommend.

My! What a refreshing and different salad! Fresh, light, and fruity! I admit I added only half the cinnamon because I've had several bad experiences lately with cinnamon in recipes that no one has reviewed before me. I loved the flavor from adding the zest. I'd definitely make this again, especially for a ladies luncheon.
