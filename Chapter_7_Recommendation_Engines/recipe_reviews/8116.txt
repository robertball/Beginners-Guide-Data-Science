I love this recipe.  I have made the following modifications.  I used whole wheat flour instead, 1.5 cup of applesauce, 2 tablespoons of oil, 1/2 cup of chocolate chips, and 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla extract.

We LOVE this recipe.  We use a doubled version of this recipe and make it at least once a week, and freeze them, leaving out 4-6 to eat immediately :)  Then each day, we take a few out.  They defrost on their own in probably 1/2 hour or so, but 20 second in the microwave makes it even faster.  In any case, they taste fresh baked.

We also like to add 1 cup of chopped walnuts (not too finely chopped) and recently my wife has taken to adding 1 1/2 cups of raisins.

Another variation is that we have taken to greasing a cookie sheet and putting a  tablespoon glob and making big "cookies" out of them, and they actually are more convenient to eat.

I can't say enough good things about this recipe.  It's just the best.  Well worth the effort, especially if you're like me, and just like the idea of having a good tasting source of roughage in your diet.  And they are so easy to eat on the go.

The first time I made these muffins I thought they were too salty and a bit dry. The second time I made them I reduced the baking soda and baking powder to 1 teaspoon each, increased the oil to 1/3 of a cup and added a cup of blueberries. Turned out perfect. It is VERY important to let the ingredients sit for at least 10 minutes to allow the oat bran to soften.

I've made these several times and they always come out good.  I usually substitute wheat flour for at least half of the all-purpose flour.  To enhance the flavor I add 1 tsp cinnamon and vanilla.  I've also substituted yogurt for the applesauce with good results.

These muffins were tasty, but I change a few things to get them the way I wanted. I increased this recipe by 50% but still made 12 muffins: just regular sized. I also used 1/4 tsp. cinammon to the mix, as well as only 1/3 the oil and 1 cup low fat vanilla yogurt with 1/4 cup applesauce for the liquid. This made them very moist. Finally, I added the raisins and also the cinammon sugar as the author suggested, and they were delicious. I might addd a little more brown sugar than the recipe calls for. They were not very time consuming and baked quickly.

These are good as far as the ingredients go.  I prefer to use a more traditional quick bread/muffin method: Combine the oat bran and applesauce first, and let them sit together to soften the bran.  Combine the eggs, sugar and oil in a small bowl.  Combine the dry ingredients in a large bowl.  Add the egg/sugar mixture to the hydrated oat mixture, then quickly combine with the dry ingredients.  You'll get more tender muffins with better lift because you're not developing the gluten in the flour, and you get better lift from the baking powder if  you don't let it sit after it gets wet.  This recipe is almost exactly the same as the one on the Hodgson Mill website and I've been using it for years.  It's a good basic recipe.  My favorite add-ins are butterscotch chips and chopped walnuts, and a bit of vanilla (add with the egg/sugar mixture).

Very good recipe.  However, I followed past reviewers advice to change it a bit.  I used 1.5 cups whole wheat flour (no bleached flour), 1.5 cups applesauce, .5 cups splenda, reduced brown sugar to .25 cups, added 2 tsp cinammon, 1 tsp vanilla, 5 tablespoons veg oil and 1.5 cups of chopped granny smith apples.  They came out moist, not too dense and very tasty.  My family likes cinammon, so I think I may add another tsp next time.

I made only two changes; I used light brown sugar because that was all I had and I used melted butter instead of vegetable oil only because I'm low on oil right now. The applesauce I used was my own homemade applesauce that was seasoned with homemade apple pie spice. To add a little "something", I threw in a half cup of organic raisins that I soaked in hot unsweetened chai for 20 minutes (I drained and patted them dry a bit before doing so). My muffins turned out really moist, perfectly sweet and with me using the spiced applesauce and raisins, that added a really nice touch. The kids loved these. If you don't use a cinnamon-spiced applesauce, I think you should. These muffins need a little oomph.

This is a great recipe! I did not have applesauce, but did have a can of pumpkin pie mix. I used 1.5 cups of that, added 1 T of honey, 1 t of Vanilla and 1 cup of black currants. Wow! Moist and delicious! Following some other advice, I cut the baking soda and powder down to 1 t each. These taste like a warm autumn afternoon!

I just made these to use up an abundance of apples that I have.  I used homemade applesauce, and upped it to 1.5 cups, used whole wheat flour for the ap flour, and used 1 egg and 1/4 cup nf plain yogurt to cut down on cholesterol (mashed banana also works).  I added 2 tsp cinnamon, a tsp of vanilla, and a tsp of ground ginger and omitted the oil altogether.  I through in about 1.5 cups of grated apple , and next time I will probably add an additional 1.5 cups of shredded carrot and a good handful or so of raisins.  I was also thinking some orange zest and a splash of orange juice would be great.  This made about 11 mini muffins (bake only 10 min) and 12 regular muffins for me.  All in all good versatile recipe, for a hearty, healthy muffin!

This is a great recipe. With the applesauce added, it's not necessary to use as 
much oil as indicated. I only used 1 tablespoon of oil, and they turned out 
great. Also, I couldn't find oat bran, so I used Kellogg's All-Bran cereal (which is
wheat bran) instead, which worked fine.

I am not sure why these muffins tasted very very - I followed the recipe to the tee but added a bit of cinnamon.  I think they tasted like they had too much baking powder or soda in them which I would reduce if I was to try this recipe again.

This recipe is delicious, but it is precisely the same recipe on the Hodgson Mills Oat Bran box.  Probably should give credit where credit is due!

This is a 5 star recipe!  I substituted whole wheat pastry flour in place of all-purpose flour.  I used 1 whole egg and 2 egg whites to reduce cholesterol.  I also added 1 TBS flaxseed meal, 1/3 c. craisins, 1/2 c. chopped walnuts, and about 1/8 c. lowfat buttermilk to thin the batter.  Topped with a sprinkle of quaker oats mixed with a little brown sugar.  I used Jen H's mixing instructions to give the muffin a higher loft (see Jen H review on 4/7/10).  These muffins are AWESOME and heart healthy too.  Due to my add-ins each muffin has 237 calories and 5 grams of fiber.  If you want to cut calories leave out the walnuts.  YUM.

These were truly horrible. I can only get them down with a gulp of very sweet tea. I went by the stars, I now know that I should have read the comments; if it needs a bunch of modification, then I think it doesn't  deserve 4 or 5 stars. Th I will try the modifications suggested; add some raisins, lessen the amount of soda and baking powder. I hate to hurt anyone's feelings, but honestly, as the recipe was written it was a waste of ingredients. Please forgive me, I'm actually quite nice, just disappointed.

HEALTHIER  VERSION
I made a few adjustments to make it a little healthier.
I only used 1 tablespoon of veg oil and I added a tablespoon of skim milk.
I upped the apple sauce to 1.5 cups
I substituted eggs for egg whites
I added 2 tsp cinnamon
1 tsp vanilla
I used .25 cups of brown sugar and .25 cups of splenda
I found them pretty tasty, hopefully others will too

This is a great base muffin recipe - I've experimented with adding addition ingredients like apple cider mix (2pkgs/batch) or different combinations of spices. Cardamom and diced dates is a great combination, too!

If you substitute any whole wheat flour in the mix you may have to add more liquid. You can use a little milk, cream or orange juice.  They look really pretty if you top with a few rolled oats and brown sugar.

Five stars with changes~ We have made these as written, but over time, we have adjusted the recipe to now HALVE the sugar, oil, and leavening (baking powder, soda and salt), and find it more than sufficient. We add 50% more applesauce to replace the missing oil. They rise beautifully, are plenty sweet and salty, and are very versatile for add-ins. We also add spices-- 1 tsp. cinnamon, 1/4 tsp. nutmeg, and 1 tsp vanilla.

THIS is the oat bran recipe I've been looking for. I've tried others but just couldn't get the taste & consistency I wanted (I tend to be picky :-)!) I took the advice of a previous reviewer & used whole wheat flour & 1 1/2 cups + 2 tbsp applesauce. Since my applesauce is unsweetened, I added 1/2 cup Splenda. I also added 2 tsp cinn & 1 tsp vanilla. Baked up nice & moist. Since I like oats but I'm not a HUGE fan, I cut the oat bran down to 1/2 cup. This allowed for the flavor to come through but not dominate too much. Even my husband thought they were good. Thank you so much!

Yum! I tweaked to be a cholesterol lowering recipe--egg whites instead of whole eggs, omitted the oil & added 1/2 cup more applesauce, a few Tbsp of fat free greek yogurt and 1 over ripe banana for moistness. Also added walnuts & 2 Tbsp flax seed as both are good for cholesterol + raisins & put dark chocolate chips in some for my boys. Lastly, used whole wheat flour--a combination of other reviews & a few of my own tweaks. Great base recipe!! My whole family loves these truly healthy muffins---thanks!

If you like coconut, using a quality coconut oil in place of the vegetable oil is a way to add a little more nutritional value.

I liked the muffins.  I added a cup of graded carrots, a cup of walnuts and a handful of crystallized ginger.  They are not the sweetest muffins, but still good.

I read other's comments carefully and followed suggestions for increasing moisture, decreasing sweetener,salt, and oil. And I used Whole Wheat flour as many did.
For sweetener I used 2T xyletol, 2T brown sugar=1/4c total=half of what the recipe says.
I left out the salt completely and found it was not missed. With the baking soda and powder it tastes plenty salty. I did not want to cut the leavening given the heaviness of the oat tbran.
For eggs, I used double the amt of egg whites instead as I didn't have whole eggs--healthier too.
I used the listed amt of applesauce. Many people added 1/2c more applesauce and cut the oil in half. I did not have more applesauce so used plain lowfat kefir (like yogurt) instead-1/2 c.
I did not use ANY Oil at all in the recipe.
For flavor I used pumpkin pie spice 1t and 1/2t vanilla. Next time I will add walnuts-was out.
I followed the suggestion of another poster of combining applesauce with oat bran and let it sit to soften bran, mixing remaining dry and wet ingredients separately, adding wet to oat bran and adding the dry flour mix last. My muffins were lofty, not dense...I was very pleased.

These were really good muffins. I made some changes to the recipe. I used 1/2 tsp of salt rather than a whole since I am watching the sodium. Used 4 egg whites and a banana. Also used a cup of applesauce-- no oil. Used the 1/2 cup of light brown sugar but threw in some dark chocolate chips in one half of batter and extra golden raisins in the other. I prefer the raisins since it gives it a sweeter taste. Add cinnamon and a bit of pure vanilla and your muffins will be great! This will be great with pumpkin pie spice and pumpkin next time!

I replaced the applesauce with 1 c whole blueberries & mixed them until the batter was purple.  Added dark choc chips.  It's the perfect bite!

This is a great base recipe then I like to add a few things. I use whole wheat pastry flour instead of all purpose, 1/4 cup ground flax seed, 1/2 cup chopped walnuts and a cup of frozen or fresh berries (I've used blue berries, raspberries, and black berries) The berries really sweeten it up:)

I've made these going by the original recipe and they were very good.  I've also added 1c raisins, 1c mashed banana, 1/2 c chopped walnuts, 1 teaspoon each of cinnamon and vanilla and 1/2 cup grated carrot and substituted wheat flour.  My husband loves these and now I make a couple of batches every week.

I was a bit concerned when the "batter" had the same consistency as drop-cookie dough--I thought the muffins would be too dry.  But they were fabulous!  During the ten-minute resting time I made some streusel out of brown sugar, cinnamon, rolled oats, and a little butter.  Sprinkle some on top and you've got a slightly sweeter muffin with a great crunchy crust!

This recipe is wonderful and I normally hate bran muffins.  I did make a few changes though to suit my tastes.  I used oat flour instead of white flour; maple syrup instead of brown sugar; half the oil (olive); 3/4 cup applesauce; added 1/2C raisins and walnuts; and added 1TBSP of cinnamon.  My sister loved them and has already had three!

These were really good.  I threw my other recipe out.  My husband has to watch his fat intake real close, so I halved the oil and used egg beaters.  I also used cinnamon in the muffins as well as plumped up raisins and sprinkled sugar and cinnamon mixture on top.  My other recipe called for all oat bran.  I think some flour helps with the texture as well as taste.  I use bread flour, it contains more gluten than regular flour, so it gives a better rise.  I'll be making these all the time now.  Thanks for the recipe Bron!

Those Muffins turned out amazing. I added a teaspoon of cinnamon as suggested. They came out very moist. I might cut down the oil a little though. Thanks for that amazing recipe.

Great recipe. I used coarse oat bran(Hodgson Mill bran) and on another occasion, I used a finer oat bran. The coarser oat bran worked better for my taste.My kids love taking them to school for a healthy snack.

Great recipe!  For a "Carrot Cake" version, you can make this with the optional raisnins and cinnamon PLUS 1 c. shredded carrot and 1/2 c. chopped walnuts.  Makes 10 large muffins.  Bake ~17 min.  Spread with cream cheese - yummy and healthy!

This is a keeper!  I added 1/3 cup milk, 2 teaspoons cinnamon, 6 oz butterscotch chips.  They were awesome.  You could also add bananas instead of the applesauce and mini chocolate chips.  YUM!

A very healthy muffin. I used wheat flour and added a teaspoon of cinnamon and sugar---though they are good without the cinnamon and sugar, too. If you follow the recipe exactly, the muffin will be dry. However, if you use butter or jam or eat them with milk, it doesn't matter.

I made a half-batch of these muffins, and they turned out delicious.  I used applesauce that was pre-seasoned with cinnamon, added a half-teaspoon of ground cinnamon to the flour mixture, and added about a tablespoon of honey to the wet ingredients.  Baked at 400 degrees for 13 minutes...  Wonderful.

These are AWESOME!  Great texture and I love that they aren't too sweet.  They are now my breakfast of choice and I know they are helping reduce my cholesterol.  If you are into the environment, don't preheat your oven until the muffins are resting in the tins.  BTW, I have used as much as 3/4 cup whole wheat flour along with 3/4 AP flour for extra fiber, and the muffins are still tall and fluffy.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Best bran muffin recipe I've made! I followed the recipe, except I added some ground ginger, cinnamon, and nutmeg to the flour mixture and added half an orange's worth of grated orange zest to the egg mixture.  The orange zest is a must! The result is not an orange-bran muffin, but just a more complex muffin with some awesome flavor you can't quite figure out. 
I'm keeping this one forever.

These were very good muffins.  I made some modifications:  I didn't have oat bran so I used oatmeal (which turned out well);  I used whole wheat flour as others have mentioned they used;  I used 3 tbsp. of coconut oil and instead of 1 cup of applesauce I used 1 1/2 apple/pear sauce.  I also added cinnamon and vanilla.  Finally I only used 1/4 cup brown sugar and 1/4 cup splenda.  Also I though 400 degrees was too hot so I cooked the muffins for 15 minutes at 375 which was plenty of time.  I could have cooked for 12 or 13 minutes and that would have probably been sufficient.

These muffins are going to be my healthy snacking/breakfast muffins.

I was looking for a healthy muffin to make and freeze. I just made these up this morning. I did adjust the recipe. I reduced the oil, halved the baking soda and powder and added vanilla and cinnamon. They turned out pretty good. I thought that they were a little sweeter than I thought they would be. I might cut down the sugar next time. Overall, pretty tasty. I put several in the freezer to save for busy mornings.

This is how I did it. I didn't necessarily have 'oat bran' but I had oat and bran. And since it's all just going one place I didn't really seem to mind putting 3/4 a cup of oats and 3/4 a cup of raisin bran cereal. Also I pureed 2 kiwis and about 3/4 a cup of grapes and used that instead of apple sauce, with that measurment I guess you could lower the suger because of all the natural sugers from the fruit.  They turned out super moist and delicously light with specks from the grape skins and kiwi seeds that give it an almost poppyseed mannor. Definately a good healthy balanced meal to feed yourself on those buisy mornings or to snack on before you work out, love the recipe!

I made several alterations to this recipe, but it makes a great base recipe that you can do so much with!  I used Splenda in place of the sugar. I used wheat bran instead of oat bran and I used ground oats in place of the flour, and finally, I used mashed bananas in place of the applesauce.  I also added a tsp of pumpkin pie spice.  They turned out delicious, and only 110 calories each!  (before the honey butter, lol)

I loved this recipe!  These muffins are so yummy and so moist and so healthy!

I made these 2 nights ago and have been telling people ever since!

I did make some modifications, I used splenda brown sugar in place of the dark brown sugar.  Egg whites in place of the eggs and reduced the oil to 2 tbps.

I used WHEAT bran instead of OAT bran (i didn't have any) and whole wheat flour.  Based on other users suggestion, I decreased my baking powder and soda to 1 tsp each.

I used a/b 1.5 cups of applesauce as well (all natural strawberry apple sauce & some regular organic, unsweetened applesauce).

I added a dash of cinnamon as well.

To half of the batch i added frozen blueberries.  To the other half i added raisins soaked in orange juice and just a touch of the orange juice.

They had SUCH a great flavor! I will likely make more tonight!  This time adding a mashed banana!

thanks again this is a GREAT recipe!!

I think this is a really great and easily adaptable recipe. 

Like previous reviewers, I added cinnamon, vanilla, a couple of tbsp yoghurt. I decreased the sugar to 1/3C. I also added 1C dried cranberries soaked in orange juice. I made 18 muffins and they are great! Moist, tasty and quite filling. I'm looking forward to taking them to work this week.

Thanks for the recipe!

After reading reviews, I made some changes myself. I used only Whole Wheat Flour, non-fat Vanilla Yogurt instead of applesause, added Cinnamon and Vanilla.
When I began mixing these I thought I had forgotten a moisture ingredient, it was so thick! I forged ahead anyway and they are delicious. Sweet enough and I just eat mine with light marg. Yum! Thanks

I used walnuts & cranberry & whole wheate flour and extra amounts of applesauce.  Despite that, it was still dry. The taste was good but too dry.  I will try them again with even more applesauce.

I made this using several of the suggestions found in other reviews.  I added the honey, vanilla, raisins, flax seed, and nutmeg.  I also used cinnimon applesauce, olive oil instead of veg. and 1/2 white and 1/2 whole wheat flour.  They were very good.  Great flavor and moist. Thanks for sharing the recipe.

Loved the texture but found the flavour a bit bland. A cup of fruit or something will probably help. I'll read the rest of the reviews, and try some experiments! Definitely worth making again, just with some additional ingredietns.

I've been looking for a way to make bran muffins with oat bran (I'm supposed to avoid wheat as an O blood type). The recipe was great.

I substituted spelt flour for the all purpose flour, added 1 tsp cinnamon and 1 cup raisins, and olive oil for vegetable oil. 

Had to cook it for 25 minutes to make 6 Jumbo muffins.

Great recipe!

This is a moist, flavourful muffin. To jazz it up a little, i added 1 cup of fresh strawberries and 2tbsp of sliced almonds...makes it very yummy!

Even though I cut the baking powder and soda in half they rose extremely well, so I'm not sure why so much was called for.  Added a heaping teaspoon of cinnamon, and the flavor was good-just sweet enough (for me...not sweet enough for my parents) with a fruity taste from the applesauce. I used extra large eggs, but they were still quite dry. One tester said I make so many delicious muffins that these are not worth making, so I probably won't try again.

Excellent! Best with the addition of soaked raisins, because I made the first batch of these muffins without raisins. They were delicious but a little dry (although, not a problem with lots of butter!).

It was great. My husband raved about them. I needed to keep them Gluten Free so I substituted Arrowhead Mills Gluten Free All Purpose Baking Mix for the all- purpose flour and added 3/4 tsp. of xanthan gum. I will definitely be making more of these.

It bothers me when people rate without first trying as is but here I go. I loved the basic idea of this and how flexible it is. As others stated, 1tsp. ea. of the b. powder and b. soda worked just fine. I only had wheat bran to work with, but it can be a bit strong in flavor, I added 1/4 c. oldfashioned peanut butter as well as 1/2 c. more applesauce and 2 T. ground flax seed and only 1 T. oil.  Also I used all WW flour, hence the extra applesauce.  They were great and a big hit with my clients.  Thank you for sharing and again my appologies for not trying as is
Reply for CHTHONIC who said her muffins were bitter-check for freshness of bran and oil. Bran is very perishable and if old will be rancid.Also WW flour if you used it.

Perfect healthy muffins with so much room to change up according to my preference. I used 1/4c brown sugar and 2 T amber agave, whole wheat flour, 1 egg, 1 1/4 c applesauce, 2T flax, 2T canola oil, and 2T almond milk...cooked at 385 for exactly 15 minutes and they turned out very moist and not overly sweet...thanks for posting a recipe that is healthy and tastes great!

Great basic recipe. TIPS:    Do as others have suggested and increase this recipe by 50% to get extra large muffins, the kind you get at the local bakery, with high crowns and edges that spread wide.

Everything went wrong with my process..Normally I check all ingredients before starting, this time I didn't and came up short on the AP flour (so I used a cup of AP and a little over 1/4 c. bread flour).  Got out the applesauce (homemade thick and chunky) to find that I only had 3/4 c...so I filled the rest of the cup with some Greek yogurt.  The batter was way too thick so I poured in the rest of a carton of half and half (no milk in the frig, either!).  Added a cup of chopped walnuts,  scooped into the muffin cups, sprinkled with a mix of turbinado sugar and pumpkin pie spice, let them sit for ten minutes,  threw them in the oven and hoped for the best.  They are superb!  I will definitely make them again...hopefully following the recipe to a T.  These will make a terrific breakfast on the run...thinking about adding some dried cranberries, too......

We used apple butter instead of applesauce and it worked out well. This is a pretty versatile recipe and can be used with pumpkin or banannas too.  Thanks!

These were okay...I didn't read the other reviews ahead of time. If I had I would have reduced the baking soda and powder by half...you could taste it in the muffins and it leaves a funny after taste. This were quick and easy...will try them again with adjustments.

Not very sweet, but that's how a bran muffin should be! I substituted: 3/4 whole wheat flour and 1/4 white flour, wheat germ for 1/4 of the oat bran, 2 chopped apples, 1/2 cup soaked raisins, 1/2 cup chopped walnuts, 3 tsp. cinnamon, pinch of nutmeg cloves ginger, 2 tsp. lemon juice, and added 1 cup soymilk because it needed more moisture...also took about 20 min to cook in my oven.

Very good and very easy.  I added LOTS of cinnamon because I LOVE cinnamon, about a cup of raisins, and about 1/2 cup of molasses.  My 2 picked teens ate one each for an after dinner snack.

I will give it a five because they are what I expected they would be: full of fiber and flavor. I used only whole wheat flour, brown sugar added a little bit more since my apple sauce was unsweetened. I also added like two more tbsp. of oil...

Best recipe for bran muffins I've found.  I just baked these and they're superb!  I mix up my own (ultra) brown sugar and used my homemade applesauce,and it turned out just great!  I'll certainly be baking these again!

I love these muffins. I’ve made them many times. I eat them for breakfast or a mid afternoon snack. I took the advice of smurphy1, and used 2 medium bananas, increased the applesauce to 1.5 cups, and used whole wheat flour. Also, I added about 2 (maybe even more) cups of frozen berries. My husband thought they were good until I sprinkled a little bit of unbleached sugar on the top before baking – apparently that made them great.

I have to say, not bad at all. I put in only 1/2 cup of applesauce and also used a 1/2 cup of spray butter. Thankfully, it worked! Adding whole and halved cranberries also gave the muffins a nice tartness. Overall, I liked them.

These muffins are delicious! I followed the recommendations of a few others and added fresh shaved apple, Splenda instead of sugar and all whole flour. I also found a brown sugar Splenda substitute to make them even lower in calories!

Excellent oat bran muffins.  I made some substitutions.  Used whole wheat pastry flour instead of white flour, 2 tablespoons oil, 1 1/2 cups of applesauce, added 1 cup of blueberries, 1 tablespoon vanilla and 1 tablespoon cinnamon.  1 tsp. mace and 1 tsp nutmeg.  These were great! Very moist and full of flavor.  I got 24 mini muffins and 6 full size.  I added chocolate chips to the 6 full size.  Wow!

Excellent! I used 1/2 whole wheat/white flour and added 2 Tb honey since we wanted it a bit sweeter.  My husband said they tasted "suspiciously healthy" but my kids gobbled them up and wanted more!

I should have obeyed the warnings!  These are very bland! It is true that a little jam will sweeten them up, but I didn't eat them.  I topped them with sugar knowing the batter was not sweet, but it still wasn't enough.  Too boring even for a bran muffin.

This is all right as a basic recipe, but I feel it could have used a bit of spice (cinnamon, etc.). Make sure you use sweetened applesauce -- it makes a big difference.

yum!  I made these with the hope of getting my 20 month old to get more fiber.  They are delicious.  I added about a teaspoon of ground ginger & a teaspoon of cinn. to  the flour mix.  I used 1 cup unbleached white flour & 1/4 c. wheat gluten flour (to get extra rise per a previous reviewers suggestion) and a 1/4 c. wheat germ ('cause we love wheat germ). Instead of veg. oil I used two exta TBL applesauce & 2 TBL olive oil to increase nutrional value. The applesauce I had in the fridge was raspberry/applesause and worked quite well.  I made a dozen in the mini-muffin tin (for the toddler) and still got ten regular-sized muffins.

I was looking for a match for my favourite coffee-shop oatbran apple muffins... These weren't it. I added cinnamon and diced apples to this recipe, then sprinkled cinnamon sugar on top before baking, but I found these weren't moist enough and weren't very flavourful, even with the addition of cinnamon. I might try these again, but I'll tweak the recipe a bit more to get them the way I want them.

Really good, but a little dry. The second try, I made them with homemade applesauce; it really picked up the flavor.

Great, healthy muffins. With the original recipe, these muffins would be low on flavor. I made it with the raisin variation, and also added vanilla and cinnamon. With those changes, they made a good for you treat.

I made the recipe as it was originally written. Very bland and dry, hard to swallow. If everyone else had to modify it to taste good it's not the best recipe. I guess either follow the modifications or find a different recipe.

I baked them for 12 minutes instead of 15, because they would have been over-done at 15.  And they are DRY.

Like other review suggested, I let applesauce and oat bran sit a bit to soften oats. I increased applesauce to 1 1/2C approx and used mostly whole wheat flour. Added 1 tsp vanilla and enough OJ to make the batter the right consistency- would have been too dry otherwise. Think would be tasty with raisins added in.

These were great!  I made the following changes, after reading a few other reviews:
Halved sugar, added 1/2 cup plain yogurt, 2 tsp cinnamon, half a cup of chopped dates, about a cup of chopped walnuts.  This made 19 smallish muffins (vintage-size muffin tins).

I really loved this muffin! I made a few changes from reviewers' comments. I used 1 c AP flour & 1/2 c whole wheat flour, cut the baking powder and baking soda to 1 teaspoon each, & added  2T more canola oil. I used cinnamon applesauce & topped with a little cinnamon sugar before baking.  Yummy! Reminds me of the Hostess oat bran muffins ( but way better) from the early 90s that I always ate. Remember those? Thanks for awesome recipe.

First time making bran muffins. I followed the recipe and added 1/2 tsp vanilla and a little cinnamon. Once I put them in the muffin pan I added some chocolate chips to half. They were surprisingly delicious. Even my 2yr old loved them.

These are great to make wheat free! Just use rice or spelt flour (or even coconut flour) in place of regular flour. I use less brown sugar and add about 2 TB honey. I also add ground flax seeds, cinnamon and top with wheat free granola! YUM!!!!!!

These were fantastic! Delicately sweet, moist and filling. I added shredded carrot, chopped dried apples and dried cranberries, froze a batch, and they make the perfect breakfast on the way to work.

I was pleasantly surprised with the outcome of these muffins.  This was the first time I've baked with applesauce, I've always been skeptical, but not anymore.

I followed advice of others and used whole wheat flour and cut back on the oil.  I added blueberries and raspberries.  Definitely a feel good muffin!

Would make this whenever I need a muffin. Did a few changes 1 1/4 all brand cereal, + 1/4 c. flex seed  1 c. flour & 1/2 c whole wheat flour, 1/2 t. vanilla and a few nuts. They were a little thick so just added a little more applesauce. Thanks

These muffins are delicious.  In addition to the recipe I added 1/2 t. of cinnamon and nutmeg.  I also added one chopped banana and a handful of walnuts.  Another viewers suggestion of brushing honey over the tops while still warm, completed them.  The family loves them.  We will make these often!

These are great! Made them twice now, adding things both times. Used the ingredients as a base, but added in a bunch of stuff. I added applesauce, cinnamon, orange zest and the juice of an orange (just bc they were a little dry the first time). I also substituted 1 c. whole wheat flour for the flour portion, and egg whites instead of whole eggs. Tossed in some slivered almonds, chopped pecans and blueberries, just bc I had to get rid of them. 
I made 12 muffins and 9 "cookies"   Delish!

I thought there would be more apple flavor, but I think for this recipe, the apple sauce is more for moisture. I was initially disappointed thinking I was making a sweeter muffin, but these are very good for bran muffins. My company enjoyed them. I am giving a 3 rating for my own personal preference but they would easily get a 4-5 for anyone who enjoys bran muffins.

I couldn't give this 5 stars because I did make some changes, but with those changes these were excellent!  I switched out the flour for whole wheat flour.  I reduced the baking power and baking soda to 1 tsp each, and reduced the oil to 1 tbsp.  I added a cup or so of chopped fresh cranberries.  The applesauce I used was homemade, with just apples and a little cider.  It made an even dozen, so I'm not sure what kind of muffin pan the reviewer who said they had to 1.5x the recipe was using.  But they came out great!  I will definitely be making these again.

Yum.  I added a 1/4c of milk because I thought it was too thick, but after the 10 mins of sitting it was fine.  Added 1 c of blueberries.  A nice change from a bran or carrot muffin.

Perfect healthy snack for kids!  My pickiest eater loved these.  The variations I tried where 1 tsp cinnamon, 3/4 cups chocolate chips, 1/2 tsp vanilla, I also added 1 smashed banana and used olive oil for the veg. oil.

This is a delicious muffin and a great start to the day! I only gave it four stars because I made some modifications based on other reviewers' suggestions. I used whole wheat pastry flour rather than regular, 1 tsp. each of baking powder and baking soda, 1/2 cup Egg Beaters in place of the eggs, used only 3/4 cup of applesauce, and added a single serving (6 oz.) of vanilla soy yogurt. I sprinkled a little brown sugar and rolled oats on top - they look and taste great, I will definitely be making these again!

Excellent recipe. I used whole wheat flour instead of white flour. I also added half a cup slivered almonds. This recipe is so good and healthy that I make these muffins almost every week. This is perfect for people who are watching their diet; it doesn't add thousands of calories and keeps the cravings away.

Great base recipe! I added coconut, shredded carrots, raisins, ground flax seed and cinnamon to mine. (I like a lot of stuff in my bran muffins!). I found that I had them in the oven less than the recommended time (only about 15 minutes)

These are really good.  I made a few small changes, only used 1 tsp each baking powder and baking soda.  I also added 2 tblsp ground flax seed and 1/2 cup chocolate chips.  My kids really enjoyed them.

I enjoyed these but found them just a little bland.  I think this is a great base recipe to spruce up to suit your needs....will add raisins and cinnamon next time.

These turned out so satisfyingly muffin-like, I was happy. They look nice, have a great muffin texture, and taste good. I followed the recipe except instead of 2 eggs, I used Ener-G egg replacer (2 teaspoons dissolved in 4 tablespoons warm water) because I don't eat eggs. Oh, and I used wheat bran instead of oat bran and added some raisins.

LOVED it.  My changes:  Since I didn't have applesauce on hand I grated a whole apple into it.  I also substituted the all-purpose flour for whole wheat.  And to top it off, I also took the advice to sprinkle cinnamon sugar on top.  very tasty!  Thank you!

I added ground flax seed, cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice and a crumb topping (2 tbsp butter, 1/2 c oats, 1/2 c brown sugar, 1/4 c flour, 1/4 c chopped walnuts) and these were delicious!  I do think next time I will use more applesauce as other reviewers have suggested, as they were just a little bit dry.  And I think these would be yummy with chopped dates... will be giving that a try!  Great healthy recipe!

Moist and filling, but a bit bland by themselves. BUT that mens they are a great base for anything you might want to add. I have added diced pear, pecans, and chocolate chips to different batches. Very good!

I added raisins, walnuts, cinnamon, and vanilla.  The batter seemed too thick so I added 4 more ounces of applesauce.  I didn't have oat bran on hand but I did have wheat bran so I used that.  I baked mine about 20 minutes.  Turned out great.  Thanks for the recipe!

FANTASTIC!  Healthful, easy, and delicious!  I got about 36 mini muffins out of this batter.  I also added cinnamon, vanilla and dried cranberries.  I'm going to try it with chopped dried apricots, too.  Great with coffee!

MMMM, so yummy!  A very hearty muffin.  Cut both baking powder/soda down to 1tsp each, added 1 tsp cinnamon, only used one egg and also subbed some whole wheat flour for some of the white.  I also added some soaked raisins cuz I love them and my batch made 14 muffins.  Baked at 375 for about 15mins.  Will definitely make these again, thanks!

Just like others I changed things a bit. . .I didn't have oat bran - so substituted ground flax and bran (1/2 cup flax, 1 cup bran). Only used 2 tbls. oil, but added 4 tablespoons apple juice. Also tossed in 1 cup fresh blueberries. They're awesome!

I used Uncle Sam's Oat Bran cereal.  It has flax seed and isn't too expensive.  Also I used 1/2 all purpose flour and 1/2 whole wheat.  Recipe turned out great!  Little crunch, soft and moist!

On it's own, this is a rather bland and dry muffin. It needs a lot of help to be moist and tasty. I recommend adding extra applesauce and definitely some cinnamon. Chopped fruit also helps give it a little more character.

A friend gave me Oat Bran and I had no idea what to do with it. This was a great solution. I followed the other reviews and added more applesauce, cinnamon, vanilla and raisins in orange juice. Very tasty. I'll definitely be making these again soon.

I made a few modifications and they may not be the healthiest, but I'm pleased with the outcome. I substituted apple butter (the kind that has the same consistency as apple sauce) for apple sauce as I didn't realize I didn't have the sauce. Also, smashed up 2 bananas and mixed in, finally, added just over a cup of carob chips. Next time I'll try some of the other suggestions, like frozen berries or oj soaked cranberries.

Great! I made a few subs: peanut oil instead of veggie oil, half/ half whole wheat and all purpose flour, and 1 cup frozen blueberries instead of raisins. (the frozen ones keep most of their juice while baking.)
This recipe makes a healthy popular snack for my little boys, with only 1/2 cup of sugar for the whole batch! I love it!

I used fructose instead of brown sugar, as I've been trying to find an oat bran muffin that is still good for me, and good too.  This one does the trick.  I of course added cinnamon and some golden raisins soaked in apple juice with a cinnamon stick (they don't steal the moisture from the muffin that way I believe) to make it more to my taste, and they were absolutely wonderful.  A muffin I can have any day of the week without guilt. Thanks!

Dear Bron,
Your bran muffins were quite tasty! My boyfriend has digestive issues, and these really seem to help "get things moving." We found the recipe a bit too sweet, and would add less sugar and more applesauce for extra moisture. Also, Eric doesn't like nuts, so I add chopped pecans to the mix after pouring most of the muffins into the pan. We enjoyed these so much! Thanks again, Bron.
Sincerely,
Mimi

My new favorite muffin recipe. I did make a few changes while making them though. Instead of 1 1/2 cups of oat bran, I only added 1 cup (because I ran out oat bran) and I was very generous with the apple sauce. I also added 1 tblsp of cinnamon. They were very moist and sooo good

Simple and healthy, not overloaded with refined ingredients and fat. I sprinkled a coat of cinnamon and fresh ground sea salt over the top of the muffins before baking for extra flavor. A keeper. Thanks Bron!

These are pretty good.  I used light brown sugar because I didn't have dark brown and I used cinnamon applesauce.  I also added 1 tsp cinnamon, 1/2 tsp nutmeg, and 1/8 tsp cloves. They smelled delicious and tasted good too.

 They are  more like biscuits than muffins.

So light but filling. I used almond flour and Swerve Brown Sugar (all natural substitute) for gluten free and low sugar options. I added 1.5 cups chunky applesauce and mixed 1tsp cinnamon with 3 tsp of the Swerve Brown Sugar to sprinkle on top before baking. So almond flour has a few more calories than white flour but the Swerve brown sugar is zero calories compared to 15 calories/tsp of regular brown sugar. So this is an even lower calorie option than the recipe. Taste was wonderful!

Light, tasty. A little dry. I used 1/3 cup of oil and reduced the baking powder and baking soda to 1 tsp each. I also used a cup of mashed banana instead of applesauce (didn't have any in the house).

These were very mediocre. I made some of the changes recommended by increasing the oil and reducing the baking soda and baking powder. I added one cup of chopped fresh strawberries. But the muffins were extremely dry and virtually had no flavor. They were very difficult to eat because they continuously fell apart into crumbs. I may try using this basic recipe again but I need to figure out how  to make other changes to give more flavor and keep them from falling apart. I would also increase sugar since they really need a little sweetness.

Very good. Instead of oil, I used same amount of Greek yogurt. They came out great. I think I may try grating an apple and adding it for a little fruit texture. Raisins would also be nice but enjoyed them very much.

We have apple trees in our yard, so I'm always on the lookout for recipes that call for apple sauce or diced / sliced apples.
I didn't have any oat bran - so I used half wheat bran and half oatmeal. They turned out fine. I increased the amount of applesauce by about 1/4 cup because I had lots of applesauce. 
The applesauce was just apples - nothing else. I put all my cored apples in the slow cooker, covered it up and let it cook for about 4 hours. The sauce had just the right amount of natural sweetness.

This is a wonderful recipe.  I am gluten intolerant and I used gluten-free flour for the wheat flour.  It came out perfectly and tasted like normal food!  I couldn't tell the difference in taste between the regular recipe and gluten free!  This is my new favourite!

Delicious! Sweet but not too sweet. Healthy tasting but not too much. My very picky 8 year old took some convincing to try them, now he is begging me to make more!! I substituted an 8 oz plain yogurt for the apple sauce and added chocolate chips.

Made this yesterday.  After reading reviews took  several suggestions and put together.  Used almond flour instead of regular flour (same amount),  used 2 tablespoons of coconut oil, added 3 eggs instead of two, used gluten- free oat bran, decreased baking powder and baking soda to 1 teaspoon each, used organic cinnamon applesauce,  added 1/4 tsp of cloves and 1/2 tsp of cinnamon and added organic raisins and raw walnuts.  Increased baking time by 7 min.   I used a jumbo muffin pan and it made 7 muffins.  
Turned out great.   Gave 3 stars for base recipe  but give it 5 stars with the changes.

I really loved these muffins!  They're very filling and nutritious.  I listened to other reviewers and omitted the oil.  I added fresh blueberries to the mix, and they were bursting with every bite!

I got 18 nice size muffins out of the recipe,  froze some and shared with friends. The frozen muffins thawed nicely in the fridge and we're ready to eat cold or with a light toast in the toaster oven.  

I'm about to make another batch now!

I used mashed banana instead of applesauce. Totaled I used three, but could've added yet another for an even moister, sweeter muffin. Also threw in a cup of blueberries. Served toasted with butter and maple syrup and it was a hit. On the whole a fantastic recipe for playing around with!!

I added an extra egg ( only because I read the recipe wrong haha) and I didn't measure my oil or apple sauce (I went by eye). So they were slightly dry. I think if I actually measure correctly and bake them a little less- they will be perfect! It's a really good bran muffin, just what I was looking for :)  Can't wait to try it with fruit inside next time.

This was my first time cooking with oat bran and so the only thing I changed was adding the oat bran to the liquids while I did the rest of the recipe. (I read somewhere that this makes the results moister.) Due to that, I didn't bother letting the batter sit for any additional time before baking. Will definitely make again!

Based on previous reviews I made the following modifications- 1.5 cups applesauce, 2 tbsp oil, only 1 tsp each baking powder and baking soda, added 1 tsp each cinnamon and vanilla, and a cup of chopped walnuts. I let the oat bran soak in the applesauce for 10 minutes to soften then added the rest of the ingredients. I also topped half of them with cinnamon sugar. They turned out great- moist, not too sweet, nice flavor. I really liked the cinnamon sugar topping for the extra flavor & sweetness, my husband isn't into the sweet so he liked the ones without. I will definitely make these again!

A lot of people are rating this at 4 or 5 stars...with extensive changes. Pretty sure the very definition of a not good recipe is having to completely change it to make it good. I suppose it's a decent starting point, but I'm pretty sure the recipe made exactly as is falls somewhere between "bland" and "awful". Once you completely change almost every single ingredient amount and add several seasonings though, yes, it makes a pretty good muffin.

CHANGES I MADE: Following various suggestions, I halved the amount of baking powder/soda, used 1.5 cups applesauce, hydrated the oat bran in the applesauce for 10 min while mixing the other dry ingredients, added 1 tsp cinnamon (will prob use 2 tsp next time), used butter instead of oil. As these were for my husband who is allergic to wheat, I also used gluten free AP flour. The flour I used has xanthan gum in it, and the final texture seemed fine without adding more. When mixing the wet and dry ingredients, I found the batter to be waaaayyyy too dry, and added 1/4 cup milk. Batter still ended up closer to drop cookie dough consistency than muffin batter, but it did rise OK and was not too dense. I also started the oven at 400 degrees and dropped it to 375 once the muffins were in, cooking them for about 25 minutes (this longer baking time really seems to help even out the tendency for gluten free baked goods to end up way too moist). Moisture level with these changes was just about right for me--moist without being soggy. Apple flavo

This is a great recipe! I always add  1.5 tsp cinnamon, a mashed banana and one coarsely grated golden delicious apple. The apple greatly improves the texture. This ends up making 18 muffins, using the red-handled food scoop.

I've been making these muffins since 2011. Not only do they taste good, they are low calorie. The only thing I do different is add a cup of frozen blue berries and sprinkle cinnamon/sugar mixture on top.

I did not make any changes to the recipe.  I have an extremely picky eater and was ecstatic that he LOVES them (at 4).  They were a hit with the entire family!!
(Also tried them as cookies...as another person suggested, but they are definitely muffin texture.)

Makes a great base recipe.  I've now started making these weekly and packing them in my lunch, and sometimes eating them as late night snacks.  I've replaced the brown sugar with splenda blend brown sugar, used whole wheat flour, and am using chia seeds as an egg substitute.  I use 1.5 cups of unsweetened applesauce, and eliminate the oil all together as another reviewer had mentioned.  I premix the oat bran with the applesauce and let sit for 15 minutes also as another reviewer mentioned to help soften the texture of the oat bran.  I also followed the suggestion to add 1 cup of plumped raisins with raisin water, and cinnamon which really takes these to the next level!

I subbed apple sauce for the oil & gluten free baking mix (cup 4 cup to flour) for the flour to create a gluten free treat for myself! Adding cinnamon & frozen cranberries to the batter plus heaping amounts of cinnamon-sugar & drops of honey on top made this my new go to muffin recipe! This was super fast & easy. I can't wait to make other variations! Note: these were a bit dense, but I assume the gluten free baking mix had a bit to do with that. They were very good & a great base for experimenting with other variations.

Excellent but I did change a few things. Substituted one cup milk for one cup non-fat plain Greek yogurt, half cup of wheat flour for half cup oat bran. Increased brown sugar to 3/4 cup. And substituted blueberries for 1/2-3/4 cup chocolate chips to be sure my kids would eat.  I'm simply looking to increase fiber and protein in our diets. I think I'll try substituting brown sugar for molasses at some point and mix back in fresh berries. Great fluffy consistency, not dry like store-bought bran muffins. Yum!

These are quite good. After reading some reviews, I made some modifications.  I used wheat bran, not oat bran, since I didn't have any. I used white whole wheat flour, reduced the baking powder and soda to 1.5 tsp each, used 1.5 c applesauce. I also added 1 tsp vanilla, 2 tsp cinnamon, and 1 tsp nutmeg. I let the bran soak with the applesauce for quite a while, and added the baking soda and powder and dry ingredients at the end and mixed til combined. I greased the muffin tin with coconut oil.  Next time I think I'll add chopped apples or plumped raisins, add some molasses, or use pumpkin instead of applesauce since some juiciness would make them more scrumptious.  I also sprinkled the top with cinnamon and sugar. Next time I might sprinkle the top with oats, butter, sugar, and cinnamon. The kids gobbled them up and demanded one in the lunchbox tomorrow.

Thank you for the great recipe! I had a ton of oat bran laying around, and needed something to do with it!

My alterations were kind of based on what I had around, so I'm sorry for all of the changes! They worked alright for me, though, so I thought I'd share:

Put eggs, oil (I used corn oil), and 1 tablespoon vanilla extract into blender. Cut up three medium sized apples (I did NOT peel them) and added to blender ingredients. Blended until apple skins were confetti-sized. Added to mixing bowl with dry ingredients (I reduced the baking soda to 1 teaspoon, and omitted salt). Added 1.5 teaspoons cinnamon, 1/2 teaspoon allspice, and 1/4 teaspoon ginger.

I don't have a muffin pan, so I poured it into a regular bread pan (greased) and baked at 325 for an hour. Not bad! Turned out as a muffin-y, fiber-full bread!

Yum! I subbed a cup of mashed bananas for the applesauce, threw in a little more oil, and used 3 tsp of baking soda as I didn't have any powder. With cinnamon sugar sprinkled on top right before baking they're just the right amount of sweet.

I've made this recipe with blueberries and also with cranberry/orange. I make a double batch, as we like bigger muffins. I add at least 3 cups of fruit in a double batch. I also add a container of plain, non-fat Greek yogurt, keep the baking powder and baking soda as in the recipe and my muffins are nice and moist. I also use a brown sugar/sucralose blend, egg substitute, and cannola oil to make them more healthy, and sprinkle a bit of turbinado sugar on the top.

I also made some changes - only use 1 tsp of baking powder and baking soda - really helps with the moist factor. I added a little extra surgar as well. I had a little pumpkin puree left over from a soup I made, so instead of apple sauce, I used about 3/4 cups of that and then added a few tablespoons of greek yogurt.  The dough seemed a little too stiff, so I added about 4 tbs. of water. And while I was adding pumpkin, why not a tsp of cinnamon? oh - and I too used whole wheat flour. I served them at a brunch with butter - they were a hit.

Great recipe. My 4 year old loved them. I followed the recipe but changed up a few thing. Instead of applesauce I used sour cream and added 1 cup of oats in replace of 1/2 cup flour and bran. We also added dried cranberries, blueberries and raisins. Love them

These are SO GOOD. I followed the advice of others and subbed in some yogurt for the applesauce (about 3/4c apple sauce and I just used a 6oz personal sized plain yogurt.) I also added plumped cranberries in this instead of the suggested alteration of raisins. I love the pockets of sweet/tart. These are AMAZING. Will definitely make them again.

Used cinnamon applesauce and vanilla yogurt and only one egg.  Good muffins and nice source of fiber.  Could use a little more flavor, maybe by adding more spices or some dried fruits and nuts.

Love these, but I must admit I add other things, like applesauce, dried cranberries and toasted sliced almonds. It's a great recipe for a basic bran muffin that lets you add a little creativity without any harm.

Very yummy.  I'm one of those people that has a hard time following recipes due to either not having the ingredients or feeling a creative need to change things up a bit.  My tweaking included half applesauce and half yougart. Spelt flour instead or regular. I didn't have enough oat bran so I ground up bran buds and used those as well. I added craisins, blueberries and chocolate chips as well.  It came out well, except that most of the muffins broke as I took them out of the pan. Either way, they taste great.

Great recipe! I followed another's advice and only added one egg, and put in 1/2 c vanilla yogurt. I also added 1t vanilla, a sprinkle of cinnamon, and cut the baking soda and powder down to 1t each. It made more than 12 muffins though, so I'm saving the rest for another day this week. I hope they turn out well.

These are great! I used 1.5 of baking soda and powder because of the suggestions, I didn't see any problem. I also added a little extra applesauce just in case. My favorite with bran muffins and what I would suggest adding is berries. I buy frozen mixed berries from Trader Joe's. It tastes like Jesus incarnate. I just ate a muffin that had been in my fridge for 2 weeks and was still nice and moist.

These are AMAZING. I love the taste and texture of oat bran in muffins. I used whole wheat pastry flour and substituted splenda for half of the brown sugar. Also added vanilla extract, and threw in some chopped walnuts and mini chocolate chips. Yummy! I also halved the baking powder/soda as earlier reviews suggested. I let them sit about 10 minutes and thought they were plenty moist. I even overbaked them a little on accident (whoops) but they are still good and I can't wait to make them again! Thanks for the recipe.

Nice muffin.  I added ~1/4 cup ground flax seed in place of one Tbs oil, and threw in a few handfuls of raisins & walnuts, and a tsp of vanilla.  It requires careful checks on the baking time -- test with a toothpick, because the top will be browned and nearly crunchy before the inside is totally cooked.

Excellent muffin but I love Oat Bran and eat it every morning for breakfast. This recipe is also good made with wheat flour and add some gold raisins that have been soaked in apple juice with a cinnamon stick.

Very tasty and healthy!  I used homemade applesauce, added a couple TBSP of wheat germ, subbed 1/2 c flour with whole wheat flour, added just a touch of apple cider, and sprinkled cinnamon sugar on top before baking.

This is one of my family's favorite muffin recipes!  I also add cinnamon (1+teaspoons), and have made them with equal success with light and dark brown sugar. They are positively wonderful with strawberry preserves!

This recipe tastes great.  I added about 1/2 bag of frozen blueberries to give it a little something extra and they turned out awesome.

These muffins are very moist, but didn't have a lot of flavour.  However...knowing that bran is not exactly chocolate chip muffins...it puts it in perspective:-)  I did not change the recipe itself.  But I served these with cinnamon sugar and lite butter, which really livens them up.  Thank you!

I thought these were great.  I added cinnamon and walnuts and a little extra applesauce.  Most bran muffins are dry and flat.  These were delicious.

I loved these muffins and so did my one year old who is very picky when it comes to food. I made these with homemade applesauce and added 1 tsp. cinammon as suggested.
