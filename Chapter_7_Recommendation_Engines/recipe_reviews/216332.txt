I loved these.  They were so incredibly easy and fast.  I did make a few changes.  I doubled the vanilla, skipped the jam, and used about a 1/4 c heavy cream instead of the evaporated milk.  They were lovely.  Let them cool until just barely warm and then served with a scoop of ice cream.  They were a huge hit!

I tried it and it was great. The jam was also good but next time I won't put any sugar in it as it was to sweet, I also added some vanilla and almond which give it a good flaver.

This has been a family favourite for many years. I find the amount of filling works best with the 3 inch tart shells, with just enough to fill a dozen. Sometimes I will use cherry jam in the bottom and those ones will get a thin icing topped with half a glaze or maraschino cherry, otherwise, raspberry jam and no frosting.

It was very good but I did lessen the sugar a tad and instead of butter, I used coconut oil and halved the vanilla and used 1/2 tsp almond extract.  I also used my own sour cherry/saskatoon jam.  It was excellent and not too sweet.

I liked it and my husband loved them.  The amount of jam given in the recipe is not enough and the last time I made them, I used huckleberry jam.  Yum.  I have also used Wild Plum Jam and that was also superb.

These were delicious.  I used coconut sugar and they turned out really well.  Making again for sure!
