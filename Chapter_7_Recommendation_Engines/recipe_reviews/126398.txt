White wine or chicken broth can be used in place of the cooking sherry. (Might want to use low-salt or homemade chicken stock, as the cream-of soups can be a bit salty.) To stretch this further, add a sliced onion and another can of mushrooms. This is a very cost-effective recipe I make in the crockpot often, varying the ingredients I have in my pantry. Chicken can be bought marked down and most of the ingredients called for can be bought at a discount grocery store or the dollar store. It's great for energy conservation as the crockpot costs less to power than your stove. I like it over mashed potatoes, kids like it on rice or over egg noodles.

I changed a few things on this recipe. I left off the celery flakes and instead of canned mushrooms I chopped up fresh ones. I added a chopped onion which I sauteed with garlic and the mushrooms before I added it to the soup mix. As an afterthought I added some rosemary (didn't measure) and was glad I did.

I couldn't find anyone who sold celery flakes, so I used parsley flakes instead. I also added some rosemary as one of the other reviewers suggested, and doubled the garlic (never can have enough garlic in my opinion). It turned out very nice. The sherry gives it a nice rich edge. Served it over brown rice. A nice dish that I'll be making again.

I personally played a lot with this one. I read the reviews and took some ideas from those.
Instead of the cream of chicken soup and celery flakes I used one can of cream of celery soup and instead of cream of mushroom soup I used 2 cans of roasted garlic and mushroom soup. I used fresh garlic and I used a little extra because..well Im a fan haha. I am also a cheese lover so there was a little extra parm and I threw some mozz in there too. 
I had fun with it. It came out amazing! The chicken fell completely apart and my friends were really wow'ed. Im not a cook so this was a huge victory for me! Thank you so much for this amazing recipe it was a great crowd pleaser and I plan to make it again very soon! 
To all that give a negative review...play with it a little. Add some of your favorite stuff if the flavor wasnt good enough for you. Its a great way to learn what you like and build your own recipe book!

I thought this was really good, although I have made a variation of this recipe in the oven for years, and use mozzarella for it, and decided to use it instead of parm in this recipe.  Just put the mozzarella cheese in about 30 mins before serving, and just a touch of parm (after it's plated), and it is great.  Just a suggestion for all of you who aren't fans of the sherry & parm together.

I browned 1/4 C. onion and 1 clove garlic on medium heat.  Browned the breasts in Basil & Garlic Grapeseed oil.  Used cream of celery in lieu of chicken soup.  Added extra shrooms and 1 t. rubbed sage.  It all added up to one very fine dining experience!!

I made this the other night and got pretty good reviews with it. I left out the sherry and parmesan but put some parmesan on mine after it was on my plate. It was in the crockpot for about 9 hours and was so tender it was falling apart perfectly. I served it over chicken noodles and got requests to make it again.

I thought the recipe was fantastic. I followed the ingredients and the method in which this dish was prepared exactly as it showed so I can build a baseline for myself just in case I want to change it. I have to say, I made this for my wife and kids and it came out perfect. I set my crock pot to the lowest setting and it was fantastic. I will make this dish again with pork chops and I have no doubt it will be a hit.

This recipe was ok. My family enjoyed it enough. It was very bland though.  Next time I will add more spices.  Good starter recipe.

my family are very picky eaters.  I cooked egg noodles and placed chicken and sauce over noodles; everyone loved it.  Easy cockpot meal.  I put chicken in frozen and let cook all day.  I cooked a double batch and it fed 13 people without a problem!  I had some for leftovers and it reheated just as good in microwave.

I made this for a quick and easy dinner on a very busy day.  This turned out much better than I expected.  I am not a big fan of canned soup in dishes but they have a time and a place. I used white wine instead of the sherry and used real mushrooms instead of canned since I had them on hand.  I would make this again for a night when we are busy but short on time for cooking.

My family loved this! I used 2 cans of cream of mushroom. It was a little soupy, but I made it with mashed potatoes, so I had instant gravy. YUM I baked it in the oven @400 for 45 minutes

It was good, but this is the first time I have ever cooked with wine or sherry so I wasn't ready for the strong flavor.  It had a strong flavor but also seemed a little bland.  It was good, just not really for my taste.

Used white wine, rosemary not celery spice, no mushrooms because I didn't have any.  Served on egg noodles.  Awesome.  The only reason I gave it a four out of five is because crock pot chicken meals all kind of seem similar to me.  This one exceeded my expectations.

Very interesting recipe! Also pretty flexible in terms of substituting ingredients (I used cream of celery soup instead of cream of chicken, and used celery seeds instead of flakes). Also, since I did not have sherry or white wine, I ended up using 1/4 cup mirin (Japanese rice wine) and 1/4 cup broth (since I didn't know how the mirin would do, I was hesitant to use 1/2 cup of it). Well, I learned that you need to use the full 1/2 cup of wine or sherry (or in my case, mirin) because the sugar contained therein will balance out the saltiness from the soups and cheese. So as a result, I did find it a bit salty, but I think it would have been less so if the recipe was followed more precisely. Will probably use this again.

I used white wine instead of the sherry as other reviews suggested (more than 1/2 a cup).  I also used fresh shredded parm cheese, not the grated kind.  I added Rosemary, a little bit of rubbed sage, ground pepper, one can of cream of mushroom soup and one can of cream of celery soup, paprika, parsley flakes and a little bit of celery seed (didn't have celery flakes) and a good amount of minced garlic (way more than one teaspoon).  I use whatever I have on hand to make this and my family loves it.  The white wine adds such a nice flavor that I actually don't like to make it unless I have some dry white white.  I used Sutter Home Chardonnay this time.  I also added a can of mushrooms.  I used frozen chicken breasts and cook on high for 4-5 hours.  If I have fresh chicken, I cook on low for 7-8 hours.  I like this over rice or egg noodles.  Awesome, satisfying comfort food!  Make it your way...enjoy!

I made this my very first time using a crock pot. I changed it up a bit. Used chicken broth instead of sherry, added an onion, and used garlic jack cheese instead of parmesean. It was outstanding. Thank you for the recipe!

I halved this recipe so only used one can cream of mushroom soup.  I used regular dry sherry and left out the mushrooms since I am not a fan.  My husband and I both enjoyed this recipe over egg noodles.

This recipe was real good. The only thing I would do differently is lay off the celery flakes a bit. Other than that it was absolutely perfect!

Like other recipes, I have had this in my recipe box for some time.  So I finally made it and it was terrific.  I made a few slight changes based on necessity.  I had no celery flakes so I used parsley.  That was fine.  I only had a cut up chicken so I used that.  I prefer it.  The bones and the skin gave lots of flavor. and the skin just peeled away. Finally,  I used fresh mushrooms even though I had the canned ones.  I way prefer them and they gave this recipe a wonderful depth of flavor.  I will be making this again.

BTW, celery flakes are sold thru Amazon. I added a cup of celery, used celery soup, added a tsp. of chopped garlic, a pkg of Italian dressing, When almost done  add a block of cream cheese, cook for about 15 min or when it is softened it is ready to put over rice or noodles.  Tonight I am putting it over sweet potatoes!

Flavor of sherry is strong in this.  if you do not like that, I'd suggest cutting the sherry by half.  Me and my husband loved this served over rice.

Made this as written. The chicken is a little dry. It could use some pepper as well. Other than that it's an overall good meal. We served it over rice.

This is a good base recipe. I changed it up a little because I had some things on hand that I thought went well with this recipe. I used fresh mushrooms and some asparagus since I had them. I also minced an onion and a clove of garlic, sauteed them & mixed into the cream of mushroom and cream of chicken soups. I  added a dollop of cream cheese to the grated parmesan and soup mixture (YUM!). I used red cooking wine instead of sherry because that's what I had. I also added a little rosemary and extra paprika too. I didn't have celery flakes and it was still very good! I will definitely make this again.

Made this tonight for dinner and my husband was pleasantly surprised how good it was. I served it over brown rice with green beans and almonds on the side. I think next time I'll add more mushrooms (big veggie fans in this house), maybe some fresh onion for a litte more flavor, and use a little less sherry. This meal has definite potential to move into my rotation for fuss free workweek dinners.

I made this with reduced sodium canned soup and no salt added canned mushrooms. I used around 2.5 pounds of fresh chicken breast. I did not have celery flakes so I used 1/2 tsp celery seed. I did not have grated cheese so I used fresh shredded parm cheese. I really do think the sherry is the key ingredient here. I let it comingle in the crock pot for 12 hours on low. The chicken was juicy and falling apart with a fork. This had such a rich delicious flavor! Makes a terrific gravy so decided to serve with a side of mashed potatoes.

We did not like this at all.  The flavors just didn't seem to go good together, it may be that it was too much wine compared to the other ingredients.  Plus the parm and the wine flavors weren't good together.  It was definitely easy, and for that I give it some stars, but we didn't like the flavor.  We won't be making it again, thanks anyways.

The chicken came out tender, but the sauce was reduced pretty much. That was because I  didn't make a whole recipe. I think if anyone is going to cook a half or a third of a recipe, reduce the time too.

I made this tonight and put it over egg noodles and I will absolutely make this more often. I have made many chicken recipes using canned soup and they all basically taste the same. The use of sherry I think placed this one up to the next level. I used cream of celery in place of the cream of chicken and celery flakes and a small bag of sliced frozen mushrooms instead of canned. It was a bit soupy so I may use something to thicken it up next time or try it over potatoes or rice. Delicious!

I made it and it was very good. I got home from the store and realized I forgot the sour cream. I used a little light cream, chicken broth and white wine. I added the rosemary but it’s a pain picking it out of the dish before serving.

I followed the recipe exactly.  It was edible, but it smelled like vomit while cooking.  My husband refused to even eat it based on the smell, and went out for takeout.  I was adventurous and gave it a try - and it tasted "okay".  The meat turned out nice and tender.  The flavor just wasn't super.   I probably won't make this one again.

Great! I tweaked a bit but followed the main steps. This is an excellent recipe! Used white wine vs. sherry, added 3 fresh cloves garlic and a med. onion (sautéed in garlic with garlic canola oil), 2 cans mushrooms and used rosemary. For the Parmesan, I used 1/4 c pecorino and 1/4 c shredded asiago. Then I topped the chicken with mozzarella 1/2 hr before we ate. Served over brown rice with Brussel sprouts

I added onion powder and a little oregano. For some odd reason, I'm out of paprika but I didn't know it till now. So, I left it out. I also cooked it on high for the last 2 hours to have it done  dinner. 
This was great. The chicken fell apart in the crock pot. This is a busy day go-to keeper.

Pretty good.  Easy to make.  Chicken was a little dry and was taken out just before 8 hour mark.  Would make again.  Husband didn't like it, also felt chicken was dry.

Tree this together in the morning, didn't have celery seed so substituted cream of celery I lieu of cream of chicken. As some reviewers, I added a small thinly sliced onion and some rosemary. Shredded the chicken and threw in. a handful of shredded Italian cheese ( mozzarella mix). served over angel hair. Rave reviews from my family. This will go into my rotation. Super easy and flavorful. You can definitely tweak it to suit your mood or whatever ingredients you have on hand!

This was really good for as easy as it was. The chicken very tender. I used fresh mushrooms and I only had 1/4 cup sherry so I also used 1/4 cup white cooking wine. Served over bow tie pasta.

I added two more cans of cream of mushroom. The chicken lets out quite a bit of liquid (water) so I felt it needed to be thickened up. I would also use chicken thighs next time to make it tastier. Good recipe though .

This was great and easy!  I used what was in my cabinets, so I substituted fresh baby bella mushrooms, parsley flakes and cooking white wine instead of the canned mushrooms, celery flakes and cooking sherry.  I did cook it on low for 7 hours and kept it warm for 2-3 and the chicken was perfect.

After reading the reviews, I too made some changes and I was so pleased with the results! I doubled the soup so I had 2 cream of chicken and 2 cream of mushroom soups. The night before, I sauteed two 8 ounce packages of fresh mushrooms with two fresh cloves minced along with half of a large yellow onion finely chopped. So in the morning, I placed 8 chicken breasts, with all of the ingredients as described except I too couldn't find celery flakes, so I used parsley flakes. I did use the cooking sherry and it was delicious! Thank you so much!

Great meal loved by my family. I changed a few things by reading reviews and it helped. Came out delicious! I used Cream of Celery instead of the flakes and in place of cream of chicken. I also used chicken broth in place of the Sherry. I also used low sodium chicken broth and the soups were Fit and Active brand as to lower the sodium. I served with brown rice and steamed broccoli. Recommend using fresh mushrooms and some pepper. Love this! Easy Meal for the family when busy! :) Enjoy!

Very salty without adding any extra salt (just the condensed soup). Added extra mushrooms (fresh) and an onion. Doubled all the spices. Ended up being yummy comfort food...not life changing, but perfect for dinner on a cold night.

It was ok, I wouldn't call it a cheesy mushroom dish. I was expecting a creamy meal and it was kind of bland and didn't have that mushroom flavor I was hoping. Will try again though and make some revisions.

Sure easy and cook time of 8 hours was perfect.  I followed some suggestions and used cream of celery instead of celery flakes and cream of chicken and cream of mushroom with roasted garlic.  I also used chicken broth instead of cherry.  I served it over rice and had green beans on the side.  this recipe will be added to my box for a easy "chicken and rice" kind of night

My husband is not a fan of mushrooms but this is his FAVORITE recipe with mushrooms!!!  I also want to add that the 3lb bag of chicken breast puts enough in the pot to feed 5+.  Instead of trying to buy the expensive chicken breast, I get mine at Wal Mart!!  It saves a little money for a really good recipe!  THANK YOU CHEF ROBBY!

I made this recipe with a whole chicken, cut-up and browned in a skillet, 2 large portabello mushrooms (gills scraped out), sliced and sauted with garlic, and fresh shitake mushrooms. After removing the chicken pieces, I stirred in 3 Tbsp mixed with a little water to thicken the juice into a gravy. I left out the parma cheese.  The chicken was very tender but the gravy was very bland and I couldn't taste even a hint of the sherry.  Perhaps the parma cheese is the key ingredient that adds the flavor the dish lacked?  It really needed salt and some tang.

The first time I made this, I accidentally waited too late in the morning so wound up baking it in the oven. My husband LOVED it and the boys (7 & 12) thought it was okay. I thought it was very tasty. Made it in the crock a couple days ago; yum!
