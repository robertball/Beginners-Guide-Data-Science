This was pretty good, though I did make a few minor changes. I added 3 cloves of garlic (minced) which I sauteed with the onion and pepper, and I added a bit of Italian seasoning to the sauce.  After mixing everything together as in step 3, I put it in a casserole dish, sprinkled mozzarella cheese on top, and put it in the oven just long enough to melt the cheese. It was greatly enjoyed by my family, and was very easy to make.

My family loved this recipe!  They want it twice a month.  I used a pound of medium-hot sausage and light sour cream.  I kept the pasta seperate from the sauce, so I could reheat the sauce days later and serve it with fresh pasta.  Delicious!

Okay my husband REALLY turned up his nose at this as I was making it, but loved it once he tried some. The only modification I made to this recipe was to use spicy sausage (bulk) instead of ground pork; the change was perfect.

Great, flexible recipe that's just different enough to make this a truly pleasant change from the usual jar + box weekday pasta routine. We've found that using half-and-half gives a more silky end result. Many thanks for sharing this 'new classic' in our menu rotation!

This recipe really depends on the type of pasta sauce you use. Make sure you use one with some extra flavour, herbs and spices going on and a thicker, more tomatoey sauce.

It was ok....I added garlic,some ground sage to make the pork more "sausage like" and 1 tsp of sugar(the spag sauce i had on hand was a little too savory, & w/the whole "creamy" theme, it needed a softening to the acidity) Was good enough for a quick weeknight meal(soccer practice forces me into simple mode on such nights)

This is a good standard recipe. We enjoyed the ground pork as it was something a bit different. I only had half the amount of sour cream and it still worked out fine. It's a keeper, but I do think I will try a mild spiced sausage one time to see if it gives it a little more kick.

Definately easy & quick to make and tasty. I substituted diced boneless chicken breast for the pork, and it was very good.

WOW!  I was a little leary at first, because we are not big fans of bell peppers.  I am so glad i followed the recipe almost to a "T".  It was fantastic!  We loved the creaminess of the tomatoe sauce and the taste was awesome.  The only thing we did different was to add some grated mozzarella cheese to the top and put in under the broiler until the cheese was bubbly.... YUM!  This is one of our new faves!

This was good, but nothing to write home about.  Maybe because I made a few changes.  Like another reviewer, I too used spaghetti noodles and left out the sour cream (hubby's not a big fan).  I also used ground beef rather than pork because I've always done it that way.  I'm sure I'll make again because this is just so quick and simple.  Thanks for sharing April.

This was ok, but I make something similar to this that we prefer.  For the sauce I melt an 8 oz package of cream cheese into a jar of spaghetti sauce (homemade--but store bought would be fine) and if needed thin out the sauce with some of the pasta water .  I also use Italian sausage instead of just ground pork and just put the onion and peppers in with the meat to give it more flavor instead of sauteing them separately. I also add minced garlic or some garlic paste for more flavor.

I made exactly as is, except when I started adding the pasta to the sauce I felt that it was too much, so I kept out some of the noodles to make the dish saucier. The dish was good, but the bell pepper didn't add much of a different flavor than if you didn't use it. However, adding 'silent' veggies is always a plus! My hubby won't eat peppers if he can pick them out, but he didn't notice them in this dish. As advertised, this is was definitely a fast, easy dish! Barely any more work than regular spaghetti in meat sauce. It is a good basic dish

This was tasty but it didn't stick out in my mind. I added a box of frozen spinach that was thawed & didn't measure the tomato sauce, I just dumped it in till the consistency was right. May or may not make again.

Had to make some substitutions because we were running low on supplies...left the onions out and used yellow bell pepper instead of green.  Next time I'll make sure to have everything on hand.  This was excellent and so quick to prepare.

My Family loved this - even the picky 16 year old!  The only adjustment I made was to add pesto to the sauce right before mixing with the pasta.  I also used the leftover filling from dinner the previous nite - Beef & Bean Chimichangas!  Yummy!

A nice twist on plain spaghetti. I had some frozen spaghetti sauce so I did an ingredient search and found this. I used half sour cream and half plain yogurt to make it a little healthier. I had to add fresh grated asiago and cracked pepper at the end to suite my taste.

After stopping at Big Y, S & S, I finally found some Sweet Italian Sausage to use with this recipe at Shaws Supermarket. Instead of just breaking up the sausage, I used a food processor to chop it even further. This, mixed with the tomato sauce and sourcream made mixing with the pasta quite easy. I used 24 oz of sauce to give better coating on pasta. With only my wife and I, and two boys 11 and 13, I barely have enough left to take to work tomorrow. They all loved it. It is definitely a keeper.   I cook at my church Community Dinner nights, where we serve 150 people every Wed night. I want to make this for one of those nights, but am not sure how to keep the pasta from overcooking, as we serve over a 45 - 60 minute period, but all the food needs to be ready at the same time. Any advice would be appreciated.

My family really enjoyed this. It is a form of lasagna to me. I did  make a few changes. I had a 14 oz jar of pizza sauce that I  mixed with the spaghetti sauce. I also added 3 cloves (minced) of garlic with the onion and butter. I had no green pepper on hand. The garlic really added flavor. And I did not have pork so I used ground beef. I also added some oregano and garlic powder for more italian flavoring. (I had no italian seasoning  on hand.) I added mozzerella and parmesan towards the end. It was easy, flavorful, delicious, and makes great leftovers!

This is to me spaghetti sauce and sour cream. Want to make this recipe really good, add half a package of CREAM CHEESE instead, it melts into the tomato sauce beautifully and gives a better flavour.

Delicious. I used 3 cheese spaghetti sauce and mixed with the ground pork and sour cream, the flavor was wonderful. My 23 month old son asked for seconds and thirds and fourths! A new family dish!

Very good, and lends itself easily to substitutions.  I omitted the bell pepper, and added more onion.  I also added approx. 2c spinach while I was sauteeing the onions, and some crushed red pepper when I added the spaghetti sauce.  Delicious!

I loved this recipe.  Since I'm vegetarian I left out the meat, but I did add veggies.  Great taste and quick meal.  Would make again.

This recipe is not SUPER exciting, but has a little bell pepper flair that we liked (we are not bell pepper fans). This is definitely a quick, tasty alternative to spaghetti.

I made this dish and Artichoke Spinach Lasagna from this site, for a buffet dinner for 15 people.  The meat-eaters loved the penne.  I did top it with some mozzarella cheese and put it in the oven for a few minutes, before serving.  Quick easy meal!!  Thanks!

This was an easy and good pasta dish. My whole family loved it. I used spaghetti instead of penne and replaced ground pork with bulk sausage. Thank you for the recipe.

Turned out nicely after adding additional seasoning. Agree with other viewer that you should start with a sauce more on the bold tomato side. I used canned generic brand pasta sauce not the named brand spaghetti sauce.
I can't add a photo because Everyone pounced on it as soon as I was done and there are no leftovers.

This is freaking amazing. I left out the onion because my fiancé is allergic, but it is still absolutely delicious. I also started putting cream of mushroom in the sauce as well as the sour cream and this dish is a staple in my house now. My favorite pasta to use is radiatore, but that might just be because it looks funny.

Tweaked to taste. For ease in cleaning I browned pork, garlic & onion in deep cast iron skillet and made my own sauce in same pan with meat while pasta boiled. Drained pasta and added into skillet. Topped with mozzarella and baked till cheese melted. Yum!

This was sooo good. With every bute I said "this is delicious". The only thing I did different is; I seasoned my pasta water with sakt and italian seasoning ( I do this gor all my pastas even fetuccine) seasoned my ground pork with salt, pepper snd Italian seasoning and I added ketchup and sugar to my sauce.  This one is a keeper and super easy

I did it a little different I used half hamburger meat and a little italian sausage, I used half and half and added 3 cloves of garlic and a little italian seasoning. I did put it in a casserole dish sprinkled mozzarella and put it in the oven for about 10 minutes. It was delicious and I will definitely make it again!

Very easy and very tasty.  I do think, like others have done, that it would be good to add a bit of fresh garlic.  I Alos used light sour cream which was fine.

This was pretty easy and fast to make.  I thought it was pretty good, I will make it again but next time make some changes to it.  It was great eating it freshly made but it definitely dried out by the next day.  I'll be sure to make extra sauce next time so I can add to it as needed for leftovers.

I used ground beef I needed to use up, and added Italian seasoning like some other commenters suggested. I also let the sauce simmer for 15 minutes with the cooked ground beef and onions. 
But I will make again! It's delicious, and I would love to try it with the ground pork next time. I will say that the amount of sauce seems small compared to the whole pound of pasta. I might make less pasta next time.

This was definitely fast and good. I followed reviewers suggestions and added fresh garlic and spices including red pepper flakes.  I also used venison burger because it was what I had , plain spaghetti sauce and 1 can of petite diced tomatoes.  Let it reduce  and added sour cream.  Got good reviews from tough household critics! Thanks for the recipe.

I   used 5 cloves of garlic, about a teaspoon of Italian seasoning ,  half teaspoon red pepper  flakes and dried Basil. Instead of pork, I substituted  a 1.5 lbs of hot Italian  sausage. Received numerous  compliments, I will definitely  make this dish again.

Really quick  & yummy. I chopped the bell pepper very fine & kids didn't even know it was there. I used 1 lb mild Italian sausage (cut off the casings & chopped it up a bit before adding to pan) and the slight spice really enhanced the dish. Because it was mild it was just right for the kids (ages 9, 11 slightly picky eaters).  Will make again, thank you for sharing this great family recipe!

This was a great, quick meal. I made a few changes: I added celery, mushrooms and 3 cloves garlic to the onion and pepper. I also used ground Italian sausage instead of ground pork and used 24oz of spaghetti sauce.  I will definitely be making this again.

I made this last night and my kitchen still smells amazing this morning.  I used a full box of whole wheat penne, which is only 13.25 oz, but used a whole can of spaghetti sauce, which was 24 oz.  This sauce to pasta ratio seemed to work out fine.  I also used a whole yellow onion in place of the white onion and green bell pepper.  I liberally seasoned the onion with Italian seasoning while it was cooking, and the spaghetti sauce, as well, while it was heating up.  I must confess that I was looking for a way to use up some turkey sausage crumbles leftover from making pizza, so I just warmed them in the spaghetti sauce instead of browning some fresh sausage.  Great/quick/easy dinner recipe!

Made as written it is just 3 stars at best - it just lacked flavor. So, after tasting, I added (as many others suggested) fresh garlic, oregano, basil, sage, pepper and tossed in some cream cheese (maybe a quarter cup). Then it was "5-STAR-WORTHY"! All six of us loved it. I REALLY LIKED THE TEXTURE OF THE GROUND PORK - IT WAS A NICE CHANGE FROM GROUND BEEF...AND CHEAPER!

Way too bland. I added a bit of salt and pepper and saute 2 cloves of minced garlic with the onion then I add some basil (about 1 teaspoon) and a dash of oregano.

Sure wish we had the option in the rating to give no rating because of alterations to the recipe. How can one believe a low rating when changes were made. That being said, I rated it a 5 star because I made changes, my changes actually deserved a 4. Used half a pound of ziti, one clove of garlic, and 3/4 pound of mild Italian sausage, the remainder of the recipe was as directed. Think it could have been a 5 with less sausage.

This was yummy!  Added finely chopped  yellow peppers along with the green to get more veggies into my kids.  I took one reviewers' recommendation and used part spicy sausage part normal.   It was really tasty!!

This was great! A definite make-again. My only comments: it took me an hour to make, although, admittedly, I am slow in the kitchen; I added salt and pepper, fresh chopped parsley, garlic, and cayenne pepper - also parmesan to serve! Thanks!

Made as directed and it was kind of bland.  I then added garlic, crushed red pepper flakes and Italian seasonings and that helped.

I only had a little time to prepare something for dinner and didn't want to resort to ordering out. I had some of my homemade spaghetti sauce in the fridge and wanted to use that in something. This worked perfectly. It was quick and delicious. I cut up some leftover grilled Italian sausage for the meat. Also, I used lite sour cream and added some red pepper flakes. DH said this was, "Da Bomb!" I will definitely be making this one again.

This recipe is super flexible and awesome. I just made it with my own spaghetti sauce rather than use a jar, added half an onion and a whole bell pepper. It tastes great, I will gladly make this again, playing with different meat options. :)

This was great, quick and easy like promised even with my added ingredients. Like some of the others, I used Hot Italian Sausage instead of ground pork (because it looked better). With the vegetables, I also added shallots, some garlic cloves, some sage. Also, instead of using sour cream, I used Ricotta cheese and mixed that in with the pasta sauce. I mixed it all together and then put it in a baking dish and covered it with mozzarella cheese (big cheese fan here). Kept it in long enough to melt and voila! Amazing! 
Thanks for the recipe!

This was easy and great!  I changed it up a little bit and used red pepper instead of green.  I used 2 lbs of pork and 32 oz speghetti sauce.  In place of the sour cream...I used 8 oz of cream cheese and a little of heavy cream.  Yummy!

Definitely a keeper, but I replaced the pork with Italian pork sausage for more flavor.  I will leave the sour cream out next time as it was a little too rich for my taste.

this recipe is excellent.  I tried to stay true to the ingredients; however, I did make a few minor changes.  I used low fat sour cream (not as creamy, but more healthy), red pepper spaghetti sauce for zip (don't worry...this did not make it spicy) and I used ground turkey because I had it on hand and again it is lean.  it turned out super and I will use this one again and again.

I used ground beef because I didn't have pork and I didn't add green peppers for the same reason.  I added about 3 cloves of chopped garlic.  Although my family liked it, I thought it was a little bland which is why I'm giving 3 stars.  Next time I'll add italian seasoning or something to give it more flavor

We really liked this.  It was delicious!  As suggested by other reviewers I used Hot Italian sausage instead of pork, but it was the addition of the sour cream that made this dish great!  My husband liked it better than regular spaghetti sauce!

This was great, the sour cream added a lot of character to the sauce.  In addition to the peppers & onion, I added garlic, potatos cubed very small, and mushrooms.  I also poured into baking dish and baked for about 20 minutes, adding cheese 15 minutes through.  Thanks!

My husband recently made this recipe which we found very good.  He only likes recipes that have a few ingredients, therefore, this met the criteria!  I personally would either like less pasta or more sauce as I found it a bit dry.  However, it was fast and tasty.

Delicious, easy to make, and tasty as leftovers.  I used 3 chicken breasts rather than ground pork and fat-free sour cream and it tasted great!

This is a fast, delicious recipe.  I used hot turkey sausage (casing removed and chopped)that really spiced it up.  Also, a minced garlic sauted with the onion/pepper.  Both times I've made it, I wound up leaving out the sour cream because it's so good without it.  This is great, April.  Thanks!

This is a great recipe.  It's fast and easy, the most time consuming part is chopping the green peppers.  I have tried it with ground turkey, but my family prefers it with the pork.  The pork gives it much more flavor, the turkey was on the bland side.  This one's a keeper.  Thanks!

Super simple and super good! I used an entire onion and bell pepper, 2 cloves of garlic (minced), plus a package of fresh mushrooms.  I made my version lowfat by using ground turkey and fat-free sour cream.  Tasted great!  Thanks for the recipe!
