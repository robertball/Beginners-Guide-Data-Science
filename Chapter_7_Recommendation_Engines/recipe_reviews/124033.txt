This was great for Sunday breakfast! I made the whole recipe and added a little onion and garlic powders to the scrambled egg mixture. I left out the tortilla chips entirely, for some reason it just didn't appeal to me. I used a combination of Cheddar cheese and a Mexican cheese blend as a I had a little to use in each bag.  Instead of just serving these with toast I made them into breakfast burritos using warm flour tortillas.  I served them with sour cream and fresh salsa on the side.  I had enough left over to send with my husband to work today.

I didn't add the tortilla chips because I didn't have any. I used two full eggs and 4 egg whites and instead of green pepper, I used red. I served this with Garbage Fried Potatoes and homemade salsa. The kids and I had a ball. Really super yummy. I think both combined would make a darn good breakfast burrito.

Very delicious! Moist eggs. I used onion powder, mild hatch green chiles (canned), and Julio's salsa for the tomato. Julio's chips too. This is perfect for using up those broken pieces at the bottom of the bag. I didn't have any ham. It is easy to fix a pan full at once and feed a crowd or scale down to only a couple servings. Easily adaptable to whatever you have on hand.

I didn't have tortilla chips or taco sauce but still had great brunch. I added chives and chili powder to the eggs, and served the scrambled eggs on toasted multi-seed bagel. One to keep!

I made breakfast for dinner last night using this recipe.  I didn’t soak the tortilla chips in the egg mixture because I wasn’t sure we’d like that.  But I did serve them on the side.  I seasoned the egg/milk mixture with salt and pepper and threw in two extra eggs yolks left from another recipe just to use them up.  This was very good and I like the other reviewers who suggest wrapping this in a tortilla.  I topped ours with salsa and a dollop of sour cream.  Great for breakfast or dinner!

We LOVED these! I did omit the tortilla chips only because I'm trying to stay on the lower carb side, but will definately try the recipe with them sometime. I just topped the finished eggs w/ the cheddar cheese, instead of stirring it in. Hubby and the little guy had theirs on warmed flour tortillas, like a breakfast burito. I served this with bacon and it was really a huge hit tonight! This will be a regular in my house! Thanks for sharing. :)

These are good scrambled eggs. I planned on using the tortilla chips, but was out. I left the ham out becuase I was serving these with sausage buscuits and gravy... I enjoyed them. I might try with the tortilla chips one day.

My husband says it would have been better without the chips. I didn't care for it, but he ate it.
