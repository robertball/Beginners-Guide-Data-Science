The crumb topping is excellent.

The cake is too oily.  Another crumb cake recipe I've used has a ratio of 3 cups dry cake mixture: 1/4 cup oil; this one is 3 cups dry cake mixture: 1 and 1/4 cups oil.  Way too much oil for our tastes.  (The ratio for dry ingredients to milk and to eggs is the same between the 2 recipes.) 

The cake was unpleasant: heavy and greasy tasting (not at all like any of the European-style cakes I've eaten; they usually have a fine crumb and almost dry texture).

I agree with the first reviewer that this recipe calls for too much oil. I reduced the oil to 3/4 cup and that seemed about right. However, I think the cake is still too sweet. If I were to make it again, I would reduce the sugar from 3 cups to 2.
