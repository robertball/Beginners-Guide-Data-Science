I had some trouble finding chicken breasts with skin. But once I did this recipe goes together quick, & is such a nice change from all the other passover high fat stuff! I will make this again!

I made this recipe last year and it was great! Not dry, good texture and a healthier alternative to traditional stuffing. Grating zucchini took some time.

I made this last night for our seder and it turned out better than expected. It was my first time buying kosher chicken, since it was the only chicken at my supermarket with the skin on. A bit on the pricey side ($7.50 for 2 large breasts), but really huge and good quality/ value for the money.    I didnt vary the recipe too much. OK, maybe I did..on second thought;-)  1. I couldnt find matzoh farel, though I went to 2 supermarkets in a jewish neighborhood, and searched in the kosher section the day before passover. But for all of you worried that you dont have this ingredient, you can save money & make your own matzoh farfel at home by simply crushing about 6 pieces of seasoned matzoh (I used the egg/ onion flavored) into small pieces (about 1" each) in a zip lock bag to make 3 cups. It turned out just as good.  2. I omitted the onion powder because I didnt have any. And I added paprika for some extra spice.   3. After I put the stuffing under the skin, the chicken looked a little bland going into the oven, so I brushed HP sauce on top of each one. I think this really saved the recipe cause it came out very flavorful with the right level of moisture.   I also served it with Swiss Chalet gravy (all the Canadians will know what I'm talkin' bout..) but any good gravy will do.   It turned out great. I will definitely put it in my passover file for next year.

This was good, but I had to cook it much longer than it said.  It needs to cook about 15-20 minutes longer.  Very easy to make. I think if I made it again I would add more spices to kick up the flavor.  My husband who doesn't like anything spicy loved it, though.  For what that's worth.

We very much enjoyed this recipe but I will be looking for a breading recipe to go with this so we don't have to use chicken with the skin. Also, I plan to double the garlic & onion powder next time.
