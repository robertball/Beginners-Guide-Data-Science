I've made these from a recipe in my trusty Better Homes & Gardens cookbook with the plaid cover. They come out amazing and are sooo tasty. One additional tip: I find it easier to place the handle of a wooden spoon on either side of the potatoes when slicing them to prevent the knife from going too far down. Much easier than using the bowl of a spoon.

These potatoes were different and really delicious. I used olive oil instead of butter, turned the potatoes over for about five minutes to crisp up the tops and once nicely browned, I flipped them again, added quite a bit of fresh bread crumbs which I had seasoned with garlic and onion powders, Italian seasonings, black pepper and lots of parm. Everyone loved these. Thanks!

BIG fan of these! They weren't difficult to make at all, and took no more time (less, actually) than baking a potato in the oven or on the grill.  I left the skins on mine for the nutrients and set in a wooden spoon to cut (it took me a few cuts to get the hang of it).  I skipped the butter and just drizzled w/a little EVOO.  For the second part, I topped w/a mixture of bread crumbs (panko would be even better!), parm, garlic salt, crushed red pepper, and chives).  I'm not a huge potato fan (unless they are deep fried, of course), but I really like these.  These will be a potato staple at the LTH house!  TY!

Does anyone besides me have issues with rating a recipe lower JUST because you altered it to your taste? Come on, people. This is a great recipe! If I decide to use olive oil instead of butter, add herbs and use low fat cheddar, it's still a great recipe, just my version of it. Thanks for this awesome recipe. I'm sure I will come up with other versions, because this is a keeper. Grilled mushrooms might be nice. :)

We loved the presentation of these potatoes, and the next time I make them I'll add more seasonings to the butter (I used a mixture of olive oil and butter).  I used minced garlic, but it mostly just fell to the bottom of the pan, so next time I'll use garlic salt in the butter.  I used panko, but I think seasoned Italian breadcrumbs would make a better choice.  Nice to have these to add to the rotation of potatoes!

I was intriqued by the concept but wasn't very impressed with the outcome.  As others have noted these were on the dry side, and I'm not sure I'm so fond of bread crumbs and Romano cheese on potatoes.  Might consider trying these again without peeling the potatoes, drizzling them with butter and some herbs or seasoning, covering them with foil until nearly done, then uncovering them at the end of the cooking time.

These are my all-time favorite potatoes.  I find you don't have to do anything difficult to them to have them come out great - I just scrub the potatoes, cut the slices with two wooden spoon handles guarding the bottom of the potato and stick them in the oven when I've added the flavorings that go with my main dish. They are really amazing with a small basil leaf between each slice, or a sliver of garlic, or both. They brown very nicely without breadcrumbs or cheese, but they are also good with cheeses of all kinds, depending on what your guests or family prefer.  The original ones in the Swedish pub were completely plain, I believe, except for the butter and salt that made them brown so nicely - and nobody has ever complained about plain Hasselbacks that I've ever heard of.  It was brilliant of Pompier850 to post them in this accessible spot - helps make the world a better place.  By the way, our family also calls them armadillos, proving that great minds think alike. . .

These were super! I also turned them over and let them brown on the top. Also, I added way more bread crumbs than recommended. I spread the slices apart to make sure crumbs were in there also. I also added some garlic powder. My husband loved these. i will make these again.

I have been making these for years, the presentation is wonderful, as for taste, any spices can be used, to change the flavor, from plain and simple to very spicy, its all in personal taste. 5 stars. Well worth the time and effort.

I left the skins on and precooked the potatoes in the microwave for about 5 min before sliceing them. This cut back on oven time a lot. Also added a little sprinkle of garlic to each potato and broiled for the last min or two to get a nice brown crispy topping.

I've made this twice now.  First time I followed the recipe and they were delicious.  This time I sliced them and then poured a melted stick of butter over all 15 potatoes then I baked them for 30 minutes.  I mixed about 1/2 cup of olive oil and several sprigs of fresh rosemary (finely chopped) and about 4 cloves of garlic(finely chopped).  Attempted to stuff the potatoes.  Tried to get in as much of the oil/rosemary/garlic mix in between the slices. Covered the potatoes and cooked for another 45 minutes to 1 hours.  Sprinkled with a little bit of parmesan cheese when they came out.  Covered so that the cheese would melt.  They were beyond Delicious.  They looked So fancy and SO pretty.  I wish I would have taken an after pic.  But we gobbled them up.  This is really a nice recipe to kick your average Baked Potato into high GEAR !  Presentation is beautiful.  Thanks POMPIER850 !!

These were unique, good tasting potatoes.  I left my potatoes unpeeled to keep the vitamins, and they were still good.  Very impressive look.

I thought that these were excellent. I love potatoes but usually don't care for baked potatoes all that much. And I think that they were very simple and quick to prepare, aside from the baking time, but that is to be expected with any type of baked potato. I was generous with brushing on the melted butter, since I didn't have Romano cheese, and sprinkled the potatoes with a little dill along with the salt and pepper. Even the leftovers were divine! Thank you, POMPIER850!

Very nice just as presented.
Our favorite twist is to cut the potatoes, then wrap them in a deli-size sheet of foil and bake for about half an hour. Melt the butter, press in a clove or two of garlic, fresh ground pepper, and about an eighth of a teaspoon of crushed rosemary per potato. Fold back the deges of the foil to expose the top half of the potato, pour melted butter mix on top(the foil 'boat' keeps in all the goodies!) Add a good sprinkle of sea salt. Bake until edges are crispy, about another 15-20 mins. Add cheese and throw back in the oven for a few minutes. Bacon/cheddar, spicy variations are great, too. Try different things- we haven't found a clinker yet!

Wicked good. I only had parmesan cheese but I didn't let that hold me back - and neither should you! I really appreciated the tip to use wooden spoon handles on either side of the potato to cut them. It worked excellent. When I put them in the pan, they weren't fanned out at all. But they fan out as they cook! (I thought that was pretty cool.) So don't force them open at first! I poured some more butter on them after they separated, before topping with cheese. I had to cut my potatoes in half lengthwise as they were really big. Served with grilled steak and salad. I will be making them often, thank you!

So good!! Definitely a nice change to a regular baked potato, they are crispy on the outside and flavorful and tender inside. I mixed a little minced garlic and white pepper with my butter before drizzling it on and baking...turned out extremely flavorful. 

Also I didnt have a wooden spoon so I stuck a bamboo skewer across the very bottom of the potato and sliced the knife all the way down until it hit the skewer...it was very easy to slice all the potatoes that way without cutting all the way through. These are beautiful and flavorful, would definitely recommend and will make again.

I finally got around to trying these and they're so good.  For such a simple recipe, they look like they came out of a gourmet kitchen.  I sprinkled a little garlic powder and dried parsley flakes and used parmesan instead of romano cheese.  You can use whatever spice combination you like depending upon your tastes.

My daughter dubbed these "slinky potatoes", given their resemblance to the classic toy.  Very easy to make, and impressive presentation.  Some of the larger potatoes were not completely done in the middle slices, so it's important to get potatoes very similar in size and shape.

While I concede that the taste may not be exactly 5 stars, the presentation & ease, along with the simple ingredient list make this a 5 star recipe, to me. I'll probably add more cheese & bread crumbs next time, and probably some garlic (mmm!) but as written this is still a very tasty, very impressive recipe. It took me a couple potatoes to get the hang of the cutting right, but I attribute that mostly to the fact that I used small potatoes. Give this a try if you're looking for a side dish that will impress company. One thing to note: When you put them in the oven, they won't look impressive. But, while cooking, they split open & make the pretty spaces in between the slices that you see in the pictures. Don't be worried if you don't see those before cooking! Another thing to improve the flavor: When serving, use a utensil that allows you to scrape up some of the " butter-cheese-goo" in the bottom of the pan to serve underneath the potato. It improves the flavor without compromising the appearance :)

**5 stars for the idea and concept.  I would never had thought to do this with potatoes.  They were a nice twist on a potatoe side dish.  I did sprinkle the tops with some of my fav spices(paprika, garlic powder, salt and pepper)for added flavor.  I even prob used more butter than specified.  Will make again and next time will sprinkle cheddar cheese on top for the last 10min of baking instead of romano.  My kids love cheese potatoes and this would work great with this recipe.

Good recipe....place chopsticks on either side of the potatoes. These will act as a guide so that you don't slice all the way through. If potatoe is not relatively flat on one side, cut it so that it is. This is the side that goes down on cutting board when slicing . I have used Asiago when I didn't have Romano. I usually add extra butter, cheese and Italuan flavored bread crumbs.  I have made them as directed and also on a weber grill on the upper rack in a aluminum pan.

Excellent for fancy dinner or with Steak on the grill....a keeper

I made one white and one sweet potato, and both came out lovely.  The potatoes were crispy outside and soft inside, and the bread crumbs added a nice texture (I used panko as that is what I had on hand).  The only change I made was to use garlic salt to give a little extra flavor, and I added chopped pecans to the sweet potato.  Took some time to slice but really not a difficult thing to do. I think slicing them thin is key because it helps get more butter and seasoning into the potato.  Thinking about making these for Christmas dinner.

I've been making a potato similar to this for years.  I insert thin slices of onion into the potato slices, slather the top with some butter, salt and pepper, wrap in foil, and cook on the grill (could cook in the oven, too).  But this is a very nice alternative with far nicer presentation than just an ordinary baked potato.  I used panko bread crumbs which gave this a little more crunch.  Another way to slice the potatoes is put a wooden spoon on the counter, place the potato next to the round spoon handle, and slice...you'll never slice all the way through the potato (just be careful on the ends of the potato).  Very nice recipe and looks great on the plate.

A-M-A-Z-I-N-G. I didn't change the recipe at all (except omitted bread crumbs on my brother's potato bc he has celiac). Made these for my Valentine's night dinner with two other things from this site, "Easy Yet Romantic Filet Mignon" and "Green Beans with Peppers." Everything was fantastic. My husband and brother are still raving about these potatoes.

Tasted really good but I had a bit of a problem with the prep.  Not the submitters fault though.  I just need to make it more often.

I followed the recipe but used olive oil instead. This came out like the picture, crispy and delicious. We topped them with a sour cream with chopped fresh chives mixed in. Lovely.

What a wonderful recipe! They turned out crunchy and full of flavor. I tried using a pretty deep spoon at first but it only cut halfway thru the potato; just a regular serving spoon did the trick! Before putting them in the pan I spread them out as much as possible. I was generous with the salt and pepper in the first coating, and I doubled the bread crumb and cheese combo, adding a bunch of seasonings to it and pulsing in my food processor (I used half romano and half parmesan). Turned out golden brown and really tasty, worth the little extra effort--thanks for a great recipe!

I just happened to have picked up some petite russets and was looking for something different - this fit the bill perfectly.  I can see why this wouldn't be too terribly appealing if you were using a regular sized russet ... but with the petites, they were superb.  Just the right size - super crispy on outside (I used a mix of olive oil & butter and made sure to get down into the cuts) and creamy on the inside.  I did 20" in oven, then put breadcrumbs and parm cheese for last 15 minutes of cooking.  I also used conv oven which probably helped with the crispiness.  In any event, will make again.  Thank you so much for recipe.

I loved these.  I used the tip of some other folks and put a wooden spoon (handle side) on either side of the potato as I was slicing.  I used a pastry brush with the butter.  I think that helped me get in between the slices a little bit.  I love potatoes and loved this preparation.  The taste was delightful - rather subtle, but yummy nonetheless.  Made this with sesame green beans and filet mignon for Father's Day today and they were a hit.  My mother thought the potatoes were beautiful.  Offered to start paying me to cook for them. :) I will probably make these again and not change a thing. YUM.

These are the best poatoes ever.  Only giving 4 stars because I omitted the cheese and bread crumbs.  They were great with just butter, salt & pepper.  I cooked them in a thin aluminum pie pan and the bottom came out very crispy.

The seasoning on these were tasty and the idea is excellent, however, I feel like the bottom of the potatoes are ignored and end up being very dry (even with the melted butter poured over them.) I think the next time I make these I will toss them around in the seasoning to cover completely before baking. Really great visually, just missing the flavor on the bottom!

These were pretty good, my family thought the potatoes were too crispy.  I make a similar recipe that my family prefers over these because they are softer.  I peel and slice the potatoes in the same manner.  Melt some butter in a microwave-safe casserole.  Roll the potatoes in the butter, leaving them cut side up.  Top with salt, pepper, grated Parmesan cheese and paprika.  Cover with plastic wrap and microwave for about 10 minutes or until potatoes are tender (depending upon the strength of your microwave).

I got my version from my grandmother (jag ar Svenksa), and our version didn't contain cheese.  But we do slice the potatoes and butter them up and breadcrumb them to death and I make hasselbacks for every major holiday now!  Love them!

This is a really good, but you shouldn't use big potatoes. The original recipe has smaller potatoes and therefore they have less of a "baked" potato taste and will be more crispy.

I confess to not being much of a baked potato fan, but this recipe intrigued me. I prepared the recipe as written and got great results. I placed the potatoes in a corning dish with lid for the first 40 minutes. Then, removed the lid for the second baking period after adding the cheese and bread crumbs. The result was excellent and a nice compliment to grilled hamburgers.

These were fantastic! I did use white cheddar in place of romano, but they still came out great. I saved a little time by microwaving the potatoes for 5 min each (after slicing) to cook them before placing them in the oven with the other ingredients. Delicious!

The bread crumbs/cheese browned too quickly. So next time I would add them only when the potatoes were fully done.

This is a fun way to cook potatoes.  My family likes a good buttery potato, so they had to add extra butter to make it taste the way they want, but I thought it was a unique way to cook them and makes for a pretty presentation for guests.

My family and I did not care for this recipe at all.  I made it exactly to the recipe.  The potatoes seemed to be so dry - almost like the consistency of a scalloped potato without the cheese and cream and good stuff.  I will not make again.  They looked great just like the photo.  Disappointing.

Easy to make and quicker that baking a potato in the oven. To my horror I was out of bread crumbs so I whirled around some Triscuits in my mini food processor and seasoned the crumbs. I used the two wooden spoons method for slicing the potatoes.

These were different that the standard baked potato.... and tasted good if they were eaten with sour cream or butter because the centers seemed a little hard and dry... pretty good flavor... maybe next time I will bake longer to soften the inside or cover my baking dish for the first half an hour....

Loved these potatoes, I will first say that I substituted EVOO for the butter, but think it turned out just wonderful.  Hubby gave them two thumbs up and said they were flavorful enough to skip the sourcream.  Thanks!

Loved this side dish!  I did not peel the potatoes as I was in a bit of a rush. Otherwise, everything else was kept the same.  They are very tasty, and will definitely make again. Thanks for the great recipe.

I followed the directions on cutting the potatoes but then I couldn't seem to get the cheese and butter in between the layers.

We absolutely loved these!!  I did make a couple small modifications, but I'm sure they would have been great as the recipe states.  When I sprinkled the S&P, I also sprinkled on a little fresh parsley and garlic powder.   Looking forward to trying these on the grill this summer!!

My mom has been making these for as long as I can remember....and I've made them many, many times as well.  We call them armadillos in our house!  :-)  
I add a little garlic salt to the butter, and we are very liberal with the grated parm.  We also serve with sour cream.....because it makes everything better!

These are pretty good! Great change from plain baked potatoes :) Definitely use a spoon to restrict yourself from cutting all the way thru the potato!

Needed more seasoning.  Also the outside was burning before the inside was done cooking.  They did look nice though and tasted ok.

If you need a potato dish to dress up your dinner plate, these potatoes looked great right out of the oven.  But they tasted exactly like a baked potato with butter, salt and pepper ought to taste.  I guess I was hoping for more.

The concept of this recipe was good, but I think the recipe itself could use some improvement. I made these for the first time and liked the crispness of the potatoes at the top, and thought the flavor with the cheese and bread crumbs was good, but  the bottom half of the potato was disappointing. Next time I might try to open up the potato a bit more to get some of the bread crumbs or cheese down near the bottom, too. This recipe also allows for experimentation with herbs and such. Nice to have an option other than mashed or baked potatoes.

These are delicious!  And a little different from your typical potato side.  My sister stumbled upon this before Christmas and we made them as a side for our Feast of Seven Fishes on Christmas Eve.  I think my Dad at the leftovers three meals a day until they were gone.  Great presentation too!  I think these will be a new family tradition!

Great technique with the spoon. I used small red potatoes and peeled them. Maybe next time I won't bother peeling them. I tried to cram all the potatoes in too small of a dish. I think if you give them some room they tend to open up a bit more so when you sprinkle of the cheese and breadcrumbs there is more surface area to catch the good stuff. Everyone raved about these potatoes.

It was nice to have a different way to prepare potatoes.  I added garlic to the butter and used parmesan instead of romano.

I make these at Christmas to serve with beef tenderloin.  Everyone loves them and expects them.  In-laws treat them like baked potatoes and like to put sour cream and green onions on them, so I put sides of those on the table. I use two chopsticks on either side of the potato to make the slices.

Loved them, but would highly suggest adding a little chicken stock to the bottom of the pan while roasting, otherwise they end up a little dry. the stock also adds a dimension of flavor.

My family loved these potatoes!  I used half butter/half olive oil as one of the reviewers recommended.  They were super easy and quick to make (which is very important to me since I'm not a huge fan of cooking!).  Will definitely make them again.

I  have made this twice so far...  once with a yukon gold potato and the second time was a russet.  We prefer the taste of the yukon gold.  it's more buttery in flavor.  but don't get me wrong they both are good.  I love that this tastes like the love child of a baked potato and a roasted potato!!!  it is sooo good!!!! 
It looks very impressive yet it is sooo easy!!!  you gotta try it.,

These were amazing! The preparation is genius and delivers a creamy middle and a crispy outside. Obviously season to taste. I like a ton of seasoning so added garlic powder and onion powder too.

Made these without the cheese or bread crumbs because lazy. Might have used a bit more butter and left the potatoes in the oven a little longer but it turned out fantastic, crispy on top, soft and buttery on the inside. 

I love potatoes and thought this looked interesting. Will make it again.

Part of our Christmas dinner, which included rib eye steak and jumbo shrimp on the grill as well as Pappa's jumbo crab cakes flown in by my sister as a surprise (Thanks, Sally!)

We first saw these made a couple of weeks ago when we were watching a cooking show hosted by a lady on a ranch (don't want to violate any trademarks!) and thought that would be a good addition to our Christmas meal.  

We used Yukon gold potatoes as that's our favorite and we don't skin them.  I also doubled the butter mixture (just a personal choice), added 1/2 tsp minced garlic and served the potatoes  topped with fresh chopped chives.  

Definitely one we will try again soon - I need to work on refining my technique in this one.

It was on the dry side and slow to make. I'd rather do the scalloped potato if I will chooses between them. Next time I might try smaller potatoes.

The appeal of this recipe is the aesthetics. However, the taste was not all that great. I likely won't make it again.

I make these almost exactly as written with the exception of adding the breadcrumbs. My husband is on a strict low carb diet due to health concerns. I use small potatoes and adjust the time. They are great in the oven or on the gas grill with heavy duty foil wrapped loosely around them. We jokingly call them armadillos! I sometimes change the type of cheese I use depending on what else is being served.

These were a disaster for me.  I tried to do too many at once and may try again when I'm doing a small dinner and I'm not rushed.

Made these before, but different recipe.  I loved the spoon trick (to prevent cutting all the way through)! I did everything it said, except I basted the potatoes with butter a few extra times! They were a big hit and were so Yummy!!

These were good -- I would make again. Skipped the breadcrumbs but followed the rest of the recipe as written. My only complaint would be that, as mentioned by other reviewers, they were a little dry.

These were excellent.  I felt that I needed more butter that the recipe called for. Also I used garlic salt in place of regular salt. I didn't have Romano,so I used parmesean. I will make these again. My husband and I loved them.

I have made these a couple of time and they turn out perfect following the recipe. and the presentation is very eye pleasing. It can be adapted to the main course your having, by changing spice. garlic, onion or even dill. Thanks, Happy Cooking!

Fantastic taste and presentation. I wanted something different with corned beef and cabbage for a St. Patricks Day party and these potatoes stole the show. I omitted the topping and just enjoyed them with fancy coarse salt and butter. The roasted potato slices were so fun to peel off and pop like a chip, my guests polished these potatoes off before anything else. Thanks for sharing!

This recipe was fantastic! I left the potatoes unpeeled and added a little cooked bacon on top and parmesan cheese instead of bread crumbs and baked for an additional 15 minutes (we like things crispy).  I also used vey small potatoes so that they would cook extra crispy instead of flipping them over. My husband absolutely loved them!

Excellent in every aspect. I used a bamboo skewer through the potato to stop the knife from cutting all the way through. Used what I had on hand: olive oil, coarse salt, freshly ground black pepper, freshly grated parmesan cheese, chopped parsely and packaged bread crumbs.

These were delicious. I kept the skin on. Baked them for the first 40 minutes cut-side down and then turned them cut-side up for another 25 minutes. Second time I used a spoon to separate the cut potato before adding the cheese and breadcrumbs. They are yummy, soft cooked potato in the inside while being crunchy on the outside. The topping adds to the flavor while not overpowering the potato taste! These were a hit for hubby, a 2 and 4 year old and me! Recommend these to anyone who likes potatoes (or doesn't), doesn't have time to make baked potatoes, or just wants to try something new and different!

Best recipe here!  These are absolutely gorgeous and taste as good as they look.  I like the peelings on and put a small pat of butter between every other slice.  Different cheeses and seasonings are wonderful to experiment with.  Haven't had a disappointment yet.  Totally awesome and easy to prepare.

Soooooo good!!  I didn't add the breadcrumbs due to gluten allergies but followed the rest and it was delicious!  I did brush the potatoes with garlic butter half way through cooking and again when finished cooking.  Made it for a dinner party and got great reviews!

Served these last night. No complaints from family. No rave reviews either. We bought a 100lb. sack of Huge (Rock Hard!) potatoes, from a field up North. Even after pre-cooking in the mic for 5 mins, couldn't get them to "open-up" enough, to receive the butter/evoo. After 1 1/2hrs in oven, they still hadn't "fanned out" pretty, like the picture. This made it hard, to get toppings in the folds...Maybe, a different type of potato next time? *On a side note, I Am going to try this on Yams soon. Perhaps, some butter/brown sugar/cinnamon/pecan topping? Yum.

This was a lot of work for something that tasted exactly like oven roasted potatoes. My potatoes were kind of large so they took forever to cook. I wouldn't take the time to make this again.

I won't be making these again.  The recipe sounded interesting, the end result wasn't that tasty.  I didn't care for the dry bread crumbs on it either and they ended up with a rather dry taste.

I saw these made on some cooking show a long time ago,and always wanted to make them "someday"... Well, someday finally arrived, and they were great!! Crispy on the outside; soft and fluffy on the inside. I used this recipe as a starting point, and modified it from what I remembered from the show. I had some left over baked potatoes, so I used them. I placed the (unpeeled) potatoes in between two bbq skewers to use as cutting guides. I brushed them with evoo and sprinkled them with sea salt. I mixed my topping with parm-reggio, bacon bits, cheddar cheese, melted butter, panko, garlic, salt, and pepper. I then placed the some of the topping in each slit, and the remainder on the top of the potato. I cooked them in the oven at 400 until the cheese melted and browned on the top.

I Tried this exactly.  Not all that impressed. Yes they were crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside, but I think if you did the same with a plain ol' baked potato and added the butter, cheese and bread crumbs... you would end up with the same and not all the work of slicing them.

These made a nice presentation but needed a long time to cook and some extra seasoning to rise to the level of the presentation.  A sprinkle of Herbs de Provence were a nice addition.

Pretty good, will definately make them again as a cheap and easy side for dinner.  When I first cut them they didn't really separate, but they will in the oven.

Tasty, great alternative to the baked potato. I followed recipe exactly but next time I will play around with some different herbs for flavors.

Delicious! I used olive oil instead of butter, and omitted the parmesan simply because I didn't have any. I put salt, pepper, and garlic on the potato prior to baking, and it came out perfect. Will never make a baked potato any otherway!

It didn't work well for me, but it is hard to actually ruin a potato for me so it was eaten, just no "wow" factor.

Not sure if my review counts b/c I didn't opt for some ingredients but figured the process/idea was worth 5 stars! I omitted the breadcrumbs and cheese. Instead, I added sliced garlic between potato slices, then drizzled melted butter and olive (infused w/spices) oil with cracked pepper and sea salt. I used LARGE potatoes and had to heat for 60 minutes... and brushed after 40 min w/more butter & olive oil. They were delicious... my mom is Irish and really picky about her baked potatoes, she loved it!

I liked this idea and technique a lot, but I substituted olive oil for butter.  I will make this again, except I'll spread apart the slices as much as possible before adding the breadcrumb topping, for better penetration of the olive oil and seasoning into the potato.  I think I'll also try some infused olive oils, such as garlic or Italian seasoning infused olive oil.  I suspect this will become my go-to baked potato recipe once I tweak to just my taste.

Great preso for a baked potato-come on you have to agree!  I made these to make sure my kids ate something for dinner and as predicted, they liked it.  I don't know if I'd bake a plain potato again after this.  

Now for what I've changed...broiled for 3 minutes, just to really toast up the top. I used less than 1 tbsp of bread crumb per ten potatoes. I didn't have the cheese so I didn't add it.  

Good simple stuff.  Thanks!

I made these for dinner last night.  They turned out very well.  Very "fancy" presentation for something pretty easy.  I cut a small slice off the bottom of each potato to level it keep it from rolling off the cutting board while I made the slits in the potato.  May try with some garlic next time.

I made these for dinner last week. Everyone LOVED them!! I had cornflake crumbs, so i used those in place of the bread crumbs, turn out wonderful. Even my picky eater wanted 2nds on the potatoes! I have been told to make them at least once a week for supper! Thanks for the wonderful recipe!

It took longer to cook than expected.  I wished I would have sliced the potato completely rather than keeping them together.  It may look fancy, but really doesn't have the seasoning throughout like sliced potatoes.

This didn't turn out quite as pretty as the picture for me!  The potatoes took quite awhile to bake especially considering they were small potatoes.  I thought these turned out kind of dry and rubbery.  It is a fancy idea but I didn't think it worked very well!

I really enjoyed these. Slicing them is a bit tricky. I love the combination of the crispy/cheesy potato skin and the warm, soft insides. I used a higher quality parmesan and they turned out great!

I have been wanting to try this recipe for awhile - but heating the oven to such a high temp in the summer isn't always appealing. However, it's been really cool for July and I gave it a try last night. Turned out well. I used olive oil at first, and then the 2 tbsp of butter with the cheese and breadcrumbs. Very good! Looking forward to trying it in the fall with prime rib and yorkshire pudding.

I agree with alot of the other reviewers, nice presentation but lacked flavor. I will definitely make these again but will have to play around and experiment with other seasonings...dry ranch dressing mix maybe??

An easy way to slice these without cutting through is to use two cutting boards (same height) - one of each side of the potato.  Very easy.  My family really didn't like the potatoes as much as I wished.

I made these for fathers day dinner.  They were a big hit with everyone!  I used two wooden spoons to help make the cuts.  Used plain bread crumbs- added garlic, onion powder and basil.  Will definately make again.

I've made a similar version of these.  I added bacon bits, thinly sliced green onion, and some shredded cheddar cheese.  You can add whatever ingredients you like.  It's a simple way to change up the potato serving!

the only reason i rated this a four was because i don't know how they truly would have turned out if i used different potatoes. i bought yellow potatoes and cooked them the recommended time and they were really hard and raw. it think if i would have used red or brown potatoes then it would have been a for sure five start!!! the presentation is spot on!!!

Yummy! I've made these a few times now and learned something new each time. I wanted to use the tip about cutting with wooden spoons underneath, but didn't have any, so I used chopsticks! I found the potatoes spread out better during the first baking session when I left the skins on, allowing more goodies to get between the slices. I used EVOO, romano, panko, and some fresh chives once and rosemary once, both from my garden. Used exact baking times for large baking potatoes and they were perfect! This is a new regular in our meals!

We thought these were really good.  I drizzled them with some garlic infused olive oil and a touch of butter for the first bake time.  Added a bit more butter, parmesan cheese and italian bread crumbs and a nice dose of salt & fresh ground pepper for the last 20 min.  These had lots of flavor and such a pretty presentation.  Crispy exterior with a nice soft tender inside...hmmmm!  Will make again.

This rates a 5 for being something new to do with potatoes, but the flavor wasn't what I'd hoped for.  I will definitely try again and tweak to suit my tastes.  Very interesting.  Thanks for sharing.

Nothing special, they rated a 3 because the 2 year old grand daughter liked them, my husband and I gave them about a 2.  I like the method of cooking, something fun and different, just not the taste.  I think I might use the method and experiment with my own seasonings.

I found out an easier way instead of using the wooden spoon is I put either a bamboo skewer on either side of the potato or a disposable wooden chopstick also I found out if you rinse the starch out from between the slices of potato they seem to fan out more

I grew up eating these potatoes. My mother would make them for special occasions. She did not add many seasonings, which would make them plain. I however like my potatoes with flavor and these seem to fit the bill. Will try them for Christmas Day dinner. My son requested them.

I used garlic salt instead of regular salt and sprinkled on a little rosemary as well at the beginning. Only down side was that the flavor didn't seem to quite get down to the middle of the potato. Perhaps using a smaller potato would help with that.

I am from Sweden, and I have made this many times - and I have never used baking potato... Just regular potato - otherwise the recipe itselfs is very ok! The cheese  can be any hard cheese - just look up so it is CHEESE not something u in USA just call cheese...
"American cheese—the kind you get in the individual plastic wrappers—is processed cheese or “cheese food,” meaning it’s not actually real cheese.

In teaching an etiquette class, I made these as part of a practice/ training 5 course meal. Because I was cooking for a large group, preparing 5 courses, setting the tables for an outdoor environment, I partially prepped the potatoes about 11 hours before i needed them.  I chose not to peel-didn't see the need- used Yukon Golds. After slicing them, i plunked them in bowls of brine water. They sat in that 8-9 hours. I removed them, lightly patted dry, brushed with slight-hint-of-garlic butter, salt, peppered,baked for 20 minutes, removed to start another item,  topped with crumbs and shredded parmesan. I returned them to the oven half-way through the other item's cooking time.  The topping was delightgully crisp, the potatoes were moist but not mushy and flavor was fabulous.  They were a hit and perfect with the meal.

I followed the directions word for word, but these just didn't turn out well. They were dry and pretty flavorless. If I bother making it again, I will be changing some things like adding more butter and more cheese.

This was easy and another way to make potatoes, but in an interesting way.  I used ADOBO seasoning to add a little more flavor instead of just salt and pepper.  I'll be making this again.

These potatoes are so good and really quite easy to make.  Made them for a small dinner party and everybody raved about them.  The only change I made was with the cheese.  I didn't have any romano cheese on hand so I used parmesan cheese instead.  Also, left the skin on some of the potatoes.  Deliciuous!

I made these, but only used olive oil, salt, pepper and I left the skins on. Baked them at 425 for 90 minutes. Delicious, simple and vegan!

The topping makes these. It reminds me of a macaroni & cheese topping I have. The crunch is great with softness of the potato.

A nice variation of baked and/or roasted potatoes. Very delicious, easy prep, nice presentation. For me, all it needed at serving time was a dollop of sour cream.  A keeper!

Made this for the family and they liked it.   I was trying to rush and didn't leave them in the oven the prescribed time so they weren't as done as I would have liked, but I know what to do next time to make it right!

I really liked these and will be sharing the recipe. I used butter and it burned while baking in the oven, but it didn't affect the potatoes at all. I used seasoned salt instead of salt and pepper, parmesan cheese instead of Romano (love Romano but only had Parm on hand), and Italian seasoned breadcrumbs. I wouldn't describe these as dry, like some other reviewers. The bottom and other parts were nicely browned and crispy, which is a typical characteristic in a potato dish. I put a little dollop of sour cream on each one. I'd love to figure out how I could make them fan out more, but they were great!

These were good and a nice change to a baked potato but more work!  I kept the skins on and didn't add cheese or breadcrumbs to the top.  They could have been cooked another 10-15 minutes as they weren't totally done.  Good recipe!

These potatoes are delicious. I baked mine without peeling them along side the Amazing Chicken recipe I found here on All recipes.com. All I had to do to complete the dinner was prepare a tossed salad with fennel, red pear and gorgonzola cheese  on red leaf lettuce.

This is definitely a first time for us having this kind of potato. Interesting but would change a few things next time. Not sure the bread crumbs really bring much to the table and romano is expensive to use so little here. Its nice not to have a baked potato but I would still top it like one had I known before hand how similar it would be. Worth trying for the technique but plan to play with the seasoning.

These were very tasty but a little dry. I followed the directions except for the cheese.  I used a 5 blend cheese that also had mozzarella (which I do not care for but it's what my Husband wanted)  Next time I will prepare them by slicing and seasoning but will place in foil for the first 45 minutes.  I will then open the foil, add the last of the ingredients and bake last 15 min till crispy.
We will be making this recipe again with the changes above and will post

I always read reviews before trying a recipe, so I did make a few changes. I didn't peel my potatoes.I added garlic and onion powders, and used panko bread crumbs. I had difficulty getting the potatoes sliced-kept having slices come loose from the potato. Comments I received from my dinner guests were the potatoes had good flavor, but were difficult to slice with a fork. So, next time I'm going to thinly slice them all the way and layer them in a baking pan, like this-////////, before adding the rest of the ingredients. We'll see how they turn out!

These are dope, because you can remix them however you want. I added salt pepper and chives and put butter and sour cream on top. Because of the cut, the toppings seep way in and coat. My boyfriend added cheese sauce and bacon. Could you ask for more?

I've been making these for years since being taught the recipe by an Aunt in England.  Since I don't have two ovens and it's difficult to have these when also having a roast, here's my variation to solve that problem: I make my slices about 1/4" and then par-boil the potatoes in salted water for about 10 mins., drain them, and set them aside to dry.  About 5-10 mins. before I pull the roast out, I put the baking dish (actually, I use a lasagna pan because I always have to make so many potatoes since my family LOVES them) with 1/4 - 1/2cup (yes, CUP) butter in the oven to get good and hot; when I pull the roast out, I crank the oven to 450/500F and when the butter is hot and bubbling, I place the potatoes in and finish them while the roast is "resting."  After about 10-15 mins. in, sprinkle on the cheese (I use parmesan and omit the breadcrumbs) and put them back in for the last 5-10 mins.  OMG they are SO good - they come out wonderfully crispy on the outside and tender and buttery flavoured inside! Admittedly, this is not the "healthiest" way to make them, but it's a special occasion and we all deserve a little indulgence once in awhile! ;-)

I tried using different potatoes and it was a little difficult for my cooking level. I didn't cut it nicely and it wasn't cooking evenly because of my shotty work. I had to cook it longer, but when it was done it still tasted great! (Even though I messed it up!) I will have to try this again sometime in the future. Maybe add some more flavours as toppings!

Really enjoyed making and serving these potatoes!  It's an easy, yet impressive recipe, and I served it at a dinner party.  I used Parmesan Cheese, but that's the only change I made... and that was because I forgot to buy the cheese listed in the recipe.  It was great anyway and I'll make it again and again!  I believe one can really experiment with the cheese and spices, etc.   Thanks much for the recipe!

I left the potato skin on, the skin came out chewy instead of crispy. The inside of the potato is nice and soft, so I'm not sure if I should cook it any longer. It has a nice presentation and the cheese and bread crumbs is flavorful.

As it was the first time making and trying them I didn't add the bread crumbs or cheese, I used a garlic spread with the butter and they were fantastic.I used small unpeeled potatoes and basted them every 15 to 20 minutes. A dollop of sour cream made the perfect.

I use fingerling potatoes and put two chopsticks on either side and then cut. I also boil the spuds first then finish in the oven. Olive oil, ghee, butter, salad dressing, slivers of almonds, garlic, basil, sage...its all good.

These were really good, I didn't measure the butter and I didn't add the breadcrumbs or cheese, just butter, salt and pepper. I cooked them longer than it said to get them soft inside, I will for sure make again, I did peel them.

Excellent, and really easy to do. I used the handles of two wooden spoons to stop myself from slicing all the way through the potatoes.  I have two very picky eaters in my house and there were no leftovers!

Upon Initial tasting the potatoe we felt it lacked flavor. As suggested, by adding garlic to the butter pre drizzle, also a sprinkle of oregano , season with salt and pepper and substituting grated  Parmesan for the Romano cheese we had a nice product. We prepare half the potatoes with crumbs and the others are left without. The choice is a personal preference. With adjustments 5 star

I made it pretty much as suggested with one change. Instead of Romano cheese I used a combination of cheddar and Parmesan, about 1/2 cup total. I used two wooden spoons to slice the potatoes and it worked well. I tried to take a picture using the app itself but it wouldn't let me stating that I needed to choose a picture 960 X something (can't remember). That's probably why there is only the original photo and no new ones have been added. Turned out really tasty! Smelled fabulous while cooking.

I made it exactly as the recipe stated.  The kitchen smelled sooo good while they were baking.  I was really ready for a mouth watering delight.  But I was sadly disappointed.  I thought they were bland .  I think I might try them again but they need more butter and I think I will use a finely grated sharper cheese with some bacon crumbles next time.  Maybe even some onion powder or garlic salt in the bread crumbs.  In any case, they definitely need help.

A very pretty potato. I didn't peel the potatoes and I thought the potatoes came out better than the first time I made these potatoes.  I brushed melted butter on both the inside of the potatoes and the outside. You will need patience to add the melted butter. I then sprinkled Kosher salt and some pepper. I  also followed the advice from one review that said to flip the potato after 30 minutes to toast the top of the potato. Next time, I will place them in foil to see if that makes a difference.

The blame for these potatoes being 'meh' is entirely mine.  It was my first time trying to juggle 3 dishes with 3 different temps being cooked in one oven at the same time....(what a nightmare).  As a result, the potatoes were a bit under cooked, which made them less than stellar.
Having said that, the flavor was good, and the recipe was simple to follow.  I will try these again, when NOT sharing the oven.  :)

These were absolutely fabulous but I made a couple of changes midstream...For the first round of cooking, I did 40 minutes on 425 like the instructions; but when I took them out to drizzle the remaining butter on them, they were not even close to being done. I increased the temp to 450 and cooked them another 40 minutes. Then I took them out and drizzled the remaining butter on them and cooked them another 20 minutes. Even then the bottom of the biggest one was still a bit raw. I did not use bread crumbs and used parmesan cheese instead of Romano...I also added a sprinkling of garlic powder, some red pepper flakes and oregano. The flavor was delicious and since I now know the cooking times, I'll be making these again soon!! Another tip that someone may find useful; I accidentally cut all the way through one of the potatoes about halfway into it. Once it was halved, it cooked much better and faster so next time I may halve all of them!

Great recipe! Plus another use for the metal spoon rest on the stove :-) Thanks. I just read that others found that the potato was on the dry side - not mine as I used a pastry brush to get the melted butter into the slits! A few more seconds is worth the finished product :-) Plus I left the skins on also.

First time I did it I burned the edges.  Second try was a charm.  Delicately caramelized crispy edges with a tender interior.  The secret is to time these very carefully,  you may have to change the cooking time as one minute can mean the difference between golden perfection or burning.  I recommend your oven have a window so you can watch the cooking.  A very sensitive nose will tip you off that the edges are carameizing.  Once the carameizing of the edges start pull out of the oven immediately as burning happens inside a minute.

We baked these for more than 1 hour total, and they were nowhere near done.  Put them in the microwave for several minutes, and still not done.  The amount of butter is not nearly sufficient.

After cooking for 30 minutes the slices did spread out, then I inserted thin sliced rings of fresh onions between each one, sprinkled powdered white cheddar and spices, more butter, and cooked another 25 minutes, very good.  I did need to reduce the temperature to 350 after inserting the onions as the potatoes started to burn a bit on the top but not cooked all the way through.  Very tasty, I also added powdered chicken boullion with the spices as well as fresh rosemary.

The potato was kind of dry but other than that it was pretty good (I cooked it in two 30 min. increments)! I added EVOO, garlic salt, pepper, and parsley to the butter. I also added salt and pepper to the panko (bread crumbs). I substituted fresh romano for regular parmesan. I'll be making this again!

I waited too late to do these in the oven but was craving them for dinner.  I cooked the whole potatoes in the microwave until almost done.  Then sliced them, add butter, etc. and broiled them in the oven until brown and crispy.  That technique worked beautifully.  I placed the baked potato on a cutting board between the parallel handles of two wooden spoons. as another reviewer suggested, to slice them and the slices were uniformly deep.

I thought these were ok but my husband loved them, hence, the 4 stars. I followed the recipe exactly, the potatoes did not open as pictured and they did not cook all the way through but the bottoms were starting to get really crispy (my husbands favorite part). I personally felt they were bland.  I like this concept so next time I am going to gently pull the slices apart to help even cooking after cooking. Along with seasoning each slice and inserting a slice of cheese in between some of the slices.  A different side dish than baked or mashed potatoes.

Have made potatoes like this for years, family love them.....any flavoring can be used and thanks for the tip using the spoon to slice, I have used a flat wooden sign but results in uneven or cut right thru slices.

Everyone in my house always gets scared when I try a new recipe but this was a real hit!  I did change the recipe a teeny bit.  I added smoked paprika, smoked coriander, adobo, hot pepper flakes (not enough to change the flavor, just a little zip), basil, and parsley and I didn’t have the Romano cheese so I just used seasoned breadcrumbs.  Definitely putting this one in the weekly rotation.

Followed baking directions to a T but potatoes still came out a bit too hard. Next time I'll microwave for 5 minutes or so prior to baking. Other than that, I used Panko bread crumbs and grated Parmesan cheese. Tastes delicious!

We made these potatoes to go with Prime Rib Roast for Christmas 2014 and they turned out well, next time we make them we're going to add more seasoning too as mentioned by other reviewers. Overall, we enjoyed them.

3 stars for taste and 4 for looks.  Other than adding spices to our liking, it was no different than any other potato.  I'd make again just for the wow factor of the presentation.

Good recipe and a nice change from our standard diced/roasted potatoes or mashed.  I used about 1/4 cup of pecorino romano and 2 tablespoons of panko.  I think some diced jalepenos (jarred variety) sprinkled on top during the second half of baking might do them well.

These potatoes were great! Made it for two men and myself and they were crispy on the outside, fluffy on the inside. I left the skin on for personal preference. I used Italian breadcrumbs, red chili powder, and paprika on top of the potatoes to give them a little bit of a kick. I did mean to flip them mid-bake but I forgot. The bottoms of the potatoes turned out fine. Thanks for this recipe!

I will admit that i am no chef here... But i followed the directions and the recipe was not a success.  They took a long time to cook fully. And even when they finished, they were not a hit in my home. I think if the were cooked under foil for the first half, maybe that would have helped.

The potatoes were good.  I made them with small red potatoes  and kept the peel on them.  They were good like that but I think next time I will add some more spice to them.

These were fantastic . I would make a bigger effort into browning them at the end of the cooking time under broil. More butter and sprinkle of chives.

I thought these were really good, but could use a little more spice.  I read in one of the reviews to use garlic powder and onion powder in addition to the ingredients, which I will do next time.  The potatoes were very tender on the inside though and quite tasty.  I will probably make these again.

Kids loved these! and hubby asked for them 2 days in a row which he never does. only difference is I used Seasoning salt and no bread crumbs cause i didnt want to run to the store also left the skins on taste so much better that way. The spoon trick is great!! thank you for putting that in there saved so much time.
Great recipe definitley a keeper.

Super good and super easy. I didn't have any seasoned bread crumbs, so I sub'd Costco's no-salt seasonings ( a nice blend of herbs and seasonings) -- turned out great!

Made this recipe with parmesan instead of romano cheese (that's what was on hand). Tasted nice, but wasn't quite my style. I will probably use this mode of preparation with different seasonings - maybe garlic and herbs - in the future.

I have been searching for a recipe like this - I made it once in year 8 at school and have been wanting to make again. Absolutely delicious, we'll be having this again.

This was a nice change from the typical baked potato.  I used 1T butter and 1T olive oil and sprinkled with garlic salt and onion salt in place of the regular salt.

I made a couple of these last night to go with my fried fish. The family had pasta (I'm allergic to the sauce) and they were all very intrigued by my potatoes. I'm making then tonight to go with oven baked chicken thighs. These potatoes cooked up alot faster than just baking a potato. Tonight I'm going to play around with the seasonings.

Made for a birthday dinner. Was well received, everyone liked this dish. Potatoes were tasty well done. Used parmeson cheese instead of Romano but was still very good.

Well I was really excited about this recipe. I've had it saved since May and was just waiting until it cooled down. I was very disappointed with this recipe. It is a nice idea but falls short in the flavor category. I'm sure if I play with it I could really like these but I'm not sure its worth it.

I didn't take the recipe home, thought it was simple enough for me to remember but I didn't pay attention to the 425 oven temp!!  Soo I cooked them at 350 and wondered why they weren't cooked completely with 40minutes!  Thought they were good otherwise, and I will make them again and I'll remember the 425 this time!!  Thanks!

These were pretty good.  Two out of the four of us liked them.  I did not top them with the bread crumbs and cheese until they were just about done.  These are really simple to make.

I thought these were very good.  I used extra butter, because it just didn't "seem" like enough.  The only trouble I ran into was that mine didn't "fan out" at all.  You pretty much couldn't tell they were sliced until you cut into them.  But TASTY!!

I thought this made a pretty presentation, but turned out quite dry.  Maybe wrapping in foil first?  But then not sure how they would get crispy on the outside.  I think I will try tweaking a bit more...

These were tasty but were a bit of work for me and took longer to cook than listed. I didn't have Romano on hand so used Parmesan which I really liked. Of course mine didn't look as nice as the ones in the picture, either, but that is to be expected! If I try again I will use olive oil as other user's have.

This was tasty! The presentation was beautiful and the taste was great...kind of a roasted taste! I kept the skins on for the nutrients and I think it really helped the flavor. I also added garlic powder and italian seasoning...yummo! The only reason that this only got 4 stars instead of 5 is because the flavor stayed on the top of the potato and didn't really go down in the layers. If I could figure out a way to get the flavor down in the potato better this would bea 5+ star recipe!

These were just ok... great presentation but so-so on the taste factor. It took a lot longer to cook (1 hr 15 min) and they still had a little bite to them. If I make these again, I'll try different seasonings and different potatoes.

I wanted something different and this worked.  My kids loved the dish and wanted seconds.  The cooking time does depend on the size of your potato.  I think mine took a little longer than the recipe called for.  I just poked one with a fork to test.  I used parm instead of romano since that is what I had on hand.  Also, I should have drizzled and sprinkled everything across the potato instead I went down the potato.  I think going across will help everything drip into the cut part.  I will definitely keep using this recipe.  Quick and easy with ingredients on hand.

Easy, delicious potatoes. They look impressive for not very much work. Anothe way to cut the potatoes is to place two chopsticks, one on either of the long sides of the potato, and use those as a guide to stop you knife so you don't sut all the way through. Thanks!

I love the concept, but they did not cook through when I made them.  How disappointing!  I followed the suggested cooking time (1 hour total) and temperature, but the potatoes were still too firm, which made them not all that enjoyable.  I even used fairly small potatoes.  If I have the time, I will try again and give them an extra 15 minutes or so in the oven.  Of course, who knows when I will find the time to devote that long to cooking potatoes again.  :o)

Very tasty, I couldn't get Romano cheese so I used Asiago instead, next time I will try Romano and see the difference because the Asiago was too much like Parmesan for my taste but if you like Parm give it a try, my husband loved it. Also this is really very easy to make and a nice change

Tasted good but the potatoes turned out to be very dry. My husband couldn't finish his. I probably won't make this recipe again.

these were good but not spectacular I would say. It was helped out with some sour cream so maybe it just needs more toppings, but then might as well just do a traditional baked potato

I found that the spoon technique worked great, I really liked these and I can only imagine what else I could put on them, maybe melted cheddar some sour cream they were really good!

I reduced the butter to 2 tablespoons total and used panko bread crumbs.  For all the work I was not impressed.  I cooked for the total time called for and they still were too firm.  I'll just stick with regular baked potatoes.

These are a pretty presentation. I too, had trouble getting them to really fan out. I also thought they needed some color..parsley maybe? Kinda blah looking..they were okay. I would do them again, but would add some herbs for color and more taste.

Very good and really not that much work to them.  I used parmesan and unseasoned bread crumbs. I seasoned with the salt and pepper as recommended and added a little garlic salt with the parmesan.  Will make these again!

I use red potatoes leave the skin on, I use chop sticks one on each side of the potato to make the cuts verses the other method its faster. These are really good there also referred to as an accordian style potato.

I give this a four, because mine didn't spread out much, which made it very hard for the topping to go between the pieces and instead stayed completely on top. I didn't have romano cheese, and so used blue cheese and panko on top. It still tasted pretty good, but I'll have to find a way to get it to spread out more next time.

Excellent! Found a great new way to  serve my company.I think they look fancy and they leave me a lot of room to play with different ways of seasoning. Plan to experiment with different herbs,EVOO,butter,etc.

These are okay - I wish mine would have gotten crispier!  Here are the things I did differently:  1. I used grated parmesan cheese instead of the romano. 2. The spoon trick worked great! 3. Used yukon potatoes. 4. Left the skins on

Made them on Sunday and they came out perfect Used the suggestion someone made on here by placing between two wooden spoon handles and I was able to slice them in a flash. Very yummy... hubby just requested them again. A must-do for next family getogther.

These were pretty good, not anything super special but a nice change from regular baked potatoe. Mine came out looking nothing like the picture & it didn't really crisp up on the top at all. Next time I think I'll flip them over a few times while baking to evenly brown them. I had a hard time seperating the flaps of the potatoe to get all the spices in there as well. But it was still yummy!

These potatoes were very good, especially the bottoms that were all crispy and crunchy. My husband said they were the best and my 3 year old son ate them. That is amazing because he doesn't normally eat potatoes!

I really enjoyed these potatoes- easy to make and something a little different. I used olive oil instead of butter and panko for the bread crumbs. Next time I think I will season the bread crumbs for more flavor, or maybe add something other than salt and pepper. Should have read everyone elses reviews first! :)

I enjoyed making these and they came out very pretty and tasty.  I liked the mix of the very crunchy outside and soft inside.  We didn't use cheese because we didn't have any and I thought it was a little plain so next time I will make sure I have cheese on hand.

Excellent. I was surfing around for a new easy starch recipe and found it. Took me no time at all. I didn't put in cold water, used a wee bit more bread crumb and romano cheese.  Very tasty and will definitely make again. P.S. Really loved the slicing in a spoon trick!

These were very good. I noticed other reviews said it was bland so I added lots of spices including garlic, cayenne, parsley, basil, oregano etc. I like the idea of turning them while cooking because our bottoms were like potato chip crunchy but the other was not.

DH really liked these, but I thought they were pretty bland. I followed the recipe, but felt they needed a LOT more seasoning. I didn't expect to need to season again after cooking.

Good, and easy.  I didn't bake at designated temp bc I was making chicken at 350 at the same time, so I just went with 350 for a longer amount of time.  Worked just as well. I like the combo of flavors, although I used parmesan.  Thanks for the recipe!

These were just ok for us. I actually found them to be a bit dry. I will attempt to make them again sometime, but maybe with more butter or maybe putting the spices/butter in between the openings of the potato or something. Thanks for posting :)

This was a very unique way to make baked potatoes.  I didn't have any seasoned dry bread crumbs so I put a couple pieces of bread in the toaster and flaked them into a bowl adding italian seasonings.  I found I used a little more butter than what the recipe called for but that was my desire.  The end result was excellent.  I will add garlic next time.

These were an awful lot of work for something that tasted like a baked potato.  They simply didn't have much of a taste.  Perhaps if you add the spices and garlic others suggested they are better.

We really like these potatoes, no creams or sauces, just good tasting potatoes.  I use a seasoning salt and olive oil along with cracked pepper.  Simple ingredients and goes with anything!
