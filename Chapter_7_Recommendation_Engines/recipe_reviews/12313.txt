This pie turned out creamy, light, and delicious with just a few changes I have listed below.  When made correctly, the filling should be thick enough right away when you finish making it.   I will make this pie again!    Here are my changes:  I only used 2 eggs because 3 eggs seemed like a lot.  I used the juice and zest from an entire navel orange.  That is about 1 tbsp. zest and 1/2 cup juice.  I added a tablespoon of flour to the mixture that I heated on the stove so that it would thicken really well.  I cooked and stirred, cooked and stirred until the mixture was very thick, added the butter, and then chilled that mixture for about an hour.  I used a Pillsbury pie crust instead of the type listed in the recipe because I have a lot of them in my freezer.  I used mandarin orange segments, well drained for the bottom.  For the whipped cream, I whipped it to stiff peaks and added some vanilla and honey for additional sweetness.

I made a few small changes.  I used mandarin oranges as suggested (large can), no zest and a graham cracker crust--it was what I had on hand. I also substituted 1 1/4 c. whipped cream for the 1 c. whipping cream.  It cut down on time. It turned out quite nicely.  I will probably be making this alot this summer.  It tastes like an orange julius. Yummy. Thanks.

Okay, I did not actually get to eat a piece of this pie, because I made it for a church function.  BUT, I did taste the "meringue" with a mandarin orange........YUM!!!  Wow, this pie does taste like an orange julius.  I followed the recipe to a "T" except I left out the zest and used large can (15 oz.) of mandarin oranges instead.  If you use these, make sure you drain them WELL.  Not just over the sink, but dump them on paper towels after that.  The reason being you don't want the juice from the slivers to soak the pie crust.  It would fall apart when you tried to cut it. Also, when cooking the egg/orange juice mixture over the stove, really do stir the entire time, because you have to watch carefully.....if you dont remove it at the right moment, it will be either too liquidy or you will end up with scrambled eggs.  You could also save time and cost by using a storebought container of whipped cream instead of whipping it yourself........but I am partial to that "fresh" whipped taste.  The presentation of this pie is awesome.  Little mandarin oranges scattered across the top of the meringue, with a layer underneath you cannot see until you slice.  I wish I could be at this function to hear peoples reviews, but I will definitely make this pie again for the family!

I used a homemade cinnamon graham crust and a large, very WELL drained can of mandarin oranges instead of fresh. I didn't stick mine in the freezer. Mine went right into the fridge until dinner, as others suggested. Very creamsicle-like, which is wonderful. NOTE: Want a firm pie, let it cool in the fridge for a bit before serving. I made mine in the morning and let it set until dinnertime.

I would give this 5 stars for taste, but like all the others, mine ended up a runny mess so I give it a 3 overall.

I chilled this for 8 hours, then folded in the whipped cream and let it chill over night and it was still ran all over when I cut it.

I think I will add a sheet or two of gelatin to the base mixture or perhaps use some cornstarch to thicken up the egg mixture and give it more body next time. It has potential but it's really missing something to keep it from running.  

In the meantime, instead of serving as a pie, I layered put it into cups and served it as more of a trifle than a pie. It worked great that way!

We love this recipe!  We have made it several times, word for word followng the recipe, and it always comes out great!  The key to not getting a runny pie is DO NOT FREEZE!  As I said, we have made it several times, and it was always a perfect consistency, creamy and fully set.  We always chilled it in the refrigerator.  The last time I made it, it was last minute to bring to a cook-out.  I was worried about the timing and being outside, so I froze it for a couple of hours before going.  By the time dessert came around, it had thawed, and it was very runny.  It was the only time I froze it, and the only time it came out runny.  So, I think the key is, chill either to room temperature or in the fridge.  An experienced cook at the bbq told me that dairy breaks down when frozen, so that's probably what happened, it is probably a problem with the cream.  We've also tried a few variations that worked out really well - sub lemonade for oj and fresh raspberries for orange slices for raspberry lemonade smoothie pie, or mango puree for oj and any tropical fruit (bananas, mango slices, or stick with oranges) for fresh fruit garnish.  I'm making one for a start-of-summer pot-luck at the office tomorrow :)

I added 2 teaspoons of orange gelatin to pie filling to make sure it will not run. I blended filling after i added butter to it and it gave it smooth texture,before it was kind of grainy. I used wheeped topping insted of heavy cream.overall very good cake.

I messed the topping up the first time. I didn't read the instructions properly and put the butter in the pan with the orange juice, sugar and eggs so had to start again as it didn't thicken properly. I used mandarin oranges and a digestive biscuit crust (I'm English and wasn't sure what was meant by vanilla wafers). The only reason this isn't a five star is because I felt it lost something in presentation when it was cut it didn't sit in a firm slice the topping oozed all over the dish although that might be something I did. Great taste though my guests loved it. Thanks

Simple and yummy.  My mom made it for Thanksgiving, and everyone liked it.  She made a cornflake crust (I checked, and there is a recipe for such a crust on this web-site if anyone is interested) for it and it complimented it quit nicely.

I made this pie for a pot luck at my mom's last week.  It was a huge hit.  After reading all the reviews I made the following changes  I used a home made graham cracker crust.   I added a tablespoon of cornstarch disolved in about 1/4 cup of water to the mixture on the stove to be sure everything thickened well and did not turn runny when it came out of the refridgerator.  Because I was a little short on time, I used Cool Whip instead of whipping fresh cream.  I used orange slices fresh from the tree on top with ribbons of zest.  It was a beautiful pie and was eaten up quickly.  Everyone wanted the recipe!

I experimented with this recipe.  Made it as per recipe.  Like others I thought it could have more body.  So I played with it a little. Found that if you added 1/2 small package sugar free jello to cooked mixture and the other half to the heavy cream and I used 2 cups heavy cream instead found it to be alot in crust but , when I make pie.... I want Pie not a tease of sample.

Very unique and refreshing, though rich. Doesn't travel well, and may be better served nearly frozen. Awesome!

It tastes really good, but it's far too runny, and really doesn't present well. I was going to use it for a potluck, but I think I'll feed it to the boy and choose a different recipe and make it last minute. It's just not very table-presentable.

I used mandarin oranges and had no problem with the pie being runny. I did make it the day before, so it was in the fridge about 18 hrs. Everyone who tried it said it was good , hubby really liked but I thought it needed something. I also used crushed vanilla wafers, butter and sugar for the crust.

The flavor of this recipe is very good, and because of this I regret rating it only at 3 stars, but I had the same problem as Kez.  The filling seemed soft so I placed the pie in the freezer and it firmed a little but by the time everyone served themselves (a potluck) and placed their slices on their plates, the slice collapsed into a pool of filling.  Maybe someone can suggest a variation?
