These were so good! 5 stars for sure! I honestly thought 1 hour and I would be finding my chicken dry and tiny, but they were perfect! I did cut them a little bigger than bite size, but not by much. I got about 6 pieces per thigh. Very good with such good peanut sauce. I didn't find it spicy, which was fine for me. I served it with rice and some sauteed peppers.

Followed recipe exactly, opened foil last 15 minutes and stirred chicken often, the sauce thickened up nice and the chicken got a bit of browning.   Excellent with jasmine rice and some lime.  Family loved it will make again.

Delicious. I did a double batch in the crock pot and they came out perfect. Also reduced the sugar by using 2 Tablespoon sorghum and 1/8 cup stevia and blended the marinade smooth. Husband said after first sample, “don’t throw out any of that sauce (I hadn’t planned on it in the first place), I can put it on about anything!” This recipe will be a repeat in this family.

My whole family loved this. I did open the foil for the last 15 minutes because it looked like it was not going to get the sticky consistency of the photo. After the last 15 minutes of open foil cooking time, it was perfect!! I will make this again.

Yes, I will make it again.  The chicken was very tender, the sauce was tasty but a little too spicy for me.   I used 2 tbsp of Siracha as a sub for the chili paste which I didn't have.  Next time, I will just cut it in half.

Didn't have corn starch so I added 1 Tbsp flour and 1 Tbsp baking soda.  Also substituted chili sauce with habanero sauce.  Very tender and delicious!

I made this and WOW it was good.  I left the thighs whole instead of cutting them first.  I really thought 1 hour at 400 degrees was risky.  It was not.  They were perfect.  We are already planning on making again.

Delicious!  It was just a tad too spicy, so I'll cut down on the chile garlic a bit next time. I topped it with al dente sautéed mushrooms, green peppers and red peppers, then a sprinkle of chopped scallions (no cilantro - don't care for it.  Will make this often.  I think It'd be yummy with beef or shrimp instead of chicken, also!

This was a pretty good recipe. My oven runs hot so I baked it less 25 degrees and for a few minutes longer so it wouldn't burn. I threw in some extra asparagus too, which turned out pretty good. I think a vegetable is definitely needed and next time I'll probably choose broccoli or zucchini. I think water chestnuts or cashews would give it some good crunch, but since I didn't have any I sprinkled panko breadcrumbs over my bowl. There's lots you can do with this recipe.

I would make it again and it is in my special box of daily recipes now. However, I did add more sugar due to the saltiness of soy sauce and hoisin sauce. I used the low sodium soy sauce and yet it's still pretty salty. I would cut down the soy sauce to 1/3 cup instead of 1/2 cup like in the recipe and increase the sugar to 1/2 or 3/4 cup if you want a bit sweeter side.

This recipe was delicious!!!  Made it exactly per the recipe aside from the finishing cilantro and will definitely be making it again.  Like all the other reviews I thought an hour was too long but it was perfect, I even turned the oven off but kept the chicken in bc my husband was late from work and it was still perfect.  It wasn’t spicy at all though and will be throwing some sriracha sauce in the next time to up the heat level.  Amazing!!!

Stumbled upon this recipe when I was searching for a recipe to use chicken thighs, and we just loved it! I served it with Parmesan garlic asparagus and Thai pineapple fried rice. The only thing I might try next time is setting the oven at 350 instead of 400 because a lot of the sauce burned onto the aluminum foil: but I’m not really complaining because the chicken was perfect after the 1 hour bake, and the sauce that didn’t burn was scrumptious! Maybe parchment between the foil and the chicken would help too.

I used sriracha in lieu of the chili garlic paste and added sliced water chestnuts, sliced mushrooms and broccoli.  I then placed this over a bed of fried rice.

Won't be making again. The peanut butter marinade wasn't our thing. We like the more traditional stir fry type flavors. We used boneless chicken breasts because hubs doesn't care for the thighs. We bake on 350 for a little over 30 min. Since we weren't sure if it would make a sauce for over rice we skipped serving it that way. With the moisture from the breasts we could've thicken the sauce & put over rice, but decided not to try again. Have no idea what the cilantro does for this & we like cilantro.

Omg this is incredible! I didn’t have the chili-paste so I just used extra minced garlic and chili powder. It was fantastic! I will definitely be making this again!

It's cooking now but I already know.  Ok it's done. As soon as I smelled the sauce I knew I was going to like it. Made as written except no cilantro and no peanut butter I took some raw peanuts and smashed them in my mortar and pistil. Seems like it worked fine. I threw it on top of some left over sushi rice, with steamed broccoli with some lemon squeezed on it to cut through the sweet and spicy on the chicken and give the plate some balance. I will be making this again.

This is awesome! So far 5 of us have eaten it and every  one of  us loves it.  First time I made it just as stated, second time I marinated the chicken most of the day, and it was even better (if that's possible, lol).  The only reason I won't be making this more frequently are the amounts of salt and sugar ( which is pretty substantial since we absolutely do NOT leave any of the sauce behind ;-)  

I'm experimenting to find a way to have this ready in the freezer for visitors, it's always wonderful to have a nice dinner planned after entertaining/sight seeing with your friends and relatives all day.  So far I know I can at least make the sauce and freeze it, and cut up and bag the thighs separately, which will save a lot of time right there.  I think I could toss the frozen chicken in the bag with the frozen sauce and let it thaw overnight, but I'll try it on us first to make sure the chicken doesn't end up mushy from being over-marinated.  

I also want to try using a shallow pan very tightly covered, as I find wrapping that foil package up  and sealing it well pretty tricky for some reason (this is probably just me, I don't know if anyone else has an issue with this).

I made it, and mostly followed the recipe.  Like another commenter, I used whole thighs with skin on.  I didn't have bottled hoisin sauce.  After looking up a recipe for homemade hoisin sauce I saw that hoisin's base was soy sauce and peanut butter.  Since this recipe already had those two ingredients I added what was different, rice vinegar, Chinese 5-spice,  sesame oil.    I grated some of the ginger, then decided to chop it in thin slices.  instead of Chile-garli paste, I used siracha sauce.  I marinaded it for an hour or more.    We wrapped the chicken thighs with marinade in triple aluminum foil and baked it outside in our Big Green Egg at a temperature between 350 and 400 for an hour.  It was delicious!!!! Great recipe.  Thank you rhapsody112 for it.

This was wonderful! I served it over roasted veggies and everyone loved it.   I left out the brown sugar and used a 1/4 cup of honey for a little sweetness.
I'm looking forward to making it again.

I think the flavors of this dish are pretty good on their own. I only added half of the amount of chili garlic sauce because I have small children and I'm breastfeeding. The only reason I gave this 4 out of 5 stars is because I think broiling the chicken at the end would have been the ultimate finisher for this dish. I've made it twice in one week, and I just love the sauce and how tender the chicken is. I've cooked it in the oven and on the stove top. I also added in some steamed broccoli at the end. Highly recommended as a great marinade and sauce. Experiment with how you cook the meat. I could see this on the grill, even a George Foreman grill would be good! Very versatile recipe.
