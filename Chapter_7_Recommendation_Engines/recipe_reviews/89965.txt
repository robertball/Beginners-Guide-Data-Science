This recipe is missing the liquids needed to cook dried beans. You need at least 2 1/2 cups of liquid for 1 cup of beans. I didn't drain the corn and added 2 cups of veg broth and 2 cups of water. I topped with  grated cheddar. It turned out like a cousin of chili.

Very good taste, thick like chili.  I also used canned (two) blacked eye peas, and did not drain them, the tomatoes, or the corn. I also sprinkled the cheese on top before serving instead of mixing it in, and used a little sour cream at the table. My husband really liked it, even though he is skeptical of vegetarian dishes!  A word to future cooks: I was scared by 1/4 cup of chili powder.  I started with 1/8 cup, but it was a little bland, so I added more.

Do not use the dry variety beans. Must use canned beans or it turns out too dry. do not drain tomatoes or corn. Other than that a great fast and easy dish.

This has now become a staple for meatless monday, don't worry if you forgot to soak your beans overnight - you're going to cook them all day anyway - I add 5 cups of water and use dry beans and then add a cup of dry brown rice about 2 hours before serving

This was wonderful! I'm not a vegetarian, but wow, this was good. I can't eat much of it though with low blood sugar issues... too many carbs for me, but my mouth waters sitting down to even a little bit of it. I changed a couple things: used fresh tomatoes instead of canned, and canned beans, not draining them. Also, I excluded the cheese altogether and then when served, added sour cream, a few fresh tomatoes and avocado. Voila! Yummy. My hubby is SO not a vegetarian and so I put cooked sausage in it for him and he loved it :)

This recipe really...flopped for me. I'm so sorry but there is something totally missing here. And it is the liquids. I love cooking beans in a slow cooker. But when you have to cook beans for nearly 22 hours, there is something totally wrong with the way a recipe is written. And to start this recipe by extra 12 hours ahead too because of a bean soak. You shouldn't have to go to so much trouble. I started this a bean soak on a Monday night before going to bed about 8. Following morning put everything together about 9am, by 11:30am smelling good, but beans are crunchy. 2pm, same deal, by 4pm, still flustered...by 6pm adding a 28 crushed tomatoes(only to see that the can is mismarked and it's actually tomato sauce) by 8pm adding 2 cups of water and then at 11:30pm adding another 2 cups of water and beans are partly crunchy with some, stightly soft on others. I was at the point of not wanting to get up every couple of hours to check on the status, I went to bed. By 7:30am now Wed morning. The batch looks like mushed chili, still smells good, tastes ok beans are firm but soft....the over all batch isn't that appealing and if I decided to add rice and cheddar, it's going to look like glop. I'm not overally pleased with the outcome because of the shear frustration of the amount of time to get this recipe complete. I went back and looked and talked to others over my frustration and this recipe needs more water to do as the author states. I won't be making this again. I'm sorry.

I thought that this recipe was good. Not fantastic, but a good meal. I didn't put the rice in, makes it more like a stew.

This is really good served with sour cream at the table.  I was skeptical about only cooking the beans for 2 hours and little amount of liquid.  I will try this again, but cook longer, even the onions still had some crunch to them and I do not usually expect that with this type of recipe.  The flavor was really good though, so I just think it needs to be tweaked in terms of liquid amount and time.

This recipe turned out great!  My 3-year-old, 1-year-old, husband and mother-in-law all ate it enthusiastically! I did take some of the suggestions...after soaking beans for 6 hours, I still added 2 cups of broth and 2 cups of water...it had plenty of liquid this way...maybe could have used a bit less.  I also (for my husband mainly, and to use up some freezer items) added some chorizo sausage and let it cook in the crock pot with the other ingredients...on low for 6 hours.  This could be a very versatile recipe, adding other vegetables or beans.  We ate it with corn bread and it was SO yummy!!

LOVED this yummy, easy recipe. I took everyone's advice and ended up substituting the black-eyed peas for black beans.  I also did not add the rice or cheese to the mix and simply put them in each separate bowl. AND, my husband recommended nixing the chili powder and using chopped green chillies instead - great idea! I am not a cook and actually quite despise food prep, and this recipe was easy, tasty, healthy (even bought organic veggies), and a definite winnder for our home.

I agree with other reviews ... Use canned beans and do not drain liquids.  I also added a can of chopped chilies.  I found that it was not cooking enough in my slow cooker after two hours so I transferred it to a large pot on the stove.  It came out great!  I also used more than 1/2 c of cheese ... Gooey and delicious!

I used one can of black-eye peas, one can of black beans and 32 oz can of tomatoes.  Served rice on the side and extra cheese and sour cream.  Everyone loved it, even me although I'm not fond of beans.

I used canned black beans instead of the dry black-eyed peas.  We all really enjoyed it.  My 2-year-old event ate it!  We took the earlier tip and also served it with sour cream and sliced avacado and ate it with some tortillas.  My wife and son sprinked additional cheese on top.  It was good!

So-So.  Needed liquid to cook (5 cups of vegetarian broth) and way longer than just 2 hours for dry beans.

I added 64 oz of liquid and 3 hours of cooking time and it was still a disaster. Inedible. This is the only recipe I've ever had trouble with and I use allrecipes.com about 3-4 x a week. This one is a bust!

Too dry on the ingredients list and way too short on cooking time.

I soaked the beans for 17 hours, added 3 cups vegetable stock, 1 cup water and left in the cooker, on high, for 3 hours. Beans were still crunchy. I'll be checking it every hour or so.

The blend of flavors is great and, yes, you will want every bit of that chili powder. Hell, throw another spice in there! Maybe some oregano or sage?

This is a big hit with my kiddos. I use caned peas as well but I drain them and the corn but not the tomatoes.  I started making it when one of my kids gave up meat for Lent so they like the recipe as is, but generally I add cubed chicken breast and let it cook done before adding the rice and cheese.

Confession: I didn't read the recipe thoroughly enough. I accidentally started with Black Beans rather than Black eyed peas. By the time I realized, it was too late. I liked the recipe overall but made some changes to it, so here's what I did: Besides using black beans, the only other change I made was that I didn't have green peppers, but I'm sure they would've been delicious! Next time I'll add more onion. I used 1 med. onion and it wasn't enough. I also added about a cup of chicken broth, since so many reviews said it was too dry. Probably not necessary, as mine was slightly soupy, but made reheating easier. Make sure to SOAK the beans and COOK the rice like the recipe calls for. Most of the bad reviewers, it seems, forgot to do this. I cooked this much longer than the recipe called for too-- about 8 hours on low (again, I hadn't thoroughly read the recipe before starting, and I'd planned on a long, slow-cooked meal). This timing was perfect: beans were done, but not mush. It filled my 4 Quart slow cooker practically to the brim. So I didn't fully follow the recipe, but it was very tasty, and I'll likely make again-- next time I'll just read it more thoroughly!

Needs more flavor. It was alright, but not over the top. I used can black eye peas, and added a couple more cans of mixed pinto/northern beans, just to fill the crockpot up. It needs a different flavor like maybe a dry pack of ranch dressing mix? Don't be afraid of the 1/4 cup chili powder, you will need it, or the flavor would be more bland than it already is.

I would not do this again.  It looked and smelled okay, but it was very bland.  It was kind of like eating no flavor glop with a lot of taco seasoning on it.  Really didn't do much for my family, and they are not normally picky.  I followed the recipe to the T, and it just doesn't taste like much.

I followed the recipe pretty closely but put it in the slowcooker on the lowest setting for 10 hours, and added 3 cups of boiling water at the start.  That may have been a little too much water, I would probably try 2 - 2 1/2 cups next time.  I thought it was excellent!

Yummy, fresh-tasting, and simple.  I used a large can of black-eyed peas (rinsed to eliminate some of the salt, etc), didn't drain tomotoes or creamed corn, and the consistency was fine. Thanks for a simple, meatless recipe with protein!
