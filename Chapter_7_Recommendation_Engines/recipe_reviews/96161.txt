This recipe was delicious, though I made a few modifications.  First I cooked the scallops in the olive oil and s&p as directed, but I added a little garlic powder to it to give them some zing.  Then instead of pulling the scallops out of the pan before adding the sauce...I kept them in the pan and poured the OJ/Dried Basil/Dijon Mustard mix right in there with the scallops so they would absorb the flavor.  Then I added a couple of teaspoons of sugar to the sauce to eliminate some of the acidity and tanginess, and I also added a tablespoon of flour as it was cooking so that it would thicken a bit.  I served it over whole wheat linguini and sprinked with fresh grated parmesan.  It was absolutely delicious.  I'm going to add this one to my "recipe's to make often" collection.

This turned out really good.  One of my fav dishes at a local cafe is orange seared scallops, this was better!  I used double the orange juice (wanted a good amount of sauce for pasta) and put the scallops in with the sauce maybe 5 minutes.  This was great over angel hair pasta with lots of fresh grated parmesan to up the creaminess.  A new favorite dish, will be great for company!

We enjoyed this a lot, but will try it again with fresh basil. Basil is one of those spices that has much more flavor when the fresh herb is used.

This was a big hit at a luncheon I hosted for several of the fussiest ladies I know!  I added a can of mandarin oranges along with the juice instead of the regular orange juice.  FABULOUS!  I have served this over brown rice, jasmine rice, linguine...very versatile!  A keeper!

I used fresh basil, and substituted Chilean sea bass for half of the scallops.  I served it over angel hair pasta, and it was delicious!  As good as any restaurant meal I've had, and super fast and easy.  I will definitely make this again, and try other mild fish and shellfish, maybe even chicken, and serve with rice!  I can't imagine going wrong with this recipe - it's a keeper!!!

I loved this recipe, but I actually used it with jumbo shrimp instead of scallops! It was delicious.

Wow!  This is a really great recipe!  I'm not a very good cook, but this was really simple to prepare and it tasted great.  I used bay scallops and didn't have any pasta, but the recipe still worked just fine.  I will definitley be using this one again!

Wonderful recipe!  I have to say that I should have purchased some bigger sized scallops but small ones were fine!  Bravo!  So easy and delicious!

Vegetarian version!  I don't do scallops, so I substituted button mushroom caps.  The only thing I would do differently is double the sauce - it was scrumptious!  I served angle hair pasta with the wilted spinach on top and the mushrooms and sauce on top of that.  Mmmmmm.....

Sorry, I was disappointed with this recipe.  Saw a suggestion to use fresh O.J.  Big mistake.  It made the sauce very bitter so the scallops tasted bad.  I added some shrimp in with the scallops and they tasted better.  Guess the scallops absorb more flavors (good and bad) from the sauce.

This is excellent. Great to serve to guests. I served over whole wheat pasta. I used fresh basil, and will use a lot more next time, really gives a great taste, and also fresh parm really makes a difference. I didn't add the butter, and used 1 cup of oj rather than 2/3 as some reviews mentioned for more sauce, but it wasn't necessary, and may have made it a tiny bit too orange-y. Bt still very good and will definitely make again!
