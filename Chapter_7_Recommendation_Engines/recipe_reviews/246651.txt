This recipe offered me hope in gluten free, delicious cookies.  Without a doubt the recipe will be revisited. Tried leaving out chips but immediately added as the chips add moisture.

Good cookies. I used parchment paper on the baking sheet instead of cooking spray and still turned out great. Thanks.
