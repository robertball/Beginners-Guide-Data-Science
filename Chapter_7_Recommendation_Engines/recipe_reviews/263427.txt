I followed the recipe exactly.  After about 5 hours I got nervous and took it out to see how far along it was with cooking.  It was completely cooked, dry and floating in red wine. I had guests coming so drained off all the liquid - and tried to brown the top under the griller.  It was not good at all.

I only had 2 pounds of lamb so I adjusted the cooking time. The slow cooking in the oven made the meat so tender that it just melted in your mouth. Baking it uncovered at 400 degrees made the skin crispy with great texture. It was my first time to cook lamb. I will definitely use this recipe again.  Itâ€™s a favorite.
