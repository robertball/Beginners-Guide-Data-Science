Made this dish for a neighborhood party and ended up leaving it at home because it was not good at all.  WAY TOO MUCH Vinegar!  I had to look at the recipe 3 or 4 times when I saw my wife about to pour 2 full cups of vinegar into the mix(We dbld the recipe.)  I ended up putting some mayo in it and some ranch dressing mix to five it some flavor and it was better but still too strong on the vinegar.  Also the recipe using ALL the grease from the bacon which I think is just way too unhealthy.

This was awesome!  Got many compliments at a recent party. This is a very tangy potato salad. If you don't like a lot of vinegar, cut back a bit. Also, mine didn't seem thick enough, so I added about a 1/2 tsp cornstarch to thicken. *Take note also- 6 red potatoes will not serve 8. Most red potatoes are rather small. If you use 6 med. red skinned potatoes it will serve about 4. I doubled the recipe and used about 12-14 med.potatoes.  It made about 10 servings.

A very good, tangy red potato salad.  I cheated a little by cutting up the potatoes and then cooking them in the microwave rather than boiling them.  Very similar to a recipe I have which uses gobs of mayonnaise -- the same taste with MUCH less fat.  Leftovers taste great cold or reheated. I'll definitely make the red potato salad again.

I omitted half of the bacon drippings.  If I used them all the dish would be a greasy mess.  Perhaps tasty but way too much fat.  Also, the recipe should indicate the need to temper the egg prior to adding to the dish.  You get scrambled eggs if you don't.

I didn't like the amount of vinegar. ...that's all I could taste.   I think if I make it again I will eliminate the vinegar and egg and just add the celery, bacon and onion over the potatoes.

this had a good flavor, but when I added the egg, it didn't thicken at all, just ended up more like egg drop soup. should've used corn starch.

This is great if you like something with a vinegar taste.
