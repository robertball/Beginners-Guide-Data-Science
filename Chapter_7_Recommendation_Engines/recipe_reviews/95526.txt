I experimented and added a pinch of salt, a couple spoons of tahini, and more lemon juice.  The flavors really came out after sitting overnight in the fridge.  It makes a great summer snack or light lunch with fresh veggies.

YUM! I just used a whole jar of quartered artichokes and a can of garbanzo beans (drained) plus other ing. as listed - ran it through the food processer until it was really smooth. Goes great with veggies! It just might help me get back on track with my diet - it kinda helps with the salty food cravings w/o resorting to chips.

This wasn't inedible, it just wasn't something that tasted particularly good.  It was fairly plain, mostly tasting of garlic.  It was also dry.  I added 2 T of olive oil to try to make it creamier.  I think it really needs tahini.  I made this following the main directions, but I got a good laugh at the alternate directions of using prepared hummus instead of garbanzo beans.  I'm sure that would taste a lot better, but I got a kick out of the idea of making hummus out of, well, hummus.  Sorry, but I won't be making this again.

Amazing.  Added about 5 or 6 cherry tomatoes, a little dab of Italian seasoning, and instead of water I used a little of the juice from the can of garbonzo beans and some olive oil.  I can't stop eating this!

I would suggest hand cutting the artichokes if you want to taste them.  Putting them into the food processor blends them and just adds to the flavor of the hummus, I enjoyed it much more with them hand cut into a more chuncky consistency.

Delicious & will make again.  I added half of the marinade from the artichokes for a creamier hummus.

Did not have the flavor I was hoping it would with the artichokes in it. I used 3 cloves of garlic hoping that would help and also some paprika and it still needed something else. It was also a little dry- didnt stick to the veggies to well. I like mine a little cramier.

This rocks!  I've been eating it for lunch (with pita) every day this week.  Yum!
If it is on the dry side, just add water by the teaspoon until it's the creamy texture you want.

We all liked this a lot. Perhaps it matters what kind of marinated artichokes you use.  The ones I used were marinated in olive oil and spices.

This was a great new recipe we just made. My 3 year old and I just inhaled it. Easy to make and I took the advice of the other rater substituting peanut butter for tahini. Will definitely present this to munchers...
