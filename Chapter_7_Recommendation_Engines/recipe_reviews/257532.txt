Made as written. A couple thoughts.  1. As the Chef noted,  baking times vary given thickness. His footnote doesn't print with the recipe, so be aware.  1/8" is too thick for the strips to crisp in the time frame given in the recipe; plan accordingly.  1/16" is better and slices crisp nicely.  A mandoline is REALLY helpful for this.  At 1/8", I might consider a dehydrator after the eggplant takes on color in the oven, or baking them on a wire rack, or lowering the temp to 225F taking into account the longer baking time they require.   2. While the flavor was good, I thought even 1/8th tsp of cayenne too much; it overwhelmed the other more traditional, "bacon" flavors. Still I like spicy and will make this again; both with, and without an adjusted amount of cayenne.

I added black pepper mixed with brown sugar yum thanks for sharing :)

I did not care for this recipe. It takes forever and for whatever reason most of my eggplant burned before ever getting crispy. I couldn't imagine this being remotely workable.

First let me say I love this "eggplant bacon." It is great alternative to real bacon. I am vegetarian & it is good on sandwiches like vegetarian "BLT", crumbled on salads, with scrambled tofu & even for snacking.  In regards to the recipe, the only changes I made was using Braggs Amino Acids in place of  Worcestershire sauce & a few drops liquid stevia instead of maple syrup and asafoetida powder in place of garlic powder. Yum Yum. I have already tried it twice & plan on making at least once a week ongoing. ??

I looked at about a dozen recipes and pulled a hint from one- I marinated the eggplant in the sauce for about 30 minutes. Also, though I used a mandolin and made my slices about 1/16 “ thick ( or should I say thin) I found I had to double the cooking time once flipped for a crispy result. Cooled on a wire rack. Best blt+ Avacado EVER. Added a whole new level of flavor and I look forward to adding it to many things.  He’s John never disappoints!

By itself, the flavor was...hmm, odd so I couldn’t rate it higher. However, in a ELT, LOVED it! I had in the dehydrator at 160 for 3-3 1/2 hours, and it worked out perfectly.

I spent far too much time trying to make this and was not real happy with the flavor afterwards.

This did not turn out at all.  The marinade was not bacon flavored.  The eggplant never got stiffer.  My cutting tool was a peeler and it did not work with the soft eggplant.  I think we'll just skip the pretend meats.

Important vegan note: Worcestershire sauce usually contains anchovy extract. Have not made this, so please refer to other reviews for accurate star ratings.

If you are looking at avoiding animal products, make sure your Worcestershire is the vegan kind because the regular one has anchovies in it.
