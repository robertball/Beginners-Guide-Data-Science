I don't have the PANASONIC OVEN thingy but the rub on snapper baked works just fine. I'm a skeptic and it sure sounds like those reviews were commercials for Panasonic. Give me a break!

This is one of the best fish recipes I have used, and we eat a lot of fish.  I baked the snapper in a regular oven for 15 minutes at 400 degrees and it was perfect.  This topping would be good on almost any fish.

I followed the directions exactly, and they were right on the money.  I  used the ingredients as specified.  We really enjoyed red snapper cooked in the Panasonic Countertop Induction Oven.  This is a new appliance for me, and I'm still feeling my way around, with it.  In addition, we usually cook salmon at home, so I went out on a limb with the red snapper.  It is a mild, white-flesh fish, with a lovely pinkish skin.  The flavors suggested by the author are clean and light, and they do not overpower this lovely fish.  I served it with fresh steamed broccoli, and it was a perfect companion.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was a very good easy to follow recipe. The flavors of lemon zest, fresh basil and fresh parsley combined with freshly crushed garlic creates a fragrant subtle depth of flavors that compliment this fish. I allowed the flavors to marinade together in the olive oil for an hour, then crushed freshly ground pepper into the marinade before brushing on both sides of the fish before placing into a 400 degree oven for 20 minutes. The fish was flaky and flavorful but not overpowered.  I will try this next on Mahi. I think this marinade will work on any flaky fish. This was a great recipe we will keep as a regular in rotation.

This was pretty good. I was only cooking a red Snapper filet, not a whole fish. I prepared the marinade from nice fresh herbs from my garden, parsley and oregano. I did add a few cherry tomatoes and cooked it on a grill mat in my gas grill. Very nice flavor. I think the herb mixture would be good on any white fish. I thought it was a little heavy on the lemon. That grilled lemon squeezed on after cooking put the lemon quota over the top.

My Italian hubby absolutely loved this! He grew up eating fish this way, fresh out of the Tyrrhenian Sea. I couldn't believe how well the PanasonicÂ® Countertop Induction Oven cooked this, and kept it so moist. Add a nice squeeze of fresh lemon juice over this, and enjoy!
