I learned this recipe a long time ago from a fabulous elder italian grandma.  It must have a taste of garlic and even better the garlic should be cooked well almost burnt.  You should cut the pieces of escarole small or it becomes a long stringy glob.  Also, you can make it into a soup by adding chicken stock and easier for those who don't like the thick gooey consistency.  This meal satisfies your hunger without a doubt.  Please use at least 4 cloves of garlic and sprinkle some granulated garlic as well.  You can add very small meatballs with the quart or so of chicken stock and it is like italian wedding soup

This was creamy and delicious.  Everyone in my family loved it.  I only used one large head of escarole and one can of beans.  I wouldn't have been able to fit any more escarole into my largest pan, it was towering!  Of course, like spinach, it melted down to next to nothing, but it was enough for a side dish for dinner for the three of us with a smidge left over.  I used extra garlic - probably chopped three or four cloves and I left out the parsley.  Just because I forgot it.  I also added a few gratings of romano cheese and stirred it in.  I will definitely make this again.

I loved this recipe, but my husband and children did not.  So I had to give it a four because of this.  I thought it was really good.  Only thing I'm changing next time is when I get the escarole I'm going to chop it into smaller pieces and throw out the bottoms and any other white part.  The white part had a bitter after taste.  I'm going to keep feeding it to the family, make them learn to like it. :o)

Thanks for this recipe!! I had been dying to find a recipe similar to a dish I vaguely remembered that my father used to make. Using this recipe, I altered it to fit the way my father used to make it, which was to simmer the cannellini beans in chicken broth and mix the entire mixture in a baking dish with day old bread. Thanks for the recipe, and for the nostalgia!!

the taste was great- hubby loved it- but i found it to be "mushy"- the beans were cooked much longer than necessary. i also would have preferred a chicken stock base instead of only the juice from the beans. i think the escarole, garlic, oil and salt and peppers should cook first for 10 minutes, then the beans and some chicken stock added second and cooked for another 3 minutes max. good taste but cooking directions need to be tweaked.

Absolutely amazing!  I added about a cup of tomato sauce and sprinkled parmesan cheese on it at the table.  With these tweaks it's just like the escarole and beans at our favorite Italian restaurant!

I would give this 6 stars if I could.  I was afraid it would be bitter, but it's not!  It's delicious and I am going to make it again today!

Outstanding! I made it into a soup by using only one escarole, 2 cups of chicken broth, a cup of Prego pasta sauce and 2 sliced chicken basil sausages. Wow!

This was excellent, and easy to make.  I had never had escarole or cannellini beans.  Next time I will only use the leaves on the escarole, and cut out all of the "rib" part.  I used 3 teaspoons of olive oil instead of tablespoons.  I didn't use the parsley; instead used some of the "grinder" seasoning.

This was nostalgic comfort food at its best for me--took me right back to my childhood and outstanding food prepared by my Italian grandma and my mother. The recipe doesn't specify, but the escarole should be roughly chopped. Also, you'll think you're starting out with a lot but, like other greens, it gives off a lot of moisture and cooks down to a fraction of its original volume.  Thanks for the memories!

Great recipe. This was a go to inexpensive meal when I was growing up. My mom made it the same way as this recipe and it is great. However, she sometimes made it with crushed tomatoes, added some sliced sausage and small pasta (ditallini). I slow cook the recipe with the additions in a crock pot. It's the bomb!

Italian soul food.  This is the recipe my grandmother from Italy handed down.  A quick, delicious meal.  The only modification I made from her recipe is to toss in a handful of pancetta when I have it.  Fry for a minute or two, add garlic then escarole, beans, etc.  I don't bother with the two pans.  Thanks for sharing Krista.

Delicious, I loved this. The only things that I did different was to add 2 cloves of minced garlic, and to drain and rinse the white beans. I know that the juice in the can lends to the "creamy" texture, but I didn't want all of that sodium and starchy liquid. Very tasty and healthy, will make again!

This is so good, I always add chicken stock to make it soupier, a little mor garlic, and cooked Italian sausage - I use bulk sausage.  Of course, you must top it with parmesan cheese.  mmmmm

This recipe was great! It is my favorite Italian dish, and there are so many things to do with it. I added some cooked chicken pieces this time, but I really love Italian sausage in it as well. It is great with chicken broth and day old hard bread as someone suggested. I only had one head of escarole, so I used some frozen chopped spinash too. Wonderful!! Thanks!

Can you say authentic?  No need for two pans, I sautee the escarole with a chopped onion about 4 or 5 cloves of garlic, the salt and crushed red.  Then I  drain the beans and add them to the pot with a couple cups of chicken broth.  I also add some browned bulk italian sausage for a complete meal.  Oh so happy.

My father's fiance is Italian, and an amazing cook. I always wondered how to make this, and this recipe gave me an excellent base to make it like she does. I would use less beans than this recipe calls for and much, much, MUCH more garlic. No black pepper, the red pepper does a fine job at bringing some spice to it as is. Someone earlier suggested 4 cloves, I would use more than that even, much more. I used minced garlic from a jar. I used the 4 cloves in the beans, and on top of that I cooked the escarole with another 4, at least.  This was great served over rice (boiled in water with margarine, chopped onion and chicken bouillon) and with italian bread on the side.

Well, i'm obviously in the minority here ... I was NOT impressed with this meal .. probably because I'm not the biggest bean lover.  My husband said "well, not EVERYTHING you make can be good." Hmmph.  There were no instructions as to how to cut the escarole and so I left the leaves whole ... big mistake!  If you're going to make this I would suggest cutting the leaves up in slightly bigger than bite-sized pieces.  I also felt the bean to escarole ratio was wrong .. too many beans!  I used two large heads of escarole ... maybe if I had chopped the leaves it would have seemed like there was more escarole because the escarole DID seem to lump up in the middle of the pan.  DEFINITELY use more garlic.  I used 3 cloves AND garlic powder and it could have used more.  Also, at the suggestion of relatives who *love* this meal I served it over penne pasta.  Apparantly this is the rage in Italian restaurants on the East coast.  I don't know, living on the West coast myself (and since I LOVE Italian food I doubt that even if I did live on the East coast I would order beans over yummy cheesy saucy pasta at a restaurant!).  All in all, I won't be making this recipe again.

Good side dish, really easy to prepare.  Only thing I would change is add some garlic powder along with more garlic in the  mix.  And yes TWeak the cooking time, my beans ended up being mushy.  Good idea  though.

I liked this quite a bit.  I forgot the parsley but didn't miss it.  I doubled the garlic and added a little garlic powder to the beans as well.  I used beans I cooked from dried, so instead of juice from the cans I used a little vegetable broth.  My beans were not as cooked as canned beans are, that and with the broth I didn't get the creamy texture everyone described.  I only had a little escarole so I used 1 part escarole, 2 parts curly endive.  I used just a little salt and white pepper as well. It exceeded expectations! Very good and healthy!

Loved this healthy side.  Next time I may add more garlic.  Loved the creamy texture.  Don't drain the beans even though it is tempting.

Excellent classic recipe.  Great as written as a side dish.  For a change I sometimes cook the escarole in chicken broth and make it a soup, thickening it up a bit with cornstarch.  Served this was with bread it can be a meal in itself.  I also adjust the garlic accordning to taste.  Thanks for delicious simplicity!

great wintery comfort food! I ate almost the whole thing for lunch. I think I will try some onion in it next time for another layer of flavor.

Super easy and super fast, it doesn't get any better than this.  Greens and beans is a huge hit with my Italian husband, and this recipe meets his high standards.  Thanks!

Very good and quick.  To make even quicker and turn it into an awesome 'scarole and bean soup...dont bother with the second pan.  Pour olive oil in large pot, brown the garlic a little and toss the chopped escarole in.  Wilt that down with the salt, pepper and red pepper flakes and then toss in the cans of beans right on top.  Add 16oz vegetable broth and a healthy handful of Locitelli cheese and let it all cook down and simmer for 30 minutes.  Best stuff on a rainy cold day and it freezes very well.

My dad use to make this recipe all the time with pork chops (yummm!)  I was so excited to find this.  I made it last night and out of habit i drained and rinsed the beans!  I didn't get the creamy texture, but it was still delicious!  I sprinkled a little grated parmesean on top (a little extra red pepper flakes, i love spicy) and it was perfect!  Thanks for the recipe!

Very good.  Just do as others recommend and cut the escarole in small pieces so it doesn't get stringy.  I eat this as a main dish, but it would be an awesome side dish as well.

WOW!  Unbelievble good and easy.  I added a small can of tomato sauce -- and of course extra garlic -- and let simmer while I went for my walk.  Incredible flavor.  Comfort food at its best.  Even better, my husband loved it too!  Thanks for the recipe!

Excellent and easy.  I did add a couple more cloves of garlic (I'm Italian, needs lots of garlic :))  I also made everything in a large wok.  Sauteed the garlic in olive oil, broke the escarole up into pieces and mixed it in, once it softened down (about 8-10 minutes) I seasoned with the salt, pepper and red pepper flakes and mixed in the beans and let cook another 10 minutes or so as directed.  

Next time I may use 1.5 cans of beand depending on the size of the escarole..felt the two cans was a bit much for the 2 heads, but still delicious!

This was soooo good!  I was in a hurry & didn't quite go through all the steps listed here-I cooked the garlic (I too added more than specified, but I usually do) & red pepper flakes (doubled as well) with the escarole, then added the semi-rinsed beans to the pan, covered it & simmered for the 10 minutes.  I partially rinsed the beans & used water to broth it up, to decrease the starchiness a bit, though I may try it with the full liquid from the bean can next time.  It will be a part of my recipe box for a long time to come!

I always add chicken broth to mine because I like it a bit more soupy.  Also, you can use other types of beans besides cannelli.  Garbanzo beans are good with this recipe.  Once served, top it with shaved Parmesan or Romano cheese for a nice added touch!

Excellent simple recipe.  I added a bit more garlic (3 cloves total).  I also made it a bit more soup like - I added chicken stock (which means you obviously need to transfer to the beans/escarole to a pot).  You can throw some white wine in there too.  Serve with a nice crusty bread and great bottle of red wine and you are good to go.  This recipe is delicious as is too, so you can keep it as is!!

This is an excellent recipe! So easy!!! I made it twice the way it is, and once I substituted swiss chard for escarole - still great! Of course, always cut leaves in the large pieces and cook 1 head of escarole first, transfer to a plate and cook second one. While beans cook, you'll have just enough time to prepare greens, and they won't overflow or stick to the bottom.

This was delicious. Added a few changes.
 I used two large heads of escarole and 4 cans of beans. I used extra garlic - probably chopped 2 heads of garlic. I left out the parsley and added rosemary and sweet onion, chopped.  I also added a few gratings of romano cheese and 2 bullion cubes.  Cooked ground sweet sausage and added it in. I will definitely make this again.

Tried to recreate an escarole and white bean pasta dish I had an italian restaurant.  I love red sauce on my pasta but the combo of beans and escarole is so out of this world, that I didn't mind the absence of tomatoes.  I gave this recipe 4 stars instead of 5 because I made a few adjustments.  I made the dish with pasta.  Boil and generously salt the pasta a few mins short of al dente.  Set aside cup of pasta liquid, and drain and rinse pasta. I used only about 1 1/2 heads of escarole.  Definitely trim the white ends of the escarole off.  I upped the garlic to about 5, and then one more freshly grated garlic to mix into the dish at the end of cooking.  I simmered the garlic until golden, added escarole, salted it. Then I  took about a cup of pasta water, a cup of dry white wine, and about quarter cup of reserved bean liquid, cooked it down (leaving a little bit of liquid to mix and fully cook the pasta in the last step).  (I wanted to also use chicken stock but was out.  Next time I will try it with about a half cup of chicken stock).  I threw in only one can of beans for a few mins, then throw in pasta (I used almost a whole 16 oz pkg of penne rigate).  Top with some pecorino cheese.

Extremely easy to make. Bought a bag of chopped escarole @ the store. Hardest part was mincing the garlic. One clove of garlic though? I put in an entire head! Helps to keep away vampires, gnats, and mosquitoes.
My Italian wife was delirious with the results.

Very good.  I followed the recipe but think it could use more garlic flavor.  Next time I will saute some garlic cloves in the oil before adding the escarole.  My mom made this all the time but always used the dried beans and boiled the escarole.  I will try it with the dried beans next time also, you get more sauce that way.  But I do prefer frying the escarole.  Thanks for a great recipe Krista.

I was skeptical about adding the liquid from the bean can, but decided to follow the recipe as written.  It was delicious, very easy and well recieved by my DH.  Next time I'll try adding the Trader Joe's Turkey meatballs for a full meal.

I'm not sure - wait for dinner tonight!
BUT, don't cook escarole in oil in a large frying pan - it needs a DEEP pan.
I cut up the escarole in large pieces, discarding the bitter white base, but it overflowed the frying pan.  While I was trying to stir it down, pieces flying all over the stove, the bottom started scorching.  After digging out the really burnt pieces, I added a little water, simmered it until tender (all on VERY LOW heat.)
Next came the beans.   Being starchy, they also started to stick to the bottom of the new, clean pan - but I kept stirring. I didn't know if they should turn to mush or keep their bean shape.
Anyway, I eventually combined the escarole and the beans, according to the recipe.  It doesn't exactly look like the picture.
Now I have to see if his honour eats it tonight with relish (his, not the kind in a jar.)  I know I will.

I will definitely make this again, using poconosrealtor's suggestions for more garlic.  I live in Tokyo so I substutited komatsuna https://shizuokagourmet.com/2010/04/01/vegetables-facts-tips-20-japanese-mustard-spinachkomatsuna/, which is about as close to escarole as I can get without taking out a bank loan.  I skipped the two pot step, cooking the garlic (and added the diced white part of a long onion) then cutting the komatsuna into 4ths from the stem to the top, added it, cooked for 10 minutes, added the beans and cooked it uncovrered until I got the consistency where I wanted it.  

It's great as a meal with garlic toasts, or as a side, as I'll eat it tonight, with pan fried salmon.  Yum!

This is great. I'd never used escarole before and I really liked it. I used dry cannellini beats. I put them in Instapot on high for 35 minutes. I followed the rest of the recipe and everyone loved it and asked me to make it again.  I did add a large teaspoon of Better Then bullion chicken flavor to the bean broth after I added it to the pot with the escarole and a small pinch of red pepper flakes. Very nice.

I made this tonight, and it was easy and very good. Used roasted garlic and topped it with grated parmesan. Just make sure to use a large pan. I made only half the amount, and the one head of escarole filled a 10" pan until it cooked down. I'll definitely make it again.

This is a classic Italian recipe. It is used by Italians across the United States and is very authentic.. This dish is offered in restaurants in the non-touristy areas  of Italy also. Perfetto.

Old time Italian classic. Creamy and flavorful!  Very easy to make, and I added a little more fresh garlic.

Really good and easy to make! I added a can of tomato sauce per a suggestion in one of the reviews and it's an ice touch. Definitely recommend

I've made this numerous times and have enjoyed it. I add a couple of diced up sausages for more flavor. As another reviewer said, a little chicken stock might be in order.

I made this recipe and I really loved it! I did add extra garlic and also garlic powder as suggested by another commenter.. 
 I used one head of escarole, two cloves of garlic, and one can of beans which I  sprinkled  with  garlic powder. I did use the salt, pepper, and red pepper flakes outlined in the recipe. It was out of this world!

This was really good.  I had no idea what to expect.  Because I was afraid it might be a little bitter, I added a tiny amount of chopped dates--which made it quite interesting.  We'll have this again, maybe without the dates.  Depends on what we are having as a main dish.  :-)  Thank you for posting the recipe.

Excellent dish  - I had to use navy beans because that's what I had in the pantry, but I don't think it made any difference.  I made 1/2 the recipe and it was just right for 2.  I used a whole garlic clove also, as we love garlic. Delicious, and very filling without being heavy.   We ate it as a meal, but it would be a very good side also.

This is a great recipe and now my go-to for escarole. I do chop out the ribs of the leaves to make it a little more tender, and easier for the kids to eat. Sometimes I also add ground sausage as well to make dinner a 1 pan dish. Delish!

I added spicy Italian sausage sauted ,added one small onion and 3 cloves garlic, chopped fine, and crushed red peppers, sauteed until sausage ,garlic and onion was crispy. I drained the beans to cut down on the sodium (actually used butter beans because I like them and had them on hand) deglazed the pan with a little white wine, added 2TBS. Of cream cheese to make it creamier. Added a squeeze of lemon juice to brighten the flavor. Topped with some grated parmesan! I made a soup with the left overs by adding chicken stock. Yummy!

I cook everything in one frying pan..use only one head of escarole and one can of beans. I drain off half the liquid from the can and its delicious. I make this when I am not in the mood for escarole and bean soup. Much faster.

Made this for dinner last night. It was 2 of us so, I cut it in half .(except red pepper and parsley). It was delicious and reminiscent of a meal my grandmother made when I was a child. She used bacon fat but we are trying to eat healthy so just some olive oil. I think I could eat this 5 nights a week but my husband wouldn't be happy about that. Try it the way the recipe says and you wont be disappointed.  I did tear the escarole in smaller pieces just to make it easier to eat.

Very tasty, but a lot of work! Took 20 minutes just to rinse all the grit out 2 heads. Tore into pieces rather than cut it up, discarding the white stems. As per others, used one can of beans and lots more garlic and garlic powder. Also added 1/2 cup chicken stock and a teaspoon of apple cider vinegar, as it need a bit of acid. Makes enough for about 4 side servings.

I've been making this for years (learned it from my grandmother). Here are a few variations you may want to try to kick it up and make it a meal and less of a "side dish."

1. CHEESE! This recipe is missing the delicious grated parmesan/romano or fontenella cheese on top.
2. Add Italian sausage (cook the sausage first, then add to the final dish)
3. Add seasoned chicken (season with your favorite spices and cube. Saute first, then add to the final dish)
4. Add diced onion for a little extra flavor and for a little crunch if you don't over-cook the onion.
5. Add it all! We use this as our base, and make a big pot with added meat and lots of cheese for a big, easy family meal without a lot of cooking.

Thanks for sharing!

Delicious! I was looking for a recipe like my Mom & Grandmom used to make when I was young, and this comes very close. Like other reviewers here, I coarsely chopped the escarole after washing thoroughly. I added a chopped/sliced onion to the escarole & increased the garlic to taste. Salt, pepper & plenty of crushed red pepper. I used one can beans which was plenty, and added it directly to the cooked escarole avoiding the 2 pan method. Comes out deliciously creamy. Top with grated parmesan/romano cheese before serving.

YUM! I was hesitant since I think escarole can be quite bitter, but this was delicious. I used 3 large cloves of garlic but everything else was the same.  I added some cooked chicken sausage in towards the end since I had it leftover in the fridge and thought it would go well to round out the meal. It did. I will make this again.

This was my first attempt at making escarole and I'm not in love with it, but I probably will try it again.  It's something different.  I agree with suggestions about using more garlic.  I put quite a bit in mine and wouldn't mind even more.  I would say that the combination of beans with the escarole is a nice combination.
