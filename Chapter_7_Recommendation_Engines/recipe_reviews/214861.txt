This is not too sweet and use very few eggs to make 2 dozens.  Very easy and popular among Asians. Thank you for posting!

just tried this recipe and indeed it is just perfectly sweet. but I used tenderflake frozen crust, and the top of the crust was all burned after 15minutes. i'll try to adjust the time or temperature next time.

the filling is a solid recipe; it sat up nicely and was perfectly soft, sweetness level was perfect but I did add a pinch of salt, may try adjustments for real vanilla bean or coconut milk on my next try.  I did mine with a pie crust which needs to be par baked before pouring in the filling.  This recipe yielded 30 3.5inch tarts.

It is an excellent recipe! but the baking time maybe too long for me. For me,18 mins is enough.

I couldn't sieve the egg mixture since I didn't have one, but it didn't matter in the result. I may reduce the sugar in the future, though, because it did seem a little too sweet.

Delicious!  I  made almost exactly to the recipe but added 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla and a pinch of nutmeg on top of each. Perfect amount for 2 dozen tarts. I couldnâ€™t sieve but they were perfect anyways.

I thought it was terrible I kept following the instructions and everytime it just came out of the oven like a goey mess (I had to make it about 5 or 6 times just to get it right and it never rose the 6 time) I set the serving to twelve but it still made make 24 and for some reason they kept popping and splatting the mixture everywhere I hated it. I do not recommend this dish you should try it from another recipie or not make it at all.


(By the way the 5 stars were not a mistake and I have no disrespect to people who like it)
