Okay, I don't usually make things that I actually like. I always feel like something is missing or I didn't make it as good as my mom would have. But this was actually delicious. It blew me away and even my almost-chef boyfriend thought they were good. I'm so happy about this recipe because it was actually good and cheap and he came home to a great meal.

This was okay but wasn't very flavorful in my opinion. I added half of an onion (chopped and cooked with the chicken) as well as chili powder and that made a big difference the second time I made these. It was much better, in my opinion,

My whole family loved this recipe. I did make a few adjustments. I cooked strips of 3 fresh chicken breasts in a skillet, generously seasoned with cumin, chili powder, salt and lime juice. Adjust those to your preference. Pretty well followed the rest of the recipe as it is. The juice from the chicken made the recipe extra saucy. I had a whole 9x14 pan full of enchiladas and only 2 were left. Sooo good as leftovers too!

The family loves this. I cooked 3 chicken breasts in the soup in the crockpot for tenderness and added my own seasonings. I used cheddar and mozzarella cheese. Salsa only on some. Still really good.

This was pretty good. It was a little bland  and I also sauted the onions with the chicken. I also cooked it for 30 minutes. next time I will add some salt and pepper for a little more flavoring. Overall this was good. The kids loved it

It was a big hit but had to have modifications. First of all, shredded cheese was left off the ingredient list. If you take time to watch the video, which I did after I started, I realized that other vegetables were also left off.  That seemed a little annoying. I added a chopped onion and cooked it with the chicken and seasoned it with chili powder, cumin and salt. With that and going on with the rest of he recipe, it was very good. Without the changes, it would be quite bland.

This was pretty easy to make and tasted fine. I used left over roasted chicken and finely chopped half a red pepper, six mushrooms,  three green onions, and one cup of cheddar cheese (as was shown in the video). My son said it tasted like a  Mexican chicken pot pie.

It was not the worst thing I've had but wasn't really good either. Def not a 5 star. Very bland. Cheese is missing off ingredient list so I guessed it. Needs to cook longer than 15 minutes too. I did 25 but prob should've gone to 30.  I won't make it again.

This was easy and delicious. I sauteed some sweet onions to the chicken mixture and substitute salsa verde for the regular salsa and  added two dashes of cayenne pepper for some kick. My family loved it. Cheese is mentioned in the directions but not in the list of ingredients so I used about one cup of Mexican mix cheese for the inside and to top with. The recipe's timing in the oven was perfect. Will definitely make again.

I made this for a group of 40 people. It went over so well, they want it again. I loved the taste. I served it with Spanish rice and refried beans. Excellent.

It was delicious in my opinion, we added some enchilada sauce for extra flavor and it was very tasty.
