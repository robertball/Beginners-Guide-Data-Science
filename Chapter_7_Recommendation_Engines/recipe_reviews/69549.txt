OKAY.. Let's start with the people that said this was bland!  If you are looking up recipes on this site, you must have SOME cooking abilities. Follow this....
I, like others suggested...added a little bbq sce..already open in the fridge.. like 1 Tbs.  I threw in fresh garlic w/ the celery and onion. (buy one of those big jugs of garlic at the store) That brings me to the people that left out the celery and onion for the kids.  Everyone has a little handy chopper in thier pantry, right?  Add the onion, celery and whole garlic to the chopper and grind up really small. Then throw it in the dishwasher... Brown that with the meat, set aside after draining.  (I also used 1/2 turkey) Then put the tomato soup (with no "E" on the end spelling it,, sorry it makes me crazy :) with the splash of W.sce, vinegar, ketchup & bbq in the pan and sautee.  I did not add any b.sugar since I read the reviews first.  I did however add ONE drop of liquid smoke.  Cook a few minutes then add the meat/onion/celery/garlic mixture back to the sauce.  Cover and simmer 15 mins or so... I guarantee it wont be bland! The whole thing took 25 minutes, maybe.  Thanks for the post! Great way to use canned tomato soup in my pantry ($.25) It was delicious, and the kids loved it WITH the onion and celery, no body even noticed!

We recently decided to get rid of everything in our pantry that's processed or has chemicals, and that included our old standby, sloppy joe mix. It's one of my 4-year old's faves, so I tried this recipe and it was really good! I modified it a bit by skipping the onion & celery (the kid won't eat chunky stuff) and substituted onion powder. I also used tomato puree b/c that's what I had on hand and it was just fine. Along with being incredibly easy, it's a great base recipe and easy to modify depending on your tastes. As my kid said, "Yum-o!"

No doubt, hands down, THE BEST sloppy joes on the planet.  I didn't deviate from the recipe at all.  Can't wait to make them again!

My picky bunch rarely can agree on a meal, but this was one that pleased my junk food junkie 17 year old, and my not so picky hubby. My 9 year old was not so thrilled with it.

I changed things up just a bit.  I omitted the celery, used canned tomato sauce instead of soup and substituted real garlic for garlic powder.  I used onion powder and instead of  salt I used a few shakes of Lawry's seasoned salt to get the celery taste without the chunks. I also cut down on the brown sugar since the first few times it came out a little too sweet.  I left out the vinegar and put in a healthy  few dashes of  A-1 steak sauce. I reduced the ketchup to a few tablespoons and put in a few shakes of hot sauce.

 Other than that, I toasted the  buns and put out shredded cheddar for those who wanted it. I put a few extra dashes of hot pepper sauce in my older son's sandwich since he likes hot and spicy.

It's a keeper recipe for me when I need a one dish meal.

I made this once as written.  The celery was a little overpowering.  I made it again, but used 1/2 c chopped onion, 1/2 c FINELY chopped green pepper, & 1/2 c FINELY chopped celery.  I saved a step by cooking these with my ground beef.  My kids enjoy these and don't realize they're getting their veggies!  Also, these are even better heated up the next day after the flavors have blended.

My husband loved this recipe. We used ground turkey instead of beef. It was a delicious, healthier alternative.

Easy to prepare and delicious. It was just a bit on the sweet side. Next time I make it I might omit the brown sugar alltogether, as the ketchup and soup have sugar pre-added.

Terrific sloppy joes - I didn't have any tomato soup so I used a can of tomatoes and a can of tomato paste.  Really good!  My kids LOVED it.

Very tasty and easy to make.  My family is always happy to see this dish on the menu.  I make it again and again.  Much better than the canned junk.  We find the recipe to be sweet but not tooo sweet.

This is a perfect recipe for those on a budget looking for a quality taste. Throw out that canned  cuz this recipe does all that and more! Followed the ingredients to a "T" and it turned out awesome.

If you don't like celery...just sub in a little celery salt ( 1/2 tsp)...though I will say the final product will lack a little crunch (texture)....best to keep it real in my opinion.

Thanks for sharing Aunt Mamie...you ROCK Sista'

I’ve made this recipe for years.  Here are some tried and tested suggestions.  First, make sure your beef is extra lean.  After browning the beef, remove the beef from the pot and drain the excess grease.  Second, Campbell’s Tomato Soup is much better in this recipe than using tomato sauce.  However, check the sodium on the can (480 mg) - you won’t need to add any salt to this recipe.  Thirdly, if you use Heinz ketchup, you don’t need to add vinegar.   Heinz has more vinegar than Hunts Ketchup.  Lastly, I happen to like chopped celery in this recipe.  It adds an extra layer of flavor.  You can always whirl it in a processor if you don’t want chopped pieces.  And, if you don’t like sweet flavors, just cut back on the sugar.  My family and friends love this recipe.  It's a keeper!

This is very similar to a recipe that I have been making for years.  One trick my family has always used to make them not so sloppy is to put the mixture in hot dog rolls instead of hamburg buns.  It's such a simple solution, I can't believe I never see anybody else using the idea.

This is pretty much my go-to recipe for sloppy joes.  I don't use the celery because no one in my family cares for it.  Other than that, I follow the recipe, and it is a winner everytime.  This recipe works great in a slow cooker as well.  Just brown up your meat in a skillet and then add everything to the slow cooker.  4-5 hours on low, and it is perfect and ready to eat when you are.

Delicious! Even my picky picky hubby who likes to hover in the kitchen as I make dinner liked it! My only tweak was that I added some red pepper flakes at the end to add some heat. And since it's just the two of us we will have lots of yummy leftovers!!! Thanks for sharing this great recipe!

As is, these sloppy joes were WAYYY too sweet for my family's taste, and that was cutting back some on the brown sugar. I also used a can of tomato sauce instead of tomato soup, again to cut back on sugar. I ended up adding much more vinegar, some smoked paprika and mustard in an attempt to cut the sweetness. Turned out ok, but they weren't this recipe in the end. Sorry, but I won't be making this one again.

Very good!  Didn't have white vinegar so I sub'd balsamic.  I also don't like celery so I left that out.  I also used fresh garlic instead of powder...

Was a good base for me, and my husband LOVED it. My adjustments were as follows: balsamic vinegar, NO sugar, fresh garlic, touch of liquid smoke, 1 tsp paprika, fresh ground pepper, was very light on the celery, and all veggies FINELY chopped. Next time I'll add chopped bell pepper. Served on this site's BELLES HB BUNS, with lettuce & green onions, for color. Thanks!

I think this recipe is perfect the way it is. I never liked sloppy joes before (even as a kid) but Hubby really wanted some so I tried this recipe. We all love it and I prepare it with exact ingredients. The only thing different is that I saute the onions and celery FIRST before I add the meat to brown it.

Wow - amazing recipe.  My entire family agreed! I don't normally rate recipes but I just had to for this particular one.  I tried a few variations as well.  I used one lbs ground chicken and one ground beef.  I added a tab bit of bbq sauce.  I used whole wheat buns.  It was better than any other sloppy joes I've ever tasted.  I'll never make the packaged ones again.

This recipe was a good jumping off point for me.  I didn't have any celery so I didn't add that.  Substituted BBQ sauce for ketchup and used cider vinegar instead of white as another reviewer suggested.  These were awesome!

Im not a fan of sloppy joes but thought this was a easy dinner for a cold winter night.  It turned out excellent!  I made it a bit earlier and put it in the crockpot with it set to "warm".  Perfect and super easy!

good.  Grandkids ate it right up.  Did not put celery in it since they hate it.  It was a little sweet (probably why they liked it so much) and it needed some black pepper.  I will make it again with a little less brown sugar.  Thanks for the recipe.  I wont buy the packaged seasoning again thanks to you.

Family of 3 here and the votes are in : Wife says very good, The boy says all sloppy joes are the same, and my vote is it isn't worth the trouble for the taste or cost for that matter. By the time you buy all the veggies that it should have the can is much cheaper. For those of you who say but at least i know what is in it, using canned soup  and bottled ketchup doesn't exactly qualify For wholesome ingredients.  Yes this was ok but not great (not 5 star). By the time you add everything needed to make it at least as good as the popular can joe sauce you might as well buy the can. If your kids complain about veggies in stuff, cook them down till translucent and mash or food processor them.

Fabulous!!  I try not to use alot of premade processed things, for my kids sake!  So I loved to make this from scratch!  I used 4 cloves fresh garlic, onion, celery, and added some diced tomato that I had on hand.  I didn't have tomato soup so I just subbed 1 cup tomato sauce and 1/4 cup water, the rest of the recipe I kept the same!  Its great every time I make it, and is now a staple in our household!  I have made this ahead of time and frozen batches of it, which defrosts and reheats so quickly!  And I have a 3 & 5 year old and have not trouble getting them to eat it!!  Thanks!!

This recipe wasn't that great.  It's hard to mess up sloppy joes so it was fine but nothing impressive at all.  It was too sweet for both me and my husband.  I will not be making this again.

This was super easy and tasted great. The celery was the biggest surprise for me :) It was so good and gave the beef a wonderful smell and flavor. I followed the recipe to the letter until I got to the brown sugar. I read the other reviews and thought I'd play it by taste to see what it might need instead of just giving it the full 1/4 c. I'm so glad I waited it didn't need it at all. My hubby commented that it was sweet but over all he really liked it and it was a definate hit with the kids. I'm really excited this was the 1st time I didn't use a canned sloppy joe mix, and I don't think I will ever again. Thanks!

I was only preparing this meal for two people so I had to scale this back a bit. I used 1 pound of lean ground beef, 1/2 cup chopped red onion, enough chopped celery for a 1/4 cup, and 2 garlic cloves, chopped. I actually tried to dice up the celery really well so it wouldn't be as evident to others when eating. Once the ground beef was browned and broken down I added 1 can of Campbell's Tomato soup, then mixed in 2T heinz ketchup, 2 tsp white vinegar, 1T brown sugar, 1 1/2 tsp whorcestershire sauce, about a 1/4 tsp salt, to taste, fresh ground black pepper, a dash of hickory liquid smoke,  and 1T of bottle BBQ sauce. I let it simmer for 15 minutes before serving on toasted hamburger buns. This was very good! The flavors all worked well with each other making for a tasty meal and nothing was overpowering each other. I could taste a hint of sweetness but also the subtle "tang" from the vinegar. I really like the little crunch from the celery but am glad that I did not add the full 1 cup chopped celery called for in this recipe. This recipe did not call for green bell peppers for a change, which was nice, and did use 1 can of tomato soup instead of tomato sauce. This 1 pound meat portion also made enough for 6 hamburgers so I actually had leftovers.

Tasty recipe.  I will probably cut down on the brown sugar next time.  My husband also commented that it was good but would like more of a hint of barbecue sauce taste in it.

I haven't made sloppy joes in years, and this one tastes great!!   I did not use the celery and instead of regular tomatoe soup, I used a can of Campbells Tomato bisque (without the water). My whole family liked these. I will def add to my rotation!

I have a way to get the celery AND the green pepper AND and onion into the kids and they will never know it.  You get all the flavor and nutrition but no chunks.  Just put the soup into the blender, add all your good veggies, and blend.  Now add to everything else.  Kids love it.

I make this exactly as written, except I use real garlic instead of the powder.  I FINELY chop the celery and the onion, and the kids don't even notice that it's there.  This is the only way I'll make sloppy joes now, and I love knowing my family is getting the extra nutrition with the added veggies.  Sometimes I throw in some finely chopped green pepper as well.  Thanks for the great recipe!

I top the whole thing with cheese and let it melt under the broiler. Less messy and the kids love it! Added some Liquid Smoke, Steak Pepper and used Seasoned Salt. Will make this one more often!

Even though I'm not really a fan of sloppy joes, these are pretty good.  I've made these many times, but yesterday I used 1 cup of chopped yellow onion instead of the two different kinds of onions, and I used an 8oz. can of tomato sauce instead of the soup.  I couldn't tell the difference - they were still great.  I cook them way down so there's no crunch to the veggies.  I usually make a double batch and freeze half for an easy dinner on the run.

These were great, fast and super easy.  My kids and husband loved them.  I made a couple of changes.  I minced all the veges so my middle daughter couldn't see them.  I used 1/2cup each of onion, celery and green pepper.  Instead of using the brown sugar, I used one finely grated carrot for sweetness.  No one notice and I had two cups of vegetables hidden inside!

This was a big hit at our house.  Everyone devowered it and we're bummin' we don't have left overs for tomorrow.  The recipe was so easy my girls (12 & 9) made it on their own and they are pleased with the results.  We didn't use the celery (used celery salt).  Will use it again and again!

My picky 8 year old said these were "great".  I followed ingredients exactly but threw everything in a crockpot (the beef was a solid frozen chunk), covered and cooked on high for about 6 hours.  I took the lid off for about 1 hour to let it thicken a bit.  So easy-will make again and again.  Served with homemade coleslaw. EDIT: Made this again for dinner (prompted by photo on website).  Used lean ground turkey.  It was a bit on the soupy side so I added a handful of oats to thicken and add a little fiber.  Still tastes great & so easy for a busy mom!

Used 1/2 ground turkey and FINELY minced the celery.  Followed recipe exactly.  Didn't knock my socks off but the taste was better than "Sloppy Joes II".  I really liked using the tomato soup.  Will cut sugar in 1/2 if not more, otherwise a keeper recipe.  EASY

These were good and my kids really liked them.  However, I too found them way too sweet.  Next time I will only add maybe 1 - 2 T of brown sugar.  I also like to add mustard to my sloppy joes while they are simmering.

I've made this over and over again exactly as written. My husband and young children love it. I chop celery and keep it in the freezer ready for adding to recipes like this. I always have the ingredients on hand. I like to make a double batch and spoon leftovers into muffin cups and freeze. They pop right out and store in a ziplock bag in perfect portion  sizes for a sandwich. I avoid processed foods but still strive to have " quick" microwave options ready for when we are in a hurry to eat. I do the same muffin cup approach with taco meat and shredded BBQ chicken too! This recipe is a keeper!

A good recipe for a cold Midwest winter night.  To increase the flavor, I added a teaspoon of ground mustard, a teaspoon of cayenne pepper and a teaspoon of chili powder.  I substituted two teaspoons of molasses for the 1/4 cup of brown sugar.  I didn't have much ketchup on hand, so I used a 14 oz can of tomato sauce and a small 4 oz can of tomato paste.  I also added one diced red bell pepper.  For health benefits, I substituted ground turkey for ground beef and fresh minced garlic for garlic powder.  I cooked everything in my 12 inch USA made Lodge cast iron skillet.  For a great and easy side dish, I used the Baked French Fries I from this website which I baked in my 10 inch Lodge cast iron skillet.

Made this tonight for dinner and it was delicious!  Did not have tomato soup so I used tomato sauce instead.  Used celery salt instead of the celery (not my favorite).  Did add some chopped jalapenos to give some heat.  Added a little mustard to the mix.

Served with Neely's cole slaw (Food Network) and tater tots, suggested from another viewer.  This was really good for sloppy joes.  Not that bbq sauce flavor like a lot of other recipes.  Add the mustard, you will love it!

This was very very good and definitely a keeper.   I cut back on the brown sugar and added some hot sauce at the end.  My husband HATES celery IF he knows it's in there, LOL.  So I sprinkled in a little celery salt instead of chopped celery.  For those who are leaving out onions for the kids or other picky eaters, try grating the onion instead of chopping it.  Or use onion powder instead.  Next time I'll start this a little earlier so it can simmer in the sauce longer.  Super duper good.  WAY better than anything in a can  :)

With the exception of adding a splash of liquid smoke, I followed the recipe exactly. It was great! My husband hates the canned stuff- he refuses to eat it- but he loved this!

This was not only very easy to make it was also delicious. My children don't care for sloppy joes but they really loved these and besides I had everything on hand.

Love this basic recipe.  I too prefer less sugar and use only 1/2 if that.  I never use the tomato soup and simply use 1 can of diced (no salt) tomatoes and blend it up.  I was without ketchup tonight and used bar-b-q sauce instead.  YUMMY!

This was pretty good. I cut the sugar by more than half and it was still too sweet for me.  I'll try it again with some other seasonings and probably no sugar.

I didn't really want to take the first bite when I sat down to this, (neither did my son) but we were both pleasantly surprised to find that this dish was delicious!! I added bell peppers, and substituted zucchini for the celery, and this will stay in my recipe book:)

Great recipe!  The only change I would make next time is to add only 1T of brown sugar.  1/4 c of brown sugar seemed to make this too sweet.   A few dashes of hot pepper sauce would give it a little bit more flavor, too!

Everyone in our house loved it... even the kids (ages 6 & 10) and THAT's saying a lot! Thank you for the easy alternative to the "canned" stuff I grew up with (and really disliked).

These were good.  They actually deserve 4.5 stars (if I could) because everyone except my 11 year old really liked them.  He said they weren't "right" - maybe comparing them to the only other thing he knows as a Sloppy Joe - the gross meat by-product concoction from school.  Made it just as written except for using white sugar in place of brown (had just used the brown sugar up making cookies).  Would definitely make again!!

This recipe was my first attempt at Sloppy Joe's. My husband and I loved them and I'll definitely be making them again.  I did make a couple of changes, but they were out of necessity. I did not have white vinegar so I used cider vinegar. Since that's a little sweet I only used 2tbsp of brown sugar. I did not have celery, so I used 3/4cup onion and a yellow bell pepper. (During a New England winter you need all the Vitamin C you can get.) Lastly, I used whole wheat buns and topped with a slice of sharp cheddar.

We have made this for years!  It's the family hand-me-down recipe.  We keep ours on the sweet side with added brown sugar and we keep the bell pepper in.  I have never seen this exact recipe before, it always seems to be a little different, we love it!  You just have to judge it for yourself....

As is, no. No one liked the celery in this...even those that do like celery. I may try it again, completely leaving out the celery and tweaking other things as some have suggested.

We love this recipe!  My daughter is a vegetarian and I like finding recipes that everyone in the family enjoys.  I substitute  unflavored TVP - rehydrate according to package directions - and then follow the recipe.  My son, who is the carnivore in the family, prefers this veggie version over the meat version.  We call them Sloppy Janes.

I've made these several times, and the recipe is great as written.  It is also very adaptable.  If you like your sloppy joes a little sloppier, definitely just use 1 1/2 pounds ground beef.  I generally use green pepper instead of celery, and it's great either way.  My very picky husband and son both eat these with no complaints.

Great recipe. I use less sugar though and I also sneak in some carrot and sweet potato puree. I cook and puree about 1/4 cup of each and mix it into the meat mixture. My son and husband can't even tell the difference. They don't know it's even in there. If you want to sneak some veggies in a picky eater try it for sure! You will be surprised.

First of all I'll start by saying this was the first time my kids have EVER had sloppy joe's, and my wife has NEVER liked them.... I was in shock when everyone loved them, and ate the whole sandwich!!! What a great recipe. Here are a few changes I made based on comments I read: Double the garlic powder, reduce the salt, add some pepper, leave out the brown sugar add 2 tbsp of bbq sauce, a little extra ketchup, 1-2 drops of liquid smoke, and I added about a 1/4 cup of water to help it simmer as well as dilute the tomato soup. This was kind of fun to make, simple, and there were left overs for another meal!!!! Oh yeah, before I forget... I read that some people left out the onion and celery; Don't do it! Chop it up fine enough, and the kids won't even know what it is. Mine didn't!

Definitely a 5-star recipe - a hit with both kids and adults! I did make a few minor changes, however. I cut back on the brown sugar and omitted the celery. Everyone raved about how this was SO much better than Mannwich!

Not bad...  I added mustard for more flavor which helped.  My husband liked it better than me.  I don't know why but it just didn't do it for me.  If you like your sloppy joes on the very sweet side, then this is for you...  But for me, well I think I'll just stick with Manwich...

When I made this I omitted the celery and chopped onion and opted for onion powder instead, and I went slightly heavier with the garlic powder, and then I added a little Sriracha because my husband loves spicy food. He loved it. He even made the "MMM" grunty noise he makes when he's truly found food bliss. Great recipe, I will definitely make this again.

Made it just as it says....when done I tasted it and it was yummy...seasoned to our taste with a little bit more garlic powder and salt....which was perfect!  Chopped up onions and celery really fine with my chopper for the kiddos.  Husband and kids loved it and want it on our fav list!  Feels good to find something everyone loves.  Thanks!

Very tasty and super easy!!  Time wise I would say this recipe takes closer to 30 min. total, I was able to keep it warm without it drying out in the crockpot on low for almost 1/2 hour.  This will be an easy go to in my recipe box.

I made this with venison instead of hamburger and my guys really enjoyed it.  The first night they ate it on buns and the second night my husband finished it on top of a baked potato.

Love this recipe, i did not have celery so i added green pepper. 
Try it without the sugar first then add in half if you want it sweet, the first time i made it i could not handle the sweetness, the second time i made it i left the sugar out totally and it was perfect. Thanks for posting.

Delicious! Didn't have some of the ingredients, so used half an onion and some Mrs Dash's tomato, garlic and basil seasoning. Came out great, partner said it was the best!!

Great Soppy Joe and easy to make. Didn't use the brown sugar and did add minced garlic. Replaced ketchup with barbecue sauce. Everyone loved them. Can't wait to make them for the grand kids.

I have only modified it slightly, i changed the soup for tomato paste
cut out the extra salt and used thick lea and perrins. We love the brown sugar. This is the original style sloppy joes, from way back in the day. piece of cake to make. I put my onions ad celery in the food processesor because no likes the chunks but my hubby and me.  i just throw all the add in into the crock pot then cook the meat and throw it in and mix it up and let it sit to marinate and when they all show /brings my grown boys back home, we are ready to eat.

I omitted the celery and added a bit more onion.  Added a can of chicken and rice soup and a bit more ketchup.  DELISH!  This definitely makes more than 8 "joes"  I always make sure to buy 2 packages of buns.

This is excellent! The only variation I made was to substitute apple cider vinegar for white because that was what I had. I made one batch and served it for dinner to my family before making it for a party and my three year old who will not usually eat hamburger loved it. Also a huge thanks for the potato mashed tip... I will definitely make lots of use of that as it made quick work of breaking up the meat.

This was just ok (it was eaten by all but nobody LOVED it), I hate to admit it but I prefer the "Campbells Souper Sloppy Joes".  I think that recipe has a bit more flavor and it is much simpler to prepare (I love to cook, but sometimes simple is better).

This was very nummy and this is now a regular in my repertoire.  I halved the recipe (because there were only two of us and I had only 1 pound of ground beef).  I also had no tomato soup, so used 8 ounces of spaghetti sauce (simply because it was on hand).  The rest of the recipe was followed to a "T" (except that I left out the salt).  Wonderful, quick, and easy!  Thank you!

Delicious! After my 8yr old whined that he didn't like sloppy joes, him and his 6yr old brother ate them right up! Only changes I made were onion powder instead of onion, no celery and maybe 1 tsp of mustard. Great recipe!

These were good. I still think a canned mix is just as good and easier though.

Quick and easy; you really don't even have to measure the ingredients.  Just dump it all in, whatever looks good--you can't mess it up!  I liked that it was sweet and mild.

My son who doesn't like sloppy joes normally, loved this.  My husband & I who like sloppy joes Loved this.  The flavor is a lot better than what you get from a can.  I made the recipe as listed except I added green pepper because I wanted more of a sloppy joe taste.  No more buying it from a can for me.

Yum! These were really good sloppy joes. I made them for one pound of meat so I changed the recipe to 4 and followed it exactly, except I used a whole can of soup instead of the half can that it called for. I pretty much eye balled the other ingredients and it came out great! I don't think you can mess this one up. The celery is a strong flavor though, so keep that in mind when adding more than the recipe calls for.

Made these tonight and DH and I really liked them.  I made the recipe as written but next time I think I will add some chopped bell pepper as well.  This is a quick weeknight meal for me to prepare after work.  I will definitely make this recipe again.

A fantastic meal. The children loved it, probably because it was made with sugar. I didn't have tomato soup so I used tomato paste. I also used fresh garlic and BBQ sauce as recommended. I cut down on the ketchup since there is enough sweetness with the brown sugar. I used finely chopped peppers and onions (with the kitchen chopper) and the kids didn't see them. Great meal.

Added red bell peppers which added natural sweetness so will probably alleviate the sugar next time.  Still sloppy but tasty.

This was incredibly good! Very easy to make and very tasty. I didn't use the celery as I can't stand celery ... noxious weed that it is; so I subbed green pepper in its place. The only other change I would make to it would be to add an extra tablespoon of vinegar to give it a little more edge. This is a definite keeper!!!

Hubby is truly not a sloppy joe guy...but, he loved this.  Will be making again and again.  He actually ate it for left overs today!! Believe me, left overs in our house is a big deal.  I did reduce the sugar and didn't add salt or garlic powder but added 2 tablespoons of Bullseye BBQ sauce & 4 cloves of fresh minced garlic as suggest in other reviews. Thanks so much for sharing. We really enjoyed it.

Made this pretty much as written, except cut amount of celery in half.  My son doesn't like celery OR onions and he gobbled this up.  Also substituted white wine vinegar for white vinegar.  Not sure if this affected the taste or not, but it was a hit!  Will definitely make this again.

Very good flavor.  I took the advice of others and cut back on the sugar. Since we eat as healthy as possible whenever possible I didn't change the actual recipe, just used healthier versions of the ingredients  - I used ground chicken breast not  beef, in place of canned soup I used V8 tomato soup, used reduced sugar Heinz, used 1/2 the amount of brown sugar and I don't like celery so I put yellow peppers in, also used real garlic! Very good!

Too much ketchup! use maybe 1 TBSP of ketchup next time.  I added fresh garlic.  This tasted like meat with ketchup in it.  Sorry!  I like more of the mixed tangy flavour that sloppy joes have and the ketchup seemed to take over all the flavour (even the fresh garlic (4x).

This was my first time making sloppy joes and I have to say that these were the best I have ever had! My husband was mad I didn't double the recipe. I am too because our family ate all of them. I used  1 & 1/2 lbs. ground meat. I also added green pepper to the onion and celery. I also added a little bbq sauce, a lil extra Worcestershire sauce. Delicious!

Very good!  I actually added the whole can of Tomato soup so mine was a bit more "sloppy".  Didn't miss the green pepper at all-and the celery gave it a good crunch.    Definately will make again!

This was excellent! I am very particular with ground beef and this was definitely a crowd pleaser. I followed the recipe as written but browned the meat, celery, onion and chopped garlic together instead of powder. Then removed the meat and made the sauce. I didn't have tomato soup so I used tomato sauce. I used all of the ingredients and added 2 drops of liquid smoke and a dash (1/4 c) of BBQ sauce as suggested in another review. I simmered 5 minutes then added meat mixture back and served. Excellent!

I've had a complex family recipe for decades but thought I'd give this a try.  It was such a hit that I made it again 3 days later.  On the sweet side, my hubby LOVED it.  We were iffy on the celery but it was perfect.  Thanks!

This recipe as is was much too sweet and I had to start over again. This was definitely a good base recipe though. I added some Tomato-Basil-Garlic Mrs. Dash and a good dose of ground black pepper when browning the meat, omitted the brown sugar and used 8oz tomato sauce instead of ketchup, we enjoyed it a lot.

This recipe should be called "Sweet Joes".  There is way too much sugar in this recipe for it to be anything but sweet. This is not anything like sloppy Joes.  I would have given it one star, but my 15 month old liked it.  I think this would be a great recipe for young kids only.

I would have personally given this recipe a 5, but collectively as a family I am giving it a 4.  It is very good.  I followed the recipe exactly as written and I thought it was better then any of that canned stuff.  Now the reason I gave it a 4 is because I do have an 8 year old daughter who loves Sloppy Joes, but she did not like these and would not eaat them.  I am pretty certain it was because of the texture of the onions/celery.  I did let it cook down until they were soft and no longer crunchy, but she could still tell.  I will make them again!

Just okay. The flavors were not intense enough for us. I did add some diced green peppers and minced garlic. It was a bit too tomatoey (smile if that is a word)

I hated Sloppy Joes  growing up. But in my search to find cheap, kid-friendly, not to unhealthy recipes, I decided to give it another shot. These are way better than I remember! (I don't miss the bell peppers, I guess.) I followed recipe exactly and don't think I'd change a thing. Served it w/ one of the sweet potato fries from the website.

Great recipe! I'm a vegetarian, so I used Boca Crumbles and they worked well.  I did add about 1 Tbls. of BBQ sauce, so I omitted the brown sugar.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe. My 18-month-old gobbled it up!

These are by far the best sloppy joes! My family loves them. I've made a lot of sloppy joe recipes looking for THE ONE and this recipe is it! So much flavor.

I gave this recipe 4 stars because I felt like it needed a little more brown sugar and about 3 tablespoons of white vinegar.  It's similar to a meatloaf recipe I love and it was definitely a favorite of my three children!  Much better than storebought sloppy joe mix!  It's a keeper!

No depth of flavor.   I could have jazzed it up per comments but I'm reviewing the recipe as originally written.

This is a great recipe! Made as-is, and had lots of leftovers, which were great for freezing. An instant family hit with our semi-picky 6-year-old daughter, and all of her friends loved it too. Now in regular rotation at our house, as it's the first recipe my daughter actually asks for. Yes!

This was delicious and both of my very picky kids enjoyed it.  Based on some prior reviews and because I don't love things overly sweet, I did eliminate the brown sugar and instead I replaced 1 Tbsp of ketchup with BBQ sauce.  The result was fantastic.  Highly recommend!

PERFECT! I use 1lb ground turkey & 1lb beef....just cause. Also, I always use Campbell's condensed Chicken Gumbo - it's what my mom always used. GREAT RECIPE!

Gotta love a basic, simple sloppy joe recipe.  I added some zucchini b/c I had one sitting in the fridge (good way to sneak veggies into kids food).  I also added a couple teaspoons of yellow mustard and used balsamic vinegar in place of white.

Made no changes.  We don't like green pepper and I made this recipe specifically because my husband said his mom used to make sloppy joes with celery in it.  He loved them and said to give them 5 stars.  Thanks for sharing!

Surprisingly tasty! With the following tweaks, it's our family's new fave sloppy joe recipe: Reduced brown sugar to 1T, which was plenty. Added a little chopped red pepper and 2 minced cloves of garlic. Finely chopped the celery.

The meat was really sweet. Next time I will decrease the amount of brown sugar and possibly add more vinegar. But overall, great home made recipe!

Excellent and easy. Variations are easily forgiven in this recipe to suit your individual taste. Try making it with a creamy tomato soup base as well as any variety of your favorite vegetable add-ins: bell peppers, diced tomatoes or minced carrot.

I thought these turned out great.  I added an extra 1 tsp garlic powder, 1 tsp chipotle powder, 1/2 tsp cajun spice, 1 tsp liquid smoke, and a little extra salt and pepper to taste.  My husband thought they were really good.

Delicious!  And easy to make.  The kids are already asking for it again.  I used 3 stalks of celery and one small/med onion (a tad more than the recipie calls for but easier than measuring).  Perfect.

As a disclaimer, I have never made Sloppy Joes before.  That being said, my family enjoyed this recipe.  I only made 22 minor changes, I used half turkey & half ground beef, and I sauteed the onions & celery before adding them into the mix. Otherwise I stuck to the recipe & it was a crowd pleaser!  Thank you.

This sounds yummy, however, as a vegetarian, as always, I will replace the ground beef with ground garbanzo beans and the Worcestershire sauce with Kikkoman soy sauce. Works perfectly every time.

I've never been a fan of Sloppy Joes.  Mostly because they were way too messy and way too sweet.  This recipe is neither and has changed my mind about the old Joe.  I even froze a batch and it was great!

Anything that makes my daughter ask if she can have another portion of something after she takes only a bite or two gets 5 stars!  I followed the recipe to a "T" except I did not add the celery, because of my kids.  Mt husband ate at least 4 sandwiches.  Great recipe, definite keeper.

This was delicious.  I didn't chop up the onions (feeling lazy) or celery (none of us like it), but followed the rest of the recipe.  We loved the taste and how quick it cooked up, so this is a keeper.  Thank you!

This is a good base recipe. I did make changes though.  I ommited the ketchup because it's too similar to the tomato soup. Instead I used 1/2 C of Open Pit Original BBQ sauce. That added a lot of tang and snap to it. I added about 1/2 C of minced green and red peppers (mixed together). I only used about 2 Tbl. of brown sugar heeding others warnings that it was too sweet. I used a little more of the vinegar for that added tang. I added cracked black pepper and doublled the garlic. I changed all of this because this is more to the taste that my husband and I like. But as I said, a good base recipe to add or subtract for your own use.

These sloppy joes were pretty tasty!  I noticed some of the reviewers saying the mixture was too runny so I just cooked the liquid down a bit and they were perfect.  Next time I make these though, I might reduce the brown sugar a bit because it seemed a little sweet.  But, otherwise these were great and I will keep this recipe for future use.

This recipe is good when prepared as is.  Could use a bit more seasoning, and does not need the brown sugar at all.  As others have suggested, bbq sauce is a good addition.

Finely chop the celery to disguise it a little from your kids.

Great recipe for Sloppy Joes.  I reduced the amount of celery to about 1/2 cup, used white wine vinegar, and added lots of fresh ground pepper.  I also added about 1/4 cup of bbq sauce but I think it would taste fine without it too.

This is very good.  If you're looking for a canned knock off minus the green pepper, though, this isn't it - it's much lighter, not as strongly tomato-y.  I used bbq sauce isntead of ketchup, cut the brown sugar to 1 tbsp, and grated the veggies instead of chopping - I think I might try adding in carrot next time.  I also added in a tbsp or two of dijon.  We'll definitely make it again - even my youngest, the diehard chicken nugget child, said it was good, and actually ate a whole sandwich.

Very easy recipe to follow and absolutely delicious!! The only thing I did differently was not adding the celery. I cooked the meat in the skillet then threw everything in the crock pot so I could run some errands. It only needed a couple of hours on high just to get everything blended together. The kids and husband said to make it again soon and no more canned mixes!!

Have made this twice with great success. Love the blended flavors of soup, ketchup, and sugar. Didn't change a thing & this whole family loved it!

These were great! My four year-old and I had two helpings, my husband had four. Everyone loved them. This was such a quick and easy meal to throw together. I can see how some would think they tasted a bit sweet, but I actually really liked them that way. No more Manwich's for us ever again.

Wonderful! I never thought I liked sloppy joes, but now I know what I don't like are sloppy joes made from canned sloppy joe sauce. I spiced them up with a little cayenne and added a little less sugar.

My husband thought there was way too much celery, but that's easily remedied - I'll be making them again (without any celery at all) very soon!

I love this recipe!  The only thing I changed was the tomato soup. I know, I know. I'm the only person in world who hates tomato soup...lol I used a small can of tomato paste and some water. Otherwise, it was great.

I added a lot more ketchup and cut back on the brown sugar, I also added a bit more Worcestershire sauce. This was a fun, nostalgic dinner for 2 adults, I know neither of us had had a sloppy joe in ages, but we like things to be more savory than sweet so we were pleased with the results, it still tasted like a sloppy joe but not wasn't so runny or sweet. Served with onion tater tots, green salad, it's great for a weeknight.

I made this for a picnic and my children like it soooo much that my eldest son had five servings of the bun!
But I use 1/2 bottle of chilli sauce and 1/2 bottle of tomato sauce instead of tomato soup and it was awesome. Sure a keeper.

This was pretty good.  I followed it to a "T" and found it to be a bit dry (I guess it's supposed to be that way but I wanted more liquid), so I added a small can of tomato sauce (213 ml) and that helped, plus it helped cut down on the sweetness.  Kids liked that there were no peppers. Next time I make this I'm going to mix the liquid ingredients first before putting it into the hamburger mixture.  Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe was a hit with the pickiest kids(mine!), so I am giving it 5 stars. I used ground turkey and just a  little sugar,also used onion powder, instead of the onion, added a bit of paprika to spice it up just a bit. Everyone loved this.Please keep in mind that this is a kids recipe, and accordingly is perhaps a bit bland for adult tastes, but for picky kids this had amazing results.

This recipe was pretty good. I didn't thaw out enough hamburger, so I used 1 lb instead of two. still was good, however it needed something, so I added a tad of BBQ sauce, and a splash of beer. Made it pretty darn good.

Yum Yum!! I enjoyed this a lot- it's extra tasty on hot summer days like today. Just a note: I'm so picky, in fact i didn't even add the celery or onion- instead i used a dash of ground celery seed and a bit of onion powder- tasted great!!!

This is, by far, the most delicious sloppy joe recipe I have ever had.  Like the children for whom this recipe was initially made, I too do not like green peppers (or red ones, for that matter).  Even my daughter likes it, and she normally does not eat meals made with beef.

I multiplied the recipe by 5 and served to a group of Boy Scout leaders. The only change was that I had to brown the meat in batches. I added veggies to the last batch after draining the meat. After meat and veggies were done I put everything into an electric roaster. It was a big hit - several people asked for the recipe. No complaints about the sweetness. Thanks for the great recipe!

My adaptation is 1 Lb ground turkey, 1/2 onion, 1/4 cup celery, 2 tsp minced garlic, cooked all together, drain. Add can tomato soup, 2 Tbs ketchup, 2 tsp white vinegar, 1 Tbs & 1 tsp brown sugar, 1 tsp Worcestershire sauce, 1/4 tsp salt.
I then used toasted buns with a bit of shredded cheddar.

This was the elementary school recipe back in 1960's. This is the best!! I make it til this day. If the kids don't see what is in it, by chopping it to diquise it, they will eat it as all do. I wouldn't change a thing. Need some zing? Add a habenaro!

I've made this recipe countless times and it's absolutely delicious! My kids love it too. I was so sick of Manwich blah! I've made it without the celery just because I didn't happen to have any and it's fine either way. Sometimes I add a little BBQ sauce or a little extra garlic, you can't really mess it up!

This recipe was great! We had a craving for sloppy Joe's and I decided to try this month. I did add half of a chopped green bell pepper and browned the veggies with the meat. The results were fantastic. Thank you!

Ok, my family likes green pepper so I added that. Used tomato sauce instead of catsup and added few drops of hot sauce. Was told by family that this is now the new sloppy joe recipe. Get rid of the others.

Excellent! Made a half recipe, wish I had made full for leftovers!  I used almost a whole can of the soup in the 1/2 version. Much much better than canned!  Thank you.

Great recipe.  I followed it pretty much except I did not have enough celery so I did a half c. of celery and a half c. of green peppers.  I was skeptical about the vinegar but found that is only enhanced all the flavors, not add any vinegar flavor. The next day it was even better.  Thanks this is the perfect not so sloppy, sloppy joe.

Wonderful! We prefer green peppers so I subbed green peppers for celery ( the food processor can purée veggies & my picky oldest never notices;) kept everything else the same. Was in a hurry on a week night so didn't measure exactly but did keep in using the rest of the ingredients listed... just eyeballed amounts. Turned out great. Have made it several times & recommended to family..they also really enjoyed it!

I fixed the recipe exactly except I used ground turkey instead of ground beef. I can see where some reviewers mentioned the bland factor, but in my opinion, it isn't so bland itself, but it is bland when compared to a Manwich or the packet mixes. Those are either twangy or some other spice. This recipe tastes made from scratch which i think is pleasing. Just a hint of tomato and hint of sweetness, not too much of anything. Anyone can tweak it to their liking, but I think it's really good as it is if you aren't looking for a lot of spice or zip. But it's still a messy sloppy joe in my opinion, and that's nothing a napkin can't handle. I'll definitely make this again and not buy the mixes or cans.

My family and I loved this recipe, it was really easy for me to make and it tasted amazing. It was very delicious. They aren't too neat, I still got some on my hands, but that is the fun of SLOPPY joes! Great recipe and look forward to making it again.

Nicely Done!  Everyone enjoyed.  Next time I am going to cook 3-4 hours in a crock pot to allow the flavors to come together and the celery to soften up a little.  Thanks for sharing!

I used dark turkey meat instead of ground beef, the darker meat is a bit juicier than the white meat. 
My husband is a diabetic, so I made the joes without the brown sugar, then took some out for him and added the sugar to the rest (adjusting the amount a bit, but not much:) This is an easy meal to make for all ages, and great to take to anyone who needs a bit of cheering up! Sloppy Joes are a great comfort food!

Ive never had a "Sloppy Joe" before, but this was really good. The only reason it wasn't "Five Star" was that I had halved the meat but forgot to half everything else. Oops... Anyhow, it was incredible. :)

Yum. The only things I did different, I upped the onions to 1 c., skipped the brown sugar and added a Tblsp. of our favorite "Waldo's BBQ" sauce.

This is one of my regular recipes.   It tastes great, is easy to make and is healthy.  The only modifications I make are:
1 tablespoon or so of brown sugar (as opposed to 1/4 cup)
A few teaspoons of hot sauce
Omit the salt (I can never understand the need to add salt to a recipe where the ingredients already contain sodium)

Trying to get away from processed/canned foods and needed a basic recipe.  This was great!  It is a little sweet with the brown sugar for my taste so I reduced it by half and also subsituted half the ketchup for chili sauce.  Not so much for the kids but if you like a little spice it was very tasty.

VERY GOOD!  Very Sweet.  After reading some of the reviews I tasted before adding the brown sugar.  It was pretty sweet at that point so I only put 1/2 the amount.  The next time I make I am only going to add 1/4 of what it calls for.  I also used 1/2 of the ground beef and replaced the other 1/2 with sausage. Very Good Combo!

OMG this is fantastic.  My family has never been big sloppy joe fans.   Hate manwich.  This has a completely different taste.  I omitted the onion and celery.  Topped the sandwich with a little shredded cheddar to make it seem even more kid friendly.  I like how it is neat, too.  Thank you Aunt Mamie!

Wonderful flavor.  I prepared it in a slow cooker using the remains of a sirloin tip roast which was okay, but next time I will use the hamburger and do it in a skillet as recommended.

Delicious! Loved making "home made" sloppy joes as opposed to buying a can of the mix. We don't eat a lot of beef in our house so we used ground turkey instead and it tasted fantastic!

I have been making this recipe for a while now and we all love it. Tonight though, instead of a bun, I wrapped the meat in lettuce. I don't know if I'll ever eat it with a bun again. My daughter also loved the lettuce wrap and my husband, who had already plopped his meat on a bun will be trying it next time.

It was good but a little sweet.  If you like it that way, great.  If you would rather have it a little tangier than sweet, I'd add more ketchup/worcheshire/vinegar and a little less brown sugar.  A good recipe overall, hence the four stars rating :)

Made this today - first time ever. We don't eat Sloppy Joe's in Norway. And even thou I had celery in it and eeeverybody hates it - they all loved the food LOL....haven't told them about the celery and that will stay a secret too. Next time I'll other greens to it so the kids eat it without knowing.

Always bought Sloppy Joe out of a can for the convenience. Those days are gone. This reminded me of my school days eating in the cafeteria. This was the one good meal they offered. I've tried to doctor the canned version up but no need anymore. This was quick, simple and extremely tasty !!!

We thought these were good.Instead of celery I used red bell pepper.I only had 1 lb of hamburger so I cut the brown sugar and ketchup down to half.It was just a litttle too sweet for me but my husband liked these a lot.

These were super easy to make and my kids gobbled them up.  I added some minced garlic and extra worcestershire and I'm glad I did, it would have needed something more.  I mixed the leftovers with a container of Bob Evans macaroni & cheese the next night for dinner (instant hamburger helper!) and that was amazing too!

I don't think this was a bad recipe, but it was not for me. I thought it was rather sweet, I guess I am use to a more tangy sloppy joe. I added dill pickle to it to tone down the sweetness.

Excellent!!! I did a slightly low-fat version by using turkey in place of beef; light brown sugar; wheat buns.  This was absolutely the best sloppy joe - EVER!!

Love it! Only skipped the vinegar, added a tablespoon of barbecue sauce instead. This will be our sloppy joe, (we call it steamburger) recipe from now on!

This is good but I did 'tweak' it a little. I added 1 chopped green pepper and I doubled the soup, ketchup, vinegar, brown sugar, garlic powder, and Worcestershire sauce. I simmered on low for about 1/2 hour.

Excellent!!  We made this tonight and it reminded us of the sloppy joes we had growing up.  My only change - I used balsamic vinegar instead of white.  This is definitely a keeper recipe!!!

I found this recipe to be quick and easy to make but it was pretty bland and overly sweet.  I improved it by adding some extra seasonings, real garlic and a few other things which made it very nice but am rating it  as it was written.  It was ok, but I won't be repeating it.

This was good, and I would've given five stars if the brown sugar didn't seem to be overpowering. I added chili powder, and it came out perfect.

Yum! I added extra ketchup though; about 1/4 cup more to give it more color and sweetness. I also added some kosher salt to taste. I don't know about everyone else, but my neat sloppy joes were not neat at all :)

very good recipe.  I didn't feel like cooking, and this was easy and very tasty.  I sub'd no sodium tomato puree for the soup, since I am sensitive to salt and it allowed me to season it to my liking.  So much better than packaged or canned and so much better for you without the additives.

I wanted  a quick and easy dinner, so, I thought canned sloppy joes. I had the fries made, salad made and the burger cooked. I went to open the canned mix and it exploded! (It was in the pantry WAY longer than I thought!) So, I quickly went for the best rated recipe on the AR website. You seriously can't go wrong this way. This recipe was delicious, I will never make canned again.Quick, easy and always have ingred. on hand. Soooooo Good!

Great!  I used a bit more onion and celery and threw in three cloves of minced garlic rather than the garlic powder.  I also used a can of tomato paste rather than tomato soup.  I added a splash or two more of vinegar and worcestershire to give it a little more tang and cut the sugar in half.

LOVED this recipe!  Say goodbye to the mix envelop or can!!!  I left out the celery because I didn't have any on hand and I added a little bit of liquid smoke.  They came out great!!!!  My kids loved the sloppy Joes!  I will be making this recipe again.

Its a good starter recipe for the average sloppy joe. you are going to have to add a few things to aquire that taste you look for in a sloppy joe, more garlic, katchup, vinegar! the 40 people i cook for at work are always exstatic about the food i'm making and personally i wouldn't serve this recipe as is

Wow this was very delicious. I did substitute red wine vinegar instead of white, i also chopped up some red bell pepper rather than celery, and i blended some can diced tomatos with some tomato boullion and a little water, the flavor was not to sweet or to tangy it was just perfect, with some potato salad on the side yummy=)

This was really great! I made it exactly as the recipe calls for with the exception that I scooped this onto open faced buns and put sliced cheese on top and then broiled it for a few minutes. YUM!  The whole family (ages 1-83) loved it! So easy for those busy days...

I usually make the canned stuff, but was out so I fixed this and will never fix the canned again!  It was not only easy but had a great flavor.  This is my new go-to recipe when I can't think of anything to fix for dinner in a hurry.

The kids really liked these.  I have other recipes that my husband and I like better, but the kids don't like them at all.

DELISH! Using some of the suggestions (garlic, etc.) other reviewers have made, these are amazing Sloppy Joes!! I've made these for a bridal shower and everything and people cannot get enough of them!! I had multiple requests for the recipe. They are just awesome!

I liked this, but think the ingredients would work better for just one pound of ground beef.  It wasn't as moist as I like sloppy joes.  However, it had a really great flavor.  But if you are going to make it for two pounds, I would suggest doubling the remaining ingredients to moisten it up a bit.

We adjusted the recipe to feed 30 and it was a hit. It has a nice sweetness to it that the children young and old enjoyed. We used 3 skillets for the first stage and then drained and combined into a large pot for the second stage. 7.5 lbs. of ground beef...it just fits into a 5.5 qt Crockpot.

Made using a combination of review changes and my own... 1st - either only use 1 lb meat or double the remaining ingredients that start with tomato soup.  I started recipe using 1lb. extra lean (4%) ground beef and 1lb. ground turkey, it wasn't 'sloppy' enough for my likes, hence doubling the sauce.  I took other reviewers advice  and added 1 drop liquid smoke, 3 heaping spoons of crushed garlic (from a jar) and about 2 tbsp of bbq sauce.  I didn't have any celery on hand, but used 1 1/2 cup of red onion and cut it up with a chop wizard.  When I did this, I also ignored reviewers advice to leave out the brown sugar, as I typically like a bit of sweet, but when I tasted the first batch of the sauce it indeed was too sweet even for my likings.  Since I decided to double the sauce, I left the brown sugar out of the 2nd batch I made.  Next time I make this (and you better believe I'll make it again!) I will still use the 1lb beef/1lb turkey combo, and will double the remaining ingredients, add the extras I mentioned (liquid smoke, bbq sauce and crushed garlic) and omit the brown sugar.  Fantastic - & my whole family LOVED it!

Made this for my family. Came out just a little bland but we cant always blame the recipe. We ARE the ones that are making it. I think i needed to add more ingredients then what it called for but thats probably due to all the different tastebuds we can. All in all it was good and the familia loved it.

I've made this a few times as the recipe is written and my family loves it.  But I have a family gathering coming up where there are a lot of picky kids.  These kids don't like anything crunchy in their sloppy joes.  I used 1/2 tablespoon of onion powder in place of chopped onions.  I left out the salt and celery and used added 1/2 teaspoon of celery salt instead.  I tried it out on my sons and their friends and it was a hit.  Thanks Aunt Mamie for sharing the recipe!!!

I used half ground turkey and half ground beef and fresh minced garlic. We thought this was just okay. My husband was up front and said there's no replacement for canned sloppy joe mix. I thought it was a little too sweet.

This was my first from scratch "sloppy joe". It was a little sweet so I added 1T of tomato paste and a little more vinegar until it had just a bit more sour bite. My skeptical 4.5 yr. old grandson quickly asked for more after devouring a half sandwich. Also, I made with ground turkey. So long "Manwich".

I won't lie, I was a little apprehensive about this recipe when I was making it. However in the end, I could get enough of it. :) I really wish the people who hadn't added the celery or onion wouldn't rate this recipe lower than 5 starts because they think it tastes too bland. Even though I like celery and onion, I did as another reviewer suggested and threw them into my chopper till they were really small and added them in. You really can't tell that it's in there, but the flavor really shows and I really don't think most kids would notice it in there.

I liked it although it is a bit on the sweet side.  The kids weren't as positive so we had leftovers which (true the description) froze and reheated very well.

Yummmy!!  I needed something last minute today and came across this recipe.  The only change I made was to saute the onion and celery first and then add the hamburger.  I like the veggies soft so there are no complaints from the teen sons-who by the way had seconds and the 16 yo declared "this is a keeper"!  We'll definitely be making this regularly.  Thanks for the recipe.

Great taste and texture, but a bit sweet. Next time I'd add half the sugar called for, or less. I added chopped bell pepper, and a tablespoon of (Open Pit)bbq sauce, because it's spicy and not sweet.

Husband said best Sloppy Joe he's ever eaten! When he learned we were having them for supper he initially frowned but changed his tune after the first bite.  No deviations...made exactly as written.

Great tasting little sandwich. I used dried minced onion instead of fresh and garlic salt instead of plain. There was plenty of sauce and they weren't too dry at all. Wonderful flavor this didn't taste at all like meat and canned soup. I didn't even simmer this one my usual 30+ minutes, just heated it up and let it simmer while I toasted the bread. Definitely a keeper! Thanks for a great recipe.

This recepie is yummy!! Even my 4 year old picky son loved it. The only thing I did different is.. I added fresh garlic to the meat With the onion and celery. Also I added some of my own spices. (oregano, salt, pepper and all purpose seanoning) while browning the ground beef. I personally like to season my meats with spices rather than just salt. Other wise I did every thing else. It came out great!

This was a very BASIC version of sloppy joe - I took the advice of the last person who reviewed it and it was still very bland! I never eat sloppy joe from a can since I started making my own, but to be honest I think I would prefer the taste of the canned sloppy joe then this recipe. I tried to salvage it and added cumin, garlic, BBQ sauce, and even a few shakes of hot sauce, and even my KIDS said it was bland. I wanted to try something new, but I think in the future I will stick to my own recipe. sorry!

This recipe is perfect as written.  Truly the best sloppy joes I have ever had.  And if the guests at my son's birthday party are any indication, the best they have ever had as well.  I tripled the recipe and only have enough leftovers for dinner tonight.  I'm looking forward to it!

Awesome!  Perfect as is.  However, I did add 1T of hickory smoked bbq sauce the 2nd time I made it just because.  That was great too.  I made this to keep in the fridge for a little later in the week....it didn't make it off the stove.

This was really good. I followed the recipe exactly as written. Next time I might add a couple pinches of pepper and maybe an extra dash of salt.

This recipe is absolutely the best tasting! I saute the chopped onion with fresh chopped garlic in a little olive oil, then brown the ground beef. I use tomato paste instead of ketchup, to decrease the sweetness a bit. Finally, instead of plain salt, I season the meat with "Jocko's" seasoning. However, this seasoning can only be purchased at Jocko's Steakhouse in Nipomo, California! Delicious!

YUM!  I chopped the Celery with the Onions and some Garlic in the Food Processor, like Others suggested, and I did NOT think that the Celery was "overwhelming" at all! I did add the full Amount of Brown Sugar and did NOT find it too sweet, I found it just right! Awesome, easy, inexpensive Dish, and I will keep making it  :)

Very good!  My husband was nutso for this sauce!  I don't think it's bland, but it is sweet, which is what we like.  I added more garlic powder, some oregano, and some Tabasco to jazz it up a bit and it came out great!  I was a little apprehensive about the celery, but it cooked down and provided a little crunch without being overpowering.  I will definitely make this again!

This was good.  I like green peppers, so I did use those instead of celery.  I felt it was missing a certain zip to it, though.  I think the tomato soup kind of made it bland.  Other sloppy joe recipes seem to have a lot of ketchup in them.  I think it would be bolder to use more ketchup and less tomato soup.  It may also help to use less brown sugar (maybe use just 2 Tbsp.)  But we did enjoy our dinner and it satisfied my craving!

My first time to make home made Sloppy Joes we always used the can stuff.  I never did eat the can stuff made me have heart burn too bad BUT this was GREAT and my family ate the whole recipe. The only thing I did different was add a tea of chopped chili pepper I had. Thanks so much now I too can eat sloppy joes.

WOW! I was quite surprised!! I've never put tomato soup in sloppy joes, and was very happy with the results!! I used ground turkey, out of preference, and added real garlic vs. the powder, and don't know if it made that much of a difference, but I liked them! As did the 5 yr old and 14 month old!!

These were FANTASTIC! Better than the traditional canned stuff! This will become a regular for us! I used half ground turkey and half super lean round beef and we had enough to make roughly 8 good side sandwiches.

Okay, this is now the recipe my family uses for sloppy joes.  In my opinion, they are the best sloppy joes I have ever had.  I have had several people ask for the recipe.  These sloppy's somehow remind us of the good old-fashioned sloppy joes we have at church functions, down in the basement accompanied by pans of various baked goods made by the ladies.

We had a family gathering this past weekend, including 5 children, so I made this as written, just doubled.  To solve the "chunk" issue I just whirled the celery and onion in the food processor.;)  Everyone enjoyed these joes tremenously!  This is definitely a recipe I'll make again.

These were really good, but I think the amount of brown sugar the recipe calls for was too much. One or two tablespoons of brown sugar is enough, anything more is too sweet and is a bit overpowering. Otherwise, a great, easy recipe. I will gladly make this again.

Fantastic Sloppy Joes! I made this in a bulk capacity, using ground beef, turkey, and vension. I stuck to the recipe but also added some cayenne pepper and red pepper seeds and they were sweet and spicy sloppy joes.  They were a HUGE hit!

Made these last night for dinner. I didn't add the celery, because we didn't have any, but I did add a half of a green pepper diced up small and a couple cloves of garlic. Based on other reviews, I added a touch of BBQ sauce and only 1 tbls of brown sugar. These turned out so good, I will make these from now on! These are way better than Manwich! Hubby and daughter both loved them. Can't get any better than that!

Yummy!! Great recipe.  I didn't have celery on hand, but I will definetly use it next time.  It was a bit on the sweet side, so I'll just half the brown sugar to 1/8 cup next time.  Even the loyal "Manwich Man" that I married loved them =-)

This recipe is good, but I made a few changes. First, I used 1 lb of ground sirloin which was enough for 6 sloppy joes. I think 2 lbs will give you 12 or more. I cut the brown sugar in half and added Malt Vinegar instead of white distilled and I really like it. I also left out the celery and added crushed red pepper, paprika, parsley and fresh garlic instead of powdered [which I cooked with the meat]. I also toasted onion rolls in the broiler. Yum!

Soooo much better than the canned stuff! Didn't have any tomato soup on hand so I substituted with 1/2 c. tomato sauce & 1/2 c. ketchup. Simple recipe with down home comfort goodness. Thanks!

We have made this twice now.  The kids really like it.  Last time I did 1 lb ground beef and 1 lb ground turkey.  Did not have celery to used celery salt and did not add regular salt.  Cooked minced garlic with the meat and still added powder.  Also added a dash or two of Mildly Wild BBQ sauce.  Also cut the brown sugar down to 1/8 cup.  Husband said better than what comes out of a can.

This was very good, just not quite 5 star. We made exactly as written except forgot the celery. Not on purpose, just forgot. First words out of my 9 year old son's mouth...this is sweet, this is really good. And, he put 2 thumbs up and had a second sandwich. Loved the fact that had all the ingredients on hand and it was so quick and easy to make. So, for him, it was 5 stars! Served with mac and cheese and a tossed salad.

Oh my gosh, this was so easy, so fast, and a huge hit!  And the great thing with sloppy joes is that they get even better each time you reheat them for leftovers!  The only thing I added was 2 tsp. of regular mustard - it added a way nice little kick!

This was very good! I used onion powder instead of onion because of laziness!!!  Thanks for sharing, this is definitely a keeper.

ps....I didn't have any celery so mine was great without it too.
UPDATE:  The next time I made it I did have celery and used it, I also chopped up green peppper as I like it.  You just can't go wrong with this recipe!

Very nice recipe... four stars because I really have nothing else to compare it to as this was the first time we had sloppy joes!  My husband and I ate it - my 5 year old didn't like it and my 7 year old ate it reluctantly... that said I will be making it again!

Very easy and delicious.  I followed a tip from Jessica Seinfeld and added a cup of puree'd Butternut squash for added veggies.  You couldn't even tell or taste the difference!!  Great for picky eaters. I still added a veggie side dish as well.

I love this recipe -- have not tried any other variation but I doubt there's a need to! One time I was unaware that I didn't have a can of tomato soup on hand so to adlib I used regular tomato sauce and a little bit of beef broth -- this translates well.

This was DELICIOUS! I didn't have an green pepper so I didn't use that -but it was still wonderful. It would likely be even better with the green pepper :) Easy too!!!! Will definately make many times again!

I was in a rush when I couldn't find the can of sloppy joe that I was positive I had and had already cooked the meat. I found this and threw in everything except the onion and celery because I didn't have time and it was still awesome! Will definitely make it again.

This recipe is great because of it's versatility. The only essentials are the beef and tomato soup - it would be bland that way, but add whatever you like! I throw in dried onions while I brown the beef, then add Chili Powder, Pepper and mustard with the tomato soup. We serve them on tortillas so they aren't so messy.

Mine did not come out very neat, they were actually the sloppiest sloppy joes I've ever made :0) They did taste quite good though. Not bland at all. I skipped the celery but did brown some chopped onion with the beef and I used crushed garlic instead of garlic power.

I didn't have any of the canned sloppy joe stuff and wanted to try something with a little different flavor. Well, I found it! Excellent taste, it was neat and the family enjoyed it too! I brought the canned sloppy joe mix on a recent camping trip (for quick and easy sake)and it didn't taste good. Neat Sloppy Joe's are worth trying!

Definitely the best sloppy joe recipe I've ever had.  I live in Europe now and the kids love it. As someone else said, use the entire  can of tomato soup even if you only make half. It's a bit difficult for me to get my hands on tomato soup here so I use either a can of tomato paste or a can of diced tomatoes with sauce.  The only thing you  might want to do is use brown sugar according to your personal taste, but we like it kind of sweet.  Thanks for this great recipe!

I thought it was quite good!  I halved the recipe since it's just my husband, 16m daughter and I, and since I didn't want to use 1/2 a can of tomato soup, I used an 8oz can of tomato sauce and omited the ketchup.  Everything else I did as per the recipe.  It's a little on the sweet side, but I think that's how sloppy joes are s'posed to be.  I'll make it again!

My husband and I really liked these sloppy joes. I was so sick of buying the mix at the store, and I was able to modify this one perfectly to my tastes. I left out the celery and the brown sugar, and went easy on the ketchup and vinegar. The mixture was actually really "neat", which made for easy eating and less soggy buns. Thanks for the great recipe!

My 8 year old did not like this at all and I barely could eat it.  Since I dislike throwing away food, I froze the leftovers with the idea that I will drain off the sauce and reseason the meat by adding spices and hot peppers.

We loved these sloppy joes.  My husband doesn't really care for sloppy joes, but he wolfed them down.  I did leave out the celery because if there are chunks of anything, there are problems.  Will definitely make again!

We make these all the time! We usually leave out the celery, and if I have no onion on hand we just substitute onion powder. The more you make these, the better they get! I passed this recipe on to tons of family, and they all love it too!

Great sloppy joes!!!!!  I use a 8 oz can of tomato sauce instead of the soup.  I also leave out the celery and onions and add some onion powder for flavor.  (we are pretty picky eaters at out house)  Thanks for the great recipe! I will never  buy canned sloppy joe mix again.

I've never made/eaten a sloppy joe before so I'm not the best authority on this, but I thought it was really good!  I followed the recipe but eliminated the celery - my 5 year old and husband said they'd like me to make them again sometime.  Thanks for an easy recipe!

Sloppy Joes are a favorite weekend dinner at our house, and I've tried a variety of recipes. We're not talking about something complicated, here, but it does take the right mixture of ingredients. This is THE one. I left out the celery because no one here likes it, and it still was great.

I loved this, so did my kids.  I saw the other comments and used less brown sugar (about 1 Tbl).  Since I didn't have tomato soup I used a can of sauce.  Thank you for sharing your recipe.

This is the best!!! I have had so many people ask what goes in it that I started printing off recipe cards for people to take home with them. I've been enjoying this recipe for a little over a year and I'm still printing off cards for the newcomers.

I used tomato sauce instead of soup (flavor is better) and 1/2 the sugar is a great idea.  This is the best sloppy joe recipe ever! I just let it simmer until it reached the right consistancy for sandwiches. This also cooks out the raw tomato taste and lets all flavors blend.

I made the recipe exactly but added and extra 1/4 cup Ketchup.  These were a huge hit in my family, the leftover only lasted 1 day.  I have already shared this recipe with family members.

This was pretty good.  My husband does not care for for the store brands that have a lot of sugar so I did not add as much sugar as it said.  It turned out really well.

Very good recipe, but you really can afford to scale back on the brown sugar.  I would say by as much as half.

They were a little too sweet for us.  I added A1 and it helped a little.  I'd make them again but use less brown sugar.

Two weeks ago I gave my daughter a H.S. Grad. Party. I customized it for 100 people, and followed it exactly the day before party. I browned all hamburger, onion, celery up in 6lb. batches. I mixed well all other ingred. in large bowl. Put hamb. in a new, large storage tub for easiest mixing. Stored in smaller containers. Everyone LOVED them. I got many compliments!! The BEST!

As my 8, 6 and 2 year-olds say..."Yum!"  We really enjoyed this, made with ground turkey.  Will try 1/2 the sugar next time just because I think it would be just as good...but this was still wonderful.

These are good! Whole family loved them! I have never made home-made sloppy joes before, and now that I've tried these, I'll never make with a packet again!

I used only 1 lb. ground turkey so I halved the other recipe ingredients. Also, I substituted red wine vinegar for the white vinegar since I didn't have any white. I also added a handful of real diced tomatoes.

This was a GREAT sloppy joe recipe....MUCH better than the canned kind.  I would suggest cutting back the brown sugar to 2T and add a bit more garlic powder.  It's a little too sweet as is.  We did sprinkle some shredded cheddar on top.  DELICIOUS!!!  This is definitely going into my index card recipe box.

I enjoyed this recipe very much.  My hubby was not as excited as I was.  I used a can of tomato sauce instead of the tomato soup.  It was more beefy than the usual "canned" sloppy Joe sauce- which I loved!
Will definately make again!

my kids didn't even know what sloppy joes were, we don't have them in Scotland. All 5 of them, aged 2 - 15 years, loved this. I'll be keeping this as it's almost impossible to find something that they all will eat. Thanks a lot

Even my very picky eater LOVED this!  Both DH and kids don't like peppers, so I thought this would be good and I wasn't disappointed.  I didn't want to open a can of soup to just use half, as I only used 1 lb of ground beef, so I just used an 8 oz can of tomato sauce instead.  My 6yo son said it was like eating meatballs.  This is in my permanent file!

I made this exactly as written with the exception of using Beyond Beef (plant based) instead of ground beef because my my husband is vegan. 

It turned out great and he LOVES it and it is now officially in the rotation!

It’s too hot to BBQ so I searched my freezer for options and found a 2+ pound package of Turkey Meat. A quick search of Allrecipes yielded this recipe. I followed the recipe exactly, but added more Granulated Garlic and Granulated Onion and used Smoked Salt. (Our Taste Preferences). This was almost a five star, it was just a bit sweet for my tastes. Next time, and I would definitely make this again, I’d use less brown sugar. Thanks for a pretty good dinner solution.

Just okay.  Out of the 7 of us, nobody was a real fan.  Nobody chose to have seconds (which is not normal around here).  Just something about the flavor didn't do it for us.  I'll try another recipe next time.

I did screw up & wrote the recipe down incorrectly by writing 1 C. chopped onion and I used a can of tomato sauce like a reviewer suggested instead of the condensed tomato soup (I didn't have any). I personally don't care for "Sloppy Joes", I never have so this was fine BUT my 2 picky eaters who despise Manwhich Sauce Sloppy Joes  & the school version LOVED IT! They just gobbled it up and praised dinner! So YAY  definitely a keeper & will be making again!

I reduced the sodium in the recipe by using a full 8 oz can of Cento Tomato Paste *instead* of the tomato soup, did not add the salt. Didn't have celery, so I used about 1/2 tsp of celery flakes. Browned the lean beef meat with a tad of olive oil in my electric Dutch oven, added the onions, then mixed in all the spices and let this cook at about 300 Deg for an hour or so. Reheated it for dinner. Tasted great and healthier than the canned alternative! You can always add more salt or other seasonings to taste later :)

It was delicious!  The only change I made was using tomato sauce instead of soup and I measured my brown sugar without packing it.

Everybody loved! I halved the recipe, skipped the brown sugar, added garlic instead of garlic powder with the celery and onion. Took out the meat mixture when browned, then threw in a whole can of tomato soup with the rest of the ingredients, simmered them, then re-added meat. Simmer down to desired consistency. I didn't measure anything.

Very tasty. .  This one has lots of flavor without the overpowering green pepper.  It was not too spicy so its kids friendly.  And you can add some cayenne pepper if you want to add a little kick for the adults.  I made two recipes to do a taste test and this one won our vote...It had a good consistency too, the sauce hangs on to the meat...the other recipe was more watery.

I made this exactly per the recipe, and my husband and I really like it.    I’ve made other Sloppy Joe recipes that were just so-so; I think I’m going to stick with this one.  I served this with home-made buns, which made it even better.

My husband and I enjoy these,  I'm not a fan of green peppers so the celery is a nice compromise. I also like the fact that this is a little sweeter than tomatoey. I have 
made this several times as is and it's a nice recipe.

1st time and turned out great!  I did add red and green peppers, spicy brown mustard, my fav bbq sauce (and as a result cut back on the brown sugar) and added a few drops of liquid smoke.  Taste was wonderful, my wife loved it!

This was sooo good!! Our friends were over for dinner and they just loved it.  I made it exactly the way the recipe read except for the  celery {didn,t  have any} and  it was delicious.   It was far from being bland!

After reading some reviews, I also omitted the brown sugar and used 1/2 ketchup & 1/2 BBQ sauce.  I also added 1 TBSP of molasses to give it more flavor & sweetness.

This is delicious! Only things I changed were to use half ground beef and half ground turkey and 1/8 cup of brown sugar. Potato masher is a great idea, I found it easier to use after the liquids were added. Also really like that it is easy to freeze.

I followed the recipe closely...used celery salt instead of actual celery (because I didn't have any) and it was a hit!  Won't buy the canned stuff again...thanks for sharing!

My boyfriend and I both really liked this sloppy joe recipe.  I loved that it wasn't messy, and it has a great taste.  I did cut back on the brown sugar a little bit though,  that  was making it too sweet for me.

As written I give this recipe 4 stars because it is just a little too sweet. Otherwise it's definitely good. I've always used a similar recipe (it happens to be similar to the base seasoning for my mom's chili and I didn't feel like digging out her recipe lol) so no big surprise that I had no problem adjusting it to my liking. I cut the brown sugar down by half, added a little extra vinegar and Worcestershire, and added a little chili powder. Nice thing about sloppy joes it that it's so easy to start out with the bare minimum seasoning and keep adding more til it's just right!

This is a fast and easy recipe. I can see why kids would like it. However, my parents found it a bit too sweet for them and I could not even taste the celery. I'll try it again, but cut way down on the sugar and maybe add bell pepper.

Made it without ketchup or sugar.  It was still quite sweet but okay taste.  Not sloppy as advertised.

I have tried quite a few sloppy joe recipes.  This one is ok but in my opinion is a little flat not enough zip.  It needs more vinegar and more spice

I have made this recipe many times and enjoyed it-BUT I really hit the jackpot when I didn't have any Campbell Tomatoe soup and SUBSTITUTED with Progresso Tomatoe Basil 1/2 can!!! It knocked this recipe out of the ballpark good!!!!!! So go I have to make more the next day.

I made this Sloppy Joe recipe exactly as stated except I added some green pepper.  It was very good and I got compliments but for me it was not savory enough.  I can understand that it would be a big hit with kids.  For me it was too sweet, probably due to the combination of brown sugar and condensed tomato soup.

Used about 10 ounces of Campbell's Creamy Tomato Soup (microwavable kind) instead of condensed tomato soup and my non-Sloppy Joe-loving wife liked it!  Hey Mikey!

These were pretty good! I didn't use celery because I didn't think my family would like it. It seemed to lack something when I was done, so I added some KC Masterpiece Kentucky Bourbon BBQ sauce, and it definitely tasted better (to us). I'll probably make it again.

I made this recipe since I am trying to eat less processed foods. I am so happy that my picky ten year old son and his friend (who never ate sloppy joes) loved them. I also felt good since I know exactly what was put into the seasoning not like when you buy a can or packet. This recipe will now be part of my rotating meals on my monthly menu. It's easy and a keeper!

Made exactly as recipe called for and it was fabulous,  We don't like cooked green pepper so that was a plus. Great recipe, tasted very good. Easy also. I used a good cut of ground beef (like ground chuck) because the rest of the recipe was very inexpensive to make. I would like to try again and use Tomato Paste instead of Tomato Soup. But this recipe is good as is.

Four stars is for the recipe as is- it was good but  we prefer it not so sweet. The second time i subbed 6oz tomato paste with 1/2 the can of water for the soup and eliminated the ketchup (this got rid of most of the  processed sugar) doubled the worchester and vinegar then halved the brown sugar. I also had red, yellow and orange bell pepper that i chopped fine and added with the onion and 3 minced cloves fresh garlic. Last salt and pepper to taste. We also ate it on brown rice instead of the bread the second time- 5 stars!

This is the first time in his 60 years that my husband likes sloppy joes! Easy to make. A bit too sweet, so added a little  bit of minced green pepper and a rounded teaspoon of chili powder (we like chili con carne). I will make this again, keeping my additions and maybe cutting the brown sugar in half. Still it was tasty!

Simply excellent as the recipe reads.  Might consider adding some barbecue sauce next time, but probably will not since this is so good.  We had it over whole grain bread from Panera and went back for seconds.  I am thinking that this recipe might be good for a Kairos Prison Ministry weekend meal.

I loved this recipe!  Just the right amount of tang and not too sloppy.  I decided to add a little ground oregano to add a little depth, and I decreased the amount of brown sugar...I might even delete the sugar next time.  My husband and kids loved them, this recipe is a keeper, thanks!

I made it just as directions said but cut everything in 1/2 b/c didn't have that much ground beef. My son & I who both love sloppy joes thought it was a really good recipe. Quite a bit  sweeter than 'manwich' that I usually make so if u don't like sweet cut down on the brown sugar a bit

My family loved it!  The changes I made were: dried onion instead of fresh (because I was out) which I just cooked with the burger, basalmic vinigar for the white, celery salt for the celery and salt, then lastly (which I think made the dinner) I substituded the buns for the biscuits in the can (yep even the Walmart ones) and rolled them out with my roller and enclosed the mix between 2 biscuits and cooked accordingly to the label.  My family loved it!  Note:  I cut the recipe in half for 1 pound of burger and it made 4 hand size servings and had meat left over, next time I will make sure I have 2 cans of biscuits so I can use up all of the meat.  No mess or forks as I folded the edges together so it was totally closed.  Thank you for the idea!

This is the recipe we have been using for over 40 years.  We just use apple cider vinegar instead of white vinegar, but these are my favorite sloppy joes!!

This is comfort food and like most recipes it's OK to tweak them to your own taste. I use 3 large cloves of garlic ( more if they're smaller) grated, 1 Tb of dill, steak sauce instead of Worcestershire, 1TB of yellow mustard, 1/2 tsp black pepper and 2 tsp of turmeric. We have this several times a year and sometimes I'll swap out the tomato soup for BBQ sauce and add a few drops of good quality liquid hickory smoke. Topped with pickle slices add a side of fries or tater tots and this is so satisfying. Since there are only 2 of us and I'm lazy I freeze half the recipe for when I'm rushed or just don't feel like cooking.

While it was good, it is not my favorite, a bit too sweet for me. For truly "neat" sloppy joes, use hot dog buns - no leaking!

I have not yet made this recipe, but I like that it has no Bell peppers, as I am allergic.  I like scratch ingredients, but am not averse to canned spaghetti sauce or ketchup or even tomato soup as long as no one in the family has an allergy or finicky problem.  And its nice that you can use what's around, especially on camping trips, etc.  Actually, I don't much use recipes as written, so this is adaptable for the dump cook, too.

Great recipe! Another way to make it less sloppy is to serve it in hot dog buns. I've been doing this for years and it really holds in the yummy mix!

Yum! I used fresh garlic instead of garlic powder(didn't have any), bell pepper instead of celery(was out) and added a dash of liquid smoke. Will make again. Served with mac and cheese, pickles, potato chips and onion dip for an easy weeknight dinner.

Didn't have celery, used celery SEED instead. I'm usually not a big fan of sloppy joe's but this was super easy, with ingredients on hand. I'm glad I tried it.

My family loved this recipe. I did make a few changes though. I used 1lb. ground beef & 1lb. ground pork and browned it with 1/2 cup minced onion & 3 cloves of chopped garlic. I omitted the celery b/c we are not big fans of celery & I have never heard of sloppy joes with celery. Instead of condensed tomato soup (which I prefer not to eat) I used 1 1/4 cup of ketchup and 1/4 cup of barbecue sauce, along with the salt, garlic powder, Worcestershire sauce, vinegar & brown sugar. I have tried many homemade versions of sloppy joes and we all agreed this is our favorite!

I stumbled on this recipe by accident on allrecipes.com and thought why not.  This turned out great.  Made per the recipe and everyone loved it, even the kids.  I did make with ground turkey because that is what I had and did add a drop or two of liquid smoke.  Will make again! Thanks!

I found these nothing to rave about, but perfectly acceptable for an easy dinner.

My family loved it. We do not like Manwich. I used turkey meat instead of ground beef. You could not taste the difference. I also used frozen chopped peppers and onions to make it easier.

Really loved how thick it turned out. Also, I only had 1 1/3 lbs. ground beef, so I cooked 1/2 cup lentils and about 1/4 cup masoor dal (red shelled lentils) and threw them in too. Delish!

I have used this recipe for a few years, and it is my go-to recipe for quick,tasty joes.  I use dried celery seed instead of real celery and soak dried onion chips in the vinegar instead of using real onions.  This is even more kid friendly.  I also add some liquid smoke and Worcestershire sauce to the beef when I am browning it.  Quick, easy and oh-so good.

Not bad, but too much brown sugar, and doesn't have the "zest" I was hoping for (as written).  So 3 stars.  I tweaked by adding cayenne pepper to offset some of the sweetness and needed more "sloppy" in my Joe, so also added more soup and a small amount of water to get it how I like.

I added cajun spices, fresh ground black pepper and fresh garlic and reduced the amount of brown sugar to suite my family's tastes.  It's a very good, thick sloppy joes recipe that is better than the canned stuff.  Thanks for a great recipe!

These are wonderful.  I will never buy the canned mix again!  I did change up the amounts of the ingredients for personal tastes but I kept all of them in there.  This also freezes well, which is a plus wince it makes so much.

My kids loved it! I did use less brown sugar, but it was very very tasty. I have a picky 7 year old and he wasn't fond of the green stuff, but once he tried it he didn't care! Thank you for sharing this.

This is so good! Kids and adults alike love it. I used apple cider vinegar and cut the sugar in half (diabetic people were eating this). I buttered the buns and toasted them in the oven. After spooning meat mixture on buns I topped with pepper jack cheese and a tiny bit finely shredded cabbage. So good!!

Only changes I made was to skip the brown sugar and added a couple squirts of bbq sauce.  I also put the veggies through the food processor. Easy to make excellent flavor. Tastes like the sloppy joes my grandma used to whip together.

Took this over to share with my son's family. Used 3 1/2 lbs. of hamburger so adjusted the recipe but did not add additional celery and sugar. Served with baked french fries. Easy, simple meal.  I will make it again.  Next time I will toast the rolls.

It was easy and quick but to be honest I hoped the picture was closer to what the hamburger mixture would look like when it was already.Sadly no, it was red and saucy and good however seeing as how my boys don't like tomato soup or even spagetti sauce...it was tried but they were unimpressed.I'll have to keep looking I guess as this one(despite the unredness of the meat in the picture), was still too strongly favored for my boys. I liked it but had the same problem as the boys way too much favor!Will try 1/2 or 1/4 of can of tomato soup next time and maybe leave ketchup out entirely. Thanks though!

These were a great alternative to the usual sloppy joes.  I felt great making them myself, rather than opening up a can.  And my husband who is usually not fond of sloppy joes ate these and told me I could make them again.  I didn't have any celery so I left that out and they were still good.  I think it would have been good in them though to add a little variety to the texture of the mixture.  Overall very yummy and easy!

This recipe is good for nights when you don't have a lot of time.  It's not anything fancy, but it makes a nice hot meal in little time.  I omitted the celery and used dried chopped onions in place of fresh and served in hamburger buns with frozen fries and a salad.  It's not a five because there isn't anything special about these, you won't crave these sloppy joes, but they taste good and are cheap and easy.

I have been making sloppy joes for years and have never had 1 complaint from my family. 1 .day I decided to try a new recipe and found this one. My guys LOVE it. They said it was the best sloppy joes that they had ever eaten. Didn't change a thing!

I made this to serve 80 kids at summer school camp.  It was super.  The ones who said they did not like sloppy joes asked for seconds.  I used ground chuck and there was no fat to drain.  I will scale the recipe down and keep it for my family's meals.

I have never made sloppy joes from scratch. These were great! I didn't put the brown sugar in it, and I added some hot bbq sauce for a little kick. My family loved it!

The only change I made was to add 1 cup chopped onion, instead of 1/2 cup. Otherwise I made as is. They were very  good. Next time, I'll add chopped garlic, and something to give it someheat, perhaps some chilie sauce or flaked red pepper flakes. Its a very good recipe- my hubby liked it too, even had a second, and he always has said he doesn't like sloppy joes!

this was easy to make and delish! it definetly was neat not like your classic messy sloppy joes but still had the exact same taste. i followed the recipe exactly and the only thing i did different was adding some fresh ground pepper. i think a little more flavour would be good but it was just great the way it was so i did not add anything :)

Great recipe.  I lost my old one and found its replacement!  All I changed was adding a Tbs. of prepared mustard to add a little zing...which is what we were used to.

Very good flavor--certainly better than the store bought stuff!  I followed another reviewer and replaced ketchup w/BBQ sauce & cut back on the sugar.  Will definitely make these again.

These are very easy, and pretty good.  I didn't have canned tomato soup, and I used spaghetti sauce, but it was watery and not very tomatoe-y (it had been frozen, and it thaws out that way), so I added a can of drained chopped tomatoes and then let the mix simmer for about 10-15 minutes to let the tomatoes break down.  worked pretty well, and these are a nice, flavorful sloppy joe.  I served on toast with melted cheese.  Thanks for the recipe.

Excellent dish. I omitted the vinegar and used liquid smoke instead. Instead of the soup and ketchup I used some tomato paste. I also started the celery and onion in the pan and softened it, then added the ground beef. We like the crunchier browned bits. This was very simple and took about 20 minutes. Next time I will add more veggies to make it healthier...maybe carrots and green peppers. Big hit with the toddler.

I've gotta say that I was not impressed. My grandma's recipe is nothing more that Chicken gumbo soup and some catsup and mustard and I still like it a bit better. This wasn't BAD, but I won't be making it again.

Great recipe, but a little too sweet. Next time will omit the brown sugar altogether. As another reviewer said, the sugar in the ketchup and soup would be enough.  It gets better with slow simmering as well...at least 25 min simmering helps blend the flavors and makes the beef so much more tender. I also threw in finely chopped green and red pepper, and sprinkled shredded mozzarella over the hot meat mixture in the buns when serving.   Absolutely delicious with yam fries dipped in campfire sauce (as in Red Robin's, 1/2 c mayo mixed with 3 tblsp Bulls Eye barbeque sauce).

We absolutely LOVE this recipe!!  Don't be turned off by the celery in the recipe - it blends in and you hardly even taste it.  I have made this in a skillet and ate it right away and I have also made it in a skillet and then put it in a crockpot to simmer on low while we were gone for a few hours.  Delicious!

This was wonderful.  I didn't have worchester sauce, so I used A-1 as a substitute.  I also added a handful of plain rice to the recipe as I let it simmer.

This was the best sloppy joe recipe I have tried in years!!!  It was the right combination of sweetness and savory.  I followed the recipe almost perfectly except I used fresh garlic and sauteed the celery, onion and garlic with the hamburg to save time.  Thank you so much for sharing!

I used extra lean ground beef, kept the onions and celery and added 1/2 a green pepper. Instead of the garlic powder I minced 1 clove of garlic and added it in with the veggies, and I reduced the brown sugar to 1 tablespoon (it would have been too sweet with the full amount). Nice quick meal, and my 2 year old was fine with all the veggies.

Loved it!  Could have eaten the whole pan without the buns.  Didn't have any celery but didn't seem to matter. If you don't like it sweet than make something like BBQ beef.  All Sloppy Joe recipes I have tried have been on the sweet side.

I don't think I would call this neat (you should see my kids' clothing) but it sure is good. I used ground chicken, and instead of canned soup used 5 ounces of tomato paste and 5 ounces of water. I served it on buns and the kids gobbled it up.

Not a fan of sloppy joes, but I thought I'd try this out seeing it is a bit different than the regular.  I used a 15 oz can of tomato sauce instead of the ketchup and I think that made a real difference for the better in taste!  Will use again!

These were ok.  I like a different sloppy joe recipe better.  It was a little sweet and not enought bbq flavor so I added a little liquid smoke.  My husband thought it tasted too much like ketchup.

Aunt Mamie has a real winner. No more canned stuff for me. I used ground chuck and mixed color peppers. I didn't have celery on hand. I made 4 pounds worth! Very colorful and wonderful on the palate.

I have made this recipe 3 times now, and it just tastes better every time.  We are having a yard sale this weekend, and i'm making a huge pot of this and throwing it in a slow cooker to stay warm!  Yummy!!  I have heard nothing but great things from my family about this recipe!!

My husband normally hates sloppy joes because they are messy, but he loved these.  They really are neat.  It was really easy to make and I already had everything in the pantry.

Excellent!  It is sweet, but aren't sloppy joes supposed to be sweet?  The only change I made was to do 1/2 cup of celery and 1/2 cup green pepper.  My 3 year old and 15 month old gobbled them um, saying, "mmmmm...mmmmm...mmm."

Both my husband and I thought these were really good sloppy joes.  They were a little sweet for my taste, so next time I'll use a little less brown sugar.  Other than that I won't change a thing.

Super yummy sloppy joes. I read the reviews first and tweaked the recipe a bit.I took my handy mini chop and chopped all the veggies and 1/2 a cup of red bell pepper and minced garlic (about 2 tsp.),then added only 1/8 cup brown sugar,1 tsp. of liquid smoke and 2 Tbls. of honey hickory bbq, I also used cider vinegar in place of white and no garlic powder. Everything else was the same. These were absolutly delis. I would have rated them a 5 star except for all the tweaking!:)

Wow!! Great recipe; sure beats canned sloppy joe mix. Had just enough left over to make one sandwich. Though recipe is a keeper, I rated it as a 4 because I left out the celery (family likes it, but brother cannot eat it). Instead of using 2 lbs 73% lean ground beef, I discovered I thawed only 1 lb. Therefore, had to change a few things around. Cut ingredients in half with exception of using same amount of tomato soup, ketchup (watered down 'cause I ran short) and brown sugar. Since I made it two hours ahead of time, I did as one reviewer suggested - kept mixture warmed in crockpot before serving. Thanks for sharing this with viewers.

Wow, excellent recipe.  I did use the 98% fat free low sodium tomato soup but otherwise followed the recipe.  Next time I will 1/2 the brown sugar as we found it a little too sweet.  Maybe add just a squeeze of fresh mustard too.

These are some seriously yummy sloppy joes. I did add a dash of hot sauce to liven it up a bit. I cut the ground beef down to only 1 lb, and also halved all other ingredients except the tomato soup (why waste half a can?). Sprinkled the meat with celery seed and onion powder as it cooked, left out the onion, and added one chopped garlic clove. Loved it and so did hubby. thank you!

Making the recipe exactly as described, I thought it tasted mostly like tomato soup.  Something was missing, so I added more worchestire sauce and a little bit of bbq sauce, and it was pretty good.

This was good,very good tasting. I may have differed a little because I didn't have any tomato soup,so I used pizza sauce,I did everything else the same tho.I toasted my bread buns a little to much so I'll try not to do that tommorow when I have leftovers at lunch. Enjoy having this tasty little meal.

This has become such a regular item in our house, that I no longer need to look at the recipe.  Kids love it.  My husband and I spice it up with some Tony Chatchery's seasoning.  Cheddar cheese is also good on them.

These were very good but did lack a certain "wow" factor... haven't figured it out yet.  I will probably stick with the basic recipe and adjust it a little more next time.  I was missing "zip," and couldn't figure out how to add it.  I upped the vinegar just a bit and added a squeeze of mustard, but somehow that didn't quite do it.  I ended up adding some bbq sauce, which made this delicious, but I was wanting regular sloppy joes, not bbq sloppy joes.  Anyhow, hubby loved them and that's the important thing!  My only changes were to use ground turkey instead of beef and some tiny chopped cooked carrot and celery seed instead of celery.  We didn't have any celery on hand and don't particularly care for it.  We did go ahead and add green pepper b/c we have no green pepper haters in this house. :)  Overall, a yummy quick dinner!

Very easy and since it can be made ahead it's even better!  Like other people I tweaked the basic recipe a bit and my children loved them (so much my son wanted the last leftover bit for breakfast).  Used equal amounts of celery (chopped very fine) and onion plus a bit more vinegar (I like them pretty tangy).  We currently live in the UK so the canned tomato soup over here is much sweeter than what is typical in the US so didn't need quite as much brown sugar but that's a taste and see kind of personal preference thing.   Served with a chilled pasta salad and some crisp veggies and we had a nice summer meal. Definitely a keeper for my cookbook.

This turned out so well. I have a 7 yr old that doesn't like onions so I omitted the onions and just used onion powder.

This recipe for sloppy joes was fine although I didn't feel it was outstanding from any other sloppy joe recipe I have used. I did chop onion and garlic in my mini chopper and sauteed it along with the meat just for the time saver.  I also reduced the brown sugar by half because we just aren't fans of sweet sandwich mixes.  I will make this as a potluck item due to its simplicity and the fact that the ingredients are easily on hand.

Fantastic!  Much better than the canned stuff which is way too ovrepowering.  This was just right and left you wanting more.  My husband loved them as did my two small children.  This will become a regular in our schedule.

Great flavor! I made this with lentils: I sauteed the onion and some garlic, then added 1c lentils and 2c veg broth and simmered till the liquid was gone, about 35 min. Then I lightly mashed the lentils and added the remaining ingredients (except the celery--not a fan). Instead of tomato soup, I pureed two tomatoes with some tomato paste and salt. It came out great! I'll definitely make this again.

Dang good -- I did find the amount of sauce a little "tight" for 2lbs of meat, but that's probably the point of the "neat" part of the title.  I added more BBQ sauce and used it as the base of a tater tot casserole, kind of a kid-friendly shephard's pie.  Just pile the Joes in a sprayed baking dish, line up tots skinny ends about halfway down into the meat mixture, bake at 350 until tots are done and dish is bubbling.  Kids scarfed it...

Terrific recipe!  I added small-chopped green pepper (we like it!) and took other reviewers' recommendations by adding a dash of liquid smoke.  The guys LOVED 'em!  Thanks for the keeper of a recipe  :-)

This was great at dinner tonight.  I did add some to it.  Earlier today I cut up the onion, celery, plus a green pepper.  I added pepper and garlic power, did a quick stir, and then put it in the fridge for a few hours.  I used my electric skillet and browned the meat, then added the veggies, drained then added the other ingredients as stated.  Seemed like it was still missing something for me, so I added some homemade bbq sauce, and also a can of rotel (drained).  It gave it a bit of kick that I was looking for.  We really enjoyed this.  Was so quick and simple to make.  I served on jumbo sandwich buns with french fries.  This will be added to recipe box.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

I usually faithfully follow a different sloppy joe recipe that is my stepkids' absolute favorite. Tonight in a pinch I didn't have the ingredients for the other recipe on hand, but did have the ingredients for this, so we gave it a try. They loved it even more than the other recipe, which has been their tried-and-true favorite for a long time! They all said they like this one much better, although I found it to be a tad too much on the sweet side. Skipped the celery but otherwise followed to a tee. Next time I will decrease the brown sugar by a touch, but we will definitely be using this one from now on! Thanks for the great recipe!

I used one pound of venison, and one pound of ground beef. Other than that I did not change a thing.  All the cowboys in the house loved it!  It's a keeper. Thanks!

I do volunteer cooking for anywhere from 200-360 people for lunches. I have served this Sloppy Joe recipe and the people just rave about it. Many are very disappointed when I change the menu and have something else instead. I would highly recommend this recipe for large or small groups.

This recipe is very flexible - I've done it on the stove or dumped it all in the crockpot for a couple hours after browning the meat. You can leave out  the celery and replace the onion with dried chopped onion  or powder  if you're short on time. Or you can add diced bell pepper. Also,cider vinegar works if you prefer it. I usually go a bit heavier on the vinegars and spices, add black pepper and a good shot bbq sauce. We love to have sweet potato fries with it too!

Awesome! These were absolutely wonderful as written. I used the food processor to finely chop the celery and onion so the kids didn't grumble. They absolutely added to the flavor. You will not regret trying this recipe.

These were really good as written.  My 11 yr old won't touch the one in the can, but liked these.  (they taste very similair to me, but must be missing the canned one's offending ingredient - green pepper per chance?).

This was a very good sloppy joe recipe. I've been looking for one like this for awhile. I wanted a sweet sloppy joe, but not too much so.  This fit the bill. The only thing I left out was the chopped celery.  Will make this a keeper at my house.

This is a sweeter version, I followed the recipe and found it needed "something" so I added a couple tablespoons of prepared mustard and that gave it the zing I was looking for.  Overall a good recipe.

this is a pretty good recipe, my family loved it.  However, I thought it was a little too sweet.  I would probably cut it back a bit, and I think it needs a small amount of onion or garlic.

I LOVED this! So did my family includint my extremely picky 4 y/o. I did change a few things around, I did add bell peppers and I didn't have tomato soup so I increased the wet ingredients (mainly the worschestshire sauce) to compensate for it. It was very good.

I didn't change anything in this recipe.  I did leave out the celery, it just didn't seem like any kind of a sloppy joe that I'd ever had.  Would have maybe changed to green bell pepper, but didn't have one. This recipe is a keeper. Karla

I didn't have celery so I added celery seed, lots of minced garlic a splash of liquid smoke a squirt of mustard some BBQ seasoning and doubled the worcestershire. I was really leary about the tomato soup but this is the best sloopy Joes I have ever had. Thanks for the recipies.

This is the best sloppy joe recipe I have tasted.  I read others reviews and just tweaked the recipe a little.  I browned the beef with 2 cloves minced garlic and drained the excess grease.  I switched the celery and onion portions around (I thought this would be a better ratio) and I sauteed them together.  Then, I combined them with the meat.  I followed all other ingredients listed but took the comments from others and added the BBQ sauce and a touch of liquid smoke.  I took hamburger buns and spread softened butter on them and sprinkled garlic powder on them, put them in the toaster oven to slightly warm.  I added a little shredded colby jack cheese when I made the sandwiches.  My family loved these!

My son NEVER ate sloppy joes, but I made him try this and he LOVES it, so do all of us.  I grew up on a very different recipe, but I converted.  The only change I made, was no celery and added corn, my kids absoluety love it, at the end of dinner is all smiles.  Thanks for the great recipe, it will be a regular at our house.

It was very, very good! I used a teensy bit less brown sugar, since people suggested it was sweet enough, and it turned out great! This is definately going to be a repeat meal for my husband and I!

Pretty tasty, but a little too sweet for our taste. I will use it again, but probably leave out the brown sugar since the ketchup and soup both already have sugar in them. Very quick easy lunch though and we had all the ingredients on hand.

These were waaayyy tooo sweet!  I didn't make them for kids just my husband and we felt like we were eating dessert. He normally likes the canned version, so I don't know if that had anything to do with his dislike.  I never eat sloppy joes and this recipe didn't make me a fan.  I'd definitely cut down the sugar if I were to ever make this again.

my picky kids were VERY upset that i was not using the usual can.. however, they actually helped make this, and have asked for it twice since..  they love it, and trust me, if my kids like it, it is good...  nice and sweet.  i ate it too, although i had it on a wheat bun.

OH SO GOOD!!!  I will never use premade sloppy joe mixes again.  This recipe is that good.  I used half ground beef and half ground turkey for a great combination.  I also made it up early in the day and then let it sit on low in the slow cooker so dinner was ready when hubby got home.  My whole family of picky eaters loved it.

Hmmm... I just didn't care for these very much. I did not like the celery it calls for at all. And, I found the sauce to be on the bland side. As well as being too sweet. Not robust and tangy as it should be. I will continue my search for the perfect sloppy joe. For my family, that is! :)

Wow! I prepared this for my husband and daughter and my picky 5 year old absolutely loved it. For once in a long time she ate everything off her plate. My husband who has had never been a fan of sloppy joe's kept telling me how good he thought they were. Thanks! Excellent Recipe!

I served these to all my extended family.  For the most part they all loved them.  The only comments I got was that they were a little too dry for "sloppy Joe's".  But that's why they're called Neat!

I came across this when I was ready to add "the can" of sauce and realized I didn't have one.  My husband loved it and now asks me to make it instead of buying the sauce.  The only thing I changed was not adding the celery.  We don't like celery.  Great recipe!

This is the recipe we have been using since I was a kid. I use a couple of cloves of garlic, skip the salt and brown sugar. I always serve it open face on toast or toasted buns. Sometimes put a slice of American Cheese on top for the kids.

Even though this was very good, I personally prefer a little heat in my food.  The next time I make this, I may add some hot sauce but overall this was very good and will be making this quite often.

First, I followed the recipe exactly, except that I added fresh garlic.  I was not at all impressed with the flavor.  I had to add nearly a jar of Bennetts Chili sauce, and bunch of other spices to get a more flavorful sloppy joe.  Obviously a lot of people like this, but it wasn't for me.

Here's what I did, didn't use celery(had mone), and sliced 1/2 cup of sweet onion over the top. I also used hamburger and italian patties. WOW! this recipe was so good, and a big hit with my family. Tasted even better the next day. I'm planning to try this with chicken breast!

A very easy recipe and I had most ingredients on hand. I used ground turkey instead of beef and increased the onion in place of the celery. I also used fresh garlic instead of powder. A quick and tasty dinner!

Absolutely wonderful!  I wouldn't change the recipe a bit. My preschool kids like it too. To make things quicker, I added frozen chopped onions so that I didnt have to chop my own.

Yummy!  I didn't have any tomato soup on hand so I used some tomato paste and I added about a tablespoon of fresh horseradish for a little zing.  Husband raved!

I liked the recipe, but my husband said it was too sweet.  My four year old ate 3 helpings!! The only change I made was to add cheese and eat it with a Jalapeno since I like very spicy.

These were good, but I felt like they were missing something. If I use the recipe again, I would use double the onions, half the celery and add some garlic. The condensed tomato soup works well. We had them on toasted buns with spicy monterey jack cheese.

It really is a neat sloppy Joe recipe.  I made when my hubby had a broken arm (yeah i didn't really think it through).  To both of our amazement it wasn't messy at all.  I leave out the celery and onion b/c my hubby has a thing against their texture.  Still came out very yummy!!!  Great family recipe or adult version of meal you loved as a kid.

These were great, too much brown sugar for our liking though so next time I  will cut that way down.  A good starter recipe - I'm going to do a little tweaking to fit my tastes but the basics are excellent.  Thanks.

Amazing! I made these for my boyfriend who just loves them. The celery and brown sugar gives it a sweet taste that is to die for. Only thing I did different was I used garlic cloves instead of garlic powder.

This was so good!  I made it in the crockpot. It wasn't very thick though, maybe from the crockpot, not sure but will make again and again. So much better then using the envelope and adding tomato paste to it.

The best homemade sloppy joe recipe EVER.  I left out the celery (only because I didn't have any), but don't think we missed it.  Definitely a wonderful flavor, and will become MY sloppy joe recipe.  Thanks for the recipe!!!

Excellent!  Very tasty.  Added a bit of cayenne pepper to give it a kick and used green pepper instead of celery.  Next time I will use half ground turkey as another review suggested.

Yum!!!  I use to make another sloppy joeo recipe which me and my DH LOVED but the kids wouldn't touch with a ten foot pole. The kids LOVED this recipe. I left out the celery and onions but did ad a 1/2 tsp onion powder. I also took one reviewers changes and used 1/2 ground turkey and whole wheat buns for a healthier version. This goes into my rotation!

It's been since I was in grammar school that I had sloppy joes and it's a meal that I had long forgotten about until a dear friend recently mentioned it.  I had some tomato sauce left over from another project that essentially had the same spices in it.  I omitted the ketchup and tomato soup, but otherwise pretty much followed the recipe, if not to the letter at least in spirit!  Boyfriend thought these were great, and I agree. This is a meal that we will certainly have again!  Thank you for taking the time to submit this recipe; it's very good!

Tasty, fast & easy! Halved recipe and made with ground bison, full can of soup, a little extra Worcestershire and substituted hot & spicy catsup for 1/2 catsup. My husband, who hates onions, liked it. Great for kids, my toddler loved it. Next time I think I will stick completely with the hot & spicy catsup. And thanks for the potato masher tip, that's a keeper! **UPDATE** I've made this with ground bison, beef, turkey, and venison; all turned out great (turkey is my favorite). I substitute hot & spicy ketchup whenever I have it and add 1 tsp minced garlic. I'll never use canned sauce again.

This one is a keeper but I did leave out the celery (personal preference). Easy to put together and can stay in a crock pot on low all afternoon so you have a meal ready for a crowd, even if you've been out all day. Depending on the heat of your crock pot you may need to stir in a bit more tomato soup or tomato sauce before serving.

We've made this several times, and each time is better and better!  I like that it's neat, so I can put it in between two buns and serve it to my kids like a burger!

Just a note, when cutting the recipe in half, I find that I still need the whole can of tomato soup.

We serve this on toasted garlic buns...so yummy!!

Delish!  I make a giant batch of this every year about 2 weeks before Christmas, then freeze in meal-size portions.  When the holidays come, there's always something tasty and home-cooked available to eat.

Pretty good - It doesn't say how much to chop up the celery and I left it a little too big. I would dice up the celery instead of just a reg. slices.  My hubby, who only likes one sloppy joe recipe (his mothers), enjoyed them; so I will make it again.

I made this for an open house for 50+ people.  Everyone loved them.  Even people who said they normally don't like sloppy joes raved about them.  I made them and then put in the slow cooker and had out on the buffet.

These were just OK for me. I followed the recipe exactly, except left out the celery. The sauce tasted like BBQ sauce and was too sweet and overpowering. I'll stick with my regular recipe.

These were a hit.  My husband grew up on processed food, and until now, his favorite sloppy joes were the ones made from the mix.  He said these were the best sloppy joes he ever tasted.  I used dehydrated onions and celery seed to make it more kid friendly.  It was a fast meal and the kids loved it.

Very good!! Much better than storebought. I add chopped bell pepper along with onion and celery, and saute them first. Even hubby raved, and he's not to fond of the canned sauce :)

Loved it! So delicious! After I cooked the beef, onions and celery, I threw them it my crock pot with the rest of the ingredients, and cooked it on "High" for 2 hours so I could work on some other stuff I needed to get done. It turned out a little bit saucier, not quite as neat, but I think if I had cooked it in the saucepan it would have cooked some of the liquid off. So no complaints, and this is my new standard sloppy joe recipe, both in a saucepan or crock pot, so good!

These were delicious. The only negative is they were a bit too wet - I like them a bit neater. Overall, I would make these again; my son liked it too which is unusual since he is very picky.

This was okay I guess, as they were neat and easy enough to make, but I have two complaints:
1. These things were ridiculously sweet. I followed the instructions, but I found them to be too sweet.
2. They tasted like ketchup. Sweet ketchup. 
The only reason I'm not rating it lower is that my family seemed to like them enough, but they didn't taste like the Sloppy Joes I'm used to.

One of the better sloppy joe recipes I've tried.  My kids don't like "stuff" in their joes so I ground up the onion and celery in a food processor.  The taste and texture were great and seconds were requested all around.  Thanks for a keeper!

Wonderful! I made this  with Yves' "The Good Ground" vegetarian soy crumbles instead of meat. It was delicious and healthy! What a fun treat. I sauteed the onions and celery in a tablespoon of olive oil until soft, then added the  soy crumbles, then followed the rest of the recipe as directed. Tasted GREAT -- especially on onion buns. Yum!

This was really good !! i've never made sloppy joe & YES it was better than the canned stuff.  i had to substitute condensed for the real deal(a progresso ready to use tomato soup) so it was a not so "neat" but it was really good.  Very nummy.  Think i will omit the onions & celery next time b/c no matter how small i thought i diced them my little kiddos picked them out.

My husband and I are currently in Eastern Europe, so we can't really find Sloppy Joes over here.  These were even better than we remembered!  Thanks!

FINALLY!  A recipe that has my family buzzing about how I will never buy joes from a can again!  Thank you!  I did make a few adjustments according to our taste buds:  Ground turkey, tomato sauce, bell pepper instead of celery, no vinegar, and an 1/8 cup of brown sugar instead of a 1/4.  Thank you!!

These were just ok for me.  They need something but I really can't pinpoint what it is.  I've had much better sloppy joes and I probably won't make these again.

We loved this recipe!  It saved us a trip to the store tonight for the "store bought" mix or can, and we won't make THAT trip ever again!  The whole family loved them!  The only substitute that we made was for the tomato soup, we used a can of tomato sauce as someone else suggested.  They didn't turn out very "neat" but a simple fork fixed that!!!  Definately a keeper and thank you for the recipe!

Very good!  I made them with tomato sauce instead of soup and they turned out just perfect!  My husband said he likes them better than my "usual" ones.  That is a huge compliment - he really likes the "usual".
Thanks for a good, solid recipe!

A++++
I recently moved overseas and the stores here don't carry sloppy joe mixes. It was my husbands first time trying them and they're a hit. I used a touch less brown sugar and it was just sweet enough.

Pretty good for sloppy joes!! Even my pickiest eater had 2nds. I made this with only 1 lb. of ground beef, no celery & kept true to the rest of the ingredients & it was just the right consistency for us. I can see how this would be dry w/ 2 lbs of meat. I will use this again the next time I make sloppy joes.

I made a double batch of these for a big group camping trip and they were a hit.  I hate the canned stuff and this was a big improvement over that!  The only changes I made were (1) I cut back on the sugar per previous reviewers and (2) used tomato sauce instead of tomato soup because that's what I had on hand.  Everybody really liked these and I would definitely make them again.

My family really did like this and I also reduced the brown sugar by 1/2 and found it plenty sweet. I also eliminated the celery.  Usually Sloopy Joe's (Manwich) don't sit well in my stomach; I had no problems with this recipe.

This was the first time I've cooked sloppy Joes, and probably only the 2nd time I've ever eaten them, so I don't have alot to go on. My husband said that compared to the "normal manwich" ones, it's alot more mild and not as sausy. I think it has too much sugar, so I added more Worstishire, katchup and salt to try and counter act all that brown sugar. Over all we got double thumbs up from the whole family. This is a great kid recipe.

Very nice and neat!  Made it last night for two families with kids and didn't have too much clean up.  I enjoy more tomato flavor so I added a small can of Hunt's tomato sauce.  Fantastic!  Thanks for sharing!  I'll keep this one!

This was delicious! It has just the right amount of brown sugar to make it sweet. Only thing I didn't different was I left out the celery because I didn't have any on hand. It still came out GREAT! Will be adding this to the recipe box.

these were FANTASTIC, so much better then Manwich. I like them saucy though so I only used half the amount of meat and in my opinion they were perfect!

This turned out great.  I didn't have tomato soup so I used tomato sauce.  I also used ground turkey and threw in some shredded carrots.  Definitely better than that canned stuff and I always have these ingredients on hand.

This is a Wonderful recipe.  I have never made home made sloppy Joes.  This is excellent.  I like them much better then the stuff from the can.  It isn't hard to make either it only takes a little longer then doing it the other way.  GREAT RECIPE

I was disappointed in this one.  Due to all the praises it received I was expecting a lot out of it.  My children did not like nor did my husband.  So I ended up having a lot of leftovers that no one but myself would eat.  Overall it was not bad nor wonderful,  just okay.

Wow!  My family loves this recipe!  I add a dash of hot sauce and have made it with ground turkey and it was great!
My picky eaters eat every last bite.

This was a huge hit with my family.  I also used tomato sauce as some of the other reviewers suggested and also threw in some bbq sauce and A1 sauce.  It's hard to goof this up throw in some of this and some of that and it's perfect every time.

My husband absolutely loves this recipe.  I'm making it for the second time in one month tonite.  I too changed the soup to sauce,  and didn't add sugar.  I added Adobo, instead of the salt.  Adobo is a seasoning, Latino's use on everything but desserts.  Thanks for the recipe Aunt Mamie!!

Very good.  The only change I made was the amount of sugar per other reviews.  I used 1 tbsp but would up it to two next time.  My youngest really liked along with the rest of us.  Thanks

Once I made a few adjustments this was great.  I read the reviews before making this, and decided to leave the sugar out, and added more Worcestershire sauce and some A-1.  It turned out great in the end.

Awesome sloppy joes.  My 4 yr. old won't eat the canned version, but she loves these and calls them "Krabby Patties"...a little too much spongebob I guess, but oh well.  I use tomato sauce in place of the soup and cut back on the brown sugar a little.  Add a little more garlic powder than called for.  We love these for a quick, easy meal that we ALL enjoy!

This was easy and pretty good - I gave it 4 stars only because, like other reviewers, we found it to be too sweet. I liked it sweet but my husband didn't so I'd probably omit the sugar all together or at least take it down to 1 Tbsp. I had to substitute a can of tomato paste because I don't use condensed soups so I didn't have any on hand but that was fine, it made it thicker. I'll keep this in the rotation - nice change from burgers!

Very simple to make. My family loved it. I tasted without the brown sugar and liked it much better. Just to sweet for me. But everyone like it with it. I also added some stewed tomatoes with celery, onions, and green peppers in it. Much better. I will keep this recipe in my kitchen. Thanks

These were much better than going to the store and buy the pre-made sloppy joe mixes, but they were a little bit too sweet for my taste.  I can see why kids would like them so much.  I will definitely make these again but cut down on the amount of brown sugar I put in them.

Made this for the first time tonight and hub and I agreed that these were the best sloppy joes we've ever had! Normally, I will make a recipe exactly as written the first time then start changing it the next, but there is nothing I would change with this one. I do recommend adding a slice of american cheese to the sandwich, though. This is comfort food at its best!

Awesome recipe!  The kids didn't even complain about the onions and celery!  I made this exactly as the recipe stated and it was a hit.  I fed them to 3 Kindergarteners and 2 pre-schoolers and not one of them complained!!

This was an awesome recipe!  I did not add the celery or onion as my kids don't like their hot food to crunch, but I used dry onion for the flavor (they can't see it!).  It was fabulous.  I let it cook on low for a while to blend the flavors and it was excellent.  Best sloppy joes I've ever made or had!

This is great!  My husband and I both thought it was good.  I didn't think it was overly sweet-just the right touch.  I substituted canned mushrooms for celery & added more onion.  I also added some cayenne pepper for a kick.  I've copied this to a recipe card & it's now my official sloppy joe recipe!

Well, I wouldn't say these were the best I've had, but definitely an improvement over store-bought cans or packets. I will make it again, just maybe modify it a bit.

Made this recipe tonight and it was excellent. I didn't put the full amount of brown sugar and didn't have any celery but added a little mustard. I also used apple cider vinegar instead of the white vinegar. This is one of those recipes that you can add or subtract ingredients to make it to your liking and it still tastes great! This recipe is definitely a keeper! Thanks!

I found this recipe to be pretty good, nothing fabulous (I added a little bit of red pepper to "kick it up a notch" so to speak), but the boyfriend LOVED it so I gotta give it 5 stars.

I was not happy with recipe at all.  I should have listened to several of the reviews already made of this recipe.  I did cut way down on the amount of brown sugar as was suggested; I was very glad I did because it was still almost too sweet.  It also had no flavor, I added more of some ingredients and added some ingredients of my choice and it became edible.  I will not use this recipe again.

I normally use a package mix to make Sloppy Joe's, but I was out, so I decided to try this.  Loved It. I did leave out the celery, still excellent, will never use a mix again.  Thank You.
