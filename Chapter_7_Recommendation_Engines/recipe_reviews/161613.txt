The best thing about these enchiladas is the sauce. So tangy and delicious. Fresh tomatillos are so yummy. It did take longer to make than the recipe stated, though, so budget a extra half hour.

This was wonderful - my husband normally dislikes cilantro, but he loved these enchiladas.  The only change I made was that I did not have tomatillos, so I left them out--scrumptious.

Awesome!...  Like another reviewer, I also used tomatillos from a jar... Added my chicken broth and cream... Everyone loved it and I really thought these were restaurant quality.  I seasoned the shrimp and spinach with a little salt, pepper, Old Bay and cayenne.  Hubby said that's a keeper recipe! :)

Loved this recipe! For the sauce, I got a big thing of tomatillos salsa from Costco. Heated two cups of that, then added the cream and chicken broth as the recipes calls for. Saved soooo much time. Also, added mushrooms to the filling. Only ended up using about half the cheese. Easy but a little time intensive. Worth it though. Yum yum yum.

The sauce of this is wonderful - kids and hubby loved it.   As a time/cost saver I used canned Embasa brand salsa verde, which is tomatillos and jalapenos.  Did not have time to run to the store for fresh cilantro so I just added coriander.  Next time I'll add fresh, but this worked and was delicisious.  This took only about 20 minutes to whip up.

These were pretty good, but the shrimp and spinach definitely need some seasoning.  I added salt, pepper, and a little cumin to them.  My tortillas were a little old and dry, so I just made this into a casserole instead of individual enchiladas.  The sauce was pretty thin, so I thickened it up a little with some MaSeCa flour.  I've never had shrimp enchiladas before, so this was a nice treat.  I'm sure we'll have these again sometime soon.

This is really good!  I love the chunky veggies with the cheese and shrimp.  I added a little extra spinach because I had it and love it.  I cant wait to try the leftovers for lunch!

Made this for dinner, the salsa recipe is awesome, I followed the recipe exactly or else I wouldn't review it, the only thing I don't understand is the spinach, why?? no other enchilada recipe (beef or chicken) that I know of uses it. I will make this again but will reduce the sauce more and probably skip the spinach, I actually have ingredients left over and I think I'll make a batch just for chips, so good

This tasted fine but it didn't look very appetizing on the plate. It did not look like enchiladas but more of a casserole. Again, tasted fine but was disappointing for all of the money and hard work that went into it. Also, it takes WAY longer to prepare than stated so keep that in mind if you make it.

This was so Yummy!  I did add some cumin and garlic powder to the shrimp and spinach mixture.  The sauce was divine and it was just the right amount.

Delicious sauce - delicious! Too much spinach in the filling. 

Unrelated to my score, don't swap chicken for shrimp...I didnt care for the taste, but that was my choice.

I substituted making the sauce for just a couple of cans of salsa verde and it was still really good.

I am not sure whether my review should even really count, since I made a number of changes.  I didn't have tomatillos, so my sauce turned out really, really runny...not like a cream sauce at all.  However, I was able to salvage it by mixing it with sour cream - roughly equal parts sauce and sour cream.  It was fabulous and spread really nicely on the enchiladas at the end!  I also used whole wheat flour tortillas and subbed frozen prawns for the salad shrimp...they just sounded better, and were what I had on hand.  And with the spinach and shrimp I added in some diced bell pepper and 2 fresh tomatoes.  I don't think the pepper helped, but the tomatoes were nice in it.  I think some black beans would be a really good addition too, so I may try that next time.  I also added a dash of red pepper flakes and some salt and pepper to the filling - it was too blah without it.  I also thought the cheese was a little too rich for this dish, so next time I am going to go really light on it, or choose a more mild cheese.  All in all though, these were fabulous and my son and husband both requested I make them again.  Yum!!

This is a great recipe. I have always used the shortcut of using salsa verde from a can and turns out great. Someday I will do the full version but substituting the salsa verde for the jalapeno peppers, tomatillos, onions, chicken broth and cilantro still turns out great.

Delicious! However, I did end up with way to much sauce. I would probably cut the sauce recipe in half the next time.

I thought this was just ok.  Sauce was bland and didn't thicken.  Ended up adding cumin, red pepper, garlic salt\powder.  Shimp needed some flavoring too.

I made these with chicken and flour tortillas and they were delicious.  I had to make some substitutions because of what I had on hand.  I didn't have any tomatillos so I just used some prepared salsa - a mix of deli salsa and Pace.  I poached the chicken in water, then shredded it.  I didn't have any cilantro either but of course there's some in the salsa.  I used low-sodium broth and light sour cream (but real heavy cream!).  I softened the tortillas in the microwave (about 10 seconds for 3 - I made a half a recipe) so no oil required.  I will definitely be making these again.  I'm sure the shrimp and tomatillo version is excellent too.

Delicious. I used jarred salsa verde and added cabbage with the spinach. I did not fry my tortillas in oil (I used flour) I just charred them on the stove.

Wonderful sauce!  I made mine with chicken (minus the spinach), added minced garlic and used canned, crushed tomatillos instead of fresh (because I couldn't find any).

This recipe was awesome. I followed this recipe but took out cilantro because my Mom doesn't like it. It was spicy which I like. You can adjust the spice by either lowering the amount of jalapenos or taking out seeds and membranes which I did. It was a hit.  Mom had seconds.

The flavors were there in the sauce, but mine was runny and looked really weird since the ingredients weren't cooked down or pureed.  I have a much better recipe for the sauce that I use for chicken enchiladas.  The shrimp was good.

I have made this recipe repeatedly over quite a few years.  I decided it was finally time to rate it and give it the credit it deserves.  In 2009, I wrote the following comment on a printout of the recipe - "Yowza!" (This is better than great, in case you were wondering.  lol )  I sometimes make a few changes depending on what ingredients I have on hand; instead of salad shrimp, I might use larger shrimp and cut them up a bit, or I might use half-and-half if I don't have heavy cream.  It always comes out great.

A very different, tasty, and welcome alternative to the usual red sauce enchiladas.  I followed the directions pretty close but added a bit more shrimp and cheese. No green sauce either so drizzled some Sriracha on top while cooking (mostly for a splash of color).  We will definitely be adding this recipe to our mainstay dinners.

Turned out great. I added a little chipotle sauce in the shrimp mixture.

This was amazing! It will become a staple meal in my household. I made some modifications to turn it into a vegan dish. I puréed tofu to a similar consistency as ricotta then sautéed it with mushrooms, zucchini, and spinach for the filling. Substituted the heavy cream with almond milk and a corn starch thickener, and used vegetable broth. Skip the cheese or use vegan cheese. Outstanding!

Great flavor but not enough heat for me. Had a sweet taste due to the cream I'm sure. Not quite to my liking.

Tasty. Made a few substitutions due to what I had handy.
Used 1/2 can green chills, a bit of chipotle chili spice and a bit if Fiesta seasonong. Skipped the jalapeños.  Used coffee cream instead of heavy cream. Used precooked shrimp but barely warmed it in fry pan (didn't want them overcooked by the time they were done in oven. Skipped the spinach but used roasted red peppers and Fiesta seasoning. Used grated aged white cheddar cheese.

We like shrimp and we like enchiladas.  ...Not a big fan of the two together.

I've made this several times, using large shrimp that I roughly chop and toss with Old Bay, garlic and cayenne before sautéing.   (Tonight I also added bay scallops and slivered onion to the shrimp -yummy.)   The sauce is delicious and rich enough that I prefer using 1/2 & 1/2 instead of heavy cream.    I always buy raw corn tortillas* and grill them for this recipe....definitely worth the effort.  In my opinion, this dish looks (and tastes) better when I roll the fresh warm tortillas around the filling, plate them on a bed of baby spinach, and drape with the sauce instead of baking in a casserole.  Garnish with scallion and cilantro.  
              *I buy uncooked corn tortillas at Walmart in the dairy section next to the queso fresco.

Followed pretty close, just added some garlic and cumin.  Really liked the verde sauce but not the shrimp so much.  Will make the sauce again but maybe simmer it with the some pork.

This is really tasty.  Just use your own judgement if you want to bring the heat up a bit. I added green chilies and jalapeños to the sauce along with some cumin, cayenne pepper, garlic, and more jalapeños to the spinach shrimp mixture.  Thanks for the recipe.

I took all veggies plus garlic and lots of cilantro stems (most flavor here) and tossed them in a little safflower oil and sea salt then  roasted in oven for 30 minutes. this is a great secret to all ethnic foods. Then I put in blender once cooled. I didn't have enough shrimp so I added frozen cod, AMAZING RECIPE! I also didn't have chicken stock so I boiled the shrimp shells and added some chicken buillon and the juice from the roasted veggies.  the tortillas I layered so that I didn't use all that oil to make them flexible, just as delish and less fat.  I will definitely make this over and over.

I loved these enchiladas! I didn't have cooked shrimp or spinach so I used chicken mixed with a little sour cream and fresh cheese and it was perfect.
