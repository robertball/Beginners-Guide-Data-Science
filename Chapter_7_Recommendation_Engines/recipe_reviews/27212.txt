Good job Stehpanie.  I have been looking for an egg custard recipe like this.  It wasn't too sweet. I loved the texture.  Here is a tip when combining a hot liquid to an egg mixture. While stirring very quickly, add some of the egg mixture to the hot milk. Then pour the milk into the egg mixture(keep stirring).  This keeps the eggs from cooking and turning into scrambled eggs.  Personally, I think this dessert is best served completely cold. Next time I might try adding a little almond extract to see how that turns out.

I whipped this up last night as a snack before bed.  I used coconut milk and left out the butter and salt.  I poured this into a greased pie plate (no crust) and baked it at 350 for about an hour.  I stuck it in the freezer for a few minutes afterwards until it was cool enough to eat.  It turned out really good and was quick enough that I'd make it again.

I have not made this recipe yet, but just a tip when working with eggs and any hot liquid you must always temper your eggs.Just add a bit of the hot liquid and whisk it in then slowly add the rest of the hot liquid this will stop you from getting the scrambled egg taste.

I was looking for a recipe that recreated the egg custard pie of Morrison's cafeteria.  This was a good pie, but not quite how I remember the cafeteria pie--granted, it's been a long time.  I concur with those who note how eggy the pie was. Perhaps its a silly observation as one cannot have custard without eggs, but I'm now looking for a three egg recipe to see how that works. Also, I was uncomfortable with the idea of boiling the milk (and I wasn't sure of the point of boiling it), so I scalded it instead.  I didn't cover the crust because I didn't leave much exposed. I set my time for 30 minutes because the oven wasn't quite heated up when I put the pie in--and I nearly burned the top.  While the top had brown splotches, the flavor was good.

This was okay...too much of an eggy taste.  I tasted scrambled egg all the way.  If you like eggs this is the one to try.

My husband's mother used to make custard pies for him all the time but she passed away before I met him.  I mixed and matched a few recipes I found on here and I liked this one the best.  However, I actually prefer a sweeter pie.  So instead of 2 cups whole milk, I put 1 1/2 cup whole milk and half cup sweetened condensed milk, mixed them together and it was a little thicker and sweeter that way.  Otherwise, great recipe!

This was as close to perfect as any recipe can get.  It is not overly sweet.  So, if you are used to a very sweet custard you'd want to increase the sugar.  I did not get a scrambled egg taste at all.  The crust and the top came out very brown but my oven temperature is off and I may not have set it properly.  I'll watch and make adjustments the next time I bake this pie.  Thanks for a great and simple recipe!

This recipe was easy to follow and easy to make.  When I cut into it I found that the crust had risen to the top of the pie and the custard was on the bottom.  This left the crust moist.  Still enjoyable.  I will try it again.

I am a custard lover and this was just not for me.  It tasted like french toast and did not have that "custard" consistency that I expected.

This recipe is delightful! I added a few dashes of nutmeg for extra flavor. If it turned out "eggy" for some reviewers, maybe adding the hot milk very slowly to the egg mixture will prevent the egg from solidifying (cooking). It doesn't look done when you take it out of the oven, but it immediately "sets" when it cools off a little. My daughter and I just had a warm slice and it was wonderful!

This pie  is impressive.  I liker the fact that it was quick and easy to make.  However my version had a few minor tweaks.  I used one cup of heavy whipping cream and one cup of milk.  I also added a 1 1/2 tablespoons of flou, oh yeah, and a graham cracker crust.....MMmmmm... just right.

This was ok. My sister-in-law made an "egg pie" for a dinner at her house and I was trying to duplicate it. Hers was so delicious!  This pie didn't come close. I'll have to get her recipe and pass it on.

This is so easy and such a delicious pie like my Mother use to make!  I have to cook mine 50 minutes for it to be done and able to check it with a knife to come out clean.  My husband absolutely loves this dessert when I make, going to make one right now!

"Hurrah!" An egg custard recipe like Mom use to make for all 14 of us in the family. It is delicious. Last time I made custard pie it was to soft and not firm at all. Great and simple ingredients, made two pies and doubled the ingredients.

Good ingredients, but bottom crust will not bake in 20 min in the oven. While heating the oven to bring up to temperature warm the crust for about 7 minutes and remove to fill with egg custard ingredients, of course you cover the edges first. Delicious! almost gone. Supper recipe, "THANK YOU!" 

I like just custard, no pastry some times so increase the recipe by 1/3rd pour in greased 9x9 glass pan and place in larger pan with water, bake for about 10 minutes longer than original recipe.

Stephanie,
For many years I have tried to duplicate the recipe that Morrison's Cafeteria used.  Your reciep is as close as I have seen.  While working for Morrison's, I weighed the ingredients and I would watch our Pastry Chef at Mobile's Springdale Plaza location, Sarah, do the same steps you have outlined in your recipe.  I have just finished a warm slice, and agree that you have ended my search.  This recipe is as close as you can get to the real thing.  GREAT RECIPE!!

Loved it. Made exactly as stated. My baking tin wasn’t quite deep enough so put the left over mix in a pudding dish and cooked it without pastry.

This pie is excellent!! Great as is, or I like to add fresh raspberries to make a raspberry custard pie. Just add 1 cup fresh washed, dried berries before filling crust. Bake as directed. Very yummy!!! I also like to add a sprinkle of nutmeg on top before baking. Gives it an little extra oomph!!

I have a husband who is very fond of Egg Custard Pie.  I had been looking for a very good recipe for quite some time and failed until I found this recipe.  My searching stopped and my husband wears a smile every time I made this for him.

It's good, but not sweet enough for my taste. My husband (who is far from a food cretic) even asked where the nutmeg was. I didn't dislike it but I will use a different recipe next time.

My Grandma used to make egg custard pie and I couldn't find a recipe that even came close to hers...until I tried this one.  This is the only recipe that I use for my egg custard pie and I also use it when I make baked custard. I add 1/4 cup more sugar to the recipe and it is just fabulous!!!!
I also wanted to add that I temper my eggs as well. This is a must. It's very easy to do as well. I saw that someone had already added this though so I won't go into how to do this.

Finally! An egg custard that replicates what I get at the cafeteria.  It is delicious.  Last time I made I just wanted the custard, no pastry so increased the recipe by 1/3rd and poured in greased 9x9 glass pan and placed in larger pan with water, baked for about 10 minutes longer than original recipe.  Delicious - made less than 12 hours ago, almost gone!  THANK YOU to whoever posted this !!

Good ingredients, but bottom crust will not bake in the allotted 20 min in the oven.  If you like gummy, uncooked crust go for it.  I bake my crust in the microwave for 3 minutes, let it cool and then fill and bake.
