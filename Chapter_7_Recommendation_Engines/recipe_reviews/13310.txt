Thanks to the reviewers, I started off by cutting the water in half. Was glad I did since we prefer hearty soups. Highly suggest smoked ham hocks. Other additions include an extra pound of smoked ham, 3 stalks celery, 3 carrots, garlic powder, fresh parsley, thyme, marjoram, and sage. Thank you so much for this recipe!  I have finally outperformed the legendary mother-in-law.  Update: Freezing works on this soup, but I've recently decided I prefer halving the recipe so we can eat all of it fresh!

This is a fabulous recipe made even better by taking tips from a few of the reviewers who've already posted.  Nice color, nice balance of flavors, very homey and comforting!  I served this with some great crusty rolls and a nice green salad, and it was a HUGE hit even with my finicky teens.  Here's what I did to "doctor" it up:  

First, I cut back by half on the water.  Second, I added about a Tbsp or so each of fresh sage, thyme and parsley (toward the end of cooking) and maybe half that amount of dried marjoram (because I couldn't find any fresh).  Third, instead of ham hocks which my family doesn't like (or need :-)), I bought some wonderful smoky ham at the deli counter, cubed it up and added about 1/2 lb of it right at the beginning of cooking, then used the remainder to garnish.  I did add one chicken bouillon cube but used low sodium chicken broth and added no additional salt, and it came out nicely.  Last, I added some nice-sized chunks of carrots and celery, and cut my potatoes into larger chunks too, to give the soup a more hearty flavor and appearance.  

One last tip -- This recipe makes a very large batch of soup, and I knew we would tire of it before it was eaten.  So I froze half of it at the stage AFTER pureeing but BEFORE adding any milk.  We'll enjoy it again one wintry evening!

Good recipe. Have made several versions with bacon, hamhocks, and ham bones. I prefer using smoked hamhocks and I always add some small diced boiled potato, carrots and about a cup and a half of cooked ham slice to the pot after I cream it. Makes it a little heartier and serve it with garlic bread and a salad. Very nice.

This is by far the best pea soup I've ever had, though I  made some changes.  I used 1/2 lb bacon instead of hamhocks (since I had it in my freezer already), frying the bacon in the stockpot, disposing of 1/3 the grease and reserving the crispy bacon for garnish later.  After the grease was cool, I added the rest of the ingredients.  I did take the bay out after 1/2 hour of simmering (afraid of too strong a taste) and reduced the amount of milk at the end as I thought this soup was too thin for my taste. I doubled the simmer time and it turned out just thick enough. I will use this recipe from now on!

A word to the wise: ALWAYS READ REVIEW SUGGESTIONS before preparing a recipe.  I made this recipe pretty much as instructed (I substituted a dash of cayenne for the red pepper flakes and substituted 1 tbsp "TASTEFULLY SIMPLE brand spinach & herb mix"...as it was the only thing on hand will dill in it). The recipe was way to watery for my family. I tried to salvage it by pureeing 3 cans of drained peas (it's all I had on hand) with a little of the broth and returned it to the pot. It was still watery so I thickened it with 1/2 c flour and 1 c water. This really increased the number of servings, so as not to dilute the flavor, I added 1/2 cup of TASTEFULLY SIMPLE product "Bacon Bacon" (dried, seasoned bacon bits). The flavor of the soup was great... my 5 year old ate 3 bowls! I froze the remainder in single serving portions using a vacuum sealer system and will have soup for weeks to come!

As much as I love split pea soup, I hardly ever make it because the recipe I have, although delicious, is  very time consuming. I found this to be very good and so quick and easy.  I cut the water to 4 cups and would recommend using low sodium chicken broth, as the chicken bouillion powder is very salty.  I will make this again (and soon).

Very good!! I did what everyone said to half the water, I used more chicken broth than water so I don't have to use boullion, added ham, garlic powder, dried thyme, and parsley!

I cut the water back by 2 cups and the soup still came out a little too thin for us but the flavor was very good and hubby & kids all enjoyed it very much.  I think next time I will cut down on the dill just a bit and cut out either the pepper flakes or the hot sauce because it was just a tad too hot for my taste.  I will also cut out the chicken bouillon powder (in favor of more chicken stock instead of water) as it seemed to make it too salty.  Overall, a very good soup that I will no doubt make again.

This soup was great.  I increased the split peas by 50%, added an extra potato to make it more hearty and omitted the milk  to save on calories.  Everyone in my family liked it which doesn't happen as often as I'd like!

I made a few changes: used yellow split peas instead of green and added 3/4 cup more peas for a thicker soup.  For a lower fat version, I cut up 3 thick slices of lean smoked ham instead of using ham hocks.  I also used low sodium chicken broth and bit more hot sauce. My favorite soup!

Rats, when am I going to learn to read at least a FEW reviews BEFOREHAND. I was in a hurry and  this one had a great star rating anyway. Turns out those great ratings were given by reviewers who changed the recipe. Add to that not being very familiar with making (only eating) pea soup, I didn't see this one coming. VERY watery, so either there's a mistake with the amount of liquid or this is not a traditional pea soup recipe. The flavor was a little weak as well, when I compare it to others I've tasted. I never did add the milk at the end, which would have watered it down even more. I tried adding instant potato flakes to thicken it which worked fairly well, but didn't want to alter the flavor by adding too much. This really only needs the 6 cups of broth and no milk, for that amount of split peas. Leave out the water all together.

Like everyone else, I cut the water in half and still found the soup to be far too watery and had to cook until the soup had reduced.  However, the flavors were excellent and I will make this again but this time without any water at all.  I wonder if there is a typo with the quantities.  It calls for 2 cups of split peas which seems far too little with 16 cups of liquid.  I noticed my standard bag of split peas was 2 pounds, not 2 cups, and this would have made the ratio about right since even the cooking directions on the bag say to add 6-8 cups water for each POUND.  Anyway, next time I'll either make 2 pounds worth or cut the total liquids (broth, water & milk) in half while keeping the other ingredients the same.

I added salt, minced garlic, thyme, sage, and two cans of garbanzo beans. I omitted the milk and cut the water down by half and added only 2 cups of chicken broth. Best split pea I have ever had! My 12 year old and 6 year old LOVE IT!!

Adjusted the following way: we used diced ham and sauteed with the onion first, decreased the broth/water for a thicker soup, cut the dill to 1t, and left out the bouillon and soy sauce.  Simmered for one hour before adding 2 diced carrots with the potatos, then simmered another hour before adding a can of evaporated milk.  No need to puree.  Very, very good soup.

I like this soup. Taste some time but only because things are cooking away largely on their own. I made mine quite spicy, which is good for me but not so much for others.  I didn't have dillweed, onion, or pepper flakes. Was mostly worried for the onion but still has great flavour. I used smoked ham hock which added a nice smell and taste. Like some of the reviews I took the advice to cut the water in half.

This was very good!  It is a wonderful recipe, but I think it's one of those that will be tweeked for one's own taste.  I used all the chicken broth called for in the recipe, but only a cup or two of water.  I added a half cup of cream in place of the milk.  I increased the hot sauce and red pepper flakes by two or three times and I used my hand held blender to puree the peas along the bottom of the pan for a minute or two.  Although I used the bone from my Easter ham, I think I will add a little liquid smoke next time.  Thankyou! thankyou! for the great recipe!

Yum!  I didn't add all of the water and added  1 cup of orzo the last 15 minutes instead of potatoe.  But otherwise a very tasty and filling soup.

I would love to give this recipe a five star rating, but cannot give it as written.  I usually take the time to read the reviews for valued tips.  However, I was in a hurry this time around.  Like many others, I think you need to cut down on the amount of water or add an additional amount of split peas if you like a thicker consistency.  One thing I did do on my own was to substitute some cubed up ham versus using the ham hocks.  The soup does have a wonderful flavor with its combination of spices and hot stuff.  I will also add some more ham after the blending process and may also throw in some carrots.

Do everything the reviewers say to do  - add the extra veggies, etc.  I used lots of ham and did the immersion blender.  So creamy and good.  I did half the water - very important, I think!

I made this in the crock-pot and it turned out nicely.  I only used half the water because I didn't have enough room in the pot and forgot to add the milk at the end and it was still wonderful.  This recipe is pretty versatile.

I pretty much followed the recipe and also cut down on the water just a bit.  To make a thicker consistency, I boiled the potatoes separate and added them AFTER the other part of the soup was pureed - the chunks of potato made it feel heartier.  I also added some celery and carrots into the pea mixture and pureed them in (its great to hide veggies when the kids will be eating it!!).  The ham I used was the leftover bone from our Christmas spiral ham, it made for wonderful flavor!

If I rated this soup on flavor alone it would get 5 stars +, but...I cut the water by half and it was too thin. Though I was dismayed with the watery consistency, I was delighted with the overall blending of the ingredients flavors. I used a meaty ham bone from New Years dinner, added celery and carrots. For hot sauce I used Cholula because the heat doesn't dominate the wonderful flavor of this hot sauce. I simmered the soup for a couple hours then put it in fridge overnight. Next day I cooked it down until right consistency for us. I didn't puree part of the soup which is probably a step that does help to thicken it. We enjoy the less smooth texture of split pea soup but I may try the puree thing next time. This soup is so good that there will be next times. It's well worth the little effort to correct the consistency to our likings.

I made this soup a few days after Xmas, using the hambone from our dinner.  It was my first time making pea soup and I wanted an easy recipe to follow.  This recipe is not only easy to follow but is by far the BEST pea soup I've ever had.   I followed the directions but also paid attention to the reviews that others had shared.   I cut the water in half, using only 4 cups instead of 8.   I used 5 potatoes instead of only 2.   I included 3 celery stalks, a bunch of shredded carrots and all of the other spices recommended (garlic powder, parsley, thyme, marjoram & sage). At the end I used only 1 cup of milk, instead of 2.   I also only pureed ham, potatoes and carrots from the stock pot that hadn't thinned out.   It was wonderful.   I highly recommend!   5 STARS

Different and very tasty.  I've made this a few times and it is always a crowd pleaser.  I prefer using the ham bone after a honey baked ham dinner, usually after Thanksgiving, Xmas, or Easter.

Wonderful, tasty soup. I cut the water in half, used vegetable broth and buillon instead of chicken, and otherwise followed the recipe. Even my very picky son liked it very much. That says a LOT! My daughter said she hadn't had split pea soup in years, and didn't realize how good it is. Many thanks for this recipe that I will use again and again.

Cut water by half - used 1 lb bacon and a diced ham steak instead of ham hocks - added 1/2 teaspoon sage - added liquid smoke - added carrots - doubled hot pepper sauce - dropped soy sauce - A very potent, rich tasting soup.

I followed the recommendations that others have left (i.e. I used half the water and added celery, carrots, and a bunch of fresh herbs - rosemary, thyme, oregano, and sage all tied together).  I didn't have the hot chili oil or the dill so ommitted those ingredients too.
This soup was delicious.  I never write reviews, but this soup inspired me.

Overall, this had a nice flavor, but I have to say I was a bit disappointed.  It didn't thicken nearly as much as I thought it would.  Use much water.  It was also a bit too dilly for me, and I love dill.  I'd cut the dill by half, but I don't think we'll make this again.

Very good. The soy sauce kinda threw us off when we were cooking, but it was a great addition. We used french lentils instead of split peas. And added celery and carrots. No need to blend if you like a chunkier soup/stew. It was delicious on a cold winter day.

Yum! Yum! Yum! This soup is awesome! We're soup lovers and enjoy trying new soups so I made this for my family and they loved it! My mother (who insisted that she wasn't a fan of split pea soup) literally looked me in the eye and said that this was THE best soup she had ever eaten (and mind you, we eat a LOT of soup). 
The only things I did different were to follow everyone's suggestions and half the water ( I also left out the potatoes because I had none); and add carrots and celery. But leave the pepper! It adds a great kick!
Awesome awesome soup that I know I will be making again and again in the future!

I really liked this soup, even though I goofed it up a bit. I put in 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper instead of red pepper flakes.  It was too hot for my wife.  Also cut back on water and added sour cream dollops to each bowl instead of adding milk. Also used bacon to replace ham since I think it gives a better flavor.

This was an amazing recipe! So easy to make, and solve my abundant collection of canned peas no one wants to eat. I just used those instead of split peas, plus some left over posole. Went to town with the hand mixer after letting it simmer in crock pot. Perfect rainy saturday food. Best part was my 7 and 13 yr old loved it, abd here I been avoiding it because I thought they wouldn't like pea soup!

I rated this at four only because having to make some changes to keep it from turning into a disaster at the end. As stated by some reviewers there is way too much liquid. I used 6c of chicken broth, 2c water, and only about 1c of milk because it was still thinning down quickly. I used half the dill weed called for, added 2 each carrots and celery stalks finely chopped and used an immersion blender to thicken up the soup after I took the hocks out. My company tonight just loved the flavor of the soup! This goes into the rotation file for sure!!

The end product was not bad, but I had to make some inflight adjusts to get there... after an hour cooking, I still had lots of broth, so I pulled it off, almost a quart! So I suggest not adding the water. Also, I added extra meat and more potatoes than called far and it was still that much extra liquid. When I pureed the 6 cups and added the milk, the result was pretty good... could have used some more spice... also, the dried split peas I used (HEB) called for a cooking time of 30 minutes, so they were pretty mushy after an hour, even before the puree. I will probably add them later next time.

Really good.  I deleted the whole milk to save calories.  There was enough liquid without it. I added a slice of ham which made it really meaty though the meat from the ham hocks tasted better.  Freezes well.

I love this recipe. I hadn't made split pea soup before because no one would eat it except me. When I found out my new boyfriend loves it, I decided to make some. Easy and SO yummy. It was a little runny for my liking so I added some instant mashed potatoes to thicken it up. Next time I will just add more potatoes. Flavor was MMMM good. Served with a salad and made fresh bread that day. Great Winter meal. Thanks William.

Deff. read the reviews before you start.  I also used about 1/2 the water and added rice towards the end.  Could have used a bit more pepper flakes or hot pepper sauce, but it was delich!!  Hubby raved about it.  I also cooked it in a crock pot for about 6 hours (high to start, then on low for about 4 hours).  I threw in some leftover turkey from Thanksgiving too...

This was so yummy, it had way to much dill for my families liking but easily adapted. I added carrots which was great. This was a scrupcious alternative to the ham soup I usually make with the left over eater ham.

We really liked it. We love pea soup anyway. I didn't add all the water and added none of the milk. We wanted a thick soup. I also went without the potatoes to save on carbs. Very good none the less. No one would have guessed that it had the soy sauce and the pepper flakes. Will make again.

This was much better than I had expected.  The kick made all the difference.  I did cut the recipe in half and then halved the milk again.  I made it in the pressure cooker, so I had no need to puree the soup.  I used a meaty ham bone instead of the ham hocks and ground black pepper instead of the white.

Can't wait to see how this soup freezes. TFS.

My husband Loved this soup!  I'm giving it 4 stars, because if you like food with a 'bite' to it, you'll probabley like this soup.  It was a bit 'hot' for my taste (with crushed peppers & hot sauce).  I liked the addition of potatoes.  The only change I made in the recipe is that I only used 1/2 the water and 1/2 the milk--which made the consistency perfect for our tastes.

This was very good and although easy, a little time consuming.  I should have read the reviews ahead of time, next time I will cut the water down by several cups.  It's a little watery, but not bad.  Also, to save on sodium, I used low-sodium chicken broth and for the bouillon, I used 3 regular cubes and 3 packets of low-sodium powder type.  It came out perfectly.  The recipe could definitely use more ham.  Either use very meaty ham hocks or 1 very meaty ham bone, or just buy a thick slice from the meat dept., cut it up and add it in.  Very good soup, though!

My Aunt told my Uncle "Honey, this is even better than mine!"  Excellent, easy recipe and perfect consistency if you don't like it thick! (I left the Bay leaves in until the end and it was fine :)

We loved this soup! The flavors were delicious.
I simmered it down to the consistency we like.
Will make again.

Too much dill weed. And I halved the water and it was still thin. Overall a good taste if you don’t mind the dill weed being too strong.

As written, the recipe does not work! Comparing it to other similar recipes, the ingredients should read  2 "pounds" of dry split peas instead of 2 "cups". As stated by others, I should have read the reviews first!

This was the best pea soup I have ever had! I used my left over honey baked ham from Christmas and it was great. It was almost good enough I would buy a honey baked ham just to make this again.

I love this recipe - it has great flavor, but then again I love the flavor of dill.  It is my go-to split pea soup recipe.  The only "changes" I made were to add some carrots, used only 4 cups each of water and vegetable broth (instead of chicken broth) and to not puree the soup.  I prefer chunky soup.  The peas cook down enough they don't need to be pureed, the chunks of ham, carrots and potatoes seem to make it more substantial.  Thanks for sharing.

I love pea soup and this is a good recipe. I cut the entire recipe in half but not the peas - used 2 cups of split peas. Also added carrots and celery. Consistency was perfect. I like a medium thickness and that was the result. I did not use the red pepper flakes or hot pepper sauce. Next time I may try one of them to spice it up just a bit more or use the whole onion and white pepper.  Overall a good pea soup that I will save to my recipe box and make again.

Was very good never had pea soup before. Maybe next time will cut back to 1 tablespoon of chicken bouillon and soy sauce. Also, didn't have potatoes so I used 1 cup instant mash potatoes b/c they are going to boil down for thickness.

My 14 year old son made this soup for dinner and it was awesome. He added carrots, celery and paprika to it but otherwise he left the rest of the recipe alone. He has 2 younger brothers who tend to be picky and they both loved it! Will definitely be making this again, maybe next time, I'll get to help!

Made it according to the recipe and gave it 4 stars. Too thin and too much dill.  Made it again, halving the water and the dill; added garlic and thyme and would now rate it 5 stars.  My husband loves it and have had requests for the recipe.

Delicious!  We used 4 cups of chicken broth and 6 cups of water.  Also used 2 smoked ham hocks, then threw them away as they didn't have any usable meat on them.  Halved the amount of dill called for (which was plenty!).  Pureed with the stick blender then added 1/2 to 1 cup diced ham.  Also subbed 1% milk for whole milk.  Everyone, especially my 6 year old son who hates vegetables, raved about this recipe.

Very very good!  I cut the recipe in half (8 servings) and used a disappointingly meatless hamhock - next time I'll try a thick slab of smoked pork.  I did add celery and carrots and let the soup simmer for two hours or so; there was no need to puree as all the vegetables cooked down nicely.  The addition of the hot pepper sauce, crushed red peppers, and dill weed gave the soup a really nicely different taste from the run-of-the-mill split pea soup.  I'll be making this again.

This is a fantastic split pea soup recipe.  I have shared the recipe with my friends, and they also think it is the best ever.  I sometimes use more chicken broth instead of water, but that's the only change I make.

Very tasty!  And Great Flavor!  I will make this again after we eat all that was frozen.  I did half the water and still it was very watery.  I did not puree or add any additional milk.  I added a couple of spoonfuls of cornstarch to try and thicken it up a bit.  It did seem to help.  Next time I will reduce the water to less than half of what the recipe calls for.

I have served this twice, and my family loves this soup. The only change I made is that I serve a shot glass of sherry with each serving, for each person to stir into their bowl as they like. I had pea soup served this way in Big Sur, years ago, and family likes it this way.
