This recipe is a winner and so is Allrecipes.com.  At 8pm the night before Thanksgiving, my mother asked me to bring pumpkin bread to dinner.  I'm in the process of moving and my cookbooks are in storage.  Mom, that perennial source of recipes, was busy making the rest of the meal.  I logged on to Allrecipes.com and found this FABULOUS recipe.

It was fast and easy to make, looks beautiful (sorry - no coffee cans, just traditional loaf tins) and tastes great! I had NO left-overs so have made this recipe again on Sunday. Thanks Leigh Paulin for sharing!

This Pumpkin bread recipie is great! I used regular loaf pans and also added 1 tsp. of ground cloves. I only wish it would have called for chopped nuts.

Overall a great recipe.  I felt something was missing, so I added one teaspoon of cloves and it turned out great.  I also chose not to use coffee cans and used a regular loaf pan instead.  My friends and co-workers loved it and have offered to pay me to bake it for them for the holidays.

We had a morning graduation in our family and I had everyone for brunch following the graduation.  Made the pumpkin bread in the coffee cans and it looked so festive sliced with different cream cheeses on the side--was a hit with everyone.

I have made this twice already and really enjoy it.  It has a great flavor.  Next time I might try adding some chopped nuts.

I substituted 1 1/2 c brown sugar and 1 c white sugar, cut 1/4 c oil and added 1/4 c additional water. I added 1/2 c chopped walnuts and 1/2 c raisins. I used a bundt pan and had enough to bake another medium loaf. It is a delicious recipe and I will use it again.

Great recipe, very moist.  I did add a cup of pecan nuts though -- just a personal preference.  I didn't use the coffee cans, just 3 loaf tins.  Thanks for the recipe:)

Very good! I used two loaf pans instead of coffee cans and omitted the allspice and added some ground clove. I also sprinkled brown sugar on top as well.

This recipe was sooo good! I'm new to cooking and it was very easy to make. I made it even better with a teaspoon extra of the nutmeg, allspice, and cinnamon, as well as an extra 1/2 cup of the pumpkin puree. I would recommend this recipe to anyone!

I love this recipes and make it every Christmas to rave reviews. I think the 2 teaspoons of baking soda make all the difference. I make it in loaf pans vs. coffee cans. I get 3 loaves out of 1 15 oz can of pumpkin. And this year changed the spice mixture to 1 teaspoon ea of cinnamon, ginger & pumpkin pie spice. Yum!

I changed the recipe a bit, and it still turned out wonderful! I used whole wheat flour, instead of bleached flour.  I reduced the sugar to 1 1/2 cups, reduced oil to 1/2 cup, reduced to 3 eggs,  I used a pumpkin pie spice mixture and then I added 1 tbs of vanilla and sprinkled in some walnuts. Also, I baked with mini muffin tins,( about 12 minutes) and they were the perfect bite size. Great snack! I will definitely make them again.

OMG!!! This bread was amazing!  I didn't alter a thing (except for the coffee cans), and the results were PERFECT.  I must have made a little smaller loaves than the recipe author, because I came away with five perfect little ones.  I buttered the tops before wrapping them in Seran wrap for storage, and it created the most delicious top crust.  MMMMMM!

I liked this bread a lot! I made it in muffin form. :) I did notice, however, that it had a slightly eggy taste. As if I had put some fried eggs into it....  I did change the recipe jusssst a tad, though. I used walnut oil instead of vegetable oil, and I also used pumpkin pie spice instead of all the spices. My roommates especially liked this.

I made some mini loaves today for Thanksgiving and they turned out great! (except I forgot to grease the pans, so the bottoms aren't pretty, but that was my fault!!!)  I taste tested 1 and it is so yummy! I am sure everyone will love this.

We made this recipe into muffins for my son's class and they were very good.  Moist and flavorful.  We used paper muffin cups and baked at the same temp.  Pulled out of oven when a toothpick came out clean. They tasted a bit baking-soda-y but it could be because my 9-yr-old did some of the measuring.  We will try this recipe again.

Very good one, but I just put 1 1/2 cup of sugar, or would be too sweet. And add a few chocolate chips too.

Just got this bread out of the oven.  And my family ate it before it was even cool.  I changed the recipe though.  I used brown sugar instead of white sugar and added chopped pecans.  (I like it better with pecans).

I would have used applesauce or butter instead of Oil.  The bread looked wonderful, but all I tasted was oil!

This was the most delicious pumpkin bread I've ever tasted. We all agreed that the crust was so nice and chewy it was like a cookie bread with a nice moist center. I used heaping measures of the spices, and next time I think I'll add candied pecans. This bread is extremely delicious!

I loved this recipe. I did add some extra ingredients. I added chopped pecans, and I used pumpkin pie spice instead of nutmeg because I didn't have it on hand. I substituted one cup of applesauce in place of the oil. The bread came out great!

The recipe was very easy to follow.  In a typical kitchen, you might not find allspice or chopped walnuts, however with one trip to the store, those ingredients can be found easily.  There was a considerable amount of measuring supplies used, but other than that, the cleaning did not take too long.  The pumpkin bread cooked just perfectly as it took one hour to bake.  The three members in my cooking group all agreed that the bread was very good tasting yet a little bit dry.  The nuts were a nice addition to the bread to add some texture and taste.  The spice added a nice touch to the bread and there was a bit of a bite at the end of it which was delicious.  This is a great recipe that with a little more "wetness" to it can be perfect.

First time I made it, the flavor was good, but much too much sugar!  Not to mention, the directions should have stated fill loaf pan 1/2 full to avoid overflow in your oven. (what a disaster!)
Second time I made it, better since I cut back the sugar (2 1/2 cups).  I'm thinking it might be better yet with applesauce rather than oil.  You have to play around with this recipe to get it right.  Good starting point though.

I never liked pumpkin bread before, but this recipe is wonderful!  The flavor is mild, but perfectly blended.  Small loaves make great gifts at Christmas!

This is a fantastic pumpkin bread recipe. Very moist, very spicy, just delicious. I must admit I used one cup of brown sugar and butter crisco to add a bit to the dark taste and moistness. This is now my favorite pumpkin bread recipe!

I’ve been making this recipe for a number of years now. It’s always a hit. Just add the whole can of pumpkin and maybe 1/8 cup more flour. You can’t ruin this recipe—trust me, I’ve tried lol

This recipe was awesome. I was looking for a recipe with out cloves since I don't like them and found this one. It was great the only thing I did differently was use about 1 1/3 cups fresh pumpkin instead of the canned and baked it in four mini loaf pans. Excellent will make again and again. Thanks for a great recipe.

This is known as Amazing Pumpkin Bread at my office. I did not change a single thing, the flavors are just perfect! The coffee cans make it THE BEST although it can be baked in anything and still be good. The way it bakes in the cans it continuously rises up the can and ends up with a rounded top. Seems more moist and dense in the coffee can than the other pans I've used. Plus it looks so nice wrapped in colored plastic wrap with a bow on top. I make a simple cream cheese icing to spread on the slices when serving it myself. Amazing! Try the cans, seriously.

This is a great recipe. Never having baked in a coffee can I didn't know what to expect. Make sure your oven rack is on "B".  I had mine on "C" and lost the crown off two cans when I pulled them out and had a mess in the oven. Also, I used 1 2/3 c. fresh baked pumpkin (1 small baking pumpkin) instead of canned, & baked it a few minutes longer. It was perfect!

This is a great recipe for the fall time.  I just made this and my husband loves it!  The only thing that I changed was using olive oil instead of vegetable oil.  It made quite a bit of bread, so I might send a loaf with my husband to work. Enjoy!

This is the best tasting pumpkin bread I have ever had!!!  I put raisins in one of the loaves and it turned out great.  I received nothing but rave reviews. This is definitely a recipe that I'll be making every Thanksgiving.

Very good pumpkin bread. I did however use the full can of pumpkin (15oz.) as I thought that only a cup of pumpkin would not be enough pumpkin flavor. Added a little additional spice with the pumpkin.  Batter was definitely better with the added pumpkin. My breads came out well

I have made this recipe since the early 80s when it came out in Southern Living magazine. I bake it in 3 metal coffee cans. It turns out perfect every time. It’s a family favorite. Also makes great neighbor gifts during Christmas.

Awesomeness!!  Made this with my GF flour with a tad bit of an adjustment:   Added 1/2 cup water, used 2 cups white sugar and 1 light brown sugar, added teaspoon pure vanilla extract, 2 teaspoons Pumpkin extract, used real pumpkin - purée (about two cups of real pumpkin before puréed) Had enough for two loads and one rose pretty high.  Moist, tasty, and a huge hit!!

I enjoyed this recipe some substitutions I made : I used 1/2 a cup of pumpkin puree. We just finished making fresh pumpkin puree which is super easy; clean it up and cut into manageable pieces and roast it in the oven at 350 F till its very soft, then scoop it out and puree it in a food processor add a little water to it to let it blend easier and we then freeze it. Fresh pumpkin is really delicious. So now back to the recipe, I also used 1/2 teaspoon of  powdered ginger, cinnamon and clove. I added my pumpkin spice mix seasoning too because I had no nutmeg. I also added about 1/4 cup more of flour because it was still a little bit too liquid but after that it was fine, I used vegetable crisco to grease the pan because I was low on butter. Came out wonderful we ate it warm with a little bit of vanilla bean ice cream on top. A keeper!

My mom always made a pumpkin bread with nuts and dates, baked in coffee cans, so when I couldn't find her recipe, I decided to try this one.  Couldn't find metal coffee cans (?), so I tried mini-loaf pans.  Worked perfectly, the recipe made 6 loaves.  Based on other reviews here, I also made the following changes: used 3/4 c oil and 1/4 c applesauce; changed to 1.5 c brown sugar and 1 c white sugar.  I also added chopped pecans and dates. Bread was delicious, will definitely make this again!

This is my go to for parties year round, but especially during the holiday. I added a bit more spice and a touch of ginger, but otherwise kept it the same. Whenever i bake this, it's gone in a flash. It also works well as muffins or even cupcakes.

this is a great pumpkin bread recipe.  I used butter instead of oil and made them into muffins with cream cheese frosting.
