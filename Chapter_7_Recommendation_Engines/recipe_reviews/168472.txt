My husband and I both enjoyed this recipe.  I tweaked the amounts of veggies a bit to satisfy our tastes (more of carrots and potatoes, less celery.)  I also didn't use fresh basil because it costs too much.  To make up for the flavor, I added dried basil, more oregano, and some Italian seasoning.  I also added some dried red pepper for a little extra spice.  I added all of the spices while simmering instead of after so that the tastes could combine.  I'm also considering adding the Italian sausage earlier next time so that the flavor mingles. I'm sure I'll make this again!

Just awesome!  Family and I lived this hearty soup. I used hot Italian turkey sausage removed from the casing and cooked and crumbled. The red wine flavor really stands out. I used broken spaghetti as my pasta of choice that I cooked seperately so as not to make the soup too starchy. Fresh spinach and basil are also a must. Delicious,  healthy and filling. I sprinkled some red hot pepper flakes on mine along with some grated romano cheese. Thanks!

It had a great flavor. I would use mild sausage instead of hot next time. I didn't have any basil, so I added some dry basil the same time I added the oregano. I also didn't have enough spinach, but I did chop up what I had and cooked it along with the other veggies. I also didn't have any of the rotini pasta, so I substituted egg noodles. With all my adjustments the soup was still amazing.

I substituted chopped steak for the spicy sausage, and it turned out great; very hearty and filling!

This recipe is absolutely delicious! It has lots of wonderful, healthy veggies and so many flavors. My whole family loved it and I'll definitely make it again. I made it exactly as the recipe is written, however it would be easy to modify it to include different veggies and/or meats. I had an opened bottle of shiraz that was the perfect red wine to go with the bold flavors of this dish. Excellent recipe and I'll make it again, especially when the weather cool off this winter.

Wow! A hit at my house. I used chilli chicken sausage instead of traditional Italian. It gave it a spicy hot bang!

I enjoyed this very much, but the family didn't so much; they are not big sausage lovers, so take with a grain of salt.  I did add the oregano for the last hour of cooking and added about 1/4 cup sugar to give it a boost - I usually cook much more spicy recipes.  Needed two cans of beans in my opinion.  Would leave the potato out next time.  All in all, I'd make it again for myself, but probably not for the girls.  Would make a great potluck or poker night dish.

I really enjoyed this recipe.  What's not to love, w/all the different flavors/ingredients that go into it!  I did make a few minor changes-I left the potato out b/c didn't think it was necessary; used wheat rotini and couldn't tell the difference; added a handful of tortellini and added extra beef broth to help cook the pasta.  The black beans go unnoticed, but left them in b/c i love them!  Yummy!

Not a big fan of this "soup", I'd call it more of a "stoup" (as Rachael Ray would say). The flavor was ok, but not what I expected....

This soup was a hit in my family! My teen-agers and all of their friends want me to make this again. My Husband took a bowl to work for lunch and it smelled the whole break room up-to the point that all his co-workers wanted a sample. May have to triple this recipe next time, which will be soon. I even sent this recipe to my friend who is in charge to the local Soup Kitchen! Thanks for posting...5 stars in my book!

When this was cooking, I got worried; it really looked like this was going to be a flop.  Boy, was I wrong.  I followed the recipe exactly and it tasted wonderful.  DH and I prefer it without the pasta as a light meal, although over pasta is quite good, too.  Warning:  this makes a ton of soup -- the portion sizes are huge.

This was delicious and very satisfying on a cold Winter day. I omitted the carrots, used ground sweet Italian sausage because I didnâ€™t have links, and used dried Italian seasoning instead of the basil. It came out thicker than I thought it would-which was fine because I like my broth thicker anyway.

Loved this! The only tweak I made was to use half the spicy sausage and half a link of kielbasa.

This was a fun soup to make during a snowstorm.  Loved the texture and how everything came together. The wine definitely added a richness to the broth.  My only change was that I only had sweet Italian sausages on hand so I used those.  I thought adding some red pepper flakes would compensate, which it did except that I ended up "overcompensating" and we ended up with a "Fra Diablo effect" !!!!   Still love this recipe and will make again...   the right way!

This soup was excellent.  I had to use dried basil otherwise I followed it exactly.  Also, used a sweet red for the wine as that's what I had.

We loved it! I'm so glad I decided to try it. I just typed It sausage and soup and hit search... I substituted shells for the rotini and used a can of diced tomatoes that had Basil, Garlic, Oregano in it because I needed to use the can! My husband asked what I used to give it that good flavor ...

Very delicious! I used sweet italian sausage and omitted the black beans because my kids would throw a fit. Added 2 cups pasta instead of 1. Otherwise followed recipe to a T. My entire family loved it and we will definitely be making this one again!

Hearty alternative to the usual black bean soup.  I used dried beans (1.5 cups) that I soaked overnight.

This is absolutely WONDERFUL! The red wine is a delicious touch! I tried to follow this to a T (Besides adding chopped portabella mushrooms) but I forgot until after I had already canned it all that I had left out the spinach and the celery, which.. I did buy, just didn't use. I'll bring spinach tonight in a bag and mix it into the can. Is it weird that I am already looking forward to my 0200 lunch break and it's only 1630 now? :-D

Awful, just awful.  No taste what-so-ever (and we're Italian) and a waste of lots of nice vegetables.  But we're stuck with it so we'll have to eat it.  I have another Italian Sausage soup recipe that is wonderful, I'll stick to that.

Substituted Spicy sausage for sweet sausage.  WOW was this a good recipe.  I was looking for a change up on our homemade chicken soup.  After having a black bean/sausage soup at a local soup establishment I wanted to try something that would be similar to have at home.  Check around on here for one, choose this one and I must say BINGO first try and I have to look no further.  Next time will be with "Hot" sausage... Im sure my feelings will remain the same about this recipe!!

I followed this recipe but with a few minor changes. I didnt have fresh basil so I used 1 1/2 teaspoons of dried basil along with the oregano. I also thought another reviewer's idea to cook the sausage and spices a little longer made sense so I followed the directions, cooked for 30 minutes rather than 60, added the sausage, oregano and dried basil and cooked for 30 minutes. I didnt have rotini so I substituted small shells. We loved it. It was a little spicy probably since the sausage had 30 min more to add flavor but for our taste it was absolutely delicious. If you prefer it less hot then put the sausage in as the recipe states but I think adding the oregano after 30 min added a lot of flavor since it had time to simmer, 7-10 minutes wouldnt be enough. I will make this again.

Great recipe!  The only thing I would alter is to double the beans and rotini. Otherwise, it was fabulous!

great recipe - excellent flavour! didn't have fresh spinach so just omitted, and used dried basil. would try it with a smaller pasta such as penne or similar next time, but we loved it even with the minor adjustments. totally recommend it.
