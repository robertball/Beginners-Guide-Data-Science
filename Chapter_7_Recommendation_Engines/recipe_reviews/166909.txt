You're Welcome, Bob! I really enjoyed these, thanks for rating my salad (: Update: I used the leftover filling to make a type of stuffing with shrimp on top and mozzerella cheese, I stuck under the broiler until the cheese was bubbly and a little brown---now that was amazing! Thanks for the fantastic recipe, didn't help with my diet, but I really enjoyed! Orginal review: These were very flavorful! I subbed minced-up shrimp for the clams, I also like other reviewer's suggestion of using sausage, I think that would be really good. My 4 year old came in from outside and said the house smelled like pizza and he was wondering where the pizza was, LOL. I didn't use quite as much Italian seasoning as called for, and I scaled the recipe to 5 mushrooms just to try it, and had enough filling for 7 or 8. So I had quite a bit of stuffing leftover, this makes alot of stuffing mixture. Thanks for the post!

I have to admit, I followed this recipe word for word and am glad I did!  What a wonderful stuffed mushroom!  And so much better than resturants!  This is my husband's favorite appetizer, and he couldn't get enough of them!  Thanks for an excellent recipe!!

My husband loves this recipe...he's making it again right now!  He also substitues hot sausage for the clams (my sister doesn't like seafood) and it comes out GREAT!  Highly recommend this recipe! Thanks so much!

After everything I cook, I ask my husband "so, are we having this again"? I had yet to get an "oh my God this is the greatest thing I have ever eaten" response UNTIL last night! For father's day, I made this for him as an appetizer and from the living room couch I heard "THIS IS AMAZING".  It really is. Followed the recipe. Easy, fast, and like he said, amazing!

This is my recipe, and I'm Glad that many of you enjoy it. It has taken me a long time to figure it out to my tastes, but I think it is awesome. Some have complained about to much Italian flavors, but you can obviously substitute regular bread crumbs. Also, yeas there is a lot of stuffing left over, and the original calls for 30 mushroom caps. Somehow on submission it was changed to 20.

I thought this was okay.  I tried this according to the recipe but I see now what everybody meant when they said they didn't taste the clams.  I put a little more clams than the recipe called for because I LOVE clams, but I didn't taste it at all.  Next time I'll just use crabmeat like another reviewer mentioned.  The italian seasoning along with the italian breadcrumbs really overpowered the taste.. Next time I'll just use plain breadcrumbs, less italian seasoning, and a little more parmesan cheese to the recipe.  And there was a LOT of stuffing left over, so you need to either halve the recipe or use more mushrooms.

The mushrooms are fantastic! I did add a little white wine and butter to the bottom of the pan to make a nice little dipping sauce. I made these for a family gathering I made two huge casseroles full! No leftovers at all!

These were AWESOME!!  I made these for friends we had over the other night and between four of us we ate 36 of these suckers!!  I didn't use onion--just to save me a little time (but will use it next time to taste the difference).  I used canned lump crab meat (2-6oz. cans), mixed my mozzarella right into the crab/breadcrumb mixture and poured one cup of butter over mushrooms before cooking.  Incredibly easy and amazingly delicious I will be making these again soon!

This side dish overshadowed our main dish!  I prepared it just as the recipe says except I replaced the drizzled butter at the end with a spray of canola oil.

Okay but not terrific. The only change I made was to add some of the mozzarella to the stuffing. After baking a bit I also topped them with some too.  I was able to fill about 25 med-large mushrooms and had a bit of the stuffing left. I also reduced the butter I used to drizzle over them a little.

We liked this recipe a lot and it made the house smell wonderful! I changed it a little bit, but nothing major although I did forget to add the mozarella! We didn't miss it so I may not use it next time either :-) First, I finely chopped the mushroom stems and sauteed them with the onion and garlic in a little butter before I added the other filling ingredients. I used the full amount of butter in the filling, but No butter drizzled over the top. I just thought that another cup of butter was very extreme! Instead, I used butter flavored crisco spray for the top of the mushrooms before cooking and they turned out wonderful!! Oh yeah, because I added the minced mushroom stems to the filling, I was able to cut the other filling ingredients in half and still had more than enough even when I packed it in the caps as much as possible! Saved that other can of minced clams for something else :o)

Wow. I have tried many recipies from this site but have never taken the time to write a review. The only thing I did differently was to add about 4 slices of crumbled bacon to the stuffing. This was sooo good. I tried not to think about the cup of butter I was eating. However was soo worth the calories. This was devine!

OMG!  I thought the recipe looked really good and was not disappointed!  DH and 3 golf buddies grabbed these up and went back for seconds - I managed to snag one before the pan was empty!  I'm replacing my old recipe and using this one from now on!  Thanks Bob!

These were delicious and gone very quick. I adjusted according to other comments, by not adding parsley. Also, I used only 1 stick of butter, 2/3 in mix and remaining 1/3 over the tops. I ran out of mozzarella making the lasagna, so I used parmesan on the tops. Still very delicious. Thanks Bob!!

We loved these. Used shrimp and crab instead of clams. might use less bread crumbs next time. def dont need all the butter.  The mozz cheese on top gets kinda hard after they cool a little, might skipped that too.  These were great though!!!

I made these for Thanksgiving appetizers and everyone loved them.  At the end when you drizzle butter over the stuffed mushrooms, I didn't use as much butter as the recipe called for and they were still delicious.

Sorry to give such a low rating BUT the seasoning was WAY TOO overpowering and way too oily!  I even used plain bread crumbs but the Italian seasoning was too strong for our liking.  I would not make this again!

I didn't use the italian seasoning, or dried parsley, and less (minced) onion (I am not a big fan).  I took these to work and they were gobbled up quickly.  I think next time though I might use chopped shrimp, just for a difference.

I ate this last night for New Year's Eve as part of a series of appetizers. I wanted to love them because the majority of the reviews were so favorable. I really did find them to be very bland. There were no exciting flavors that made me so "WOW this is good".. It is probably just my personal taste since everyone else loves them so much...

These are awesome!!  My daughter and I made these for our Thanksgiving dinner as an appetizer for our hungry crowd and they were a hit.  We used canned lump crab meat and canned tiny shrimp as I couldn't find clams at the store.  Also reduced the butter that you pour over the mushrooms to 1/2 cup and it was plenty.

This recipe is delicious,  I made it for fight night last night and everyone raved about it.  They kept on asking me if I'd make it next fight night. Which, of course, I will. This recipe makes a lot of stuffing, more than I actually needed to stuff the mushrooms, so i would recommend getting more mushrooms than it calls for.

Wow! These were great.  I was a little nervouse because I never have used clams before but they were not fishy at all.  No one knew they had clams in them!  I do think the clams give it a great texture and flavor that mixes with all the other stuff. Great. Easy. Don't change a thing!

These are the best stuffed mushrooms I've ever had!  I'd probably half the Italian seasoning next time though, or use plain bread crumbs.

Great recipe! I did exchange the clams for sausage and I added a little white wine to the butter mixture poured over the top of the mushrooms as suggested by another reviewer.  Thanks for the recipe Bob!

If I could give this a 10 I would. The taste was sooo good, easy to make, and enjoyed by all my guest. Only change I made because I trippled the recipe was to add more butter to the mixture and more butter in the pan also didn't use clams used can shrimp and crab. Thanks for sharing this one. Will do these again.

These were fantastic!  Only thing is, nobody could taste the clams...and since I tripled the recipe for a big party, the clams added about $6 to the cost.  I think I'll leave them out next time to save some bucks.  Everyone loved them!

These mushrooms were pretty good, but WAY too much butter is called for. They actually came out soggy what with all the butter and water from the mushrooms themselves. Next time, I would only drizzle about 1/4 cup melted butter before baking them. Also used imitation crabmeat instead of clams and came out delicious.

Oh my goodness Bob!  You have out done yourself.  These are absolutely amazing.  I think better than any I've ever had at a restaurant.  Superb!  I followed the recipe exactly, except I left out the onion.  Fantastic!  Thank you, thank you!

I subbed crab for the clams and cut out the Italian seasoning all together in favor of just using Italian seasoned bread crumbs. These were delicious but seemed to be missing a little something. Also mine were done after only 10 min in the oven.

Made as written 3 stars... Made with following modifications 5 stars!!!  Omit onions, parsley and Italian seasoning.   Add 1 tsp onion powder to stuffing mixture and mix in 3/4 cup mozzarella cheese/smoked provolone Sargento cheese mix to the stuffing (not afterwards and don't forget to add the 1/2 c Parmesan cheese either). Dice half your mushroom stems and sauté with the chopped garlic (up garlic to 3 cloves) and 1 tbsp olive oil for a few minutes then add it to stuffing mixture.  Stuff mushrooms and drizzle only 1/2 cup of butter over top before baking (1 cup is too much).  Be sure to use Italian seasoned breadcrumbs if omitting Italian spices and parsley.  This recipe made 30 stuffed mushrooms mostly medium and a few small size.   Sooooo good!

I used Italian seasoning - McCormick  grinder - instead of Italian dressing mix - used less butter - only 1/2 cup about 1/3 mixed in the rest drizzled on top after the mozzarella - Used garlic  powder - No onions.  Added ground black pepper.  Very much like my father-in-laws which were the best stuffed mushrooms in the world!  Delicious!

Made them exactly as written and they were DELICIOUS! If I change anything next time (and there will be a next time), I will use just a little more bread crumbs and less butter when I drizzle after they are stuffed. I will probably add more of it into the stuffing mixture. Other than that, I couldn't think of any way to make them better. This will be my go-to recipes for parties from now on! Thanks Bob!
