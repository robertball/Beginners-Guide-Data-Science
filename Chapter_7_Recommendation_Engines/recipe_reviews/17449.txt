I'm Indian, and this recipe is pretty darn authentic as far as the ingredients are concerned, with the exception of the bay leaves (we use curry leaves) and the nutmeg. It's nearly identical to how I make chicken curry. The only difference is that I chop up my own tomato, and use less. Also, I've read that some people put green or red bell peppers in their jalfrezis.  "Jalfrezi" incidentally means "dry fry" - the intention is to have a very thick gravy that coats the chicken nicely, as opposed to having a very liquidy sauce. But I guess you can make it whichever way you think tastes better! Oh, and by the way, Indian curries usually don't have "curry powder" in them. It's a common misconception. Happy eating!

This was great!  The only thing I did differently was not haul out the food processor for the paste.  I just chopped onion fine, crushed my garlic with my garlic press, and grated my ginger.  I like heat so I added something similar to cayenne but one could use red pepper flakes if wanting to kick it up a bit.  I added about 1/3 cup chicken broth when adding the chicken to the pan.  I threw in about 1/2 cup chick peas with the tomatoes.  I think adding the broth helped it not be too dry. I served this over basmati rice with peas thrown into the rice.  Very nice easy meal.  This is really a great staple recipe for those of us that have just about every type of spice there is.  I didn't have to run out for any of the ingredients!

I've made this several times now and my husband loves it.  I've followed the advice of others and simmer 45 minutes covered and 45 uncovered.  This recipe as written does not make a lot of sauce, so I have also doubled the tomato and spices with good results.  Easy and delicious.

Very good (and simple) tomato-type curry recipe.  My husband, who normally doesn't like dishes this spicy, loved it.  I will definitely make it again.  

Changes I made: 

I used thinly sliced onions, minced garlic, and finely grated ginger instead of pulverizing them all together.  I fried the onions (along with 4 WHOLE cardamom pods, 4 WHOLE cloves, the cinnamon stick and the bay leaves) until deep golden brown, and then added the garlic and the ginger.  

Note: In my opinion, the success of recipes like this depends on the quality of the chicken.  If the chicken is old and tough, your dining pleasure will be diminished :) I've noticed that these packages of boneless, skinless thighs are often seem to contain chicken of inferior quality.  This recipe would be just as good in my opinion if a good, whole, fresh chicken were cut up into pieces...with the bone left in.

Excellent.  Has a beautiful spicy Indian flavor. May not be that authentic
(?), but was very tasty.   Regarding ingredients, I skipped the food  
processing, instead just cut the onions really really small.  I also used
one can of diced peeled tomatoes (because I couldn't find crushed in the 
right size) and squashed/crushed them myself.  Finally, I used 4-5 chicken
breasts, pressed/cut thinly. Regarding cooking/serving, I cooked (step
three) for 45 minutes covered, then noticed how liquidy the sauce was, and
then for 45 minutes uncovered.  The sauce boiled down to a nice thick very
flavorful paste.  There wasn't enough sauce to serve this over rice or put
extra sauce on rice, but the sauce amply covered the chicken and was
great.  Some reviewers commented that this dish should be mixed with /
served with something else like potatoes.  So, I served it alongside the  
Aloo Phujia (potatoes, onions, and tomatoes) recipe from this site and
that pair worked very well together.

WEll, this was our Valentine dinner tonight.  I've made so many other things this past week, I decided to cook a low maintenance meal.  This took very little time to make and it produced a great meal.  I was tempted to add curry powder to this but didn't because no other reviewer had attempted to do so.  I didn't add the cardamom or cloves because I didn't have either one.  I did add a bit more salt to my liking.  Abby (my 14 month old baby girl) gobbled hers up and my hubby said he liked it as well.  My Nathan had a cheeseburger and was happy with that.  Thanks Karen.

OMG this recipe was sooo tasty. Even though I had to improvise cause I didn't have turmeric (I just used about a teaspoon of curry powder), nor ground cardamom (used 2 whole cardamom pods), and used 1 tsp of cinnamon in place of the stick, it was still the bomb. My husband and I love Indian food and this tasted just like the way our Indian friends make it. Very exotic, and very delicious!

I braised this in the oven for the afternoon. A unigue and flavourful twist for cheap old chicken thighs.  In the future I'll use a combination of boneless skinless thighs and boneless skinless breasts.  I found that I had to drain a lot of fat using just regular thighs. Also, make sure your spices are fresh and aromatic...it makes a big difference in the final product.  Overall, a satisfying meal.

I submitted this recipe.  I am not Indian born (Italian!!) but I have been married to my Indian husband for 23 years.  I learned from the master's hand--his mother!!  Northern Indians use Bay leaves...south Indians use curry leaves, which, by the way are wonderful!

Absolutely Delicious with a couple of "adjustments"  I doubled the spices except the cumin which I tripled and used about a 3" piece of ginger root. I left out the bay leaves and didn't have nutmeg but would have used it if I had it on hand.  I used 6 chicken breasts, 2 cans of tomatoes and added about 2 cups of chicken broth to give it lots of delicious sauce.  I also added chopped fresh cilantro (just because I love it) and a head of cauliflower.  I cooked it all in a slow cooker on high for 5 hours.  A wonderful delicious  Indian "Stew".  Thank you so much for giving me the idea.mmm

mmmmmmmmm yummy AND easy. creates a very authentic curry taste. it wasnt spicy, really, so i added a few hot pepper seeds. Other than that (and omitting nutmeg and adding a touch of sugar and a bit more cinnamon), i followed it exactly. It was easy to put together, and i just left it on the stove for 3-4 hours, uncovering it at the end so the sauce would thicken. Very good served with naan, basmati rice, and indian-style string beans. I will sooooooo make this again.

I have made this recipe dozens of times over the past couple of years since I found it on this website.  I usually make it as written except I use curry leaves instead of bay leaves (doubling the recipe for leftovers at my families request). This recipe is as close as I have ever come to restaurant quality.  Lately I have started adding 1-2 cans of Chic Peas with about 20 minutes left to cook.  It adds a layer of flavor and texture that changes the recipe without compromising the original flavor.  My 2 sons request this with the Chic Peas a couple of times a month. I serve it with high end basmati rice and naan bread.  Lately I also add 1/2 - 1 teaspoon of Cheyenne pepper to up the heat a bit.  I have doubled and tripled the garlic and ginger with success as well.  I don't think you can add too much ginger with this recipe.  Overall, this is a fun recipe to experiment with. Thanks Shecooks2 for this recipe.

I have made this dish several times and have tweaked it a bit each time.  My last revision was our favorite.  I used all the spices but added about 1/8 tsp. more of each, used 6 half chicken breasts, cute into large cubes, added 3/4 can crushed tomatoes (28 oz.), 3/4 can coconut milk.  I cooked 45 minutes covered and 30 minutes uncovered.  When serving, I tossed thawed frozen peas on top along w/some fresh cilantro.

Wow, this is great!
I often add potatoes, carrots, and celery, to make it a one-dish dinner.  I generally use fresh tomatoes instead of canned and simply dice them before adding to the pan, so that they cook down and become part of the sauce.
This freezes well, which is always a bonus in my books.
Thanks for sharing a wonderful recipe!

Very tasty dish! Love the spices in this. A few changes I made: omitted cardamom (didn't have it), used 1 tsp ground cinnamon instead (should have used perhaps 1/2 or 3/4 tsp), grated the onion, garlic and ginger instead of processing it in food processor, used 10 chicken thighs instead and served with chapatti. Oh, also added some cayenne pepper and red pepper flakes as we like our food hot! a very delightful and rich curry-ish dish. Love it and will be making it often!

I have a very similar recipe that is simpler with the spices: cinnamon, cumin, red pepper flakes and salt.  This list is a little intimidating. The recipe I've been using also has like a quarter cup peanut butter stirred in.  It is an amazing addition, that when I don't tell people, they can't identify, but love. So good.

I loved being able to use all these spices and making something very different with chicken. I made this in a slow cooker and it came out very good. Not too strong but had a nice taste. Will make again. Thanks for the recipe!

I cooked for 45 mins covered and 45 mins uncovered. Changed nothing else and it was absolutely delicious. Great blend of flavors and not at all spicy so the whole family could eat.

This was so good!  (I LOVE a filling meal that is low in calories)   I doubled the recipe except for the chicken b/c I knew we'd like the extra sauce and it turned out perfectly when served on a bed of rice.  I did add less nutmeg then called for and didn't have any ginger root on hand so I just sprinkled in some ginger.  A five star recipe!

Nice array of flavors. I prepared this dish with drumsticks and it turned out just fine. Did not have a food processor, so I diced onion very small instead. All the exotic spices created a tasty dish. If you like Indian food that isn't too spicy, give this one a try!!

This is so good! But leave the cinnamon stick whole or you will be biting into small chunks of cinnamon bark. Read through reviews for good suggestions, the most important one is to double the sauce.

Wow, this was outstanding!   Warmly spiced and savory, it's great over rice.  I don't usually like to modify recipes the first time I try them, but I didn't have much choice - happily, this is a very forgiving recipe.  I used a blender since I don't have a food processor, added extra ground cinnamon instead of the cinnamon sticks, used ground ginger (not root), and added a pinch of curry.  I also used chicken breasts cut into large chunks, since I prefer white meat.  Totally scrumptious!!

This is a fantastic recipe! I did modify it a bit as some recommended but was no less pleased with the result. For starters, I did not use bay leaf or nutmeg in mine. I did add chopped green/red bell pepper, twice the tomatoes, and 3-4 dried chilis for heat, and adjusted the spices to taste. I cooked 45 covered, 45 uncovered and had a lovely thick sauce to go with. I served mine with a simple saffron rice with peas and carrots mixed in along with naan. I think the only thing I will try different next time is to use lamb as the meat. Otherwise, thanks for a great recipe!

This was sooo good! My family loved it! I would have to say this was the first Indian dish I have ever made and it turned out perfect. I only made a couple of little changes first i used dried ginger instead of the fresh and also I only made it with 4 thighs instead of 6 i think it worked out perfect because it left the perfect amount of sauce to have with the rice i stacked it on. I WILL make it again! Thanks :)

I followed as closely as I could, only subbing ground cinammon for the cinammon stick and diced tomatoes instead of peeled whole. My family RAVED about this dish. And the leftovers are even better the next day.

I swear, this is the only Indian food I can cook and not end up with a yucky tasting mess.  It is so good.  Let it cook for a couple of hours to get the meat tender.  I love it with boneless chicken breasts and always serve it with Indian Spiced Rice that was  posted by Jen.

This was my first time making anything even remotely Indian, and when it was done, it tasted just like what I have had in restaurants.  I loved it.  I used drumsticks instead of thighs because that is what I had, and once cooked and chopped up in the sauce, it was delicious.  Served it with basmati rice and naan.  It could easily be adapted for vegetarians by using chick peas and/or cauliflower instead of the chicken and cooking for a much shorter time.  I will definitely make this again.

Yum-yum-yum!!!  This is very good!  I tripled the sauce, and double-and-a-half-ed the chicken by using a "club pack" of chicken thighs so that we would have lots of leftovers.  Next time I would reduce the cardamom a bit... I found it was quite a prominent taste.  Also, I may try adding a bit of coconut milk to it, just to see how it tastes.  Thanks for a yummy recipe!

WOWWEE~ could we please have more than 5 stars? Absolutely delicious and not too time consuming to make - just let it simmer and make the rice about half an hour before it's done. I made a batch of the spice mix so next time, I can just measure out spices and GO! Also next time, I'll put a few more thighs in the sauce for left-overs. (Each thigh is 3 points on W*W.)

I live for Indian food this recipe is superb.  What else ya got!!  :-)  Thanks for sharing this!  I have made it several times now, each time pretty much as written with two very small exceptions: 1. I add a bit of Indian chili for heat and 2. I use curry leaf instead of bay leaf but only because I had some left over from another recipe, dried it, and was looking for things to do with it and SHECOOKS2 mentioned in a review of her own that it is used in southern India instead of bay leaf.  Also, I make sure to use San Marzano tomatoes. Otherwise, I have no idea why anyone would mess with this masterpiece!

I browned my skinless, boneless chicken thighs in 1 1/2 tbsp of extra virgin olive oil then set aside first.  I like the pieces of chicken bits and juices added to my dish.  I didn't make a paste, but rather a sauce of browned onion and Baby Portobello mushrooms then added 4 cloves of garlic, 2 tsp of powdered ginger, 1 tsp of garam masala, 1/4 tsp of cinnamon, 1/4 tsp of cayenne, and 28 ozs of crushed tomatoes.  After the sauce simmered for 10 minutes, I added my cooked chicken thighs to merge all the good flavors of the spices and tomatoes with the meat as the sauce thickened.  Served with basmati rice and garnished with chives, black olives, and cherry tomatoes.  It was an "Out of This World Meal" which earned me the prized and golden Stamp of Approval (SOA) from Mi Gato Loco.

This was a great recipe. I wanted more sauce so I made the following changes:
Doubled everything EXCEPT cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg and bay leaves. Since I doubled the onions, I sliced one and sauted until slightly browned. The other onion I diced into the paste. I used 3 chicken breasts instead of chicken thighs. For the tomatoes, I crushed one can of whole tomatoes and then added a can of diced tomatoes. I have a Rometopf clay oven, so after everything was sauted together, I poured the recipe into the clay oven and cooked 45 minutes covered, and 45 minutes uncovered. 
This dish would be fantastic with shrimp, as well. Just don't add shrimp until last bit to avoid them being rubbery. Great recipe, this is a keeper!

This was amazing. I used ground ginger & cinnamon, as I did not have fresh on hand. I also used allspice and nutmeg in place of the cardamom. It came out absolutely perfect, and I will definitely try it again with the recommended ingredients. I served this with green beans, steamed from frozen and tossed in the remaining sauce.

This was very good and I will definitely make it again.  However, I did think it was lacking something...not entirely sure what though.  I may try a little curry next time.  This is definitely a good recipe that can be embellished upon.

This is absolutely delicious!  Beautiful flavors...I didn't change a thing - though I did not use a slow cooker.  Just prepared in a large sauce pan.  And cooked covered for on low for an hour.  The chicken was so tender.  Do not skip the food processor step - I served with Basmati rice and the family loved it.  I would definitely make this again.

Lick-the-plate good. I lived around someone from Pakistan for a few years who always made this type of chicken from memory (just threw stuff in) and this tastes closer to it than any restaurant I've ever been to. Yum!

This is a fantastic recipe! I followed it quite closely, with only a few modifications. Like others, I did not process the onion, garlic and ginger, and instead just diced them very finely. I also used powdered cinnamon instead of a stick. Instead of whole canned tomatoes I used freshly diced tomatoes and added some (maybe 1/2 cup) plain tomato sauce. Lastly, I added about 1/2 cup of very finely chopped cashews to thicken the sauce and give it a bit more texture. SO GOOD! Yum.

This was perfect!  Processing the onion mixture added to the saucy texture, and as I only had a 28oz can of tomatoes, I used the whole thing.  That was perfect because it diluted the spices enough that my family couldn't complain it was too spicy.  It also left enough sauce to scoop up with the naan!  Iwill try it with cut up chicken bits next time because the thighs looked so lonely... thanks for the recipe, it's a keeper!

This is a great "base" for a great dish.  I did make changes, as did many others.  My Husband is from Kerala India, so instead of using bay leaves, I used curry leaves.  I sliced some small green chilis to add some heat.  Also, I didn't grind the onions, but did a fine chop.  I did use the dark thigh meat (boneless) since it has a better flavor with indian cooking.  I think the last change was to chop some cilantro about 1/4 cup and added it towards the end.  Someone had mentioned that thie dish was missing something, I found that too and the cilantro was it by my taste.    Thanks for sharing!!!

I made this for dinner tonight.   It is an excellent recipe although I made some changes.   I used garam masala instead of buying cardamon, tumeric and nutmeg. When I tasted it, it tasted a bit too tangy tomato and it was not hot enough for me so I added 1 teaspoon of chili powder and 1 teaspoon of sugar to neutralise the tanginess. Now, it tasted quite similar to the chicken at our favourite banana leaf southern Indian restaurant back home in Singapore.  My husband loved it although our apartment now smells like an Indian restaurant! Hahaha...  We will definitely be cooking this again.

Made this for dinner a few nights ago because I was in the mood for something different. I really liked this, followed the recipe EXACTLY. It had lots of flavor and I liked all the spices used. It ended up being a kind of a pricey meal because I hardly had any of the ingredients. I will make this again on a special occasion like a celebration dinner, but its a little out of my price range at the moment to make regularly. Thanks for the recipe, it was VERY tasty.

I can't tell you how many times I've made this wonderful dish! It is now a staple in my house. I make it exactly as written, except I usually use 8 thighs (I buy them from Costco & they come 4 per package). Because of the extra pieces, I add a bit extra of all spices and a small can of tomato sauce for extra liquid. I prefer a creamy texture to my sauce, so at the end of the cooking time I remove the bay leaves and cinnamon and use my stick blender to puree most of the sauce - you can do it right in the pan, just move the chicken to the side. It also helps incorporate the excess oil that floats to the top. Oh, and if you have a small 'bullet' type blender, it is perfect for making the onion/garlic/ginger paste.

This is quite possibly THE best thing I have ever eaten in my life.  The depth of flavor is incredible.  I used boneless skinless thighs and served this with jasmine rice and a baby carrot/baby pea medley.  None of us could stop saying mm, mm, mm -- we were all reduced to babbling babies, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm.  :-)

I added a half Teaspoon of chiili flakes to give it some bite. I may try adding 
some tomato paste next time! Was very tasty and once everything was assembled was really 
quite easy.

This recipe is a keeper!

I liked this a lot. I followed the recipe with the exception of not having cardamom. I heard you can use equal part cinnamon and nutmeg. It would have been even better if I actually used a food processor. Very good recipe, thank you!!

Fantastic!! I am not a "spicy" person, so was hesitant.  The flavors are amazing.  I follow the recipe as written and wouldn't change a thing.  Even my 5 year old granddaughter loves this meal.  It has now become a favorite request of all family members.

I didn't have cardamom, so left it out; only had powdered ginger so used that.  I didn't process the onion and spices into a paste.  It still tasted great - very similar to an Indian restaurant dish!  I used boneless, skinless chicken thighs and loved the result, served over basmati rice.

We really liked this - very different than things we've had before.

I did make changes - used a large tin of crushed tomatoes and added some water since they are thick (I realized that this is essentially much more tomato though than the recipe called for - I wanted lots of left over sauce, which I have). Added a bit more cumin and turmeric, as well as about a teaspoon of curry powder. Added on hot chile for some heat too.

I've never attempted Indian food before, but we really enjoyed this recipe. I served it over rice.  It was different. I omitted the cardemon as I didn't have it on hand. I used chicken breasts cut in half instead of thighs and it came out super tender. I did cook it the recommended 2 hours.  Even my pick toddlers ate it.

my husband and i love it. the ingredients are in the cupboard, it's simple, easy and a joy to smell simmering away. i also tried it with beef, and although not as good as chicken, still a make again recipe. the heat is just enough for the beginner curry fan; the spices warm and rich.

This was good. I probably needed to let it simmer longer (I was in a bit of a hurry), but the flavors and spices were definitely a good combination. My husband said it smelled like an Indian restaurant when he walked in the kitchen. I guess that's a good sign!

The only things I did differently were to just throw in the onion, garlic and ginger (didn't process them), and I added about 2/3 of a can of tomato sauce as it looked like the chicken was going to be a little dry. Also fiddled around with the spices til it was how we like it. All in all this was an easy, tasty and inexpensive meal. Served it over basmati rice with paratha. Would have been nice with some fresh cilantro sprinkled on top. Thanks!

I made the most bootleg version of this recipe imaginable and it was still awesome. I am going to make it again tomorrow after a stock-up trip at the Indian market. No turmeric, no cardamom, no cloves and only jarred garlic, ground cinnamon and ginger and nutmeg and dry minced onion (pathetic, I know, I didn't even have an onion in the house).  Plus I used chicken drumsticks instead of thighs.  And I repeat, it was still good.  And the house smelled absolutely dreamy while it cooked. I can't wait to try the real thing! EDITED TO ADD: Made it the "right" way yesterday. Unbelievable. By the way I added a whole can of crushed tomatoes (28 oz) to 8 thighs and it was still perfect - a little saucier than last time, but I hated to waste the extra half-can of tomatoes.

Stumbled across this recipe looking for a chicken curry dish. Amazingly, this recipe  does not even contain curry! It has become one of my favorite recipes to make for company because it smells great cooking, is easy to prep prior to a guest's arrival, and is truly delicious. I serve it over white sticky rice.  Great recipe!

I made this without the bay leaf, and used fresh tomaotoes and dried ginger because it was what I had on hand.  I also used cayenne pepper instead of pabrika.  I think this is what made this dish fantastic because it was so hot and spicy!  It tasted better than what you get in an Indian restaurant.

This was really good and easy. I couldn't find the ground cardamom, so made it without. I added a little water from the tomato can, before it started simmering... and let it go for about 1-1/2 hours. It was perfect. At first, my husband and I thought it was just good... and then the addictive quality took over. We finished the whole pot in one night.

Delicious, has a wonderful curry flavor - much better than most pre-mixed curry powders have. The sauce went really well with rice (though if I were cooking for more than 2 people, I would increase the amount of crushed tomato to make more sauce). The only changes I made were: I used one tsp. of cinnamon instead of a stick, I used powdered ginger instead of fresh, and I added the bay leaves when I added the tomatoes (so as not to have little bits of broken bay leaf throughout the sauce). Very good recipie, and it smells terrific while it's cooking.

This was pretty good.  I love Indian food and this deffinately hit the spot.  The only thing I did differently, was instead of letting it simmer for 1-2 hours on the stove top, I put it in my slow cooker just before I added the tomatoes and let it cook all day.  I served it with Basmati rice, naan, and a mango lassi.  Very good and Very easy.  Next time I think I'll try adding some potatoes.

Prepared this for dinner last night.  The effort in the beginning of the recipe was well worth the complex layering of flavors.  I used a larger size of tomatoes and had a bit more sauce, which was promptly gobbled up.  I was amazed that I had all the spices needed.

I have eaten a lot of pakistani and indian chicken dishes.  I am from the US, so the dishes always seemed so exotic and too difficult to do myself.  
This recipe is easy!  And still tastes really good without the cardamom(I didn't have any)!
     My family kept asking for more!  Even my husband is not so stuck to fried chicken (and that is a BIG change).

Absolutely divine!  I used boneless/skinless thighs, and it's even better as it sits for leftovers.  Great complex flavors and relatively healthy and low fat.  I'll make this on a regular basis.

On the advice of some reviewers I made twice the sauce. In retrospect, it probably wasn’t necessary. My wife and I thought that there was something off in the spice balance, maybe too much clove or nutmeg but we couldn’t put our finger on it.  Since I can’t figure out what was wrong, I don’t think I’ll be trying again.

I will definately be making this again. I wanted something different to try and this recipe appealed to me. I found the blend of flavors were a perfect mix. The spices all complimented one another without overpowering each other. I served over basmati rice with a side salad of mixed greens, pineapple chunks, red onion, feta and a shallot vinegarette. It was a delicious meal! Thank you.

Our family loves this dish! Perfect with garlic naan and basmati rice. Our kids love the sauce so I usually double the tomatoes and spices. For a meatless version we omit the chicken and add chickpeas at that time instead, perfect either way!!

I'm a novice cook but wanted to make something different for me and my boyfriend. He loved it and said it was his favorite thing I've ever made, and he is a big fan of Indian food. I found it very easy, and mostly followed the recipe as written. Cooked for 45 minutes covered, 1 hour uncovered. I thought it was a lot easier to throw the onion, garlic and ginger in a food processor instead of cutting it all up by hand. I did go heavy on the spices (rounded measuring spoons) and didn't have cardamom so I just left it out. It made a delicious sauce that we scooped up with basmati rice and naan.

Very Good!! I followed the recipe pretty closely with a couple of exceptions.  Like some of the others who have reviewed this recipe, I didn't bother using my food processor to make a paste out of the onions and garlic, I just diced them very fine.  The other thing I did was substitute 1 tsp dry ground Ginger for the fresh ginger root, and 1 tsp ground cinnamon for the cinnamon stick. I was a little concerned that the amount of sauce wouldn't be enough and the meat would come out dry, but as it simmered the juices from the chicken came out and added to the sauce. It came out very flavorful and the meat was fall-off-the-bone tender!!! I will definitely make it again!

I've made this several times and have only tweaked the recipe a tiny bit.  I use 2 whole, fresh tomatoes instead of a can and have served it over brown rice or with naan.  I leave out the bay leaf and added more clove and nutmeg, but that's just personal opinion.  An excellent recipe!

Sorry but this was not to our liking. None of the spices came through. I simmered it for a long time and still it was not what I had hoped for. Will not try again.

I always grind my own spices. I didn't use anywhere near the amount of tomatoes suggested.  I also put in a chilli instead of pepper.  Curries are usually rather hot. I liked it well enough.  Served with plain rice.

Flavor wasn't bad, but nowhere near the level that the spices hinted at while it cooked.  A decent meal, but not in the ballpark if your family prefers things spicier.

Oh my goodness!! My husband loves Indian food and he gives this recipe 5 stars! I'm not a fan of Indian food normally but this chicken is delicious! I served it with homemade Nan, white rice and sliced English cucumber. Will definitely make it again. Thank you for posting!

The taste of this dish is fantastic.  I appreciate how you can vary the consistency of the sauce when using (or not using) a cover on your dish.  Will make again!

Made it work with what I had. Used 5 diced tomatoes instead of canned. Did not use nutmeg added some paprika instead for color. I used drumsticks instead of thighs. It was delicious!

I don't have a food processor, so; I sauteed the chopped onion, garlic, and ground ginger in the oil (I didn't use whole ginger root). I followed the rest of the directions to a T, and; it came out delicious! There was none left and this is now in regular rotation. I like that the chopped onion and garlic added more texture to the dish. This is a keeper for sure!

It was just OK. The chicken could definitely benefit from salting before cooking. I took other reviewers' advice and cooked 45 min covered and 45 uncovered, the sauce consistency was perfect this way. Probably would not make again.

Surprised there was some heat to this but it was still mild enough for the kids.  made as specified except without the cardamom since i didn't have any.  still flavorful.  Will try again with cardamom as this may make it perfect.  easy to prepare.  just threw everything into the crockpot on high for a few hours and turned down to low.

Giving this 5 stars based on the changes made (although not many). We took 2 chicken breasts chopped into 1" cubes and cooked as per directions. Added 1/2 can of water after mixing in the diced tomatoes. Added 1 tsp or so of red curry paste for some heat. Simmered for 1/2 hour (until rice was cooked) then tossed in 20 prawns 10 minutes prior to serving. Served over a combination of basmati and Aztec Blend rice.

I used chicken breast instead of chicken thighs. I also used fresh tomatoes from the garden. Other than that I followed the recipe perfectly. It was delicious.

I didn't even have all of the spices necessary, I had to substitute chicken breast for legs, and diced tomatoes for crushed, and it still turned out great! Thanks for sharing this recipe!

FANTASTIC! Didn't have cardamom but didn't miss it.  We thought the sauce was slightly bitter from all of the spices, so we took an unconventional route and added a big scoop of apricot preserves.  WOW!  Definitely a keeper; thanks for sharing!

Very, very good.  I used about 1.5 chicken breasts, but next time I'll use 2.  Super healthy and I served it over brown rice with spices!  Yum.  Medium spicey-ness.  Serve with yogurt if too spicey.

I have made a similar dish before with half and half instead of the tomatoes, this version was much healthier.  Great left over dish to take to work, will definitely make again!

I always try to make a recipe 'as written' the first time..however, I was making another dish that called for '4oz coconut milk' and that left me with 8oz of extra milk to deal with. I added the coconut milk to this recipe and not only did it give me some extra sauce to put over the rice, the hint of coconut was an added plus.  A few spinkles of fresh corriender on top.....wow GREAT RECIPE! Thank you

I felt this dish was very bland compared to other Indian dishes I've made in the past.  I would certainly "doctor it up" by adding cayenne pepper to the dish to give it more heat.

This dish was heavenly.  It calls for whole, peeled tomatoes, crushed.......I used a can of crushed tomatoes that didn't say "whole", and followed the recipe exactly as posted. The consistency of the sauce was just wonderful, all of the spices were divine, and my whole family loved it, including my 2 1/2 year-old grandson who kept begging for more sauce! This will definitely go into our rotation!

Very authentic, but decrease salt to 1/2 tsp!  I didn't add anything to this to make it spicy, but I can see where that would be great for those that like some kick.  My 4 year old son liked the chicken and my husband who eats a lot of Indian food really liked it as well.  I served it with saffron yellow rice and peas, yum.  I will add this to my Indian recipes for sure.

I made this in the crockpot and the only thing I did different was to use boneless/skinless chicken breasts instead.  It was VERY good!  The spices are a blast scentation in your mouth with every bite!  My family loved it!  The next time I made it I added a diced carrots & celery to have more veggies.  Still super!

This recipe is wonderful. I did, however, make the following changes...based solely on what I had...  I used garlic powder equivalent to 4 cloves.  I also used ground ginger.  I threw that in the blender with the onion and made a paste.  I used ground cinnamon, diced tomatoes, and cut up chicken breasts.  Those changes I really can't see changing the flavor of the recipe...as they are all the same ingredients...just a different form.  The only thing I left out was the cardamom...because I didn't have any.

This dish had a lot of flavor, and the chicken was very tender, but it was not spicy enough for my taste.  A generous wallop of Sriracha was added at our table.  The hubs loved it, though, so I'll be making this again.

Good stuff- & pretty easy. Took the lazy way & just chopped the onions. Used 1 t. jarred mashed ginger (like garlic also comes) & 1 t. cinnamon. Used breasts & petite diced tomatoes. Also added 1/2 c. water after the first hour since it was pretty dry- & I kept it covered the whole time. At first, it seemed too spicy, but that was only the first bite. The chicken is moist & very flavorful- even after scraping off the tomato mixture for my 8 year old!! (who did eat it all, by the way!) I chose this for low carb. Thanks!

So much flavor in such a simple dish! Perfect for company with white rice and maybe sweet potatoes  on the side. Only change I've made is to use a can of diced tomatoes instead of whole.

I opted to mince the onion and garlic by hand instead of dragging out the processor.  This was a lot of work up front, along with pulling together all of the spices, but with a very good outcome!  The meat was very tender and tasty.  I did have to keep adding more olive oil though, because it got very dry 1) when I added all of the spices, and 2) when I added the chicken.  One reviewer said to add broth when adding the chicken...that might be a good idea.  Whether I will make this again, I do not know, but it was very good.

This dish was just not what I thought it would be.  I traveled all over India in a 2 month span and had some awesome food there, and I was hoping this would take me back to those days.  But sadly, it was nothing special. Just didn't taste authentic to me.

I was a little disappointed by my fiance's reaction to this meal.  He liked the flavor, but felt that something beyond sauce + chicken was needed . . . recommended potatoes or peas.  I would have to agree. The only change I made was using 1 t cinnamon (no sticks around) 

Will try again with the potatoes and peas, and this recipe is definately a keeper!  I suspect that the changes will make this a 5-star recipe for me.

This recipe is truely awsome.  I was looking for a recipe to wow my Indian boyfriend and it certainly did.  He went back for three helpings.  He loved it.  I followed the recipe exactly and served it with rice.  I know that he will be asking when I can make it again.  I loved it too and there were no leftovers either.

Made this for dinner, it was good, but not excellent.  Didn't have cardommon, but I doubt that would've made a difference.  As a matter of fact, with all the fancy spices, it still tasted like curry to me, I don't think there would be much a difference in flavor if you just used curry alone.  Anyhow, I used 1/2 1/2 tomato sauce/h2o and added peas and diced potatoes.  Served with rice and bread and it was good, also good by itself.  Can't really imagine this tasting that good w/o the tots and peas.

This is a great, easy recipe, taste was not too hot and just spicy enough for a great winter meal. I also added chunks of potatoes and frozen peas about 30 mins before the end of cooking time. Turned out hearty and tasty.

This tasted great. My husband and I both loved it! Instead of all the spices, I just added premixed curry spice - I couldn't find my turmeric :-) also I added extra tomatoes. Thanks for the recipe. I will be making this again.

My rating is based on my preparation so it's not an entirely fair rating but I wouldn't take the time to prepare the recipe according to the directions.  I dumped all the ingredients into the crock pot (used dehydrated onion and boneless, skinless chicken breasts).  I thought this was pretty good but my husband didn't care for it.  This would've turned out much better had I sauteed the spices.

I finally made this recipe after looking at it for months and it was a huge hit. Rich complex flavors and a true Indian taste. My five year old didn't like the flavor but the rest of us really enjoyed every bite.

My husband doesn't usually like chicken other than chicken breast, but this recipe
was so flavourful and moist that he ate 3 pieces.  I served it with red beans and rice
but a salad would also be complementary.  It is quite spicy (not hot) so you don't want
to serve anything that might be overpowering.

Flavors are interesting in a non-traditional Indian meal. A lot of prep required before actually turning on the slow cooker and forgetting about it.

Delicious recipe.   The chicken was extremely tender.  I made it exactly as the recipe stated.  I found the instructions on the tomatoes to be somewhat confusing though.  I  ended up blending a can of whole tomatoes, to get "crushed" tomatoes.   It seemed to work out fine.

Ok but not craveable, easy to pull together.  It needed something--added a sprinkle of garam masala but still missing something

How wonderful  to be able to make Indian food at home!   I used 4  chicken thighs with skin  and added frozen soup veggie mix.  I sautéed the chicken in the paste, added the  remaining ingredients, and poured it over the frozen veggies in my crockpot. I cooked it on low  for about 6 hours  and then served it with basmati rice. The slow cooker made the chicken velvety soft and  kept the sauce from drying out. Going to have it again for lunch today because it’ll be even better!

This turned out great in my book. Didn't use chicken thighs but used breat cut into larger chunks. Otherwise, changed nothing. A tip I will use next time is to puree the tomatoes. One can didn't seem to be enough and the tomatoes didn't breakdown the way I wanted them to. Just a few seconds in the blender or processor would be good. 
I didn't hear a lot of compliments on the dinner from the family. But they don't care a lot for ANYTHING with curry or indian spices. The other side is, they didn't complain either.

Made it many times, it is wonderful how it is. If I make it in the slow cooker, I omit cooking the garlic, onion, and ginger and just add it to the pot. Very yummy still. Works best with fresh items, but that's true with most things.

I made the recipe exactly the way it was.
What I liked about it was that it was fast to make.  
The taste was ok.
I've made another recipe called, "slow cooker butter chicken" and loved the flavor of it.

We loved this recipe. I used chicken breast instead and cooked until done, not the hours recommend. The spice mixture was nice and easy. Makes great leftovers too, if you're lucky enough to have some.

Loved the exotic flavor and it was easy to make!  Added an extra tablespoon of olive oil because the pan got a little dry before putting the spices, chicken and tomatoes in.

This was great! It may even be one of the best things I have ever eaten, and I do not say that often. This is the second Indian dish I have ever had (first was Curry Stand Chicken Tikka Masala; AllRecipes), and I am even more impressed with Indian food after this. I used 1 1/4t salt and 1t cinnamon as suggested and only two breasts and the sauce was a good amount, so I can see why it should be doubled for the 6 thighs as written. It also works with 1/8t ginger instead of the slice. I used chopped onion and minced garlic instead of the paste.

Delicious!  Perfectly spiced, just a little "exotic" tasting, without being too spicy. One of our favorite slow cooker recipes (and we make A LOT of slow cooker recipes).  We cut the chicken into chunks and make this into a stew that we serve over rice.  That makes it easier to put individual servings into plastic containers that we stick in the freezer for later use.  So easy, too!

The flavors and the aroma were in a perfect harmony, but it definitely was missing something. Like it needed extra salt or something I can't put my finger on it.  Maybe some peas cooked into it would kick up the flavor,  I don't know but it's a great starter

I used four leg quarters cut up into 8 pieces and double the sauce and spices!  Used crushed tomato (28oz can) .  The only ingredient I didn't gave was cardamom and it still turned out fantastic!  I steamed the chicken for 3 hours, add 1/2 cup non fat Greek yogurt towards the last 30 minutes.  Delicious on white rice or with bread!

Agree with other reviewers who didn't have/use a food processor - finely chopped the onion, ginger,, and garlic and stirred together and it still turned out great!! I used boneless skinless chicken breasts and added extra tomatoes.

I made this exactly as written except that I used chicken legs (rather than thighs), and about 20 minutes before serving I removed the legs from the sauce, sliced the chicken off the bones, and put the chicken back into the sauce.

While this smelled wonderful while cooking, it wasn't all that great in the eating.  I think it needs more spice, something to give it a bit more flavor. Even with all the spices here, about all we tasted was tomato and chicken..

Lovely!All of the taste and none of the 'heat' you can get in even the mildest curries. Did make more sauce so had enough to put in the freezer for the next time.
I used chicken pieces and once cooked took the meat off so no messy bones left on the plates, so maybe chicken breasts would work just a well
Thank you.

Very good basic recipe. I felt something was lacking when I finished and after reading other reviews, I added cilantro and coconut milk.

Excellent!  Followed the recipe exactly, but used 1/4t cinnamon and an extra cut up tomato from my garden.  Served with long grain rice and store-bought naan.

Wonderful! I made this dish last week for the first time, and I have already made it again. Great flavor. I add one red or orange bell pepper cut in medium slices. Also it is great to double the recipe and freeze it for later!

Excellent, tastes just like the Chicken Jalfrezi at my favorite Indian Restaurant. Instead of using a food processor, I followed another reviewer's recommendation and finely chopped the onions, grated the ginger, and crushed the garlic. Only other thing I changed was used half the amount of black pepper (I don't like things TOO spicy), and added some chopped red bell pepper. Delicious!

Great Dish!  I added curry, and omitted the nutmeg and it was still delicious.  Instead of canned tomatoes I chopped in fresh and just eyed all the other ingredients. Also added a bit more salt.  Yummy and easy!

I found this lacking in flavor. As is, it tasted like stewed chicken with tomatoes.  I multiplied all the spices and added chili powder, yogurt, a little garam masala, and a small potato.  It saved the dish, but I would not make again.

Normally I'm not a big fan of tomato + meat, but this was delicious.  Made the recipe pretty much as given, but used diced tomatoes since that was what was on hand.  Amped up the heat ever so slightly with 1/4 tsp of Kashmiri Mirch (red chili powder) and served on brown rice.  Again...just wonderful; thanks for the recipe,.

This recipe was really delicious and easy to make. I cubed chicken breasts into smaller pieces and it cooked for about an hour and was tender and so fragrant. The entire house smelled wonderful. This just might become a staple in our house - thank you for the recipe!

I thought this was very good, but my family thought it had a little too many spices.  I suggest cutting back on the spices just a little... maybe put 2/3 or 3/4 of the amount of each spice in.  It was very tasty, though.

This recipe looks really great and I'm excited to try it.  I'm wondering if this is our Indian "Karhai Chicken", and if so, authentically onion is excluded from the ingredients, and the meat is stir-fried half-way through the simmer time on high heat in the tomato-base, then simmered until the oil and sauce separate.  At the end it is garnished with cilantro.

Outstanding! I quartered the thighs and it was cooked in  an hour. We like spicy food, so I added another 1/2 tsp each white and red pepper.

I made this after having been unsuccessful on my own with making Indian food. The spice measurements here are spot on, and provide the right flavor combo that has gotten favorable approval from several of my "from India" Indian co-workers.

For the last hour of cooking, I uncovered to thicken the sauce.
