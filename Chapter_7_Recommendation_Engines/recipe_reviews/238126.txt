My husband made this and it was delicious!  He did add more chicken broth to it, as was suggested by someone else. Plus, we didn't have "bone-in chicken," so he just used boneless skinless chicken breasts (2), and browned them first in the pan, then followed the recipe. We also didn't have "fresh" rosemary, so we used dry.  It was really yummy!

We loved the vegetables. The chicken was good. I used extra chicken broth and I also used bone in chicken breasts. Be careful not to over bake this or it will come out dry.  I would check the chicken at 30 minutes and 5 minutes after that until the thermometer reads 165º.

Totally impressed the family with this. I did add some sliced fresh garlic and chopped shallots to brown in the butter before the chicken went in,  and I used a bag of mixed munchkin potatoes, cut in half (instead of large potatoes). After the vegetables and spices went in, I poured 1 cup of chicken broth over it all and let simmer, covered. About 40 minutes later, the chicken was done and I removed it to a covered casserole so that I could cook down the vegetables and broth a bit to thicken the "gravy". The chicken was juicy and tender, and the "au jus" added a great touch to pour over it all. My husband, who is a fan of dark meat because he says white meat is always dry, went back for seconds.

Both my husband and I thought this was great, especially if you add chicken broth when you add in the veggies, as others suggested.  And, bone-in and skin-on chicken is what made this soooo moist!  Also, the cooking time mentioned is definitely too long.  Fortunately, I put in a meat thermometer - the kind that has a cord attached to it, so you can still close the lid, and, an alarm will go off when it reaches the right temperature.  It only took about 20 minutes, and, it was so moist and perfect.  Also, honestly, just use whatever seasonings you typically like on meat and vegetables - that's what I did.  I would also say that 4 potatoes are too many, unless they are very small potatoes.  You have two pieces of chicken, so, this is a meal for two people.  You only need enough veggies for two, and, there's no way my husband and I each would eat two whole potatoes.  I also added chopped onions to the veggies, because we like them...

I will make this again and again! It is key to use chicken breasts with the skin still on.  The veggies were to die for! And best yet, it is simple to throw together, without much of a mess. (Easy clean up.)  I put my meat thermometer in at 45 minutes and the chicken was at 190 degrees--  ooops.  I'll check way earlier next time.

I needed a bone in chicken recipe and this one caught my eye. Im so glad best choice i could of made. So simple and flavourful. My family loved this. I also added some chicken broth as others suggested and it just made everything come together nicely. It's now on our regular meal plan. Thank you for the great recipe.

This is awesome. Only addition I made was to add small amt chicken broth to the pan after adding the veggies. They really pick up the flavor.

Cast iron skillet. Make the recipe exactly as stated but do it in a cast iron skillet Yum Yum Yum no need to add broth. Halfway through add about a half a cup of Chardonnay.

This was just ok for me. I will admit I did not use bone in chicken, just sliced boneless chicken breast, but it was more the flavor I wasn't impressed with than anything else. I might try this again, but vary the spices quite a bit. There just wasn't anything special about it, IMHO, and I could tell my husband was unimpressed (although he'd never tell me as much, ha!)

I always tenderize the chicken with citrus and salt and pepper for about 1/2- 1 hr before Pan frying. This makes a big difference.  I baked it for only 1/2 hr.  It was delicious

This has become one of my rotating meals. It's good comfort food and easy to make. followed the other reviewers and added chicken broth on top of the veggies while cooking. Prob 1/2 to 1 cup, don't want too wet potatoes.

This was really good and very quick to throw together! I used boneless/skinless chicken breasts, bagged baby carrots, and petite red potatoes to make it even easier. The seasoning on the veggies was so tasty that my kids ate them happily. I started this on the stove in my cast iron dutch oven and finished covered in the oven at 350.

My family loved this! Only changes I made: onion powder instead of garlic powder (because I didn't have garlic powder on hand) and 1 cup of chicken broth added with the vegetables. My chicken breasts were a little over 1 lb each. 30 minutes was all it took to cook everything to perfection. This recipe will be added to our regular rotation!

Made a couple of changes - left out celery and replaced with a quartered onion.  Salted and peppered the chicken first, and added broth to make a gravy.  Thickened it a little at the end with a corn starch slurry.  Was very good!  Printed Dec 1/15.

I will make this again!! I used boneless skinless breasts and swapped onion for the celery but besides that followed it. Cook time was 30 min. I did NOT add any additional liquid- no need too. I'll cut some of the butter next time, there was a ton. I really liked the texture of the carrots- perfect. My husband and oldest son really liked this too. Great reciepe. It was nice to have a hands-off skillet meal.

I will definitely make this again. It was so easy and tasty. Had house guests and they loved it. I did add some chicken broth to it. (3/4 cup approx)
I prepped the seasonings and veggies the day before so putting it together was so quick. 
Used boneless, skinned chicken breasts. Butterflied the thick breasts so all were about the same thickness for cooking purposes. .

Great recipe. Had dark meat in freezer for the Greek chicken recipe so used that. Used dried herbs and about half cup chicken broth. Chicken and veggies came out moist and delicious! This one is a keeper...

This  was very good. I also used boneless chicken breasts. There was quite a bit of broth so I thickened it with a little flour and water and the gravy turned out tasty. The carrots and potatoes were perfect - still a little crisp and crunchy. Thanks IronWB

I will definitely make it again. Probably would have been good making it as recipe states but, I used boneless and skinless chicken. I didn't use lemon grass just fresh lemon juice. I used dried herbs. The chicken was very moist  and had  a nice subtle lemon flavor. I will make it again and probably the same as the first time. I don't get in the habit of buying fresh expensive herbs

Very easy to fix and clean up afterwards, and it is delicious! I seared chicken breasts in light olive oil, added butter when turning and tossed 1/4 cup of white Moscato into the pan and it still worked out perfectly. The fresh herbs really make this recipe outstanding.

I had to modify it for fat and salt. I used 1tbs of butter and olive oil to brown chicken. I did use pepper, small amt of regular salt, smoked paprika and onion powder for seasonings. Seasoned chicken before browning. Tossed veggies with seasonings and olive oil. Did add unsalted chicken stock. Loved it. Thx for the recipe.

The veggies were good but the chicken was just plain chicken.

I liked it. I didn’t have lemon thyme but it was delicious anyway. I used a meat thermometer so it wouldn’t be over cooked

This recipe was so easy and delicious! So much flavor! I did add extra broth because we love sauce on our chicken!

Simple, easy, tasty dish! I modified a few things; added chicken broth, butter, basil & oregano, and used chicken strips instead.
We were expecting guest so I didn’t want to cook it right away and didn’t want to work on it while they were here. So after chopping all the veggies I mixed all the seasonings in,
Then browned the strips and put them and all the veggies in a casserole dish. When guest arrived I added broth some butter and put in the oven at 400 for 40 minutes. Came out perfect!

Prepared it exactly according to the recipe, was very tasty.  The vegetables were done perfectly.  This is unbelievably quick and easy to make, then just set your timer and walk away.  I did not have to add any liquid, mind you I did keep the pan covered the entire cooking time.  I will definitely make this again.

The flavors in the veggies were much better with the suggestion of chicken stock. I used sweet potatoes as someone suggested. Next time I think I am going to cut the potatoes bigger because they became a bit mushy. I will definitely be making this again

I added an Asian Stir Fry Sauce, after I browned the chicken breasts.  I finished cooking the chicken breasts in the oven.   The recipe turned out  super delicious.  I would make it again with my changes.  Also instead of rosemary, I added a sprinkle of curry which was my husbands suggestion,

Like a lot of others, I added a cup of water. I used the leftovers to make soup for a Pot Luck. I added more of the same vegetables and some onions to the leftover meat. Because of the browning process the broth was awesome. They all wanted to know what I used for broth and I said it was home made.

I used bone in, skin on, chicken thighs, instead of chicken breasts. Also reduced the butter slightly and added a half tablespoon of olive oil. Such an easy, tasty, one pot meal. I had a crispy green bean salad on the side.

This is a great one pan meal.  I used 3 boneless, skinless chicken breasts, as it was a meal for 3 people,  and 3 small potatoes. Also, I added 1/2 can of chicken broth. Other than those changes, I followed the recipe and everyone enjoyed it. I will make this again!

Did substitute whole small carrots.  The chicken was very tender and the potatoes and carrots were simply wonderful.

This is such a bland, unappealing looking dish.  The chicken looks like it was boiled then some pepper thrown on it.  How about someone make this that has some kind of talent in the kitchen, and post a picture that makes me WANT to cook something like this.  People need to step up their game if they are going to post pictures of food.
