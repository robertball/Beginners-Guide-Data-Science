Taste fantastic! Very cakey and sweet, which I personally like in cookies :) I cut the servings in half & followed the recipe exactly to yield an amazing batch of 15

I like this recipe because it is actually easy, unlike some other apple pie cookie recipies advertise.  Not to mention, they taste absolutely delicious! I modified the recipie a bit- I used approximately 10 small apples, sprinkled some sugar on top and baked for about 14 minutes  to get a bit more golden.

First do NOT use 6 apples, the submitter used Crab Apples which are tiny.  I used 1 large Granny Smith apple.  These are cakey type cookies, probably because of the use of both baking soda and baking powder (note to self, try just baking soda) I didn't use a whole tablespoon of cinnamon, more like 1 tsp and they were what I was hoping for spice wise.  
Really nice idea with a few changes.
