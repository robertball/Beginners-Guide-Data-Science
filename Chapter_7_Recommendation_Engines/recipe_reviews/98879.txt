Love this recipe with two updates: added some smoked hot paprika and used gruyeye cheese instead - excellent!

This turned out great! Canned shiitakes was all that was available to me and they got lost but I imagine fresh ones would have been delicious. I really liked the tartness this had. This one is a keeper and I will definitely make it again.

I made this as written with the exception of using all crimini mushrooms.  There was a point I was worried that the greens would be dry and need some sort of dressing, but everything came together so nicely.  The earthiness of the mushrooms and olives balanced by the brightness of the vinegar and feta tied together by the peppery greens.  Very enjoyable.
