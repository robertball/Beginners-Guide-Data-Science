I made this for our holiday dessert and everyone raved about it. I used a trifle bowl instead of making individual servings to allow everyone to eat as much as they wanted. And, though I used strong coffee (at least I thought so!) I should have made it stronger yet as the pound cake absorbs a lot of the coffee flavor thus making it fairly mild. I left out the chocolate as some family members are allergic to it. Recipe is sweet but I knew my family would be happy! As people left my house, I was asked when I was going to make it again so they could come over!

FANTASTIC! 
I used crystal ice cream glasses and cut the pound cake (which I also made) into flower shaped rounds. I used vanilla instead of butterscotch because it's somewhat of an acquired taste. I then added a fresh mint leaf and strawberry on top. I made a double batch which made fourteen servings. The teens loved it!

This was amazing. Not quite a tiramisu taste, mostly just butterscotch with coffee but it is so good. It is also really easy to make which is a major plus.

All the ingredients seem like such small amounts. But put them all together and it makes a TON! the recipe is delicious. It's rich, creamy with a great combination of flavors. I only gave it 4 stars because it is extremely rich. Extremely. I would only do one layer of the pudding cream next time.
