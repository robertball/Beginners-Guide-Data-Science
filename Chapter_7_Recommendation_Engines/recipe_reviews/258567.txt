This was good.  I liked that you could go with whatever creative ingredients you wanted to use with this recipe.  I went with the ingredients that were in the recipe, but next time I'll be  experiment more.

This was enjoyable. I never would have thought to use the corned beef hash this way as the meat source of a taco...with scrambled eggs no less. Lots of leeway to add favorite toppings, too, like jalape√±os or hot sauce.

Neat way to eat corned beef hash.  I found the lower sodium version of Mary's kitchen so I used that. Tasted great.  I couldn't really taste the eggs so next time I think I'll use more eggs and less of the hash mixture
