This turned out creamy and tasted good. I made some changes though. I cut the recipe in half because I didn't need 16 servings. I still used the full can of coconut milk. I wondered if the amount of almonds might be a typo--I only used half the amount called for, and it was still very nutty. I don't like a lot of sugar for breakfast, so I only used 2 T sugar. I cooked mine during the day and was able to watch it, and it was done and starting to stick to the bottom at 5 hours.

I would give this 5 stars even if I did not have all the ingredients.I omitted the  pears and the almonds bc my daughter can't have it. I only made 1/3 of the recipe. After 5 hours on high, it came out just perfect. You can add more milk when serving. I like mine with less liquid. delicious, not too sweet, just right.
