This dish is delicious!  I added chopped chicken breast, which I cooked with the onions prior to adding the zucchini and mushrooms.  I also added chopped green bell peppers.  Lastly, I used organic tomato basil pasta sauce instead of the four cheese.  It actually turned out well, even with my changes.  My husband and son both liked it dish.

It came out delicious!  I don't always use Classico but it still comes out great!  I add and substitute other veggies such as cauliflower and bell peppers or just whatever vegetables I have on hand.  I also add a tad more ricotta to make it more cheesy.  This is my favorite kind of Lasagna to make!
