very moist and good. exactly what i wanted! i think next time i might make it in two loaf pans instead, as the outer edges were a little more "done" than i would have chosen. i started out baking it for only 25 minutes as i didn't want it over baked, but then ended up baking it an additonal 10 minutes to get the middle done. other than that, i wouldn't change anything, it's moist and delicious.

great recipe! although i added sliced peaches on top of the batter and used a different streusel topping, this cake is by far the best coffee cake recipe. will use it from now on!

This is SO good!  I'm going to bring this to Mother's Day Brunch!   I used light sour cream and Blue Bonnet Light instead of regular sour cream & butter, and I added 1/4 C brown sugar to the topping.  After it came out of the oven, I added a light dusting of confectioner's sugar to the top. YUM!

Had to cook approx. 20 min. longer for cake to be cooked in middle, so it took the moisture out of the cake. This cake does not really stand out in anyway, sort of blah.

A delicious coffee cake. I followed the recipe and it was spot on.  I like this recipe better than the one I used to use and my friends seem to, too!

On the sweet side and just O.K.  The topping, especially, didn't do much for us.

There is a discrepancy between the ingredients list and the instructions with the butter(1/4c vs 3/4c) and white sugar(1/4c vs 1 1/4). I followed the instructions and got a flop. I also doubled the topping because it didn't cover the cake.  However, even though it flopped it tasted great. Just wasn't nice and fluffy. Will try it again following the ingredient measurments in place in the instructions.

Followed the recipe exactly. Cooked an additional 12 mins and still raw in places. When cut into first slice all I could smell was uncooked cake batter although it looked much more cooked; embarrassing really as I was meeting potential in-laws for the first time.  Not impressed sorry.
