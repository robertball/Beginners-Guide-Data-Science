Who needs the carbs from potatoes when you have celery root.  Absolutely loved this.  Next time I will add some Cumin.

Family loved it. Great alternative to mashed potatoes. I made cashew cream instead of using heavy cream to avoid dairy. Food processor worked perfectly to get it to the right consistency. Doubled the recipe for four and wasn't much left over.

I admit the only reason I used this recipe was because someone gave us a celery root and I said WTF how do I use this. We'll let me tell you it's better than mashed potatoes...I'm not kidding. I did only use a couple teaspoons of lemon juice to cook, did not add later. Did not use the salt to boiling, but used a teaspoon when celery root was in the Vitamix. Used 1/2 and 1/2 and the butter. If you have a Vitamix you can skip the straining at the end. CREAMY! SMOOTH!! INCREDIBLY TASTY!!!! Chef John did it again...with such a basic recipe.

Where was this all my life! It is wonderful. I found the secret to a great celery root purée. It is picking the root with the full green celery stalks still attached. It is more tender, easier to cut and peel, and totally delicious.

I was really looking forward to trying this but I found the lemon was too over powering. Next time, I will only put a little in and taste it, and not be so trusting and dump all the juice in.

I followed the recipe as written. It turned out as described in the video. I pureed it in my food processor and I didn't need to strain it

Easy to make , especially using our Vitramix (as another reviewer suggested).  However, this just isn't a dish any of us were crazy about.
