Cooked in slow cooker for 2 hours. I used the same amount of oil and spices but only 4 skin-on, bone-in chicken thighs. It turned out very good and it was so simple!

I used 2 Tbsp olive oil, plenty of minced garlic, 2 Tbsp Frank's hot sauce, and the called for amounts of everything else. Oh, and a tsp of onion powder.  I marinated the wings in all of the above for 2 hours, then baked them on my tin-foil-covered cookie sheet for just under an hour.  My buffalo-wing-loving husband said he definitely wants me to make them again. (His rating was 4 1/2 stars, because he'd never give anything a "perfect score"...but for him, this is as close as it gets. :)  The skin had just the right crispness, but the meat was definitely not dried out.  We had ranch, more Frank's hot sauce, and celery on the side.

My mom makes these wings all the time and the other day I got a huge craving for them and couldn't get a hold of her for the recipe. Thankfully it was right here! I also used this for drum sticks and they came out great and in the same amount of time. I also put some wing sauce on some after I took them out and that made them even better.

My family really enjoyed this recipe. The only thing that I would do differently is allow the chicken to marinate for a few hours before cooking.

My husband LOVED these wings! I didn't get to try any myself because I was dieting, but when I asked him what he thought of them, he told me they were they were the best he's had!

I found these to be very good. I used 20 chicken drumettes or 10 wings split, pretty much doubled the pressed garlic, 1 tsp each seasoned salt and fresh ground black pepper and the other ingredients as per the recipe. I moistened the paste to allow it to coat the wings with Frank's Hot Sauce, and to make it easier, I just put the wing pieces in a medium stainless steel bowl, scraped the coating over the wings and tossed them with my hands. Oven rack in the lower middle and at 375 degrees they were done in 45 minutes. I also turned them half way through. Definitely recommend.

Outstanding, my wife doesnt like really spicy foods, and she loved these.  But put some Hot sauce on the table too.   When baking sure that your pan has sides on it to catch the drippings.  Being a new cook, I used a flat cookie sheet and made a total mess of oven, actually smoked up the whole house.  No fire thank heavens, but still a real mess to clean up.

Easy recipe.  The chicken was good just like this, but I mixed the wings in some Buckeye Barbecue sauce from Quaker Steak. Delicious.

My rating is more for tips than recipe. I used it as a guide. Baked them @ 375 for 45 minutes (I wouldn't do more than 50 min assuming the wings are spaced apart). I put the wings in a large lidded tupperware container, sprayed with canola oil cooking spray, sprinkled on top freshly ground pepper, salt, adobo and a garlic & herb seasoning mix I have (no added salt version). I closed the container and then tumbled wings to evenly distribute the seasoning. These were super fast and tasty plus you can easily experiment with different herbs and spices! Thanks for sharing.

Very delicious! I loved the garlic flavor! The only thing I will change for next time is to remove the wings from the pan as soon as I remove them from the oven. Letting them sit in the liquid in the baking dish made them just a little soggy. I think If I let them sit on a paper towel, they will be absolutely perfect next time!

5+ My husband couldn't believe I cooked them in the oven. They were super moist & good. I'm only commenting on the baking part, I had leftover wings from the weekend that had been sitting in Italian Dressing for a couple of days. I needed to make them, didn't feel like grilling again so I found this oven baked method. They were fantastic! We ate it with Stubbs Wings Sauce, outstanding! Will be doing this often with other pieces of chicken.

Recipe was perfect, exactly as written, cooking times and all.  This was a HUGE hit for our family (even my super picky 11 year old who can't stand anything remotely spicy) and couldn't be easier to make.  The inside was still juicy and the exterior had a nice crunch, but not the overly dried texture baked chicken sometimes gets.  I figure I can put all of this together in the bag and leave it in the fridge until I'm ready to throw it in the oven, if I need to prepare in advance.  This one is a keeper!!

I have tried several baked wing recipes and this one is by far the best. Better than deep fried. Only thing I added was a bit of cayenne to spice it up. For 15 wings 1/2 tsp was just a hint of spice.

So good and so easy! You have to try this recipe. I think it would be easy to tweak this recipe for your own tastes too. I followed as written except for adding a little onion powder. We dipped the wings in ranch dressing and barbecue sauce and they were amazing.

really good .The best I've made from this site.I had alot of wings so I made half as stated in the recipe and half with 1/2 a cup of Frank's red hot sauce added to the bag.The wings without the sauce disappeared first.The one's with the added sauce were good too,but they were a little soggy.A few of the Frank's wings were a little black due to the tomato based sauce as well.Next time I'll follow the recipe and if someone wants wing sauce they can have it on the side.Great recipe

Easy and very yummy.  Put the seasonings and oil in a gallon ziploc and tossed to coat, worked well.  Didn't need to bake the full hour, more like 50 mins. to get the crispy, chewy finish that's so good.  Served with Jalapeño Ranch and Blue Cheese dressing.   Don't be scared by the garlic smell that fills the house, they didn't taste overwhelmingly garlicky.  This is a keeper.

I loved this recipe I did not have chili powder so I used bar-b-que seasoning and red pepper flakes and they were great.  Fall off the bone tender.  One word to the wise use aluminum foil.  What a mess my baking sheet is.

This recipe rocks! I used wing drumettes and let them marinade in the ingredients for a few hours. I kept thinking that I needed to do more but I just trusted the many positive reviews and let it be. Really wonderful results!

Mmmm, We all loved these...even the kids (2 & 4).  I boiled the wings first to try and remove some of the fat from the skin and such and made the coating exactly as written.  They were amazing,  we'll be making these wings often!

Pretty decent...as close to "real" wings as I'm likely to make at home, given that I only eat deep fried when I'm out.  I tweaked the recipe by using more fresh garlic, using Mrs. Dash instead of garlic powder, and adding a generous splash of Frank's Red Hot sauce to the marinade mix. Next time, I'll line the pan with foil, this is gonna take some elbow grease.   I served the wings with cheesy corn, and Cuban black  beans and rice.  Tasty!

pretty good! i only gave it 4 stars because i changed it up a little bit: i added a tsp of onion powder & a tbsp of hot chili oil. I also flipped the chicken half way through and only baked them for 45 mins because they looked like they would've burned if I left them in the oven any longer. all in all turned out yummy! thanks for sharing=)

Love this recipe...I can even get my 18 month old daughter. I use tbsp for all the spices though, and tonight I tried something a little different. I added some ranch to the oil/spices before the chicken and it was great!!! I think I'm going to have to make it like that from now on.

These were fantastic!  I did not have all of the chili powder (I was making a triple batch) and I didn't want to miss out on flavor.  I was thinking about seasoned salt and looked to the reviews.  I saw that other did add seasoned salt, so I added a teaspoon per batch, along with about a half teaspoon of black pepper.  We were very impressed with the flavor!  My husband and I agreed that these are some of the best wings we have ever had.

I loved this recipe, and so did everyone else. The only mistake was coating the pan with the olive oil. They make the chicken stick to pan, or it was probably the fact that I used aluminum foil under the pan.

I love this recipe! Have made three times now, and use the same ingredients, but different measurements. Our family of four eats 40 wings along with celery and blue cheese dressing. 
I find that cooking at 375 degrees on convection setting for 75 minutes gets the wings nice and crispy. 
Thanks for the recipe!

I did this recipe using chicken breasts instead and it was not to my liking.. Really dry. Maybe it was because I should have used wings instead but I won't be making again to find out.

They were definitely crispy and moist, but I don't think they had much flavor at all. And I know chicken wings are messy, but for me these were a little too sticky.

I really liked these but I like food a bit more seasoned, so I'd probably marinate them and include more garlic and onion.  Someone's suggestion of marinating in honey dijon along with these spices sounded really good.  Loved the crispiness of the chicken!

I made this exactly by the recipe and found them very greasy.  Also, the flavor was pretty garlicky and not a lot else going on.  I don't think I'll make this again.

Really easy.  Follwed the recipe as written, then I marinated the wings for almost 2 hours before baking.  however, it wasn't very tasty.  Kinda bland.

The flavoring was good. I tried baking them on a cookie sheet and they dried up. So I will put it in a baking dish next time and pour the sauce all over them so they come out as "wet" wings.

FAST & EZ! The consistency was perfect. They were good, just lacked flavor. They need a lot more spice. We dipped them in Ranch and gobbled them down fast.
Now I use this "marinade" for my regular chicken, NOT JUST FOR WINGS.

good chicken, but if you want something like a wing you get at restaurant, this isn't for you... not very 'wingy' tasting.

Delicious! And a much healthier option than frying it in quarts of oil and flour! I didn't have any garlic powder and am on a strict budget this month, so I decided to make it a little more spicy and used cayenne pepper instead. Wonderful! What a hit! I used whole organic chicken wings from the farmers markets. Reminds me of Shake 'n' Bake eaten as a kid. Just so much better!

What I liked about the recipe is that I was able to make a "normal" type chicken wing for my mom who isn't a fan of the buffalo style wing. And then I added Franks hot sauce to mine after it was done. I did try the non Franks version and it was good, but sort of plain for my tastes. Still a solid recipe that looked beautiful when it was done.

Delicious. used wingette's and chicken legs. I also added jalapenos, texas pete hot sauce, adobo seasoning and lawry's seasoning salt to the mix. Prior to cooking, I marinated for a couple of hours in the seasoning. Instead of cooking on a baking sheet, I cooked it in a bigger pan so that it could marinate in the juices while cooking.

These were good. And by good I mean not disgusting. There really was nothing special about them. The second time I made them I added my own seasons which these desperately need. The recipe as written makes very greasy bland wings. Be creative and add a pinch of this and a dash of that. You're going to need it with this one.

I was disappointed. They came out nice and crispy, that aspect was great. But they had NO flavour and I even let them marinate for an hour before cooking. I usually like 'plain' wings without sauce, but these did nothing for me. I'd certainly use the baking method again, but with more/different seasoning.

I made these for superbowl Sunday and the only change I made was to add Frank's hot sauce and marinaded them for 45 minutes. After they were baked I used 'Scott's Buffalo Wing Sauce' recipe from AR to top them off. Definitely the best wing combo I've made on my own. Will definitely use this recipe again.

I added wing sauce and onion powder per others reviews. My favorite part of this recipe is that you don't have to bread/flour the wings and then refrigerate for an hour--you can make them last minute and the result is still a crispy delicious wing!

This was wonderful they were gone in 60 seconds, used minced garlic (because I forgot to buy fresh) and broil a few minutes in the end to crisp them up...Yummy!!

Made these wings 4 football sunday and they turned out great.  I made them like the recipe said however since I didn't have the exact ingredients I used what I had.  They turned out great, only complaint my husband has was that I shouldn't have cooked them as long as I did. Other then that he loved them and so did my kids

To make the wings crispier and cleanup easier, line a shallow rimmed cookie pan with tin foil, then set a wire cooling rack on top. and sprayed the whole thing with cooking spray.  The wire cooling rack keeps the wings from sitting in their own grease and helps the  meat cook a little more uniformly.  My kids love this recipe!

This is my second time making these & they are soo yummy! I add chicken broth to the mix & it's perfect. I flip these over half way through, & also drain the excess juice or the skin will be soggy. marinate these before hand, put them on a baking sheet with edges, pour remaining marinade on top then pop in the oven. bestu wings ever, thank you!

I wanted to do something different with my chicken wings. They turned out awesome!! I didn't have any garlic or chili powder,so i used seasoning salt and celery seed. I couldn't believe how crispy they turned out,To me they were better than fried...elbrad

These were nice and crispy without going through the whole flour and chill rigamarole. I added a significant amount of catsup and a little brown sugar to give it a more bbq flavor for my kids. Yum.

Legitimately amazing and so fast! Toss 'em and forget them for an hour. We tossed half of them with some Frank's Red Hot and butter, but these are great all on their own. Easily a new family favorite.

So often on this great site, recipes are given reviews that may or may not be accurate, but the reviews for these wings bothered me. While most people loved them some did not, and I think I know why. These are the EASIEST & BEST baked wings I have ever made, and I will keep making them. I wish I had added the wing sauces to the marinade, and next time I will. 
Truthfully, no, they are not as good as the wings made with a large investment of time, flour and oil. My whole family knows it and so do I. However, I think this was the first Sugar Bowl game which I actually got to sit with my husband and sons throughout the whole game, not hearing bits and pieces from the kitchen, hands dredged in flour, particles of grease settling everywhere.

 I am sure I will fry wings again, but this is an awesome recipe, thanks so much!

I made a big triple batch of these to take to a pot luck gathering.  They were a huge hit and several people requested the recipe.  Perfect for a pot luck because they are not too spicy, not too saucy, and can be prepped ahead of time. The event we were going to was a soccer game/lunch, so I put everything into a bag the night before, so the wings had a chance to marinate overnight. (I had been thawing then in the fridge all day before that, so they were still partly frozen and finished thawing during this overnight marinate). 
 In the morning I dumped them all onto trays, baked them according to the recipe, and then transferred to my crockpot for the potluck, was able to use keep warm setting and since they had gone it hot, this was just right to keep them warm for serving.

Great wings.  I modified the recipe by adding 1 tsp. of cumin to the mix.  After baking, I mixed 1/2 stick of melted butter with 1/4 cup of Tabasco Buffalo Style Hot Sauce and tossed the cooked wings in the sauce.  It took these wings to another level. Definitely a keeper!

Well...mine didn't get crispy. I tried cooking half on a baking sheet, half on a rack and it didn't matter. Too much olive oil for me, and my husband thought the marinade tasted like oily sand. I'm so sorry, but this recipe didn't fare well for me:(

I gave this recipe a 5 because its the best baked wing recipe Ive had so far.  I will admit ,deep fried are better but not that much and baked have to be a little better for ya with a lot less mess. I cooked them exactly as written except I left them in the sealed bag in the refrigerator an hour or so in the mix before cooking them. 
 When they were just about done I heated a little of my Anchor Bar Suicide wing sauce I order from Buffalo NY. Shook them in the sauce in a tupperware covered bowl and dumped them in the plastic baskets lined with parchment paper and served with Maries Blue Cheese dressing and Celery. I will make these again when the wing craving strikes.

These wings were superbowl worthy.  I made them just as the recipe called for.  I did flip the wings over after about 45 minutes and cooked them another 45 minutes to get them perfectly brown on all sides.  After cooking I took 1/2 of the wings and put a hot sauce on them and put those back in the oven for 5 minutes.  Two great kinds of wings from one recipe.  My grandson liked them so much he wants to make them next he comes over to my house.  Yippee.

I have cooked a lot of chicken wings in my day and this recipe was very easy and delicious.  Took about 50 min. in a gas oven.  Will serve to guests at my fishing lodge next spring.

I use this recipe for all cuts of chicken (whatever is on sale on shopping day!). It is absolutely the tastiest recipe for chicken and super easy to throw together. Looking at the ingredients, it doesn't look like much, but the flavors all meld together to create my family's favorite way to cook chicken.

Very good! I added a teaspoon of onion powder, used a teaspoon of garlic salt and added a Tbsp of hot sauce to the mix. Next time I will use more hot sauce because I didn't really taste it. Thanks for sharing- we all enjoyed these and I will be making it often!

If you don't like to fry, then this one is for you.  My family thinks it is better than the fried versions I have made.  You can easily adjust the "hotness" by adjusting spice level or adding a touch of liquid hot sauces.  This is the only hot wing receipe we make anymore.

My husband and father-in-law really liked these wings. I think when I do them again I am going  to put them on a rack so they will get crispier. If you like them with some heat you might want to put some more spice in the flour.

The best chicken wings done in the oven EVER! They were sooo good. I used a cookie sheet covered with foil then parchment paper on top and the wings on top. It allowed for super easy clean up and crispy wings.

These are awesome. Made some plain and made some I tossed in Frank's  Wing Sauce. Both were great. I did bake some on racks above a cookie sheet lined with aluminum foil and some right on the cookie sheet lined with the foil. If you want them crunchy bake them right on the cookie sheet. The ones on the rack were softer!

Great recipe and easily adaptable.  I mix the ingredients in a large freezer bag, then add the chicken wings to coat.  Then I add 1/4 cup brown rice flour to coat.  This adds a nice gluten free crisp to them.

One of my favorite ways to make wings. If you want it crispy only use 1 TB of olive oil and bake at 425 for 20 mins on one side and flip then bake another 25 minutes. It comes out perfect!

Yes taste okay but just put the chicken wings in a plastic bag filled with only Tony Chachere until they are all nice and pink and bake.  Best I have ever tasted and no fuss....easy and delicious...although it doesn't sound like it...give it a try when you are in a hurry!

I make this often, like another reviewer I add about 1 tsp of onion powder and 1/4 cup of BBQ sauce of choice. Makes enough sauce for over a dozen, and I bake at 400 for 30 minutes. I often use frozen wings and they turn out PERFECT and delicious each time. :)

I tried this exactly as printed. The wings had no flavor and were dry. I reduced the temp to 350 and 45 min cooking time, I added 1 tsp cayenne powder 1 tsp habenero powder 2 tbsp franks red hot, 2 tbsp baby ray's BBQ sauce, a dash of balsamic vinager and a tbsp of brown sugar. I devided the mixture in half. I coated the wings and put in the oven. at 25 min I turned the wings and sprayed with olive oil. after a total of 45 min I removed and coated with the other half of the mixture. I woud rate the final product as medium in heat and full of flavor. I will increase the habenaro powder and may add sme chipotle powder in the next batch. Just my 2 Cents worth of advice. Eat well!

I have used this recipe twice.  The thing that the written recipe doesn't mention is to put it on a cooling rack inside a foiled-lined pan (the video shows it).  It's a nice balance of flavor and you can adjust the seasoning accordingly.  One reviewer mentioned honey, but if you use it in the marinade the wings become way too dark.  I just put a dipping plate of honey to dip them in and they were fabulous!

I doubled the recipe to surprise my hubby for Sunday night football/dinner and the only thing I may do different
next time is let them marinate or add some hot sauce for "heat"...with that said... These were DELICIOUS as it is... Try it... You won't regret it... A keeper...It's on my recipes list now.  I served with sliced celery/carrots and ranch sauce.

Recipe was very easy to make and bake!  The chicken was very moist and flavorful.  I USED WINGS AND THIGHS and doubled the ingredients for 16 pieces, this is not spicy, but subtle.  I WILL DEFINITELY BE MAKING IT AGAIN.

This was super easy to make. I added a couple of more ingredients Frank's Hot Sauce, Chipotle pepper and white vinegar. Marinated the chicken for about 4hours! My fiancé loved it.

These were delicious! Hubby is from Buffalo and very discerning and said these were "very good, for baked wings", which is high praise. I added some smoked paprika w/ chipotle and some dried onions and upped the temp to 400 as we were a little tight on time. Took about 40 minutes. The kids loved them, too.

My husband's favorite snack. He puts ranch dressing on the side and enjoys every last one of the wings with gusto. So easy to make and hardly any mess to clean up.

I love crispy chicken wings, and there ARE, plus very tasty. I did as another reviewer suggested and drained on paper towels before serving. I didn't have garlic powder, so used onion flakes instead, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. This will be one of those "go to" recipes for me.

We're currently doing Whole30 and this recipe is an amazing mix-up to the chicken breast / steak tips we've been doing most nights. It's crunchy if done according to the recipe.

I'm making this for the third time right now! Simple and tasty.

The baked chicken was phenomenal! So flavorful. I originally heated the oven to 375, but the chickent wings were browning really fast, so I lowered it to about 250 toward the end. I did have to add a little more oil to the pan because it had all evaporated. But with those minor modifications, the chicken wings tasted amazing.

I'm a newbie when it comes to cooking, so this was the first time I added garlic to my meal, and it was great. I'm trying the garlic chicken tomorrow. We'll see how it goes.

I just realized I hadn't rated these and I'm about to make them for about the 7th time since discovering the recipe. Hubby and sons love them and so do I. We like to dip them in some ranch dressing. So happy to find a good taste without all the oil of deep frying. I can now have these more on a regular basis instead of the once in a great while of the deep fried ones. Good for the diet and more healthy. I do let the chicken marinate a bit in the sauce.

The chicken came out perfect.  Skin was nice and crisp and the chicken fell right off the bone.  I'll probably look for a way to kick up the spice a bit, but will definitely use this recipe again.

I agree with Carly's review.  I would rate this as "GOOD", but it's nothing special.  I would categorize this is a solid and tasty weeknight recipe that requires few ingredients and is super easy to make.  You won't be disappointed with this dish, but you likely won't be "WOW"'d either.

Made a batch for 40 pieces of chicken. Found putting mix in a bowl and mixing it up then putting chicken in a large deep dish firs then pour all mix over and mix it up coated it quicker for a large batch at once.  added onion and season all did not have chili.

I did add the 1/4 cup wings hot sauce and 1 tsp onion powder to the bag.  I like my wings crispy so after the hour baking time, I broiled the wings for a few minutes.  My family loved them and the kids dipped in ranch dressing. I lined the cookie sheet with foil and sprayed with cooking spray; clean up was fast!

The ease of making this recipe was a huge plus.  I probably went a little heavier on the garlic powder, and I did add a tsp of poultry seasoning and smoked paprika.  Let them cook for about an hour and wound up with a nice flavorful wing that had a crispness to it.  I'll definitely be making these again.  Thank you!

Loved it, made 50 wings for 4 people, we couldn't get enough I would bake maybe 10-15 minutes less though because they were very well done. Easy, with ingredients I had in the house

This wing recipe sounded like a bit of departure so I thought I would give it a try.  I made it exactly as specified but it seemed a bit "wet" so I immediately removed them from the pan and let them drain and cool on paper towels.  After they had cooled I put them in a large baggy and poured a combination of 1/3 cup each; a popular wing sauce and a popular BBQ sauce, put the wings on a rack over a foil covered tray and baked for 15 minutes at 350, just enough time to make the sauce "stick".  They were great! 
However..............BJ's (like a Costco) has a good frozen chicken wing for sale, that eliminates all of the above steps, other than cutting open the bag and pouring it in a pan, which I think I will sprinkle with some garlic powder next time.  I love to cook, but for a Superbowl game my guests are not that particular. :-)

This was the most amazing chicken I have ever tasted in my entire life. I loved the spicy, tangy flavor that the chili powder offers. I made this for my family, and EVERYONE went back for seconds. Made this recipe in the summer and forgot about it. I couldn't find the recipe, so now I made sure I saved it.

Very delicious! I'm big on spices so I added additional chili powder and garlic. I also added some Adobe seasoning (that stuff is great on all meat). I cooked these on a cookie sheet for 50 minutes. I then took them out and covered half of them with a wing sauce and the other half with a barbecue sauce. I put them back in the oven and cooked for an additional 10-15 minutes. These bad boys are awesome! Thanks for sharing!

These turned out pretty good.  I added poultry seasoning.  Dumped all ingredients in a bowl, tossed, placed on a foil-lined cookie sheet then baked.

Best wings ever! I've made this recipe about 6 times already. My husband and I just LOVE how tasty and juicy these are. The recipe calls for 10 wings, but i've made about 16 by adding a little bit more of every ingredient and they come out perfect. Thanks for this delicious recipe. It has become a staple at our home :D

I doubled the whole recipe because I knew they were going to get devoured. My batch came out so  good. I dashed in a little cayenne pepper otherwise stuck to the script. Foolproof and highly recommended.

They were okay. We didn't have the problem with them getting soggy, but did broil them for a couple minutes after baking for an hour.

Tasty wings, but lacked a bit of flavour.  I think I would try what another has suggested and add some Franks Red Hot to the mix.  I will also add a little more garlic next time.
Will certainly use this recipe again!

My family (filled with very picky boys) loves this recipe!  I was in shock because they don't like very many new things I try to bring to the menu.  So I have to thank you for sharing this recipe.  
It was easy to make, and we all loved it.  I use it often now.

Thank you for this.. I needed a recipe that produced the crispy texture normally achieved though frying. I didn't use olive oil, but sprayed each wing with "I can't believe it's not butter" spray for lower calories and used the spices accordingly. Delish. Getting ready to make again today.

Tried these yesterday for the first time, and I thought they came out pretty good, I used cajun power, didn't have any chili power, 2 garlic cloves not 3 and 1 1/2 tablespoons of lemon juice(love lemon favor chicken). I had 8 large size whole wings, so I probably should have double the recipe, next time I'll use drumettes and add more lemon juice, didn't really taste the lemon juice in this recipe, but it was still pretty good, and I'll make this again, thanks for sharing.

This was my first attempt at wings.  They were absolutely amazing.  The only part I will change is that first bite, when I realized I should have added more salt to the mix.  Super delicious!

Fabulous!!!  I used a 5 lb. bag of wings (thawed), tripled the rest of the ingredients and added 1/2 cup Louisiana hot sauce.  They were hot, but not "buffaloey".  Crispy, juicy, amazing dipped in Ranch dressing!

We loved these wings!  I made them for our Super Bowl party and coated them with different sauces for different tastes.  Only change I made was added 1 tbsp onion powder as one reviewer suggested.

Very Yummy.. All my boys loved them and that doesn't happen very often.  I hope to try this seasoning on Drumsticks next.. I loved the crispy skin and not frying!

My family can't get enough of these wings.  SO easy to make and SO delicious.  We cook them extra crispy and serve with blue cheese or ranch on the side.  Great recipe.  I use a little extra garlic and minced garlic.

I found these wings to be a little too greasy.  I would recommend either removing the skin, first, or maybe just shaking them in a bag with dry spices, and not adding the oil.  I think they could be improved with the addition of onion powder and some cayenne, but otherwise they were quite good.

I used cayenne pepper instead of chili powder, since that was what I had.  Once these were done, I  mixed melted butter and Frank's hot sauce in a bowl and dredged the wings through that and baked for about 5 minutes more, which melded the flavors.  This was my first time making wings and my boyfriend and I loved them!

With 15 Minutes to go on baking we pulled them out and heavily brushed them with Frank's Red Hot.  Turned out GREAT!

My family enjoyed the flavor of these so much  that I made them twice in one week with different   cuts of chicken. I used garlic powder since I didn't   have any other garlic. I also seasoned the wings by   marinating them in hot sauce prior to seasoning   them as directed. For whatever reason, I can't get a   consistent crispiness on all the pieces which we   REALLY prefer to the soft oily ones.

The easiest to prepare and mildest tasting wings I've ever made.  I put them skin-side down at first, and then turned them halfway through cooking time.  I took them out after 52 minutes to let them rest and they were cooked to perfection.  My husband and I both loved them.

These are amazing and easy.  You don't have to follow the ingredients list exactly I ended up adding a little bit more of certain spices I  enjoy.  My sister tasted them and made them for her family every night for a week.

Very, very good. I agree that the wings should be put on a rack on the baking sheet. I made the recipe as stated, however I like wings with some kick, so next time I'll roll them in a mixture of hot sauce and melted butter when they come out of the oven. The wings were very flavorful so this one's a keeper for me.

My kids ate this! I'm still rubbing my eyes and blinking in shock! I made this as the recipe stated, except using California style garlic powder which includes some parsley (because I was too lazy to look for our plain stuff). I turned these over after 25 minutes, and cooked them an additional 25 minutes. I thought it was great! Thank you for sharing this!

even with all the garlic, it was bland and not crispy (like chicken wings should be). I gave it a star for tenderness. Very tender. I will not make again.

It was fairly oily, so the wings weren't as crispy as I'd hoped, however the flexibility of this recipe allowed my roommate and I to experiment extensively with other flavors by substituting for the garlic and chili powder.  We tried variations with chinese five spice, teriyaki, blackened seasoning, and Montreal chicken seasoning they were all excellent with this recipe.

The wings came out very well.  I have to give a 4 stars only because there just wasn't enough kick for me, even after I made my own changes!  I used minced garlic cuz that was all I had and seasoned the wings with a little cajun seasoning prior to shaking in the other spices.  They had good flavor, just not enough heat, so a couple pinches of cayenne, next time, will make this a 5 star recipe.  Thanks for sharing!

I made these the other day.  We really enjoyed them, but my family would prefer a little kick.  I did add a dash of onion powder, but I will try a little dash of tabasco too the next time.  The texture of the wings were great and the recipe was so easy.  Thanks!

These wings are fantastic.  Followed another review and added 2tbsp of Franks wing sauce and 1 tsp of onion powder.  I cut the olive oil to 2 tbsp since I’m adding more liquid with the wing sauce.  Another trick is after baking put them under the broiler on low for about 3 minutes, turn wings and broil for another 2-3 mins.  Crispy and perfect.

I quadrupled the recipe for a group. It got rave reviews all night! I added creole seasoning to the mixture and let the chicken marinate for about 2 hrs in the refrigerator. Baked for an hour, but they were not crispy yet (probably because of the large quantity). I raised the temp to 425 and baked an additional 10-12 minutes and it turned out perfect.

This is the first time I made chicken wings and I will never use another recipe. This were so delicious and simple to make! They tasted like restaurant quality wings. I used a bowl and mixed them by hand and added other spices for more flavor. I also used cayenne pepper for the chili powder and decided to put in half the amount which was the perfect amount of spice. Can’t wait to make these again.

This was fast & easy, but I didn't really like the spice mix. Is there a baked wings recipe for the air fryer or crockpot. I LOVE this site, & the magazine. I loved 2015 June July August turned me onto All Recipes! All those wonderful tomato dishes, & PIES!!! Yum yum I get so hungry looking at pics lol.

Some of the best wings I've ever eaten!
That said, I didn't follow the recipe exactly.

My intention was to make buffalo wings. I completely broke down 10 wings and discarded the tips, leaving 20 chicken pieces. I mixed the marinade and let them do there thing in the fridge for an hour or two. then I cooked them on an aluminum half sheet pan lined with foil. (I wish I had a baking rack to fit, the skin would have come out crisper.)

I set a timer for 30 minutes to flip them only to find out they were done in 30. All above 170F internal temp. (instant-read thermometer saves the day)
I tried one like they were, not bad but I like more spice. Then I tossed the rest in Buffalo sauce. (Chef John's... on this site)

Wow! they were a hit! the chili powder in the marinade plus Buffalo sauce made for unique and delicious wings!

Expect different cooking times depending on your cooking pan, oven and whole or broken down wings.

These were really good.  Like the healthy aspect  over frying...also easy!  They smelled so good baking.  I coated them with a little Buffalo Wing Sauce (Chef John recipe from this site)...really added a lot of flavor.  Thanks Kristin C for a great recipe!

Oh my gosh—the best wings I have had in a long time! I did double the recipe because I had double the wings—worked great! I also added the recommended onion powder and wing sauce. SO TASTY! Will definitely make again as my husband loved them too. Thank you for sharing such an easy, delicious recipe!

Great taste! I added onion powder and  wing sauce to the ingredients as recommended by someone else. I cooked the wings lower temp (350) for 45 min. then upped the temp for another 30and then turned the oven off and let them sit. They smelled amazing while cooking and hubby, who is picky with his wings, love them! I'm not a wing love so have never cooked them... this will be a favorite!

Hubby and kids loved it. I did like another reviewer and followed the recipe exactly, with the addition of a few shakes of onion powder and chicken wing sauce. I’d probably cook it for maybe 50-55 mins next time, instead of an hour.

I used 1/2 the chili powder recommended so they could be
dipped in a hot sauce, as needed per person, after baking.
Have made this twice now, and gave recipe to my Mother who happens to be making tonight. Love it.

Nice Recipe!  Only thing I changed was patted wings dry and put in bag w/ corn starch. Then put paper towels top and bottom of the pan and let chicken wings sit in the refrigerator for 8 hr. or overnight. Then followed the recipe. Much crisper.

This was so easy with quick preparation and ingredients I already keep on hand. I removed the chicken to paper towels to drain as another reviewer suggested. Very moist inside and nice crust without breading. I will bake these with different tweaks to change it up. Very healthy and tasty served with a salad.

This was my first time making wings. They were awesome!!! I added some wing sauce before baking like others suggested. Also, the second time I made them I only baked them for 45 min. An hour was a bit too long for me.

I did not make any changes to this recipe.  I have made it many times now and it not only throws together fast, it always  cooks up crisp and tasty.  Make sure you use foil on the pan for easy  clean up.

I marinated them overnight in a zip lock bag.

I received a special New Mexico chili powder from Stephen at the SB Athletic club.  I used it for the first time.  

I followed the recipe but added more oil and more garlic because I had 20 wings to use.  I baked them in the oven at 375 for 50 minutes and used a roaster oven rack to bake them on.

Would add just a pinch more salt, or use a garlic salt/garlic powder combo. But that is personal preference. These wings were fantastic!!!

I doubled the oil, garlic and spices and marinated 12 wing sections plus five boneless, skinless chicken thighs  in the refrigerator for about six hours. The wings were “okay” - the thighs not so much!  I’m glad I paid

Perfect recipe! The wings came out tender and juicy. I flipped them every 20 minutes and brushed them with the rendered chicken fat and olive oil each time. After an hour, they were perfect. I used a berbere seasoning and served them with a yogurt sauce. Best roasted wig recipe I’ve tried so far.

Made as recipe said. Delicious! 
They are tasty and mild. Need to add in some heat if you like them hot!

Easy, quick and taste great! This Will no on my short list of great apps/snacks!

I recommend 400 degrees for about an hour and 15 minutes.   I used parchment paper in my pan which didn't allow the bottom of the wing's to be crisp, great recipe and of course you can add what you're tastebud's like.

I was amazed at how simple and easy this recipe was, and it tasted great!  I used about 1/4 cup of hot sauce in place of the chili powder.  I will make this again!

This is a great wing recipe. The trick is to line your baking sheet with foil and then place a wire rack on it. Cooking the wings on the wire rack will give you the perfectly crisp exterior and tender interior. And for all of those who alter the recipe by adding hot wing sauce.... here is another tip. Cook the wings as is. Once they are done, toss them in your wing sauce. Sometimes I’ll toss some in Parmesan cheese once I take them out of the oven, but our favorite is just following the recipe as is.

My family loves this recipe. I’m ashamed to admit how many times we’ve had it in the past few weeks! The first couple times I followed the recipe and then I started playing with the seasonings. I’ve used it on wings as well as cut up fryers. I highly recommend this recipe. It’s easy to fix AND easy to clean up afterward. Two thumbs up!!

I just finished making these and noticed there was alot of oil left in the baking pan. I followed the recipe to the T but, they came out all greasy and the skin was sticky. Taste was so-so. Sorry, but I won't be making these again.

I did allow the wings to marinate for a few hours.   Pleasantly surprised how crispy and tender they were.

Oh. Em. Eff. Gee. These were absolutely AMAZING! The first batch I made exactly as the recipe called for. Second was a bunch more garlic. Either way, they turned out awesome and I will make them again and again and again and again and...you get the drift. ;)

I cook them at 425 for 35 minutes and they are crispy but more juicy and fall off the bone yummy. I added a few pinches of crushed red pepper to mine for some hotness.

Good as a base favor for wings, but we ended up coating it lightly with wing sauce to finish it off.

Mine were bbq seasoned from the butcher at Nob hill so I just added the oil and followed the temp and time . Very good. Tin foil bottom is the way to go . I use this site a few times a week.

I have not received so many compliments as I did in this recipe. In addition to the spices listed, I added Franks hot sauce, a little Liquid Smoke, and I marinated for at least 3 hours. Fabulous recipe!

I marinated these for one hour, before  cooking them. These were very good. They had a nice crispy outside and a good flavor. Perfect cooking time and you could change up the recipe IF you wanted.

Overall they were bland but I did 4 flavours by adding Teriyaki, Frank Red Hot, homemade honey garlic and this recipes seasoning. First of all 375 is too Hot for this recipe. Not only did many of them burn, the skin that didn't was soggy. Oddly, only the Hot Wings turned out unburned, but they were still too dark.

I was surprised at how simple and how flavorful these were without marinating. I used a convection oven and should have baked for less than an hour, but even so they were delicious.

I made this recipe and used avocado oil instead of olive oil. Follow all spices and added a little Cajun spice and it was amazing!! Will definitely make this again! The wings were crispy and juicy!

I made this recipe for my husband and I.  I followed the recipe closely except for one change.  I put in five spice instead of chili powder.  I can’t eat spicy.  The wings were very good.  The only thing I found that didn’t work was the length of time to cook.  The wings weren’t very large and one hour was too much time.  I will make this recipe again.

Great recipe and easy to follow. I added some onion powder and Franks Red Hot sauce. It helped to give it that great color and a little spice. Meat fell off the bone and kids liked it very much! Will be doing again.

These are delicious but don't cook them for an hour; 40 minutes is just right.  I added chipotle  sauce to the wings.

I really like the chicken but I made a big change - I did not use any salt in the process and used a lot of black pepper instead.  I also used some lemon juice and lemons to give more flavor.  It was even more tasty the day after.

Had such high hopes after reading reviews but did not find these wings that special at all.  Followed recipe exactly, they weren't crispy and flavor was just ok.  Have 4 boys and no one wants me to make them again.

I grilled the wings instead of baking them. Grilled 7 wings with this marinade, 7 with a hickory rub and 7 with a Cajun blackened rub. This marinade was good but the family liked the other two more.

At first I was skeptical when I saw the chili powder because I didn't want my wings to have a chili flavor but they didn't and they were wonderful!

Hubby and 16 yr old son loved them. Nice change from "egg/four dipped then fried" version of wings. Great flavor - I used olive oil, cracked pepper, chili powder, sea salt, onion salt, garlic powder and then marinated the chicken for about 4 hours.  Smells wonderful in the oven, too! Highly recommend!

I seasoned the chicken with salt and pepper before I placed in ziplock bag with olive oil mix. The chicken was tender and flavorful. Will definitely cook again.

It was very tasty! I put it under the broiler to crisp it up and it made all of the difference. Also, I used chipotle chili powder instead of regular chili powder. Will be making this again!

Excellent recipe.  I also added some hot wing sauce to the seasonings.  The wings still weren’t too spicy and I tossed them in more wing sauce once they finished cooking.

These are really good, no garlic cloves & added tsp of onion powder (recommended by other user) & adobo. Do you turn them over halfway through the hour or not at all? Because I think they wouldn’t be done but I’m trying it without turning them this time. This is my go to recipe:)

Time and temperature for cooking the wings was great.  However, I did adjust seasonings.  A little bland as written.  Added some Franks Hot Sauce.  I will definitely make these again.  As a note, I used parchment paper instead of non-stick foil -- worked great,

We enjoyed these very much! It was the first time we made chicken wings instead of buying the frozen ones from you know -the big box store. We will make again, followed ingredients as shown but added a pinch of cayenne, will add a bigger pinch next time. We did marinate a couple hours too, yum!

This recipe is quick and easy.  Honestly, you could cut the olive oil and use 2 tablespoons instead of 3.  Also, 1/2 teaspoon of chili pepper was more than enough and I like spicy foods.  Enjoy.

I enjoyed the simple flavour, but others were not impressed. I've done it with drumsticks, 450 40 min. It makes a good base flavouring. I plan to pull them out when close to done and baste them with a BBQ sauce next time to give it more flavour.  It was fairly smokey from the oven when I opened it, I'll lower the temp next time and cook slower when not in a hurry.

I wasn't sure it would cover all the 12 pieces of chicken.  I didn't use the frozen ones.  But it worked out fine.  I didn't think the garlic cloves were enough that it required.    I thought the garlic powder would be overpowering so I added some oregano.  it came out great.

Excellent.  Fairly easy.  Definitely watch the baking time.   Done perfectly in 45 minutes.   Suggest leaving in marinade at least 2 hours in fridge.

I made this for my guests at my birthday party and they loved it! I am not a huge fan of chicken wings since when I have had them they don't taste anything once you get inside the wings.  I cooked it in the suggested temperature and for 45 minutes and they were done. Maybe it depends on your oven but I think if you cooked it for 1 hour like the recipe suggests it would be too dry or burnt even!  I actually marinated it overnight and I used a hormone free chicken (split wings) I'm not sure if that made any difference in terms of the taste but normally I find hormone free chicken taste a lot better. I lined a baking pan in foil and removed it right away from the pan because the oils just accumulated. At first I thought it was going to be spicy but it wasn't at all. I can definitely taste the garlic and you can absolutely smell the garlic while you are baking it. I'm sure if you want it to be spicier you can add chili flakes. I followed exactly the measurements when I adjusted it for the servings I needed and it was perfect.

I made this exactly as directed but for the last 15 minutes I also add our favorite barbecue sauce, toss the wings to coat and put them back in the oven. We like saucy wings and the sauce adds just enough sauciness for us on top of all of the good seasonings from the original recipe.

My husband and I loved them. Tasted just like we got them from a restaurant. Also very easy. I just put all the ingredients into a gallon sized plastic bag, shook everything up then placed them on a tin foil covered pan. Turned out great!!

Actually pretty easy to make. I make Old Bay wings, used my own spices (4 Tbsp Old Bay, 2 tsp BBQ salt, 1 tsp celery see, 1 tsp pepper). Marinate in oil and spice rub overnight.  As others suggested, line baking sheet with foil for easy clean up.  Turned wings half way through cooking.  I made them ahead of time for a party.  After cooking, cool on cooling rack.  Then into disposable foil pan and cover with foil.  Reheated at 350 degrees fro about 15-20 minutes.  Kids devoured them.

I made it EXACTLY as written. If I were to make it again I would:
1) Add more spice (cayenne)
2) Add a bit more salt
3) Buy meatier wings
I made 1 set per this recipe and the other half using Buffalo Wing Sauce (Dave's). I preferred the crispiness of this recipe over the Buffalo

These were a nice change from cooking first and adding flavor after.  I omitted the S&P, added more garlic, used hot sauce, and substituted SEASONEST Soul Food seasoning blend for the chili powder.  They were marinated overnight and then grilled low and slow.  They browned nicely and were fall off the bone tender and moist.  The heat from the hot sauce has a back note meaning that they don't kick you in the teeth at first bite, but remind you that it is there just when you thought they were "mild."  I'm sure that probably depends on how much hot sauce you add to the marinade.  I probably used at least three tablespoons.

Easy. Delicious. Definitely use parchment or aluminum foil on your pan, because the clean up is so much easier. I used more than 10 wings, because mine were small. My only gripe with this recipe is that the house was overwhelmed with garlic fragrance. It was off-putting. But the wings were so tasty, we'll make them again, despite the smell. They didn't taste too garlicky.

We love this recipe and make it regularly. Even my finicky kids love it. I do hate when salt is listed as “to taste” in something you can’t taste until it is too late. But otherwise it’s a great recipe.

I stumbled upon this recipe while Google-ing how long to bake chicken wings. I had already seasoned my wings with seasoned salt, pepper and garlic powder.  Per the recipe I then added minced garlic, chili powder and olive oil and baked for time and temp given. The flavor and texture were great, and the whole family loved them. I will definitely make these again.

Made this recipe for the second time.  As suggested, this time added the Louisiana Chicken Sauce & the Onion Powder.  We both loved it.  Wonderful!  Will definitely be making again!

This was excellent. I didn't think wings could get so crispy in the oven. Mine were done in 40 minutes and I flipped half way through. I think an hour is way too long at that temperature. I made buffalo sauce on the side and used for dipping. Awesome.

I made these wings tonite. I loved the flavor.  Think I would use 3 Tablespoons of minced garlic. I only used 2. (did not have fresh).  Also I dont think I added enough salt. Very much enjoyed and will make them again. Thanks Kristen C.

I made half of the wings exactly like the recipe called for, for the other half I used olive oil and a store bought lemon pepper spice mix. For both sets of wings the flavor was fantastic. The meat was so succulent and tender, practically falling off the bone. We loved these and will make them part of our normal rotation.

Made exactly as written minus the garlic powder. Was not able to get the wings crispy until broiling for about 10 minutes on the middle rack, and even then they were only slightly crispy. The skin had a great taste, but the rest of the wing was quite bland.  I don't feel like the olive oil helped to get them crisp and I had to drain them on paper towels before serving as they were very greasy. Maybe baking on a rack would help in addition to baking at a higher temperature.

Found this recipe last night and made it for my dinner tonight. Made up the spice blend and put 8 wing parts in the marinade and let it marinate in the frig for 2 hours. Then I baked it for the full hour and I just finished eating them and they were awesome. I will definitely make this again.

So easy to make. Only about 10 minutes of prep work. Tossed in some Frank's red hot wing sauce at the end and they're perfect.

Great flavor, no need to change any seasoning! I only changed slightly the cooking way: I placed the wings COVERED in the oven for 35-40 min. Then uncovered them and placed them under the broiler jut to get color, for 5 to 8 minutes. Everybody loved them, no leftovers, no need to add bbq sauce since the flavor is awesome!!

I made this with the Allrecipes taco seasoning recipe like another reviewer suggested.  This was SO perfect! My husband calls me a "wing snob", so I actually had another meal planned for backup.  We didn't need that and I was bummed we didnt make more wings!

 I've never written a review, however, this preparation for wings was too darn good to not rate it....five BIG STARS!

Awesome!  I bake on a cookie rack in a pan to make them more crispy.  Serve with teriyaki and Franks buffalo dipping sauce as options.  They don't last very long...

So, this is a great recipe as is and I have made it....but last night, I decided to use a garlic infused oil and for the seasoning I used my favorite allrecipes.com  taco seasoning recipe and made one of the most delicious batches of baked chicken wings in the history of the human race!  Delicious.

These are really good.  My wings were rather big and it didn't take an hour to cook them. I followed the  directions but,  I  did add  a teaspoon of liquid smoke. I can understand using a wing sauce but they are delicious without a sauce.

I appreciated that these wings aren't just about burning the top layer of your tongue off. The flavors are lovely, and you can amp up the spice with more pepper and more (fresh, minced) garlic. 
375 for 55 minutes was produced perfectly crispy and juicy wings

These were great.  Took advise of another reviewer and didn't quite cook for an hour.  Broiled for two minutes at the end.  Added a teaspoon of liquid smoke.  So good.

We loved this! I doubled it since we both like wings and even the left overs were gone by lunch the next day. they were a touch spicy for us, but that's a preference thing and not anything against the recipe. Next time I'll just back off on the chili pepper.

I made these wings twice, the first time as written and they were very good. However, I always try to change by adding other ingredients. I just added some onion powder and 1 tablespoon of honey. Just yummy!

These were so basic and SO good!  I love how simple the recipe is with spices probably in everyone's kitchen.  The wings baked up beautifully in 1hr.  I added crushed red peppers for a little kick - my hubby doesn't take "hot" very well and very little soy sauce.  After these baked up beautifully we served these as is with ranch dressing on the side,, and a combo of melted butter & hot sauce on the side - dip or don't dip was the option.  Using the rack for baking was probably the key to getting these baked up evenly and the skins not "gooey" - I hate gooey.  This is definitely a recipe you can tweak to your liking, but was tasty too, on its own.

Very tasty chicken with the seasoning used. I seasoned the chicken before work and let it marinate in the refrigerator while I was at work. I did all some poultry seasoning as well. When I came home, I put it in the oven (based upon the instructions) and it was delicious.

We love fried chicken wings but I stopped making it as we try to avoid deep frying. This recipe is so simple and the wings were simply too yummy.
I used 1.7 lb of middle portion of chicken wings, 3 tbsp olive oil, replaced the chili powder by 1 tsp cayenne pepper,  1 tsp salt, 1 tsp black pepper powder,  5 cloves of garlic ,  1 tbsp garlic powder and 1 tbsp onion powder.
I served with french beans and rice. 
We couldn't stop eating and three of us finished everything.
I will definitely make it again.

I love love love this recipe!  I have made it at least 6 or 7 times, and the only change I have ever made was using drumsticks one time instead of wings.  So easy even my culinarily impaired husband was able to make these wings with no problems!  It's a simple and delicious way to bake chicken.

Only 4 stars because the directions are off.  I used chicken wing pieces and after 40 minutes they were DONE.  Cook for an hour and they'll be burned to a crisp...lol.  Flavor was very good and I left out the salt.  Will make again especially since chicken is always on sale!

I made this recipe super bowl night. Doubled the recipe because I had 20 wings. Made as is but a little twist. I used a homemade buffalo sauce, found here on all recipe, to add into the seasoning bag. About 2 cups. After baking for the called for time (1 hour) I toss the wings, slightly cooled down, in the remaining buffalo sauce. turned out amazing. Enjoy friends.

I followed the recipe exactly, and these turned out great.  I don't care for spicy/buffalo sauce, so my husband had it on the side and agreed these were good.   I will be making them again.

I adore chicken wings but hate frying anything.  Messy and fat laden.  Being as I used to own a chili restaurant I shy away from chili powder so I substituted Emeril's seasoning and adjusted the salt.  Added 1/2 teaspoon smoked paprika.  Crispy, healthy, I love you Allrecipes!

For New Years day 2016 we had a "Wing-Off" competition (only 3 entries) and this recipe along with the Crispy Honey Sriracha Wings recipe (thank you, Chef John) tied for first - this one for the non-spicy category, Honey Sriracha for the (mildly) spicy recipe. In second place was another delicious recipe, (Food Network: Classic Hot wings) but a tad to hot for several of us.

I'm not sure if I did something wrong. I don't believe I did because I followed the directions completely and this was the worst wings I've ever made. The skin was soggy even after cooking for an hour and 15 minutes. The seasoning tasted terrible, we had to take the skin off to eat the meat. I did follow the suggestion of putting the wings on a rack and turning it after 30 min. Sorry but I will not be making this again.

Thanks for sharing.  I simply added a few twist in terms of spices and omitted the garlic just because I am not a big fan.  It's still your recipe overall and it was delish!  Thanks again for sharing.

Really I'd give 3.5 stars. I followed the recipe exactly as written except baked for 45 min, flipping halfway. I let the wings marinade in the mixture overnight. These smelled great cooking. Upon opening the marinade I feared they'd be too garlicky. I was right upon taking my first few bites. The pressed garlic along with the powder & chili seasoning was kind of boring. It just tasted like garlicky chili. I had kind of hoped for a lil more. Was hoping other flavors would dominate, but no. These were not as crispy as I'd anticipated reading the reviews from others. I think these need something a lil fresher that would mellow out the garlic. Still I could see this being a decent base recipe for baked wings.

Wow, these are phenomenal! I had a huge pack of 20 drums & wings (drums with wings attached) from Sam's Club. I added a tsp. of onion powder to the original recipe and then doubled it and used it  on half of the chicken. Then for the other half, I again doubled the recipe but also added in a good amount of hot wing sauce to the mixture. I cooked them on convect at 350°. When they were done, I served the ones without the wing sauce to the kids, who devoured them, and I tossed ours in a bag with 50/50 hot wing sauce and butter. My husband is a HUGE hot wings fan and he said these were, hands down, the best he's ever had! Be sure to serve then with a high quality Blue Cheese dressing like Marie's and some celery. Next time I'll make homemade blue cheese. You have to try these! You will not be disappointed!!!

Real easy to make and has a great taste. I did add onion powder and poultry seasoning though. I also put the wings on a cookie rack with a pan underneath to catch the juices.

We loved these wings!  Took previous reviewers' advice and added hot sauce (Sriracha) and marinated for 2-3 hours. Next time I'm tempted to add a touch of honey. Thanks for the tasty and healthy recipe idea!

These were good but not great. I followed the recipe as written with 3 adjustments. I marinated them for about  5 hours, added a bit of honey to the marinade as we like the spicy hot but sweet flavour and some onion powder. The wings didn't have a pop of flavour as you ate them, more of a very subtle taste, but not subtle enough to be called bland. We ended up tossing them in some hot sauce to kick them up a notch. I'll try them again and tweak the marinade, probably with some hot sauce, till I find the right combination for our tastes.

This is a GREAT recipe, mostly because it taught me how to make good flavorful, crispy-but-moist chicken wings. I made much more than 10 wings, so I just added as much seasoning as made sense for my taste - no measurements and plenty of cayenne pepper.

Really enjoyed this recipe! Came out really tender & juicy. I substituted the chili powder with cayenne pepper & added some garlic powder as well. I baked it for an hour with the top covered with foil then put the broiler on for about 5 minutes without foil cover to give the chicken some color. Absolutely delicious!

"Que RICO!" said my husband last nite.  I added 1tsp cayenne & 1tsp of paprika.  Recipe needs about 1tsp of salt in the oil mix.  I made 1 pkg of wings (10 large wings). This has since become my easy/delish go to wing recipe!!! :-)

Very easy and very good. Toss them in Frank's hot sauce after they come out of the oven and they taste like restaurant hot wings. So good!

Last week we tried this recipe and want to say that the wings were very tasty and we were instantly addicted! Tonight's menu...  chicken wings!  We did have just a few left over, because there's just two of us,  and we heated them gently on the stove top the next day for lunch,  finding them still as delicious as can be! Thank you for sharing!!

First time making chicken wings and these were really good! I did cut off the little wing from my chicken wings. Anyway, made exactly as stated. Will make again now that I know how easy these are to make. I marinated in a big Ziploc bag for about 4 - 5 hours.

Only thing I did different was add 2 tsps of Franks Hot Sauce to the mix and after an hour of baking they were not very crispy at all so I broiled them for about 5 minutes. I could only eat 2 before I got turned off them but my hubby thought they were okay, just not much taste or heat.  Will not repeat since I have a bunch of other chicken wing recipes that are way better.  Sorry I couldn't give this a better review.

Perfect flavor.  The only thing I did differently is that I let the chicken marinate for one hour in the fridge in the plastic bag.  Did some chicken wings and some drumsticks and they all came out perfectly in one hour.  Flavorful, but not too spicy.  We'll be making these again and again!

Results were perfect!  Well earned 5 stars! The only minor variations I made were 1. doubled the marinate ingredients to get more penetration and coating, 2. marinated one hour prior to cooking, 3. rotated the wing drum sticks 180 degrees after the first 30 minutes.

Followed the recipe exactly.  This was perfect!  Even my picky kids (and one on a gluten/casein/egg free diet) loved it.  It's difficult finding one dish the whole family likes.

Simple, easy & delicious! I actually substituted 1 tsp paprika & 1 tsp cayenne pepper since I did not have chili powder and I made chicken drumsticks & thighs instead of wings - everybody loved them!

These tasted like any baked chicken wings. There was hardly any flavor at all. Disappointed.

So I experimented with 2 chicken recipes here.  This one and another one that requires breading.  My family prefers this one.  This recipe has the look of the baked KFC chicken.  I used this on a family pack of chicken drumsticks.  Such an easy, economical meal, and very tasty too.  This will be in my dinner rotation.  I have added BBQ sauce on top for a change and it's good as well.  I recommend this recipe!

This was a great recipe, my husband said the BEST chicken he ever had! I did add 1 tsp of onion powder and then 10 minutes before it was done I drizzled Frank's Red Hot Sweet Chili sauce on the wings. Turned out great and we can't wait to make it again!

I loved that it was moist & fall off the bone but it didn't have much flavor in my opinion. I may try it again with a couple of tweaks and see if it doesn't come out better.

I always love to find recipes that are easy to make on a weeknight, and this one has become part of my repertoire. I followed the instructions as written, and the wings came out juicy and flavorful. Another thing I like about this recipe is that I have all of the ingredients on hand in the pantry. Throw some spices and pressed garlic in a bag with a little bit of olive oil, add the chicken pieces and squeeze and move them around to coat - what could be easier?

I let the chicken wings marinate all day and then baked them, they were fantastic!  My family liked them, so definitely going to make them again.

LOVED this recipe. I smashed the garlic instead of pressing it [i dont have a garlic press] used garlic salt instead of garlic powder and salt, and added 1/2 tsp cumin. Turned out fantastic. A bit oily but delicious nonetheless. Will make it again for sure.

It Was Easy To Make & Fast Only An Hour To Cook. It Was Okay. I Didnt Have Chili Powder. So Maybe I Will Try This Again When I Have Some. Maybe Thats What It Was Missing As Far As Taste.

We baked on two sheets -- both made exactly as written, but on one of the sheets we added a little dab of a thick wing sauce (Syberg's) on top right before baking.  The sauced batch was superior by far.  It didn't even taste like sauce -- it just tasted punchier than the first batch.  We noticed that the unsauced batch also had a LOT of juice running in the bottom of the tray.  We think it was that the sauce sealed the skin and locked in all the good flavors from the recipe!

I thought it tasted great.  I too added Frank's hot sauce because I like it not because it needed it.  1 hr cooking time was too long.  I pulled it out at 55 minutes, and then cooked a second batch at 45 minutes.  That was just about right.  If it wasn't "tasty" or was "bland", then maybe let it marinate a while.  Otherwise, I don't see how someone would experience that.  Add some Frank's to the marinade, and then toss in it after cooking.  Tasty!

I just got a deep fryer and this was the first recipe I tried.  As previous reviewer, I added 1 tsp onion powder and 1/4 cup of Hot Wing Sauce - gave it just the right amount of heat.  Baked for about 20 minutes and finished in the fryer for about 2-3 minutes (depends on size of wings).  Shake of salt and fabulous!  Serve extra hot wing sauce on the side or ranch dressing.

This recipe has one flaw. There isn't any flavor. These wings would be great if they had some seasoning salt. I thought since the reviews were so positive I would follow the recipe. That was a mistake. The chicken turned out extremely bland.

Made this for the Texans game this past Monday. (5-0 Baby!) I followed the directions of the recipe, in addtion to adding a bag of garlic parmasean seasoning and a half a cup of Franks original hot sauce. Laid them flat on a cookie sheet UNCOVERED for 40-45 minutes. made about 25 flats. (Didn't make the drumettes) These babies were awesome!! Definitely will be making these for the Super Bowl party!! ;)

I only had a little taste of these drumsticks (which I used instead of wings since they are meatier) because I made them for my husband and children (4 & 2) and out of 16 drumsticks, only 4 were left the following day, which my children then finished for lunch!   They smelled wonderful, nice and garlicky, even from the refrigerator the next day.   Since I had so many drumsticks, I tripled the sauce measurements and added dried minced onion flakes and fresh thyme (which I happened to have on-hand).  Also, I omitted the hot sauce, not knowing how hot it would turn out since my children were eating them, too, and sprinkled a little salt & pepper on the actual drumsticks before covering them with the sauce (salt & pepper also went into the ingredient mixture)  The ingredients made a nice, mushy paste which I spread all over the chicken with my hands instead of shaking them.  Can't wait to make them again at the end of this week!!

This is the best chicken wing recipe I've tried!  Even my kids liked it AND their friends.  I added some BBQ sauce to the wings and baked them for about 10 more minutes and got rave reviews.

These were super easy and delicious, but next time I make them I'll cut down on the olive oil.  They didn't seem very oily when I put them in the oven but once they were done they were sitting in a puddle.  They were crispy and had a good texture, but I think you could definitely get away with using less.

These are so simple and good! Leave them in for an extra 15 minutes so they get crispier.

My Family of six enjoyed these chicken wings.  I think for 30 wings, I needed less oil than it called for.  Still were tasty though.

I made this tonight with 14 wings in a toaster oven. It is good. I usually marinade wings overnight but this is the first time I didn't so I understand why some may find the inside a bit bland. But this recipe is simple and quick and I will try it again except next time, I may experiment with a bit of additional herbs. Almost forgot, I did read the recipe wrong and put more garlic powder than chili powder, which is fine as I like garlic anyways. I even added a few more cloves of garlic since I had a lot at hand. I also brushed on some Frank's Red Hot on both sides and broiled them for 8-9 min each side to dry it out and give it a more crispy finish. Next time, I will also use much less olive oil as there's a big pool of oil left after cooking. Probably just enough to coat the ingredients to the wings. Overall I will give this recipe 4 stars.

WOW! It was delicious!  I dipped some in hot sauce and my boyfriend ate his with out anything.  To the olive oil I added some rosemary and substituted garlic powder for garlic salt and also added a southwestern flavored season-all plus of course the garlic cloves.

Awesome!  My husband finally wants me to make chicken wings now that he tasted this receipe.  The wings have a drier texter which I was looking for and then the added bonus of a 'good bite'.

These were not that good.  Although nicely crisped, they were surprisingly bland.  I followed the recipe exactly, except for adding 1 tsp onion powder on the recommendation of other reviewers.  My three children each took one bite and refused to eat any more although they usually like chicken.  If I were to make these again, I would substitute garlic salt for the garlic powder.  But I can't imagine that I will make them again.

These are fantastic and so easy. When we cook wings on the grill they always get a little burned or not completely cooked, and these are the perfect solution. Delicious!

Easy to make and everyone liked them to some degree. My husband would have liked them spicier, and my younger saughter would have liked them less spicy. Next time, I'll make 2 batches. Thanks!
