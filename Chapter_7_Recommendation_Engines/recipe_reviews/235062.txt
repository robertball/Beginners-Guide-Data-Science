It's wonderful! I imagine it's more wonderful with the exact ingredients. Didn't have coconut rum or sesame oil so I substituted coconut oil. Replaced Syrian zaatar with Cumin(1tblsp) & added a heaping tblsp of sesame seeds. It was a touch salty for us so next time I'll use less soy. It's a new favorite!

This turned out a lot better than I had anticipated. I made it more out of curiosity honestly. I despise the flavor of coconut rum so I used regular rum instead. The only other change I made is that instead of using garlic and red pepper flakes I used Huy Fong brand chili garlic sauce. I love that stuff in all of my ramen type soups. No doubt this was an unusual recipe but it is good. It is too salty though so I suggest using low sodium sauce and cutting back on it too. I did not use the optional Syrian zaatar so I cannot vouch for it made with that. I enjoyed this and am glad I finally broke down and gave it whirl.
