I didn't have agave so I subbed in honey. We also have almond sensitivities, so I used peanut butter instead. Since I knew it would have a strong peanut butter flavor, I skipped the cinnamon and added dark chocolate chips. It turned out exactly how I'd hoped!  Thank you SO much for sharing this recipe!

Love that these are made with healthier alternatives to regular flour and sugar. Tossed the old fashioned oats in my Vitamix to make the flour and then added everything else as directed.  I didn't have agave syrup so I used raw unfiltered honey.  The batter was a little thick even for my Vitamix but it did the job just fine. A less powerful blender "might" have an issue with the thick batter. I filled the muffin liners about 3/4 full.  I used the tiny muffin liners and it made 24 tiny muffins and I had enough batter left for 6 regular sized muffins. The tiny muffins were done in 10 minutes while it took 13 minutes to bake the regular size muffins.  Not too much banana or nut flavor and they were not overly sweet. Just right! These little gems bake up so moist and delicious and the flavors mingle well.

I really wanted to love this muffin, I made it  just like it was written. My BlendTec had no issue with the blending. However after I blended the oats I took them out and reloaded my ingredients in the correct sequence for my blender. I liked the texture of this muffin but the flavor was not there for me. I wish the amount of bananas was in cups instead of three bananas. My three were about 1 cup. Also I may add more agave or just plain sugar next time to increase the flavor.

I used the base of this recipe but changed half of the things and upgraded it, they were really good, the whole family liked them . I subsututed  1 cup gluten free flour and 3/4 cup coconut flour for the oats, then used 2 eggs instead of 1 , added 1/2 tsp vanilla, cinnamon and fresh grated orange peel, dash nutmeg, then put in1/3 cup of blueberries as well as the Bannanas  . I used honey instead of agave as well. Turned out fantastic. Next time might add walnuts :-)   ( I mixed all dry ingredients together by hand and then the wet then hand stirred both together)

I loved these and so did my kids!!  I only dubbed the almond butter for sunbutter (due to a nut allergy) and added a few mini chocolate chips to the tops.  So so yummy!  The best gluten free muffins.  They were soft and moist and had a great flavor!

As another reviewer mentioned, the dough is very thick and challenged both my blender and food processor!  But they are tasty treats and worth some effort.  I may use applesauce and bananas next time I make them.  I used gluten free oatmeal and egg substitute
