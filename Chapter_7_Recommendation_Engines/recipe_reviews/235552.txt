This was just a little too sweet and cinnamon-y (personal taste preference) for us, but it is very, very  moist from the glaze and easy to make. Also, I really miss the buttery taste that you typically expect in a pound cake.  I added the wine to the cake and the glaze, but I couldn't taste it at all.  Maybe that's why the recipe submitter said to use the cheapest white wine you can find (but I didn't).  Thanks Donnasa.

This is my new GO TO dessert!  I have made 4 of them in the last 2 weeks, and every single time EVERYONE wants the recipe!  I even had one friend whose husband hid it in the laundry room so their children didn't eat it all!  
I made one change, not a big one, and I don't know if it makes a difference, but when I put the cake in the oven, I also put in a baking dish with water.  My cakes have come out SUPER moist every time!
Thank you for such a Fantastic Recipe!  It's being passed around Huntsville, and I expect in a few months it will be made all over the states!
