I followed all the instructions but i lightly floured chicken and fried it then tossed it. My household loves lemon so i squeezed a little bit of real lemon in the oil mix and tossed the wings. They were a hit!

Once I learned how to make these, Wing Stop and any other chain restaurant's lemon pepper wings just weren't right! One thing I would suggest is for every teaspoon of lemon pepper seasoning, use 2 teaspoons of olive oil. The seasoning I have can be way too salty if it isn't measured this way.

This recipe is a big hit. My husband loved it. I had to had a tad more olive oil to mix the lemon pepper better.

These are incredible. Slight alteration - I season chicken and let it sit for an hour or so in fridge, then I shake the chicken in flour and use avocado oil to fry (healthy fat and great for frying since it's perfect for really high temperatures). After chicken is fried I brush with olive oil, lemon pepper seasoning and lemon juice mixture. Better than Wing Stops and way more healthy!!!

I opted to bake versus fry the wings as a healthier option (375 degrees for 55 minutes).  They were delicious, but I would probably prefer a bit more lemon pepper flavor the next time.  I expected the wings to be less crispy than fried, but actually, the consistency was perfect.  Good recipe that we'll try again.

This was a "10". I lightly floured them and I also put a little zest in the seasoning.  My family was eating them as fast as I could produce them.  They never made it to the platter!  Great and so easy too!

These are indeed wing stop comparable. I did lightly flour the wings, and used a home deep fryer. I wasn't even done with my 2nd batch of wings when the first was gone. Thanks for the recipe!

Love it!!! I squeezed lemon juice in the mixture as well (got the idea from another review) and performed a 2:1 ratio for each tbsp of lemon pepper seasoning. I had to used 3 tbsp of lemon pepper as I wanted to ensure it had enough flavor and because I cooked more wings. It was perfect!! This recipe was so simple. I served this with roasted potatoes and steamed broccoli and carrots. This is definitely a go-to recipe when we have taste for wings. My husband absolutely loved it!

I made these for a game night and each batch I made disappeared as soon as I placed them on the serving dish! I did lightly flour them though. It added a nice crisp to them. I think they're going to be a game night regular now!

This was an excellent recipe.  I was concerned that there would not be enough lemon pepper coating, but this was actually just right.  I did lightly flour, and I added the zest of one lemon.  I'll be making again and again!

I made these last night and they came out EXTREMELY salty. I definitely recommend using 1 part lemon pepper seasoning to 2 parts of oil/butter to toss your wings in. I don't know if the kind of seasoning I have has a s*** ton of extra salt but OMG, had to wipe all my wings down with paper towels to get the excess off

Decided to try it as described. Kept thinking I am supposed to be doing a pre- s & p before adding recipe ingredients. Had only six pieces ( two small drumsticks, four wingettes), so I divided the recipe exactly in half. Added the oil and seasoning together, directly into a Ziplock sandwich bag. Added and coated the  pieces individually, sealed bag and left in refrigerator over night. Fried later next day and was extremely pleased with the results. Thanks, FleurSweetLoves, for this quick and simple, enjoyable dish.

Loved them, but just can't bring myself to toss them back in the mixture after having raw chicken in the mixture.  So just made a separate bowl of mixture.  Better safe than sorry.  Worked well.

I read through some of the reviews as I always do when trying the recipes on this site. I saw the some people used butter so I used butter instead of olive oil. The wings were great. I’ve made them many times. They taste like the lemon pepper wings from a famous restaurant. Not sure if I can say the name. Not sure about the reviewers who said the wings were salty. They tasted great to me. I have also made with with flour and without like some reviewers. Both ways are great.

My family loved the lemon pepper wings!  I added a little more lemon pepper because we really like this flavor.  We even get extra seasoning when we order from Wingstop.  The recipe was extremely easy.

Fantastic. Prepared the wings, patted them dry and let them rest uncovered on a rack in the fridge for a while to dry. Then coated the wings lightly with flour. Fried 8 - 10 minutes. I like them with a lot of flavor, so I sprinkled more Lawry's Lemon Pepper seasoning on the freshly coated wings.  Crispy outside and tender inside. Not just more economical but taste better than carry out too!

Great recipe. Made for NYE and family loved it. Followed the 2:1 teaspoon ratio of olive oil to lemon pepper seasoning as one user suggest. I baked-fried in oven at 400 degree and wings turned out great! Now I can make my own lemon pepper wings when I get my cravings.

Love this recipe. However I did make a couple of changes. I marinade the wings over night with a cup of lemon juice and minced garlic and I lightly floured before frying. They were amazing.

I LOVE wing stop's "lemon pepper" wings. And where I'm located we don't have a wing stop, but I had a strong craving for some lemon pepper wings so I took to the internet to see if I could find a fairly easy recipe and came across this one. It was spot on! I will be making my own lemon pepper wings from here on out! Tanks for sharing :)

Spot on in flavor and crispiness.  I used the bone in wings and the meat was tender and juicy.  Family loved them!

Not bad at all! I did lightly flour the wings before frying them and they came out nice and crunchy. I will be making this again for sure since everyone loved them!!!

Ok, I had to change up a teeny bit: #1, after reading the other reviews, I decided that we would enjoy more seasoning on ours but I didn't have enough lemon pepper so I had to combine it with a Sicilian dipping blend I had on hand and I used 2 tablespoons of that and the olive oil. #2: The wings still looked "rubbery" after the 8 minute fry time, so I increased it to about 12 minutes total because we just HATE rubbery chicken skin. When they were done I had to hold them for about 45 minutes for my hubs to arrive, which I did in a warm oven in a pyrex baking dish. They were indeed crispy and delicious! We will do this again and again and I might even try expanding it to replace a fried chicken dinner for a nice change. Thanks for this tasty and easy recipe!

I made two changes to the recipe. First I allowed the wings to marinate in the lemon pepper seasoning for a few hours.  I also raised my oven temperature to 450 because they were baking but not  getting crispy.  They came out great, my family loved  them!

Family love it! Supper easy to male. I did marinate the wings quickly in lemon juice. Not for long though because of time. For extra flavor I added real lemon juice and lemon extract along with some pepper. Not that it  was needed though. I'll be making this quick recipe for my family again and again!

Family loved this recipe. The seasoning is not necessarily salty --but very, very tangy.  When I make this in the future, I will do 2 tsp of lemon pepper to 1 Tbsp of oil.

I baked these in the oven, but seasoned exactly as recipe calls for and they were amazing! But...I do think for tastes sake that they would be better fried. Definitely making again.

The only thing I did differently from this recipe was lightly flour the wings. It was spectacular, quick and simple. I can honestly say that I will use this recipe many times in the future.

Not one of my favorites. Followed recipe directly. Next try I will add more lemon pepper and let the wings set in season at least an hour before frying in order to incorporate more flavor

The whole family loved this one! As some of the other reviewers suggested, I floured the chicken lightly prior to frying. Fried until the skin was golden and crispy. It was delicious.

I added a pinch of celery salt but it was very good and I'm looking forward to using this recipe again.
