The recipe was decent not to say it wasn't bad.  However, it may be good to spice up the meat a little with some taco seasoning and maybe add some onions.  Something was missing and in my next go around, those additions, plus a little hot sauce should do the trick.

Easy to prepare and yummy!  I made a few very minor changes: I didn't have tomatoes with chiles so I used one can diced tomatoes and one small can chopped green chiles; added one small can sliced black olives (I love black olives!); I seasoned the meat/rice mixture with garlic powder and onion powder.  I served with sour cream and salsa.  I might use taco seasoning in the meat/rice mixture the next time I make this but it was yummy as I made it last night.

This was an excellent recipe.  Surprisingly, the tortilla chips were delightful.  They were crisp yet a little chewy, just like nachos.  I loved it.  I added a few things, instead of tomatoes with green chiles I used some fresh hot peppers, dried chipotle seasoning, cayenne pepper, and some frontera chipotle salsa and fresh tomatoes.  I also added cheese to the top.  It truly was a great base for a great casserole.

We loved this! I read some reviews before I made it and added a package of taco seasoning along with an extra can of drained and rinsed black beans. I also layered it. Chips, cheese, mixture, chips cheese, mixture, cheese on top.... Served it with sour cream and chips, it was DELICIOUS!!!!

YUM! This was totally delicious! My husband and I both loved it. As much as I hate when people rate a recipe and say they changed it, well I must admit I made some small changes too. First off I had to use kidney beans because I was out of chili beans. I also added chili powder, garlic powder, and a bit of taco seasoning. I also used less ground beef and more rice because that's what I had on hand.  Still this came out awesome. I wasn't really sure about using Velveeta instead of shredded cheddar but it melted nicely and was perfect on the chips. Using any other cheese I think would've resulted in the dish being too dry. I think next time I wouldn't drain the can of tomatoes and chili's either because I think it could use that extra liquid. We plan on using the leftovers tomorrow to make a taco salad. I'll be making this again and again! Now if only you could make my picky kids eat it!

Loved this recipe! My brother and boyfriend really seemed to enjoy it:) I added some taco seasoning and Mrs. Dash southwestern seasoning to give it a little kick and served it with salsa and sour cream on the side. My boyfriend suggested that it might taste even better with Fritos instead of tortilla chips. Totally making this again :)

Made it almost exactly as the recipe, just added taco seasoning to the meat and only used probably a cup of cheese all together.  Everyone really liked it!

This was great.  My kids are 4 and 7 and they ate it all.  I get tired of making the same ground beef meals.  This changes it up.  Very easy  to make.  Thanks.

This is quick and easy, especially if you are in a pinch for time! I would suggest adding a pack of taco seasoning to give it a little umph.

The first time around, this was AWESOME! The family loved it! I did add taco seasonings to the meat. The 2nd time around I used chicken. Instead of taco, I mixed enchilada sauce with the chicken, rice, tomatoes, chilies, and beans. I put the chips on the bottom, then the meat mixture, shredded cheese, more chips, meat, and cheese. It turned out great! It was sort of like a chicken enchilada casserole with crunch! I recommend not using an awful lot of enchilada sauce. You don't want the meat mix to drip or you'll have soggy chips.

My family loved this! Only changes I made were to add some minced onion and mex seasoning while browning the meat and also I didn't have processed cheese, so I made a layer of sliced american cheese (which of course is also processed) an it turned out fine. I think I will make it for SuperBowl as a hearty dip. Probably omit the tortilla layer and double the tomatoes to make it a little thinner. YUM! Will def make again as I usually have all the ingredients on hand.

Soooo yummy and soooooo easy!!! I add minced garlic, chopped onion, and some spices and/or taco seasoning to the beef. This is a dish I'll make about once a month. Great "go-to" for pot-lucks or taking to family and friends.

Disappointing. Too salty. The proportions seemed off to me.
