I've been looking for main dish recipies that contain fruit, as it is a nice change from meat-and-veg recipies.  This is absolutely delicious, and the kids especially love the fruit.  As always, I was looking for recipies at 5 pm, so instead of marinating the chicken, I just baked it drizzled in olive oil and s&p, then added the relish & almonds right before serving.  I also toasted the almonds while the chicken was baking.
