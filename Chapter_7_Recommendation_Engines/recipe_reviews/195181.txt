I changed nothing in this recipe and it was perfect!  I loved it! I have been using my leftover sauce on everything; noodles, chicken marinade, on salads, and I've dipped veggies in it as a snack!  It's fantastic!

Very good, thank you.  I love recipes where everything can be made ahead of time and then assembled just before eating.  Makes dinner a snap!  I put the pork in the marinade last night before going to bed and grilled the pork chops at lunch time while I cut up the carrot and cucumber.  Although I didn't have any peanut sauce, I used the Thai Peanut Butter Sauce recipe from here and made 1 serving, which was 1/4 cup exactly.  Bf thought the sauce was a bit weird; not sure why but he did say he liked it.  We like lettuce wraps in this house and this was a twist on them that we really enjoyed.  I didn't have the noodles or the cilantro so just left them out.  Since we did like these so much the next time I make them I'll try to get the noodles and see if we like them any better.  Thanks for the recipe!

I changed this recipe just a bit. I marinated the pork in teriyaki before cooking. Then added in minced garlic during the cooking process. The end result was awesome. My kids loved it and this dish is a keeper for us.
