Great recipe, used pepper jack Monterrey cheese for some flavor boost.
This recipe calls for neither potatoes nor politics.   It’s a cooking site, not the Washington Post.

Very delicious. Just finished making it and really enjoyed it. Even my 6 y.o., who is a picky eater, ate his whole serving. Would definitely make again.

If I could give this a 6th star, I probably would. Definitely was easier to have two of us working together to make the dish. But it was incredibly good.

I was in a big hurry so left out the chicken, but added a little extra bacon and my husband really liked this.  Will make again and will probably leave the chicken out again, since we have a couple of "favorite" ways we make chicken.  We only eat organic chicken and sometimes our health food store is out of it by the time I get there.  

Will have to start using more pasta in recipes, too because yesterday I went to the grocery store (I was in a hurry so I just shopped at a nearby regular store, not an organic based operation) and I had to pay $5.40 for 5 lbs of red potatoes!   Imagine that.  We used to get them just last year for about $1.99 for 5 pounds.  Good grief, can't afford to eat any longer!  These people are pricing themselves right out of business and soon only the rich will be able to survive.  Do you suppose that's the plan??  Then again, pasta isn't cheap anymore either.  Yikes.

Definitely a keeper. Like another reviewer said- not a quick meal but very tasty. Not sure about reheating- afraid it will dry out.....oh, and I used elbow noodles, didn't have bowties.

This was delicious! I have been looking to change up my pasta bakes and this one was definitely a winner! I think the only change I made was adding more bacon on top.

Will make this again but I will cook the bacon and chicken beforehand to save time and easier clean up.

Very good recipe for using leftover roasted chicken breasts.  My husband loved it !  He took leftovers to work for lunch, as well.  I loved it too !  At first I thought 8 slices of bacon would be too much, so I only cooked 5 slices.  Should have stuck to the recipe and used all 8.  Oh well … there's always next time !

It was pretty good. I would not call it fast. I used rotisserie chicken and fresh bacon. Everyone at the tablet liked it but its not the first pick due to the multiple pans and time it took.

I have already made this twice within the two weeks that I have been at my son and daughter in law's place.   They all loved it and my grandchildren cleaned their plates.  I thoroughly enjoyed making it and more importantly I loved watching my family eat dinner.

My husband and I made this and thought it was really good. My husband is diabetic so we used vegetable rotini instead of farfalle as we could not find vegetable farfalle but we did not make other changes. This is a keeper and will be placed in our meal rotation plan.
