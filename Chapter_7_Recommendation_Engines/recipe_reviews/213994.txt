Good basic recipe, but lacked the punch I was looking for - maybe some Jalepenos, tomatoes, or green onions would spruce it up a bit. Still, a good start for an exceptional meal.

This was great! I did cut the recipe in half. I didn't have any ground sausage on hand so I used 6 Morning Star brand fake sausage patties maple flavor & it was delicious!  My meat eating husband loved it!  I also added 2 extra garlic cloves.

Good basic strata. I halved the recipe, used vegetarian sausage and a nice crusty whole wheat bread. I baked it in a 8x8 baking dish. The next time I would use a 9x9 dish.

I made this recipe without any alterations except using a different type of cheese. It was really good!  I literally just made it a few hours ago for breakfast for my sister's birthday!  I used butter flavored crouton mixed with Caesar croutons. Will surely make this again!

I tried five stores and couldn't find vegetarian Italian sausage. I'm sure this would have been better with seasoned vegetarian "meat," but the only kind I found made this sort is "meh." Next time, I'll add in Mexican seasoning, use sharp cheddar cheese, and serve with salsa.

My vegetarian friends all ate seconds - so yummy!  Great way to use up leftover stuffing bread cubes.  My carnivore husband said it would be better with real meat.

Made this with a 1/2 pound of bacon, that's what I had on hand.  My husband loved it!

Skipped the sausage, and added spinach. It was a hit!

Instead of vegetarian sausage I used diced turkey ham which went real well with the green pepper and Swiss cheese.

Easy, economical, and delicious!  I used left over pork roast because that is what I had at home. Would work great with many types of meats.
