This pie is fantastic. I made no exceptions to the recipe - using real butter and real buttermilk. I did, however add 1 tsp. of pumpkin pie seasoning. My husband, brother in law, and father in law all three loved it, and they were raised down south on grandma's recipe - very hard to impress! Everyone else raved too, and I ended up having to make more! It was not just my first sucessful sweet potato pie, it was the first time to impress my father in law! Thanks for this flawless recipe!

I modified this a little. Used caned yams, 1 tsp pumpkin pie spice and half white sugar and half brown. 
Because it takes while to cook I also lined the crust with aluminum foil and removed it 10 minutes prior.
Turned out wonderful!

I followed the recipe to a "T"...snuck a bite of the filling and couldn't wait to try it cooked! My husband said this is the best sweet potato pie he has ever had and I have to agree.

I baked two of these pies for a dinner we are having at our church for boys from a boys home...I bet the boys will feel as if they are having some of their mom's cooking. They won't be home for the holidays but my prayer is that they will feel like home came to them. Thank you.

OH MY GOD? THIS IS THE BEST SWEET POTATO PIE YOU WILL EVER PUT IN YOUR MOUTH. EVEN MY SON WHO WILL NOT EAT SWEET POTATOES, COULD NOT GET ENOUGH OF IT. I DID THOUGH ADD A LITTLE PUMPKIN PIE SPICE(BUT JUST A LITTLE) OTHER THAN THAT DO NOT CHANGE A THING.
THANKS

This recipe is exceptional!  I tripled the recipe for a luncheon at work and everyone loved the results. My modifications to the recipe: I used almond extract in place of the vanilla, 1/4 tsp. nutmeg, mixed 1/2 brown and 1/2 white sugar, & 1/4 tsp. pumpkin pie spice. I will make this recipe again and again.  THANKS for sharing.

I found this recipe last night, tried it today at work and everyone loved it.  Now I will prepare it for 64 for our Black History Meal at work.  It was easy, and the cooking time was accurate. The flavor as written was terrific and I also added nutmeg and cinnamon to one pie and they loved that too.

This is exactly what I was looking for. I changed it somewhat to use 6 tart shells I had, and the recipe amount was perfectly fitting. Also, since I don't have white sugar in the house used approx. 1/4 cup brown sugar. A wonderful result...the buttermilk seems to add custard-like texture and a bit of tang without heaviness given by cream.

I'm a big fan of sweet potato pies and this recipe is a real winner.  Here are a few suggestions:  try baking the potatoes instead of boiling. It will give them a slightly sweeter taste, thus allowing you an option to reduce the added sugar. Pur√©e potato mixture in food processor or blender for a lighter silkier texture.  Add spices: cinnamon, nutmeg and ginger ( I used 1/4 t of each for a doubled recipe. Lastly, press a few broken pecan pices into the bottom of pie shell before filling.

This pie is out of this world! I like that it specifies the amount of sweet potato to add and that it includes little butter. I made some changes though. I tasted the batter as I made it and I decided to reduce the sugar to 3/4 cup, 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/4 cup white sugar. It was just right. I also eliminated the baking soda because I find that it adds an unpleasant flavour to dishes.  Lastly, I added 2 tablespoons of flour to thicken the mixture - I had left the sweet potatoes to cool in a pot of water, and although I squeezed excess water from them, the flesh was still moist. So if you boil your sweet potatoes, I recommend that you remove them from the pot as soon as they're tender.

this is the sweet potato pie recipe I have always used. The buttermilk is the key to this recipe. I've tried other recipes that call for milk or evaporated milk and it's just not as good. I always add a little nutmeg and cinnamon and I use only 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/2 brown sugar. This is always on our table at Thanksgiving and Christmas!

Great recipe. I am diabetic and was searching for a lower fat but great tasting way to eat more sweet potatoes. This buttermilk recipe is the best I have found. I added one tsp of Pumpkin Pie Spice and put the chopped pecans on the floor of the pie crust before putting the filling in. I covered the entire edge of the pie crust so it didn't get burned during the 70 minute cooking time and substituted Splenda for the white sugar. Fantastic results and the best low fat sweet potato pie I have found. Thanks.

Fabulous recipe!  Every other sweet potato pie I've eaten and/or baked tastes like a super sweet pumpkin pie.  This recipe is easy and the pie tastes fab and (as it should) like it should...a sweet potato pie!

These pies turned out great! I do think the addition of buttermilk was key. I added 1/2 tsp each of cinnamon and nutmeg and used 1/2 c white sugar, 1/2 c brown sugar.  Tip: puree the sweet potatoes...makes for smoother pies!

My mother and I do not particularly care for pumpkin pie and we wanted to find and alternative for Thanksgiving.  Our whole family likes sweet potatoes (we usually bake them and eat them like baked potatoes), so we thought we'd give this a try.  This pie was an overwhelming success!!!!  It is nice and creamy and quite delicious - we've found a new family tradition.  Thank you!!! I just wanted to add that I made one of the these pies to take to a work potluck - and I am now being told that I am the "official" sweet potato pie maker for our potlucks!  One of my co-workers liked it so much that she has had me make one for her family the last 2 Thanksgivings (and she comes from a true southern family - not too bad for a northern girl, I must say!!)

This pie was excellent!  Easy to prep, mix-up and bake.  I did change a couple of things just to suit our family.  I cut the sugar to 1/4 c and added allspice, nutmeg and cloves about 1/4 t each.  This pie turned out light in flavor and set perfectly (did not separate from the shell or turn watery).  This was my first try at Sweet Potato Pie and I am very glad I selected this recipe.  I do believe as others have said that the buttermilk makes the difference in the creamy texture.  Will DEFINATELY be making this pie again.

This pie went QUICK! I made exactly to a T. However, the part of the directions in step 2 that states "mix in spices if desired" really stumped me for a moment. I really didn't want to over spice the mixture nor did I want to add the wrong spice at this point. So I did 2 shakes of Pumpkin Pie spice and 2 shakes of ground cinnamon(can't tell you if that was an offical tsp or not, but that's what I shook in. And my BIL said it was seasoned just beautifully. I'll make this again. And to think I've never made a sweet potato pie before. I have to say, it was my favorite pie that I made for Thanksgiving.

So tasty and very easy to make.  I also made it with pumpkin and was equally as good. I did add some spices and alterered it a little once for my vegan sister. You couldn't even tell the difference.

This was very easy and very tasty. Everyone enjoyed it and it was especially good using a homemade crust from an old cookbook. Nice change from the standard pumpkin pie.

This is the BEST sweet potato pie I have ever made and is now the ONLY recipe I will use.  My husband, stepson, and friends LOVED it!  It baked perfectly; it wasn't runny; the crust baked perfectly with the pie.  I used Pet Ritz deep pie shells.    The only change I made was the sugar.  I used brown sugar instead of white sugar and only a half cup instead of a full cup.  Since I did not have any buttermilk I used skim milk mixed with lemon juice.

This is my first attempt at making homemade sweet potato pie, and in my opinion, this recipe is great. I did, however, alter it a bit. I baked my potatoes instead of boiling them. I didn't have any buttermilk, so I used evaporated milk instead. I used a half a stick of margarine instead of real butter (I don't like real butter), and instead of 1 c. white sugar, I used 1/2 c. white sugar and 1/2 c. brown sugar. Also, I added 1/2 t. cinnamon, 1/4 t. of each of the following : allspice, ginger, cloves, and nutmeg. It came out great, though it could have been a little bit  sweeter, so next time I will up the white sugar 1/4 cup. 

I doubled the recipe, and got 3 pies out of it, though each one could have been just a little bit fuller (I ran out of batter). Even though they were a tiny bit short, they came out just fine.

Thank you for this wonderful recipe! No more store bought pies for me! They do not compare to this....

This recipe is IT. I have made it several times as written: use fresh potatoes, it makes the difference. It is so good, the pie I made for a friend never made it to the rest of the family after their son discovered it one night. My only personal touches are pumpkin pie spice or cinnamon, nutmeg and ginger and Mexican vanilla.

I have never tasted sweet potato pie. I just happened upon this recipe & decided to try it. Boy, am I glad I did. There were some changes made by other reviewers but I thought it would be nice to see what the original recipe tasted like. It is so good that I couldn't wait to finish breakfast this morning. That pie was calling to me. So, what harm is it to have a little dessert after breakfast? Tonight, we're going to fix dinner for my 90 year old mom. She use to talk about sweet potato pie and how good it was. I can't wait for her to try this.

Instead of sweet potato, I used canned yams in pineapple orange sauce (drained), so the pie had a slight citrus flavor.  Both the flavor and the texture were terrific!  Next time, I'll try the recipe with plain sweet potatoes to see which I like best.  The cooking time was right on the nose.

Great recipe!  My husband doesn't like pumpkin, and I liked it better than pumpkin pie. On the trial run, I made 2 pies for his co-workers; they loved it, but I found it too sweet. I adjusted the recipe by using 1/2 c. sugar; 1/4 c. brown; 2TB molasses. Then I added a shot of bourbon and spiced it to my taste. It was amazing.

I made this a couple of days ago for my mother and she is the reason I'm giving this four stars. I made only one change and that was to add more sugar and nutmeg. Didn't really have the taste I'm used to but everyone liked it. I will use some of these ideas with the recipe I normally use. Thanks for sharing.

Very good recipe for left over sweet potatoes or yams. I used yams and added ground cloves, fresh ground nutmeg, and a little allspice. The buttermilk gave it a nice tartness and I used less butter than stated for no other reason than to cut the fat in it. I too added Splenda vs. sugar.

This is one of the best sweet potato pies that i have ever tasted. I was kind of worried at first because some of the ingredients were not things that my grandmother use. But after tasting the final product my grandmother better watchout. I did add the cinnimen and nutmeg because of personal taste, but either way it goes this recipe is a keeper.

This was very close to the pie my mom makes but she uses evaporated milk. It was a tad too sweet for me so i may cut the sugar down a little the next time I make it which will be Christmas!! It was very good though and nice and creamy. Husband loved it!

This is one of the best sweet potato pie recipes I've tried. I usually make a spicy pie, but I just added minimal spices to this pie and it was wonderful: just a slight hint of nutmeg and allspice to enhance the delicious sweet potato flavor, which really shines in this pie! I think I'll make my traditional spicy sweet potato pie and this one for Christmas, to figure out which I really like best, but this pie has already become one of my favorites. I substituted evaporated milk for buttermilk, because I don't keep buttermilk on hand, and I replaced the white sugar with 1/8 Cup of molasses, because I prefer to avoid white sugar whenever possible.

Substituted Splenda for sugar. Added 1/2 tsp cinnamon, 1/2 tsp nutmeg, and 1/2 tsp ginger. Cut into 10 slices - 153 calories per slice. Used 15.0 oz of sweet potatoes which may be slightly less than the 2 cups. Used Pillsbury refrigerated pie crust. Excellent!

We loved this! I used 2 C mashed canned sweet potatoes, 2 T smart balance, 1/2 C soy milk (to keep it non-dairy) and 1 t lemon juice.  I also used a graham cracker crust and egg whites instead of whole eggs. Next time, I think I will try cutting back on the sugar and make a topping of cornflake crumbs and brown sugar.  Thanks Kimberly!

Oh my gosh, this was absolutely delicious. I added 1/2tsp nutmeg and 1 tsp cinnamon, but otherwise followed to a T. After baking for 60 min I topped with marshemellow meringue from "Sweet Potato Pie with Marshmallow Meringue Topping" recipe on this site. (This topping was SUPER sweet, so next time I'll cut back the sugar in the pie to 1/2 cup). The result was a heavenly cross of sweet tato pie and sweet tato casserole. My husband put it on his top 5 best pies he's ever eaten!

This was the first time I have ever tasted or made sweet potato pie and it was tasty.  I made these in 3/4 cup ramekins for individual servings and cut the recipe in half. The texture was very creamy and the outside edges were chewy.  I added some spices to the pie. Instead of 1/2 cup sugar I only added 1/3 cup sugar to balance the sweetness of the graham cracker crust. I used a graham cracker crust, made from homemade graham crackers, and it was fabulous. Next time I will try it with a traditional pie crust.  I will be making this recipe again and again.

I made this without any spice and found it to be quite tasty.  Will experiment with some spice next time.

I followed the recipe perfectly but the pie was too sweet (i'd lower sugar to 3/4 of a cup) and was EXTREMELY mushy.

This was a very good pie, however it was a bit sweet for out tastes even though I reduced the sugar to 3/4. Next time I will at least 1/2 it.

I've never had sweet potato pie and this is awesome! I did change the amount of sugar to only 1/2 cup just cause I didn't ant to lose the taste of the sweet potato. This is a keeper Thank you

I grew my own sweet potatoes for this. This recipe was so good, even though I accidentally under-cooked the sweet potatoes before mashing. Everyone loved it!

I've never made a sweet potato pie before -- actually, I'm not even sure I've ever tasted one -- but this was hands-down one of the BEST pies I've ever made or eaten.  Easy to make, too!  I used freshly-cooked and mashed sweet potatoes from my farmer's market, and the pie came out out light and fluffy and not-too-sweet, and just...WOW.  I may never made a pumpkin pie for Thanksgiving again now that I've had this. :)

This was by far the best Sweet Potatoe recipe. I made this for guests and we all raved about how you could taste the sweet potatoe without any spices to overpower the overall flavor.I did use 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/2 brown sugar as suggested in another review. This will become a family classic.

This was so good that I was afraid of eating the whole thing.  I doubled the recipe and took the 2nd pie to work the next day.  My coworkers really enjoyed it.  It was a bit too sweet.. so next time i'll use 3/4ths of the recommended sugar.

Liked it.  Did some improv because that's how I cook.  Improv included using canned yams, drained, rather than fresh.  That worked out great.  Rather than 1c sugar, I used a reduction of the drained liquid from the canned yams...not as good as I'd hoped--needed more sweetness.  I think next time I would add some orange juice and/or brown sugar to it prior to reduction.  Didn't have buttermilk so I used plain yogurt--no problems there.  The final variation was to separate the eggs and beat the whites and fold in.  That worked well, though I beat them maybe a little too stiffly so that they didn't fold in completely.  Nobody complained.  In fact, most everybody in the family wanted more.  So, even with variance that I thought could have been improved, it still worked out great, and still pretty low-cal for a dessert.

Looking forward to making this again this year. Made it last year and remembered thinking it tasted very close to the way my mom made back home in N.C. I did add brown sugar and cinnamon and nutmeg as others suggested, and left out the salt. Thanks for sharing, especially since most pies in Georgia are pumpkin!

I made this pie for Thanksgiving, and it was amazing!  Super yum!  I baked my sweet potatoes.  Then put them through a food mill to get rid of all the "fiberous" parts of the potato.  It made for a much creamier pie.  I will definitely make this again.

This is really good!  I have made it twice--the first time I didn't have quite enough sweet potato; the second time I had too much...  Rather than resort to weights and calculators I simply guessed (and carelessly!) at how much to adjust the other ingredients--It still came out great, both times.  You know you have a good, easy recipe when you can mess it up a bit and it still works!    The spices are necessary in my opinion; I skimped on them somewhat the second time and it just seemed a little too plain for everyone, even my mom who is usually very sensitive to spices.

My husband said don't lose this recipe. It is the best ever. It has consistency, not smooth like pumpkin pie. Very rich. I used a pie crust cutter instead of potato masher...it was easier. Added 1/8 cup molasses.

Absolutely amazing. So simple and delicious results. The only change I made is to add some mixed spice consisting of cinnamon, nutmeg, and clove and switched out the buttermilk for double cream. Yummm!!! My new favorite pie.

Fantastic.  Makes a change from pumpkin pie.  I added some cinnamon, ginger and ground cloves.  Served with a spoonfull of sweetened whipped cream with a drop of vanilla in it.  The kids loved it.

I've made this Sweet Potato Pie probably 10 times and never left a review.  This is one delicious pie and very easy to make.  I do add Cinnamon and Nutmeg about a teaspoon of both.  Try this recipe you won't be disappointed.

The first time I ever had sweet potato pie was at a potluck and it tasted like wet cardboard!!!  I was very shy about trying one again and had no desire to make one, but I have a sweet ten year old who begged me for one.  Low and behold, I tried this recipe, added the teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice and oh mylanta!!!  It is so good, it‚Äôll make your tongue slap your brains out!  I‚Äôll definitely make this again!!!

This is the recipe my husband uses, he is a firm believer in buttermilk and this was one of the only ones that uses it. He adds 1/2 tea of cinnamon and 1/2 of nutmeg. It‚Äôs very yummy, even great grandma was impressed

The texture and overall taste of this piece is excellent.  I would give it 5 stars except it is too sweet.  I lessened the sugar to 3/4 cup and added 2 Tbs molasses (to make it more like brown sugar.)  Still too sweet.  Next time, I would still use the 2Tbs molasses, but lessen the sugar to 1/2 cup.  If I could give 4.5 stars, I would, since I think this is a very minor issue.  I added 1/2 tsp pumpkin pie spice.  I will definitely make this again.

I have made this pie for the last five years.  My husband doesn't want any other one.  The first year I made it, I put 2 cups of flour instead of 2 tablespoons.  My mistake turned in to my daughter's favorite, sweet potato muffins.  But I still had to make the pies.

My new go to sweet potato pie!  Reduced the sugar by 1/4 cup, added 1 teaspoon nutmeg and 1/8 teaspoon cinnamon, perfect for my taste.  Very easy to make.  One other note; I always peel, cut in 1 - 1/2 inch cubes and steam my sweet potatoes.  Another reviewer mentioned baking, which is also a good idea, these cooking methods keep more flavor in the potato.

Traditional sweet potato pie recipe!! My husband loves it, won't eat the spiced pies, this is his favorite. I used 1/2 brown and white sugar. Buttermilk is a must!

Thanks for giving me an outline to make my squash pie. So, I used acorn squash and regular milk because I had no buttermilk. It smells great so we will see. 30 minutes to go!

I didn't know how many sweet potatoes to cook, so i cooked three bigger ones, subsequently forgot to measure the mashed sweet potatoes, and ended up with enough filling for two pies, which still turned out good.

This came out really great! I used 2/3 c. demerara sugar, in place of the 1 c. white sugar and the sweetness was just right. I also used gluten free ap flour in place of the regular ap flour.

This was pretty great as is, but it made way more filling than my pie shell could hold? I guess maybe I should've used a deeper pie plate but I ended up making a couple of tarts too with what crust dough I had left -- I still had to pour some of the filling out! Man. I suspect this would probably fill two relatively shallow pies or like three full sized tart pans. So just maybe keep that in mind when you're making preparations for crust. Still, super delicious, especially with some vanilla ice cream. Great way to use up mashed sweet potato! (I suspect the sweet potato I used may have already had some butter or somesuch mashed into it, so maybe that contributed to my abundance of filling? Either way it baked up fine, we just had too much of it.)

I make a lot of pies for my man, but had yet to make a sweet potato pie. He made the request for pie and I decided to try something new. After searching AR awhile I came across this recipe...

Oh. My. God. It was perfect. Mine cooled overnight, but it was set up when I pulled it out of the oven! 

For the most part, I followed the directions. There's a couple minor tweaks I made though:
1. To cook my sweet potatoes, I simply stabbed them and baked them in the microwave. Easiest, fastest, and to me best way to cook em up.
2. I cut the bake time from 70 minutes to just 60 minutes. The top of my pie was a dark orange/brown.
3. To spice the pie (since the recipe leaves that up to you) I used three spices (in order from most amount, to least amount): cinnamon, nutmeg, & ginger. I only use approx. 1/4 teaspoon of ginger, and just went up from there. It all depends on your taste!

I was super nervous making the pie, my 'mashed' sweet potatoes didn't look anything like they should, they were clumpy. But, it baked up very well and we like a little texture to our pie. If you want it smooth I'd recommend using a hand mixer with the buttermilk to smooth it out!

Very, very good!

This recipe is wonderful. I made this for Thanksgiving and the taste is awesome. I have never made a sweet potato pie without any spices and i was kind of unsure, but i am so glad that i used this recipe. I think that the spices was taking over the sweet potatoes. This is my new way of making it. Thank you Kimberly, for sharing

Excellent!  I made this instead of pumpkin pie for Thanksgiving and it turned out great.  I made it according to the recipe but used Ideal sugar substitute (diabetic in the family) and added 1/2 tsp of cinnamon and nutmeg.  I also baked the potatoes in the oven....left in foil to cool off and the skins literally fell off!  Liked that the recipe gave a definitive measurement for the potatoes.  This will be a keeper for next year.

This was the 1st time I've ever made sweet potato pie from scratch and it came out soooo gooood. Even my husband who was skeptical about me baking loved it. I did add a little ground cinnamon and ground ginger thats why I gave it  a 4.I will never buy pie from the store again.

Followed the recipe to a T and it was perfect never had a better sweet potato pie we loved it so much we had to make more the next day to share with our family! (the only note I would make is that it only took just over 45 min to bake not the recommended 70! Watch it carefully and its perfect!)

I've made about eight of these pies now this fall/winter.  Everyone loves it.  I do add cinnamon and nutmeg to the sugar mixture, as was suggested by the contributor, but pretty much stick to the recipe exactly as written.  Delicious.

A co-worker gave me a HUGE sweet potato from her garden that I used to make this delicious pie.  I added a tiny bit of nutmeg but I honestly don't think the pie needs any spice to be one of the best I've tasted.  I did use 1/2 cup brown sugar as I love anything that has brown sugar in it!

I used sweet potatoes from our garden and substituted 1/2 cup light brown sugar and 1/8 cup white for the 1 cup white sugar. I didn‚Äôt have buttermilk so I used 1/2 tablespoon lemon juice and added whole milk to make 1/2 cup sour milk. I added 1/8 teaspoon ginger, cinnamon and nutmeg. It was delicious. I will definitely make this again.

Made this exactly as per recipe except substituted plain yogurt for buttermilk as one reviewer suggested. VERY dry. Needed more liquid from the start. Even putting it into the pie shell......it was basically spooning in dry mashed potatoes. I did bake my own sweet potatoes, perhaps it would be moister with canned.  Pie was already "set" going into the oven, and then just proceeded to crack at that point. After reading some other recipes that use evap milk, I think I'll try one of those next time. I actually did add about 1/4 cup milk to this when I saw how dry it was, but it didn't help much. Disappointed as I was making it specially for a guest at Thanksgiving.  Tasted ok I guess. Mild flavor, not too spicy which was nice. Served with plenty of whipped cream to offset dryness.

I love the recipe and so did all my friends. The texture was exceptional. I added cinnamon, nutmeg, and ginger, same amounts as on the Libby's pumpkin can for pumpkin pie.  I used a bit more sweet potato than called for, as I like a deep pie. so I also added a couple of tablespoons of egg whites. and a little extra baking soda, and maybe a little extra buttermilk. I often play it by ear when cooking and baking! Otherwise, just follow the recipe.

This was fantastic!  I took a few others‚Äô recommendations and added 1/2 brown sugar and 1/2 white and also 1/4 tsp.pumpkin pie spice. I had baked 4 small sweet potatoes, wrapped in foil, for 90 minutes at 350¬∞ the day before, then mashed them. I highly recommend this recipe!

I roasted the potatoes. They fell out of their skins. I also added a  bit of nutmeg, cinnamon, cloves and ginger. I also doubled the vanilla. And made the buttermilk 3/4 cup. It was the best sweet potato  pie I have ever made or ever had! But I substantially dressed up  the recipe.

This is a great recipe. This is my go to recipe for sweet potato pie. This pie is delicious and my family loves it. I double the recipe because one pie is never enough. The only change I make is I use Brown sugar in stead of white.

No Substitutions!  LOL
I made this pie with no substitutions.  All I can say is Ooh LA LA!!!! 
I totally disagree with the person who said the pie was too sweet, the pie is perfect the way it's written.
I made this at my sons request for his friend, his friend was craving a homemade sweet potato pie.  I made 2 with this recipe, one plain and one topped with caramelized pecans with my own rolled out pie crust.  Needless to say he loved them.
Thank you for the wonderful recipe.

Very good foundation of a southern classic sweet potato pie. However I used 1 stick of butter. I followed directions to the "t" other than that but after making would definitely do some things different. For example, only one cup of sugar in recipe but pie could have been sweeter. Next time will increase to 1 1/2 cups of sugar. Secondly I would add more vanilla and add cinnaman even though the recipe doesn't call for it. Buttermilk kept it moist. Great foundation but definitely season to taste.

Easy quick recipe. I didn't have buttermilk so I substituted yogurt. it came out ok. I will try buttermilk next time. i will also use less sugar. It was a little too sweet for me. Other than that it was good. I will make it again.

I'd never eaten or made sweet potato pie before, and was looking for a different way to use up some surplus sweet potatoes. What a great recipe! Just sweet enough, and the perfect consistency. I loved it. I did add one half teaspoon of cinnamon, which didn't overpower the sweet potato flavor at all. Tastes best after it's been cooled to room temp or slightly chillier, and settled for a day. Will definitely make this again.

I made it exactly as the recipe called for except I just added all ingredients, one by one, to the mixer.  Whisked in the mixer until most of the lumps of potatoes were gone.  Cook time was exactly as recipe stated - and I can't wait to find out how it tastes!  Seems a keeper!!!  :)

Wonderful recipe.  Followed it but added about a teaspoon of lemon juice.  Will surely make it again for Christmas.

I mistakenly left the butter out of the recipe.  Once the pies were in the oven,  I realized that I forgot to add the softened butter. The pie tasted and looked GREAT, as if  nothing  was  missing! Easy way to save on calories, and not sacrifice taste or consistancy!

This pie was part of my Thanksgiving meal and it was DELICIOUS!!  I had a slice for breakfast on the day after. I added all ingredients as noted and added the cinnamon and nutmeg to my taste buds and it was fabulous!

Followed the recipe exactly and really no taste. Needs some type of spice for flavor. Very disappointed as the reviews state otherwise. Will try another sweet potato pie recipe as this truly lacks flavor.

The husband is a major pumpkin pie fan, but once he got a taste of this his loyalties turned. I went all out using organic sweet potatoes and Irish butter. I used cinnamon, vanilla, and a tablespoon of grated fresh ginger. It didn't need the 70 minutes. I bake in a convection oven. I pulled it at 63. It was perfect.

This recipe is wonderful. It is easy to make and delicious! I used this recipe to make my very first sweet potato pie and it was fantastic. My husband, my kids, and my husband's friends all loved it.

i made this recipe for thanksgiving to try something different.  i have another recipe that i'd used for years that was good.  it was sooooo good.  i did add 1 t. of pumpkin pie spice as others suggested.  it was the perfect amount of spice.  i also roasted my sweet potatoes, as another had suggested.  it was so creamy and smooth.  i was really excited.  my family has asked me to make it again for christmas.  :-)
