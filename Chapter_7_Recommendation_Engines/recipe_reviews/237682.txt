Why would a person that cooked a chicken in a pressure cooker comment  on a slow cooker recipe . ??  I touched a nettle  plant  once and  got huge pain on my  arm and  the crackpot recipe might of made it feel  better If i had known about it ..?? but putting my  arm into  the hot pressure cooker would  not of helped my nettle  rash .. hope i did not say anything not politically correct about brainless idiots .

4/9/2016A three ingredient recipe that you dump in a pot and come back to find it magically transformed into a five-star delicious meal? Too good to be true? Nope, this is it! This is as delicious as it is easy. Thank you for the recipe. Update!! 3/31/18 Made this with salsa verde. It’s excellent either way.

I do this with chicken breast. And found deli salsa to work amazingly well. Although I bet this version is good too, I don't like to deal with the bones. I skip the onion, cook a few hours and shred. I freeze in portions to use in tacos, enchiladas, burritos, nachos... Whatever. The juice makes a great base for chicken tortilla soup! I should mention I really don't like to cook chicken in the crock pot. This is the only chicken dish I do.

Edited to add:    And two years later, I'm still making this!!   Still a family favorite!

This is delicious and so versatile!
I used a whole bag of thawed, skinless chicken breasts, instead of whole chicken, since I don't like messing with the skin and bones.  Cooked for about 3-1/2 hrs on high in the slow-cooker.  I used mild picante but easy to spice up with a hotter variety.

Wonderful served with rice, plain, Spanish or Mexican.  This makes lots of juice to spoon over the rice.

With just two of us at home, there was enough for lunches, and still have plenty left to shred for Easy Chicken Fajita Soup, adding the excess juice as a base for the soup broth!  

My head is spinning from all of the possibilities for this!  It will become a staple to use in my freezer make-ahead meals.

GOOD VERY EASY. Often  I don't look at these easier recipes because it is to easy and a jar.  All recipes have a place though.
I should not just pass it by. Perfect for a fall day when raking leaves and still need dinner. Perfect for a grandchildren day but also busy.  It was simple but very good with some mashed potato. It's worth the onion, and I would also try the black beans.. I will make this again.

The only thing I did differently was add a can of black beans and a sliced roma tomato. It didn't change the expected flavor. I put it on low for about 8 hours...OH MY!! I loved it and my 12 year old son said it was really good. There's lots of leftovers for soup or fajitas.

This was the easiest dinner to make, and it was the best tasting chicken I've had. It does have a sweet flavor, but I did not mind it at all. The flavor was the perfect combination of sweet mixed with savory. By far my favorite recipe I've found on here. You won't be disappointed!

Made just as directed and it was delicious! I put it together in less than 10 minutes before I left for work. Highly recommended for a super easy meal that lasted 2nights for my family of 4. Gotta love that!

I lightly added salt and pepper to 8 pieces (legs and thighs), refrigerated overnight and used medium restaurant style salsa (16 oz.).  Cooked on high for 3 hours and put under the broiler on a sheet pan for some color.   This was ok, and it's something I can do when I'm in a pinch for a quick meal or to pair with leftover Mexican rice but I'll certainly salt a bit more and maybe add to it for more flavor ...possibly a can of diced tomatoes with green chilies or with garlic & onion.

This is so yummy!  My family makes and sells a delicious salsa, so I've made this often. I use boneless, skinless chicken thighs. After the chicken is done, I shred it, stir in some rice, and top it with cheese, then continue to cook until the rice is cooked. I've also stirred in black beans and/or corn.

Making it with 3 bone-in skin-on chicken breasts (about 3.5 lb ), the onion, and a 16 oz jar of mild thick and chunky salsa. Put it in the crock pot on low for 8 hours. Easy 3-ingredient recipe. Will make again.

So easy and fast to prepare and absolutely delicious For the busy family, could even prepare in crock night before, refrigerate and put in slow cooker before heading out door. Added celery, but next time I will add garlic and carrots. Would even experiment with different sauce bases....diluted soups etc. Didn't use in "pulled" style but would be simple and fast to do as so tender and moist. I served in chunks as they came off the bird. Would even do it in summer for quick and easy meal that could be served cold for salads etc.

I made this recipe in the pressure cooker. It was nice and juicy however, the flavor was not all that great. I think because I had to add water maybe? 
I will try it again one time, but definitely in the slow cooker!

This recipe is awesome especially for busy parents because it is extremely easy AND delicious!  Along with the onions, I used 6 Foster Farms boneless chicken breasts with half a jar of Costco's Organic Jack's Cantina Style Salsa and cooked in Crock Pot on high for 6 hours.  The chicken was pull apart soft and ready when I came home after a busy day.  I quickly made a pot of Basmati rice and fresh asparagus to pair.  The entire family LOVED it!

This recipe is so easy and delicious.  I always have a couple of opened jars of medium salsa in the fridge that need to be used up and this dish is perfect for that.  The onion rings carmeled up nicely, adding  to the finished meal.  The only thing that I have done diffently is to use skinned leg quarters or I cut up and skinned a whole chicken instead of cooking it whole as directed.  I also add a teaspoon of salt if the salsa isn't salty enough.  By skinning the chicken before cooking, the sauce isn't too fatty to use as is, but, if I'm in a rush, in it goes, skin and all.  Thanks for sharing this winner.

I made it in the oven in a covered casserole dish. It  tasted just as good. I appreciated how easy it was. The second time I made this I sauteed the onions first in a mixture of mayonaise and maple syrup (just a couple of dollops for each) until they were slightly cooked then I added them on top of cooked rice from the night before and put lightly browned chicken breast on top. After that I put on the salsa evenly. The contrast of sweet onion and salsa was very tasty!

Although I used skinless boneless chicken breast, this was terrific! I wish I had made extra just to have as leftovers. Aded salsa Verde and black olives, topped with shredded cheddar cheese and fresh cilantro.

Very good; made as directed, served with rice and simple salad.

One reviewer mentioned assembling the night before.  From experience, I wouldn’t assemble raw chicken with anything and let it sit overnight before cooking.

Wasn't bad.  Chicken comes out tender and juicy but not much flavor.

I made this for the first time this past week and my husband loved it! It is so easy and I used my crock pot. Put it in for 5 hours and it was so tender! This one goes on the keeper pile!

Was a little too bland, I think, because I used a mild salsa.  Really needed more flavor.

The idea behind this is great but you really do have to use your imagination. I gave it 3 stars as written because for our tastes it's to bland. One thing I learned a long time ago is to put your salsa through a strainer and save the liquid if you need more liquid, chicken always gives off a lot of juice. I added minced garlic, chopped serranos and a home made blend of Mexican spices that you might call taco seasoning, I never buy the store bought kind. Also added 1 square off of a 90% cocoa dark chocolate bar(about a quarter of the bar). After it was done I added half a bunch of chopped cilantro leaves. We had it with Mexican rice and refried beans.

For what it was intended to be .... fast, easy, moist, flavorful ... it was perfect. Nothing fancy, just good and easy. I had an 8 lb. chicken so used a bit more salsa and had a large  a purple onion on hand. Made plenty! I used the chicken in tacos, salads, and solo with rice for lunch.

I’ve made this for years with boneless breasts. Love that you can vary  it by the type of salsa you choose. Delicious and different with peach salsa. I’ve never made it with a whole chicken. Probably delicious but, for me, a large part of using a crock pot is to keep it simple. You can’t go wrong with this recipe.

This is the best recipe I've tried in a long time and it's so easy peasy.  It's basically a no fail recipe.   Two thumbs up.

One note, the salsa looses some "heat" while cooking.   So I would recommend you go up one notch from your preferred salsa.  For instance, if you prefer mild salsa, use medium salsa with this recipe and it will taste like mild salsa.   Same if you prefer medium salsa, then use hot salsa for this recipe.

I tweaked it by making quick and easy Mexican Rice.  When finished, put the chicken in a covered glass casserole and keep it warm in the oven.   In the meantime, skim the grease off of the liquid produced while chicken is cooking.   The liquid will have some solids in it.   Using a ratio of 2 1/2 cups liquid to 1 cup rice,  make as much rice as you need.   If you don't have enough liquid, make up the difference with water.  Place liquid in a sauce pan big enough to cook the rice.    Put the onions from the slow cooker  into the pan with liquid.  Bring to a boil.   Add rice, and 1 can of corn niblets and 1 small package of frozen sweet peas.  Cook until rice is done.  If there is liquid left over, heat it and use it to pour over rice and chicken when serving.  Garnish with fresh chipotle.

Excellent! 3 Ingredients, dump in the crock pot and walk away. Come back 4 hours later and find a meal that tastes like you labored over the stove for hours! I used bone in chicken thighs and Pace picante sauce. Served over rice. Loved it! Thanks for the recipe.

Easy, easy, easy.  Used six boneless thighs and cooked for 5 hours.  The chicken was good--used homemade salsa.  Served with rice.  Adding cheese on top of chicken once it is plated would be my only suggestion.

Made it with 3 large organic chicken breasts and followed  the recipe and was pleasantly surprised at how good it was. I chunked it up and served it over brown rice with a side of vegetables.  Excellent quick easy dinner and the house smells good. I used Medium Chunky Picante Sauce .

No!  This was boring and bland and dull - and I added extra seasonings and herbs!!  

I rubbed the chicken down with butter, added salt and pepper and garlic powder. I stuffed the interior with garlic, onions, Rosemary and some lemon.

Maybe I am just done with chicken but 7 hours later, I got a very tender chicken that fell off the bone but - flavorful, it was not. Memorable, it was not.  This is boring, slightly dry.  I'm not even sure if I will eat my leftovers.

I was very disappointed and this is not something that I will make again.

It’s dumb how simple and delicious this is. I’ve made a few time, and I prefer longer time on low than 6 hours on high, but regardless it’s quite good. I skip the onions as well, for no particular reason. Serve in tacos, serve over rice, this dish works every time.

I made this recipe which calls for too much salsa resulting in a watery chicken. The flavor was fine, but needs more spices. I won’t make this recipe again.

I took the meat off the bone and shredded it.  I also added chopped fresh cilantro.  We loved it.

Very easy and juicy, but I found it a little bit bland. Worth another go with different salsa and seasonings.

This is quite tasty.  We make it a little differently by using frozen chicken breasts or thighs instead of the whole chicken and cooking on low for six to eight hours (you can also add a can of black beans or cut up peppers of any color). Shred with two forks and serve with shredded cheese over rice or tortillas. Both ways are easy and delicious!

Simply delicious!!  I used 4 skinless, boneless chicken breasts instead and cut the cooking time accordingly. We loved it and will add this to my permanent recipe collection.

OMG! This is wonderful! I was skeptical at first, expecting mushy chicken. But it turned out great. I used green salsa. I cannot imagine it being better with red. Using my 10" iron skilet,  I browned one side of boneless, skinless chicken thighs; sauteed the onions; placed the chicken thighs on top of the onions, poured the green salsa over it, covered it and cooked it in the oven on 350 for one hour. Served with rice and black beans. I will certainly serve this for company.  It's that good!

This was awesome and so easy!I used a skinless boneless chicken breast on top of one sliced onion.  Poured over 1/3 jar of medium chunky salsa and a sprinkle of black pepper.  Cooked in my little crockpot for 3 hours on low.  When done i removed breast and sliced it and then returned it to sauce in pot.  I served it on warmed whole wheat rolls with a slice of velveeta cheese on the bottom to melt.  Just excellent and it tasted like a chicken cheese steak! Will def make this again!! Made about 4 sandwiches.

SImple and quite good.  My wife even said she'd eat it again despite not liking chicken skin, or onions.  I actually added zucchini chunks to it, and next time plan on whole mushrooms as well.  Served along with corn it's a filling meal without all the starchy sides.

I made this for my husband and myself tonight.  It was great!  I used thighs ( bone in and with skin).  I let it slowly cook, then served over brown rice with a salad.  My husband doesn't like chicken as a rule.....but he loves this recipe!!   I made as directed...and I love this!

Made it with hot salsa.  It was yummy except the next time I would remove the skin so more of the salsa flavor would be in the chicken.

Very easy. Very tasty. Very tender, to the point of falling off the bone. I served it with a side of Mexican-style corn, but it would be good over rice, too.

I loved this recipe.  It could not be easier.  I did not make changes to the ingredients, but next time I will add a little chili powder or cumin to make it a little spicier—or maybe use “hot” salsa—I had medium on hand.  I wasn’t sure how the onions would contribute to the recipe, but they were soft and so flavorful.  I served this with black beans and rice.

Quick and easy.  I used boneless chicken breasts which turned out well, but did not take as long too cook.  Served it with rice.  I also threw in some Hungarian finger peppers which I liked with it on rice.  
If you don't used a cooked salsa, you will get a lot of water.  I poured that off and cooked it down, then added it back... yum

I loved everything about it. It was easy to make I didn’t have to be in the kitchen all day, it was very tender and it tasted amazing. I used chicken breast instead of a whole chicken, and made fajitas like others suggested.

I never follow a recipe 100%, because everyone has their own tastes but this was a great recipe regarding time cooked and ingredients. My family doesn’t usually like breasts because they’re too dry but I like them because they are healthier. My family enjoyed this meal very much. Chicken was very tasty and very moist. I used the leftovers the next night and made beef chimichangas substituting the beef for the chicken. Another hit!! Thank you.

One of my favorite food in the World is Mexican food,. all i do is study & master how the sauce or salsa assembled together then cook them together in a pot with chicken thigh & legs, i spread jalapeno on top to simmer & just leave it simmer on wide mouth pot not a crack pot,. so tasty with flour tortilla & 4 cheese

This recipe is both delicious and simple!  I made two quick accompanying sides with some black beans and used one of those Knorr's Mexican Rice packs, adding in some frozen peas and carrots at the very end of the cooking time.  This is a lifesaver on busy nights when your kids have a full after-school schedule.  Can't reccomend enough!

I was excited to try this recipe due to its simplicity and rave reviews but must say I was a little underwhelmed. I followed the recipe more or less to a T, the only exception, I cut up the chicken. The meal turned out exactly like you would  think simmered chicken in salsa would taste, nothing special at all.

4/9/18: Love this. Couldn't be easier. For potluck at work I use boneless/skinless breasts. Sprinkle a packet of taco seasoning before the jar of salsa, and fork shred to serve on soft tortilla shells when ready.
4/24/19: Made this last week for family yard clean up day. Used RoTel instead of salsa in the cooker, set up a little fixin's bar with hard and soft shells, and had a couple different salsas to choose from.  Best thing?? Mixed the leftover shredded chicken with a little taco sauce and mayo and took to work with croissant rolls and lettuce for my work team. Unbelievable!  Again, so easy but can be tweaked for personal heat but still good as is.

I make this often as is, but a good variation is to add some curry powder to the salsa, a bit of chicken stock as well, and add some currants - delicious - also some chunks of green pepper!  Pat K.

I used 4 chicken breasts. Added cumin and cilantro. Cooked on high 2-3 hours, then reduced to low to simmer till dinner time. Yummy! Simply fell apart. Next time, I would add more salsa.

I almost passed this one up, as it seemed TOO simple and I didn't like the idea of a jar of salsa, but I decided to try it and added fresh corn off the cob and 2 dried chili peppers and had it over wild rice-we like spicy!  This is one of the best meals ever-I would even make it for company without the extra spice.
I would also add green peppers cut up. Thank you, thank you!

I did this just like it says. It only took 4 hours... I could've stopped earlier I think. The meat fell off the bone which was great. A lot of liquid in the pot. I didn't like the taste.

I did no alterations to this recipe and followed it to the letter.  It was awful.  The chicken turned out very dry and was essentially boiled for 4-5 hours which was the main reason for the dryness.  I ended up having to shred it and throw it into other soups to salvage it.  This is not a good stand alone recipe.

I used boneless chicken breasts and added a minced garlic clove to the onion layer. And because I like to "shop the pantry" before buying ingredients, I used one 10-ounce can of diced tomatoes with green chilies plus another 10-ounce can of Ro-Tel diced tomatoes and green chiles. Turned out great but wow! Was it spicy!! Prime suspect: the Ro-Tel tomatoes. When I make this again, I'll add sliced black olives for extra color and another layer of flavor.

This was so quick and easy! And very yummy! I used boneless chicken thighs because it's what I had thawed out and I dumped in salsa without measuring and added a small yellow onion. Cooked it on high for 5 hours. This easily could be served as tortilla soup with some added black beans, corn and rice. The chicken easily fell apart and was so juicy! Highly recommend!

I probably should give it  5 stars, since I haven't made it yet, but I know it will be good. I will be using skinless, boneless chicken thighs, and I will make it tomorrow since I have to be gone most of the day. I am really looking forward to it!

So easy and surprisingly good!  I added green and red peppers with the onions, added a bit of cooked chorizo on top.  Added chicken breasts and the salsa,  and later added some canned corn.  Wow!  Couldn't believe how good!

It was so easy to make, and we had a cooked, moist chicken.  However, no one really like the flavor. Salsa, onions and chicken is just not a hit in my family.

Made it with Mild salsa and used chicken breasts rather than the whole chicken. Excellent.
