Used turkey bacon and egg whites. Thought this needed more seasonings. Baked this in the oven the whole time. REALLY puffed up a lot.. a souffle frittata... nice

Excellent idea and tasted good.  Good for you, too.  I did add different colored sweet peppers with the scallions.

Yummy and easy to throw together. Really flexible too. I called it my "leftover frittata" because I had leftover rice (about a cup and a half) and I also added some leftover boiled potatoes. I used peas instead of edamame, turkey bacon, and also added a fair amount of shredded cheese to the egg and sour cream mix. I was so impressed with how it came out, beautiful and full and puffy and everyone cleaned their plates, no complaints about the peas! I think the potatoes added a really good flavor. I had to cook it for about 16 minutes in the oven because it was quite thick. I did make quite a few changes to the recipe but it's only because I was trying to use up what was in my kitchen. I think the original recipe is a great basic recipe and you can add in whatever you have on hand.

I made this for Saturday morning breakfast because it called for everything I had.  I used leftover brown rice/quinoa and only 5 eggs, and half the sour cream.  Split this into three very good sized ramekins and it made for a satisfying breakfast.  Will make this again and again.
