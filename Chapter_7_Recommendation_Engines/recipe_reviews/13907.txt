My quest for oven fries has ended with this recipe! The "ah-ha" came to me when I read about the sugar making them crisp.  That is the key! These came out incredibly crispy and tasty!  I *did* make a couple of changes (after making them the way the recipe was posted once).  I actually omitted the cayenne.  We love spicy..but not necessarily in fries.  I used 1-1/2 tsps. of salt (that did the trick as far as taste goes) and I used olive oil instead of veggie oil.  These are the best oven fries I've ever made!

These were pretty good. After seeing other reviews mentioning burning, I set my oven at 425 instead of 450. Used olive oil instead of veg. oil and added a bit more cayenne & some garlic salt. Pretty tasty. Thanks for the recipe!

Delish!  I actually made these with sweet potatos for extra health and they were great!  I added way more cayenne though because you could barely taste the amount the recipe called for.  They weren't too spicy even with more cayenne.

Updated to add: I tried these last night with white potatos, and they were not good at all!  Well, not good compared to the sweet potato ones I made before.  They were boring, whereas the cayenne combined with the sweetness of the sweet potato made these fries fantastic!

TRY THEM WITH SWEET POTATOS, YOU'LL LOVE THEM!

I used 1 TBLS of veg oil and added a dash of garlic/onion powders. GREAT FRIES! Had I known they were going to be this sucessful, I would have doubled the batch. Plus, thanks to the foil, easy clean-up! Will make these many times in the future. Thanks so much for the recipe Barbara!

Yummy!  These turned out really good.  I added some garlic powder, onion powder and black pepper to the potatoes and sprinkled some parmesan cheese on them when they came out of the oven.  I used a bit more oil than called for because I wanted to make sure the wedges were well coated.  Great with ketchup.  Thanks for sharing.

The easiest and best we've ever had.  Tasted like steak fries from a restaurant.  I did score the potatoes with a fork after cutting them, it makes the spice stick better, and give it the restaurant appearance.

So, so delicious.  I followed some of the suggestions - 425 oven instead of 450 & parchment over the foil.  I also just sprinkled the potatoes with olive oil, then salt, pepper & sugar, then made sure they were coated using a small plastic bag over my hand.  Baked for 30 min., turned them and then baked another ten minutes at 375.  This is definitely a keeper and one that I will make again and again.  It is now two hours since dinner and my husband is still raving about them.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

This one has become my family's favourite. I'm finally reviewing it after making it about two dozen times! We sub paprika for red pepper flakes, works out just as good. These are flavourful and delicious. I bake them on an airbake style pan which makes them easier to flip and no charring. Great with some ketchup and mayo on the side!

These are great! It took my fries a bit longer than 30 minutes to crisp up, but the flavour was excellent! I've been looking for a good oven fries recipe for quite some time, and this is it! We had them with turkey burgers! No guilt at all on our burger-and-fries night!

Just re-made this recipe tonight...I ran out of cayenne, so I mixed some thai chili sauce into the oil and sugar. So spicy and delicious! I just wanted to add to my previous review

Mine began to burn on the bottoms before I had a chance to flip them at the half way point.  Next time I will probably lower the oven temp or turn them earlier, otherwise they were really good tasting and easy to make.  My 3 year old loved them...so did her dad.

I substituted sweet potatos instead of white and I loved it, but my kids were less enthusiastic.

For those members who complained about the potatoes sticking to the baking sheet I have a suggestion - line your baking sheet with Reynold's Wrap "non-stick" foil!!!  It is a fantastic product and worked perfectly, plus there was no clean up necessary - just fold up the foil and you're done!!  I used four potatoes, increased the oil to one-half tablespoon and used seasoned pepper instead of cayenne - but 30 minutes at 450 was right on.  Oh, and instead of tossing the potatoes, oil and seasoning in a bowl, I use a ziploc bag.  Again, no fuss, no muss.

This was my first attempt at "oven" french fries.  I'm loathe to deep fat fry anything, but love the flavor of french fries, so decided to try an oven version.  I have to say these were very good!  I used a special "french fry" potato cutter.  This was easier than I expected.  The coating was just right for one potato.  I used parchment paper instead of foil--this elimates all the "stuck to the pan" issues, and doesn't require extra oil or Pam.  I baked them at 450 and turned half way.  They were good!  A couple of singed spots, but not to the point they were ruined.  They are certainly not as crisp as deep fat fried, but then again, you save about a billion calories, and still have the great flavor of french fries with your steak or burger or whatever.  It's a keeper.  P.S.  I would cut down on the cayenne.  Maybe because I used just one potato, but the "kick" was a bit much for our palettes.  Next time we will try the garlic salt, as recommended by other reviewers.  Don't forget--use parchment paper instead of foil.  No sticking!  Maplegirl2005

The sugar is a great idea! Another tip is to put the baking sheet with oil on it in the oven to get hot before you put the potatoes on it.

very good, sugar seems to be the new twist.  In re: the confusion about red pepper, please note that red pepper flakes are not the same as cayenne pepper.  Cayenne is a find ground red powder.  I can understand if one confused the two that red pepper flakes would not be good in this recipe.

Best oven fries recipe we've tried. Had a little burn-on-the-bottom, might turn it down to 425 degrees next time. Used paprika instead of cayenne, which we were out of. One of the few dishes everyone has loved!

The only thing I did differently was add garlic and basil. Everything else I kept the same. This was excellent. Thank your for the recipe.

Amazing! I'm never buying frozen fries again! These were outstanding. When I was preparing this recipe I thought there was  no way that the small amount of coating ingredients would be able to cover all of the potatoes well enough, but it all did! My husband, who LOVES the frozen bagged fries told me that he liked these way better than the storebought kind. This recipe is a definite keeper that I will be making time and time again!

These are incredibly yummy, but I think next time I'm going to rub vegetable oil over the foil instead of using spray so the spray doesn't get burnt.

Pretty good, and it certainly is simple.  The fries weren't very crisp but I didn't really expect that out of the oven.  To avoid sticking I just used a silicon liner in my baking sheet.  Also added some garlic powder.

These turned out very good.  I used olive oil, which I hand-rubbed onto the sliced sliced potatoes.  Then sprinkled seasonings over both sides of fries and rubbed in a bit, adding quite a bit more cayenne and some salt-free Greek Seasoning, as had used sea salt with the other spices.  I have done oven fries many times before, always spraying the pan with Pam, placing the potatoes on, sprinkling them with spices, then spraying the potatoes with Pam and cooking at 425.  The olive oil works better, I think, or maybe the difference is the sugar (I just sprinkled that over the fries and probably used quite a bit less than a tablespoon), but should have Pam-ed the pan, as they stuck quite a bit when done.  They tasted great, tho, and that is what we cook for!  Thanks for sharing.

As others have mentioned, you can add variety and extra flavor by mixing in sweet potatoes: http://imunchie.com/bobjgourmet/munchies/home-fries-baked

Olive oil instead of vegetable. Paprika instead of cayenne - and a good healthy amount. Optionally, rosemary. Also, substitute sweet potatoes for an alternative or throw in peeled pieces of carrots with the regular potatoes to try and get a few more vitamins in the mouths of those kids. So many variations!

These were so delicious!! They aren't sweet, but the sugar makes them crispy. My only issue was that they stuck to the pan, but they were great anyway.

I really enjoyed this recipe.  I have made it many times following the recipe exactly and it is great as is.  Last night I made it to go with Maxwell St. style polish sausage sandwiches and I tweaked the recipe a bit and I actually enjoyed it more than before.  I used 2 sweet potatoes, 4 russet potatoes, 2 teaspoons of olive oil, a good sprinkle of Lawry's seasoning salt, 1 tablespoon of white sugar, a nice sprinkle of cayenne pepper, put them on a cookie sheet coated with canola cooking spray, baked them at 450 for about 20 minutes, flipped them and baked them another 20 minutes, when I took them out to flip them I sprinkled them with kosher salt.  They were delicious!  I actually enjoyed the sweet potato fries more than I did the russet potatoes and so did my kids who usually don't like sweet potato fries.  Yum!  Thank you for a wonderful recipe that can be used as is or modified to your individual tastes.

These didn't come out like I expected.  They weren't crispy.  Instead, they were burned on the bottom and soggy on top.  :(   I don't think I'll be trying this again.

These are so delicious and easy!  I used olive oil and dropped the temp to 425.  I made them last week and my husband is asking for them again.  Thanks for the recipe!

Absolutely amazing!!  So delicious!!  I WILL be  serving these again.  I adjusted and added seasonings to our taste, and flipped them at half time.  I also followed another's advice and reduced the temp to 425, but I think my oven is a little hot.  Do yourself a favor and try these! YUM!!

This is such a quick and easy way to make fries.  I was worried they would taste sweet, but they didn't.  Mine never crisped up, but the flavor was really good.  I had no problems with them sticking to the pan.  I'll definitely make these again!

Great recipe. First, I boiled the cut potatoes until a fork could pierce easily. Then I toss them with the ingredients and baked at 450 degrees for about 15 - 20 minutes or until crispy. Thanks for sharing Barbara.

I was dissapointed with these potatoes given the reviews I read. The potatoes stuck to the pan, and the sugar just made them taste sweet. It was a disaster. Maybe it was my technique,  it sure was a waste of time.  Sorry.

I added a dash or two of onion and garlic powder based on other reviews.  I loved these fries!  Even my husband, who is hard to impress, enjoyed them.

Easy and quick! I have a baking rack that I put the fries on and place a pan on the rack below, they crisp up faster and you don't have to worry about turning them. Being a Marylander I of course am obliged to add Old Bay for additional flavor..

Good recipe. I'd definitely reduce the amount of sugar, as it turned out a bit too sweet for my tastes. I put about 2 pinches of cayenne in the batch I made, which was a nice, mellow bit of heat. Next time I make them, I think I'm going to add a sprinkle each of garlic and onion powder, as well as a dash of black pepper to the potatoes, as they were a little bland as-is.

Such a simple recipe with so many good reviews, but it didn't work for me - not the results I was hoping for. I followed the ingredients and prep, but I think I may have messed up by not turning them over half way through cooking. Mine were not done at 30 minutes, so I cooked them another 10 minutes, which was way too long. They were pretty burnt, but yet didn't feel done with a toothpick. Then I steamed them for 2 minutes in the microwave, cut off the burnt ends & edges, but they just weren't what I thought they would be - But I admit that I should have turned them during cokking, so I'll give 3 stars...just won't be trying this recipe again.

Very good, I've made this a couple times now and they come out perfect. Well, when I remembered to bake them on top rack (one time on bottom rack got burnt slightly).

I have been making oven fries for years, and they are never predictable.  This helps with having the pan lined with foil.  And the 425" oven does too. Yummy!  And healthy!

This was very good.The trick to keep them from sticking to the pan is not only oil the pan, but place the potatoes skin side down.That way they did not stick at all.I left them in the oven an extra 10 minutes to brown them a little more.I was worried they would be sweet with the sugar but they weren't.I made these with "Thats a Meatloaf" a recipe from this site.I will definitley make this again.

Great tasting fries, but I only ate half of them - the rest were quite burnt.

lowered the temp to 350 and flip them every 10 minutes or so until evenly browned.

I had a ton of potatoes, so I made these. Delicious! I like to add 1 tsp of mild curry powder and 1 tsp of garlic powder. Add a tsp or so of your favorite seasonings and experiment! Also, putting all the ingredients in a bowl with a cover or in a large Ziploc and giving them a good couple of shakes works well. Just be careful to drain away any liquid. At 450, I was getting some burned fries. So I reduced the temperature to 375 and baked the fries for an additional 10 minutes. They turned out fine. Maybe not as crispy, but I like them that way.

This is a great recipe because it is versatile I added a few spices (we added garlic, crushed rosemary) and 
turned out great!  My sister made it per the recipe and her family loved them.  The sugar is must for crunch and we used 1 Tbs of oil.

I forgot to soak, so I turned them half-way through cooking. These are good. I didn't use as much sugar. The sugar is what makes them brown up and get crispy. Great recipe, thanks!

I thought these were very good.  I left out the red pepper because my stepson doesn't like it.  I left my oven at 450 and flipped the fries after 15 minutes and they turned out fine--didn't burn or stick.  Great recipe!

This will be my go-to fry recipe from now on.  I did use olive oil instead of vegetable oil, and baked for a total of 45 minutes at 450 because my husband likes the fries nice and brown.  I sprayed the cookie sheet before spreading the fries to reduce sticking, and had no problems.  I turned them after 15 minutes and again after 30 minutes.  This recipe could have so many variations.  As others have suggested, I will try sprinkling them with Parmesan cheese after baking, or using onions or garlic or other seasoning to spice it up a bit.  Thanks for a keeper recipe.

We have made these a couple of times and are just about ready to replace the frozen fries with this version.  A silicone liner is a good option for the sticking issues.  These are also terrific (if you have any leftover), cut them up with your eggs the next morning!

I don't know how I messed these up so badly.  I could not get them crisp.  I even weighed the potatoes!  I think there were too many potatoes on the cookie sheet.  My hubby said they had great flavor, more like roasted potatoes...just not french fries if that is what I was going for.  He ate plenty of them and if he doesn't like something he just doesn't eat it so there was that.

Turned out delish - used olive oil, garlic salt, sugar, and pepper and turned down the heat to 425.

I have made these several times and we absolutely love them. They were a huge hit at a barbecue birthday party too! The only things I do differently is instead of cayenne pepper, I sprinkle them liberally with season salt once they are on the pan, I use sea salt instead of regular salt, and olive oil instead of vegetable. I've also tried them with sweet potatoes and extra cayenne pepper, and they turned out awesome too. I have the most luck baking these on the bottom oven rack, and definitely use lots of cooking spray! thanks so much for this recipe, it's a definite go-to recipe for us!

Fantastic!!  My kids loved the "Homemade French Fries"!  Instead of cayenne pepper (they don't do spicy), I used rosemary.  Next time I'll try another herb.

Very very good!  Was skeptical about the sugar... but you would never know there's sugar added, and the fries tasted like deep-fried fries.  My guests loved them!
This is my new fry recipe!
Thanks for the recipe!

I was highly impressed. I really think the sugar is key to the flavor *and* crispness. And the cayenne (I added a little more than a pinch) added the perfect kick. I added sweet potato to the regular potato and could have eaten the whole batch. Really good.

I don't know what I did wrong, but these did not crisp up at all! They still tasted delicious, but were just soft. I turned down the heat to 425 as one reviewer said, but the bottom still was a little burnt. Also, I think you should turn them halfway through cooking (which I didn't, but I think would have helped).

I used sugar, salt, pepper and Cajun seasoning and it turned out really good. I will for sure make again. I did have a few fries stick to the pan but that was because those were the ones that didnt have enough oil on them. I suggest adding more oil to the bottom of the pan instead of that spray oil and just when you think you have added enough, add a little more. Oil / butter makes everything better :)

Very good, easy recipe. A couple of minor changes I made were to omit the sugar (as I'm trying to make healthy choices), and to sprinkle fries with dried rosemary - gives the taters a very herbal, yummy taste:)

These  are awesome!  Just the right amount of spice with the cayenne.  I used more oil, just eye-balled it in the bowl, and baking time was more than 30 minutes for sure.  After 30 mins I turned them, then continued baking for another 20, and they were perfect.

These were very good and had a terrific flavor, but I'm still a little disappointed in the crispiness. Some things I guess can only come from scalding hot oil!

NOTE TO ALL - Don't forget to coat pans with oil!!!! Don't skip the oil.  I read someone's review that blasted this recipe for not telling you to oil the pan.  And I said, "Huh - what a fool, it says it right there 'coat pan with vegetable oil'"  I set my husband up with the recipe.  Guess what - no oil.  He missed that part.  Skipped right over it.  The fries stuck to the pan and were over cooked and under cooked and were STILL good.

These are awesome, but I make two small alterations.  I need 1 TBSP of oil to coat the potatoes and I substitute paprika (about 1/2 tsp) for the cayenne-- they come out great every time.

These were good, but I added LOTS more spice. I used some season salt, a little rosemary, garlic powder, and a little sweet basil. All in all, they were tasty. In my opinion, they wouldn't have been nearly as good without the spices though.

These were okay, and easy and certainly healthy.  The sugar does help them crisp up.  They weren't great though.  They were rather tasteless, like roast potatoes with  no seasoning.  I even used season salt rather than plain.  I did however find soaking the potatoes for five minutes as another review suggested did prevent sticking.  I will continue with my attempts to get great oven fries by adding more seasonings in the future.

These are to die for. I added garlic powder, onion powder, all seasoning salt and BBQ spice .. Tripled the amount of spices that the recipe called for. I put my oven on 425, put the fries in and then turned it down to 375 to prevent burning. Tip: to keep the fries from sticking to the bottom of the pan, let them soak in cold water for 5 minutes and then pat them dry before adding the oil and spices

Great flavor, although mine didn't get very crispy. Maybe they needed more time. They were cooked through but not golden. I'll let them go a little longer next time, and was I supposed to turn them? I'll turn them next time, too.

This is my new go-to recipe. we love them with burgers! my 7 year old son likes them better than fast food fries. I usually season with whatever we feel like, and have also followed the recipe exactly. thanks for the great recipe!

These are great!! Creamy inside...baked at 450 for 30 min and turned at 15 min...halfway thru. Did not use cayenne and only used a pinch of sugar.  Also used parchment paper instead of foil and sprayed it with pam. Really good...will make again...who needs a deep fryer? These are excellent!!!

Outstanding.  I won't buy frozen fries again.  I used olive oil instead of veggie oil, and garlic salt instead of regular salt. (I put some kind of garlic in almost everything.)  Turn halfway through, even if they look burnt when done still soft on the inside.

these were amazing. the only thing I'll do next time is flip them halfway. I ended up putting them under the broiler a few mins to crisp up the underside. thank you!

We liked them. I cut the recipe back to two servings and should have read the recipe more carefully as I peeled the potatoes before I realized that I wasn't supposed to. After cutting the potatoes I let them soak for a good 10 minutes before cooking, this removes some of the surface starch and allows the potatoes to crisp. A hint for those that are having issues with them burning...place your cooking sheet in the upper part of the oven. A tad sweet for our tastes but still tasty.

I make these all the time, and my only recommended change to the original recipe is to line the baking sheet with parchment paper. Much easier cleanup, and no problems with potatoes sticking to the sheet.

This is really great. temperature, time, everything! I added  just a tish of garlic and onion powders and some paprika. No need to turn midway as one reviewer suggested. Do make sure you really spray the aluminum  foil with pam or some cooking spray even though there is oil coating the potatoes.

I followed the directions exactly, and after 30 minutes they were burned on one side and floppy. I will try again, as I seem to be in the minority with these problems.

I did make the following changes.  I added garlic powder, garlic salt, onion powder,  a little seasoning salt and Mrs dash.  I wanted seasoned fries not plain.  These were delicious!!  We both agreed they were better than fried french fries!  Our new favorite...easy and the sugar must be what makes them crispy...Yum!

I cut my potatoes into planks and used black pepper instead of cayenne--personal taste.  They were great!  I'll try cutting them smaller next time, but this is a keeper, for sure!

Another excellent oven fry recipe. I did add some garlic and onion and just a little less cayenne for the kiddos. The kids enjoyed the addition of the sugar and it made them nice and crispy.

I just tried the recipe tonight.  My husband has never been a fan of oven fries but even he said it was good.  Very simple and since there is just the two of us I halved the recipe.  I wasn't sure about the little bit of oil so I upped it just a tad for the half recipe but probably would have been fine without the extra.  Will definitely be making these again.  Thank you very much for the recipe!

all thumbs up! These were great, but took a lot longer than 30 minutes to bake in my almost-brand-new oven. Almost an hour, and towards the end, I turned it up to 500 to really get it to crisp up. This isn't a recipe error, i'm sure, but oven's really do vary with cooking times!
We used creole/cajun seasoning as well for a little extra kick.

Was okay. Left out the cayenne. Mine were done at 25 mins. Next time would remember to use kosher salt. And don't forget to spray foil.

This recipe is the closest I haved come to crispy fries in the oven, I do think the sugar makes all the difference. I did lower the oven temp to 425, ready in 30 mins. Also very tasty with just a bit of old bay.

These were great! I made them on the grill since it was hot out and they were very tasty and not sugary at all.  Perfect with the hamburgers we grilled out.  Next time I'll use more pepper to season them a bit more.

I used sweet potatoes.  The flavor was good but they did not come out crispy.  Despite my turning them in the oven a few times, they kept burning at that high of a temperature and I had to pull them out early.  They were limp with burned parts.  If I try it again, I'll reduce the temperature.  They burned on the bottom despite being on a lined pan and they burned at the top where the edges were thinner and on the ends.  They only made it through about 20 minutes of cooking before there were charred ends and bottoms.  The sugar coating also started to make them stick to the pan.

Yum.

I have been making oven fries for years but never thought to put the mixture of salt, sugar, cayenne on them pre-baking.

Duh? These taste so much more savory than the old way I did it.

I made these last night for dinner,my husband loved them. They were not crispy, but we did not mind. The thinner you cut them the more crisp you will get. I did line my pan with foil and spray with cooking spray, worked well but did have to turn fries over every 15 min and  I baked at 450 for extra 10 minutes. I did add some onion salt and garlic powder as others suggested will make again!

We loved it! I made it with some lemon pepper, and added some garlic powder and Ms. Dash table blend and it was fantastic! My kids loved them, and we didn't have enough...Guess we will make them again tonight!!!

We had some issues with the fries cooking properly and found them to burn even with cooking them in olive oil.  The sugar made them crispy but as they stuck to the pan we couldn't get them too crispy.  We found they also were not done in 30 mins so we had to cook them a bit longer.

Amazing oven fries.  The sugar helps them brown and makes them nice and crispy.  Mine stuck to the foil, even with the cooking spray, so I would reccommend flipping them every 10 minutes to prevent this. Very tasty recipe though! Thanks for sharing.

We enjoyed these.  I added more salt than called for and sprinkled with a good bit of Hungarian paprika rather than cayenne.  The parchment paper worked great.

These are awesome! Have made them multiple times.  I used black pepper instead of cayenne, because we're not a spicy kind of family, but otherwise I followed the recipe.  The whole family loves them.  I've even layered them with cheddar after cooking to make cheese fries!  Thanks for sharing!

I used too much pepper based on others review. I guess I don't like my fries that spicy. Will make again though.

Yum!! All I did was add extra spices and some sesame seeds at the end. This was quite delicious and will be on the list when we need fries. A hint - don't be afraid to "over season" the fries. I've made these before according to the recipe and they were a tad bland. Thanks!

Had to double the amount of oil, and used a plastic bag to coat everything.  I am going to try this with sweet potato's next. These did crisp up nicely and the flavor was good.
I also lined the pan with parchment paper.

These were good, however I did bake them longer to get a true crisp to them.  Next time I will layer the pan with tin foil, as I forgot to this time and paid the price in scrubbing.  I think the sugar makes them stick much more than usual oven fries I make without the sugar.  However the sugar gives them an amazing flavor.  My husband loved them.  I didn't add as much red pepper, as it seems like that would make really spicy fries.

We've tried several recipes for oven fries but none turned out either crispy or tasty.  This did both!  Parchment paper is key (over the tin foil) in my opinion.    Love 'em!  Thanks for posting this!

Great recipe. I added a few seasonings I knew we would like. Check often... as they seemed to cook faster than I thought after reading some previous comments. (I have a new oven which may have been the cause)?! 1st time I've ever had homemade oven fries that were YUMMY!!!

These turned out pretty good, I halved the recipe and added a little bit of garlic powder and seasoned salt. I did spray the foil but found they did still stick a little and looked burnt...however they did not taste burnt and tasted very much like they came from the deepfryer.  Pretty yummy, and less calories & fat :)  Will definetely make these again!

These are really great! Was looking for an alternative to deep frying potatoes for fish and chips. This really hit the spot! I did the shake and bake in a bag trick, but next time I don't think I'll season that way. I think it would be better to season on the pan so you can control better. I look forward to trying these with other seasonings. My husband suggested old bay and I was thinking tex-mex or even with bacon then dipping in sour cream. YUMMY! Thanks for the great recipes! I'll be using it a lot!

Made these tonight to go with our grilled hamburgers and hotdogs. The sugar adds the right touch. I did use garlic salt on half and cajun seasoning on the other half. Even my picky 2 year old ate some dipped in ketchup! Great alternative to the deep fried version.

These fries are incredible!  The sugar makes perfect sense now that I've had them.  I swapped out a bit more olive oil for the vegetable oil and added chili powder instead of cayenne. I'll definitely make these again and will try all sorts of flavor combos.

I am on a quest to find a recipe for oven fries that we like. Unfortunately, this one isn't it. The fries weren't as crispy as I had hoped. I added some black pepper and garlic salt also, but I still thought the flavor was lacking something. The recipe didn't mention spraying the pan with cooking spray, so I didn't. Big mistake - although my fries weren't burnt, they were completely stuck to the pan. Thanks anyways!

they stuck to my well-sprayed, aluminium foil-lined pan and therefore weren't as "fry" like as i'd hoped.  i'll try them again though, because the reviews are quite agreeable and my deepfryer makes me fat.

i omitted the cayenne pepper and followed the recipe to the letter, and they were outstanding!  next time, though, i will follow another rater's suggestion to make them crisper for my 4 year old son.  he only ate the crisp ones.  i'd also suggest using a non-stick spray because the oil in the recipe wasn't enough to keep the fries from sticking.  i will be making this again - this morning, actually!  thanks for the recipe!

These were GREAT!  My hubby and I loved them!  I was really worried that they would taste too sweet with the sugar, but NOT AT ALL!  It just crisps them up perfectly!  The cayenne adds a nice heat to the fries, but if you don't like that, I would change it up and use a different spice. Although, Salt and Pepper alone would be great too!

I used Tony Chachere's cajun seasoning instead of the cayenne pepper. I also sprayed the foil on my baking sheet with olive oil spray. Although my fries were not "crispy", they still were very tasty!

These came out great!! Because I can't tolerate any oil at all, instead of oil I used Pam spray on the potatoes to make the seasoning stick. We don't like hot, so we cut the cayenne and upped the salt. I also used the non-stick foil in addition to spraying the foil with Pam. I think I might try lowering the temp just a bit next time -- I didn't think they burned but my kids don't like anything darker than light brown! Thanks!

These were wonderful. I had been craving some fries and know how bad the traditional ones are.  I used a roasted garlic oil (had intended to use EVOO - extra virgin olive oil) and added a large clove of pressed garlic and some black pepper.  Will certainly make again!

These were very good,, my husband loved them. I made with olive oil, sugar and seasoned salt. Also, I microwaved the potatoes first to soften them and that cut the cook time down to about 30 minutes.

i made a half recipe of these fries to go with chris' bay area burgers (also on this website). no changes were made aside from turning my potatoes over after 20 minutes of baking so they'd be evenly browned. next time i'll add an extra sprinkle of cayenne because we thought the spice was barely noticeable. thanks barbara!

This was just okay.  I had to use 1 tbs oil instead of a tsp to get it to coat properly.  My husband said to stick to the same thing put use the recipe on the back of the Lawry's Gralic salt with parsley spice mix.

This was excellent. I had to cheat and buy frozen potato wedges but they worked beautifully. You have to use the sugar because it makes all the difference! I think this is my new fav fry recipe!

ok, i'm sure I didn't do something right. They didn't stick (i used to 5 min.soaking in cold water method) and i coated the aluminum foil w/Pam, but the taste was....yucky! Even slathering them in kethup didn't help. There was too much of a sugary taste and they tasted "pastey" If I make again, I'll try something else.Sorry

At first thought not enough mixture for all those cut up potatoes but it turned out to be just right.  My family really loved it and ate it all up.  This one is a definite keeper.

As is, this is a three star recipe. The spices should have been doubled perhaps even tripled for the potatoes to have some spice to them. The potatoes turn a very appealing golden color but the spicy taste is lacking. Next time I'll double the spice mixture.

Quick and Easy recipe! These turned out really good. I did add some garlic powder and seasoning salt because I didn't think the cayenne pepper was enough. Just wish they didn't stick to the pan so badly. I placed them on Pam sprayed foil and they still had a tough time coming off.

I never thought I would love oven fries, but what a difference cayenne makes.  I like to add garlic powder too.  Eat them with real mayo for the best combo.

I used a lot of Mexican Seasoning (I didn't have Cayenne at the time). I would taste them to make sure they are cooked as long as you would like them to be. I cooked longer than directed for my preference.

fast & easy
I omit the sugar & substitute in different seasonings to compliment my main course.
WARNING: Coat your fries well with oil (I use Olive Oil) if you don't want them to accidentally stick to the aluminum foil!

These are the best oven fries I have ever made. The recipe is simple but delivers a very good finished fry. I personally use a bit more cayenne, as I like a bit more kick to the fry. You will never find a better fry in the store, ever. Try them, you'll love them.

These are fine. They cook, but never really get crispy like a deep-fried fry. As long as you expect a soggy fry, they are fine.

Easy recipe and decent result. I threw in a few extra ingredients for flavor - garlic powder, fresh chives, and an extra dash of cayenne. It wasn't spicy at all, I didn't even notice the cayenne. Sadly my fries didn't crisp up at all; next time I'll try baking at 450 as the recipe says instead of 425. I forgot to spray the Al foil,  and they stuck to it a lot!

only reasons I gave this 4 stars was that when you cut up your RUSSET potatoes...you need to soak them in cold water to release a lot of the starch...very important omitted step...and you can cook these at 400º to 425º and not have to worry about burning. Make these all the time to rave comments

Wasn't overly sweet, does stick so parchment or Silpat is highly recommended. I don't know if I would bother with the sugar again. Didn't add much to the party. The cayenne was nice, I used just a tiny pinch over 6 potatoes worth of fries, there is just a tiny bit of heat in the background. Overall they came out fine, but I make fries like these all the time, just without the sugar.

Turned out great! The only issue I had was keeping an eye on them to prevent burning.  I ended up taking them out about 5-7 minutes early.

Best home fries I've ever made, I think the sugar really makes the difference.  I lowered the temp on my convection oven to 415 and they were done in about 20 minutes.

These were great! I followed the directions as is but used olive oil instead of vegetable oil and I lined the oven tray with parchment paper (so no need to turn half way through cooking).
Taste like Potato skins.

I used olive oil instead of veggie oil. Coated them also w/rosemary, tyme and some chipolte seasoning.  I did not add the sugar as we didn't need them extra crispy. We cooked them for 50 min and on 400, flipping them 1/2 way.

I obviously did something wrong. Followed the recipe and some advice from others and they took a long time to crisp. Will try again though to aim for a higher rating.

Pretty good overall. Not a fan of the sugar though, so next time I will omit that. The seasonings were only so-so, I'll play around with them next time. But this recipe is a keeper.

I think would have worked better with out foil. Dipping them in less oil with spices and also oiling sheets. Probably more calories, but these melded to foil and burned in spots. Mine did not turn out like fries very much. Still ate them, but need tweaks in the recipe or try a different one on here.

I was surprised how poorly these turned out given most of the reviews? I don't think I will attempt them again, but if so, I will definitely cut them thicker and leave the skin on.

This is a great base recipe. I make these with olive oil, a teaspoon of fresh minced garlic and a pinch of nutmeg and black pepper. I omit the cayenne since the kids don't like the heat. The sugar is a great addition! I check them every 15 minutes during cooking, and flip halfway through and increase cook time to 40-45 minutes. Enjoy!

my 5-yr-old DS and i loved these. i had problems with them sticking to the cookie sheet, even though i put foil and oil on in. next time i will try to leave them in wedges so that the skin will be touching the hot pan instead. the skin doesn't stick as badly.

I was so disappointed!  I cut the potatoes into 1/2 inch strips, like the recipe said.  But on the picture, the potatoes are definitely wedges.  I followed the rest of the directions exactly and ended up with soft-cooked fries with burnt edges, caked to the foil.  What a waste of time :(

The sugar is the key ingredient.  It didn't make them sweet, but really enhanced the flavor.  The potato was thoroughly cooked, but they didn't come out crispy.  sprayed a bit of oil onto my non-stick cookware and they did not stick.

Baked at 425 so as not to burn per other reviews and this did not make them crispy. Fries did have a good flavor but next time will bake at 450 to see if I get more crispyness. BF loved them!

Yup, as another reviewer said it's the sugar that makes these brown up and crisp, which I've rarely had happen before when making oven fries.  Will use this method from now on, very versatile as well, think I'll do cajun fries next.  Thanks!

I loved these! And so easy. I'm so happy to have this recipe. The only things I changed were the spices (I used Emeril original and garlic powder in place of Cayenne) and I used olive oil instead of vegetable and doubled the amount of oil.

Great recipe! Thanks!

I made these tonight and the flavor wasn't that great and they were more on the chewy side not really crispy. They stuck to the oiled foil. I'm probably not going to make these again.

Made them the other day. They were very good. I first tried them with the cayenne pepper but it was too hot so the next time I made them I skipped the pepper. This is a great dish and I prefer these baked fries rather than fried.

I set my oven to 425 and places the fries skin-side down as others suggested. When I saw that the tips were beginning to turn very dark brown and the surfaces had a browned, 'bubbled' texture. They weren't super crispy, but the taste and texture were delicious anyways. I will probably make these often, I HATE sticking potatoes in huge vats of hot oil, I've done it for years and I never look forward to it.

My first attempt at oven fries and they were perfect. I forgot the sugar though. I did use salt, garlic powder, pepper, and seasoned salt. I cut the wedges and poured olive oil over with the seasoning. I used non-stick foil sprayed with cooking spray. Cooked for exactly 30 mins on 450 with no issues.

I, too, added more oil than 1 teaspoon.  It did not seem like enough for the amount of potatoes.  Other than that, they came out as stated: crispy on the outside and full of potato on the inside.  4/5 people in my house liked them!

I have no clue what went wrong but these came out limp and greasy and stuck terribly to the greased foil.  I cooked them about 7 extra minutes to try to get them to "crisp up" but with no luck.  My sons (4 & 6 years) each had a taste and said they hated them.  
My quest goes on........

Everybody in my family loved these fries!  I used a little more oil than the recipe called for and seasoned salt instead of cayenne pepper, but it turned out great.

Pretty good.  I found that you need to cook them longer but that may just be my personal preference.

These were pretty tasty...had to bake them for longer than the recipe indicates, though.

Mine didn't get crispy, but they tasted good.  The sugar didn't make it sweet at all.

These were QUICK and an easy side dish or appetizer for drop in guests.  I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil.  Next time I will add some minced garlic for a little more taste.  SO quick and easy!

I really liked that these fries weren't greasy. I'm not crazy about overly seasoned fries, so this seems like a good amount of seasoning for me. I will most likely make this again.

I don't know what went wrong, but my fries never crisped up, they were just an oily mess that stuck to the pan.  It was a big disappointment considering the time it took to wait for them.

Somehow I think there is a mistake. I would use 1 tablespoon oil and 1 teaspon sugar. I often make something like this by brushing either oil or butter on the potates and baking them at 450F. I will certainly try a little sugar the next time I make oven fries.

Not as much flavor as I expected, but it was definitely good. My wife loved them and suggested that I make them again.

I didn't really care for these. They didn't turn out the way I wanted from baked fries.
