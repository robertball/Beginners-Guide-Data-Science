This is a wonderful refreshing drink.  Instead of fresh mango, we used canned mango slices.  This avoid the challenge of finding fresh mangos, allowing time for them to ripen and then going through the fun of peeling and slicing the fruit.

This is a light and refreshing drink which makes a summer night into paradise (especially with a special some one). Mango made it sweet, and it was light (almost to light- I could keep drinking them). I LOVE IT!!

Smooth and sweet...yummy!  A little more rum than the recipe calls for is great, but not necessary.

This tasted good but was really frothy.  I made it for Bunco night and used coconut milk, because I had it on hand. I am sure that added to the frothiness.  I will try again with the pina coloda mix and see if that is better. I was told it tasted very good, just too thick to have a second.

The drink was very strong.  In addition to decreasing the rum, I'd really cut back on the pina colada mix as well.

This is a definitely a nice drink for sitting out on the patio.  I agree with some of the reviews in that it is a very thick, frothy drink.  I used frozen mango because I couldn't find canned and then I cut back on the ice.

I took out the rum and used coconut milk in place of the pina colada mix. IT WAS THE BEST!!!!!
