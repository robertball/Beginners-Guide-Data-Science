These are a delicious drop scone! I have been making them for some time, a favorite go to breakfast bread at this house. They are quick to make & relatively healthy if you use low-fat yogurt. The recipe is easily adaptable depending on season and personal taste - in addition to lemon yogurt and blueberries, I have used peach yogurt and chopped frozen peaches, vanilla yogurt and chopped dried cranberries  - and I have halved the recipe. They are always fluffy, tender and so tasty!

They are good. I had to use vanilla yogurt as it was what I had. Now, honestly, it might need a hint more sugar, but it will take a bit of experimentation to get it to my taste. Also, my blueberries were not that sweet but I still tried the recipe as is. I would recommend to use your judgement with the sugar depending on the sweetness of the fruit. Despite my one little mistake of forgetting to melt the butter, they came out soft and were so the next day.

These turned out very moist and flavorful. The only thing I changed was I used 1/2 cup lemon yogurt and 1/2 cup of sour cream because I didnâ€™t have enough yogurt on hand. I will make these again!

I had never made scones before and this recipe was not only easy, it is delicious! I got 16 scones using a 1 tbs cookie scoop. They were done in 18 minutes. I waited 3 minutes and then I glazed them. Thanks for a great recipe!

Not bad but not my favorite scone tasting. It turned out better than how the dough felt "folding in the blueberries"  .I might try it again.

next time i will definitely have the lemon yogurt on hand instead of using plain with lemon juice mixed in~turned out good (and even a scone disliking friend took leftovers home) but they wanted more lemon flavor. will have fun with different fruit combos in the future since the basic recipe works so well.

Love this recipe cuz it's delicious, simpler and uses less butter than most. I used low fat yogurt since that was all I had.  The dough came out quite dry for me, and I'm not sure why. I had to form scones by hand to keep them from falling apart. The glaze recipe is easy and wonderful after I added some lemon zest. I will use this base recipe with other contents in the future, like lemon, almond or cinnamon (sans lemon).

These are terrific! Ok, I did change two things....I used finely chopped strawberries because that's what I had. I would also try these with peaches! I also used half whole wheat/AP flours. The texture is different, not in a bad way, from traditional, kneaded, rolled-out scones, but also easier! Light, fluffy, not too sweet.  I also portioned them with an ice cream scoop making them slightly bigger, so baking time was about 18 min. I got 13 out of my batch.  Recommend to anyone afraid of the rolling out/cutting portions method. They are just so great!

So GOOD! First time I've made scones and these were easy. Nice lemony flavor and full of blueberries. I will make these often from now on! Perfect with tea.
