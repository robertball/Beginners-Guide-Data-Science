This was excellent, though I did a few things differently. I prepared slow cooking rice ahead of time. I also gently steamed the fresh broccoli first.  This saves from having to overcook the chicken while waiting for the rice and vegetables to become tender, which seems to happen to me occasionally.  This dish was delicious, and easy!

I like other reviewers used cooked brown rice then put it into the oven to bake for 30 minutes and this helped ensure chicken to be fully cooked. Simple, easy to make with good results

In order to avoid undercooked rice, I changed up the preparation a little - I cooked the rice in chicken broth before adding it to the soup mixture in my skillet. I should have pre-cooked the broccoli too - it took a while to cook through in the sauce mixture. I used a little bit of chicken broth instead of water in the sauce mix, and I seasoned the chicken breasts with salt, pepper, and garlic powder before cooking in garlic-infused olive oil (yum!). The overall result was pretty good. I'd do this again because it certainly was quick & easy, but I'll have to play around with the prep a little more.

Decent, but a little bland.  Possibly I had the wrong instant brown rice, but it was underdone.

It was a very easy recipe, although I did cook slow cooking rice beforehand. It was good and seemed like a very healthy meal too. My brother kept suggesting that I should have added cheese to it. Might try that next time. Will let you all know how that turns out.

Very easy and fast! I would suggest cooking the chicken until almost done, little pink left. My picky husband even LOVED this and he has always disliked broccoli! Thanks for sharing this with us!

Made as directed and came out very well.  I added onions and celery. Will definitely make again.

Very good, basic recipe.  Flavorful but simple enough for my family's midwestern palate.

I did as other reviews suggeated and added spices, but the chicken came out rubbery and without flavor. I don't  think it should have as high a rating as it got.

The broccoli was hard and rice was under cooked; chicken was okay.

We liked this one but I added some zip with some hot sauce at serving time, But that's just me. It was A-OK as made.

This was a great quick and easy meal for a busy family. Whats better is that you could make this with things you most likely have in your kitchen. I did spice my chicken up before I cooked it. The rice and broccoli was ok it was a bit bland for my taste but in the future I might add some lemon zest for zing or some shredded cheese for creaminess. Over all I prepared as advertised and it came out great my chicken was not rubbery and the rice was done (I used minute brown rice.) I would have given this only three stars but it was super quick, easy, and convenient so for that it's gets four stars
