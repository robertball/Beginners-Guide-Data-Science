Found this recipe while wondering what to do with the six pounds of beautiful green tomatoes in our side yard.
Followed the recipe exactly (to the best of my ability) and the results are fantastic!!
Produced 13 jars (250ml) - enough for selective giving!! :)

This was delicious!  I gave out jars to family and friends, everyone loved it.  I used items I had in my pantry, I substituted the basil with celery seed, used red delicious apples, yellow onions and green peppers.  There was a lot of liquid left after cooking down which I threw out, next time, I will reduce the sugar and apple cider vinegar to 2 1/2 cups each for the 48 servings.

much too sweet for me.  I like the concept and might try it again with half the sugar.

I had a lot of green tomatoes and this recipe came up.  I followed the recipe as written except for upping the amount since I had so much and didn't want to waste.  I am not a regular salsa person but I loved this one...family also loved it.  Will definitely make this again.
