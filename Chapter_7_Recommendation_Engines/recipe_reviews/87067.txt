We have a load of striper that we caught on Lake Texoma and needed different recipes. This was yummy! I didn't have any shrimp but it turned out delightful! Thanks! We will make this again only with the shrimp!

Fabulous, if you don't overcook the shrimp. Add shrimp right at the end! First try, followed the recipe (although we use soup base instead of bouillon) and loved it!  Second time, substituted chicken soup base for the beef, added shrimp right at the end, and after shrimp cooked a few minutes, added about a cup of half and half. INCREDIBLE! Served over white rice. A new favorite!

this was ok, i had to substitue tilapia for the catfish but the fish wasn't the problem...the soup itself was just lacking something..next time i'll try adding some shrimp bouillon along with the beef, i think that should do the trick. still good recipe though.

Good recipe.  Allows for a lot of experimenting. I think next time I use it I'll not use fish but thats a personal preference.  Rather soupy if you are looking for a thick gumbo.  I thought it was quite good for a thick spicy soup.

Wonderful gumbo!  I just put everything in the pot and let it simmer for an hour and a half, which really let the catfish absorb the spices and flavors.  My family was wary about the catfish at first but loved this recipe!

This recipe was okay. I was looking for a gumbo recipe that did not use butter as a roux and something special for New Years. I was a little confused with the dry crab boil. The store had many varieties of crab boils including the liquid. I ended up buying the kind in the cheese clothe (big mistake) The little seeds were a bit annoying. I think I was suppose to buy a powder kind. I wish that had been specified in the recipe. I also added smoked turkey sausage which gave it a good taste. I also added a little cornstarch to thicken it just a bit. My husband and the kids ate it. So.... I think they liked it. My husband rated it a five because I made it. Would I make it again? Not unless they ask for it.

My family enjoyed this dish. I made it like it said, but it is a little soupy. Defintely will cut down the water to 4 cups instead of 6 next time. Overall great recipe.

Great! It's a real comfort food. We added sausage and substituted cod for catfish. We loaded it with the seafood and meat. Served over rice, there is plenty left over to freeze.

This gumbo was easy and delicious. Great comfort food, it makes you feel warm and good inside. I left out a few of the herbs because I'm a beginner and I didn't want to complicate things, but it was still delicious! This is the kind of recipe you want to cook for other people so you can show off. ;)

LOVELY! I added sausage, substituted chicken bullion instead of beef, and only 4 cups of water as a previous review suggested. Thanks. Absolutely fantastic flavor!

I made this for my husband's birthday and it turned out unbelievably well! I used cod instead of catfish, Old Bay seasoning instead of crab boil, added a teaspoon of ground black pepper and reduced the amount of salt to a half a teaspoon. I let the cod cook the entire reccomended time, but I added the shrimp about 5 minutes before I took it off the stove, so they wouldn't get rubbery. Aside from those modifications, I followed the recipe to a T. I served it over white rice. We have tons of leftovers, which we have been enjoying. Such a great recipe and one that I will be returning to again and again.

at lorna129, when you use the bagged seasoning, I think you are supposed to leave the bag on and drop it in the post.  then you can just pull it out. I did not cook this.  just browsing the gumbo recipes because I am cooking some today!!!

Pretty good... but do NOT simmer the shrimp for 30 minutes unless you like rubber shrimp. Add them with about 5 - 6 minutes to go, and it will be much better. Same with the fish. You don't want to over cook it..... fish might take 1 or 2 minutes more than the shrimp.

I added 1/2 cup grated carrots, only 1 can of soup and used unsweetened almond milk in place of the whipping cream.  I also cooked the veggies (minced) in 2 T of clarified butter.

I wanted it to be a tab bit thick, added flour water, came out great. Other than that, thank you for the great recipe. Delicious, shared it with the people who we fish with in a group. They loved it and ants more great recipes with catfish.

This recipe is a much simpler version than most gumbos because there is no roux to make.  The recommendations to cut water to 4 cups was spot on.  I also added some Creole Seasoning and right before serving stirred in a tablespoon of Gumbo File which really did the trick  Just an FYI the shrimp boil in the recipe should be Bays which anyone should be able to find.
