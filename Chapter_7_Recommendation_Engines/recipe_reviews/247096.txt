I make my own enchilada sauces and have never used tomatillo in the red chili sauces so I wasn't sure about this one.  What s surprise. This is soo good.  I did a couple of things different.  Rather than steam the chilies I simmered them in a just enough water just to cover them (do not throw out the liquid from the chilies) then added the remaining ingredients except chicken base.  You do not need it.  The flavour is wonderful without it.  I did an extra 2 garlic cloves and some fresh oregano.  After I removed from the heat I added 2/3 of 15 ounce can of tomato sauce let cool and then blended it in the blender.  Also You do not need to remove the seeds from the chilies.  I am going to be making this ALL the time and it is an excellent salsa roja with chips.  Thank you for sharing!

Smoky and smooth flavoured sauce. It's thick enough to use as a dip and that's exactly what I did with it. Now, I have to make more for my enchiladas! Thank you for the recipe.

This sauce is very delicious. I love the addition of tomatillos. It's a red sauce that gives a slight nod to a green sauce. I have used ancho when I didn't have pasilla, and a combo of both, sometimes I add a few guajillo or california chiles depending on what I have on hand or if I want a slight kick. There is wiggle room. This tastes great as is and with other chile improvisations. I press the blended mixture through a sieve and come out with a beautiful velvety sauce. I eat this with enchiladas, drizzled on quesadillas, migas, fried eggs, I dip chicken in it...so good. Thank you so much for this recipe!

This is a good basic recipe for me but I have a few changes:  I saut√© an anaheim pepper and the onions, garlic rather than boil it first; then throw it and the tomatoes & tomatillos all in to puree it all; then back in the pan to heat together, adding lime juice and cilantro & seasonings (along with the chicken bouillon).  Fabulous!!!
