Good recipe.  The cream cheese gave it an interesting flavor.  Nice and sweet, but make sure that you'll eat all the strawberries once you've made them.  I put a few in the fridge after, and it became mushy and the red sprinkles began to run onto the plate.

These were sweet and a great treat for the summer!  Use less sugar if it becomes too sweet....!

LOVE this recipe!  I didn't even make it right.  Somehow missed the part about refrigerating the cream cheese mixture before dipping in the colored sugar.  Instead, I mixed everything together (including the food coloring and granulated sugar and the cream cheese).  But my guests said it was better than strawberries dipped in chocolate!  A 100% winner - you can't mess it up :)

They tasted pretty good, but didn't look very pretty. First of all I had to spread the cream cheese mixture with a knife because it wouldn't stick to the strawberry if I just dipped it. Second, the sugar started melting and running right from the start. It looks a lot better and runs much less if you use colored sugar bought from the store, as they are bigger crystals. Also, make sure the strawberries are completely dry.

Read the recipe incorrectly and ended up adding all the ingredients at once! We ended up just dipping the strawberries in the cream cheese. Delicious! :)

As I was just making these as a quick snack for myself, I didn't bother with the food coloring part. I loved the contrast of the cream cheese mixture with the strawberries. I'll be making these again. Thanks, Serrah!

These are scrumpdiddlyumptious! Unbelieveably good. The dip tasted liked the vanilla fruit dip served at Jason's Deli. I used neufchatel cheese. Fabulous recipe and I will be using this one a lot. So many Thanks, this is awesome!

I liked the cream cheese mixture with the strawberries and I thought the sparkles looked really nice but it was kind of messy to eat. I think I would like this better & serve it as a dip for fruit instead of having it on the fruit already.  Thx.

The taste was good, but you need to eat as soon as you make them. I brought them to a picnic and within 15 minutes the juice from the strawberries had leaked out and the frosting all slid off, with the sprinkles melting into a gooey mess.

These are really yummy and I love the name of the recipe :)  However, if you're looking to take these to an event I wouldn't recommend it.  Once I had the cream cheese mixture on I rolled them in red sugar sprinkles.  About a minute after they were on the plate the color started running and the cream cheese started melting off the strawberries.  It was a huge mess.  So what I ended up doing was just putting the cream cheese mixture (that I dyed neon pink) in a pretty bowl and I arranged the strawberries on a matching plate.  It was a cute little display and people could spoon the dip out and use the sprinkles as they wished.  One last thing...I added much more powdered sugar and vanilla to the cream cheese to make it sweeter!

Excellent, went super fast at my memorial day cookout.  My sister in laws all demanded the recipe, and my nieces used the extra cream cheese mix to eat with their veggies.

What a neat treat!! Adjust sugar to your own liking, we thought it was just fine. Thanks for the post.
