I didn't have enough nuts so I used a little chocolate to make the two cups of nuts. It really worked out well. It was also a very big hit with my kids!! This one's a keeper!! Thanks!

I made this recipe into triangles and it still worked perfectly. It was my first time using phyllo but after a few I got the hang of it. Also I added a few chocolate chips peanut butter chips and Heath bits to the filling for variety. They were sinfully delicious!

This was simple and tasty. I used butter spray on the dough to save some calories. It was a little dry but went great with ice cream (thanks to the reviewer that suggested it!)

The flavor is great but it is dry. I will make it again but I would like to make the nut mixture with more moisture. I will also bake it whole rather than sliced just to keep it together. I also think that ice cream would be a great addition to serve it with hot.
