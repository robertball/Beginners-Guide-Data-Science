I give this recipe 5 stars for two reasons. One, this is by far the very best tasting pudding I have ever had! Two, it's easy to make - no difficult cooking techniques required. IMPORTANT TO NOTE: Do NOT bake this pie. It will dry it out and put a tough skin on it. Just refrigerate it and top it with whipped topping when you serve it. The filling has such a wonderful vanilla flavor - yummy! The best crust for this pie, btw, is a vanilla wafer crust. Just mix 1-1/2 c crushed vanilla wafers w/6 T melted butter and bake for 5 mins at 350. Really sets off the banana pie!

Ok, this is a first for me I didn't adjust a thing. I used 3 tablespoons of cornstarch. I cooked the first 4 ingredients until thick. I than added some of the cooked mixture into the 3 yolks, than added the egg mixture into the sauce pan. I used the 3 egg whites, 1/4 tsp cream of tarter, 1 tsp of vanilla and 6 tablespoons of white sugar for a meringue( I hate to waste food) baked for 7 mins. Than cooled for 45 mins by a open window, popped it into the fridge for 3 hours and it was perfect.

Woah baby!  This is one you won't soon forget.  My family was IMPRESSED.  This was only the second pie I've ever made, and it turned out GREAT!  I used the "Basic Flaky Pie Crust" recipe from this site (a terrific recipe too).  I followed other reviewer recommendations to, 1) use less sugar - 1/2 cup, 2) not to bake, 3) use corn starh instead of flour, and 4) CHILL extensively.  These were all excellent suggestions.  I topped this pie with heavy whipping cream (easy recipe available on this website) and it disappeared in nothing flat.

Probably would have been 5 without my changes.  1. Dip banana slices into either lemon juice or Sprite. The citric acid will keep them from turning brown quickly. Pat them dry. 2. Must use whole milk for pudding or it will be runny. Must cook over VERY low heat and stir constantly, until THICKENED. It will take a lot longer than 2 minutes.  3. Let the pudding cool slightly (you can stick your finger in it and leave it for a while without burning) before tempering eggs and adding all together. 4. Flour is terrible for pudding. Always use cornstarch. No lumps, no hassle. 3 Tablespoons of CS rather than 1/3 cup flour. Put sugar, CS, salt and milk in pan all together and start stirring over low heat.  5. I use a full Tablespoon of vanilla, but that's me! 6. Unless you WANT pudding skin, cover the surface of the pudding with saran wrap.  7. Use a pre-baked and COOLED graham cracker or vanilla wafer crust. CHILL the pudding for at least 2 hours before putting in crust. 8. DO NOT bake this pie after assembling! It will gum up your pudding and dry the whole pie out. Now, I realize if you follow my directions, it's not the same recipe. But it was a good basic start, and with these few tips, you can expect great results that avoid the other negative reviewers issues. P.S. Take a look at some of the Homemade Vanilla Pudding recipes & reviews for more tips on how to make great pudding. The secret is in the cooking and getting a feel for when it is thick enough, then chilling before use.

So, so good for a hot summer afternoon or picnic. I can't agree more with 'kate'- DEFINITELY DO NOT BAKE THIS PIE. I've baked DOZENS of pies in the last 7 years, and I've never come across a banana cream pie that was baked. Might be a typo in the recipe. I must add, a baked-from-scratch pie crust is unparelleled in flavor and texture, so those who are intimidated: PLEASE DO YOURSELVES A FAVOR AND TRY IT! YOU WILL SHUN STORE-BOUGHT BRANDS =) Some of us have claimed the filling was runny; I highly suspect that the custard was not cooked to its full thickness. Remember: the custard should be at a constant SIMMER; meaning, small bubbles should be forming around the edges for about 3-5 minutes. If the custard is at a constant simmer, keep stirring and dip a spoon into it. Lift it out. With your finger, mark a line down the back of the spoon. The line should stay distinct and not meld together so easily. That means its ready. BTW, I once made this pie without the bananas. All I did was stir in 2 TBS. banana liquer into the custard along with the butter and vanilla. I suppose if I added the bananas, it would that much better. To really wow your guests, consider whipping your own sweetened cream instead of the whipped topping. Oh yes, and do not substitute skim milk- it will also negatively affect the consistency of the custard.

This recipe was so easy to make, and was a huge hit for a birthday party! I highly recommend this. A quick swap of coconut (instead of banana), or any other fruit would make a wonderful alternate pie. For those users who ended up with a soupy mess: Be SURE to use at least 2% or preferably whole milk to make a perfectly thick custard. This recipe cannot be 'healthified' by cutting back to skim or fat free milk (sorry! :).

This pie was the best ever, I made 2 and found out that it needed chilling for longer than 1 hour though. It was runny with the 1st pie and the 2nd I let set for 3 hours and it stayed together. I also found that mixing the banana into the pudding before putting it into the shell was easier to keep the pie together.

My father has been dying for a made from scratch banana cream pie. I choose this one and he loved it! I used a made from scratch pie crust, which makes a huge difference, in my opinion. After reading other reviews, I decided not to bake it, but made sure the shell and filling was cool before I chilled it, and it came out great.

This was the best banana cream pie I have ever tasted, I've made it twice and everyone loved it.  I didn't bake it, I let it sit overnight.  I also used 7 bananas (enough to fill the pie pan).
I used a homemade graham cracker crust.  The pudding is really good all by itself too.

I made this pie for work and it was a HUGE hit! I was a little surprised that the final step was to bake the pie after the pastry cream was poured over the bananas.  But after I pulled it out of the oven, I realized that this step helps to set the filling.  I also noticed that some people left out or changed ingredients in the filling recipe.  This is not a pudding, very similar but still not a pudding.  This is a traditional French pasrty cream and is made with the traditional French method.  I do not recomend changing anything with that part of the recipe! Esp. the addition of the vanilla and the butter!  It is also important to make sure that your bananas are fully covered with the cream to prevent browning.  One step that I did include was for the crust.  Before I pre baked the pie shells I brushed them thouroughly with an egg wash, then baked.  This will help to prevent a soggy crust, since I didnt serve this until the next day.  GREAT PIE!

For the cooks new to making scratch cream pies, here is a little help to prevent runny pies that didn't set up. Flour has to actually boil for a couple of minutes to achieve its thickening properties. Corn starch thickens a little quicker; it will start thickening the pudding before it actually comes to a boil. So, if you're not letting it REALLY boil and using flour, it won't set up all the way. The eggs also help to thicken it.  Here is a nice website with lots of helpful pie information; http://www.preparedpantry.com/theperfectpielandingpage.aspx   Also, for the people who think this has to be cooked, you are confusing it with a true "custard" pie, like a Sugar Pie, Egg Custard, Pumpkin or a Pecan Pie. This is a "cream" pie, similar to using Jello-o cooked pudding and pie filling. Only a thousand times better. Remember: the filling should have thickened before you pour it into a pre-baked pie shell or crumb crust pie (like Keebler graham cracker crusts), then you chill it and serve with whipped cream or Cool Whip. Keep trying, you will be rewarded with heavenly tasting pie. One last thing, be sure to use fully ripened bananas for full flavor. Don't use greenish ones. They need to at least have brown freckles on them to have a good banana flavor in the pie.

This did not work out too well for me-I thought that the pudding layer was too gummy and the bananas underneath turned brown.

I read through at least 50 reviews on this recipe, and took the best of advice to make the most delicious banananess my family has ever tasted. I made it with a Vanilla Wafer crushed (90 cookies crushed, mixed with 1.25 sticks of melted butter, baked for 10 min on 350 degrees). Then, added 3 whole sliced bananas on top of the crust before pouring in the pudding. I also added 3 diced bananas to the pudding, and let chill for about 5 hours before serving with fresh whipped cream. I used corn starch rather than flour, and the pie was the perfect consistency, so much that it even came out of the pie plate in perfect slices! Delish!

This is a great recipe but the trick so it doesn't turn out 'gummy', is to mix the dry ingredients together in bowl.  Heat the milk alone to a boil.  Just when it starts to boil whisk in the dry ingredients.  It will thicken immediately.  At that point remove from the heat and add some of the mixture to the egg yolk until your sure the egg won't just cook and clump.  You then add the yolk to the pot again using a whisk.  Place the pot of pudding back on the heat(low so it doesn't scortch) and stir gently as needed for 2 minutes.  Remove from the heat again and add your vanilla and butter.  Stir well.  Add to an already cooked crust that you have lined with thinly sliced bananas.  Once cooled completely, add more sliced bananas to the top and finish with a whole lotta whipped cream.  If you noticed.  I don't bake it.  The crust is pre done and the pudding cooks enough in the pot.  I've never had this recipe fail me.  It's exactly like my mothers. YUMMY!

Everyone at the Memorial Day BBQ loved this!  Here are the changes I made, based on other reviews:  1) I didn't bake it.  2) I mixed the bananas (dipped in a lemon juice/water mixture & patted dry) into the pudding a few hours before serving so that they didn't brown, and I put the pudding in the crust a few hours before serving so that the crust didn't soften too much.  3) I chilled the pudding by itself overnight (w/ Saran wrap layered directly on the pudding, so that it didn't develop pudding skin).  4) I subbed the 3T of cornstarch for the flour.  5) I used whole milk.  6) I made sure that I simmered (small bubbles around edges) for 3 minutes until I could make a distinct line down the back of the spoon without it melding back together.  6) I used 2 very large bananas.  7) For the crust I used the "Vanilla Wafer Crust" recipe from this site, and I used the "Sweetened Whipped Cream" recipe to pipe onto the top.  8) To transport w/out messing up the piped whipped cream, I used a few toothpicks along the outer edge of the pie and 1-2 in the middle to tent the Saran wrap covering.

I like this recipe.. I took Nilla waffers and made my crust or buy the nilla waffer crust pre done... Much better than than the other crusts for banana cream pie. And at my last boil. I added about a 1/8 cup of cornstarch not straight in the mixture I blended it with about 1/8 cup of half and half, milk will do fine. I still used flour as well.  It instantly gets alot thicker.  Let cool for a few then poor into the pie. For my topping I used 3/4 cup whipping cream, 2tbsp powdered sugar, and 1tsp vanilla. whip it till you get your desired thickness. Not to much or you will have butter.  After pie has been in the fridge for about a hour or 2 top with the whipped cream.. Seriously my favorite banana cream pie. The cornstarch after the flour really does help and my pies slice so well.. yummy!!! This recipe would be considered a old fashioned banana cream pie...give it a try I promise happy results evry single time. No soupy pies anymore!!! Dont add more flour or it will taste like flour!!

This was my first time making a cream pie and I love it, I made two for my families gathering on mothers day. I was a bit nervous about doing it so I made sure to read through the comments with what people had problems with. I found that a fair amount of peoples pudding was coming out runny so I googled what would be causing that. I found this on the NPR website the author is  Shirley Corriher 
"Pie fillings contain egg yolks, and egg yolks have an enzyme, alpha-amylase, which just loves to gobble up starch. The recipe tells the cook to heat the filling (bring it to a boil) after the yolks are added. But you need to really bring it to a boil to get all of the filling above 170 degrees Fahrenheit. That's the temperature needed to kill alpha-amylase. This is hard to do — the filling is thick and sticking and going blop, blop, blop. But if you don't get it hot enough, it just takes a few little alpha-amylase to gobble away like Pac-Man — and there goes all the starch that was holding your filling nice and firm."

Outstanding! (I've made this pie twice within about 1 1/2 weeks, which should speak to the addictive and comfort-food quality :)) Followed recipe to a T, except I did not bake, just as other reviewers suggested.  Also, I simply (gently) folded the bananas into the pudding mix, BUT first set aside a small amount of pudding w/ no bananas in it. Then cover top of pie with the plain pudding; any bananas exposed to air will turn brown within a few hrs, and this will seal them in nicely. I put whipped topping on each slice just before serving. (If you remove a wedge of the pie and the inside edges of remaining pie go brown by next day in fridge, fear not.  Just remove thin slice where bananas were exposed, and the rest of interior of pie will remain beautiful and presentable.) Great thing about this recipe is that I now know how to make pudding as well; this vanilla-flavored pudding is just wonderful on its own.

This pie was excellent! It tasted sweet, creamy, and thick! I would suggest cutting the bananas down to about two, instead of four. If you prefer using a graham cracker crust instead of regular pastry, Here is the thing to do: Spread the thickened pudding mixture into a ungreased square glass pan, and set the filling into the oven for the time said on the recipe, once it is done pour the mixture into the crust and refrigerate for one hour.   Enjoy!

This recipe was so easy and soooo delicious.  Nice presentation too!  I believe the reason some people had trouble with it was because they tried to hurry the process. This is not instant pudding, no fast track here, so slow down and stir, stir and more stirs. While constantly stirring I had the stove temp on High (never stopping) as soon as it started to bubble (slow boil) I turned down the heat to Medium and contined with directions and continued to stir. I used a whisk, got all my ingredients out and measured, eggs first, and by the time I needed them they easily blended with the hot custard. So creamy and so smooth....It's a WINNER!!! I did take the suggestions of a few and used cornstarch (as I feel it thicken smoother) and I also smashed some bananas on the bottom of the baked pie shell. I only had fat free milk so I used 1 1/2 cups of skim and 1/2 cup of Fat Free half and half...Delish! I DID NOT put in the oven.....I let the pie cool and I placed it in the frig at least 2 hours before serving. My pie was completely set in about 45 minutes. Thanks!

This pie is delicious! and much easier than i thought it would be after reading the posts and i dont' cook that often. i did take some of the tips on this board cuz i figure you all know more than me. i used 1/2 c sugar rather than 3/4 c. i also packed the flour when measuring. used whole milk. made sure my eggs yolks were at room temp. let the pudding cool for about 45 minutes with plastic wrap over the top so it wouldn't form a skin. when the pudding had cooled i then sliced the bananas and added them to the mixture before putting into the crust and topping w/meringue. i cooked for 15 minutes as directed. several people said theirs was runny and the only reason i can think is that they did not cook the pudding long enough. i cooked it as the recipe says, for 2 minutes after it started bubbling...stirring constantly. i took it out, sprinkled the meringe with chocolate shavings and let it cool for an hour before putting it in the frig. i actually left it in the frig overnight. the results were just incredible. i shared with some friends and got nothing but raves. i highly recommned this pie...it's very yummy!

I really liked this! I used the store-bought Nilla Wafer crust.  The directions that came with the crust said to brush the crust with egg white and bake for 5 minutes at 375.  I did this and it "sealed" the crust and made it crisper.  A baking cookbook that I have said that bananas on the bottom make the crust soggy and if they are on top they obviously turn brown so I layered them in between layers of the pudding filling. The filling was sooooo good! I think it would have been 5 stars if it was a homemade pie crust but it was really a hit with everyone.

I found this recipe as I wanted to try baking a dessert pie, as most pies we eat here are savoury (mince, bacon and egg, etc).  It tastes really delicious and I followed the recipe exactly.  I would like to make it again but make a few adjustments as I don't like the tough crust that the custard forms on baking/chilling.  I think next time I would put a meringue on top (using the spare egg whites of course, handy that) before baking the pie.  That would prevent the custard from forming that crust and also make the pie look more 'creamy'.  To make room for the meringue I will probably decrease to 2 or 3 bananas as the custard only just fitted into the pie dish with 4 bananas.  The taste of this pie is really delicious, nice vanilla and banana flavours and very creamy tasting for something that doesn't contain cream!  I would also consider using the pudding part of the recipe to make a warm custard to serve with bananas as a hot dessert as it is the best custard I have ever made and was a lot of fun too.

This was my first time making any sort of pie dish and it came out AMAZING!! i was so happy! I looked up a pie crust recipe and it came out amazing. Also, if you are looking for a nice crisp and flaky crust, spread some egg wash on it and bake for about 3 minutes by itself and make sure the crust cools completely before you put the creme filling in.

For the actual pie I kept stirring longer than the 2 minutes she recommended because the more you stir the more you can see it thicken and turn into like a custard texture! If it's not a custard like texture when u put it in the pie mold then it will come out soupy. 
I also took the advice of others and mixed the bananas in the mixture, rather than placing them at the bottom of the crust. BUT MAKE SURE THAT NONE OF YOUR BANANAS ARE ON THE TOP OF THE PIE. they will turn all brown and not taste right (helpful hint from my mama)

When it comes time to cook the dish, you aren't really cooking much. It's just to help it set in shape. Once the pie dish cools, put in the refrigerator overnight. My custard came out super gorgeous the next morning and my fiance and I had a nice banana cream pie with coffee breakfast (not very healthy i know! LOL!)

For the topping I used a simple sweetened whipped topping and it really complemented the flavors and made it look more professional! But that is totally optional since it makes the pie a lot sweeter! 

I will definitely be making this for thanksgiving this year to impress the future in-laws! :)

This pie is perfect exactly as written.  I use this custard base for most of my cream pies and have never had it fail or be runny.  If you cook it long enough, it won't run.  Be sure to let the mixture come to a boil and then cook an additional 2 minutes--not 2 minutes total.  If you mash the bananas into the mixture it will brown more quickly, there is plenty of banana flavor with them on the bottom.  

For a treat in the summer, I slice fresh stawberries and add once the pie is cooled before I add whipped cream.  YUM!

This. is. delicious!!!
I made the pie with the suggested substitute of cornstarch rather than the flour [as the author noted in the intro], and the texture was perfect. No runniness here!
I've never made Banana Cream Pie from scratch before, so when I initially made the custard I thought it was decent, but I had no idea how the banana flavor would compare- the baking of the pie made the bananas soften and seemingly melt into the custard, filling it with a rich and even flavor. It's not comparable to storebought or artificial flavoring- it's simply blows them all out of the water!

I started with a thin layer of custard on the bottom, then alternated thinly sliced [5mm?]bananas and thin layers of custard. The final layer of bananas I completely covered in custard, and the result was evenly softened bananas with no browning- perfection!
I filled the pie just over the top [slightly domed] because I had so much filling for my smallish crust [I think it'd be perfect for a deepdish or homemade], and the way it settled was perfect. A thick layer of real, lightly sweetened whipped cream finished it off perfectly and made it melt in your mouth.

If you don't intend to serve the entire pie I'd suggest putting whipped cream on the pieces individually, or the cream may deflate/melt overnight.

Absolutely phenomenal: our company raved about it and the recipe has been requested multiple times. Definitely a keeper!!!

Photo #48 (above) is mine.  This is an excellent recipe, though I did alter it a bit to fit my needs. First, we needed a large dessert, so I doubled the recipe for a 9x13 dish.  I used a reviewer's suggestion of a crushed vanilla wafer/butter crust.  I used a whole box of wafers, 1.5 sticks melted butter, and added about 1/4 cup brown sugar and pressed it into the dish, baking for about 10 min at 350°, until it darkened.   After the crust cooled I covered it with 3 bananas' worth of slices.  Then I made the filling as directed (amounts doubled for my large dish), with the exception of adding 2 mashed bananas along with the butter and vanilla extract for an extra banana flavor.  I let the filling cool for 10 minutes or so before I poured it, then i sprinkled about 1/2 cup of crushed vanilla wafers and 1/4 cup of sliced almonds over the top.  Per reviewers' suggestions, I did not chance baking this pie, since the filling was already cooked and seemed like it would set up fine as is.  I put it in the refrigerator for about 2 hours and served it with a dollop of cool whip on each piece.  The filling set up perfectly, cutting into nice pieces.  I loved the texture and think the mashed bananas added richness.  The crust was awesome!  It had a nice crunch and didn't sog up.  I liked having sliced almonds on top, for extra crunch and flavor, though next time I'll toast them first.  I'll be using this recipe again.

Definitely DO NOT cook this recipe!  Also, fold the bananas into the cream mixture.  I followed the receipe exactly and it didn't turn out well.  The bananas turned brown and tasted funny because they were cooked and just settled to a "brown mush" in the pie shell.  The creme mixture was the right consistency and tasted great before cooking it, and so it would probably be a great recipe if it was just slightly changed.

This came out absolutely perfect. I used 3 TB cornstarch in place of flour as suggested in the recipe description. When I make it again, I may try the following things, which I did NOT test out yet: #1 - 4 TB cornstarch to extra-thicken, #2 - dousing the sliced bananas in lemon juice or fruit-fresh to keep them from browning inside my pie. I did not bake this pie, nor would I unless I was putting a meringue on; be aware that your CHOICE not to bake it is what will cause it to not set. Baking it without a meringue will make a skin, not baking it is going to let it be runny (as written). Because I like whipped cream on my banana pie, I opted to not bake, and just have it be a little bit runny. What you choose is up to you, but buyer beware: If you don't bake it and it's runny, that's not a problem with the recipe :) Thanks for the BEST old-fashioned banana cream pie I've made, Ruby!

I made this recipe for Thanksgiving dinner and everyone loved it! I paired it up with a shortbread crust and it was absolutely delicious! It did develop a "skin" over top, but this could be avoided by omitting the baking of the pie, or just cover it up with meringue, as I did, and bake it only as directed for meringue. I used the 3 egg whites, 1/4 tsp cream of tarter, 1 tsp of vanilla and 6 tablespoons of white sugar for meringue & baked for 7 mins. Very rich and creamy pudding!

This is a great recipe.  I used the 1/3 cup of corn starch instead of flour and only 1/2 cup of sugar.  I didn't bake the pie either.  I am so glad I read the other reviews.  It's what makes this site great.  I think the reason that people have runny pudding is because they don't cook it long enough.  The pudding gets very thick once it is good and hot.  That is when you pour a bit of that mixture into the egg yolks, stir well and then pour the egg mixture back into the pudding.  Absolutely fantastic recipe!!

I substituted the sugar with 3 tbsp of honey, and used a bit less milk than called for to thicken it easier. Other than that I followed the recipe to a T. It turned out delicious...it was very flavorful and will make this recipe again and again!

Amazing pie!  I always thought for some reason that making homemade banana cream pie was difficult.  Not so! I did not bake this pie per instructions, as after reading all the reviews it seemed that was the consensus.  Let it sit in the fridge overnight and the custard was PERFECT!  I used whole milk, which I believe it important.  Have patience while waiting for the custard to come together and thicken.  It's worth the wait! I decided to slice my bananas directly into the custard and then put this mixture into my shell, smoothing out.  When I served it someone asked if I had put lemon on my bananas because of how white they were. I think that I sliced into the custard and mixed it right away, coated them and therefore prevented the ugly browning.  I also did it this way because I didn't want the fruit on top of itself, and instead wanted it mixed throughout.  Super good.  Try it, you'll love it! Thanks Ruby!

I thought this recipe was a fantastic one for beginners like me. It was the second pie I ever made alone aside from the cheesecake I made( if you consider it a pie). Well this came out amazing and to address a previous review, I highly suggest you bake it as mine didn't come out dry or with a thick skin( it helps give it some form so that it's not just oozing pudding). It is very easy to make and to all the ppl who say that it was too runny, did you make sure that it finished cooking before taking it out because it stays runny for most of the cooking process and eventually begins to custardize if you give it enough time. Well this came out great so i suggest it to all you young bakers who want to begin baking with something do-able. Like a reviewer before me also said, the bananas can also be interchanged with other fruits to give it different types of flavors.

Really easy to make and really tasty pudding.  Overall the pie was a tiny bit bland, but I think that had to do with my bad pie crust and that that's just how banana pudding tastes.  Also I didn't have whipped cream or meringue on top - just some sliced fresh bananas for decoration.


Tip: Use whole milk - reduced fat milks will make a soupy pudding.  


Tip 2: Before you take it out of the saucepan it should no longer be soupy - it should have turned into pudding.  This transformation is instantaneous and seems somewhat inexplicable because one moment it's soup and the next it's thick pudding.  If your pudding is soupy you'll need to cook it longer than the recipe says -- this could be due to the way your pan has heated up and the level of heat used.  SO, you look for large bubbles throughout before you cook for 2 minutes and add the egg mixture. Then a little after you add the egg mixture (as I remember) it suddenly turns to pudding.

Two bites and my husband said it was better than his grandmother's famous banana cream pie.  That's saying a lot! A few changes: I DID NOT put bananas in the bottom, I made the pudding as is, baked for HALF the time, just until it was the right consistancy, then let it cool.  I topped it with fresh bananas just before serving (I hate mushy, cooked bananas) and topped with whipped cream.  FOR THE LOVE OF ALL THAT IS HOLY, USE REAL WHIPPED CREAM!!! It's worth every calorie.  I just whipped the cream in my kitchenaid, added powdered sugar and a spash of vanilla and it was divine.

This pie is AWESOME!!!!  I followed the recipe and it came out PERFECT!!!!  And, this was the 1st pie I have EVER made in my 37 years of life.  It is not runny at all.  For the person(s) who had runny pudding mixture...I don't think you cooked the pudding mixture long enough....when it says until it starts bubbling...it isn't the little bit of bubbling you get from stirring it.  It really starts to get big bubbles from the heat and then you just continue to stir as the instructions state and just keep stirring......I think you should try making it again and you will be pleasantly surprised:o)

Yummy and it was a big hit...CLue though make sure to use at least 2% milk.  If you use 1% or less it will not set up and you get the ooey gooey pie instead.

This is the best recipe for Banana Cream pie, all of our friends and family rave about how great it is!  My best suggestion is to subsitute part of your 1/3 Cup of flour for cornstarch.  This will help everyone with the 'soup' part, and make it firm.  Take out your 1/3 Cup dry measuring cup and fill it with half full of flour, and the other half with cornstarch, works everytime!!  Cornstarch is the key here!

This came out perfectly. I didn't change anything at all. You really have to keep stirring the whole time till it thickens up then a few minutes after. Don't stop! :) Yes the filling is darker, that's because there are no chemicals to change the color - like instant pudding. Yum yum! Try it. It's super easy.

I made this recipe only because I saw a number of posting that stated the 'batter' was runny.  The recipe as stands serves up perfectly.  To those that are too runny I can see a couple of things that can happed to create this.  Your sugar or flour amounts were to low (incorrect measure or omitted) number two your cooking to bubbling and then 2 additional minutes where not achieved.   There is also the additional 2 minutes of cook time after the introduction of the egg yolks.  I believe this to  be the root of most 'runny' results.  I only give it a four because the flavor of the custard/pudding is a bit bland.  Increase the vanilla to 2 tsps would help.

Pretty tasty - next time I'll mix in the bananas before putting in the crust and remember the whipped cream but the family enjoyed it and my 2 year old was singing 'more banana pie' the rest of the evening.

This pie turned out more like banana cream soup than pie for me.  I think part of the problem was the instructions say to stir until "bubbly" and should say stir until "boiling".  I didn't heat it long enough for sure.  I also think the amount of bananas should be reduced and not added until the pudding has started to set (there is something about bananas that prevents the pudding from setting all the way).  After an unsuccessful attempt at this recipe, I tried another that turned out very well.

My boyfriend is a banana cream pie fanatic, and he said this was the best he ever had! I also substituted 3 tbsp cornstarch for flour, didn't bake the pie, and ensured the pudding and crust were cool before assembling and chilling for another 3 hours... like many of the readers.

I never made a home made banana cream pie.  I always used the banana pudding mix.  This was easy to make and the cream pie filling was delicious.  I followed the recipe excatly. We gobbled this up in two day, between two of us.

Excellent recipe!  I did as others suggested and used 1/2 cornstarch and 1/2 flour as the thickener.  Also, another reviewer suggested that there wasn't enough banana flavour.  I've always used banana extract instead of vanilla.  Adds a rich banana flavour.  (I also use coconut extract in my coconut cream pie.)

excellent pie - i add a bit of coconut with the bananas and top with sliced almonds - i do bake it until the almonds on top brown and it has never ever been dry - you will only get a skin on it if you do not cover it before you refridgerate - i make this about once every two weeks and it has turned out every time

This was fabulous! I made the nilla wafer crust instead, 1 1/2 cups well crushed vanilla wafers , 6 tablespoons melted butter. Toss. Bake 350 until slightly golden. 5-9 minutes. Let cool.  I used a 10 inch deep dish pie plate, so I scaled this to 1 recipe x's a half of the recipe and it fit perfectly in my pie pan. Oh! I didn't bake it. We use skim milk so I put a little half n half cream for some of the milk. Topped it off with Ready whipped cream and shaved dark chocolate pieces. What a good taste combo. Absolutely delish! Brother in law said I should enter it into a contest! Thanks for the recipe!

This is EXCELLENT! I read some of the other reviews. First, don't cook this pie. There is no need. Just let it cool. Also for those who were having trouble getting the pie to set I'm thinking that maybe you didn't stir enough as it was thickening. Be sure to cook on the stove on med heat and stir constantly while bubbling. Follow the recipe exactly, except for the baking part and you should have a perfect pie. I think I'll make it again tomorrow it was sooooo good.

I made this yesterday. I used 1/2 cup sugar, the cornstarch and I did not bake it. When I served it, it didn't stay together too well, but was plenty thick enough. I sprinkled some coconut on top and it was fabulous! I will make this again.

I tried the 3 tlbs. corn starch and the filling was perfect. Great flavor! I did not agree with the baking part of this recipe but did it any way. It seemed to make the filling thinner then when I had it in the sauce pan. After filling the pie crust I knew that it could be chilled then served with no problem. But, I went ahead and baked it. It was all over from that point. Sorry I ever made this one. I will try again and not bake it. Will comment again when done.

Delicious! I took the advice of others that reviewed this recipe and used 3 tablespoons of corn starch. It came out the perfect consistency not runny at all. I also cut back the sugar to 1/2 cup and for me it is perfect. I did not bake the pie. Like others I used a vanilla wafer crust and topped it with whipped cream. When I was done this pie was truly amazing! Thanks for the recipe :o)

A bit sweet.  If your finding the topping runny, you didn't heat/stir it enough.  It took me about 15-20 minutes to get it to a pudding stage.  You don't need cornstarch; just keep stirring, just keep stirring . . .

This was great!  I used 3 tbl cornstarch and cut down on the sugar as suggested, and it was fantastic!  Only suggestions I have are: 1.  Make sure bananas are ripe, and 2. If the whole pie is not going to be devoured immediately, then make sure one puts some kind of cover on it, for the top of the pudding dried out and became kind of hard.  But it was delicious!  I have 2 requests for it already!

It turned out great! I was multi-tasking when I started and put the sugar, cornstarch (I used 1/4 c. cornstarch due to relative with allergy to flour), milk and beaten eggs in saucepan--not what the recipe says.  Oh! Oh!  So, I cooked it as instructed--probably a little too long even though I took it off as soon as it started to bubble because it was thick.  I put in the butter and vanilla, and added 3 drops of yellow food coloring (my preference).  It was a little jellied looking and not smooth.  So, I took my electric mixer and mixed it up.  It turned out GREAT!  I had intended to make the Vanilla Wafer Crust from allrecipes, but was short on time so used a purchased graham cracker crust.  I tasted the custard--yummmm!!  I'll make this again, and next time will try to follow the recipe as far as cooking it.

Excellent!  As others before me I substituted 3 TBS of corn starch for the flour for a smoother, cleaner taste.  I made a second pie using coconut and almond extract.  Soupy pies are a result of not cooking the starch out of the flour-a common mistake for beginners.  I would encourage you to try again with this recipe, it is worth the effort. Thanks for the excellent recipe-sooo much better than instant pudding mix!

My husband loved this pie.  I didn't have to add any cornstarch, I just continued cooking the pudding until it thickened up.  I also did not bake it, as the other reviewers suggested not to, and I only used 2 bananas since that's all I had and it still turned out great!

This was awesome. A few changes after making it once, and it was a little runny.
1. Make sure to use yolks of egg only
2. I replaced the milk with half and half
3. I added 1/2 tsp. of amond extract
4. I used a graham cracker crust from ALL RECIPES submitted by Janaan Cunnungham (Thank you Janaan)
5. I served with homemade sweetened whipped topping with sliced almonds on top.
6. I did bake it, other reviews said not to, and it was great
7. I brushed lemon juice on the bananas to keep them from browning
I would make this again and again. My tasters loved it. It was very attractive, held it's shape nicely and it had AWESOME flavor, from the crust to the top!!!! Thanks so much to Ruby!!!!

WOW I am speachless - This blew my expectations away it was TDF!!!! I followed the recipe exactly as written EXCEPT I did NOT bake it and added some cool whip to the top because what is banana cream pie without the Whipped Cream :). My family LOVED it it was gone in one night and they are all asking for more. Some others mentioned theirs did not set but I let mine cook real good in the pan and let it get thick before I continued with the recipe. YUMMY is all I can say. I don't know how you could possibly make this recipe any better. You will NOT be dissapointed with this one.

I have to give this 5 stars.  It is fantastic!  I have tried making banana cream pies in the past and it has failed every time in one way or another.  This one was perfect!  The pudding thickened appropriately, the bananas didn't turn brown (you have to make sure they are covered by the pudding), the crust was nice and golden.  I couldn't wait to dig in!  I used the flour and not the corn starch.  I think it tastes better that way.

Delicious! One of the best, ever. Just one tip: Only bake the pie for about 7 minutes to set it, otherwise the pie will dry out. I top mine with real whipped cream.

This was such a wonderful pie! The recipe was easy too! As others directed - I did not cook the pie, I used whole milk and cornstarch , rather than flour. I upped the vanilla to 1 Tablespoon. I topped it with cool whip. It was luscious and had great banana flavor! I made a homemade graham cracker crust. Next time I may try with a touch less vanilla and maybe add banana extract. It didn' need it though!

Made this pie twice this month. Once just to try, then another for my mom. i've never made a banana cream pie before so this was a first for me. I usually try a recipe as is first, but after the first pie, although it had great flavor, I made a few small changes. First, I made my own graham cracker crust (another first for me outside of cheesecake) baked and cooled it. Then i used a little cornstarch instead of flour(this was purely a personal prefference, cornstarch just works better for me)and i did not bake this pie either. The eggs cook enough in the saucepan and the pudding is awesome! Then I chilled it for a few hours and right before serving, add a few dollops of whip cream, maybe even a few slivered almonds. This one is definately a keeper, thanks for the recipe.

Excellent :) I was soo surprised that for the first time - my pie came out great! I actually baked my pie crust until brown, then layered the bananas and pudding and just put in the fridge, not sure if anyone else did that hahaa..Great recipe, my 2nd time making it in the last four days - it's that addicting!! My usually very critical younger brother even asked for 3rd helpings! Thanks so much!

I made this for my dads 69th birthday dinner dessert.  Since I can remember, my dad has always boasted how his mom would make "just the best banana cream pie". He will go on to describe how the distinct custard taste perfectly combined with an awesome banana taste. I have never made a pie before, and felt this recipe seemed easy enough for me to make. 
Well it was a hit. My dad loved it! He said it was just like his moms.
-The recipe was spot on. Make sure you constantly stir the mixture while cooking to avoid lumps. 
-instead of slicing the bananas into the pie shell, gently stir them into the pudding mixture, then pour the whole mixture into the pie shell and bake.
-I made my own pie crust. I have used Nilla Wafers once and then vanilla wafers from Trader Joes. They are equally different and delicious. First, melt a half stick of butter.  Finely crush them (I put the cookies in a plastic ziplock bag and use a meat tenderizer hammer to crush them). Pour the butter and crushed cookies into the dish. Use your hands/fingers to gently push the crust into place. Place the pie crust in the freezer while you start making the banana cream pie recipe.

Wow!  This is so good!  I have never made pudding/custard and was able to pull this off no problem.  I usded cornstarch and did not bake the pie.  The consistency was perfect- exactly what I would expect in a cream pie.  I decided to mash up 2 bananas and give them a good mix with the vanilla.  I then added this liquid banana mix to the pudding.  Oh my the pudding is soooo good!  
I'm wondering if some people's pies turned out runny because they covered them and put them in the fridge with they were still warm.  I put the pie in the fridge uncovered for the first 20 minutes to let the steam escape and then I covered it.

This is the first banana cream pie I have ever made.  I followed this recipe but used cornstarch and a mixture of whole milk and evaporated milk.  I followed the recipe for everything else.  It turned out absolutely superb--even the pudding!!! I will be making this pie to serve at my cafe!!!!

I had the same problems as some of the other reviewers even after it set for 2 whole days in the fridge.  My husband and brother-in-law loved it in spite of that.  It was delicious, but I think it would be better as a banana pudding.  Thanks for sharing.

I have tried to make this recipe twice: the first time I thought it failed because I used skim milk (not by choice).  The second time I used whole milk, but the directions are missing the fact that you need to let it thicken in the pan.  How DISAPPOINTING to have to throw an entire liquid pie away not ONCE but TWICE simply because the directions neglected to specify something so simple.  The next time I make this, I am definately going to let the milk cook longer than 2 minutes and use a bit of corn starch.

My husband said this was the best banana cream pie he has ever had.  This is the first time I've made one but it turned out great.  My 8 year old loved it too.  I accidently put too much vanilla in it but my husband said that may be what it made it so good - not being overwhelming with the banana taste.

Banana cream pie was my Grandma's specialty, but I didn't have her recipe, so I thought I'd look for one here. I'm so glad I found this recipe--it was delicious!  I made the changes suggested by many--reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup, used cornstarch instead of flour and didn't bake it, just chilled it for about 3 1/2 hours.    I had no problems with the custard filling being runny--but I made sure to use whole milk and I cooked the custard until it became nice and thick.  I think if you do both of these things, yours should turn out great like mine did.    I tossed my cut-up bananas in some lemon juice to prevent browning, but it didn't do any good--they still turned brown.  That is my only complaint about this recipe, but I don't see how that can really be prevented.    I also folded the bananas into the custard and then put everything into the pie crust--I didn't layer bananas on the bottom first.    I topped with Cool Whip since my family doesn't like meringue and this pie was for my son's birthday.  If I was making it just for me, I would have topped with fresh whipped cream!    All in all, a delicious pie and it was easy to make as long as you follow the instructions carefully.

Looks good when you first make it but even when I tossed the bananas in lemon juice by the next day they all turned brown which made for a very unappealing look.  Only use this recipe is you are going to eat it that same day.  Very similar to the 'pastry cream' recipe on here but without the cornstarch.  Cornstarch (in place of the flour) gives it added body so when you serve it doesn't fall apart.  Add the milk all at once and cook on LOW heat with sugar & cornstarch.  There is no reason to add the milk slowly.  Stir constantly to avoid scorching the bottom.  Cook until it thickens.  Temper eggs and then add to the mixture.  Continue heating until it reaches 160 degrees (recommended safe temp for eggs to be thoroughly cooked).  No need to bake as the pastry cream is already fully cooked, however it won't keep for more than a day.  I have no idea how the picture shows ripe bananas keeping their color since they brown very quickly.

Okay.. so here is what happened. i used flour, but also used a bit of cornstarch too. This pudding looked like the pudding my mom makes when she makes banana pudding. MUST keep stirring until it is thick enough. The secret for me for is to strain/sieve the custard so it is silky smooth. Then I mashed the bananas and mixed it in. I chilled it overnight as some ppl suggested, but that did not do anything. So i baked it for about 20 minutes until it did not jiggle. Then once it cooled I made whipped cream, spread it on top, garnished with crushed nilla wafers, YUM! taste just like store brought banana cream pie, with more of a real banana taste to it. I also used a vanilla wafers crust, definitely a keeper? espescially for a person who hasn't had good experiance with homemade custards/puddings.

this pie is absolutely amazing!  i followed it exactly as written with 2% milk (as suggested by another reviewer) and cooked it slowly over med-low heat.  once it came to a bubble the pudding was super thick and adding the egg yolks perfected it.  if the pudding isnt thick then it needs to be cooked longer so the flour can naturally thicken it, flour thickens at the boiling point.  i used a nilla wafer crust and made fresh whipped cream for the topping to a wonderful pie.  thank you!

Don't put this in the oven - chilling in the fridge or even freezing it will do just fine. Freezing might cause a more ice-cream like texture in the pudding, but otherwise, this pie was delicious. Thanks!

Loved this pie recipe. I did make a whipped cream  mousse to top off the pie. So yummy. I took whipping cream, half packet instant vanilla pudding, dash of vanilla and dash of sugar. Whipped until peaks formed and spread over the top. Yummy!

This is absolutely delicious! I used cornstarch instead of flour and it came out just right and creamy. I cooked the cream in medium heat. It may look watery at first. But when it bubbles, it gets thick and creamy. I took the reviwers' advise not to bake the whole pie and it sure came out just fine. I also made my pie crust with vanilla wafer as someone suggested and it complemented the cream filling so well. I just love this pie recipe. THANK YOU!!!!

I cook/bake ALL the time, I follow directions, I'm not your "typical" guy. Kate's advice May/2006 of not baking this pie was either poor advice or not complete as to what you should do in lieu of baking. My Valentine's Day surprise for my wife is now banana cream soup. For those who read this review, I assure you will find this helpful! Very expensive and disappointing.

I can't figure out what I'm doing wrong - every banana cream pie I make fails to set up right. It always ends up as banana pudding! I made this (and have made at least two other recipes) EXACTLY as directed. I made this pie the night before so it would have extra time to firm up and it didn't. It looked like it was pretty firm until I cut into it. The taste, however, was absolutely delicious. I made it for a graduation party for two of my daughters and it was gone in a matter of minutes, even though it was soft. People raved about the taste. I made the crust out of nilla wafers. Also, if you dip the banana slices in lemon juice, if keeps them from discoloring (and it's such a small amount that it does NOT give them a lemony taste). If anyone can give me some advice, I'd appreciate it. I really do love the taste of the pie, which is why I gave it four stars.
***UPDATE: I made this pie again, after reading JDMITR98's review. I filled the 1/3c. measuring cup with 1/2 flour, 1/2 cornstarch. I also cooked it a tad longer than the recipe states and DID NOT bake it, as others suggested. It came out PERFECT! If I could give it more than 5 stars, I would. Thanks so much, JD!

the best banana cream pie i have ever had! i followed the recipe exactly as it was written and it turned out beautifully. the only thing i recommend is to be very careful when you are making the pudding portion of the recipe. i burnt mine a little bit as i was warming it up but it was easy to get rid of the burnt portion. this will be the only banana cream recipe i ever use again and it was easy too!

This recipe is a MAJOR HIT! It is SO incredibly easy to make and so quick to disappear once prepared!

The pudding recipe alone is a fabulous stand alone dessert! Add 1/2 cup of cocoa to the dry ingredients at first and you have the most mouth watering chocolate pudding! MMMMMM

I am giving this 4*s because I don't like the texture the corn startch gave it.  I made the substitutions just like everyone else and am sorry I did.  Next time I am going to stick to flour.  I think the people who substituted might be afraid of making a white sauce.  I am sure flour would thicken just as nicely and would have given a much smoother texture.  If you like to make a nice cream sauce then definitely stick to flour on this one.  Maybe next time I'll give it 5*s.

This is the best-tasting banana cream pie recipe I have ever found.  Cooking the pie turns the bananas brown, but the end product tastes great!  I used chocolate graham craker crust and topped my pie with freshly sliced bananas.  Everyone loved it!

My children loved this pie, but it was not the easy to make.  I also used the cornstarch in place of the flour.  I made 2 of them for Christmas dinner and they were a big hit, the taste was wonderful, and well worth the work.

Made this for Pi day, delicious and easy!  Took the advice of other reviewers and did not cook the pie.  I used flour not corn starch and  a graham cracker crust, topped it with whipped cream.  I will definitely make this again.

This is my go to banana pudding recipe, I make this A LOT because this is my sons all time favorite dessert and since he is 13, he eats a lot. Using only flour works for me, the pudding thickens up with no problem. Tempering the egg yolks is essential. I think the the trick to this recipe like any other recipe wether cooking  or baking is technique. It does not matter if the recipe is followed to the t, technique has to be aquired. I don't bake the pie at the end, I just let the pudding cool on the pie crust otherwise it will get too gelatinous like and firm and we like the pudding consistency. One thing that may help with getting the pudding to thickening up is whisking, as soon as the milk is poured on the dry ingredients, do not stop whisking until it starts to bubble.

Ok, this pie is amazing! I read a lot of reviews and was about to use cornstarch and not bake it until I read a different review. She said this is not instant pudding... this is a french method, DO NOT CHANGE ANYTHING and bake it. She was right. I think that for the people that came out with a runny pie, they either were using skim milk, or were not patient enough during the stirring part. If you follow exactly what she says to do (i pre-measured everything and had it ready beforehand) and add things exactly when she says to,  it will come out extremely thick. It takes constant stirring at medium heat for a while before the edge will begin to bubble. Once that happens, thats when you continue to stir for 2 minutes and remove from heat, add a little to the egg, pour egg mixture back into pot and cook for a further 2 mins etc... After i finished making it, i let it cool completely. i used a chilled graham cracker pie crust i made and lined it with sliced bananas. I stirred in another sliced banana into the mixture and poured that on top. I then baked it as it said and that only helped it set and brought out an aroma! smelled delicious. i let it cool completely and it put back in fridge until ready to serve. I then decorated top with sliced bananas around the rim like in the picture. I served with freshly made whipped cream. It tasted like something out of a french bakery and I'm no baker! It is perfect the way the recipe is... no need to change anything, DO bake it, and no need

LOVED this recipe!! I've made it for my hubby many times and it's his favorite. I have also made it dairy & soy free replacing milk and butter with Almond milk and Earth Balance butter since I have allergies and it still turned out absolutely delish.

So yummy!! I melted some chocolate and spread it along the bottom before I put in the bananas and the pudding mix. The little bit of chocolate was a great extra. THe second time I made this I made it on a graham cracker pie shell

This was my first attempt at a cream pie and it turned out fabulously!  I followed the directions exactly for the filling and thought it was delicious! (Note: We usually drink skim, but I purposefully bought 2% because some of the other reviews said it helped the filling to be more creamy.)

The only things I did differently were to use a pre-made graham cracker crust (because they were on sale) and I whipped up the leftover egg whites with some sugar to make a meringue to put on top.  I then baked it for about 12 minutes in a 350 degree oven to brown the meringue.

My husband and I both loved the pie and couldn't wait the 3 hours for it to chill before trying a slice. It was great!  The only thing I think I'd change is maybe using whipped cream instead of the meringue for more creamy flavor, but that's just because I've never really loved meringue as much as whipped cream (who could!)

I will be making this again...and again...and again!

Made this for my Family & I yesterday, awesome! We all loved it, my only problem that I had with it was the somewhat tough layer on the top of the pie that the baking caused. But, thats my fault for not reading into the reviews a little more and realizing that some folks do not bake this pie at all. Nevertheless, it did not stick around to long!

MMMMMM! what a delicious recipe! I used a vanilla wafer crust: 40 crushed wafers, 1/4 cup melted butter, and approx 2 tbsp sugar....mix together and baked 350 for 9  min. I did use 3 tbsp cornstarch in place of flour, 1/2 and 1/2 instead of milk, and 1 tbsp vanilla. I also didn't bake it like like others suggested. I'm adding this to my collection of recipes. Thanks!

This recipe is fantastic. I read other reviews and did not bake it. I used the corn starch instead of flour (I'm gluten intolerant) and it was great.  I also used half and half instead of 2% milk and that made a really creamy custard that was rich and wonderful. I topped upon serving with fresh whipped cream. Fantastic recipe!

I've been using a different recipe on here, but this has less calories! This pie goes perfect with Stabilized Whipped cream icing here on this site. I mashed the banana's to put them in the pudding to enjoy the chunky texture. I also, did not bake this pie.

I've ate a lot of Banana Cream Pies but I have never made a pie before until today. I was very nervous on how this would turn out since everything is from scratch and I have never made pudding either. I mostly followed the recipe to the T but I put cornstarch instead of flour (since many reviewers said there pies did not turn out when they used flour) . I used a nilla wafer crust (which one reviewer suggested)..I also didn't bake the pie (since more than 5 reviewers said there pies turned out very tough and rubbery on top when the baked it) I put Saran Wrap on top and put it in the fridge for 2 hours. I made sweetened whipped cream (from this site) and spooned it on top of the pie before I served it to my guests. It turned out good. It was not runny and the only complaint my guests had was it was not sweet enough. I thought it was nice and I think the longer it sits in the fridge the better it will be.. I will try my theory out tomorrow :)

Amazing recipe! I loved it so much I decided to make a second pie as well. I did follow other's suggestions. I used cornstarch instead of flour. I did not bake the pie. I never had any problems with the pie being runny. I used 2 percent milk for one pie and whole milk for the other.

I've made a better banana cream pie before but can't find the recipe. I was hoping this one would be comparable and its good but not fantastic. And, the recipe says to bake for 15 minutes which I thought completely wacky for a cream pie!  I read some of the reviews that said not to bake.  Everything is already cooked, that does not make any sense! Also, I typically mix the bananas into the custard and this one says to lay at bottom of crust and pour custard over, which I did.  I prefer to mix the bananas into the custard.

This was awesome! We had it last night with Christmas dinner and it was thoroughly enjoyed by all.  I used 2 large bananas - one on the bottom, topped with half the pudding, another layer of banana, and then the rest of the pudding. Whole thing topped with homemade whipped cream - whipping cream, 3 Tbsp powdered sugar, and 1 tsp of vanilla beaten until it held it's peaks. Delicious!  I also used a different preparation technique. I put all of the ingredients except for the vanilla into a large microwave safe bowl and stirred until they were well combined. Then I microwaved it for one minute and pulled it out and whisked it for a few seconds. I repeated that process until my pudding thickened up (about 7 minutes). Incorporated the vanilla at the end. Came out beautifully. Thanks for the recipe! My husband may have a new favorite pie.

If you are having a problem with the banana turning brown, you have to use an acid of some sort like lemon juice or orange juice when you cut the banana.  And if it is too soupy, take some cornstarch, about 2 tbsp with a bit of cold water, and gradually stir it into the hot mixture to thicken it up.  That will cure the soupy!

Loved this! Pudding came out nice and thick, perfect consistency. To add more banana flavor to the pudding, I mashed one full banana and added it right before I put the pudding in the shell. 
One thing I have to say to all of you is DO NOT BAKE THIS PIE!!! Pudding pies are not to be baked! Just chill thoroughly and enjoy!
Delicious!

Very easy to make (providing you have a whisk and know how to make pudding).  Tasted delicious - it will be a favourite for guests.  Love the made-from-scratch pudding - so easy to make.  Always looking for food that doesn't contain any kind of artificial ingredients or man-made chemicals.

I was a tad skeptical, but WOW! This was phenomenal! I read many reviews and made just a couple minor tweaks. I used 4 TBSP cornstarch instead of flour, and I used 1 tsp pure vanilla extract and 1/4 tsp banana extract. I made fresh whipped cream and topped with almonds. It didn't last long at all. My husband ate half the pie the first night! yikes!

My family loved this recipe!  I used a crust that I made of 1 1/2 cup crushed Nilla wafers and 1/2 cup of butter.  I made a fresh whipped cream for the topping and it was just wonderful

Mind Blowing. I made this pie for a finisher for Easter dinner (we make a big deal out of it in my family). I did modify however: cut sugar to 1/2 cup, substitute 3 tbs ground tapioca (this requires priming in the milk at room temperature for 5-10 min) for the flour/cornstarch, and substitute 1/3 cup of the whole milk for cream. I had thought about a rum syrup/glaze but this seemed decadent enough as it was. I used a simple crust of crushed graham crackers (14-16) and 1/2 stick (1/4 cup) butter-I added no sugar as this recipe is sweet enough as it is.

I made this using the 3 T corn starch option. I also put mine in a graham cracker crust. I did not follow the last step of putting it in the oven. It is not neccessary. Pour the filling into the crust and chill. I topped mine with cool whip and it set up nicely. For those that are getting a runny pie I could only think that maybe you aren't cooking it on the stove top long enough. I have had that problem before. It should be thick when you pour it in the crust and thicken more upon chilling.

I've made this pie twice, once with the flour, it was runny and you could taste the flour, second time with the cornstarch; wonderful. Also I didn't bake it., just the pie shell.

Made this on 3/19/11.  I would have made 1/3 more pudding as I would like a bit more pudding in the pie.  I used 3 medium bananas.  Other than that is was great.   Oh...and do not bake the pie after filling except to brown the meringue. I used 4 eggs instead of 3 in the pie and I used the 4 egg whites to make meringue with 6 Tbsp sugar.  Then browned in oven at 425 for about 5 minutes.

Meh.  I won't be using this recipe again.  It wasn't soup for me like some have said, but it was very liquidy and spread out after a slice had been cut.  Still ate it like pudding but then it seemed to leave a gritty feel in my mouth.

Amazing. Followed as directed and it came out just perfect. I did add an extra bannana as I like more fruit. I cheated with a Pillsbury Crust, it has already been requested again

I am only giving this one star because the recipe fails to tell you to cook the pudding mixture until thickened. For this reason.... my pie never set! It stayed soupy. The flavor was very good, a bit on the overly sweet side though... but I may try this recipe out again after now knowing what to do and not to do now.

This is a great recipe!  I doubled it and made 2 small pies and a normal size pie.  I did take the advice of one review and crushed 1 1/2 C vanilla wafers with 6 Tablespoons butter and baked for 5 min at 350 then added the rest of ingredients on top.  I put lemon over the bananas so they would not turn brown and made sure I covered all with pudding.  The vanilla pudding is delish!  The only thing I changed was corn starch for flour.  Easy to make...just make sure you whisk pudding while cooking so it stays smooth and doesn't stick.  My grandson loves dessert!!

Made this (but skipped step #4 baking at the end, which I've never tried with any other banana cream pie recipes) and it turned out great!  Recipe was easy to follow and the filling was nice and firm, not runny.

The filling will not be runny if you use 2% milk and really take your time stirring in the two cups of milk. I really added the milk slowly while the mixture was on medium high heat and it thickened up really well. No cornstarch needed with this recipe if you use fattier milk and take your time.

I made some simple changes to make the recipe easier and lessen the chance of soupy-ness. It also adds a ton of calories and fat, I'm sure, but it's a dessert...who cares??  I used 1/2 cup sugar, 1/4 cup cornstarch, 1/4 t. salt, 2 cups HALF and HALF, 2 eggs, 2 T butter, and 1/4 t. vanilla. In a saucepan, I combined the sugar, cornstarch, salt, 1/2 & 1/2, and eggs, and brough the mixture to a boil over low heat, stirring constantly. I removed from heat, and added the butter and vanilla, and then folded the banana directly into the pudding and filled the pie. Chilled for a couple of hours, and topped with real whiped cream (no Cool-Whip, please!!) and sliced almonds.   AMAZING and super simple.

Very good pie and very easy to make. I followed what some others have said and used 3 tbs of cornstarch and added enough flour to make 1/3 cup. I also added a mashed banana (mixed with a bit of amaretto) to the pudding mix. I decided to make an extra thick graham cracker crust, and after layering it with the banana slices, I placed a layer of toasted coconut on them, then more on top of the pie to finish. If your pie was runny, it means you didn't cook it long enough on the stove. You must keep it on heat until it is thickened. I also did not put the pie in the oven, it didn't need it. I then popped it in the fridge.  Love this pie!

Ok, so I had to edit this review. My friends and I ate the pie that night and it was good. The next day and the day after? It was great. So, if you want to impress people with this pie, make it the day before and let it sit overnight. I'm making this again soon.

This was a big hit at work. Although be forewarned: you must use whole milk with this recipe otherwise it will not set firmly. People loved the flavor it was just runny as heck. I used a ready-made graham cracker crust. I also firmed up some whipped topping with 2 tbsp of piping gel per cup to get that awesome professional-looking border. They actually thought I bought the pie!

This was excellent.  I had no trouble with it what so ever.  I followed the recipe and instructions exactly except I didn't bake it.  It was perfect and the pudding was the right consistency as soon as it was finished cooking.  I did put the banana's in lemon juice as I thought that was just common sense whenever you use banana's in a recipe.  My pie was perfect and I got many compliments on it.

This is one of the best banana cream pies I have ever made. DO NOT BAKE THIS PIE!!! It sets up perfectly fine in the fridge. I used 5 bananas, two I used to layer the crust, the other three I folded into the pudding mixture. I made this for thanksgiving, and I should have made two. I didn't even get a piece and everybody was asking if I had made another!!!

This turned out beautifully. I used 3 T. cornstarch in place of the flour and added 1/2 C. of coconut to the filling after cooking it.  The only thing I would do differently the next time I make this is I would slice 1 banana on the bottom of the crust, then I would add the rest of the banana slices to the filling before I pour it into the pan, the filling did not go all the way down to the bottom as I would have liked.

Ohhhhh I loved it. The best pie and it's texture is great, the taste feels so good in your mouth I wish I can eat it all day. I did not bake it and I read some reviews: Some really good advice: "1) use less sugar - 1/2 cup, 2) not to bake, 3) use corn starh instead of flour, and 4) CHILL extensively." ALSO: I will try to do what kate reccomended next time, "The best crust for this pie, btw, is a vanilla wafer crust. Just mix 1-1/2 c crushed vanilla wafers w/6 T melted butter and bake for 5 mins at 350. Really sets off the banana pie!" I actually used one banana that was required in the recipe and mushed-and spread it on the crust before I put the filling of pie. Can't wait to do again.

I really was excited about this recipe and was extremely disappointed!!!  All this tasted like was really really rich vanilla pudding pie with some bananas.  I might as well just go get instant banana pudding instead.  :(

This recipe has great flavor! I've made it a few times now, and the results have been great each time. I use 3-4 T of cornstarch in lieu of the flour, and skip the baking at the end. I also use a graham crust instead of pastry. Recommended!

Made this as a dessert for a Sunday family lunch. It was a big hit! The only thing I did different was to add strawberries and bananas and didn't bake it. Thanks so much for the recipe, will def make again.

Yum, yum, YUMMY!!! Follow the hint at the top of the recipe and use corn starch-keep stirring until your arm feels like it's ready to fall off-and you won't be able to keep your face out of the pot that you are stirring. The custard is heavenly, and the whole pie is just...well, WHEW. This went quick when I made it, and will join my collection of "standards" to make!! YUM!!!

I didn't bake it. used 1/2 cup sugar instead of using 3/4cup.
Also topped with whipped cream, ummmm!!
I will make it sometimes soon again.

I also made this with the suggestion of the 3 Tbsp of cornstarch.  The pudding turned out perfect, I also tempered the egg/sugar/cornstarch mixture.  I made meringe instead of the whip cream.  Don't quite understand why the recipe calls to put the pie in the oven without the meringe

I followed the reviews of many and thought it was yummy but wasn't sure if it was it!!!  I utilized a pillsbury crust which I baked.  When making the pie, I used flour and some cornstarch for I was in fear of a runny pie as per some reviews.  I also used some real vanilla bean for it adds such a genuine flavor.  I bought a bunch off of ebay as it is much cheaper then in the store.  I also added a dash of Madagascar Vanilla Extract.  The pudding came out nice and thick.  I then took a small amount of pudding and mixed with bananas as it was noted this will keep bananas from turning brown.  I layered this on bottom of crust and followed with the remaining pudding.  I did not bake the pie and it was perfect.  I placed in the fridge and had a few hours later and covered with whipped cream.

Very good. The pudding turned out very sweet, but it was excellent. I made this for my Dad (it's his favorite pie) and he loved it as well. I was a little nervous with some reviewers saying that it was runny, but I cooked it extra long to ensure and I used cornstarch vs. flour for a better taste. Thanks!

This is by far the best banana cream pie recipe I have ever tried.  After reading several other reviews, I decided to 1/6 cup flour and 1/6 cornstarch in place of 1/3 cup flour.  Instead of layering the bananas on top of my pie crust and then adding the custard, I folded the bananas into the custard.  This is a delicious pie.  My whole family loved it.

SUPER easy -  I only put in abt 1/3 of a cup sugar and it STILL turned out great!  Custard was perfect and bananas made it sweet enough.  Will definitely try this one again! Oh, as others noted, I did not bake.

This was sooo easy and sooo delicious!  I took the advice from a few reviews and it turned out great!  I only had flour, so I made sure the 1/3c. was packed as other suggested.  I also only had 1% milk, but I had a little heavy whipping cream left over from another recipe. I used 3/4 c. cream and the rest 1% milk.  I folded in 3 thinly sliced bananas and did NOT bake it.  It set up wonderfully. Nice and creamy! I topped it off with a thin layer of cool whip and it was gone in a few minutes!  I will never use another recipe.  This is the one!!!!

I made this pie for Thanksgiving this year. It was a big hit!! Everybody loved it. I found other peoples suggestions helpful.  I substituted half the flour for corn starch.  The cream turned out perfect.  I also added another layer of bananas between the pie filling and the whipped cream.  Right before serving 
I sliced up some fresh banana and used it for garnish.  I also drizzled a small amount of chocolate syrup on top for garnish and looks.  YUMMY!!!  I will use this recipe many more times.

I will use this recipe again, but it was too runny.  Next time I will increase the flour by a couple of tablespoons and decrease the milk by 1/4 c.  Otherwise, everyone said the flavor was great!

Tried this recipe after reading some current reviews. I did use the corn starch as recommended and the pie turned out perfect! Next time I wouldn't dip banana's in lemon juice as we did taste the lemon flavor; not bad just wouldn't do it again, plus the banana's still turned brown. This is definitely a keeper recipe! Thanks for sharing, Ruby!

This is great! You can use only 2 bananas sliced in the bottom and all the pudding or all 4 bananas and less pudding (I don't think it all fits). Whipped cream on top is the best! Lots of stirring, but it's worth it. This is our family's favorite pie on Thanksgiving day!

I don't know.  This didn't really thrill me.  Making the pudding from scratch was awesome, the warm left over pudding got devoured by myself and my 5 year old son, and it tasted so good that my expectations were very high.  That part I will make again, alone, as a warm pudding dessert.  After chilling though, the pie tasted only ok (maybe custard's not my thing?) and I think what really bothered me was the top, I mean custard just doesn't do well as a top, it sort of starts to dry out and get a little gooey and darker and tough even after just 15 minutes in the oven and a couple of hours in the fridge.  I think what I really prefer on a banana cream pie is a meringue sort of top.  That would have been a lot better.  Or a whipped sort of light custard filling.  I'll keep searching...

Whole milk is the key.  I also packed down the flour when measuring.  Made 4 of them today, all of them turned out great.

OUTSTANDING!  Even better than Grandma's!  My wife, who doesn't like Cream Pies, ate three slices that day, and said she would eat this one again.  By the way, I used all the sugar, cornstarch instead of flour, I baked it, and topped it with meringue (it's not a real banana cream pie without it).  I've not tried it unbaked, but can't imagine that would be any good.  Been baking pies for 30 years, not stopping now...

I think this is the best dessert I've ever made.  I used cornstarch and didn't bake it.  I added some whipped cream, chopped walnuts, and chocolate curls on top.  My family devoured it in less than 15 minutes.

This pie did not look nor taste like banana cream pie.  I decided not to serve it for the occasional for which it was originally intended.  Instead, I brought it to work, so that it didn't go to waste, and it was the topic of many jokes.  Most people said that it was 'ok', but it didn't taste at all like banana cream pie.  It was more like bananas in a crust with banana pudding on top.

We didn't think this pie had a strong enough banana flavour, found it to be bland.  I may make it again and add banana extract or pureed bananas for the filling.

I made a triple-batch (3 pies) and they came out beautifully! Delicious pudding, great instructions. I did use cornstarch. Remember to temper the eggs like the recipe says (add a bit of hot mixture to the eggs) or they will "scramble" when added to the mixture. I did reduce the sugar from 2 1/4 to 2 cups when making three pies.  Thanks for posting this recipe!

Mine was also  runny what the recipe fails to say is that once you add milk you whisk it until it gets THICK & bubbly like if it was lava. When you whisk it creates bubbles so that's when I stopped and didn't wait for it to thicken was very runny and had a lot of pudding mix left over will try it again and add cornstarch instead as many of other reviews suggested . Was also just told by aunt that I have to whisk it for a good 10 to 15 min in low heat before it thickens if that helps

I made this last night. It was a hit!!! After reading the reviews,  I used 3 tbsps cornstarch instead of flour and did not bake the pie.  It was fantastic.  I cooked the mixture on the stove top until it was very thick and bubbly. No problems with it being soupy.  Thank you for the recipe!

It's a keeper! When I first read the reviews, I thought "Oh no, everyone is all over the place on this one." Even the submitter wrote flour in the recipe and at the bottom of the recipe a footnote says she really uses cornstarch! Why not just say cornstarch? Oh, what to do? I decide to follow the recipe but not bake it at all. Good choice! It was excellent. *I'm editing already. I would suggest you serve real whip cream on the side, otherwise it only takes a few minutes for it to start running all over the place. Cool-whip won't do that but a lot of people prefer real whipped cream. Thank you so much Ruby.

This recipe is absolutely fantastic! Be patient with the pudding, give it time to thicken up and don't stop stirring. You will not be disappointed. As others suggest, do NOT bake. I also added 1/2tsp of banana extract and used frozen cool whip to top it all off. This is definitely a favourite go to recipe.

I was going to use cornstarch because it was so highly recommended in the user reviews but I didn't have any, So I used flour and it still came out smooth and delicious. Oh and plz make sure you consistently stir the mixture while cooking it. It does take longer then 5 mins though. I think it was more like 12 mins. Oh and to make sure its not soupy or runny cook mixture till it looks like pudding. Another thing make sure mixture is cooled before putting it in the crust. Oh and I stirred in half of a banana into the custard mixture, which I think made it even more delicious. Oh and plz use homemade whip cream. It's so simple , just use 2 cups heavy whipping cream , use an electric mixer. Mix on high till the cream is thick and looks like cool whip. Then you can mix in 2 to 3 tablespoons of confectioners sugar. I like mine sweet.  I will be using this recipe from now on.

Like everyone else, I used cornstarch to prepare the pudding, not flour. I also only added 1/2 cup sugar as we don't like things too sweet in our house. Otherwise, I followed the recipe as is and it was pretty good. Personally, I think it tasted too strong of vanilla - but that is more of a personal preference thing. Otherwise, everything came together great and my family enjoyed the pie. I did follow someone's tip to dip the bananas in lemon juice (which I diluted in club soda as I thought it would make the banana too lemony!) - I think that should be an added step in this recipe; oh and I didn't bake it! That is the main reason I'm taking off a star - banana cream pie should not be baked and that just sounds like a disaster.

Very creamy ! I added  2 additional tsp of cornstarch just to make sure it will set solid. Make sure to chill overnight and this will be addictive indulgence for any occasion ! I also use Graham pre-baked crust and that was so yummy ! THanks for such awesome recipe !! I'm thinking of other exotic fruits to be made into pies. Hope someone has some suggestions.

Maybe I should even review this recipe, since I haven't eaten the pie yet. I can't. Its so runny, it looks like soup. I'm not even sure I'll try it because it looks disgusting. What did I do wrong? WHY is this pie so runnY??
=> I would suggest to use cornstarch added to your hot mix. Also, do not eat right away...let it cool, then refrigerate it over night !

First I have to address Patti and other who review BEFORE they try the recipe - it is so unfair to the author and to others who rely on the rating system to give a bad rating to a recipe you haven't even tried, just based on your perception of what a recipe will turn out like. Please, if you want to review a recipe, try it yourself first THEN give your thoughts and opinions.
As for my thoughts on this recipe, I loved it! You MUST use 2% milk or whole milk, it simply will not turn out if you use 1%, skim, almond milk, soy milk, etc. Those who found it 'soupy' almost certainly tried to make it healthier by using one of these types of milk and you just can't. I also used corn starch in place of the flour and did NOT bake it.  So give this recipe a try - it's super delicious! But use the proper ingredients to get these great results.

LOVED IT!!! turned out great!!! easy to make!! i only suggest letting people know to have all your prep work done prior to starting . ( having the banana already sliced and put on pie crust. Butter melted) Also i used Vanilla Wafers for the crust and made mini banana cream cupcakes instead it turned out GREAT!!!!! that way I could give them away to more people and no hassle or mess :)

Like the other reviewers suggested, I did not bake the pie and the texture came out wonderfully.  I added a top layer of homemade whipped cream and some freshly toasted coconut then garnished with raspberries, blackberries, and strawberries.  The toasted coconut made it amazing!  Especially because the pudding had less flavor than anticipated (even after adding extra vanilla).  Perhaps next time I will cook bananas or a banana liquor into the pudding instead of just layering the two.  The stoners in my family devoured it in one night.

I followed all the steps exactly and also used corn starch instead of flour. The pie came out perfect and the vanilla pudding by itself was to die for, could be eaten by itself, no pie around it needed ;) 

I also used CARTHECOOK's idea of using the 3 whites for meringue (I would have had omelette for dinner, otherwise), but only using vanilla, no extra sugar. 

Then I baked the plain cream pie for 5min and after adding the meringue, baked the whole thing for another 9min. And I added a bit of milk chocolate, just on top of the banana slices and a bit on top for decoration (post-baking).

This did NOT set. Followed directions exactly. It was pudding/soup. While it tasted good, it was not pie. If I try it again I may add corn starch as others suggested.

This was wonderful, wonderful, wonderful! Everyone loved it. If your having a problem with it too thin just add 4 heaping Tablespoons of flour. I do this with my chocolate pies too and it comes out just right. Thanks for sharing your recipe. I added a pic of mine

Yum!  This was a big hit at my house.  I had no trouble with the pudding setting up.  I did use non-fat milk, but I added a little bit of heavy whipping cream to the measuring cup before adding the milk.  I had the whipping cream on hand for something else, but I knew I had to use it which is why I chose this recipe.  Well, that and the bananas turning brown in my fruit bowl!  Delicious recipe!

I pretty much followed this recipe as written...I only used 1/2 cup of sugar and I did not bake the pie and it turned out Great.  As a previous reviewer suggested, you may want to read up on how to beat egg yolks (appx 5 min) and you want to make sure to fully cook and constantly stir the FLOUR mixture.  
This was my first cream pie and I am glad I chose this recipe!

Delicious! The only reason I've given four stars instead of five (really it's a 4.5 for me) was that the pudding mixture didn't set firmly even after two days in the fridge. I used the 3 tbsp cornstarch instead of the flour, 4 tbsp might be better, if you're wanted to properly slice the pie into pieces; for me they didn't stay together and ran all over the plate. The taste was amazing though, I would make it again just to eat as pudding! I made a Nilla wafer crust and used strawberry slices on top of the crust because I didn't have usable bananas. They really worked with the pudding though! I also spread whipped topping on top. It was very good and I will definitely make it again, but will try to make the pudding more firm. It was pretty quick and simple to make too, not much longer than using pudding mix.

I made this pie for Thanksgiving and my family LOVED it! They were wondering why I only brought one pie! I had another in the fridge to take to my in-laws and they wanted to eat that one too!! I managed to protect the second pie, but promised I would make it again. I think I want to add strawberries next time! Yummy!!

If I could choose stars in the negative I would. Every recipe on here I've been able to create. This is by far the worst recipe. I followed the instructions down to the seconds. Spent 2 hours in my kitchen and all I got a thin soupy concoction. I thought maybe it needed more time to cool than what's stated so I refrigerated over night. Nope still the same. Don't waste your time and ingredients.

This is a delicious pudding  recipe.  Not too sweet, just the right amount.  I followed the directions to the 'T', and it came out perfectly.  I am a beginning baker, and I found this recipe perfectly suited for my skill set.  It's chilling in the fridge right now, can't wait to try it!!

This pie was de-lish! I asked my husband what he thought and he said he loved it and then I asked him if he could change anything about it, he said "nothing". :) I followed the recipe exactly except I used half sugar/half splenda. It did not come out soupy. I used skim milk. And I chose to bake it to the max suggested (15mins). I topped it with lite whipped topping. The next time around, I will bake it for half the time. I got the skin others talked about, it didn't ruin the pie but I want to try avoiding that. Plus, I will use all splenda next time and maybe 1/2 a cup only as others suggested. I will also make my own crust cus I bought a premade crust and it kinda sucked. The pudding on this pie was yummy and my bananas didn't brown! :)

This was good but I think I'll do some "tweaking" if I make it again.  I didn't really like the texture of the custard or the way it just sat on top of the bananas.  I would prefer the bananas mixed in and the custard to be a bit less gelatinous - but that's just personal preference.  The taste of this pie is quite good - just not really what I had in mind for a banana cream pie.

Absolutely perfect!  It would only be soupy if you didn't cook the custard long enough.  Mine was the perfect texture and the flavor was right on.  YUM!

This recipe should have all 5 stars! People whose came out runny, like others have said, you must not have cooked it long enough. Cook it in a more shallow pan and it will take less time to bubble, less time and thicker. i also brushed a lil beaten egg with milk over my crust and baked it til the crust was nice and brown with no crumbles. When I put the banans on the bottom of the pan, i sprinkled them with sugar. Folded more bananas into the pudding mix before scooping it into the crust. Some people said bake, others said just chill so I baked at 325 for about 5 monutes. Lastly, after it was all spread out and baked, i sprinkled powdered sugar on the top and then serve with whip cream mm.

This recipe is awesome!  The only change I made was to not bake.  Otherwise, prepare as is, refrigerate, and top with Cool Whip (lite).  Just remember to bake the pie crust before starting the pudding allowing time to cool.  I always forget, and it adds time to what should be a quick and easy process.

As much as I would like to give this recipe more stars, I simply cannot because of the instructions. This pie should NOT be baked.  I wish I would have read the reviews prior to sticking mine in the oven.  My custard was thick and delicious prior to baking.  It then developed a thick skin and is SOUPY and RUNNY after being in the oven.  This was not the case prior to baking.  I can't give more stars for this awful instructions!  Take baking out of the recipe.  It is not needed!  The flavor was good.

Excellent recipe, sub'd 1/4 cup corn starch to flour.  Also, once in a while ill add a banana to the milk for the custard and blend it on high for a bit.  That gives you double banana cream pie.  Straight up though is fantastic as well

I followed the recipe, with exception to baking it at the end. The pie came out PERFECT.  It was NOT runny at all.  The flavor was just right. Not extreemly sweet either.  When I had it on the stove I made sure it was to a boil, then I cooked it 2 more minutes as the instructions indicate.  At that point it should be pretty darn thick, like a custard.  If not keep it there a minute longer (stir, stir, stir). After I added some hot ingredients to the eggs little at a time (stir, stir, stir) I added it to the pot again (stir, stir,stir) for I would say 2.5 minutes.  I wanted to make sure the eggs were cooked because I was not going to bake at the end (following a reviewers suggestions). I topped it with a whip cream recipe off this site.  It was a hit with the pickiest dessert eaters!

I am by no means a baker, cooking is my deal. I only tried this because of a bunch of bananas were given to me. It was not only an easy recipe, it was absolutely delicious...followed exact directions-with perfect results! Thank you for posting this wonderful recipe.

As suggested, I subbed cornstarch for the flour and used 1 cup half-and-half and 1 cup 2% milk. The pudding thickened and was very tasty so I thought I had a winner when I put it in the fridge to set. Wrong. It was in there for 3 hours and still came out runny. We ate the pie out of bowls. No complaints on the taste but the presentation left much to be desired! I wish I knew what went wrong.....

Holy cow!  This recipe rocks!  The consistency of the custard is just right.  The taste is great and not too sweet.  I added a layer of melted chocolate on the crust before placing the bananas and custard on top.  My pan was a little small so I only used 2 bananas and half the custard.  More left for a second pie!

This recipe overall is alright. Made a meringue with the left over egg whites, and it worked well for a topping. My only issue with this recipe is that the bananas started turning brown very shortly after cutting into the pie. The first day after making it, the pie tasted great, but after that it just wasn't appetizing.  Might recommend using a different fruit next time.

Very excellent recipe.  Pretty simple and produces a great tasting pie.  I bake mine for a mere 7 minutes and it creates a very good consistency of the pudding.  Remember to use over ripened bananas (have some dark brown on edges) these are more mushy and bring out the best banana flavor!

Absolutly devine! my only issue is that it took all night to set and even then i had to put it in the freezer for most the night, but even not set it tastes soooo good, i caught my fiancee taking a spoon to it and he's very very picky about his pie lol. the only thing i changed was that i didn't have any pie tins so i used a 9x9x2 baking pan.

Like other reviewers, I didn't bake and I see no reason to.  The pudding should be as "set" as it's going to be when you put it in the fridge.  If it's soupy, you're not done cooking it!  It took me about 10 minutes to get the right consistency.  I also used a graham cracker crust.  I used the flour in the recipe along with 1 tbsp cornstarch.  Great recipe, will make again but will reduce the sugar - WAY too sweet!  I also topped with whipped cream, which I absolutely recommend.  It's not complete without it.

Pretty easy but thought my arm was going to fall off from the constant stirring. Only change was to doubled the vanilla.  I did the cookie crust recommended by others.

Excellent!!  This was the best banana cream pie I have ever had.  For those that said the filling was too runny, you need to cook it longer!  It thickens up the longer you cook it.

I followed the directions exactly and was plesantly surprised at the results. Thanksgiving desssert was a hit thanks to this pie. The custard/pudding middle is DELICIOUS. I made stabilized whipped cream to top it - PERFECT.  Thanks for the great directions - I've never made a cream pie (or homemade pudding) and everything went perfectly!

I love, love, love this recipe!!! It never fails and I only make 2 tiny alterations...use only 1/2 C of sugar and around 1 T of butter. If everything is prepped before hand there will never be lumps in your pudding...Oh, and I don't bake it...I let it chill on the counter for a smidge then throw it in the fridge and it's ready in a couple hours. Seriously, it's hands down the best 'nanna cream pie recipe I have ever found.

The first time I made this pie, I used flour and didn't let the custard cook long enough to thicken. This time it was perfect - you just have to be patient and wait for the thickening - no perfect set amount of time. My hubby said it was the best pie he's ever tasted!

The only thing I would change is to pour half the custard and add another banana layer and then pour the rest of the custard.  I also cut the sugar to a little less than 1/2 cup and it was still very sweet.  A tasty tasty treat.

Made it again and it's great! I think the problem with my first one (and other people's pie) is that I didn't cook the custard long enough. I expected it to thicken in the fridge...NOT the case. I had to cook it while stirring for 10-15 minutes for it to thicken. It should really say that in the directions! Also I didn't bake it. 
Next time I wanna try banana liqueur in it.

Was looking for a sweet pie recipe so I chose this one and it came out very tasty! It's more of a custard pie as opposed to a cream one but it all works well together and the custard alone is delicious. I used half cornstarch/half flour but it was still a touch too runny so next time I'd use 3/4 cornstarch and 1/4 flour. Also drizzle the bananas with lemon juice and mix them in with the custard otherwise they go brown real quick. I don't like wasting food so whisked up the egg whites with some sugar and piped on top for the perfect finish.

This was a great starter recipe; we jazzed it up with a melted chocolate layer that made it Banana’tastic!

Sooo good. I fried up the bananas in caramelized brown sugar and it was absolutely divine.

Be sure to use whole milk, not 2% or Skim.  Mine used to be soupy as well, until I found out that whole milk makes the difference.

great custard filling but bananas were not just brown, but black.  Should I have soaked in lemon juice or does cooking just cause this anyway?  So, I'll give 4 stars since it was great if you didn't look at the black bananas:-)

Absolutely delish! Never made a pie from scratch before and was a little nervous. But, I followed the recipe to a "T" and it was perfect. Great job Ruby. Thanks for sharing. Will make again since it was a hit with my family..

oh my goodness!  DELICIOUS! The only change I made was substitute milk for equal parts heavy cream and fat free half and half.  Used3 tblsp cornstarch, no baking.  This was so good!  Set up perfectly.  As a first time pudding maker - I knew right away when it was done cooking - it gets thick.  Do not pour into pir shell until it is visibly thick.  YUM!

I made this exactly as per recipe and added a tad bit more vanilla,  it was fantastic. You definitely have to cook it for a while on the stove top to thicken the pudding. It was a huge hit in our family.

Love this pie.  The filling should be thick before you pour it into the shell.  If not, you've mixed something wrong.  I use cornstarch instead of flour.  I've been looking for a recipe like this for 20 years, trying to replicate one my grandmother made... this is it!

Great pudding recipe!  I didn't bake the pie, following other reviews.  Sliced the bananas and mixed them into the pudding.  Topped with toasted coconut.  I will use this base for other puddings.  Very good!

I've never made homemade pudding before so the first time I made it, it was very runny. This was extremely upsetting. It does not say in the instructions to let it thicken on the stove which would have been helpful for a first-timer! This is why I'm giving it 3 stars. However when I re-made it, it was deliciously awesome!

Now maybe I shouldn't give it 5 stars because I didn't follow the recipe exactly. But the basic recipe plus reading through the comments here makes an excellent pie! Changes - half & half instead of milk. Used a combo of flour and cornstarch. I had the heat a bit higher than medium. And I didn't bake it. It's delicious and oh so rich! This pie lasted less than 24 hours in my home (and there are only 2 of us!) If you mess this up, it's definitely a user-error! Hint - you have to stir and stir forever. Just when you think you must be doing something wrong and you're about to quit, the mixture magically thickens up and starts bubbling. Don't give up! It's worth it.

Great pie!  I used 2/3 cup sugar instead of 3/4 cup and 1/3 cup cornstarch instead of flour; that really thickens it up.  I used skim milk with no problems.  To avoid getting a skin on the pudding, top the whole pie with cool whip or whipped cream when the pudding has cooled a bit.

The taste of this pie was delicious! I agree with some of the reviews that the pie did not have a very firm consistency, but most of the banana cream pies I've had have had the "pudding" consistency this pie has. It was still sooooo good. I garnished it with whip cream and sliced almonds. It still was a hit. I got so many compliments on how good the pie was. I will make it again for sure.

This truly is one the tastiest pies I've ever tasted or baked. I took the advice of another member and used the Nilla wafer/melted butter crust instead of a traditional pastry crust, and that is what put this pie over the edge. I also put a layer of whipped cream over the pudding instead of dolloping it on top. Also, I did NOT bake the pie as was suggested, and this was great advice. It came out FANTASTIC- no negative results to report here!

This was my first time making a pie, and I chose banana cream pie because it is my absolute favorite! This was very easy to make and I was a little nervous at first, especially after reading some of the reviews, but when I took my first bite I was amazed. It is so good! I couldn't be more proud. I only give this 4 stars, because I did not follow the recipe completely. I used 1/2 cup of sugar, 1/6 cup flour, 1/6 cup cornstarch, 1 teaspoon banana extract, 1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract, I used 1% milk with a little half and half, 2 bananas mashed into the filling, and one banana sliced and layered on the crust (I used graham cracker crust). I did NOT bake this pie. I didn't have any problems with the pie setting. It was the perfect thickness and came out just like a pie should. I recommend playing around with the ingredient rations before you give up on this pie. Everyone likes their pie a certain way, and I am sure you can make this pie work for you.

I have never made banana cream pie and when a friend asked for one for his birthday I thought I would give it a try. It turned out amazing and everyone loved it. After I cooked the pie, I let it cool for over an hour and added whip cream to the top and then chilled it again for 3 more hours. It definitely needs to chill for more than hour. The key to making the pudding part is the stirring, it is not lying about constantly stirring.

This did not turn out for me at all!  The pudding mixture was really thick and never really got smooth.  I could have done something wrong, but I'm pretty good at following directions.  If I try it again, I will update my review, but for now, I wouldn't recommend this recipe.

Delicious!  I gave this 5 stars with the following modifications: Used 1/2 cup of white sugar and used flour & corn starch equally measured in the 1/3 cup.  You need to use whole milk -- anything less than that will make it runny and it won't set right.  Make sure the bananas are very ripe for the full banana flavor.  Cook the filling so that it turns out like custard.  I cut up the bananas and put them in the custard. I baked the pie as directed and it turned out the perfect consistency! Also was very happy with the "Easy Pie Crust" recipe from this site & got many compliments on this crust!  I used the "Whipped Cream" recipe from this site & it was very good on top of the pie.

This pie is fabulous! I planned to use whole milk based on reviewer tips but forgot and used 1/2% instead.  It might've taken a bit longer to cook, but the filling came out nice and thick.  I also followed reviewer advice and didn't bake the pie; I just chilled it after filling the pie shell.

only 4 stars because I followed recipe EXACTLY and got a soupy brown banana mess! We still ate it because the flavor is AMAZING and WAY better than using pudding! Recipe needs changing to use CORN STARCH not flour, AND put a little lemon juice on bananas to keep from browning~~ DO NOT FOLLOW RECIPE as I did!!BUT...do make this pie, using the alterations above and you will NOT be disappointed!

Excellent recipe.  I followed it exactly with cornstarch instead of flour, and as I only had 1 1/2 % milk I used 1 1/2 cups of that and 1/2 cup of half and half.  Came ourt perfect.  I think next time I will add just a nip of Dark Spiced Rum.  One for the pie.....One for the cook.......

This recipe is great; although, since my family chooses not to eat sugar, I subed out the sugar for Agave necter. Also, I used the flour and 1Tlb of cornstarch. I boiled it stirring constantly untill thick. I did not bake it at all, and it turned out perfect first try! Whipped Cream for topping and Gram crust. Great Thanksgiving pie! Will definately be a family favorite...

Fantastic!!! I am not a pie maker but with the right pie crust this pie by far was one of the better pies I have tasted. I actually added a bit of coconut and as long as you don't over cook the pudding it is the BEST!!

Did not go over very well at a barbeque. It was just not that good. I made 2 pies and ended up throwing a whole pie away.

This was SO good. I can't even put it into words. I let it cool for 2 hours and it had firmed up just fine, but I used corn starch instead of flour, so maybe anyone who had trouble with thickening, could try that?

YUMMY! The flavor of the filling is superb! MUCH better than pudding mix- by far! I did use 3 tbsp cornstarch instead of flour and did not bake, as suggested. You CANNOT beat the flavor of this! Perfection! Thanks for the great recipe - it's my husbands favorite pie!

I did everything the other reviewers suggested: cornstarch instead of flour, didn't bake it, used less sugar, refrigerated it for over 24 hours...it never firmed up! The custard flavor was wonderful, but it never firmed up into custard consistency. I even compared it to my grandmother's custard recipes, and she also had no idea what went wrong.

This was excellent. The pudding mixture is simply the best. I prefer to make it all from scratch so I wanted a recipe that did NOT call for a box of the vanilla pudding mix. That's a cop-out. This recipe is terrific and I made my own crust per another reviewer. Thanks so much!

I was looking for a banana creme pie as good as the one they serve at the local eatery, and this one is! DO NOT COOK THE FILLED PIE; step four should be to chill the pudding for 3-4 hours. Two small adjustments: my first two pies were runny so I added 1.5 TSP corn starch to thicken this time, and I mixed the sliced bananas in the pudding which flavor it better.

I didn't have any problems with "soupiness" as others may have.  I followed the recipe as written, no substitutions with mixtures of cornstarch, etc.  I think I may mash the bananas next time before putting into the crust... not sure how that will turn out, but the chilled banana slices (texturally) feels weird with all the pudding topping.  Other than that, really tasty pie!  And I've never made Banana Cream Pie before.

This was so tasty! I used 1/2 cup of sugar and next time I will cut the sugar back a little more. The natural sweetness of the ripe bananas made this pie pretty sweet. I took the advice of other reviews and didn't bake this pie. I used 3 tablespoons of cornstarch instead of the flour, I didn't want the flour taste in the pudding. When heating the milk mixture it took about 6-7 minutes on medium to set. I used a basic pie crust with half whole wheat pastry flour and all-purpose flour. I baked the pie shell and let it cool before putting the bananas and pudding in the pie shell.  Chilled overnight and ate this for breakfast with coffee.

This recipe is fabulous- I've made it twice, and it disappeared within seconds both times. Even my really picky boyfriend loves this pie! I followed other reviewer's recommendations: I used half flour and half corn starch (about 3 TBSP each), used 3 small bananas, didn't bake, and chilled overnight. The second time I made with storebought pie crust which was ok, but definitely better with homemade. Next time I will try with vanilla wafer crust. Thanks for this wonderful recipe!

This is so stinking good and so easy!  I think that people who say it is runny are not cooking it long enough.  You actually cook it more than 2 minutes and you stop cooking it when it gets thick like pudding after you you put in the egg mixture, and then it won't be so runny.  I only used 3 bananas and it was so good, that my husband practially ate it all in one day!!  Thanks for the recipe!

I tried your recipe with the added suggestion of one of your reviewers - I did not bake the finished pie. I prepared the recipe as stated, but rinsed my bananas in lemon water before putting them in the shell and served with fresh whipped cream topping. It was the best banana cream pie I have had in years! I will definitely make this one again.

I'm giving this pie 4 stars because It tasted great but didn't look great.  The pie was too runny ( I took the advice and didn't bake it) also the banana's turned brown even though I had them all buried in the pudding.  I couldn't keep my finger's out of the pudding, it was great!

Do not bake the pie, just refrigerate. Do not top with whipped cream until ready to serve. This way the pie won't get runny. My family loves this pie, and I've been making it for over 20 years.

My pie was excellent modified as follows: *I  made a pre-baked pie crust using butter *flour (not corn starch) *Silk brand soy milk in place of milk
*  cook in a double boiler (until thick and bubbly, it won't boil) *stir filling until cool *do not bake the pie

I made this for my boyfriend and his family.  Collectively, we decided four stars was the best and that : 1) The pie is very rich (a good thing), 2) The custard is very good, and 3) the Vanilla Wafer crust some reviewers recommended was NOT the way to go.  Graham cracker or just a plain pie shell would be preferred - I personally would just go with the plain considering the richness of the pie.  Things that worked well for me: 1) not baking the pie, 2) using 1/6 c. flour, 1/6 c. corn starch.  As soon as I switch the pie crust, I'm sure this recipe will be five stars.

I just made this recipe for the first time this Thanksgiving. It received rave reviews all around! I made the vanilla/butter crust, used cornstarch for 1/2 of the flour called for (making it 1/6 flour and 1/6 cornstartch). I reasoned that if the pie didin't really need baking, then why waist the time and heat? I merely placed the cooked pudding mixture into the baked pie crust and covered it and placed in the fridge til Thanksgiving, the next day. Then I put lots of Cool Whip on top and sprinkled some chocolate sprinkles all around. Pretty and delicious! Thank you for the recipe. Will be making it many more times in the future!

Very good basic cream pie recipe. I doubled it and made a coconut cream pie (see Coconut Cream Pie IV) also.  I made it with meringue.  I don't think using flour or cornstarch makes much of a difference.  I used half flour/cornstarch.  The most important thing is to use whole milk not low fat.  What is not to like!!!

Beautiful presentation. This was a perfect finish to our meal, a cool light dessert on a warm summer evening. This was so easy to make and  I had all ingredients already on hand. My DH and son loved this. Thanks for such an easy and wonderful dessert, Ruby, my family really loved this.

I have never made a cream pie before--and this one turned out PERFECT!  I did make a meringue with the leftover egg whites.  I didn't realize until after mixing up the crust and gathering ingredients that my pie pans were missing (we moved recently), so I made it in a round cake pan.  It still came out scrumptious!

Oh, and I followed the advice of another reviewer and packed the flour for measuring & wound up with PERFECT consistency.

wow! first time making a custard, and thought "bubbly" meant boiling, but once it started thickning I realized and added the yolks, turned out great! I only had 3 banana's and they were enough, and used a vanilla cookie crust, was good but will try a regular crust next time, and yes there will be a next time, fabulous recipe! Thanks!I want toi add to my original review: I have made this several times, if the bananas are too ripe the pie comes out runny.  i found a pastry pie crust to be the best way to make this! thanks again!!!

This was easy and presented a perfect pie. I split the difference and used 2T of flour and 2T of cornstarch.  I let it cool on the counter then refridgerated before serving.  My neighber described it as "heaven in a pieshell".

very delish.I did only use 1/2c. of sugar and 1 tbsp.Made a flaky crust two layers of bananas,didnt bake,made a heavy cream/pwdr sugar cream and wala.I think they only thing I want to try next time is to use only 1/4c cornstarch, I thought the 1/3c was just a tad to thick.I dont like runny pies but this was just a tad too thick.So I might lighten up on the corn starch.But as for flavor.Very good,not too sweet.Perfect.Thank you.Beats any pudding mix.(which is runny)

I am giving this 5 stars because the flavor was AWESOME!!!  I didn't put the pie in the oven per other reviews and instead let it set in the fridge.  It set well and I put a meringue on top.  When the pie warmed to room temp it fell apart.  Next time I will put it in the oven as the recipe suggests.  The meringue will cover up any film on top.  Either way it was yummy.  We even ate the "banana pie mush".  Thank you!!!!

Just delicious, everything you want in a Banana Cream Pie. If you follow the recipe it will come out fantastic. Just be sure to have all your ingredients measured and ready before you get started. Also be sure to stir constantly and cook thoroughly in order for the custard to thicken. I love cinnamon so I added a teaspoon. I doubled the recipe and on the suggestion of other used less sugar than the recipe called for (2 pies = 1 cup)I covered both crust completely with bananas(used 3 in each pie) then I added the remaining slices to the custard. After I filled the crust I also added 7 slices to the top. After refrigerating for a few hours I added some cool whip and a few sprinkles of cinnamon for appearance. This is a great recipe thanks! Oh, I agree, Nilla crust is the best for this pie.

I made a couple of changes - used 3 Tbsp of corn starch instead of flour, had only 2 large bananas and I simply chilled the pie once I added the pudding mixture.  I don't think cooking it would have added anything.
It turned out fantastic.  Very smooth and creamy.  Family loved it!

I was nervous to try this because of all of the reviews, however I followed everyones advice & it turned out PERFECT! Only use 1/2c sugar, Do NOT bake & you must stir constantly! Thanks for the tips. This turned out to be way more simple than planned. I will make it again for sure!!

I thought this was great!  I didn't need 4 bananas, actually I only used one and a half.  I also topped it with sweetened whip cream.

This pie had a great taste, but my pudding mixture was very thin. It never did set up. I followed the directions exactly, but even after cooking and referigerating overnight, they were still very soupy when I cut the pie. I used 2% milk, maybe this was the problem.My husband still ate almost a whole pie!

Great taste- but the color was a little off-putting. I've only had the pre-made pudding types before, so the grayish-yellow color freaked me out a bit. But, as the four stars indicate, it tasted AWESOME!

This was truly a disaster. After following the directions and stirring the custard, it was still thin as water. I proceeded to stir with the electric mixer, thinking I may have not stirred vigorously enough. It ended up being a semi-thick froth which eventually turned back into soup after pouring over crust. I tried the custard two times and had the same results. I would not recommend this because it seems that unless you have the perfect temp. and cook the perfect amount of time and stir just enough...it ends up a flop and the money spent for it goes down the drain.

This is a very delicious pie.  I'm not a big banana cream pie fan, my family is, and we all enjoyed it equally.  I had no problem with the filling not setting well, I used cornstarch instead of flour.  I made it for Thanksgiving last year and I intend to make it this year as well.  Everyone gobbled it down and I didn't find out if it tasted better the next day cause it was gone the first day!

This recipe was surprisingly wonderful.  When I made it though, it didn't set too well, but the taste was excellent.  I'll have to try again, and be a little more precise next time.  Thanks for the great recipe.

First, I’m a man who is just starting to cook, so take this review for what it’s worth. ??
It was easy to make and taste great! I used the cornstarch instead of the flour and it worked great. Next time I am going to double the pudding because it got lost between the bananas and wiped cream, and the pudding is too good for that to happen.  
There is it...my first review.

I did not make this pie, but obviously, THE DIRECTIONS ARE NOT IN THE CORRECT ORDER.  You do NOT bake a cream pie, you blind bake the pie crust, and that should be #1 in the directions!   (Notice how it states to pour the pudding into the "baked and cooled" pie shell????)

I learned too late (from another reviewer) DO NOT BAKE this pie! The crust is already baked and the filling is cooked as well. Plus you are baking the bananas and you don’t want to do that. I’m really not sure why that is even in the instructions.

This is a great recipe.  For those who had trouble with the pudding not thickening, it is because it did not cook long enough.  The initial pudding mixture cooked until thick and bubbly.  Remove from heat, pour some into the bowl of beaten egg yolks while whisking.  Then pour the mixture back into the pot while whisking and return to the heat and continue to whisk for about 2 more minutes.  Remove from heat and add the vanilla and butter.  It will set nicely

Easiest pie I've ever made.  (Besides cook and serve, which is totally cheating and doesn't even stack up.)  Definitely use 3 Tablespoons of cornstarch in place of the flour, use whole milk if you have it, and unless you want to ruin the pie, DO NOT BAKE IT!  I dowsed my 2 bananas on hand with lemon juice, and patted them dry before putting them on the bottom of the crust.  Crowd pleaser.

This turned out great. Today, Easter, is my first attempt at making this type of pie from scratch. I was surprised, even after reading the reviews at how easy it was to make. I only strayed from the recipe in that I used the corn starch suggestion instead of flour and I increased the amount of banana to five instead of four. I also stirred the sliced banana into the custard mixture instead of over it. I didn't bake the pie but put it straight into the fridge as most reviewers suggested. The filling was very thick and seemed to hold together well even while hot for me. I didn't have any "soupy" problems that some reviewers had. I tasted the filling before filling the crust. It was amazing even hot and I can't wait to serve it for dessert tonight!

Amazing cream pie! Makes a great cooked pudding or can add almost any fruit to this for a change up.

I made this pie exactly as presented and it came out perfectly. I made a butter crust for this one. The last step in baking the crust, I gave the crust a brush up with an egg white wash and baked it an additional 3 minutes to seal the crust. The result was a nice flaky crust with a fabulous banana cream filling. To obtain the best results do not omit baking the pie before chilling it in the fridge. I would guess that those who ended up with "runny" or "soupy" results did not cook the filling long enough to set up or chill in the refrigerator for the recommended time. Do that and you will have a winner.

So good. Made this for my wonderful neighbor who plowed my driveway - his favorite. Made two so we could try it too. Followed the recipe exactly except NO BAKING. Used a homemade crust. Doubled the recipe so I could have two pies.  Used a wooden spoon to stir the pudding. If you very slowly add the milk to the dry ingredients, you shouldn't have a problem with lumps. Keep the heat at no more than medium to avoid scorching. Also, 1 large banana per pie should be enough. I didn't put any on top because they get ugly quickly.  Used whipped topping. My neighbor just called to tell me it is the best banana cream pie he has ever had!

Yum! My first time making banana cream pie and my taste-testers loved it. It's a bit labor intensive making that pudding, and although I used whole milk and really stirred like the dickens to thicken it, the slices came out a total mess. It looked like banana pudding in a heap on our plates. Delicious though! Thanks for the tip to coat the banana pieces with lemon juice, by day 2 even the slices I placed on top of the pie had not browned. I made a graham cracker crust (so much more flavorful than a pastry crust) and topped with homemade whipped cream.

Using flour for thickener is not difficult. Just mix the sugar, salt, and flour until there are no lumps, and heat slowly gradually pouring milk in, and stirring a bunch. Oh and I made a meringue and baked it as well, til the meringue was toasty.

Made this per my boyfriend's request, he was very happy. It was very easy, I used light cream instead of milk. For those who found it runny, with these types of pies I found through trial & error :) that you have to follow the directions to the letter. Such as 'cook for another 2 min' 'remove from burner' etc. I used the amounts in the recipe & used the 1/3 cup flour, the cream came out very thick, creamy & smooth. Very nice with the vanilla. Very happy to find this, will probably do the coconut too :)

This pie was delicious. I added a tablespoon of cornstarch, upped the vanilla a bit, and cooked for a lot longer (10mins) to turn it into a custard consistency.

I have been making this recipe for 40+ years!  My family loves it with a prebaked graham cracker crust. Tip: DO NOT BAKE, immediately after pouring the custard into the crust, place plastic wrap directly onto  the hot filling to seal.  This will prevent it from forming a rubbery skin.  Refrigerate overnight.  It's a great make ahead dessert!

I substituted almond milk for whole milk.  I'd read this would keep the pudding/custard from thickening without the casein in milk.  To offset this, I added 2 tablespoons of plain yogurt (a dairy product I thought might have casein).  Fearing that was not enough, in lieu of 3 tablespoons flour, I added 1.5 tablespoons rice flour, 4 tablespoons corn starch and 1.5 tablespoons tapioca starch.  The end result was a pretty good pudding texture that everyone loved, so it worked, but next time I might try to simplify my substitutions, rather than taking this "kitchen sink" approach.  Oh, I also blended a ripe banana with the 4 cups of almond milk so the custard filling would have some banana flavor and I liked the result of that.  Lastly, I did not bake this, I had just finished a no-bake strawberry pie that followed similar steps and assumed this was same way.  So I layered my sliced bananas (tossed first with a bit of lemon juice) in pre-baked shell, poured in the custard (after letting it cool for 2-3 hours in fridge) and then the remaining bananas artistically set into the top, then the whole thing put in freezer for an hour (to speed up it "setting"), then in fridge for 5-6 hours, then served. No baking after bananas were in the pie.  Turned out great, good texture and everything.

This was good, but way too sweet. I'd cut the sugar in half next time. I did have to bake it about 10 minutes longer than the recipe called for, too. Not sure if my oven is cool or what.

This was so yummy! I used 4 TBS of cornstarch instead of flour like someone suggested.  I also used 2% milk. It could have been thicker but it was still good. I also cut the sugar in 1/2.  It was really sweet enough this way.  I will make this again. I used a simple graham cracker crust recipe which went well with this.

My neighbor gave me a stalk of bananas from his tree. I froze some for my Yonanna machine but still had a ton left over. I searched for a pie and came upon this recipe. I followed the clear, detailed directions exactly!  I used the 3 T of corn starch instead of the flour and I did make the vanilla wafer crust. I made 2 pies and they were both gobbled up by all of my neighbors that wanted a taste. They were perfect & flavorful. The bananas were delicious since they were freshly picked making this extra tasty. Definitely will make again!

Love this recipe!  Super yummy.  I did use 3 TBSP of cornstarch instead of flour.  The key is to cook the pudding mixture until it is thick and bubbly.  I also made a Nilla wafer crust.

My husband has declared this his favorite pie in the world!  I made it for his birthday and met rave reviews! Highly recommend.  I followed other's recommendations of using starch and not baking the pie, and it was seriously wonderful.  I topped it with a sweet-rum sauce, and it was seriously fantastic!

This recipe is amazing.  I have to honest, I was a little intimidated to make this because I didn't want banana soup. The bad reviews worried me.  After reading through about 75 reviews and 2 days later, I went for it. Only thing I did after reading reviews is, cooked the custard for longer until it got to a nice thick consistency. I added diced banana to the custard and I DID NOT bake it. I only baked the crust. I used everything else the recipe called for. My family loooooooooved it and want me to make another. Success!  I am an amateur as baking too. I don't do this often.

Next time would mix the custard into the bananas rather than bake them in layers. The custard comes out very firm (more like jello than pudding). Might also be good to sautee the bananas with butter and brown sugar or honey and maybe some brandy to give them more flavor.

Just finished having a slice of this AMAZING pie! I always make a recipe as suggested the first time around, then tweak to my own version of perfection. Here's what I did that made everyone say it was the "best banana cream pie they've ever had"...For the milk, I used 1 cup half n half and 1 cup whole milk. This ensures your filling will not be soupy. I had an overripe, brown, banana that I mashed and added to the pudding. This made the pudding a banana flavor instead of vanilla, but not overpowering. Lastly, I made home made whipped cream for the topping with 1 cup heavy cream, 1 tsp. vanilla and 3 Tbsp. powdered sugar. I decorated the top with banana slices and Nilla wafers. You won't be disappointed!!

Do no understand why people are saying it's runny, did you actually allow the pudding mix to cook until it thickened? That's you fault, not the recipes. However, this recipe is fantastic! It turned out beautifully, and I wouldn't change a thing!

I have never made pudding or a cream pie before and I can't believe how well this turned out! I read the reviews ahead of time and decided to follow the recipe exactly through step 2, using whole milk and real vanilla. Then I left the pudding out on the counter until it was completely cool, stirring every 15 minutes or so. That took about an hour. After that, I spread a little pudding on the bottom of the pie crust (made from vanilla wafers), and topped with slices from one banana. I repeated the layers for two more bananas, making sure to cover all the spaces with pudding so there was no trapped air to turn the bananas brown. After I used 3 bananas the pie dish was full, so I didn't use a 4th one. I covered the pie with plastic wrap, using toothpicks to keep the wrap off the surface, and then chilled in the fridge overnight (no baking - per the other reviews). To serve, I topped each slice of pie with a dollop of whipped cream and a slice of banana. It was excellent and got rave reviews at our Mother's Day dinner! I would definitely make this again.

This pie was really good. I made a homemade Nilla wafer crust instead of using a tradition pie crust. That really set it over the top. Great recipe!

I tried this recipe out a couple of times (I used the cornstarch one) and my family loved it! Substituting the bananas with things like 5 tablespoons of cocoa powder or adding coconut doesn't change how well this works! My favorite was putting in the cocoa with baking chocolate chips! It is an amazing thing!

I followed EXACTLY and it came out PERFECT! I used flour and 2% milk. I would imagine using skim would likely cause it to be runny. The key is adding the milk slowly and cooking over medium heat. I made 2 pies separately and followed the recipie exactly both times with no problems. Someone wrote you should never use flour in pies. I use it all the time over cornstarch, it's personal preference and I stand by it. Thank you for posting this wonderful recipe!

I love the pudding filling! I like to mash 2 of the bananas and add those to the pudding rather than slicing them into the bottom of the pie. Then there is more yummy banana flavor throughout! I also do not bake this pie! Add some cool whip to the top once cooled and it is banana cream pie perfection!

The pie is definitely runny but it's totally delicious. I think the 15 minute time to bake is too short and needs to be increased, else you have a banana pudding recipe.

Thank you Ruby for posting a delicious recipe that doesn't use packaged vanilla pudding mix.  It was very sweet for us.  The next time we make this we will cut the sugar down to 1/2 a cup.  We also needed to simmer the pudding for at least ten minutes in order for it to be thick enough to stay put.  After letting it rest in the fridge all night, we didn't bake it either, it still was not completely set.  The next time we will make sure to simmer for 15 minutes and then test to see if the custard is thick enough.  We will definitely be making this again when we have too many over-ripe bananas.  Thank you Ruby.

This is the Banana Pie recipe I've been looking for.  I also reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup and used a vanilla wafer crust.  My custard set up fine after about 1/2 hour of stirring and carefully watching over on the stove.  It wasn't runny at all.  However, my pie ended up being rather soupy the next day.  It was more like a pudding.  I'm not sure what happened because after cooking the custard it was very thick and creamy.  I will try again because this is hands down the best pie Banana pie recipe.

Okay so I have made this twice and think I have stumbled onto something. I made as directed both times except I used less sugar and chilled instead of baked. The first time when I went to eat a slice it was complete soup! It was so disappointing because everything was PERFECT before I put I covered it and put it in the fridge. The second time I did all the same stuff but I left it UNCOVERED in the fridge. Set up PERFECTLY! This recipe is so delicious. I like to mash up half a banana and add it to the pudding so the flavor is more than vanilla. TASTY!

I can't speak to everyone but when I covered it and put it in the fridge it turned into banana cream soup and when I left nothing over it the pie set up perfectly! Hopefully this helps!

This pie turned out great.  The pudding was easy to make and didn't require any ingredients that I didn't readily have on hand.  The sauce thickened up nicely and had a creamy smooth consistency.  The only thing I was unsure about was the pie crust.  I had some extra dough from a previous pie that I was able to use but had never pre-baked a crust before.  While it was baking, it started to puff up and shrink in toward the center so I had to spread it out while baking.  My mother told me though that poking holes in the bottom of the crust before pre-baking helps to prevent that, so I'll try that next time.  Overall this pie was a hit!

I just made this recipe. I did not alter the recipe. I used the cornstarch instead of flour, as mentioned in the footnote. I used this as a parfait in glasses instead of as a pie. I put banana in bottom of two parfait glasses, and nothing in the others. I covered with saran wrap, to prevent film skin on the parfait. I will let my guest decide if they want banana, strawberries (fresh) or caramel with nuts. I am eating an extra parfait glass I made.  It is so good, I couldn't wait to finish before I posted review. While mine poured in just a bit runny, it has since "set" and I can tell that if it was in a pie, it would slice just great. p/s the ingredients, including the measurement are identical to the recipe on the side of the vanilla wafer box for the banana pudding, difference is the tempering of the eggs, and maybe this is why it is of a lighter and fluffier texture than the pudding recipe. DELISH!!

I haven't used a double boiler or stirred on a stove-top to thicken puddings or sauces for years. It is a lot easier to do in the microwave. Use a larger bowl than you think you need (so it doesn't overflow). Put in the microwave and take out at intervals to stir with s whisk. Never lumpy, never scorched. Works well for white sauce too.

Followed this recipe and pie came out great.  I agree with a previous post that there must be a typo in the recipe in step 4.  Maybe missed the part about preparing the meringue before baking.  I used Never-Ever-Fail Meringue recipe on this site and cut the bananas down to 3.  Pie came out very sweet so next time I will cut down on the sugar.

Even though my pie turned out like soup, it was DELICIOUS! After making it, I read other reviews, and realized what I did wrong. So to reiterate other people's instructions: cook the custard until it is thick and do not use skim milk. But again, despite the thinning that was my own fault, this pie is DELICIOUS!

I've had this same basic recipe for years. For those who have trouble making it thicken, use a 1/2 cup flour and replace 1 cup milk with heavy whipping cream. Makes it rich and thick. yummy..

This was amazing, and definitely a keeper!  I tried it with both the flour, and the cornstarch.  Both had the same flavor, the flour mixture turned out to be a bit thicker, which when pouring over the bananas it didn't work it's way all the way to the bottom, which the cornstarch did.  However, the flour kept better in the long run, the cornstarch one kind of lost it's shape within a couple of days and spread throughout the pan and made the crust mushy.  So, if you know you will be having company over and eating it all up quickly, I would go with the cornstarch.  If it's going to be eaten up slowly, I would be going with the flour version.  Either way, it's delicious!  We did follow other reviewers advice of making a vanilla wafer crust (MMMMMMMM), and also about not baking (it didn't need to be baked), made a whipped topping to spread over the top, and also toasted some sliced almonds and sprinkled them over the topping.  Makes me ready to make another just thinking about them!

Best cream pie I have ever eaten. So light and creamy the only word I can think of is ethereal. I used 1/2 cup of sugar and sweetness was perfect. Make sure to cook pudding mixture on low heat very slowly. The first time I put the burner on med and it was too hot - cooked way too fast and  had to start over. Cooking on lower heat so it cooked more slowly worked. I also used the cornstarch - not flour. The pudding set up beautifully. My husband said he will never eat diner pie again!

Yum! This pie is really good! The first time I made this pie, I followed the directions to a T. It came out good and sliced beautifully but, I felt that there wasn't enough pudding compared to all the bananas. Also, the bananas turned brown fairly quickly. 

The second time, I used only three bananas and mixed it into the pudding before putting in the pie shell and I did NOT bake it. I just refrigerated it overnight. This time around my bf and I enjoyed the taste/balance of the pudding and bananas much better. Mixing it together also prevented the bananas from turning brown. The only problem was that this pie did not set as good as the first one I had baked. 

By the way, I did not have any problems with my pudding being too runny. I agree with the other reviewers, you probably did not cook it long enough. I also used whole milk for best results.

Next time I'll continue to mix the pudding and bananas before filling the pie and bake it..or if I don't bake it, I'll use the cornstarch suggestion instead. Either way, this is a great recipe to start from and just tweak however you like. I added a dulce de leche drizzle on top along with some toasted coconut. Yummy combination! My family loved it! Thank you!

Easy to make - and super yummy - great way to use over ripe bananas if you're sick of banana bread. :) Like others recommended, I placed half of the bananas in the bottom of the pie, and mixed the other half into the pudding before spooning it into the pie shell. Fantastic!

I would like to add this step to make this a chocolate banana cream pie

Melt the chocolate with the 2 tablespoons cream over simmering water in the top of a double broiler or in a heat proof bowl set on top of a saucepan. Whisk the chocolate and cream until they form a smooth liquid. Take the pan off the heat, and spoon the chocolate mixture onto the graham-cracker crust. Let the chocolate cool for at least 15 minutes.

I have been using a similar recipe from the Pillsbury Cookbook for years using 1/4c cornstarch and 3 cups of skim milk. It always turns out perfect so go ahead and use skim milk if you wish.  It doesn't affect the consistency of the pie.

This was my first cream pie and I should of read the reviews first because the pudding did not set up well. I used the flour and maybe did'nt cook it long enough or at a high enough temp.However I made a home pie crust and homemade whipped and the taste of the pie was very good. A little practice with the pudding and I will try this again

Easy, delicious, everyone loved it. I used corn starch in place of flour and did not bake but rather chilled it for several hours. Perfect.

If you're having a hard time getting it to thicken then you should probably scald the milk first before putting it in with the dry ingredients. Scalding the milk helps kill off enzymes that prevent it from thickening in food. Also, use milk that at least has some fat in it. If you use skim milk or milk substitutes, that probably contributes to the problem of soupiness. I used low fat milk, and it worked fine. Mine is not so soupy and stays up for the most part when I cut a slice, but the sides do cave in a little, however I did use a recipe that is exactly like this one in every way except that it used THREE cups of milk, so if I had used just two like this recipe calls for then I imagine it would be more solid. I also let it sit in the fridge overnight so it had a lot of time to set. Besides that, I tried to make it a little healthier by using 1/2 cup organic pure cane and 1/4 cup brown sugar instead of white sugar, unbleached flour, earth balance instead of butter, and low fat milk. I'm not sure if any of that helped or hurt the consistency of the filling, but it turned out okay in my opinion. Also, I pureed a couple of bananas in the blender and mixed it in with the pudding to make it more banana-y and it tasted DELICIOUS! Even with all the substitute ingredients it tasted just like store bought pudding. However, because of the sugar I used, the outcome was more brown then yellow. It was still yummy, but not as pretty. It's easy to look past if you want to be healthier.

Ha! I usually read every review before trying a recipe and this time, I didn't, which I hope I don't regret. I did bake it for the time it said - so I pray it turns out ok. On the plus side, it is so incredibly easy to put together, I will definitely be making more. Very cool!

Wish I had read the "Do not cook!" warning before I started, but my pie looks just fine after 8 or so minutes in the oven.  I planned to top the pie with whipped cream anyway, so that should help cover the skin it developed in the oven.  I used skim milk in my mix and had no problem with the pudding mixture thickening.  Maybe those with runny pies could have used a higher temperature or cooked a bit longer.  I also stirred nearly the entire cook time.  Pie looks excellent though, can't wait to taste it after it chills for an hour or two!

The flour in the pudding part made this the worst pie I ever made.  My first time making a banana cream piie and no one liked it.  I also made one using corn starch like some suggested this turned out great.  Will make it again but only with corn starch.

The pudding was so good! I think this is a lot of bananas, but depending on their size, just decide how much you like...  I used a combo of coconut milk (beverage) and vanilla soy milk, and made layers of pudding/bananas instead of just a big pile, and used a chocolate graham cracker crust. Also I took a reviewer's advise and didn't bake it, just refrigerated. Came out great.

The best banana cream pie ever!  I made the pudding exactly as directed, and it is thick and delicious (the trick it to make sure you boil it long enough).  I never cook the pudding though, and I always add homemade whipped cream on top.  To make the whipped cream, I beat about 3/4 cup whipping cream with 1tsp sugar and 1/2tsp vanilla.  You won't regret this pie!

Made this for my husband's birthday and it was perfect!  Used 3 tablespoons of cornstarch instead of flour as recommended and used a vanilla wafer crust as one of the reviewer's suggested.  (1 & 1/2 cup crushed vanilla wafers and 6 tablespoons melted butter).  Also followed the directions from other reviewers to use whole milk, chill extensively, and NOT bake.  Delicious!

I would give it 5 stars but I used reviewers tips which changed the original recipe some. Well, I would still give it 10 stars if I could! It was hard not to toss the pizza and just have this for dinner! OMG! This pie is sooo yummy! I even used a crappy frozen pie crust (i know, shame on me) but it was still sooo good. I used 3 Tablespoons cornstarch instead of flour, used a Tablespoon of vanilla and did not bake it. I did chill for 3 hours. I plan on making another one very soon and will go the extra mile to make a crust from scratch, this pie deserves it! UPADTE AGAIN; Made pie again today, this time made homemade pie crust IV, prebaked it for 10 minutes. Hope it turns out good. While that was cooling I made the pie, although I FORGOT TO ADD THE CORNSTARCH. Ummmm forgot to add flour too. So far it looks great, it's chilling. Hope it turns out as good as the first one, or I'll have to make other plans for dinner! What a numbskull.

This was so good and tricky for me on step # 2 of the directions. I read step two several times to make sure I got it right. I've never baked a homemade cream pie. I was taking this pie as "finger food". What I made was "mini-banana cream pies" I used best choice pie dough (very good) and formed it into twelve cupcake sized pie crusts (pre-cooked), then put a slice of banana in the bottom of each crust. I added the pudding mixture on to each crust, then put a slice of banana on top of the pudding. I topped with fresh whipped cream, then added a thin banana slice on top (turned on side). The twelve mini-pies were gone so fast, I didn't even get one. I finished up the rest of the pudding with some sliced bananas and chilled. It was very good by itself. I'm going to make the pies again for a New Year's party. I'll make more of them this time:) Definitely a keeper.

I used evaporated milk and upped the custard portion by 150% (which means 2 cans of evaporated milk) to fill a larger pie shell. I did use a special cornstarch instead of flour (special in that it has better high temperature characteristics, a must for chocolate cream pies) and I found it got thick a bit unevenly, but a big whisk tamed it beautifully at the end. The evaporated milk made for extra creaminess. 

In building the pie,  I put a layer of sliced banana (stabilized from oxidation with a dousing through a lemon/water solution, 5 parts water, 1 part lemon), then a thick layer of custard, another (total 2) layer of banana, and more custard on top. NO BAKING. I let it set for about 7 hours in the fridge before serving to huge banana cream pie fans. Everyone was very happy.

My pie turned into banana pudding soup and I'm so disappointed. I would have rated this a little higher if there weren't so many reviews about it being runny or soupy. I used the corn starch and in all fairness, I probably should have let it cook until it got to a more paste consistancy. The recipe just says until thick and bubbly, which mine was. Also, I stupidly used banana's that needed to ripen more. But still, too many runny complaints caused me to give this 2 stars. I'm so sad. :*(

This pie was awesome!  My husband inhaled his piece.  I followed suggestions from others and did NOT bake the pie, instead chilled overnight.  I used whole milk and it was a very thick pudding.  I also made the crust from crushed 'nilla wafers and melted butter.  Next time I think I will make my own whipped cream for the topping (I used Cool Whip this time and although my kids loved it, I think a real whipped cream would taste perfect).

I followed the recipe used corn starch instead of the flour. The custard thickened in the pot when I was cooking it. Whn I added the eggs yolk the custard never thickened again. My custard also scorched but I sorta liked the taste. My pie has totally cooled off and is sitting in the fridge. And is a bowl of cold soup. I'm debating on whether I should just take it an put it in the oven on low till it thickens....I don't know.
----------
So I put the soupy pie in the oven till the custard formed.. And I think we are good to go!!! It's cooling off in the fridge. I will make a cream whipped topping for it. I'm excited now!! Glad that I didn't throw the pie away!! I think next time I would reduce sugar.

A simple and perfect traditional banana cream pie recipe.  I followed the directions exactly and the pie came out beautifully.  The reviewer who said her pie was soupy could not have followed the directions properly.  (Maybe she didn't cook the pudding?) I used flour but subbing corn starch is also an option.

The first time I made this I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out terrible. It had a super strong vanilla taste and it was super soupy. 
I decided to try again and it turned out great. I used less then 1 tsp of vanilla and the key to not having a soupy pie is make sure it really boils!! If it does not boil then it wont turn out.

I gave this recipe 3 stars because the ingredients were off a bit and so were the cooking instructions. luckly I saved the pie by changing it up a bit during the process. I added a tablespoon of cornstarch, cooked the mixture for more than 2 mins (about 6 or 7) stirring constantly with a whisk the whole time. after tweaking the recipe, the pie came out excellent, and this was my first time making a pie!

I loved this pie! It's a good and easy recipe.
I also used the egg whites for a meringue topping and I replaced the milk with almond milk ( my boyfriend isn't very good with dairy) and it turned out just as fine!

This thickened up just fine and I didn't bake it but I would mix in the bananas next time instead of layering it over because it didn't go down into the bananas which was a little strange but the taste was fabulous.

This was the 1st time I've made pudding from scratch, never mind a banana cream pie. I made it for memorial day cause its my father in laws favorite desert. The only change I made was to use cornstarch instead of flour & a full tablespoon of vanilla. I was surprised how easy it was to make although it was too sweet, I will cut back on the sugar next time. Also it was very runny! I read the reviews & everyone seems to think that using anything other than whole milk will cause this. However I did use whole milk, so I'm not quite sure what happened. Never the less I will still make this again it was very good, I will try letting the mixture thicken up more before adding the eggs in & see if that helps.

Wow! What a great, easy recipe. My family loved it and it took no time to make. The only thing I did differently was to make a graham crumb crust and baked it for 10 minutes.

This is only the second pie I've ever made and really liked it; it was a big success among my friends. The pudding tastes really good. The only thing I'll do differently next time is let it chill for more than an hour, otherwise it's a little runny.

I originally made this as a birthday dessert for my Dad who hasn't had a real banana cream pie for decades. Not only did he give it rave reviews, now my husband is requesting this. I used a graham cracker crust, 2% milk and replaced the flour with 2 tablespoons of corn starch. Delicious!

I just prepared it today for Easter, and it looks amazing!!!! The pudding tastes great so I am sure it will be great! I wanted to add this for the people who had runny pudding. Make sure you use at least 2% milk, whole is better, but 2%percent will work ok too. And make sure you boiling it and stirring for 2 or 3 minutes, till it thickens a bit in the pan. Mine turned out great! I also used a 10 inch pis crust, homemade. For those of you who said you too much, for me it filled the pan perfectly. I also made a meringue out of the egg whites and that kept the "skin" from forming on top. I can't wait to dig in tomorrow evening!! Thank  you so much for this delicious recipe! :)

Fantastic. A scratch pudding pie without the use of a box mix! I use the leftover whites and make a meringue to top the pie with before I put in into the oven.

Awesome! I followed the directions exactly and then put a layer or whip cream on top (thought I'd like to find a better topping). Also, I only needed 2 bananas in the pie and I used one to put on top of the whip cream. Served this at a dinner party and everyone loved it!

I added the bananas to the pudding mixture while it was cooling. I put a thin layer of caramel topping before I added the pudding mixture. Put cool whip on top. Topped it all off with chocolate shavings and toasted almonds. Yum! This pudding mixture is great by itself as well.. deeelicious. Definitely will be making this again. It was a HUGE hit!

My boyfriend has been nagging for me to make a homemade banana cream pie. I came across this recipe and WOW! Everyone absolutely loved it! I'm not much of a baker and the pudding came out delicious! Will definitely make again soon!

Oh man this was tasty! I did the nilla wafer crust as suggested by kate (1-1/2 C. nilla crumbs, 6T melted butter). Remember to put it in the chill chest for a while before you dig into it or you won't get the right consistency. That said, I could just have it warm, scooped into a bowl of graham crackers the way my mom used to do chocolate pudding.

Next time around I'm going to introduce some banana liqueur into the custard.

I made this recipie tonight and it was awsome.  I did change the flour to 3 tbls. of corn starch as suggested by many people and I did use 1 percent milk and it came out great.  My husband and my niece Kassie loved it!

This was definitely a good pie, but there are a few changes I made. I used corn starch instead of flour and reduced the sugar slightly to just over 1/2 cup. I also used six medium sized bananas and mixed them into the custard before pouring it into the shell; thinner slices made sure the custard didn't pull away. And finally, I didn't bake the pie - just put it in the fridge to set up and it was ready in about 2 hours! 
My family devoured the first pie, s I'm glad I made two!

This pie is awesome!  I did not bake and used cornstarch as well.  Instead of the recommended crust I used a pre-made Keebler shortbread crust!  Loves it!

I baked this pie for someone as a gift, I'd never made a cream pie of any sort before or even tasted a banana cream pie. My first attempt (using flour) went horribly wrong, I even chilled it for 7 hours hoping it'd firm up but it was still like a delicious tasting soup, but I couldn't give it to someone in that condition. Not wanting to waste the filling (my dear husband had eaten all the rest of the bananas in the meanwhile so it wasn't really an option to start over) and researching what went wrong, I put the bananas in a strainer, put the custard back in a pot, added cream and cornstarch and cooked it a lot longer until it thickened. Now I think it's as it's supposed to be. My advice: Definitely use cornstarch, whole milk or half and half. Cook it as long as it takes to thicken (but don't boil it esp. if using cornstarch)... if you take it off the stove thin it won't thicken very much after you stop cooking.  If it's still thin, you can try putting it back in the pot and cooking it longer (without the bananas)  Hopefully it's a hit with the recipient, I think it tastes good :)

Excellent recipe! Even my boyfriend liked it, and he doesn't like to eat sweet things. I thought I followed the directions for the pudding exactly, using cornstarch instead of flour, but I just realized now that I forgot to add the 2 TBSP of butter! It was still delicious :) It became very very thick and was very easy to make. I used whole milk, and I think that is key. (the whole milk here is 3.9% M.F, I think the higher the fat content the better). I'm not too sure why some people are having problems getting it thick enough, maybe they are not letting it simmer long enough? I once made a similar recipe that called for half and half instead of milk, so maybe they could try mixing some half and half with the milk. I did NOT bake the pie after I filled the baked shell with the filling, and topped with homemade whipped cream.

The taste was very good the first day, but I haven't made Banana Cream before so how do you keep the bananas from turning brown. The second day they weren't very good.  Not the recipes fault there.  But if using 4 bananas they must be smaller size, my larger ones 3 was almost too much. The second day they weren't very good.

I haven't had banana cream pie in decades, but my daughter wanted to make it for Christmas dinner.  Very glad we did!  This recipe made one of the best pies I've ever tasted.  We had it again for breakfast this morning with a cup of coffee...yum!  Only downside was I forgot to buy some whipped topping.  The upside was it still tasted great without it!

I followed this recipe exactly as written--EXCEPT 2 things--I used buttermilk (only milk I had) and I made a meringue for the top (as per previous post). It set up well in the fridge overnight BUT it was runny when I took it for our Thanksgiving dinner.  Will have to rethink this...taste was good, bananas were gray.

This was a very easy recipe to make and the pudding was delicious warm (I couldn't leave it alone!).  However after chilling it was much much much too sweet, the pie was almost inedible.  I also too other reviewers advice and used the cornstarch and I did not bake the pie (certainly prebaked the shell), I chilled it for several hours and it came out perfect.

This was really good, and I followed the recipe exactly. In the middle of making it, I was thinking to myself "I really wish I just used an instant pudding mix because this is a lot of work!" ...well, I ended up eating my words when the pie was all done. This is not your normal pudding, and definitely NOT the low quality that is instant pudding. It's a great custard with really great flavor. I will make this again to use up bananas.

I made this today and it turned out perfectly.  No soupy pies here!  My secret?  I heated the milk to an almost-boiling on the stove before adding it to the dry ingredients!  I then continued heating and mixing and within five minutes, it was a nice thick pudding!  My first cream pie I've ever made and it turned out heavenly.  My husband was thrilled that I made this, and was shocked that I didn't use a pudding mix recipe like I've seen again and again.  This one will definitely be a staple in our desert box.

The pudding part of this recipe gets 5 stars for sure, but over all as a pie maybe only 4. The flavor of the vanilla pudding you pour over the bananas is divine. I'll for sure you that part of the recipe again. For the pie, I added a meringue to the top which helped alot. It allowed each slice to hold its pie shape on the plate. Without it, it would have been a blob of sliced bananas (that turn brown) and  vanilla pudding in a pie crust. I used the whites to the 3 eggs in this recipes plus 5 TBS sugar for the meringue then baked 20 min at 350 then chilled for several hours. Meringue is not usually chilled, so it beaded a bit. However, if you put it on the pie while the filling is still piping hot it will cook the bottom layer faster preventing shriking and running during cooking and cooling. Overall the pie was a success....but in the end the meringue and the pudding made it...not the bananas.

The pudding in this recipe is absolutely delicious! Next time I make this, I will be sure that the sliced banana layers are covered with pudding, with no air so they will not brown! Other than that, everyone loved this pie!

Good recipe overall--definitely could be improved a bit with a whipped cream layer on top and some drizzled caramel! The butter was unnecessary for me--you can omit and still have a great tasting pudding.  Be sure to stir continuously! Otherwise, you will have lumps. Also, make sure you error on the side of higher fat milk--those who had soupy pudding  did one of the following: -too lowfat of milk (e.g. 1% or less) -did not use enough flour for thickening or wait for flour to thicken before completing the egg step  The baking is not necessary, but is okay for setting.  Add an extra 1/4 tsp of salt in the pudding and another 1/4-1/2 tsp vanilla, and this recipe is ultra-full flavored. -did not cook pudding long enough for egg to fully cook

I absolutely love this recipe! I've been making it for about two years now, and it still comes out wonderfully. The first time I made it I messed up, and the cake was runny, though still delicious. I wasn't willing to give up though, and so I made this again and it turned out perfectly. I don't know what I did wrong the first time, but I highly encourage that if you face a similar problem to try again. This pie is AMAZING and one of my friends has me make this for her every year on her birthday. And she always requests that I use the same recipe.

My husband and I both thought this was the best banana cream pie we'd ever had.  I do think you need to use whole milk for the "cream" part of the pie.  I've found with other recipes that if you use anything with less milk fat the custard is runny.

Super recipe! I agree with those before me that the custard is plenty thick enough using the flour as prescribed as long as you cook it as instructed. They weren't kidding about the consant stiring either. I highly recommend using a silicon spatula for stirring since its important to scrape all surfaces of the pan during cooking. I also chose to layer the custard and bananas in the pie pan (banana followed by custard, repeat three times). It took 5 small /medium bananas to do the job. I also followed the steps of others by skipping the baking step and refrigerating it overnight. It turned out perfectly.

I used cornstarch instead of flour but otherwise made as directed (using Epicurious pastry dough crust) and of course topped with real whipped cream. This set up perfectly and was beautiful. I wouldn't put bananas on top because they would brown and make it look spoiled.

This was a great recipe! I even used skim milk and it came out great. I did layer the bananas inbetween the cream hoping it would help to keep them from browning and I think it worked. I just poured about half of the custard into the baked pie shell, sliced 3 bananas onto that custard, then poured on the rest. I thought 3 bananas would be enough, but I would use 4 next time.

I followed this recipe exactly, and did not find it to be all that terrific or a stand out banana cream pie recipe. I found the taste to be lacking, and to be honest, the pudding even tasted "floury" to me, and it was a turn off. I have an outstanding banana cream pie recipe that I've always used, but wanted to try something different this time. Sorry, I will be going back to my tried and true recipe from now on.

Gosh this tasted so good (with a Vanilla Wafer crust)...but whoever says not to bake this pie is wrong. I followed their advice and ended up with an un-set pie...while yes, it's yummy..but unless you're serving up a spoonful of pudding, you'll probably want to bake it..at least a few minutes, otherwise it won't congeal.

Top layer was gummy.  Bananas on bottom browned.  A very unattractive pie, unpleasing to the eye.  A big let-down!

Great Pie! But, I gave this review only 3 out of five for two reasons. 1-The recipe does not specify salted or unsalted butter. For a seasoned home cooker it is a simple fix or adjustment but for a newbie (my wife) it can make for a salty dish. 2) Again for a seasoned home cooker not a problem. The pudding. The sugar salt and flour should be mixed first, then added to the saucepan. Then turn the burner on med heat and start adding the milk slowly, about 1/4 cup at a time while the saucepan heats up. continually stirring. Don't stop stirring until you cannot see the white from the milk on the surface of the pudding. Also, I will not add the bananas until after I bake next time. Thye turned a blackish/brown in the oven.  Overall a great pie recipe with the changes! If you're having problems getting a nice consistancy with the pudding, slowly heating it up should help.

For those of you having trouble with runny pudding, the problem is in the wording of the recipe.  It says to stir until the mixture is bubbly - be careful - bubbly means bubbling up from the bottom because it is boiling.  It is not referring to the bubbles cause by stirring the milk.  If this is not brought to a boil and allowed to cook for time the recipe gives, the flour won't cook and it won't thicken.  For new cooks, more specific information definitely helps!

This was a very easy pie to make.. The pudding tasted GREAT!!! And was not soupy at all! I used 3 TBS of Cornstarch as well in place of the Flour and did not hav a problem at all with the pudding setting.. If yours is soupy you did not let it cook long enough to get thick. I found that 4 bananas were too much so I will use the last one to decorate the top with after it is done chilling.. I also used Vanilla wafers AND gram crackers as my crust!!! OUT OF THIS WORLD pie recipe!!!

ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL. I have NEVER  made a pie before. there were two things that I did differently. 1. I did not bake the pie and secondly I used a gram cracker crust. Banana Cream pie is my favorite and have only bought it from restaurants this taste the same and almost better.

I should have followed the recipe exactly as it was written.  I strayed a little bit and did not bake the pie as one reviewer suggested.  It was chilling all day long and looked firm and set as I took it out of the refrigerator to serve it.  Sadly as I cut the first piece, I realized that it was going to be kind of soupy.  I'm giving it 5 stars though, because the flavors were outstanding.  I made a ‘Nilla Wafer cookie crust for the pie and that was really an asset in pulling the flavors together.  Next time I make (and I will make it again), I'm going to bake it for the prescribed time to firm up the pudding.  Hopefully my husband will love it even more.  Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe.

I can't believe I made pudding from scratch!  My pie shell was too small to fit all this, so we chilled the excess filling and ate it with chocolate chips.  Heavenly!!  This pie is especially tasty in a Nilla crumb crust, topped with homemade whipped cream!  I will DEFINITELY make this again!

This is an easy and delicious. I also did not bake it and used the Nilla Wafer crust suggested by another reviewer. As for some people having problems with it being runny I can’t understand why. The important thing is to get the pudding mixture to boil, which the submitter called “bubbly” and to constantly stir. Mine was getting thick with the first 2 minute boil. This is also wonderful as vanilla pudding

WOW!!!! my whole family was impressed. >One piece of advise is to make sure you cook the first four ingredients in medium to low heat to dissolve the flour well or it will come out runny!  Oh, but the taste is out of this world!!!!!! DELICIOUS!

Very good! I followed the directions, but used one reader's suggestions of adding 1/8 C cornstartch mixed with 1/8 C half-and-half to the second boiling in step 2. This resulted in a nice custard style filling. Make sure you stir the flour and cornstarch well so you don't have too many lumps. For my first pie, I only added bananas to the bottom of the pie crust and then to the top when it was finished (I didn't bake it). For my second pie, I mixed sliced bananas in the pudding when it was cool. Either way is good, depending on how much banana you like!

Used the graham cracker crust and cornstarch option. The custard set beautifully. I took it to a party and after a few hours out of the fridge on the dessert table it did get runny, but that didn't keep everyone from eating it! Serve cold and it will not be runny. Delicious banana goodness.

OMG! This is the best banana cream pie i have ever had. I didn't alter the recipie at all but i did take the advice NOT to bake it. Turned out perfect and i do mean perfect. Just make sure to use a whisk and cook the pudding on medium (not a notch higher). It set up better than i thought it would. I love it. My advice is after adding whipped cream to the top (I used Reddi Whip) garnish with chopped marschino cherries. The flavors are out of this world!

I also did not put this pie in the oven. I bought a pre-baked grahm cracker pie crust and topped with cool whip. I made this pie in less then 20 minutes and let it chill in the refrigerator over night. Everyone loved this pie so much I felt like a professional cook. I am so glad to have stumbled across this recipe and whoever created it deserves a prize!

This is great. Everything is easy to make and turns out wonderfully. Fun additions I've done include mixing in some chocolate with the bananas, and topping it with whipped cream (or chocolate whipped cream)  and almond slivers.   A thin layer of pecan pie baked in with the crust works really nice with this too. It adds a nice nutty crunch! A chocolate chip cookie crust works awesomely too. Just bake some Pillsbury chocolate chip cookie dough layered on the bottom of your pie tin and fill in the banana cream pie. It's great!

My daughter requested banana cream pie and I actually had all of the ingredients to make this.  All I can say is: EXCEPTIONAL!!!! I'll never make one with a mix again.  This was perfect.  Thank you, thank you, thank you!

This cream pie is phenomenal! After having made this a few times, I most enjoy making this by subbing in half the milk with heavy whipping cream (it's decadent and delicious) and also mixing in a liberal amount of unsweetened coconut. I like the subtle tropical flavor it adds. Highly recommend! Delicious and semihealthy feeling, kind of. :)

This was awesome! I did add vanilla bean to the custard and topped with melted caramel. Really nice to make a "real" filling instead of instant pudding.

Just amazing. Apart from dropping it on the floor so I can't tell how it would have turned out visually etc. The taste is phenomenal - yes we saved some and ate it!  For those who said it wasn't thick enough I believe the problem is right at the start. It should be thick by the end of step one. Mistakes I've made in the past with things like this are cooking too fast or not long enough at this step. I think if you get the first step wrong you can't recover. This is coming from a novice by the way - so feel free to correct me! (and I drop pies on the floor)

Creamy, delicious, goodness!!  This recipe is impressive! I used the 3 tablespoons of cornstarch instead of the flour; vanilla wafer crust (mix 1-1/2 cups crushed vanilla wafers with 6 tbsp melted butter and bake for 5 mins at 350); and used the left over egg whites for a meringue (beat egg whites with 1/4 tsp cream of tartar until peaks form, beat in 6 tbsp white sugar, cover pie with meringue and bake at 325 degrees until slightly browned). Only issues I had with the pie: the crust was a bit too crumbly and the meringue flattened when I placed it into the fridge. Next time I will let the pie cool completely before chilling in the fridge.  The whole process takes time, but the finish product is well worth the wait!

I just made this pie.  i think it would have been better if i waited for it to cool completely.  i was just too excited to wait.  i also added the meringue since i had leftover egg whites.  it turned out awesome.  this was my first shot at a Banana Creme pie and it wont be my last.  Definitely will make again.Thanks for the recipe.

This pie is crying good!  Makes you cry it tastes so darn good.  I've never done a review before and signed on just to rate this pie.  BTW, those that had runny pies didn't boil it long enough.  And I also didn't bake it.

This turned out really great!  My husband was even impressed and raved about it to his family back home.  I love the feeling of making something from scratch and having it turn out so well.  I took the advice to use cornstarch instead of flour and also whole milk instead of my usual skim.

Absolutely fabulous! This pie was to die for!! I followed the recipe exactly and used the Nilla Wafer crust that was recommended, the result was the best banana cream pie I've had since my grandmother passed away. I made sweetened whipped cream (recipe from this site) to top it off and it was perfect.

Loved this recipe, I followed some of the other  reviewers suggestions, by not baking it and to  use corn starch instead of the flower. Turned  out great.

Wow! I make Banana Cream Pie from scratch every year and this one by far is the best so far, everyone was fighting over who was going to get the last piece! I followed the direction exactly, and although I was skeptic of baking the whole pie before chilling I did it anyway and it turned out great! I may add banana extract next time instead of vanilla for the more banana taste, and possibly cover the crust when I bake it again but other than that it was perfect!

So yummy! I used small sugar cookie tart shells I had left over from another recipe. My other half LOVES banana cream pie so I thought I would give this a shot. The cream turned out amazing. I use a wisk for stiring over the heat as I always do for flour frostings and such. and this was no exception. It thickened up perfect and creamy. Just fantastic. I put a small about of cream under the bananas and then completely covered making sure there were no air holes to get to the bananas. Top with fresh whipped cream and a slice of banana immediately before serving....delish!

The recipe worked perfect except I put bananas on the bottom the sides and in between the two batches I made to fill up my pie tin. I also dipped the bananas I placed on the top in lemon juice which worked well to keep them from turning brown but also lent quite a bit of lemon flavor to the pie. I would pat them dry first, perhaps.

This pie turned out perfect! So easy to make. I used skim milk and had no problems.  I also mashed the bananas into the pudding. I didn't bake it based on earlier reviews, just chilled it and it turned out great!

This pie turned out great!  I loved the flavor of the pastry cream.  I made the pie exactly as is using flour but not baking it.  I didn't have a single problem with it setting up.  I brought it up to a boil, tempered the eggs and then added them in.  Then turned the heat off and added the butter and vanilla.  I sprinkled my sliced bananas with lemon juice to keep them from browning, and topped it off with sweetened whipped cream.  The presentation was very nice and it tasted great!

I read the reveiws before making this pie. Mine turned out perfect. I did not bake mine and I used cornstarch instead of flour. I think the reason people had runny pies is the didn't cook it on the stove long enough. It ws a great recipe. Thanks. I will be making it again and again.

This recipe was very easy.  The taste un-beliveable.  I changed up a bit and added a touch of yellow food color for presentation and added banana extract for a bit more banana flavor and I let my neighbors judge and then the family.  they were all going bananas.  Thanks Ms. Pfeffer!

I love banana cream pie,and have been looking for a good recipe to make one at home. This recipe is sooo good! The filling wouldn't fully set for me, but then i realized i accidentally used skim milk. (oops) I found it a little sweet for my taste, so i will half the sugar next time. Will definately use this recipe again!

This was the most wonderful pie ever! I used the 3T instead of the flour and I used another persons suggestion to use a differant crust. i used 1 and 1/2 cups vanilla waffers and 6T melted butter and bake at 350 for 5 mins. For those who said it was too runny, you didn't cook it in the saucepan on med. heat long enough. Thanks for the recipe! wonderful!

It's heaven! i also minimized some sugar. however if you are considering to add bananas on top of the pie, make sure you bake the pie till the bananas are cooked. otherwise the bananas on top will be oxidized and turn black.

This recipe was really good, especially with fresh whipped cream.  However, while everyone else raved about it, this was a bit too sweet for my liking even though I replaced 1/2 C of the sugar with agave nectar and used organic cane sugar for the other 1/4 C.  Next time I think I will only use 1/2 C agave nectar and skip on the sugar altogether.  I used a homemade pie crust that I got from a fruit tart recipe on Allrecipes that got equally rave reviews from my guests who devoured the pie.  I would definitely agree with the other reviewers who mentioned the pudding was so good it would make a great dessert all on its own.

Ok, the taste of this pie was lovely. I didn't bake it, slightly decreased the sugar, used cornstarch instead of flour as suggested and topped with whipped cream. However I was not crazy about the consistency of the filling. It wasn't that heavenly, light cream I love in Banana cream pie, it was slightly gummy. My boyfriend would give it 5 stars for sure, he absolutely loved it. I found it to be very good, not great.

This recipe for Banana Cream Pie was AWESOME...I used cornstarch instead of flour and after cooking the pudding per recipe instructions it turned out WONDERFUL...I prebaked a pie shell and when pie chilled in the refrigerator I put cool whip on top of the pie...it tasted soooooooooooo good...Thank you so much for the recipe. This banana cream pie is GREAT...  I LOVE this site..the recipes on here are wonderful.

Excellent!  Two minor changes... used a pre-made Nilla wafer crust and did not bake for 15 minutes.  The pudding alone is exceptionally good.

This recipe was really good! I cooked it as stated with flour and it was perfect, although I did need to cook it longer than the recipe said. I didn't bake it and didn't add anything on the top. My boyfriend loved it and I'll definately make it again.

This was good, but not fantastic. I used a mixture of flour and cornstarch instead of just flour, and soy milk in place of milk. There is NO need to bake the pie once you cook the pudding. To dress it up, whip an 8 oz. container of whipped topping and spread it on top. Even the kids who don't like bananas ate this.

I used 1/2 banana extract and 1/2 vanilla extract for more banana flavor. Like others, I did not bake this pie, but rather, let it sit out to cool for about an hour, then put in the refrigerator. Filling was a little more solid than I would've liked, but tasted great. I probably let it cool too long before refrigerating. I plan to make just the pudding again to use as cake filling.

this is the most amazing pie ever. i cooked it for a really long time but it was worth it. definitely use the vanilla wafer crust and if its not at a pudding consistency that you would like to eat out of the pot, its not done yet. i took the advice to NOT bake the pie. it was great

Yum! I didn't bake this after filling. Topped it with fresh lightly sweetened whipped cream. Next time may try a vanilla wafer crust for fun. My husband loves this pie!

Oh. My. Gosh. This was SO good... the ultimate comfort food. Everyone thought I had done this pie the ol' jello way until they took a bite. The custard was awesome! I covered the pie with fresh whipped cream and it was gone about 10 minutes after I took it out of the fridge. YUM! Definitely going in my recipe book and it's one I'll be going back to again and again. Thanks so much for sharing!

This recipe for banana cream pie was AMAZING.  The pudding was thick with the perfect amount of vanilla taste.  I used cool whip for the topping because I find that the general population prefers it over a meringue.  One trick I used was to use a cookie scoop to make little balls on top of the pudding then just pressed it down and pulled up to create spikes, which made it look professional! Absolutely delicious!

The quintessential banana cream pie!  I have made this one a few times now and will not use another recipe.  This is good, old-fashioned pie from scratch, no boxed pudding!!!  Incredibly yummy!

I didn't bake mine, so not sure if review is legit.. but it was too runny.  I heeded others warnings about lower fat milk, so I mixed my 1% with whipping cream, as I didn't have anything else... it was good, but was more like a pudding than a pie. I used cornstarch not flour.  It was my first ever attempt though, may retry in future as the pudding was delicious!

I made this for Easter. It was a little on the sweet side for my tastes. My husband brought the leftovers to work and I've got people asking for the recipe now! It tastes good, just was sweet. I will continue to make this.  I used 1/2 cup sugar like others recommended. I used, Carols' "Graham Cracker crust I" from this site. I also did not bake it in the oven, used whole milk, 3 bananas, I folded the bananas into the pudding mixture and saved putting cream on the top until just before serving. I can see this becoming something that is requested from me to bring. Thanks!

I made this pie as a birthday gift for my father-who has everything and loves homemade desserts. I took other viewers advice and did not bake the pie. Based on his feedback, he said it was absolutely fabulous. I'll definitely make this again. Thanks for the recipe!

This is a good recipe if you like to cook things from scratch. Other recipes make it all too easy by just using pudding mixes-_- which I think defeats the purpose of ''cooking'' since you are only ''mixing'':P. I thank the author for this old fashioned recipe. Now, others have noted that theirs came out ''runny''. For them I say, keep stirring...it takes a while but it WILL become a creamy consistency. I like mine a bit firmer so what I did  was adde a TB of cornstarch in a TB of cold milk mixed then tossed it in the warmed mix and kept stirring.

Based on the recipe as is presented. It was so runny! not eatable.  Maybe if I had followed the suggestions of using starch. I had this thing on the stove for almost 30 minutes waiting for it to thicken up, didn't.  Thought the fridge would do the trick, didn't.  The flavour isn't good enough for me to try again. Sorry. I'll just use a different recipe for a custard and put some bananas in it.

Better than using pudding mix and cheaper.  Great taste.  Used corn starch and did not bake.  Worth the cooking and it's not really that much work anyway

This recipe is easy and tastes great.  I had no problem with its thickness, either.  I think some people ended up with runny filling because they did not make the pudding part properly--it needs to cook on the stove long enough for it to get thick.  For the crust, I used a frozen unbaked crust, which I first baked separate for 15 minutes, then coated with an extra egg white, then put the bananas and pudding mix in and baked for 14 minutes.  I also covered the pie with homemade whipped topping after baking.

Pie tasted great, but I think the directions are slightly off.  Medium heat, at least on my stove, doesn't make it "bubbly."  You need more heat.  I was there stirring probably 15 min and no "bubbly."  Went up to med-high and got the bubbles.  It finally thickened and we had a custard.

A note should be made that you must use 2% or higher milk or else it will not set properly. I mashed up 2 bananas and put them into the puree as well i think without doing that it wouldn't be as flavourfull. Next time i will use the cornstarch instead of flour and see how that goes. Other than that the flavour was excellent and will definately make it again.

This pie was excellent!  After reading a lot of the reviews, I added 2 extra bananas, which I had my three-year-old mash up, to the mixture.  I also did not bake and just let cool and then refridgerated for two hours.  It was a little too sweet for my taste, but i'm pregnant and everything seems to taste off!  All in all, it was super easy and quick to make...and above all DELICIOUS!!!

Great recipe!  The pudding was amazing (made from scratch is always better).  I used flour and didn't have a problem with a 'floury' taste or texture.  I did use less sugar (1/2 cup) and also added two mashed bananas to the custard after it was cooked.  I melted some semi-sweet chocolate chips and put that in the bottom of my crust, followed by a layer of sliced bananas, then put the pudding in.  I used the three egg whites and made meringue for the top.  The result, a very pretty and delicious pie!  Because of the meringue, I did bake the pie at 325 until golden.  No problems with runny filling.  Will definately use this as my standard banana pie recipe!

Great Pie! Cooked for half the time specified and cooled for 2 hrs. Key to getting the pie to firm up is to cook the custard until it starts to get thick. We will definitely make this again!

Really great pie.  The pudding is delicious.  I used whole milk and added it a half cup at at time, stirred, and let it thicken before adding another half cup.  It did not turn out soupy at all.  When I cut into it it held it's shape.  I've made it twice in the past week.  It's that good.

This is an excellent recipe.  Like previous reviews, I substitued corn starch for the flour.  It was wonderful, excellent homemade pudding base.  The pudding consistency was perfect!

This was excellent, though harder to make than I originally anticipated. I couldn't believe how long it took for the bubbles to start forming in the pudding - it was more than half an hour. But well worth it!

This pie was delicious.  I followed the recipe exactly except I did not bake the pie in the crust.  It didn't need it.  I just put the pie together and chilled for several hours.  I'm not sure why others were having a problem with "soupiness" because mine had the consistency of custard.

Excellent! I took the advice of others and only used 1/3 cup of sugar and 1/6 flour and 1/6 cornstarch.  It turned out perfect! Not too sweet and the consistency was just like pudding. Tasted great! I'll be using this recipe from now on.

This recipe was quick and easy.  I followed all ingredients but next time will cut sugar a to 1/3C and will try halfing Cornstarch and Flour.  Did not bake at the end.  I appreciated how easily this recipe thickened.  For reviewers who had difficulty with thickness you did not cook long enough.  Will definitely try this receipe again.  Possibly using coconut flakes instead of banana since Coconut Cream pie is another favorite.

Great pie! Tasted awesome and garnished many compliments. Used the "Ruth's Grandma's Pie Crust" recipe from this site.

Did like other reviewers suggested and used a mix of Cornstarch & Flour instead of just flour.

Topped it off with a coconut whipped cream and toasted coconut flakes. Also, alternated layering bananas and the cream mixture. Waited till I was about to serve before covering with the whipped cream and toasted coconut like another reviewer suggested. 


Coconut Whipped Cream: Whip 1 cup Heavy Whipping Cream till soft peaks form, add 1 tbsp sugar and 1 tsp coconut extract, and whip until thicker.

Flaked Coconut: Preheat oven to 325* degrees. Spread coconut flakes out on a baking sheet and bake for 5 minutes.

Did like other reviewers and didn't bake the pie (not needed, the custard was thick enough after sitting in the fridge a few hours). Made this for my Mom's birthday and it was gone in a flash!

This was my first time making pie and my husband requested that I make him banana cream pie so I did. I didn't bake it I just let it sit in the fridge for a few hours and I also topped it with whipped. Once I sliced it it was very runny and I was bummed, but my husband loved it he just said it looks like banana pudding but delicious. So next time i'll take the advice with the 1/3 cup of cornstarch. I put it in the freezer and it doesn't look runny anymore. If anyone had problems with the runny pie put it in the fridge and you got yourself a good looking pie! Overall it was very good and i'm enjoying a slice right now.

I followed this recipe almost to a T - the only change I made was to replace a couple of tablespoons of the flour with corn starch, per the suggestion of a number of reviewers.  Even using whole milk I could not get this to set up -Extending the cooking times didn't help either.  It was banana cream soup.  I found the custard to be a little bit too sweet as well.

I have never had luck with pastry cream, but this recipe turned out perfectly.  I took the advice of the other reviewers and used 3T flour & 3T cornstarch; also increased the vanilla to 1 1/2tsp and used whole milk.  Don't bake it; top with whipped cream and enjoy!

This was the first banana cream pie that I ever made that actaully worked out and wasnt runny! It was deicious, and only received four stars since some of my kids just didn;t go for the pudding consistency, which was their loss. I followed a reviewer's advice and I filled the 1/3 of a cup halfway with flour and halfway with cornstarch, which was a prefect thickening recipe.  I kept stirring a ton, and used soy milk instead of milk. I did NOT bake it at all. I topped this with non-dairy whipped topping. Yum!

The BEST Banana Cream pie.  I did not bake the mixture as per other reviewer suggestions.  It turned out PERFECT.  My husband ate 3 slices after dinner.  I am a food snob and this is the only Banana Cream Pie recipe I will ever use.  I think I will try this with other fruits too.  Thank you SO MUCH!

This recipe turned out just wonderful.  I pre-baked a graham cracker crust first. I did as one reviewer suggested, and used 1 cup evaporated milk and 1 cup water. After adding the yolks I added 2 sliced bananas and they cooked right down, great banana flavor.  Poured into cooled pie crust and topped with another sliced banana. My husband was just thrilled!
Best and easiest recipe ever.

The custard in this pie is so good, I wanted to just eat it on its own. I did half flour, half cornstarch and did a vanilla cookie crust. I live in a dorm with no kitchen, so I made it in a rice cooker and worked out perfectly.

I wanted to make this because one of my favorite restaurants in town is famous for their peanut butter banana cream pie. Their recipe is available online but was a little more difficult and since this one was similar I went with it. I thought the flavor was wonderful but adding the cornstarch made it just a little firm for my liking. I also would have liked more banana flavor so I will probably add a few more next time. In order to make it like the restaurant's, and an idea for all of you, I used the mini graham cracker tart shells and put a very thin layer of peanut butter on the bottom of the shell.  I topped with meringue but next time will use whip cream as I would have liked the sweetness. I baked the pies just long enough to brown the meringue as well.  The presentation was perfect and overall the taste was delicious too. I will make again!  Oh, and this recipe made just enough for 12 small graham cracker tarts.  Perfect for a party!

it was pretty good, although i think just store bought vanilla pudding would have worked for the "cream" i might tweak the vanilla measurement because it was really really strong.

This turned out perfect! Didn't change a thing. I used a homemade whipped cream recipe I found on here that worked perfect. Next time, I'm going to try adding strawberries on top of the pudding and maybe add some strawberry glaze. Thanks for sharing.

The custard part of this recipe is fabulous.  I will make it as a pudding.  The pie had too many bananas for our taste.  It was suggested that next time I just use one.

I used the custard to make custard tarts, which we really enjoyed.

This pie turned out fabulous!  I have made it twice.  The first time it seemed like it took forever to cook, the second time I cheated and turned the burner up a little higher but just stirred a lot to make it sure it didn't stick.  Everyone loved this pie.

Great recipe!The vanilla pudding goes great with the banana taste.The custard thickened well after boiling, in fact i added a bit more milk to pour it in the pan.
I used flour cause it's smoother and doesn't inflict on the taste.
Regarding the sugar factor i added some at a time as i always do cause it doesn't kill you to taste something rather than regretting after.But 3/4 cup was ok for me!
Also as someone else said next time i will go for 1 1/2 filling cause it wasn't enough.So i whipped almost 1/2 fast (didn't pay attention how much i put cause i wanted to finish it) ,added cinnamon this time and poured it on top.The 4 layers embrace each other so well...I cooked it for a few minutes but wish i didn't cause the bananas mushed a bit..but no biggy!
After 1 hour in the fridge the custard set so good that i flipped it upside down on my hand to get it out of the pan,yet so moist and smooth inside!
I got another "Fabulous" from hubby and that's enough for me...

Very good and easy to make.  We added two mashed bananas to the pudding mixtures.  It was not as smooth, but it was still delicious and we enjoyed the extra banana flavor.  Another added flavor was topping it off with softened peanut butter.  Yummy and easy, I will be making it again when I have extra bananas.

I cut the sugar to 1/2 cup and squished 2 of the bananas and finely chopped 2 other bananas and folded those into the cooling pudding mixture.  I poured them into cream cheese tart shells (from this site) and drizzled with melted chocolate. They were a HUGE hit at dinner!

I've tried this recipe 2x.  First time I used 2% milk and from reading some of the other reviews I decided to let it cook a little longer to prevent it from being runny.  Well it was the complete opposite and it came out very stiff. However, I didn't care for the taste either way.  So I tried it again put in a tad less sugar, 1 cup of 2% & 1 cup of heavy cream, 2 banannas, 1/2 tablespoon of vanilla, cornstarch in lieu of flour.  The mixture still didn't come out creamy, flavor was better,however, still a little sweet, overall not what I was hoping.  I will not be making this again.

This is FANTASTIC! I took the advice of another member, and used nilla wafers and butter for crust, and did not bake the pie. This is seriously the best banana cream pie I've ever had! OH, and I only used 2 bananas, that was plenty!

Oh my gosh!!! This pie is awesome!!!  I used the Pillsbury dough that you roll out, didn't bake it, used 3 bananas, used 1/2 cup sugar and 1/2 cup fat free half and half in place of 1/2 cup milk and topped with cool whip.  This is so good and SOOOOOOO easy.  This is definitely a keeper.

I cut the recipe in half and made it in a small 6" cake pan as I only wanted 4 servings with no leftovers. Its a little sweeter than I like, but was a nice smooth consistency. Used cornstarch instead of flour and whole milk. Have used lowfat milk milk in similar recipes and it sets up fine...just make sure you cook it a little longer. Used the nilla wafer crust for the first time- may try graham cracker crust next time

I wasn't really impressed with this pie. While it was good, it wasn't great and it was sort of plain and heavy. If you're looking for something quick to make for dessert, this would be a good choice if you aren't worried about making an impression.

This recipe was DELICIOUS!  I followed the original version , using the flour, the only change I made was that I didn't bake it.  It was perfectly smooth and yummy.  For those that have complained about brown bananas, you should slice the bananas into the pie shell AFTER you have made the pudding so you can pour it right on top and then you won't have a problem.

The pie was scrumptious.  I would use a little less sugar then what it calls for and I have found that when it is baked it doesn't set as well.  It is the first desert that goes when at a party.  Will definitly make it again

This pie is just awesome!  The custard type filling is *wonderful*.  My kids gobbled it up :-).  I served it with whipping cream on top.  I did find it a little on the sweet side and I would recommend cutting the sugar back from 3/4 cup to 1/2 cup (or to taste).  Try this pie and you won't be disappointed!!

This recipe for the sinful Banana Cream Pie is quite a tasty one.  The only complaint I have is that it doesn't keep very well over night, even when kept cool.  So, if you plan on making this, be ready to eat it all too in one night!  It is quite yummy. Ja!

The original recipe is a little sweet, but just add a little less sugar & it should be fine.  Easy to make!

Complete waste of money and time! Followed instructions/measurements to the T. Came out soupy and basically inedible. How about we give out clear directions or correct measurements so people don’t waste their time and money making this!!!

Great Banana Cream Pie - I have made a few times.  The only change is I needed to add a bit more flour to thicken.  I discovered this after making  it the first time and it was soupy.  Since then?  Terrific!

The note at the bottom for baking was just for the crust prior to putting the bananas and filling in it.  Don't bake it with the filling in it.  So it's kind of backwards LOL.  Otherwise it's great.

I had fortune cookies left over from lunar new year. Mixed with melted butter don’t even need the food processor just the mallet (an excellent way to get rid of tension) and makes a super crunchy crust. I had ancient frozen bananas and fr sh organic. This is just too easy and delicious!!!

Banana Cream SOUP in a pie shell!!!  Used corn starch and followed the recipe exactly and let the pies cool in the fridge overnight.  They never set.  What a waste of time

No changes to recipe itself, but did do a meringue for the topping.  Custard was wonderful and thick.  It did take a long time with constant stirring to get it to the right consistency, but worth it.

This was absolutely delicious! I used the cornstarch instead of flour and about 3/4 Tbsp of vanilla based on some reviews and it was awesome. However, the custard seemed to set, and I assembled the pie as directed after everything was very cool, refrigerated it for a few hours, it all looked fantastic...and set it out on a dessert table (it was a potluck). By the time dinner was over and we went to desserts the entire pie was more like soup! I was mortified. We had to get a serving spoon because it couldn't be served with the pie server. Everyone assured me it was still delicious (I tried it, it really was) but what the heck happened?! So embarrassing!

I really liked this recipe. I'm glad flour is used instead of cornstarch; it thickened it far better. One problem I encountered; some of the bananas turn a grayish hue and tasted bitter on the sides; they weren't overripe before I put them in so I'm not quite sure why they turned out that way. Overall, though, it was pretty good!

Since I didn't have time to read all the reviews (and I read quite a few), I decided to leave a review letting everyone know that I followed the recipe exactly, except I used Swerve, a sugar substitute. I even used Swerve confectionery sugar for the whipped cream. The diabetic I made this for just loved it!!

For myself, this was mediocre at best. I followed suggestions and cut the sugar to a half cup, but it was still too sweet for me. I also made a crust of vanilla wafers and 6T of melted butter., baking for 5 minutes at 350 degrees and then let cool. The crust stuck like cement to the pie place, and I nearly needed a crowbar to get a slice of pie. I also did not bake the pie as suggested in the actual recipe. Rather, I just popped it into the fridge and let it set overnight. However, I began thinking about the fact that by not baking the entire pie, I was essentially eating raw eggs and that kind of grossed me out, not to mention the possibility of getting sick from that. Anyway, the end result was not that great, to say the least, and I probably would not make this again.

I did, however, took the 1 1/4 t. vanilla, and split into equal parts of vanilla, almond, and banana extracts. 
Tasty!

This was a fabulous pie.  I followed the recipe exactly (used flour rather than the cornstarch option) except I DID NOT BAKE THE PIE.  Prebaked the crust, sliced the bananas with pouring in a small amount of the filling between each banana then topped with the rest of the filling.  The filling was silky smooth and just the right consistency.  Chilled in the fridge for 2 hours prior to serving, and the filling was firmed up just right.  I topped with fresh whipped cream.  Delicious!

Couldn’t fit 4 bananas in, only 3...and my OCD kicked in when it came to adding the bananas...I layered them, alternating with the pudding, starting and ending with the pudding.

Great pudding, smooth and not too sweet. One change I made for altitude (6000+ feet): I baked it for about 30 minutes. The suggested time left it soupy.

It was simple yet delicious. However, my bananas turned black in the fridge, despite them all being covered in the filling. I think I will add some lemon juice next time.

This was easy to make.  I followed the tips to use cornstarch instead of flour and to not bake the pie after adding the filling. The filling was smooth, rich and creamy. It was a bit sweet for our taste, so will probably decrease sugar to 1/2 cup next time. And there will be a next time - soon. :-)

Wow! This pie is absolutely fantastic. So much better than just making some instant vanilla pudding and plopping it into a pie shell. This custardy base kept its form and tasted delicious.

First time making banana pie. So far getting good reviews on it.

Followed other people advice

1. Cut the amount of sugar (i used 1/2 cup which i think is still slightly sweet. Suggest using maybe 1/3 a cup of sugar and a slighlty more)

2. Did not bake

3. Did not make pie crust. Bought the ones from trader joes which is a good value and taste pretty good. And bought some pans from daiso.

Very good, although next time I would mix the bananas in the pudding first. Otherwise I felt there were gaps under the slices that the pudding wasn't getting into. I made a graham cracker crust and therefore did not bake the pie.

I made it first time following the recipe as it is and it turned out great. Whole family loved it because we love custard.
The only change that I would make the next time maybe to reduce the sugar slightly because with the banana it is very sweet. But other than that the recipe is great, easy to follow

I made this exactly as written. Only change is that I used 2% lactose free milk. Flour is fine to use if you do it properly. Delicious and easy. Homemade cream pudding is not a quick thing. That's what Jello pudding mixes are for.  If you want homemade taste, it takes time. Excellent recipe.

This is delicious. I used a store bought pie crust and baked it with rice on top, to keep it from puffing.  Then used  3 T of corn starch instead of flour. I also stirred the bananas into the cream mix once it was done cooking. Then I topped with a meringue that I made from the whites of the eggs I used, and baked it another 10 minutes with the meringue on top, to brown it.   II was so delicious!  I even forgot  to add the butter at the end, and it was still yummy.

I used a vanilla wafer crust, corn starch as recommended and folded the sliced bananas into the hot pudding mix after adding the butter and vanilla which I think adds more of a banana flavor to the pudding.  A little different finished product but it came out really good.

Admittedly my bananas were on the large side but this recipe was way too much for a single 9in crust that I bought frozen at the store. Luckily I had baked second crust and threw together a (frozen blueberry) pie.

Note: If you don't bake, as per the most popular recommendation, the pie will not present well! It falls sloopy. 
:( And I think maybe the bananas will brown faster? In any case, leaving it overnight without baking will make the banana brown faster. Overall, I liked it. Not too sweet. Good recipe.

Love this recipe so easy used cornstarch as others stated and did not bake crust sprinkled with chocolate swirls and was a hit. I just wanted to add that I made this so many times now and just love this recipe.  I now put a whipped topping on pie that is 1 c of whipping cream and 2 tsp of sugar whip until stiff and place on top.

Awesome pudding/pastry cream recipe! I followed the other users suggestions as follows. Reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup, used 3 tablespoons of cornstarch instead of the flour. And I did not bake it! I blind baked the pie crust, put the sliced bananas on the bottom, then spread the chilled pudding/pastry cream on top. Served with whipped cream. So delicious!!!

The reason I gave this pie a 5 stars is because this is not the first time I have made it. 
I love the pudding that it makes, and my Grandson Liam loves it as he puts it I loves this pie Nana.
Enjoy

This was perfect! I baked the graham cracker crust since others said the pudding was runny. It wasn’t for me. We made sure it was well cooked so maybe boiled it a couple minutes longer.

Substituted 3 T. corn starch for flour and did NOT bake pie.  Other than those changes I followed the recipe and cooking directions.  Fantastic pie!!  Very smooth and creamy texture.  This is my new go to banana cream pie recipe.  Had to give it 4 stars due to the changes.  Everyone will tell you to never use flour in cream pie/pudding.

I only used 1/3rd cup sugar.

Also, I added 2 bananas, mushed, directly to the custard after adding the eggs and cooking for 2 minutes. Fantastic pie.

This is the second time making this pie.  This time I had to use a prepared crumb crust (I chose Oreo) as my oven is broken.   I used 3 tablespoons of corn starch instead of the flour, it's just more reliable.  For those having trouble setting up, keep cooking, keep stiring, be patient, you will know when it is done when it starts to look like pudding. I do not see the need to bake, it set up fine in the fridge.  My guests loved it!

I cut the sugar to ½ cup but otherwise I followed directions and ingredients as written.  I used the egg whites and made a meringue for the top.  (3 egg whites. 3 T. sugar, ¼ tsp. cream of tarter, pinch of salt) and cooked the meringue for 10 minutes at 400).  After cooling the pie set up very nicely.

I prefer a banana taste to the pudding in addition to the bananas themselves; this was quite bland. I will not make this again but I will look for a better recipe instead.

I reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup the first time I made it, and followed the recipe the second time.  We prefer the lower sugar version. 
I whisked the filling in a steel mixing bowl over boiling water. The instructions for cooking times made this the easiest and  the best result of any previous recipe I've used.
I used my own recipe for the pie crust.
Note:  A clear vanilla would improve the color; the brown vanilla makes it slightly gray.

Honestly, I don't know what happened here. I consider myself a far-above-average pastry/pie chef, and I've never had a pie fail like this. I made this for Christmas and used 3T. of cornstarch instead of the flour, as stated in the Cook's Notes. I followed the directions to a "t". The pie was a runny mess. My kids tried it and said it tasted okay, but it wasn't fit to serve and I had to toss the entire thing.

Wow! Again with the composition of a recipe. For someone that has never made homemade pudding before it's an absolute MUST to cook the pudding until thickened. A person should NOT have to rely on reviews to learn how to make the recipe that was hurriedly composed. There are too many on here that you have to read reviews in order to prepare it properly and this one is no acception. 
DO NOT BAKE THIS PIE! You will ruin it completely. Take your time to let the pudding thicken on the stovetop(unless the laws of physics cease to exist in your kitchen and 2 minutes is enough time) and pour it over the bananas and press plastic wrap on the top (to not form a skin) and refrigerate until set. It only takes a couple of hours to set if your fridge is on the proper setting.
I took a suggestion and made vanilla wafer crust and and baked it in a 350 degree oven for 15 - 20 minutes until golden brown. 5-10 minutes is not long enough for a homemade crust.

I have been baking and cooking for more than 40 years and I will tell you this pie is the BOMB!!  I like to try everything as it is written first, and I did with this recipe.  Contrary to some I did use flour , it was perfect!  I was sure to use whole milk, and homemade whipped cream.  I also made a Nila wafer crust and I baked the pie in the crust as the recipe calls for.  I definitely sets it up and some say you don't have to bake the wafer crust but doing so also sets the crust and makes it hold together.  I covered and chilled the pie (toothpicks lifting the wrap over the cream filling). It was absolutely amazing!  I served this for a family holiday and everyone was very pleased with it.  Compliments galore!  I will definitely be making this again.

As others have stated this is the best pudding recipe. It is delicious. I used cornstarch instead of flour. Also used Chef Johns pie crust recipe. With fresh whipped cream it was a big hit!

Made exactly as recipe stated.  It never firmed up. Even baked an additional ten minutes but still never firmed II. After several hours in the fridge it didn’t firm up,   So I put it in the freezer for several hours.   We took it out frozen and ate some.  Went back into the kitchen and it had thawed and was once again the texture of banana cream soup.   I would forgo this recipe and try a different one next time, gave 2 stars instead of 1 because it at least tasted good.

I made the pie with no changes from the recipe except I added two teaspoons of vanilla (maybe needed because I used fake vanilla). The pie was excellent. Baking the pie made the filling firmer and made it perfectly shaped when it was cut. There was no skin on the top. Be patient when heating the vanilla pudding filling; use a thick pot, too high a heat will cause the filling to burn before coming to temperature. Everyone raved about the pie, I used the blender pastry method (Allrecipies) for a perfect melt in your mouth crust. Don’t use a pre-made pie shell, the little bit of extra work really makes the difference! (For the food processor pie crust, for a single crust, I added 4 tablespoons of water to make it easier to roll out, but I weighed the flour or accuracy - 130 grams of flour per cup.) Put the empty crust in a 350 degree oven for about 20-25 minutes - very Iight golden color.

I made this for Thanksgiving and the Costco pies we bought weren’t even touched before this one was all eaten. It was soooo good and pretty simple. Plus the filling recipe would make a pretty good stand-alone vanilla pudding recipe. It calls for basic ingredients you have around the house anyway, and we don’t keep much for baking. Highly recommend.

This pie was amazing! I swapped out the flour for the 3 TBS of cornstarch. I also used 1 tsp of banana extract instead of the vanilla, because we love banana pudding in our house. I also made a vanilla wafer crust. I will definitely make this again!

The flavor is terrific. My pie did turn out runny, which was pretty disappointing considering I made it the one time I had guests over for Thanksgiving. I thought I followed the directions meticulously, including baking the darn thing, but now based on a recent review I see where someone noted that cream pies should be baked. I'm stubborn enough that I'll try to make this again, will try cornstarch next time, but I might even mashed the bananas and spread them on the bottom of the crust - I love graham crackers but will try Nilla wafers next time. I might even blend the mashed bananas into the cream mixture.

This pie is SO delicious.  I used 3 bananas instead of 4 and used banana extract instead of vanilla.  I used the flour (not cornstarch) for thickening.  I topped it with a layer of whipped cream (confectioner sugar and vanilla added). The pie was gone in a matter of hours.  This is a favorite recipe requested by my husband for special occasions.

The custard was outstanding!  Next time I will cut back a little on the sugar. As someone suggested I used the egg whites for a Meringue topping baking at 350 till browned and omitting the baking instructions in the recipe.  I’ll be making this again.  Thx

This is a great recipe! I use the corn starch option and don’t bake it. It’s amazing with a graham cracker crust. WARING: a store bought banana cream pie will never be good enough ever again.

I’m not sure if it was my error but my custard did not set up well. It seemed perfect coming off the stove and was delicious. After leaving in the fridge overnight, it was still a pudding the next day. The flavor of the pie was outstanding but the “pieces” were just piles on our plates.

The custard definitely thickened, almost too much for me, though I heated/stirred it for more than 5 mins. It was so thick I couldn't tap it flat once in my graham cracker shell, which was tasty. Let rest overnight instead of cooking and omg it was good. Gotta eat it chilled. Would reduce sugar a lot more though. My bananas were way overripe but it was fine.

I made it and doubled the recipe used half amount of sugar and added honey instead. Made a nice pastry shell to go with it and topping it off with whipped cream and dusted with honey graham crumbs. And few slices of banana. I also made one with cocoa powder mixed in with the egg yolks and cooked it and baked. Turned out great.  I coated slices with lemons to prevent them from Browning and added just enough tartness to even out the sweetness.

Calls for way too many sliced bananas to put in the crust before filling with the custard.  I'd recommend 1 medium size sliced banana at most. Also, the volume of the filling ingredients was too much, and I had to leave out a cup or so of custard.

Made with the cornstarch option. Wouldn't recommend.

This is my second time making this recipe and my family LOVES it! I did make 2 adjustments though. 1) I did not bake this pie...I just baked the crust and speaking of the crust....2) I make a great made from scratch and hand rolled crust but I wanted something different and something that helped saved time as both times that I've made this I've made it for a birthday party. I put enough Nilla wafers into a food processor to make 1 and 1/2 cups crushed Nilla Wafers and then mixed in 6 tablespoons melted butter and then pressed it into the pie dish and baked it for 5 minutes at 350 degrees. I also always make my own whipped cream to top the pie with before serving.

I added about a half to a 3/4 cup crushed almonds that had been coated in coconut on top of the bananas under the pudding. My roommates absolutely loved it! This is the first time I've strayed from fruit pies (apple, cherry, strawberry, etc), and it was a smashing success! They want me to make more it was so good.

I changed it up a bit and put blueberries in instead and the filling takes awhile to cook but is totally worth the wait! 
Also, don't forget to prebake the crust VERY important lol

The taste would have been spot on, if it ever thickened!! I was going with gluten free so i used cornstarch, but 3 tablespoons is nowhere NEAR enough!! I am going to try this recipe again, but this time double, maybe even triple the cornstarch.

This was a big hit at my house.  Many thanks to other reviewers who made valuable suggestions.  
I used corn starch as a thickener.  It thickened up nicely.  Don't stop cooking the custard based on the recommended times; mine took a lot longer to thicken.  Stop cooking when the custard is thick.  If you're unsure, it probably isn't done cooking.
I cut back the sugar to 1/2 cup, as others suggested.  This was a birthday pie for my boyfriend, who isn't a big eater of sweets.  Next time, I will use 3/4 cup, since I have more of a sweet tooth.I used a full Tb of vanilla, and I'm glad I did.  I would have liked to use some banana extract, but I couldn't find it locally.
I used a store-bought pastry crust.  Next time I make this pie (and there will be a next time), I'll try a vanilla wafer crust.

I MADE NO SUBSTITUTIONS TO INGREDS!  Because I was making this for a friend with corn allergies, I was determined to not use cornstarch. Yes I know I could have subbed potato or tapioca starch but I've found in the past they affect the texture a bit  more than cornstarch. Having read the warnings about the pie being soupy I was scrupulous about getting the custard/creme over 170 degrees for 2 full mins at end of milk sugar flour stage, and another full 2 mins after tempered eggs added. I DID NOT BAKE! I put the pudding in fridge to cool with saran wrap atop too cool a couple hours. Then I did thin layer of pudding into crust, then sliced one banana atop that, then mixed more banana into the custard. I then put saran wrap on tightly, being sure no air was between it and custard by gently pressing. The next a.m I topped with slightly sweetened home made whipped cream. I made Graham Cracker Crust No 1 on this site, and a "Best Nilla Wafer Pie Crust" found on web. I found the crusts a bit sweet and would reduce sugar slightly next time. I also might consider a smidge reduction of sugar in custard if I can get away with it.  For a first attempt at this, it did not let me down and I got compliments on it.  Slices cut fine though not the stiff shape one might get if using added starch. I'd like to experiment with various recipes to find one I like a little better texture wise (I might try the cornstarch adaptation when not limited by friend allergy) but this is definitely a keeper!

Used 3 tbsp of cornstarch instead of flour and whole milk.
Mashed 2 bananas and placed on the bottom of crust, a layer of filling and then stirred remaining sliced bananas into filling and added to top of pie. Refrigerated and added cool whip upon serving.  The secret is patience and the length of time of constant stirring.  Don't be in a hurry to be done.

I did the same as Kate Finkenbiner suggested- instead of a  traditional pie crust, I made a crust out of nilla wafers and butter.  This made this pie over the top!  I will never make a banana cream pie in a regular pie crust again.  Excellent recipe!!  Also- like Kate suggested, do not bake this pie- only bake the pie crust.  Delicious!!!

Not my favourite type of pie but made it for others that like it and they thought it was good.  Certainly easy enough and the custard is very easy and flexible I am sure it could be the base for a lot of cream pies.

I used 3tbsp cornstarch instead of flour as suggested. I used whole milk and stirred on the stove until it seemed the right consistency—longer than the suggested time. I made a vanilla wafer crust, home made whipped cream and didn’t bake. The whole family (including a picky eater) LOVED it!!!!

The first time I made this recipe I made the mistake of using 2% milk, didn't set up and was soupy. Second time I used 1 cup half and half and 1 cup whipping cream and it turned out nice and thick and tastes great. I also used cornstarch instead of flour. You really have to be patient while waiting for the milk mixture to thicken, I put the sugar, salt and cornstarch in the pan and turned the heat on low while I whisked the cream in. Stirred constantly for probably 10 minutes until it was nice and thick then added the egg yolks. After it was completely done cooking I let it cool while I sliced bananas and mixed them with a splash of orange juice to prevent browning. Haven't actually tried the pie yet but it looks great and I bet it will taste even better!

This was easy & delicious! We used a graham cracker crust because that’s our favourite & added whipped cream on top. As the bananas ripen a bit, it does get sweeter: I suggest using the full amount of sugar if eating the day you make it, but if it’s going to sit overnight, you can decrease the sugar a bit.

Meh. It didn't have nearly enough banana flavor. It tasted like a vanilla pie with a few pieces of banana. I will definitely be searching for a banana cream pie that uses BANANA pudding.

Made this for my parents for my dad's birthday and we all loved it! I followed others' advice and didn't bake it. If you have the time, I recommend making the crust by hand; I found a recipe for a Nilla wafer crust and it made the whole thing that much better. Whipped cream and chocolate shavings on top are also a nice touch. I think the key to getting the banana flavor to permeate the pudding is to let it refrigerate overnight; it turned out nice and banana-y when I did.

It is both very unhelpful to potential bakers and unfair to the poster of this recipe for people to recommend changes to a recipe that they've never tried on the basis of the fact that they think they know better.  In reading the "most helpful positive review" (among others), I became very worried about how to prepare this pie.  Should I listen to these fellow reviewers, or should I trust in the poster who felt confident enough in their recipe to show to the world?  At least one reviewer pointed out that this is not a pudding recipe, but a style of French cream, and so it would be made differently than pudding.

In the end, I decided to try the recipe as written without any changes before attempting any other versions.  I am SO SO glad that I decided to ignore the "helpful" reviews.  

This pie is un-freaking-beleivably GOOD!!! I've never had such a ridiculously wonderful banana pie before.  My husband, who is a self-described banana cream pie connoisseur, didn't speak while eating it AT ALL, and went back for seconds before declaring "this is very good... very very good". My father in law calls it superb and he's something of a culinary artist himself.  

Follow the directions.   Follow them carefully and make no changes.  You'll be fabulously rewarded by your efforts.  

To clarify: the recipe says to stir your sugar, flour ( I did use flour, not corn starch), salt, milk mixture until bubbly, then stir for two minutes more.  By my estimate "until bubbly" was roughly 10 minu

I followed the recipe but listened to the other reviews and did not bake and I used  3 T cornstarch instead of flour. My husband LOVES banana cream pie and this was my first go at it. He ate 2 slices within 5 minutes. It passed the test! I also made the filling and refrigerated it separately for about 2 hours. Then I cut up banana slices and added them to the bottom of my already cooked and cooled pie crust. Then added filling and refrigerated for about an hour. It was delicious. I think next time I’ll try a wafer crust and see which is better.

It can thicken fast so STIR, STIR, STIR!!!!!! Excellent recipe 1st time around for a first timer with a cream pie of any sort.  Used cornstarch like most; sets quick as a flash! 
I did mix the bananas into the custard, and didn't bake it afterward.  Just let it set, once cooled, topped with real whip cream, and Boom!  Boyfriend was sold!   YUM!!!  
Now he wants a coconut cream... LOL! 
One note/suggestion: if you top it with whip cream, you should mention how much is needed etc, and if it's meringue, that recipe should be included too.  Most I read left off that part and it's not complete without one or the other.  Thanks!  Great Recipe! My definite go to!!

This was very easy to make. I used the cornstarch instead of flour and made sure there was a decent boil going before I started counting the minutes. I made a homemade Nilla pie crust to put the filling in, and did not bake the filling as others have advised. It was delicious. I will definitely make this again.

This was my first attempt at a Banana Cream Pie and it is delicious and so surprisingly easy.   The only change I made was I used the cornstarch method rather than flour and did not bake the pie,  just refrigerated.  I used some freshly baked sugar cookies that I crushed along with melted butter for the crust.

I agree with coating the pie crust with egg before baking. It helps keep it from getting soggy once you add the pudding. My pudding didn’t get very firm. It wasn’t runny but not the prettiest when cutting a slice.

I made this pie using many of the reviewers notes.  Still the custard in this recipe was very thin.  I added 4 tablespoons of Corn Starch.  The flavor was very good.  I added 1/2 a mashed banana to the custard.  I used 1/2 cup half and half and 1 1/2 c. whole milk. I cooked the custard for 15 minutes.

Also, the custard recipe should be doubled.  I used two sliced bananas.

The taste was delicious, but the consistency was not firm enough.  I had substituted 3 TBS of cornstarch for the  1/2 cup of flour.  Next time I will use 4+ TBS of cornstarch.  Also, I used extra large egg yolks which might have added to the looseness.

The "pudding" part of this recipe can be used for lots of things. For example, I had some extra, so I mixed it with rice and made some delicious rice pudding. Get creative!

Basics are good. Custard does not need the amount of sugar suggested- I cut it by a third. I did need far more corn flour to get a thicker mix. Using what was suggested my cream would never have thickened on its own.  I also did not bake due to the possible formation of a skin.

This turned out amazing! I am NOT a baker of any sort and have a bad tendency of ruining everything I bake, haha. I used Stevia baking sugar instead of regular sugar, and used Silk Almond instead of regular milk. You can honestly use any type of milk, that's not what is making it runny. The mixture will get runny if you don't cook it long enough  and let it cool before adding it to the pie shell. I only baked mine for about 6-7 mins and it didn't dry it out. Happy baking!

I made this recipe as stated using corn starch instead of the flour EXCEPT that I followed the reviewers suggestions to not bake the pie.  The taste was delicious!  My husband and children all loved it.  However, it held its shape terribly (it had been refrigerated for about 8 hours prior to serving).  I'd have been quite embarrassed had I been serving it to company.  Just like pudding... actually, probably worse than pudding -  I scooped out the first "slice" and the rest just melted together to fill in the space of the missing slice.  Not at all what I imagined.  I didn't want the film on it that reviewers said would have formed had I baked it, but now I'm wishing I had tried.  Oh well.  Still scrumptious!

O gosh! I think I ruined it! I followed the recipe w out reading the tweaks, and mine came out completely soupy. After baking, it will be a miracle if it sets in the fridge. Terribly disappointing that I hadn't read the reviews and that people give five stars when so many changes must be made.

I can't stop making this! 

I prefer graham cracker crust, I goes so well with it.. store bought for convenience. Also top with homemade whipped cream. 
Do not bake it, just set it aside to cool. Also lightly toss sliced bananas in teaspoon of fresh lemon or lime juice will prevent oxidation and keep bananas fresh looking for days.. if the pie lasts that long. :)

Absolutely delicious and was easy to prepare. I followed the recommendations of other reviewers and decided not to bake and it was very good. I think I will try baking it next time just to determine if it makes any difference.

Good recipe. I agree with other reviewers that it is too sweet. I used cornstarch instead of flour. I made a pie crust and topped it with whipped cream and sliced almonds. I will make it again, but will add less sugar and cook the pudding a couple minutes longer.

The way this recipe is written is asinine. It throws basic cooking 101 out the window and that's why many people are getting soupy pies. With that said, the recipe is a basic pastry cream....it's pretty good, when cooked correctly. 

Let me tell you how to properly make the cream. 

The author suggests using cornstarch, which I agree with. However, dumping dry cornstarch in a pan and pouring cold milk over it is not how to activate cornstarch.  You have to make a slurry, which is even how the cornstarch directions tell you to use their product.  

So the change to the recipe....
Add your milk, sugar and salt to a pan and bring to a very slow boil, stirring so it doesn't foam. Add a splash of cold milk to a plastic cup and dissolve your cornstarch in it....a la slurry.  Set aside. 

Once your milk is to temp, start whisking and slowly pour in your slurry.....the milk will INSTANTLY start to thicken. Because you used the cornstarch correctly, this will drastically cut down cooking time and completely get rid of soupy pies.  Continue cooking as instructed and your cream will become the consistency of pudding. 

As another side note to people who are getting gummy pies....fill your pie shell with pastry cream and refrigerate before you add the whipped cream. As soon as you fill your shell, cover the pie with plastic wrap, but cling the wrap directly to the pastry cream literally sealing the cream and making it air tight. This will prevent the film forming that never feels good in

CAUTION: The filling is very tasty, but EXTREMELY runny and liquidy. I suggest using a different recipe for that part but the rest of the recipe is great! Freezing it kinda of helped but made it icy.

Very good but WAY TOO much sugar...anymore and it will taste so awful you don't want to eat it. I would try 1/2 a cup of sugar or even less. If you cut the pie into 8 pieces that is 1 and a half tablespoons of sugar per piece.

Absolutely delicious, my family was searching the fridg for leftovers!  I will never use store bought pie crust again but did so because of time.  The pudding was rich and held its' shape when sliced.  Make sure to cook it long enough and it won't be runny.  Thanks for the suggestion for the bananas, they did turn brown and looked a little unappealing but overall this was a huge success!

Very easy, turned out beautifully and yummily, too. I used skim milk, so decreased the amount by 1/4 cup.  Will make again.

I used cornstarch.  But the major change I made was, I added a mashed up very ripe (but still creamy) banana to the hot mixture, after the butter and vanilla!  YUMMY!  Ate half of it before it ever got to the pie.  I gave it four stars because I changed it a lot but the result is definitely FIVE STARS!

I made this recipe exactly as it was written and it came out great.  In fact I plan to use it again just for the custard part. It was delicious.

Yummy pie! I used the egg whites with cream of tartar, vanilla, and sugar to make a meringue then baked the pie for 25 minutes at 325.  Turned out really well.  Use whole milk in the pudding to keep it from being runny.

Great recipe!  I use this to make vanilla pudding as well if I'm not up to making and baking pie crust.  However, the one change I make is that I don't bake the pie.  Just put in the bananas and pudding into the cooked shell and let it cool in the fridge until I want to serve it.

Made just as described (with corn starch option instead of flour) and baked for 12 minutes as listed in the steps. It was perfect. Thanks!

Its so easy and delicious... I used real whipped cream after and even put a few dotted chocolate chips on top of pie and a few on plates with a swirl of chocolate syrup to make  the plate look elegant. Its a hit, you really can not go wrong. 
I used cornstarch instead of flour, added a couple of drops of yellow food color to give it a bit of color and my foodie guests were really  impressed.

This was the worst pie ever!  I wasted my time making it for a Valentine's gift for my husband (his favorite)and it spoiled my special gift.  I should have known not to choose one that got baked.

This was so so so tasty!  I made it with only 3 bananas and used cornstarch as noted.  I would reduce the sugar for my personal taste, but otherwise, the flavour was amazing.  I did bake it for 12 minutes, just so the custard set up but not so it developed a tough skin.  I chilled it in the fridge for 45 minutes, topped with whipped cream and a sprinkle of crushed pecans for texture, and chilled for another 15.  The bananas were perfectly cooked without getting mushy, and chilling with the whipped cream further softened the skin.  This was the perfect texture and flavour - the best banana cream pie I've had.  I HIGHLY recommend this recipe!

What an absolute perfect recipe for Banana Cream Pie.  I read about 300 reviews and became a bit worried this would turn out runny.  This was my first attempt and I can state unequivocally that this is the best ever banana cream pie.  Mine firmed up perfectly and tasted wonderful.  I may enter this pie for the state fair next fall.  Fantastic, easy and delicious.  Thank you Ruby!  We all loved this one and it will be my go to pie recipe from here on out.

I made ithe pudding as written and layered it between Nilla Wafers and sliced bananas (2). It was great! Not too sweet, which most of those recipes with condensed milk and instant pudding very often are. Will make again.

I used Splenda in my recipe, and thought others might like to hear how that turned out.  As I have to watch my sugar intake, I tried replacing 1:1 Splenda for sugar.  I put the splenda, milk, salt and cornstarch together onto the stove, as recommended by ellie may.  I  was cautious about stovetop cooking with Splenda, so started on low, but after stirring for about 45 minutes, finally gave up and turned the heat to medium.  Next time I'll just cook on medium as in the original recipe.

Used 3 rounded tablespoons of cornstarch (added that extra since I knew I'd get no thickening from sugar) instead of flour as others have recommended.  Also cooked for 4 minutes beyond the bubbling point.  Did not bake; just added the pudding onto the sliced bananas and chilled in fridge with saran wrap, as recommended by ellie may. Great success, would totally do this again with Spenda.

This is my nephew's and my first time making pie at all! We loved this easy and creamy recipe!! We will definitely make it again. :)  We did mash up a whole banana and add it to the mix and then added another banana on top as decoration. It turned out great!

I made this in those little premade mini gram cracker crust. There was just the right amount of pudding mix for a dozen. They where really good. But I found the pudding a little too sweet, so next time I will put a little less sugar.

Excellent recipe on its own. I did follow the advice of one commenter and added 3T of corn starch to the sugar and flour before cooking.  I made one banana crime and one coconut crime using the same pudding mix.  Delicious!

Okay so first off I made this with a prepared Nilla Wafer Tin and everyone LOVED IT. 

It's a good recipe,  I overpoured a smidge with the vanilla and I could really taste it in the pie, for that reason I gave it four stars, a little too vanilla-y other than that it came out beautifully. 

Before pouring the cream I lined the entire bottom of the pie Tin with banana slices, I added some to the top before baking and that was a mistake, the banana slices looked brownish black once cooked. 

I would dress it up once baked with some pricks of Whipped Cream to cover the top! 

Tip: you may not need the full amount of bananas, my Tin was rather small and I had plenty left over so If you want to make this but your a little short on bananas I say,
GO FOR IT ANYWAY!

This was an amazing recipe. I followed the suggestions of other reviewers and substituted 3 TBS cornstarch for the 1\3 cup flour, however I think if you like a more pudding like texture you might be able to use less. After refrigerating it was thick and custard like. I blind baked my pie crust at 350 for about 12 minutes and didn't bake the finished pie, just made sure that the custard reached 165 degrees F. It tasted wonderful, and fresh, so much better than using store bought pudding or instant pudding. Made this with my kids and it was their first banana cream pie, they are new fans, thank you so so much for sharing! I can't wait to make this for my mom!

This is delicious! I can't believe how easy it is... why didn't I discover this decades ago! No alterations. I did follow a poster's recipe for the pie crust and made my own with 1.5 cups of Nila Wafer crumbs (I pulverized in my mini food processor) and 6 table spoons of melted butter. Combined, pressed into pie pan, and baked 5 minutes at 350-degrees. I then let it cool for an hour. For the cream mixture I used the cornstarch as the chef suggest. See Chef comments for directions on that.

I had never made a Banana Cream Pie before so I wasn't sure how it was going to turn out.  I'm glad I read some of the reviews and comments to help me through it.  I didn't bake it but other than that I didn't really change anything. It ended up coming out pretty amazing, everyone liked it. I thought it may have been a little better with slightly less vanilla

Didn't make any changes.  I used skim milk and it worked great, I am a huge lover of banana cream pie and this one was probably the best I've ever had.  So so good!  I did use another reviewer's suggestion and made a wafer crust instead of the regular pie crust (vanilla wafers and melted butter) Everyone went crazy over it.

I made 4 for the restaurant.  I followed the directions to a T.  I made them and refrigerated for 24 hours.  I had to serve portions with a spoon because none of them "sat up".  They were real runny.  The flavor was good but we could've ate them using a straw.  I was very disappointed and embarrassed.

This is a great pie. Do not cook it after pouring the pudding into the shell. Make sure to pay attention to the cook times as you make the pudding. I have over cooked it and it becomes the consistency of glue.

This is the best banana cream pie recipe I have made. It is my son's favorite so I make them for his birthday and my family loved it. I took the suggestion of using corn starch instead of flour and the consistency was perfect. I also cut the sugar to 1/2 cup. This recipe can be used for a basic pudding. It went so fast I'll have to make two next time.

I give it 1 star because this recipe is sooooo sweet, too much sugar and its heavy. Second, it doesn't make sense to put in the oven after u put the filling because it will look dry. Also, I like to make healthy and yummy desserts, this one I couldn't eat it even my 13 month old boy didn't like it.

Make this's now!  I made is using "20" as the servings number and followed the recipe exactly, opting for corn starch over flour..  I made a crust out of Graham cracker, Nilla wafers and Coconut.  There's not one negative thing I, nor could any of the 15 people who had it can say about this dish.  Perfection.

Perhaps my bananas were a bit big; I used only 3 and it still seemed like too much banana and not enough cream.  I recommend putting only a single layer, no more than two layers, of bananas in the bottom of your pie crust.  Also, the quality of the bananas is important; don't use overripe bananas.  My bananas were overripe, and I used too many.  My cream was very thick and did not seal in all the bananas; the bananas turned black in the refrigerator making the dish very unappealing.  It tasted okay, but  cream could use more vanilla.  This dish needs to be eaten up quickly; the longer it sits in the refrigerator the more liquid separates leaving a soggy mess.  I recommend eating the pie completely within a couple of days, or it becomes unfit to eat.

My family loved this pie!  After reading the reviews,  I did make one change and that was to not cook the pie after adding the pudding on top of the bananas. I just refrigerated it then when cool topped with home made whipped cream.

Followed the directions to the letter except I only used 3 bananas. Four would have been too much. The filling set up perfectly and tastes delicious. Next time I will see what happens if I skip the baking step, as others have suggested.

What a great pie!  But I had to drop my review by one star because of the advice to bake the pie.  That's completely unnecessary and will hurt the quality of the pie.  The crust is cooked, the filling is cooked - no need to bake!  I used only two bananas, although that's just a personal preference.  I think I'll use a graham cracker crust next time because my husband likes those better.

The custard didn't firm up.  
I was confused by the directions and the comments. I put the pie in the oven and cooked it for ten minutes and pulled it from the oven because one of the commenters wrote not to bake the pie.
I liked the flavor but not the results.

I really wish I'd read some comments first time around! I totally failed my first pie attempt, so I made it again, quite successfully if I do say so. 

During the first pie experiment I would say the biggest mistake was 1. using flour. The next mistake was that I tried to follow the recipe's guideline on time for the filling, and it just wasn't long enough for it to achieve the right thickness. I also added about half a mashed banana into the filling to help thicken and add more flavor, and it ended up blending decently, but the filling turned a less aesthetic color. Once the filling was combined with the cut up bananas and crust it ended up tasting sort of bland - not enough variety. The filling was still pretty soupy so I ended up baking the pie. This did help the pie set a little, and then when refrigerated overnight it was firm enough to not be a total embarrassment. Baking it did turn the bananas inside an unappealing brown.

The second round I opted for the 3 tablespoons of cornstarch. Much better! It probably took a solid 20 minutes on the stovetop for my filling to look the consistency I wanted - I probably had it on lower heat than was necessary, but it turned out awesome. Didn't bake the pie, but just refrigerated it and made sure the filling was cool before putting it in the crust.

Easy recipe. If yours was too thin/runny then you didn't cook the custard long enough.  Must judge by the look rather than sticking to the two minutes.....

This pie turned out way too sweet. Maybe the problem was that I put in on a vanilla wafer crust. Next time I'm going to halve the amount of sugar. The pie itself had a good consistency. It turned out thick and creamy. Just make sure that the sauce is fully thickened on the stovetop. I used the cornstarch version of this recipe.  I baked it even though some users said not to do that because it will get a thick chewy skin on top. I barely had a skin at all and the texture did not differ from the rest of the custard. Baking it gives the pie a beautiful yellow glow. Also, make sure to serve it the same day. The bananas get brown pretty fast.

Used this recipe for the pudding to fill my pate a chouxs. Since I wanted a banana cream filling and the pudding is only vanilla flavored, I mashed a banana with some milk in a pan over low-medium heat and added it to the still-hot pudding after it was all said and done. I didn't strain it because it already tasted so good. Banana cream pate a choux... like bite-sized banana cream pie! Freeze the finished pastries for at least an hour and YUM.

I followed the recipe as it is, using corn starch instead of flour. Also, I did not bake it, as suggested by other reviewers. I chilled it for 5 hours and just tried it, it tasted delicious. The vanilla custard is very good and combined with bananas creates a very nice flavor.

Great recipe.!! 
thought it may seem as though there is too much sugar in the pudding, dont worry just follow the recipe

i changed a few things-on purpose and accident :)
1. i accidentally forgot the butter  and vanilla, but it made NO DIFFERENCE!! :)
2. since i forgot the butter, i didnt keep the pudding  on the stove for 2 extra minutes while the butter melted. and since it was already smooth, i took it off the heat right away
3. i baked it for about 30-40 minutes, on and off taking it out a checking for  solidness  (if thats a word) it was still liquid puddingy after  abt 1/2 an hr,so i left it in a bit longer and when i took it out, there was a thin film on the top so the pudding wouldn't spill out if moved too quick, but it was still puddingy. after cooling and refrigerating, it solidified and it was great. it probably took a long time to back cuz  a. there was a meatloaf in the oven or b. i didnt leave it on the stove for long engough

This is a great all-purpose cream pie filling. I took one star off however because I don't understand why it would require baking when the cooked filling is poured into a baked shell.  Unless you prefer a meringue topping  this seems like an unnecessary step. I also substituted 3 tablespoons of corn starch for the flour. I was generous with the vanilla as I really wanted a rich vanilla flavour.

I followed several other reviewers suggestions and used corn starch instead of flour (3 T as author suggested).  I also did not bake it.  It was very good, but next time I will mix the bananas with the pudding mixture (saving some pudding only for top).

This is the best banana cream pie. Although, I always make it with a vanilla wafer crust. This always puts it over the top.

Followed the advice of previous reviewers and did not bake.  I also reduced the milk in the recipe by 1/4 cup.   Taste was awesome.  Did not have a problem with the filling setting up with the changes I made.  Thanks for the recipe!

This pie was amazing! Used a graham cracker crust recipe found in this site and I couldn't believe how good it turned out. I couldn't stop licking the spoon after I scooped in the filling , it was just that good. Might try to make with a little less sugar next time to see how it turns out.

It was a denser and heavier pie than I wanted. The bananas  in the pie never cooked properly, I can't tell what went  wrong. The pie was tasty, but not  what I had hoped.

Recipe turned out wonderful. For those complaining of browned, cooked, bananas, you are supposed to let the pudding cool in the sauce pan, covering the top of the pudding with plastic wrap, to prevent a "skin" from forming.  You do this with ANY cream pie to keep the crust from becoming soggy and, in this case, cooking the bananas.  For those who ended with a runny mess, read the directions. The sequence  of ingredients and  timing are important. If it doesn't work, you're not good at it. Try another hobby.

This turned out fabulous.  I didn't bake as others suggested and I chilled in the fridge all day.  I'm going to make it again soon!  Update:  Aug 5 2016 and I'm still making this pie.  It's just hubby and I eating and so we get to have it two days in a row.  I don't change a thing with the recipe except I only use 2 1/2 bananas and I never bake it.  I just chill it all day.  The pudding is sooo good!  And yes, this is easy peasy lemon squeezy especially with Tenderflake ready-made pastry!

I tried to adjust this recipe per the reviews that said it was runny and added another tablespoon of flour. It  come out too thick. But still tasted great.  I also added a meringue before baking 12 minutes.

This recipe is great! Easy too! Definitely use the cornstarch instead of the flour and you will have a nice, firm custard. Don't forget though, that you still need to let it cook until it thickens up nicely (like thick gravy).  My only caveat with this recipe is the baking. I did not bake mine and I really don't think it is necessary. The custard is cooked and the pie crust is baked in advance, so you will just make your custard skin over, and I don't like that. Also, wait till it sets if you want to spread whipped cream on top, which I did and it was PHENOMENAL!!

Worked very well and was easy to do.  I added whipped cream on the top just to finish it off.  

One thing, I ended up with enough filling to make two pies.  Wonder how I could possibly have used it on for one.

I really like this recipe for two reasons:  1) it's easy to make; and 2) it tastes great.  I did not  make any changes to the recipe except I did not bake.  There is  no reason I can think of to put this into the oven.  It's great just the way it is.  The other thing I did was to use corn starch as the recipe author suggested.

Used 4 tbs of cornstarch instead of flour. No lemon/lime juice, but I layered filling, sliced bananas, pudding before refrigerating several hours. Layering stops browning of the bananas. No baking except 10 minutes on the Nilla wafer crust. Topped with fresh whipped cream and a sprinkle of crushed Nilla wafers. 5 stars from the folks who ate it.

Great banana flavor, but too sweet!  I made it with 2 large bananas and 1:1 half and half and 1% milk.  It took longer than anticipated for the pudding to set but t was a lovely texture once it did.  I prefer the kittencal version.

This does not need any changes. I used flour because I didn't have corn starch, and was worried it wouldn't be as good but was amazing!  I  mixed some milk into the flour before adding the sugar so that it was smooth. Added fresh whipped cream and toasted coconut to the top. I also followed the recipe and baked it for 12 mins,  and had no dried out layer on top.

I made this with only one change, I precooked the pie shell before filling.  You don't have to bake after filling it this way.  It is an excellent recipe. Great taste. Everybody loved it. Rich, but not too rich and very creamy with all natural ingredients.

I'm reading the reviews & you shouldn't have a "soupy" consistency. Something must be off in your measurements. The flour is what thickens it. You must CONSTANTLY STIR like the directions advise. TIP: use a wire whisk to stir!!! I made this exactly the way the recipe instructed. Only thing I did differently was bake it at 325° for 10 minutes. When I took it out of the oven I sprinkled crumbled Murray Vanilla Wafers on top. Then set it in the fridge to chill for 1 hour. Best pie I ever made! Darn near ate the entire filling before it even reached the crust, at first. LOL!

I will definitely be making this again. I followed the directions but used lactose free milk since I can't have dairy. Still was amazing! Best part was not worrying about the "dairy" aspect of the dessert. The only thing I need to figure out is how to keep my bananas from turning brownish the next day. YUMMY!

Made a double batch, for 2 pies
had made it with 1/2 c raw sugar, 1/2 c xyla, 1/4 tsp powdered stevia, to equal 1 1/2 c sugar, however, found that too sweet.  Was nice and thick, by using 6 T cornstarch.  Also, used whole eggs

I can't rate this for taste... as I gave away. However, the recipe's ease and results,  I rate at 5 star. I just need to remember not to garnish with fresh banana slices prior to baking, as they turned dark and I had to remove and cover up with whipped cream, where the gaps were. Also, I think it cries out for a meringue or whipped topping. I chose to do the latter. Hopefully my notes help  someone else.

I just made this pie and I have to say it was awesome.  I will say this.....DO NOT BAKE THIS PIE.  Make and bake the crust only. For those with a runny or thin pudding the key here is to be sure that it comes to a boil, remove from heat add yolks as instructed then boil again.  Then add butter and vanilla extract.  If the steps are not followed the chemistry will be off and the congealing will not happen.  Besides NOT BAKING THIS PIE I reduced the sugar to a half cup. I found it sweet enough for me and all that have eaten it so far.

Im one of the runny results.   I used corn starch and it was thick, not pudding thick but thick, when it was on the stove.  I followed directions exactly.  And it is as thin as water.... it was thicker before i put it in the pie crust... just awful.   The flavor is great... but it is inedible

One of my kids has a dairy allergy so I made this with almond milk and soy butter.  It worked out well, and all but one of five cleaned their plates. I just thought it was a touch too sweet. It was quick and easy to make, so I will make it again, but probably with less sugar

This was so good!  The only thing I changed was that I didn't cook it in the oven.  The pudding came out really thick for me and it tastes divine!  Yum!  I can't wait to eat it again tomorrow!  Top it with whipped cream for a real treat!

This didn't set the way it was supposed to, but ya know what? I didn't even care. It was so delicious I just spooned it into cups, put broken pieces of crust in it for decoration, then crumbled Nilla wafers on top. Served it like pudding. It's still frikkin delicious though so 4 stars for you.

This pie was very flavorful, but I chose to ignore the baking step based on some of the reviews. That was a mistake. The pie did not set well after prolonged refrigeration.
I will make this again, but I will stick to the full instructions!

Fantastic recipe!  Today was my first shot at making homemade pudding and yes, this one is a show winner!  Thanks to other reviewers, I used whole milk, cornstarch (making sure to cover the pudding directly to the surface with plastic wrap so there's no skin while it cools in the fridge - not baked), vanilla wafer crust and my personal touch.....my topping is a Cool Whip and vanilla pudding infusion - Yum!  It was a hit!!!

I made it exactly like the recipe said, it turned out great.  I did use a graham cracker crust instead of a baked pie shell. I've always preferred that over baked unless I make a fruit pie and not a cream pie.  With the pudding, just make sure you cook it long enough so it thickens before taking it off the stove or else it won't set the way it's supposed to.

It is runny and not a pretty pie. Suggest that the bananas be cut smaller so it cuts easier. It was very good, though.

DO NOT ATTEMPT. If you follow this recipe, what you end up with is a soupy mess that tastes fine but is so unpresentable that it's embarrassing. We've tried twice and checked the custard temp with a thermometer. This one simply doesn't set up.

I used raw sugar instead of white, the slight molasses flavor of raw sugar is perfect with bananas.  I changed the flour for cornstarch (3 Tbl).  I used the whole egg, after all the nutrients are mostly in the white.  I increased the vanilla to a Tablespoon. After step 1, I allowed the mixture to rest for 10-minutes before tempering the eggs. After adding the eggs I brought the mixture back up to simmer before timing the final 2-minutes of cooking.  I did not bake the pie after assembly. I placed wax paper on the assembled pie to keep a skin from forming.  Served with whipped cream (this one's not a recipe change, just a preference). The Graham Cracker Crust recipe on this website was perfect for the pie as altered above.

This recipe was absolutely delicious!! If I could give it more than  5 star I definitely would! I paired it with another pie crust from this cite and it turned out wonderfully! Although, I did take the other commenters' advice and chose not to bake it, instead I stuck it in the fridge for about 3-5 hours to let it set. And for those of you who had soupy pudding, you probably needed too cook it longer, need more flour, or didnt let it set long enough. Hope this helped!

First time making this pie. I added 1/2 tsp of banana extract. I used a pre-made pie shell to save time. Also put lemon juice on bananas to prevent browning. This pie is easy and tastes amazing.

This was my first time making this pie. I followed the recipe like it said but used cornstarch instead of flour and used less sugar. The flavor was good, but not sure why my pudding turned a greenish color as soon as I took it off the stove to add the butter and vanilla. Has this happened to anyone else? Any suggestion on how I can avoid this next time I make it?

I loved this pie! It was a big hit at a recent party, and I didn't forget the whipped cream on top :) I agree with other reviewers that this pie does NOT need to be baked after the filling goes in. I put it in the fridge for a few hours before serving, and it was perfect.

Thanks so much for the recipe! The vanilla pudding was sooooo good. I used 3 tbsp cornstarch instead of flour as suggested and it was perfect! It's very important to stir the pudding mixture constantly (don't get lazy!) or else the pudding can easily burn. Overall a great recipe. i will definitely make it again.

I made the pie yesterday. I did not bake it. It was very runny, and the consistency was gritty. After I had already chilled it I decided to bake it since it was so runny. Not much better.

This being my first time making banana cream pie, I didn't realize refrigeration for a few days was not an option. My poor bananas browned badly and the custard lost the amazing taste and somehow tasted watered-down and no longer sweet. I know this would be delicious if served immediately - that just wasn't possible in my hectic life. Next time I make banana cream I will be sure to serve immediately or same-day. #fail #womp Oh, and I did not bake or brown the top at all, because that is just silly. In my world we smother the thing in real whipping cream and call it good.

I love this recipe!  It is MUCH better than the box pudding mix.  I think step 4 is referring to the crust only.  DON'T BAKE WHOLE PIE - JUST CRUST

I made a double batch. It was very soupy (the bottom bananas ended up floating before baking, and it was soupy after chilling too), and a little floury, but I scooped it up into mugs with whipped cream and the boys loved it anyway. Barely fit in the 9 inch deep dish pie tin, with only one layer of bananas. I couldn't get four bananas in one tin without it almost overflowing.

I've made this pie twice.  The first time it was absolutely out of this world! Best banana cream pie I've ever had. It was so good that I served it at a dinner party. This time I made two - one with Splenda, and one with regular white sugar.  The one with Splenda had a funny taste to it, but it set up very nicely. The flavor could have been from the Splenda, but I've never had a funny taste from that. The sugar one was soupy, but I was told that it had a much better flavor than the other.  I don't know what I did wrong.  Maybe I didn't cook it enough?

Thanks to comments I didn't bake.  This is the FIRST time I have made pudding & I'm a senior!  I couldn't believe how easy it was.  Might use less sugar next time.  This was so much better than the ones using Jello pudding mix that I made when the kids were little.  Going to try cocoanut next time.

HELP! I made this pie with alterations (3tbsp corn starch, used whole milk, simmered milk separately before adding corn starch/sugar mixture, and simmered about 2 min after all ingredients were mixed). The mixture had a perfect creamy pudding consistency after it was done simmering. As recommended by other users, I didn't bake the pie. I let it cool about an hour before putting it in the fridge for 3 hours. The mixture never set!! It was a huge pudding-y mess. After 5 hours in the fridge, I brought the pie to room temp and baked it at 350 for 20 min (thinking maybe the original author was right). It did set up a bit, but only to a firm custard consistency. The pie is delicious, but an absolute mess. What did I do wrong? Did I not simmer enough before each addition?

I did make some slight adjustments based on other reviews, which were to reduce sugar to 1/2 cup, skip baking and use cornstarch instead of flour. Otherwise I prepared it as written and it came out divine! Banana Cream Pie is my dad's favorite dessert and he kept saying it was the best he has ever eaten. I topped it with whipped cream and used a homemade crust, and I will definitely be making this again!

Today is Father's Day 2014.  My husband loves banana cream pie and rice pudding with raisins.  I have lost my grandmother/mother's recipe for custard.  This one came through!! However, I am certain flour was never used so I used the 3 T of cornstarch and a little less sugar and no butter.  Also, I mixed/whisked the eggs in with the cold milk (2%) and then whisked into the dry ingredients with the burner on.  Don't give up, keep whisking, it will thicken. After a quick taste it was rated better than my rum sauce on the bread pudding for a pre-father's day dessert!  Boy is he spoiled.  (tomorrow back on greens - ha) I gave it a 4 because of my changes, which rated a 5.

Make sure you use corn starch instead of flower.  I mashed up a cup of bananas and tossed that in with the pudding when I added the egg yolks. This made it so tasty. I put bananas on the bottom then a layer of pudding then another layer of cut up bananas and another layer of pudding. Slid it into the fridge and let it cool and set. So can't wait. Licked the pudding bowl clean.

This recipe is made even better if you finely chop up some banana and mix it into the pudding just before you put it in the pie crust.

So easy!!  The most delicious banana cream pie I've ever had.  My family was delighted.  I will definitely try Kate's suggestion for the Nila wafer crust next time. For those of you with runny or soupy pie, try these two suggestions:  1. Have a cocktail before you cook.  2.  Try Schwans.com or run to Marie Callender's.  I am by no means a great cook and I found this recipe to be so easy.  Relax when you cook it should be fun!

This was so good and a huge hit with my family.  Due to lactose intolerance in my house, I used unsweetened original almond milk.  Other than that, I followed the recipe's ingredients with the flour, yolks, vanilla, etc. I skipped the baking as advised by other reviewers.  It was not runny at all!  Will def. be making this again!

Yum! Made tarts instead of oie, topped with fresh whipped creme. Did use a touch less sugar. Good vanilla pudding that works with the banana, not overpowering it.

Excellent, even though I forgot the vanilla (doh!).  I used corn starch as recommended in the notes above - 3 TBSP instead of 1/3 cup flour, as I agree that corn starch is better for puddings.  I also used crushed vanilla wafers mixed with 6 TBSP melted butter baked for 5 min at 350°F (recommended by another reviewer).  I didn't bake mine either, to avoid a rubbery layer. I will most definitely make this again, I can see that one would need to learn to gauge when to stop cooking the pudding mix. Mine could have been just a bit firmer, but it was firm enough that it did hold a pie shape (sort of sloughed a bit). Maybe baking it would have helped this. The bananas on the bottom added enough banana flavour that it wasn't apparent there wasn't any vanilla or banana flavouring in the actual pudding.  I only ended up using about two bananas.  I sliced enough to cover the bottom of the pie plate (before the pudding was added) and then served with a couple rounds on each slice.

This was amazing!  I loved that it as all from scratch.  It was easy to make and came out beautifully.  I did follow someone else's advice by adding a couple teaspoons cornstarch.

I made this pie this morning and it's so easy and tastes absolutely wonderful.I made it right by the recipe except I did add 2 tsp of starch in addition to the flour,I wanted to be sure my pie set up and I did not bake it either.Just to help it set up faster I put pudding in bowl with plastic wrap for about an hour before I assembled the pie.I was weary this would not be good and I was so wrong.I cut it tonight for dessert and it's beautiful and good,I topped with sweetened whipping  cream as I plated the pie,so go ahead and make this pie!It's spot on!Thanks for the great recipe.Happy girl in Ga.

This was so easy to make.  I adjusted the serving size to 12 for a deep dish pie.  I took note from the comments and used whole milk.  It turned out perfectly.  Thanks for this keeper.

I used this as a starter to make a chocolate banana Kona cream pie.  Here's what I modified: I made a chocolate graham cracker crust, then gave it a layer of chocolate ganash (always a good idea).  For the pudding, I first steeped one cup of the milk (I used whole) in coffee to give it an additional flava.  So glad I did!  It was awesome.  I arranged half of the bananas over the ganash layer, then mixed the other half into the pudding after it had cooked, and I also set aside some pudding without banana so I could spread that over the top so there was no banana exposed (so it couldn't turn brown).  When I was ready to serve, I whipped up some fresh cream to layer on top, then shaved some dark chocolate on top. Amazing!  Still banana-y, but with a twist.

I used the 3T cornstarch. I probably ended up cooking it on the stove a bit longer than what the recipe stated, but I didn't bake it again at the end. It turned out great! My family loved it!

I made this recipe because I had extra bananas and a store bought graham cracker crust on hand and thought it would be nice to try this for dessert.  The texture and flavor were excellent and everyone enjoyed it.  My only complaint is that the bananas turn brown within a day and it doesn't look as nice (but still tastes great).  Make sure to serve this same day...hopefully there won't be any leftovers.

Made lots of pies but never banana cream. Requested for a friend's birthday and it was excellent. Topped with slightly sweetened fresh whipped cream.  No other changes. Delicious.

Not sure about the soupy comments, mine didn't turn out soupy.  It was more of a jello/pudding consistency.  I would expect a cream pie to be much creamier.  The custard was a bit flavorless.  Ok, but wont make it again.

My family loves this pie, they insist I make it at every holiday!  I would advise you to try the recipe as written.  (Maybe bake it for 6 minutes if you concerned about a dry pie).  I like it better baked.

This banana cream pie is absolutely AMAZING!! The first time I made this unforgettable pie, my 4 year old son helped me make it. He loved the pudding mixture that we poured atop the sliced bananas and loved the banana cream pie even more! My husband also raved about it, and honestly, I have never tasted a pie so fresh and having my taste buds screaming for more. We made it again at Christmastime as a thankyou to my son's preschool teachers and all of them also raved about how "it is the most fresh-tasting pie I have ever eaten" (this is a quote from the preschool cooking teacher, who does not dish out compliments freely). I have made this pie a number of times now and am once again preparing it to share with others as this Easter Sunday's dessert. I am confident that it will please all tastebuds and have a feeling I'll be making it for years and years to come.

I would mark this recipe 1000 stars if I could!!! I made this today, and it turned out perfect! This is the first pie I ever made, and followed some recommendations of previous reviews, like using cornstarch or omitting the baking. If you are looking for a sweet pie recipe, this is definitely IT.

I've never made this before. Mom said I should pre-bake the pie crust (plain crust, @ 400, 10 minutes, gently pricking crust bottom & sides w/ a fork beforehand) so I did. Cooled it, used two small bananas (just starting to spot) and one seemingly large, mutant banana not quite ripe (half green/half yellow) Lined the bottom and sides of the baked crust, added the yummy filling, spread it around, did NOT bake it, just chilled overnight. And yes, if you keep stirring this pudding, it will thicken, that's absolutely true, mine was not soupy. Easy to cut, not one droop of gooey mess, the crust on the bottom was actually toasty. My theory is that using ripe or overripe bananas and baking it creates the syrup on the bottom. A delicious 5-star pie, + the added bonus of a homemade vanilla pudding recipe. Family loved it! =:o)

MMM This is OMG out of this world yummy.
Thanks Ruby!

A couple changes i made:
-Fully bake crust before adding bananas and custard
-Freeze pie for at least 3hrs instead of baking OR bake approx. 8min and then freeze

I loved this pie, very flavorful. For everybody who says it was runny must have done something wrong because I followed the recipe to a tee except the I didnt bake it and it was perfect. I used a simple pie crust baked from scratch(really the only way to go). Wonderful recipe.

I used cornstarch instead of flour and a vanilla bean pod (cooked with mixture then split and scraped seeds into mixture along with egg yolks) instead of vanilla extract, and a graham crust.  If anything will use a smidgen less cornstarch as mine turned out very thick... but good eating!

I absolutely love this recipe. Whenever I make a few of these pies I always make extra pudding just because my husband and I love it so much. I never bake this pie - definitely only put it in the fridge - and I've found that adding some home-made whipped cream and pecans to the top makes it even more delicious. Easily the best banana cream pie I've ever had.

WORST RECIPE EVER!!! This was beyond soupy, it was so watery that I had to throw it out. Not only that, but I spent an hour cleaning out my oven from the drip page, and later my refrigerator after trying to salvage it by chilling it. The mixture dripped so much that I had to throw out a ton of stuff in my refrigerator. Not worth the agony!

It would certainly be easier to throw some bananas in a premade crust, and pour some boxed pudding over it...but it wouldn't be anything close to this.  This is like banana pudding in pie form.  I even made a vanilla wafer crust (1 1/2 cups crushed wafer, 6 TBL melted butter, cooked for 5 minutes at 350)...also worth the effort.  Personal preference for those that don't want to be overwhelmed with banana, I used TWO bananas that were laid out evenly on the bottom.  That was plenty of banana for us.  I cooked the pudding more than the video shows, where it was already getting thicker.  I did bake for about half the recipe time without a problem.  It just helped set it up better.  Homemade whipped cream is so much better than packaged topping.  I will use this to make a coconut cream pie next time.

Wonderful recipe! I think I overcooked the pie crust, though (pre-baked it a liiiitle too long, methinks.) 

Absolutely love the pudding, made some this morning for myself as a treat (the pie was gone so quickly last night!)

This pie did not make it through the chilling process because my family devoured it! It tasted awesome a little warm. The only thing I did differently is I used 1 1/2 full egg instead of just three yolks.

I think that you don't need to bake it otherwise the bananas turn really dark.  Also, it would be better to mix a puree of bananas into the pudding but it certainly does taste better the next day.

Great taste, rich pudding and fairly easy to make. Loved it. Didn't solidify really but I ignored the bake in the oven step. I will use this recipe again for certain.

I made this pie for a New Year's Day dinner.  I used the a vanilla wafer crust recipe which I brushed lightly with an egg white wash before baking to prevent the crust from becoming soggy after filling it.  I used whole milk and 3 tablespoons of cornstarch instead of flour and it thickened up great. I did not bake this pie as many reviewers mentioned and it turned out great. After cooking, I placed the mixture in the frig and sealed it with saran wrap to prevent it from developing a skin. Once cooled, I layered it with the bananas in the cooled crust. I also topped it with homemade whipped cream.  It received rave reviews and I will definitely make it again!!!

This was 5 stars because it was easy and delicious. I'm no cook and have never made filling from scratch, but I read the reviews and took heed to make sure I cooked the filling long enough. I also used the Nilla Wafer pie crust that was suggested, which was a nice complement to the banana. I'll note that when I started making it, I realized I didn't have any vanilla extract, so I cooked and stirred until my husband got back from the store. Likely for this reason, I didn't have the problem with the filling being thin that others have noted. I filled the whole crust with the bananas and just filled the pie crust afterwards (in hind sight, I should have layered a little more as there were some nana bits that were not part of the "pudding"). I DID NOT cook it, and am glad for that information. It was perfect just chilled and we added topping before eating it. Great recipe which I will try again! Thanks for an easy, delicious Christmas dessert!!

This is a wonderful banana cream pie.  I followed the recipe exactly and would say that while we all loved it, I'm going to try it with a graham cracker crust rather than the pastry shell.  It was excellent, but I do think the graham cracker will really set off the banana cream flavor.  Also have to agree that this is an amazingly good pudding recipe.  Best I've ever had.

This was a great recipe. Tastes way better than a box of pudding mix. I followed the recipe using corn starch and making sure it was as thick as pudding before pouring it into the pie shell. I took the advice of others and didn't bake it. It turned out great! I only chopped 2 bananas for the bottom and used 1 to garnish and there were more than enough.

I took the advice of many reviewers and (1) used cornstarch in lieu of flour; (2) used vanilla wafer crust in lieu of pie crust and (3) did not bake it.  I cooked the filling on the stove until it was thick & creamy like pudding and assembled as directed.  When I took it out of the fridge 6 hours later is was like soup!!  I'm not sure why it didn't firm up.  Maybe I didn't cook it on the stove long enough or maybe I should have baked it.   I usually make a recipe as directed the first time I make it and this is why!  I salvaged it by throwing the whole thing (including the crust) into the blender and made great smoothies which I served with whipped cream.  The great flavor of the smoothies is why I gave this 4 stars.  I would have given it 5 if it came out right.

This was my first time ever making pie! For Thanksgiving I decided to make this! It turned out amazing, and was so much fun to make! Very easy to follow the recipe, and was just all around great! I layered the banana slices and the pudding... I used a little smaller pie dish, so I had some left over pudding... The family and I ate that right up! Just amazing! Thank you!!!!

I tried this recipe twice, once with flour and once with cornstarch.  I loved the taste, but was not able to get the consistency right.  I boiled the heck out of it, and have to wonder if bananas "weep" because what started out fine ended up a soggy mess when it came out of the refrigerator.  The taste was great, but I would make individual tart shells instead of serving it as a pie.

I almost didn't make this recipe because there are so many conflicting comments on how it should be made.  So, I just went ahead with the recipe as is, although I did substitute flour for cornstarch.  I think that the baking helps the bananas break down.  We LOVED it, and I will be making it again this week for thanksgiving!

I use this recipe every time I make banana Cream pie, it is a family favorite. There is no other recipe that can match the flavor of the pudding. Cornstarch and packaged puddings are not nearly as flavorful in my opinion. I give it 5 stars, for the flavor, but I do not understand why you added the step to bake the pie for another 15 minutes. It is not necessary. Instead make sure you cook the pudding for  a full 2-3 minutes, stirring constantly, then pour it into the pie shell, cover with a layer of plastic wrap as you would for pudding and let it cool in the refrigerator. I remove the plastic wrap and then cover the whole pie with whipped cream and serve. For those that had a runny pie, it is probably because raw egg yolks have an enzyme that breaks down the thickener. That is why you MUST heat that pudding for the recommended 2-3 minutes in order to kill the enzyme in the egg yolk or they will destroy the thickener and it will be runny. One final note, make sure you use REAL Vanilla extract, not imitation. I use one and a half teaspoons when I make this pie.

I have been baking pies for years and needed a quick and easy recipe for my overripe bananas!I made my own graham cracker crust and baked it for 8 minutes and let cool.  Meanwhile,I made the custard but used a full 1/3 cup of corn starch in lieu of flour.  I did not bake the pie as suggested.  The custard is wonderful and just the right consistency using the corn starch.

I made this pie last summer, but I had found the recipe on another web site and kept it in my recipe file. I am glad to see here, it is truly a wonderful pie. A true refreshing blast from the past dessert. Why buy it when its this easy and affordable to make, again and again and.....well you get the point.

This recipe is exactly what I was looking for.  I did make some changes.  I used 1can milk plus 1/2 C of water to make the 2 cups of milk.  I also substituded cornstartch for the flour.  Cornstarch is tasteless.  I only had 2 browing bannanas - but it turned out great.  I added all the ingredients and brought to a boil while stirring the entire time.  Once the filling bubbles and thickens I took it off the heat, and then added my bannanas to the mixture.  I did make a graham cracker crust- using 3C grahams and 4T sugar, with 4T butter and baked at 375 for 10min prior.  It was yummy- my husband was craving this, and I use to make it out of Jello- this is much more like what you crave.  Thanks for the recipe.

Mmm..this is cooling in the fridge now and I already KNOW its going to be amazing. 
I changed the 3/4 cup white sugar to about 1/2 dark brown sugar and added half a more tablespoon of cornstarch. Its YUMMY..I can't stop eating it.
I also lightly dusted a bit of cocoa powder over the layer of bananas to give a bit of bitterness to all the sweet action.

This turned out so well! I've never made a pie like this from scratch before. I followed some of the pudding making tips from one other reviewer. Also used half and half instead of milk. and did 1 TBS of vanilla extract. I also let the mixture cool a bit before adding the egg yolks. I let it the pudding chill in the fridge overnight covered with Saranwrap to avoid getting the leathery skin on top of pudding.

This was the best banana cream pie we've ever tasted.  It was also extremely easy to make.  If you follow the directions you cannot go wrong.

This is exceptional! I read through most of the reviews, but then went ahead and made the recipe as is. The only thing I did change was the flour to fine baking starch. I don't know why others had 'thin' cream unless the cooking time wasn't long enough. If anything, I had a problem with the cream being almost too thick, more towards a heavy curd in consistency. As a result, I skipped the baking as it was nearly set before I put it in the fridge! Thank you for this easy and wonderful recipe :)

This pie is very good. I did not change a thing like other reviewers did  and it came out perfect. My Father In-Law said it was the best banana cream pie that he has had in a long time.

I followed this recipe and it came out great!  As it is custard-type based it does require the 15 minutes of baking time.  Top of pie was perfect.  After about 15 minutes of cooling, I placed saran wrap loosely over the filling to keep it from getting a film.  Used flakey crust recipe (Crisco, water and flour, no overnight refrigeration) and that provided a light flakey crust.  One suggestion is to put a thin layer of filling on bottom of crust then put bananas down, and completely cover the bananas with the filling, to keep them from turning.  Hubby is a chef and even he gave the approval on this recipe.

Super Yummy!  Took suggestion of other reviewers and reduced sugar, used 4T corn starch instead of flour.  Set up perfect, not runny at all.  Used hand held rotary beaters while heating to keep it from clumping. Did not cook the pie, but did put meringue on top, and baked that after pie had been in the fridge overnight.  Completely perfect.  Thank you for  a terrific recipe

I made this for the holiday, I followed the directions except for baking at the reccomendation of so many other reviewers. I was really unhappy with the custards consistancy.  I cooked it till it was thick and coated the spoon without running and yet it was still very loose and almost runny when we went to cut the pie. ( I chilled it for 20 hours) Tried it anyways and oh my was this rich.  Too much so for my liking even if it would have been the right consistancy. Will not make this agian.

Love the custard.  A Few HINTS:  it will take about 20-25 to make the custard.  I used a whisk, adding in a 1/4c. milk @ a time and stirring for about 2 mins each time.  By the end it was nice and thick, the butter will help it thicken a bit more.  Take your time and don't rush it or it will be runny.
Great recipe!

This was my first cream pie and I was very nervous after reading so many reviews but went for it anyways and it turned out  great! Some of the reviews that explained how long to cook it and what would happen were very helpful! I will make this again, and think I will double the custard portion.

I made this recipe for Valentine's day and it was delicious! I followed the recipe exactly, though I did not bake it. No need! I used a graham cracker crust and threw in the freezer for one hour. Next time I will incorporate more bananas, but all in all a great recipe.

I made this recipe and followed it except for the fact that i mashed the banana that this called for and added it to the cream mixture and then sliced 1 banana and arranged it over the bottom of the crust. i baked it only for ten minutes because i didn't want the top to get a crust over it. When it came out I topped it using the recipe for meringue that was included in the recipe for banana cream pie V from this same site. I than chilled it for 3 hours and when i sliced it it was soup! So I tried it again this time adding 1 tablespoon of cornstarch,adding an extra egg yolk, mashing 1 banana, and slicing the rest. Than I cooked it for 15 minutes, (it did get a slight crust) and refrigerated for at least 3 hrs, topped it with meringue, cooked the meringue with a blowtorch, and it was fantastic!

This was really good! I used the cornstarch and it thickened up perfectly. I put it on a chocolate wafer crust for a different flavor and everyone really enjoyed it. Next time I think I'll use a regular graham wafer crust, or vanilla wafers. This filling would adapt to all very well, as would using another soft fruit such as peaches.

Oh this pie is spectacular!  I also used cornstarch in place of flour as other reviewers suggested. The butter and vanilla give it a rich creamy taste...so delicious.  Chilled overnight and served with fresh whipped cream.  Will make again for sure!

This pie is amazing!  From other reviews: I did not bake the pie. Used WHOLE milk, and made a nilla wafer crust, (1 1/2 cups crushed nilla wafers, and 6 T melted butter, bake 350 for 5 min) and lined the crust with the bananas.  UNBELIEVABLE!  Making it again today!

It was delicious! 
**Made with SILK Coconut Milk...and held together nicely. Did NOT BAKE, just chilled for 2hrs!
I did a home made Vanilla Wafer crust, think a reg pie crust would have been better, almost seemed too sweet with the wafer crust. 
Sprinkled with a little cinnamon and topped w home made whipped cream perfect!

The pie filling was COMPLETELY liquid. We followed the directions as published, and the pie was so liquid that it couldn't even move it without fearing it would 'spill'. This is not a pie, it is a banana cream beverage.

I give this a three because it tasted really good, but it was SUPER runny. I followed the reviewers tips to use cornstarch instead of flour and it was set up beautifully. I put in in the shell and refrigerated it for about 15hrs. and it came out like thin chowder. We ate it anyway, but somethings not right with the recipe if this many people complain about it being soupy.

So good! Made this for my Dad's 84th birthday. My first time making Banana Cream Pie and Pudding. Only thing I changed was using Corn Starch instead of Flour. I used a Keeblers 9" graham cracker pie crust and brushed it all over  w/ egg white and baked @375 for 5 min. I lightly brushed the crust with bourbon. I found the key to the pudding is patience. Keep stirring till it comes together ( consistency of frosting) almost 10 minutes. I did use whole milk but not sure that matters. I was afraid I might scramble the eggs when adding a little of the mixture to the beaten eggs then quickly added all the eggs into the mixture stirring constantly for 1-2 min more. Then you have to quickly slice and place your bananas in the shell before the pudding gets a skin.
I crammed in 4 med. bananas added the pudding and baked for 5 more minutes to set up. I refrigerated for a few hours and topped with Bourbon Whipped Cream. Served this with Banana Ice Cream (made from blending 2 softened haagen dazs pints and 2 bananas..freeze for a few hours).

it was sort of runny after chilling in the freezer for 1 hour and then fridge for 2 1/2 hours....not sure why..I actually added additional corn starch to help thicken it even more...the taste was good...could have used a little less sugar in the mix though...as suggested by others but I followed the 3/4 cup white sugar.... mmmm seemed like it didn't taste enough like bananas to me... but that is just me...would I make this one again ? more than likely not....

Simply fantastic. I used a storebought vanilla wafer crust and felt that it was a great choice.  I reduced the sugar to half a cup as others suggested and I think that this is a good move - it is still plenty sweet enough. I also added a touch of cinnamon to the vanilla pudding before putting it in the pie shell. I did not cook the pie, I simply made the pudding, put the bananas in the shell and filled the pie shell. Then I let it sit for about 1/2 hour at room temperature before cooling it for several hours in the fridge. For the topping, I whipped heavy cream, adding a handful of sugar and a touch of banana flavoring. Once the pie cooled, I covered the top with the whipped cream. Yum! I literally could not believe how delicious this pie was - make it and you will not regret it.

I made this pie for my fiance, who asked for a banana cream pie. I used corn starch instead of flour, and didn't bake the pie. No problems with the filling being runny or soupy, and the flavor was quite good. I topped the whole pie with homemade whipped cream, sliced bananas, and Nilla wafers - yum!

I doubled the contents for a deep dish and put the banana's on top of the custard.  Then, I made homemade whip and topped the pie with it.  5 stars.

I made this pie exactly as directed an it turned out wonderful. My whole family loved it!  My husband even said that I needed to make it again this week...lol. I used a homemade pie crust and topped it with homemade whipped cream....yummy!  Next time I think I will skip the baking part of the recipe just cuz it seemed like an extra step that's not really needed. Just one question...why did my bananas turn brown and how can I prevent it from happening again?

This recipe was GOOD. I have never made banana cream pie before, but I got ALOT of compliments. I reduced the sugar to half a cup, it was very lightly sweetened, actually it could have been a bit more sweet in my opinion, but it was fine. and personally I feel if I had used cornstarch instead of flour it might have been even better, but the texture and the look of the pie was EXCELLENT.

Turned out good.  this is the second time I made it.  The first time I made a crust of nilla wafers.  This time I didnt have the wafers on hand so I just used a basic pie crust recipe.  BUT....I did use 3 tbls of cornstarch instead of flour.   I also used 1 1/2 cups 2% milk and 1/2 cup of heavy cream.  baked for about 10-12 mins.

I like this recipe the way it is. Make sure to cook the custard it in the saucepan as long as it says or else it won't set. I baked it and it was great. Top it with whipping cream and toasted coconut when chilled, yum! I tried the cornstarch method and I didn't like the texture, reminded me of cheap pudding, but that's my opinion.

Maybe im in the minority with this one but: A. it is FAR too sweet.  B. it does not set in an hour, still very soupy C. Recipe needs to specify to use WHOLE MILK D. recipe should say to continuously stir until it thickens, not until it bubbles. by the time it bubbles there is a thick coating on the bottom of your pan.

For Christmas dessert I made this and chocolate cream pie.  The preparation was a lot smoother than the chocolate cream which I doubted would ever thicken! Hours of refrigeration later I didn't even want to try it! It was really really runny and I skipped it.  I have no idea what the flavor was like but the chocolate cream was delish!

My husband loves banana cream pie but would only eat one piece of this.  There are WAY too many bananas ... the filling is delicious but you could hardly taste it!  If I ever make this pie again I would double the filling and cut the bananas by at least half!

I read the reviews and cut down the sugar, but I wouldn't recommend doing this.  Just follow the recipe exactly, except don't bake it.  It will set firm and beautifully overnight in the fridge.  But, honestly, why not just make an instant pudding pie?  It almost tastes the same, even though this pie is very yummy!

It was awful. I followed the recipe to a T, and it came out horribly runny. I think I'll use cornstarch in place of flour next time. It makes a great banana pudding :(

I thought this recipe was very good. I scalded my milk before I added the dry ingredients. Also, I cooked it a couple of minutes longer than the recipe. It set up very well. I know that some people had trouble with it being too runny. I did not have that problem. Very yummy & thick.

This certainly has to be the best banana cream pie recipes.  I read several reviews were people said they had troubles with the filling setting up.  I've had that issue in years past & now ensure that I cook it long enough, otherwise it won't set.

First time making a Banana cream pie. Followed recipe and it was pretty simple to make.  We used a home made crust (as suggested here) using vanilla waffers crushed with butter.   Very tasty.  I think though, four bananas was a bit too much and it was sort of runny with in the first 4 hours of making it but we had some the next day and it was better.

This recipe deserves a solid 5 star rating.  I followed directions as per recipe with a simple pie crust recipe I've always used and this pie was a sensation.  Family was eating it right out of the refrigerator; it never made it to the dinner table.  I will be making this again and placing this recipe in my permanent cookbook.  This is a keeper.

Made this for Turkey day. It was awesome. I would venture to guess that for the people that had it come out runny that you did not cook the pudding long enough, make sure you cook it until it bubbles while stirring than continue to cook for two more minutes. I also agree baking the pie is not necessary.

Awesome. I made it for me and the boyfriend and it was gone in two days! I used a store bought graham cracker crust, which was delicious. I also drizzled the top with white chocolate, which made for a really nice addition.

This was my first attempt at a Thanksgiving pie  (I live in the UK) and it was yummy.  I used the left-over egg whites and another tablespoon of sugar to top it with meringue.

This recipe is great, my pie wasn't soupy at all. I used flour and 2% milk. I only used 2 bananas though, it I would have used all four I would not have had any room for the filling in my shell. So, I put 1.5 bananas on the bottom and used the other half on the top.

Great recipe!!! Very easy and delicious!! I would recommend not baking for very long. I am not going to bake it at all this year. (It gets a gross film on it and dries out the bananas.) And the pudding will be runny if you don't let it thicken!! Lots of constant stirring! ENJOY :)

I think this recipe is absolutelt amaaaazing!!! I don't bake it though, just put it in the fridge for a couple of hours and its perfect every time ! The only difficult part is to really constantly stir the mixture while its in the sauce pan or else it'll burn and you'll get brown chunks. Other then that its PERFECT !

I have tried every recipe known, and this one is the best by far. Only changed one thing, this time I used whipping cream instead of milk.  It wasn't heavy,  just regular, and it came out perfectly. I like a recipe that uses flour instead of corn starch which always has an after taste to me, I just don't like it. Well, I'll stick to this one for coconut as well. If anyone wants a lighter pie, fold some unsweetened whipped cream into the mixture.
For those finding it runny, you're not allowing it to cook fully.  If you have an insta read thermometer, make sure it reaches at least 160 degrees or higher, or it coats the back of a spoon really well. Then make sure to refrigerate several hours, it will thicken.

This was an extremely tasty recipe.  I did follow the advice on not baking it. I can see how baking it would make the texture of the pudding rubbery. Don't bake it; just refrigerate it instead. I also used a vanilla wafer crust.

My husband and I loved this pie! I followed other readers' suggestions though and lessened the sugar to 1/2 c., substituted half of the 1/3 c. flour with cornstarch, and added more bananas.  I made sure to simmer this for 3-5 minutes to make sure it wasn't runny.  We also put chocolate shavings on top of the pie -- made it look and taste better.

Like many others, I didn't bake it.  It didn't seem to need it at all.  I would have added another layer of bananas.  It was tasty and pretty easy.

My daughter loved the flavor of the pudding.  I too didn't bake it.  It doesn't seem like it's going to be runny.  I mashed the bananas in the pudding to give it more of a banana flavor.  Will definitely make again.  *****MAKE SURE YOU BOIL THE MILK MIXTURE UNTIL IT BECOMES THICK.

I made this exactly as written and it was AMAZING! I loved the pudding and wouldnt change a thing about that. Alot of stirring involved, so for those who didnt get the right consistancy it may be because you didnt give it long enough on the stove..on med high. Stir Stir Stir. What I will change next time is the bananas. I thought there was to much banana for my taste so next time I will reduce it to 3 and mash them and mix them into the pudding. I didnt like the layer of bananas the next day, so that should resolve that. Other then the that I thought it was a great recipe and will be making this for years to come. Thanks!

This was a delicious pie, and I don't even like banana cream. I only had 2 bananas, so couldn't use four, but 2 worked fine. Topped with meringue. Everything came together perfectly and it set up like a charm. Will make again!

Hey I just made this pie, havent tasted it yet, but have to say that I have no problems with it being soupy, the pudding is thick, and is actually good tasting by itself. The problem is you guys probably dont know how to read, and have not been boiling it on the stove for long enough, you let it sit on medium til it bubbles...which at that point is thick AND ONLY THEN YOU COOK FOR 2 MINUTES MORE, not only heat it for 2 minutes, was prob on the stove for 5 minutes before it started to bubble for me

Answering GIVEMEABREAK's question, there is WAY TOO MUCH MILK! I would cut down on the milk but other than that, the pie isn't that bad.

This was my first ever pie attempt so it's of no surprise that it didn't go according to plan, but since many other people mentioned it, I thought I would say that my pie ALSO never hardened. I don't know why this is, but it just didn't work. Someone mentioned corn starch in a comment but there's no mention of it in the recipe, so I'm curious if perhaps that's why? Hope that's helpful!

This has a very nice flavor.  But in following the recipe exactly, it does not set (as many reviewers have mentioned).  I had it in the fridge overnight but it was still a soupy mess.  Tasty, but very soupy.

This is great! Made just as the recipe said (but totally missed the baking it step - did not bake) & topped with real whipped cream - yum!  It was great!

This is a wonderful pie recipe! My 9 year-old has a dairy allergy, so I made it dairy-free, using dairy-free butter and vegan cream in place of the dairy ingredients. Will definitely be making again!

5 stars for the pudding, as I don't follow the rest of the recipe when making my banana cream pie.  I use cornstarch instead of flour and cook the mixture until it looks like a thin pudding.  It's delicious!  I layer Nilla Wafers, sliced bananas, and pudding in a pie dish, cover with plastic wrap (to keep a tough film from forming on the pudding), and refrigerate.  When chilled, top with fresh whipped cream and some cinnamon.  This always gets rave reviews.

This was a great pie! I used a frozen, deep dish crust, only 3 bananas (but they were somewhat large), cornstarch, and I did not bake the pie at the end. Absolutely delicious!

This was easy and quick to make and turned out wonderfully. Keep in mind you need a deep pie crust and I also mashed the banana's and spread a nice layer, it even's it out and makes it easier to serve.

This recipe tastes like pastry cream. The consistency was perfect! If you're getting watery sauce then you need to allow more time for the flour to thicken. Every stove is hotter/colder, so if it helps think like you're making sausage gravy....then add the eggs.

I'm giving the recipe 5 stars, but I made some changes and that would have made it less, if that was part of the original recipe...but, what I did was use the cornstarch.  I'm always scared that custard won't set up, so I feel more comfortable with cornstarch.  But it was a mistake to do so because it ended up a bit, just a bit, too tight.  Most importantly, the meringue couldn't adhere to it very well, so it sort of slipped around on top, which wasn't very appealing.  I think the flour would have had a better texture, something for the meringue to hold onto.

delicious custard ( I always prefer corn starch  as the thickener) and a pastry crust gives more when cutting pieces  although the wafer crust is a nice summer alternative. No need to bake the custard ( I used half and half ). Meringue or whipped cream all make for finishing touches as seen by the vanrious photos!

I made this with a vanilla wafer crust & meringue on top. It was delicious! I did bake it for about 15 minutes so that the meringue could brown. The only thing was that it did set up as I would have liked, which made it difficult to serve because it just wanted to fall apart. Maybe next time I'll try to cook it longer.

this pie is amazing! i am a beginner cook, so it took both me and my fiance to make it. be sure to prebake your pie shell before you do anything. i didn't even know i was supposed to until i was at the end of my recipe. However, it still turned out fantastic.i added cool whip on top and toasted coconut. It was my first banana cream pie and i LOVED it. Five stars.

AMAZING I followed the directions of others and used whole milk, I thought about substituting cornstarch for the flour but I didn't but it turned out AMAZING. I didn't know what people topped theirs with and now I know it's Heavy Whipping Cream - Whipped! I'm trying that this weekend because I served it with whipping cream out of a can and put it back in the fridge and of course it melts.

I absolutely did not have all the required ingredients but I had an extra pie crust I needed to use.  I used the corn starch substitute.  I also did not have vanilla and used a little pancake syrup instead.  I also only had my husband's yucky egg substitute but it worked just fine.  I found it to be a little soupy and slowly stirred in a little more corn starch with a wisk.  It came out great.  My son wanted to eat the pudding by itself.  I thought 4 bananas couldn't be enough but as I cut them I found them to be more than enough to fill up the pie crust.  Great recipe even with my experimenting.

Great recipe, I followed this exactly but at the end added a mashed up banana so the pudding would have banana flavour throughout. Turned out really good, will definately make again!

My 13 year old son made this today with a little help.  It was delicious.  He followed the recipe, using non-fat milk (because that is what we had) and cornstarch.  He skipped the last baking step because he didn't think it would need it, and I guess he was right.  It came out perfectly.  He wants this for his next birthday instead of cake.

This recipe made a great pie.  I used the cornflour option and cheated with a ready-made pie shell.  It only needed 3 bananas and I made sure I cooked the filling well.  Contrary to some reviews, there was not a drop of `soup` in sight!  The filling  had a strong vanilla taste, which I liked.  Very worthy of five stars!

This is a wonderful pie to make, even if you don't have the butter or vanilla in it! I made it two ways: as written and w/o vanilla and butter (family!) Both came out really well, though I only baked it for about 8 minutes instead of the full 12-15.   This thing is so easy to put together, doesn't take a lot of cooking skill, expensive ingredients, or prep time. And I think if put into mini tart pans, the filling would be superb to serve warm!  The pie is a lot like a pudding - doesn't quite hold together into a true "slice", but my family absolutely loved it! I'm also going to try making it with almond milk, since my mother in law isn't good with dairy. I'm thinking the original might be nice, but it also comes in vanilla, so we'll see!

Made my own pie crust to go with it--very yummy! Used 1% milk, 1/8 tsp salt, 1 1/2 Tbs butter and the 3 Tbs of cornstarch. I also decreased the amount of sugar a tad bit. Next time, and there WILL be a next time, I will decrease the sugar to 1/2 c. like others have suggested.   Thanks for the great recipe, Ruby!

Sadly, my pie came out very runny, even after chilling in fridge / freezer for 5 hours. I prepared exactly as instructed, substituting corn starch for flour.  I will try again with slightly different ingredients.   I topped my pie w/ whipped cream and a combination of toasted coconut and sliced almonds (1/4 c each sweetened coconut flakes + chopped slivered almonds, toasted in dry pan over med. heat for 10 minutes or until golden.) This topping combination was heavenly, and the flavor of the pie was amazing (if not perhaps a bit too sweet... less sugar next time), too bad it was soupy, or this dessert would have been perfect.

This recipe is perfect! I can't imagine how people ended up with this being soupy - i did have to heat to med-high for a few minutes then turn it right down when it started to thicken. using a rubber spatula that really scraped the bottom kept it from scorching.

I loved this pie but as some others have said, I had to freeze it because it was just soupy but boy, does the flavor make up for that! Other reviews also made mention of their bananas turning black but I didn't have that problem. Will def. make again and again and work on my consistency with the filling.

This did not have a very strong banana flavor, in spite of all those bananas. And they went black before anybody in my house ate it. Not worth retrying.

I thought this was so delicious.  I made it exactly as the recipe states.  The only thing I did was used the crust using vanilla wafers as was stated previously.  The crust was great with the pie.  I also served it with whipping creme.  Super good.

Definitely soupy, but really delicious. I just froze mine so it didn't go to waste and I'll cut slices out for myself. Next time I will keep the sugar, milk, flour mixture over heat longer until it thickens more. I don't think that the recipe allows for enough time to thicken up. I tried baking it too and it didn't do anything to set the pie. I would have given it less stars, but it tastes really good!

Amazing.  Can't wait to try the actual pie.  I mashed a banana with the egg yolks because I wanted more of a banana pudding instead of just vanilla. Had a little extra pudding, so I put in a small dish and chilled for about 10 minutes-it was delicious.  I too hate to waste, so like another review, I made a meringue with the egg whites.

I was surprised this pie was so easy to make.  I did use 1 1/2 C of half and half and 1/2 skim milk for the milk.  Since, it had to be baked a little, I added a meringue. I loved how the pie used the yolks and the meringue used the whites, no waste!! I baked it at 400 for 8 minutes.  I did read how some used corn starch, although, the flour worked well, I am interested in the difference in taste using the cornstarch.  Oh and I used only 2 bananas. Happy baking!!

Unbelievably GOOD!! followed directions, used just a bit of the cornstarch mixed in w/ the flour. Did NOT bake. Use 1 1/2 c. crushed vanilla wafers mixed w/ 6 TBSP melted butter and baked at 350 for 10 min. Placed into fridge for 2hrs. then dotted w/ whip cream.

This turned out amazing!  I made a crust with nilla wafers which went perfectly with the pie filling.  The flavor was spot-on.  Next time I may add a wee bit more thickener to the mix as mine was just slightly runny.

This banana cream pie is great!  It's very easy to make and it tastes delicious.  I followed some of the other reviewers' suggestions and didn't bake it, just chilled in the fridge.  Before I put the filling in the crust, I covered the bottom with banana slices and added some small banana chunks directly into the filling.    The next time I make this, I think I'll try a chocolate wafer crust in lieu of graham cracker.  It would be like a banana split!

I thought this was really good. I liked the fact that I learned to make pudding from scratch. It was good and really easy. The pie itself was a little boring. Next time I will make a puree of bananas and mix a little in the pudding and I would also like some whipped cream on the top. Maybe some toasted coconut or almonds on the top to increase flavor interest. But, as just a boring banana cream pie, it was good.

This was absolutely delicious.  Found that it is just the right amount of filling for the pie crust.  Tastes so much better than an instant or cooked boxed pudding!  Will definitely make again.

Good pie. Simple ingredients. Don't believe the directions that say chill one hour. You've gotta chill it at least a couple in the fridge or part time in the freezer. Mine was still liquid after an hour in the fridge. Good though.

I made this recipe as is, using my mother in law's pie crust recipe. It was my first time making pie crust from scratch, and my first time making banana cream pie. It came out beautifully, and it tasted just right. I baked this for about 13 minutes, and topped it with fresh whipped cream with a touch of vanilla. Excellent!!!

Unfortunately, this pie didn't turn out very well for me.  First, I used one of the reviewer's suggestion and made a vanilla wafer crust.  I must have made it too thick or over-baked the crust (prob more so the latter) because we couldn't cut through it.  In my opinion the pudding/filling was too vanilla-y tasting.  I would have preferred banana pudding.  Next time I would try to find banana extract and use that instead.  Also, my pudding was on the thick side.  A bit too thick for my preference.  I also thought this was way too sweet.  Obviously I did something wrong because I'm in the minority here!  I was so disappointed because I LOVE banana cream pie.  It's one of my favorite desserts.  The BEST banana cream pie I ever had was at Angelo's bakery on 86th Street in Bensonhurst, Brooklyn.  I was never allowed at any family parties unless I brought that pie with me, LOL!  So sad that bakery is now closed...  If I find banana extract, I will try this recipe again!

This pie was yummy!  I used the basic flaky pie crust recipe from this site. I followed the recipe exactly, as far as ingredients, but did not bake it and it came out perfect.  Not at all runny.  I love the flavor of the pudding mix and for me it had a good banana flavor.  I will definetly make this again.

I made no changes to the recipe and it turned out wonderful.   Used a cookie/graham type pie shell.  If you like strong banana flavor you may want to add a little banana extract as one reviewer said.  For me the pie was just right.

The pie came out delicious! I added a tad bit more sugar and vanilla extract to it. I must have put too much corn starch because the pie filling was a little thick but that's okay I'll get it right next time. This recipe is definitely a keeper.

This came out wonderfully! I baked my own pie crust but due to a mishap with the oven it didn't come out right, so I made a snap decision to make parfait cups and to just use vanilla wafers. This came out excellent! The custard was perfect - not too runny or thick, the perfect consistency and flavor. This made five small-to-medium sized parfaits. Like other reviewers suggested, I used 3 tablespoons of cornstarch in place of flour and just refrigerated instead of baking. I'm most definitely going to make this again.

The 1st time I made this-wonderful!! 2nd  time a flop. Totally runny. I didn;t cook the first portion of it long enough. It's called a brie(bree)? Cook it long enough and it will not be runny. I kept a second pan handy to keep from scorching the ingredient. The pan started scorch the pudding so I switched pans to kept it from getting the burnt clumps in the pudding. Oh, I also added crushed vanilla wafers before I put them in the pie crust.YUMMM!! Hope this helps the other person that had problems too!! Maybe I cooked it on to high a temp. But it works!

Very good pie.  I would recommend whole milk/whipping cream for pudding mixture.  I would also recommend using a vanilla cookie crust.  I did not bake my pie- I just let it chill for four hours or so, and it was perfect!  Whip cream is also a nice addition!

This made a great cream for the banana cream pie... I didn't try the pie just the cream while I was putting the pie together for my husband to take to work! I did use half and half in place of the milk and the cream was ultra rich and yummy! Such a keeper! Thanks!

I had never made banana cream pie and I made it for a friends birthday.  I was nervous to serve it as I was not sure she would like it.  She loved it, so did my husband and even I liked it (not a big banana fan.  This is something I will make again.  I put bananas on the crust and I also mixed bananas into the mixture then topped it with cool whip.  Loved it!!!  thanks for the recipe.

I made this Banana Cream Pie and it was great. I actually used Splenda and I for got about that and then remembered. WOW!  It tasted really good and I also doubled the batch, so we could have a little pudding and whip cream on the side.   I have no idea really why other people who made this had it turn out runny, I do know that with pudding you have to constantly stir it.. and be careful not to burn the bottom. Everyone loved it! Thumbs up.

I loved the flavor of this pie.  Mine turned out pretty runny, but I don't think I cooked the pudding mixture long enough.  I made it for Easter dinner, and even though we ended up using bowls to eat it - everyone loved it!  I would definitely try this one again.

I have never made a cream pie before and was a little nervous after reading the soupy reviews.  I followed the recipe exactly -using flour- and my pudding came out great.  I only had skim milk so I added some cream to it, and if anything my pudding is a little too thick.  The pie tastes wonderful, I would recommend it.  I took the others advise and did not bake it.  I will make this again.

I was very disappointed with this recipe.  It taste terrible!  I am not sure if it was because I should have served it the same day or not.  I baked it the day before and kept it in the refrigerator till serving.  The bananas were black and the overall taste was not good.  Think goodness I had another dessert as a backup to serve my guests.

I have not even tasted it yet, but I can tell it will be delicious.....I had no issues with making this as written.  As I always do with anything that uses flour for thickening I sub it with cornstarch, 3 TBS was perfect for this. If it came out runny for you then you are  either using non fat milk, or are not stirring enough.  Mine thickened right up while it was cooking, I even let it cool a bit (5-8 minutes) before I poured it over the sliced bananas so to not cook the bananas too much.  I can't wait to taste it.  I too made the vanilla wafer crumb crust......

Soooo soupy, must alter by using like a cup less milk or something. Tried it once and was good but soupy and thickened after like 2 days, 2nd time didn't crush the babanas and WAS SOUP. Tasy but just bad  cuz the texture.

I 3x the recipe and made 2 deep pies. They were little bits of heaven. Note to all...you have to cook and stir till your arm falls off, but it is so worth the effort. I am making 2 more but adding cocoa powder for chocolate pie. The neighbors are gone love me!!!

My father wanted a banana cream pie; he said it turned out pretty well.  I followed another reviewer's advice and added 3 Tbs. of corn starch to make it less runny.  You do want to let the pie sit in the fridge overnight to let the tastes mesh together.  I used the No Fail pie crust from this site that I have used many times before.

Tase was good, but it would have turned out better if I hadn't baked it and if, instead of lining the bottom of the pie with bananas, I'd just topped the chilled pie with whipped cream and sliced bananas. I think I'll have to try it again with the changes. The pudding was great, though!

This recipe is sooooo good, it didn't last a day! my 4yr old daughter had 3 slices of this pie straight out of the oven, she didn't mind the gooey pudding at all! and by the way the pudding made all the difference in the world, and I used a pie recipe from this site that is out of this world as well!!! Thanks for the great recipe.

I've made this recipe twice, both as is but without the baking.  The first time, it was amazing!  The second time, the custard was too thick and overset.  I may have added a heaping 1|3 cup of flour instead of a flush one, which could be the reason.

This kind of pie is my husbands favorite. For four years he has been asking me to make one, but I had never made a pie, so I was reluctant. I came across this recipe one day, and noticed I had all the ingredients, so I thought why not!  The pie turned out delicious. I made it exactly how the recipe said too. My husband and I fell in love. My husband was so happy and ate half of it the first night. I could not believe I actually made a pie, and a fantastic one at that! I thought it was really easy to make. It had such great taste; the pudding mixture was smooth, thick, and just perfect. I was pretty proud of myself. Thanks for sharing!   My husband gave it 5 stars as well. He is very excited I can make this now!

This is an AWESOME and easy recipe.  One suggested using at least 2% milk - since I only had skim I substituted 1 cup evaporated milk and 1 cup skim milk for the 2 cups milk.  Next time I will use less evaporated as it got a little too thick while it was cooking and I had to add more skim - otherwise I didn't change a think and it was just about as easy as using the boxed puddings and you get to say you made it from scratch.  Thanks!

This is so very good!  I use a larger pie pan and then 1 1/2 times the recipe.  I put bananas sliced on the  bottom over the cooled crust, then, half of the cream mixture and then more bananas and the rest of the mixture. I also cover with a meringue and put in the over till just lightly browned.Cool pie completely in fridge.  My family loves this.  I have put just a slight amount of banana flavoring in the cream mixture befoe too.

Once I fixed the soupy pudding this was by far one of the best banana cream pie recepies I've ever used.  I've gotten lots of requests to make this since.  I've made this a few times now anf some did come out on the soupy side but i've learned that you just really have to watch when you make the pudding.  Under cook it, and its soupy... over cook it and its the same.  It came out better when i substituted the four with 3 tablespoons of cornstarch.  Don't get discouraged if it doesn't come out right the first time.  The end result is well worth another shot once you get it right.

This is THE very best filling ratio/mix for banana cream.....so yummy.  When cooking though, ~1/2 hr, you must have patience or the filling will not set up for you.  I used skim milk, arrowroot, a bit of pure vanilla, and eliminated cooking.  It was absolutely perfect atop a simple graham cracker crust.

I've made this pie twice now and both times it was a BIG hit. My 9 year old gave me the greatest compliment and said this was the best homemade thing he has ever had. THANKS for a great recipe.

My 2 boys can be fussy eaters but this recipe was a hit and I have made it often. If it is too runny then you need to cook longer and maybe turn the heat up a little.

This recipe was horrible so I am surprised to see how many high ratings it got.  The recipe as written DOES NOT WORK.  The pie doesn't need to be baked and the pudding was too runny either way.  The filling was WAY too sweet.  If I had used the suggestions, it would have turned out much better but this recipe as written was a bust.

This is an excellent recipe. Incredibly easy to make and really delicious. Can't get enough of it! I took the advice from another user and used the mix of corn starch and flour. Came out beautifully. I even used the egg whites and whipped up some meringue to spread on top.  This is definately a recipe I will use time and time again.

It was a delicious recipe except it turned out liquidy!!! I added 2 extra cups of flour but the thickness wasn't like a pie. Great recipe but you need a thicker one!

I winter in Mexico and my condo has no oven, so I look for recipes that do not have to be baked.  Also, I cannot find cornstarch, so I used flour.  The pie was delicious and came our perfect! I used 1/2 cup plus 2 Tbsp. sugar, and substituted lemon juice for vanilla.  After the custard cooled to room temperature, I added the bananas which I tossed with lemon juice, and chilled the pie overnight.  It was big hit with everyone and it was so easy that I will definitely make it again.

I thought it was good, not great.  Might tend to make 1 1/2 times the recipe to fill up the pie crust if I made it again but I probably won't.  I used up the extra egg whites and made a meringue as it seemed wasteful not to use them.

Wonderful filling that was smooth and creamy. It did set up a little harder than I wanted and wasn't as soft of a color. It was very dark.

This recipe was so easy and tasted great! I ran out of vanilla, so I used almond extract, what a great flavor came from this! Try almond extract for a different and unique taste to this recipe!

I made this recipe twice (long story, but first crust was salty - cooking with 9 year old and distracted by hubby).  The first time it took a long time to get the custard to the right consistency.  The second time it took about 10 minutes.  I suspect this is because we used whole milk the second time. 

I highly recommend this recipe.  It's about half the calories of many of the other recipes yet it's still quite rich (a little bit goes a lon way).  Don't bother thinking about topping it with ice cream or whipped cream, since that will be too much.  We did, however, make a meringue with the leftover egg whites (to make a nice meringue you'd probably need a couple more whites).

I agree with the consensus that you don't need to put it in the oven after filling the pie.  However, if you add the meringue you will need to brown it a little.

I will DEFINITELY make this again.

Very good! I put the bananas on top, and it turns out, that wasn't a very good idea. Learn from my mistake and don't do that. Even so, it was excellent, and everyone was surprised that I made the custard myself.

Very good indeed. The pudding is very dense and somehow happens to have a light banana taste. Made it in a homemade graham cracker crust and it was wonderful.

this is a great recipe I like it with the cornstarch better than the flour.
