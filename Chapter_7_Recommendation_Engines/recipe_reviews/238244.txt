Simple yet so amazing! This is a fun snack to whip up. I made this recipe using natural peanut butter and raw honey in extra large baking cups so I am able to pull one out of the freezer and slice it into pieces for a family snack. I will be making this recipe again thumbs up!

PB'n'J Cups Haiku: "Something 'off' bout these. Melt too quick & quite messy. Followed recipe." I didn't deviate one bit from the recipe as it was easy and fun for my daughter to help out w/. We didn't let our impatience get the best of us and allowed them to fully freeze but even taking them out hours later and eating them by hand resulted in goopy melty peanut butter all over us which while good-tasting didn't quite jive with the strawberry part on top. Even though the instructions were simple the end result wasn't anything that I think we'll do again.
