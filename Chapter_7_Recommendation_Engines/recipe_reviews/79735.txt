It really does taste like that at the Chinese restaurants.  Very good, spicy!  I thickened it a little with cornstarch as I was using it as a dipping sauce for fondue.

All I can say is make it exactly the way it is and you can't go wrong.  I served it with tokatsu and everyone raved about it and was very surprised at the flavor that this sauce brought to the table.  Will def make on many occasions.

My husband & I went bonkers over this sauce when we used it with the 'Chicken Katsu' & white rice I make off this site.  I only used 1 t. red pepper flakes & it was spicy enough for us.  Excellent!!

I thought this was the perfect combination of flavors, but definitely too spicy. I've made it twice, the second time with garlic powder instead of fresh (because I was out) and only a sprinkle of red pepper flakes and it was perfect!

Wow, this was really authentic!  I served it with store bought eggrolls from the freezer section and made fried rice and hot and sour soup.  My hubby was so impressed he asked me to serve as an appetizer at our superbowl party this weekend!

Nice! VERY spicy as written, so add the red pepper sparingly if you're a heat lightweight. I added little more garlic and salt than called for. The texture was perfect, a little thinner than syrup. Thanks for the recipe!

This sauce is outstanding! I also thickened it with cornstarch (about 1 TBS).. The chilis gave it a fantastic color and flavor. I will definately be making this again.. thanks much!

Fantastic!  Taste just like from the restaurant.  I used Splenda instead of white sugar, because that's all I keep in the house, and used minced garlic from the jar instead of a garlic clove.  The sauce was thin initially, however it had thickened to the perfect syrupy consistency by the next day.  I used it on homemade spring rolls, by using large lettuce leaves as the wrap and put grilled chicken cubes with julienned cut cucumbers and shredded carrots on the inside.  Low-fat and very filling!!!

Fantastic sauce for eggrolls or wontons. It is meant to be on the thin side to gently flavor, not coat, items. Just like the good oriental restaurant versions.

This sauce was simple exactly what I expected it was going to be. I added a little corn starch slurry to thicken and used it as a stir fry sauce.

This tasted pretty good, but then I did end up adding 1 Tablespoon of soy sauce and 1/2 teaspoon of fresh ginger and it was AWESOME.

I took this sauce to a Chinese theme cooking club dinner tonight to dip pot stickers in. I found people using it on other food like on top of rice and a chicken dish that was there. Not much came home. Made it as the recipe was written and the only thing I would do to change it at all would be to maybe add some chili oil to add extra heat for those that are into that!

This was a bit too 'vinager-ish' for us. Perhaps next time, I won't use as much rice vinegar, although this was a nice concept.

Loved this sauce.  Made no changes at all.  I liked that it wasn't super thick, more of like a nice syrup consistancy.  Thanks for posting this.

Perfect. We made this to serve at a hot oil fondue party; specifically to go with shrimp, however our guests enjoyed this on the shrimp, beef and chicken!

This sauce is simply delicious! I made it twice, it tastes just as good as the one in restaurants! I added a teaspoon of cornstarch to thicken it a bit, and I was out of vinegar so I used half lemon juice half water and it still tasted great!

This is by far the best dipping sauce that I have ever made thus far. Follow the directions exactly, and you will be pleasantly surprised. I have made it on several occasions and have had so many compliments. Try this sauce with wontons or as a glaze the last few minutes of cooking a pork roast. Thank you for posting. much appreciated.

Delicious thanks for sharing. I was out of red pepper flakes so I used chili powder and turned out great. I also used just a little corn starch about 1.5 teaspoons or so, which gave the sauce a great consistency.

I used this sauce for marinating and basting a whole chicken, and I made a few revisions as well! I, first of all, doubled the recipe. And like many others, wanted a thicker sauce. I didn't have corn starch so I used 2 T (1 T if you don't double recipe) of bread flour, also I added an extra 1/3 cup of sugar for a more "syrupy" consistency. Didn't have rice vinegar substituted distilled white vinegar. Turned out great! Just what I was looking for. Thanks for the recipe!

This is a great sauce. 

A recommendation I have is to pair it with the Phyllo Turnovers with Shrimp and Ricotta Filling that is posted here on allrecipes by MattyGit.

Everytime I make these together everyone loves them.

Delightfully surprising. As it was simmering and as I mixed the other ingredients, ALL I could smell was the vinegar, and I was highly skeptical. But I kept faith and didn't alter the recipe at all (except maybe only 1 tsp pepper), and upon tasting it , the flavor was great! Personally, I'd prefer it to be a little thicker and syrupy than it is, but some cornstarch might help that.

Not completely sure about this one.  It was super easy to make but to me it tastes like sugary vinegar right now.  I put it in the fridge and am hoping it tastes better after a day of cooling.

All I can say is fabulous! This was the closest to "the right stuff" I've ever made!  Excellent!  I took the advise of others and added 1/2 Tbs. of cornstarch (for thickening). Great job!  Too easy; just the way I like recipes. One day  I got ambitious and made egg-rolls. So I had to find a dipping sauce.  My family decided they preferred my 'stuff' to our favorite Chinese restaurant. What have I started?!

I did not care for this recipe. The vinegar overpowers this sauce and it really should be titled hot and sour sauce.

The sauce was good but very strong. When I put my garlic in they turned green! I used a stainless steel pan, so i don't know if that had anything to with it. I contemplated dumping it, then decided to add the crushed red peppers....the sauce looked festive, so i ended  up serving it.

Awesome!! I made it as a dipping sauce for the Chinese Firecrackers and it was a hit!!  Since I'm on Weight Watchers, I substituted the Sugar with Splenda.  ..No one knew the difference!!  I like spicy so anyone else should try a little chili at a time, but it was perfect for me.

MUCH better than I expected! I thought I'd like this; I LOVED it. My boyfriend (who HATES anything "sour" or vinegary) came in the kitchen as I was starting it, said "Ew, are you making something with vinegar?" and commented on the smell again a few minutes later...REALLY liked it as well!! Awesome recipe :)

I love this sauce for 3 reasons- you need very few ingredients, it is easy, and only takes about 20 minutes. If you don't have minced garlic on hand, garlic powder works. I have been making this for a few years now, and it is excellent! It goes well with any asian style food. I always get compliments when I bring this to parties with my homemade eggrolls.

This dipping sauce is fantastic!  We had it with homemade salmon patties and loved it.  I did follow other reviewer's suggestions and cut back on the red pepper flakes.  I used 1 tsp and it was plenty hot for us.  Thank you for a great recipe.

Wish I could give it four and a half stars as it was almost perfect. The thing is, it's a bit too thin. But a bit of corn starch and extra cook tome helps with that. Personally, I add a little bit more of everything except the rice vinegar and salt. I've made this so many times to go with my store bought egg rolls. It is much tastier than the stuff it comes with and I actually know the ingredients.  Just remember, don't accidentally or otherwise inhale the vinegar steam!

This sauce is perfect for so many dishes that it's a permanent fixture in my fridge. I do add a Tbsp of cornstarch (mixed in a small amount of water) to the boiling vinegar to make the sauce thicker. And feel free to substitute the dried red pepper flakes with Chili Garlic Sauce (Huy Fong, for example) if you don't have it on hand.

WE loved it! Made  it as a dip for chicken nuggets. My husband at first said "why are you making a dip, I don't want any". In the end he finished it all! Thanks so much. I am making it again to night.

This is the best asian dipping sauce I have found. It is perfect for wontons, eggrolls, lumpia and whatever!! I did add about 3T of cornstarch mixed with 2T if water to the sauce while is was simmering and that made it the perfect dipping consistancy for dipping.

I love this sauce, it goes great with potstickers & eggrolls! I usually make a large batch & freeze it. Then just take out what you need because it doesn't actually freeze solid, just thick. I have kept it in the freezer for up to 3 months & still tastes great. You can also adjust the spiciness to your liking.

Tasty little sauce. I added a healthy pinch of onion and garlic powder after tasting. Those spices didn't muddle the color but raised the flavor a notch. Good as is too. May be too spicy for some, but not us. Wait until cool to really judge the taste of it, because this needs a chance to meld the flavors.
