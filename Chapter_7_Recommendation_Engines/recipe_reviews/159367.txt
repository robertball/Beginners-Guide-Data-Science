Oh, Sunny!  This one is a winner!  Just tried it on some romaine and radicchio...DELISH!  I was all pumped about making this and got my ingredients out only to realize that I was out of red wine vinegar, so I subbed some white balsamic and it worked beautifully! This stuff is awesome! I can't wait to use it as a marinade! SOOOOO GOOD!! Thanks for sharing it with us!

Couldn't be easier to make and it has a wonderful light clean taste to it. The only changes I made was to add 1 Tbsp. of frozen grated ginger, and I was out of Marjoram and had to substitute it with some Greek Oregano. Thanks for sharing this one!

This recipe is fabulous...VERY versatile..I made it with the intention of just a salad dressing but ended up steaming asparagus and drizzling some on before serving...very good. I recommend always having this in your fridge!

No rice wine vinegar, only had balsamic. Didn't matter anyway. Still out of sight. Freaking insane. Had this over a spinach salad and darn near licked the bowl. NOM.

Maybe I did something wrong, but I didn't think this was as great as everyone said it was.  It was just salad dressing.  That and I spent like $20 buying the ingredients.

Good recipe - although a bit too "zesty" for me - but I do like dressings on the sweet side  :)   I made it a second time and added 1/2 cup sugar and was very good.  Thank you!

I liked this. The reviewers who said it was "just salad dressing" are correct--there's nothing here that overwhelms. You could always add/subtract flavors that interest you at the moment from this dressing--it's a wonderful base. I had to add a bit more sugar, myself, but I do that with almost every dressing. Tomorrow I think I'll add ginger and Sriracha to the leftovers; the option to change it up to match your mood is there with this base!  I especially liked the sesame oil! Thanks, SunnyByrd!

Wow! What a great dressing.  The rice vinegar and sesame gives it a very asian flair.  I think next time I will try adding a little ginger too.  Will be making this often.

THIS WAS AWFUL! I followed the recipe EXACTLY and can't understand the rave reviews.  I think the sesame oil may ruin and overpower the taste, but I won't try again to figure it out.  =(

OMG.  This is the most delicious salad dressing!  I made it just as written, exept I didn't have any red wine vinegar, so I used 1 T. white vinegar and 1 T. red wine.  All I know is that this is the dressing I've been looking for!  I'm a personal chef, and I can't wait to try it on my clients!  Thanks, Byrdhouse!

I keep this salad dressing in the fridge all the time. I leave out the salt (DH is on low sodium diet)and it's still wonderful! This recipe really is a savior for us. Thanks!

This is good stuff!!  We love sesame oil and thought it added a nice touch to the dressing.  I followed the directions mostly but did an emulsion to cut down on separation of the ingredients, just a personal preference.  I added all of my ingredients in the food processor except the oils, turned it on and slowly added the oil.  It turned out great and got rave reviews from my mom and the hubby.

I felt like Italian dressing for my salad, and this one looked good.  Plus, I love rice vinegar.  I only made enough for 2 salads, in case I didn't like it.  The honey made it a bit too sweet for me--I'll cut back next time, but it was still very good.  Next time I'll make a full amount in a bottle to save in the fridge.  The herbs were good and the combination of vinegars went really well together.  My salad was comprised of lettuce, cucumber, tomato, carrot, red bell pepper, radishes, toasted almonds, and some cheddar cheese.  Good salad!

Typical of anything that comes from the Byrdhouse, this is a versatile recipe.  I made/ate this yesterday, but with sesame oil, good things happen with age!  This is no exception.  On salad for the last two nights, I have loved this dressing.  I have to tell you that tonight on avocados, this is nothing but spectacular!  But as my dear hubby pointed out, this will only be better used as a marinade.  We declared this as KEEPER!  Thanks!

We love this dressing! I’ve made it over and over and over. I like to use my leftover glass jar from lemon or lime juice and add all the ingredients and shake it up. So easy that way... just one dish for mixing and storing. I use avocado oil or olive oil in place of vegetable oil (and usually 1/2 cup instead of a whole cup of oil) and then add a little water if needed. If you don’t have dry mustard powder, prepared spicy mustard is also awesome in here!

I followed the directions precisely- maybe a first for me. I found this too sweet and the sesame oil was an 'off note". I corrected it by going back and doubling the oil, vinegar and spices and adding a bit of dijon. It is OK- but I will not make it again- and now I have LOTS of it!  I think I will use it at a marinade just to use it up.

Thank you SunnyByrd for the best salad dressing ever!  The blend of flavors are absolutely perfect.  It goes well on any type of salad too...chopped, garden, spinach.  This is my new go-to dressing.  Thank you again...you rock!

I am sorry but both my husband and I thought it lacked something mainly flavor. I think it was a bit too oily. I doctored it up with a little salt and  some regular dijon mustard and garlic powder.  I would put more sesame oil in and less veg. oil. if I make it again.

MMMMMMM, so good, LOVED this!  We really love to make our salad dressings, so much better than store bought.  I used an herbes de provence mixture as I did not have marjoram (although have since heard that oregano is pretty much the same!).  Regardless, I think that any type of herb mix you use would work beautifully depending on what flavour you were looking for!  My only other *small* change is that I reduced the veg oil, but that is common for me as I typically reduce the oil to vinegar ratio for any homemade dressing.  Keeper for sure and will absolutely make again!  Will really enjoy the extra this week for salads as I had lots left!  Thanks SunnyByrd!

great! thanks for sharing this sunny. i was lazy and used my country herb spice grinder instead of measuring out each spice. the addition of dry mustard in a salad dressing was new for me. i love recipes that use the "not so everyday spices" from the rack

Normally the only dressing the boyfriend and I like is ranch. We were looking for something a little different this time, and we both really enjoyed it, and recipe was very easy to make!

Delicious!  I was looking for a low sodium dressing with lots of flavor and this is perfect. I will make this again (and again and again)  using fresh herbs as they come into season.

I've made this a few times and absolutely love it. I didn't have any marjoram, so I used oregano. Otherwise, I made it per the recipe. I enjoy making my own dressings because then you know exactly what is in them. Thank you for sharing a great one!

Definitely not my favorite dressing recipe, but it does make for a good marinade.  To me a Tbsp of sesame oil is too much, I would only do a tsp unless you really like the flavor of sesame oil.  Maybe as it sits and the flavors blend it won't be the stand out flavor.

I made this 3 years ago, as written, for my daughter's teacher appreciation luncheon, in a 2 quart container and had nothing left. I have been asked each year since to make this and for the recipe. My husband and daughter said it is sooo good they could drink it, LOL. Thanks Sunny Bird for a great recipe!

Bought the large bag of mixed broccoli,kale ect greens, pumpkin seeds, cranberries. So I tried this recipe with it. It was perfect. I only had about two tablespoons of rice vinegar, so I added just white vinegar to make a half a cup and added a little sugar.  When I opened the bag I saw dressing was included. I know this one was better

This is one of my favorite dressings.  If I eat anything asian inspired this is the dressing we use.  My husband thinks the sesame oil is overpowering but I think it is perfect as is.

It called for too much oil and didn't have much flavor.  If you add a lot more spices and maybe some balsamic vinegar it's not bad.

I was very pleased with this recipe.  I didn't have any dried or fresh marjoram, so I subbed my own dried oregano.  I also subbed 1/2 C. pure olive oil (not EVOO) for half the vegetable oil.  When I tasted it right after I made it, I was NOT impressed.  The next day, though, it tasted delicious.  I used my KA stick blender to mix and it got a creamy consistency.  It does separate, but a quick shake brings it back together.

It's not that it wasn't good necessarily, I just didn't like it. I guess fresh garlic is not my thing, I love it cooked but not fresh like in this. Thanks anyway! I gave the rest to my mother who loved it.

We liked this one a lot!  I scaled this back to only 4 servings so we could give it a try.  It has a light flavor and tasted great on baby greens with green onions and thinly sliced red, yellow and green bell pepper.  As another reviewer suggested, next time I would add everything to my blender and then slowly  drizzle in the oil so the dressing would become emulsified.  I might also try adding a little paprika to give it some color.  Thank you, SunnyByrd, for a new and different salad dressing!

I loved the idea of sesame oil, plus I already had all ingredients except one (out of dried mustard, substituted a little squirt of Dijon). I really like this dressing, except I found it too sweet for my taste even though I cut back on the honey. Other than those two changes kept to the recipe. Next time I think I'll increase the seasame oil just a bit and reduce the honey even more to about a teaspoon. I'm glad the instructions specify letting it sit overnight. I've always found with uncooked dressings that use dried herbs it takes a while for the flavors to infuse and for the herbs to soften. Otherwise the texture of the herbs is unpleasant. Thanks for a great dressing I'll be making often!

We liked this dressing a lot - Tangy with a subtle hint of sweetness! I added some freshly chopped basil and parsley to the dressing. I cut down a bit on the oil and used EVOO instead of vegetable oil. Thank you!

This was so good. My family loved it. I love the hint of sweetness that is in the dressing. I don't have a garlic press so I beat it with a meat mallet until the garlic was mush. I can't wait to try this on some chicken as a marinade. Yum! I'll be making this often. Thanks for the recipe!

Love this! I was hesitant about the Sesame Oil, I don't really like it, but it's very subtle in this dressing. What a fantastic tasting salad, not too tangy or sweet. I did use a bit less honey than called for. Thanks for the recipe!

Sunnybyrd your salad dressing is amazing! The sesame oil is the key ingredient and it gives a nice flavor. Served with baby greens, carrots, feta cheese, pears and some sesame seeds. Delicious!

Don't waste your money on store bought dressings when you can make this up in a jiffy and tastes so much better!  A nice fresh, crisp taste...really brings out all those veggies in your salad.  I'm looking forward to use this as a marinate on veggies for the grill this summer.
