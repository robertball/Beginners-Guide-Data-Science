I've been following this recipe for years - and thought I should add my reveiw.... my husband is from Colombia also, and says that this tastes just like his mom used to make.  My whole family love it... we have it with rice and fried plantains.

I have made this several times in my pressure cooker.  Any meat cooked in the pressure cooker is tender - and this is a nice blend of potatoes/onions with a sauce. The sauce is thin - but is really good on rice.

You can also cook the flank and after it is tender put in the oven for 20 minutes. I just want to add that the real name of this is Sobrebarriga (with B and all together)

My son made this for his Spanish class project & it was the definite hit of the class!!! Everyone raved about how good it was!  We don't have a pressure cooker & were making too much to go in the slow cooker, so we browned the meat & put everything in a pot on top of the stove & cooked it on low (after bringing it to a boil first) for about 3 hours.  Sooooo delicious!!  We'll be making this for our own family!

This was ok.  I like the idea but it needs a bit more flavor.  I'm not very good at this kind of thing, but maybe some cumin & chile powder to spice it up a bit.  Any suggestions anyone?  I would like to try it again.

This was very good. I tried lowing the sodium by eliminating the salt, but it is too bland without it. So I would not reccomend skipping the salt. When I added a touch it was wonderful. I do not have a pressure cooker so I used my slow cooker. I browned the meat and then threw everything in, and cooked it for 4 hours. I used a can of busweiser and may try a darker beer next time to see how that goes. I served it with brown rice because that was all I had on hand. Yummy dish. Thank you!

Such a weird combination, but the end result is so good. The whole family liked it.

The flavor was great! I used cooking onion since I didn't have red.  I used bouillion since I didn't have beef broth.  The flank steak fell apart but still needed to be cut across the grain to make it more chewable. I would certainly make again.

This is pretty close to my recipe. I've been making for years. I grew up in Colombia. My husband is Colombian.
