This was very good.  I seldom follow recipes for marinades, but this came out great.  The fresh basil added a great flavor.

i made it exactly according to the recipe and it is a complex subtle blend of flavors (used it on pork tenderloin) . Excellent and i rate it as 4.5+.

We used this for thick boneless pork chops. My only change next time would be to use less wine. I've never used basil in a marinade before. Nice touch. This is definitely a red meat marinade. Thanks Basil Brad!
