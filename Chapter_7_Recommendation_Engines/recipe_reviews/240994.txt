Lemon chicken is a favorite in my house and I make it pretty much the same way...simple. One thing I do not do is to reduce the chicken broth/lemon juice mixture. Because gravy is preferred here I saute the garlic and add the chicken & sauces. When the chicken is done I add a bit of cornstarch mixed with water into the pan to make a gravy.

I made this recipe with 6 very large bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs, which is what I had on hand, therefore increasing all ingredients proportionately.   These thighs took much longer to cook than boneless breasts would, but oh, my, were they ever worth the wait!  And next time I will definitely add even more garlic and lemon.  The chicken was just utterly delicious, tender and moist.  The sauce produced was beyond description in tastiness--we had it over dill rice, and we had to have seconds, it was so good!  My husband LOVED it!  Will most definitely make again--so easy!

Just okay. Not fabulous. I added a bit of extra lemon juice, and that was definitely the dominant flavor; I used an extra clove of garlic, but that got lost somewhere. I also added probably about half a teaspoon of herbs de Provence. I think it would be largely improved with a touch of cornstarch in the sauce, and then the sauce just poured over the chicken.

This has become one of my family’s favorite recipes!  My kids aged 15, 11, 11 and 8 absolutely love it!  I have made it as stated as well as added fresh garlic to it.  Either way it is fantastic and so very easy to make!  I give this 5 stars for ease, flavor and kid approved!  I serve with egg noodles for the delicious sauce and broccoli.  Thanks for the recipe!!!

This turned out yummy with minimal ingredients. Most of which I didn't have so I used unicorn flames and fairy dust jk, I didn't have lemons so I used bottled lemon, and garlic powder on the raw chicken breasts rather than actual lemon and garlic. I didn't even have chicken stock! I mixed water with half a bullion cube and I added two tbsp of corn starch to thicken the sauce. I used butter to cook it and threw in some green onion. And finally I skipped the step where you take the chicken out and in again. Laziness prevails!

Really tasty and easy. I added the lemon zest when I added the stock. It melted into the sauce and added a pop of lemon.

Delicious!!! I added some extra lemon because I’m a lemon head. I love this! I put it on a bed of rice pilaf for dinner.

I used skinless chicken legs. I would have used more lemon juice and thickened up the sauce up a bit.  It was good though.

Omg. This was the easiest and tastiest chicken I've had in a LONG time. I used chicken thighs instead of breasts, which just resulted in a flavorful skin to add to the yumminess. The sauce was just a tad too salty (I did salt & pepper the thighs before cooking out of habit), so I added some milk. The fiance asked when I was making this again, something he only does when he really loves a dish.

Good recipe! I pounded chicken and dredged it through flour mixed with a little cayenne, smoked paprika and a little mixed herb blend before cooking and then topped it off with a fresh parsley marinated in lemon juice before serving. yum!

It's easy, but not very tasty.  I should have seasoned the meat a little.
