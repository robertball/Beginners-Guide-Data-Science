This was great.  To make it vegetarian, and cut down on the fat...saut√© the onions in PAM and use liquid smoke to flavor instead of bacon grease.

I saw this recipe some time ago, but finally made it today when I saw that it was featured in allrecipes "The Daily Dish."  Sure am glad I did!  I'm not a big eater, but I could have eaten all of this...I think it would also make a great appetizer dip garnished with sour cream and served with tortilla chips.

This was absolutely delicious--I served this as a "bean dip" with a little sour cream on top and tortilla rounds on the side. We loved it. NO leftovers. This recipe's a keeper! NOTE: This served four, not two.

Made with carne asada. We all loved it. Next night another of my sons came over and with the carne leftovers I made this again so he could try it. He loved it too. Peanut oil instead of grease.

Quite good. I didn't have any bacon in the house, so I sauted the onions in stock. The pico was really tasty and made the beans somethign different

We loved it! I used white balsamic vinegar, added a bit extra honey, as well as half a chopped serrano pepper (seeds removed). I used chicken broth instead of water just because I had some open in teh fridge. We loved the pico de gallo & had it on our fajitas as well as the black beans. Thansk for a tasty recipe SPEARL20!

Very delicious and so quick and easy to make. We had some great fresh tomatoes from the farmer's market. We served this as a side with Pollo Fajitas on AR's. I will say the bacon grease is the key to the flavor in the black beans.

Excellent recipe and very quick to make. If you don't have bacon grease, just use olive oil and lightly saute red pepper flakes before adding the black beans for a nice kick! This is a family favorite and when we have devoured the black beans we pull out the taco chips to finish off the wonderful pico de gallo.

This picco de gallo was delicious. We ended up just having it with brown rice because I was out of beans. I can't wait to try it with black beans!

The beans were okay, but they weren't really anything to write home about (but worth trying and easy to make). The pico was what really stood out for me. O-U-T-S-T-A-N-D-I-N-G. I know that pico de gallo seems really simple to make, but I've been unable to find a recipe that tasted anything like the pico from my favorite mexican restaurant here in Austin until now. The only thing I did different was to use white wine vinegar since we were out of balsamic.

I'm sad that I served this to company because it was really bland. Maybe my mistake was using real black beans instead of canned? I won't be making this again. Sorry.

EXCELLENT! I don't know what I liked better...the pico de gallo or the beans cooked in the bacon grease, lol. I used green onions and 1 seeded jalapeno in the pico and sweet onion in the beans. All of the flavors went very well together. Made this to go with our tacos tonight and it was loved by all! I would just make the pico de gallo to use as a dip or put over tacos too! Will definately be using this recipe often! Thanks for sharing. :)

Delicious!!! We used Pico de Gallo we had already mixed up, so I can't comment on the Pico de Gallo, but the beans couldn't have been easier, and the bacon grease gave them just wonderful flavor.  We will be making this again and again! Thank you for sharing your recipe!

This was SO good. I'm a vegetarian, so I didn't use any meat product, just olive oil. I didn't have much in the house in the way of fresh vegetables, so I didn't have the Pico de Gallo on top, but just the beans were delicious!

Super simple and very quick! Even my "where's the meat" DH liked it. I followed the recipes exactly except I left in the bacon I had cooked for the grease. The fresh pico was fabulous! It would also work as a nice accompanyment to chips. One thing I would warn everyone about is to make sure you look at the serving yield for the original recipe. I didn't and realized it almost at the end of cooking. A quick addition of another can of black beans, another garlic clove, and a little more red onion worked fine, but if you only had enough ingredients for the original recipe, it might throw someone off. Thanks for the great keeper recipe!

Delicious. I love my bacon grease like any good southern girl, although I try not to use it too often or too much.  I omitted the cilantro (hate it), but left everything else the same.  Served over millet which I cooked in chicken broth.  Yummy and (relatively) healthy.

This was great!  I'm always looking for quick lunches to bring to work and this does the trick.  I also omitted the bacon and substitued olive oil.  The rest of the recipe I followed exactly and it was superb!  Thank you for a simple and healthy option for mexican food lovers!

The Pico De Gallo was excellent! The balsamic and honey are an excellent combination.  I used about half the cilantro the recipe called for, and made it with three tomatoes for a bigger crowd.  Will DEFINITELY make again!

Nice bowl of soup or a meal in a bowl! I usually bake the beans my self in a pressure cooker. Also, I add soft white cheese (queso fresco). The bacon fat is KEY to get rid of the 'canned' flavor and hit into the mexican authenticity!

Although I thoroughly enjoyed this recipe, the rest of the family did not like it at all.  I thinks it was because of the beans...the Pico de Gallo part was great.

I absolutely loved these beans. The pico de gallo was wonderful. We added a dollop of sour cream and voila!

I definitely will make this recipe again. Wonderful flavor in the beans. How can you go wrong with bacon fat, right. The pico de gallo was so delicious I would use it often just to dip tortilla chips as a salsa. Wonderful mixture of flavors. Thankyou.

Very good... especially the Pico!  My only complaint was I didn't make enough and I don't even like beans normally. =)

Excellent!  I changed nothing.  This one's a keeper!  I served it with Zatarain's Mexican Rice on the side.  The Pico de Gallo is great with that too.  Thank you for a lovely addition to my recipe box.

The pico recipe is great!  I made the pico only to put on carne asada tacos and got rave reviews.  So easy to put together.

The next time I made the beans and served them as a side dish - pico optional for those who didn't care for it.  The beans were very good - bacon grease adds a wonderful flavor.  I added more water than it called for because they tend to thicken as the heat - but I also mashed them a bit so it wouldn't be too watery.

Will keep to make again - and the pico is definitely a keeper!

This was a very good, straight forward pico de gallo recipe. I served this with Fish Tacos from this site.
