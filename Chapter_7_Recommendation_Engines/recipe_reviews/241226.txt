Very Good! I do not own a rice cooker, so I just did this on the stove and that worked out great. We really enjoyed the coconut flavor, and loved the addition of the toasted coconut on top. I would make this again! Thanks for sharing. :)

Thanks for the recipe, I loved how easy it was, and adding turmeric gives it a beautiful color. I though the first steps defeated the whole purpose of using a rice cooker, so I skipped boiling ingredients together, and just dumped the liquids and spices in the rice cooker, gave it a good whisk, added the rice and pressed start. It came out just fine. My only substitution was I eliminated the salt and used vegetarian "no chicken" bullion'.

I had started making this dish and thought I was out of Turmeric (found it hiding in the cupboard the next day). I substituted the same measurement of turmeric with curry powder and the rice tasted great, especially with the toasted coconut flakes. My only complaint would be that the rice seemed a little sticky/mushy when it was done (used the rice cooker), but the next day the rice was nice and fluffy (excess liquid probably removed/evaporated while reheating). Turmeric will give it a nicer flavor and color than curry powder for sure! Rating this recipe 4 stars as I feel the amount of liquid should be reduced to perhaps 1 cup total liquid to 1 cup rice. Note that there's no indication of the type of rice to be used with this recipe, and I used 2 cups long grain white rice. Will be making this again, with the turmeric, and adjust the amount of liquid.
