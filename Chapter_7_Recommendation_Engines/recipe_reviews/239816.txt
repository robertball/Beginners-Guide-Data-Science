I substituted almond oil instead of canola or oil and lime juice instead of lemon juice in mixed in the blender. This salad dressing is delicious and perfect for a Christmas salad.

Unfortunately, no one in my house cared for this dressing. The flavor of the cinnamon with the tang from the vinegar and Dijon, was just too much for us, so sorry...
