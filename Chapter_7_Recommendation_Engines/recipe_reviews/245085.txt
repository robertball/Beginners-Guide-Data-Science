This is my recipe and for the life of me I cannot figure out  how  the 29 minutes of cook time was arrived at during editing? Prep time is 5 minutes and cook time is 20 minutes which equals a total of 25 minutes start to finish. Step 4 can and should be done while the squash is roasting for 20 minutes. If you start the quinoa as soon as you stick the squash in the oven (my original instructions) then it all comes out done at  the same time and you are ready to rock and roll.

Loved this indeed! The texture of the quinoa, squash and pumpkin seeds are exceptional; mixed with the subtle roasted flavor of the butter is just amazing. This was the perfect companion to roast chicken. A definite addition to your Thanksgiving table too.Thank you for the recipe.

Made it tonight just as written and my daughter loved it. The rest of us found it was a bit bland. I added maybe a teaspoon (I eyeballed it) each of salt, garlic powder, and onion powder plus a little black pepper. Then it was delicious.

Followed this recipe, somewhat loosely...still turned out great! I had no chicken broth in the kitchen so I used an onion soup mix, made a broth with that, and used white sugar instead of brown.  It was  a bit salty thanks to the soup packet.  I added a few slices of baked chicken breast to boost the protein content.  I will definitely make this again and follow the recipe to the letter.

Very nice healthy recipe.I used Earth Balance in place of butter
(lactose intolerant) i make my own broth so i used that.I  had red quinoa, which i use more then the plain. 
Easy to put together and very tasty.It has everything i enjoy to eat.It is a keeper and will make again. Thank you Soup Loving Nicole for the recipe.
