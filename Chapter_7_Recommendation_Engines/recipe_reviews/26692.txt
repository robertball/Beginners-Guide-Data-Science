I loved this, but made some changes after reading ALL of the reviews and making it several times.  To cut back on the sweetness and on the juice, I used NO added sugar in the fruit.   I used orange marmalade for the preserves and froz peaches in place of raspberries and there was plenty of juice and it was quite sweet.  (Sugar draws juice out, so it will have more liquid with the added sugar!)
Also, I used Fuji apples which have less tendency to turn brown, and added the apples last so that they could be stirred into the other fruit to coat the apples.  I had NO browning that way.
To save time with  the chips, I first sprayed 4 tortillas at a time with butter spray, front and back, and then cut them with the pizza cutter.   Then I put the sugar mix ...1 c sugar to 1 t cinnamon,,,into a bowl and dredged the chips 2 at a time.   One batch of the sugar mix did 2+ batches of the chips.  I simply 'baggied' the remainder and used it another time.  I did NOT spray them after sugaring.  They don't need it if you spray both sides first.
They did best at about 9-10 minutes baking.   
Overall, everyone loved this and neither the fruit nor chips were to sweet.

Here's a tip to save time chopping:

Buy an egg slicer (available on the kitchen aisle of most grocery stores for about $4). It works great on strawberries!!!
Just put Them in and slice them and then turn the other way and slice again. It dices them perfectly. I also use it for other soft fruits (kiwi, peaches etc. Just peel & cut into chunks first & use it the same way as with strawberries.

I have made this recipe numerous times & everyone ALWAYS LOVES IT!  It can take some time to make.  I recommend chopping fruit with a food chopper (pampered chef has an excellent one).  When I am really crammed with time I buy my cinamom sugar chips from Trader Joe's or if I'm lucky I sometimes find them at a grocery store.  When I make the chips myself, after thoroughly cleaning my sink out I put a dinner plate in the sink & stack all the tortillas on it & spray both sides of the tortilla (4 at a time) with I can't believe its not butter or some other butter flavor spray.  I then place the cinamon/sugar mix in the container the cinamon usually comes in (since it has the top with holes to sprinkle with) & sprinkle both sides of the tortilla BEFORE CUTTING it.  This helps tremendously with the mess!  Out of the sink on a seperate plate I cut 4 tortillas at a time with a pizza cutter.  I didn't follow the cooking time the recipe reccomends (my oven is old) I would tap a couple of chips & once they felt a little crispy & were golden brown they are done! (the chips turn crispier as they cool) I usually use apricot preserves, & granny smith apples or fuji apples.  As previous reviewers recomend, I cut the apples last to prevent browning.  I sprinkle cinnamon & sugar to my taste for the salsa mix (I cut out brown sugar...to skip a step) I thought with the chips the recipe just didn't need as much sugar.  This recipe is very versatile so play around with it!  I hope this helps!

I made the chips 2 days ahead of time and the salsa the morning of.  I was worried since the fruit was out of season, but it turned out great!  I also made a whole tortilla into a bowl, I baked it in a round dish and then served the salsa in that surrounded by the chips.  Everyone raved about it!  Thanks for a great recipe.

Very tasty!  I cut the sugars in half, used plain ol' grape jelly and added blueberries...YUM.  After I sprayed & sugared the chips, I stuffed them in my mini muffin tins so that they had the "scoop" affect & everybody raved.  I also doubled the chip amount, they went quick!  The salsa would also be good with angel food cake or even pound cake, mmmmmm. Thanks Annie!

I made this recipe for a school function of about 30 people.  Only 3 or 4 enjoyed the salsa.  I added some fresh shredded coconut as well as mango.  Almost everyone loved the cinnamon tortillas.  To make my life easier I sprayed the cut tortillas with the cooking spray, threw them all into a gallon size zippered storage bag, and then added my cinnamon and sugar mix.  After a few shakes all the chips were coated on both sides and I just layed them on the pans.  Worked a lot easier than doing it one at a time.  Overall, it was a miniature version of a fruit salad.  But the chips were good without the "salsa".

I took this as an appetizer to a "cooking circle"--it won best dish that night! The girls could NOT stop eating it. Everyone LOVED this--especially the salsa. I too, would probably cut the sugar in the recipe. I used apricot preserves and everyone thought it added just the right touch. Very fun recipe and unusual! I can't wait to make it again!!

I have made this for a family party, a tailgate party & my company picnic.  It receives RAVE reviews every time.  I've lost count of the people who have requested the recipe.  Young, old, everyone loves this recipe!

I've substituted frozed mixed berries for the fresh and that worked pretty well and cut down on the prep time.  I also double the chips, because so many people eat those alone.

Took this to a ladies luncheon at my church and it was devoured!  My husband asked me to make it again because there weren't any leftovers for him!  Just a tip...Tostito's now has available the flour tortilla chips, you can just heat them up on a cookie sheet in the oven and the oils will reappear, which will allow the cinnamon-sugar to stick to the chip...just toss the chips and sugar together in a large ziploc bag it will save you a lot of time!

Wow! This needs to come with a warning: Highly Addictive! This was a beautiful combination of colors and flavors. And, what's great about this is it's low fat and good for you too. No matter what assortment of fresh fruit you use it's bound to be good so use your favorites and use the recipe as a guide. I used a combination of apples, strawberries, peaches, and kiwi. I left out the sugar as the fruit has enough of that on it's own. For the preserves, again use your favorite. I chose seedless raspberry. For the cinnamon chips I used reduced fat tortillas and cut them with a pizza cutter which made things a lot easier. I sprayed them with butter flavored Pam and sprinkled them with the cinnamon sugar. I baked them at 350 for 8 minutes flipped them and baked them for another 7 minutes. They were crispy, sweet and delicious - next time I would double the amount because they went fast. This got a lot of compliments not only for taste, but for creativity. I'll definitely make this again - great recipe!

I took this dish to a tropical theme birthday party and it was a hit. I made the chips the day before. I first cut the tortillas in a triangle, laid them side by side on a parchment lined cookie sheet. I then sprayed them with spray butter and sprinkled them with the cinnamon and sugar . When baking, make sure the chips are crisp before removing from oven, in my opinion it is better for them to be over-crisp then under crisp.  The other thing I did is use fresh pineapple, hollowing out the center and using the shell as a dish.

HELPFUL TIPS AFTER READING ALL THE REVIEWS: If you're in a crunch, try some cinnamon wheat thins or cinnamon pita chips down the snack aisle.  The tortillas tend to take some time to make, so I'd get started on them first so you're salsa doesn't get all soggy if you're making a big batch of chips! And use 1C sugar&1tsp cinnamon.  They're addicting & can see why so many people (including myself) eat them "as is."  I wasn't sure I'd believe that you don't have to over drench your tortillas in cinnamon, but it's true.  One quick dip & there's plenty of yummyness.  I've NEVER had any problems w/the apple (fuji) browning, but if you do ...dip the slices in lemon juice to prevent it.  I just eye the amount I want to add for everything to suit the number of people we are feeding.  There's no need for adding sugar b/c the fruit preserves & the fruit adds enough flavor.  I have better luck w/finding fresh blueberries than I do raspberries, and I prefer them!  People are always impressed with this dish & you really are a hero to all the hungry tummies, so thanks for posting this recipe!

This was really tasty.  I brought it to a potluck, and everyone wanted the recipe.  The key is small pieces so it really is like salsa!

This appetizer was so well received! Everyone loved it. I was very pleased.

I cut 8-inch tortillas into quarters with scissors, brushed both sides of each triangle with melted butter, and tossed them all in a large ziploc bag with a cup of cinnamon and sugar for a good shaking. Some came out less covered than others -- great for different tastes among the guests.

Tip: Using a muffin tray instead of a baking sheet shaped the triangles into scoops! Perfect for dipping into the salsa.

This was delicious.  I did cut the sugars and I felt my salsa was a bit tart, although those eating it did not agree.  I dipped my apples in lime juice to avoid browning and found a slightly different recipe for the chips.  Brush them lightly with water, place on foil lined cookie sheet sprayed with cooking spray, sprinkle generously with cinnamon sugar and bake 4-5 min at 500 degrees.  These chips turned out better for me.  Kids and husband enjoyed the left overs.  This was great, thanks for sharing.

This recipe is wonderful.  I changed it a bit to fit in to my diet plan and make the recipe smaller.  I used 2 kiwi's, 1 apple, 1 cup strawberries, and 1/2 cup frozen berry mix.  I also sub'd splenda and light sugar free strawberry preserves.  I used 98% fat-free tortillas and a cinnamon and splenda blend for the chips.  I also pre-cut the tortillas with a pizza cutter and dip them in to the cinnamon mix.  I cooked each batch of chips 5 min on each side.  This made of a wonderfully sweet, filling, and low-fat snack.  I will absolutely make this again.  Thanks Ann!!!! :)

How do I love this?  Let me count the ways...  let's see, I've made it 3 times in the past week.  I cannot say enough good things about this.  The chips taste good with honey as well; in fact, I prefer them to sopapillas you get in a restaurant.  I've been using the frozen berry mix with various other fruits, and my latest preserves has not been preserves, but 3 T of apricot pie filling.  I also add some light cool whip to the salsa/salad which brings it to a new high.  Thank you so much, Annie, for the recipe!

I served this at a 50th wedding reception and it was a big hit. Since berries were out of season, I used frozen "Berry Mix" with strawberries, blueberries,blackberries and raspberries. Then added an apple, kiwi and fresh peach. Pulsed all fruit VERY quickly in food processor and was done. No cutting required but do be careful about not over-pulsing or you will have a liquid.  It was pretty and tasted great.

This was fantastic!  I'd had something similar before, and it was everything I was hoping for.  I will say that I don't think the time listed for the recipe takes chopping time into account.  I ended up doubling the amount of chips that I made, and because I made sure to only put a single layer on the pan, it took me a couple of hours to make two batches.  It was well worth it though. I took the advice of other reviewers and shook them in a big bag with the cinnamon sugar and it seemed to work well. As for the salsa, I made it twice in two days. The first time, I followed the recipe exactly. I tried using my egg slicer for the kiwi and ended up breaking the slicer. I just cut everything by hand, making very tiny pieces because it needs to fit on a chip. It turned out very pretty and everyone at my bookclub loved it and couldn't believe that I made it, especially the chips. The second time I made the salsa, it was just for my husband and I, so it didn't need to be pretty.  This time, I just cut up each fruit and pulsed them in the food processor for a few seconds... so much faster!!!  I added blackberries and blueberries, and didn't have anymore raspberries, but it seems to be delicious no matter what fruit you add.  I will say that the addition of the blackberries kind of muddied the color, so if you are going for presentation, be cautious of that.  I love this recipe and will definitely make it again.

I took this to a party this past weekend and it did not go over very well.  More people ate the chips than the salsa.  I don't know why.  I really liked it.  I guess they weren't a fruit crowd.

Very tasty.  To cut time it takes to make chips.  Spray surface of wax paper with butter spray and lay out first tortilla.  Lay next tortilla on top and spray.  Continue until all 10 are in stack.  Cut while stacked and separate.  Place 1/4 of chips in plastic sealed bag with 1/4 of cinnamon mixture.  Shake to coat chips.  Lay out on tray and spray again.  Bake

I used this recipe at Super Bowl, with some changes in presentation, and it was amazing.  I used a frozen berry mix and apples, strawberry preserves and just a bit of sugar.  Next time I will omit the sugars.  Instead of serving in a bowl as a salsa I put a mix of cream cheese and marshmallow cream in a 9x12 pan then topped it with the fruit salsa.  I thought it might be too girly for the guys but they loved it.  It was like eating fruit topped cheese cake with yummy cinnamon chips!

I have to rate this more based upon client input than my own taste test. I tasted the salsa and chips separately, which were both good but I'm sure they're better together. I used square wontons instead of tortillas, sprayed each side with the butter spray, then dredged in the cinnamon sugar. I pressed the wonton squares into a mini cupcake pan and baked. Right before serving filled the cups with the salsa. I had people run up to me just to tell me how great they were.

I made this for the first time last night and took it to a family BBQ - it was a HUGE hit with both adults and kids alike.  The recipe says it only makes 10 servings but we ate it as an appetizer and there was plenty for at least twice that.  For the chips, I used 20 smaller tortillas - I like this size better.  The cinnamon sugar is really easy to make too - just mix 1/2 cup white sugar for every 1 tbl of cinnamon.

I wanted this to be more salsa than salad so shredded the apples and mashed everything with a potato masher.  I left out the sugar as per reviews  and while it does taste fantastic, it could definately use some sugar haha..  The chips are  awesome - I did the melted butter on one side, stacked and cut all 10 at once with a pizza cutter.  Shook em in a bag with cinn/sugar ... was so easy and no mess... thanks for the tips!  One thing I'll add bcuz I saw someone  mentioned it, is you do not turn these chips over as they bake.   Single layer, both sides crisp up perfectly.  I had two foil lined sheets going so it was pretty steady :)

Great appetizer! When making the chips, I spray them first (both sides) then cut them, then put them in a ziploc and shake them with the sugar.  Baking them on my baking stone yields the best results!

This recipe is YUMMY!  Every person i have passed it on to has said it has become his or her favorite.  Fruit salsa is easy to make, and it is best when you make a lot so you have a lot to eat!  It's fun to snack on while watching tv or a movie, and there's no fat and little sugar.  You can try it with just the preserves and no sugar in the fruit as well.  i definitely recommend fruit salsa!

I use this web site more then any for years now. I don't ususally review. This recipe has given me more compliments then any other ever! I cook a lot and share what I cook. I think the key to this is to make sure you take the time to cut everything nice and small. Thank-you so much for the recipe.

I was so thrilled with this recipe!  Make sure to let the fruit, sugar and preserves chill because that's how you get a juicy "salsa".  I can't wait to use this recipe again and impress dinner guests!  :)

I think this is my favorite recipe!!! I use my apple peeler/corer/slicer and dice the fruit very small, I also use only fresh fruit (pears, papaya, apples, strawberries, kiwi, peaches, and apricot preserves) then I add some fresh lime juice which adds the perfect zing!

This recipe was a huge hit at the "Mexican" theme birthday party I took it to.  
Both kids and adults loved it!  My 11 year old daughter enjoyed helping me make
it almost as much as she enjoyed eating it!

No doubt about it, one of the best recipes on this site!  I have made this countless times, using different combinations of fruit and jellies and have never had a bad batch.  The only thing I have changed over time is using 1/2 the amount of sugar and jelly.  The natural sweetness of the fruit and the liquids most fruit produce provide everything needed.  I have not heard a single complaint about this recipe.   Couple of side notes:   If you are pressed for time, skip the homemade chips, and buy a bag of cinnamon tortilla or pita chips.  If you happen to make a big batch and have leftovers, they make a GREAT crumble!  Thank you for sharing this recipe!

THIS IS SOOOOO GOOD – reading a PILE of the 3000+ reviews here are a few things I learned and did – one woman stated stale tortillas worked – she was right! Whole wheat tortillas need a little more time. Baking these 10-12 minutes worked. The fruit salsa – someone spoke of using none of the sugar the preserves used would be enough and YES preserves do the job. Looking at ALL the photos – I got a lot of ideas and used a lot of fruit. One woman used an hard boiled egg slicer to slice fruit with – as soon as I read that I started slicing strawberries for my husband right away – WHAT A TIP – then with the salsa – any fruit soft enough to go through the egg slicer – got the slicer – it made slicing so much quicker. The additional fruits I cut up to use were frozen peaces, mango, frozen blueberries, some black and green grapes, and mint from my garden as part of the visual embellishment. I also cut the apples last and added to the mix so there’d be no browning My son’s girlfriend loves it – everyone loves the chips.

I have made this a couple of times but a key ingredient left out here is a generous squeeze of fresh lemon, especially over the chopped apples.  The lemon also balances out the sugar as well. It's a very easy recipe to try adding other fruit too as well.

Just a SUPER recipe!  Instead of an appetizer, I made a dessert.  Whole tortillas with a design cut into the center making sure not to breach the outside of the tortilla.  Baked for 10 minutes, allowed to cool, then spread with the fruit salsa on top.  Just add whipped cream and you have a delightful ending to your favorite meal.  If you desire, you can add a tortilla on top for an extra special torta!

Great recipe which everyone loves.  I omitted the sugar, used Granny Smith Apples for a little tartness,  also added a Mango and a Peach, and used Apricot Preserves.  Made this recipe numerous times, always mixing up the fruit - there is never any leftovers.

I made this the other day for a house warming party and it was absolutely FABULOUS!!!! Beautiful presentation/looks like it was much more work than it was.
I used all the fruits called for in the recipe but substituted orange marmalade for the raspberry preserves. This gave the salsa a great hint of citrus plus just one more great bit of color with the orange.
I too cut out the white sugar. It doesn't need it!!  I added fuji apples at the end instead of the golden delicious.
One suggestion I have when making the chips. Buy thin flour tortillas, not the thicker ones. After reading the reviews, here is how I made my chips. As suggested here, I put my tortilla shells on a plate in the sink, sprayed butter flavored pam on both sides, then sprinkled both sides with cinnamon sugar from a shaker. Then I cut the shells with a pizza cutter and baked for NO MORE than 9 minutes. They do get more crisp as they cool.
Great recipe and I'll be making it again and again!!!

I really don’t understand why the recipe calls for sugar..I guess if the fruits aren’t in season you might need to sweet them up otherwise..you definitely don’t need the sugar. Time consuming: yes! Lot of cutting..maybe next time I’ll buy the chopper…I used, 2 golden apples, 2 kiwis, half cup of fresh pineapple, half cup of mango and only half pound of strawberries and it was enough! About the chips! Great hit! Bought 12” tortilla and cut them in 12 triangles. No doubt the idea of the muffin pan is the best! Make the chips scoopable :o) loved them!. Don’t get me wrong: everyone loved it and without the sugar and cirup the recipe is quite healthy but as some comments said: it’s a lot of time consuming for a fruit salad. Oh! I used “I cannot believe is not butter spay” on the first batch of chips and then I run out of it. So I used regular melted butter. I liked better the first batch! And on top of that NO CALORIES ON THE BUTTER!!! 
This is a keeper (as long as you have a chopper!)

My boyfriend needed a quick and easy appetizer for a large dinner and he chose this.  He WOWED the crowd!  Everyone raved.  It was delicious, but a little more labour intensive making the crisps than indicated.  We also substituted some fruit...no matter.  It was terrific!

This is one my favorite all time recipes! I have been making this for years. It is always a crowd pleaser. To make it easier, I use frozen strawberries and raspberries. I chop each fruit in the food processor. And then I stir in a can of drained crushed pineapple. The chips are the most time consuming but SO worth the effort. They are the perfect "thinness". Buying store bought cinnamon chips are too thick. Overall this dish is AMAZING. I always hold on to some in a separate dish before I serve it so that I have some left for myself!

This salsa was extremely easy to make. I was in a rush, so I omitted the brown sugar,
only used one apple and substituted blueberries for the raspberries.....it was a huge 
hit of my gathering. Several people requested the recipe. My sister made the
recipe to the letter and like the use of blueberries over raspberries due to leakage
and runniess of the raspberries. Make this recipe and be pleasantly surprised!!!

I was very impressed by all of the positive reviews that I had to give this recipe a try & I am glad I did! I used a smaller rump roast which I seared/browned first, maybe a 3-4 lb roast. I added 1 package of beefy onion soup mix, 2 tbsp of worcestershire sauce, 2 cloves of fresh minced garlic, salt & pepper to taste, diced celery, carrots and potateos. Cooked on low all day for 10 hours. My entire family loved it, even the picky ones! This recipe is a keeper, thank you for sharing it!!!

This recipe was very delicious. I suggest you make the recipe as written before making any modifications. All the fruits balance each other out. Adding different fruits can alter the taste, making it too sweet or too sour.

This was delish!! I omitted the sugar and brown sugar, used the fruits listed in the recipe, and apricot preserves.  I sprayed several tortillas with butter spray, sprinkled with cinnamon sugar, cut them into wedges then baked at 350 for 9 minutes and they were perfect.  All the guests went back for seconds!

Love this recipe! I wound up, somewhat accidentally, making a very different version than the one listed. I didn't add any of the sugar to the salsa. I also didn't add the preserves. I wish I could say that was a planned decision, but truthfully I just couldn't get the lid off the preserve jar. LOL. But it still ended up tasting delicious, the fruit is sweet enough on it's own. I also used pita bread instead of the tortillas. I just split 8 6" round pita pockets in two (leaving 16 6" round flat pitas), placed them on nonstick foil on a cookie sheet. Butter-sprayed the front and back of each one, stacked 2 or 3 together and sliced them with a pizza cutter. I made only 1/2 of the cinnamon-sugar mixture, put it in a salt shaker and sprinkled on both sides the chips. Then cooked for 10 minutes. Everything tasted great, texture of salsa and chips are perfect, and by not using sugar or preserves in the salsa, replacing the tortillas with pita and only using half the cinn-sugar mixture, it wound up a very healthy, low calorie treat. With 64 chips made, they were only 30 calories per chip, and less than 400 calories for the entire huge bowl of salsa.

Fantastic recipe.  I don't add any sugar to the salsa, and I tend to add a more tart preserve, and it disappears.  It really is addictive!!

YUM!  And super addictive.  I used the recipe as a guideline but took the advice of others to cut the sugar down.  I used 1/4 cup of sugar TOTAL as the preserve has plenty of it.  A tip for the chips:  Be sure to coat the tortillas entirely with the cinnamon sugar for an even yummier chip.  I found it time consuming to bake the tortillas (laying the triangles in a single layer to bake) but worth the wait in the end.

I did not use the sugar or preserves and it was still amazing.  I sprayed my cutting board with butter and put one tortilla on it then sprayed the top of that one and stacked another, each time spraying only the top as the bottom would butter itself from the top of the tortilla underneath.  I then cut fajita size tortillas into 4 wedges and dredged them in a mixture of 1 tablespoon to 1 cup of sugar.  It's important not to get too much butter or the tortillas will have too much sugar and will burn easily.

Exceptional! Use the smaller tortillas though for a more chip-like look....cut them all and then put in rows on baking sheet, spray with Pam and then sprinkle with the cinnamon & sugar mixture.

This was a real hit with the kids.  The fruit salsa was great, but too sweet.  I think next time I'll leave out half the sugar, and perhaps omit completely the preserves.  Remember, the chips are covered with sugar also, so don't worry about having too little sweetness!  Enjoy!

Served at a party and got rave reviews!  Used fresh mangoes instead of strawberries because they were out of season.  Very versatile recipe.  I microwaved the preserves until the gel-like quality was gone so that it could be more easily incorporated into the salsa.

Made this as a healthy snack for parent helper day at Nursery School - everyone LOVED it! I purchased the tortillas to make the cinnamon chips but also bought the Stacy's Pita Crisps just in case - thought the storebought chips were a little too thick.  Tasty, but not the best choice for preschoolers.  EXCELLENT RECIPE!!

This recipe is a HIT at parties! I buy store-bought cinnamon pita chips to save time... I also like to pulse all the ingredients in a food processor a few times before serving, because I like it to be just a little more smooth. Thanks for a great, UNIQUE recipe!

I took this to our work potluck yesterday and got rave reviews from everyone.  I did make a few slight changes based on what the other reviewers said.  I substituted mango for apples and left out the sugars.  I chopped everything rather than dicing as I wanted a more salsa like texture.  For the preserves I used Mango/Peach pepper jelly.  It was a nice surprise to folks who tasted it and said "hmmm...what is that little zing at the end?"  To save time with the chips I lightly brushed both sides of the tortillas with olive oil and shook the wedges in a bag rather than sprinkling the cinnamon sugar.  All in all these were a hit and will definitely make them again!  Thanks for the great recipe!

I used canned peaches instead of raspberries, and no sugar.  I used raspberry preserves though and it was plenty sweet!  also got Cinnamon Sugar Pita Chips since I didn't have time to make them.  most were surprised when I told them what it was- loved it!

5 stars just for the chips. The fruit salsa is good too, but you can eat the chips alone. As for making the chips, I wouldn't suggest coating both sides as other reviewers have said. I did this the first time and about half of them practically fused onto the pan.

I have made this twice, once for a Memorial Day picnic and then for my daughter's first birthday party picnic.  Both times I got many compliments and many people asking for my recipe.  I made it once as the recipe states but without the preserves and then once replacing the raspberries with blueberries also without the preserves.  Outstanding!  Is  becoming a staple for all of our family gatherings.

I made this for the first time last night for our housewarming party.  Everybody LOVED it and asked for the recipe!  I made it the night before and it was absolutely fantastic.  I used strawberry-rhubarb jam for the preserves, and followed the recipe to the tee.  It was perfect and everyone loved the cinnamon chips as well.  They couldn't believe that I made them out of flour tortillas!  I will be making this for years to come.  It's delicious as is and I wouldn't change a thing!

Our Marsh groceries store has pre-packaged cinnamon/sugar tortilla chips near the deli section that work great with this recipe and speed up the time! You might look for them so you don't have to make your own -- especially if you're transporting it somewhere.

Wonderful! I made this recently for a huge party and it was a hit!!  I used Fuji apples, blueberries, raspberries, strawberries, and kiwis...delicious.  It did take some time chopping it all (didn't want to shred it in the food processor) but it was worth it.  Everyone loved it!  Also, made the cinnamon tortilla chips- good but time consuming as well.  Might try store bought kind next time to save time.  The fruit makes a gorgeous salad!!  Thanks for sharing!!!  Will definitely make again!!

I used Kiwi, an apple, and a bag of frozen mixed fruit.  Turned out really well.  To save time I just bought a bag of Pita chips.  I also used the sugar and preserves.  I think the preserves really helped.  It lasted for several days and was a great snack to pull out.

For the effort, I thought this was just an "okay" recipe.  I used frozen strawberries instead of fresh (cheaper!) and strawberry preserves (my family are strawberry junkies!!).  My kids thought this was pretty good though.

Fresh, sweet, and delicious! If you don't want to take the time to make the cinnamon chips, try store-bought cinnamon pita chips or even cinnamon graham crackers.

As is, this recipe deserves 5 stars.  However, more recently, I've experimented with a spicy version which has also received rave reviews, although probably not for the grandparents. I add 2-3 finely-diced jalapenos, 1T Cayenne pepper and optionally, 1T fresh cilantro. This creates a perfect sweet/spicy combo for me, but I like things fairly spicy. Adjust to your own taste. We even topped slow-cooked pork with this spicy version...a huge hit!

OMG this was a huge hit at Christmas and I have made another time since for a small get together in which everyone loved it! I went the easy route and bought cinnamon sugar pita chips which were delicious. I used an apple, two kiwi, half a pineapple, blackberries, and a tablespoon of apricot jam, omitting all other sugar. It was not needed. Will definately continue to make! A lot of work chopping and fruit can be expensive though. UPDATE: I buy cinnamon sugar chips from store. Jewel has their own brand. Stacys are good too. Meijer has their own brand also. So much easier! I also only use fruit, no need for sugar or preserves. I've added pineapple and blackberries, try using any variety of fruit and it works. Some are just watery than other so be careful to drain the pineapple a bit.

OMGosh!  This is so delicious.  I was looking for a healthy snack for tailgating and came across this recipe.  It was a hit.  I've made it twice and for the most part went right by the recipe.  Since fresh raspberries were not available at our grocer, I substituted the frozen whole raspberries.  I chopped them slightly in the food processor before adding them to the mixture.  It was delicious but did make the salsa a little more watery than if I had used fresh, but nevertheless, it was delicious.  The second time I made this recipe, I substituted frozen peaches for the raspberries and again chopped them in the food processor before adding them to the other fruit.  I also added some fresh blueberries just b/c I love them (and b/c I was going for an orange and blue tailgate theme...WAR EAGLE!).  Delicious again.  Both times, I chopped the apples into about 1/2 inch cubes and then tossed them in a couple of Tablespoons of lime juice to keep them from turning brown.  This will definitely be a keeper for all of our tailgating parties.  And by the way, I failed to mention that the chips are great as well...very flavorful and crispy.

I finally got to make this for a party and most people really liked it. I used 2 peaches instead of the raspberries and left out the white sugar and 1 T of the preserves. I used Trader Joes cinnamon sugar pita chips -- they are quite good and much easier!

Yummy, I made for a womans get together and got a request for the recipe the next day.  Will make again for sure!  I even thought leftovers (if there is any!) would make a great drink you if you blended it up with some ice, and some rum for a daquari!

Very good, Used peach as others said, Chips were a big hit, I had to fix more later in the evening. I have an alligator chopper that really hurried up the process, A bit messy but well worth it. A 10 star keeper.

Delicious! However, I am going to leave the sugar out next time. Sugar brings out the juices of the fruits and makes the salsa a big wet, mushy mess.

I made this for a potluck at work, and everyone RAVED about it and asked for the recipe.  I made only a few changes - added blackberries and frozen peaches, and ommited the brown sugar.  I used apricot preserves, and thought it tasted perfect.  Recipes like these are made to be played with - so experiment with whatever flavors you like best.  So wonderful!

A perfect treat! I followed the recipe (which is normally hard for me) and it was a HUGE hit at my bridal shower. It is 5 days later and they are still calling for the recipe :) I used apricot preserves like another review suggested and it was the perfect flavor to blend it all together! This is my new potluck dish!

I LOVED IT. The chips were awesome. The salsa was refreshing. I used rasberry preserves that I heated up a bit in the microwave so that it would be easier to mix it. I didn't add any of the additional sugar and it was sweet enough. I changed the servings to 15 and ended up stilll only using 2 apples. I also added a mango into the mix for color. TIP: mix the preserves in with the kiwis and apples and then gently fold in the raspberries so you don't smash them.

As great as everyone else said!! I have to admit, at first I didn't know why this would taste so good, but it really is AMAZING! Thanks to all the reviewers comments. I used a frozen Wal-mart mix of strawberries, blueberries, raspberries, and backberries, 3 fresh kiwi, 1 apple-dipped slices in lemon juice to prevent browing. I diced all except blueberries and raspberries small to scoop easily with the chips. NO sugar used or needed. 1 1/2TBS of strawberry preserves. Sat out for 2hrs before serving and it was perfect for the juices to form. Tortillas-4 to 1 ratio sugar to cinnamon. Butter spray to both sides and put in ziplock bag to shake then sliced w/pizza cutter and sprayed tops again and put in oven for 10 min @ 350. Came out perfect and crisp. Great by themselves as well. Made for a baby shower w/18 guests. Enough for all and so many raves. Everyone was impressed and couldn't believe I made the chips. Recipe very forgiving and only took me 40min to complete. Must try and I will be making this all the time! Cost me only $10.00. What a great fruit recipe without paying the high Fruit price

I don't know why I didn't make this sooner. LOVED it! I used black raspberry spredable fruit and 1 tbsp. bwn sugar, since the spreadable fruit isn't as sweet as preserves etc. It was to die for! I used fuji apples and diced fresh peeled peaches in addition to what the recipe calls for. I served with Stacy's Cinnamon Sugar Pita Chips. ♥

I do this fairly often and have it down to a science as well.  I deep fry four packages of small tortillas cut into eights and then shake them in a paper bag with a container of cheap cinnamon and a cup or so of sugar.  They stay crisp, wonderful and delicious and this way you have tons, but they still generally disappear before the salsa.  It seems to me to be faster than the oven baking as well.It is more fattening to be sure, but the taste is superior.  I also use two lbs of strawberries, two kiwis, two green apples and a pint of raspberries.  I mix this the night before with 2 T. brown sugar and 2 T. apricot preserves.  About an hour before, I add a pkg of frozen blueberries.  This seems to be the most cost-effective method for me, and it tastes fantastic!

I doubled the recipe and brought this to our bi-weekly bible study group and its a good thing I did.......there ended up being close to 40 people there!  The fruit salsa looks fantastic....so many different colors. I used all the fruits called for, and added some mango.  Also used apricot preserves. I didn't double the sugar amounts......don't think that would have been necessary.  Both the salsa and the chips were a big hit.  The salsa was completely devoured and I  made two huge bags of chips and there was half a bag left by the end.  My only reservations was how time consuming this recipe was, between the chopping of the fruit and the preparation of the chips.  Also, I don't understand how it becomes "fruit salsa" when its basically chopped up fruit.  People seemed to really enjoy it though and I had two people ask where they could get the recipe, so I must say it was a success!  Also, a sidenote to some other reviewers:  don't use Pam for coating the chips.  That tends to be more of an olive oil base.  Get "I Can't Believe its not Butter" Spray or another brand for cooking and basting.  It can be found in the dairy section of your supermarket.  It worked great.

I used nectarines, kiwi, and strawberries. With all citrus fruit, I wouldn't have to worry about browning. I only used my favorite raspberry preserves. Not very sweet, but that may depend on your fruit. I think I would prefer a much richer base, like adding raspberry pie filling, but this way it makes it a light dessert. Now with the chips: If the chips aren't good, nothing is good! Ladies, this is when you want to use your convection function on your oven if you have one! I convection baked at 350 for 7 min, turned, and 4 min. max! You don't want to over-bake as well as under-bake. I noticed if the chip is crispy around the edges, but slightly soft in the center, it WILL harden up later. The sugars harden and it turns out nicely. I sprayed both sides of a whole bag of small 12 tortillas, and stacked them and cut them with a  pizza cutter. Then threw them all in a bag filled with 1C sugar and 1T cinnamon. It coated evenly and everyone was happy with it.

This was delicious! I made it exactly as the recipe was written and was a big hit at my party this weekend. The chips took about 40 minutes to make as 2 tortilla's worth of chips only fit on cookie sheet at a time. Great alternative to a boring fruit tray!

This recipe is sensational!!  I was a bit confused by some of the reviewers pictures, as fruit salsa I have had in the past was very finely diced and had a decent amount of liquid.  Some of the photos looked more like fruit salad to me.

That being said, I chose to FINELY dice my fruit and add an extra tablespoon of brown sugar to increase the juice.  It sat in my fridge all day for an evening party and was exactly the consistency I had hoped for..not to mention DELICIOUS!!

Do not forgo making the cinnamon/sugar tortilla chips, as they were amazing and I don't think the dip would have been the same without them.  I had to stop myself from snacking on them as they came out of the oven. :) I just don't think store bought chips would do this recipe justice.

In summary, a delicious, light summer recipe that is easy to make, if not a tad time consuming only because of the peeling and chopping...but well worth it!

This salsa and cinnamon chips are awesome.  I use strawberries, peaches, apples, kiwi, and blueberries and peach preserves.  I chop all of the fruit very fine (except the blueberries, I leave them whole).  If you do not have time to make the chips, try the salsa on pound cake with whipped cream or ice cream.  YUM!

Potluck tested.  There was less than 1/2 left over.  Went soggy and very unappealing by the end of the meal.  Kiwi I found didn't hold up well.  You pretty much have to have very firm fruit, but then you risk lacking sweetness of the fruit as do the strawberries.  I say, why fight it.  If you want a salsa, then make it look like one, not a gone-limp fruit salad.  Try making a thin sauce using cornstarch out of a  bit of pureed fruit and then add that to the fruit and chill.   I would cut down or leave sugar out all together and let the fruit preserves make the syrup.

I won most creative salsa at a salsa competition on Cinco de Mayo at work using this recipe. Instead of making the cinnamon chips, I just bought Cinnamon Pita chips at the grocery store to save time.

Excellent!  I halved the recipe and it only lasted a day in our house!  I didn't add any sugar either, and used a Fuji apple (added last) instead of a Golden Delicious apple, and apricot preserves.  Yum!

This is a family favorite.  The first time we served it to my niece and nephews, my youngest nephew (8 at the time) just ate bowls of it.  We ate it on ice cream too.  I used a lot of the suggestions from the feedback here and found the tips on working with the tortillas the most helpful -- I definitely cut them up before shaking them and also bake them in muffin tins to get a good scoop shape.  I think someone suggested turning the muffin tin over and that worked really well.  Read the reviews -- they are really helpful.

This is wonderful!  It went over great with my guests.  Just make sure to adjust the sugar based on the tartness of your berries and kiwi, if they're a bit more tart this amount of sugar is perfect, if they're sweeter than usual you might need to cut back.

This was really good! I coarsely chopped the salsa ingredients using my blender's chopper attachment, and the texture was just right. I used frozen raspberries rather than expensive fresh berries and was happy with the results. Also, I'll cut back on the sugar next time. I don't think we'll miss it. The Archer Farm's Cinnamon Sugar Tortilla Chips from Target are easier than making them homemade and are really good!

I made this for my Wife's bunco party last night and it was a big hit.  I didn't have butter spray, so I melted real butter and brushed it on the tortillas.  Next time I would definitely use spray to speed the process along.  After buttering, I placed 2 cups of sugar and 1/4 cup of cinnamon in a rubbermaid container, added the buttered tortilla, snapped closed and shook it up.  Worked like a charm.  I cut them with a pizza cutter and then baked on an ungreased pan for 8 minutes (350 degrees).  Cool them on a wire rack.  I would also highly recommend making the salsa ahead of time, as it gets better with time.  Fantastic recipe!

This is so good! I use melted butter/margarin to coat the flour tortillas,cover with cinnamon & sugar then cut into triangles with a pizza cutter. These chips are also WONDERFUL served with vanilla bean ice cream and topped with the fruit salsa and/or drizzled with fudge sauce,honey,maple syrup,apple pie filling (you choose)...Don't forget the whipped cream! Good recipe. :)

My friends loved it~ to avoid having too sour of a salsa...i marinated each fruit separately in sugar a couple of hours before serving and then just omitted the sugar in the end...the fruits still retain their tartness so dont worry about making it too sweet....this allows you to drain all the liquid from the fruits that will otherwise lead to a very mushy salsa...don't mix the fruits until right before serving or else the colors blend together and you end up having gray colored juice from the strawberries and kiwi.

This is quite a unique dessert.  I made it for a work party and everyone loved it.  I used two packages of tortillas.  One package did not make enough chips for the salsa.  It did take longer preparing than the recipe says but its worth it.

You can substitute or increase certain types of fruit to suit your taste preferences, what is in season, your budget - we've made it with just about every fruit you can imagine. My family likes this when it in't as sweet, so we also cut down on the sugar. Other reviewers have mentioned this - but anytime you add sugar to fruit it will draw out the moisture and make the fruit (especially strawberries) soft. So, if you make it and it seems too firm for your liking, give it an hour in the fridge and the consistency will be different.

I have to tell you that I'm not much of a cook but I took this to an office potluck and people freaked out! They asked me how to make it, they wanted the recipe, they wanted to know where I 'bought' the chips and were floored when I said I made them. I'm so thrilled with this recipe. What a simple tasty dish with an original flair. I guarantee no one else will have this at your next get-together. I followed the recipe closely but omitted the sugars in the salsa as I thought there would be plenty of sweetness with the cinnamon chips. I forgot to buy butter spray so I brushed on melted butter to each chip before sprinkling the cinnamon and sugar on top. I used a pizza cutter on the tortillas thanks to another reviewers suggestion and that worked perfectly. Based on other suggestions I made sure to take the time to cut everything very small and used strawberry preserves. My only mild complaint was that this took me forever to make. Who knew such a simple recipe would take so long. At first I was like, Oh this is soooo much fun...an hour into it, not so much. lol. Oh and btw, I had a few tortillas left to bake and no more melted butter, so I just sprinkled them with water so that the cinnamon and sugar would adhere and they turned out fantastic. Lastly, I baked a flour tortilla in a oven proof bowl so that I could serve the fruit salsa in it. That was another spectacular suggestion. Thank you for the recipe and thank you all for the wonderful suggestions. Love this site!

Great and easy. My husband thought the salsa was a bit much because you couldn't taste the cinnamon and sugar of the chips but over all...great use for left over tortillas.

This was phenomenal!!  I got a ton of compliments on it.  I took the advice of so many other commenters and did not add any sugar at all.  I'm glad I didn't!  It would have been way too sweet otherwise.  I also forgot to get raspberries so my mix ended up being 1 lb. strawberries, 2 kiwis, 1 fuji apple, 1 peach and a couple spoonfuls of orange marmalade.  I think about 10-12 fajitas was more than enough though.  All the salsa was gone before the chips were.

This is an easy recipe to make that allows you to be very flexible on the fruits used in the salsa. The cinnamon chips are great! To make them, I stack a few tortillas and cut them with a pizza cutter. Then I spray them with cooking spray and place them in a large bag filled with the cinnamon/sugar mix. Shake the bag to coat the chips, then place them on a cookie sheet for baking. Adults and kids love these!

Wow! Very good! The fruit salsa was so easy to whip up and was incredibly delicious. The cinnamon tortillas were great! The only problem I had with them was the oven temperature and the baking time. After two pans of burnt tortilla chips I finally got the right settings for baking these babies the right way. My oven is true to temp .. it does not run hot - I found the 350 degree temp called for was way too hot. Baking these chips at 325 degrees was perfect. Also the baking time - even at 325 degrees, 8 minutes was sufficient to crisp the chips up. Now that I have the kinks worked out, the recipe is great!

Made this for a mom's group meeting - was looking for something other than the usual chips/dip or brownies that I usually bring! It was tasty and got lots of rave reviews. My store didn't have raspberries so I ended up using more strawberries. Didn't add either sugars either based on the reviews I read before making it. Took a LOT longer than 15 minutes to prep!! The cinnamon tortilla chips were easier to make than I thought they would be! All in all, I am putting this in my recipe box for future use!

I've made this recipe numerous times since finding it here a few years ago.  I leave out the sugar because it is already sweet enough.  If I don't have much money to spend on fresh fruit, I buy a bag of frozen mixed berries and it works great!

MMMmmazing!  This was so fun and different.  I would never think to make my own chips but I have to say...it was fun and I felt really Martha Steward by making my own chips.  I made this for a baby shower and it was a hit!

LOVED this!  After reading all of the other reviews and tips, I followed another's reviewers advice on the chips:  I sprayed both sides with the cooking spray, dipped both sides in cinnamon sugar (I made extra cinn sugar than called for), baked at 350 for 10-11 minutes.  They weren't crispy right out of the oven, but they crisped right up in minutes.  The only thing I did differently with the 'salsa' is to squeeze fresh lemon juice over the apples so they wouldn't brown, and it taste wonderful!  It was best after sitting in the fridge overnight.  I think I might cut back on the sugar the next time I make it, but other than that, fantastic!   Thank you for the fabulous recipe!

What a great treat!  I added some blueberries to pump up the antioxidant factor and used organic cane sugar for sweetener.  I will cut back the sugar a bit next time as the fruit already has natural sweetness.  My husband wanted to know how bad this was for him and it was great to tell him that it really wasn't bad for him at all!  Thanks for the recipe - it is a keeper and will also go great with granola or other cereals for breakfast!

this is out of control delicious. I usually don't have time to make the chips, so I make the salsa, cut the fruit a little bigger, cut out some of the sugar, and serve it to my boys as a fruit salad. HUGE hit around here. I use 2 tbsp. dark brown sugar and add about 2 tbsp. lemon juice, with raspberry preserves.

I have been making this for a couple of years and everytime I get huge compliments!  I did what other reviewers suggested and used Figi apples, instead of raspberries, I used frozen peaches and added orange marmalade as the frut preserves.  I do not add any of the sugar (it really doesn't need it!)

YES, YES, YES!!!  Unbelievable, especially the chips! I followed the salsa recipe using Apricot preserves.  I agree with other posters that it is a bit sweet but we liked it that way!  I bought Cinnamon Sugar pita chips and also made the chip recipe here so we could compare.  The homemade chips were significantly better and completely worth the time! I made some with the butter flavored spray but we thought it made the kitchen smell weird so i switched to brushing the tortilla with butter instead.  LOVED IT!!!!

The salsa's flavours really come alive when you add some chopped fresh mint (to mimick parsley or cilantro in a real salsa) and also serve with a small bowl of vanilla yogurt on the side (to mimick sour cream)

After reading lots of the reviews, I used half the amount of sugar and preserves and I was very pleased.  I took this to a party and both men  and women loved it.  I bought the Traders Joes Cinnamon Pita Chips as a time saver and I highly recommend this option. I also think this would be a delicious summer dessert over vanilla ice cream.

This is the best appetizer I've every made. The whole family loved it. I am going to make this for our Christmas dinner, I am sure that it will be a big hit at the dinner. Followed the recipe to the last word, have one little suggestion. Instead of serving the fruit chopped up, I pureed it. 5 stars, best I've had. Looking forward to share with the family.

This was delicious, the only thing I did differently was I bought cinnamon sugar pita chips instead of making them, much easier!

This was good.  But I didn't get the rave reviews everyone else got.  I used triple berry preserves (blackberry, strawberry, rasberry).  I also added fresh blueberries.

This recipe was amazing! I made if for my son's birthday party. I added a little lime juice to the salsa and only 1 Tbsp sugar/1 Tbsp fruit preserve.  The salsa had a tart taste to it that was great with the sweetness of the chips.  It was a huge hit a the party.  I will definitely make it again!

I made this for my DD's 5th birthday party, and let me tell you, it was a HIT with the kids (and parents, too)! I couldn't find any kiwis (yay for living in tiny towns) so I subbed a ripe peach, and it tasted great. No left-overs! Thank you for the recipe.

I really loved this recipe!! I brought it to my friend's bonfire party and everyone really enjoyed it too and were asking for the recipe. I made a few adjustments though. I replaced the raspberries with canned peaches because they're a lot cheaper! I also didn't add any sugar, between the strawberry fruit preserve and the small amount of juice left on the peaches it was definitely sweet enough. I recommend adding a little lemon juice as well to keep the apples from browing.

I really liked this, but like others, I altered it. BUT I'm rating the recipe on the batch I didn't alter. It was soooo sweet!It was a bit too much, but good! The chips were good, and I really liked the pairing. The dish was addicting, even if it was too sweet. The batches I made were with Orange Marmalade, which was good, and apricot preserves. I think I liked the apricot better. I realized I enjoyed the pairing of fruit, and the texture of the small chopped up pieces. So after the first to with the preserves, I just did fruit. Didn't add anything to it. It was soooo much better. So if you don't have a huge sweet tooth, and don't want all the sweetness, just don't add the preserves. Thank you for the recipe!!! I've made it many times, many different ways!

I would have never made this if it weren't for the reviews here - I just had to see what all the fuss was about. It was definitely worth it. I used raspberries, peach, kiwi, blueberries, apple, and blackberry preserve, and it turned out wonderful! What a perfect summer snack - Thanks!

This recipe was a great hit at a recent party. I had many requests for the recipe. I used Fuji apples.I made the salsa in the morning, but did not put the apples in until an hour before serving time. I omitted the sugar. Since I only had a 6 oz. package of raspberries, I added some blueberries which I cut into quarters. I used apricot preserves. I did not find the fruit salsa that time consuming. I know several people mentioned using a food chopper, and although I have one, I was afraid it would make the fruit too mushy. I just chopped with my good knife and it was very fast. 

Now the chips did take time, but I had many good reviews on those also. I made them two days ahead of time and after they cooled completely I put them in a large ziploc bag. I tried buttering and sugaring some on one side and some on two sides. I made some flat and some in the muffin tins. In the end, I preferred the flat ones best that were only buttered and sugared on one side. I suggest that anyone who makes this recipe do the same, and see what you like best. For the chips, I did make my own cinnamon sugar. I used one cup of white sugar and 2 tsp.of cinnamon. For me, it was just right. If you like a very strong cinnamon flavor make sure you add more cinnamon. I did not sprinkle the chips. I dipped each chip into the sugar mixture which I had in a small bowl. I thought it worked well. The pizza cutter idea was great. It made slicing the chips very simple. Enjoy this wonderful recipe!!!

This is a great thing to take to potlucks.  Everyone always loves it!  And its fairly healthy.  Some tips- use a pizza cutter to cut the tortillas or you will spend double the time.  You can use whatever fruit you want, but here's what I do and it has always gotten rave reviews- I use strawberries that are frozen cut up in the sugar and then I do not add sugar or jam- you don't need it when you use these strawberries, raspberries, blackberries and apples.  I use way more than two apples because it really works best when there are more apples than anything else (as far as consistency and flavor) And, I use a veggie chopper- or you'll be cutting forever.

What a perfectly clever and scrumptious combination. This is one of the only recipes from this site that needed absolutely NO adjustments. It's perfect as is. Though, don't let that deter you from experimenting with many different kinds of fruit. The possibilities are endless. This is one of those recipes that people will go on and on about...and it's sooo simple!

Hints for the chips - use a big ziploc bag and put 1c sugar to 1 tbls cinnamon and DOUBLE the amount of chips!
Hints for the salsa - I used sugar free apricot preserves and added blueberries for the color.  You can make it a day ahead of time, but it takes a long time!  (with all the chopping and making of the chips) 
Turned out great!  It was a huge hit at my mexican potluck!!

My hubby tasted and said "Killer". I don't think fruit choice matters. I used more Kiwi, red apple and granny smith, cantelope,straw berry & maderine orange. I cut out the white sugar and used berry jam. The chips went fast so make extra. I did them like another reviewer. I sprayed both sides while they were whole tortillas. Stacked them on top of each other, sliced wedges with a pizza cutter and tossed them all at once in a zip lock with cin. sugar. Went fast & easy. I also kept the fruit in bigger chunks so it wouldn't get mushy. This is a nice change from the usual fruit bowl.

This was just amazing! I recommend coating both sides of the chips with the butter spray, cinnamon mixture. Or make mini cups by baking in muffin tins and serving the cups full of the salsa!

I used this as a guideline but did revised it a bit.  I used blueberries, an apple, several small oranges, a bananna, greek yougurt, and honey for the sauce. I also ended up using white corn tortillas and frying them in a pan.  With the left over sauce we put it on french toast for breakfast and used the rest for fruit smoothies.  The kids RAVED over all of it!! :)

This was a huge hit at our family get-together. Such an easy & delicious recipe! I couldn't buy raspberries or kiwi this time of year, so I just added blueberries, and extra strawberries.  Don't overbake the tortilla chips. You don't want them to turn brown at all. I will definitely be making this many times in the future!

I really loved this recipe! Easy to make and people were raving about it at the party I carried this dish to.
Recommendations I followed:
-Dice the fruit small so each bite gets a good blend of all the fruit.
-Cut & add the (Fuji) apples last to lessen the issue of the apples turning brown.
-Replace the raspberries with frozen peaches
-Do NOT add sugar to the fruit...it is PLENTY sweet without.
-I used peach preserves and it came out great.
-After spraying and cutting up the tortillas, I dredged them in a cinnamon/sugar mixture (1C sugar with 1 1/4t cinnamon for 2 packs of tortillas) and baked them. No need to spray again.
-Dress with a dollop of Cool Whip for and *extra* special treat.

I rarely rate recipes as I usually have to alter them do to allergies, or whats on hand, and that doesn't seem fair. But this is so wonderful! I used my "slap" chopper to speed things along, frozen raspberries, and a basting brush to lightly paint on melted butter instead of the spray (didn't have any). So great, so light, will definitely make again! Thanks so much!

This is a big hit at parties and if there's leftovers, it's okay. It's healthy. It's one dish I don't mind if there are leftovers. Plenty more for me! I have used raspberry preserves or jam and has been my favorite with this assortment of fruits.

So I couldn't get strawberries so substituted blueberries instead but kept everything else the same.  I also used half of the amount for the cinnamon sugar since I didn't want them too sweet. Other than that, everyone loved the salsa and chips and they were all gone at lunch!! Thanks :)

ADDICTING!Have made it twice in two weeks! The cinnamon chips are a must also, nothing tastes as good with the salsa then the chips! Super easy and you could change it up to your liking. I just used grape jelly for my preserves and it was great! Also I used a food processor to make it more like salsa!

This salsa is amazing!  I served it at an outdoor pool party and it was a bit hit.  I do think it takes more than 2 T of cinnamon sugar to cover 10 flour tortillas though.

Awesome! Changed it a bit based on others reviews... I added no sugar to the fruit... I used strawberries, blueberries, kiwis, and fuji apples. I added the apples last based on what others suggested... I used apricot preserves... and it was amazing!!! The chips are delish as well!!!! Thanks so much!

Loved it. Exactly what I was looking for. I used a nectarine instead of the kiwis, apricot preserves, and left out the white sugar (as others advised). And, I chopped everything into very small bits (maybe 1/4" square). It was delicious.

A hit! Very nice blend of fruit. I used peach preserves which gave it a nice flavor. I would make twice as many tortillas next time.

This was wonderful! I used 1 large Gala apple, 2 kiwi and 1 pint of strawberries .... mixed the preserves (I used strawberry) with  1 tablespoon white sugar and the juice of half an orange. Mixed it with the fruit and made severel batches of the "chips". My daughter and her friends licked the bowl clean! Though it took some time to dice all the fruit, it was so worth it. I made things easier with the chips by buying the taco size, cutting in fourths and spraying/sugaring only one side. Baked for 9 minutes and they were perfect! A hit with adults and teens .... a keeper for my family! Thanks for the awesome (and healthy) recipe!

The salsa portion of the allows for much interpretation...excellent.  The chips were, as many others said, a crowd favorite in and of themselves.  They do take much longer to prepare but I suspect are far superior to any store version.  If you have the time, bake the chips and make extra!

Just made the chips, and out of pita instead of tortilla. Works amazing! Also works with a light coat of margarine on one side in lieu of cooking spray.

This is a good recipe. I only made one tiny change that I think made a world of difference. I added a little fresh mint which really brightened up the salsa. It also dressed up the dish which is good since it's very simple. Next time I would skip the preserves.

This tastes delicious! All I used were apples and strawberries, sprinkled a pinch of brown and white sugar on them, and they were yummy by themselves! And I didn't have a butter-flavored cooking spray, so I used a basic fat-free non-stick spray, with tortillas that only had 100 calories and 1 gram of fat, and it made it low-fat!

FANTASTIC.  I have shared this recipe with countless friends who have loved it and make it all the time themselves.  To cut cost, I sometimes buy blueberries and raspberries that I squish down to add to the mix- don't thing you would want to go frozen on any of the other ingredients though, the crunch of the fresh fruit is part of its overall appeal.  I am not big on sugar, so i usually just sprinkle about a tablespoon of white sugar on, and omit the brown sugar and preserves.  I like the contrast of the tart fresh fruit and slightly sweet cinnamon chips.  Ann, thank you so much!

Great recipe! I ended up using lemon juice instead of fruit preserver wich worked fine.  Just squirted a few tablespoons in before adding sugar.  Also, I cut the tortillas into dipping strips instead of wedges.  Was a big hit!

This is fantastic. I used frozen raspberries and strawberry preserves. 

Be careful with the chips, I burnt the first batch.

This was a huge hit! Add a can of whip cream to top off each chip and you have even more WOW! I cannot make enough for our family, usually doubling the batch is still not enough.

I have made this twice for office pot-luck meals. Both times it was gone in 2 hours. They raved over it! I use a lot more fruit then it calls for (because I was feeding so many people) and changed fruit each time I made it. I think any fruit in season is fine to use. Once I accidentally bought corn tortillas, I won't ever do that again! Make sure to use flour tortillas as the recipe calls for. Also I used the 6 inch tortillas and cut them in quarters. They make the perfect size chip.

I made this as is, and it took way longer than 15 minutes to prep! You have to dice EVERYTHING, even the raspberries to make it even close to a salsa (which it still wasn't). It was way too much work for the outcome. It tasted good but I would have been just as happy eating the fruit alone and saved a whole lot of time.

Wow, this totally lived up to it's reputation, amazingly delicious! I used green grapes instead of the kiwis, and also added blueberries. The key is to chop the fruit into small, similar sized pieces. The raspberries I had were large so I sliced them in  half. I chose apple jelly since that was already open, heated it to liquify and then stirred in about a tsp of the cinnamon sugar blend from the chips. I added none of the other sugars. I made the chips the way the most helpful reviewer suggested and it worked perfectly. I used a mix of regular flour and whole wheat tortillas and that made a very pretty presentation in the basket next to the salsa. Both the kids and adults enjoyed this!

Love this recipe.  I followed it exactly, but to me, it looked like fruit salad.....So I  put it in my chopper and blended it together.  Very refreshing!

I made this for a New Years eve party and everyoone LOVED it. Quite a few people asked for the recipe and said it was the best fruit salsa they ever had. I used appricot preserves, chopped everything small, and added blueberries.  I also double the amount of chips and it seemed to be perfect. The smaller the chips the better, the bigger ones were kind of chewy. Making it again this week end for another party.

This is a great dessert.  Every time I make it, everyone loves it.  I have given the recipe out about a dozen times.  If I can't get the exact fruit it calls for I add other fruits, whatever I can get and it's stll great.    Sometimes I brush the tortilla with butter and then sprinkle the cinnamon and sugar.  It really makes a difference.

Used a red pear in lieu of one apple.  Used a gala apple instead.  I didn't have any preserves, so I used grape jelly instead!  It was a big hit!  Pregnant neighbor couldn't get enough!

Made this for a party over the summer and it was a huge hit! The kids at the party gobbled up the chips in no time - but then people were just using regular tortilla chips they thought it was so good! Didn't change a thing and it was just great.

Great flavor and the chips are outrageous! I didn't add any of the sugar and used grape jelly and still found the salsa to be too wet. I think next time I make it I will just use the cut up fruit and drain off some of the liquid before serving. As others suggested I used a pizza cutter and sprayed the tortillas in the sink.

Perfect every time!  Only thing I would suggest is to coat tortillas on both sides and make sure they are covered!  The chips are the best part!  As far as the salsa goes I cut the sugar in half.  Thanks for such a great recipe!

It was amazing everyone loved it and couldn't lay off... Especially the cinnamon chips. Those were fantastic. My complaint is how horribly messy and long it took to make. It drug on forever. My salsa turned out a bit too runny. And I definitely suggest making wayyy smaller quantities b/c no one wants huge servings of this, it's very sweet. It's more of a light snack.

This was delicious! I made it exactly has the recipe states. Definitely need the apples for a bit of crunch and definitely need the raspberries for the tangy. Otherwise, I could see this being too sweet as others have fussed. I wouldn't change a thing and my friends raved. The chips take some time, but are perfect with this "salsa".

Pure delight! I ended up using cherry preserves but I love that you can experiment with it! Just a really simple yet delicious recipe! Also, making the chips yourself is nice...but it's really easy using the cinnamon pita chips!

I substitued 2 peaches for the raspberries as they were all out at the store I went to.  I used strawberry preserves.  I diced the fruit up very small so it resembled a pico de gallo. Took another reviewer's advise and drove to Trader Joe's and picked up a bag of  the cinamon pita chips.  Need to buy 2 bags. It was a hit. Everyone loved it. It's a keeper!

We LOVED this!!!...both the salsa and the chips!  I almost left out the raspberries due to cost, but they-with the combination of the other fruits as listed in the recipe- really make this special!  I chopped up the fruit fairly well, so that it actually resembled the texture of salsa rather than a fruit salad.  I needed to keep the apples from turning (I used Fuji), so I did very lightly sprinkle fresh lime juice on them before adding to the salsa.  The addition of that hint of tangy lime helped tone down the sweetness and really perked up the flavor of the salsa! (I omitted the white sugar, but did use the brown, and used reduced sugar strawberry preserves.)

This is SO good - makes a ton, so with the leftovers I recommend that you make Dessert Nachos!  In a bowl pile the cinnamon chips, salsa (and pour on the juice it makes), top with vanilla ice cream & whipped cream - you will not regret it!

What a fantastic idea! I took this to a work potluck and it was huge success. The best part was the chips-I cut the tortillas into triangles, sprayed with butter-flavored cooking spray, shook to coat in a gallon-sized storage bag of cinnamon and sugar, and then baked. Wonderful! For the salsa, I used frozen blackberries, diced kiwi, diced apples, diced strawberries, and diced frozen peaches-at the last minute I added diced bananas. This doesn't stay fresh and pretty too long so I made it very early in the morning and it was perfect at lunchtime.

I'm giving this recipe 5 stars even though I've tweaked it to my personal preference after making it several times.  For fruit I use kiwis, Altulfo mangoes, strawberries and blackberries.  This variety gives a great colour presentation.  I don't like it with the apples because of their crunchy texture...the soft fruit goes better with the crunchy chips.  I leave out the sugar and use seedless red raspberry jam for the preserves.  I chop up the fruit in advance, then drain any juice before adding the jam.  Spray both sides of the tortilla then use a pizza cutter to cut them into pieces.  Then I shake one cut-up tortilla at a time in a ziploc bag filled with the cinnamon sugar (2 cups sugar with 3-4 tbsp cinnamon).  To get a nice scoop shape, I put 1-2 tortilla pieces in muffin cups, but if you're short on time, placing them on a tray means you can bake more all at once!  Bake for about 9 minutes then loosen with a spatula or remove immediately from the tray otherwise they stick.   I always make the chips a day in advance as I find they are crunchier and taste better.  My guests have all raved about this recipe!

Holy cow!! This stuff should come with a warning because it's a little like crack. I made this for the first time about 2 months ago for a get together, and have since made it 5 more times, not for a get together mind you, but for my boyfriend and I because we are addicts!! I didn't change anything about the salsa but used orange marmalade for the preserves. The chips are where I made some changes and I think this is the only way to make these babies! I melted butter and coated the tortilla wedges with it, then put them in a big ziplock baggie filled with cinnamon and sugar and shook like crazy, my chips were coated with butter and sugar! Then I baked for like 15 - 17 minutes, because  we like them with a little crunch. Anyway, my boyfriend and I have decided this is probably what they serve in heaven. ;-)P.S. I wouldn't change a thing about the salsa. I would not omit the sugars because we didn't think this was too sweet at all. I also don't know if I would mess with different fruits, why mess with perfection?! And I definitely wouldn't use frozen fruit - yuck!! Also, I did my sugar and preserves first, then the raspberries and strawberries, then the kiwis and apples. I threw the apples in as soon as I chopped and didn't have a problem with browning. I didn't use red delicious apples because I can't stand their grainy, mushy texture. I think I used pink ladys.

This was heavenly.  My guests just loved it.  The best part is that my kids love it as well!  Like others, I didn't feel it was necessary to add sugar.  I simply used Raspberry preserves.  I made sure to dip the apples in lemon juice to avoid browning.  The cinnamon chips were a hit as well.  I did not coat the tortillas with cooking spray (yuck!).  I brushed them lightly with butter and then coatd them with the cinnamon/sugar by putting them in a ziploc bag and shaking them.  I also turned the chips half-way through baking (which actually took 12-15 minutes for me).  If I'm short on time I might use the Stacy's cinnamon chips instead.  This would be good on ice cream or angel food cake as well.

Love this recipe!  I didn't add any sugar OR preserves to the fruit salsa.  It was perfect without it.  I added blueberries and may add some crushed pineapple the next time.  I followed someone's suggestion and put the sprayed tortillas in a bag with cinnamon sugar and shook it up.  You may need to put some more sugar on after you place them on the baking sheet.  Do NOT overlap the chips or they won't bake well.  They do continue to cook after removing them from the oven.  Have fun!

Had so many comments/compliments on this recipe - it is an ultimate favorite, you just can't go wrong!!! I preferred to make mine with raspberry or blackberry preserves....also, careful not to add too much cinnamon/sugar to the chips, it will be sweet overload.

This was absolutely awesome! I used a pizza cutter for the tortillas and put them in muffin tins to get that curl in them - this was such a classy dish on my buffet and my guests loved it. I froze the leftover salsa and put it on pancacks a couple weeks later - yum.

I served this at our monthly "girls night out."  It went over better than anything I have served in the 20-plus years we have been getting together.  I used two bags of the frozen berry mix with the apple & kiwi and it was wonderful.  The only suggetion I would make is that you do need to turn the chips half way through baking and I sprinkled them again with cinnamon & sugar at that time to absorb the oil.  Worked great.  Everyone took the recipe home with them!!!

I work at a Boys & Girls Club and used this recipie with ten kids ages 6-12 and they all loved it!  I let them choose what kind of fruits to use- offering pinapples chunks, canned peaches and pears, rasins as additions to the other listed fruits.  We also let the kids choose the flavor of jam and everyone made a different combination.  We added almonds, walnuts or hazelnuts for a little crunch and then ate it warmed up over vanilla ice cream with waffle cookies.  I will definately pass this recipie on and use it again!! ;)

I love this recipe (along with everyone at the Super Bowl party)! Instead of the various fruits, I thawed a bag of frozen berry mix and a bag of red raspberries. I cut up the fruit and added the sugars and preserves (again red raspberries), then refrigerated. Very berry!! 

But the biggest hit of all were the torilla chips. A little girl at the Super Bowl party ate them by the handful! I used regular (not butter) Pam spray and sprayed both sides of the tortilla, then I cut each into about 12 slices. Then I dredged each slice of tortilla through the cinnamon sugar mixture (1 cup sugar and 1 t. cinnamon) and baked for about 6 minutes each in a muffin tin. That was a suggestion to create a "scooped" tortilla chip. 

Thanks for the great recipe, Ann!!

I made mine gluten free and mostly sugar free. I used gluten free tortillas, sugar-free marmalade and whatever fruits I felt like using. I added one packet of Stevia. These were delicious and I make them almost every weekend now for football games!

This is a very good recipe which I made for a family picnic. It was definitely a hit, especially with so many summer sweet fruits available. I modified this recipe: I used mango, pineapple, strawberries & apple. Because the fruit was so ripe, I didn't need the added sugar. Also, I used pepper jelly instead of fruit jelly.  I used Stacy‘s cinnamon sugar pita chips for dippers.

Have made this recipe many times and each time it was a great hit, no left over.   I think I have it to perfection.  I usually cut up the fruits (apples, kiwis, peach, plum, raspberry strawberries, pineapple - crushed) the night before, combine all except strawberries. Also make cinnamon chips night before.  Lightly spray both sides tortillas with cooking spray then sprinkle with cinnamon sugar using shaker (so quick & easy), layer tortillas on top of each other, cut in half, cut each half in half then in half.  Mix sugar and preserves (great with a variety of two or three preserves/marmalade) then only mix into fruits just before serving.  Wont stay long enough for it to get runny. Excellent appetizer for Valentine's dinner/Mother's Day or any occasion.  You will not be disappointed!

Wow can I give this 6 stars!!! Awesome recipe! I made three  small changes. I used two tablespoons of honey in place of all the sugar, 5 grain tortillas and chopped the fruit a lot smaller that the fruit in the picture. I split the recipe into two and took it to two cookouts. For the first cookout I served it in a tortilla bowl that I made while I was chopping the fruit. I sprayed the tortilla with the cooking spray and pushed into the bottom of a bowl so it ruffled and backed at 350 for 15 mins. Filled it with the fruit right befor I left the house. The second house I served it in a bowl I made from the bottom half of a pineapple covered it with the top of the pineapple. Both were a beautiful presentation! Had to tell everyone how I made the Salsa and Chips so many times I should have had it typed out and ready when people asked. Everyone loved the chips by them self, could never make to many. Loved the salsa too but when you put them together it was pure BLISS!!! Everyone talked about how you could eat this as an appetizer, dessert or even for breakfest. I will be making this alot!!!

Wow, these are good.  Added a little bit of fresh pineapple which I had in the fridge, but changed nothing else...and won't the next time I make this.  Easy and delish!   ****UPDATE 2.1.17****  One of my favorites recipes (breakfast, snack, anytime!) on this site, but decided to take a Valentine's Day approach this morning by cutting my flour tortillas into a heart shape, still sprinkling the cinnamon-sugar mixture, on the chips  but also added some red sugar  sprinkles for a little pop of color.  ***UPDATE 7.10.17*** These cinnamon chips served with fruit salsa over vanilla Greek yogurt have become a breakfast mainstay in our house.  We have this weekly and sometimes more frequently than that.  I use whatever fruits are in season and if I’m particularly lazy (happens often), I just skip the sweet glaze for the fruit.

AMAZING! I added a mango and blueberries. I did not even need the white or brown sugar - just the fruit preserves. Actually I want to try this again with a citrus preserve as opposed to the strawberry I had on hand. And for a larger crowd, use the smaller "Taco" flour tortillas - smaller bites feeds more people and helps with serving size. SOO GOOD!!!  also, make it with a friend so the slice and dice takes 20 mins TOPS!

I omitted the sugar, brown sugar and jam; instead I used 3 T. jellied cranberry sauce. Everyone loved it, the cranberry gave it a little tart kick and the fruit made it sweet enough! I took the easy way out and used Stacy's Cinnamon Sugar Pita Chips instead of making them.

Delicious and a nice change.  I opted for a small splash of juice from a jar of maraschino cherries instead of the two sugars, along with a generous squeeze of lemon juice.  The result was a nice balance of sweetness and brightness.  Had a bag of Stacy's Cinnamon Sugar Pita Chips on hand, so served those.  Fresh, colorful, healthy and so tasty!  Can't wait to try various combinations of fruits and preserves.  Thank you for the delightful inspiration!

I've been making this recipe for years and I never adjust a thing. It is one of the requests my kids make when we have a party. It's great to have a standby recipe that is so fresh and healthy to serve and really Delicious! Also, the leftover fruit salsa is great in a smoothy!

Super yummy!  I added peaches, plums, & grapes - used apple preserves from local pumpkin patch, omitted the extra sugar too - turned out perfect and pretty!

Tastes great. Just a ton of cutting and it's time consuming. I used the left over Fruit salsa as a topping for my pancakes!

This recipe does not need another review but what the heck. I added a can of chopped lychee, some asian pear and used jalapeno jelly. I bought Stacy's brand sugar-cinnamon pita chips. Worked beautifully.

This stuff is great! I used orange marmalade and cut back on the sugar because my fruit was already sweet. I didn't really like the chips in this recipe, so I used Stacy's cinnamon pita chips. YUM!!!

This was DELICIOUS! It was very helpful to read all of the other helpful comments and tips before getting started. The only problem I ran into was people accidentally taking the cinnamon chips and using it for the homemade guacamole.... oops! Other than that, guests loved the healthy and sweet addition to the chips and dip!

I made this for a party and everyone enjoyed it. I did make a few alterations though. I used kiwi, nectarine and granny smith apples. I also used frozen strawberries instead of fresh. I blended some a little and it gave it a nice "salsa" consistency. I also substituted all of the preserves and sugar with honey and some lemon juice. I used whole wheat tortillas and melted butter for the chips. Definitely on my list of things to make again!

I really cannot find anything wrong with this recipe - I followed it exactly, and it was phenomenal!  Mine was a little tangy, b/c I used strawberry rhubarb fruit preserves, which I liked.  Definitely recommend this one as a healthier alternative to party foods, that is what I used it for!  Will definitely make this one again!

To die for!  Did not use any sugar and used triple berry perserves.  Was a definite hit at the party.  I also had to cook the tortillas a little longer to get them criispy.  I'm making again tomorrow for another get together.

This was really good. The cinnamon chips alone are a treat. I doubled the recipe and had a bunch of leftovers and stuck them in a blender. It was delicious and tasted a little bit like flavored applesauce. Added some yogurt, and it became a breakfast smoothie.

By far my favorite recipe on Allrecipes!  I dice my fruits into tiny cubes..use agave nectar instead of sugar (that failing, I use Splenda brown & white) - and squeeze lime juice over.  I'm too lazy to make chips, so I buy bags of Stacy's cinnamon-sugar pita chips..perfect!!!  Thank you so much, Ann!!!

AWESOME! This was FANTASTIC. I added blueberries and blackberries because I didn't have enough raspberries. I used blueberry preserves and used approximately 1/2 of the sugar in the recipe, and 2/3 of the brown sugar, and it was sweet enough. The chips were great- amazing, I could not believe how easy this was. I brought this to a party and it was a huge hit.

This was really good!  I usually stay true to a recipe the first time but I decided to swap out the raspberries for blueberries (for color) and I used strawberry jam.  It was so pretty and delicious.  My chips took longer than 10 min. It makes a lot of "salsa" so double up on the chips. I will adjust the sugar slightly since my berries were already sweet and in season. Enjoy!

Superior! We love mixed fruit salads and this is an awesome backyard bbq side dish! I didn't have any tortillas on hand, but I did have some wonton wrappers...they baked up nice and crispy and cinnamony....a great substitute for the tortillas!

LOVE this recipe!! I made it for work and everyone raved about it. It did not last long at all and i had to make numerous copies of the recipe to give out. This was also really simple to make...however....i found that baking my chips for 8-10 minutes burned them so i reduced the time to 5-6 minutes. I was also using dark cookie sheets if that makes a difference. :) But so YUMMY!!! :)

I love this recipe!!! I used an egg slicer for some of the prep work and it did not take long at all to make. The grocery store was out of raspberries so i substituted them with blueberries. I used a blackberry jam and cut it back from 3 tablespoons to 2. I did not add any sugar and I thought that it was sweet enough. I bought cinnamon graham crackers instead of making them. The next time that I make this, I am going to add one more kiwi to the mix. I was surprised how much it made, just remember when using all of these fresh fruits, the shelf life is very short. The next day things were a little soggy....

This was a wonderful addition to our breakfast this morning. It took me about 50 min to cut all the fruit and make the cinnamon chips but is was worth the effort! Kids liked it and hubby loved it. Great for school make and takes. I will make this again.

The fruit was EXCELLENT!  I used peach preserves and it was a total hit.  The tortillas are what knocked the rating down a star.  I made them exactly as the recipe specified and they were very chewy.  I think I'll get the cinnamon chips from Trader Joe's as someone else advised.

I made this appetizer at a Superbowl party as a healthier alternative to the wings, fried food, chips & dip that crowded the rest of the table. To my surprise, the fruit salsa went the fastest! My guests loved it! I fancied it up a bit by putting the fruit in a hollowed out pineapple half. It not only tasted great- it looked nice too! There are lots of variations you can use with this recipe, but I find harder tropical fruits that are easy to chop into small bits work the best (Mango, pineapple, strawberries, kiwi, guava, papaya etc...) Apples go brown too quickly, bananas are too mushy and berries are too hard to chop into small bits. I wanted it to be finely chopped to make it easier to pick up with the yummy cinnamon chips.

Wonderful!  I was surprised at how easy the cinnamon chips were to make.  A little time consuming to prepare but totally worth it.

I've made this several times for get-togethers (I have been asked "can you bring that cinnamon chip & salsa thing?!") Adults & kids will eat this.  
I do not think the extra sugar in the salsa is necessary if you have a sweet jam/preserves.  
THANK YOU FOR THIS RECIPE!!

This fruit salsa is awesome!  Everytime I make it for a party or get together, there are never any leftovers. I have made my own chips...but I've also cheated and used the pre-made kind.  I know Archer Farms makes a pretty good cinnamon-sugar tortilla chip!

I omitted the raspberries and put in an extra kiwi. I used peach jam for the fruit preserves.

perfect light snack the chips were great, followed the other suggestions to reduce time and baked for 10 mins.  they taste the best when they just start to turn brown, even good the next day without the salsa.

These recipes are exceptional. I made it the first time (several months ago) exactly as written, and have since improvised with whatever fruit I had or could find. And I always double the amount of cinnamon chips because they're such a hit at my house that they disappear LONG before the fruit does!

I made this attending a dinner party. The theme was Summertime Blues and I chose this one and it was perfect! I didn't have some of the fruits and wanted to use the ones I have before they go bad, so I used frozen blackberries diced, pomegranates, any kind of apple, and instead of the preserves I used some leftover cranberry sauce with raspberries. I didn't add the brown sugar and not too much of the white sugar since the cranberry sauce and the fruit was already sweet enough. I ran out of butter spray, so I did like a dipping method and dipped the tortilla in butter mixed with sugar and cinnamon and baked it as the recipe called for. It was a huge hit! Make extra chips though... they're good even without the salsa. A friend of mine used her salsa on some grilled chicken. Others were just spooning it onto their plates and eating it as a sauce. Perfect for after Turkey Day!

Made this last night for a football party - the cinnamon chips were a hit!  I couldn't keep my husband out of them until the guests arrived.  The fruit salsa was still good - the women seemed to like it better then the men.

I made this for some friends and they just raved about it.  I took someone's advice and used an egg slicer to cut up some of the fruit (strawberries and kiwi).  Worked great!  I used apricot preserves for a light flavor.  Fantastic!

This was really yummy.  I made it for an all day scrap and I received rave reviews.  I left the sugar out of the fruit.  I think this could be made with any seasonal fruit.  I added blueberries and peaches.  You will not be disappointed if you try this one!  Add on:  I made this again and I put the salsa in a tupperware container that had a strainer at the bottom.  This worked out great because all of the juice from the fruit went to the bottom, and the fruit was kept out of the juices.  I think the container is supposed to be for berries.

I make this for every family gathering, actually I'm asked to make this for every family gathering!  An excellent tasting and easy recipe.  I've found that Bonne Manam Four Fruit Preserves work the best in this salsa.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I'm always asked for the recipe when I make this.  Outstanding!  Time consuming to make, but has to made day it's going to be served, gets mushy overnight.  I make the cinnamon chips the night before and put in Ziploc bag. (Only change is I use real, melted butter on tortillas, not spray.

15 minute prep time? Who is kidding who? This recipe took me over an hour to prep. Everyone found the fruit salsa too sweet, even with zero added sugar. Better as a dessert than an appetizer. The chips were delicious which is good considering how time consuming they were.

Absolutely love this exactly as is.  I am the kind of person that wings things and tried to wing this without following the recipe....and no one really loved it.  So the next time I followed the recipe to the T and it was GONE....now I have people begging me to bring this :)  The cinnamon chips are awesome, I butter each one, stack them up, then cut with a pizza cutter, lay on the baking sheet and sprinkle with cinnamon sugar and it couldn't be easier :)

Although I haven't made the Salsa, I did make the chips to finish off a Mexican dinner for 60.  Served it with rainbow sherbert and it was a resounding success, as well as being SO simple and tasty!  Thank you.

DELICIOUS!! I followed the numerous reviews and made the following changes...so glad I did! 1) use frozen peaches instead of raspberries 2) omit the sugar 3) use orange marmalade for the fruit preserve 4) use fugi apples instead of golden delicious - add last  For the tortillas: again I followed the reviews and so glad I did: 1) spray both sides with pam 2) sprinkle both sides with cinn/sugar mix 3) stack 4 high and cut with pizza cutter  I had to flip my tortillas when I cooked them so both sides were crisp (7-8 min on one side and ~5 min on the other side)  one of my all time favorite recipes so far on this site!!!!!

If there is any left over, used as a topping with yogurt and granola makes for a YUMMY breakfast! (I didn't add any sugars as recommended by other reviews.)

Oh my!  Amazing!  The store I went to was out of raspberries, so I skipped those.  I used strawberry all fruit preserves.  I wanted to make this healthier, so I used baking splenda instead of sugar and splenda brown sugar blend instead of brown sugar.  I used whole wheat tortillas.  I was afraid that they wouldn't work out too well, but they were awesome.  I also used splenda for the cinnamon sugar on the tortillas.  I combined 1/4 cup splenda with 4 teaspoons of cinnamon and sifted it over the tortillas.  I sprayed both sides of the tortillas with the butter flavor Pam, stacked them and cut into wedges with a pizza cutter.  Then I sifted on the cinn sugar and sprayed again.  They turned out perfect at about 10 minutes.  This was amazing!  One more thing. . . I saw that people were saying that this recipe takes too long.  I bought a Vidalia Chopper at Bed Bath and Beyond and it is awesome!  It makes preparing this recipe a snap!  I use it with so many things, guacamole, salsa, anything you need to chop!  I highly recommend it for this recipe.

This was absolutley delicious. I made it for our church's prayer meeting, and they really enjoyed it. I used seedless grapes (diced) instead of rasberries, and I left out 1 tbs of white sugar so it wouldnt be too sweet of a dish. It was fantastic, make sure you put a little bit of lemon juice on the apples to prevent browning, I would definately recommend this!

I think I may have had ultra-high expectations based on all of the rave reviews and that may be tainting my opinion.  It was good, but not GREAT.  I DO love the change of pace of the fruit salsa, but it hasn't become my fav go to recipe I expected it to.  I used peaches, plums, kiwi, strawberry, and blueberries gelled w/apple jelly.  The chips, just ok.  I will make ths recipe again and I'm going to try either cutting tortillas into squares and shaping them in mini-muffin tins to make "scoops" or try the same idea w/wonton wrappers.   This was a crowd pleaser-thanks for a change of pace summer recipe!

I doubled this recipe and took it to a party of 25 people, and it was pretty much all gone by the end of the night. We used blueberries, strawberries and kiwi, and pineapple (not canned). My recommendation -- bake the chips longer, we did about 13 minutes, so the were light golden browm, not tough but crispy -- the butter spray worked prefectly.  Also, don't skip the jam --  we used strawberry and it helps to hold the salsa together.   No sugar is needed in the salsa.  I also drained it before I served it, then gave it a good stir.

OOOHHHH MMMMYYY!!!  What a fabulous little recipe.  I used kiwi, apple, strawberry, blueberry, grapes and apricot preserve.  I skipped the sugar and it was plenty plenty sweet from the fruits.  I made ahead of time by a couple of hours and it did have a nice juice that formed on the bottom of the bowl that I just stirred up and dunked away- with those delicious chips.
I only needed 1 cup sugar and 1 tbsp of cinnamon and it coated all my chips plenty.  I followed suit and put all chips in a big tupperware with sugar and cinnamon and mixed around.  I baked some on a baking sheet and some in mini muffin tins and I like the muffin tins ones the most..you really can get a good scoop of the fruit with the juice in them.  Can't wait to make for a party to impress.

This recipe ROCKS!!!  I made it last night for my Bunko Mamas group and it was a hit!  I substituted golden delishes apples for pink lady (my fave) and blackberries for raspberries.  I also used melted butter instead of spray and splenda instead of sugar and it worked perfectly!  Like someone else suggested, I used a muffin pan for the chips to make scoops!  Great Idea!

To top it off this recipe, it looks so pretty :)

This recipe was great.  I skipped the sugars and fruit preserves in the salsa because the fruit was sweet enough on its own.  I made fruit parfaits with this recipe alternating layers of salsa, broken cinnamon chips and vanilla frozen yogurt.  It was delicious and looked beautiful in clear wine glasses.

This recipe is the best! I use 2 kiwis, 1 apple, 1 lb strawberries, and 1/2 pineapple. I don't have to add any sugar, because the pineapple is so naturally sweet. I also used the minimuffin pan for the chips, and it turned out perfect! I make it for any and every social occasion now, and always come back with an empty bowl. :) Try adding pineapple, it really makes it special!

Just when you think there's nothing new, along comes something like this. It's a year-round favorite; try using the frozen mixed berries. I recommend letting the "salsa" sit overnight...a little orange juice will keep the apple from turning brown and adds another layer of flavor. Yum! I join the list of five-star reviewers!

I have made this twice now in the last week.  It is amazing!  I made it exactly by the recipe the first time and it was awesome.  The second time, I used Granny Smith apples to give it a little extra punch.  We really liked the sour with the sweet. I also used blueberries instead of raspberries for extra color. Instead of chopping everything, I used a food processor and made everything much smaller--more like a regular Salsa.  This "salsa" and the chips are so refreshing and we love them.  My husband even loves it, and he is not a big fruit eater.  One of the best (and easiest) recipes ever!!!

This is excellent.  I have made several times for kid's parties and while the kids enjoy it the grown ups love it.  I made for a Halloween party and used Halloween cookie cutters to cut out the chips.  Anytime there is a party at our house, everyone now expects this dish to be served.  I have never had any left overs,

This is a very versatile recipe.  You may need to add more sugar depending on how fresh and sweet your fruit it.  Delicious served with spicy foods.  My company loved it and so did my kids.

Super delicious!! I made this for a mexican get together with friends and everyone LOVED it. I made a few changes, we didn't have any fresh raspberries so I bought frozen and thawed them a bit. We didn't have strawberries either so I threw in some diced watermelon. When making this I thought there wouldn't be enough salsa, so I threw in extra fruit, but this wasn't necessary at all. Try this, everyone will love it!

This is a great, fresh recipe.  The extra sugar is not needed though.  Adding the preserves gives it enough juice and a good consistency.  Brush the tortillas with melted butter before the cinnamon sugar and the chips crips perfectly!

I made this for Easter Brunch and it was a bigger hit than the ham and that was saying alot!I will be making this for our Cinco De Mayo party at work. Allow extra time for making the chips, they are a bit time consuming!

Very easy to prepare, however, I prepared the fruit salsa 6+ hours before serving and found that the kiwi had broken down and the salsa had become way too soupy with juice from the fruit. The chips were very good but we all found it too difficult to scoop the salsa onto the chips. We resorted to using a spoon to spoon it on top. All in all it tasted fresh and sweet. Added plus is that you can prpare it using Splenda sweetener and fat free tortillas making this a wonderfully low calorie, low fat treat! :) Great as dessert! Alternative to chips-make same way but form the whole tortilla into a dish shape using an oven proof bowl. Spoon fruit into cinnamon sugar tortilla dish and top with a dollop of Cool Whip!:)

This was excellent and well recieved.  I gave it 4 stars because I made a sample with preserves and thought it overwhelmed the overall taste of the dish.  I used 1/2 the sugar and used all lt. brown sugar.  I also left out the kiwi.  People loved it!  The chips are great and can be baked at a higher temp for a shorter amount of time.  I also used Splenda sugar substitute and cinnamon sugar for a low cal alternative - Awesome!  Couldn't tell the difference.  By the way I used butter on the chips and Spray Pam. The Pam chips turned out much lighter tasting - which was preferrable for me!  Enjoy it - it's great at parties.  The suggested serving is right on.  I made a double batch for 13 people and it was way to much.

This tasted good, but it got too soggy after sitting out for just a short while. Also, the cinnamon sugar kept falling off of the chips. I would also recommend using 6 or 8-inch tortillas to make smaller and more manageable chips. Not worth all the work.

I made this for a neighborhood block party last night, and was asked for the recipe many times.  Instead of using the raspberries, which are very expensive in Minnesota this time of year, I used a 5 oz. bag of dried cranberries, cherries and blueberries.  The juice from the fruit rehydrated the dried fruit, making the salsa less runny.  Also the cranberries added a nice tartness to the sweetness of the salsa.  An excellent appetizer!

This was good. The prep time is WAY off though. It is pretty time consuming (the chips mainly). I had to cook them much longer than specified.Next time I would add more apples for texture and less sugar (it is very sweet and especially so with the chips). I added pineapple and used apricot for the preserves. This was a pretty good recipe although I think the ratings were a bit generous. It is good but not nec. something to shout on the mountain tops about.

I make this all of the time but I don't add the sugars or preserves. It tastes just as good but there are two tricks. Make it the night before, then it marinates in it's own juices. The second trick is to get the berries that are very soft and are almost bad. They are sweeter and you don't need the sugar! I make this for every get together because my guests request it! :)

Wow, was this great!!  I used 4 kiwis, 2 fuji apples sprinkled with fresh lemon juice to keep them from browning, 1 cup diced frozen peaches, 1 lb. strawberries and NO added sugar.  I used 3 Tbl. raspberry preserves (loved the flavor!), and ended up needing a little more juice to it all (probably because of the additional kiwis), so I added 1 Tbl. fresh orange juice.  Perfect!  Spraying the fronts AND backs of the tortillas, then dredging in a mixture of 1 cup sugar + 1 Tbl. cinnamon was perfect!  Don't let the chips overlap, or they will be gooey in that overlapped spot.  I also tried whole wheat tortillas and they were great!  I baked them 9 minutes on a cookie sheet with foil.  Note that if after a couple of days the chips become stale, just pop them back in the oven at 350 for 5 minutes.  Taste as good as when you initially made them!  Thanks for the recipe!

Tried a different fruit combo: braeburn apples, strawberries, blueberries, raspberries, fresh pineapple, and peaches. Really didn't need to add any sweetener, but added 1 TBSP sugar just to make more liquid while it sits. 

I used spray Parkay for the chips, but would use butter flavored cooking spray instead- the spray butter allowed for too much cinnamon/sugar mixture to stay on the chips. I paired 2 tortillas, cut them in half, placed the halves together, then cut the half-circle shapes into 4 triangles. A scissors worked great. Then I laid the pieces on a plate, sprayed one side, flipped them & sprayed the other side. I mixed the cinnamon & sugar in a gallon zip-close bag, placed 4 traingles at a time in the bag & shook to coat. Baked them 10-12 minutes per batch at 400. 
Super easy!! The whole family loved it!!

ABSOLUTELY OUTSTANDING!  Used 6" flour tortillas cut into 6ths.  Brushed both sides with butter before sprinkling the cinnamon sugar on top.

I tested this recipe on my boyfriend before I served it at a dinner party...he loved it!  I omitted the strawberries and used pineapple preserves.  I also used a mini food processor and added the apple chunks last and it gave the fruit salsa a great texture.  Delicious and healthy snack!!

This was amazing! I forgot kiwis so I threw in a pear to make up for missing fruit. I also used blueberries instead of raseberries, since thats what I had on hand. I cut the sugar in half and it still turned out a bit sweet, so I think next time I will omit the sugar altogether. I will for sure be making this again!

Very easy and healthy snack. Next time will omit raspberries. They seem to over power just a lil. But that is just me because my husband liked it just as is. My toddler liked the cinnamon chips! :)

Everyone loved this!  I added extra fruit - 3 kiwis, 12 ounces raspberries, 3 apples (2 braeburn and 1 granny smith) and I had some frozen peaches to use up so I chopped up some of those also.  I only had 1 lb of strawberries but wish I had more, they were surprisingly good for this time of the year!  I kept the jam amount the same and just sprinkled some brown sugar over the top.  I also tossed my apples with lemon juice, just in case, I didnt want them browning up at all.  The tortilla chips with cinnamon and sugar were wonderful also!  I can't wait to make this again and try some different fruit combo's.

I have used this recipe for years and love it.  I too will cut the sugar and preserves but I think it is better if you use rasberry preserves.  I have used the egg cutter to cut the strawberries as well.  If you are in a big hurry and the texture isn't as important to you--you can use a food proccesor as well.  I prefer fresh strawberries but for blackberries and raspberries I have used frozen and it didn't seem to alter the recipes too much. This is a healthy recipe for an after school snack for kids.  I am diabetic and so I will add cinnamon as well---but watch it if your diabetic--its is soo good, its easy to get too many carbs as there is more fruit than it seems because it is cut up and thus concentrated.

Followed the fruit part exactly and was so good!  For the tortillas, I melted butter and brushed on cut tortillas and sprinkled with the cinnamon sugar.  Layed on the buttered side and then brushed with butter and the cinnamon sugar on top.  Baked 4 minutes and turned and baked another 4 minutes.  Made at Christmas and was totally gone.

The chips are great so I'd give that a 5 but the whole fruit on chips really wasn't that grande.  I prepared this for New Years and no one really ate it but me.  However, I used a frozen bag of fruit that did not have apples in it so maybe the apples would have helped?  Thought I'd try since it got so many good reviews but I won't make again.  Sorry!

This is my first time posting a rating.  I must say that LOVE this website!   I made the recipe as is using the idea to shake the chips in a baggy to coat with the sugar mixture.  The chips were time consuming but a huge hit with my family.  My husband loved the salsa and the chips. He is a health nut and won’t eat most of my creamy or rich appetizers when we entertain.  This he loved.  He has been asking me to make it again! Score!

Can't believe I haven't left a review for this yet! I made this while camping with my sister and her family and it was a huge, huge hit. Nothing was left in the bowl by the end of the afternoon and it was absolutely fantastic. I'm making it again for New Year's day at our get-together and honestly, I can't wait to get my hands on it! Great stuff to be sure. Thanks Ann!!!

absolutely DEEEE-LICIOUS and a huge hit at a party!  This will be a regular on the menu.  The only thing I did differently was BUY Stacey's Cinnamon Pita chips as I'm to lazy to make them.  :-)  HUGE HIT!

I made this recipe for a class party as a healthier alternative for dessert.  Everyone loved the salsa and asked for the recipe.  Before adding the sugars and apricot preserves, I drained the fruit with a pasta drainer.  It came out amazing, but I wasn't wild about the chips.. I think next time I will use cinnamon pita chips or bagel chips.

Oh my this is good! Fresh and Fruity Flavor with crunch and a bit of sweetness! I have made this and severed it with the cinnamon chips, as topping on a plain sponge cake, as well as just by it self as a fruit side dish in the summer. I added a bit more brown sugar and white sugar to make it just a bit sweeter. 1 tsp each. The best part of this is the great unusual taste combination. Not your typical fruit combination, as well as the pretty color it adds to your dinner table or party. I have made this over and over again because it is always requested at family gatherings. My kids love it!

This is a great dish! Kids & Grownups all loved it. We used a different variety of fruit but I think it would be equally delish with whatever is fresh...I will be making this again...would also be a good one for the kids to help with.

It was okay.  The cinnamon chips went stale really quick.  Don't believe I will make this again considering the effort put into the recipe.

Not bad, I used strawberries, kiwi, granny smith apples, peach, blueberries and chopped all in my mini chopper to get more of a salsa type.  I put honey on it as this was what I had as far as jelly.  Chips were good, but do take a while to make.

Quite good. I honestly think you could use less sugar if the fruits are very ripe.

Love this recipe! My kids request this recipe when friends come over. We have used many variations with the fruit, depending on what we have on hand. Pineapples and mandarin oranges have been good additions for my family's taste. I don't usually add the sugar. It's plenty sweet with the natural sugars from the fruit. And i've tried it without the preserves and it's STILL GREAT!! I don't think you can mess up this recipe.  Thanks so much for this post!!

Took this to a friends house last night most everyone enjoyed it.  I made the sugar/brw sugar pres. mixer and tasted it before I put on friut.  It was to sweet for my taste so only sprinkled a few teaspoons on the fruit and let it sit in fridge for several hours and mixed well.  I diced everything up but the raspberries in small pieces.  And it took forver to get the torillas crispy, I had to bake both sides.  Next time I will just fry the torillas and shake in bag with cinnom. and sugar, may not be healthier but faster and easier.  I will make this again.

Love Love Love this recipe.  I blended the berries a bit in my small food processor to make it a bit more salsa like, used Apple Cinnamon preserves, and tossed the tortillas in a bag of cinnamon and sugar to make it easier.  A Huge hit everytime I make this.  Also used the salsa as a topping for cheesecake =)

it was super easy to make, but I found that it was far too sweet. I would definitely leave out the white sugar and cut the amount of preserves in half. Instead of tortilla chips, I made cinnamon pita chips. I followed the same directions as the tortilla chips but cut the pita bread so that there is the top and the bottom of the piece and cut each side in fourths and then the fourths in half (eighths), sprayed with butter flavored cooking spray and sprinkled cinnamon sugar on them, and then sprayed them again

Like others, I cut back on the sugar.  I also made this by making small bowls out of the tortilas and putting in a scoop of vanilla ice cream and topping with the fruit.  Yum

This is a fun desert to play around with. I especially love the cinnamon chips. I took the advice of a review and sprayed butter flavored Pam on the front and back of each tortilla, then poured the sugar/cinnamon mixture over. I also prefer to cut them into strips than wedges (just easier to eat without the chips being so wide). Also, please whatever you do, cut the sugar. I am a sugar lover, and decided to make the recipe with the sugar, but it was way toooooo sweet. I also didn't use any preserves because I didn't have any, it still tasted great. But be warned, it doesn't last well. Make it when you plan on using it. All in all, this is a great recipe. I am sure I will be using it many more times.

I LOVE this recipe!! So do all that I prepare it for! The only thing I change is the white sugar. I don't add it because it is plenty sweet. I like using an orange marmalade as the preserve. Super Yummy!!

I agree with the reviewer who cut back on the sugar.  It's best to make, serve and eat in the same day.  Left overs don't last beyond the first serving, so I would not make this in advance.  I need to play around with the cinnamon chips.  I don't believe I got it right, so I used cinnamon graham crackers instead.

Made this for a party over the 4th of July wkend.  It was a HUGE hit.  The salsa is so yummy.  One note, instead of spraying with butter flavor cooking spray, we brushed the tortillas's with butter and then sprinkled on the cinnamon sugar.  As a time saver, brush/spray all the WHOLE tortillas and make a stack, then use a bread knife to cut the entire stack into wedges.

This was a huge hit at my bbq tonight! The chips were fantastic! HOWEVER, make sure you bake the chips long enough or else it will be really tough. If the chips seem tough or hard to chew, just put them back in the oven for 5-10 minutes. I ended up baking my chips for about 20 minutes for each batch. I used a pizza cutter for the chips and it worked out great!! I also added nectarines and blueberries for color. I think next time i'll used a different kind of apple because the golden delicious apples were a tad sour. A lot of water juice/liquid comes out of this dip from the sugars so I just poured some of the juice out so it wouldn't be so soupy. I also didn't put any brown sugar because other reviewers said it was too sweet. Anyways, awesome summer snack! Thanks so much!!

I made this for dessert at a BBQ we had.  Everyone loved it.  The Cinnamon Chips were great & this whole dish was easy to prepare.  

I used Strawberries, Raspberries, Gala Apple and a Red Pear. I used a Mixed Berry jam and the results were great!! I cut the fruit into small squares so it would be easy to scoop with the chips. 

There is no need for measurements really I could make this and adjust it to the quantity I want and tailor the fruit to our likes or dislikes.  I will be making this for a long time and will be my go to in a pinch.

A friend made this for a work potluck and it was delicious.  She used the fruit she had on hand (cherries, blackberries, raspberries, kiwi, pears, nectartines and strawberries) and the juice of one lemon. She only used the brown sugar and omitted the white sugar.  The most amazing part (believe it or not) is that she served it with lime tortilla chips instead of the cinnamon chips! I know it sounds like a horrible combination, but it really was delicious!

I've made this and it turned it pretty good.  I should have made more tortilla chips because there was a lot of fruit salsa left over.  Very sweet.

I used strawberry preserves, so I decreased the amount of strawberries to about 8 oz and then added about 8 oz of blueberries.  Everyone I've ever made this for loves it!

Loved it! Very tasty. Big family favorite; Added some sugar to make it a little more juicy.  Nice summer dish; only complaint was that I didn't have enough space for the chips, and some of them got burned. Maybe I'lll use two sheets next time.

This is a great recipe.  The chips are so simple to make and the salsa is excellent.  The recipe is also great because it leaves plenty of room for variation.  I wanted some heat so I added a jalepeno pepper and I had a mango that added some more flavor.

The fruit salsa was a hit at my house!  I didn't have kiwi or rasberries so used stawberries, blueberries, apples, a peach, and a nectarine.  I also only used the 1 tbl of brown sugar.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Super duper scrumptious! Perfect for a beach party I went to today & everyone loooved it! I made a ton of chips per the other reviews & glad I did as people did munch on those alone. 
I substituted mango for rasberries because I love mango & thought some orange would be a nice addition. Also added about a 1/2 cup of blueberries for color. It was very pretty. 
I suspect it depends on the fruit you're using & its level of ripeness but I added absolutely no sugar at all. All of my fruit was very ripe. The mango in particular added more than enough sweetness that I almost didn't even add the preserves either. 
I did end up using apricot preserves which worked very well but think it would have been excellent without it too. If your fruit is ripe the salsa will be sweet, really that's it. 
I tripled the recipe so, out of necessity, used a food processor. I pulsed each fruit separately being careful not to over process them into a mush then tossed them together. Turned out to be perfect! Not only did it speed up the process immensely but also chopped up everything to an ideal size giving it a real chunky salsa appearance (rather than a fruit salad) & making it easy to scoop up with the chips which would have been difficult with larger pieces.
Peeled, chopped & added the apples (Fuji) last & they never browned despite being made the day before & sitting in the sun for 5 hours. 
Wonderful recipe! I will be making this weekly to have around the house for snacks. Thank you!!! Ingenious!

Everyone at my family get togethers LOVES this dish now!  Although I think there is one thing that is essential (at least from my experience) that is an absolute dealbreaker here, and that is the texture of the fruit.  The first time I made this dish, I sliced up the fruit into small chunks with a knife.  Everyone liked it, but it wasn't a huge hit.  The second time, I used a blade chopper and chopped the pieces up much finer like actual salsa (in my picture).  This time everyone LOVED the dish, and it was completely gone.  It seems like the smaller the chunks the better, but without it being soupy.  I also used fuji apples, boysenberry preserves, and added a small amount of blueberries!

I just wanted to make the chips from this recipe and they were great.  I made them the first time using the spray, and to add more flavor (and extra calories) i used melted margarine to brush them the 2nd time.  They were much crisper and tastier with the margarine if you can stand the added calories.  I served them with chunky applesauce, just like they used to have at one of the fast food Mexican places.  My dad said these were awesome, which is a huge compliment.

I made this for my daughters birthday party thinking that the kids would like it as well as the adults. It was devoured by all, young and old, and every adult there asked where I got my recipe from because it was delicious and unique. I made the recipe just as it reads using strawberry preserves. The only thing I will change next time I make this, and I will make it again and again, is that I will make at least double the amount of chips. By just making the 10 tortillas the chips only lasted about half way through the bowl of salsa. GREAT recipe!

I really liked this recipe for it's freshness.  However, I used raspberry preserves and wished I would have used orange marmalade.  It would have been twice as nice!  I was a little discouraged to see the kiwis turn brown overnight, and I would mention that this is a "use today" type of recipe.  Other than those things, I would have given it a five star rating.  Maybe next time I would add a little lemon juice to preserve the green or omit the raspberries all together.  Thanks for a sharing!  I will make this again but with some changes.

I love this recipe!  I am on my 3rd year of making it for our Cinco de Mayo party.  I make it different every time; sometimes blueberries instead of raspberries or both.  I use apricot preserves and cut back on the white sugar.  So tasty!

I made this for an appetizer and it was delicious! The chips turned out great, and the salsa itself is amazing. Best cold, as it is slightly tart when first made. Was good enough on the second morning to use as a topping for crepes we made--so good! My only complaint is when the fruit is out of season, it's slightly pricey to make--but worth it!

I made a Newfoundland version of this recipe. I combine blueberries, partridgeberries and bake apples, added sugar (not much - I wanted to taste the bite of the partridgeberries), and used NF-picked cranberry sauce as my preserve. Fresh, tarte, and FULL of flavor. Loved it.
And to top it off, I opened a bottle of "Moose Juice", a local wine made in Twillingate, NL. It is a wine made from partridgeberries and blueberries, and was so smooth and just the right sweetness to go with this. 
I cheated and bought the cinnamon chips, but won't do that again. Many were cracked too small to use. I will use this recipe (with the hints for speeding up the process) next time.
Thanks for the inspiration! I will make this again soon.

I think I might use my mom's food processor thing to make it finer. I'll be back! Sounds really really yummy.

We loved it!  It's  nice recipe to add to as well.  I added more kiwis, tossed in some blueberries for color, and a pear just because I had one sitting there looking at me.  
For the chips, I tried what some other reviewers suggested, spraying both sides of the tortillas and dredging them in the cinnamon/sugar, but those came out a little sticky and chewy.  Just doing one side came out perfect and crispy.
All in all, a great recipe, perfect for kids, crowds, or anyone!

This was soooooo good! I only used 1 Tbs of white and brown sugar and I use apricot preserves and I can't stop eating it! For the tortillas, I just used a pizza cutter and cut 3 at a time, laid them on the baking sheet, sprayed, sprinkled then sprayed again. Perfect sanitizer for any party.

This is novel enough to cause quite a stir at a dinner party.  Everyone seems to really love it, and I don't mind if there is a little left.  I use leftover salsa to top my oatmeal and yogurt.  It is delicious!

This is a keeper!  A refreshing change from the usual savory salsa.  Admittedly, a bit time consuming to make.  I've made it twice already.  Both kids and adults really enjoyed it.  You don't have to use all the cinnamon sugar mix.  I used a mix of white and whole wheat tortillas.  I sprayed and sugared both sides of the tortilla, stacked them and used a pizza cutter to cut it into 12 wedges.  For the salsa I used two types of apples, 1 lb of strawberries and 2 mangoes.  I omitted the 2Tbsps of white sugar; it was sweet enough with 1Tbsp brown sugar and 3Tbsp of strawberry freezer jam.  I made a bowl for the salsa out of one tortilla (spray both sides of tortilla and gently press into oven proof bowl.  Bake at 350 degrees for about 10 minutes until crispy) as one reviewer suggested.  Even the tortilla bowl was good to eat (all that was left)!  I will definitely make this again and try multigrain tortillas next time.

I've made this severals times with whatever fruit looks good.  It seems like such a great idea, especially for kids.  And the chips always disappear, but the salsa seems to confuse children an unadventurous eaters.

Excellent!  My entire family loved this!  Although I didn't follow it to a T, it was still well received.  I just used whatever fruit I had on hand, especially the pieces that weren't very nice looking anymore.  What a great way to use up extra fruit!  Thanks for the recipe!

This is one of the most delicious things I've ever had.  If I could give it more than five stars, I would.  I took it to a party and had people  begging for the recipe.  I used raspberry preserves and didn't change the recipe at all.

This was good but too sweet with too much liquid.  Next time I'll halve the sugar. I used a pizza cutter to slice up the tortillas, which worked really well.

Thank you Ann for a delicious and healthy recipe.  Everybody who has tried it loves it!  I did not use any sugar in the salsa and I used blueberry preserves, yum!  I also added some fresh peaches.  I made the chips one tortilla at a time by spraying both sides with the butter flavored cooking spray, cutting it with a pizza cutter and shaking it in the cinnamon and sugar in a baggy.  Well worth the chopping time!!!

Delicious as expected and worth the time to make it.  I added mango and used Splenda instead of sugar. Need to tweak the tortilla chips..not sweet enough.  This was a HIT on the boat and perfect for a summer day.  Thanks!

This was awesome. I used peaches instead of raspberries and didn't use any extra sugar. I would have cut down the fruit preserves (I used strawberry) to about 2 tbs. After reading some reviews, I used Fuji apples and added the apples last. I sprayed tortillas butter spray, front and back, and then cut them with the pizza cutter. I put the sugar mix: 1 c sugar and 1 t cinnamon and dredged the pieces through, though I had some sugar left over. I baked at 9 minutes - 10 was too long.

YUMMMMMMMMMY! This is THE BEST APPETIZER you can take to a party. EVERYONE will love it. The fruit is so awesome, and the chips, even better! I used everything as said, except half the amount of sugar's and one apple. Blueberries instead of rasberries, and one small can of peaches. and let it set overnight.  IT IS SO YUMMY. THANK YOU.  P.S the fruit will be so good on anything. Icrecream, waffles, pancakes, plain, yogurts, just you name it.  YUMMMMMM!

Totally awesome.  No need for extra sugar, just the preserves.  The cinnamon chips are equally as good as the salsa.  A must at all future get togethers now.

Wow!  This is a great recipe! I only made 1 real change. I lessened the sugar by 1T.  (Used 1 1/2T white, 1/2T brown).  I found the chips to be easiest to make by spraying the front of one tortilla at a time with the butter spray, dredging them in a bowl of the cinnamon sugar, placing them on a cookie sheet and spritzing them with butter spray again.  Other reviewers suggested spraying and coating both sides of the tortillas but that turned into a disaster for me!

I didn't have time to make the chips, so I just made the salsa part - OH MY GOSH, I love this stuff!!!  The only bad thing I can say is that the color's didn't stay bright, and it got a bit "juicy".  We used this as a topping for our cheesecake.  WOW, it was really really good! I didn't use raspberries...I think I may have used pineapple in it's place. Thanks for the great recipe:)

This is awesome!  Everyone always wants the recipe.  I usually make a double batch because we love it so much.  One thing I have tested and was happy to find, is that you can freeze it, and it is just as good as when made fresh!

While shopping for the fruit for this dish, I picked up a 4 oz package of ponegranate seeds.  They were a wonderful addition to the salsa - adding lots of crunch and zing.  Everyone raved.

I love this recipe! It is sooo good for a summer dessert. I made it with apples, strawberries and grapes with Strawberry preserves and it was amazing. Everyone loved it! I recommend using spray butter, rather than cooking spray for the chips.

Absolutely delish!!  Made this twice within the last two weeks and have had to give the recipe to about ten people.  Used fresh strawberries, kiwis, apples, and 12 oz. frozen blueberries instead of the raspberries and it held together really well without getting soggy.  Used apricot preserves.  The first time I made it, I added the apples just before serving because I thought they would turn brown,,,but when we had leftovers, two days later, the apples were still fresh and crisp.  The second time I made it I went ahead and added the apples right away and they did not turn brown and they stayed crisp (I refrigerated the apples before adding). The chips were easy to make:  1) Spray several tortillas on both sides with cooking spray 2) Stack and cut with pizza cutter  3) Toss the wedges into a 9x13" pan filled with cinnamon sugar  4) Bake on ungreased cookie sheet for about 9 minutes.  Cool on wire rack Note:  If adults only will be devouring this, you can sneak in a sprinkling of Grand Marnier if desired!!  Yummm

I used olive oil nonstick spray on the tortillas since I don't usually buy butter spray and it worked great.  Didn't taste olive oil-y at all.  I also served the "chips and salsa" with a mock "sour cream" made up of whipped cream cheese, vanilla yogurt, and a little brown sugar.  That atop the fruit and tortillas was almost like eating bits of cheesecake!  Very good!

Big hit with family and friends.  This recipe is very adaptable to your tastes in fruit.  I used all fresh fruit - strawberries, kiwis (which add nice color), applies, raspberries, and mango.  For the jam, I used apricot preserves.  I did not add the sugar and don't think it is needed.  A small dice on the fruit works best.  Kept the raspberries whole.   Made a double batch of the chips and still had some salsa left.  Sprayed the tortillas with butter flavored spray on both sides, stacked 4 or 5 together and cut in wedges.  Dredged in a pie plate of my own cinnamon sugar mix.   Baked for about 10 minutes.

AMAZING!  A few subs--I used I can't believe it's not butter spray on the tortillas and then dredged them (twice) in the cinnamon sugar mix.  I baked for about 10 minutes (first batch), 9 on the second and 7 on the third (as the batches got smaller so did the cooking time).  I then dusted the freshly baked chips with generous sprinkle of the cinnamon sugar mixture!  For the fruit I used strawberries, kiwi, papaya, and fuji apples with peach preserves.  People fought over the leftovers to take home!  I did use some of the leftover sauce to saute some shrimp and it was an incredible flavor.  Tons of uses for the salsa...on pound cake, in a crepe, on pancakes, the list is endless!   I already have requests to make it again!

I got rave reviews when I made this! Although it did take a while to make your own chips, it was worth it. I cut the fruit up a lot smaller than the picture and blended some in a food processor.  It made the fruit salsa similar to the consistency of regular chunky hot salsa and easier to scoop with the chips.

This is the best!  I have tried it with several different fruits and it is great not matter what I put in there!  The chips are super but when I am in a pinch, I buy Tostitos flour tortilla chips, open the bag and dump in some sugar & cinnamon mixture and shake it - works like a charm!

I could eat this with a spoon, straight up!! 

I made this for our Mexican Fiesta last night. I didn't have raspberries but I did use raspberry jam as my preserve. I was worried about cutting up the apples but I added a little orange soda (pop) and still this morning they looked perfect. The taste was just terrific! I think it would be great on top of vanilla ice cream. :)

I'm going to re-review this. I made this once for a party and it was great. I'm making it again for Easter but I wanted to comment a little further. First, to all the reviewers who didn't like this because it was too liquidy: This is a SALSA not a salad so expect it to be juicy. I don't think I have every had a salsa that isn't really juicy. If you want a fruit salad use a different recipe because this isn't what you're looking for. But, if you want a salsa but just want it a little LESS juicy (this will also make it a little less sweet for those who complained that it was too sweet), try 1) using harder tart apples like you would for an apple pie 2) use kiwis that aren't all the way ripe so they are harder and less juicy (since you add the sugar sauce anyway you won't notice the tartness) and 3) before adding the sugar/preserve sauce, put all the chopped fruit in a salad spinner and spin some of the juices out. 4) toss in the raspberries at the end so they don't mush up when you toss in the sugar/preserve mixture.  This will make the salsa a little more chunky and less juicy. But like I said, its salsa, so expect it to be juicy. This is a really awesome recipe if you don't mind all the time consuming chopping.  You really do have to use fresh fruit, not frozen. I used apple flavored jelly for the preserves. Fantastic. I could do without the cinnamon chips personally. They aren't that bad but you can buy better ones at the grocery store. Too much work and they are kind of bor

This was great!  Time saving tip:  put your cinnamon/sugar in a galon zip-lock bag. spray the tortilla's, cut into chips and then put them in your cinnamon/sugar bag and shake.  They will evenly coat and taste great.  I baked mine for 8 minutes and they were perfect!  I had about three batches. I also drained the extra fruit juice off the salsa before  serving. It can be soupy otherwise.  My girlfriends loved this...super easy and wonderful!

I have to be honest.... I was expecting something amazing based on reviews but I thought this recipe was just "ok". Maybe it's just me though. Some tips... Make the day before. The apples don't turn brown and the flavor melds together better after sitting. My biggest disappointment was the chips. I made them according to the directions however I burnt the first 2 batches. Mine were done after only 5 minutes on the middle rack. Also.. load on the cinnamon/sugar mix. The ones that were lightly sugared taste kinda gross. GOOD LUCK to others. Again, it wasn't aweful, just time consuming for the finished result.

HOLY SMOKES this is good stuff!!!  I have made it twice this week!! I ended up using splenda brown sugar and splenda, along with sugarfree strawberry and apricot preserves to keep it sugarfree.  No one can tell its a sugarfree version.  This salsa is incredibly addictive!  I tried several versions of chips... I used flour tortillas/corn tortillas/low carb tortillas... the best was either the flour or corn, the low carb stays too chewy... but I made a mixture of splenda brown sugar and cinnamon and sprayed the butter flavored crisco on them and they were great!!!

This was excellent.. the hit of the picnic! Here's what I did differently - I used 1 Fuji apple (rubbed with lemon juice so it wouldnt brown) 1 pear, 1 peach, 1 nectarine, 2 kiwi, about a half cup of pineapple, 1 pint each of strawberries and blueberries... all fresh. I added NO sugar, and used 2 teaspoons of raspberry preserves. I diced the strawberries, kiwi, and pineapple the night before.. keeping them in separate containers, of course. I did not use a food chopper if you dice the fruit by hand it will help to avoid a mushy salsa. I made the chips the night before, to save time. For the chips - i used 2 bags of 10 inch tortillas. From that I got 2 big Hefty Zip Lock bags full. I did the butter cooking spray and cinnamon sugar on each side, and cut them with a pizza cutter. I did some flat on a cookie sheet, and some in mini muffin pans.. the cookie sheets are the way to go if you wanna save on time - the muffin pan chips were fun for the scoopable effect. I baked them at 350 for about 10 minutes and then let them cool on the hot cookie sheet which left them with a nice crispness. The chips were a HUGE hit. Everyone raved about them. Yes - this recipe is time consuming. Be prepared for that from the start.It is worth the effort. My father-in-law even asked me for the recipe. He has NEVER asked me for a recipe in 15 years. This recipe is that good. He wasnt the only one - everyone wanted details. It is definitely a keeper... and will become a July 4th staple at our picnics.

Red color will bleed into other fruit.  To prepare early, I just cut and stored all fruit separate the morning of the event then mixed it all together minutes before everyone arrived.  YUMMY!

Why rate it - The ratings speak for themselves!  YUMMY!!!  I used melted butter instead of spray on the tortillas and it turned out great.  I served this for a baby shower and everyone raved about it. Made the mom to be jealous :)
I also used individual waffle ice cream bowls to serve it in so the juice wouldn't run all over the plate.  At the end, the bowl is edible too!

This is an awesome recipe! If you need something for a big group of people-it is your choice. I made it for a Snack Day at work and it went very fast. I received a lot of compliments on this dish. I didn't change anything in the recipe as it is great as it is. Next time I would probably leave sugar out or cut it in half. Anyway, it is a great and simple recipe. Thanks!

Amazing blend of flavors! The chips were good, but a little messy trying to eat them. Be sure to dump all of the excess off first. This is good stuff. Makes good sandwiches too, like instead of jelly.

I've been making this recipe for years and it's a hit with everyone.  You can basically use any kind of fruits you wish and you won't compromise the flavor of this salsa.  
The cinnamon chips are very tasty with the cinnamon and sugar sprinkled on them and the crunch from baking them in the oven....I love this recipe!
Thank you!

i HAVE BROUGHT THIS RECIPE TO SEVERAL FUNCTIONS.  I HAVE RECEIVED RAVE REVIEWS.  THE SALSA IS VERY REFRESHING.  MY NIECE HAD A SWEET SIXTEEN BIRTHDAY PARTY AND MADE A SPECIAL REQUEST THAT I MAKE IT FOR HER PARTY.  AFTER THE CHIPS RUN OUT, IT'S A GREAT TOPPING FOR ANGEL FOOD CAKE.

I made this for a Christmas party, spent a lot of time making this, and it wasn't that good.  I snuck almost as much home as what I took to the party.

Several of my friends and family scoffed at who made it, and I was embarrassed to admit it was me.

I have reviewed this before, but felt the need to do so again... In the last two weeks I've made this for two separate gatherings... I have given out the recipe probably, 20 times since then!  It is SO good!  It is so nice and light for a summer get together...  it is just perfect!  Plus I always double the recipe since my family also loves it!  We just devour it!  I highly recommend trying it!  You'll love it too, I am sure!

I am with everyone else I would have added more stars if I could. I made it once and now it is one of my recipes that is requested when I ask "What should I bring?" I "play" with the fruits. Depending what is available. Mandrin oranges are good, pineapple (helps with the apple brownage)Most times I do not add sugar. I have found that apricot preserves is wonderful in it--it compliments all the other fruit. ALSO...it is delicious on pancakes, in crepes and over Angel Food Cake.  IMAGINE THE POSSIBILITIES!!!

I have made this recipe a few times to RAVE review every time.  I chang the type of fruit each time (depending upon what I could find).  I am always sure to add the chopped apples (for texture) and strawberries (for flavor) but the rest is what ever!!!  Fresh or canned mango also adds an interesting twist. I added approx 1/4 cup Smucker's Strawberry Syrup and thought that added a twist also.  The chips are the best, need to make more than recipe calls for.

Absolutely wonderful!  The great reviews are true.  So simple yet elegant, even.  I did a pre-party tryout last nite. Wow!  I didn't sprinkle enough sugar on chips, though.  Go ahead, be heavy handed.  There is plenty of liquid even though it doesn't seem like there will be at first.  So, don't overdo the "sauce."  I kept the sugar stictly according to the recipe and while we liked it that way, you could certainly cut it.  It tasted excellent just a half hour later and I used out of season strawberries, kiwi, granny smiths, and frozen peaches with peach preserves.  It is at its prettiest the same day but still looks and tastes really good the next.  I also tried making some chips in baby muffin cups to get the scoop effect but they were more of a hassle than worth it.  I say eat over a napkin, or scoop a bit onto a cocktail plate and enjoy!

This recipie was raved by my mother, so I tried it for a holiday party and really enjoyed it.  I even got a few requests for the recipie.  I tried out an earlier suggestion and used a muffin pan to make the edges curve up a little.  This made it so easy to hold the salsa on them.

Thank you!!!

These reviews were very helpful.  I cut the sugars in half and used sweet-in-low instead of white sugar.  I also used “scoopable” tortilla chips.  Which worked out great and was a lot faster to prepare.  What a great appetizer!

Everyone LOVED the cinnamon chips, the fruit salsa was also good, but I had plenty
of that left.  People were eating the chips alone.  A little too much sugar in the fruit salsa.
Next time I will definitley cut the sugar in half.

I expected it to be good, but I never dreamed it would be as good as it was. My 4-year-old daughter and I had a great time making it and I can see myself bringing it to a lot of potlucks and get-togethers.  Excellent recipe!

This recipe is extremely versatile and you can't go wrong even if you modify it. I cut my fruit very small for this recipe and I think that's a key component to enjoy it. It's easier to "scoop" onto pita chips. I use pretty much any fruit I have in the house and I've made it with as few as three different fruits but no more than five different fruits. I've used cantaloupe (that's a must for me in this recipe), strawberries, and different kinds of apples. You absolutely must try it.

Great appetizer for a warm summer evening.  Skipped the preserves (was sweet enough without them).  Used Jazz apples instead of Golden Delicious, and added 1/4 tsp of lemon juice to keep the apples from turning brown.  Stacy's Cinnamon Sugar Pita Chips instead of the tortilla chips.  YUM

Amazing!  And you can use whatever fruit combination you want for the salsa.  My preference is apples, bananas, kiwi, and strawberries with a little grape jelly mixed in.  The chips and salsa are always a huge hit!

I read many reviews to anticipate what others felt was problematic before trying the recipe. What stood out in the reviews is that not one (that I read, because I certainly didn't read thousands!) mentioned using FRUIT FRESH to keep the fruits from browning!! I've used it for over 25 years to keep (especially) apples from browning! You don't need much and it's fool-proof! It had to be for ME to get it right!

This was the first recipe I ever got from this website and ever since then I have been hooked.  This recipe is a summer staple in our house.  Since I am now gluten free, I have even figured out how to make gluten free flour tortillas and I then make them into the cinnamon chips and it is just as fantastic.  My daughter often asks me to bring this recipe to functions that we attend also.

A huge hit every time!  If short on time, you can also use the cinnamon sugar pita chips sold in the grocery store rather than the tortilla.

I used white fleshed nectarines instead of apples for a memorial day picnic (I thought it was more summery than an apple, which I associate with fall) and I also didn't add a lick of suger, just a teaspoon of homemade raspberry preserves and the result was fantastic! For the chips I used a homemade spiced sugar that had vanilla sugar (made by storing a vanilla bean in a small container of sugar), cardamom, cinnamon and nutmeg. Although regular cinnamon sugar would have been fine, I had this on hand so I used it. So amazing that even though I made loads, they were gone before the salsa was!

I made this for a BBQ and with all the rave reviews I was expecting to be blown away. This was pretty good. Definitely worth trying, but I may not make this again. I prefer regular fruit with a cream cheese fruit dip over this.

Excellent, even in the dead of winter (when the fruit is not really good)!  I used raspberry preserves, and threw in the 1/2 c. or so of blueberries that I needed to use.  I tried the healthy route and selected whole wheat tortillas, but they turned out a little tough.  Next time, I will use the white tortillas.  This was a perfect nosh for Christmas Night, bright, fresh, light, a little sumpin-sumpin after the earlier feasting.  Thanks for the recipe!

This turned out great! I needed something for a work Halloween potluck. I used this, omitted the raspberries used a bag of frozen peaches and I omitted the added sugars.  I also used orange marmalade - great taste like a small hint of orange, not overpowering.  It was a hit with the cinnamon tortilla chips! I didn't have any butter cooking spray, only vegetable - didn't chance it. I melted Country Crock in the microwave, used the bbq brush and brushed the tortillas w/ melted country crock first. Then, I cut them in fours w/ pizza cutter. I used 1 cup of sugar/ 1 1/2 tbs cinnamon. - PERFECTION!!! No one in the office has ever tasted anything so delicious. There was none left, everyone was taking some home.

This recipe always gets rave reviews no matter where I take it. I do not change the recipe in any way.  Wonderful just the way it is! :)

So, so good! I'm allergic to raspberries so i substitute with peaches. Orange marmalade is a must! Always a hit in the summer.

I made this for a potluck with half the white sugar amount per reviews.  Eh.  It was the prettiest appetizer there, so presentation was nice.  Just wasn't a hit at all.  I didn't like it much either.

This has became one of our favorite snack recipe. I read the reviews under the most helpful and they are also great advise. I use orange marmalade but today I will try the apricot. It lasts a while in the refrigerator and the tortilas keep nicely in a zip lock bag. We like because we use less sugar than recommended so we feel good eating it because it is also healthy. A good way to eat our daily recommended fruit! I also use cinnamon only on one side and no sugar because the fruit is already so sweet. Enjoy it!

WOW, I brought this to a family reunion and it was a hit. I agree that this needs to look like salsa and not a fruit salad. My Cuisinart on pulse did really well. I did add whole blueberries at serving time. I used strawberries, raspberries,grannie smith apples,nectarines, apricot pineapple preserve and half of the sugar. The chips must be used with this. They are delicious.

I didn't add any extra sugar to the salsa and found it to still be delicious! I had also never made tortilla chips before and found that i had to cook them much longer (12-15 minutes) than the recipe stated-- until they turned golden brown. Otherwise they became very tough and chewy (though still delicious) instead of crunchy.

I had my doubts but this was a huge hit at a progressive dinner. Some people wanted to take some home to serve with grilled chicken. I haven't tried that yet but sounds wonderful. Definately a keeper!!

A terrific recipe! Ripe fruit doesn't need any sugar so I omitted both white and brown sugars - and you need to watch the oven or the crisps will be too brown -7 minutes does it in a convection oven. I doubled the number of tortillas and still had left over fruit.

Super tasty recipe! Was looking for something different for July 4th weekend festivities. Thanks for all of the very helpful reviews.
To Betsyj: I made my tortilla chips (double batch after reading earlier reviews) a couple days ahead and put in zip lock bags. I have heard that Trader Joes carries those chips too. Our local Target didn't have them either so that's why decided to make them ahead.

Yummy!  My daughter has always made this and I am bringing it to two parties this weekend.  The tortilla chips used to be available at our local Target but they no longer carry them.  It took two hours + to make enough chips for two batches of salsa.
Does anyone know where they can be bought or ordered?  Without the labor intensity of the chips, it's a piece of cake or should I say a bowl of salsa!

Excellent recipe!!! For the chips I sprayed both sides with I Cant Believe It's Not Butter spray, and cut a few at a time with a pizza cutter. I then put the cinnamon sugar mixture in a ziplock bag and shook the chips until coated. I cooked them in the oven for 8 minutes... delicious! My house smells so yummy too :)

I thought this was a tasty salsa - I think next time I'll leave out the sugar. If the fruit is ripe, the salsa will be sweet enough using just the preserves.

I made this for my ladies small group.  I used my Grandmothers homemade rhubarb jam. (She is in her 90's and still makes jam) Everyone loved it.  I plan to make it again on Tuesday for a BBQ.  Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

Our grocery store was out of strawberries, so I used peaches for the fruit salsa. It was a very quick and easy recipe and tasted AMAZING!!! There were no leftovers at the end of the day. :)

Great recipe. Whole family loved it especially my four year old.  One tip to those who are worried about brown apple slices, Squeeze some lemon juice on them. It doesn't affect the taste and keeps them from browning for a few hours.  You can also dunk them in some salt water solution, this also works well and lasts longer than the lemon juice.

I have made this recipe before, but I do not like apples and my husband does not like raspberries. I use strawberries, kiwi, a can of crushed pineapple, and a couple of clementine oranges. I also use honey instead of sugar. This makes a great alternative to the fruits in the original recipe above. I have also added chopped grapes, which tastes good, but is not as attractive of a presentation!

WONDERFUL RECIPE!   I use a Chop Wizard found in "As seen on TV" aisles & stores.  Saves much chopping time especially if you're doubling the recipe.  I've tried many of the suggested variations...all good!  Knock yourself out with creativity!

I haven't made this yet but have eaten something similar and it was amazing! One question though: I am allergic to apples, pears, peaches, nectarines, and pretty much anything with that texture. I've never tried a mango, but I was wondering if I'm not allergic to them would they be a good substitute for the apple?

Love this, and so easy to customize. I used pears -instead of apples. And I used fresh strawberry-rhubarb jam and skipped the sugar altogether. Still naturally sweet and healthy! Great in the Summer, but colorful for Holidays as well!!

Everyone LOVED this! I used apricot preserves and only 1 T of sugar. I chopped everything (except the apples) the night before and tossed each one in its own container and put them in the fridge. The next day I tossed everything together with the preserves and apples. I added a handful of blueberries. The chips were a hit but i really liked it on graham grackers. Great for summer parties!

Delicious!  I used apples, strawberries, and blackberries, finely chopped in a food processor.  Somehow I don't think that kiwi would create a very pretty color when blended with the red fruits in this recipe... I also used Maman's 4-fruit preserves and brushed melted butter on the tortilla pieces vs. using spray.  Everyone loved it.

Refreshingly delightful!  I made this subbing watermelon for the raspberries since the berries in my store weren't all that!  Kids loved it and DH finished it.  Win-win.  I look forward to doing this again in the hot summer days ahead.  Thank you!!

I made this for a party we went to and everyone loved it.  I added blueberries and mango - though the mango was a little much for my wife's taste - it turned out great.  The cinnamon chips were a big hit too.  My wife made it again the next day without the added sugar and it still was good.

Delicious recipe..I modified it a little bit, didn't use apples, instead used half mango, blueberries and blackberries and added a little salt too. I served it with Honey Maid low fat Grahams and it was excellent combo. Moreover I saved a little bit to make a sundae with mango ice-cream and it was yummmy..also added crushed Grahams to it...

Great recipe especially for a hot summer day! Learned my lesson though to only make the tortilla chips that are going to be eaten because they do not save.

Well I thought these were great! The husband thought it was just okay, the fruit was too sweet for him. Most of our children enjoyed the chips, some didn't. But overall I thought it was great!! The chips take some time, but it was relaxing and I just threw a bunch in a plastic baggy and shook away!

This recipe is so delicious!  Anytime there is a holiday or family gathering I always love to make this.  

It always makes plenty to go around and the cinnamon chips are fantastic with it.

this is SO good!  I had this at a friend's house, and my husband nearly ate the whole thing there.  I was so excited when I saw this here!  I've made this a few times now, and everyone who has tried it LOVES it!  It is fool-proof.  My husband would love it if I had this available every day! Thank you!

This was a total hit!! I modified it a little, I used kiwi, granny smith apples, strawberries, raspberries, blueberries, and frozen no sugar added peaches. I also didn't use the brown sugar, and used orange marmalade. It was WONDERFUL!!! This summer I will make a big batch with fresh, local fruit and freeze it.

I used a pizza cutter to cut the tortillas into 6 pieces, and sprayed with butter pam, sprinkled with cinnamon sugar, then sprayed again. The chips were perfect! I love them on their own. They are great even with just one side with the butter/cinnamon sugar

I made this version only I used sugar-free strawberry preserves and completely eliminated the brown & white sugars for several of my game night gals who are diabetic.  Just eliminate the sugar on the tortillas as well and brush with cinnamon & splenda.  It was definitely a hit with them as well as all 4 of my kiddos.

After only 1 bite, my kids asked, "Can you make this again?"  Oh, yeah...definitely!  Yum.  They filled up on it before dinner, but it's only fruit so it wasn't a big deal.

This was really good and I am so glad I made extra chips! They turned out really well and I substituted blueberries into the recipe and only used one apple and one kiwi. It seems like you can do almost anything and it will turn out deliciously!

I didn't use the sugars, or the raspberries. I cut the recipe in half, but still used two kiwis (because we LOVE them) Used raspberry jam for the preserves, so I couldn't really complain about the color, because it was already pink, and it was my fault! For the chips, I used regular (vegetable oil) cooking spray, and I felt that they were delicious. I made this for our valentine's dinner, so I cut four of the tortillas into wedges, and two into hearts (using a metal cookie cutter). Delicious!

Delicious!!  I changed the recipe a little though.  The fruit I used was strawberries, raspberries, blueberries and apples. I didnt add any sugar, white or brown. The fruit made it sweet enough. The I used strawberry all fruit spread. Very yummy, will make it again!!

This was AWESOME! I made it just as directed using apricot pinapple preserves. First made the tortilla chips kind of big, but per someone elses suggestion I finished off making them small and they were better that way, kind of bite size.

This was AWESOME. I made it as an after school snack for my 3- and 5- year olds and they couldn't get enough. I used strawberry preserves and it was delish. I had some friends come over the next day and they finished it off! Definitely a hit. I will be making this again!

Yummy!  The kids in particular loved this recipe!  I took the advice of some others with the cinnamon chips.. sprayed the tortillas with pam, cut them up, and then put them in a bag with cinnamon sugar and mixed them up that way.  They turned out really delicious!  For the fruit salsa, I changed it up a little bit.  I used apples, plums, grapes cut in half, frozen peaches and strawberries.  Delicious recipe and will make again!

Excellent!  I agree with others - no need to add any sugar (white or brown).  I didn't add any preserves either.

This should definitely not be one of the top rated recipes on here...I don't get it, but maybe I did something wrong? I just don't get what the big deal is. Brought this to a 4th of July Cookout and nobody touched the salsa...It does go great on waffles though..but thats not worth all the chopping. Will not be making this again

I always like to make the recipe the way it appears first just to see how it tastes and then go from there.  I made it exactly as written and I agree that it is much too sweet.  Next time I will halve the preserves, half the brown sugar and not add any white sugar.  I will also halve the sugar in the cinnamon and sugar for on the chips as this added to the sweetness as well.  All in all, it is a refreshing idea and I will make it again with less sweetness.  Thanks.

This is actually like 4 1/2 stars (followed the recipe exactly)... the only hints that I have to give are 1) make the chips the same day of the event - my got a little chewy the next day.  2) It makes A LOT of "salsa" - have a big group or be prepared for leftovers.  3) The salsa tends to get juicy over time - if you don't care for juice you'll need to drain it off.

I made this for a superbowl party.  I am pregnant and craving fruit and thought there probably wouldn't be any at a superbowl party so I made this more for myself than the guests. I also made spinach dip in hawaiian bread. This was such a huge success that I barely ate any. Matter of fact, it was the first thing eaten completely even though we had 7 dips, 3 main dishes, and lots of desert. I was the only one without leftovers and I doubled the recipe!

Here are my tips for making this dish. I cut up all the fruit and placed them in a colander to drain while cutting. The apples I placed in a ziploc bag with a squeeze of lemon juice and less than a tsp. of sugar to keep them from browning. I used orange marmalade and only 1 tbsp. of white sugar and 1 tbsp of brown. It was sweet enough and you could really taste the fruit. The fruit I used was fresh pineapple, granny smith and red delicious apples, strawberries, kiwi, and nectarines. Well worth the energy and time spent cutting fruit.

I was expecting a lot more from this. Took it to a get together and brought half home with me. It'd be a three-star rating but the flour tortilla chips were tasty. Will make chips again, won't bother with the fruit salsa.

I make this all the time - everyone asks for it.  I chop my fruit very fine and mix it together and then let it strain for at least an hour or the salsa is juicy.  I occasionaly add a finely minced jalapeno pepper for a sweet and hot contrast.  We usually use butter spray and spray a staff at a time of tortillas.  Cut the up into wedges with a pizza cutter and then shake them in a Ziploc bag with the cinnamon sugar, then we bake them in a muffin or a mini-muffin tin to create a "Scoop" chip.  I like them crispy so I cook mine longer too.  Love these!

It is amazing how all these simple ingredients create such an impressive dish. Use whatever fruits that are in season. I am in Hawaii so I used pineapple, mango, strawberries & 1 spoon apricot prserves. I OMITED both sugars- they are not needed, any more sweetness would have been overpowering. Fantastic party dish. Both kids & adults loved it. Will make over and over!

I too added some mango and used raspberry preserves.  This recipe was absolutely amazing!  I made it for a work luncheon and everyone just couldn't get enough.  I can actually taste it just thinking about it right now.  Amazing!

Yum, Yum, Yum....I had a problem with the Cinnamon Chips but they were still good. I also could not find any fresh raspberries so I started to use frozen and then opted not to even add them. I turned out great. I served this to my family and they were super impressed. (as im not usually one to make a new recipe that was such a hit) I used stawberry preserve and I think next time I will try bannana's in it also. Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe!

Guess I'll add my 5 stars to the other 1,400 reviews.  This was scruptious!  I took it to a card party and several of the ladies asked me for the recipe.  I used Splenda instead of sugar for the cinnamon sugar, and whole wheat tortillas to make the chips.  I also used Splenda in the salsa, and added mangos.  DH tried a taste before I left for the party, and I had to pry the bowl out of his hands.  Great recipe!

Yum!  This recipe is a keeper!  Some of the other reviewers stated how they added other fruits, but I think Annie hit it right on with the combination of strawberries, raspberries, kiwi, and apples.  I used strawberry preserves with this because it is what I had, but instead of the sugars I added about 2 tablespoons of honey and the juice of a lemon.  The cinnamon chips turned out great!  Delicious recipe, Annie!

Terrific!  1300+ reviewers can't be wrong.  A forgiving recipe - just use what fruit you have since I don't think you can mess this up.  It does get soupy - doesn't the sugar bring out the juice in the strawberries?  For that reason I drained the salsa before serving, but it still made MORE juice while it was in the serving bowl.  Next time I'll try omitting the sugar and just using the preserves.  Also used bagged Cinnamon Sugar pita chips from Trader Joe's which were yummy and saved lots of time.  UPDATE:  I had a package of whole wheat flour tortillas to use up so I tried them for the chips.  I was able to mix 1/2 white sugar with 2 1/2 T cinnamon which made plenty of cinnamon sugar mix to generously cover eight 8" tortillas.  An easy enough project that my 3 yr old was able to "help" and the chips turned out pretty good too.

I was worried that the apple would turn brown if this was made in advance of the party, but that is not a problem. The sugar and preserves coat the apple so it stays white and crisp. I added a tablespooon of amaretto for an adult party and that was a nice twist. Also used Stacy's cinnamon pita chips, less work and very good.

If I could give this 10 stars, I would!  This is an original, tasty, and refreshing summer recipe that has everyone flipping out!  I have taken it to numerous barbecues, picnics, and other parties and have watched it disappear.  A co-worker of mine ate about 8 servings of it one afternoon...it's THAT good.  It is worth it to take the time to make the cinnamon chips...they actually stay fresh for quite awhile in an airtight container, so you could make a large batch for multiple occasions.  Make sure you buy thin tortillas (Pinata brand in the refrigerated case are my favorite) so the chips are nice and crispy.  Dicing all the fruit to about the same size is also worth the extra time...it makes it easier to eat.

No one seemed interested in eating the salsa which was disappointing because it was time consuming to dice the fruit.

The cinnamon chips, however, were a hit and I will make those again.  They were very easy.  I sprayed each tortilla, cut them in triangles and threw them in a huge lidded container with the cinnamon sugar.  With a couple of shakes, the triangles were coated with the mixture.

I received TONS of compliments on this.  Made chips the night before to save time, I didn't have the spray butter so I just spread it on each tortilla with a knife.  To avoid my salsa turning mushy, I did not add 
raspberries, instead just had diced apple, pineapple, kiwi, strawberries and blueberries.  Huge hit, I am SO making this again.

I have been making this fruit salsa for a couple of years now.  The only difference is that I always switch up the types of fruit.  I made it last week for a work pot-luck lunch and used 1 red apple, 1 anjou pear, 1 mango, 1 pineapple and some strawberries.  I never add any sugar (it's sweet enough!) and instead use a couple spoons of homemade jam (preferably rhubarb or strawberry) mixed with a bit of lemon juice for a kick.  As for the chips, I spray the tortillas with butter spray, top and bottom, cut them into triangles and place them on a cookie sheet.  Then I sprinkle them with the cinnamon/sugar mixture and pop them in the 350 oven.  I don't know for how long, maybe 10 mins, I just keep an eye on them so they don't burn.  I've never had anyone NOT ask me for this recipe!  It's so nice and refreshing... and most of all, it's healthy!!!

This was awesome!  Used as an appetizer, and no one could stop eating it!  I omitted the raspberries and used raspberry jam in the recipe.  Also, to save a little time, I purchased tortilla chips, sprayed them with just a LITTLE margarine, sprinkled them with cinnamon sugar, and popped them in the oven for a couple of minutes. Fantastic!!!

Wonderful!  This can pretty much be made with whatever fruit you have on hand.  Everyone loved it, especially the chips.

Very good recipe that allows the room to experiment with your favorite fruits in addition to the fruits called for.  I added banana and after chopping the banana and apples added the juice from one lemon before preparing the rest of the fruit.  The leftovers were awesome blended with ice for a smoothie.  My 1-year old loved the chips and I will likely make them without the salsa often.

I LOVE this stuff!  The great thing about this recipe is that you can customize it to your preferences.  I omitted raspberries but added crushed pineapple.  I've also used splenda in place of the sugar and it turns out fine.

This was absolutely fabulous! I took it as a healthy appetizer to a Christmas Party and everyone loved it. The only thing I'd mention is that it's best fresh (unless you really like it soft). After too long in the fridge, the sugar broke down the fruit a bit too much and it wasn't as crisp.

I just made the chips but I plan on making the salsa later.  I thought it was great, make sure to use parchment paper when cooking the tortillas and instead of sprinking the sugar on I spread it in a pie pan and 'dip' the whole tortilla in and then I slice it all.

Oh Yum!!  I couldn't find any good strawberries so I used mango instead.  Made it with apricot jam and used Trader Joe's cinnamon chips (for the sake of time) and it was excellent.  Great appetizer in place of chips and salsa.

I know you don't need another review on this recipe, but I have to say how awesome these are! I follow all the amounts exactly, but substitute pineapple (canned)instead of raspberries and use pineapple preserves.I brush one side of the tortillas with butter instead of the spray,and use 1/3 c. sugar to 2tsp. cinnamon for the cinnamon sugar mix. AWESOME!

This is such a fantastic treat and something different! First batch we made with 2 kiwi, 1 peach, raspberries, a granny smith and a 'grapple' (it's an apple, but smells & tastes like a white grape!) & cherry preserves. Second batch was with rasperries, strawberries, 1/2 a fugi and 1/2 a granny smith, 2 kiwi and 1 peach. You never have to have the same taste twice unless you want and it's fun to experiment. The chips were super, as I think the 2nd spray of Pam kept the cinn./sugar on.  I wanted to take something light to a 4th of July gathering and this was a hit! Will make this a lot! Thanks for sharing!

This is so refreshing. I used frozen berry mix, fresh strawberries and apples (left out kiwi).I used one tsp. of equal and 1 Tblsp. brown sugar...it was sweet enough. I put the fruit in the food processor and pulsed for a few seconds. This chopped it up nicely and is a timesaver. I also cut the tortillas with a pizza cutter and baked in a muffin tin.

I made this for my sister's baby shower.  I had to make a bunch of extra chips becuz my mom kept eating them (even without the salsa!).  I think the strawberry preserves overwhelmed the flavor, so I will use apricot next time.  But I make the chips all the time now for my kids when they want a snack!  Super recipe!

THIS IS THE BEST RECIPIE I HAVE EVER GOTTEN FROM THIS WEBSITE!!! I used frozen fruit, and doubled the preserves. Always make a double batch of the chips! There the first to go. If you have leftovers, this is great to put on pancakes and cheesecake! Great for get togethers!!

The fruit was good-tasted like a fruit salad.  My husband & I didn't care for the chips.  My kids (ages 3 & 4) said, "yuck" when they tried the chips.  Taste of Home had a recipe for cinnamon chips using pie crust dough- think we'd like that better.

This was a huge hit at a friend's 4th of July picnic!!  Yummy :)
I used store bought tortilla chips...gave them a light spray with cooking spray, then added the cinammon and sugar mixture, and popped in the oven at 350 degrees for a bit just to crisp them back up!!  Can't wait to make it again!!

I really liked this recipe, although it did not go over as well at my party as I had hoped for all the previous rave reviews.  The chips were definitely more popular than the salsa.  I loved them together. I did reduce the white sugar by half and the preserves by a third (using 1 T. strawberry and 1 T. apricot). I also added mango and blueberries, which were really good.  I would not leave out the apple as it adds a little crunchiness to the salsa. The chips were very time consuming to make, but very tasty. I will try it again, but with a different group of people. Thanks for sharing your recipe.

I served this at a Longaberger basket party and it didn't go over too well.  The fruit was mushy and purple-looking, and most people just tasted it and didn't finish their helpings.  The chips were good the night before, fresh out of the oven; however, I stored them overnight in an airtight container, and they still tasted stale the next day.  I will probably make the chips by themselves again to serve as a snack hot out of the oven, but I won't try the fruit salsa again.

This was delicious. However, it was a pain to dice up all of the fruit. The chips were definitely more popular than the salsa, and I don't think they went very well together. Maybe some cinnamon added to the fruit mixture? Nonetheless, I really enjoyed it!

I made this for a cookout and ended up really pressed for time. Lucky for me, the salsa was prepared in less than ten minutes! I didn't have time for the chips, so served it with cinnamon graham crackers instead and it was hit. I shouldn't have worried about the chips, because my friends were eating it straight out of the bowl! Somehow I got away with a bit left over and it was delicious on waffles the next morning. Definitely a no brainer with fabulous results.

This is the absolute best!  I didn't realize however, how long it takes to make the tortilla chips - so put aside time to make them.  Also, I left out the preserves (mainly because I forgot to buy them at the market) and it was wonderful.  Everyone, adults and kids alike loved it.  Defintely make twice as many tortilla chips - they go fast.

Fantastic and easy! I made these for class awhile ago and everyone ate them up! The cinnamon chips are crunchy and sweet, a perfect mixture to put with the fresh fruit salsa. I have since used this many times, as it's a perfect appetizer and snack! I did follow the instructions to a Tee and continue to make bigger portions when I make it. Thanks for the recipe!

So good! I made it just yesterday for a little get together and everyone loved it and asked me for the recipe. I did not add the brown sugar as I didn't have any but it was very sweet already. Also I used wheat tortillas instead of flour and to keep my apples from browning after I diced them I squeezed some lemon juice on them. Definitely a crowd pleaser!!!

Everyone who tried this liked it.  I made the salsa as written, but did coat the chips on both sides with cinnamon and sugar and then pressed the wedges into muffin tins so they were shaped like scoops.  I used non-stick muffin tins and made sure to spray the tins really well with cooking spray and removed the chips immediately after taking them out of the oven so I had no problems with them sticking to the tins.  I made the chips the night before and they were fine the next morning.

I don't know why I waited so long to make this - it was simply wonderful.  I brushed tortillas with butter then sprinkled with cinn/sugar mix (note to self: cut smaller - I cut each tortilla into 8 pieces - they were too big.  Next time do strips).  Also could have let baked another minute or too...used fruit I had on hand (granny smith apple, strawberries, and blueberries along with strawberry jam).  So light and refreshing.  Would be great on a camping trip.

Cut out the brown sugar; didn't have butter spray so I brushed butter over the pita chips and sprayed it with coconut oil (really nice flavor!). Also didn't add any sugar to the fruit and it was sweet enough with the preserves.

I've made this a couple times and it's outstanding.  You can make a little or a lot depending on the occasion, and use almost any fruit.  Instead of using preserves, I use some lime juice to keep the apples from discoloring and honey to sweeten the mixture.  Its easier and less messy to sprinkle on the cinnamon and sugar and then cut the tortillas into wedges.  I like to do both sides!

While I enjoyed this, I wasn't as wowed as I hoped to be. My husband hates fruit, so I made a half batch of this for myself. Despite others warning to avoid adding sugar, I did anyways - and I'm glad I did. My fruit must have been super tart or else I'm a TOTAL sweet tooth because even with it (and 1 1/2 T peach preserves), my salsa wasn't sweet enough for my liking. My chips were also only mildly sweet. The real disappointment however, is that this doesn't keep well AT ALL. You really need to eat this in one sitting, which is why it's perfect for parties (but even then, this will start looking pretty dull the longer it sits). All said and done, this was fun to try but nothing to write home about (sorry!). Thanks anyways, Annie. :)

Delicious and refreshing! I used raspberries, strawberries, 1 fuji apple, frozen peaches, and 2 kiwi. I used peach preserves and skipped the sugar altogether and everyone loved it. I set it outside to keep cool and it accidentally got slushy frozen in our cold temps and I think the cold consistency made it even better!!

The fruit salsa is delicious but the cinnamon chips are not nearly what I expected. I have made the salsa many times and it is always a hit, I use store bought cinnamon pita chips now. The first time I made the salsa it was a little mushy when I made it the night before. The other times I made it I bought strawberries and kiwis that were firmer and cut them into bigger pieces so they didn't break down as much and it was perfect. The salsa definitely gets 5 stars but the chips get a 3 at most. Thanks for the great recipe!

Make this quite often for a dance I go to and everyone loves it! Now trying to figure out how to make it and bring to a get together miles away, like I'm doing a road trip to Florida from NH and would love to bring it with me to serve at a party I'm helping to plan. No worries about the berries, they just need a cooler. The chips not too sure about and not sure I can make them in a motel room even if it's a kitchenette type room. Nor do I want to transport cookie sheets. Would like to make everything in NH and have it be still crispy and delicious  at least 2 days later possibly 3, 4 or more days. Guess the most important thing is to do the oven work baking the chips in NH. Any ideas?

This is the second time I have made this, and I followed the recipe as written both times. This is always a hit, both the salsa and the chips. I also sprayed both sides of the tortillas and then sprinkled one side with cinnamon sugar and stacked them up and then cut them into wedges with a pizza cutter, in stacks of about 3 at a time. I baked them on a pizza stone and they came out nice and crispy without browning too much. I made them the night before and kept in a zip lock bag and they were still fresh and crispy the next evening. I was glad I did because I needed the time the next day to chop all the fruit small. It was well worth it, a great recipe. I used the left over fruit the next morning with blueberry pancakes, delicious. You could make this a day ahead.

I saved these in my recipe box for years, thinking surely I'd have a reason to serve them someday. I finally did for a Mexican potluck at my school when I wasn't asked to bring a main dish as I usually am. This was simple to make (I actually LOVE chopping fruit) and I cheated by buying Stacey's brand cinnamon pita chips for dipping. The bowl was scraped clean and several people asked for the recipe. Thanks for a great dish.

Huge hit!!! I made this for a Mardi Gras party as is but served it with cinnamon graham crackers - there was nothing left by the end of the afternoon.  I think next time I might add a dash of cinnamon.  Either way this is sooo yummy!

I cut the sugar in half. Used an egg slicer to cut the fruits as someone suggested. I used orange marmalade. I also sprinkled it with lemon juice to keep the apples from browning. It was delicious and addicting.

Yum! Just made this for the first time and it was delish! I followed the advice of another review and did not add sugar to the fruit. It was still very sweet! I also did not want to have to deal with apples browning so I skipped the apple and added diced fresh black plums for extra tang and peach preserves.  I used whole wheat tortillas and melted together butter, raw sugar and cinnamon. I brushed this on the tortillas before I cut and baked. Perfection! I will def make this again. Thank you!!!

FANTASTIC!  My wife and I use this as a dessert or as a snack quite often.  Every time we make it, everyone hangs out over the fruit dipping bowl.  We haven't received a single review below a "this is really good".  Be careful not to burn the chips, however.  SO DELICIOUS!

This was so good and refreshing.  I didn't make any changes really except to add a little lemon juice since I chopped the apples first, and I eyeballed the white sugar and brown sugar.

Loved this fresh treat! Next time I would do 3 things differently:
1- Like many other reviewers, use less sugar
2- Crisp the chips more
3- Substitute the raspberries for another fruit as they broke down rather quickly.

Loved this recipe!  It was so easy and was a huge hit at a Mother's Day Lunch I took it to.  I am getting ready to make another batch and wanted to leave a review of how absolutely delicious it was.  I changed up the sugar to splenda for both the white and brown sugars and used blackberry ja.  I also used graham crackers instead of the chips simply because it saves so much time!  Thanks for a great recipe!!

This was AMAZING and oh, so easy.  I ended up processing it much smaller than shown and it was just amazing.  The first time I made it I forgot both sugars and am I glad!  I can't imagine it being any sweeter.  It was just perfect with just the natural preserves.  I also added some blackberries and it was scrumptious.  I can't say enough about it!!!

This was a success! Although the photos shows large pieces, I made sure I diced it up small.  I didn't change a thing and I received rave reviews...even from my picky little eaters.  The apricot preserve was a good call.

I've had this recipe in my box for ages. What took me so long to make it?! This is fabulous! I used the fruits recommended, used an all fruit no sugar added raspberry preserves, and added no extra sugar. I did have to bake the tortillas about 3 extra minutes. I'm already thinking of another time to make this.

Really enjoyed this.  Subbed frozen blackberries for raspberries because I had them already.  Used orange marmalade.  Followed another reviewers suggestion and tried an egg slicer on both the kiwis and the strawberries.

I LOVED this!  Used apricot preserves, only 1/3 of sugar called for, added pineapple and two kinds of apple (fuji and per recipe), and used Stacey's cinnamon pita chips.  The apples didn't brown.

Great recipe! Did this for snack and my kids asked me to make some more! I'm used to checking out Everything-Cake.com, Everything-Bread.com and GourmetRecipe.com for cooking tips, information and recipes but once in a while, I check out other sources just like this time. I'm still loyal to those sites especially GourmetRecipe.com but I definitely love this recipe as my kids do. :P

This is perfect for a summer get together. The chips where kind of a pain to make though. Next time I will see if I can just buy them

I've made this several times, I don't use raspberries, I sub it with frozen peaches and add blueberries. I am not a big fan of sugar so I don't add any. I put it in the fridge and leave it sit for about an hour or more and the natural juices sweeten it enough. BUT the chip I make exactly as described. They should be called CRACK CHIPS because they are so awesome!!!  I love in Florida - where its always HOT here so its a perfect dish and I always have someone who want the recipe from me.  LOVE IT!! thanks for sharing it!!

I have been making this recipe for years and I always have people begging me to make this. I do change the recipe a bit though, I use a pound of strawberries, a mango, a pear, a red delicious apple, and 2 kiwi. I dice all of the fruit and add 2 tablespoons of white sugar and let it sit overnight. The cinnamon chips are so delicious but you have to keep an eye on them, one second they are too soft and the next second they can burn. For special occasions I cut the tortillas into shapes using cookie cutters.

Perfect for a baby shower! Everyone loved it. The "salsa" name implies a spicy fruit - but it's really more like amazing fruit salad.

Fool proof!  I have made this recipe several times for parties and it is always a smashing success.  I have done several variation of it with different fruit, preserves and I also add some fruit juice concentrate.  I try to use whole wheat tortillas for the cinnamon chips.

Time and again everyone loves this when I make it for a crowd. It never fails to be a hit. I used real butter instead of the spray - didnt taste as artificial. Make the chips ahead of time and the salsa next, it will keep longer.

I made this yesterday for a family gathering and it was outstanding! I didn't add any sugar to the fruit and I used frozen raspberries and blackberries, thawed and well drained. Be sure to double the amount of chips, they are addictive.

Big hit at my party.  Left out the white sugar, didn't need it. I didn't have time to make the cinnamon tortillas, so I served it with cinnamon graham crackers, apple-cinn mini rice cakes, and sweet potato chips.

I LOVE THIS DISH!!!!! I made a smaller batch and added too much sugar but besides that everything about it was GREAT!! The chips gave it that kick of spice. I also added fresh lemon juice which gave it that tangy bc it can get too sweet with all the fruits and added sugar. I will keep this recipe forever!!!

I have not actually tried this recipe but have done something similiar. Try just using a table spoon of vanilla instead of sugars. And cut your time in half use cinnamon pita chips from Simply Naked.

I used more fruit than called for but did not increase the sugar and it was still a little too sweet. I guess the sugar should be adjusted depending on if fruit is in season or not.  Other than that this is an excellent recipe. The chips are so good.

What a great summer dish for picnics and potlucks!  We substituted Splenda baking blends for the white and brown sugar in the salsa and on the chips to make it more diabetic friendly.  And the chips are great by themselves.

Delish!  I used peach preserves and followed a lot of the other reviews to speed up the process.  Using a pizza cutter to cut the tortillas is key.

So yummy! Unfortunately the raspberries I had bought a few days before for this recipe went bad so I improvised with black berries. They were still okay but I know that the raspberries would be 100x better. Regardless it is such an easy to make and yummy recipe. Will definitely be making this again. Thanks for sharing Ann Page!

This recipe is AMAZING! I have been using allrecipes for a few years and this is my first review. I have made this recipe on many occassions and have changed it depending on what fruit is available, what preserves I have in the fridge and no matter what, it turns out great. I have also cheated and used the bagged cin/sugar pita chips and while the homemade ones are better, they work out just as well. Great job on this recipe!!

Excellent recipe! I am late writing a review, but I made it on Super Bowl Sunday and it went over very well. The pita chips are perfect. I did add the sugar, but as others have stated, it could easily be removed from the recipe and still have a wonderfully sweet taste. I am to make this recipe again at a summertime gathering!

So great and easy to alter.  I didn't have everything on hand so I used apples, nectarines, grapes, and strawberries.  I used my homemade strawberry lemon marmalade and it was so awesome!!

A friend of mine (also an Allrecipes.com addict) made these for the same party that I made Tiffany Brennan's Hot Artichoke and Spinach Dip II for. It was amazing! She took the recommendation of making the cinnamon chips to go along with it, and the two paired very nicely. Mix it up with different jams and berries!

DELISH! Add some fresh mint to the fruit salsa for a great flavor. Loved this recipe and will definitely make it again soon!

The chips are great!

so easy to make and delicious. Its a nice change from traditional salsa or even fruit salad. The apples added a nice crisp texture into the mix.

Yummy! I left out the raspberries, sugar, and fruit preserves. I made just half the recipe and added half a mango. Not really salsa, more like fruit salad, but excellent! The tortilla chips were great. Spray and sprinkle cinnamon/sugar on both sides.

People ask me to make this all the time, it is sooooo good! Easy to make, too! However, the last time I made it I accidentally bought corn tortillas (instead of flour) and I didn't think it would make that much of a difference. Well, it did! The chips were "flimsy" and really hard to chew! So, as long as it is followed properly, this is an AMAZING recipe that people will beg you for!

There's kind of no way to mess this up. Use the freshest best fruit available (add in anything seasonal), and serve. People beg me to make this whenever I have or come to a party!

Delish, but I make make some adjustments next time around...just to suit my own personal preferences. But for a crowd, this recipe would be a hit! I added blueberries to the mix and used 2 tbsp. preserves rather than 3 tbsp. Next time I will either cut it back to 1 tbsp. or cut back the sugar/brown sugar. It was VERY sweet, but still tasty nonetheless. The chips rocked! This is a great idea for a party/get-together.

Really, Really GOOD!!!!! made it just like it says and used a food processor for the apples and strawberries. Used apricot preserves and brushed melted butter on the chips. Everyone was raving at my 4th of july party about how good it was....

This was awesome! Very simple! I found that letting the salsa sit for at least a 1/2 hour definitely improves the flavor. The chips really round out the taste, everyone loved it!

This is such a simple yet delicious recipe. It's great because you can really put together any combination of fruit. Our family favorite is apples, bananas, red grapes and strawberries. I've actually never used any fruit preserve because the juices mix well with the sugars and thicken it up nicely. For the chips, I do use real butter instead of the spray but that's just out of personal preference.

I often make a true Mexican dinner for family and friends including fried tacos, cheesy enchiladas and heavy rice so this fresh, "healthier" addition to the menu is a great hit!  Serves as a side AND a dessert.

If I could give this recipe 10 stars I would!! This is by far the best recipe I have ever tried from this site. It was very easy with my cuisinart to quickly chop the fruits. I was able to achieve a really good 'salsa' consistency by using my machine rather than cutting by hand. The chips were also AWESOME!! They were very easy to make, and I took the suggestion of using a pizza cutter and that cut the prep time quite a bit. I also used pre-bought cinnamon sugar. Super easy, super good and super impressive! Thanks so much!!!

This is so good and refreshing. I didn't have butter spray (not in Europe) so I brushed with butter on one side and then added the cinnamon/sugar. It is fairly easy too. I'm thinking a great brunch dish.

Excellent!! I made this for a church pot luck and it got rave reviews. Only changes i made was i used Granny Smith apples(it's what i had and needed to be used up). Also i ran out of time and fried my tortillas instead of baked them. Will be making this again soon!!

BEST RECIPE!! I have made this MANY times. It is always a hit with adults and kids alike. My son had taken this to school for his birthday snack for the last 2 years because he loves it. I don't use all of the sugar. I stack the tortillas as I season them. Then I cut about 5 of them with the pizza cutter all at once. Make sure you cook the tortillas long enough or they will be hard rather than crispy. Use a chopper.... makes it go much faster. I get people asking for this  recipe all of the time! Enjoy!!

I took this to a baby shower and it was a hit! I followed some of the recommendations of other reviewers and tweaked the recipe slightly. I sprayed my tortillas on both sides, cut them into wedges with a pizza cutter. In a gallon size zip lock bag I mixed 2 c. sugar to 2 t. cinnamon. I dropped the tortilla wedges into the bag gave the bag a few good shakes to coat each wedge. I baked them in the oven for about 10 minutes. For the fruit salsa, I cut up strawberries, raspberries, kiwis, mango, pineapple, and fuji apples. I omitted the sugar and instead added 2 T. of peach preserves which made it plenty sweet and didn't make too much liquid. A very good recipe!

This sounds like a great recipe so I am making it this weekend! I noticed alot of people are having trouble with apples browning so I will offer a hint. If you soak the apples after cutting them up in pineapple juice they wont brown! It has something to do with the acidity. Plus you can add the pineapples to the salsa!

I read many reviews before making this, and it helped me a lot. I skipped the sugar, added both apricot and strawberry jam to taste, you really don't need much. I used fiji apples, adding them last as I had read, and they didn't turn brown at all. I used 4 kiwis and a frozen mixture of strawberry/peach/mango I bought and chopped. As I was taking it to an adult only party, I poured a couple of tablespoons of blackberry liquor over it... YUMMY!!! Got many raves!!  I made the chips the day before, and kept in an airtight container, they were crisp and yummy. To cut down on time, I found the easiest way to make them was to put one tortilla on the counter and spray with butter flavor and then shake on some cinnamon sugar, then lightly spray and place the next right on top, rotate it a little to get the extra sugar from the bottom one and repeat until you have 6. Then cut with pizza cutter in 8ths and bake on cookie sheets for 12 min (or until you see the edges start to brown slightly). Don't take them out too early or they will be tough and taste stale. I mixed plain and WW tortillas. It was well worth the effort, as it was a star amongst the usual deep fried party fare, and esp at new years when everyone is on the verge of their resolutions, my fruit salsa was all gone and the fattening stuff was left over!! If you are wondering whether to try this recipe, go for it, it is very forgiving, you can customize it to suit you and everyone will love it! Enjoy and THANKS Annie!

This was super awesome. I used blueberries, apples, strawberries and kiwi and apricot jam. I did not add any sugar and it was plenty juicy and sweet. I made the chips, which took a very long time. It should be said that Stacy's chips are pretty expensive; however, if you're not making this for a large group buy the chips! However, the amount of chips you need to go with the amount of salsa is pretty large. My husband also decided that the chips were awesome with hot fudge and vanilla ice cream (sort of like a sopapilla a la mode!).

I have been making this for quite a while now.  I thought I should add to the frenzy of this recipe.  This is probably one of the BEST recipes on this site, or perhaps the best recipe that I keep in the hopper.  Everyone in my whole family LOVES it, and when I bring it to the masses, it gets RAVE reviews.  Instead of making the pita chips, I buy Stacy's cin. sugar.  This is also awesome on vanilla yogurt, on cereal or even alone!

Okay this is one of those recipes that, even if you change the ingredients, remains phenomenal. I used peaches instead of apples and added blueberries and still everybody was crazy about it.  The other reviewers are right, though, the sugar is not needed.

Outstanding!  I took the suggestions and used Fuji apples. The second time I made it, I tried omitting the sugar.  Depending on how sweet you like things, you may want to keep it in.  I like it better with the sugar.  This is now a staple for parties!

This is a great recipe and receieved rave reviews from my guests as well as requests for the recipe! Following previous review comments, I used a mango instead of kiwis and coated the cinnamon chips by shaking in a bag of cinnamon sugar after spraying with cooking spray. I didn't see a need to re-spray after coating either.

This recipe is so awesome and something different to take to a party.  I sprayed each side of the tortilla with the cooking spray, then placed the tortilla in a large dish that contained the cinnamon/sugar mixture.  I just shook the tortilla back and forth, and when both sides were coated, I stacked three sugared tortillas on top of one another and used a pizza cutter to cut into 6 pieces.  I found this way to save a lot of time and mess.

This was almost too good :) Everyone loved this. I made the salsa as stated, but used the spray-cut-shake method with the chips (shaking them in a baggie with the cinnamon sugar) and it was great. Thanks!

This is a good recipe.  For the salsa, I just chopped up fruit and added NOTHING else (strawberry, kiwi, canteloupe, gala apple, & fresh pineapple)--wonderful!! For the chips, brush one side of a tortilla with soft butter & sprinkle with sugar/cinnamon.  Then cut and bake til lightly crisp.  Don't overbake.  This step was timeconsuming.  Don't make them too far in advance, b/c they get stale.

So delicious and simple to make.  I only used about 1 T sugar in the salsa and it was just sweet enough.  For the chips, I just sprayed both sides of the tortilla, used a pizza cutter to cut into slices and placed in a ziploc bag to shake and coat with the cinnamon/sugar. So simple to make! Next time I might only coat one side of the tortilla with sugar because I found the chips to be a little too sweet

This has become the dish my family always asks me to make for gatherings!  I make the fruit a little more healthy by using splenda and sugar-free preserves for my diabetic father.  A quick tips for the chips though - I spray both sides with cooking spray, then toss them into a large ziplock bag with the cinnamon and sugar mixture.  Quick way to get the sugary goodness on both sides!

Oh my, what a delicious snack or dessert! As others did, i sprayed both sides of the tortillas, cut into wedges and placed in a gallon ziploc containing the cinnamon sugar mixture. Omitted the sugars and used cherry preserves. Fast, easy and fantastic!

I hate to rate a recipe if I've altered it, but this one deserved a 5 no matter what I managed to do to it.  I threw in every fruit I had in the fridge including apples, blackberries, cantaloupe, pineapple, grapes and strawberries.  I used Splenda instead of sugar in the fruit and apricot marmalade.  I also added 1/2 of a jalapeno and a pinch of Jamaican Allspice.  It must have turned out OK because it won 1st place in a competition.  Thanks for the recipe!

Loved this recipe, as it is so versatile.  I made it for a birthday party and it was a hit!  I used store-bought cinnamon pita chips and used frozen raspberries as well as added cantaloupe.  For lunch the next day, II added the leftover salsa to plain yogurt and it was delicious!

This was so amazing, and I found that you can make it with many combinations of fruits.  Rome apples, peaches, and blueberries is the combination I've found to be most popular.  Also, after a little experimentation, I use all brown sugar and vanilla instead of jelly.  Yum yum!

I followed the recipe exactly and used apricot preserves, as recommended by another reviewer.  This was perfect and I wouldn't change a thing! All of my friends loved it and have asked for the recipe.  So simple to make and delicious.  To simplify and neaten the chip making, I poured the cinnamon sugar in a 9x12 baking dish. I sprayed the tortilla, cut in half then pressed each half into the sugar.  I then cut the coated, half-tortilla into wedges with a pizza cutter.  Very quick and neat.

Delicious! Omitted using the extra sugar in the fruit salsa as suggested by other reviewers, and this was still very sweet. Used Frozen strawberries and raspberries, as they are not in season and so expensive fresh. This was excellent.

Wonderful!  I received many compliments.  I was happy to use up the many blackberries from my bush.  The cinnmon chips were great too.  Hint: the flour works better than the whole wheat flour tortillas.

This was very similar to the Pampered Chef's recipe for fruit salsa, but it was very good as well. The tortilla chips may seem like they are NOT done, but they set up very crispy. Do not overcook tortillas!

This was excellent. I took it as an appetizer to a bridal shower and everyone loved it. Out of the 6 girls in attendance, 3 told me that they've made it already. The main drawback was cutting up the fruit into such small pieces was very time consuming. Making the cinnamon tortillas wasn't too bad though. I used Parkay Spray Butter and they turned out just right. Having warm, fresh chips was a real treat. I'd definitely make these again for a special occasion.

OMG! Soooooooooo Good!
This is delicious and perfect as is.
Great to take to a party! 
I did cut the tortillas with a pizza wheel and dunk them in a ziplock with cinnamon sugar. Yum. I am going to make this regularly.

I followed another person's suggestion and used a plastic bag to shake the chips in the cinnamon and sugar which allows you to enjoy cinnamon on both sides. I found that cooking time took about three minutes longer in order to make them crispy due to the additional cinnamon sugar...but it was well worth it.  I followed someone's suggestion and used Fuji apples to avoid browning.  I took the additional precaution of cutting up the apples last and shaking them in a plastic bag with sweetened lime juice before adding them to the salsa.  This worked very well.  I used Boysenberry preserves in the salsa.  The recipe turned out to be delicious.  I am so glad that there were so many reviews because from the title, I do not think I would have tried it.  But it is amazing!

Always a big hit at parties.  So good and everyone loves it and asks for the recipe.  If I were to change anything, it would be to add less sugar than called for.  I like the natural sweetness!~

Excellent. Finely chopped strawberry, raspberry, peach and apple and used strawberry preserves. To make clean up easier when making the cinnamon chips place a piece of wax paper over the cutting board because the butter flavored spray is messy. Spray one side of the tortilla and sprinkle with cinnamon and sugar then do the other side. I stacked up three and cut with a large knife. Really easy. Chips were a big hit. Thanks for the recipe.

This gets 3 stars for the fruit salsa. The chips get -2! They weren't crispy after baking for 10 minutes so I turned & baked them another 5 minutes. After cooling, I thought they were reasonably crispy so went ahead and took them to a neighbor's 4th of July party - no one touched them! I recommend making the salsa and buying the chips.

I've made this recipe a couple of times and what is so wonderful is how many variations you can make. Each time I used a completely different selection of fruits and both times it was delicious. Everyone goes crazy over it and wants to learn how to make it themselves. The chips are so addicting, even when the salsa is all gone they are great by themselves. This last time I made it I used 4 apricots, 1 fuji apple, 1 asian pear, 1 nectarine, 6 mini bananas (about 2 small bananas), 1 pound strawberries, and 8 oz raspberries. Use whatever is in season. Wonderful! Please make this!!

This recipe is delicious.  My entire family loves it and it's become my signature dish for family gatherings.  I use Granny Smith apples and replace the raspberries with blueberries. But I've tried it with other things, and it's always good. 

The only big change I make is to bake the tortillas for much longer than recommended to make them crispy.  I usually sprinkle one side with the cinnammon/sugar and bake for 8-10 minutes.  Then I flip them over, sprinkle the other side and bake them for another 10-12 minutes.  Otherwise, they come out a little rubbery.  

But overall, still delicious!

I made a modified version of this recipe last night in under 30 minutes. It was a total hit with absolutely none left. 

For the salsa, I used 1 banana, 1 cup of chopped strawberries, 1 kiwi, 1/3 (or about 1/2 to 3/4 cup) of a Braeburn apple, & 1/2 cup chopped blueberries. I drizzled honey over top and mixed thoroughly.

For the chips, I took 3 medium sized flour tortillas and cut them with pizza cutter into 8 triangles each. I used 1/2 stick of melted unsalted butter and dredged the pieces into the butter then into the sugar-cinnamon mix. Baked for about 12 minutes and slid them off the cookie sheet into a bowl. 

I literally served these within 15 minutes of making it and everyone loved them! Will make again and again.

OMG this recipe was wonderful. I used only 1TB sugar & 1TB brown sugar. I also used frozen mixed berries as the berries are not yet in season. FAMILY LOVED THIS. My son ate some over vanilla ice cream.

Not that this recipe needs another 5 stars... but I get asked to make this one all the time.

I never add the additional sugar though. You just have to figure that fruit and jam are just so sweet by themselves.... not to mention that the chips are loaded with it also!

I made this as a snack for a weekly Bible study group and was told it was the best snack the group has ever been served!  As warned by reviewers, I eliminated the sugar and preserves and found they weren't needed - the sweetness was just right without it!  I also chopped the apples last and soaked them briefly in lemon juice and water before adding.  The chips, although good, were perhaps more work and mess than they were worth, so while I plan to make the salsa again, I will likely use store-bought cinnamon chips.

I've made this a couple times, now. It's a HUGE hit for groups!! I just use whatever berries are on sale along with mangoes, apples & kiwi. The best tip I can give is I've found the chips are better (crispier, not "bendy") when they're day-old. Mmmm, delicious.

This was just ok for me.  I followed the recipe exactly.  With some tweaking I think it'll be better.  Next time I'll omit the sugar in the salsa.  I'll buy the chips at the store, the homemade ones just weren't crispy enough.  They were crispy coming out of the oven but chewy when eating them.

Excellent recipe.  I used Granny Smith apples and added diced fresh pineapple (this also counters the browning with apples), omitted the lemon juice and sugars(sugar will draw out the fruit's natural juice and make the salsa go runny and soft, alot faster).  I did add 2T apple jelly for some added sweetness. I also lightly brushed low fat tortillas with butter, instead of using 'butter' spray.

This was awesome, everyone at my church community group loved it. I doubled it, except the apples (used 3 not 4) and didn't double the white/brown sugar, only used as much as the original recipe called for. I followed another user's suggestion and used frozen peaches instead of raspberries, loved that b/c I don't like a lot of seeds. To coat the chips w/ the cinnamon sugar, I found the ziplock bag'n'shake method worked best, it coated the perfect amt on each chip. I don't yet have a "good" food processor that chops/dices, so this took me about 4 hours total, and the tortillas took the longest to make, but it was well worth all the time it took.

I made it exactly as the recipe said and didn't eat more than 2 bites. It was way too sweet.

I was very eager to try it since it was so highly rated but after reading the reviews I realized that almost everyone changed it quite a bit.

DELICIOUS!!! I used peaches instead because I'm not a fan of rasberries and it turned out yummy. Everyone loved both the salsa and the chips. Next time I think I might bake the chips in like muffin or cupcake pan so they come out curved and it'll be easier to scoop salsa with. I also followed the reviews and sprayed both sides of the tortillas with the butter spray and lightly dipped them in the cinnamon sugar so they wouldn't come out too sweet. I used kithen shears to cut them up instead of a pizza cutter because I didnt have one and it was totally easy. Definately try it!!

I can only comment on the cinnamon chips as that is all I made. I paired them up with a private recipe of kiwi salsa and it was a great match.

Don't understand all the fuss in the reviews about how to make the chips mess free. I used whole wheat tortillas, cut it into 8 pieces (like a pizza), brushed on MELTED BUTTER (didn't like the idea of butter from a can), pressed the buttered side into a plate of a equal mix of sugar and cinnamon, laid them all out on stone baking pan, in the oven for the recommended time, and VIOLA, they came out PERFECT. Crisp, yummy. Didn't bother with the sticking them in the muffin pan trick a lot of reviewers suggested bez that only meant more pans for me to clean up and would slow down the number I could pop in the oven in one time. But why bother? I provided a small spoon in the salsa that people used to scoop onto the flat crispy tortilla triangle and it was no problem for anyone. Easy, no mess, no bother, great tasting!

This was absolutely delicious!  Everyone was amazed at how great it tasted!  My only problem was that I used home-style tortillas.  They didn't get as crispy as I think they should have been.  I think the tortillas were too thick. Anyway, the next time I make it, my friend told me that I can use Tostitos "Scoops" tortillas chips from the grocery store and sprinkle with the cinnamon-sugar mixture and bake at 350 degrees for 5 minutes.

Made this for a pool party. It was a huge hit. Ran out of Cinnamon Chips pretty quickly. I would definitely suggest doubling the recipe. One of the other reviews suggested using Tostitos flour tortillas. I tried this and they didn't turn out at all. The cinnamon sugar didn't stick and they were salty. So I went with the original version and they turned out great. As far as the salsa; I didn't add any sugar. I used apricot preserves, 1 lb of strawberries, 2 kiwi, 1 nectarine, 2 fugi apples, and champagne grapes (these happened to be in season). The grapes were a great addition but a bit time consuming getting them off the vine. Everyone asked for the recipe.

Absolutely delicious!  I used granny smith apples, raspberries, strawberries and blueberries with red raspberry preserves.  We ate it with Trader Joe's cinammon pita chips and it was terrific.  Definitely a keeper!

Wonderful recipe!!!  Deserves more than just 5 stars!!! I actually had a recipe for similar chips made out of pita's.  I use the whole wheat ones...I seperate them, then cut them up just like this recipe says.  My family and I like them better than the tortilla's, but a bit harder to work with(I tried both).  I also used pizza cutter and butter spray, and then shook them in a bag/container...then baked them in muffin tins to curve them, for easier dipping. After one batch, I lined the tins...makes for easier clean up(as the sugar melts and hardens and eventually burns on).  Didn't use any added sugar in the fruit, and it was perfect.  I added grapes too...which I really liked! And the apples are a must...for the crunch. Terific recipe.  Time consuming, but oh so worth it!

So good! Big hit at my BBQ yesterday. For chips I found that Good Earth Fruit Crisps (Berry and Apple Cinnamon) were the most popular with the salsa. I also made the chips in the recipe and they were well received too. Stacy's Pita Chips were barely touched.

Next time I will only use the good earth chips.

For the salsa no sugar was needed with the fresh fruit. I just added strawberry preserves as it was what I had in the fridge.

I would give it 10 stars if there as sucha thing! :o) i loved this recipe! amazing! everytime i make it, everyone asks for the recipe! i did make the tortilla chips a little different and i found them to come out much better: i cut the tortillas into triangles and i fried them in veg oil until light brown. and let the oil drain on a paper towel. In a bowl i combinded the cinnamon and sugar to taste. then i tossed the "chips" until well coated in the cinnamon and sugar. i like making them like this because they come out more "chip like" and r super quick to make! they r so good i sometimes eat them alone! :o)   Thanks so much for the recipe!

This is my first time writing here, but I had to sign up to say how YUMMY this is!!
The Cinnamon Chips definitely do make this dish what it is...
Too make life a little easier I picked up a bag of Stacys Cinnamon Pita Chips and they really do go with the salsa very nicely.

I skipped the sugar, altogether, and this was plenty sweet without it, given that there is jam in it and sugar on the chips.  The making of the chips is messy and a bit tedious.  I wouldn't make them again, but they tasted good and several at our neighborhood party were chowing them down and trying to figure out what they were made of.  Thanks for the recipe, Annie!

Now, I didnt have any of the ingredients for the fruit salsa, but I decided to make the cinnamon chips anyway. And let me tell you, those are the best-tasteing, easiest to make delightful little snacks. My kids loved them and asked if they could help make my fourth batch of the day. All I can say is "wow!" We drizzled carmel over them and it was fabulous.

Absolutely tasty!! Fun to make & proud to share. Am always asked for the recipe! Haven't tried it with raspberries yet. My favorite combo: strawberries, canned crushed pineapple, apples, kiwi, blueberry with orange marmalade & 1tbs each brown & white sugar.

This did not turn out for me at all. Not sure what I did wrong. Prep time surely was longer than 15 min. My chips were awful, and all the salsa tasted like was strawberries. Very disappointed. Will not make this again.

Good to take to a brunch. Used a bag of cinnamon pita chips to dip it in. Some of it got eaten but nobody commented on it, one way or the other. People said the loved the pita chips though (Stacy's brand).

I made this due to all of the 5 star reviews and was disappointed.  Everyone tried it at my brunch gathering but no one went back for seconds...and I did follow the recipe exactly...hmmm.

This was very good.  It is a great side dish for the summer time or to take on picnics.  I used blueberries instead of raspberries.  The chips were alright, they became kind of tough from the butter spray being used.  I was skeptical about using the spray because it's not really made to coat food.  I would use something different to coat them with next time.  Overall it was very good!

I just made this recipe for Easter brunch. It went over pretty well. I made it the night before, but waited to add the sugar until the morning I was going to serve it. I only ended up adding about 2T. of brown sugar. I omitted the white sugar and the preserves. I served it with store bought  cinnamon/sugar pita chips. Everyone really seemed to like it. I did not have any trouble with my apples turning brown, in fact, everything was a nice red color. This makes quite a bit, so make sure you know how many people you will be serving. I had quite a bit leftover since I had so much food at the party. Later in the week, I added a bit more fruit and some flour to thicken it. I also added more brown sugar some cinn and nutmeg. Then I made an apple crisp topping and baked it for about 30 min. It was delicious served with vanilla ice cream.

This was a huge hit.  I took the advice of another reviewer and lined my baking sheet with parchment paper. It worked out great. I had no problem with the chips sticking to the pan. My friends I made it for wound up leaving  with the recipe.

I wanted to find a light and refreshing appetizer for a spring get together with a few friends. This fit the bill. Using a food processor saved a lot of chopping time and small pieces of fruit is a major key in this recipe. I then used a colander to drain some of the juice off before adding the sugars. The consistency was perfect. I bought a bag of cinnamon pita chips and also made the cinnamon chips from this recipe. (Next time I will double the amount of chips that I make) The store bought chips were hardly touched. Turned out perfect!!! Everyone raved. Thank You

I took this to a party and everyone raved about it.  While the fruit was really good it was the chips that everyone couldn't keep away from.  My friend was complaining because she couldn't stop eating them.

This recipe is so easy and so good.  I'm going to try putting the salsa over angel food cake with a dollop of cool whip.  I'm sure it will make an excellent summer dessert.

This is fantastic!  I gave the recipe to a friend to make for a function we had, and it was a hit with everyone.  Added blackberries.  I'm going to make it again tomorrow, and I'm going to use less sugar.  I didn't mind the sweetness (I love sweets) but think it could be just as delicious and healthier at the same time.

This is a keep forever recipe.

I tried a small amount of chips with melted butter and they were great so couldn't wait to get the  butter spray and do a whole batch. I followed the suggestions of doing 4 at a time as I LOVE easy! But they were nothing compared to doing one at a time. The butter spray went all over the sink and doing both sides made them stick to the pan. Plus they were way too sugary. I threw them out and started again using real melted butter and doing just one side and they were perfection. A 100% difference. It took me 25 minutes - not more than the "easy" way. A wonderful refreshing salsa. Thanks.

This is my favorite Allrecipes recipe! I made it again yesterday and fruit is kind of out of season right now, but I substituted plums and blackberries for the strawberries. A lot of the fruit was sour but by the time I mixed it with the ever-fresh golden delicious apples and kiwi (with sugar, of course) it all tasted perfect! After making the recipe a few times, we like it best when both sides of the chips were sprayed with cooking spray, it makes them crispier.

Excellent recipe.  I used apricot preserves and it was perfect - didn't overpower the other flavors.  The best tip:  If you're in a hurry or need a BUNCH, skip the homemade cinnamon chips and get cinnamon/sugar pita chips from the store.  It was AWESOME with those!

I got so many compliments on this.  I made it for superbowl and it's healthier than those cheesy/meat packed dips.  I was a tad disappointed on the chips - I will have to experiment on those a bit.  Maybe it was the brand of tortillas I got...?  I saw in a cooking magazine recently they made "chips" out of a few layers of phyllo dough.  Next time I make this I will experiment with that instead.

If I could give this 10 stars, I would! The chips and fruit salsa are SO easy to make and everyone loves them. They went so fast. My only advice would be to really watch the chips toward the end of the baking time as they can burn easily (at least in my oven! :)

Definitely a winner! Every year on Christmas Eve my family holds an appetizer contest. That way there is plenty to eat, without a whole lot of work. And, most importantly, it adds a little competition. Well, this recipe blew the competition out of the water! It was absolutley delicious. Thanks for, literally, an award-winning recipe!

The cinnamon chips are the best.  I have followed the recipe exactly and it is wonderful but I have improvised with other "on hand" fruits and it is always good. I have found the strawberries are absolutely required but after that I prefer firmer fruits like cantelope pineapple and apples cut very small.  The softer fruits are good but fall apart to form a bowl of indiscriminate delicious mush

This was a great hit with my grandsons.  Made it for them for New Year's eve.  I dipped the tortillas in sugar mix instead of sprinkling and this was too much.  Used pear, peaches, strawberries and kiwi.

This is great.  Just wanted to let you know that my kiwis were not ripe so I used a mango.  What a great combination.  I am diabetic, so I used Splenda instead of sugar and Simply Fruit Apricot spread.  I also used Cinnamon Crispitos made by Festida Foods, Ltd.  I will definitely make this again.

This was great! I used 2 GD apples and one Fuji, I think. I forgot kiwis while at the store, and used 16 oz frozen strawberries, and I think a 10 or 12 oz bag of frozen sweetened raspberries. I chopped up everything but the strawberries. Only added the brown sugar because the raspberries were already sweetened. And I used pineapple apricot preserves. It turned out fantastic. My fiance thought the chips were too sweet so I made a couple trays worth with just the butter spray and no cinnamon sugar which turned out well for those that didn't have the crazy sweettooth that I have! This turned out really great, and we had them over pancakes with whipped cream the next morning as suggested by another review. I'll definitely make this again, everyone loved it!

Excellent.  Took it to a party and everyone loved it.  I used Apricot Preseves and added Blueberries.

This was delicious.  My kids and husband loved it. I made it for a party as the "dessert".  It was great.   I will make it again.

I used thawed frozen strawberries and raspberries.  I drained off some of the juice, but left the rest which made it a bit more salsa-like...Very good!

This is a wonderful treat, my children loved the "chips" the best.  It's worth the effort to make.  I halved the salsa and doubled the chips.  Thanks for sharing!

This was so delicious.  I brought it to a potluck a few weeks ago and people are still talking about it today - it was a huge hit!  I didn't use any brown or white sugar in the salsa and added blueberries for color.  I too made the chips by putting 1 c of sugar to 1 teaspoon of cinnamon in a ziploc bag and shaking a bunch of tortillas at once - it made it go by much faster.

I am giving this recipe 4 stars only because my hubby gave me at least five comments of how good it was. I thought is just so-so and better prepared fresh as I took it to a birthday party, the juices needed to be drained three times and it looked slightly unappetising. I put the cut up flour tortillas in a muffin pan to create the curve in the chip and it really is time consuming and uses a lot of fruit (remembering that you might need lime for browning apples). I would have given this three stars as it tasted alright, but hubby said it was a good little munch out.

Everyone raved over this!  I used apples, kiwi, pineapple, mango, peaches, and strawberries (added right before serving).  When I first mixed it, I thought it would be too dry, but it got much jucier as time went on.

Absolutely AMAZING!  I made a Mexican themed meal for company and served this for desert with some really great vanilla ice cream.  I did follow the directions exactly, except I added balsamic vinegar to compliment the berries (trust me) and a finely diced jalapeno.  Everyone was amazed by how well it all worked and really enjoyed the slight kick from the jajapeno.  The cinnamon chips were so easy, I toasted them first then threw them in a large zip lock bag with the cinnamon and sugar mix and shook well.  The presentation was really great, a large scoop of ice cream surrounded by four wedges of cinnamon chips and a generous amount of the salsa on top.  My guests were floored!  The preparation was really simple all around.  I did add a touch of lime to the salsa since I was making it a few hours in advance.

I first made this at our "girls night" get together & it was a HUGE hit. Now whenever there's a family or office potluck I am asked to make it. I did however use diff fruits - I used 2 apples, sm.container of blueberries & a sm.container of rasberries, and to watch sugar intake I used Splenda instead of white sugar and used the Smucker's Sugar Free Preserves (any flavor will do).  Also if it's not quite "juicy" enough I use about 2tbls of crushed pinapple to act as "glue".  I also found if you squirt a little lemon or lime juice on the apples prior to mixing in everything else, it keeps the apples from turning!

Has anyone tried adding a bit of chopped cilantro and jalepeno pepper to this mix (for a little kick)?  Maybe finely chopped red onion? Diced grilled fresh pineapple might also be nice.

I'm not rating this, because I only made the cinnamon chips, but they were incredible!  I brushed them with melted butter and baked on 400 degrees for 4 minutes.  I served with Mango Salsa from this site.  Delicious!

I made this appetizer for a progressive dinner, and it was really pretty!  The salsa is basically a fruit salad, but I used blueberry preserves and it looked pretty.  The chips were awesome though!  They were easy and tasty and they looked really professional.  I will make this again.

This recipe is phenomenal!  I made it for a Mexican themed party lastnight and it was so summery!  Please don't let comments that it takes long turn you off, I think it took me a total of 45 minutes for everything and it was worth every second!  The chips turned out great too, so tasty (I snacked on a few on the way to the party!) Anyhow, the recipe doesn't state if you should chop the strawberries and raspberries but I did dice the strawberries.  The raspberries ended up condensing as you fold the ingredients.  Best of luck and enjoy!

P.S. It does make a lot, I even took extra to work the next day!

I thought this was an outstanding recipe.  It was beautiful to serve and tasty to eat. I did not use the raspberries in the recipe because several of my friends do not care for them. Even without the raspberries it was delicious (and less costly). I substituted Gala apples for the Red Delicious, I find that there is a huge difference in quality of taste between the two types. When making the tortilla chips, instead of sprinkling the cinnamon-sugar mixture on, I placed the mixture in a Ziploc bag and coated the tortillas that way (I believe I used 2 cups of sugar and 4 teaspoons of cinnamon). I also cut down on the fat content by brushing the tortillas with water instead of using the cooking oil. They turned out great, lots of cinnamon-sugar coating and very crunchy (great for dipping). I will absolutely make this again. It is one of the tastiest dishes I have made in a long time. Thanks so much for contributing this addition to my recipe book.

Everybody in the office loved it.  It does take a bit of time to prepare (all that washing, chopping, etc.) but it looks great, tastes great and is pretty healthy to boot.  Someone suggested putting the cut-up tortillas in a bag of cinnamon sugar and shaking to coat.  I did it that way and the chips had way too much coating -- the cinnamon stuck, and the sugar didn't so the cinnamon flavor was overpowering .  So I prefer to prepare the chips the way the recipe says.

"It's like eating pie!" was the response I got.  Definitely double the amount of chips.  YUM!!!!!!
(Chips can be made a day ahead and stored in an airtight container.)

This was a great recipe!  However it was very time consuming.  when I make it again, I will make the salsa the day before, and then make the chips!  Some tips that I think might help Use a pizza cutter to cut tortillas, also if you have a cheese shaker use it to shake the cinnamon sugar on to the tortilla chips.  This is a great recipe!  Thanks Annie

7/24/06 -   I have made this recipe at least 10 times since I first tried it.  It ALWAYS gets gobbled up first.  If you are debating whether or not to try it... DO IT!!  You won't regret it!!

this recipe is absolutely WONDERFUL!!  i wanted something different to bring to a potluck at work today and this is great!  i've had at least 15 people ask me for the recipe so far this morning!  i diced all the fruit last night, and mixed it together this morning.  it looks so pretty!!
i did alter the recipe slightly for my tastes...
i don't care for raspberries so i replaced those with frozen peaches.  i used strawberry perserves and replaced all the sugar with splenda. 
it is really a great!   
i will defintely make it again!

**note, the only thing i have to complain about is how long it takes to chop all that fruit... WHEW!  USE A CHOPPER!

This was pretty good the first day and awsome the second.  I did change things a little, as fresh berries weren't in season when I made it.  I used 1 apple, 1 pear, 2 kiwis and a bag of frozen mixed berries.  I added lime juice to the apple and pear to prevent browness and cut back on the sugar (I only used the brown sugar).  I also did not use any preserves as the juice from the berries and the brown sugar made it juicy enough.  I think the lime juice is what really helped off set the sweetness.  Also, when making the tortillas I found it was easier to spray the tortillas and then dredge in cinnamon/sugar, cut and then spray again.  Great recipe, and I can't wait to make now that strawberries are coming into season!

Very good. Followed recipe exactly as written, using apricot preserves. Followed others suggestions of using a pizza cutter(great idea) & dredging cut tortillas in sugar mixture a few at a time(less mess). I also think this salsa would be a good topping on waffles or ice cream. Thanks!

My daughter and I have very different taste in food.  When I saw this I thought maybe we would both like it. Well I did but she loves it!  When she comes home from college on the weekend she'll  warn me I have to make some so she can take it back to her friends who love it too.  When she takes it back to college I send the new grahm cracker sticks for dipping.

Very good, but a little messy.  Might try those new scoops that are out.  Spray, sprinkle, spray and bake a little...

I made this for "dessert" tonight! WOW! This was sooo tasty! Everyone loved every bite! I think different types of fruit could be used to taste. My only complaint: I cannot afford to make this alot until summer when the cost for such fruits come down (I'm a little leary about using frozen...I wonder if the results would be the same?). Wonderful taste is an understatement. Thank you Ann for sharing this great recipe.

I have fixed the fruit salsa, which is a terrific accompaniment.  However, usually I just fix the cinnamon chips.  My friend asked if the chips kept well.  I told her I didn't know, we had never had any left!  This recipe is a staple in our household.

I just served this at our Kentucky Derby party.  I used pinking shears instead of my usual pizza cutter.  A friend said that the fruit salsa was good, but that he REALLY liked the cinnamon chips with the chocolate that I had for dipping strawberries and pineapple.  Still one of my favorite snacks.

I made this for a summer party.  It was sooo good.  I made the chips the night before so all I had to do was cut up the fruit.  We used the left over salsa on ice cream, even yummier!

This recipe was a *lot* of work, especially the chips part.It also made quite a lot of the fruit mixtrue.(probably more than necessary) But so many people loved it, it was well worth it.I took it to a baby shower, and many people came up to me with compliments and requests for the recipe. The best part of this recipe is it's unique-ness. Will use for special occasions in the future.

This was really good.  I added some blueberries (whole) and peaches.  Made the chips 2 hours before serving and had the salsa and chips out when guests arrived.  I made Salsa Chicken this night, which is also good!

We all LOVED the cinnamon chips & ate tons of those, but the fruit salsa was a bit too sweet with the chips & my turned out runny, which I'm sure was my fault.  But, it took quite a bit of time to prepare with all the cutting of fruit & slicing of tortillas.  I made sure to rub my tortillas with butter before I sprinkled the cinnamon mixture on them.  I'll definitely make the chips as a snack in the future, but will probably skip the fruit!

I made this for the last night of class when everyone brought a dish - it was a major hit.  I liked knowing that the chances of someone else making the same dish or even something similar was very small.  Easy to make and addicting!

i like to do most of the prep for a party ahead of time - you cannot do that with this recipe, hence the 4 star rating.  Plus it doesn't keep well, AND the chopping is time consuming. It is delicious as written - but is also tremendously flexible, which I love. Depending upon where (and to whom) it is being served, I might add a splash of orange or blackberry liquor. Toss in a few blackberries or blueberries. I use less sugar, and a little more jam. I might add a leaf of mint. (Remove before serving, and don't add too much!) Change anything you want to make it your own - or keep it exact. Delicious however. I alway chop the fruit into tiny pieces. Tiny. Tiny.  The liquid it releases then becomes a part of the salsa, and you don't have fruit salad drowning in its' own juice. I serve it with a small spoon, rather than trying to 'dip' the chips.  Also use packaged cinnamon sugar pita chips or bagel rounds, they go fast! If there is any left - serve it over cheesecake, ice cream, or use as an accent for strawberry shortcake.  YUM!

I do not like eating fruit. I only like unripe sort of fruit, which is rare to find at just the right degree of ripeness (I don't like mooshy, I don't like citrus..) So, I planned to make this for 4th of July, for others, because the picture that use to be up was very pretty. I made this with a variety of fruits, and I cubed them all about 1/4" each, then halved blueberries. I used orange preserve, let it soak overnight, lazily grabbed a bag of pita cinnamon & sugar chips & called it a day. Because I have to try it before serving, I tried it. Oh, my, goodness. I actually liked....no....LOVED it. I have never said I loved anything fruit, unless it's cherry ice cream, which isn't really fruit at all, as much as I pretend!  This was gone in a matter of minutes at the cookout, and I have made it several times with a variety of fruits available, but always strawberry and kiwi and orange preserve. Try it, you won't be sorry.

This is a great and forgiving recipe. You can easily add or substitute whatever fruits you have on hand. I used a whole wheat tortilla, substituted honey and real maple syrup for the sugars and cut the amount in half,  as my husband Picky Philly as been ordered by his doc. I modified it to low sugar, low carb, higher fiber, and  fat free and still got a 5 star Picky Philly rating. AMAZING given Picky Philly is fruit and vegetable adverse!

I have made this several different time and it is always a HUGE hit. I didn't add any sugar to the fruit. Instead of raspberries I added blueberries and either grapes or pineapple. I also did what another reviewer suggested and baked the tortilla shells in a muffin pan to make scoops. And make sure you use butter flavored cooking spray. If you don't it wont taste as good. I have been asked to make this several time because everyone LOVES it!

A delicious, refreshing fruit dip. I made as listed and used orange marmalade for the preserves.  I did not make the homemade cinnamon chips, I bought them.  I took half a batch to a lake party and the other half to a work party.  It was a hit at both place.

Made this for on the appetizer table on Easter.  I never expected it to go over as big as it did!  Turned out to be a huge hit!  I only cut up one apple, as I could tell it was going to be making a lot!  I also did not make the tortillas. I just bought Cinnamon grahams instead.  Next time I'll try the tortillas.

So very yummy. I didn't use any sugar, used frozen peaches instead of the raspberries, Fuji apples and used orange marmalade as suggested by one of the reviewers. I also used gluten free Millet and Flax cinnamon chips from Sammie's Bakery.  Delish! My husband loves it and it was a huge hit at the party.

This is so good! I read some of the suggestion and changed the sugar amount to half and it was wonderful.

We don't care for raspberries in our house so I used fresh or frozen peaches depending on the season and we love it! I switch up the fruit preserves depending on what I have and it is equally delicious. This is great for any season and we like it served with some fruit dip made with marshmallow crème, cream cheese and Cool Whip combined on the side. This is not the figure friendly version but great for a special occasion and looks great served in a "cloud" of this white fluffiness! Use a small jar of marshmallow crème, one package of cream cheese at room temperature and one small carton of Cool Whip, mix with a mixer and chill. Delicious!

This was a LOT of work, but I thought it was delicious. Unfortunately not many people tried it at the event I brought it to. I don't know if people just generally like salty things for an appetizer, but people didn't really eat this. That said, I thought it was delicious.

I loved this recipe, but I'm only giving it 4 stars for two reasons: 1. I didn't add any sugar to the salsa and it was sweet enough with the chips even though I left it out and 2. the prep time on this is way more than 15 minutes when you are chopping all the different fruit up.  It was excellent though and it is definitely worth trying, but I would leave out the sugar and prepare for more prep time.

This was delicious! I omitted the preserves and added in some blackberries and mandarin orange segments. I did have some issues with my first batch of chips smoking and slightly burning on the bottom - I decreased the cooking time slightly on the next batch and they were OK.

My family loves this but I made changes to accomidate our tastes and what others suggested. I use finely chopped fresh strawberries,apples that we eat (gala, eve, jazz or honeycrisp) pears and kiwis. I dont use any fruit that has been frozen we dont like the soggy texture and I peel the apples and pears. I make my own frozen low sugar strawberry jam and add several heaping spoonfuls. No added sugar at all other than the jam. The tortillas after spraying(I spray them in my roaster pan to reduce mess)and slicing I dredge them in the cinnamon/sugar mixture but dont press them into the mixture or they become too sweet. cooking them for 10 minutes is perfect for us, super crunchy. after the tortillas come out of the oven I flip them over to let the undersides dry to make sure they are extra crispy.

This was so delicious! I used these fruits (not everything is in season in December, and I wanted more variety): 1 cup pomegranate arils, 1 lb frozen stawberries (thawed, diced, and drained), 3/4 cup frozen blueberries, 1/2 cup frozen peaches, 3/4 cup blackberries (quartered), 1 Junami apple, and 2 kiwis. I only added about 1 tbsp white sugar and used apricot preserves. I served it with cinnamon-sugar pita chips I found at the grocery store. Everyone absolutely loved this, and even used it on the seafood at dinner! Next time, I will use fresh strawberries, though - even with draining them, it was a little watery after it sat for a few hours. Thanks for a great customizable recipe!

Yummy! I made this recipe last weekend for my family and we all loved it. There were six of us and we had some left over after we ate it for dessert. I didn't have any raspberries but I had fresh peaches and they worked well. I used apricot preserves that I made last summer for the preserves. My family really liked it with the chips. I will make this again as it taste great and was really easy to prepare.

I used whole wheat tortillas. I imagine they will taste better with white :)

Everyone really liked the fruit salsa.

This was very good but I will definitely cut down the white sugar to 1 tbs next time.  I used apricot preserves.  Another tip is to use wonton wrappers for the chips.  Just lay them out, spray them (one side is sufficient) throw them in a ziploc with the cinnamon and sugar and then bake.  Easier than cutting up all the tortillas.

I brought this to a bbq and it was a huge hit.  Everyone loved it.  I did take a shortcut and bought the cinnamon pita chips.  And someone else had made poundcake to put strawberries on but lots of people put this fruit salsa on the poundcake instead and love it.

I have made this several times and always get the biggest compliments on it.  I normally add blueberries too and by the time I add the extra fruit it isn't as overly sweet as other people think.

My friends always ask me to bring this to our pot luck parties. For our taste, I cut back the sugar to 1Tbs. brown sugar, no white sugar. Also, if you have an Alligator dicer, it makes the dice even, and cuts prep time in half.

I have made this multiple times, and everyone always loves it.  Super easy to make.  The first time I made it exactly according to the recipe.  the second time I didn't use kiwis (as I forgot the recipe when I went to the store!), but used blackberries instead.  Also, I skipped the added sugar the second time around and it still turned out wonderful.  I used raspberry preserves both times.  Yum yum yum!!

Pretty easy to make and tastes great. The only thing I'd change is to take out the raspberries, and use raspberry preserves. A few tablespoons of that flavors the whole thing, and you can save some money not buying the fresh raspberries. Also, I didn't add any white sugar to the fruit, and it still tasted plenty sweet.

Many of my friends said this was their favorite appetizer at our party. I used 2 tablespoons of lemon juice instead of the fruit preserve and I'm glad I did, I think it would have been too sweet for my friends.

It was good, but it wasn't perfect.  The salsa was a little too sweet.  Next time I'm thinking of adding a little more acidic/sour fruit to even it out.  The chips were good, but more work than they were worth.  I would maybe recommend the store bought cinnamon sugar chips or pita chips instead as a time saver.

very, very good. I used rasberry preserves because I used blackberries instead of rasberries in the recipe.  came out great. I took the other reviewers advice and cut the sugar. I only added the brown sugar and preserves. I sed fuji apples bc I like them. Really, you can add whatever fruit you like and as much sugar as you want.  It was plenty sweet w/o white sugar. I made mine right before I left for party, but it wasnt served for a while and it tasted great.  It is a very easy, forgiving recipe. Hard to mess up, I mean, it is fruit and preserves. pita chips were fantastic too.

Everywhere I have taken this I have had compliments on it. I replace the 8 oz raspberries with 12 to 16 oz of frozen peaches (depends on the brand). I have also found that you have to use 'butter flavored' cooking spray for the chips, anything else leaves an after taste.

This recipe is awesome.  I used Honey Crisp Apples, Frozen Strawberries (I didn't have fresh) and Frozen homemade strawberry jelly (I didn't have any thawed.  It turned out spectacular.  I made the recipe according to the directions except for the above changes & it turned out awesome.  I would recommend this recipe for a healthy appetizer.  Thanks for sharing your recipe.

this is AMAZING! everyone loves it, all ages! it's really fantastic and not overly too sweet. we get a bag of stacy's cinnamon pita chips, they are so thick they can really hold a lot of chunky salsa. thanks so much for this recipe, i love it.

Made this for a work get-together & absolutely loved it. I was looking for something a little healthier, but that still tastes great. I ended up being a little lazy & using Cinnamon Brown Sugar Ritz Crackers & it worked out great! The leftovers lasted about a week.

I made this by the recipe, however, I squeezed a lime over the diced apples to keep them from browning...work great. Everyone loved it! I'm going to make it again tomorrow to take to a picnic!

Very nice. I only made the salsa. I omitted the white sugar but I actually think next time I will make it as directed. I think it would have been even better if it was sweeter. Instead of making the chips I just used Stacy's Pita Chips to make it easier.

Time consuming but worth it.   I don't use fruit preserves in it.   I add more brown sugar &  some cinnamon to the fruit mix.  Strawberries, apples, & pears are my favorite fruits to use.  Peaches & mangoes seem to disintegrate after awhile.  This makes a great topping for waffles & pancakes, too.

GREAT RECIPE!  My friend actually made this for a brunch I attended and I had to have the recipe after that.  She directed me to this website and have been hooked ever since.  I have made this several times now, and every time I have to tell everyone where to get this recipe.  Thanks!!

This is awesome!! We made the chips as stated in the recipe and used fuji apples, raspberries, strawberries, peaches, kiwi, and blueberries in the fruit salsa. Plain old grape jam works great for the preserves, and we did add some white and brown sugar as called for in the recipe. The sugar seemed necessary to us, to cut out some of the bitterness in the berries - but I'm sure this depends heavily on personal preference. It turned out great! We'll be making this again :D

this is a HUGE HIT.   Honestly, it's delicious and a perfect summer-time appetizer!  It's worth all the chopping, and use whatever fruits sound good to you.  You can really use anything.

I've made this several times for different parties and no one ever seems to like it.  It went mostly untouched each time.  Someone told me it tasted like eating cinnamon cereal with fruit and no milk and another questioned why anyone would want to dip chips, even sweet ones, into fruit.  Overall, I think it tastes okay, but not good enough to make again.

This is a party / potluck favorite.  I did change a few things in the salsa recipe. I did not use the reapberries because they were to expensive.  Instead I used more strawberries.  I only used  1/2 Tbs of the white sugar.   I used 2 Tbs of Apricot Fruit preserves.   The salsa turned out great.   I saved time and bought cinnamon sugar Pita chips from traderjoe's.   The salsa is also good on waffles and pancakes too:)

I could eat this salsa with a spoon---but it's so much better with these yummy cinnamon-sugar chips. Perfect for a summer backyard party! Leftover salsa is great over angel food cake, ice cream, or fruit salad. Yummo!

This was excellent! I served for a party and everyone loved it! It goes great with a glass of champagne. Make sure to use real butter for the tortillas. It has a more rich taste than the cooking spray or margarine. Thanks for the recipe. It is now in the party dish rotation! :)

UPDATE: a day or 2 after when this was quite soggy looking I used the leftovers up by blending with ice and a little bit of fruit juice. It made a delicious slushy fruit drink! This was just excellent. I made the fruit salsa as stated but you could definitely use any of your favorite fruit combos. The chips I did a little differently though, I cut up tortillas, brushed them (ok, dunked them – it was faster!) in melted butter and then shook in a zip loc with brown sugar, white sugar and cinnamon to coat. They took me about 14 minutes to bake at 350 and took several batches to get a significant number of chips. I found that there was way more salsa than chips with this recipe. Either way, they were gobbled up and so yummy! I definitely plan to put this into a regular party food rotation.

Great!!! Easy to make.  Made it for my daughters youth group and they ate every bit of it. The kids were asking for the recipe. Used a bag of frozen mixed berries with fresh strawberries, kiwi and apples.  Don't be afraid to use frozen fruit.   Very easy to substitute different kinds of fruit.  Made several times.

So delicious!  The salsa bowl was empty and there was mere sugar/cinn dust remaining from the chips.  Definately a crowd favorite that will show up for many a party!

Really disappointed with this... As written, the recipe has way too much apple and not enough kiwi.  Apple was all you could see or taste and the kiwi disappeared to nothing.  Thought 3 T of fruit perserves was way too much - would make it like a glaze - so used 2 T and was still WAY too much.  Plus the sugar made all the fruit release their juice so it was just mushy fruit slop - didn't hold the diced shape at all.  Am so disappointed I haven't even bothered to make the cinnamon chips cuz the salsa doesn't look appetizing enough to scoop up  :(

Hit of the party! Everyone LOVED it! I added 16 oz frozen peaches, diced and a little more sugar. The mixture was juicier than I expected but the crowd loved soaking their chips as well. I also sprayed the cookie sheet before adding the wedges and added the sugar mix so there was a little on the backside of each chip. It was a great, healthy recipe that I am surely adding to my recipe book. Thanks!

Yummy for my tummy!!  The chips taste good even w/out fruit.  I cut the sugar in half omitted the brown sugar completey, and added only 1 Tbsp of preserves and it was perfect sweetness.  Everyone loved it.

Really, really good.  I took this to a party and everyone raved.  I did add pineapple and used apricot preserves, but it is the chips that make it.  I sprayed them with butter flavored Pam in on a cutting board in the sink and then cut them with a pizza cutter, tossed them in a bag with cinnamon sugar, and put them on the sheet.  Yum.

This is absolutely delicious and very pretty too.  I added blackberries to the mixture & diced everything up.  My apple of choice was 'honey crisp' and I used Apricot preserves.  I cut down the amount of sugar, based on previous comments.  If you are serving them with the cin/sugar tortillas chips, I think you can omit the sugar all together, because the tortilla chips have enough sugar on them. You know it is a great recipe when everyone requests the recipe from you!  This is one of them!

This salsa is fantastic! I used the following: 2 Fuji apples, 2 peaches, 2 kiwis, about 3/4 container of strawberries, apricot preserves, 2 tbs brown sugar and 1 tbs white sugar....HUGE hit! I loved every minute of it! Was kind of upset there was no left overs! The chips are super easy and a must as well!! I will make this OVER and OVER! YOU MUST TRY THIS!!!! WONDERFUL!

I used this as a cooking project with a group of 5-10 year olds and they all loved it! A few of them even came up to me and asked for the recipe :) Used some different fruits (apples, pineapple, strawberries, blueberries, raspberries and peaches) but kept everything else the same. The chips are delicious!

I absolutely love this recipe! I've made it on several occasions and received rave reviews each time. I half the amount of raspberries and add blueberries in their place. I also use half granny smith, half gala apples instead of the golden delicious. And I leave the skin on the apples -- no need to waste time on peeling when the skin adds some texture and color to the mixture. I've used pineapple, strawberry and raspberry jam and they all work great. For the cinnamon chips, I coat both sides of the tortillas with the cinnamon sugar and then bake them in cupcake tins for a "scoop-like" chip as another poster recommended. Love it, love it, love it!!

Made this for a tailgate party. Got many requests for the recipe. Hardly any left. Served with cinnamon sugar pita chips I bought at the store. Did not add sugar. As with others, the sweetness of the fruit, preserves, and chip seemed just fine. A keeper. Thanks for sharing!

This is very similar to the pampered chef recipe. I have made this for a couple different parties and people are never sure what to think of the dish.  It looks like salsa but paired with sugared chips. At first glance it looks a little odd. Once word gets around that it is fruit people cannot get enough of it.

I tried this recipe several months ago and I am STILL getting compliments and requests on it!  The first time I made the salsa and was in a hurry so I didi not make the chips, I stopped and bought some Stacy's cinnamon and sugar pita chips....YUMMY!  The last time I made it "healthier" by substituting the sugar and brown sugar for sucanat and sucanat w/honey and made homeade tortilla chips with rice flour tortillas......AWESOME!

WOW!!!   I cannot stop eating this - and since I have to bring it to a party tonight - that's a bad thing!  The chips are just like crunchy crispy cinnamon toast and the salsa is amazing!  It is a little on the sweet side, but I used 50% sugar preserves, so it wasn't a problem for me.   Too easy - a bit of chopping and mixing is well worth this result!   Thank you thank you thank you!  I will make this frequently!

This is a spectacular recipe and I will definitely be making again soon. I followed the recipe pretty closely with the following changes: 1) I cut the tortillas into wedges and sprayed both sides with butter. I then added them to a big baggie filled with my cinnamon-sugar mixture and just shook the bag until they were all coated. Made for a very easy cleanup. 2) I couldn't find any raspberries, so I just used more kiwi and raspberry preserves. 3) I used FIJI apples! I First sliced the apples into quarters and then dipped the apples in lemon juice before chopping up to prevent browning. 4) I didn't use the full amount of sugars suggested as my fruits were pretty sweet already, so I just sprinkled a bit of white and bit of brown sugar.  I got rave reviews from my guests and they are looking forward to the next time I make this!

I get rave reviews and lots of impressed people every time I make this.  My only complaint is that it takes sooo long to do!  I made a double batch and it took 3.5 hours (2 on chips, 1.5 on cutting fruit).  For the chips, I slice with a pizza cutter, spray both sides with butter, and shake in a plastic bag of cinnamon & sugar.  I stopped using brown sugar because it's plenty sweet already.  Probably just adding the preserves would be enough.  Will make again, but not too often just because of time!

Yum! I made for a party. Many people said that they had never had anything like it before. I had several requests for the recipe. I can't wait to make it again. It was a little runny. I cut the sugar in the glaze and the cinnamon/sugar in half, added peaches and blueberries. A huge hit!

You HAVE to try this recipe:  There's a reason it has 1500+ high ratings. If I could give this 10 stars, I would, it's THAT good!  Like others, I did change it up a little... I tossed the diced (gala) apples in a few tablespoons lime juice to prevent browning; I added no sugar whatsoever; I also added blueberries.  With the chips, I found the cheaper flour tortillas, the thicker kind that are on the shelf, were better than the more expensive refrigerated kind.  That's just my opinion.  Also, I sprayed the chips (after cutting the rounds into quarters with a pizza cutter), cinnamon-sugared them, resprayed, then second coated with cinnamon sugar.  They were awesome by themselves.  I 1 1/2 times'd this recipe and it made 1/2 gallon of salsa... which was the only food at the party that was gone before it was over.

My family loved this fruit salsa.  I have made some changes:  I use the fruit that I have on hand.  Once I cut up oranges, apples, kiwi, pineapple and watermelon and I used less sugar.  My kids love it, they like eating straight out of the bowl with a spoon!

I served this at my Cinco de Mayo party.  It was a major hit!  Not only did people rave about it, several asked for the recipe!  Note that the fruit and preserves that you use can influence the taste.

This recipes rocks.  Great for a summer day bbq.  If you are short on time, you can buy cinnamon pita chips instead of making the cinnamon tortilla chips.  Tastes great with the pita chips too.

WOW! I made this recipe and brought it to my nursing graduation pot luck. Fellow graduates and nursing instructors could not stop raving about this dish. It was the first dish that was GONE! I subsituted for granny smith apples, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. It took me over an hour to cook the chips and cut all the fruits but it was well work it! Will definately make this again :)

The cinnamon chips are phenomenal and so addictive! The fruit is good and really doesn't need sugar. It's hard to taste the sweetness of the chips when you dip them in the fruit. Works great to cut the kiwi and strawberries with an egg slicer and to oil the tortillas with a brush, then sprinkle them with cinn/sugar, then cut them up and bake!! Delicious idea: mix some fruit salsa into some plain yogurt!!

I wasn't sure whether or not I would like this dish, but I wanted to serve something different to others.  WOW!!  I loved it and so did they!!  We literally couldn't stop eating it.  A couple of my guests even wanted some to take home, but I said, "NO, it's mine ALL MINE!!!"  Ok, seriously, the stuff is great!!  Chopping takes some time if you don't have a food processor, but it's worth every minute.

Great recipe!  So refreshing and different.  I've never made a fruit salsa.  With the warm weather it's a great change to typical salsa.  I had a casual cocktail party on my deck and served this along with several other appetizers that balanced the selection. I also used Stacy's chips since I ran out of time on the homemade tortillas.

I have been making this for just over a year now.  I brought it to work for a shower today and so many people asked for the recipe.  I serve this with Cinnamon Sugar pita chips that I purchase from a local grocery store.  Once you start eating this, it is hard to stop.  Thank you for this recipe, it is wonderful.

Absolutely delicious.  I put in blueberries instead of raspberries and skipped the bananas.  I used Fuji apples and Red Raspberry preserves.  I also cut back on both the sugar and the preserves, using about half of what it called for. I also only used one apple.  The tortillas were incredibly easy to make and a huge hit at the party I took them to.  Everyone wanted to know how I made them and what I used.  All in all, delicious and a big hit!

I just want to add another five stars to this recipe, not that it needs it.  The chips were surprisingly wonderful and the salsa was the perfect compliment.  I will be making this often!  Thank you Annie for sharing.

Delicious and Easy.  I took it to a potluck at work and received multiple compliments; especially on the chips.  Couldn't find fresh raspberries; so, I used frozen peaches and frozen raspberries.  I did use stawberry preserves as well.  Highly recommend especially for showers and entertaining.

I made this appetizer as a last minute decision for a social gathering and what a decision it was!  It was the first dish to be tried and it was the first to be finished!  The compliments just kept coming! Was very easy to make..I even substituted splenda when I ran out of sugar and used frozen raspberries with the rest of the fresh fruit...I'm going to have to make it again b/c I didn't even get a chance to try it-it went so fast!

I have made this recipe a couple times now and it has not dissapointed!!  I LOVE this!  I do add blueberries and red seedless grapes as well....but do not increase the sugars.  I think the blueberries are a must for the tartness and the color they bring to this recipe.  I chop everything mildly with my pampered chef chopper and it comes out perfect!  This is intended to be more of a watery recipe....like salsa....so if you are looking for something firmer I would suggest only slicing the fruit and not adding the extra sugars.  This recipe is a hit with everyone!  Especially my kids!!  My 18 month old wants to eat the salsa with a spoon....as do I ;)

This is a great recipe!  Good even without the raspberries, (I couldn't find them!) It seems to get better as it sits as the flavors blend.  I like it best about 3 days after it's made.

A great hit with the holiday crowd.  Looks festive, and tastes delicious.  The fruits blend well together.  I recommend using cherry preserves.

I made this for our Christmas Eve party, and it was a HUGE hit! I used strawberry preserves, and chilled for a couple of hours.  I made the cinnamon chips right before serving so they were still a little warm.  The mixture of cold fruit and warm chips was amazing.  Everybody loved this, and it was really easy to make.  I am using the leftover fruit (which there was hardly any) as topping for homemade waffles.  I will definitely be making this again!

I just made this for the second time for a ladies lunchoen and it was gone within 10 minutes. I reccomend doubling (if not more) this recipe because it goes so fast. I modified this recipe the following ways; I added a small package of blueberries and blackberries, omitted the sugar and I put half of the strawberries in the food proccesor to give the dip a thicker consistency - I sliced the other half. I used apricot preserves and bought the Pita Cinnamon Chips at Trader Joes. For me this was much neater than making my own chips, less time consuming too. Delicious!

Sooo good. I made this for my son's second birtday party and he got sick so we had to cancel. Needless to say it all got eaten by my husband and myself. Pretty much followed the recipe but took some others advise. Made my own "tortilla chips" and it really wasn't that time consuming. Thank you, turned out great!

huge hit at the party i took this too. i doubled most of the fruit, added in peaches instead of extra straberries (im cheap!) and i kept the sugars the as though it was one normal batch. when i cup up the tortillas, i stuck they in large muffin tins, giving them a kind of scoop effect- make double of the chips, they're delish!

So the apples didn't get brown I cut them up and let them soak in "Sprite" since there is lemon in it.  This doesn't give it a different flavor & cuts down on the oxidation. When I was ready to serve, I drained the apples & mixed them into the salsa.  This is a great recipe & it goes far.

A little time consuming, but worth it!  I cheated and served with store-bought cinnamon pita chips.  I used strawberries, apples, kiwi, and blueberries with sugar-free strawberry preserves.  My guests couldn't get enough!  This would be a nice, healty replacement for syrup over pancakes or waffles, or as a topping for low-fat frozen yogurt.

It was good. Deffinatley cut up fruit by hand. I tried to use our food processor to chop it and it turned the rasberries to mush.

A great summer dessert. I took out the apples and added mango and pineapple for a more tropical taste. Make sure you cook the chips untill they are crunchy or you might end up with a few soggy ones.

I made this today for a church function. The only thing I changed - I didn't add the white sugar and instead of raspberries I used 1/2 bag of frozen peaches that I diced. I used peach preserves. It came out wonderful. And just as all the other reviews said, everyone loved the cinnamon chips. They did turn out good. So this recipe was a complete success. Thanks.

wonderful receipe!  I made this for a 4th of July party and by the time I left the party I had written out the receipe for 6 other people.  Since this was a last minute invite to the party I didnt have time to make the homemade chips, so I stopped at the supermarket and picked up Cinnamon pita chips and they were a huge hit as well.

Wonderful! I also did not add any sugar and subsituted frozen peaches for rasberries. . great suggestion.  I also tried the eggslicer as suggested in one of the reviews- not sure i would use that again or not- i dont know that it saved that much time.  Will make this again and again!

our family loves this, and it's popular wherever we take it! I do not add raspberries (although I will try it that way sometime!), and leave out the white sugar. I add a bit of orange zest and use apricot preserves. I also spray the tortillas with a spritx of olive oil, then the sugar/cinnamon.

This recipe is deserving of more than 5 stars because everyone just loves it.  Both the chips as well as the fruit are excellent.  I cut the strawberries and kiwis into larger pieces and arrange some of the raspberries on top to maximize the attractiveness of the fruit. I add extra kiwi as that color gets a little lost otherwise. I only use one apple and have not had a problem with it turning brown. I think the other fruits as well as the preserves keep it from darkening. You could toss the apple with pineapple or citrus fruit juice to be on the safe side. Then just drain the juice off.  In place of one of the apples, I like to add either a mango, peach or nectarine. I do cut down the sugar quite a bit depending on the sweetness of the fruit I am using. I like to use peach preserves as it does not discolor the fruit. The chips are a little delicate so I store them in a container rather than a baggie. Thank you for such a wonderful recipe.  I have shared this recipe often and have used it on a number of special occasions.

Use real melted butter instead of the flavored spray and brush it on with a pastry brush!  I used the spray and no one ate the first round, but when I made them with real butter people became feinds for it!  I also layered the prepared tortillas then sliced them with a pizza cutter to speed up prep time.  I tried the "muffin tin" suggestion, and while they were more scoopable, they didn't get the bubbly crisp texture that baking them on a flat baking sheet gives.

This recipe is great for summer. I made it with all the fruits listed, but I subbed the raspberries with diced mango. I used strawberry preserves. It was liked by all.

So delicious. I had no problems with mess with the chips. I cut them all with a pizza cutter and placed them on a baking sheet lined with foil. Then I sprayed them all and sprinkled them with the cinnamon sugar. No mess! You don't need the cinnamon sugar on both sides... For the salsa, I tossed the apples in a bit of lemon juice, so no browning. I also used frozen, drained raspberries. So delicious! I took this to a tailgate and everyone raved about it!

I made this for my daughter's 7th birthday party and the kids LOVED it!  I didn't even get a chance to try it, it was gone within the hour!  Our a/c broke, so I didn't want to heat up the oven for the tortilla's, so I used Tostito's Gold (they're less salty to me) heated for a few seconds in the microwave, then sprinkled with cinnamon sugar! AWESOME and EASY!

Wow! This was a major hit at the barbecue I brought it to. Everyone was asking "what is this and who made it?" I even heard a couple of "I can't stop eating this" comments. I went with what looked good at the market for fruits, and used pineapple, mango, strawberries and kiwi with raspberry preserves. I will say it took a lot longer to prepare than I expected with all that peeling and dicing but the flavor was worth it. I also added a bit of lime zest and a squeeze of lime juice. A word of advice about the cinnamon chips (which are awesome!). Use parchment on your baking sheet and cleanup will be easier.

Okay, had this in my recipe box for a few months waiting for strawberry season.  Glad I did!  I halved the recipe, used chopped mandarin oranges in place of raspberries.  I guess since my fresh strawberries were sweet I should have cut back on the sugar but I didn't.  Next time I make this I will.  I did not like the look of the kiwi in this recipe (may be in part that mine was slightly overripe).  I served small portions in dessert cups with the cinnamon chips (recipe from this site) crushed on the top.  It's a keeper!

I've had this recipe sitting in my file for a vary long time - waiting for the perfect time to make.  Well, you can't get any more perfect the Cinco De Mayo!   As I had anticipated it was delicious and very easy.  I used all berries - strawberry, blueberry and raspberry and a few kiwi.  I also served strawberry flavored Cool Whip as the "sour cream" to the salsa and chips.
Refreshing and yummy - can't wait to make again. Thanks!

Really good!  The chips make this dish.  Make them the day before.  I did not add any sugar, and used "no sugar added" strawberry jam.  This was a huge hit - I doubled the recipe for Easter party of 13 people, and it was gone in an hour.  I used blackberries instead of raspberries, and Cortland apples.  The flavors were awesome.

This turned out fabulous! I brought it to a party and people loved it. Instead of making the chips, I bought cinnamon sugar pita chips, and both the salsa and chips got scarfed up fast. I'll definitely make this again!

Essentially a mini fruit salad. There was sooooo much juice coming out of the fruits.  I only added 1.5 tablespoons apple jelly and completely nixed the brown sugar. In the future, I might just add a smidgen of jelly or fruit preserves to meld everything together, but it doesn't really even need it. Very tasty nonetheless. I think I'll try making the cinnamon chips with pita bread next time.

Soooo good. The prep took some time but it was completely worth it.
I can't wait to bring this to summer parties. You could also buy Sunchips cinnomen sugar flavor, which is what I did, although next time I want to make the tortillas myself.

Everyone at the party LOVED this salsa.  I didn't add any sugar and used strawberry jelly.  It was an amazing party dish!  I used butter on tortillas instead of spray, still turned out great.

The new cinnamon Sun Chips work PERFECTLY with this!!!!  My family also likes to use it a topping for ice-cream.  I make them into ice-cubes and put them lemonaid!

Very tasty!  I made it for a Super Bowl Party. the review suggestion about using a chopper made it very quick and easy!  Just be careful not to over chop - the look and texture is better chunky. I didn't make the Cinnamon Chips, but served them with poppy seed crackers. I got several compliments and requests for the recipe.  A few people were simply spooning it into bowls and eating it straight.  We all imagined the many other places that this salsa would be delicious: ice cream, oatmeal, etc.

I love this, and it's a hit whenever I take it somewhere. I mix the sugars and jelly together separately and then add some orange zest and a little fresh orange juice before pouring all over the fruit. So good. Makes my mouth water just thinking about it.

This is an excellent recipe. I used frozen peaches and strawberries and used fresh apples (fuji), and pears. I omitted the kiwis for the time being. I also used strawberry preserves. I did put a little bit of white sugar on the fruit, but will probably omit that the next time b/c it was slightly sweet (but good). 
I bought corn tortillas instead of flour tortillas on accident. The chips tasted fine, but I had to cook them about 15-20 minutes. I like them crunchy and so it took longer to get the crunch I wanted. 
Overall, this is an excellent recipe and I will be making it again.

I have made this recipe several times.  Everyone always loves it and wants the recipe.  I don't change anything.  The salsa is better the second day.  It's a good recipe to make a day ahead.

I just made this today for a dinner I'm going to tonight and oh my gosh is it ever GOOD!!  I used blackberries instead of raspberries because they were cheaper, lower sugar strawberry preserves, a little lime juice, and honey.  I didn't use any of the sugars and it was plenty sweet.  I also bought the new cinnamon Sun Chips to save time and those are fabulous with this.  I'll be making this A LOT!!

Brought it to a gathering and everyone loved it. Really delicious. I went easy on the sugar and it was still super sweet. I used Apricot All-Fruit spread and highly recommend it...was top notch. The home-made cinnamon chips really impressed everyone and I also brought along some Flat Earth fruit chips which were also very nice with the salsa.

A friend brought this to a neighborhood BBQ and I loved it. She told me about allrecipes.com and I've been making it ever since.
My only variation is that I cut all of my chips, lay them on wax paper and spray BOTH sides. Then instead of 'sprinkling' cinnamon sugar on them, I put them in a ziplock bag with cinn/sug and shake it. They end up coming out of the oven so crispy! Everyone asks me to bring this along, now.
I tried frozen raspberries and strawberries, but the recipe always comes out too watery and mushy. So I use fresh always.

We thought that this recipe was just okay.  The fruit was almost candy sweet, especially when combined with the super-sweet cinnamon chips.  It wasn't nearly as refreshing as expected.  I would cut down on the sugar next time.

Like everyone else I found this fantastic!  To save some money (fresh fruit can be expensive!) I used the frozen fruit from the freezer section.  I did use fresh strawberries and kiwis but I put in frozen blueberries, raspberries and peaches.  I didn't use any of the extra sugar and I tell you I'm glad I didn't.  It was perfectly sweet.  The first time I made it I made my own chips but after that I bought store chips.  I found the fresh chips good but time consuming and I couldn't get them consistantly crispy.  
I liked this so much I shared it with my receipe group last month.  Enjoy!

I thought this was a very unique dessert idea. I thought the fruit salsa was too sweet so I would reduce the jam and sugar. The chips were amazing but one tip is do not try this with whole wheat tortillas. I did one batch with the whole wheat to see how they taste but they were no good. So, splurge and eat the regular white ones. I also highly recommend to serve the fruit over vanilla ice cream and stick a few chips out of the top of the ice cream. It makes for a nice presentation and a great mix of flavors.

The fruit salsa was just okay (tasted more like pancake topping to me, to be honest), but I was expecting something more based on all the five-star ratings.  My guests didn't really like it that much.  Too much work to make it again.

OUTSTANDING!!!!!!  I made this for our family Labor Day get together, and it was a huge hit.  I only added 1 TBSP of white sugar, omitted the brown sugar entirely, and it was plenty sweet.  I used strawberries, kiwi, and apples in ours with 3 TBSP Polaner All Fruit Strawberry preserves.  The chips were not hard to make - I used olive oil and brushed it onto each tortilla, stacked them, then cut with a pizza cutter.  Threw the cinnamon/sugar mixture into a ziploc and shook a few tortilla slices around before laying them on a cookie sheet lined with parchment paper.  Next time, I may try a large bowl for coating so I can make sure all of the surfaces get a good dusting of the cinnamon/sugar.  (BTW - you can't taste the olive oil at all once they are baked, and I figure it's better for you than spray out of a can.  :oP)

My mother even asked for this recipe - it's that good.  I plan on taking it to a Ladies' Retreat at church later this month.  

Thanks so much!  This one is going in my permanent file.  :o)

This was a hit.  I made the chips the night before...don't use Weight Watchers butter spray, yucky taste on the chips. After I cut them I put them in muffin tins to bake so they came out curved and easier for dipping in the salsa!  I would suggest halving the recipe for a small crowd...you could use 1/2 the amounts for everything and still have a good amount without wasting. I also replaced blueberries  for kiwis and used one granny smith apple and one golden delicious. Pretty easy and impressed, give it a shot!

Wow!  I follow Weight Watchers, and am  very conscious of "points", so I modified this recipe to use Splenda white sugar and brown, and sugar free black raspberry preserves.  I used Whole Wheat tortillas, with Splenda and cinnamon for on top of the tortillas.  It is awesome!!  Good way to get fruit servings, but not so "pointy" to make it a bad Weight Watcher item.  This tastes incredible!!

HOLY !!  I just made this for my family and it was delicious!  The chips were even great on their own (we snacked while mixing the fruit).  I didn't add any extra sugar and used peach preserves and it came out fantastic.  I also used I Can't Believe It's Not Butter spray and everyone knows you can't go wrong with real butter. ;-)

This was a very good recipe.  It was fun and something different.  I changed a few things though.  I didn't do the apples because I was afraid they would turn brown.  Instead I did diced strawberries, blueberries and kiwi fruit.  I added a bit less sugar than was called for and omitted the preserves.  For the cinnamon chips I didn't have any cooking spray so I brushed melted butter on one side of the tortillas and sprinkled them VERY generously with cinnamon sugar.  I cut them into triangles and baked them until they were golden brown (careful not to over bake.)  I then took whipping cream and added sugar and a touch of  vanilla to it and whipped it up.  This dish looked very pretty with the salsa, whipped cream and chips.  It is a fun dish to bring to a party as an appetizer or dessert.

This was ok, would probably like better on icecream, or in a smoothie. but on the chips this one did not make it at the graduation party, the few that tried it didn't care for it, one thought it would be ok on pancakes.

Incredible!! Made this for our staff coffee and it was the hit of the breakfast!! I had to make copies of the recipe for everyone. I did cut up the tortillas and instead of brushing them I sprayed them with Pam and then shook them in a ziplock bag with the cinn/sugar. What a hit!!

I found this looking for something to take to a cookout.  I read all the reviews.  It was incredible!  I tried to make the chips, but they came out dry.  So I served the salsa in waffle cone bowls - BIG hit.  And I used blueberries, and two small cans of pineapple tidbits.  I get asked to make this often now.  I found store chips that work great too - Stacy's brand, cinnamon sugar pita chips.

I had a poker party this weekend and at the last minute decided to make just the cinnamon chips to throw on a snack platter. Boy did people love them! I didn't have time to make the salsa, but the chips were pretty and I can't help but think how nice they would be at Christmas with the pretty red color of the cinamon sugar. All my guest munched out on these!

What can I say that hasnn't already been said!  The flavor is fantastic.  I used half the sugar.  One of the reviews suggested using an egg slicer to dice the strawberries and kiwi and that was an excellent time saving tip!  This is time consuming but a crowd pleaser.

This was a fabulous hit at our Mother's Day BBQ this year. Everyone loved it and it was so fun to make. The cinnamon chips were so yummy!!! I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for something different that everyone will enjoy eating. Served with whipped cream....

Took this to a 4th of July BBQ. Everyone loved it! The only thing I did different was I used spray butter instead of Pam and shook the tortilla wedges in a baggie with the cinnamon/sugar mixture.

Incredible idea and very versatile.  The chips are perfect just the way they are, and entertaining for the neighbors as they watched me make them outside to cut down the mess in my kitchen.  The sugar is an unecessary addition to the salsa as long as you use a good mix of sweet and sour fruit fruit.  My first batch I used papaya instead of raspberry, and put in raspberry preserves instead.  The second batch I added peaches and sprinkled them with just a dash of key lime juice.  Took both to an art show and had people coming up to me and asking if there was more hidden away somewhere.  Friends a state away heard about it and were calling me for the recipe.  Absolutely marvelous and looks beautiful for a summer event.

I made this while at the beach with 30+ people. It was a favorite of the entire group! To save time, we used Stacy's Cinnamon Pita Chips and I would recommend anyone short on time to do the same. It was wonderful. The next day, we put the leftovers on vanilla icecream and everyone scarfed it down. What a great recipe. Thanks!

I am now the official "Fruit Salsa" queen of all showers and parties. I have now made this about 10 times and every time it has gotten RAVE reviews. I also used regular white corn tortilla chips and sprayed with Pam and Cinnamon. They stay extra crispy! Other than that, I wouldn't change a thing. WOW, what a great recipe! Thanks!

Absolutely wonderful!  People ask me to do this all the time.  Using basically the same recipe, I have used the same amount of apples and kiwi but have changed the raspberries and strawberries and use fresh pineapple and fresh or frozen peaches (I use the recipe amounts for raspberries=pineapple and strawberries=peaches) and then I use orange marmalade or apple jelly for the jam.  I also like to deepfry the tortilla chips instead of baking to give them an extra crisp...taste a lot like elephant ears.  Not as healthy, but oh so very good! (you can coat with sugar/cin. mix warm or cold)

This salsa was great- the ONLY reason why it wasn't a 5 star was because of appearance.  It look red and 'mushy'.  It was very juicy too- could be a good thing or a bad thing depending on your preference.   Though it was crisp and refreshing.  I used kiwis, fuji apples, strawberries, a FEW raspberries.  I added NO SUGAR.  I added a few teaspoons of strawberry no sugar added preserves.

This recipe is FANTASTIC.  As a previous reviewer suggested, I used mini-muffin cups to create more of a "scoop" effect with the chips.  I also coated both sides of the tortillas with cinnamon sugar, making a sweeter, thicker, and more crisp chip; I then left out the sugar in the salsa so that overall it wasn't too sweet.  This recipe was a huge hit; it received many compliments.  One suggestion: you might want to double it!  It goes quickly!!!

This was AWESOME!! I made it for a reception for my 14 year old daughter's school function. Everyone raved about it and wanted the recipe. Who knew that such a simple (yet time consuming) recipe could be so great. I too brushed the tortilla'a with butter and added blueberries, pears, peaches, pineapple, ect...... will definetly be making this again.

AWESOME!  I've been making this for a couple years now.  Easy to make but time consuming with all that dicing especially when making it on a large scale.  I don't find the need for the sugar or preserves but sometimes I taste before I add the sugar and only add if it needs it. Also any combo of fruits seems to be possible.  I generally use apples, grapes, strawberries and kiwi. The cinnamon chips are such a yummy dipping option.  A low cal treat that hits the spot like a fruit pie would! I'm on weight watchers and I can get 12 chips (2 one pt tortillas) and 1/2 cup of the salsa for 3 points!

This recipe was a big hit last night for my women's group.  I used half of the sugar and I did not use the preserves.  I also cut the apples last, and dipped them in a lemon juice and water mixture to prevent them from browning.
The cinnamon chips were the perfect addition to the fruits!  I sprayed them with the cooking oil and cut them, then I put them into a large plastic bag with the cinnamon and sugar mixture and shook until well coated.
I also served mine with whipped cream...yummy!

YUM!!
I added lots more friut to this, but didn't use rasberies as I don't like them.
I used Mango,Pineapple, Kiwi, Strawberry, Apples,(1fugi&1Grannysmith).  I didn't add any preserves.  I enjoyed the fresh brightness from the fruit and thought the preserves wern't needed.  I used the new "flat Earth" apple cinnamon adn the Mixed berry chips!  Excellent!!

Absolutely amazing!  Made it for Mexican themed housechurch dinner and it was gobbled up in no time with tons of requests for recipe!  Substituted 1 can crushed pineapples for expensive raspberries and used blackberry preserves.  Bon Appetit!

Great recipe. I spritzed the chips with water instead of the butter flavored spray. The chips didn't get tough as a few reviewers mentioned, and the water helped the cinnamon sugar stick.

Wonderful recipe! So light and perfect for a spring or summer bbq. I'm using the leftovers on waffles, in oatmeal, and i even put some in the blender with extra strawberries, lemon juice, a spoonful of strawberry yogurt and some ice and made an awesome smoothie.

This was excellent! I made it yesterday for a cinco de mayo party and it was a hit!! I put alot of the reviews together and this is what I came up with-I used 12 inch flour tortillas and cut them  in half and then did triangle cuts which actually ended up w/alot, but the perfect size.  Next time I won't get so many unless I want some left over, in which I had today along w/extra dip I saved and the whole thing was awesome (I think better than yesterday) .  So, I used spray butter on one side and then cut them w/a pizza cutter which made it so easy and sprinkled w/already mixed from the store cinnamon sugar.  Baked at 350 degrees for 8 min. in muffin pans which was perfect.  I stored them in a plastic bag because I did this early in the morning to get it out of the way.  I used 1 lb. strawberries, 2 kiwis, 1 mango, 1 container blueberries, and 1 fugi apple mixed w/ a couple of spoonfuls of strawberry preserves and about a half cup of brown sugar (I didn't add the white) and it was EXCELLENT!!  Everyone raved about it and also complimented me on cutting my fruit so small (which didn't take that long) because it went perfect w/the chips!! Def. make this again and again, but might experiment next time and keep trying diff. fruit to have options!! Thanks!!

It was dee-lish. Followed the recipe exactly except added fresh blueberries and halved the jam and sugars. 

It took a lot longer than 45 minute to make. Baking the chips took the most time because you could only fit so many on a cookie sheet at one time.

I have been making this salsa for years and it has always been a big hit.  It is usually the item I am asked to bring to a party.  However, I use granny smith apples (not as sweet), strawberries, kiwi, and any other good, fresh fruit I can find, ie, pineapple, nectarines, peaches.  I also use apple jelly, a little brown sugar (1Tbsp) (or the brown sugar/splenda mix - approx 1 tsp), orange zest and a little juice/pulp from that orange.  I also spray the tortillas with water (not butter or butter spray), sprinkle with the cinnamon sugar and bake.  My kids love the chips by themselves.  I think I will try the "scoop" method though.  It will probably hold the salsa better.

Ummm, maybe I made these wrong, but they didn't turn out very well at all!  I took them to an event and was quite embarassed by the way they looked and tasted.

A perfect recipe! Choping the fruit was a little work but well worth it. Used orange marmalade for the fruit perserves.  Used the suggestion from another reviewer and sprayed both side of the tortillas, then sliced into wedges and placed in a large plastic bag containing the cinnamon sugar and shook up. Then I placed them on a pan to bake. Quick and easy. This is sooo good!

After reading about 100 reviews, decided to make this prior to serving it to some friends. I used strawberries, apples (1 granny smith, 1 red delicious) an asian pear, 2 kiwi, and blueberries, only 1 tbsp. brown sugar, and 3 tbsp. apricot preserves. It really was good! ( I used the 'Vidalia Chop Wizard' I had just bought and really decreased the chopping time) The chips turned out okay, baked at 400 for 4-5 min. as one reader suggested...but I think I need to experiment some more with my oven's temp. and time. It is a cool and refreshing recipe..I will serve it as an appetizer at my get-together!

This is AWESOME!  Easy & delicious!  I am convinced that you can use whatever fruit that you have on hand and it will turn out great!  I have made it several times for company and they always ask for the recipe!!  I personally usually start with berries and work from there.  The tortilla chips are great too!  I love that they are baked!  You will NOT be disappointed!!! Enjoy!

TO DIE FOR!!!  If you want to serve something people will really enjoy...this is it!  Thank you for sharing.  Next time I am going to cut down to 1 tbls on the perserves and just sprinkle with sugar and brown sugar....only because I am trying to cut back- and I don't think with all these delicious fruits you are going to miss the sugar.Loved he chips too!!

Best.  Salsa.  Ever.  I received nothing but enormous praise after fixing this and serving it to a group of my girlfriends.  With a bit of tweaking, this is perfect for the cinnamon chips, ice cream, cheese cake, and even added into a nice cold glass of sangria.

This was a total hit at my parent's superbowl party.  A nice change from the typical offerings and better for you than other desserts.  I used golden delicious apples, blueberrys, strawberrys, and hot peach preserves.  The chips and chopping were a bit time consuming but definitely delicious and worth it!

it was ok. it didn't really do anything for me. It was a bit to sweet, but i think it would be better if you put it in a food processor to blend up more so the flavors really mix up and definately add alot more of a variety.

I made this recipe when I was having some friends over for a small get together. Everybody loved it! I made some extra chips and it still wasn't enough. Next time I will probably more than double the amount of chips that the recipe calls for. I made the recipe exactly as it calls for and it was great. Next time, just for fun, I may try addding some other kinds of fruit. Maybe bananas or some melon. My guests raved about it all night long! I will definitely be making this recipe again and again.

just another echo... great recipe for the superbowl party.  i did the tortillas like others, coating whole tortillas in a ziploc, stacking and cutting, no re-spraying.  i also stuck them in my muffin tins for sbout seven minutes, then flipped them onto a baking sheet for another three or four minutes.  they're just like low fat churros!  i also left the sugar out of the salsa, but i did use frozen raspberries and a handful of frozen blueberries.  this recipe is brilliant!

I made this for a super-bowl party last night, and it turned out great! Everyone loved it and wanted the recipe. I took some of the other reviewers' advice on the cinnamon chips, such as buttering both sides of the tortillas first, then adding the cinnamon-sugar, and stacking them up to cut several at a time (after the sugar and butter were already on them). Also, I did not re-spray after coating them with sugar; they did not need it. I also agree with other reviewers that there is no need to add sugar to the salsa - the fruit is sweet enough as-is. Finally, I substituted one mango for the apples - a must-try in my opinion!

I made this for a family gathering and they just loved it.  Instead of the preserves, I used peach pie filling.  It came out a little thicker than the first time I made it and it stayed on the chip better.

I only made the cinnamon chips from this recipe and they were soo good!  I knew someone who would make chips exactly like this and bring it to potlucks and events.  I also thought they were really good but never asked for the recipe.  Thanks soo much for sharing.  This recipe is definitely a keeper!

Absolutely delicious! I had to alter the recipe a bit due to the unavailability of fruit in the winter season in Nebraska. I used 1 bag of frozen berry blend (strawberries, cherries, blackberries, raspberries, and blueberries), 2 braeburn apples, 1 bartlett pear, apricot preservers, and the rest the same as the recipe. I was surprised at the large amount that it made. I save half and used it with yogurt, ice, and fruit juice in smoothies. It was fabulous both ways. I will make this again!

This was a really great recipe, and so easy.  I used frozen raspberries and strawberries and apricot preserves.  Everything else I followed exact. Everyone loved it, I will make this a lot in the summer!

I am a dedicated fruit-salad-hater, so I thought for sure I would not like this recipe at all.  Boy, was I wrong!  I practically growled at people to keep them away from this when my sister made it for our holiday celebration, and have already made it once myself.  It is SO adaptable if you have more fruits you want to add, or you want to use frozen berries instead of paying $10 for strawberries and a dinky container of raspberries.  I added a pear, frozen peaches, and blurberries to the recipe, andit was fabulous.  Making more tonight and tomorrow for myself and another get-together.  Yum!!!!

This was a hit at a pot-luck Christmas party. I noticed several people who went back for 2nd's and 3rd's just on this.  My pregnant sister couldn't stop eating it, out of compassion I gave her the leftovers.  Very easy to adapt to your taste.

This recipe is crowd favorite.  The only change I made was using butter instead of cooking spray.  It adds fat, but it is worth it :-)

This recipe is always a huge hit at any gathering.  I don't use raspberries in mine.  It also tastes great as an alternative to syrup on pancakes.  It's just an all-around refreshing treat. Easy to make and delicious to eat!!

Great recipe. I forgot to buy kiwi's so used 1 1/2 cups grapes instead - worked beautifully. I chopped all fruit very small w/ pampered chef chopper (smaller than shown in pics for this recipe); this made for an easily dippable salsa. I chose black raspberry perserves = delicious.  Big hit at dinner party but recommend making extra chips.

Was the hit of our family get-together this weekend. (I chose to use raspberry preserves). I used a biscut cutter to cut the tortilla into 'little tortillas' making eating easier. Was amazing how the fruit took on the appearance of tomatoes, green peppers and onions.

everyone loved this dip!  asked for the recipe many times.  I cut down the sugar and added blackberry jam. Def shake tortillas in bag with sugar and cin.  makes it much easier!  Salsa gets very watery.  Would also be delicious over vanilla ice cream!

I made this weekend for a baby shower, what a hit!  Not sure why recipe calls for 2 cups of cinnamon sugar, I used about 3/4 cup for the chips and had a bunch leftover.

I made this salsa for a party my husband and I attended last night.   Although it doesn't call for placing all the fruit in a processor, that's what I did (chopped just enough to make the fruit pieces a little more manageable to scoop up with the chips).  Everyone raved!  And the cinnamon chips were good enough to eat by themselves.    This recipe was a huge success and I'll definitely make it again.   :-)

This was wonderful and the women at the baby shower couldn't get enough of it! We omitted the raspberries and used all frozen strawberries instead. We used apricot jam. For less mess, we cut the tortillas into wedges and arranged them before spraying them. It didn't matter that one side of the chips were uncoated -- they were plenty sweet and crispy as is. Even the next day they were still pretty good. We used the leftover salsa as a topping on vanilla ice cream, which looked beautiful and tasted heavenly.

I have made this on several occasions and had it requested many times more.  Preparing the tortilla chips is rather time consuming and they are always gone before the salsa is.

I made this for a hair salon's grand opening...all I can say is people came up asking me for the recipe and not about hairstyles, I think that says it all!  The chips aren't that time consuming and are way better then any that come in a bag!  If your going to make it, make it right!

My GAWD is this good!  I know there are way too many reviews already, but I just HAD to add my two cents here.  I have NEVER gotten a reaction as I did with this recipe.  I used apples, and kiwis as called for as well as a mango, fresh pineapple, blueberries, strawberries, and "all fruit" strawberry preserves (the seedless variety; 3 TBSP).  I had to make the chips and salsa the night before, so I sprinkled some lime juice on the apples to prevent browning.  My pineapple turned a purty pink color (after sitting in the fridge with the other fruit all night) and I also waited to add the preserves and sugar (only 1 TBSP of white) until a couple hours before I served.  I used the ole muffin tin (4 minutes at 450 degress) and pizza cutter tricks for the chips, and although it was a bit time consuming, IT WAS WORTH IT!  I stored over night in a big ole zipper bag and simply popped the chips in a micorwave safe bowl for about 30 seconds before serving and they were perfect.  After one bite every person was hooked and everyone wanted the recipe.  AWESOME!  Thanks Annie!!!! You rock!

This is so good! It was gobbled up in about 20 minutes at our family reunion. *A little secret: look in the potato chip isle of your grocery store for cinnamon chips(near the nacho chips). Just as good, but a whole lot easier!

Easy to make and wonderfully yummy.  Left out the preserves.  I also cheated by using the frozen strawberries and raspberries (they were cheaper).  I poured the whole bag in, including the juices.  Let chill overnight in fridge and strained the next day.  My family liked it so much I had to hand over the recipe!!!  One last thing, be sure to use FLOUR TORTILLAS, not corn.  Both cook well, but the flour ones are way more crispy.  Corn just tastes stale.

Great! I use this with the recipe also on this site called Fluff Dip (with vanilla pudding, whipped topping, and Amaretto etc). I make the cinnamon chips by using real melted butter and brush the tortilla with a pastry brush before baking, then I sprinkle Cinnamon-Sugar on top before baking (I also cut them into wedges before baking). I also just use cut up fresh fruit along with the Fluff Dip, and serve it like chips and dip and salsa, OR I have baked a tortilla whole (spread with butter and cinnamon sugar), then when it cooled I layered on Fluff Dip and put cut fruit on top of that for a "fruit pizza". I like strawberries, mango, blueberries, pineapple and melon the best. YUM. But this recipe is great as-is also!

What a hit!  I adjusted because I used frozen strawberries and raspberries, (drained them REALLY well, left out the raspberry jam)but it was still great!  Served it at two parties, and got asked for the recipe both times!

WOW....this recipe was awesome. I made it for my twins b-day party and everybody loved it. I added a few blueberries to it to give some color, used apricot preserves, and cut the sugar in half and it was fabulous. I saw where some had complained about the chips getting stale but if you put them in the microwave for a few seconds their as good as right out of the oven. Thanks for a great recipe Ann.

I have made this recipe countless times, everyone loves it!  I find that using frozen raspberries, drained, instead of fresh is easire & cheaper.  I use Blackberry jam, I think it adds a nice flavor.  Also, using an egg slicer/wedger for the kiwi & strawberries really cuts down on prep time.  Just use it very slowly & carefully with the strawberries. I've made this a day or two in advance and had no problems.

Used frozen berry mix, added a delicious apple just before serving, used no sugar added apricot jam for the preserves, only 1 tbsp of brown sugar twin and no white sugar (more diabetic friendly). Made the tortillas in muffin tins, to create scoops, only sprayed them once, both sides.  Excellent, all at the party wanted the recipe!!!

Excellent!  A hit with kids and adults.  My 3 yr old enjoyed helping make the chips.  This recipe is very versatile...can use fresh or frozen fruit.

Great recipe, thanks!  I used blueberries, strawberries, kiwi, apples, orange marmalade, and only 1 tablespoon of white sugar.  No brown sugar.  The cinnamon chips were a big hit!  I baked them in a muffin baking pan like someone else suggested and they got a great scoop shape.

This was very good, I would recommend making the chips before the salsa because it takes a while.  Thanks for the great recipe!

If you like fruit, you will love this recipe!  Make sure you let it sit to give the salsa time to mix.  I used frozen strawberries and raspberries and it took awhile for them to mix and thaw. Definitely the best!!!  Thanks for sharing the recipe.

A wonderfully delicious and healthy new addition to my recipe box. Any fruit will do, and no extra sugar was needed, although I did add some apricot preserves. The chips were also good. I used whole wheat tortilla's, just as good as regular ones, but healthier. I used splenda instead of regular sugar and no one could tell the difference. I sprayed the tortillas very lightly and the splenda/cinnamon mixture adhered well enough. And thanks to other reviews for the tool suggestions of pizza cutter, muffin tins and Ziploc bag, it really cut this otherwise time consuming recipe down quite a bit. My family wants me to make this again this weekend. *****

Very good. However, it takes a LONG time to dice everything by hand. I added 1 cup of cinnamon sugar to the mixture and it added just that something extra. YUMMY

Absolutely delicious!  Not only did it look fantastic, but it tasted fantastic as well!!  My tortillas came out nice and crispy.  I didn't have butter falvored spray, so I brushed melted butter on the chips and it worked great.  I served this at a small gathering and everyone asked for the recipe.

This is a great, easy recipe! I've brought it to a few gatherings now and received rave reviews. The fruit salsa is very versatile - can use lots of variations of fruit, preserves, etc. and it still turns out great. A nice change from the usual party snacks.

Made this for a baby shower last Saturday.  Was the biggest hit!  I doubled the portion, and it was completely gone by the end of the shower.  Just AWESOME!  Didn't have cinnamon sugar, so we mixed cinnamon powder and brown sugar, then sprinkled onto the chips.  It's better to bake the chips for longer so they're cripy.

I really liked this recipe. I made more chips and left out the preserves, as suggested in many of these reveiws. To make my salsa a little more like salsa and less like pico de gallo, I pureed about 3/4 the fruit and left the other part in as chunks. I also added just a little crushed pineapple. YUMMY

This recipe did require a lot of prep time... but it was worth it.  I let my 5 yr old daughter help make the chips.  We melted butter and she brushed it on the tortilla shells.  I cut them with a pizza cutter and then we placed them in a bowl with a lid and she shook it up to coat with the cinnamon/ sugar mixture!  I took it to a Father's Day cookout and almost everyone loved it!  Thanks for the great recipe.

I've made this twice so far.  I used less cinnamon sugar than was called for.  I used apricot preserves.  This was a huge hit at both a baby shower and an office party.

Mmmmmmmmm...  I made this for a potluck at work and there were only a few chips, (I doubled up on those), and very little fruit salsa left over.  I personally didn't find this difficult to prepare at all!  I used some of the other helpful tips and applied them to my task.  Especially handy was the use of a pizza cutter for the tortillas, and the use of the muffin tins for baking the chips.  I used a food processor for chopping the fruit, and substituted blueberries for the rasberries, but left them whole since they are so small already.  It added a nice color to it.  Instead of sprinkling the cinnamon-sugar on the tortillas, I shook a few at a time in a ziplock bag which cut the time down.  The longest time in the prep work was the chip baking, and that was only because I could only bake 24 at a time due to the fact that I was limited to my muffin tins.  But I must say it was worth it!  Some of my coworkers thought I bought the chips since they looked so *professional* looking---and tasty!!  I printed out the recipe and gave out all of the ones I had, and now I need to make more since I had added requests!  I will make this again, and again!

This salsa is absolutely delicious. I substituted blueberries for the raspberries and used fructose instead of the sugar and it was wonderful. I also added a can of crushed pineapple to help keep the apples from turning brown. This was a huge hit with my family, my young boys just gobbled it up. This is a great way to get your kids to eat their fruit.

Fantastic! Hubby and I devoured these. I didn't have any apples and I don't like raspberries, so I substituted pears and mangoes, skipped the preserves and squirted liberal amounts of fresh lemon juice over it. Also, I split the cinnamon chips in batches - one batch sprayed after dredging through cinnamon sugar, and one batch unsprayed after dredging. The unsprayed batch was much crisper. Overall, it is a delicious way to use up the fresh fruit and can definitely be experimented with (although I wouldn't recommend adding bananas, as they turn mushy and ick when left to sit in juices).

This was pretty good. I halved the recipe and used less sugar/preserves than needed. It was tart yet sweet.

The chips were good as well.

Overall a tasty treat that I will try again sometime.

Great low-fat snack for a crowd.  Like many of the others, I took this to a class--everyone loved it.  I used the frozen "berry mix" and it turned out fine, but fresh berries probably would have been even better.  I think it tastes best fresh--it gets a little weepy if you let it sit for a while.

Very tasty. I did not use the kiwis, mainly because I was too lazy to go to the store and get them. Instead, I used only: strawberries, raspberries, apples, and peaches, with 1 tsp. of white sugar. No preserves, no brown sugar. I thought it tasted great, but perhaps a bit too sweet. I liked the cinnamon chips and I thought the combination was awesome. Perfect afternoon snack. Thanks Annie!

I made this and took it to work on a special "Fiesta Day". It went over SO well!! We all decided that the chips would be really good with coffee the next morning, so we gave it a shot. YUMMM!!! Have made it two other times since. Thanks so much!

This recipe is absolutely delicious!  We had extra tortillas and after tasting one chip I used up all the extras so I would have some for the next couple days.  Because strawberries and raspberries are out of season here, I used a one pound bag of mixed berries to replace those.  Definitely something to take to a party!

like everyone else this recipe was a hit at the party I took it to.  I made the chips the night before and the salsa I made the morning of the party. I did notice the next day that the salsa does become pretty sweet after sitting so I probably wouldn't use that much sugar. Everyone wanted the recipe!!!! Yummmmmm!

I made this to take to a party and everyone seemed to enjoy it.  (Especially the chips!)  I found it fairly easy to make, a little time consuming, yes, but what do you expect when you chop that much fruit.  Also, the tortillas are easier to cut with a pizza slicer.  I cut mine just like a pizza.  Thanks for the great recipe Annie!

The fruit salsa was EXCELLENT!  We used the leftovers as a topping for vanilla ice cream!  It was even better than with the chips!  I didn't add the fruit preserves, as the sugar sweetened it up enough.  WILL MAKE THIS AGAIN... as an ice cream topping!!

I really liked this but found that it did get a bit soupy later in the night. Used blackberry preserves. Kids liked it but enjoyed the chips more. Made more of those the same afternoon because first batch was almost gone before our potluck.

This recipe was a big hit at a BBQ that I went to. I made the salsa the night before and found it even better the next day.  I also added crushed pinapple to it, I noticed that with all the fresh fruit and pinapple I didn't have to add as much jam to it.  I also use a chopper to cut chop up the fruit.  That cut the time in half.  Though I think I might of chopped them a little to small, but still it turned out excellent.  I also couldn't decide on what flavor jam to use so I used both Strawberry and Aprcoit. I also found with this salsa recipe you don't have to follow it exactly and you can add other fruits to it. My oldest daughter loved the salsa, but my two other didn't care for it, but they loved the chips.  I found that if you use a pizza cutter for cuting the tortilla's it goes by much faster, I could cut 4 at a time.  I also used I cannot beleive it is Butter spray instead of Pam butter spray.  they turned out great.  I know I will make this again and again for BBQ's and parties. Thank you.

These are terrific!   I agree with all the other comments, but would add that it took me about 1.5 total to cut up all the fruit and tortillas and 2 cups of cinnamon sugar was more than I needed and I didn't skimp!  You'd be okay with 1-1/3 cups! 
I added blueberries instead of rasberries and threw in a mango because they were on sale.

I took this to a potluck tonight and it was the hit of the evening.  Several people asked for the recipe and there sure weren't any leftovers to take home!  I used kitchen shears to cut up the tortilla chips and it was fast and easy.  Great recipe!  Thanks.

oh, my stars and garters! made the chips at my girlfriend's yesterday...kids (ages 1-8) couldn't keep their paws off them and neither could we! didn't feel like going through the fuss of salsa, so we just mixed thawed frozen berries into cool whip. AWESOME! can't wait to try the salsa! chips were so easy my THREE YEAR OLD helped! already in my REAL recipe box as well as my gf's and our mutual friends!

This was GREAT!  PLEASE do not skip the cinnamon chips, they are incredible.  We made the recipe exactly as written (which is unusual for me, I usually make at least a few changes!), and it was perfect.  It was a big hit at a potluck that we had here at the house.  I would definately suggest letting this sit in the fridge for AT LEAST the recommended 3 hours, it allows the salsa to aquire a lot of nice juices.  The chips ARE good enough to eat by themselves, but went so well with the salsa that we only had a bit of the salsa leftover.  Thanks for an INCREDIBLE recipe.  This got raves from all, and was a very different dish than is normally seen at a potluck (or any function).  Really appreciate you sharing.

The chips are a winner! Was doing great, even on it's own. I made too much salsa though.The chopping was quite a lot of work and when the salsa was left to stand it got real watery, not an appetizing sight.

This is very tasty, maybe a little sweet, but took alot longer than 15 minutes to dice everything small enough. I cut strawberries up (recipie doesn't say whether to do that or not.)So definately allow more time than recipie says!  ALSO a quick tip, cut your tortillas into wedges with a roller type pizza cutter...you can do several at a time.  Can't wait to bring this to work and get everyones opinion!  I love it! ALSO regarding the chips, i ran out of cinnimon so had them cut up and left them lay out all afternoon....they were drying out and feeling crispy without cooking....because of this, when I did get them made they were VERY crispy!

I used this for a group of about 16 people and received rave all evening. I added to the fruit salsa some frozen blueberries and a can of mandarin oranges, which I cut up. The citrus seemed to add a nice flavour.

Excellent!  This has been a big hit with my friends and family.  The salsa has also just the right "tang" to top hot slices of glazed ham.

Delicious -- a hit with my family and at parties. I added blueberries because they're my son's favorite. Substituting cinnamon graham crackers also works well for the tortilla chips.

I made this for the Super Bowl this year and everyone LOVED it. It was fresh tasting and light - not super sweet, and a perfect foil for the heavier foods that were served. Really good; I highly recommend and I will be making this again and again.

Fruit was delicious. Big hit at the party. Cinnamon chips were good also BUT since then I've found that they just started making them to buy so I'll do that next time to save time. But they are still delicious!!! Great recipe.

I have made this several times and it's always a HUGE hit!  The first time I made the tortillas, but the last few times I have used Stacy's Cinnamon Pita Chips and those are great.  Excellent summer party dish!

I made this for my daughter's dance team and there was NOTHING left at the end of the day!  Kids and adults both loved it!  I read some of the reviews before making it and left out the sugar.  It was plenty sweet without it.  I also sprayed the tortillas with cooking spray and shook them in a freezer bag with the sugar and cinnamon.  I think this allowed for more even coating of the chips.  Slicing up the fruit is pretty time consuming and I would recommend using a food chopper or egg slicer.  Great recipe and I will make it again!

This fruit salsa is very good, but I advise against making it up too much ahead of time.  The chopping, and then the refrigeration of the fruit change the look and texture...Ie...after a while it no longer looks "fresh" but starts to breakdown and get soft.   I will make this again but only allow minimal refrigeration time.  
I used seedless red raspberry preserves and thought that was a nice addition to kind of pull the fruit blend together.  I did not use any extra sugar since my fruit was wonderfully sweet.  I also chose not to use apples since I didn't want the crunch of one fruit mixed into the softness of the other fruits.  Personal preference!
I chose to use the Stacy cinnamon and sugar pita chips but I won't do that again,  They are too thick, and I thought that they overpowered the lightness of the fruit.  I will either make my own chips as the recipe suggests or find another option to dip the fruit.

This was delicious! I made a few changes after reading some of the reviews...

First, we used Fuji apples instead of Golden Delicious, because they don't brown as quickly. 
I also used 4 oz. raspberries and 4 oz. peaches (instead of just 8 oz. raspberries.) 
I used orange marmalade for the preserves.
I would cut the sugar in half (it was quite sweet.)
For the chips, I simply sprayed both sides of the tortilla, and then I sprinkled cinnamon sugar on top. (I did NOT spray it again.) Then I baked them at 350 degrees for 10 minutes, turning the pan around halfway through baking so that the ones in the back of the oven didn't brown too quickly.
Delicious, but because of the few changes I gave it 4 stars instead of 5. Super yummy!

This is a phenomenal recipe!  So simple and so tasty!  I'm always looking for simple throw-together appetizers to serve at home party get togethers (like 31 Bag parties or Partylite parties).  This fits the bill!  At first I cut the tortillas in wedges before spraying, but then I got wise and followed the other reviewers suggestions and sprayed both sides of the whole tortilla with cooking spray, then dredged both sides in cinnamon-sugar.  I put my cinnamon sugar in a pie pan and that worked really well for dredging the tortillas.  I found that 8-9 minutes was the perfect timing for the chips.  The salsa was delish too!  I didn't add any sugar and used my homemade strawberry jam as the preserves.  My kids especially loved this dish!  It's definitely a keeper!

I follow the recipe exact, but use only Brown sugar (and not 3 tbsp) in fruit and used melted, real butter and brushed it on the tortillas instead of spray.

Made this dish today, it went over GREAT with my family. The kids loved it, even my husband liked it. I used real butter on the cinnamon chips, I tried it with the cooking spay but I didn't like the taste, real butter taste better to my family.I used a strawberry preserve, it went great.

I love this recipe.  I have made it many times.  I feel like every ingredient is essential.  I follow the recipe for the fruit salsa to a tee.  Its amazing.  Solicit some help in chopping fruit, make it a family activity.  Don't judge me, I fry the tortillas for the chips.  Cause fried flour tortillas are one of life's little pleasures that makes me happy.

nice dish. I substituted whole wheat tortillas, which I think have a little more flavor, and used brown sugar and honey instead of using white sugar.  I also added a little lemon juice to the fruit to help balance the sugars. Agave syrup would also be nice.  a nice finger food for a party.

I was surprised that my entire family, including myself, disliked the blend of the favors in this recipe.  I ended up serving the chips with homemade chunky warm applesauce and made crepes which I filled with devon custard and the fruit salsa.  All was not lost and I got a five star rating for my crepes.

Yum! I made this tonight. Having read through a lot of the reviews to see what other people had done, I also left out the sugar, and next time, I'll make the chips either with very little or no sugar, too. The fruit is sweet enough on its own. 

I used raspberries, strawberries, blueberries, mango, golden delicious apples, and kiwi, and a large tablespoon of apricot preserves (yeah, I didn't measure... just scooped some out of the jar with a regular tablespoon).  I chopped the apples last after having squeezed a lime half over the cutting board, and kept squeezing lime over the apples as I chopped. And then when everything was mixed, I squeezed all the juice left in the lime halves over the bowl, and next time, will use two limes, and might omit the preserves.

Mango is really good in this, and mint would be a great addition, too. I was too hungry to run outside to pick some tonight; I just wanted to sit down with a bowl of this in one hand and chips in the other and chow down.

This has been one of my go-to summer recipes for entertaining since I discovered it here several years ago. It is a real crowd pleaser yet is usually something your guests have never tried before. It is also a very forgiving recipe in that you can utilize pretty much any fruit you have available. I agree with other reviewers in that the fruit is best cut fairly small so that it still has texture but is easy to dip.

I only used a tablespoon of brown sugar and two tablespoons of honey instead of preserves. Also sprinkled tortilla with just cinnamon and used whole wheat tortillas. Just a few ways to cut back the sugar, it was still wonderful and I will make the tortilla chips this way from now on!

I made the chips and thought oh these are good. (I did not use cooking spray because I am trying to get away from them so I have another recipe that says just to spray water and sprinkle cinn/sugar.)
BUT when paired up with the fruit they were even better. I did not add any additional sugar, to me fruit doesn't need it. Not sure how or why it could be better but I highly recommend this for a light snack.

I agree with others who say it's a bit sweet, but I would definitely make it again! I made it for a Valentine's Day Party and used a heart shaped cookie cutter to make the cinnamon chips shaped like hearts. I used raspberry preserves.  While I cut the apples, I had a bowl filled with 1/2 orange juice and half water nearby and soaked them for a few minutes to prevent browning.  Overall it's delicious, simple, and an inexpensive way to bring fruit to a party!

I loved this one too!  I made this for a church group and the bowl was scraped until gone!  It made a good amount so I was pleased about that.  I left out the sugars and used raspberry jam.  I also used the pampered chef chopper and I made this in 10 mins.  I also got the cinnamon pita chips from Trader Joe's to save some time and they were great!  Thanks for the recipe!  I will be making this again, maybe for Easter.

I used appricot preserves and it was yummy!  I also just used regular cooking spray instead of butter flavored for the tortillas.  This makes a lot so I am going to cut it in 1/2 next time.

Just made this using blueberries, strawberries, apples, mandarin oranges with strawberry and huckleberry jam... that's what I had on hand. I didn't measure anything really, just threw it all in together and it was great!

I use a little less jam/sugar otherwise it can get too watery and hard to eat. Everyone loved it and it's a great healthy alternative (and perfect for summer!)

I didn't have time to make the chips so I bought some (they weren't good). I got mixed reviews on this. Some really liked it and others either didn't or found it just ok. I will keep the recipe but will likely make only a small amount in the future.

Delightful and it LOOKS so pretty! Omitted the sugar entirely. It's FRUIT after all! Plenty of natural sweetness, especially when added with the Cinnamon Sugar Chips.

This was sooo good!  We made it for a baby shower and only put a tiny bit of brown sugar (no white sugar) and it was perfect.  Also, we made it the night before and the shower was at 2 the next afternoon and it was fine.  We followed the reviews and saved the apples and only cut them just before the shower.  We used gala apples and cut them pretty small.  I'm not sure that you would've been able to tell if they were brown with all of the red that was going on in the dish, but it was very pretty and it was so yummy!  I had 3 people ask for the recipe and there were only about 15 people there, so you know it was great. Definitely a keeper for the recipe box!  Oh, and we used apricot jelly.  Didn't have preserves onhand.  The flavor was great (strawberry would've been too much, I think) and it helped give it that salsa texture.

This turned out really well. I followed the recipe exactly except I halved the white sugar and used I can't believe its not butter spray instead of butter flavored cooking spray.  I sprayed both sides of the tortillas and they ended up getting kind gummy when I baked them, so I would only do one side.

Delicious. I took other suggestions and omitted the sugar from the fruit - it didn't need it. I used Fuji apples, sprinkled with lemon juice, and had no problems with browning. The cinnamon chips were also a big hit. I tried dipping them in the cinnamon sugar and found them tasty by themselves but too sweet with the fruit so the second time around I just sprinkled the tortillas with the cinnamon sugar and it was a perfect combo with the fruit.

This was a pretty good recipe, although probably not one I will make again. LOVED the chips, did what most recommended and sprayed both sides with Pam first. I also used a pizza cutter to slice the tortillas, which made things easier.  The salsa, was ok.  I used raspberry preserves, and added mango, but that made it too mushy.  The salsa was runny and way too sweet. I should've followed the advice of other readers and omitted the sugar, but wanted to try it first with it. I will definitely make the chips again, but I doubt I'll make the salsa.

Well, based on the number of five-star ratings, I obviously did something wrong.  The salsa was okay; the chips were barely okay.  I love the concept and will likely try again, but will make a half recipe.  I think the preserves are unnecessary and interfere with the fresh factor.  (If I'm going to the trouble and expense of using fresh throughout...)   I tasted this before and after adding the preserves, and before was much better.

Such a wonderful fruit salsa.  My daughter has made it several times for functions.  It always a hit and the recipe always requested.

First, let me say the chips were excellent.  I took the idea of spraying the whole tortilla on both sides, sprinkling with a generous amount of sugar and cinnamon, baking about 9 min, then cutting it into triangles.  Everyone loved them.  Second, the fruit salsa left a bit to be desired.  My grocery store didnt have all the fruits; I diced up strawberries, blueberries, and Fuji apples (as recommended by a reviewer) and apricot preserves (also recommended).  Didnt add extra sugar to the fruit (as recommended) because I didnt want it mushy.  It was anyway.  Maybe a sugar free preserve would help?  Everyone liked it enough to eat it, but they werent wild about it.  The colors were good - red, white, and blue - for Memorial Day.  Would make the chips again, but probably not the salsa.  Would probably try a different recipe.  Thanks, though!

This was great. Everyone took a bite, and looked at me funny, as if to say, "I'll eat this because you worked so hard on it, but it's a bit odd...". I went to clean up the kitchen, and turned around, and it was GONE. I had to make more cinnamon chips and replenish the fruit salsa. I didn't have butter flavored spray, so I used some butter and it turned out great. Served this with bagels and coffee in the morning. It was yummy....! Awesome recipe- never would have thought of such a simple and delicious concept! Next time will try it without the added sugar, and just the fruit preserves.

I made this yesterday as an alternative to the usual junk food we tend to snack on around the pool. I figured the chips, would go fast but didn't have high hopes for the salsa. I was shocked, even the pickiest of the ten kids we had over loved the salsa, they ate every bit of it and I had chips left over and I only baked 8 tortilla's. I did exchange blueberries for the raspberries but that was the only change I made in the recipe. I'm sure I will be making this all summer! What a great find!

I made this for a group of ladies and they loved it ... they all wanted the recipe... I did change a couple things... I didnt add anything besides the fruit to the salsa... no sugar at all and it was perfectly sweet... and if you put 2 apples don't get big huge ones because they will take over the salsa :) I also brushed olive oil on the tortillas instead of spraying butter flavored oil... they were perfect ... Enjoy it is a keeper

Added no extra sugar to the fruit.  Sprayed only one side of each tortilla.  I think that the raspberries really made the difference in taste. Absolutely the best and so easy!

I took this to work and it was gone in a flash. My coworkers were like little scavengers trying to get every last drop. I added blueberries and blackberries. I doubled the fruit preserves, using boysenberry and orange marmalade. I did not add any additional sugar. I also made a double batch of the cinnamon chips. Delish! Will definitely be making this again....maybe served on angel food cake. (One other tip, a coworker suggested putting some vodka in and making it a smoothie. Gonna try that one too!)

I would give this 10 stars if poss!!! So very yummy!  I took it to work for snack day and it was a huge hit!! Everyone wanted recipe!! I like how it is very versatile.  I did change it a little from others suggestions, such as added 1 TBSP cornstarch to sauce, blackberries instead of raspberries because raspberries were too expensive and gala apples instead of golden delicious.  I will make it all the time this summer for many BBQ's and great for brunch, showers etc.  Thanks again for great recipe

So wonderful! I definitely didn't chop the fruit small enough though. Next time I will put it into my food processor just until it is in tiny chunks so it feels more like salsa and less like fruit salad. I made one for my family and another for some friends and everyone loved it!

Great appetizer for a spring/summer party.  I have made this recipe several times and my family loves it, especially the chips!  I add a tablespoon of lemon juice and a little lemon zest to keep everything fresh.  It is also great with a little mint thrown in.  I also add a teaspoon of corn starch to hold everything together and keep the fruit salsa from getting too juicy.

This is delicious.  Served with store-bought cinnamon pita chips.  Note - this makes a lot.   But, it can be served with the chips, over ice cream or just with a spoon.  Thanks for the refreshing and delicious recipe.

What a cool idea for an appetizer.  We are always having salty/savory snacks and I found this and thought it was time for a change.  The family loved it. I made it exactly as written the night before a party and upon first taste test thought it was way too sweet.  I actually had planned to add more fruit before serving.  Second taste test was totally different after sitting over night.  It was great and even better the next day.  Give it a try!

I first used this last year at a church ladies retreat.. there was none left! I did change it up a bit tho... I used more fruit.. that way it wasn't too sweet. 2 Granny Smith Apples, 2 Braeburn Apples, the raspberries, strawberries, and instead of kiwi's, I used a nectarine and a plum. Turned out amazing! If you slice your apples and let them set in lemon juice a few minutes, you won't have them turning brown. Enjoy!

Delicious! Instead of using fresh berries I used frozen ones(just let them sit until they thaw out) and opted not to use sugar.  The sweetness from the cinnamon tortilla chips paired with the fruit (with some fruit preserves mixed in) was perfect.  I also added diced banana which was a nice addition to the fruit medley.  Also, try using the fruit salsa as a topping over plain yogurt if you have any leftover.  Yum!

Dang it..... We had Easter early and I was short on time. I had to choose to make this or the Snickers Cheesecake (which also got rave reviews.... however this was by FAR my fav!!!)   Use what you have on hand..... you can not go wrong.  I didn't have raspberries so I used a can of Mandarin Oranges.  I used half (100%) Strawberry preserves and half Orange Marmalade..... did NOT add any sugar at all..... didn't need it.  Everyone, including the adults and kids loved it.   As for the tortillas.... put them on parchment paper, spray with the butter spray, sprinkle with cin/sugar.... turn spray other side.... sprinkle and put in oven for about 8 or 9 min.   Don't bother turning... just wait till they are SLIGHTLY crisp and remove. WOW..... GOOOD, GOOOOOD, GOOOOOOOOD!!!

This was AWESOME - just as expected!! I subbed blueberries for raspberries, left out the additional sugar, used grape jelly for preserves, and utilized an onion chopper to make the fruit all more scoopable. For the chips, I sprayed the tortillas, cut with kitchen scissors, and sprinkled one side with cinnamon sugar. I pressed the pieces into mini muffin tins and they came out just right for scooping! The flavor combo is outstanding!

Absolutely loved this. I added just a pinch of brown sugar for flavor, the fruit was sweet enough.  To speed it up, I used an egg slicer to cut everything except the apples. For the Tortillas, I sprayed and sugared each one. Then, I stacked a few at a time and cut them with scissors, I've found it's the fastest way.

I have made this recipe as is and have customized it to include different fruits (mango, blueberries, etc.). The great thing about this recipe is that it never goes wrong no matter how you make it, suggesting that the fruits and sugars are in good proportion. I also really enjoy the tortilla chips by themselves. I discovered that you can make similar chips with garlic powder, salt, and various herbs to make an excellent dipper for hummus.

This is such a great recipe!  I am always looking for side dishes that are without dairy and this is a great one!  I did make a few changes: I didn't add any of the white sugar but did add the 1 tablespoon of brown sugar and I used melted margarine instead of cooking spray and just spread the margarine on with a brush.  Thanks for the great recipe!

I couldn't believe that something so easy can turn out to be so good. I took this to work for an app contest and I won. I used strawberries, apples, kiwi, & peaches. I did not even use a preserve. I chopped and combined the night before with the exception of the apples. This allowed for the flavors to really soak together. Make sure to cook the chips long enough a couple of batches came out a little rubbery and should have been cooked just a tad longer. The bowl was scrapped clean and everyone asked for the recipe. I also included cool whip on the side for people to top it with. Will defianlty make this summer for a great refreshing app.

This is a yummy  healthier snack. I would def cut back on the sugar next time.I also used whole wheat WW tortillas and they worked great. Remember sugar draws liquid out of fruit so I wouldn't reccomend using frozen berries. Thanx for sharing ;)

This was amazing!! Went perfect with Cherry Preserves! Next time I would half the sugar amount, because the sugar made the salsa 'soupy' fast (still tasted great just looked weird), and it was definately sweet enough with the added preserves!

This took a little bit of time cutting up the fresh fruit since I doubled it. I used a bag of frozen raspberries that I semi-thawed, fresh would have been better, but it was still good.  I made it for a Men's Meeting. I'm so glad I made a double batch, it was received well. It was a refreshing change from a sweet dessert and guilty free eating! The chips were tasty. The first batch stuck to the bottom of the cookie sheet, I ended up using my stoneware. I also set out graham crackers with the tortilla chips. Thanks for posting the recipe!

This is very very good!  I left out the raspberries becuase I do not like them.  I did this for a party and it got rave reviews.  Learn from my mistakes...do not use corn tortillas!  I made a mistake and they were very gross....back to the store I went for flour tortillas.

Absolutely delicious! I added some pineapple and since I couldn't find raspberries in the middle of the winter, I used rasberry jam. I didn't have any trouble with apples turning brown as other reviewers mentioned, possibly because of the pineapple. I don't generally eat a lot of fruit but I couldn't stop eating this!

Very tasty! Took it to 2 parties and it was a hit with young and old. Especially the chips. I used what fruit I had on hand... kiwi, apples, strawberries, and mango. You must try it! I used apricot preserves like someone suggested. I sprayed tortillas with PAM and used a pizza cutter to cut them. Then put in plastic bag with cinnamon sugar and gave in a good shake. Very easy!

I used a variety of frozen berries and let them thaw in advance. I then made both the dip and the chips the day before, and - wow- it was awesome! My hubby had doubts about the apples, but he was its biggest fan. Thanks for the tip about baking in the mini muffin pan- pure genius!

I use to make this years ago, got the recipie at a pamered chef party, yum!  Was so glad to come across the recipie again.  So glad to have the recipie again.  I put the sugar mixture in a plastic bag and wet the tortillas a little bit with water, no need to use cooking spray.  and then shake them up to save time.  All my friends asked for the recipie!

Great recipe! I substituted store bought cinnamon pita chips, but will do home made next time. It would be best to make fruit salsa the day of serving, otherwise it will get too runny.

I was not sure about this but tried it because everyone said how good it was.  They were telling the truth.  YUMMY!!!!!  I followed someones else's idea and used frozen peaches instead of raspberries and omitted white sugar.  I cannot say how wonderful and different this was.  What a hit at Thanksgiving.  I am gunna make again for Bunco.

Instead of making the tortilla into chips made it into a bowl and filled the bowl with fruit. Very tasty; however, I would suggest either leaving out the jelly or some sugar because both are not needed.

Sooooo good!  I bring this to alot of get togethers and it's always gobbled up!  I serve it with graham crackers.  Stacy's Cinnamon Pita Chips are great too BUT you have to be careful not to break your teeth on them.

This was amazing! I made it for a baby shower and everyone wanted the recipe. I used apricot jam and black raspberry jam, fuji apples, blueberries, raspberries, strawberries and pears. I didn't add any sugar as this was plenty sweet after the addition of the jam. I didn't have time to make the chips so I served this with cinnamon sugar pita chips and it was great.

I really love the chips! At first, I tried normal tortillas and they were so thick that the chips ended up chewy, then I tried Whole Wheat tortillas, which were thinner, and it turned out great!...plus they are healthy!

I made a lot of this to have it to bring to a party and still have some at home ... never enough!  This was a huge hit at the party and my kids loved it at home as well.  One warning, though ... make like double or triple the chips - they are well loved even without the salsa!

Made this for a get together and it was delicious.  I used kiwi, pineapple, peach, blueberries, and mango fruits.  Used brown sugar (omitted the sugar and it's plently sweet)and apricot preserve.  Did not have time to make the chips but bought the Trader Joe cinnamon chips.  Tasted like a dessert.  I will definitely be making this recipe again.

This would be 5 star without the sugar.  It's plenty sweet when coupled with the sugar coated chips.  The chips delicious even alone.  I've made this a few times.  It's easy to substitute whatever fruit is availiable.  It's always a hit.

Very good! I have had nothing but a great response to this recipe! I have used different flavors of preserves/jams/jellies and all have worked. I do not add raspberries because I do not like the seeds, but I have switched in all different kinds! For the chips I just spray the tortilla quarters with cooking spray and sprinkle with cinnamon and sugar and bake until crisp.

Made this for a party and it was definitely a hit. Everyone loved it, at the end of the night people were actually eating the dip plain with a spoon!  I did think it was a little "wet" which made it kind of soupy, which I think is just from all the juicy-type fruit used, other then that I will definitely make it again!

Wonderful recipe - thank you Ann.  My children love this recipe!  I add any fruit I have on hand.  It comes out great. Pineapple is really great - I omit all the extra sugar.  Fruit and a little raspberry preserves is all you need.  I use my pampered chef food chopper and I'm done in no time.

Made this for a baby shower and a graduation party.  Everyone loved it and want the recipe.  I used rasberry for the preserves.  I sprayed both sides of the  tortilla chips with Pam and the put them in a baggy to coat them with the cinnamon & sugar.

This was so so good and loved by all who tried it at my party.  I used as another suggested, 2 peaches (fresh)instead of the blackberries and I used apricot for the preserves.  No white sugar, just a scant tbsp. of brown sugar for sweetener.  Didn't need the sugar but the brown sugar adds a taste that is worth it.  Made my own cinnamon chips.  I think nine mins. is right and I think making sure to spray the chips after the cinnamon sugar addition makes the difference in crispness.  Will be making this one often.....have to wow all my groups!!!!

Another five star!  Made this for a bbq and it was polished off before anything else.  The kids especially loved it and devoured the cinnamon chips.  I only added a tiny bit of sugar and the fruit preserves and it was the perfect sweetness.  The chips are so sweet already that I think more sugar would've been overkill.  Thanks for the wonderful idea!  I served the salsa in a glass bowl inside a larger glass bowl and arranged the chips around the edge in between the two bowls.

Delicious! The chips were a pain, but I've heard that you can find those at the store now.  We added some extra berries and used red gala apples that we had on hand.  This is a very flexible dish.

I had this recipe saved in my favorites forever and finally decided to make it today for my newphew birthday party and it was awesome!! Use could use so many different types of fruits to this recipe to change it up. I did not have time to make the homemade pita chips so I used Stacey's cinnamon pita chips and they worked wonderfully with the fruit salsa. Will make this again soon!

This recipe is amazing, I did add mango and peach to it as well.  I coated the apples in lemon juice before adding them and they never turned brown at all (even a few days later when the leftovers were in my fridge).  Next time I will probably omit the rasberries, as they just turned to mush in mine.  Great dish though overall, I served it with cinnamon sugar pita chips because I was on a time crunch.

wow! Absoluetely incredible! I made this for a little gathering i had with some family and boy was it a hit! I cut the strawberrys pretty small, and chopped the rasberries but a chopper so they became juicy which i think made the salsa very good.  I also melted butter since i didnt have spray with worked great I just spread it on the tortillas. All the little kids went home saying to there moms, will you please make some fruit salsa. VERY VERY good! I very happy I now know of this recipe.

Over 2000 five star reviews and very well deserved! I'm adding mine-this is absolutely excellent. I used melted butter instead of spray (personal preference) on the chips, which are delicious warm just out of the oven.We couldn't stop eating this at home, but did make it to the party it was intended for. The little bit of leftover salsa was very yummy on french toast. Thanks for this great recipe!

Delicious!  Adding sugar to the fruit is not necessary.  I used a reduced sugar strawberry jam and it was wonderful.  I also tossed in some blueberries for added flavor and color.

Wonderful, I have been looking at this recipe for a few years now and just made it for the first time yesterday for a pool party. Rave reviews. The chips were excellent. I followed the recipe but I divided the salsa in half, and put 1/4 tsp. of cayenne pepper in one of the portions. Thought some hot might go well. It was o.k. but most people preferred the sweet, maybe a jalepno instead? Will make again.

This recipe is great, definitely my new "go to" potluck dish!! I've used all the fruits listed but i've also added: Pineapple, peaches, nectarines & mandarin oranges (only fruit I used the canned version of). Both times I used apricot preserves.  TIPS: I put some ice water and the juice of half a lemon in a bowl and as i chopped the apples I put them in there and drained well at the end. I had no problems with browning and the lemon added a nice little zip. If you have a large group and want to make a little extra without breaking the bank add more apples, they are cheap and add volume. Make sure you make plenty of chips, they go pretty fast (someone dubbed them "churro chips" at my BBQ & the kids all said it was like cinnamon toast crunch) I used two packs of ten and had no leftovers. If you run out of chips, throw the fruit in a pitcher and add some wine, yummy sangria!! Great way to use up the leftovers :) Be prepared to give out the recipe you WILL be asked!!

I do cooking demos at the cancer center where I work and everyone loved this.  I had some testers come up and decide whether to add the sugar to the fruit and it was agreed the sugar wasn't needed.  Perhaps in the winter when the fruits aren't in season you might need sugar.  I also added blueberries and mangos, and used walnut oil instead of using a butter spray.  It was a hit.

By far, this is the best recipe for fruit salsa I've ever had. Caution. . . very addictive!  I make a double batch at a time because everywhere I take it it's gone before I know it!

My daughter (6 year old) made the chips tonight for daddy.  She cut them out with a heart shaped cookie cutter.  We always dust them a second time with cinnamon sugar after they come out of the oven

I absolutely loved this recipe. Made it for a party and everyone loved it too. I left out the jam in the salsa and it still tasted great. I cut up the fruit the night before and refrigerated the fruit and it got a little bit too much juice though. Next time I will make it the day of. Chips are really easy to make.

I always like to try the recipe without making too many changes, but this time I didn't change anything.  I loved it!  It was delicious.  However, I would definitely cut the sugar out in fruit and perhaps try stevia.  I used strawberry preserves.  This was done in my school cooking program and even the teenagers liked it.  My son didn't like it too much because of texture (he has Asperger's Syndrome).  I did all my work on a huge cutting board so I didn't find this messy.  I also lined the baking sheet with aluminum foil.

Made this for the 4th of July and it was a huge hit!  I used grape preserves.  I was running out of time so I wasn't able to make the tortilla chips so I used cinnamon graham crackers instead.  Delicious!!!!

So I made this last night and was going to bring it to work. It took about an hour to cut up the fruit but it tasted fine whenever I mixed it together. However this morning it didn't look very appetisizing and became very sour. I was not very pleased. :(

Fresh and wonderful! Excellent idea--a fun twist on traditional salsa. I had this in my recipe box for YEARS and finally made it yesterday... should NOT have waited! What a hit! I used granny smith apples, kiwi, strawberry, and some blueberries for color. I don't think you need all that extra sugar if your fruit it in season! The preserves are a must though! --I used whole grain pitas and that worked quite nicely. Carefully shook them in a ziplock bag to coat. --For presentation, I used the idea of baking a tortilla over a bowl for 15 minutes...then piled the chips in there. So fun! Will post photos!

I added no sugar and the salsa was delicious.  I took one of the recommendations to coat the entire chip (both sides) with cinnamon and sugar, and I thought that was too much.  Overall, this was a great recipe - thanks!

Sorry, I have to give this only 1 star because even though it tasted good to me, everything turned pink and no one (of about 15 people) ate it.  Loved the chips though.

WOW!!!!!! This is the most amazing salsa in the world. It is a wonderfully refreshing summer dish. I left the extra sugar out and it was sweet enough. I made the chips in just a few short minutes (first tried to buy some just to speed things up but couldn't find any-once I made them found them to be as easy as opening a bag). I will definitely enjoy making this over and over again and experimenting with different fruits and preserves. ***UPDATE: Pineapple is good in this too! It is so fun to make just because its neat to see everyone grouped around the bowl eating and making yum sounds! LOL

Perfect summer treat!!! Everyone raved about the salsa and loved the chips. I followed the recipe except used one less spoon of white sugar. Next time I will make some chips without the sugar mixture as some of my guests are watching their weight and skipped eating the chips with the salsa. Will be making this over and over again!!! Thanks!!!

I let the diced fruit sit in a colander for a few minutes to drain out some of the juice and make it a little less runny.  Also bought cinnamon baked, low-fat pita chips in the grocery store to save some time and calories.  Took this to a party this weekend and it was a big hit.

Made this recipe for something "different" to bring to a party, now I am asked to bring this dish all the time.  The chips and fruit salsa are the first things to disappear.  Great recipe!  Didn't change a thing!  Thanks for the recipe!

My family has been making this recipe every summer but we do it a little different.  Eliminate the use of both brown and white sugar for a healthier recipe.  Add in Mangos,peaches and/or nectarines.  Use any apples you prefer. and use any fruit preserves you have on hand.  The best so far has been Apricot/Pineaple preserves.  Also at teh end squeeze a few limes before mixing to add a little juice and zest as well as keeping the color.

Sooo good.  I roughly chopped all of the fruit and then pulsed it in the food processor.  I added about a cup of blueberries and used apricot preserves.  I left out the white sugar entirely and probably used about 1 T. of brown sugar.

This is absolutely amazing! I didn't add any white or brown sugar, with all of the fruit, the natural sugar makes it plenty sweet! I used apricot preserves and also added about half of a diced pineapple. It's so hard to stop eating it!

Excellent!  I didn't have raspberries, so I used a mango and it was fantastic.  I used cinnamon and sugar separately, but next time I will mix it ahead of time so the chips look prettier.  Great recipe!

made this for a pot luck. Glad I followed the advice of another reviewer and doubled the amount of tortillas. I used splenda instead of sugar (I think about 1 T) and sugar-free preserves and it tasted great.

This was such a big hit with my family and so easy!!!  We did make some of the changes other reviewers suggested.  We did switch out the raspberries for frozen peaches.  I used blackberry preserves instead of the suggested orange marmalade.  Also, I used Pam organic olive oil spray instead of the butter sprays & the chips tasted fabulous.  This is a healthier alternative.  Also, I did add the sugar into the fruit, even though other reviewers said it makes more juice.  We actually liked the juice since it was a salsa.

I made this for snack for my children and my husband and they LOVED it!!! I will definitely be making it again. I did decrease the white sugar to 1 1/2 tsp and the brown sugar to 1 1/2 tsp. It was just sweet enough.

Brought this to a b-day party...it was very yummy!! We made it the night before and the apples were still fresh. I made more tortilla chips then called for. Next time I will put cinnamon sugar on both sides of the chips. But GREAT recipe!! Everyone loved it. Definitely a keeper!!

Great recipe and always popular.  I make way more cinnamon chips, people love them plain so I make sure there are extra to use up the salsa.

This is one I may over and over.  I haven't been successful in making it ahead of time, but it comes together fairly quickly.  Also have used store bought cinnamon chips in a pinch.

Simple, relatively healthy, and delicious.  Used homemade jam made from berries in our strawberry patch and our black raspberry bushes.  Add a bit of Tahitian vanilla bean (the absolute best in my opinion) and you're in heaven with little guilt.

I had no idea how yummy this would be but EVERY time I make it, I get so many compliments on it!  If you're in a hurry and don't have time to make the cinnamon chips, just buy a bag of Stacy's Cinnamon Sugar Pita Chips.  They taste great and make it easier to scoop up the fruit dip.  Very YUMMY!!!

This is the best appetizer recipe I've ever made!  I mixed strawberry and appricot preserves, which was a great combination.  For the chips, I mixed cinnamon and sugar in a large ziploc bag (about 1 Tblsp. cinnamon to 1 cup sugar).  I cut the tortillas with a pizza cutter, sprayed a plate with the butter flavored pam and laid the pieces of tortilla on the plate.  Then I sprayed the tops of the tortilla pieces, put them in the ziploc bag, and shook them in the sugar/cinnamon mixture.  I transferred them to a foil-lined cookie sheet, and they cooked up nicely in about 11 minutes in my oven.  My family loved this recipe.  It will definitely be a frequently used appetizer at our house!

Yummy! I think this recipe adapts easily. I couldn't find raspberries so I substituted frozen peaches. I also used oreange marmalade per another reviewer's suggestion. I still used the sugars, but I served it not longer after I made it. I chopped the peaches when they were partially thawed and added them to the mix. Having the peaches still frozen kept the salsa cold on the counter for about 45 minutes. I made the chips the day before the party and they kept well in a sealed container. Guests liked this alot.

Love, Love, Love this salsa. I've made it just about every week since having it for the first time at a party. I did take out the sugars like others have suggested. I also changed the apples to Fiji. One other thing that I did to make it even healthier was to change the flour tortillas to whole wheat. It doesn't change the taste at all!! They do require a longer baking time though - 18-20 minutes. Thanks so much for posting this! Love it!!!

Made this for a friend's bridal shower.  It was the rave of the party.  For simplicity, I used the bagged flour tortilla chips (now available in the chip aisle of any grocery store) and used butter flavored cooking spray and cinnamon sugar.  Exceptional.

GREAT recipe...perfect for showers or parties!  Make sure you cut everything pretty small so it's easier to scoop it up.  The juice tends to get pretty liquid after a while but still awesome!  You can buy the pita chips at the store, usually in the deli area.

I have made this several times and it is wonderful.  I have made it as is, and also substituted fruit, depending on what is in season.  For the cinnamon chips, I put 2 tortillas on a cookie sheet at a time and bake as directed.  However, I don't cut them until after they are baked. I use a pizza cutter and it works great.

Absoluletly fabulous!  I made this as a light snack for our Super Bowl party.  It turned out great.  I added blackberries to the fruit for some color, red raspberry jam and only used brown sugar.  I served the salsa with cinnamon chips and graham crackers.

I have made this recipe many times.  I follow the recipe exactly and it comes out amazing everytime.  Although, I do have a sweet tooth, so I can see how some people might find this salsa to be really sweet.  I usually end up buying pre-made baked cinnamon sugar pita bread from any bakery or grocery store to save on time.

Wow...this one was a stunner.  I took it to a rather large party and felt like Martha Stewart with everyone asking for the recipe.  Very different, very good, and very versitile with all of the different ways you can change it.  The chips were easy to do and cut with a pizza cutter.  Great recipe...thank you!

If I could give this 10 stars I would! This is sooo delicious. The baked tortillas are truly yummy, but if you don't want to take the time to make them, this tastes good with graham crackers too. Also, some commercial "sweet chips" are starting to come out in stores. I've tried this with sweet potato chips and with sugar/cinnamon pita chips. All good.

I just made this for New Year's Eve and it is so awesome my husband and I are having a hard time saving it for the party. The chips are excellent with the salsa, but I also bought graham crackers in honey and chocolate flavors to go with it as well. They taste just as good and might save you time if you don't have time to make the chips. Great recipe. Will definitely be making this one again!

I brought this to a work function and it was a huge hit! Due to what was looking good at the grocery store I subbed pears in for raspberries, and used (reduced sugar) raspberry preserves instead. I also added a bit more fruit but kept the sugar the same, and it was at just the right sweetness. This one is definitely a keeper.

Awesome recipe!!  Made it for a family Christmas yesterday using frozen strawberries, raspberries and peaches then fresh kiwi and granny smith apples and it was a smash hit!  It is a little time consuming to chop everything but it's well worth the time.  I plan on making the cinnamon chips again just to have on hand for snacking!  Even my hubby who isn't a big fruit fan loved it!

This is one of the best things I have ever eaten!  Perfect!  I choose not to use raspberries in it (they get stuck in everyone's teeth!) I also brush the tortillas with a bit of butter using a bbq brush instead of cooking spray.

I have taken this to several events and every time people are begging for the recipe. I don't make my own chips (I buy them already made).  I use granny smith apples and add peaches (use frozen if not in season). I also substitute splenda for the white sugar and brown sugar splenda blend.  I enjoy seedless blackberry jam the best.  It goes great over ice cream, angel food cake, cheesecake and waffles!

I have made this recipe twice for cookouts. It was gobbled up very quickly. I did not omit anything. You can use cinnamon grahm crackers too but the tortilla chips are eadier to use for dipping. I got several requests for the recipe. It is easy to make. It just takes time to chop up all the fruit.

This was very tasty. The chips do not need to bake for more than a few minutes, though. They burn easily because of the sugar.

Love this.  I used to make the chips from scratch but there are cinnamon chips on the market now that are much better than homemade--they're not bitter from accidently overdoing the cinnamon and they're crip without being burnt.

This is amazingly good, and very flexible.  Made this for a party with a "bring a salsa" theme, and it was the favorite by far.  I have varied the fruits based on what looks good that day at the market, and it works every time.  The cinnamon chips take this over the top and I wouldn't serve it with any other kind of chips, but you can buy sweet chips at the store if you are pressed for time.  This makes a lot of liquid as it sits, and my sis-in-law loves to stir it up and put leftovers on pound cake or angel food...  and I have to agree that it's a tasty way to finish this off!  Thanks for the great recipe.

Made this with a friend on a couple's evening and it was delicious.  It only took a while and the guys were even able to help.  I would probably use a little less cinnamon/sugar mix, but aside from that it was great.

I made this for a weeknight dinner.  I did not have  raspberries on hand; so I left those out.  I also omitted the brown and white sugar (just sounded too sweet.)  

Delicious!  My girls gobbled this up and asked to have this again soon!  What a fun recipe!

Delicious! I used strawberries, granny smith appels, peaches, kiwi, and green seedless grapes- all fresh. Chopping all the fruit of course was a bit tedious but dont be discouraged- it was well worth the effort. I didnt any any perserves- it was fine without it. I ended up not putting any sugar on the tortillas before baking them because I realized after the first batch that the combination of sweet fruit and sweet chips was just a bit too much. Just a personal preference I think. But overall very good.

Salsa was great, chips were a little soft, suggest cooking more than 5 min. Did not add much jelly, it really did not need it.

I was so anxious to try this recipe after all the great reviews.  It was just okay.  I made it for my husbands family.  I ended up with tons of leftover salsa and chips- I had made double on the reccomendation of reviews.

I made this for a girls night and it was just okay. I thought it was going to be "amazing", but really it's just chopped up fruit served with pita chips. Also, the fruit gets more and more watery as it sits there, so after an hour or so be prepared that its VERY runny and can be quite messy. It would actually be better if served as a dessert, such as an ice-cream topping, but not so great as an app.

Awesome! I found that it was easier and the chips turned out better with the smaller tortillas (prettier wedge cuts). I tried the Orange Liquer and "WOW"! It was a hit! I would make this one day in advance to allow the juices to flow - it tastes better and has a better consistancy. I will definitely make this again! I have already given the recipe to 2 people! :)

This recipe has become a favorite with friends and family. I add a little orange liquer to give it some added flavor and sometimes I'll add a cinnamon stick either as a garnish or for flavoring. YUMMO!

So fabulous!!! I wanted to bring something different next time the girls got together and this was the winner! It went over fantastic, all loved it, although I let it refridgerate overnight and it was quite runny. The next time I made it I did make some slight variations - such as only using 1 apple and only 1 tbsp of preserves to reduce the liquidity, added some diced mango. Also, I melted 2 tbsp of butter with the brown sugar in the microwave and coated the chips before baking. They turned out soft and brown...lovely. Overall, a huge hit! I will continue to whip this up when we're in the mood for something fun and fruity!!! Thanks for sharing :)

There isn't much to be said that hasn't already been said before. This recipe couldn't be any more delicious. It is perfect the way it is, but I also experiment with the fruits in the salsa based on what is fresh and in season. The cinnamon chips are something that I make just as a snack. I have served this over and over and people always want the recipe. It is perfect as an appetizer or a light dessert or even a snack. Thank you for this recipe!

I made this for a baby shower and it was a huge hit!  I used apricot preserves, and instead of the white/brown sugar I substituted date sugar.  I also used Fuji apples.  I wouldn't change a thing from this.  The cinnamon chips were a great sweet compliment to the tartness of the salsa.

So good.  I've made this several times.  My family called it fruit candy.  It is best with the homemade cinnamon chips.  Also, I would try to follow the recipe as best because every time I deviate from the original, I am disappointed.

FABULOUS!  I've made this 4 times already in a 2 day period.  Each time I varied the fruit (only slightly), and so far the best combo is diced fresh strawberries, kiwi, and peaches with 1 tablespoon of brown sugar and 2 tablespoons of apricot preserves.  I do not make the chips, but instead just discovered that Wheat Thins now makes cinnamon flavored.  They are perfect with this salsa.  You won't be disappointed!  Enjoy!

I used the egg slicer suggested in another review to reduce time chopping the fruit. The fruit I used was so ripe that no added sugar was necessary. I also coated the tortillas whole and stacked them to slice, which saved time. But total prep time for me was still nearly an hour. I took it to a pot luck, and it got great reviews! Thanks for posting this.

My face lit up when I saw all the fruit come together.  And the taste was wonderful, cool , and refreshing.  Dipping the cinnamon chips in the salsa, made me close my eyes and say,"MMMMM."

YUMMY! I love that you can make it with any fruit combination - I used apples, pineapple, kiwi, and strawberries! It was incredible. I took the other reviewer's advice for the chips and just sprayed both sides of the tortilla with pam, sliced it in about 12 pieces, and threw the pieces into a gallon bag with the cinnamon sugar mixture. One tip: Don't cook the chips too long! I thought I had to cook them until they were a little hard, but then they were overdone. The next batch I cooked until they were barely golden brown, took them out of the oven and they continued to harden on their own. They turned out perfect.

I'd give more than 5 stars if I could!  I made as written, except didn't have any preserves-didn't need it with the sugar.  My fruit combo, which was beeeutiful, was nectarines, mango, kiwi, strawberries and fuji apple.  Looked like the AR photo on recipe home page...and the cinnamon chips totally rocked!!

Great!  I used 2 peaches, 2 kiwis, 2 granny smith apples, and half a pint of strawberries.  I let the apples soak in 2 tablespoons of lemon juice and 2 tablespoons of lime juice which gave it a nice citrus taste. I had no preserves but I added a tablespoon of sugar to cut the lemon and bring out the flavors.  WIll definitely make again.

Excellent! Made with 3 T pineapple preserves and 1 T sugar and that was just enough sweetness. Used Fuji apples as another reviewer suggested and squeezed some lemon juice over it to prevent browning. Everyone loved it! This would be great over vanilla ice cream as well.

This recipe looks so simple--I couldn't believe it would turn out as good as it did. I made it for our family dinner last Friday and my daughter-in-law has already made 2 more batches by request--the kids wanted more chips on the weekend & a neighbor tasted it & told her to bring some along for 4th of July.
It's easy to find the way you like to do the chips best--I sprayed, sugared, sprayed again and THEN cut the tortillas. Store bought would be OK, but not as good as making these yourself.

I took this recipe to a get together and everyone loved it.  They all told me that I am now required to bring this to every group.  They all begged me for the recipe and, once they heard how easy it was, no one believed it.  
I did add a dash of lemon juice to prevent the apples from browning and it worked.  This is an awesome dish, and so healthy.  I love it.

Wow!I followed the recipe except I used blueberries instead of raspberries. I used blackberry jam. I followed the advice of other reviewers and cut back on the suger (used a sprinkle or brown) and gave my apple's a lemon bath.

I will make it again!

This was fresh and delicious! I added only 1 tsp. of sugar and used lemon curd instead of preserves - yum! I haven't made the chips yet, I got lazy and just bought the cinnamon pita chips at Trader Joe's.

PERFECT for a BBQ!  This was the hit out of all the food we had.  I ran back to the kitchen to make more chips 3 times!  Definitely do what most reviews suggest - DON'T add any sugar.  It does not need it.  It's perfect just the fruit and preserves (I used apricot preserves).  I also melted butter and brushed it on the tortillas since I didn't have spray.  Worked great.  Can't wait to make it again!!

I'll add my 5 stars to the other 1800 ratings for this recipe.  Made it according to the recipe - with the exception of adding diced banana as well - it was wonderful...not at all runny as some others found...I think the key may be in how you dice the fruit - I would imagine using a food processor might overdo it and cause it to be runny.  One of the great things about the recipe is that you can add whatever your favorite fruit is and it's still delicious! I'll be making this often Thanks for sharing.

I've eyed this recipe for a long time. And it was wonderful! I did use exactly what the recipe called for, however, it you didn't want to buy expensive raspberries, just leave them out. You won't miss them.

My husband liked this, but the daycare kids did not.  I really thought they would.  My cinnamon chips stuck to the pan even with spraying the pan first, from the sugar.  It was a mess.  So, four stars for my husband.

I made this for my college graduation party and everyone raved about it! I wish I read some reviews because it did have a lot of juice but I had no complaints! I used strawberry preserves but may try blackberry next time to switch it up. Will make again and again. What a great recipe, thanks!

I made this for a baby shower and it was an absolute hit!! I took the time to make the homemade tortilla chips instead of the store boughten chips, and it was well worth it! I did though, decrease both sugars to 1 TBSP and used pineapple preserves since that's what I had on hand. I loved it, everyone at the shower loved it. Thank you so much for a wonderful "summery" recipe!!!!!

Fabulous! This was so good, we couldn't stop eating it. I didn't have raspberries so I added extra kiwi, I used a strawberry puree (I had left over from a cake recipe from this site) for the preserves and I just used original pam, as I didn't have the butter flavor, but no worries, it turned out great with these few changes. I will try it again w/ raspberries... delicious. I didn't even mention the chips - you could eat them w/ anything, very good.

I recently brought this to a friend's house for a gathering and it was a huge hit! Great presentation, I bought some "star fruit" and used it for garnush around the bowl...Great all year round for that sweet tooth!

I made this for a luncheon and it was an absolute HIT!  The Golden Delicious apples (GDA's) worked fine for me and hadn't turned brown.  I first chopped the Kiwi, then with the Kiwi still on the counter/cutting board, cut up the GDA's.  Periodically I mixed the apples and Kiwi together while chopping the apples such that the juices of the Kiwi (similar to Lemons/Limes) can prevent them from turning brown.  The flesh brightness maintained itself and the preserving properties of the preserves also lent to this.  (II).  For the Cinnamon Chip - I placed the cinnamon sugar in a wide-mouthed bowl (mixing sized perhaps).  I sprayed both sides of the tortillas as I stacked/piled them in the same manner they were packaged.  Then I cut the stack/pile into the wedges.  I even stacked some of the stacks.  I peeled each wedged and dredged and pinched it around the sugar (both sides) for coverage then placed it in the pan, conveniently close.  Kept 'em moist, close, non-sticky/messy and simple.  

Thanks!

This is a wonderfull recipe. It was simple and delicious! Everyone loved it. A tip for some of you guys: If you dont want the apples to brown add a teaspoon of lemon juice to them. You dont have to add as much sugar as the recipe asks for. Just a little bit of the sugar draws out the juices of the fruit.

This is wonderful!! Always a hit at parties. I use fuji apples. I don't add preserves, but do dip apples in either lime soda or lemon juice to keep the brown away! I usually serve with cinnamon pita chips. YUMMY! 4/29/10 UPDATE--added sweet chili sauce to spice it up. Sooo good!!! I have to bring the recipe to parties to share  and make a triple batch.

I have been wanting to make this salsa for sooo long... I finally made it with some help from the reviews, I used 1 carton of Strawberries, 2 Necterines, 3 Kiwis, and 2 Fugi apples. Before I put the apples into the bowl I squeezed half of a lemon on them, so they wouldn't brown. Then mixed the fruit with 2 Tbsp. Strawberry Preseves. No added sugar Tip: the more you mix, the juicier the fruit gets. Then instead of flour tortillas, I used whole wheat pitas,glazed with butter, and sprinkled with cinnamon,cut them in 4's and baked them in the oven, until they were brown. OMG!!! I brought them for Easter dinner, I got so many compliments. Everyone love it. Not only is is pritty and delicious, It's guiltless, too. I will be making this again. Thanks AR.

Decided to try this recipe when I was looking for a healthy appitizer to take with me to a party.  Well, everyone loved it and gobbled it down (and asked for the recipe).  Made it tonight for the second time and my picky boyfriend (who was very iffy about it before trying it - he's not too crazy about fruit) loved it.

I did change the recipe a fair amount though.  I diced 1 green apple, 1 mango and ~8 strawberries.  Mixed them together with 1 tblsp raspberry jam and 2 tblsp reduced sugar black cherry compote.  I didn't add any sugar into the mixture, and it was definitely sweet (and juicy) enough, even with low sugar jams.

For the chips, I used only 5 whole wheat tortillas (this was a better ratio of fruit to chips then the 10 I used the first time).  I mixed splenda and cinnamon together in a ziplock bag and then tossed the (sprayed) chips in the bag with the sugar mixture.

YUM!

Made this for Super Bowl party.  Took the advise of some reviews about the extra juice and sweetnes issue.  I used frozen peaches instead raspberries and a different type of apple, mainly because that is what I had on hand.  I turned out pretty good.  The next weekend I  served it with pieces of cinnamon graham crakers.  They seem to go well together.  Also, I froze the left overs (which I held separate in the fridge for refills) and served it the next weekend over a mixture of cream cheese, butter, sugar, vanilla (sort of like a cream cheese danish filling).  It was fabulous.  Everyone seemed to like it, however some of the guys wished I had warned them about the sweetness, because they were expecting a traditional type salsa.  So, next time I will split a piece of whole fruit and rest it on the side of the bowl.  Maybe that will give a clue.  I will be making this many times in the future, especially in the summer!

This fruit salsa was so easy and simply delicious! I followed the recipe exactly except for omitting both the white sugar and the brown sugar, as other reviewers had suggested. The fruit and the preserves were definitely sweet enough without the added sugar, plus the salsa kept it's consistency and did not water. I was going to make it even easier by buying the cinnamon chips, but I could not find them in my grocery store. And I am very happy that I didn't, because the 'homemade' chips were the best part - great crunch and light sweetness. I took the advice of another reviewer and used a pizza cutter to cut the butter sprayed torillas into 8 wedges each, and then placed each one in the cinnamon/sugar bowl to coat one side and arranged them on the baking sheet with the sugar side up. This was less messy than sprinkling on the sugar mix. This appetizer/dessert also looks great arranged on a dish. I brought it to a small (20 people) party recently and EVERY person wanted the recipe. It's a versatile recipe that can be served any time of the year - thanks so much for the great dish!

Made this weekend and it was a hit!  Took some advice from other reviewers and made the following changes.  I brushed the tortillas with melted butter and sprinkled with the cinnamon sugar, then baked for 11 min.  30 sec. and they were nice and crisp. I did use frozen raspberries and frozen blueberries, but i drained then for awhile before i added them.  I also put my chopped apples in water and lemon juice while i made the salsa and they did not brown.  I had some   cinnamon chips left over and they are like cookies...we love them!
Thanks...can't wait for summer fresh fruit.

this recipe is super yummy!
changes i made: i added a package of cream cheese and a handfull of mini marshmellows, melted, to the mixture, creating an AWESOME fruity-cheesecake taste. i omitted the strawberries but used fresh strawberry preserves. i did one batch with Pink Lady apples, then another batch with Fuji apples. The Pink Ladies held up better, in color and in crispness. 
this recipe isnt as good after sitting for 2 days. its still yummy but the apples arent as crisp and everything else just seems mushy. i sliced and toasted 8 tortillas worth of chips but that wasnt enough. i'd go for 10 or 12 next time.

Such a great recipe, always a hit and so so fresh...nice change from regular salsa.  Buy store bought cinnamon chips, saves a lot of time.  Good way to get your fruit servings for the day :)

My family absolutly loved this recipe! Seeing how we're in the mid-west and its winter, the fruit was expensive and i couldnt find raspberries i uses a can of crushed pineapple. It made it more "salsa-y". I also put lemon juice on the apples after i diced them to prevent browning! LOVE THE RECIPE!!!!

All I can say is FANTASTIC!! I read a couple of the other recipes and only added the preserves and a little Splenda and it was perfect.  Also it is better to toast the chips longer than it is to pull them out earlier.  This was a huge hit.

Delish! I will cut back on the sugar next batch because I used tropical fruits (apple, pineapple, honey dew melon, mango, kiwi) instead of berries.I think the berries would need the sugars. Thanks for the recipe!

this was so freaking good. i've had the link to the recipe on my favorites for a while, but i haven't had the resources to buy $20 worth of fruit until now. (i doubled the recipe, which i would definitely recommend!)

i didn't add any of the sugar or the preserves because it was already really sweet. i also substituted pineapple for kiwi since my boyfriend is allergic to them. the pineapple made it nice and tart/sweet. someone on here suggested an egg slicer to cut up the fruit, and that worked really well! i also used Fuji apples and they didn't brown at all. this was SO good. i'm definitely making this once every couple of weeks. i think it would also be good served with ice cream (maybe Breyer's Vanilla Bean?).

I made this for a church picnic and I got tons of compliments.I also used the champagne grapes as reviewers did but I think you could mix and match fruits to what ever was in season. This recipe tastes great and looks very pretty. Thanks

This recipe is kind of a lot of work, and my guests thought it was just ok.  By the middle of the party there was quite a bit of juice in the dip bowl, and it looked a bit unappetizing.

Awesome!  I've tried it with different fruit and preserves.  I used orange marmalade the first time and didn't like that as much as when I used all sugar free strawberry preserves.  I used I Can't Believe It's Not Butter spray on the tortillas and used my cinnamon and sugar shaker.  We liked eating those even without the salsa.  I can't wait until I have something that I can bring this to.

I made this just as a desert over here in Holland on a random Sunday night. Everyone loved it and less than a week later I have been requested to make it for a party. I used a mixed berry preserve and blackberries instead of raspberries. Expensive, but well worth it.

I guess I am not sure why this got such great reviews. I brought this to a bunco group and it was barely touched. I made the chips the night before and they were very good warm, but tasted stale the next day. My fruit turned mushy and just tasted like ordinary mixed fresh fruit salad. My 7 year old daughter liked it though.

Very very good and very VERY sweet.  Everyone kept eating the chips without dipping them in the fruit salsa!  :)  Delish, truly.  Whomever suggested using the egg slicer is a genius, saved me a TON of time.  I did not add any sugar, this was sweet enough on its own.  Thanks!

I really didn't like this. I added the sugar and everything and it still tasted too bitter for me (I'mnot exactly a berry fan I guess). The cinnamon chips themselves were just passing fair.

LOVE this recipe!  I have made it several times this summer and everyone loves it!  I even top pancakes with it for my son!
Question... how long can I expect this to keep??  Also, my chips seem a  bit chewy... any advice on crunchier chips?

Amazing!  This dish was the talk of the party I brought it too!  I doubled the recipe and it made sooooo much.  I don't think i'd recommend that.  I think this can serve more than 10 people.  Also, raspberries were so expensive i bought one less package and then used half raspberry preserves and half apricot.  It made a great balance of sweet and tart.  The chips are amazing too!  Just time consuming, but well worth it.  I too made it a day ahead and the flavors marinaded nicely.  Thank you so much for a wonderful recipe :)

Wow- this is such a unique and fun recipe. My guests at our housewarming party loved it- and it went quickly. You could really add any kind of fruit (probably not bananas) to this salsa to suit your taste. I did have to cook the chips longer to get them crispy, because I didn't want them to be chewy. Fun and yummy.

Excellent! This was a hit at the 4th of July picnic. I used the idea mentioned earlier about using an egg slicer to cut up the fruit. It definitely saves time.

Made this for a July 4th party and it was a BIG hit! I used kiwi, peaches, pineapple, fuji apples, granny smith apples, strawberries, blueberries, raspberries, blackberries (everything except for the kitchen sink..haha) and raspberry preserves. After it sat for about 2 hours or so, I strained the liquid out of it. This is such an wonderful and easy recipe. This will become a "must bring" item. Thanks for sharing!

The chips came out great and, like others, I didn't add any sugar to the fruit.  I didn't even have to use preserves because I added mango, which is pretty sticky, and that held everything together very well.  Such an easy idea, but it does take a little while to get everything chopped so small.

Over the 4th of July holiday, I tried this recipe out on 4 different groups of people. It was a hit with every group. The first time, I made it exactly by the way it states, using rasberry preserves, and it was great. The second time, I used blackberrys instead of rasberries and used apricot preserves, and it was even better! Ok, hints to make this easier. Go to WallMart and buy Black and Deckers 10.00 chopper. It cut prep time down to about 15 minutes. Also, since the recipe does come out soupy, I let it sit in a strainer for 15 minutes, and that took care of alot of fluid. One last thing, add whatever nuts you want, it makes it even better. I used walnuts, and almonds. I also served it with the little waffle cups, people loved it! The cinnamon chips were easy to make, and using the muffing tin was a good idea.
I will be making this again.

Loved this!! I had many requests for the recipe. I followed the ingredients to a T except for adding the preserves. I left it out. I also think it helps if you let the flavors "marinate" over night. I served with the cinammon-sugar tortillas (many thought that they were store bought) and with cinammon graham crackers. Definately making this one again!!

After looking through some reviews I made the following changes: no sugar with the fruit, peach fruit preserves. blackberries instead of raspberries (for color), golden apples added last to prevent browning, sprayed both sides of the tortilla/cut with a pizza knife, dredged in cinnamon sugar. 

Overall this turned out pretty well. Everyone seemed to like it, but no one was jumping for joy (like I had expected from the reviews). I can't hold it aganist the receipe since I did make changes, and I will for sure make this again. 

My only problem was the salsa was a little juicy. The chips were great and I'll use those for other recipes!

I used premdae cinnamon sugar pita chips. For fruit, I used fresh: raspberries, strawberries, blueberries, golden delicious apples, and kiwis.  I used blueberry preserves and ommitted the brown sugar. Perfect for our July 4th BBQ.

I needed something quick to take to a party and it was a HUGE hit.  I don't add any of the fruit preserves because it was allready sweet enough and didn't want to cover too much of the fresh fruit flavor.  Also, substituting any fresh fruit works - one time i couldn't find kiwis, another there were no blueberries.  I'm actually on my way to make it again for another picnic today and using peaches!

This was really tasty and didn't take too long to make. I used store bought cinnamon sugar pita chips, and I used splenda, splenda brown sugar, and seedless blackberry all fruit jelly to keep the added sugar to a minimum.

This fruit salsa is amazing!  I have served it at a couple of parties and people are always asking me how I do it.  Instead of using the cooking spray, I butter each tortilla individually and then cut them into wedges.  They taste fantastic!

A huge hit with everyone who tasted it.  Any combination of fruits should work.  A food chopper is almost a necessity.  I highly recommend this.

Everyone LOVED it, thought I bought the salsa and the chips at the store.  I coated both sides of the chips with the cinnamon/sugar mixture and that was the ticket for us!  Wonderful!  Will definitely make again!  Pefect combination of flavors and the chips and salsa compliment each other perfectly.

This recipe was very good. I made it for a baby shower and everyone loved it. Next time I will cut back, if not omit the sugar. It made lots of juice. Which would be nice over an angel food cake. Also I did not make my own chips but purchased Trader Joe's cinn and sugar pita chips. Worked well.

Unbelievable. I doubled this for a big group, and I had all my friends arguing over who gets to marry me!! I added blueberries, which were a big hit, and I squeezed an entire lime into the recipe. Also, I added chopped walnuts which a couple people commented on as being a great touch. 
Tastes GREAT served with vanilla ice cream, softened so that you can scoop it up with the chips. 
Thank you so much!

I made this recipe for a party, and people raved over it!  I followed the recipe mostly as written, using Granny Smith apples and blackberries instead of raspberries.  However, when I made the cinnamon chips, I did not use butter spray, which gives me the creeps, but I brushed melted butter over the top of each tortilla and then sprinkled the cinnamon sugar over the top.  I did not brush butter over a second time.  Also, be sure to watch the chips carefully in then oven.  I found that they were done a minute or two earlier than the prescribed 8 min.

i recently made this for a dessert potluck and got great compliments. following the advice of other users, i only used about a tablespoon of sugar and a tablespoon of preserves (blackbetter), however, i still found it a bit too sweet. i used strawberries, raspberries, mango, apricots, kiwi, and an apple. i also added about a 1/4 cup of red wine for a little kick. time consuming, yes, but a delicious end result.

This is fantastic and really easy, I've already made it twice.  I don't make my own chips though, just don't feel like spending the time.  The first time I made it I found cinnamon pita chips in the grocery store and the second time I bought apple cinnamon chips...both were fantastic.  Sometimes it's easier to find these types of chips in the ethnic  or organic aisle of the grocery store.

It was okay, but something just wasn't right. Maybe it would be better if I hadn't used Trader Joe's cinnamon chips. The salsa was too watery/mushy.

I'm going to make this for my daughter's birthday party in July.  I did a test run last night using what fruit I had on hand - Gala apple, nectarine, blueberries & strawberries - used just a little brown sugar with the preserves.  I also did not have tortillas on hand so I used the same method on whole grain pita bread...Absolutely delicious!  I love the tip from the previous reveiwer who served in waffle bowls!  So many variations - I will make this again and again and again....

Absolutely divine.  I followed the recipe exactly as prescribed and, the bowl of fruit and chips were gone in no time!  The mixture seemed a little more runny than I'd have liked--any suggestions for keeping the fruit salsa a little more "solid" without sacrificing taste?  Also--I highly recommend ORANGE MARMALADE as your jam base!

Reading the recipe, I couldn't imagine how it could possibly be as fantastic as the review say.  It looks too easy.  There aren't may things in it.  Well, I've got to agree that this is 100% an example of the sum being more than the parts.  I made this three times the first week.  This is just great!  Everyone at the party I tried it out on loved it and wanted more.  I made enough for 4 times the number of people there and there was NOTHING left.  You won't be disappointed.
I did leave out the sugar and used blueberries instead of raspberries, but I did use raspberry jam for that taste.  I also used apple slices that I'd frozen from last apple season so I did have to drain some sauce off to keep it from being too wet. I think the frosty apples were easier to chop and made the salsa nice and cool, great for summer!  My 5 year old loved the chips all by themselves.

I made this for a cook out.  It was a HUGE hit!  I cut the strawberries and apples the day before so squeezed a whole lemon onto the mix to prevent browning.  I used 2lbs of strawberries instead of just the one, and used Granny Smith apples to make it a little more tart. Kiwi was the only additional fruit I added.  I used the recommended amount of sugar and preserves. The final result was wonderful!

This was so delicious.  I made it for a Cinco de Mayo office potluck.  No one had thought about "breakfast" fare, and this was devoured! I used frozen berries from last years harvest, threw in a fresh pear that was on hand and was actually looking for any other fruit I thought might be great.  I used homemade cherry preserves for the jam ingredient.  I think any jam or jelly would be find- whatever was on hand!  Actually, any fruit, frozen or fresh would be good.  I added some chopped crystllized ginger too (what's a salsa without some "ZING!"?)

I made this for a Mother's Day cook out - everyone loved it...they were amazed that the chips were home made and wanted to know how I did that! I bought the cinamon and sugar alreay combined and also left out the rasberries and used blueberries in the salsa.  Already have requests to bring to our Memorial Day picnic.

Used this recipe on Cinco de Mayo and it was the hit of the night.  
I couldn't find raspberries, so I used blackberries and it was awesome.

It was 95 degrees yesterday and this fruit salsa was just perfect! Great on a hot day. I followed the recipe but used frozen rasberries which seemed to make it mushy. Next time I will use fresh berries, add pineapple, use one fuji apple for a tarter taste and reduce the sugars in 1/2. Chips were wonderful~ Good unique recipe!

I had this at a baby shower and it was really good--I used mango and pineapple and whatever fruit I had on hand--I recommend buying cinammon tortilla chips or pita chips though--the homemade ones just don't come out as well.

The fruit salsa with the cinnamon chips were a hit.  Everyone loved the home made cinnamon chips too.  Didn't use raspberries as the two containers they had left at the grocery store had mold on them so I got blackberries instead.  And used 2 McIntosh apples instead.  I used regular Pam as I didn't have the kind with butter.  Turned out well and everyone liked it.  Different than just the boring fruit salad that gets thrown together.  Thanks.

I wasn't wild about this at first until I let it chill in the refrigerator for about 30 minutes. Once the flavors released it was very sweet and delicious. I had to double the recipe for a party and it was a lot of work, but soooooo worth it. I'll make this again!

Wow, this was fantastic! I prepared the salsa a day ahead of time adding everything except the apples and sugars. I used one granny smith apple and one fiji apple. I also added peaches to the recipe. About an hour before serving I mixed in the sugars and apples, then placed the salsa in the fridge. For the chips, I sliced the tortillas with a pizza cutter and coated each piece with the spray. I then placed the pieces into a container with the cinnamon sugar mixture and just shook it until they were all covered. I then cooked the tortillas in a muffin pan to make little bowls out of them. It worked out perfectly. I would like to try it again with a mini muffin pan. I cooked them for 10 minutes and they all turned out perfectly. I made 36 scoops with the tortillas and had exactly enough to use up all of the chips and salsa. This was the biggest hit and I am so excited to make it again! Thanks for the wonderful recipe.

This dish was a hit!  Instead of the raspberries, which are so expensive right now I used chopped green grapes, it turned out great!  I recommend eating the salsa within 4-5 hours after making, it tends to get soft and runny-

My bunko girls really loved this one!  They were very impressed!  The only thing I would suggest is to not make the cinnamon chips too far in advance.  They are not good the next day either.

I let my Sunday school class (3-5 yr olds) make this in a food processor. It was a little more like puree than salsa but the flavor was good. The young'uns liked the chips more than the fruit. 
We served the rest to the older classes with cinnamon bagal chips. They all liked it.

This recipe is fantastic!  I added an extra kiwi, apple, and a tablespoon of lemon juice. ( I was afraid the apples would brown and we love the tart)  I omitted any sugar in the salsa b/c I used homemade raspberry preserves and they are very sweet.  I bought pita chips with cinnamon and sugar but made the tortilla chips which were MUCH better than the store bought pitas.
YUM!

I made this yesterday for a party, and everyone loved it and asked for the recipe. You can't go wrong with this. I used blackberries instead of raspberries, and one T peach jam and 2 T grape because that's what I had on hand. I think I may try to do both sides of the chips with cinnamon sugar next time.

What a fantastic recipe!!  Made it just the way the recipe called for and used strawberry preserves.  Perfect for any party. Although I thought it might get runny after one day, it tasted even better the day after I made it.

Really great and Easy Recipe. I added mango's and used apricot preserves. I didn't use the white or brown sugar and it was still plenty sweet. Winner at a cocktail party.

I made this for a Daytona 500 party and received many compliments.  I didn't have the time to make the tortilla chips, so I just purchased two bags of cinnamon pita chips and they were great (but not as sturdy as the tortillas would have been)!  I like that this is a sweet treat that is healthy!

Great recipe for everyone.  Light and crispy chips are delicious just by themselves.  Made this recipe twice already and everyone asked for the recipe. The kids love it too!!!

AWESOME!  I took other reviewers' advice and left out the extra sugar from the salsa, but otherwise made this exactly.  Chips were delicious and I know I'll use the fruit salsa in many other applications... We love this for dessert.  Thanks for the post!

This was a big hit at a work/baby shower recently.  It made a ton of salsa.  I made for a group of 20 and still had a lot left over.  I used raspberry preserves, but will probably try another flavor next time.  Thanks for the recipe.  I like that it is different and that it went over so well.

Made this last night! So GOOD! I used Peach preserve. Everyone raved about it, and today wrote out the recipe three times to give to friends. Thank you for sharing. Defainlty a keeper, also a fun way to get your kids to eat more fruit.

I thought this was extremely sweet but was a nice change up for a bring-a-snack party.  It seemed to get lots of compliments but I brought a LOT home.                   That combined with my lack of "Wow" over it puts it in the 3 star category for me.  I will keep the recipe and make again, for sure.  Thanks for sharing it with us.

This was good.  Didn't really stuck out as great at the Christmas party, but a good standby for the future.  I used store bought bunuelos (cinn/sugar on flour tortilla chips) which were a big hit.

Oh my gosh what a great idea!!! So delicious too as you can customize the "salsa" to your own taste.  Nice spin on desert after a spicy Mexican meal.  Thanks so much for the post, we loved them!!!!

I was looking for a new idea for a healthier dessert for a southwestern themed thanksgiving, this was perfect! I added some fresh mint and lime juice and it was the perfect balance of sweet and tart. Great recipe!

I made this a few weeks ago when we had several families over and I was looking for a kid-friendly appetizer. Everyone loved it! My daughters keep asking me to make it again and again. I didn't like the method of placing the tortilla triangles in a ziplock bag with sugar/cinnamon as they came out too sweet and not quite as crisp. I sort of dredge them in the sugar/cinnamon and, thus, can control the amount going on each. I ended up with frozen raspberries and they added so much taste to the salsa. Wonderful, wonderful!

I served this at a gathering and people LOVED it. Raspberries are kind of expensive here, so I used a mango instead and it was fabulous. The chips were easy to make, too (someone said they reminded them of the cinnamon twists you get a Taco Bell). I used a lot less cinnamon sugar than the recipe called for, and it was still great.

Can't believe how yummy this was.  Made it with a fruit dip recipe (cream cheese, brown sugar and vanila extract) and it was a HUGE hit.

This is always a hit at all of my parties.  It's so easy because you can chop the fruit while you're making batched of the chips!  If you're not planning on serving this for a couple of hours though, I usually leave out a little of the sugar - it keeps it from getting very soupy by the time you serve it.

AMAZINGLY SCRUMPTIOUS! I took this recipe to a potluck at church and also to a church camp for little kids and middle schoolers; Both LOVED it. The little kid liked the chips more. :) I used various fruits each time and it always was GREAT!

WOW! I brought this to a "Mexican" theme family dinner where other's brought enchiladas, burritos , rice and beans. Here is my fruit salsa. I used a bunch of fruit including kiwi mango, pinapple, peach, 4 berries, apple and lime juice.  The chips were gone so fast, no one could believe they were just tortillas! Thanks for a winning recipe!

Absolutely fantastic.  I've made this for two appetizer parties and it went over well at both.  I left out the fruit preserves the second time because it's sweet enough without it, and I didn't really like the taste of the preserves I used.  I put a spoonful of extra fruit into a glass of wine for a makeshift Sangria too. YUM!

I love this recipe and so does everyone I make it for. I follow the directions and it turns out wonderful everytime! When I bake the tortillas I cut them into wedges with a pizza cutter and arrange them in muffin pans. If you push them down in the pan or align them in the curve of the muffin pan it gives the chips the curved look. I bake the chips until they are brown which may take a little longer than 8 to 10 minutes. 
Overall this is a great easy recipe that everyone who enjoys fruit will love!

We just finished eating this as a precursor to our Sunday meal.  Made the fruit salsa according to the recipe sans brown sugar and most of the white sugar (just threw in a bit).  Was generous with the raspberries (probably 9 oz.).  The problem we had were the chips.  Made them according to the recipe but couldn't get the texture right. I'm still giving it a five.  If someone has tips for how to get crispy chips that would be great.  I saw someone toasted them (I think BEFORE the oven) but I was worried they'd be too cooked.  Ours were pretty much the consistancy of really stale tortilla.  We used WHEAT tortilla... perhaps that was the issue.  Ended up using cinammon graham crackers instead -- yummy!  We'll both be taking this to work for the week!

I purchased Cinnamon Raisin Bagel Crisps this time instead of making the homemade chips and it was a big success - the real star of this recipe is the fruit salsa, and the cinnamon chips take the most labor - so this was a good solution.  This recipe is outstanding though, people can't walk away from it.

I'm planning to make this for Christmas. For the cinnamon chips I'm going to use Christmas shaped cut-outs rather than cutting into wedges.

The fruit salsa is amazingly good and the cinnamon chips really impressed family/friends.  You can even make this recipe low sugar by using Splenda in the salsa and on the cinnamon chips.  You can also use whole wheat tortillas to make this recipe even more healthy.  If using Splenda and whole wheat tortillas, use a light hand when sprinkling the tortillas and bake them in the lower end of the time range.  

A fabulous (and healthy!) recipe!

Very easy to prepare. Everyone especially loved the tortilla wedges and even ate more of those than the salsa. The salsa was a bit runny but I prepared it the night before the party and refrigerated overnight.  Next time I'll either make it right before I intend to serve it, or drain out the extra juice.

Perfect light dessert. Used this at my brother's graduation party and received rave reviews! Dipped the ends of the cinnamon sugar chips in chocolate and allowed to harden...perfect all on their own!

This was wonderful. I made it my own by adding grapes, pineapple, papaya, and mango.  I omitted the white sugar because it's sweet enough.  I used Apricot preserves.  I brought this to my office Cinco De Mayo goodie day and it was a huge hit - everyone wanted the recipe!

This was pretty good, but I made a few changes.  Instead of apples, I used 4 just ripe (but firm) nectarines.  I used 3/4 pound strawberries (too many overpower the taste of the other fruits).  I also used about 1/2 the sugar that is called for, and I used apricot preserves.  It was a hit at a superbowl party, and the healthiest thing there :)  Leftover fruit salsa can be put in a dessert dish and topped with whipped cream.  Next time I may add some Mango.

I made the mistake of making this for our neighbor friends and their family and now whenever we are invited to one of their family gatherings (and there are many as it is a very large family) they request that I make this. I love to cook and make a variety of things but this is all they want me to do now! It has been a huge hit everywhere I have taken it even among the kids! The time it takes to chop all of the fruit and bake the chips is more than worth it... thank-you for sharing this great recipe!

I made this for a baby shower last year and it was a total hit! Out of 30 attendees I think that at least 2/3 asked for the recipe. It was out of this world delicious! I lost my recipe and had to come back to get it for a Thanksgiving appetizer. Excellent recipe and perfect as is!

I made this for a party and it was a big hit.  The chips were great.  I put the fruit in the blender and pulesed it a few times and that was a bad idea.  The fruit turned to mush after a while.  The next time a make it I will cut the fruit by hand.

I'm not quite sure what all the rave is over this appetizer.  I agree that it tastes fresh, sweet, but it's just not as fantastic as I was expecting.  It definitely tastes as if it's missing something.  I had someone suggest adding liqueur or even vodka.  Maybe a "kick" is what it needs.  I did enjoy the cinnamon chips and might use them with another dish, but I'm not sure if this is one I'll make again.  Rather boring taste if you like bringing exciting things to gatherings.  Other things to keep in mind:  the expense of these items can really add up; I suggest only preparing approximately 1 1/2 cups cinnamon sugar; I agree the versatility of this dish is outstanding!

I made this for a small party.  Everyone LOVED it.  I made only minor changes.  I didn't use the apples, instead I put in blackberries and mango and I used cherry preserves.  It got raves and I will definitely make it again!

This recipe is awesome!!  Everyone loves it.  I used some of the other ideas such as using apricot preserves, coating both sides of the tortillas with the spray and putting them into a zip-lock baggy to shake the cinnamon-sugar onto each chip.  I also put the chips into muffin tins to curl the chips (this makes it a lot easier for people to scoop up the salsa).

This recipe is definitely a hit at summer gatherings BUT....Why go through all the trouble with the tortillas, the cinnamon sugar & turning on your oven when it's hot out...when you can just buy a 99 cent bag of Churritos from the local gas station?????
Also, next time I think I'll add some different colors to the mix like blueberries or black berries perhaps?

I have been using this recipe since it was first posted. People always tell me to market the cinnamon chips because they are sooo good! My favorite apple to use is granny smith apples. By far, this is my most requested recipe. Very fresh, perfect summertime party food.

Two thumbs way up for this recipe. Everyone I have made this for loves it. The only change I have made was to cut down on the amount of sugar. I only use 1 T. brown sugar and 2 T. preserves, I eliminated the white sugar.

Great recipe for entertaining. Everyone at our party loved it. I used the idea of making a bowl out of a whole tortilla shell placed in a round oven safe baking dish. Looked great with the salsa in it surrounded by the chips. I didn't have butter flavored cooking spray so I brushed one side of the shells with melted butter and sprinkled with cinnamon sugar. Then I cut with a pizza cutter which made it very easy.

Excellent.
The only thing I would do different is leave out fruit that you can't find fresh. Raspberries were super expensive, so I bought them frozen. I chopped up my strawberries, kiwi and apple and it looked so pretty in the bowl. The raspberries, thawed, were mushy and disgusting. So I mixed some of the mushy raspberries with the jam. It still tasted great, but I think it would have looked prettier (instead of a big bowl of jam) if I had left out the raspberries - and you wouldn't have even noticed if I had.
The cinnamon chips were incredibly easy to make - much to my relief. I will certainly be doing this recipe again, simply because those chips were so easy to make. 
I doubled up the recipe for a bridal shower (19 guests) and I really didn't have to. There's plenty for 19 people in one batch if you are serving other food.

This is fantastic!  I have made it twice this week and both times everyone has loved it!!  I changed the fruits a bit (I'm not fond of kiwi).  I used fresh pineapple, strawberries, apples, and a few marchino cherries.  I used my food processor and can't imagine cutting all that fruit without it.  Cut the fruit up into big chunks, dump it in the food processor and pulse a few times until blended and cut up.  It's amazing!  The chips took a bit more time.  Tho, they were worth it.  Very yummy!  :)

This recipe sounded unique and tasty and I decided to make it for a party we had last night.  Of the many items served, the salsa and chips received the most raving reviews.  

Making the salsa is straightforward but labor-intensive, in that there is a lot of chopping involved.  The chips were a little more difficult and time-consuming.  I was doubling the recipe, and I spent about 90 minutes preparing and baking the tortilla chips.  The chip-making process was a bit messy, too.  In the end, all the labor was worth it.  The chips and salsa are like nothing you've ever had!  

The only thing I will do differently next time is use smaller tortillas to get a more uniform sized chip; I found the wedges from the 10" tortilla to be too long and awkward.

This was awesome!  My fiance ate it up!  Strawberries were out of season so I just used strawberry preserves and I also added a small amount of canned mandarin oranges and chopped pineapple.  Will make again and again!

I used blueberries, strawberries, green grapes and a Gala Apple, diced very small [like you would find in a relish or pico de gallo] and mixed together.  Sometimes add some vanilla or strawberry yogurt keeps the fruit from falling off the cinnamon chips and omit the sugars and preserves. Very nice for a summer Hors D'Ouevers.

This recipe was a big hit at my Christmas party.  I added fresh mango & used pineapple preserves, which had a nice, light flavor.  The cinammon chips were very very popular as well.

My sister-in-law and I made this for Christmas dinner.  It was delicious, healthy and easy!  I would definately recomend it to anyone who likes salsa but is tired of the same old "hot stuff".  I think the fruit salsa would also be great on ice cream.

I took this for brunch on a "Wives Weekend" and it was a big hit!!  It ended up sitting for 2 days before it was used and I just drained the excess liquid and added the apple just before serving.  The chips alone were awesome!  I buttered them individually (VS spraying them with oil), then sprinkled the cinnamon and sugar on.  Thanks for sharing!

Love it, Love it, Love it.  I made this for fun on Saturday this summer.  My mother-in-law happened to stop by and try it and couldn't get enough.  I think she has passed this recipe on to everyone in her address book.  We have added black berries, blue berries, peaches..the list goes on and on.  You can substitute with just about anything you have and adding differet preserves changes the flavor just enough to surprise you.  Will definately make many times over!

This is a GREAT recipe -- One I get many complements and requests for.  One hint: When you make the tortilla's and aren't using them right away, you can store them in their original bag.  But after day two, they do go stale.  Doesn't matter, since they usually go as soon as they hit the plate!

Okay, when I read this recipe I said 'What's the big deal?' But I've made it twice now and it's been a huge hit both times. The chips can be made a little in advance, but the fruit turns soupy if you do. Leftover fruit can be good over ice cream as dessert the next day...with a couple of extra chips standing in the ice cream as a decorative (and tasty) touch!

This was fantastic when fresh.  I made some slight modifications:  I ran out of time, so I substituted cinnamon graham crackers for the chips, which seemed fine.  I omitted the apple (again, due to time constraints).  I added blue- and blackberries in place of the apple.  I used wild berry jam (to die for!), and next time I will definitely omit the sugar; it's too sweet.

I had never heard of fruit salsa when I stumbled upon this recipe and decided to give it a try.  Now I am glad I did because it has just about become a staple in my house.  The kids love it and so do their friends, and your right, it is great on ice cream!!

This was such a hit. Next time I'll use the smaller size tortillas to make the chips a little smaller. I used blackberries instead of raspberries and then used raspberry preserves. What a wonderful appetizer!! My kids loved the cinnamon chips alone too.

This was delicious and very easy!  I made it for a Mother's Day cookout and everyone raved about it!  I served it for dessert with the homemade chips (which were fantastic) and lemon and rasberry sorbet.  People put the salsa on top of the sorbet and said it was fantastic!  Great recipe!  Will definitely make again!

Very good recipe!  To make the tortilla chips, I actually coated both sides with sugar cinnamon.  I found that the ones I let brown more were much more crispier and yummier.  Be generous with the sugar cinnamon!

This recipe is absolutely wonderful.  However, I would not suggest making this for a party as it is very messy.  I think that the only people that would want to see you or even themselves with stuff falling all over is your own family (actually is kind of fun that way).  Maybe that is why some of the other views guest did not touch the dip.

Absolutely wonderful! EVERYONE at our get together just loved it and asked for the recipe. I've found that if you squirt a little bit of lemon juice on the apple slices before dicing, it will prevent them from browning while you prepare the other fruits, and if you have to store the salsa in a fridge for a couple of hours. Thanks for the great hit! :)

I made way more of the chips and there still weren't enough. Fruit salsa was awesome! It was suppose to be a dessert but ended up as an appetizer and an "all through dinner" munchie. Thanks for sharing!

This was just okay. The chips I cooked for minimal time and they were just too crispy. Also I followed the salsa recipe to a T and it actually wasn't that bad. They were good together but you have to make and eat the chips the day you want it.

This recipe is unique and tasty.  The chips were really fun to make!  My only problem with it was that it was quite messy to eat.  The salsa gets very juicy, and I couldn't stop the juice from running off my chips as I ate!  If you could find a way to make the chips so that they more curved, maybe that would help...

I made this for our office 4th of July party.  Talk about a hit!  All the women and some of the men wanted the recipe.  It was really easy to make, however it was a bit time consuming.  The chopping wasn't so bad, but the chips took a while.  It was well worth the time!  I made it the night before and let it sit in the fridge.  It was very juicy the next morning, so if you don't like a "juicy salsa" you need to serve shortly after making.  Personally, I loved the juices.  Makes for a great topping for ice cream, pancakes, waffles & crepes!  The chips are a meal in themselves and go great with the salsa.  A nice cool change from the same old boring appetizers!  I highly recommend!!! Just remember to set aside extra time for the chips!

Excellent Recipe!  I just served it this past Saturday for my son's 9th Birthday party and there was very little left.  I doubled the recipe (because I was serving 50 people) and I think there was only a cup leftover.  Also, when doubling you really only need 3 Tablespoons of Preserves especially if you make it a day ahead of time.  Makes a ton of juice if you leave overnight before serving (The kids used the juice on their ice cream after dinner).  And for the Cinnamon Chips.........They were PERFECT!!!!  Made these about 2 days in advance and sealed in an airtight container.(They extremely crispy).  Thanks to the individuals who posted a review with the pizza cutter idea.....IT WORKED GREAT!!!

i get the best compliments for the chips on this recipe.  The salsa becomes soupy very fast, may leave out the preserves next time.

FAR AND AWAY THE BEST DESSERT RECIPE YET!!  Took it to a party the other night and the kids scarfed down all the chips in the blink of an eye.  The adults then just took heaping spoonsful of the salsa on their plates!!  Every woman there wanted the recipe!  WHAT A HIT!!

I would highly recommend this to everyone.  Although it took some time to chop everything, it was well worth it.  I was waiting for the fruits to come into season so I could try it.  I omitted the raspberries, as I don't like all the seeds, but used raspberry seedless jam.  Perfect.  Only the tortilla chips weren't what I was expecting.  They were good, and we ate them up quickly, but it wasn't what was described in the reviews.  I used the leftover salsa on my waffle in the morning...wonderful!  I will definately make this time and again, even the chips, but also thinking of serving with something else.  Just don't know what....

This was good!  It is really unique and tastes great!  Everyone who tried it fresh loved it.  I'll do it again sometime but next time I'll have someone help me cut so it will go faster.

I tried this recipe last summer and loved it, so I took the recipe to my girl scout troop last month for a healthy snack they had to make for a badge.  I am co-leader of a Juniors troop, 4th to 6th grade so it was perfect.  The younger girls mixed the salsa and sprayed and sprinkled the tortilla chips, while the older girls and the leaders did the cutting and chopping.  IT WAS A MAJOR SUCCESS!!!  All the girls wanted the recipe to try at home.  As for myself, this is the third time I am printing the recipe because I have used it so often I keep messing up my recipes, guess I should laminate it!  Thanks for the great recipe!!!

This fruit salsa was amazing!  I served it to a party of 30 guests, and every person there loved it!  (I ended up having to have recipe cards printed up!)  Cutting the fruit was the time consuming part, but it was incredibly easy to make, and well worth the effort.  I substituted blueberries for raspberries and plum for the kiwi and used a pear preserve as the base.  I served it with the cinammon chips (which were fabulous all on their own, by the way!) and people could not stop raving about it!
I will DEFINATELY do this again!!!

Big Hit. Kiwis weren't in season when I made this, so used Rock Melon (Cantaloupe ?) instead. Happy to find this meant that I didn't need to add any sugar.

This is delicious! I used a pizza cutter to cut the tortilla shells,I was able to cut up at least 5 at a time,and sprayed the tortillas with the butter flavored pam after putting them on a foiled-lined baking sheet. 
I also used a food processor to cut up the fruit.
Thanks for a great recipe.

ABSOLUTELY, FANTASTICALLY, DELICIOUS!!!! This was the best! Everyone raved about it! I can not believe that it turned out so great! I used pear jam- something lighter than strawberry or raspberry since you already have the berries.
Will definitely make it again. The kids loved it too

I served this recipe at a party and it was a huge hit.  I cut the amount of strawberries in half and added some blueberries to the mixture.  It was delicious.  I made the chips the evening before the party, and found they were very simple to make.  I can't wait to serve this over the summer.  What a refreshing snack!

I loved this recipe, loved it, loved it.  Very easy and great twist on the standard chips and salsa.  I used a hot rasberry jam with the fruit to add an extra zip, it was great.  Just make sure you bake the chips enough so they stay crunchy with the fruit salsa.  Bravo, bravo!!

Went over so well think I will make again for a different group this weekend.  The fruit is such a nice, refreshing and unique combination.  Will do some changes with the chips (which I found tedious to make).  I don't care for the butter flavor spray so will try brushing with melted butter and using less cinnamon sugar.

WOW!!!  This salsa is absolutely scrumpous!!  I had a family birthday dinner for my daughter...we made it a Mexican feast and this salsa was a tremendous hit.  Even the family members who don't usually care for sweets went beserk over this dish.  I had to divide up the leftover salsa and chips and pass out copies of the recipe before everyone left.

I made this for a dinner party and everyone loved it. The chips were a big hit by themselves! I had left overs to share with some girlfriends the next day and it was a hit all over again. Definitely a keeper, and using frozen fruit will help in a time crunch.

Delicious!  I served it at a small party I had and everyone loved it and asked for the recipe.  Since some of the fruit was out of season and not very sweet, I mixed together strawberries, blueberries and raspberries with some white sugar and refrigerated it overnight.  I added the rest of the ingredients the next day, but cut the white sugar in half.  The chips took a little time to make, but were worth it.  This would taste even better with a little whipped cream on top or as an ice cream topping.  Thanks for sharing!!

I made a double batch of this recipe to take to a New Year's Eve party & it was a hit! 
It was the first dish to disappear & everyone asked for the recipe! Even though I had made extra chips, they were the first to go, but the guests continued to eat the fruit salsa over a New York cheesecake & Vanilla ice cream.
Next time I make this I'm going to serve it with an Angel Food cake.
Thank you!

A very refreshing change for an appetizer.  A hit with all my friends.  Can easily substitute other fruits, or use frozen varieties when its not "fresh" season!  Save some the next morning for on your pancakes!

The chips were very good, although they took a while to make. I made it for New Years and people didn't know that they went together. They thought the chips were a meal in themselves! Next time, I will explain the process. But it was something different. It is a good recipe

I really liked this fruit salsa. I didn't think the cinnamon chips were as good as other reviews have stated. I would love to find other ways to use the fruit though - maybe on ice cream or on a cheesecake. Very good. Thanks!

My kids love to help cook the chips.  They think it is a great recipe.  I also took it to a party, went over great.  I used a bag of frozen mixed berries and cut them up, apple and kiwi.  Turned out great and was quick.  I wouldn't recommend using the graham crackers as others suggested, half of the fun is the chips, and they don't take that long.  DEFINATELY A KEEPER!

I took this to a New Year's Eve party and it was the hands down favorite.  Everyone wanted the recipe.  I also recommending doubling the chips to use up more of the salsa.  The salsa would also make a terrific filling for breakfast crepes.

Excellent recipe!  I made this for a tailgate party this summer.  Everyone raved over it.  The chips were gone before the salsa, so I would advise making a double or triple batch.  I'm making it for Christmas too!

I actually made this back in June 01.  It was wonderful.  I froze what we didn't eat right away.  I took it out of the freezer in August, let it thaw overnight in the fridge and it still tasted great.  I am making it again for a Christmas party, and I think I will use other the advice of others and use cinnamon grahm crackers to save a little time.  Thanks for the great recipe Ann!

This was outstanding! I used a bag of frozen mixed berries with the apple and kiwi and it turned out just fine. The kids were mostly impressed that I had made the chips. It does make a lot of salsa but it is an excellent pancake topper the next day.

Took this to a party last night, and everyone loved it. The chips do take awhile, since they're cooked in a single layer and it takes a few batches to get enough baked. Two cups of cinnamon sugar is excessive...I only used about a cup, and I made extra chips.

This recipe is so different and really went over well at a large family gathering.  It is really sweet, though.  I served it as an appetizer but could have been a dessert.  At least 4  people asked for the recipe!!

Fantastic treat for parties.  Everyone loved the fruit.  I cut down on the sugar and did not add the fruit preserves.  I also baked the chips for longer than the recommended time to get them nice and crispy.

This is wonderful.  So easy to make and you can make it in advance.  I had to substitute 
blackberries for the rasperries (out of season) and it was great.  The cinnamon sugar chips are 
great snacks anytime with or without the salsa

Everyone LOVED this at my party - it was delicious.  I agree with the other reviewers - make extra chips and leave the extra time to do this, it is a slightly time consuming process.  Also this makes quite a bit, I doubled the recipe and really didn't need to!  Highly recommend making this - its is worth the work

This was fantastic. I served this to a group of people and I had several ask me for the recipe. My kids couldn't get enough of it. I will say that the cinnamon chips were a bit tedious to make, though very tasty. I'll definately be making this recipe in the future.

I made this for a carry in for work to day & so far it's a hit!  The prep time & cook time is really underestimated, however.  Cutting up all the fruit took over an hour, and the chips were at least a half hour.  But worth it.

delicious recipe!! We do not like kiwi so I changed the recipe a little. I use 4 apples, 2 pounds of strawberries and a pound or so of blackberries, 4 tbsp strawberry preserves and 3 tbsp sugar. I love my chips sugared on both sides so I butter both sides an dip them in sugar cinnamon mix and bake for 9 min to get them perfect for our family.

Amazing! I didn't respray with butter after I baked tortillas. I omitted the sugar in the dip- doesn't need it! I also add apricot marmalade, frozen peaches and whatever fruit sounds good at the time! (Kiwi, apples, raspberries, peaches,strawberries, blackberries, etc)

Just realized that I altered this recipe without meaning to and LOVED it how I made it.  I simply cut up the fruit, but didn't add the brown sugar, sugar or fruit preservatives.  The raspberries made enough "juice" to keep all the bits together.  Phenomenal combo with the chips! My mouth is watering just thinking about it.

This was tasty, but too sweet for us.  I would skip the added sugar in the fruit. The chips were on the bland side.  If I made this again I would experiment with the chips and come up with something different, perhaps something crunchier. I had lots of leftover, and it did stay fresh tasting until the next day.

I made this exactly as is and my chips were soft, soggy. I cooked another batch longer and got crispy chips but it was difficult to eat. The salsa was tasty and the idea is great.  I'll try again with  some adjustments, chips at a higher temp and flipping the chips, or cook with a deep fryer to get crisp. Fruit cut in tiny pieces in a viscous syrup might be the key to keeping it on the chip all the way to the mouth.

I have been making this for years and it is always a big hit... It is a little time consuming with all of the peeling and chopping, but it is worth it.  You can mix up the fruit for what you have available.  I have even thawed frozen peaches and used them, and it turned out great!

This recipe is easy, healthy, and delicious! I added a cup of pomegranate seeds for added texture & yumminess. It's a great potluck or tailgate standby. I did not make my own chips, though. I used store-bought cinnamon pita chips.

I have enjoyed this recipe foe many years. I prefer to use stone fruits (because they don't get messy as fast) to the softer fruits. I don't use the full amount of sugar and I always make the chips.  Thank you for such a wonderful recipe

I loved this! It's a great snack that goes a long way. The only thing I changed was that I left out putting the sugar and brown sugar in with the fruit. Only added the cinnamon sugar to tortilla chips. And I used strawberry preserves it was delicious!

This was amazing. I used raspberries, apples, strawberries and kiwi. I also used strawberry preserves. The chips were a little time consuming so next time I'll buy graham crackers as suggested in another review.

The cinnamon chips were awesome, however the fruit salsa was a little too sweet for me and my guests.  It needs a little tartness to balance the already sweetness from the additional preserves. Maybe just skip the preserves altogether!?

This was a big hit at my sorority meeting last night.  I used kiwi, apples, peaches, strawberries and raspberries for the fruit and orange marmalade and peach preserves to thicken and hold it together.  I cut the fruit VERY small, in fact some I put in my small electric food chopper for a few seconds.   It was really easy to scoop these smaller pieces onto the chips.  I didn't add any sugar to the fruit, since the marmalade was sweet.  No one seemed to think it needed to be any sweeter.  The chips added enough sugar to the overall taste.  I will definitely make this again, maybe even try different fruits.

I used Stacy's cinnamon pita chips to cut down on time, and raspberry preserves due to what I had on hand, but otherwise followed the recipe.  This was delicious, a fun and festive treat that went nicely with our "welcome summer" Memorial Day bbq. I made the salsa about 6 hours before putting it out and experienced no problems with the apples browning, despite what some reviewers have said.  Great recipe Ann!

Amazing!  I omitted the regular sugar and used honey with a splash of OJ and only used the fruit I had on hand.  Too lazy to make my own tortilla chips, I bought Stacy's brand of cinnamon sugar pita chips. Leftovers are amazing on waffles!

This was very Yummy.  I did as several others had suggested about not adding addition sugar.  Didn't find kiwis at the store so my fruit that was used was Fuji apples and banana (added closer to time to eat), grapes, mandarin oranges, strawberries and blueberries.  Used strawberry preserves.  DELICIOUS!!!! All three of my kids ate it up and will probably have more for breakfast tomorrow.  The chips I did as someone else suggested as well as far as spraying both sides, cutting with a pizza cutter and dredging in cinnamon sugar.  Will definately keep this one!!!

I used my food processor to chop the fruit. Worked great for the apples & kiwi, but it made the strawberries & raspberries too liquid-y. Next time I will dice those by hand. This was a hit at game night, and boyfriend ate the rest for breakfast the next day lol. I really loved the cinnamon chips--made two batches w/ two different brands of flour tortillas. One brand was thinner (Target's Market Pantry), so the chips were crispier. I preferred those.

I first found this recipe in the summer when most of the fruit could be purchased at it's peak of freshness. This is hands down, a FABULOUSLY fresh & delightful change from a typical appetizer!!! Our family & extended family LOVE this recipe & always request it for family gatherings. I followed the recipe exactly & it was perfect, don't change a thing. Take the time to make the cinnamon chips it's far superior to store made. A true family favorite.

This recipe is fantastic, the only change I make is using less sugar as the fruit preserves and fruit make it sweet already.

Yummy! I made this for a house warming party and everyone loved it.  As another reviewer suggested I didn't add any sugar to the fruit and I replaced the preserves with orange marmalade.

Wow - these two items are good alone, but together they are AMAZING!!  I used peach-mango preserves and Fuji apples (to avoid browning), but otherwise I used all the ingredients as listed.  Everyone wanted the recipe, and I will definitely be making it again.

This IS really great for a picnic!  Just the right amount of freshy sweetness needed for munching.  My children devoured it and so did I.   I almost exactly followed the recipe except I added blueberries and soaked the apple dices in lemonade to prevent browning.  Delicious!

Great, great recipe.  This has been a hit with everyone I've served it to.  I didn't add any white sugar and added only half of the brown sugar to the fruit and it is still plenty sweet.  I think the sugar in the preserves is more than enough.  Next time I make it, I will even try it without adding any sugar at all to the fruit.  The chips are great too - I've been using whole wheat tortillas, butter Pam, and dredging both sides in the sugar/cinnamon mix (1 cup sugar + 1 tsp cinnamon) - they taste great.  I've been adding the leftover fruit salsa to my cereal in the morning - there's a lot you can do with this recipe.

Delicious recipe! Local market didn't have fresh raspberries so I used raspberry preserves as my choice of preserve. Be careful not to chop/dice the fruits up too small b/c it will become very runny. (Did that the first time around but it doesn't affect the taste- was great both times!) Also, I chose to coat both sides of my chips w/ cinnamon sugar. These were a big hit- I had people eating just the chips by themselves. If your oven runs hot keep an eye on them! Definitely worth a try, you won't regret it!

BIG HIT!!! Very good and is a nice substitute to the brownies and cookies at family gatherings.  I did not have raspberries so I added blueberries. Very yummy! I also used apricot preserves and it blended very well with the fresh fruit.

This was delicious! Simple to make, and the fruit salsa can be made ahead of time...which is great when you're preparing a feast. :) My family couldn't get enough. They even enjoyed the chips on their own, and same with the fuirt salsa. This is definitely a new family favorite!

Wish I could give more stars.  This is the best recipe I have found on this site.  I have made this countless times, and it never turns out exactly the same (mainly because I use whatever berries look the best), but it ALWAYS turns out delicious.  I make the chips using low fat flour tortillas, sprayed with a little Pam and sprinkled with a mixture of cinnamon/sugar.  My kids think that the chips could be a dessert category.

I made this for a cinco de mayo potluck at work and it was the only thing that was eaten entirely.  I did not even get any.  I did add blackberries and blueberries and I only used 1 apple.  I also cheated and used cinnamon sugar pita chips.  But, my co-workers raved about how good it was.  Thank you so much for the recipe.

A little too sweet- would omit the fruit preserves next time and consider even less sugar. The chips cooked up surprisingly crispy.

Well, I won a cooking competition at work with this so of course I must give it a RAVE review!! Labor intensive with all the cutting and rounds of baking chips but DELICIOUS!! I used Fuji apples and half the called for sugar but those are the only changes I made. Super tasty!! The chips are SO good!!

Delicious! Our grocery store was out of raspberries but it was still good without them.I usedseedless raspberry preserves and made three cookie sheets of the cinnamon chips.I had leftover fruit dip ( 8oz cream cheese and 1 jar of fluff ) spread the dip on the chips and topped with salsa.You have to try it! My family loved this recipe and it was so easy! it's a keeper! Thanks for sharing!

LOVE IT!!!  Here are my changes:  sugar free preserves, add grapes, blueberries, blackberries, take out both the white sugar and brown sugar.  Sometimes I also just buy Stacey's cinnamon chips from the store if I don't feel like making the chips.  I have made this recipe for every party and it's always a HUGE hit.

Add another fan to those who love this recipe!  I think I could make this every day, and it would still be a hit.  I made it according to directions, and though one can substitute other fruits, this was a winning combination.Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

Been using a similar recipe for years using apricot preserves (2 T.) and omit the white sugar and use 2T of brown sugar. Add a little fresh squeezed orange juice (1-2T) for just a hint of orange flavor. It is a refreshing sweet summer treat!

I finally made this recipe & it was a great success. It tasted so fresh. It was nice to bring something different to a party. The combination of fruits can be tailored to your likes/dislikes. I used all the suggested fruits plus Braeburn apple, fresh pineapple, blueberries, blackberries & canned mandarin oranges. I used a "Vidalia Chop Wizard" to cut up the apples , pineapple.& strawberries.  It worked really well and chopped everything very uniformly. I rough chopped the blackberries & oranges. For the chips I lightly brushed w/melted butter, stacked 3 or 4 & cut into wedges. Then I shook in a bag w/sugar & cinnamon.  I think they were the real star. Everyone was munching & commenting on how good they were. I  purposely went light on the sugar in the fruit because the chips are sweet. Thanks for a great recipe.

Amazing! I did omit the additional sugar in the fruit and I am glad I did - it was sweet with just the fruit and preserves. I will definitely make this again!

A big hit at a recent baby shower I hosted.  I do recommend putting the chips on wax paper on the cookie sheet so the clean up is easier.

I love this recipe!  I am asked frequently to make it.  One really great presentation is to serve it in a hauled out fruit.  I think using a pineapple is the best, that way you can incorporate some of the pineapple within the recipe, which tastes great.

This was amazing.  Even my somewhat anti-fruit brother loved it.  I didn't add the brown or white sugar.  I don't think it needs it.  I used strawberry preserves.  I tripled the cinnamon chips and set up an assembly line to make it go faster.  I pre-cut all the tortillas, sprayed both sides, tossed them in a bag of sugar/cinnamon and it really didn't take that long.  This was a side dish that became one of the stars of the meal.

Hit of the party!  We used Granny Smith apples instead of the Golden Delicious, added blackberries, cut back on the white and brown sugar and used Apricot preserves...YUM!    We also used low-carb tortillas, which I don't know if I'd try again.  They needed to bake about twice as long as the recipes recommends and they still don't firm up as much as the regular tortillas probably do.  However, they still tasted fine and it was nice to know they were a little healthier.  On the flip side of that- we discovered that the cinnamon and sugar really makes the chips, so don't be stingy- dump it on!  ENJOY!

Super easy and delish!  I didn't use as much sugar for the salsa as the recipe advises - used maybe 1T of white and 1T of brown.  Will use even less next time and if berries are in season, I don't think I'll add any sugar.  The preserves sweatened it plenty.  Really was a delicious snack.  My husband, 2 year old and I ate the entire batch in one sitting.  I am very ashamed :)

Simple, but good. Short on time, so I used cinnamon graham crackers instead making the chips (like another person suggested) and it tasted great!

THIS WAS AMAZE-BALLS!   I used strawberry preservatives, fuji apples, blueberries (because I hate raspberries), and strawberries. I used white sugar the first time I made it, but I just put a teaspoon in the 2nd time. I couldn't really tell the difference.   The tortilla chips were delicious too. The first time, all I had was Pam to spray on it. It was good. The 2nd time, I got the I can't Believe it's Not Butter Spray..... amazeballs. I sprayed the butter on just one side. I sugared/cinnamoned them by shaking them up in a bag. And, I put them in muffin tins to get the curve shape. Delicious treat.

Holy cow, this is so good!  I made this for a work luncheon and people could not get enough of it!  I used two ripe peaches in place of the kiwi and used raspberry jam. I also used frozen, thawed raspberries.  Can't wait to make this  again.  Thanks for sharing!

This recipe was a huge hit with men, women, teens, and children. I could not find raspberries, ao I substitued with blue berries.   I generously added cilantro and substituted sugar with splenda and the brown sugar with splenda brown sugar mix.  I also used natural preserves, no sugar added.  I used Cinnamon sugar graham crackers instead of chips for the kids.  The adults and teens ended up eating more as a salad with very little chips.  I made it as an appetizer, but it followed us to the table as a wonderful compliment to the ham and pork loin.  Every single person asked for the recipe and some called within a few days to say they had already made it.    It is on our menu for Super Bowl Sunday!

Unique recipe. It turned out great for a gathering. Tasted delicious with even a little cantaloupe and pineapple and without the raspberries. I did find it a little hard to know when the tortillas were done with the cinnamon on them, but maybe that's just me.

The raspberries at the store were sad so I added dried cranberries instead. I used the Pampered Chef food chopper to make the chopping easy. I used the pizza cutter to cut up the tortillas. I only used 8 and had plenty of chips left over. Great recipe for healthy food.

Very good. I only used 1tbs of sugar and 1tbs of brown sugar. I used apricot perserve. I tried to find the chips in the store so I didnt have to make them but I could only find them in small bags. They were easier to make than I thought!!! I did exactly what it said to do on the chips I used 4:1 ratio of sugar to cinnamon!

Very good!!! Last time I made this, I used two bags of frozen fruit instead of the expensive and out of season fresh fruit (one was a berry blend - blueberries, raspberries, blackberries, strawberries; the other was peaches, mangos, grapes, and honeydew melon), I omitted all of the sugar, and I used 3 tablespoons of sugar free honey instead of fruit preserves.   I cut the tortillas up using seasonal cookie cutters, and I dipped them in melted butter, then lightly patted each side with a mix of 1 cup Splenda sugar substitute and 1 1/2 teaspoons of cinnamon. This was VERY good and was diabetic friendly! A huge hit at our family party!!

This is delicious! Left out the White Sugar, would have been fine to leave out the brown sugar as well. Used Fuji apples since thats what we prefer and used Raspberry Preserves. I will hang on to this recipe! Thanks so much! :)

I took this salsa to a party last night and it was a hit.  I ended up taking out the raspberries and putting in 1 lb. of frozen peaches and used peach preserves.  It was wonderful!  The tortillas were a hit too!

Absolutely delicious! However, I don't add any sugar at all, and I use blackberry preserves as the matrix to hold it all together. It gives the salsa a darker color, but I love the flavor. I like to add bananas to the mix, and I make light work of chopping all the fruits by using my collard chopper (the serrated round tool with the wooden handle). The chips are fantastic as well! I make this for a lot of large get-togethers, and I come home with an empty bowl nearly every time.

I make this for almost every gathering/party I go to now. I bought a Vandalia Onion chopper and it works wonderful on all of the fruit and cuts it into perfect bite size chunks and cuts the clean-up/prep time in half!

I have been putting off trying this recipe for years.  I finally broke down and made it as an appetizer for Christmas dinner.  WOW, this was a complete success and followed the directions precisely.  I will make this for many occasions to come.  Summer BBQ's are a must!

This is super yummy!  It is a hit everytime I make it, and I always have to give the recipe out!  I make it almost as directed.  A few changes are, I don't add the preserves all the time (if I have it I do) I don't really notice much of a difference with it.  Also I use an 8 inch tortilla, and I cut them with a pizza cutter, place them on the pan, spray them, then add the cinnamon and sugar, I think it's much easier this way.  Enjoy!

We tried this out when my wife and I went down to my parents' house to visit. It was a huge hit! So much that my folks even decided to make it a few weeks later as an hors d'oeuvre before our big family Thanksgiving dinner. One thing I tried the first time was chopping all the fruit using a food processor. It saved us time, but everything ended up looking pureed. (It still tasted wonderful.) The second time we made it, we chopped the fruit by hand and it looked much more appetizing, and had the same great flavor. We melted butter to brush over the tortillas before sprinkling on the cinnamon and sugar. It was a piece of cake!  One caution I can give to anyone trying this is to make sure the tortillas stay in the oven until they're somewhat crispy. We took out one batch a little too early and while they were much more firm than raw tortilla, they were a little to flimsy to hold a big pile of fruit salsa.

This is a fantastic appetizer especially for the summer.  You can substitute different fruits especially changing to your favorite types of berries.  I've made the chips the night before and stored them in plastic storage bags with no problems.  I spray and sugar both sides of the tortilla and I found it easier to cut the wedges after they were sugared.

I made just the way it states, except I left out the raspberries. Everyone ate it up and got gave rave reviews. The chips on the other hand I would give a 1 star. I made them but they weren't sweet enough or crispy enough for me. My step-daughter said i should do both sides. So I turned them over and sprayed and sprinkled and baked for another 8 minutes. They were nice and crispy and sweet. Everyone loved them and were snacking on them all through party.

This was an awesome addition to my menu for my girls night out! It was a huge hit and was gone at the end of the night! I followed someones suggestion to bake the tortillas in a cupcake pan to make the chips easier for dipping and they worked great! Thanks so much for the great recipe.

This is delicious! I especially like the "4th of July style" idea. I will try that next year. I may try a Christmas style, with apples, strawberries, raspberries and kiwi and cut the chips in holiday shapes. Can't wait to make this again!

This is great!  I personally make a "poor man's" version.  I leave out the raspberries and kiwis, but add in grapes.  You don't miss them and makes this recipe much more affordable.    Also, rather than chop up all the fruit, I toss them in the blender and pulse until the consistency is about right.  Saves a lot of headaches!  AND, rather than make the chips, I use regular tortilla chips, spray with cooking spray, sprinkle with cinnamon and sugar, then put in a 350 oven for a few minutes.  Take them out, stir, and repeat until the chips have enough sugar and cinnamon for your tastes.

I wasn't sure how this would turn out, but it was delicious!!!  I used several different fruits in the salsa ans grape jelly.  I also made it a couple of hours ahead of time and it kept really well.  The chips were very easy and delicious!  I will definitely be making this again!!

I'm only rating the chips as I did not make it to the salsa.  The chips were deliciously crispy and sweet. My live in tasters were pleased and begged for more. I pled exhaustion (no, I did not feel guilty) and said "maybe tomorrow".  They don't need to know how easy the chips were to make.  Will be doing them again.

Made it for a get together and it was a hit.  Kept leftovers and it was great the next day.  I followed reviews and didn't add white sugar and it was perfect.

I made this and brought it to a Harvest Celebration, WONDERFUL!  Everyone loved it!  I used 2 Kiwi, 1 Mango, 2 Granny Smith Apples, 16oz of Strawberries, 2 pints of Raspberries, and a little more than 3 heaping T of homemade Peach Jam.  The added sugar was not necessary.  Next time I think I'll add a bit of cinnamon and/or nutmeg.  Sooooooo Good!!!

Made this a couple of times and people love it. I cut the sugar quite a bit because I prefer more natural sweetness. When you run out of chips you can slather the fruit on some vanilla ice cream. Yum!

I have made this recipe a few times and it always goes over great.  It is a little time consuming to cut all of the fruit so small but well worth it!

I put peaches, pineapple, kiwi, strawberries, and apricot jam in mine and excluded the sugar. It was amazing. A very good choice for a summer dessert!

The chips were delicious! For the apples, I used Fuji apples and put a squirt of lemon juice on them to keep from browning and this recipe does NOT need any extra sugar.  I followed advice of other reviewers and sprayed the tortillas with spray butter, sprinkled cinnamon sugar over each side, then cut with a pizza cutter.  Placing the tortillas on a cooling rack in the bottom of the sink while spraying and sprinkling makes a HUGE difference in clean up.  The more sugar in your cinnamon/sugar mix, the crispier your chips will be (I found that too much cinnamon makes them a tad chewier).  My eaters kept saying the tasted like churros - YUM!

I made this for a Christmas party with teacher friends and they loved it! My husband was impressed with the sugar free strawberry glaze I used for the fruit salsa, being a diabetic, he really enjoyed it. Every now and then there are Cinnamon Sun Chips, when you don't have the time to make the tortilla chips, and those are just as tasty.

You can't go wrong! Everyone loves this and what a great way to eat fruit. I've made it many different ways and they're all good.  It is great without any sugar in the salsa . .just a touch of sugar- free apricot preserves and it's good to go.  I actually like it without the raspberries and adding yumnmy mango or peach is fantastic.  Coat both sides of tortilla with cooking spray, dredge in cinnamon sugar and bake minutes for a nice crispy chip.

This is really good.  I deep fried my tortilla's instead of cooking them in the oven.  I did not add extra sugar to the fruit and used raspberry jam.  The slightly tart taste of the fruit paired with the sweet chips was great.

I love this recipe!  I have made it several times now, and everyone else loves it too!  I omit the raspberries, and I use apricot preserves.  The chips are delicious, but I have found that in a pinch, pretzel chips go great with this as well.

This is a fabulous summer treat!  The local store had no raspberries so I used peaches and raspberry preserves.   I agree with other reviewers that there is a little too much sugar but other than that it is wonderful!

I have made this many times with just about any fruit and .  I do not put quite as much sugar in and while the fruit is sitting before I put sauce on it, I coat it in a half a lemon to prevent browning and to add some flavor.

Delicious and very flexible.  This time, I used Fuji apples, mango, peaches, blueberries, kiwi, watermelon and a homemade blueberry/cherry/rhubarb jam.  I've made other variations in the past, and really....how can you go wrong with such tasty fruits?  I made the cinnamon chips years ago and this time picked some up from Trader Joe's.  I think I will go with Trader Joe's from now on - they're really good, and so much easier!!

what a great way to get fruit on the table!  this recipe is very flexable.  you could substitute many different fruits and it would still taste good.  i did leave out the sugars, though, with fresh fruit.  you may need a little with not-so-fresh fruit.  my only complaint is that the recipe does not tell you how to mix the cinnamon and sugar.  i had to read that in another review.  and the method of cin/sugar distribution on the tortillas is a bit time consuming.  i used the suggestion of the ziplock bag method, and that worked great!  my 13 year old daughter did that part, and she had no problems with it.  if you are baking the tortilla on a stone pan, it will take a couple of minutes longer for the chips to get krispy.

A good flavour, but way too runny!!  If I make this recipe again, I'll omit the sugar and add the kiwi, raspberries, and apple right before serving so everything doesn't look like red mush.  The cinammon chips were good but plan on cooking them longer than 10 minutes so they get crunchy.

I thought this was pretty tastey but on a table of food for a party - it went untouched.  I put it in containers in the freezer and thought maybe I could convert to a smoothy.

I left the raspberries whole since they are so small to start with.  This was a huge hit with kids and adults.  Might use just a tad less sugar next time.

I made this for a potluck/cookout, over 100 people. It was a hit. I used more apples, less raspberries, and added no sugar. Pure fruit. It was great. I think you could use the leftovers as a fruit smoothie, but I never have any.

Easy to make! The salsa is amazing!!!!! Only used one apple, and about 3/4 pound strawberries and no brown sugar--it was sweet enough with it added! But GREAT!!! Chips were great too, I'd recommend only cooking for 5-7 minutes..did it at 8-9 and they were burnt. GREAT RECIPE! :)

Absolutely amazing! I also followed some tips on here as well. I did not add sugar to the fruit but I DID add Rose'e Lime to keep the fruit from turning brown and to add extra flavor. Let me tell you, that made it! But, it has to be Rose's lime, not just plain ol lime juice. Made the chips as directed and they were delicious! Will be making this for years to come.

This was quite good. Its does need to set for awhile after making it though to allow the flavors to meld. The hubby loved it and asked if i could make it again on the weekend.

I love this recipe, and so does everyone else!!! I loved the advice to make extra chips, they are so good!! I didn't use the rasberries though. I used 4 oz of frozen peaches and 4 oz frozen mangos instead with apricot marmalade and I didn't add the extra white sugar just brown. Sooooooo yummy!! Be sure to drain the fruit for as long as you can!! It makes a big difference. Love it!!

This was a big hit at the graduation party I took it to. I omitted the sugar, and it was sweet enough, and healthier too. This recipe is a lot of work, but worth it. Thanks!

I LOVE this recipe.  It was a sleeper hit at gatherings.  At first, only a few people tried it.  Now it is a must "bring".  Even the kiddos like it.  I buy the chips at Trader Joes.

I omitted the apples and added about 1 teaspoon cayenne pepper and served over cream cheese. It was the hit of the party. Will be using again. Thanks!

The chips were great, super easy using butter spray and a plastic bag to shake them in.  I used the fruit for the salsa as a guideline, I had a bunch of extra fruits and just put them all in.  Huge hit at girls night!

This recipe was superb!  I think you could omit the brown and white sugar but it was fine...used the exact fruits called for but I used frozen raspberries.  I used butter flavored Pam, then sprinkled the sugar/cinnamon then sprayed again...I then used a pizza cutter to cut it into wedges and placed on the cookie sheet...much easier than trying to sprinkle after they were cut...will definitely be making this again...used apricot preserves...awesome...thanks!!

This is awesome. For the fruit I did red delicious apples, kiwi, peaches and strawberries. I also added the strawberry jelly. For the chips spray first, then cut into pieces with a pizza cutter, and then dredge into the sugar mixture. I did not respray - I don't think it needs it.

The kids loved the chips more than the salsa. Even making the chips alone is a great treat. I would dice up the apple and kiwi pretty tiny as well as the strawberries to make it more like traditional salsa.  If you leave the pieces too big - it doesn't scoop well. Great summer, refreshing recipe!

This was fantastic. I only had strawberries, blueberries, & kiwi. I also only had grape jam. I was hesitant as to how that would taste, but it was amazing! I omitted the white sugar---it was very sweet, as other replies suggest.   The cinnamon chips were also absolutely wonderful!  This recipe is a great, delicious way to use up fruit!

Everyone loved this salsa! I made it the night before going to my dads for Father's Day.  I used strawberries, kiwis, raspberries, and a gala apple.  To cut down on sugar (diabetic) I used Splenda and the juice of half a lemon to keep the apple from turning brown.  The next day I made the chips as per directions.  For some reason my chips were tough.  I followed the instructions but my chips were hard to chew.  They tasted good just tough.  I don't know if it was the flour tortillas or me but it's the reason for four stars instead of five.  The fruit salsa is a solid five stars.

This dish hasn't even made it to my party yet and I've already shared the recipe.  I couldn't find raspberries, so I chopped up a peach instead.  For the fruit preserves, I happened to have a jar of rose petal jelly in the fridge (can't even remember where that came from), but I added that and, wow!  It's sure to be a hit at the baby shower tonight!

Really delicious! I used apricot preserves and added peaches. For the chips, I highly recommend spraying the tortillas on both sides with butter flavor cooking spray and then coating with cinnamon sugar mixture. (I do this on some wax paper to cut back on the mess.) Stack the tortillas, then cut them into triangles. This was a huge hit with my friends and family!

This is an amazing dish.  The trick is to get all of the fruit a uniform size, best if it is all very small pieces.  I have made this several times and found that plums, raspberries, cherries, strawberries, grapes & apples work the best other fruits are either too mushy of overpowering.  I serve this with the Carla's Fruit Dip recipe.

Very tasty. I made this for a BBQ and it was a huge hit. I used granny smith apples, blueberries, kiwi, strawberries and raspberries. For the preserves I used apricot. Next I might try the pineapple preserves. I also omitted the white sugar and used only brown, and sometimes I even use honey. I made my tortilla chips out of wheat tortillas and I have also used trader joe's cinnamon sugar pita chips. Both are great!

I used raspberry jam and added quartered green grapes and blueberries (just because I had them - but they were my favorite part!)I also used the suggestion of stacking the tortillas after spraying, then cutting (with a pizza wheel), and shaking in a bag of the cinnamon/sugar mixture. Everyone loved this salsa!

I've made this twice and everyone loves it. I don't add any sugar or jam/jelly to the fruit - fruit is sweet enough as-is and doesn't need it. Just mix the sliced fruit together & made the cinnamon chips. Mmmm... yummy!

I didn't make the cinnamon chips, but both my husband and I really loved the fruit salsa. I played around with the amounts of the fruits to get it where we liked it and used raspberry jam. We ate it on top of sopapillas, and when the sopapillas were all gone, my hubby ate it with a spoon! Next time I want to try adding some watermelon and pineapple, but I was in a hurry last night, so it didn't happen.

I made this recipe for Easter and it was the favorite item on the table.  Everyone loved it.  I did not tell them how easy it was to make, I made them beleive it took me forever.  The only thing I changed was I served them with a sweet cracker because I accidentally bought Corn Tortillas instead of flour.  it worked out great.

This was one of the best things we've ever eaten! It's so versatile, too. I couldn't get raspberries, so I used some blackberries & blueberries, and one Tbsp. less sugar than called for. Those cinnamon/sugar chips are a great thing, too. Those must be the cheapest, easiest dessert ever, and such a yummy snack. This is a really great recipe for those young cooks to try. What a hit - thank you!

I have made this recipe so many times and everyone raves about it.  It is especially good in the summertime.  I do not add the brown sugar because I think it makes it a bit too sweet.  I also dice all of the fruit the same size because it makes it look nicer.  I always use real melted butter for the tortillas and not the spray because everything is better with real butter.  It coats the tortillas better too. Now when I bring it to a holiday or a party, I print a few copies of the recipe out because I know that everyone will be asking for it.

Great for cookouts or as a summertime dessert.  The fruit salsa can also be made with honey instead of the white/ brown sugars and topped off with a scoop of your favorite flavor ice cream.

This is awesome! Brought it to a party last night and everyone loved it! I added a container of blueberries too and used 2 Fuji apples instead of golden delicious. I also used only 1 TB sugar and omitted the brown sugar as others suggested. The chips were so yummy! Although pretty time consuming. I used 3 packages of 12 flour tortillas. Thanks for a great recipe! Definitely will be making again!!!!

I got tons of compliments on both the dip and the cinnamon chips. Both were pretty easy to make. I put all the fruit into my food processor and then stirred in strawberry jam after. It was runnier than in the photo shown that way (and I had a lot extra - I would recommend tripling the amount of chips because they go fast) but very delicious. For the chips, I mixed the cinnamon and sugar in a bowl, sprayed the chips with cooking spray and dropped them into the mix. Very easy and a hit!

I added pineapple and would probably leave out the kiwi next time, since it turned brown really fast.  The cinnamon tortillas also provided a healthier version of elephant ears and were awesome on their own!

I haven't tried the salsa yet, but I used the chip recipe with pumpkin cream cheese dip and adored it.  Also works well (even better, I think) with pita pockets split in half.  The pita holds up better to dip; less breaking as you're trying to scoop.

I've made this so many times now.  Every time, I get asked for the recipe and I never have any leftovers.  I cut back a little on the sugar.  I also prefer apricot jam.  Really it all mixes together and nobody can tell which jam you used anyhow.  For the chips, I spray an entire tortilla, sprinkle it with the cinnamon and sugar and repeat for each, stacking them as I go.  Once I have a stack, I just cut them with a knife.  Saves lots of time.  Also, because they bake so flat, I've learned to lay them around the edge of a cookie sheet so they're more scoopable.

I'm giving this 5 stars because I'm going to eat it all, but somehow it isn't really a 5-star recipe for me personally. I did change the fruits in it quite a bit though, so maybe that's the problem. I used pluots, black plums, nectarines, & frozen mixed berries. The tortilla chips are very tasty, and I will probably make those again just to snack on, but the fruit just wasn't as tasty as the chips. We decided it was a waste of tasty chips to put that fruit on them and I'm going to turn that salsa into a cobbler :) All in all this recipe was a success for me because it did produce food we're going to eat, and because it did produce food I would serve to company--just not food I would slave over again for just me and my husband!

This was a hit at one of our weekly Girls Nights.  It was very light yet sweet enough to fulfill that dessert craving.  Everyone loved it and it was so easy to make.  I changed the recipe slightly by adding blackberries and mango....Delish!  I did not use the a fruit preserves because it was sweet enough, but I may try it next time.  Thanks so much for the wonderful recipe!

This is a fantastic recipe! The reason why I gave it 4 stars is because I changed quite a bit of it. I think the recipe gives you a great idea to run with. I used fresh plums, mango, Fuji apple, strawberries and blackberries. I mixed it with Tayberry jam and substituted the additional sugar for honey. It was fantastic. As for the cinnamon chips, they were great and pair perfectly with the fruit salsa. I sprayed both sides of the tortilla then tossed the tortilla in a large plastic bag with the cinnamon sugar mixture and laid it out onto a baking sheet. Turned out great!

Made this for the my SuperBowl party and it was the number one food item there.  I used Gala apples instead and Welch's Strawberry Spread and it was great.  I will definately make this one over and over.  I had several ladies ask me for the recipe.

This was VERY yummy - and you can use whatever combination you feel like creating.  Hightly recommend getting a Vidalia chopper - makes dicing the fruit (that can be put through a chopper) a breeze.  I used Stacy's cinnamon pita chips versus making my own. Good summer, healthy snack.

I love this recipe.  To make it healthier for me I cut out the sugar and preserves and made the chips with whole wheat tortillas.  I also add in other fruits sometimes, whatever I think might go well.  My boyfriend and I couldn't stop eating it.

Wonderful recipe, thanks so much for sharing! I halved the recipe because I was only serving 4 people and there was still plenty of leftovers. I also halved the sugar and it was still a tad too sweet so next time, I'll omit entirely.  I also didnt make the pita chips. Instead, I purchased a bag of Stacy's Pita Chips in Cinnamon Sugar flavor. Wheat thins also makes a cinnamon flavor

I made this recipe exactly as the directions said, but I seved the fruit in a tortilla bowl, as another member suggested.  It was perfect!! It was voted "Best Dish of the Night", and the recipe was requested by almost everyone there!! Thank you, this is a keeper for our family.

This is absolutely wonderful!! Takes a lot of time to chop up everything but AMAZING! One more note... when it says so many servings it means that. I made 10 servings thinking my husband and I would eat most of it since the servings are usually so little but I can eat this everyday and have leftovers all week. Scale it down if it is just a few eating.

This was amazing - I have made it twice now. Agree with others - no additional sugar is necessary on top of the fruit as it makes it liquidy. I just added the perserves and it was delicious. Also, like others - I found it easier (and for more coverage) to cut the tortillas in 8ths, spray with pam on both sides and then dredge them with the sugar/cinnamon mixture with no additional pam on top. They crisp up just fine. I upped the temp just a tad and monitored for crispness. Thsi is truly a hit.

I made this substituting a bag of Publix mixed berries for the strawberries and raspberries.  It was delicious!  Vanilla wafers or ginger snaps work equally well if you don't have time to make the cinnamon tortilla strips.

The fruit salsa is surprisingly good for such a simple recipe! I've served it twice at gatherings and both times people loved it and asked for the recipe! I used apricot jam as recommended in some other reviews. For the tortilla chips, I used 1/4 cup real melted butter (brushed on) instead of the spray and half a cup sugar with a tablespoon cinnamon mixed in.  I had just enough and I can't imagine them any sweeter!  Thanks for the great recipe!!

This is unbelievably good!  I did use other fruits than those listed...I bought a Dole frozen mix with strawberries, pineapple, mango, and peaches, and then added the 2 kiwis.  I got tired of chopping all the fruit so I skipped the apples.  This is GREAT!

Everytime I make this, everyone always wants the recipe. It's such a great, lite appetizer year-round. Also, I sometimes do not feel like making homemade chips so instead I buy the Cinnamon Stacy's brand pita chips. I have never made this with raspberries before but i'm sure that would be wonderful too.

I Really liked this alot. I used thawed,& drained frozen raspberries with the fresh fruit, very good, just watch the amount of raspberries because they could overpower the taste of the other fruit. The chips were sooo good.

Chopping the fruit small is a must. I made this as written, and it was fabulous.  I used very good quality fruit, and used Dickenson's Raspberry Preserves. I am not a kiwi fan, but it really adds something tangy to this refreshing salsa. It's a summer party must have!!!!

This was a hit!  I used frozen strawberries because there were no impressive strawberries at my local store.  I did not let them completely thaw and probably should have because it made the salsa  watery but otherwise it was YUMMY!  Especially the chips!  Not a drop left!  Even my 3 year loved it!  Thanks!

I just thought this was okay.  I personally don't think it deserves the rave reviews it has, but it certainly isn't terrible.  I served it at a Christmas party and not many people even touched it.  I'm not sure why.  I'm not sure if I'll make it again.  It's good, but I thought it would have been better based on the reviews here.  It was just so-so.

I used frozen peaches, pinnapple tidbits (which I also chopped) instead of the rasberries.  After making batches of the chips, I learned that the dark-coated baking sheets require the chips baking time to be 9 minutes and light ones 10 minutes.  I also added 2 tablespoons of lemon juice, cinnamon, and nutmeg.

I loved this recipe! I made this for Christmas Eve at my in-laws and it was a big hit -- the flavors in the dip were great.  I used 2 tsp. of Smuckers' Sweet Orange Marmalade and 1 tsp. of Apricot preserves along with an 8 oz. bag of frozen berries (strawberries, raspberries, blueberries, and blackberries) that I bought at Walmart for less than $3!  Then I added 1/2 a bag of frozen peaches and 1 Fuji apple -- it ended up being delicious! Oh, and I kept the sugar in the recipe and it did make it a little runny but the flavor was wonderful.

We made this for a family get together and it was a hit with the whole crowd. Absolutely delicious. And the dip is great on pancakes or waffles the next morning.

This is time consuming as others have said but well worth it.  The chips are to die for.  I used orange marmalade but I think I will try peach or apricot preserves in the future.  I could take the orange marmalade over some of the fruit.  I substituted blackberries for the raspberries.

Absolutely delicious! I had to alter the recipe a bit due to the unavailability of fruit in the winter season in Nebraska. I used 1 bag of frozen berry blend (strawberries, cherries, blackberries, raspberries, and blueberries), 2 braeburn apples, 1 bartlett pear, apricot preservers, and the rest the same as the recipe. I was surprised at the large amount that it made. I saved half and used it with yogurt, ice, and fruit juice in smoothies. It was fabulous both ways. I will make this again!

I was hesistant at first to make this because I wasn't sure of how it would turn out but it is delicious!! Although I've made wayyy too much salsa, the chips and salsa tasted amazing! I followed the recipe perfectly but I couldn't find any cinnamon sugar at the store so I made my own - 1/4 cup of granualted sugar to 4 teaspoons of ground cinnamon. Perfecto!

As if this recipe even needs another review. This is totally worth every step it takes to make. So delicious, keeps well for several days in the fridge and chips in a zip top bag. Taste like dessert. A crowd pleaser.

Awesome!  I made this for our monthly Bunco game and it was a hit.  I omitted most of the sugar as I felt it didn't really need it.  I also brushed the flour tortillas with real butter and sprinkled them with the cinnamon sugar and it worked really well.  I baked them a little longer as we like them crispy.  Will make this again and again

A huge hit at every party I've taken it to.  The only change I made was to omit the sugar -- it is sweet enough with just the fruit preserves.  
Great summer recipe.

I made this as an appetizer for a Girl's Night Out and it was a huge hit! I made a ton of salsa and chips, but came home with a few scrapings at the bottom of the bowl. I used orange preserves and premixed cinnamon sugar. People have requested that I make this again.

Awesome and makes a LOT of salsa!  I doubled the recipe and that was a mistake...we had more salsa than we knew what to do with.  When I make this again I won't cut the fruit so small using my chopper.  We made double chips too and that was a huge hit.

I wanted to love this and it was pretty good, but not five stars for me. I didnt have butter flavor cooking spray so I used regular cooking sray on one batch and melted butter on the other..needless to say that worked well. Everyone in the house like the chips, thought they were tasty and different. The Fruit salsa was a little tart for my taste but it didnt stop me from eating some! I imagine a simple change of fruit would make a difference.

This was a great recipe.  I followed some of the suggestions from other reviews and they worked out great.  I used a food chopper to dice the fruit and I purchased the chips rather than making them. I added sugar free Apricot jam. The next time I make it I will omit both sugars because I think it will be sweet enough with it.

The salsa was sooooooo good. I could definitely just eat the salsa by itself and be quite happy. My chips did not come out crunchy enough for my taste. Next time I'll probably just buy apple chips or something.

This was fantastic! The only reason I gave it 4 stars was because of the chips.  To me, they were hard to make and didn't taste all that great for the effort.  I will use store bought cinnamon chips next time!

Hate to say it, but I'm not a fan of this recipe.  I love everything in it but put together it was nothing more than sweet mush.  I like my salsa with a kick.  This is too much like unjarred jam.

YUM! I used less sugar becasue the fruit has natural sweetness, I also used spreadable butter instead of the spray, and I coated each side of the chip with butter and the cinnamon mix.I had to bake an additional 3-4 min for crispiness.  Will use again

Used 1 apple, added 1 peach and used seedless blackberry jam. Bought cinn/sugar pita chips and it was perfect! Took more than 15 minutes prep time, but worth it!

This really is very good - I've made it a couple of times & varied the fruit depending on what i had - works with almost anything! and if you want to skip the cinnamon chips, go get the cinnamon pita chips at tjoes. Yum!

We love this recipe!  I always use strawberries, kiwi and one apple plus whatever other fruit I have on hand.  I just add fruit preserves and no extra sugar.  It's sweet enough that way.  Everyone loves this when I make it!

I made this for a house warming party and it was a hit! It was very light and delicious. I added pineapple and some cinnamon to the salsa. 
also, the cinnamon chips were a flop for me, but i used cinnamon wheat thins and they were awesome. 

also, it was a good ice cream topper if you crush the cinnamon wheat thins over the top and ad some of the salsa. 

mmm, thanks for a great recipe!

I used apples, peaches, strawberries and blueberries (my kids wont eat kiwi) and used seedless, sugar-free raspberry preserves and mixed that with the juice of a 1/2 of lemon then mixed it with the fruit. Didnt use any of the sugars, it really is only added calories! Making the baked homemade cin chips were time consuming, but good....and I used wheat tortillas. Healthy and refreshing alternative!

Absolutely divine! Healthy (without the sugar which isn't necessary), filling and super-easy to make. This recipe is ideal for those who, like me, hate piles of dirty pots and dishes after a cooking spree in the kitchen. Minimal mess and maximum taste.

This was soooo delish!!!!!! It really is versatile too.  I made mine with strawberries, kiwi, a pear, nectarines (firm, not soft ones), pink lady apples, and blueberries.  I used raspberry preserves and the sugars listed.  I took this to a family reunion, and it was a hit!!!!! I can't wait to make this again, and  this is a wonderful way for any adult or child to get their fruit intake.  I made the chips the night before, and they were still crisp the next afternoon.  I was sooo scared to make this,and be disappointed, but disappointed I was not.  Thanx for an awesome recipe... oh yeah, cut your fruit by hand, not with a chopper.  It stays more firm this way.  Don't make this if you are crimped for time, it really is time consuming.

Ecellent recipe-as stated in previous reviews, I sprayed both sides of each tortilla with PAM, cut them with a pizza cutter into wedges, then coated them with cinnamon by shaking them in a ziplock bag.  I doubled the chip recipe, but not the salsa as most people would eat the chips without the salsa.  My salsa got a little runny during the party, so I ended up straining out the liquid out (saved it for ice cream topping--mmm).  I used kiwi, strawberries, gala apples and raspberries.  I think I will try adding peaches next time I make it as suggested by other reviewers.

I served this for a party and it was delicious!  Since I didn't have any butter flavored spray, I brushed melted butter instead which was easy and worked great.  I only used about 1/2 cup or less of the cinnamon sugar - the 2 full cups would be way too much.  I served the leftovers over belgium waffles in the morning.  Delish!

Delicious!  I brought this to a picnic and had several requests for the recipe.  Just be careful not to bake the cinnamon chips too long - they do become more crispy after they cool.

I have considered making this recipe several times in the past & I'm so glad I finally made it!  It was awesome! Also, I thought about buying chips instead of making them, but I'm happy I decided to make them, they were the hit of the evening! The chips are great with or without the dip, and really not difficult to make.

This recipe is excellent. Per another review I used graham crackers and that worked out very well. I didn't add as much sugar as mu husband and I are trying to cut down on it but it was still great! Thank you for yet another great recipe!

Very Tasty!  We took it camping with us.  I used a blender to chop/mix everything together just a little bit.  It made for a more mingled flavor.

Awesome!  I used butter-flavored spray on one side of the tortilla, sugared it, cut with pizza cutter, turned the pieces over onto a foil covered cookie sheet,then sprayed & sugared the second side.  10 min at 350, no more than that or they were overcooked.  Perfect!  I had no trouble with browning fruit, i added lemon juice to my apple and banana pieces.  I also omitted the raspberry (didnt have any on hand).  Color was perfect, everyone raved - thank you!

Served it for a jewelry party, and got lots of compliments on it.  Everyone LOVED the chips (followed a previous suggestion and sprayed with butter, layered, and cut with a pizza cutter -= speeds the process up).  For fruit I used kiwis, mandarin oranges, blueberries, strawberries and raspberries.  It doesn't have a very long shelf life, as the next day it was fairly mushy.

I made this for a 4th of July party.  It went almost uneaten.  That is unfortunate because it actually tasted great.  The cinnamon chips went really well with the fruit.  I can't give it more stars because of the presentation.  The juice from the strawberries and raspberries colored the kiwi and the apples.  The kiwis then turned an unappetizing brown and the apples turned an unrecognizable pink.  The next day I did sit down with the bowl of fruit and the chips and finished them off.  Taste = great.  Presentation = not so much!

This is soooo good, I did Strawberries, mangos, apple, and kiwis, didn't have any preserves so I just used 1 spoonful of plum jam that I had in the fridge. Didn't use the pam cooking spray (didn't have any) but I did have spray butter so I used that and the chips turned out great.

Holy Big Hit!! I made this for a party and I felt bad (secretly giggling inside) as everyone devoured this dip and chips and overwhelmed we with compliments while the other dishes sat there uneaten.

I made this for company and a lot of the salsa was left over.  It tasted good, but was way too sweet when combined with the sugary chips.

What was a huge hit was the chips!  People raved over them.  I made another batch and have been eating them as a lighter dessert for about a week.  If they are allowed to fully cool, they stay nice and crisp stored in a Ziplock bag.

I made this last weekend for my daughter's first birthday party.  Everyone raved, and she even loved it!  I used guava jam, and only 1T brown sugar - no white sugar at all.

one of the best appetizers/desserts I've had. PERFECT for summer barbeques. I made this with blackberries, strawberries, peaches, apples and kiwis; but I can't think of too many fruits that wouldn't work. I would cut down/elimate the sugar in most cases...especially if your fruit is already fairly ripe.

I am asked to make this at every family get together now!  Thanks. Its our new favorite, healthy too.  Thats always a plus.  Ssometimes I smash up more strawberries instead of jam.  I noticed my salsa was pretty watery the next day with jam.  Strawberries mashed up keeps it chunky and thick!  Great recipe!

This is great!  You can pretty much add any fruits you want to as long as you can cut them up small sizes.  I didn't have time to make the cinnamon chips so I bought the keebler honey wheat crisps they worked out great! Many compliments on this recipe!

This recipe was great, but the salsa was a bit too sweet. I added some lemon juice to boost the acidity. Next time I'll cut back on the sugar or leave it out entirely.

This is the best dish I have made in a long time. My children loved it.  I made a huge batch, but we still had no leftovers.  I plan to make this again and again. It would be perfect to take to a summer get-together. It's delicous and pretty to look at.

I made this for a bbq this past weekend and I thought it was good but a tad too sweet for my taste.  I think that next time I'll omit the white sugar.  I also didin't make the chips I bought cinnamon pitas instead.  Others thought this dish was amazing, so I guess I'll be making it again.

Could it get any better?  I don't think so.  I used my chopper to make quick work of the strawberries and Fuji apple and diced 3 kiwi by hand.  Left out the raspberries, but used raspberry preserves and a T. of sugar.  Oh, and I added a squirt of lemon juice for the sake of the apple.  Even good the next day, albeit a bit juicy.  The chips, well, I can't imagine using 2 cups of cinnamon sugar.  I just made 1 cup (with a t. cinnamon) for 10 tortillas (which I sprayed with regular nonstick spray on both sides and then dredged both sides in the sugar) and that was plenty, even making the chips a bit too sweet.  Super easy and tasty, a great snack on their own.  Altogether, a definite keeper.  Thanks!

This was good, but very time consuming.  I guess I was expecting everyone at our cook out to eat it all up and ask for more based on previous reviews.  I had more than half of it left over.  It's definitely something different, but I don't think I will ever make it again only because I took waaaay to long.  I will make the chips again, though!

I made this last night for a small get together and it got rave reviews!  The only things I did differently are I used one gala and one granny smith apple instead of the golden.  I also used Orange marmalade for the preserves.  I also sprayed and coated both sides of the tortillas and they took almost 30 minutes to crisp up enough.  I think I used too much butter pam!

Excellent recipe!  I used granny smith apples instead of golden delicious, however.  TO make the cinnamon chips, I stacked my tortillas and cut the stack into six triangles each, placed them on a cookie sheet, sprayed them with PAM, and sprinkled the cinnamon sugar on them.  Next time I will probably coat both sides of the chips as they turned out rather bland.

I made this for a bunko party and everyone loved it!! I used apples, strawberries, cherries, kiwi, mango, and blackberries. I also used an egg slicer to dice the strawberries and kiwis. It was pretty messy, but not nearly as bad as doing it by hand would have been. I pitted the cherries and then quartered them, along with the blackberries. For the apples I used a peeler-corer-slicer and that made it much easier! I didn't add any preserves, but i did coat it with a little bit of the leftover cinnamon-sugar mixture. It was a huge hit, everyone asked for the recipe!!

YUM! I love fruit and this was so good!
 I omitted the brown sugar and it was still VERY sweet. Since the fruit preserves is sweet and fruit is naturally sweet, I don't think it's necessary to add much sugar. By the way, I used orange marmalade for the fruit preserves and it was SO good - (it wouldn't have been quite the same without that orange peel flavor.)
DELISH!!!

I bought some pita chips from the grocery store made by Basha.  They are plain and are also fried.  I tossed them with the cinnamon sugar mixture and can't keep my hands out of the bowl!  

The fruit salsa is FABULOUS!!!

I added the brown sugar but left out the white.  It didn't need any sugar at all, especially with the fruit preserves.  I did the dunking method, where i dipped the tortillas in a bowl of the cinnamon/sugar.  I personally thought it was too sweet and next time I'll just sprinkle on some of the mixture on the tops.  Also, the raspberries somewhat mushed together.  While they still tasted great, I might leave them out next time or sprinkle them on top.  Thanks!

It is delicious, I made it exactly as the recipe states the only thing I would change  for my own preference would be less sugar in the salsa, I think that there is enough sugar on the chips to add sweetness. Oh and I might add Mango as someone at the party had suggested.

Out of this world. I've made it 3 times in the last month. I don't even think it needs the jam in it - sweet enough without it.

This is a summer favorite in my house. Just about every time we have company I make it. I use no sugar added raspberry preserves and I only put 1/2 tbsp of the sugars in it. I also sub raspberries for black berries. It gives the "salsa" an interesting color and I like the flavor better. I am naughty when it comes to the cinnamon chips however and I use butter flavored crisco! Delicious!!!!

Very yummy and a fun twist to regular fruit salad.  The key is to cut the fruit very finely.  I used my pampered chef slicer to help get the apples super small and uniform.  Mango was yummy in it too.  I must say that it is really just a fine fruit salad so I'm not quite sure what all the fuss is about, but I'm sure I will make it again because it is something different, Thanks!

This is absolutely awesome! My sister is pregnant and has been craving fruit...she absolutely devoured this! I did change it a little of course. I added two bananas and didn't add the raspberries. I did reduce the sugars and preserves. This was awesome with the chips!

This is a 10 star recipe in my book.  I made it exactly as the recipe directed and it was wonderful.  I can't wait to impress my friends with this one!  I've made it twice since Wednesday.  I love this site, especially being able to read the reviews before deciding to make a certain recipe.  However, reading through all of the "changes" people make simply wear me out.  This recipe has earned this rating just as it is.  Thank You Annie!

Very good.  I used a bit less sugar and it was still sweet enough.  I didn't let the chips cool, served them warm and it tasted a lot like warm fruit pie.

I really like this recipe.  What I like most is the ability to change almost everything about it.  You can vary fruits according to taste and texture preferences.  I can make it smoother from when I eat it on pancakes/waffles and even icecream or heartier and cruchier for when I want something a little firmer with those sweetened tortillas.  I don't add sugar and I use apricot jam and add a little cinnamon for a little extra something special.

The chips were spectacular! Almost everyone loved them best. The salsa was tasty, but came in a close second to the chips. Over all a winner.

I made this yesterday. Instead of raspberries, I used blackberries. The actual fruit is really good though a bit too sweet. As for the cinnamon chips, "Stacey's" (brand name) makes some already premade so I tried those. They're a bit too hard so next time I'll try making my own.

I would highly suggest removing the chips from your cookie sheet as soon as they come out of the oven.  I let the first batch cool on the sheet, and they would not come off.

My *only* complaint about this recipe is that the salsa became very unattractive visually after an hour or so, even after adding lemon juice to slow the browning. On my second attempt, I replaced all of the sugar with an extra tablespoon of preserves and 2 tbsp. lemon juice, and that helped a bit without affecting the flavor. The combination of the cinnamon chips with the fruit is WONDERFUL. This is a definite keeper.

Took this to my in laws for lunch and everyone liked it.  I used the raspberries, blackberries and bluberries out of a frozen berry mix defrosted them in the fridge over night with some splenda,  I did use fresh strawberries.  I got in a hurry and forgot to peel the apples but it didn't seem to make any difference.  Did not use any brown sugar but sprinkled the fruit with some cinnamon sugar.  I used apricot/pineapple preserves.  Can't wait to use what is left on pancakes or in some vanilla yogurt.

Delicious!  It was a hit with the family at Easter Dinner, a nice change.  In the future I will dice the fruit using an egg slicer and hold off on the preserves and sugar until about 15 minutes before I am ready to serve. It does create a lot of juice if you add the sugar too far ahead. I sprayed the tortillas with butter flavored spray, sliced them and then tossed them in a ziploc bag with the cinnamon sugar mixture.  This saved a lot of time.  The kids liked helping with this recipe. A new favorite!

Raspberries make the salsa a bit bitter. I would omit them for future making. Recipe was easy, fast, and tastes good, not excellent.

Very Good!  I used kiwis, strawberries, peaches, and apples.  After reading some reviews about it being too sweet. I cut down on the sugar, just added a bit of the cinnamon sugar left over from the chips. And used all natural, no sugar added, preserves.  I also added some lemon juice for a bit of a tang and also helps with the browning.

People went nuts for this fruit salsa!  I used Fuji apples, mango, kiwi, and strawberries.  I only added in peach preserves, but no extra sugar.  It is plenty sweet on its own.  The cinnamon-sugar chips came out great (baked them for about 11 min to make sure they were crunchy and not chewy).  I plan on making it again next week for a baby shower.

Good recipe! Thanks for the good idea.  I didn't add any sugar and I couldn't use all the fruit suggested (it’s March). I used 2 peaches, 1 huge mango, 1 gala apple, 10 large strawberries, 2 kiwi, and orange marmalade and NO sugar and it was just right.  My boyfriend who doesn't like fruit that much said it was pretty good and not to sweet, but no sugar was needed.  I don't think you should make this in the winter as I did because you just can't get good fruit. The homemade chips are just great!

Yum.  Cutting all the fruit took some time, but it was well worth it.  The second time I made it, I got the egg slicer like a previous poster recommended.  Took 1/4th the time!  My 2 year old daughter LOVES the salsa and the chips.  A definite keeper.

This recipe is awesome!  I made it for a party and had to give the recipe to several people.  They were raving about it! I served it with store-bought cinnamon pita chips to save time.  This salsa would also be great over ice cream or pancakes.

This recipe was a hit.  I made it for superbowl and the guys (and gals)  loved it.  I was hoping to have some leftovers but they ate the whole thing.  Next time I would add extra kiwifruit and leave out the sugar in the salsa.

I never rate recipes, but had to rate this one!  It was fabulous and very quick/easy.  My guests ate all the chips, but there was leftover fruit salsa.  We used the leftovers on a fruit pizza and that was delicious too!  Thanks for such a great recipe.  

I also cut out the white sugar.  The brown sugar and preserves made it plenty sweet.

Can not keep my hands off of the cinammon chips.  YUMMYY!!!  I did brush on real melted butter instead of spray flavoring for the tortilla chips.  I just don't eat fake anything.  Prefer the real thing.  And on my pampered chef stone, it took the chips more like 13-15 minutes to bake.  As far as the salsa went, it too is very yummy and VERY sweet (I may cut the sugar next time).  I used a diced mango, lb of strawberries, small box of raspberries, 2 kiwis and 2 apples.  I also used raspberry preserves.  YUMMY!  My youngest wanted a dollup of it over his vanilla yogurt and he gobbled it all up.  This recipe is a keeper.

It was amazing!! i made it for my salsa contest at school and it won out of 50 other recipes! However, i did make a few changes. First of all, i cut out all of the  white sugar and used just the brown sugar.     It turned out PLENTY sweet.  Finally, i used raspberry jelly and it was AWESOME!  Thanks so much for the great recipie! the chips were amazing too!

This recipe was terrific! I did modify it a little, though. I omitted the sugars and added a banana. Also, I used seedless blackberry preserves. The chips turned out great, but the salsa ended up a little soupy. Next time I'll use fresh strawberries instead of frozen! Nevertheless, this is definitely a recipe that will be made around here for a long time.

I brought this to my 4 year old daughters Valentine's party at school. I have to admit that I used low sugar preserves, and cut way back on the sugar (half the white sugar, and no brown sugar) so maybe that's why most of the kids didn't like it. I used strawberries, blueberries and apples, and served with cinnamon graham cracker sticks.

This was just OK for me.  Tasted like fruit salad.  My two and three year olds didn't finish it and they LOVE fruit.  My two year old actually said yuck.

Love this recipe.  I do use cinnamon chips (or other fruit flavored chips)from the grocery.  I don't necessarily like the texture of these chips.  Before I found the "sweet" chips, I took regular tortilla chips and sprayed the cooking spray and added the cinnamon sugar.  They tasted sweet without the "chewy" chip texture.

Very tasty!
I think the preserves add enough sugar to it though, too much and it takes away from the taste/sweetness of the fruit.

YUMMY!!! I made this last night and it is all gone now. I took some advice of the others and didn't add any sugar. It was wonderfully sweet without it. I also added an orange and a banana because I had them on hand. Obviously, any fruit will work. I bought the new Sun Chip Cinnamon and they were wonderful with this. I'll make this over and over again.

Made this a while ago for a party.  It was very well received.  I added a mango and used blueberry preserves, as it was what I had in the fridge.  For the chips, I melted butter in a large saucepan, dipped both sides of the tortilla in the butter, cut into quarters, and tossed in the sugar/cinnamon mixture in a large zip baggie.  They're a bit messy, but the chips were my favorite part!

This was incredible.  I used frozen raspberries, frozen strawberries, some frozen blackberries, frozen peaches, fresh apples and kiwi  and I have to agree that I don't think the addes sugar/preserves are necessary.  Next time I'll cut that in half.  It was soooo good and refreshing!  I'll make this over and over.

this was DELICIOUS and a big hit at our last dinner party. tips: it required absolutely no added sugar,  i used frozen strawberries and raspberries, and cut them in halves while they were still frozen-- that way, there was no mess. i also used the juice of half an orange to give it some kick, and only two teaspoons of raspberry preserve. it was fantastic!

Such a great recipe. I made this with golden delicious apples( in some lemon juice to prevent browning). blueberries, raspberries, strawberries, kiwis and a couple of clementines. I chopped all my fruit ahead of time and kept them separate until about an hour before serving. Then I combined all the fruits together and added 2 tsp. of raspberry preserve. I did not add any additional sugar-it has enough sweetness. Served with cinnamon sugar chips. Rave reviews. Will make frequently.

I used frozen berries and fresh apples/kiwis, which detracted a little bit but it didn't seem matter because it was delicious. I cut down on the sugar but I wish I hadn't. The pita chips were yummy and I used Trader Joes torillas. The only thing was, my 3 year old, who lives on cinnamon sugar wouldn't eat these, probably b/c of the cooking spray (wasn't butter flavored). I wonder if you can toast them plain and then spread on melted butter plus cinnamon sugar?

What a great recipe! I changed it a tad though..I added diced mangoes, ripe juicy pears and black berries. Toss your apples in a tsp of lemon juice to stop them from browning. The tartness is wonderful!

I made this for two holiday parties this year and at both it received rave reviews.  Instead of sugar, I add 1 T of Splenda and 1/2 T brown sugar.  I also bought cinnamon sugar pita chips to save on time as other reviewers suggested.  Wonderful.  This recipe is one of my new favorites - so easy and delicious.

WOW!! This is incredible.  My mother said this is a salsa she likes.  This is what I did to make it work for me.  I took POOHV's suggestions: I used one bag of frozen peaches, and apricot spread I already had in the frig.  Next time I will add a couple more kiwis. Oh, and I added NO sugars at all.  It was sweet enough.

The trick to not "browning the apples," is to add about a tbs (15ml) of lemon juice. I learned this trick from my Great-Grandmother. Works everytime!

I made it for a party and everyone was impressed.  I made the fruit dip without any sugars using only the preserves and it was plenty sweet.  To make the chips quickly I covered a few tortillas with butter spray at a time and then cut through a few of them at once with a  pizza cutter.  Then I quickly put each one in the cinnamon/sugar.  I also suggest not to cover the chips with too much cinnamon/sugar and it will still be very sweet when you eat it with the fruit.  Next time I might try using some different fruits to change up the flavor.

THIS WAS AWESOME ! I was a little nervouse making it the night before but I went ahead and it was GREAT...I used everything like it said except I used my own strawberry freezer jam and cut up frozen strawberries instead of fresh...I just added the frozen berries in the morning...! Excellent ! The chips were GREAT and I made them that morning..was rushing around a little to get them in everyones lunch..but all turned out and they all LOVED THIS RECIPE ! Something refreshing and new for the lunchbox !

This recipe is absolutely awesome. The first time I made it I cut everything up by hand and it took forever. But the end result was worth it. Subsequant times that I've made it I put the fruit in a chopper and pulse it until I get the desired size. Everyone loves. I've had to copy the recipe about 20 times for friends and family.

OOO yum!  I made my chips by deep frying precut corn tortilla chips I ordered from my food broker and then tossed them with the cinn, sugar mix.  The slasa is full of vibrant colors and the flavors blend very nicely.

This was great. Made it fot the Family get-together on 4th of July and I am getting calls from the family saying they will pay me if I will make them some more. The recipe doesn't make a lot so be sure and double or triple if you are making for a large crowd. The chips are Awesome. Making them alone make a great dessert.

I cheated & used the pre-cut  fresh fruit mix at the store and then just added the sugars with a bit of lemon juice (no preserves). This really cut down on prep time which is always good for me. It went fast. I also suggest going heavy on the cinnamon/sugar.

Fabulous!  I did use Stacy's Cinnamon Sugar Pita Chips instead of making my own and cut the sugar/jam but people were starting to put it in serving bowls with the last bits of chip crumbs on top and eating it as dessert.  You could probably do that for real - it is that good!

I have made this several times and it has always been a hit. It is definitely easier to use a chop master or something to chop the fruit in bulk. It will really cut down on your prep time. I used strawberry preserves and it had a great taste. I personally really like putting peaches in, instead of the raspberries. Although it is good both ways! Enjoy!!

Yummy!  I also didn't all the sugar, just a little white sugar.  It wasn't too sweet, but just perfect with the sweet cinnamon chips.  I am allergic to kiwi, so I substituted frozen mango, papaya, and pineapple, also used strawberries and apples.  I got lots of raves for this recipe!

This was very good. The only mistake I made was using frozen raspberries since the fresh were out of season andvery expensive.   Best to make it when the berries are available rather than having fruit soup. BUt it still tasted great so I kknwo it will be great w/fresh berries. The chips are fantastic.

I used blackberries and blueberries instead of raspberries and kiwi and it came out great.  The chips are better slightly overcooked...they come out crispier.

absolutely awesome way to serve fruit!  Worth every second of slicing and dicing.  I made this last night and my family begged me to make more today!  I used fresh strawberries, kiwi, peaches, grapes, and Granny Smith apples with apricot preserves.  AND the chips or the salsa could stand alone very nicely.

These were very very good. When I cut the apples, I squeezed some lemon juice on them to keep them from turning brown. I added frozen peaches instead of raspberries and also used orange marmalade and no added sugar to the fruit, as another reviewer suggested. I also put my fruit in a small hand chopper to speed up the preparation. With the chips, instead of baking them, I put them under the broiler for a few minutes, then flipped them over and put them under the broiler again, then turned out perfectly crisp and browned. Great recipe!

Very good! We left out some of the sugar so it doesn't get so juicy. Once when we made it we left out the rasberries and added bananas, it came out ok but the bananas got mushy. This is a great snack. Thanks!

This was awesome!  We made it for my son's 4th birthday and it was the hit of the party.  We used cinnamon pita chips and it was so good no one could stop eating it!

This is a delicious recipe! I agree with it being a little bit to sweet so the next time I am going to leave out the white sugar. It tastes alot better the next day so if you make it for a gathering, make it a day early. The chips are awesome!! I eat them by them by themselves.

This was amazing!  I made it for my cousin's bridal shower and everyone loved it.  The only thing that I did differently was to use whole wheat tortillas.  Mmmmmmm.  I'll definitely continue making this!

What a great recipe! I made this for a party appetizer and everyone loved it! I added blueberries for some more color and cut back on the sugar. I used black-raspberry jam which added a fun flavor to the salsa. I would suggest using the butter spray on the chips, I didn't have any and used a thin spread of butter on them instead...the chips didn't crisp up very well.

I had read all of the reviews of this recipes and really looked forward to fixing it.  Had a party and was really disappointed with it.  Some really liked it so I sent leftovers home with them.  I also brushed the tortillas with real butter then sprinkled with cinnamon and sugar mix.  They were great!!  What a letdown!!

Followed recipe exactly (except used melted real butter instead of the kind from the can).  I used apricot preserves, which worked perfectly.  This is as yummy as everyone says it is. :)  Oh, make sure to dice the fruit (especially apples and strawberries) very fine so it's easy to dip.

This is an amazing recipe. I'm a loyal and dedicated sweets fan, and these just hit the spot. EVERYBODY loves them. I also agree that it's a great healthy dessert option if you leave the extra sugar out. Kudos to whoever discovered this!

Just finished making this recipe. Boy, was it delicious. It was just a little sweet for my liking. Next time I think I will leave out the sugar as a few others had suggested. I found the bag trick to work well for the cinnamon chips (shake the warm chips in a ziplock bag of cinnamon and sugar).

I used apricot preserves. So delicious! Be sure to bake the tortillas long enough so they are crisp enough to scoop up the fruit.

I've made this a few times this summer, and it's gone over very well. I made the chips the first time and they were great; the next time I got lazy and bought the cinnamon pita chips from Trader Joe's. It was great with both, and even good eaten just as a fruit salad. Be sure to make it a few hours ahead of time so it has time to set.

This was fabulous! I pretty much followed the recipe except I used peaches and fuji apples, blueberries instead of raspberries and didn't add sugar.  It was much easier to fix than what I first thought.  I'm bringing this to a potluck tomorrow... I'm so excited!

Made this for an afternoon at the pool and it was big hit!! Mixed up the fruit a little as I had blueberries in teh house not stawberries. Also used the wonder strawberry wraps to make the chips and this was a really big hit. Awesome recipe will make many more times.

This recipe is definitely for a person with a sweet tooth.  I thought the presereves made it too sweet.  But overall, this was a fun recipe to serve for guests.

YUM!!  Loved it even more this time than last.  I used Gala apples, which were delicious and I added them last to prevent browning.  For the preserves I used peach, which was great.  Next time I think I'll only do 1Tbs. of each sugar.  It was certainly sweet enough between the fruit, sugar, preserves and chips.  For the tortillas I used fresh tortillas from our local Mexican market (16-perfect amount) and they made absolutely delicious chips.  I did find that the baking time was a little longer than noted and they needed to be flipped half way through for the best crisping.  While they were much better than store bought, they did take a lot of time but are definitely worth the time if you have it!  I will say that an egg slicer would make the chopping of the fruit much much quicker!  By far my favorite fruit salsa recipe.

This fruit salsa won ooohs and aahs from guests.  Make sure to bake the tortillas enough or they will be chewy instead of crunchy.  The tortilla chips alone are an addictive healthy snack.

As if this needed anymore reviews.  I used blueberrys, blackberries, reaspberries. the apples, the kiwi, and strawberries and used strawberry jam.  I did not use sugar, and think it would have made it too sweet.  Anyway, had to pull up 8 copies, as that's how many people wanted the recipe.

I don't know who Annie is, but this was a great Fruit Salsa and the Cinnamon Chips compliment the sweet of the salsa. Very impressive combination!

Made it just as written, and it was perfect.  Will try other combinations based on what I have on hand, but this will definitely go in the recipe book as a keeper, especially for summer.

This salsa is a delicious and fresh appetizer/snack.  There are never leftovers.  For a twist, I substituted a mango for one apple, used ginger preserve and added some shredded coconut. This recipe allows for a lot of flexibility with ingredients.

Wonderful!  I don't use any sugar in this and use all-fruit jam.  I added some frozen blueberries and blackberries (while they were still frozen so they wouldn't get squished while stirring.) Also, I cut up the tortillas first then dampened them with my fingers and sprinkled/rubbed on the cinnamon sugar.  No need for any oil!

A very light and tasty addition to the hors d'ouevres table.  I left out the white sugar as previous reviewers suggested.  Very simple to make, which is a good thing since I've been requested to bring to parties again and again!!

Great recipe for parties. I personally add blackberries, and a few extra kiwis. Also, in the summer, when everything is in seaon, I leave out the jam/sugar and just let it sit in the fridge to juice up a little bit. Also, make extra chips, they go fast.

Super recipe. To tone down sweetness, I used one Granny Smith and one Golden Delicious apple. I also kept their color with the juice from half a lemon. Although the cinnamon chips are time consuming, they really do make the recipe!

I made this for our anual church picnic and I lost track of how many people came and told me how much they liked it and asking for the recipe.
I changed it up a little bit. I added 2 mangos, blackberries and a can of crushed pineapple. And I didn't put in the brown sugar, and only used half the white sugar. It was excelent!

I just made this tonight and WOW it is so tasty! I have it in the fridge for tomorrow though because it's my daughters 1st bday and I'm having a party. I didn't add the raspberries though from previous reviews and also because I just couldn't find any but I added raspberry preserves and it tastes great so far and that's without the apple added! I'm adding that tomorrow before I serve it. I also added nectarines.. :-) The cinnamon chips are the best though! I wasn't sure why everyone was raving about them and now I know why! They are fantastic! and super easy to make too! I might make just those in the future. I used a regular vegetable oil spray. I figured I just needed that so that the sugar and cinnamon would stick to the tortillas. I used a pizza cutter too and cut more than 1 tortilla at a time and used a muffin form to make a scoop and that is great! :-) Mmm!! thanks for the great recipe! I can't wait for my guests to try it!
update: my guests really liked it. I didn't get asked for the recipe or anything but they asked what was in it. no one really touched the cinamon chips though which was sad! they are good. I think everyone thought I bought them at the store. haha! I'm happy with this recipe though :) It went great along with the Tres Leches cake recipe I found on this site.

Instead of baking, I deep fried the chips then shook them in a bag of cinnamon sugar.  Not very healthy...but they tasted great!  No one believed I made them myself.  I also changed up the fruit:  strawberries, mango, kiwi, and peaches.  Fantastic!

This is so good. The cinnamon chips are so easy and fun to make. I just bake them until they feel a little stiff. The fruit is good enough to eat alone. My sister and I just grabbed a spoon and ate from the bowl. But it is really good when you use the chips! I will definately make again.

Pretty good. My raspberries got really really soggy though. I would probably leave them out next time.

add another great rating! made exactly, no changes for the salsa and it was a huge hit.  The chips I didn't have any butter spray so I used melted butter and didn't put anything on top after putting on the cinnamon/sugar and they were just as big a hit as the salsa!

On unexpected success! We were looking for a different snack for a summer party and this went over gangbusters! In a pinch, I've used cinnamon chips from a bag, and it is still good

This salsa was amazing! I used frozen raspberries and raspberry jam (all fruit). After "marinating" for a while, the rest of the fruit took on the raspberry flavor and the result was a taste of heaven. I made this when we had company, including lots of kids, and the kids preferred the fruit to the brownies I'd made just in case. So, so yummy. Thanks for sharing.

EXCELLENT!  I used frozen peaches in place of the raspberries, and halved the sugars for the salsa.  I also only sprayed the tortillas once before I dipped them in the sugar and cinnamon mixture.  I don't think it needed another spray. Then I sliced them up with the pizza cutter...much faster and easier!    This recipe turned out AMAZING and everyone at the party LOVED it!  Thanks!

Just made it for a cook out today. This was so yummy! I tweaked it a bit and added some fresh pineapple and used a red delicious apple. I also mixed the splenda sweetened orange marmalade and raspberry preserves, a tiny bit of key lime juice and it didn't even need the sugar. I also used the cinnamon sugar pita chips since I was pressed for time. The party is over and my toddler and I are just eating the rest of the salsa with big 'ol spoons!

I'm not sure what all the hype is about tis recipe, but I found it to be okay.  I did make the recipe ahead of time by about 4 hours and it seemed to be a little on the mushy side, so I don't recommend making it too far in advance.  It was good, but from the rating and reviews I thought it would be outstanding, which in my opinion it was not.  I served it with a fajitas thinking it might compliment the Mexican dish since I found the recipe in that category.

This was excellent!  I made it for a bridal shower.  I doubled the fruit, but not the sugar, and it was still sweet and delicious.  I also chopped up some frozen peaches in place of the raspeberries, and I used raspberry preserves.  The chips were a bit time consuming and messy, but good nonetheless.  Next time I will try and buy them.  I will make this again next month for another bridal shower at my office!

This recipe was a big hit. Everyone loved it and wanted the recipe. The only change that I made was I added blueberries to the salsa and I won't do that again because the blueberries tended to roll off the the tortilla wedges. Next time I will try a chopped up fresh peach instead. I also used the apricot preserves and it had wonderful flavor. If you're not serving it where small children are going to be eating it, I would even add a tablespoons of peach schnapps. YUM!

I made this fruit salsa to go with cinnamon chips for a Mexican dinner party. I got huge raves for the fruit salsa.  I made it as the recipe stated however I didn't have fruit jam so I substituted frozen peach/mango juice concentrate for the jam. I will definately make this again. The only problem I had was I wanted to buy the cinnimon chips at the store but the store didn't carry this item.  I made my own and they were "ok".

A bit hit. I used 1 C strawberries, 3 kiwis, 2 naval oranges, and a small can of crushed pineapple with some lemon juice and a bit of white sugar all mixed together. The chips were a breeze to make and were so tasty. Everyone loved it. Light, easy and refreshing.

I have to say, I didn't think the "salsa" was that great but I LOVED the chips. It seemed like a lot of chopping for a mini fruit salad. I used blueberry preserves. But the chips were great. They took me like 5 seconds to put together and came out perfect.

I have made this recipe on several occasions and it is always a big hit and several friends have swiped the recipe and made it themselves.  I like to use whole wheat tortillas and even use Splenda to make it healthier. I have tried using blueberries and blueberry preserves, which are still great but I prefer the raspberry preserves.  Thanks for the great recipe!

This salsa was wonderful.  Made it for a girl's only party and everyone loved it.  I used frozen raspberries, thawed and drained.  It did get quite runny after sitting for a while in the fridge.  It would be good over pound cake or ice cream too!

This was a refreshing treat.  Next time I will use cinnamon chips you can buy at the store to avoid the hassle of making them.  It was kind of hard to make sure they didn't get too done, hence hard.  (3 kids distracting me) I will also experiment with the fruit. I figured out we just don't like rasberries very much, so will leave those out next time.

Yummy!  The fruit salsa was a great hit.  It is a bit sweet, especially with the pita.  Next time, I"d add less sugar.  I used 1 cup of sugar & 1 tbsp of cinnamon for the tortilla, and placed it in a zip lock bag.  Next time, I'll make smaller wedges.

This recipe was a HUGE hit at a card party this past weekend.  My folks loved it and were pleasantly surprised by a 'different' appetizer.  I used blackberries instead of raspberries because I couldn't find them in the grocery store.  To make up for them, I used raspberry preservers.  YUMMY!

I bought a few bags of fruit chips as I didn't want to take the time to make my own.

Great Flavor. I used kiwi, strawberries, and apples with strawberry preserves. I chips I did not have time to make, so I just purchased some Cinnamon pita chips that I were not highly impressed with. Next time I will def. try it with the chips! Thank You!

This recipe is fantastic! Everyone is always impressed by it. The quantity of ingredients makes quite a bit of salsa, but it also tastes wonderful leftover.

I substituted regular splenda and brown sugar spenda and cut the recipe in half. It still made a ton! I also took others suggestion for using a chopper (great idea-saved so much time) and buying already made sweet pita chips. Another great time saver. This came out really good. I mixed some of the leftovers with hot oatmeal, and I'll probably also make a smoothie. I would make this again. Thanks!

Thank you, thank you, thank you. I made an appetizer off of here for the super bowl yesterday - and it was TERRIBLE. I found this, and it was great, perfect. I am eating it right now too with a little vanilla yogurt on top of the cinnamon chips and with the salsa on top. MMMMM!

This recipe was very good. I changed it a bit and added blueberries and pineapples omitting the raspberries. I think the next time I make this I am going to use a lot less sugar both on the chips and in the fruit.

BIG hit at a ladies' luncheon!! I didn't use the fruit preserves. I used frozen berries and allowed them to thaw in with the other fruits. As they melted it created a nice liquid-y mixture and I was able to mix the sugar into that.

This recipe won 1st place in our families traditional christmas eve cook off. The tortilla chips were worth the extra effort. After spraying the tortillas with the butter spray and cutting them I put them all in a big bowl with the cinnamon and sugar and put a lid on it and shook it. The wedges were coated and it was very easy. We were all surprised by the taste of the salsa. even better then the recipe sounded.

I have never received so many request for a recipe as to when I serve this fruit salsa. I received a similar recipe years ago at an apple farm, and I have added and changed here and there for several years. I make this all year long with the seasonal fruit on hand. In the winter, I use raspberry preserves and more apples and fresh cranberries diced, with chopped clementines. In the summer, I switch to apricot preserves with apples, kiwi, strawberries, blueberries, papaya, and mango. Then I switch it back up with peach preserves and an all berry mix (black, blue, straw, and rasp.). In that case, I use powdered sugar instead of brown.

I am only giving this 4 stars because it took forever to cut up all of the fruit, and it really did not get touched at the Xmas party. I did have a few people come up to me to tell me it was really good, but, like I said, I had more than half left... I think am going to use the remaining fruit to put on top of a cheesecake for the next party tomorrow night so we'll see how that goes! The chips were delish.... Maybe I'll try again for a baby shower or something. Thanks!

This is a staple at our Christmas Eve get together, and it only gets better the longer it sits, so left overs for Christmas morning are a huge hit!  I've made it with many different kinds of preserves - whatever I have in the house at the time.  The chips can be a bit of a pain - but are definitely worth it!

Excellent.  I add other fruits for more color, black berries were very pretty addition, could also try blueberries.  Doesn't look as appealing as it really tastes - it is wonderful.  In fact i actually just love the cinnimon chips as a snack WIHTOUT the fruit.

I've made this several times, and it's turned out perfect every time.  It's easy and delicious and it freezes great!  I also use frozen rasberries instead of fresh because they're always in the store.

My family loves this recipe. My daughter has taken it as her own special dish. She cuts up the pieces of fruit much smaller as many have suggested. Next time we'll cut up the tortillas after spraying with butter and cinammon. I like that idea.

This recipe is so versitile you can add just about any fruit to it.  I've put it over ice cream, blended it in Margaritas, paired it with Champagne and of course with the wonderful cinnamon chips.  Great for a party!!

I have made this several times and everyone loves it!  I use a food processer for the fruit which makes it quick and easy - just put the firmest fruit (apples) on the bottom and pulse a few times.  This does tend to puree some of the fruit but it solves the problem of having it get runny and having to be drained. I use kitchen shears to cut the tortillas into wedges and bake on a regular cookie sheet. (I tried an insulated cookie sheet and did not have good luck with it)  I use this recipe freguently and always get many requests for the recipe.

My Dad is VERY picky.  He can't stand the thought of a casserole because he doesn't like his foods mixed together and GOD forbid he goes out to eat because it's never up to his high standards.  Well, he LOVED this!  I couldn't BELIEVE how much he raved about how much he liked it.  I thank you, and my Dad thanks you, for sharing this recipe with us.  :)

The great thing about this recipe is that you can use whatever fruit is in season or looks best in the produce section. I have made this with peaches, blackberries, apples, pears, raspberries, bananas, etc. It's so simple and can be different each time you make it!

This recipe is fabulous! The only change I make is that I add a bigger variety of fruits, just about anything that I can find. Seedless Blackberry Preserves is the best with this!

This was a great summer treat.  I didn't end up having butter flavored cooking spray so I just melted butter and used that instead.  Not so healthy but it was tasty!

I love this recipe!!  I've probably made it half a dozen times.  The first couple of times, I followed the recipe exactly, but have also "played" with it as need be.  Once, I was in a real hurry and just did not have time it takes to do all of the cutting.  I just used drained frozen sweetened strawberries and canned crushed pineapple (sweetened), then briefly pulsed some bagged apple slices with some maraschino cherries.  Added a little raspberry preserves and voila... quick fruit salsa.

I lay out long layers of foil upon which to spray and cut my tortillas, then shake them in the cinnasugar mix in a big baggie.

This method is a quick fix, but the original recipe still rocks and is my favorite way to do the recipe when I have the time.

I forgot to pick up raspberries at the store for this recipe, so I made the dip without them.  It still turned out good but I will for sure add the raspberries next time.  The cinnamon chips took some time but were well worth it.  Thanks for the recipe.

I made this for Easter, and it was an instant hit!  I had a ton of leftover fruit, so I made a second batch to bring to work-everyone asked for the recipe!  The second batch, I threw in blackberries and a granny smith for a slightly different flavor, and it was just as good!  Everyone should make this!

Great recipe!  Although it did take some time to chop all the fruit it was a pleasant experience because my 6 year old son wanted to help, he wasn't fond of the "Ki-Weed".  Next time I will use fresh raspberries (store only had frozen) and probably omit the fruit preserves.  I also sprinkled both sides of the tortilla with cinnamon/sugar but felt that using 2 cups would have been too much, probably more like

The fruit salsa was just okay.  I did not feel it was worth the expense of the ingredients.  As stated in earlier reviews, the recipe made too much salsa.  I had to come up with creative ways to incorporate it into smoothies and muffins and I still had leftovers.  I will not make this again.  I did not make the cinnamon chips from this recipe.  They sound lovely and perhaps one day I will try them.

In one word: awesome.  I made this for a party and it went over very well.  I made the salsa the day before, and while it got a little runny- I still loved it.  I made my chips a little differently as well. Instead of spraying them (I didn't have spray on hand) I used a pastry brush and some melted margarine.  It worked great!!  It was a fanastic recipe that had several people asking "how did you make that?!"

I made this and brought it to work. Talk about a big hit!  I omitted the sugar and used orange marmalade as the fruit preserves.  Everybody loves the salsa and the cinnamon and sugar tortillas, I'll be making these again.

I made this over the summer for a huge picnic. Doubled the recipe and made it with apples, kiwis, strawberries, and sweet cherries. It was gone before I finished saying hello to everyone. They all loved it, raved about it, and have requested it on several occasions since. Thank you!!

This was very good.  Leftovers work well in the blender with vanilla ice cream.

My kids love the cinnamon chips, but they are a little time consuming to make.  Salsa is fabulous, but can get runny.  I learned not to make this too far in advance of serving time.

Made the fruit salsa & it tastes awesome, although the apricot preserves was hard to mix in (kinda stuck together)  I bought Stacy's Cinnamon Sugar Pita Chips to serve w/ salsa.  Yummm...  Thank you.

I have made this 3 times and everytime I make it I have to bring copies of the recipe because everyone loves it sooo much!  I like how there is only fruit in the salsa, nothing weird like onions or hot peppers.  I use apricot preserves and also throw in some pineapple to make it extra yummy!  I also find you only need one cup of cinnamon sugar for the chips.

What a wonderful, different and refreshing recipe!  I made this for my in-laws 4th of july party and to my shock, the people who normally detest fruit loved it!  For the salsa, I had to omit strawberries due to allergies.  I instead added drained crushed pineapple and peaches. The mixture will become watery as some reviewers noted because that is what sugar does to fruit.    I cooked my chips about 5 minutes longer to make them cripier.  

I am going to try something different next time.  I'm going to use ramakins, spray a whole tortillia, cover it with sugar and cinnamon and bake it upside down on the ramikin. Hopefully, if it turns out, I'll add a scoop of vanilla ice cream and top it with the salsa!

I really liked the cinnamon chips and thought they were a really goo idea for picnic's and such.  The fruit salad was also really good.  I wasn't too particular on the two together though.  But everyone else seemed to like it.

All I can say is YUM!  Great for the home made cinnamon tortilla chips, the mixture of fruits and sugars make a great topping for the chips not to mention great on Ice cream, and drained and put on cheesecake. 
I used frozen raspberries, making it a bit too liquid, but draining the mixture made it perfect! LOVE IT!! Rave reviews from friends added to my pleasure in making this twice in one weekend!

This one's a winner! I added pineapple and watermelon to the mix and it was great. Didn't even need the sugar--it was sweet enough on its own. Will make this for our 4th of July picnic!

Big hit, Everyone is making it now. We realized that the fruit has enough natural sugar in it that if you need to watch your sugar in take you can eliminate both the sugar and brown sugar and it's just as good!

I didn't use Pam on the tortilla chips, but used melted butter instead, since that is what I had on hand.  I used the kiwi's as directed, used one red apple, and one green apple, I chopped up the raspberries instead of leaving them whole, added a mango as others suggested, cut the sugar in half and used apricot fruit preserves.  This definatly took longer to prepare than stated, with all the chopping and such. Granted, my tortilla chips took longer because I used butter instead of Pam.  But I didn't have any, so I improvised.  My husband loved this recipe and has already asked when I will be making this again.  PS - This is an extremly versitile recipie and any amount and combination of fruit could be used.

I thought the chips were delicious but the salsa was missing something. I think next time I'll try using canned strawberries because they're extra sugary.

An excellent recipe that I will be making again.  A bit on the tart side, but the perfect match for the cinnamon chips.  Oh-the chips-I wasn't sure about them at first but they were incredible simple to make and the taste was fabulous.

This fruit salsa got rave reviews at my ladies' lunch.  I omitted the raspberries and added plums, nectarines and mango.  The cinnamon chips were pretty good (DH loved them and ate them plain), but they didn't go over nearly as well as the salsa, which people were eating plain, on cake, in salad, etc.  This fruit salsa recipe is a 5-star keeper!

I would cook the chips a little longer to make them more crispy.
I also would either increase the fruit or decrease the sugar/preserves next time.
Finally, it is better to cut the strawberries instead of leaving them whole.

Great appetizer or dessert recipe for a Mexican themed game-night with friends. I substituted 2 chopped bananas for the raspberries which made it less expensive but just as a delicious. For a decorative effect, I served the salsa in a giant martini/margarita glass and it looked amazing!

I would like to review the cinnamon chips-which were just awesome.  I cannot get spray butter in Japan, so I used real butter.  I toasted mine for 14 minutes, and they were just the right combination of crunch and sweetness.  I made the salsa according to a recipe my friend gave me, which called for equal parts of brown sugar, preserves, and orange juice.  It is delicious!

Very easy to make and delicious. I tossed up the fruit salsa a little bit with watermelon and used a different kind of apple. My guests loved it and ate every last bit of it.

My sister gave me a similar recipe featured on her local tv station. Here are a few tips:
1) use Splenda instead of the white sugar
2) we like the combination of 1 Granny Smith (tart,crunchy) and 1 Braeburn or Fuji apple (softer, sweet)
3) her recipe called for cinnamon sugar pita chips, I can't locate these so I use nabisco Harvest Crisps and simply add cinnamon to the salsa.

Yummy!

Like others, I added mango for great taste and color.  On half of the cinnamon chips, I dipped the tip of the triangle in melted chocolate and topped with a macadamia nut half.

This was served last summer at a graduation party I attended and everyone Loved it!  I asked for the recipe several times, but never received it and found it here!  I made it last week for a girls get-together and brought it out as a dessert item.  It got lots of oohs and aahs and everyone again raved over it.  I only made one addition--a splash of 7Up soda for a lemon-lime zing.  I also used MacIntosh apples instead of Golden Delicious because the GD haven't been any good lately... great find!

This is a unique and delicious appetizer. I served it at my Super Bowl party and people loved it and asked for the recipe. It's also much healthier than most appetizers. I look forward to making this one again!

AWSOME!!!
I made this with my students, they loved it as did I.  Fresh raspberries are really expensive right now, so I used frozen and used fresh and frozen strawberries. I cut down on the sugar and just used brown sugar.  We also put the cinnamon sugar on the tortillas and then cut them into wedges.  My son made almost the same recipe today in his highschool cooking class today too!  Instead of raspberries they used oranges.  Thanks Annie!

I made this last night for my birthday supper and just loved it!  It was a refreshing appetizer.  My sister and brother-in-law seemed to really enjoy it as well.  My boyfriend thought it was "too sweet" but he's not big on sweets before dinner and with all that sugar and fruit, it is bound to be sweet.  Loved it!  Thanks!

AWESOME! Frozen raspberries worked fine since I could not find fresh ones.  Also, when making the cinnamon chips, spray with butter flavored Pam and sprinkle with cinnamon sugar BEFORE you slice them into wedges.  MUCH EASIER

Fabulous recipe!  I used mango instead of raspberries, blackberry conserve and didn't use the sugar in the fruit. A very healthy dish and so yummy. Such a nice change from the usual greasy starters. The cinnamon chips are wonderful. Thanks for a great dish!!!

We enjoyed this very much, but I thought it was too sweet and I even used sugar free jam.  I'd recommend cutting the white and brown sugar by atleast half.

I took this to a pitch-in tonight and it received rave reviews. I had several requests for the recipe. I added blueberries to mine and used cherry preserves. It did take longer than 15 minutes to cut everything up, but it was definitely worth it! I served it with the chips and a cream cheese dip. I made the dip with cream cheese, brown sugar and vanilla. Everyone just loved it. It was nice to have something different to serve.

This is a five star recipe in taste, but it is very time consuming.  A food chopper helps, but that still leaves you with the chips to make. I've made this for parties a few times and everyone absolutely loves it!  Hint bring copies of this recipes to give out.... I guarantee people will request it again and maybe someone will volunteer to make so you can enjoy without the hard work=)

I made 3 mixtures of different types of fruits with the jam and sugar, and put them in a three part dish. A real party pleaser and people loved having a choice of which fruit to dip into.

This recipe is incredible! I have made it multiple times and always make enough to send some home with other people at get-togethers. The only downside is the amount of time it takes to make as I found that it took much longer than the fifteen minutes for prep time that it says on the recipe. However, the effort is definitely worth the final result.

This is the perfect dish to bring to a summer potluck.  It always gets eaten, and depending on the attendees, devoured.  I used 3 kiwis, 1 Gala and 1 Fugi apple, strawberries and blackberries. I also used fat free tortillas.  
This recipe is also very Weight Watchers friendly. One serving of salsa came about to be about 1.5-2pts.  The tortilla chips were about 3-4pts for 8.  Definately a winner!

I love this recipe.  I have used it so many times at gatherings with friends and family.  Everyone loves it, especially women and kids. It's refreshing and different for a summer event.  I've used all kinds of different fruit.  I really like it with peaches, blueberries, strawberrries and apples.  I don't put any sugar on the fruit, I just use a little raspberry jam to make it soupy.  I also use a pizza cutter to cut the tortillas into chips, it works great.  Thanks Ann for a wonderful recipe.

This is such a unique and tasty recipe.  I made it for my family at a party and they all loved it.  I used blueberries instead of raspberries since the store was out of them.  It still tasted just a great.  I did dice the strawberries to make it easier to dip the chips in.  The chips were delicious just by themselves!

I love this recipe and have made it many times.  My husband loves it over ice cream.  I have found that if I use the Pampered Chef chopper, the preparation time is minimal!

Awesome!!!!
I did not use kiwis, just strawberries, apples and raspberries. I also used grape jelly instead of preserves and it came out amazing.

Cinnamon chips were good. I made the salsa with strawberries, peaches, and pineapple (all fresh)and it was very good also.  It was a hit at the picnic.  I made it the night before and the chips stayed crisp, I didn't cover them.

This was very good, however, a little too time consuming for me. Next time I'll probably cut circles and place in muffin tin to create individual bowls and serve the salsa in them with a few chips on the side. My 1 year old even liked to dip the chips in the salsa. Will make again.

I love this recipe and am kicking myself for waiting so long to make it. I used Elderberyy jam in this recipe and it was so tasty. If you are planning on serving this at a party or BBQ, make a double batch because it will not last!

Love it!  Try this over french toast, pancakes, waffles, in crepes, yogurt, ice cream, or just eat it plain.  I did just a spoonful of sugar and no jam after everyone said it was too sweet.  I also did more kiwis and only one apple.  And I didn't bother to peel anything.  Make sure you scrub off the kiwi fuzzies, though.

I followed this recipe exactly and did not like the way it turned out. The chips were eaten but my guests didn't seem to like the dip. It was a lot of work and very disappointing.

Healthy treat that worked PERFECTLY for a party.  Gave the girls and I something to snack on that didn't kill the waistline. Add lemon juice to prevent the apples from turning brown as quickly.

I couldn't find the "fresh" fruit at a reasonable price so I used a frozen bag of mixed berries from Walmart mixed with what fresh strawberries I had in the fridge and this was EXCELLENT! My 4 year old and all of his little friends loved it! I will make this time and time again!

Looking for something both HEALTHY and SWEET?  This is a perfect appetizer or something just to munch on in place of traditional chips and salsa.  It is very satisfying and absolutely refreshing.  I love this recipe!!

This is a great party appetizer.  I made it for a new years eve party, and there was none left at the end of the night.  I used 3 kiwis instead of 2, used half the amount of sugar, and a small amount of fruit preserves.  It was plenty sweet.  I also used a pizza cutter, and I dipped my tortilla's in the cinn/sugar that I had spread out on a plate.  Took a little while, but it was well worth it in the end.  Thanks for a great recipe!!!!

I made this for my family on Thanksgiving (to munch on before dinner was ready) and it was greatly appreciated! The cinnamon chips were delicious all by themselves.  And we discovered that vanilla ice cream with the fruit salsa on top, is TO DIE FOR!!!  Thanks, for the great recipe!!

Every time I've brought this to an event or get-together, it's gotten rave reviews and everyone wants the recipe. It's simple and easy to make, but does require some time to cut up the fruit and bake the chips. For the chips, instead of cooking spray I used real melted butter and just brushed it onto the tortillas, then followed with the cinnamon sugar over that. The chips baked up just fine - very tasty and crispy. This is a recipe I'll be using many more times!

This is really tasty but very time consuming.  I would suggest making up the tortilla chips ahead of time if you can.  Also, they take up a lot of room on the cookie sheet.  We used two sheets, two different times, and only were able to make 8 - 10" tortilla.  The cinnamon sugar recipe is way more than you need.  You could also use the fried cinnamon strips recipe if you choose.

I used blueberries instead of rasberries because that's what I had, but this recipe was great.  I made it for a dinner I had for a few friends and they LOVED it.  I couldn't keep the chips coming fast enough.  It does make quite a bit so it wouldn't hurt to cut it down a bit unless you're making it for a party, but I would highly recommend this as a healthy, yet delicious dessert.

This has to be a hit, Grandma wanted the recipe!  Thank you.  In the future I'm going to make the chips into small "bowls" and serve the fruit salsa over custard.  My mouth is watering thinking about it!

Salsa was very sweet...in fact almost too sweet paired up with the cinnamon chips.  Enjoyed it more after spooning salsa over vanilla bean ice cream and then garnishing with a cinnamon chip.  The appearence after the first day was unappealing.  Make just enough to serve fresh.

Everyone at my 4th of July party LOVED this salsa!  I used Apricot preserves, and had to substitute blueberries for the raspberries because I couldn't get fresh raspberries.  The chips were good, too!  I made 16 10 inch tortillas, and I had a lot left over.  I think people were really loading up the salsa on each chip!  I will definitely make this one again.  Thanks Annie!

My friend Brandy recommended fruit salsa from this website and I'm glad she did.  For a refreshing and delicious desert, this recipe is terrific.  My mother did much the same thing for strawberry shortcake topping.  We topped our French vanilla ice cream with the fruit salsa.  It was excellent.  This chips are also decent and go well with the salsa, but are probably not five star.  Still, on the strength of the fruit salsa alone, overall, this recipe deserves five stars.  It's simple, but does take some time to cut the fruit up if you don't have a food processor.  Try it.  You'll *like* it.

I have to join with my fellow reviewers - THIS WAS AN EXCELLENT RECIPE! I took this with us on a boat ride for our dessert and everybody loved it. A definite "keeper".

My kids liked this very much.  I found the first batch of chips to be too heavy and far to sweet.  So the second batch I made I simply rubbed butter on each tortilla with my finger and sprinkled the sugar on.  I didn't care for the first bite too much, then I couldn't stop eating them.  Something I would recommend everyone try.  Very different!

This recipe was awesome!!!  I've made it a few times.  I prefer to use blackberry preserves over anything.  It makes such a nice refreshing dessert to take to potlucks.

I was in a pinch and needed something special to serve at a baby shower that fell into my garden theme. This salsa rounded out my menu plan perfectly. From the tartness of the apples to the sweetness of the chips, this concoction should not be missed.

The salsa was so good that it could be eaten with a spoon or poured over ice cream!  The cinnamon tortilla chips were a perfect addition.  I followed a reviewer's advice and dredged the tortillas through the cinnamon sugar to get maximum coverage!  I also used an organic apricot preserve in the salsa.  Will definitely make again as the summer months approach!

I had this recipe at a friends party - it was awesome.  I have made it several times and have gotten rave reviews.  The only thing I did different is I used Honey Wheat Thin crackers with it - basically because I was looking for something quicker to dip with.

A little labor intensive, but the product is definitely worth it!  It's more of a dessert than an appetizer, though.

Awesome recipe!  So simple yet SO good.  I made this as dessert for Thanksgiving diver.  Everyone raved about it.  It was great to have something lighter to eat after a big dinner.  The tortilla chips were a huge hit.  I put sugar on both sides as suggested by another user.

This is a very versatile recipe that is equally popular with adults and children.  I have served it as a snack and as a dessert.  It is a healthier alternative to chips and dip by the pool. I always taste the fruit mixture before I decide how much sugar to add. Excellent!

This recipe as you will read, was wonderful! Cutting the fruits was not the funnest part, but eating it really made up for that. I didn't feel the cinnamon chips were crispy enough. I am not sure if I should have left them in longer or maybe I'll try to fry them next time. Definitly will make again!!

Make sure you have a food processor!  Making enough for 40 people and hand chopping the fruits is more than a bit difficult.  But this treat is a hit!  And it's unique

I made this for a military function - threw in blueberries for the red, white, and blue touch - and everyone loved it!  Didn't use any sugar in the salsa, just a little apple jelly and a LITTLE fresh orange juice.  It was great, thanks!

I love this recipie! It gets really good if you let it sit overnight in the fridge as opposed to 15 min. Then all the juices blend together and become stronger. I ran out of chips, so make extra. I used cherry preserves. I made it for my Dad and step-mom and they loved it. My Dad says it's good on pork chops, but I didn't try it that way.

This did take some chopping time, but was absolutely WONDERFUL!  It is worth the time it takes.  I took it to a birthday party and everyone loved it!  They were even putting it on their ice cream and cake!  I had to give the recipe to everyone there.  I have two young cousins who normally don't eat anything with fruit or veges and they even loved it....great recipe.  This will be a common treat in our house from now on.  Thanks for sharing it!

This was an amazing recipe!  I have never received so many compliments before!  I did replace the apples with 3 peaches (to avoid the "browning" issue).  There is a lot of chopping, so this took me about 2 hours from start to a clean kitchen...but it was worth it!

I brought this to a church salad supper and people ranted and raved about this dish.  My 6 year old son
even asked for the leftovers as an after school snack.  I will definately make this again!

The fruit salad is great by itself. The cinnamon chips are also great alone. I recommend both.

A huge hit!  I've made it twice in 2 weeks for parties - everyone LOVED it.  I must have given out the recipe to over a dozen people.

This was a great recipe.  Everyone that tried it, thought it was great.  I have already made it like 3 times.  Definately one to try. It's a great summer dessert.

Everyone loved this for mothers day brunch.  I didn't add any sugar and served with the homemade chips and raspberry toast crackers from the store.  It was a big hit!

This is really good.  I have made this several times. I volunteered to cook dinner for our local Ronald McDonald house.  This was dessert.  People were actually stuffing tupperware containers with the fruit, to have later.  I made about 1 gallon for  36 people.  There was NONE left.  Winner!!

Spectacular. I brushed each tortilla with melted butter, cut them into sixteenths, and shook them in a lidded container with a cinnamon sugar mix. I followed the fruit salsa as written and added a cup of smallish blueberries. Turned out beyond my expectations. Great recipe!

Its looks so good in the picture but I am disappointed. I already couldn't understand what the sugar was for because its all fresh fruit that already has sugar. So I used less sugar in mine. Even with less sugar it's way too sweet. I wish I had used none at all. I didn't even want to make the chips because  it would be more sugar.

My raspberries went bad before I made this and I couldn't find golden delicious so I substituted gala apples and blackberries and blueberries. I also added a little cinnamon into the fruit. My family loved it. I will definitely make it again.

Incorporated a lot of the suggestions here.  One my own would be to combat the browning of apples, simply squeeze some lemon juice or if no children will be eating, you can also use a little splash of gin or vodka.

Chips were awesome.  This is the 2nd time I've made this and this time I had a Mexican theme going so I added pepper jelly for my preserve.  Just a little bit of kick which was nice with the very sweet salsa.  I will skip the added sugar next time, it doesn't need the extra liquid or sweetness.

I made it as an appetizer/snack for birthday celebration. Everyone loved it! Skipped kiwi, added blueberries and grapes instead. I didn't put any sugar, just strawberry jam and it had just enough juice in it, but not too much. The combination between the fruit salsa and the flour tortilla chip is so perfect!Will definitely make it again! Thank you for the recipe.

Very nice light appetizer with colors for the holidays.  The first time I made it, I broke my rule and didn't follow the recipe exactly, but incorporated other reviewers comments and suggestions, much to my disappointment.  The second time I made it, I followed the recipe exactly and was extremely pleased.  I will use the recipe as written in the future, the only change being a reduction in the white and brown sugars to taste.  What I like most about the recipe is the ability to vary/add to the suggested fruits.

This was a hit at our family gathering.  The only changes I made was to substitute green grapes for the Kiwi because of allergies.  I also let off the sugar and was glad I did.  The fruit with the preserves was plenty sweet and went great with the cinnamon sugared tortilla chips!

So good! I used blueberry preserve and everything else was the same. When making the chips, I found it easier to cut them after I coated them. Everyone always loves this!

I haven't met a person who hasn't liked this! I am lazy and skip making the cinnamon chips and buy Otterbein's Lemon Sugar cookies. Perfect for everything else too - pound cake, ice cream, crepes, you get the idea!

So Delish! Made no changes to the salsa, everyone loved it as is! (Only difference was that we had corn tortillas on hand, so made chips from those. It was a just an "on-hand" alteration, not due to any particular preferences, but they turned out delightful!)

This was delicious!  I made it for my Book Club and got rave reviews.  The chips were also very good, although I had to bake them much longer than the recipe suggested to get them crispy.  It also helped to turn them over, spray with butter cooking spray and bake for a few extra minutes.

I needed something ‘healthy’  to take to a friends house for dessert and came across this recipe. I used organic apricot preserves on 2 kinds of apples, kiwi, strawberries, and blueberries and just sprinkled the mix with brown sugar and it was plenty sweet. A delicious and healthy alternative!

I did a big handful of frozen peaches (but wait till they are thawed to put in because of all the moisture) -3 kiwi-2 big fugi apples and 1 lb of strawberries- apricot preserves and I cut back on both sugars-- Everyone loved it! The chips were easy to make-- I'll do this again

Used frozen whole unsweetened blueberries since we needed fresh for another recipe (& this  said it was going to be chilled anyway...) also, used sugar free blackberry preserves & only one T natural palm sugar (since fruitis sweet enough!) soooo flipping good!!! We will make this again as it’s good on chips & would be great with ice cream, yogurt, angel food cake, shortbread, pound cake, crumble topping with cream! Delish!

Loved the fruit salsa which isn't really salsa so much as chopped fruit, but super delicious.  The cinnamon chips did nothing for me so I will not make those again.

I loved the flavour but most of my guests thought it was too sweet. I will reduce the sugar next time. I deleted the kiwi since I’m allergic to it and did not add a fruit is it’s place.

I used the fruits I had on hand which were mangos, peaches, apples, kiwi, plums, and used raspberry jam and sugars as called for. Took it to group and everyone LOVED it. I don't think you could mess this up no matter what fruits you use.

simple, versatile, and yummy recipe. A little time consuming but worth it. After reading reviews I made a few changes. Used Fuji apples, added an extra kiwi, used blackberry jam, and omitted the brown sugar. For the chips I brushed on melted butter mixed with a little olive oil instead of spray on oil.  Made it for a birthday party and everyone loved it.  Will definitely make again.

Awesome! This was super refreshing and I like that you can pretty much use any fruits that you want to...I used kiwi, strawberries, blueberries and mango, which was a nice combo.  The family gobbled this up...a keeper~YUM!!!! Thanks for sharing. :)

I have made this many, many times and it is always a crowd pleaser...such fresh yumminess!  Sometimes I add no sugar and other times I add a bit of honey (when the fruit is not as sweet as usual) and I have thrown in other fruits like peaches and pineapple on occasion.  You just can go wrong with this dish.

Very nice recipe. I used strawberry preserves. The sugar balanced the tartness of the raspberries, but I only put in a little bit (maybe a tsp of brown and white sugar each, same for the preserves). It helped keep the apples from turning brown.  I made the chips too, but cooked them a little longer to make them crisper. I also sprayed the pan itself first with butter spray and then layer the tortillas down on top, with a direct spray on them after that. Less messy that way, and found that I didn't need to use very much butter spray. The chips were a hit and I made a batch that was just salt (kosher) to go with a seven layer dip. I cooked my chips 11 minutes and cut them into 1-2 inch strips (no need to flip them while cooking).

I've been making this for years, however I do a kicked-up version. I use a quarter cup hot pepper fruit jam and add a couple shakes of cayenne pepper.  Also I do not add sugar, but add a couple tablespoons of honey and I added the juice of 1/2 fresh lime(this will also stop fruit from turning brown).

I only made the chips and they are amazing. I recommend just mixing cinnamon and sugar to your liking. I also ended up baking mine for 12 minutes, but it depended on your oven.

I made this exactly as written, and despite the fact that I love apples, I don't like them in this. I like this recipe the way it appears in the Better Homes & Garden Cookbook. Without the apples but with pineapple instead.  Their recipe also called for green onion, and some mild peppers, which gives it more of a salsa taste.

This was amazing!!  I didn't expect to have it turn out well especially using the spray olive oil instead of butter flavor but oh, I was wrong!  Loved this recipe and thanks for sharing!  I'm a cooking idiot so need all the help I can get!

This was good, but probably not something I would take to an event.  My tortilla chips were chewy.  Maybe I didn't bake them long enough.

I've made this a few times now and I like it because it's one of those recipes that folks can make their own. 
I did not add sugar to my mix and used strawberry honey jam...just a bit to bind everything together. I tried making the tortilla chips and they take too much work and only come out ok. I found they were impossible to bake "just right". Mine were either under done and wimpy or over and a bit burned tasting.  Now I just buy cinnamon sugar pita chips and they are so much better! Also, when it comes to chopping the fruit, just throw them in a food processor for a couple of pulses. I generally buy a small tub of mixed berries and a tart apple. A little goes a long way with this recipe!

I love this recipe, I sometimes change up some of the fruit, if I happen to have something that I think will be good in this.  This is one of my favorite things to just throw together, and I make my own chips, which are so easy or sometimes I buy bagel chips, cinnamon ones.  So good, and everyone always likes this one, and asked what how I make it....  Excellent one!

I have been looking at this recipe for years now and I finally made it for a party...it was fantastic!!  I used apricot preserves and instead of making the chips, I used Stacy's Cinnamon Sugar Pita Chips---mostly because I'm lazy..turned out to be a HUGE hit in a VERY PICKY family who does not like to try new things....

I really like the idea of this recipe, a healthier version of an appetizer or dessert, but I just didn't care for it.  The fruit was just too sweet w/the added preserves & sugar (& I didn't add the white sugar), and it was also kind of soupy after sitting a short while.  The cinnamon chips (which were also sweet) were ok, but  didn't go well w/the sweet tartness of the salsa.

Such a refreshing and delicious dessert or appetizer, but use melted butter, not butter flavoured cooking spray (is that stuff real food?).  I prefer to only coat one side of the pita with butter. Pomegranate seeds are delicious and pretty in the fruit salsa, which can be made with a variety of fruits.

I used this recipe for a cooking class at 4-H camp this summer with campers ranging in age fro 12-18.  Our first lesson was on slicing and dicing, so this was a great recipe to use with all the fruits that get added.  We found a strawberry jalapeno jam that added just the right amount of kick to the salsa.  We went light on the sugars, and we added a little lemon juice to keep the apples from browning .  Because we were short of time, I just sprayed all of the sliced tortillas at once and tossed them with cinnamon sugar and spread them out as evenly as I could on the baking sheet.  We had some stick together, but the final result was enjoyed by not only the campers in the class, but also by the volunteers who got to try to leftovers!

I made this for a birthday party at work and it was a hit! It was easy to make but took longer than the time shown on the recipe. I will definitely make it again! The next day I saw the healthier version which I will try as I'm not sure the extra sugar is needed.

I made the salsa without any added sugars and it was so good! They're not necessary, the salsa gets sweet enough and "saucy" enough on its own.

Fun and easy to make and was devoured by my bunco club! I added a nectarine for varied color, I bought apples already in wedges , green & red, and left the peels on (they got plenty soft enough)and used Raspberry jam. I did drain this prior to serving. Changes to the crisps: It was simple to brush them with melted real butter...after adding the  sugar & cinnamon  I did use butter spray to 'set' the sugar. Everyone loved the idea that they were baked, not fried.  I will serve this again and again!

First off, you should know that this was so fun to make! I took this dish and the cocktail meatballs to a baby shower, and it was thoroughly enjoyed by all!  When I was making the "chips, I melted down some butter and mixed in cinnamon sugar, and coated both sides of each chip before baking, the "salsa" was uber yummy, and the best part of making this little project.  All in all, great snack to share, and you'll be then on dubbed the "snack lady or man" of your group. Enjoy y'all !

I will definitely make it again.  I used our favorite fruits, don't have to use the ones in the recipe and it was delicious. We drizzled a little lychee honey over everything for super yummylicious light and fresh dessert, would be good as par of a Sunday brunch too.

I don't add the sugar, since the fruit is sweet enough for us.  It is always one of the first things to disappear at a party.  This most recent time I added mango and blueberries to the apple, strawberries and kiwi.  I buy the already made cinnamon pita chips.  Yum.

Love this recipe! Instead of chopping the fruit, I put all the ingredients in my food processor. You can make it chunky or smooth. This recipe freezes well; a plus since it makes quite a bit. Love it, love it, love it!!!

This is surprisingly good. DEFINITELY hold back on the sugar; I more than halved it and it was still very sweet. I used strawberry preserves,  and served with plain Greek yogurt on the side. Toughest part is cutting the berries. But this is a nice go-to that I will certainly be making again.

Really delicious and easy to make. I chopped all the fruit pretty small. I used strawberries, Apple, and mango. I used 1/2 the sugar called for and all of the preserves ( strawberry.)  cinnamon chips are definitely worth making. Goes perfectly and salsa is still great a day later.

I have always come back to this recipe because it is so good. But recently with everyone going to healthier options, I decided to make this a healthier option as well. It's gluten, dairy, and soybean free. I make the salsa with coconut sugar and simply fruit preserves only. Makes it taste just like the original. Instead of tortillas  I use white corn tortillas. Don't spray. anything with an aerosol but use Smart Balance butter soybean free- sprinkle with coconut sugar and cinnamon mix. You do have to cook the corn tortillas a little longer to get them to crisp. Mine took 10-11 mins. Good Luck

Every gathering I've made this for over the last few years - from Girls' Night to new-baby visits, this is always a hit. I omit the sugar from the salsa and sometimes use only fruit in season.

The fruit salsa is always a hit.  Everywhere I bring this appetizer, I get requests for the recipe.  I have, however, taken the easy way out on the chips and purchased the bags from the grocery store.

Substituted kiwi and fresh raspberries for frozen mixed black berries, raspberries and blueberries.  Used apricot preserves once and raspberry preserves another time. Liked apricot better. Didn't make tortillas,  but I bet they're amazing. Used cinnamon sugar pita chips instead. So good!!!

This is a great recipe, and it's easy to change based on what fruit you have in the house. I didn't have kiwi, and I used nectarines instead of apples, and blueberries instead of raspberries. Also, a fun touch, add cilantro to give it a "salsa" kick!

One word!! WOW! This is WONDERFUL!!! Yum Yum Yum!! I got invited to a family gathering and was asked to bring  a snack ! I was clueless what to bring im tired of the same old thing we usually have (chicken wing dip,Rye Bread bowl dip and the list goes on lol) I decided to be the odd one and bring something a Bit more healthy! And Boy let me tell you this was a HUGE Hit! Everyone loved it! the tortilla chips were the BOMB!!! Oh my goodness so crispy they reminded me of cinnamon graham crackers and the fruit salsa was just plain good! I used strawberrys,apples,kiwi and blueberrys! To die for!!

I made this for a party last night. I diced up 1 Granny Smith Apple, 1 Fugi Apple and 1# srawberries, 1 pint raspberries and 1/2 pint blueberries. Added 3tbls Strawberry Preserves and refrigerated for 2 hours.  Took about 1 hour to dice everything. I did not have time to make the chips so used Stacy cinnamon pita chips but they were a little thick. Not too many people touched thus appetizer and my husband thought it was too sweet. Mi plan to mix leftovers into yogurt for snack. Probably won't make again

Love this salsa ... I always use a granny smith apple, but alter the other fruit by what's available - I have even added pineapple and red onion (crazy I know, but try it !! ) 
I usuallly strain the fruit mixture before serving and I omit any additional sugars - great salsa in any season !!

TIP: Do NOT use brown or coconut sugar in place of white sugar. It ruins the beautiful red color and you cannot get it back. I used strawberry all-fruit for the preserves and the salsa was amazing! It tasted perfect, perfect balance of strawberry sweetness and tartness from the kiwi and (Fuji) apples. Only problem, few tried it at the party because of unfortunate appearance. My family and I will enjoy it just fine, just don't make the same mistake.

Doubled the kiwi, didn't include any sugar or brown sugar & used Major Grey's preserves.  Smeared butter on tortillas instead of spray & it worked great!  loved this recipe and will make it again :)

This stuff is addicting.  I make it a lot.  What I've learned is you can pretty much use any combination of berries and fruit and its always awesome.  You don't have to use exactly what's listed.  I usually go a little simpler with just the apples, strawberries and raspberries with a blackberry or blueberry preserve.  If you are short on time or just don't feel like chopping fresh fruit I have found that a bag of frozen berries works just as well.  I also tend to go a little heavy on the cinnamon sugar, personal preference.  If you use the small tortillas, lay down a sheet of tin foil and spray some of the butter cooking spray on it then lay a tortilla in the spray, spray the top of the tortilla then put another tortilla on top of that one then spray it and continue stacking that way you get both the top and bottom with less work.  Then just cut through the entire stack.  Following that I sprinkle cinnamon sugar on them  as I take them off the stack and put them on the tray to go in the oven.  Its the quickest, easiest and least messy process I've found for making these.

Heavenly!
Made this today, it was wonderful. 
One review said the fruit was soggy and I suspect they didn't chop up crisp apples. I used Fuji apples (because they are very crisp), 2 tablespoons of apple jelly and 1 tablespoon of grape. Wonderful. Had it for lunch and dinner:)

LOVE this recipe and now have made my own variation that is requested time and time again.  Sugars and fruit preserves as it adds to the sweetness and I just don't think it needs it.  Granny Smith apples, kiwi, pineapple, and strawberries is my fruit mixture - be sure to cut small - the citrus in the pineapple keeps the apples from browning but I will sometimes squeeze some fresh lemon into the mixture.  Dice up all fruit, add a tsp of cinnamon to fruit mixture and refrigerate for a few hours.  Serve with homemade chips or do what I do a lot and buy the Stacy's Cinnamon & Sugar pita chips in the chip aisle.... so fresh, sooo good!  My kids would rather eat this for dessert over cakes and cookies!

This recipe is awesome!  My only complaint is that it is very tedious, but at least the result makes the work worthwhile. I made it for a birthday party and people raved about how much they loved it! I doubled it- and the chips- made PLENTY!  I used strawberry preserves.

This recipe is a hit no matter how I make it (sometimes I chop up bananas, oranges, etc., to add).  Because I think it is healthier, I spritz the tortillas with water instead of the cooking spray. It works great.

Super-delicious summer side/appetizer!  The chips are to die for and definitely make this dish extra special.  We like ours less chunky, so I use the food processor for a more salsa-like consistency.  I highly recommend blackberries in place of the raspberries and I usually eliminate the apple.  My whole family LOVES it...and then I use the leftover salsa in muffins for a delicious breakfast treat!  Thanks!!

A great alternative for the reviewer that did not like this recipe-- I generally make a version that is just a container of strawberries, two kiwi & one apple, put in the blender (easiest to do each fruit separately and then combine).  Can leave it chunkier or make it more of a liquid-type consistency, which is how I like it.

Every year I make this for a Christmas buffet, there is never any left over! I use bananas, kiwis, honey crisp apples, and strawberries. For the jelly, I use red raspberry preserves with the seeds (any brand) it is a nice substitute for actual raspberries because I find the raspberries get mushy. Plus, the red raspberry preserves make the apples taste like candy apples! Love it!

Loved the salsa!. I liquefied the (apricot) preserves in the microwave, tossed in some blueberries and mango, even a bit of fresh pineapple I had in the fridge.  Vanished in nano seconds!  Nix the chips. BLAH! not worth the effort!  I'm just glad I had the tacos in the fridge and didn't buy them especially for this recipe.. Next time some puff pastry twists?  Thinking of it all in all...nothing new really so only a three star thanks to the chips

Made this for book club and everyone liked it a lot.  The cinnamon chips and the fresh fruit "salsa" went very well together.  I changed up the fruit to use what was in season.

This turned out runny and messy for me--I took it to a potluck and people liked it, though. Can't say it did much for me. I'll stick to fruit plates from now on. The chips didn't do much for me either, they could definitely be improved. However, I'm giving it three stars because I was asked for the recipe. Someone liked it!

This was a huge hit! We served it with ice cream. I must say though, if eating with ice cream, leave the apples out! I will definitely be making this again :)  The chips were better the next day! They had a chance to dry out a little & were a bit crunchier!

This fruit salsa was sensational.  I failed at making the cin tortilla chips.  I'll have to take a crack at that again, but the salsa alone was wonderful.  Followed the advice of other reviewers and...
Used Orange Marmalde for preserves
Used Frozen Peaches instead of raspberries
 For The Fuji Apples - Cut & Add last

Thanks for the great recipe.  Definitely going to be one of my go-to recipes this summer.  I made it with triple marmalade (grapefruit, lemon, and orange) and Splenda (parents are diabetic so I wanted to reduce the sugar).  So delicious. Everyone loved it.  Served with a little whipped cream on the side.

I forgot to buy apples, but I had two mangos, which was AMAZING!!! I think that I might do it that way every time since the other fruits are so decadent, and I think that the apples might add an unwanted crisp for me. I also cut the sugars in half since mangos are a bit sweeter than apples. But what an awesome recipe!! I wasn't sure about the preserves, but come to find out, I think it makes it! I used blackberry/raspberry preserves. YUM!!!

I followed this recpe as it was written except I didn't have raspberries which I think would have given it a better colour. I thought it was over all OK-OK until I added a large splash of amaretto liqueur and that made a BIG difference.  You really have to watch the tortillas in the oven or they'll burn. If I ever make this again, I will: 1. follow what some said to coat the tortillas on both sides wiht sugar/cinnamon and 2. Add raspberries and maybe some brandied peaches!

"Salsa" was a little weird--kind of a mush of flavor. The softer fruits just turned to mush. Chips were great!

You can save calories without forfitting taste by doing a Splenda/Cinammon mix. My daughter cannot eat sugar, and also have several diabetic friends and relatives, it would be a sin to prevent them from enjoying this lovely fruit dessert/appetizer.

An easy and wonderful fruit salsa.     I substitute fruit depending on whatever fruit I have available. Also, I just cut the fruit into large chunks and blend all the fruit together in a blender/food processor.

Made this for a kid's birthday party and was a huge hit with both kids and adults alike. I put the cinnamon-sugar mixture in a ziploc, sprayed the tortilla pieces with Pam, and then baked on a cookie sheet.  Will definitely make again.

This was pretty good.  As a pregnant woman, I confess I had hoped it would be better, but it is really good.  I forgot to buy apples at the store, so I didn't use those, and no kiwis either.  To help replace the bulk, I did add frozen peaches and pineapple.  Also, after reading other reviews, I left out the sugar, and then used "less-sugar" apricot preserves.  I might prefer it a teensy bit sweeter, because the raspberries are so sour. Also, aside from the raspberries and blueberries, I pulsed everything else in the food processor, and they came out fine-- not crushed or soupy.  I really will try to remember to grab apples when I'm out today to add later-- I look forward to their contribution to this colorful and light snack!

What a great recipe! I'm not big on fruit, but the sweet tortilla chips meshed wonderfully. There was quite a bit of liquid in the bottom of the bowl so I would suggest draining the salsa if you don't plan on serving right away. Of course, the amount of liquid also depends on the types of fruit you use. A refreshing summer recipe!

Amazing salsa.  Made it the night before and it was really liquidy.  Next time I wont put the sugar on until about an hour before serving.  I also bought my chips from Target, big time saver.

ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL!!!   Biggest party hit on Superbowl Sunday!   I have now found my next fav thing to bring to all the brunches, showers, etc.   I was a little skeptical and my husband was questioning why I wanted to make this, but he couldn't keep his hands out of it!!  A MUST!!!!

I just made this for a superbowl party yesterday and it was a BIG hit!  And it was so easy to make too!  I used apricot preserves and had to use frozen strawsberries (since my grocery store didn't have any fresh).  I tried to drain them but they still made this a little juicier/soupier.  It was still great though and I've had many requests for the recipe.

Awesome!  My entire family (husband, myself, and 4 younger daughters) all loved this.  My husband will usually not eat anything like this.  He took a bite and was hooked.  We will defintely make this again and again, especially for get togethers.

Great recipe. I didn't give it 5 stars because I thought it was too sweet. Next time, I'll use less sugar/preserves - the fruit has its own sweet taste, so all that sugar is unnecessary. We ate it with yogurt instead of the chips for a healthier  snack. Will definitely make again.

Hey this is good stuff!!  I used the fruit I had on hand, which was kiwis, apples, peaches, strawberries, blueberries and grapes; mixed it with about 3 tablespoons of raspberry preserves; no added sugar, plenty sweet enough.  The chips were great; improvised a bit here too: didn't realize I was out of sugar (who runs out of sugar??  It's a staple!!) so I used about 2 tablespoons of powdered sugar and about a teaspoon of cinnamon and made the chips according to the directions.  It came out really good.  Thanks for posting.

This was a HUGE hit at work Monday morning.  Berries aren't readily available right now so I used frozen, a bit soupy, but still tasted great.  And the cinnamon chips were easy and so yummy!!  Will definately be making again when fresh berries are available.  Thinking Mango would be a good addtition too.

I cheated on this and put the fruit in the food processor. It came out slightly runny but still tasted pretty good. The fruit that I used was already very sweet and the added sugar and fruit preserves were not necessary.

YUMMY!!  This is a GREAT salsa!!  I plan on making this again and again!  I did not use the apples, but used a mango inside with a orange/apricot preserve.    I did not use the amount of sugar in the recipe.  I only used 1 Tsp of white sugar.  I bought Cinn. Sugar  Simply Naked Chips @ the store.  I found it quick and simple to make and absolutely wonderful, as did all of my guests!

This was a huge hit with everyone--young and old alike.  My son also liked the salsa as an ice cream topping.  I followed the recipe for the salsa exactly with the exception of using fuji apples as I think they hold their shape better.  It looks lovely for an appetizer for a dinner party as well!  Thank you for the great recipe.

I make this all the time. Great for parties and the kids love it for dessert. I always use whatever fruit is in season, to save on freshness and price. Well worth it!!

I've made this several times and it always disappears really quickly.  Very good when you can get the berries in season but I've made it using frozen berries and it's still really good.

There were no raspberries or kiwi's at the store so I left out the kiwi and replaced the raspberries with blackberries. I cut up the blackberries so the salsa was really juicy, not at all like the picture, but I liked it better that way. I didn't think the preserves were really needed and I used all brown sugar because I like the flavor it has.  The chips were great but my dad said the salsa was really good on his waffles too!

i've made this salsa several times and really like it.  I vary the fruits according to what is available. Instead of tje tortillas I use "scoops" using the same method.  I spray them with cooking spray, sprinkle them with cinnamon sugar. and toast them lightly in the oven.  Quick and easy!

I didn't care for this, but I give a 5 because everyone else did!  I followed the recipe exactly and I actually thought the fruit mixture could have been sweeter. (I am probably that rare person) Like everyone else says - the chips are a hit.  They were super easy to make - I put my sugar/cinnamon mixture in a pie pan, then sprayed my tortilla on both sides and put in pie pan to coat both sides, and then I cut with pizza cutter... the plastic bag thing was just too messy I thought.

Great recipe with the mix of fruit, although the homemade cinnamon sugar chips weren't what I expected.  Target does have pre-made cinnamon sugar chips by their Archer brand in the chip aisle.  I will try that next time.

Fruit salsa was great.  The cinnamon "chips" were not as great.  They weren't crispy enough to dip in and get some salsa on.  I had to add a spoon to the salsa for people to spoon on to their tortilla.  I saw some cinnamon tortilla chips at the store the other day and I think I might try those next time.

I made this for a potluck at work and it was a hit!  Thank you for this recipes, it was delish!  The only thing I did was to omit the sugar added to the salsa.  That suggestion was good, it didn't need it.  Will have to make again!

I made this for a Halloween brunch and it was amazing!  I used 8-inch tortillas, sprayed each side with butter spray, and mixed them with cinnamon sugar in a gallon sized plastic bag.  Then I used a pizza cutter and cut the tortillas into eighths (like a pizza). I baked them for ten minutes and let sit for about a half hour - they were perfect! I liked using the 8-inch tortillas because they were smaller once cut, more like a chip.  For the salsa I mixed kiwi, raspberry, blackberry, apple, and peaches, then a little raspberry jam and some sugar.  Everyone loved it!!!

This one of those things to bring to a church pot luck.  It's colorful, tastes pretty good, and compliments the other mystery dishes well. On the other hand, I brought it to a family get-together where every thing was made from scratch.  They thought the fruit was good and didn't like the chips.

I made this for my father's surprise birthday party. At first I didn't think anyone would try it and decided that it would make a great ice cream topper. Then all of a sudden it vanished. I received many compliments and raves. I did not make my own chips, but instead I found some cinnamon chips in my local grocery. I will definitely make this again and I still may use it for an ice cream topper!!

made this at a party and there were no leftovers. i used strawberry jam. My only suggestion when making the chips is spraying the tortilla with butter first, then placing the tortilla in a bag with the sugar and cinnamon and shaking it until it's fully coated on one side. Do not spray with butter again otherwise chips will come out soggy and not crispy.

I have made this recipe for quite a long time and it is a hit!  I have used mixed frozen fruit.  Thaw the frozen fruit to a semi-thawed state, then chop and mix as directed in the recipe.  It is delicious and refreshing especially at the holiday time!

Great recipe and everyone loved it.  Was asked for the recipe by several people. I substituted a tablespoon of honey for the white and brown sugars and used orange marmalade.  I used melted butter instead of the spray and dredged both side in sugar cinnamon mixture. Will be making this again and again.

Wow, this was wonderful. The cinnamon chips were great on their own. It makes a huge recipe, so I half it and use the left overs over ice cream with a couple cinnamon chips. The fruit is also good for breakfast.

This is a WINNER for sure!  I made it for a baby shower and used cookie cutters for the tortillia chips and they were a hit! I sprayed them on both sides with olive oil and then shook them in a gallon bag with the cinnamon sugar mixture to coat. It worked great. I added peaches and used strawberry preserves in the salsa. I also did just half the sugars so that it wasn't overly sweet. I will be making this again and again. SOOOO GOOOD!

A different and tasty spin on salsa.  You can also buy cinnamon chips instead of making them if you are short on time.

This was an absolute hit at the party I attended! I did however alter the recipe just a tab by opting out of the apples and using canteloupe and making my kiwi the main fruit in the salsa. The chips were gone before the salsa too! I saw some people just eating the chips by themselves. AWESOME RECIPE!!!!

Sensational! This was a hit at my son's baptism. I used kiwis, apples, strawberries, blackberries and blueberries. Omitted both sugars, and pureed the berries then added apricot jam. Refrigerated until set. Also, I used butter-flavoured margarine instead of spray to coat my tortillas. Accidentally cut the chips a little too small, but they were still dip-worthy! Some guests asked to bring some home, too! I will definitely be making these again!

I followed the advice of the reviewer before me and didn't add the sugar to the salsa.  It was a huge hit. I made it last night, and had requests this morning for the recipe in my inbox.  Thanks!

This was a huge hit!  I only added one apple and used homemade strawberry jam and my girlfriends loved it.  I also added a few ripe blackberries since they were just begging to be picked.  I love how versatile this recipe is!

I made this twice in 2 days, each time for a different pot luck.  The first time I omitted the white sugar, served it with cinnamon graham crackers and it was great!  Not thinking it could get any better, the next day I took the time to make the cinnamon chips and it was even better!  The second time I used less apple, and more berries, just to my personal taste.....I will use this one again!  FYI, the hint about using the sink to stack 4 tortillas at a time in to eliminate mess was pure genius!  I took it one step further and lined the sink with aluminum foil....just wad it up & throw away when done!

I have made this for several baby and bridal showers and it is always a hit.  If you don't have time to make the chips - try the Flat Earth fruit chips in the chip aisle of your grocery store.

Wow! Added frozen blackberries in place of raspberries and used spoon to spread real melted butter on each tortilla.  Then cut with pizza cutter, shook in bag with sugar cinnamon mixture and baked for 10 minutes.  Perfect!

Delicious! Took it to a party and everyone loved it!! I left out the white sugar because it as really sweet enough. I also used apricot preserves, because I didn't want it to have a strong strawberry flavor.  The next day we blended what was left and made parfaits.

I made this for a my friends and they loved it! Not crazy about raspberries, so I used blueberries instead. I tried the egg slicer like someone recommended, but it didn't work for me. I used a chopper instead. Next time, I'll drain the chopped fruits, it had a little to much liquid for me. My husband suggested adding chopped jalapeno peppers to add a little kick to it - maybe next time.  LOVED the chips.

This recipe is awesome.  It's not even so much the exact ingredients, but the idea itself.  I didn't have the same fruits so I used what I had on hand--including pineapple like the previous post--and it was delicious.  I think it would be really fun to make for a party or potluck.  It doesn't keep very long so I put the leftovers in crepes the next morning.  Now it's got me thinking about other ways I could make homemade chips--like garlic and parmesan.  I love that the chips taste just as good as or better than store bought and they're not fried.

I have made this many times and have always gotten many compliments.  I have used various fruits with not problems at all with browning, and never add the sugar.  I also use sugar free preserves.  Some have mentioned draining the salsa, but I do not feel the need to do so.  If you run out of chips, the leftovers are great as a side salad/snack too.

This recipe was a hit with my family.  I have made it several times and each time it has gone over great!  I have tried it with different fruits and it has always been great!  Also, to meet the dietary needs of my family, I have replaced the sugar with Splenda.

My family and friends really loved the chips and salsa. I left the sugars out of the salsa and added a peach. It was delicious. The chips were easy, if messy, and great even without salsa. Thanks for a great recipe.

This was excellent! I don't really care for raspberries, so I substituted blueberries instead. I also cut down the white sugar to 1 tablespoon as previous reviewers had recommended. It would have been way too sweet otherwise. For the chips, make sure you actually mix the cinnamon and sugar together before sprinkling it over the tortillas. I figured I would sprinkle each separately and the cinnamon ended up burning. When you use the mix, they come out perfectly!  My only other issue is that it came out a bit runny. Not sure how to fix this. Otherwise, a great recipe!

Brought to a potluck lunch at work, everyone loved it. I used apples, kiwi, blueberries, strawberrys and a peach with no sugar added strawberry preserve. I took the advise from others and didn't add any extra sugars. I also used the advise of using a bag to coat the chips, worked wonderful. Time consuming but well worth it, a summer favorite for our family

This review is for the cinnamon chips (our salsa was much different--just used what we had: mixed berries, apples, and a fruit/melon bowl) The chips turned out well, and, as others have stated, are good with or without the salsa. The only issue we had was with the amount of cinnamon sugar. We cut it down to 2/3 of a cup and still had leftovers (and felt that the chips had a bit too much sweetness). Still yummy though!

I'm not sure why everyone is saying it takes so much time.  I literally chopped everything in less then 10 minutes.  I made the chips in no time either.  The most time consuming thing is actually baking the chips.  Easy as can be and delicious.  I agree about the chips though, make lots they are so good.  I used raspberry preserves and think I'll choose something else next time.  Mine was good to me, but possible a little tart for some.

*Edit--made it with 1 less Tbs white sugar, and it's still amazing and perfectly sweet!--This salsa is outstanding!  I've had one before and went searching for the recipe, and this is a great one.  I didn't have raspberries but had a couple of nectarines that needed used, so I substituted them.  The result was better than I could have imagined.  It tasted wonderful and really rounded out the color!  I also used apricot preserves.  I can't imagine docking this recipe stars because of the labor...anything that calls for this much chopping is obviously going to take a little time!  I always make up the time by buying my cinnamon pita chips but will definitely try making these tortillas next time.

I really like this recipe.  I give it a 4 only because it can be labor intensive.  I"ve made it twice and both times were a hit.  The second time I used a chopper I have that made it alot easier to do.  I will have to find the cinnamon sugar chips to try as a short cut too!

I only made the Cinnamon-Sugar Tortilla Chips. They were really good and nice and crunchy! I used a pizza cutter to cut the tortillas - It was much easier and made a nicer/smoother cut compared to using a regular knife. It was so quick to make - and really satisfies the sweet tooth. (Keep an on the chips that they shouldn't burn)

I have made this for several years now and always a hit. If I don't have time (or it is too hot to turn on the oven) I pick up Stacy's Cinnamon Sugar Pita Chips and it works out great. I have to search around a little for the Cinnamon Sugar flavor, but I have luck at Whole Foods (so I stock up when I get there).  Also, my toddler really likes this, but it is difficult for her to scoop out the salsa, so we add the salsa to vanilla yogurt and she LOVES it!

I thought the salsa was outstanding. I put in in my yogurt and in my ice cream. I will try it with angel food cake next. I thought the tortilla chips were not substantial enough though. Their flavor seemed to get lost in the flavor of the salsa. Next time I will try using cinnamon pita chips.The pita chips are a little thicker.

This recipes is great to have on hand.  I always make extras to put over ice cream.  I buy the cinnamon sugar pita chips in the store to make it even easier.  This recipe is a hit no matter where I take it.

delicious and easy.  made it twice to take to pot-lucks.  the 2nd time i couldn't find actual cinnamon sugar at my grocery store so i made my own and it was just as good!  a big hit with everyone.  the fruit salsa is good enough to eat alone!

I made this for a family get-together and everyone raved about it. They especially loved the cinnamon chips.  I followed the recipe exactly, except I didn't have raspberry, so I used blueberries.  Still delicious. Definately a keeper. Thanks.

The only thing I changed was I changed the raspberries to blueberries because I couldn't find raspberries.  I thought it was pretty good but my friends loved it so it was worth it.  I will make this again but with less apple and maybe some peaches.

This recipe was GREAT!!! I did not use the exact fruit listed in the recipe, I just used what I could find. It was delicious, I brought a huge bowl to work and by the end of the day it was all gone, which never happens since our office is so small. I will make this recipe again and again.

Cinnamon chips were excellent. They do require some patience and work.  The fruit salsa was good but very sweet. I elminated all sugar and it was still very sweet.

This was great. I made the chips, which were surprisingly crisp in spite of not frying them. But what was REALLY great was that I also served the fruit salsa inside crepes topped with my brown sugar whipped cream. Wow! It was a hit with my family.

I had high hopes for this recipe, but it was really just OK. The sugar/preserves combination didn't do much for the fruit. It was hard to scoop up with the chips (which were delicious, I must add!) so my guests used a fork to eat the salsa. Won't make this one again.

Excellent but need to cut down on the sugar.  I tried it without using any sugar but still using the preserves.  Also, once I did not have rasberries and used pineapple instead, that too worked great.

Well when I saw how many reviewers raved over this recipe I had to try it!  This recipe get five "Mmmmmsss" I served it at my cocktail party and it was LOVED by everyone.  I like the flavors of the sugars and used only one tbsp. of strawberry jam because that's all I had and it was incredible.  Lots of juice so I think I'll just drain it next time and use the juice for a smoothie.

Oh My Gosh!   Superb recipe.  I've made it several times now with different fruit and each time it gets better!  I think the homemade cinnamon chips are a must.  Had to bake a bit longer to get them crunchy.

Oh my goodness.  I don't usually write reviews of recipes, because I typically tinker with them a bit to suit my tastes.  But since I had never made a fruit salsa, I thought I would just follow the recipe as it was.  Absolutely delicious.  My husband and I went through half the bowl for dessert tonight, and he was eating it with a spoon after we ran out of chips.  The only caution I have is to make sure you keep an eye on the chips...I over-cooked the first batch, and although they weren't burnt, because the sugar got over cooked it had that nasty bitter taste and I had to throw the whole batch out.    I hope to make this often-I'm sure it would be phenomenal over angel food cake or shortbread.    Delicious recipe Annie-thanks for sharing!!

I rated this 5 stars because of the ease and tastefulness of the recipe. I've made this a few times and I found that making the cinnamon chips took the longest. I've tried many types of tortillas for the cinnamon chips: wheat, spinach, whole grain, and they all turned out great. Instead of sugar, I used 3 coffee-sized packets of Splenda.  When I'm in a big rush, I just pick up a bag of cinnamon apple chips at the market - then the recipe only takes 10 minutes.

This was great & gone before anything else. I would probably use cinnamon grahams or something instead of the chips, just because it's easier, and I had a lot of the chips leftover.

I love this salsa!  I didn't have all of the ingredients so I used alot of frozen fruits - mango, mixed berries, strawberries, etc. along with the kiwis and apples.  I read the reviews from some other people and left out the sugar and it was still plenty sweet.  I also used the egg slicer idea which was a huge time saver as I didn't have to dice all of the fruit.  Unfortunately, I am now addicted to the cinnamon/sugar chips though.  :o)

Very good!  Like other reviewers, next time I'll probably just use already-made cinnamon pita chips.  The salsa was very good & sweet!  Next time, I may cut down on the sugar, but I liked the idea of using jam.  I used strawberries, plums, pears, & Granny Smith apples.  This is a keeper!  Thanks!

A little time consuming, but VERY good.  I don't use the brown sugar.  Doesn't need it.  I pulse everything in the food processor except for the apples.  I do chop them pretty fine though.  About the size of quartered water chesnuts.  Adds a nice crunch to bites.

Very sweet. I wouldn't add as much sugar next time. Also, I served 1 cup of fruit with 2 sheets cinnamon graham crackers instead of making the chips. 230 cal and 2.5 grams of fat. This felt like a dessert!

At first, I kept thinking to myself, "This really can't be that good." After I made this I was astonished by the mix of fruit flavors. This appetizer will be a must have for my daughter's first birthday and all gatherings at my house from now on. For the preserves, I used 1 Tblsp Lingonberry Preserve and 1 1/2 tsp boysenberry syrup. Also, I halved the recipe and used the blender for the fruits so the salsa wouldn't be too chuncky.

I made this recipe yesterday for friends and family at a jewelry party and everyone loved it the only difference is I used four pilsbury pie crusts - placed them on parchment paper, buttered them, then sprinkled them with sugar and cinnamon and baked them for 12 minutes at 350 - great for kids!

This fruit salsa is amazing! Everyone who tries it absolutely loves it. In addition to the fruits listed I add blackberries or other seasonal fruits that go on sale.

Awesome fruit salsa.  Tastes best when the fruits are in season.  I cheated and bought the cinnamon chips.  I left out all of the sugar and used strawberry perserves.  The salsa tastes great in homemade sangria!

Excellent!  I did do the spraying & sprinkling with cinnamon prior to cutting just to avoid making such a mess and I did that to both sides instead of just one.  I followed the salsa recipe as written & it was very yummy.

LOVED THE SALSA but hated the chips.  Ended up buying cinnamon graham crackers for the dip which worked out to be even tastier than the chips. Great recipe!

OK seriously...almost two thousand 5-star reviews cannot be wrong, and they weren't. This was absolutely delicious! I made it as an appetizer for us to eat while baked potatoes and the rest of dinner did their thing, and we hardly had room for dinner by the time it was ready! I used apricot preserves. YUM. This recipe is awesome and is instantly one of my favorites. Thanks so much!!

Oh my goodness this was tasty!  The chips were great, so easy.  I served this as an appetizer at Thanksgiving and everyone loved it.  Several asked for the recipe and couldn't believe how easy it was.

I have made this recipe several times.  I enjoy it very much with minor modifications.  The first time I made this, I liked the overall taste, but had the following issues: the salsa was way too sweet for my liking, it had too much liquid, and the cinnamon chips were a pain to make.  Since then, I have made it without adding the white sugar (reducing the sugar also makes it less "soggy" since the liquid is not drawn out of the fruit) and substituting store bought cinnamon pita chips for homemade-- they're much more convenient and, in my opinion, taste better and have a texture suited to this recipe.

This is a little bit labor intensive, but worth it.  I used I Can't Believe It's Not Butter spray and sprayed the tortilla first.  Then I cut them using a pizza cutter and dipped them in the cinnamon sugar mix.  I had the kids help out and that sped up the process.  I does make a lot, though, so I would only make it for a large group.

This was pretty tasty. I brought to a dinner party and most people really enjoyed. Definitely make your own chips as the store-bought chips just don't taste right with this recipe. 

I used apricot preserves and barely any sugar.

Absolutely BEAUTIFUL! One of my favourite recipes and I've made it three times in two weeks... We're addicted, eek! 
I've used blackcurrant jam/preserve which works absolutely beautifully, adds a great twang while keeping it sweet & fruity.

Absolutely delicious!  It was a little time consuming to cut up the fruit.  I didn't have raspberries, so I substitued blueberries.  Will make a great Fourth of July, red-white-blue dish.  Everyone I work with loved it!

Unbelievably good! A lot of work, but it is definitely worth it! I skip the raspberries, and use Granny Smith apples.

Absolutely terrific. I make this for picnics. Fruit salsa can be a little runny and sticky, but everything tastes wonderful and people always rave about how good it is!

This is so good! A bit time consuming with chopping everything up.  I probably would have cut the chips smaller so that people wouldn't be tempted to double dip.

Great recipe! I added blueberries and it was a nice touch. Also, after cutting the tortillas with a pizza cutter, I placed them in a gallon ziplock with the cinnamon and sugar as it really reduces the mess.

very good recipe.  a fun change-up for the summer!  i guess the reason i only gave it four stars is because its really time-consuming and the outcome wasnt "just amazing" to me.  but it definitely is good...and would be much easier if you just cut out making the chips and found some at the store.  
thanks for the recipe!

I followed the recipe and found it to be tasty at best. I was really disappointed b/c of the number of high ratings and time required. Make sure to bake the chips long enough (12 min worked for me), otherwise they are chewy.

I made five recipes from this site for a party we had recently and this one got the most praise.  I even had one of the guests take the leftovers home, he liked it so much.  It became both appetizer and dessert.  My kids asked me that night if I would make some more (when they found out the leftovers were gone)!  My cinnamon chips didn't work out just the way the recipe said but I improvised and all is well!

This is a great easy recipe for the summer. I got lazy, so instead of making the cinnamon chips I bought Stacy's brand and they were just as good.

This was sooo easy to make! I mixed strawberries, nectarines, kiwies, and apples with a little splenda and some rasberry sugar free jelly for the fruit mixture. And splenda instead of sugar for the chips.  This is a great dish for dessert and for parties as an appetizer.  The only bad thing is that it can get a little soggy and get a lot of juice if not ate in one day but i just put in in a strainer to drain the excess juice and it was great again!

This recipe was a fantastic!  I would definitely cut back on the sugar and cinnamon combo.  I found that I had a lot left over and had to dispose of the excess.  Also, my fruit ended up having a lot of juice, so it made it a bit messier.  Not sure why there was so much juice in the bottom of the bowl!  Overall, people loved it...it is a great appetizer or dessert!

This was fantastic!  I made this for a party and it was great.  I made the chips by spraying 1 side of the tortilla with butter flavored spray, cut them with a pizza cutter and dredged them through the cinnamon sugar (1 c. sugar to 1/2 T. cinnamon).  I did the first batch doing both sides but the side facing the cookie sheet remained sticky.  2 trays for 12 minutes at 350 worked great.

The salsa I used 2 pounds strawberries, 1 mango, 3 kiwis, and a can of drained crushed pineapple.  I reserved ~1/2 c. of the juice and mixed that into the fruit with 1 T. brown sugar and 3 T. strawberry jam.  It was just right.  I cut everything Friday, mixed Saturday.  Today is Monday and it still tastes good.  The extras will be pureed and made into fruit leather.  Will make again!

This was really good. I just chopped up the fruit by hand. I made some changes as well after trying it once or twice. First, I wouldn't put any extra sugar in there besides the brown sugar. Second, I saved some time by spraying 3 tortillas at a time with the butter and then sprinkling them with the cinnamon/sugar and THEN cutting them. I only put a bit of butter and cinnamon/sugar on them or they started to stick to the pan during baking. Also, I only let them bake for 4-5 minutes or they got burnt. They get more crispy as they cool. Overall, a great and tasty recipe I will make many more times.

Served this as dessert, not an appetizer or snack as stated in the description. My family and I all loved it, except for my picky little sister. I didn't have good raspberries, so I just left those out and used the same amounts of everything else. It ended up fine, though. The cinnamon chips were good too...nice and crispy.

Throw another 5-star review on this bad boy!  I chopped all the fruit by hand, added the apple last (no browning!), ommitted the sugar, and used orange marmalade.  I also bought Cinn. Sugar pita chips from Trader Joe's (no time to make my own - but there were DELISH!) and brought to a BBQ.  People went nuts.  It was so crisp, refreshing, and light.  People took leftovers home so they could use it in champagne and make sangria with it.  Thanks for a fabulous summer treat!

this was great.  I used someone else's advice and sprayed both sides of the tortilla and sprinkled both with cinnamon and sugar.  I also used Raspberry preservatives, which made it a little tart for my taste, so next time I will try marmalade.  everyone loved it though.

One of my favorite appetizers.  To save time, instead of making the pita chips, I have bought apple cinnamon chips for dipping.  This recipe is also delicious on top of pancakes, waffles, and on toast.  My kids love it!!!

This was wonderful...I do have to say I did not follow the recipe well, but more the idea...as suggested, I reduced sugar (about 2 tsp brown sugar, no white) and no preserves.  I added some orange muscat vinegar instead of some lemon juice to reduce browning of the apple and for a little zip- yum!  I would also try a good, aged balsamic next time.  For fruit, I used frozen mixed berries, apples, a leftover peach, and some leftover frozen mango.  The chips really made it!  I used Smart Balance  Over all, a great hit with me, 11 yr old boy, and dad.  A great, pretty healthy dessert and great way to use leftover fruit!

I made it with an assortment of fruits and left off the extra sugar as others suggested. The chips were great!

I've made these not using this exact recipe and it's delicious. You can use any fruit...cranberries, mixed berries and orange is another good mix. One thing I will say is you really don't need any preserves or the brown sugar either. Maybe just a little br. sugar but not much. Save on the extra sugar and just eat it  natural. You won't be disappointed and neither will your friends...unless you eat it all. My usual mix is...2 oranges, gala apple, granny smith apple, pineapple peaches and strawberries from frozen mix bag. Delicious!

This dish is quite tasty and very easy to make. It was a hit at our picnic. I think I will get a lot of use out of those cinnamon chips

Only need to put sugar/cinnamon on one side of the chip or not very thickly on both sides. Nice desert for a summer night BBQ on the patio.

Excellent!  I made this for my family and everyone loved it!  I used butter instead of Pam on the tortillas and it still turned out great.  I will definitely make it again soon!

This is a great recipe. I brought it to a girls night and got a great response to it. I didn't add any sugar, and used homemade strawberry jam. It was plenty sweet without the sugar. I didn't have quite enough raspberries, so added some frozen peaches which I let thaw in a strainer to eliminate some of the juices. The apples I plunged into lemon water for a second before adding to the salsa and they didn't turn brown. I don't use anything in an aerosol can, so lightly brushed melted butter over the tortillas and it worked well. I'll definitely use this recipe again.

This was really good. My husband and I couldn't stop eating it. My kids liked it a lot too. My husband liked it even better without the chips.  Update: To date this is absolutely the best snack I have ever eaten. So far, it is the best recipe I've gotten on this site. My older kids cut up all the fruit because they don't want to wait so long to eat it!! We do leave out the raspberries and we use Gala Apples instead. Delicious!!!

Great, refreshing dessert.  I replaced the white sugar with Splenda.  Also, to save time I used a bag of pre-made cinnamon sugar pita chips instead of making the tortilla chips.

Brought this to a picnic with friends. It went over amazingly well! everyone wanted to know how I made it. The only thing I changed was that I didn't add much sugar - just a pinch.

GREAT GREAT GREAT!!!  I had really ripe fruit so I didn't add any sugar at all.  I also couldn't get Golden Delicious apples so I used Galas.  I also left out the raspberries because they are so expensive and I don't really care for them anyway.  No one missed them at all! It was fantastic.  I also used a little lime juice on the apples to keep them from browning. I used strawberry preserves.  The chips were so good that people were eating them with this and with a chocolate chip cheese ball I made.

This is fantastic! The perfect summer dessert. I made a few changes. I didn't add any of the sugar. I just did the fresh fruit and 3 T. of sugar free jam (I used apricot) and it was definitely sweet enough!

The salas was great.  The chips are a little to sweet if you put them in a ziplock with the sugar and shake in my opinion.  I thought they were much better when I just sprinkled the sugar and cinnamon on top.

I followed the directions exactly and made this for a bridal shower. It seemed like everyone liked it, but it wasn't the huge hit I was hoping for. Easy to make and the cinnamon chips are delicious. Perfect for a summer outing and definitely something out of the norm.

This recipe was so simple and delicious! I used the required apples, kiwi, and strawberries, but raspberries were expensive, so I used apricots instead. Next time, I would add only 1 Tablespoon of white sugar to the fruit mixture since the chips are so sweet on their own. I did like the juice the sugar creates, making the fruit mixture more salsa-like. As for the tortillas, only one cup of cinnamon sugar was needed. These could be a great snack on their own! Great recipe!

This is amazing and the chips are fantastic. I tried to short cut the chopping process by using a food processor - I wouldn't recommend this... the apples were cut too small and ended up soft. Hand chopping is definitely the way to go. It may be time consuming, but it is worth it!

Great recipe. I brought this to a party where I heard many fancy appetizers were being served. I was a bit nervous...but people loved it!! I added mango and skipped the brown sugar. I cooked my chips as 400 for 8 minutes, it just really depends on your oven. Thank you

My family really liked this one.  I wasn't quite as thrilled as them because I was just expected something unbelievably good after reading the reviews.  I think if I could find a way to improve upon the chips, I would enjoy this more.  I'm also going to try it with different fruit combinations.  I will be making it again though, just with some variations.

This recipe was great. I used melted butter instead of the spray and cut the tortillas after sprinkling the cinnamon & sugar. I put the fruit in cups with a chip in each cup.  It looked so colorful!  Everyone loved them.

I made this for my son's 16th birthday party...I had a house full of teens and they went nuts over it.  I used apples, pears, kiwi, blackberries, strawberries and bananas and omitted the brown sugar. It was awesome with the cinnamon chips.  I also served it with marscrapone cheese sweetened with a little bit of sugar and flavoured with vanilla. The kids were spooning the fruit onto the chips and topping it with the cheese.  A definate keeper!

This is a staple in house for summer get togethers. So easy to make and always a big hit. The only change I make is the mixture of fruit and jam. Whatever is in season goes in the salsa. So fresh and yummy, sometimes i sprinkle it with chopped mint. Great way to sneak fruit passed the kids :)

This was an awesome recipe. It goes great as an appetizer, dessert or snack. I bought the small tortilla's and cut them into halfs, then halved again; and it made enough for a HUGE party. The fruit dip was great too, but I don't recommend cutting the strawberries with an electric dicer/chopper because it made them too runny. Overall, an AWESOME and creative recipe.

This was a great recipe! I used 3 kiwis, 3/4 lb. strawberries, one large gala apple, and a handful of diced boisenberries. I used only 1 Tbsp. of brown sugar, 2 Tbsp. of strawberry preserves, and none of the white sugar for the salsa and it turned out very juicy and delicious... and I used half the amount of cinnamon sugar for the tortillas and there was plenty of flavor! Definitely a keeper!

Brought this to a friend's house for a "girls night" and it was a hit!  The host came up with a different way of serving it:  dished it out in individual bowls with spoons so we could eat on the couch without the risk of stains, topped with whipped cream, and the cinnamon chips crumbled on top.  It made a freshingly healthy snack after our dinner of pizza with a side of chips and dip!

WOW!  Thank you Ann!  This was a fabulous recipe -- and so easy to make.  If I were able to give the recipe 10 stars, I would.  I made it for a wedding shower, and not even 10 minutes into the event, three people asked for the recipe.  Since the shower was held at work, and I had to prepare everything the night before, I was afraid to make the tortilla crisps, for fear they might get soggy or stale, or taste like the plastic Ziplock bag I'd store them in.  Instead, I bought two bags of the Flat Earth chips (in the regular chip aisle at the grocery store) -- one in Blueberry Patch, and the other in Peach Mango Paradise flavor.  The different colors of the chips resembled the multi-colored tortilla chips often served in Mexican restaurants, and paired really nicely with the salsa.  (The chips were a huge hit too!)  I used another reviewer's suggestion to slice the kiwis and strawberries with an egg slicer.  Worked great.  Thanks again for a lovely recipe.  It earned me a few complimentary titles including "domestic goddess" and "Martha Stewart" of the office.  :-)

I thought my kids would go crazy for this as an afternoon snack. But for some reason they didn't like the chips. I didn't sweeten them as much as reccomended- I only sprinkled them with cinnamon and sugar mix after spraying with Pam. Instead of sugar added to the fruit, i put in 2 tablespoons of honey. They wanted to eat the fruit like a fruit salad with a fork! My husband and I devoured the chips. I'll make it again and try to coax the kids into trying the tortillas as I am always looking for healthy ways to get whole grains into their growing bodies.

This is so good.  I made this for a casual party at a friends house and had three people ask for for the recipe.  I followed the recipe exactly except I substituted blackberries (halved) for the raspberries and spread Smart Balance on the tortillas.  Very good.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

ok so I made the recipe EXACTLY as written as I agree that its not fair for someone to review the recipe if they have changed it. It does not need the extra sugar, the fruit and preserves do plently for it.  I liked  the chips it was a welcome change for desert and I will definately make it again (with some minor changes ;)

I did this for my monthly book club and everyone LOVED it.  I omitted the sugar and used organic blueberry preserves-I also put a small amount of lemon juice on the apples so they wouldn't brown as quickly.  It is a bit time consuming, but well worth it!!!

I made this recipe exactly and found it to be a bit too sweet, especially with the added sugar on the tortillas.  Next time I will cut the sugar in half and use white flour tortillas.  We normally use whole wheat, but for this recipe I think white would taste much better.

I used one granny smith and one pink lady apple for a difference in texture and flavor.  I used half the amount of sugar and brown sugar but added two extra kiwis.  Everyone raved about how simple and how many different things they wanted to try it with (ice cream, oatmeal, and thanksgiving dinner to name a few)
I'll be making this for many more family nights!

This was a huge hit at a summer party.  If you make the tortilla chips, watch them cuz they will burn.  Next time I'll make the salsa as is, but will probably try to track down some sweet tortilla chips.

I only made the salsa and it was delicious but liquid was quickly extracted from the fruit.  next time I will not add extra sugar, just the preserves (I used mixed fruit jelly).  I also subbed frozen peaches for the raspberries and really liked their flavor and color addition.  I also used a fuji apple and 2 days later in the fridge it is still crisp and not brown.
instead of making the cinnamon chips (I was really pressed for time) I served it with Cinnamon Sun Chips and they were great, with their ripples, for scooping up the fruit!

Made this recipe AS IS, and it was to die for!  My husband was being silly and said, "its like an explosion of like 20 different things in your mouth."  He loved it and so did I!  My daughter got a glimpse of the kiwi i had put into it so she wouldnt touch it, but she loved the cinnamon chips! THANK YOU!

Amazing!

I did use 3 kiwis, which were needed, and would possibly add blueberries, blackberries, or sliced grapes next time.  I used apricot fruit perserves which were really great.

Kids ate this like crazy!

I really gave this recipe 4 starts because I really enjoyed the fruit. I agree with previous reviews that it is a little too sweet. I will cut back the sugar next time. I tried to make my own chips per recipe but they did not come out well. I will purchase the chips next time. All in all, I will make this recipe again!

I used kiwis, apples, peaches, blueberries, and crushed pineapple.  Also used apricot preserves.  Also made the chips.  Very delicious.  Really did not take too long to make.  Would definitely make again.

After all of the great reviews for this recipe...I have to admit I was a bit disappointed. The fruit became mushy and kind of soupy. I took the advice of a lot of reviewers to tweak that issue, but overall it was one of the only dishes on our holiday appetizer table that went almost untouched.

I have made this twice, to rave reviews.  It is a good, fat-free, healthy dish for parties. I used honey instead of white sugar.  I also used frozen berries and mango, because fresh raspberries are too expensive to chop up.  Really easy, and delicious.

Very tasty. I went the easy route and served the salsa with packaged cinnamon sugar pita chips. Next time I will add cinnamon or cloves to the salsa because it needs a little spice.

I made this to snack on before the Thanksgiving Turkey was ready. My family loved it. I substituted chopped Mango for the Rasberries because they are so expensive. I also did not add any sugar and it was still sweet. Everyone asked me to make it again for Christmas!

i've made this time and time again for every picnic i've gone to! my boyfriend loves fresh produce so he always suggests switching it up every now and then. i've added bananas, granny smith apples (for color), and once i tossed in mango! and you really can use whatever kind of fruit preserves, it's so easy even if you're not a cook. i always use less sugar otherwise it becomes too much like a soup.

Believe the ratings here- this is fantastic. I was reluctant to double spray the chips but it really makes them work. No changes needed here! (I did take the advice of one review and used Fuji apples- even the next day, none turned brown). This will become a regular recipe of mine, it's that good.

I don't eat kiwi or raspberries, but decided to try this for my book club this summer.  DELICIOUS, and worth all the chopping!  I did use store-bought cinnamon-sugar pita chips, which were heavy enough to hold the salsa.  Thanks, Ann, for a wonderful recipe!

DELICIOSO!...Great light snack/appetizer.  I made it exactly as instructed, including mixing the cinnamon sugar and tortillas.  The only thing I would change for next time is to buy cinnamon chips from the store to save time and to be assured of a crisp chip.

I've made this recipe a few times and it makes a lovely presentation, although it does get a little too juicy because of the sugar. I've decreased that and played around with the fruit. Everyone has loved the cinnamon chips and this recipe definitely stays in my box for future events.

Takes a lot of work...but, it is SO worth it. It's light, sweet and healthy. The Cinnamon Chips are the perfect "chip" for this salsa.

Add an island flair with mango instead of the raspberries. In order to prevent browning of the apples add 2 tsp of lemon juice. I dont add the preserves or the sugar. A great alternative to the cinnamon chips is waffle cone bowls.

Yum, Yum, Yum! It's a creative, tasty recipe and always gets requests for copies! I've found there's a fine cooking line on the tortillas between them not being cooked enough where they are too soft to over-cooked and brittle. If you can get that barely browned color, they are perfect! Well worth it!

Always looking for a new and interesting appetizer.  This was wonderful.  Went perfec with our crisp white wine, nice alternative to high fat dips and chips, by using splenda it was on the light and healthy side.  I would recommend this recipe to anyone.  Every guest wanted the recipe.

I have made this dish for many summer parties and every time, I have given the recipe out.  This is great!  I go along with the recipe but also add whatever seasonal fruit is available (grapes, blueberries, peaches, etc)  I will definately be making this often!

Absolutely perfect in every way.  I followed directions exactly..perfectly happy with everything.  HUGE success at recent party.  It was interesting to watch everyone's curiosity speculating over exactly what it all was slowly turn into a feeding frenzy!!

The family loved this yummy dessert.  Used a bag of frozen berries instead of the fresh raspberries.  We ran out of chips before the salsa so we used the salsa as a filling for crepes for breakfast.

Made this for a baby shower yesterday and it was a huge hit. I omitted the white sugar also and it was still pretty sweet.  My children were asking for more today so I made some more.  My son is a Type 1 diabetic and so we made some of the chips using SPLENDA instead of sugar.  We could not tell a difference in taste and it was great because he could enjoy the chips but not worry about the sugar.

This is great!  Added extra Kiwi, tends to get lost in the mix.  Strawberry preserves will make this the ultimate strawberry salsa.  Also cinnamon Sunchips were great to use for dipping!

Made this for my daughters bridal shower. DELICIOUS!!! I made extra of the tortilla chips with cinamon - glad I did! I didn't make too many changes - just used fruit I could get at the store.. kiwi, apples, blueberries, strawberries etc. Any fruit will work fine! I did use orange marmalade for the jam part - yummy! Everyone asked for the recipe!

Really, I don't think this recipe needs another 5 star review, but too bad. Made this for an anniversary party and it had rave reviews, including one older gentleman who asked for a container of the fruit to take home. I left out the kiwis and added chopped peaches and plums. Used splenda and Splenda brown for the sugars and strawberry/rhubarb for the preserves. It marinated for 2 days and the flavour was amazing. The cinnamon chips were also a relevation, people kept eating those without the salsa. Those I will make again just for a snack.

EVERYONE asks for this recipe. I omit white sugar. Love brown sugar though. I don't like tart fruit! Use pita chips that you can buy just about anywhere now.

I liked it, but didn't love it.  Just tasted like a bunch of fruit.  Chips were good.  I made them on a plate in the sink to minimize the mess.  My 16 year old nephew loved this, though.  "If this were a woman I'd marry her!" he said. Quite a comliment.

Wonderful!  In a crunch, I used frozen berries from the store and it didn't change anything.  I've made this with fresh fruit also, and both cases this recipe turns out fantastic.  No changes needed at all!  :)

This was FABULOUS.  I used seedless black raspberry jam, and would stick to a lighter colored jam so that way you can see the fruit colors... but it was still wonderful!

I enjoyed this recipe.  I brought it to a July 4th celebration so I made a few of the cinnamon chips star shaped by using a cookie cutter.  I used spray butter from a pump and thought the chips turned out good.

This recipe went wonderfully!  I was pinched for time, so served it with cinnamon grahams instead- still very popular.  Some folks used regualr tortilla chips for that satly/sugary combo. Only drawback is that it got slighlty watery by day 2.  Will certainly make it again!

This salsa is so flexible! You can use any combination of fruits (although those listed are fabulous) and you can definitely add some cool whip to this dessert. The cinnamon chips were easy to make and great to eat on thier own. Will definitely make again and again, esp. for family parties!

This is a great dessert!!!  I have made it twice already this summer and everyone loved it.  You can make this the night before also and the salsa becomes even sweeter.  We used our leftovers of this and took it to the beach...it was great and I had it as my lunch!  Thanks for a keeper!

I wouldn't add all the sure at first. Try half and then taste, it comes out rather sweet with all the sugar in the recipe. (I pureed for about a minute to take out some of the chunks.)

This is an awesome way to eat fruit. I used whole wheat tortillas to make it a bit more healthy. I didn't have any kiwi so I used two peaches instead and it tasted wonderful. Will make again! Thankyou!

Very good and a refreshing change from traditional dips.  Highly recommend taking the time to make your own chips rather than buy cinnamon chips.  SOOOOO worth it.  Will make this again and again! Thank you!

This is a big hit whenever I bring it to a party.  I have even for requests for it.  
Sometimes I fiddle with the fruit, if one type is fresher or I can't get something, but no matter how I have made it, everyone always loves it.

Love this recipe!  It's easy to make, and I am addicted.  Great snack for kids too.  I made this as an appetizer for Christmas Eve at my mother's house & it was a huge hit.  Can't wait to make it again.  Also great to pack for a car trip, picnic snack, snack for work, ok you get the idea.

This was AWESOME!  I brought this to a party over the weekend and everyone loved it.  The chips take some time and effort to make, so next time I may try serving the salsa with cinnamon graham crackers, which I bet would be great too.  This is definitely a keeper!

This was REALLY good.  I spent quite a bit of time chopping and making the chips, but it was definitely worth it. Everyone loved it and they kept eating the chips long after the salsa was gone.

An addictive appetizer -- delicious!  This is our "go to" recipe for entertaining this summer -- it is always gobbled up quickly and everyone asks for the recipe.  We add blackberries and use blueberry preserves and it is quite yummy.

OMG YUMMY!!  I used peaches, bing cherries, raspberries and strawberries. I also used a strawberry butter I canned this season instead of preserves. All I can say is YUMMYY!!

Kids love it, adults love it! I am going to make this again using different fruits.

I have been making this recipe for years & have been getting rave reviews!  I had to thank you for all the compliments I've been stealing from this great recipe!!  I could eat up all the salsa all by myself & the chips are to die for! My kids want me to make them just for snacks!  It's a forever keeper!!!

A little too sweet for my taste, but still very good. Had to watch my chips carefully because they browned up really fast in the oven. Thought they would be more flavorful, but next time I'll try more cinnamon.

My chips did not turn out well, next time I will make sure to coat them with more cinnamon-sugar, I think it should be the consistency of a churro.  The salsa was fantastic put on top of vanilla icecream.

This recipe received 5 stars from me because the guests at my party RAVED about this unique dish and begged me to bring it to the next get together. Myself, I wasn't totally impressed. It was good, but I didn't see what all the fuss was about. Thanks for pleasing my guests, though!

This was fantastic! I couldn't believe how many people loved it. It was gone in a couple of hours. The recipe was delicious. I didn't make the cinnamon chips, instead I bought the cinnamon Stacy's pita chips already made. It saved me a little bit of time.

I was disappointed by this recipe.  To me it looked like a soupy fruit mixture and I was not impressed by the taste. The chips were good and fun to make.  I would make the chips again before making this dip!

Took this to a church gathering.  It was ate up very quickly! Everyone enjoyed the "kick" of the raspberries.  I am not a lover of respberries, but I must say, this is really, really great! Thanks a million.  P.S. Was asked the next weekend for the recipe!

Yum! Great for a baby shower! update...made this for Christmas morning brunch and it was a huge hit!  It does make a lot though.  Great to take to a party.  This time since strawberries and raspberries weren't in season, I used frozen and it was just as good!

The salsa was awesome, but I deep fried the chips and I thought it was much better that way.

Wonderful!  I used frozen blackberries instead of raspberries, and I think you could probably use any fruit you like, and it would still taste great! Also, we loved the chips!

Ever since I tried this recipe, I can't get enough of those Cinnamon Chips!  As for the Salsa, I used frozen raspberries and instead of strawberries, I used diced pineapple.  The beauty of this recipe is you can mix and match different fruit combos! You don't need jam either.

This is a great recipe, very versatile. I have done many variations of fruit and flavorings. Tropical fruits with jicama and hot pepper jelly are one of my favorites. Whatever you like works and everyone seems to love it. Very nice for a change of pace.

the salsa was pretty good, but the chips were not very crispy.  if they had been crisier they would be better.

great recipe!  i cut out the white sugar, and only used about 1 cup of cinnamon sugar.  my only complaint is that the salsa was a bit soupy after sitting in the fridge for a few hours, but no one seemed to mind.

Took this to a potluck and it was a "hit".  I omitted the Rasberries and added 1 Mango, Red and Green Grapes (halved)and Blueberries.  The chips are wonderful.  I will be making them alacarte for sure.  Thanks for a wonderful, refreshing recipe.

This is AMAZING!!! I made this for my daughter's 3rd birthday party so us adults could have more of a "sophisticated" munchie, but EVERYONE enjoyed it.....I ended up copying down the recipe 3 times & have had phone calls requesting it for other friends. The thing I love is this is so versatile, you can make it out of any fruit, any kind of preserves, etc etc. Also the chips are AMAZING dipped in vanilla ice cream. YUMMY! This is definately a new staple in my house!

I wasn't sure how this would turn out but decided to try because of the many good reviews.  I was surprised by how great it was!  It was a huge hit as dessert for a Mexican-themed party.  Easy to make and very refreshing during the summer heat!

This recipe deserves 6 stars. It was the talk of our party!! We doubled the recipe since we were making it for 20 people. We didn't use apples but added nectarines and mango. We also only doubled the fruit and tortillas not the sugars or preserve. It was so good. Some of our guests even added it to their cheescake as a topping. Everyone wants the recipe.

This recipe was a hit!  The chips were gobbled-up (eaten w/ salsa or just by themselves). I added a tiny splash (maybe 1/4 teaspoon) of almond flavoring to the salsa.  I may put in half of the white sugar the next time I make it.  People were also putting the salsa on a pound cake that someone else brought to the same party.  Very versatile recipe!

This was the hit of our Mother's Day lunch! I doubled the recipe as we have over 20 people in our extended family. Even those who told me they "don't eat fruit" couldn't resist the temptation after all the comments. I just wish the cinnamon chips didn't take so long to make (esp. for this crew). This is a recipe for a lifetime thanks so much!!

Fantastic.  I deleted the 2 TBSP white sugar and 1 TBSP brown sugar (made it too sweet) and reduced the apricot preserves to 1 1/2 TBSP.  Instead of using 2 apples I used only one, but also added a ripe diced Mango and a small container of blueberries.  It has been a hit at every event!

This does make a lot of fruit salsa, but it's great.  My husband was asking me to make more the second the first bowl was empty.  I made it for a big church gathering, so I put in 5 kiwis, 4 apples, and twice the sugars and preserves- apricot works out the best.

Fantastic!  I used apricot brandy rather than fruit preserves and a bit of Certo to thicken.  This recipe was a HUGE hit and will be used over and over again!  Perfect for dessert at a summer bbq.

A very refreshing and healthy snack!  My family and friends all LOVE this - I've made it about five or six times now.  The only thing is, it makes A LOT of salsa, so you might want to either make more chips or use the leftovers for topping on ice cream (wonderful!) or pancakes.  This recipe is definitely a keeper!  Thanks, Annie!

Excellent recipe!  I will definitely make this again.  I cheated and bought baked cinnamon and sugar pita chips from the health food section of the grocery store.  This was very yummy!

The cinnamon chips are really good. I will make them again but I will serve them with something else...the fruit salsa was just OK.

This was wonderful.  I took it to a party and everyone loved it.  Since it's winter, I used frozen mixed berries, just thawed them and cut them up and I used apricot preserves.  It is so yummy.  The chips I made went so quickly there is enough fruit left to try on waffles.  YUM!  Thanks.

This was wonderful.  I made it for a carry in and everyone raved about it.  I should have tripled the recipe.  The chips were great and I make them now for snacks.  I used apricot preserves.  They added the right amount of sweetness without being overpowering.

I made this recipe 3 times in the first month!  Great for cookouts.  I like peach preserves the best.  I undercook the tortillas a little...about 7 minutes.  Leaves 'em perfectly crispy and still a little chewy inside.

I took this to a work gathering once and it's been requested at functions ever since.  I cut the sugar in half as it's a bit sweet. You also don't need 2 cups of the cinnamon sugar so I cut that in half as well.  My favorite is to use apricot preserves.  You can use other fruits that may be in season at the time but always keep the apple as a base.

Made this for a family party last weekend.  Got wonderful reviews from everyone. The kids loved the cinnamon chips. It's something different. Makes a ton of salsa. I added some blueberries to mine.  Very easy to make.  Will make again.

This recipe took a bit of time to prepare but it was well worth it! I used apricot preserves and everyone at the party I took it to LOVED IT. However, they didn't really use the chips to eat it they just ate it like a fruit salad.

WOW!!!!! That explains this receipe to a "T"  I was looking for a simple BBQ dessert and this was it.  I put the chips on a plate, added a dipper of ice cream and topped it off with the fruit, my friends were in love.  I have passed this recipe on to at least 20 people.  Love it, GREAT

I love this recipe.  You probably don't want to make until the day you serve it as the apples might not keep.  Also, I used whole wheat flour tortillas because I am on Weight Watchers and that lowers the calories and increases the fiber.

I had this dish at work and thought it was great.  I was glad to have found it here.  I made it for our family reunion.  They raved about it.  I tried the low-carb and regular tortillas. The low-carb tortillas were not as hard to chew, but more crisp.

Very yummy! I was short on time so I bought cinnamon graham crackers instead of making the chips by hand. My food processor came in very handy for dicing the fruit.. I probably wouldn't have made this recipe if it wasn't for that. Unfortunately, many guests at a 4th of July picnic didn't really know what the salsa was.. I had to put a note next to it. But those that tried it, loved it!

The salsa was great and the chips were even better! The chips are a bit time consuming---but WELL worth the effort in my opinion! Everyone RAVED!

I served this recipe at a party, and it was a hit. The only change I made was that I did not peel the apples.  The chips are super easy to make.  The only time consuming part is switching the trays in & out of the oven until they're all prepared.  Thanks for sharing!

Very good!  The only thing I might change is to cut back on the raspberries - they are a little overpowering.  Light and tasty, hard to stop eating it.

Simply amazing. I made this for cinco de mayo for the rest of my family, and they loved it. Although I didn't have any kiwis, I found that any fruit works great with it, although apples are a must. I used peaches, strawberries, and apples. 

Also, I deep-fried my chips, becuase I can and it's a whole lot faster/easier than baking them. Great Recipe. Saved this one, and so should all of you!

I made this for a birthday party and it was a huge hit. In fact I'm making it again this weekend for another party and I'm doubling the recipe. The only change I made was to use granny smith apples for the extra bite they have.

This was so yummy and tasty. i made it for a bridal shower and these girls were scraping the bowl. i omitted the kiwi's and added one granny smith apple instead to give it more 'bite.' Just make sure to chop the fruit really tiny. I didnt make the cin. chips- instead bought some from Claim Jumper. will defintely be making this again.

This was such a wonderful, summery appetizer. The chips were a huge hit and I will make this again and again. I used frozen rasberries but I think it would definitely be even better with fresh fruit.

Dee-lish!! Family loved it.
Chips were a little tedious to make. I think next time I'll try to find some type of thin cookie/graham cracker to use in place of chips.

This was so good!  I made the chips ahead of time, as well as the salsa.  I waited to add the kiwis until just a few minutes before serving. I made recipe exactly as stated, but the next time I may get more adventurous & add pineapple, or other types of fruit.  The only I won't do is add kiwis.  The other flavors overpower it & the expense of the kiwi wasn't worth it.

Very disappointed with this recipe.  I followed the recipe exactly, which I always like to do the first time, and it was way too sweet.  The chips were good.  I would not make this again.  Too much work, and nobody seemed to love it.  I do have to say, it makes a beautiful presentation.

This was very good. I brushed real melted butter on the chips, and used extra cinnimon, and it was great.  I also used the mini cupcake tins to bake them in, (which makes very pretty curls) but it makes sharp as well, so next time they will be flat.  I used frozen rasp. and strawbrys, and one apple and had plenty of salsa.  One of my guests stood there for a good 20 minutes just eating this one appetizer.  Thanks for the recipe.

This is a fantastic recipe!  I took this to a party and once people tried it, it disappeared!  I did have a little trouble getting the tortillas to crisp up but once they did it worked out great!  Thanks

I love the versatility of this recipe!  I have yet to make it the same twice, because I subtitute whatever fruits I have on hand or can find in season.  This one's a keeper!

This recipe was okay. The presentation was nice, but the cinnamon tortillas did not come out very crispy. There were a little more chewy which I didn't care for. The fruit salsa was okay but I just wasn't crazy about it. Maybe all the flavors mixed together were too much.

I left off the raspberries and used apricot preserves.  I think you need to use LESS cinnamon sugar on the tortillas.  This recipe is delicious!

This recipe was very good.  The salsa was a bit tart, but that could be from the raspberries we used.  It was easy to make and a pleasant change from the norm.

This is truly a wonderful, light recipe! Both fresh and frozen fruits work well! It is made easier if you are able to find prepared cinna-chips that are available often in the potato chip aisle. This cuts your prep time in half! Fantastic!

Everyone loved this recipe.  I'd skip the chips since they were time consuming and not my thrill.  I also served them with butter biscuits, the Marie Lu type.  I found some cinnamon topped ones at a Middle Eastern grocer which fit the flavors wonderfully.

I made the salsa portion the night before. I liked it, but it was better when it was freshly made. The day I served it with the chips, the kids went for the cinnamon chips without the salsa so I ended up with lots of leftover fruit.

this was great - i added a bit of mandarin to the mix and the salsa turned out very well.  i did use ten tortillas however, and ran out after about 75% of the salsa was consumed.  next time i'd make more tortilla chips.  but great recipe overall.

Fantastic, just exactly the way the recipe calls it. Loved it, loved it loved it. :) This is absolutely my favorite snack in the world. It's a pain to make and messy, so I don't do it often, but when I do make it, it's worth it!

This recipes was great!  I served it for a small party, and it's definetly enough!  I used saltless tortillas chips as a replacement for the flour tortillas.  I just cooked them the same as the directions said,and it in my opinion tasted wonderful.  I had sooo many compliments afterwards about how good it was.  Like the reviewer before me said, the winter months are not the time to buy fruit if you live in the northern states.  I ended up paying $3.68 for a small package of blueberries.  Overall I would say that this recipe is a keeper, and great for any occasion.

Absolutely delicious over vanilla bean icecream!! And so versatile, you can omit or add any fruit you like.  I added peaches.   Prepping is a little tedious, but worth it.

This was great! I thought it might be too sweet for an appetizer but it was perfect - nice and light and fruity. It did take some time to dice all the fruits tho, and I only needed about half of the cinnamon/sugar mixture that was called for. I'll definitely make this again!

I was invited to a cookout and instead of making a regular side dish, I decided to give this a try.  Making the salsa was very quick but the way I made the chips was quite time consuming.  I sprayed both sides of the tortillas with the cooking spray and then coated both sides with the cinnamon sugar mix.  I highly recommend cooking the chips on baking stones.

This dish was very easy to make and tasted great. Since I was doubling the recipe for a fiesta, it took quite a while to make all of those chips.  I did made the recipe easier and cheaper by buying frozen berry mix to replace the fresh berries that were not in season, but I am sure it changed the flavor and texture a bit.  Still very yummy.  The kids really loved the salsa and chips - even my toddler begged for more. And a couple of people made sure they got to take home leftovers.  This would be a great recipe for brunch too!

So tasty and a different type of treat. I added lots of other fruits and didn't even add all the sugar called for. Very good!

I made this today for the kids to have for snack after school.  They three of them loved it.  I just used strawberries, kiwi, and a can of dole tropical fruit, drained and chopped.  I added 3tbs. of orange marmalade for a citris taste.  It was great.   I'll definately make this again.  The chips were good on their own too.  I'm going to try corn tortillas with the sugar cinnamon next.

WOW!!  This is a fantastic appetizer/dessert!  It was the hit of a party we just had, and I think every single person there asked me to forward the recipe!  Next time I will add a bit less sugar in the salsa, as I would have liked it a little more tart. I also don't think the preserves were necessary.  For the cinnamon sugar, I used 2 cups of sugar and 1/2 Tbsp cinnamon.  Also, 8 minutes in the oven was perfect for the chips, 10 min. was too long.  Will make this again and again and again... even if my guests don't force me to!

I went to my first Cinco de Mayo party tonight and didn't know what to bring. I found this recipe and tried it on everyone and it was a big hit. It took me around 30 minutes or less to cut up the fruit and finish the fruit salsa.  Very good and very easy.  I would make it close to the time you're going to eat it because like all cut fruit the little bit that was left over was a little soggy.  The cinnamon chips were excellent.  My kids ate several of them before we even left for the party. They were extremely easy to make and a big hit. Thanks!

This was a fabulous recipe.  I made this for a BBQ and it went over very well.  Everyone loved the cinnamon chips and by the end of the night, they were all gone.  My husband wants me to make them for the guys at work.  This is definitely a keeper.

Used raspberry preserves and less sugar and made plenty of the cinnamon chips! This was the hit of my party!!  Gave out the recipe more than once before the evening was over. It's definetly a "keeper"!

This was amazing!  I will definately make it again.  The chips were quite time consuming but well worth it, I used real butter instead of spray.  Would recommend making it just shortly before eating.  Loved it!
