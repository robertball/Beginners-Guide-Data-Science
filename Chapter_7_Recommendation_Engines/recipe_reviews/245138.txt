Yummy stuff... Fall on a plate. I made everything in advance then assembled and reheated in oven for about 20 minutes @ 350. Only sub I made was dried rosemary.

Very nice recipe that was made less nice by me. I thought two apples was just crazy, but really would have been perfect. I also added some brown rice and it overwhelmed everything. Things that did work, I used pancetta instead of bacon, shallots for onions (should have doubled) and thyme for the rosemary (what I had). I will try this again, but use all of the apples and skip the rice. Thanks!

Recipe is delicious!  Instead of bacon, I used sage sausage.  It really made for a hearty autumn meal!

super easy!  flavour is fabulous!  
did not have any rosemary; or goat cheese so i used something similar. my apples were a little old, use firm apples!  not easy to add only a "pinch" of cinnamon, but i managed. lol. will make again.

I adore delicata squash but could never find any recipes specific to it. Found this one and WOW what a winner ! It is so beautiful and flavorful I think I might serve this to company in addition to family.

Yum! The flavors complement each other so well! The one ingredient I didn't have was goat cheese. All I had was brie made from goat milk. I love brie with anything, this included; however, I think this would be five stars if the correct cheese was used.

First time making delicata and I made this twice! It's AMAZING! I didn't have fresh rosemary but dried worked great. Will definitely make again next time I get a delicata in my CSA!

I made it, following the recipe exactly. It was good.  My first time purchasing or cooking with goat cheese.  I may try it with Gorgonzola or  blue cheese...  both might be too strong but I love both.  Apples, bacon and blue cheese are good together.  This was only the second time I cooked Delicata squash.  When I got them in my CSA I thought I'd never even seen one before but I probably have at the store and just gravitated to more familiar squash.
