This recipe makes a beautiful looking loaf. The texture and flavour were bang on but I had a little trouble getting the dough to come together and had to add extra flour, I must have done something wrong. I made this exactly as written although I was puzzled by the 1/4 tsp of onion powder, it didn't add anything to the loaf. Thanks Foresthome
