I used margarine instead of shortening and cooked it a lot longer. I used whole wheat flour too. I put a chocolate icing using Hersheys cocoa powder and confectioners sugar (recipe is on Hershey's box). It was delicious! Not exactly a brownie but not exactly cake either.

these were ok. it was more like cakes than brownies. i melted the shortening and chocolate, mixed the flour, baking powder, soda, and salt. then in a seperate bowl i mixed the eggs, sugar, and vanilla. i took the applesauce out of the fridge and when i opened it, i was disgusted to find green mold at the top of the applesauce. i used shortening instead. the brownies turned out kinda dry, but thats mostlikely my fault. thanx anywayz.

While this recipe looked totally like a cake when it came out of the oven, wasn't dry, wasn't even very moist. Very bland, lacked any good "brownie" quality flavor, wasn't sweet either. While I don't mind a cake style brownie but this really, wasn't that at all. My apologies, I will not be making this again, no one cared for it at all.

These were definitely very cakey, but they were also very tasty.  Consider frosting it.

Very bland, and did not take nearly as long as the recipe said it would take for them to cook.  I was going to put them in tins with other assorted goodies and give them out during the holidays, but not now that I've tried them.

Kinda bland, I made a chocolate frosting to put on when hot, so it made them more flavorful.  I did not think they were all that moist either.

I doubled the recipe and used a 13" x 9" pan  and baked it a little longer. My husband loves Cake brownies and this recipe fit the bill. Brownies were moist and delicious.
