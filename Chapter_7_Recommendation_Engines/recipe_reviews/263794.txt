Amazing! Didn’t have smoked paprika so I doubled the cumin. Followed the recipe otherwise and was very pleased with the result. Even my 3 year old loved her steak taco, minus the salsa b/c of the jalapeños. Will definitely make again.

These were excellent! Don't let the long ingredient list in the marinade run you off. They are things you probably already have on hand. The only change I made was to grill the steak. I'm typically not big on salsa with fruit but this went great with the steak.
