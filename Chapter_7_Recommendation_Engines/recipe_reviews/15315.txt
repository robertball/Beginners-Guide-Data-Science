Very tasty. I followed the recipe exactly, but couldn't achieve the swirled effect- however the flavor is very good! I'll make these again and maybe up the amount of cocoa powder to try to swirl it better!

I was looking for a nice healthy cookie my picky children could have at snack time and could also take to school.  I wasn't sure they would like them (because of the rolled oats) but it was a huge success! I still haven't told them about the oats...

I made two small changes to the recipe.  After mixing all the ingredients, I placed the batter in the fridge to make it easier to form into cookie shapes. For the swirl to work well, I put a little of the batter aside and mixed in some cocoa.  Once I placed the cookie dough on the cookie sheets, I made the swirl on each of them with the separate chocolate mixture.  Worked like a charm.

Definitely a tasty cookie.  It's a chocolate chip/oatmeal crossover.  It didn't swirl though.  I folded the dough enough so I could see swirls in the unbaked dough, but after baking the swirl was nonexistent.  If you're looking for a swirl cookie, you might want to look for a different recipe.
