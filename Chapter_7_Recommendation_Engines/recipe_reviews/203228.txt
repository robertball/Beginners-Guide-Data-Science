This was okay. I think we would have liked it better had I used orange juice instead of apple juice. I liked that it wasn't too sweet and we actually liked the pulp that we got in this smoothie from the orange.

Kids loved! I made 2 servings by substituting 1 cup of orange juice for the orange and used a 6 ounce container of strawberry yogurt, blended with some ice. Tasty and healthy - yay!

I really hate writing a negative review, but I did not like this smoothie at all.  The flavors just did not seem to work well together and it left an awful aftertaste.  I did try to drink as much as I could, but in the end just decided to tip it away.  There are so many better smoothie recipes on this site, will not be making again.  Sorry!

Fantastic!  To the person who commented that they didn't like it, perhaps you were looking for one of those overly sweet, syrupy smoothies that you'd buy from a chain coffee house.  I thought that the flavors were delicious as is, but of course, I like to make my own adjustments, too.  I was excited to see a smoothie recipe that I feel comfortable making for my toddler.  The creator of this recipe did a great job--naturally delicious without having to add sugar.  Kudos!

this is excellent, I registered just to review this one. I'm allergic to bananas, so most smoothies are out for me. This one dosent have the usual ingredient of several spoonfulls of sugar either, yet is plenty sweet. really liked the addition of chopped almonds, added a great texture.
