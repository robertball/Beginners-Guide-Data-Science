This was amazing! I halved the recipe because I only needed one tart and my boyfriend loved it. My one suggestion would be to add extra pudding mix to make the filling thicker

This recipe worked perfectly as written. I swapped out the apricots with blackberries and raspberries, but that was just personal taste. I served it at a cocktail party and got tons of compliments. It looks beautiful with the glaze.

Delicious and wonderfully simple. Replaced the apricots with blueberries, but the perfect pick-me-up with all this dreary weather!
