I enjoy the Goya products..  For an easy recipe.. look on the label of Goya Black Beans.  I use some green pepper, onion - sauteed in olive oil till tender, 1 can black  beans, 1 package of Goya Sazon seasoning and a touch of Goya Adobe seasoning.  Simple and Awesome..

We really liked this dish.  I paired it with grilled chicken rather than making it a main dish alone.  The beans were very very flavorful, but I couldn't help myself...I did drain and rinse the beans.  The liquid they're in just seems too gooey to me.  I used buttered jasmine rice with the beans, and it was a meal we'll definitely repeat.  Also I had to leave out the recaito because my husband and I both have those weird taste buds that make cilantro taste like soap.  Nevertheless, the beans were still perfect for us.  Thanks, Goya!

My favorite recipe! We eat this all the time. I would omit the sazon because of the MSG but other than that fantastic!

We leave out the olive oil to make a fat free beans and rice and use brown rice rather than white. Quick and easy alternative to boiling dried beans or using a slow cooker.

I didn't know what some of the ingredients were so I just skipped them and they tasted just fine. My five year old is a picky eater and he loves this.

Black Beans & Rice Haiku: "I LOVE Goya stuff. Didn't have the Recaito, so used cilantro." I used just about all of the Goya products called for in the ingredient list other than the Recaito which I didn't have, so I tossed in a handful of chopped cilantro. Really great stuff - incredibly easy to put together and delicious over rice.

Nothing out of this world or rocking my socks off, but it was good paired with the (amazing) Goya fajita recipe. I am pretty sure this is a personal preference; usually my beans are mashed and refried! I may try making some black refried beans next time.

A good tasting recipe I made my own Sazon seasoning and Jasmine rice and paired this combo off with a good steak and salad. I had a happy well fed husband at the end of the meal and a request to keep this dinner in the monthly line up.

Very nice recipe, enjoyed today with Goya's Ropa Vieja recipe.  One thing's for sure, you do NOT need a 4-qt pan for 1 can of beans.  A little more time consuming than my normal black beans, but I think it was worth the effort.  These beans were loaded with flavor.  ***UPDATE 11.6.19  Upgraded my previous review from 4 to 5 stars.  I've made this so many times that I don't even need a recipe anymore, and it  simply never lets me down.  This time it was served with Puerto Rican Beef Stew from this site and yellow rice.

I added extra garlic to mine. I also lightly rinsed my beans and added salted chicken broth instead of the wine. For my rice, I used Goya yellow rice. It was a simple meal and great addition to our Mexican night at home.

My husband liked these, but he likes the other black bean and rice recipe on this site better - as do I because it is easier to make, but these were flavorful.

I made this with 1/2 cup black beans to 1 cup brown rice. I also covered the dish with a little strawberry vinegrette.

Simple & just what I was craving. I used "no salt added" can of black beans. I used cooking sherry since it's what I had on hand. Taste great with garlic, chicken broth basmati rice!
