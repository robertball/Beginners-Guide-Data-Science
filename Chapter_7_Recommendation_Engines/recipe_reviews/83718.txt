I used green lentils as I couldn't find brown ones.  We love curried dishes, and I love lentils, but this recipe was just okay.  After cooking on low for 4.5 hrs and high for 2 hours, the lentils were still a bit hard, and the soup tasted like a watered down curry.  We added a large can of diced tomatoes, a can of consumme, a can of tomato soup, as well as chopped onion, carrot and celery.  After the additions it was quite good, but I had higher hopes for the original recipe.  If I made it again I would use canned cooked lentils.

This recipe is perfect!  I used red curry paste purhcased from the Asian food store.  I like big flavors and a lot of heat so this recipe was right up my alley.  Thanks for the recipe!

I love curry paste, but this recipe needs something extra. I added an onion and some lite coconut milk, but that still wasn't enough...

Simple, healthy and tasty.  I'll be keeping this recipe handy for future busy weekday nights.  I threw in some carrots, celery and onion.  Cooked all night, so I did have to add some extra liquid.  Good stuff!

This was very easy to make. I'm glad I checked on it half way through because my lentils were cooked in less than two hours! In terms of flavor, I liked the heat I got from the curry paste, but I agree with other reviewers that this recipe needs a little something extra. The flavor was mostly lentil with a curry after thought. If you really love lentils this recipe is definitely for you!

I added some extra red curry powder, onions and some veg. broth and coconut milk.  This gave it a very subtle thai flavor and my entire family loved it, even the picky kids!  Great recipe.

It turned out great but I did make a few changes. In place of half the water I used vegetable broth for some added flavor. I also added about 1/4 cup peanut butter (I love the taste of PB with curry although it could have used even more!), two TBS honey, and two TBS tomato paste. Topped it all with sour cream and it was excellent.
