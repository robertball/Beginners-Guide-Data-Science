I made the marinade for the chicken according to recipe.  Instead of the vegetables called for, I used a bag of frozen stir fry vegetables because that is what I had on hand.  I cooked it as directed.  The chicken was tender and the sauce was very flavorful.  We loved it and this will be my new chicken stir-fry recipe.  Thank you.

Really great recipe! I added snap peas because I love them. I also added some hot oil to give it a little more kick. (We like spicy stuff!) Will make this again.

this was decent.  I liked it but it needed a little more asian flavor to it for my liking.  It was not bad though!

I doubled this recipe because I wanted to have it for the entire week. Here are the changes I made:
Any recipe with soy sauce you must taste before you incorporate the rest of your ingredients. Having cooked w/ soy sauce before I knew 2/3c would be too much for me but maybe it works for others. Even in doubling the recipe, I only used "1/4" c of low sodium soy sauce. (Keep in mind, if you use terriyaki sauce, it has soy sauce in it so don't use both!).  Sesame seed oil is what gives most oriental dishes it's flavor but used sparingly.  A little goes a long way and it has a strong flavor. Brown your chicken first in the oil and then marinate it.  You will still get all the flavor when you pour the marinade you made in the pot w/ the veggies & chicken. For my marinade, I used 1/2c brown sugar, 1/4c soy sauce, 1/2c sweet & sour sauce, 1/4 rice wine vinegar, tbsp ginger, 2 tbsp minced garlic, 1/4c green onions, 3 tbsp red pepper flakes. Take browned chicken & put in a ziplock & pour the marinade over it. Place in the fridge for 10-15 minutes. I used thawed frozen veggies & only saut√©ed them in the sesame oil 3-5 min so they wouldn't get soggy during the cooking time w/ the chicken. I also used brown rice and all came out great!

I think you need to highlight to people not used to cooking with soy sauce, that they need to use a Dark Chinese Soy which is a lot less saltier than a Japanese soy or a light soy sauce :)

We couldn't eat this dish.  Total salt overload due to the amount of soy sauce this recipe calls for.  Be cautious!  I thought it was odd that I used 3/4 of my new bottle of soy sauce.  Chefs beware.....unless you absolutely love lots of salt!

This deserves 5 stars.  The sauce mixture is salty, spicy and sweet, exactly what I was hoping for. For those of you complaining about the level of saltiness - marinate the chicken in a portion of the liquid, just enough to cover it.  Reserve the remainder of the sauce and add at the end, a little bit by little bit, tasting as you go.  I don't understand why people blame the recipe for being overpoweringly salty, at the end of the day, you're the one cooking!  Any good chef knows they must taste as they go.  Wasn't too salty at all for us.

This was good. But I made a few mods to suit my personal taste and local availability,

 For veggies I used mushrooms, broccoli, red peppers and added some sweetcorn kernels at the very end. It made a very colourful (red, green, yellow) dish.

Also used a grated chilli rather than garlic in the marinade, and served with noodles not rice

I found that (since I like my vegetable reasonably crispy) I did not need the last 5-7 minutes cooking. Just stir fried the chicken in step 4, then added the veggies back for 30 secs to heat through.

I thought it was delicious. but to satisfy my preferences i made a few adjustments. 
added fresh cilantro, snow peas, mushrooms, and some store bought stir fry sauce in addition to the homemade so that there is more "juice" to put on the rice. 
I also think next time i'm going to put a pinch of wasabi to give it a little kick! :) 
this is the first successful stir fry i've made and i'm looking forward to making it again. Thank you!

This was great, but I changed everything about it.  Instead of chicken, I used ribeye steaks.  I swapped out the soy sauce for A-1 steak sauce.  And instead of the veggies, I made baked potatoes.  Come to think of it, it turned out to be steak and baked potatoes.  But it was delicious, 5 stars!!  Just kidding, I followed the recipe exactly.  It was excellent, thank you!

This was a very tastey recipe.  To give it additional pizazz add freshly chopped cilantro (1 Tablespoon per serving) and chopped cashews (2 Tablespoons per serving).

WAY tooooo salty if using the 2/3 cup soy sauce that recipe calls for. I used 1/4 cup of reduced sodium soy sauce to marinate 2 chicken breasts and that was plenty. Everything else I kept the same. The dish turned out decent.

Just tried it last night. Was easy to prepare and the whole family loved it. Tasted like it would if we ordered out. I put my own spin on it and took out the peppers and added mushrooms and zuchini to the mix. It was a great meal.

Excellent!!!  Even though I was forced to use Teryaki Sauce....as I did not have Soy Sauce!  I went to get the Soy and it was not there..... my mind quickly processed the obvious issues then on to possibilities....  There Teryaki was VERY good and I plan to rewrite the recipe for a chicken teryaki!

Loved this!  I used mushrooms, snow peas, red and green bell pepper and onions and I thought it was perfect.  I did do 1/3 c. Chicken broth and 1/3 c. Soy sauce, since someone said it was too salty with all the soy sauce, but I bet chicken broth has a lot of salt too.  Either way, I loved the garlicky sauce and it just tasted yummy to me.  My kids complain about their mouths being on fire so I just did a couple of dashes of crushed red pepper....next time I will do more....it wasn't spicy at all.

Fabulous!!!! I am by no means an experienced cook and chose this recipe because of the ingredients and ease of preparation.  Followed the recipe to the "T" and I have never had stir fry this good at home or in a restaurant. Friends and family love it. Have made it several times since, changing ingredients slightly depending on available ingredients (adding peanut butter to tonight's version). Fast becoming a "go to" recipe for me.

I used bagged stir fry veggies and my soy sauce substitute. Of course, I don't keep sesame oil on hand, so I used coconut oil. Love, love, love how quickly and easily this comes together and it is mighty tasty!

I had to substitute fresh ginger for ground and I used red, yellow and orange bell peppers. I didn't have any green pepper. I may have awarded a higher star count if I had had fresh ginger; unsure. I found it too salty and not quite enough sweet. I did add another 1/4 cup of brown sugar at the end and mixed it in to dampen the salty taste a bit. I believe maybe a low sodium soya sauce would be better. I would also consider marinating for longer to give more flavour to the chicken. However, my husband did love it! So 3 stars at least! :)

Usually I tweak recipes even before I try them and they turn out great but decided to follow this excatly. When measuring out the soy sauce I believed it looked like a lot but used the 2/3 cups anyway. Bad idea! The most salty food I've ever eaten. I tasted nothing else except soy sauce. My family downed it because they were hungry.

Do NOT add 2/3rds of a cup of soy sauce to this recipe, it's insanely salty!! I thought it was just for the marinade, but even then I felt strange pouring half a bottle of soy sauce on the chicken. I decided to add the chicken to the pan without the rest of the marinade, and then add the veggies. Even without the 1/2 cup of marinade that was left, it was really salty. I can't imagine if I had added all that sauce. I added 1/2 cup of boiling water instead. All the garlic and ginger was left floating in the unused marinade.  I wouldn't make this again, even the way I made it. Way too much work for a bad sauce.

We really loved this recipe. I'm a young cook and this was a simple recipe for me to wrestle. We added mushrooms because we enjoy them. The only criticism I have is perhaps there was /just/ a little too much ginger for our taste. I look forward to making this again!

I made it just as written and it was sensational!  Restaurant quality!  Definitely modify the ingredients for your own taste but for us this was just about as perfect as it gets!  Wish I could give it more stars!  And the fact that it is gluten free and dairy free is a bonus!

I absolutely love the marinade! I read some people found it to be too salty, but I added a  ton of more vegetables and it was just right! As another reviewer wrote, it will only have as much soy sauce in it as you put in it! Add to taste. I did not have cornstarch, so I didn't add that in, and it was still awesome. I also added snap peas and red bell peppers, just because I love them so much. This recipe is a wonderful template for stir fry.

The sauce is so flavourful!  Just be sure to use a low sodium soya sauce or it may be too salty.  I added my favourite veggies of cauliflower, red and green pepper, mushroom, broccoli and water chestnuts.  Have made it using asparagus as well!  I also like to throw in some sunflower seeds at the end and I serve with basmati rice!  This recipe is a keeper in my house!

No Chinese food I've ever had, even if its dark brown, taste like its main ingredient is soy sauce.  2/3 cup soy sauce? Really. You have to he kiddng me.

This is my go-to recipe for chicken stir-fry.  It is easy to fix, contains ingredients many people will already have in pantry/fridge, and is easily adaptable to accommodate a variety of taste preferences.  It's good just as written.  Suggestions:  if you want it saucier, then increase the marinade ingredients by 50%, if you want to use bottled minced garlic and bottled chopped ginger that works just as well as the fresh stuff, and if you have spice-averse eaters (kids), then cutting the pepper in half or not including it does not detract much. Oh yes, using low sodium soy sauce in lieu of regular soy works fine.

Has become my go to when I don't know what else to make. Just be careful with the amount of soya sauce that the recipe calls for. Put less in and you can always add more to it later if you don't think it has enough.

Great flavor but WAY too salty... would be 100% better if made with low sodium soy sauce! The recipe as is was overpowering even for salt lovers.

Had this recipe for dinner...WAY TOO MUCH SALT! I should have followed my instinct when mixing the sauce that called for 2/3 cup of soy sauce. Could barely eat it and I drained the leftovers to hopefully finish for lunch tomorrow. I would not recommend this recipe!

I marinated the chicken in the suggested marinade.  I used water chestnuts, baby corn, snow peas, a head of broccoli, onion, carrots, mushrooms, a yellow and a orange pepper and shrimp.  I used Trader Joe's stirfry sauce.  made 4 large breasts and a bag of shrimp, lots of veggies and 3 1/2 cups of rice.  just enough for 6 adults and 5 kids.

I wasn't aware that there was a variety of soy sauces available. Now I know that this recipe needs a dark Chinese soy sauce (as opposed to the much saltier Japanese style). I had to add quadruple the amount of brown sugar to cut through the salt flavor. Otherwise good.

I absolutely LOVED this recipe! The sauce is super sweet and tangy...I skipped using the red pepper since I have a little one who doesn't do spicy. Definitely making this again and NEVER buying bagged/frozen veggie/sauce mixes.

Very good!  I did cut back on the soy sauce and substituted a little teriyaki sauce.  I needed to double the portions for the sauce in order to have sufficient sauce to coat the vegetables in the final cooking.  4 stars for the recipe as written.

Holy salty!  It was good...ish.  If I made it again I would use 1/3 cup the soy sauce and 1/3s something else.  Chicken broth?  I only used 1/2 a cup of soy sauce and it was too salty.  My husband will like it, sometimes I think he burned his tastebuds off when he was a smoker.

This was delicious!  My husband and dad, both of whom don't like meats mixed with veggies, loved this.  I didn't have broccoli so added veggies I had in the frig. And it still worked tastefully.

We like spicy, so added 1t of red pepper flakes, but next time I'll reduce the brown sugar .. a little too sweet for my taste. Very good and easy for a weeknight meal.

This was really good. I hate to say, but I had to make one slight change. People have commented how the sesame oil brings out the flavor. That might be true, but it you are allergic to nuts you have to change that up. I used a combo of a EVOO and butter and it turned out just wonderful.  I gave it a four because if your cooking for guests some people might not even realize that sesame is a nut.

A basic stir fry that is fresh and tasty. Add oyster sauce and dry sherry for even more of the real deal taste. Keep your wok temperature hot and don't overcrowd.

Overall this was a really good recipe according to my family who is really into healthy eating. I used low sodium soy sauce, added red and yellow bell peppers, and used half of the amount of ground ginger (not fresh) because that's all I had. I marinated the chicken about 30 minutes and used a wok instead of a skillet.

This is delicious and so easy to make. I cut the chicken the night before and marinate it in the sauce overnight to save on time. I use broccoli, green pepper, and a can of baby corn and it's aways a favorite dish for my boyfriend and all of our friends! I've made this for parties and got rave reviews. This was my first recipe that I tried off this site and is one of my favorites.

I LOVED this recipe! So easy, and the perfect combo of a little heat and a little sweet.  I used chicken tenders instead of the chicken breasts and a bag of frozen stir fry veggies since I didn't have fresh on hand and low-sodium soy sauce.  Served it over a little bit of pasta (was out of rice too!) and there was nothing left. Great quick dinner the whole family loved - I will make this again and again!

Delicious, A good solid dish!  Easy to prepare and tasty. I used Bok Choy, green and yellow pepper and onion and it created a delicate Asian flavored dish.

Made this tonight and it was wonderful! I used sugar snap peas, sprouts, baby corn and broccoli. I thought it might be too salty, but it wasn't. The sesame oil gave it a nice, nutty flavor.

This was awesome. Chicken and veggies-- how can you go wrong? I made my own marinade by going through the fridge and the cupboard and putting in a little of this and that, but this recipe did encourage me to add ginger, which I did. Got a pack of stir fry veggies at the supermarket! So I started by cooking the chicken in the wok first, and then added veggies and covered the wok to cook for about seven minutes. It left the veggies a little crunchy, and it was perfect! Will make again. My husband loved it too.

I love this recipe. Very easy and I use it for every time I make stir fry!  Here is how I modified:  1. I use stir fry vegetables from Trader Joe's (so much easier). 2. When I add back the vegetables with the sauce, I also add about 3/4 cup of low sodium chicken broth. Makes the sauce taste so good and gives more sauce to our liking.  3. I added 1/2 teas of Chinese four spice -- gives it added kick.  4. I use gluten free, low sodium soy sauce.  My husband is my food critic and loves it!

This was okay, but seemed to have that pasty aftertaste you get from too much cornstarch....would probably cut that back to 2 tsp if I make it again.  Didn't fry the chicken, etc., but chopped up the breast from a leftover roast chicken from the deli. Steamed a bag of stir fry veggies with additional chopped green onion and subbed red pepper for green.  For presentation, I spooned the sauce over the Jasmine rice and placed the veggie chicken mixture on top.  Kids said it was good and ate it without me pestering them to eat their veggies....that is a success in my house...LOL!  With the modifications mentioned here I would bump my rating to a 4...easy, quick & nutritious recipe that would be much improved with the reduction of the "pasty" cornstarch taste.

Made this tonight, my first try at stir fry and my children's first time trying it, no leftovers! It was a success. Only thing I done different was I left out the bell pepper and just added more carrots and broccoli.

This was a fast and tasty stir fry.  I had to throw in ground ginger in place of fresh (I didn't realize I had no fresh left).  For my vegetables, I used a mix of broccoli, carrots, and corn.  This was just a bit on the overly salty side for us, next time I would replace 1/3 - 1/2 of the soy sauce with chicken stock or something similar.  Even with it being a little too salty, we enjoyed this.

This turned out great!  I got a little crazy on the veggies and added snow peas, baby corn, bean sprouts and an extra green pepper so I made 1.5x the sauce to accommodate my giant pot of food. Served with edamame and potstickers! Yum!

followed recipe exactly.  Everyone really liked it.  You could substitute pork for the chicken!!  will make often.  I have now made this several times and I don't marinade the chicken  anymore.  I just  add the liquid when I add the chicken back to the  wok.  This way there is more liquid to spoon over  each plate when serving.  Any veggies you like would work, this time i used frozen green beans instead  of broccoli!!!  YUM

SO YUMMY! Stir fry's are always in my dinner rotation as I find it quick, easy, and a good way to use up left over veggies. The sauce in this recipe is a really great base! I can't have gluten, so I usually substitute Bragg's Liquid Aminos for recipes that call for soy sauce. Born and raised in Hawaii, soy sauce is no stranger to me. It was obvious from the start that 2/3 cup would be way too much. I went with 1/3c. Bragg's and 1/3c. water. Twas perfect! I used the veggies that I had on hand, but that's exactly what's so great about stir fry's..you can use whatever you like. Thank you KatieKS for this recipe!!! 
UPDATE: 
Made this several times already...always get compliments! The only time I found that I can use the 2/3 cup of soy sauce is if it is lower sodium. Otherwise, 1/3 cup water, 1/3 soy sauce is best.

For the reviewers concerned about it being overly salty, try low sodium soy sauce.  It really helps cut down on the saltiness of the marinade.  I varied the veggies, using red pepper, edamame, scallions (instead of onion) and celery.  Yummy!

Few modifications... Less soy sauce for sure. I used honey instead of brown sugar, added some cilantro, and used rice noodles instead of rice. It's a good starting point, though!

This recipe was easy and delicious! I followed the recipe to the T using low sodium soy sauce. I also added green beans and shrimp for a little added veggies and flavor.  I ate without rice or noodles, trying to cut carbs. Thanks for sharing.

I made this recipe and thought it was excellent.  My husband and son loved the sauce flavor of the fresh ginger, garlic and soy sauce.  It was a healthy dish and we will make it again many more times!

Great basic stir-fry recipe for simplicity and flavor. Have used a variety of vegetables in this recipe depending on what's in the fridge and what we're in the mood for.

I made this tonight and it was very good! I did change it up a bit though. I used 1/3c soy sauce and 1/3c worchestershire sauce and doubled the brown sugar! I will definately be making it again! Even my 3yr old ate it and enjoyed it!

Made this and Best Egg Rolls (from this site) for a dinner party of 12 and everyone loved it! I used low sodium soy and extra veggies. Use fresh ginger - it makes all the difference!
Thanks for sharing a great dish!

This came out really good. I added snow peas from my garden and used pork instead of chicken because its what I had on hand. And at the end I added some hoisin paste for a bit more flavor, otherwise I stuck to the marinade recipe and husband & I both enjoyed it.

My husband and I both really liked this and I will make it again. I followed the recipe with the exception I had to use ground ginger 1/4 tsp) vs real ginger.  It was a bit too salty so I may try to reduce the soy sauce next time or use lower sodium soy sauce, if for anything, health purposes.

This was a good recipe but I did make a change. I cut the soya by half and replaced it with chicken broth and I'm glad I did. I love soya sauce but I think as written it would have been too much. I also cut the sesame oil to 1/2 tsp and replaced with olive oil due to personal taste and it was delicious. Other than that I made as written and it was very enjoyable over rice with spring rolls.

Simple and delicious! I was tempted to use ground ginger bc I have never used fresh. I didn't and I am so glad. It wouldn't have been the same! I subbed frozen sugar snap stirfry veggies, but other than that followed directions to a T. Everyone loved it, and I will make it often. Thanks!!

I made this because I had all the ingridents on hand.  I was worried becuase some said how salty it was, but I just added some water to my sauce to dilute the soy a little.  I had chicken diced and cooked already so I just added it to the sauce and let it sit while I chopped and cooked the veggies.  I added the chicken and sauce directly to the vegatables after about 5 minutes.  I then made the rice that took about 15 mintues which gave the vegatables time to cook and the chicken time to heat up.  It was a quick and delicous dinner.

My family loved this chicken stir fry. My teens said that they'd want it again. I didn't have all of the vegetables listed so I cleaned our the fridge. I used broccoli, yellow squash, carrots, frozen chopped onion that I had, and a handful of frozen green beans. I used 2 boiled bags of success Jasmine rice that I happened to have. I didn't have fresh ginger, so I sprinkled some ground ginger in the marinade. It was so easy for a yummy weeknight meal. I will definitly make it again!

I only used about 1/4 of the sauce to marinade the chicken in since I'm too paranoid about cooking it after it's been sitting in raw chicken.  Followed recipe to the tee and it was great.  I used some snow peas and threw in some peanuts after it was done cooking.  Nixed the chestnuts the 2nd time around, just using broccoli, peppers and snow peas.  Could use any combo you have on hand I think though.  Awesome.

Great stir-fry recipe! It is very easy to make this your own recipe by substituting tofu for chicken, altering the  fresh veggies you have available or spicing it up with some chili oil. I like to leave out the water chestnuts and add some bok choy. Excellent flavor, thanks for sharing this.

I am so glad I found this recipe, because it is like getting great take-out from my favorite Chinese restaurant. Like other people mentioned, I also varied with other veggies, using what I already had, but I stuck to the recipe for the sauce and the chicken. Wow! You need to do a movie theme night with this one- watch a good Asian movie.

This is a great basic stir fry!  Quick and easy!  I like to add sriracha to the marinade for a kick, add red bell pepper instead of green and top with crunchy chow mein noodles.

The only changes I made was I used only 1/4 of a cup of reduced sodium soy sauce and used red, yellow and orange mini peppers. After I had all the marinade in the bowl, I added a few more dashes of the soy since it didn't seem to be enough. Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out really good. Next time I might go ahead and use all the soy sauce called for and up the brown sugar. Excellent recipe. I know my man is going to love it when he gets home tonight. Thank you for the recipe!

Our 15-month old granddaughter has a nut allergy so I omitted the sesame oil. We prefer fresh mushrooms, and omitted bell pepper, reduced red pepper flakes. We all enjoyed this dish. She's really experimenting with solid foods and the tastes and textures were very appealing to her.

I only used half of the amount of sugar. My husband doesn't care for sweet dishes and my system can't handle to much sugar. Also used liquid amigos instead of soy sauce for gluten sensitive. Did learn to only marinade for only 15 min, left for 45. Flavor to salty and gingerly in the chicken only. Used frozen stir fry veggie from Costco Mexico. I will definitely prepare it again.

This has become a go-to recipe in my house. Even my picky 12-year-old loved it!  I cheated a little and used frozen stir fry veggies but the marinade totally made up for it. Coupled with some of my homemade egg rolls, ordering out for Chinese is becoming a thing of the past!

I cut the soya sauce in half and added teriyaki marinade sauce for the other half - taste amazing.  Also thin sliced a carrot and rough chopped asparagus that I had in the fridge.

This was great. I only used this for the chicken, because I was lazy and used a frozen bag of stir fry veggies already prepared. I did use some of the sauce for the chicken to flavor the veggies, and it did great. It seemed like a Bulgoki recipe modified for chicken, family loved it.

Ive made this recipe several times. As soy sauce can be salty and hubby and I are watching our blood pressure, I made the marinade with 1/4 c low sodium soy sauce added to 11/4 c water along with the cornstarch, 1/2 tsp ground ginger, 1/2 tsp garlic powder and 1/3 c brown sugar. For vegetables I used carrots broccoli snap peas red pepper and red onions, which made a beautiful dish. I have also made with frozen stir fry vegetables. Followed directions for cooking but made brown rice.  Family loves this dish.

This was very flavorful just how it is. Without session oil, you should prob pass on this recipe. Added onion, broccoli, green pepper, edamame, and zucchini as veggies. Just pretty much whatever we had in the fridge.

The changes i made were due to ingredients on hand. I used powered ginger, use less, i know that now, i had frozen stir fry mix from aldi's, i think the seasonings it came with may have put off flavour a bit. It was good otherwise, once on plate a dash of soy sauce and drizzle of hoisen sauce kicked it up a notch.

The amount of soy sauce looks atrociously high, so I used 1/3 c instead, but ended up adding some to the finished stir fry and so probably wasn‚Äôt too far short and it wasn‚Äôt too salty!I used a bit more red pepper flakes, 1/2 tsp and it was perfect for us, my family loved this. Will be my go-to chicken stir fry from now on.

First, I used garlic oil instead of sesame oil.  All other directions followed. I found it saccharine due to the marinade.  I would reduce corn starch and brown sugar, and add a little extra red pepper.  It was tasty but did not remind me of "stir-fry."

Scored big points with this one! It will definitely be in the dinner rotation.
I'll cut back on the soy sauce next to cut down on the saltiness and use cooking sherry to make up the difference.

Very simple yet satisfying chicken stir fry recipe that you can play around with.  I marinated the chicken for a few hours, used a wok to even the heat, and used a bunch of sugar snap peas.
This was a hit in my house and will definitely do again (maybe with pork next time).

Great recipe! Tasted like takeout! If you don‚Äôt like spice then skip the red pepper flakes.  I skipped the carrots and did mushrooms and canned baby corn.  Highly highly recommend this recipe! This will be a go-to favorite for me!

Was easy to make and great flavor I was expecting.  I didn't have all the vegetables and the flavor of the recipe is so easy to just add your own or extra to it.  I used Chinese egg noodles as well, and rice on the side.  Was a big hit with all my kids and hubby.

Skipped the rice, left out the brown sugar, added a bunch more chicken.  It was delicious and probably a lot less carbs and sugar.  I'm sure the original recipe is just as good.

The very first... and I've tried! ... Chinese recipe I've made at home that came out as good as "from the restaurant."  Didn't have Sesame oil, so I used 1/2 Olive Oil and 1/2 butter, and I changed up some of the veggies - but just YUM!  I will make this again.

This was a great recipe. I used a frozen Asian vegetable collection and 2 boneless chicken breasts to make this. The seasonings were perfect. I have made it twice since then and it remains a favorite  with  no changes to this recipe.

Instead of soy sauce, i used coco aminos. The recipe was amazing, and i did add seasoning to taste because my family doesn't like plain chicken. I used corn, onion, green beans and carrots for the vegetables and it turned out perfectly.

Followed recipe, but only used 1/2 cup soy sauce and ground ginger, since that's all I had on hand.  For more flavor,  I stirred in a tbsn of oyster sauce. I also used a bag of frozen stir fry starter veggies. Delicious.

Great dish that is quick and easy to make. I did use a frozen pack of stir fry veggies which made it even easier. Just needed to cook the frozen veggies for a few more min than instructed. I also used a sprinkle of tony chacheres seasoning on the veggies. Everything else I followed the recipe. I found it helpful that one of the reviewers (PacificViking) pointed out "to use a Dark Chinese Soy which is a lot less saltier than a Japanese soy or a light soy sauce :)" My Family Loved it!

This was very good. I would've added less soy sauce as it was a bit salty tasting for myself.  Also, when adding the marinade to the chicken and vegetables, I would've spooned it in and taste it before adding more. I added the entire amount.

The stir fry sauce (marinade) was excellent.
I recommend using fresh vegetables instead of frozen.  The frozen veg tends to incorporate too much moisture and takes away some of the density of the sauce.
Everyone loved it.

Made it for the guys and gals at the fire station.  Used boneless chicken thighs instead of breast and doubled the recipe.  Also, I added baby corn to the vegetables.  I thought the dish was going to be salty but the brown sugar & red pepper flakes evened out the flavors.  So tasty, we saved the recipe in our pantry as a go to meal.  Thanks.

I gave it two stars because the flavor was great but the sauce was to dark for me. I think next time I‚Äôll try chicken broth in place of soy sauce.

This is very flavorful! Will definitely make again! I cut my chicken breasts into cubes. Marinated for 8 hours. Chicken came out moist and very tasty! Added frozen snap pea stir fry and extra water chestnuts.

This was easy, fairly quick, and yummy. Husband and kids loved it. I didn't have any fresh ginger so I used ginger powder.  Skinless and boneless chicken thighs. Also didn't have any broccoli, used onion, pepper and carrots.

After reading reviews, I was aware of the salt.. I tasted the marinate before I added it to my wok. I used low salt soy sauce and it wasn‚Äôt salty  to me and I‚Äôm very salt conscious. I followed the recipe except  I added snow peas. I also added a little  cayenne for heat.  My family loved it. I will make it again. I also added a yellow bell pepper.  I think you can use vegetables of your choosing.

This is so easy, and so flavorful. I‚Äôve made it on weeknights, on weekends, on date nights, and for Sunday evening meal prep for the week. It‚Äôs my go to stir fry, and you can make it any variation of veggies and meat you want. I‚Äôve tried this with pork, beef, and chicken. They have all turned out fantastic. The sizzle and smells make you feel like you‚Äôre at a hibachi grill. All around phenomenal recipe exactly as its written.

2nd time I made this I added pineapple pieces and the juice from that went into the marinade.  I omit the water chestnuts,  as we just don't like them.  This was easy and very good.  From adults to grandkids,  everyone liked it.

Best recipe I have ever used!  I did cheat a little by using frozen stir fry vegetables but all the rest was as written.  Some reviewers mentioned it was very salty but we did not notice that so much.  Maybe I was just lucky with the soy sauce I chose.

I substituted chopped asparagus for broccoli, I did not use carrots or water chestnuts.  I used red pepper matchsticks, onions also.  Flavors melded well.
***The wok I cooked the vegetables and meat in one a caked on mess.  The microplanned ginger and minced garlic stuck to the pan and some burned.  
I‚Äôll make again, but soak the chicken in the marinade WITHOUT the corn starch.  After marinade I‚Äôll pat dry the chicken pieces and then coat in the cornstarch.  I really prefer the crispiness of this method.
Overall the flavors were good

It was excellent!!  At first I thought it would be a bit dry however was not.  Great flavor - the ginger was mild but strong at the same time.  I also added mushrooms to the stir fry.

Nice dish but the soy sauce was a little bit too strong for our taste. Next time we will reduce the amount and maybe try to add some oyster sauce to compensate.

This was a very tasty dish. I added more pepper flakes & I added mushrooms & it came out very well. I will make this again.

This is a go-to favorite for my family and I've returned to it many times.  Sometimes I use chicken, other times beef.  the great thing is that you can use veggies on hand.  Love the crushed pepper flakes but I skip the ginger - it's just not our taste.

Unfortunately this was inedible as it was way too salty.  I tried to salvage it by turning it into fried rice and adding a couple  eggs but even then there was too much salt.

Careful with that Soy Sauce!!!  If you are using the normal Soy Sauce,   which is very salty, use no more than 1/3 cup in the marinade.  Otherwise, as some of the other reviewers have complained about, it will be so salty that you can't taste any of the other flavors.  Be careful!!!

Awesome recipe. I did this on my Blackstone griddle. I saved  marinade and poured it in a skillet and cooked it on top of the stove to use as a topper for the stirfry and rice. Great recipe.   You can select your own vegetables but I did use broccoli and carrots and onions as well as mushrooms.  I doubled the marinate the second time as infelt it needed more at the end.

Very good flavor and easy to make - just took a bit of coordination.  Makes a lot of food; make sure you use a big enough pan. Plenty for dinner and leftovers for a few more meals.

I used a fresh, small serrano chili instead of red pepper flakes. Gave it a nice - but not overwhelming - bit of heat.

Will be making this again!

I doubled the recipe for our family of 11. I used fresh onion and green peppers and 2 bags of frozen Asian blend vegetables. It was pretty good, but could have packed a bit more punch, maybe more pepper next time.

My husband and I LOVE this recipe!  I have looked for recipes to use the pheasant that we have...and this is a perfect fit!  So flavorful!  I serve it with brown rice or a quinoa mix.  *I often let the poultry marinade in the fridge for a few hours if possible- awesome flavors!

Used a little less soy sauce because of "warnings"! However I could have used full amount because I used low sodium soy sauce. Followed the recipe and it was delicious, especially with Jasmine rice.

Easy and tasty. Everyone liked it. I did add a tablespoon of oyster sauce to the marinade to suit our tastes but I'm sure it would be fine without it.

I will definitely make this again.  I used a generous amount of bean sprouts and eliminated the red pepper( just not a fan of hot).  Instructions were perfect so that the vegetables were not to mushy and overcooked.  Served pineapple rings on the side.

I liked it. I added way more brown sugar than it was called for and sriracha instead of red pepper flakes, but I would definitely make it again!

This was really good! I changed the recipe a bit based on what I had on hand- I used ground ginger-1 tsp.- since I didn't have any fresh- a few extra sprinkles of red pepper flakes (we like spicy), some black pepper and cubed my chicken breasts instead of cutting into strips- 2 (I wanted bite size pieces). Then the vegetables I used were 2 carrots, 1 onion, head of broccoli, 3 summer squash, 1 lb. mushrooms (cut in half) and snow peas. I stir fried the carrots and onions first, then the broccoli, squash and mushrooms, then roved to a big bowl. I added the snow peas on top of the chicken that was almost done, then poured the marinade over, stirred and cooked about 3 minutes. I then topped all the vegetables that I had previously stir fried and removed to another bowl with the chicken-snow pea and sauce mixture, stirred all together and served over brown rice. It would have been good with water chestnuts and bamboo shoots if I would have had any as well as green pepper. I would definitely make this again- I  will buy fresh ginger root for sure next time, but the ground ginger was good in a pinch. Husband loves it too!

I used zoodles, mushrooms, onions and snap peas. The snap peas didn't get cooked, so I won't do that again. Otherwise, the flavor was decent.

This was delicious! We substituted ground flaxseed, a little water, and a pinch of all-purpose flour for the cornstarch. It turned out amazing, and I highly recommend adding whatever veggies you have. We went with peas, diced orange pepper, and some steamed broccoli.

Too salty for me as written and I LIKE salt. The only reason I didn‚Äôt trash it was because luckily I had some canned pineapple that I added so that balanced the saltiness out for me. I would make it again though but with low sodium soy sauce and more red pepper flakes. Otherwise the flavor is good.

I liked the recipe the way it is and all I did was to add green beans.  Gave it a little more crunch.  The whole dish was delicious. Will make it again.

Really easy and great! Delish leftover! I didn‚Äôt have all of the ingredients but used what I had and still perfect. I made the marinade and used a 1/4 cup for to marinade the chicken and saved the rest for the sauce to include in the stir fry at the end.

Great recipe, I added red peppers fried eggs and red onions instead of white. Also fried rice with some oil, teriyaki sauce and oyster sauce before adding the chicken and vegetables back into the rice. Will definitely make it again.

I made this for the first time last night, and everyone who ate it was impressed! The marinade is really yummy, though it did need a little extra salt and pepper since it was a little blander than I anticipated (I used low sodium soy sauce). Really good and will make it again!

I made a few minor adjustments with the spices.We like spicy sweet, so more red pepper flakes and pineapple chunks were added. I also like simple as possible, so I use a frozen bag of stir fry veggies. As long as they're not overcooked they are great.

We just finished dinner and all three of us loved it.  Tastes just like take out but better.  Not nearly as much salt/soy sauce so you could actually taste the ginger, sesame oil, veggies.  I only deviated from the recipe a little by cooking with a little extra vegetable oil, adding some unsalted roasted peanuts at the end, only about a teaspoon of the sesame oil and no water chestnuts.  I will be making this again for sure.  Thanks for the great recipe.

It was easy and tasted perfect! I had to change a few things, due to what I had on hand but it tasted so good I'm gonna make it exactly as directed next week. Oh, all 3 kids (14,12 and 2) ate 2nds and 3rds, that's hasn't happened at dinner in ages. Winner!

I followed the recipe except for I used half of the soy sauce (because of other reviewers stating that it was too salty) and I omitted the chestnuts because I am not a huge fan of them and didn‚Äôt think my son would like them. The stir fry was delicious.  Although I think the ginger overpowered the dish, I would rather have more flavor and spice than bland. Sesame oil is the key to this dish. I would recommend not substituting the oil.

The soy sauce was too salty.  Perhaps diluting soy sauce with chicken broth might remedy this.  If it wasn't so salty,  we would have thoroughly enjoyed it.

Best recipe yet states my family. Made exactly as written the first time. Delicious!! The second time, I bought a large bottle of low-sodium soy sauce at the 99c store, and tossed in a bunch of various veggies that I had on hand. We liked the low-sodium a little better with the leftovers. Full sodium soy sauce was fine when it was just cooked and served, but later it was too salty. I don't know the chemistry of it, but sitting in the fridge then reheating apparently had something to do with it. Anyway, it's now our go-to stir-fry recipe. :)

i do not really know if you need the brown sugar.  the onions and peppers and rice release their own sugars when cooked to a certain point.  my opinion though.  unless you really like sugary things..add it

Very Good. Definitely going in my repertoire. I would suggest, feel free to play with the veggies to suit your taste. Substituted zucchini for watercress but otherwise followed the recipe to the end.

This was sooooooo good!  I used only about 1/3 cup of low sodium soy sauce, but kept all other marinade/sauce ingredients the same.  For veggies, I used an onion, a bunch of broccolini, snow peas, baby corn, a few mini peppers, a handful of baby portabellos.  It was so ridiculously delish!  I will definitely make this again, and often!

Very easy & delicious! I used less chicken, more veggies. Used 1/2C low sodium soy sauce, then after marinating the chicken, used only about 1/8-1/4C of the marinade for mixing with all the ingredients in the pan at the end since other cooks said it was too salty using all of the marinade.

Absolutely delicious!  Savory and sweet, melt in your mouth chicken!  I nearly followed the recipe, these are the modifications I made, intentionally and not:  I marinated the chicken for about 45 minutes while I prepped the vegetables and started the rice. My boyfriend and I love lots of garlic and ginger, so I doubled the garlic and tripled the ginger.  I forgot to add the garlic, ginger and chili flakes to the marinade, so I tossed them in the hot oil for a minute or so before I added the vegetables. And I subbed a couple dried chili pods for the flakes.  Next time I‚Äôll use flakes because it wasn‚Äôt spicy enough for either of us.  Like some other people, I added the vegetables back in with the cooked chicken to reheat.  I definitely will make this again!

This is the ONLY stir-fry recipe you need. Made it several times and will make it many more. The ginger is on the strong side, but you can easily adjust for your personal preference.  We love it!!

I used a lg red pepper, 1 onion, sliced mushrooms, 3 stalks celery, 2 carrots, bag of snow peas, water chestnuts, handful of cashews.  I drained the chicken in a colander over a bowl before throwing it in the wok. Used about 1/2 c. of the marinade and 1/2 c. unsalted chicken stock (could sub water) 1 T. cornstarch whisked in. I had to thin it out a bit with some of the chicken stock. It was really really good!  I'll definitely make it again.

I had some boneless skinless thighs as well, which worked ok but I think they take longer to cook so I had to make sure everything was done. Also I used the "vegetable stir fry" veggies in the package. After doing it second time, I decided I would enjoy it better with hand-selected veggies- carrot matchsticks, onion, red pepper, snow peas, and mushrooms for me. I'm not that crazy about the broccoli, at least not in large quantities. Added some cashews too.  Cooked the onion, pepper, garlic and water chestnuts a little first. I added the veggies to the chicken but next time will stir fry them separate and then add to chicken, so as to not overcook the veggies. Also, I pretty much always use reduced sodium soy sauce, as it is plenty salty for me. I noticed some others who reviewed said it was too salty, but that wasn't a problem for me. This was easy and good. I think the fresh garlic and ginger makes a big difference!  Have some extra soy sauce, or my preference, Kikkoman Teriyaki Marinade and Sauce to add on top.

This is a great recipe! After years of trying to make my own version of stir fry this one made my entire family happy and was so good that I wrote down the recipe for next time! I did choose to mix my rice with the chicken and vegetables and I would double the sauce if you are mixing the rice in. Overall a great dish!

This is by far the best chicken stir fry that I‚Äôve made, will double the recipe next time because it was such a huge hit. This will be a keeper in my recipe box.  

My additions were some leftover cooked fresh asparagus with pearl couscous and diced tomatoes. About 1 cup all total. It melded right in with the overall flavors

This is so good.  I cheat and use a bagged vegetable mix, complete with pea pods and water chestnuts.   Then the recipe is so quick and easy to assemble.  The only addition I made was a little Asian hot sauce.

After reading a number of reviews, I did cut back on the soy sauce to 1/3 cup and added more as I was cooking it. I also added mushrooms, celery and bean sprouts.

My husband is not a fan of stir-fry but he managed to back for a 2nd and 3rd helping. It was very tasty!

Usually we order out when we want asian food, but I wanted to try cooking it to see how it would be. I was not disappointed. 

I skipped the water chestnuts and added some red and yellow peppers, it turned out great! My daughter complained about the green peppers, so next time I will likely make it without them and just add more red and yellow. Not sure why she won't eat green peppers but the broccoli was no problem! :) 

I cooked the veggies a little longer than it said, maybe 15 minutes instead of 5. And when I mixed the chicken with the veggies I cooked it all for a few extra minutes as well. I also cooked and served rice separate, like it would be from take out. 

Oh, and I served it on top of some crunchy chow mein noodles, and I added a packet of regular soy sauce on top of the rice and noodles.

It was delicious! We don't usually have enough veggies in out diet, so this was a great way to get them. Love cooking from scratch with fresh ingredients!

Mine didn't come out looking like the picture - it had a much darker color - still tasted very good.  My husband who claims to not like chicken ate two plates of it.  I would suggest that you should use low salt soy if salt bothers you.

Edited to add - I also tried beef instead of chicken and it came out just as good.  I may have to try pork next!

This was a great starter recipe that I adapted to the ingredients I had and wanted to eat. I chose boneless, skinless chicken legs instead of breasts because they're moist and juicy. They were perfect for this recipe. I didn't think the amount of soy sauce made the dish too salty, but that's because I added some water to dilute the marinade, then added more water while it was cooking. I will make this again in the future.

I did add some crushed red pepper and cauliflower instead of carrots, but this was an awesome meal that my husband and I both really enjoyed. We will definitely be making it again. I marinated the meat for over an hour and it was so good. Highly recommend marinating your chicken longer.

Wonderful dinner!  I used basmati brown rice which took longer to cook therefore the vegetables weren't as crispy as I wanted.  Still was delicious and will make again! I used low sodium soy sauce and will add snap peas and maybe a few more vegetables.  The leftovers were just as delicious!

This is one of the best stir fry recipes I've tried...the family really enjoyed it! I used low sodium soya sauce as I know regular soya sauce is too salty. I served it on egg noodles, which really absorbed the flavour of the marinade.  Next time I may increase the ginger (since we do like our ginger). Definitely a winner!

I will likely make this dish again. Very salty which I like. I added a little honey to the marinade as well which gave it a nice flavor. Used olive oil instead of sesame due to an allergy in the family and it tasted fine! Didn't have red pepper flakes for the kick unfortunately but overall was delicious and a nice change of pace from the usual stuff I eat!

This recipe came out better than I expected and it was pretty easy.  I usually dont like cooking with soy sauce because its salty. So i used 1/3 cup chicken broth and 1/3 soy sauce in the mixture. Make sure you add the tablespoon of corn starch to help thicken  the mixture. Also, i did not have seasme oil so i used vegetable oil( it still tasted really good but maybe next time ill get the other oil). I made this dish with lo mein noodles that i got from marianos. It was really  easy , i boiled the noodles ,fried the noodles in oil nd left over mixture  from chicken. Very very good

Very good.  I followed the recipe exactly accept I let the cut up chicken marinate overnight because I ran out of time after doing the prep work.  The whole family enjoyed.  This is especially good for leftovers during busy weeks - just put it over some rice in a bowl and enjoy.

This is the go-to recipe I use for stir fry. I use lots of different proteins (chicken, tofu, steak). The only thing I don't use is the green peppers.

We really loved this! I sorta did my own version. I had leftover rotisserie chicken, which I marinated in the sauce and added at the very end, just to heat. I added baby corn and mushrooms as well. Really tasty! I definitely will be making this again!

It was tasty and easy to make.  The soya sauce made dish extremely salty, I need to find a substitution for this.  I will definitely make it again with the substitution so not as salty.  I used coconut oil instead of sesame oil which was a tasty twist.

Dish was very good.  Plenty of flavor.  I used low sodium soy sauce.  The only thing I might criticize is pulling the marinated chicken right from the fridge caused my wok to get cold.  Next time I'll pull the chicken out 15 minutes before cooking and I'll raise the heat before I put the chicken in.

This was a great recipe...I took the advice of others and cut back on the soy sauce.  I used half a cup of soy sauce and 1/4 cup water.  We loved it.

Excellent recipe. You can use whatever vegetables you want. I used baby corn, carrots, and broccoli for mine. Came out tasting delicious. Really good for meal prepping as it tastes good even after you've frozen it.

This is delicious. I make it often with whatever vegetables I have on hand. If using snow peas I wait until I have combined the chicken and other veggies and put the snow peas in last so they are crunchy. Keep in mind if you cook the vegetables first & let them sit they will cook more. So, if you like Al dente/crispy vegetables don't cook them too long or add them raw after you stir fry the chicken.

This was really good. If I cooked it again the only differences I would make would be to do no carrots cause they didn't get as tender as the rest of the veggies, a bit more ginger and garlic with the marinade because the soy sauce was the strongest flavor, and maybe a tad bit more chicken because the veggie to chicken ratio was a bit high, in my opinion.

So, so good. I had it over egg noodles, and it was perfect. The marinade is just right (I just guessed with the spices, but I was precise with the rest), and really made the chicken pop. The vegetables were absolutely delicious, and I would honestly make it with more vegetables next time, both in quantity and type (maybe add some snap peas?).

There is a downside: if you're looking for classic Chinese cuisine, this is decidedly NOT it. It's "Asian fusion", if you will, but it is delicious if you just let the food speak for itself.

This turned out pretty good!  My hubby really liked it, had seconds, so that tells me a lot.  Only changes I would make next time is to double the garlic (which I did this time, of course) and to saute the veggies and chicken on a bit lower heat.  Medium high heat with peanut oil burned pretty high. I also had to add more peanut oil to saute the amount of veggies and chicken I had.

It was delicious! Tender chicken and perfect veggies. Re only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is b/c it was a bit on the salty side. Next time I will use low would soy sauce.

I add whatever veggies I have available. I also usually cut down the soy sauce to about 2/3 soy sauce and 1/3 water - it's pretty salty otherwise. This is so yummy.

I cut back on the soy sauce per other comments then saw how little sauce that made compared to the excess veggies I added, so I added more and it turned out great. I did use low sodium soy sauce. I thought this was great. My husband gave it 3 stars.

I made this recipe exactly as stated and it was fabulous!  Even my husband, who is a notoriously  "plain" eater, loved it!  I only use low sodium soy sauce so, while it was a bit salty, it wasn't overwhelmingly so.  Overall, both my husband and myself thought it was a winner and will use this recipe again in the future!

Simple and quick...  TASTY!

Next time... PEANUTS! That would have taken this to next level of goodness!

Substitution: 1/3 cup soy instead of the 2/3 cup recipe calls for. Used onions, mushrooms, grn. pepper, carrots and fresh broccoli for veggies.

I added frozen, shelled edamame and cashews to increase the protein without so much chicken breasts. I also used sliced leeks instead of onions. The sauce was too salty; next time, I would reduce the soy sauce by half so the other flavors aren't overwhelmed. I would also use hot oil in addition to the sesame oil, and/or more chili pepper.

This was a great recipe.  I added mushrooms and used red, orange and yellow bell pepper strips instead of green ones.  I didn't use low sodium soy sauce but I will next time, since my family thought it was just a little too salty, but they still ate every bite.

I just wanted to update my review.  I used only 1/3 cup of low sodium soy sauce and the saltiness was just right.  For more moisture I added 1/3 cup chicken broth.

I stir fry often, and I was looking for a good combination of seasoning, and a good technique. I found both in this recipe. I found that cooking the veggies and the meat separately, and combining at the end, kept the veggies nice and crisp. The seasonings were perfect. Ginger, garlic, soy, brown sugar and red pepper! My only suggestion is to consider using low sodium soy sauce and keep about 1/2 cup water to add as needed if the sauce gets too thick. The sauce as prepared was just a bit too salty for us.

I used low sodium soy sauce and still I thought it was too salty. I would reduce the soy sauce next time.

So.... if you really like salt, this recipe has you dialled right in.

If I were to make it again, I would reduce the soy sauce from 2/3 cup to 1/8 cup, and replace with chicken broth.

So good! I used 1/4 tsp ground ginger instead of fresh ginger and a seasoned pork tenderloin instead of chicken, as well some slightly different vegetables. The flavor was great!

I have been making this every other week. I'll add in water chestnuts, bamboo shoots, mushrooms and snap peas as well. Such a tasty way to get a ton of veggies! I marinade the chicken separately and add the reserve on at the end.... I don't find it too salty at all.... But I also add a ton more veggies and the marinade is just enough to flavor all of it.

I'll definitely make this again. I had extra chicken (plus I like to have plenty of sauce for stir fry), so I doubled the sauce. I ran low on soy sauce, however, so made up the difference with hoisin. I *also* (this is what happens when you just pick a recipe on the spur of the moment instead of planning ahead of time) was out of red pepper flakes, so substituted a couple of chopped up dried Thai chilis. It turned out *great* - albeit not quite as spicy as I might have liked because I was afraid to go too crazy with the chilis.

I used regular (not low sodium) Kikkoman and did not find it overly salty at all.

Definitely on my keepers list!

Yes, I also added two tablespoons of ketchup, 1/2 C chicken broth, and 1 extra teaspoon of cornstarch to the marinade for the chicken.  I sprinkled sesame oil lightly over the vegetables as they cooked. I did not add the water chestnuts as we don't care for them.  My husband and I loved this recipe.

I don't regularly cook, so it took me a while to prepare. But it came out delicious! Now that I know how to do it, I think it will be a quick meal to make in the future.

I love this stir-fry and make it a couple of times a month. The sauce is just wonderful and all the veggies make it something I'm happy to serve my family. I made this for my parents and they were in heaven! I usually serve over soba noodles (tossed with sesame oil and soy sauce) instead of rice. The sauce/marinade works great with pork as well.

good recipe, however the marinade simply uses too much soy sauce. you cant save it because the raw chicken was in it, but using the amount the recipe says makes it way too salty (not to mention brown and gooey). Next time im going to skip the marinade all together and simply cook the chicken alongside the garlic and ginger and add my own amount of soy sauce separately. that way the vegetables stay green and crisp and youre not wasting any soy sauce.

Double the marinade recipe part. We like a little more sauce since we add a bunch of different vegetables that the recipe doesn't call for...we also don't use as much crushed red pepper as our kids don't like spicy..

We had friends in yesterday evening and I made this but instead of adding a thickener I fried my small pieces. I rolled each piece in flour and fried in veg oil. It went over so well with our guests. Thank you.

Really surprised at how the flavors in this all came together and were more powerful than expected.  We added some sliced baby bella mushrooms but other than than we followed it exactly. The picture really doesn't do the dish justice in my opinion. Will definitely make again!

I will definitely make this again. As others suggested, I used Chinese Soy Sauce (Lite) and it was not too salty.  The fresh ginger added a lot of flavor.  The only thing that I added was  2 tablespoons of sweet chili sauce.  Very easy recipe and much better than the stir fry sauce that you get in a bottle!

It needed more hot pepper; I initially put in twice what was called for, and then after a taste-test, I put in about twice that again.  I think I'll also use more ginger and broccoli next time.  Otherwise, this is great.

I made this with just a couple of minor changes- I only used 1/3 cup of reduced-sodium soy sauce instead of 2/3 cup soy sauce in the chicken marinade, and the veggies I used were broccoli, mushrooms, snow peas, shredded carrots, red bell pepper, and green onion. I also threw in some cashews. It was outstanding! I'm not a "salt" person- I am sensitive to overly-salted food- which is why I used reduced-sodium soy sauce and only used half of the amount called for in the recipe. It came out just fine, not too salty, and despite using a smaller volume of liquid in the sauce, it came out perfect. The corn starch definitely helps to thicken it so it clings to the chicken and veggies, so if you have some on hand, don't skip this step.

I try to make recipes as-written the first time. This was too salty for me, and I'm someone who loooves salt. I would still make it again and just adjust the soy sauce.

My whole family loved this recipe! The sesame oil is key it makes it! As for salty I did it exactly the way it says and it was perfect. I did a few small changes  I didn't have fresh ginger so I used ground and I didn't have broccoli or water chestnuts so I didn't put any in which I'm sure would make it even better. I was looking for a recipe that was different and fun to do with chicken and I scored a keeper with this one YUM

Really good. I used 12 boneless, skinless chicken thighs and got incredibly tender meat! Thighs seem to stay moister and  can tolerate a little overcooking.  Doubled the sauce (but not the sugar in the sauce) and used a bag of frozen Costco stir fry veggies. Great flavor, just enough spice, and the whole family loved it! This will become a regular recipe in my dinner rotation.

I've made this a couple times now and its been a big hit in this house.  I modified the recipe by using just a little less Braggs (which is saltier than soy) instead of soy sauce and more broccoli, maybe more carrots too.  Works well with both breast meat or thighs, depending on your preference.

This was excellent. My husband, who is not a "stir fry" kinda guy, loved it and said we should have it at least once a month!

I made it according to the recipe, but I think next time I may cut the brown sugar in half, because it was just a bit too sweet for my taste. But still delicious!

Family loved it.  We've found that the prep times are always way off for us since we the food prep (cutting veggies) takes us longer than iron chefs.  We're gonna prep a bunch of stuff for the week on Sundays so these will be faster to make.

Super  easy and tasty.  It was a little too much ginger for me but I used a ground ginger from a tube so it may have been more concentrated.   I also would cut back a bit on the amount of soy sauce!  Easy first stir fry for my Hubby to learn with though!

This recipe was way too salty, we didn't enjoy it at all. I would use half the amount of soya sauce next time (sodium free if you have it). It could have used some fresh herbs as well (cilantro would probably go well).

My family which consists of 3 adult  males, plus the chef (me) loved this recipe.  So it's definitely a keeper.  The only thing I did differently was add a few more vegetables into the mix .  I added fresh mushrooms, fresh peapods, and canned bamboo shoots.  I would have also added canned water chestnuts too, but my husband couldn't find it at the store.  I didn't increase my sauce with the addition of these items . Instead of white rice, I used rice a roni chicken flavored rice. I did want to mention, that it took me 1 1/2  - 2 hours to complete the dish.  It's definitely not a quickie recipe.

liked that it was a little sweet and a little hot.  Took the advice of other reviewers and used only 1/4 low sodium soy sauce.  I used regular instead of sesame oil due to an allergy.  I used shrimp instead of chicken and it was delicious.  I used red instead of green pepper and added mushrooms.  Next time might try to get closer to the Japanese steak house recipe we love and do zucchini, onion and bean sprouts only.  Will double the sauce next time.  Very very good and will definitely make again.

Solid recipe... tasty but a little sweet for my taste.  The family loved though.

I had sushi ginger leftover from some takeout so I used that instead of minced ginger.  Seemed to work well but may have contributed to the sweetness.  

Will try again with less brown sugar...

So I made this but I did make some changes. I found it last minute and didn't have time to marinade the chicken. I used the veggies I had on hand which were broccoli, cauliflower, zucchini, and onion- all fresh. I pan fried the boneless skinless chicken breast strips seasoned with mrs.dash tabletop seasoning in a bit of extra virgin olive oil vs the sesame oil which I'm not a huge fan of. After the chicken was done, in the same pan I added a little oil if needed and sauted the veggies. I did add a little water at one point too. The sauce- I didn't really care for it as written; soy was a little overpowering. I added a cpl more tblsp of brown sugar, another good squeeze of the ginger and the garlic and added onion powder as well. When veggies were almost done cooking, I added cooked chicken back in and drizzled sauce over it and let warm for 2-3 min. Family absolutely loved it! So while the original sauce was rather blah, with some tweaks, it was very good. It was  good starting point for sure!

I used reduced-sodium soy sauce but it was still too salty. So much so that it had a slight metallic aftertaste. I will say that the chicken was very tender, but there are better recipes.

I also added snow peas.  I used low sodium soy sauce and instead of rice, added udon noodles at the end of cooking and actually added another quarter recipe of sauce.  My family thought the flavors were great and will make variation of this recipe again.  The ability to change it to specific likes of vegetables and spiciness makes it work for many tastes.

Great recipe. I followed it exactly as far as measurements. I made a few substitutions, using chicken tenderloins since then are thinner, and added fresh pineapple. The marinade was the best part, although next time I would back off on the red pepper, it was a little too spicy for my wife.

Very good recipe as written.  I made the following modifications based on my love of vegetables:
Added
1 white onion large cubed
1 cup snap peas
1 cup bok choy
because of the extra veggies, I increased the corn starch 1.5 tablespoons an it worked out perfect.

Next time I will follow other reviewers recommendations and use low sodium soy as this was salty without the rice.

I used different veggies, sugar snap peas, sliced bell pepper & onions was all I had on hand.  Although I used low sodium soy sauce, it was a little salty for me, but my husband loved it.  I will definitely make it again & will experiment with the vegetables!

This recipe was perfect! I did not make any changes to the ingredients other than use brown rice instead of white rice. I let the chicken marinate for about 10-11 hours while I was at work. I was a little worried that it would be too salty, but it was not. I used frozen Asian stir-fry vegetables instead of fresh veggies. I cooked the brown rice the day before. The recipe was super easy and just as delicious!! This one is definitely a keeper! I look forward to making it again and adding different meats. Thanks for sharing this recipe!

This is a great recipe.  Having said that, I doubled the ginger and garlic, added whole fresh basil leaves, about a half cup, and used Braggs Aminos in place of soy to keep it gluten free.  It is a family favorite.
I double it every time and use a bit extra, then save some for next time or for other uses.

This was a great recipe. It was easy to make and it really is tasty. My family really enjoyed the spiciness too. Next time I make it however, I will marinade the chicken at least 30 minutes as I felt 15 wasn't long enough for the chicken to absorb the marinade. Thanks for sharing!

Last night I have tried this recipe, and I have followed it word by word (except a little less garlic than it is called for) and it was one of the most delicious chicken stir fries I have ever made and tasted... Even my picky husband loved it and told me to not let the boys have the leftovers, because he will have it for dinner tonight :))) Thanks Katie for this great recipe... I will make it quite often I would think...

On recommendation from a previous review I added 1/4 tsp of Chinese 5 spice to get more of an Asian flavour.   I used what I had on hand for veggies, cauliflower, carrots, celery, green beans, 3 different peppers, onion and low sodium soya sauce.  We loved it!  Will make again.

I didn't read many reviews so this may be a repeat. For me, this dish was too salty. If there is such a thing as low sodium soy sauce, I will try that next time.  Other than that, flavor was nice.

Way too salty. Next time I do this will use the dark soy sauce that was recommended or add a little water to tone it down.

Delicious as is or an excellent base for customizing your own stir-fry.  I typically use frozen stir-fry veggies to make an already simple recipe even easier.

I always make the rice the night before: saves plenty of time the next day. Rice takes only 17 minutes if you take white rice (brown rice takes longer to cook) , saut√© in 1 tbsp butter for each cup of rice till it smells toasty ( not browned ) then  add twice as much water as rice, stick in casserole dish for 17 minutes in oven. Leave on lid for 10 minutes afterwards. Perfect every time.

I follow the rest of the recipe as written, but  tweaking garlic and ginger to taste Delicious!

This was a great recipe. I did use less  gluten free soy sauce called Tamari. I also added a tablespoon of hoisin sauce as my husband loves it. We used broccoli, carrots, mushrooms, garlic, onion and water chestnuts. We will make it again.

I've tried many stir fry recipes, but I keep coming back to this one! It's simple and it's tasty. I usually make it with frozen vegetables, but other than that, I make this recipe exactly as directed and it has never steered me wrong!

Excellent. I didn't have fresh ginger, so I used 1/2 tsp of ground ginger. The sauce is really good, but next time I'm not going to put so much of the sauce on the rice.

We like spicy food so I increases the red pepper to 1/2 teaspoon. Also used reduced salt soy sauce. Left everything else the same. Very good.

Swapped red pepper flakes for sriracha. Next time I will use less soy and maybe add some water- too salty. Also, I just used a frozen stir-fry mix.

Omg Amazing!  I used beef stir fry meat instead of chicken, and a bag of frozen left over veggies from a veggie tray I had made before.  Added some colorful bell peppers and mushrooms!  I made rice in my rice cooker.  This was fun and my whole family loved it.  I served with corn tortillas I made with sour cream on the side.  Huge hit!  Thank you for these recipes???

Nice flavor, but WAY TOO MUCH SOY SAUCE.  Suggest replacing half (or more) of the soy sauce with water.

Everyone liked it. I didn't get raves from the family but they all ate it (no left-overs) I am extremely handicap when it comes to cooking anything Asian- I don't know why, I just don't stand a chance next to Chinese take-out. Oh well- I thought the flavor was excellent! Great recipe!

I really like this. I made it as it says, however I used chicken thighs (one costco package, about 4 boneless pieces). to marinate I added probably half of the sauce (until I saw it covered the chicken, the other half I have put it in the freezer for next time :) I let it stand in the freezer for about 25min. 
Loved the results super tender thighs and the veggies were delicious (I used the frozen stir fry mixed veggies) and I topped my dish with fresh cabbage. super tasty!

We really liked it. We used rice noodles (soaked for 90 mins and then finished off in the wok) and I cut the soy. Used coconut sugar (Carmelites) instead of brown sugar- really good!

I sweated some onions with celery at first, and blanched & shocked broccoli and julienne carrots. I seared the chicken to caramelize the surface sugar, which I feel is key. After chicken I seared all the veg, which cooked quickly. I deglazed the pan with a cup of beer and reduced it before adding the marinade to simmer, then returned all to pan. Great recipe, it is one I will keep. I made it twice already ?
Thanks!

I made this last night and I definitely agree with emilio_linda. This did not taste like an asian dish it was sweet and salty. I would recommend using only half a cup of soy sauce since I had a lot of sauce left over and it was pretty salty. Overall it was an okay dish. However it did taste good with a lot of rice, about a 1 to 5 ratio.

I always seem to mess up stir frys, either the veggies turn out too mushy, or the chicken doesn't have enough flavour. These instructions resulted in a perfectly prepared stir fry. The chicken pieces were flavourful all the way through, and the veggies still had a slight crunch to them. The flavour was satisfying. I used toasted sesame oil because I love the rich flavour. For veggies I used Daikon radish, peas, corn, asparagus, and purple onion.

Fantastic recipe! Thank you for posting. I made only two changes, the first was in the marinade: I used 1/3 Cup Teriyaki sauce and 1/3 Cup low sodium soy sauce.  I did NOT find this recipe to be too salty at all. Second, I omitted carrots and used zucchini and mushrooms.

PS: Make sure you use sesame seed oil! The aroma and flavor are very important to this dish.

Very good recipe. I don't cook oriental food very often at all. I followed pretty close to the recipe other than using canola since I didn't have sesame oil. 
Yes it was salty.. Oriental food IS salty.. I've had much more salty meals at an actual restaurant than this recipe. 
This isn't rocket science.. If you think it's too salty, add more water and cut potatoes to soak it up.  
Experienced cooks know these things. 
Anyway I was impressed that the little marinate time was very adequate for the taste..
Very good recipe that we all liked very much

Chicken was very tender and the sauce was excellent. I had it on Quinoa which was very good.

I put in some water to the marinade for chicken to cut down on salt.   We used carrots,  brocolli,  mushrooms,  onion and water chestnuts.  Wife doesn't like anything hot so minus the red pepper did everything else exact.

I've tried to make stri-fry before and never liked the outcome. But this...THIS I will make again! Marinating the chicken for an hour or so really gave it great flavor. I didn't have fresh ginger or garlic on hand, so I just sprinkled in some ground ginger and garlic powder. Still good. And I used a bag of frozen asian veggies. Next time: I will use freshly grated ginger and garlic. I will also use fresh veggies. Oh and lower sodium soy sauce (it was a bit salty!) But a keeper!

Excellent flavor.  Used broccoli, no water chestnuts.  I didn't have sesame oil so it was just olive oil.  The result was very good.

Giving it a second try...the first time was delicious but I am tweaking it a little this go round.  
We are using reduced sodium soy sauce (the first batch was a little salty).  Also we are going to skip the second Tbs of sesame oil when the chicken goes in (las time the pan was too hot and we created quite a mess).  
When we first made this over the weekend we did not realize it feeds six...we added bean sprouts, snap peas and mushrooms...all of it wouldn't fit in the pan, so we saved half the veggies to use for an even quicker weekday meal.  
Hoping this time is as good as the last!

Boy was this salty!!  I would cut down on the soy sauce and add some chicken broth for more moisture.  I think 1/3 c soy sauce would be more than adequate. I also used a bag of frozen stir fry veggies and 1/2 an onion.

Chicken is much tastier in a stir-fry when cooked the following way: coat raw chicken pieces with flour, salt & pepper  and stir- fry in hot sesame oil. Garlic and ginger are tastier when saut√©ed briefly in warm oil rather than sitting in a marinade.

Read all the complainants about too much sodium.  What did you expect people.  Have none of you used soy sauce prior?   I used Braggs Amino Acids instead of soy sauce.  I use Braggs to replace soy sauce due to the high sodium content in all my recipes.  This recipe was excellent.  I would prefer more sauce, so maybe I will double extra next time.

Realized after cutting up stuff for stir fry that I didn't have the sauce packet i usually use, so I found this recipe for the sauce. The sauce was really good and easy, no more packet for me! My other ingredients were pretty much the same as the recipe. Came out great.

We just used broccoli and pea snaps. Kids loved it. No left overs. I didn't add the red pepper (for the kid's sake), but did add Sriracha sauce on my bowl! good eats!

very tasty but as others have said, very salty. Will definitely track down low sodium soy sauce next time. Added a handful of red peppers to make it spicy and it worked out great.

OMG this is so good!  I will be making this again and again.  The only changes I made were using 1 tsp. of ground ginger in place of the  1 TBS. of fresh ginger because I didn't have any fresh ginger.  I also omitted the water chestnuts, yeah you guessed it I didn't have any but will next time I make this wonderful dish.  I also added one small zucchini finely sliced just to use it since I only had one left.  I don't like spicy food that is to hot but the 1/4 tsp. of red pepper flakes was perfect with just a hint of hot.  I served our stir fry on a bed of white rice but it would be equally good on a bed of cooked noodles or pasta.  I love that this recipe is so forgiving if your out of one or two ingredients and that you can add pretty much any vegetable your family favors and it will still turn out perfect.  Next time I'm adding some snow peas to mine and maybe even some cauliflower as well.  Thanks for sharing such a delicious, fast and easy to fix meal recipe.  Don't be afraid to experiment with vegetables your family likes best.  This is a keeper in my book.

I did make a few changes because I had a lot of different vegetables I needed to use...cauliflower, celery, cabbage, and boc choy., with the veggies called for in the recipe. The marinade was delicious although I cut some of the sugar, I don't like anything too sweet. It was fabulous and my husband had seconds. That's a very rare occasion.

The sauce is definitely much better than bottled sauces!  I did as someone else suggested and cut back on the soy sauce, topped of the 2/3 c with water and a couple of tablespoons of rice wine vinegar.

After trying several stir fry recipes, this is a favorite.
I followed the recipe as is, but added about 2 tablespoons of rice vinegar to the marinade to cut the sweetness. I also used sodium reduced soya sauce.
I used frozen mixed vegetables, which worked fine in this recipe. However, my stir fry looked nothing like the picture, mine was extremely dark in color due to the soya sauce, but still very tasty.This recipe is a keeper.

Way too salty with all that soy sauce, it became hard to eat after the first few bites, and an hour later we're still drinking water to get rid of the saltiness in our mouths. Beyond the saltiness, there wasn't much flavor in the chicken. The soy sauce just took over the entire dish. Even the broccoli was inedible with all the soy sauce. I might make it again, but it would be with half the amount of soy sauce. As is it was hard to finish eating it.

This is a good meal to make, tastes great and is healthy albeit a little too involved with the prep of all the ingredients. 
I used La Choy soy sauce which made the meal EXTREMELY salty.  I was dying for glasses of water after eating this.

I scaled down to 1/3 of the marinade based on the smaller amount of meat used. (I chose pork this time). Added my usual broccoli, carrot, celery, bell pepper, onion, added some chopped green onion at the end.  Fantastic. Hubs & I both loved it.

Way too salty for me (and I don't skimp on salt) but I will make it again using low sodium soy sauce. I made it mostly as per the recipe. I didn't have bell peppers so used celery instead. I keep chunks (about 1/2 inch square) of ginger in the freezer and zap in the microwave for 20 seconds as I need them and then just squeeze the juice into recipes that call for ginger - so much easier.  I sprinkled chopped peanuts on top.

I used the exact amount of soy sauce (teryiaki, actually), powdered ginger (1 heaping tsp) and the red pepper; also added some garlic powder. I made LOTS of veggies, including both red and green peppers, baby corn, water chestnuts, bamboo shoots, bean sprouts, broccoli, carrots, onions. It was absolutely delicious and perfectly seasoned. Served it over brown jasmine rice. It will be a standard now in my repertoire!

I have made a  lot of stir frys in my day and this is the best recipe ever. I made it for my friends and we all fell in love with it. The only change I  made was that I used Jasmine rice. If you have never tried Jasmine rice it is so aromatic and pairs very well with this dish. Great recipe

I made the sauce exactly as called for (except I used ground ginger - 1tsp = 1 TBSP fresh).  I used regular soy sauce and it wasn't too salty for me...and I hate salty stuff.  It was great!  My husband doesn't like green peppers or chestnuts...I used mushrooms and carrots.  You can use almost any veggie you like. This is very versatile.  And I love that I didn't have to own a wok.  My pots worked just as well. This is a keeper!

I have also made this with thinly sliced beef and pork.   I only use 1/2 tablespoon of chopped ginger because to our taste it is over powering with a full tablespoon. We're not that big on ginger anyway. All in all this is a very good recipe.

This was delicious! I did substitute thin sliced beef for chicken. I used all fresh veggies, meat and served over rice. It felt like a very healthy recipe.

The stir fry was delicious.  When I was mixing the marinade I was thinking it would taste too much like soya but I was pleasantly surprised when the meal was complete and we tried it out.  A nice mixture of flavours!  This is the best stir fry I have made to date.  delicious

Delish and will make again! I substituted pure maple sugar for the brown sugar, added mushrooms and cashews and changed up some of the other veggies. Sauce is awesome!

I made this recipe for the sauce. It was very good. A nice stir fry taste. I made it with noodles instead of rice as I usually do with stir fries. And added my own flavour of veggies. Delish.

I doubled the water chestnuts--im a huge fan, added 1/2 the bell pepper as I don't like bell peppers, but followed the rest to a tea! I really didn't like the bland rice!!

This tasted awesome.  I would have added some more red pepper flakes, as my husband likes things a little more spicy, but other than that it was very, very good!

This was good and nice and easy to make. I would decrease the soy sauce amount to 1/2 cup as it was quite salty (even my kids felt it was too salty). But will make again...

I made this tonight, and as some reviewers suggested, I used low sodium soy sauce and added more red chili flakes because we like spicy food (1/2 teaspoon total). I also added a tablespoon of peanut butter and a tablespoon of honey to the sauce (since I read in the reviews that the recipe was so salty), and an 8-oz package of sliced mushrooms to the veggies. I served it over brown rice. The sauce tasted A LOT like the sauce that comes on Sweet & Spicy Beef and Broccoli from a Chinese takeout restaurant, only better! It was pretty good and a nice change, but a little rich for our taste. I'll try it again without the peanut butter and honey.

I liked it and so did my husband and son.   I doubled the meat and there was still enough of the marinade to toss in a ton of veggies and more chicken if you want.  They eat a lot of protein in my family so I need a lot of meat! I will definitely make this again.
After reading some of the reviews about the saltiness I thought I would add that I just added more vegetables and it was delicious.  I think the amount of soy sauce listed is a lot,  and you can make a way larger meal out of this recipe than they indicate. You can always add less soy sauce. I personally could have used more ginger!

We have made it several times for supper and the family loves it-even the picky ones!
I make it pretty much exactly according to the recipe, no need for change. For my plate I like to add some sriracha hot sauce.

I made this last night and it was sooo good. I did not have water chestnuts, peppers or fresh ginger but I used ground ginger, broccoli, carrots, and white onion.  I  used low sodium soy sauce. I just ate it without rice and  liked it so much that I doubt I will be getting takeout Chinese much in the future. Yum!

This was pretty good!  I didn't have ginger on hand so I added an asian spice mix I had and it was delish!  Next time I will reserve some of the marinade before adding it to the raw chicken, so I have some extra to add when cooking so its a bit more saucy.  I bought a container of white sticky rice at the local chinese restaurant. YUM!

This is a good recipe! I've made it a couple of times. I made it with soy sauce alternative coconut-aminos (Coconut Secret brand) and threw in pea pods, mushrooms, bean sprouts and waterchestnuts. The 2nd time I made it, I doubled the sauce because I typically add a lot more vegetables than called for. Next time I will cut the red pepper flakes in half only because our family likes some spice but this was a tad on the too-much side for us. Great recipe! I served with brown rice.

Very good stir fry! I have made this about three or four times and always get so many compliments! I always leave out the pepper flakes and it is still delicious! Even if you choose to leave out the water chestnuts (still good), and I always replaced with snap peas which were very tasty in the sauce. But this recipe is a more then a bit messy and can be a bit time consuming. I find it best when there are two people in the kitchen helping to sort everything.

I made a few changes, first, I did 4 chicken breasts and then instead of fresh ginger, i did dry, and it turned out tasting fine! Next, I substituted the vegetables with 1 can of Chopped Suey Vegetables but I kept the onions in there. Also, after i cooked the vegetables in the skillet, I cooked the chicken with the marinade and it turned out perfectly fine (this was actually an accident!)!
Overall, this recipe is very good! I am definitely making it again!

This has become a family favorite for us. We add bamboo shoots and baby corn for more veggies. We've served it over brown, white, and basmati rice, and it's pretty good on all of them. We've always used low-sodium soy sauce and never found this recipe to be too salty. There are always plenty of leftovers and it reheats well.

My husband asks for this over and over again. He loves it. The only thing I do different is I use 2 bags of frozen stir fry veggies instead of fresh (so much easier)! I also use ground ginger in place of fresh ginger. Will continue to make this!

Nice stir fry meal. I used broccoli, carrots and mushrooms as vegetables and served over bown rice. The only change to the recipe I made was using some vegetable oil with the sesame oil. I think sesame oil is not one of the cooking oils that can  be used for high heat.

This came out so delicious! I had to fight the urge for seconds (though I was already full!) I will say that I used this quickly with a time constraint so I "cheated" and used frozen veggies but it came out great anyway. Definitely using fresh next time and I know it will come out just as fantastic if not more so!

This one was too salty to describe, and after marinating and cooking in a sauce with 2/3 cup of soy sauce it doesn't look anything like the picture....everything comes out dark brown.........brutal......don't waste your time and effort!

I was down to my last 1/2 cup of soy sauce, so topped up with water.  Other than that, I made no changes to the marinade.  For the veggies, I used onion, broccoli, sweet red pepper, bok choy and mushrooms.  Will definitely make this again.

I had broccoli, sugar snap peas and carrots on hand for veggies. This recipe is quick and easy with a very flavorful sauce. All of my children loved it.....which is really saying  something ;) I will definitely add it to our monthly menu.

I made 1/2 as much sauce because of soy and husbands dietary constraints. Added some chicken broth to make up for liquid. He loved it.   I said well I finally got one right!  For veggies I just used carrot, onion, and green pepper.  The veggies were awesome.  I had used the ginger in the squeeze bottle found at Walmart in produce dept.  So handy and convenient. Never without.

It was okay.  I like how the chicken and vegetables turned out, nice and tender, but I did not care for the sauce.  The sauce just seems to be off for some reason.  I might try experimenting with a little Mirin and a little garlic next time.  I know that would be more like a teriyaki sauce

I did not use water chestnuts, because I hate them, but I did use snow peas.

This is probably the yummiest stir fry I've ever had. We added a few hot peppers to kick it up. It came out a little too salty at first so my fiance added some maple syrup to balance it out. Very enjoyable!

Incredibly high in salt due to the soy sauce. I would try and find a substitute for soy sauce before I made this recipe again.  Otherwise it was quite tasty.

I used different veggies with the broccoli and carrots I added cabbage roughly chopped and celery. I also used low sodium soy sauce and brown rice. It was delicious! You could really add whatever you wanted to it to customize. I was making it , and my husband popped in unexpectedly from work and said; "whatever you're cooking smells amazing!" Then he had to have some on the spot, and loved it!

This recipe is perfect!

Instead of bell peppers and water chestnuts, I put mushrooms (I honestly just use whatever veggies we have available). There's nothing I would change. Thank you for giving my family a special treat!! :)

Just made it.  Didn't use cornstarch because I love the flavor of the sauce but find it yucky when you reheat a sauce with cornstarch. I chunked the raw chicken, used onion, carrot, mushrooms, water-chestnuts and petite green beans and cooked as directed - only I didn't add the water-chestnuts and mushrooms until I put it all together.  Just simmered if for a minute or two after adding those two ingredients.  It  was quick and easy and had a nice flavor, even though the chicken only marinated for 15 minutes or so.  Very good!  Made it to take for lunch tomorrow and caught the husband eating out of the Tupperware bowl while I was washing the dishes!!

This was delicious and beautiful to look at. I used it as a base and adapted with what the family likes, what we had and what looked colorful. Marinade: We had no ginger so I used ground ginger (probably a teaspoon, maybe less). Veggies: broccoli, snap peas, carrots, a variety of colorful mini sweet bell peppers, boy choy and green onions (the last two cut lengthwise (larger) so easily avoidable by the kids). :-) Fearing that the soy sauce would be too salty and one-dimensional, I did not cook the chicken with all of the sauce. The sauce was a very good, though, and for extra flavor, once the veggies were added back in, I mixed in a couple of spoonfuls of kung pao sauce (prepared in jar) and squeezed all the lime I had (1/4 lime). I was surprised about how good it was! Thank you for the recipe!!

Way too salty with regular soy, but I added a tablespoon of lemon juice then more brown sugar till it was perfect for us. Also added a pre-mixed spicy Szechuan seasoning to liven up the flavors. We'll make it again but with much less soy!

Delicious!  My husband and I both really enjoyed this!  I made it exactly as directed with one very minor change -- I didn't have fresh ginger, so I used 1 tsp powdered ginger instead.  Perfect!

This recipe is great. I made it with shrimp that I had on hand. Uncooked shrimp. The sauce makes it great.

Excellent simple stir fry. Worked very well with pork and crushed crystallized ginger. Kids enjoyed it, and I'm looking forward to playing around with other ingredients.

This was great! If I was doing this just for me, I'd add a little harissa arbi (smoky harissa) paste as I found the 1/4 tsp chill flakes to be rather mild. I added quite a lot more veggies than what was called for an more variety. I used carrot, broccoli, snap peas, orange pepper, mini corn cob (fresh), mushrooms, and green onions. Because my veggies were of various textures I added them in this sequence so the softer ones wouldn't overcook before the harder ones were done. I used 1 quite large chicken breast and that was certainly enough for our taste. As an alternate to chicken (or in addition to) next time I might use peanuts or cashews. Overall definitely a keeper!

Very yummy. I make it with squash and green bell peppers, since I get an abundance from my garden. My husband loves the sauce. I would make it more often, but it's rather time consuming.

I cooked this recipe for lunch today.  I used reduced sodium soy sauce and a bag of frozen stir fry vegetables.  I also added onion.  I was very pleased with how it tasted.  My husband went back for seconds.  He almost never does that.

Great basic sauce recipe!  I agree with other reviewers - a little salty for my taste, next time I will use low sodium sauce.  It was also a bit too sweet for me, so I will probably reduce the brown sugar a bit.  I used different veggies, basically everything that was left in my CSA this week!  But I loved the sauce, I will definitely use it again!  Thanks!

Great recipe, the red pepper flakes give it a nice kick and the brown sugar a little sweetness.  I didn't have any cornstarch on hand, still delicious. Got great review from my husband!

This was by far the best stir fry I`ve ever made! I also added snow peas, bean sprouts (not till the end), napa cabbage and bok choy. Mine usually turns out mushy. The steps of this recipe keep the veggies from getting mushy.  Will defintely make it again!

This recipe works on many levels-it's quick, easy, uses stuff I have on hand & most importantly, it's tasty. Other reviews have noted it's too salty, but since I used low sodium soy sauce, it wasn't a problem. The only changes I made were using dried ginger instead of fresh & adding about a cup of chicken broth with a little added corn starch at the end to make more sauce. Definitely a keeper!

A fabulous stir fry. The best I've made. I marinated the chicken for 8 hours which is important. 15 minutes is too short.  Cooking time about 15 minutes. A great one pot meal.

The sauce on this is pot on for making a lovely tasty stir fry. The soy sauce can seem like it is to salty for some so just dilute with some hoisin or teriyaki. 
My dietary restrictions keep me from using sugar whenever possible. 3 packets of Splenda and 1/4 cup Agave gave it just the right touch. Again dietary restrictions kept me from eating the rice  so I used spaghetti squash in place. Family loved it!! Will use again many time over. Thank You. Sorry I had to "tweek" a bit. I try not to because it isn`t fair to the original recipe but I think I did ok. Thanks again.

This recipe is sooo good! Based on others comments, I did use 1/3 cup low sodium chicken broth and 1/3 cup soy sauce. For my personal preferences, I added a red bell pepper (love the color and flavor), and doubled the garlic. Everything else was done as per the recipe. Outstanding! Thanks for sharing!  :-)

Pretty good! I substituted mushrooms for the peppers but that's the only change I made to the ingredients. I used only enough marinade to cover chicken then reserved the rest which I added in later. My husband said it was a keeper! It is salty but I love salty. If the salt is an issue, I would recommend using a little to marinate and a little to stir fry with then having remaining available to serve on the side (heated through). The ginger was yummy!

First, I read over the recipe looking to head problems off before cooking. I knew I would be using reduced sodium soy sauce because I learned 50 years ago that yummy soy sauce causes me to swell up. I was so pleased when the lower sodium version was introduced. I bumped up the Asian flavor by adding a teaspoonful of sesame oil.  Using "dark" soy sauce is a great alternative if you can find it in your neighborhood food store.(Oh how I wish I had a local Asian market) otherwise, read the nutrition labels and cook wisely. Next, use your gut feeling. If it seems a little "wrong " for your taste, listen to what your gut is telling you, and plan your recipe adjustments before you buy the chicken!!!
Good luck to all, and enjoy this wonderful dish. P.S. I also use brown rice.

I know this recipe is already good--but has anyone tried leaving out the brown sugar? I'm not a fan of sweet-sour anything, so I will omit it next time.  I'll also utilize some modifications made by other reviewers.  This should be a 5-star recipe anyway!

All I can say is...WOW! This recipe is awesome! I doubled it and used low sodium soy sauce. It was perfect in sweet and spice.  My picky daughters had two plates each! I just added an additional 1/4 cup of brown sugar to the doubled recipe. I was afraid that it would be too salty, otherwise, but nope. Definitely a keeper!

I am so happy to have used this recipe. I made a delicious stir fry with it. My husband and I both enjoyed it. The main change I made was to add more water and cornstarch in the end so that we would have more sauce.

My husband and I both loved this recipe.  I changed it a little, however.  I used cooked pulled chicken instead of marinated raw chicken, and added the soy sauce mixture directly to the cooked veggies.  I omitted the 1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes because I thought it gave it too much zip.  I also used different veggies.

We really liked this! I steamed a frozen bag of veggies then added some red bell pepper, but I could have added more veggies to this. The marinade was delicious, the fresh ginger really makes the flavor, I think. This is going to be my go-to stir fry recipe from now on.

The taste was good.  Not near enough sauce.  I added 2/3 c white wine and increased the cornstarch to 2 tablespoons and it was better.  Still not much sauce. It didn't turn out yellow

i used this recipe as a base for the simple stir fry i wanted to make for dinner.. i left out the sugar and cut the marinade in half except for the red pepper flakes.. i used a combo of chicken breast and pork (1lb total) and fried everything in canola oil instead of the sesame oil.. i added it at the end (to taste).. for the veggies i used green bell pepper, carrots, celery, cabbage, mushrooms, onion and zucchini.. while cooking the veggies i added about half a cup of chicken broth (made out of bouillon) but i think i could have gone with a quarter cup.. ty for the inspiration

Way to much soy sauce, and the sesame oil flavour is overpowering. I'd rather go for peanut oil.

This was pretty good. Made as is except substituted a couple different veggies.  As with most Chinese recipes, there are so many ingredients that they really aren't too quick or easy. Once you're cooking, it is, but with all the prep...that's a different story!  (Let's just say don't try to do this, crab rangoons and spring rolls on the same night if you don't have 3 helpers!). I would do this again, though.

This is a great, simple recipe that is perfect for busy nights. It is quick to throw together and very tasty. I omitted the carrots and used mushrooms instead and also used a yellow bell pepper instead of green since that's what we had on hand. The sauce to this recipe is fantastic and versatile enough to be used with any type of meat and veggies. We did use low sodium soy sauce, it would have been overly salty with standard.

This dish was pretty good....pretty pretty pretty good. I do have to say though, it was pretty salty even though I used low sodium soy sauce. Thank goodness I didnt use the original version. I probably could have done part Braggs aminos. I would also say that the marinade/sauce seemed to be missing jut a tiny but of something that I can't put my finger on... But I'm inexperienced with "asian" cuisine. I used Thai style stir fry veggies  from the freezer and added some fresh chopped baby bok choy and it was delicious!  Marinating the meat was also an excellent touch. I'd make it again and try tweaking the sauce to my liking. If anything, the dish smelled and looked amazing, so I cant give it lower than a 4.

Great flavor. Even the 3 and 7 year old children loved this. I made extensive shortcuts to make it even faster for a weeknight meal. Made sauce as directed but added it right into a bag of Tyson fajita meat chicken strips and put in the fridge all day. When it was time to cook I added the chicken to 2 bags store brand stir fry veggies and cooked on med/high for 6-7 minutes. Wow, a dinner can't get any easier than that! I had to add about a 1/2 c water for more sauce probably because the amount of meat/veggies I had. Will now be part of our dinner rotation. Thank you for the recipe. We all very much enjoyed it.

This is a great recipe!  I used baby bella mushrooms, onions and asparagus along with the chicken.  We enjoyed it with veggie birds nests from Trader Joe's.  Yummy dinner!

The Hubby and I loved this stir fry! It was not salty at all, I used low sodium soy sauce and followed the recipe, not changing anything other than adding a few other veggies. This will be something I cook again and again.

Absolutely fantastic! It took me considerably more than the suggested time, but that's just because I am not used to cooking for more than one person-and even when I cook for myself, I still take a while! I used the Publix Brand Kale and Red Chard Stir Fry as well as a bag of peas and carrots from Walmart for veggies, and increased the amount of ingredients for everything, and it came out really well, especially for my first time. Will definitely do this again!

This recipe was WONDERFUL! My partner and I aren't professional cooks and I've been getting more and more adventurous in the kitchen. We halved the portion sizes in this recipe and it worked out very well. Keep them coming!

My family really enjoyed it, but I did make a couple of adjustments to suit our tastes. Only about 1tsp of the ginger and 1/2 the soy sauce and 1/2 the red pepper flakes. Will definitely make again!

Pretty darn good! I didn't have water chestnuts and chose not to put in the red pepper flakes.. But followed the rest of the recipe. Oh and I used shredded carrots.  But it tasted good.

This was absolutely delicious! I didn't even have all the ingredients, plus I have picky eaters (didn't have ginger and water chestnuts, and only added a bit of pepper flakes b/c of the kids). I did use low sodium soy sauce. This was easy and truly delicious!!!

I found it very bland.  I did the stir frying in peanut oil and then just added sesame while cooking.  The sauce tasted like a good base sauce, but seemed to be missing something.

This Stir fry was so good! I was surprised to learn how easy it was to make the sauce. I added fresh green beans to the recipe. Next time I think I'll use soba noodles and add some asparagus.

I would strongly suggest that you don't cook with sesame oil. It has a very low smoke point. I substituted vegetable oil, and tossed with sesame oil just before serving.

This was very mild. Next time I will double (at least) the red pepper. I have also heard that cooking sambal oelek for one minute in the oil before adding other ingredients is a good way to add heat without overpowering the other flavors, so I might try this if I can find it.

I'd consider this recipe to serve eight, not six.

We loved it. Simple, tasty, and I haven't even cleaned up the kitchen yet but had to review and give it a two thumbs up. The only regret is that I didn't make more for leftovers.

Really good recipe. I used splenda brown sugar to cut down on calories and brown rice instead of white rice.  Really tasty! It was a little more sweet than I like; I may use a little less brown sugar next time and add something to make it more spicy.

I liked it. I was glad to eat lots of vegetables for once. It's hard to describe the taste. Kind of light but flavorful. Just try it out and then adjust it to your liking. I think it's a good starter recipe for Chinese food.  My chicken tastes a little bit overcooked, but that's my fault because I cut it up into small pieces. Veggies taste great.

Enjoyed this recipe very much -- thanks, Katie KS! As others have noted, you can easily customize it to whatever protein/veggies you have on hand. The real star is the sauce. However, I reduced the soy sauce to 1/2 cup and I still think it was a little too salty -- even with my reduced-sodium soy sauce (but I also didn't have enough rice.)
UPDATE: I made it again, this time adding some oyster sauce and Sriacha sauce. This made the sauce even more complex and added some spice as well. I let the chicken marinate for about 45 minutes and also added some edamame and roasted corn (from Whole Foods salad bar). Excellent!!!

My husband loved this dish - better than takeout!  I used  a low sodium soy sauce and veggies I had on hand and a pre-seasoned the chicken with a green cilantro and scotch bonnet peppers for a bit more spice.  Didn't use rice but noodles to make almost a chicken chow mien Thanks for sharing!

Maybe swap the water chestnuts for cashews if that is your thing. Either way this recipe was basically spot on. Don't let all the liquid make you overcook (my daughter wanted me to cook longer), it thickens right up and comes out perfectly!

I Love this recipe! I used  Frozen Vegetables and  added baby corn. I used 1\3 lite soy sauce instead of the 2/3 the recipe called for. I will be making it again. It was a big hit??

This is a great little recipe if you are looking for something quick and easily adjustable to use what you have on hand.   I had an abundance of sugar snap peas in the garden that I used instead of the broccoli, and used red peppers instead of green ‚Äì personal preference.  Be sure to use low sodium soy sauce, otherwise it will be way too salty.

This was delicious! I added two tablespoons of Hoison Sauce (available in groceries like Giant) for added flavor, and used low sodium soy sauce to cut the salty taste. I also added zucchini and sugar snap peas to the veggies and they turned out great. Definitely a keeper!

Loved this recipe!  Made the sauce as instructed, but reduced the soy sauce to 1/2 cup, and the brown sugar to about 1/8 cup and added some sesame seeds for extra flavor.  I used lots of extra veggies, including bok choy, cauliflower, red cabbage and asparagus.  It was a great meal, and very healthy with whole grain brown rice.

Excellent as is, though the sugary marinade mix leaves the bottom of the pan sticky... So I used a few Tbsp of sake to deglaze. Perfection!

My family and I thought this was very good!  For those who are concerned with the sodium content try switching to low sodium soy sauce.  That's what I used and it turned out perfectly!

Very simple, forgiving recipe. Feel free to customize to your liking. I added some mushrooms and more broccoli and carrots because I love them, and cooked them slightly longer to soften them up a bit. I tapered back on the soy sauce, but added Worcestershire and rice wine vinegar. Served over shredded cabbage, kale, spinach instead of rice. Yum. I recommend marinating longer maybe 2 hours.

This recipe was excellent. I picked it because it was simpler/had less ingredients than a lot of other stir-fry recipes I've seen. The only differences I made was using low sodium soy sauce, and reducing the amount to 1/2 cup based on previous reviews that warned of it being too salty. I also just used a bag of fresh stir-fry vegetables from the grocery store instead of the vegetables listed in the recipe to save time. Overall this was a tasty and easy recipe and I plan to add it to our dinner rotation.

We enjoyed this enough to search my browser history for the recipe again a month later.  From preference we use low sodium soy and venison instead of chicken, we also opted for frozen stir fry veggies... But those are really minor changes to a solid flavor profile!

My first attempt at making a stir fry and it turned out to be delicious.

I agree that making it your own with a few small changes is a good idea.  I used a bit more garlic, ginger and red pepper than was called for and it turned out just as I'd hoped.

This was top notch.  Me and the wife loved it.  I'd probably add a little more of the red pepper flakes next time because I like heat but the recipe was very tasty as is.

Tasty but way too salty, next time I'll cut the soy sauce in half and add water or low sodium chicken broth.   I did use low sodium soy, and the saltiness was still over powering, but the recipe had potential.

This is awesome!  Thanks for the recipe. I used a mix of coconut aminos and Brag's Liquid Aminos because that's all I had in the house.  I cut the brown sugar by a tablespoon or so, and I double the veggies.  The veggies I used were: broccoli, onions, baby portobello mushrooms, celery and red peppers.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!  I love the use of ginger.  This is just what I was looking for.  Tons of flavor and pretty healthy.  My fiance loved it!

Just made this tonight, used low sodium soy sauce instead of regular to cut down on salt. Used 2 bags of frozen stirfry veggies. Tasted great. put a 1/2 teaspoon redpepper flakes instead of 1/4. My mistake just a bit to hot.But think this is a great recipe.

Only used the recipe for the marinade.  After marinating chicken, cooked chicken first, then added desired vegetables, sauce, and served over rice.  Good base marinade - quick and tasty!

This recipe was amazing.  Easy and great tasting.  I used Costco frozen chicken breasts and Costco frozen mixed veggies.  It was easy peasy.

Spicy hot, husband loved it and I ate a little (because I have to steer clear of the Soy salt overload).  I doubled the marinade, doubled the chicken, added snow peas, mushrooms, a can of baby corn and thinly sliced cabbage.  Will be great as a meal for a family gathering. Will make again.

This turned out nicely. I cut the amount of soy sauce to 1/2 cup.  Used a mix of chicken breast and lean pork. Substituted 2 tbs flour in absence of the cornstarch.  Could adjust the veggies to taste for a variety of likes.  Will try it again.

My husband took one bite and said "this tastes like something from a restaurant!"  Nailed it!  I loved that it was rather saucy and called for lots of chicken.  I replaced the water chestnuts, which I didn't have, with shredded cabbage, which needed to be used up.  Excellent!  Will definitely make this again.  Thanks!

I like it. It was a great quick meal but i think it needs a bit of tweaking to kick it up to next level. I did add Chinese parsley, and sesame seeds. But i agree with the other comment that it still needs more Asian flavor. Next time I will try adding oyster sauce. And I'm second guessing the cornstarch.

We also used frozen stir0fry veggies just because we had them but also added fresh broccoli & peas fro our garden. I thought the sauce was very flavourful and a good consistency, I just wish there was more of it! Great recipe this will become one of our staples for sure!

Minor modifications after reading reviews:  Used 1/3 C of Dark Soy Sauce (found it at an India Market) and 1/3 C Vegetable Broth.  Deleted: broccoli and green pepper.  Substituted: Pea Pods, carrots, baby corns.  Will add more crushed red pepper next time.  I added a picture because mine did not look anything like the original photo posted.  Yum!

I followed directions except I cooked the chicken breasts whole in the marinade...removed chicken from pan to slice.  Added chicken and marinade to the vegetables I chose...cabbage, green onion, bean sprouts, green pepper, mushrooms, broccoli, carrots, &water chestnuts.  Flavorful dish!

This recipe was very flavourful.  However did cut back on soya sauce.  Used half table spoonful peanut sauce along with sesame sauce for cooking veggies  
Will add snow peas next time.

I'd give this 6 stars if I could.  My family loved this!  I made a few minor changes based on what was in my house (because I don't plan ahead).  I used fresh stir fry veggies, vegetable oil, and powdered ginger. Because of my family's preferences, I halved the soy sauce and replaced the remaining 1/3 cup with chicken broth for the marinade.  After the ingredients were cooked, I whisked and heated the leftover marinade to thicken and used it for sauce - yum!

Any lean meat works.  I like to add a little bouillon broth and loads of veggies!  Zucchini, yellow squash, snap peas, and mushrooms are all fair game.  Also experiment with a dash of Dale's steak seasoning or Road Kill Grill.  Enjoy!

This stir-fry was very tasty, however, I did find that it was too salty. Next time I will use 1/2 of the soya sauce that it called for (only 1/3 cup instead of 2/3 cup).

Very good recipe.  The sauce was a little thick so I added about a 1/2 to 3/4 cup of water to thin the sauce. and reduce the strong salty flavor.   It worked perfectly.  I used the veggies I had on hand; onion, carrots and snap peas.  I also added about a teaspoon of hot chili garlic sauce for an extra kick.  I will make again.

I made this last night and loved it but I altered it a bit.  I agree that it was very salty so next time I will reduce the amount of soy sauce which won't be a problem because the recipe makes plenty of marinade.  I added extra ginger, garlic and a bit of cooking sherry.  For vegetables I used onion, red and yellow peppers, zucchini, sugar peas and oyster mushrooms.  I'm tired of carrots and broccoli!  I will definitely make this again.  Thanks

I liked it a lot.  I am saving this rcipe.  My 13 yo daughter thought it was a little salty even after I added about 1 cup of water to make extra sauce.  I can only imagine what it would have been like without the water.  Other than that....I don't think it needs any ajustment.  I did use frozen vggies...which cut down the prep time and would also do that again.  Great base for stir fry and extremely easy.

My kids are extremely picky eaters but they really liked this! I used noodles instead of rice to entice them but the sauce is so yummy that they ate most of the vegetables and the chicken without even thinking about it. I will definitely make this again!

The only thing I added was a bit of lime juice. My husband said it was the best stir-fry I had ever made.

The thing I love about stir fry recipes is you can use whatever veggies you have on hand...  Which I did... I didn't think it was very salty, however I NEVER EVER buy regular soy sauce ONLY the low salt kind. I accidentally used too much cornstarch so it was gumming up when I was cooking the chicken, so I added water to the reserved stuff (further reducing the salt)... My husband nearly choked because he couldn't get it to his mouth fast enough. He told me he would eat that every day for the rest of his life if he could~ I'm vegetarian but this also makes for an AWESOME meatless dish when leaving the chicken out!~ GREAT JOB! Thank you for sharing...

Coming from a guy who rarely cooks meals from scratch (AKA I had very little idea what I was doing) this recipe was awesome. Super simple and tasty. I used green peppers, carrots, chestnuts, and green beans. Also instead of 2/3 cup of soy sauce, I used 1/3 soy sauce and 1/3 teriyaki. My roommate who loves stir fry told me it was near-perfect.

I had 12 people for dinner and they all enjoyed the stir fry... you can double the sauce... just enough when you add to chopped up and cooked chicken.

Nice versatile stir fry recipe.  I used 1.5 lb of boneless thighs rather than breasts, substituted about 1/4 cup of mirin for some of the soy sauce, and omitted the red pepper flakes - we used Sriracha as a table condiment for the adults.  Otherwise followed as written  Really nice, family friendly meal, it got wiped out completely.  I'll bet it would also work with beef, but maybe use cumin instead of ginger in that case?

Quite a nice blend of spicy/sweet.  Not too overpowering on either side.  Added zucchini and mushrooms....meal was a hit.

Loved it! Was told it tasted just as good as our favorite Chinese restaurant's similar dish. I'm glad I bothered to get the fresh ginger...that made it extra delicious!

This was the most successful stir-fry I have ever made. BUT IT WAS WAAYYY TOO SALTY! I added mixed frozen vegetables and omitted the pepper flakes. Next time I will dilute the soy sauce with water and I'm sure it will be much better! I will be making this again per my husband's request!

I've been searching for a better chicken stir fry and this was a hit for my bf and his friend. We all loved the kick of the ginger and pepper. I used some flour cuz I didn't have corn starch. I'll make this again.

I am. Making this for the 2nd time, everyone loved it the first time, I did cut the soy sauce down to a little less than 1/4cup. I make it using, carrots,a yellow and a red pepper,all cut in toothpick cuts.  Snap peas ,celery,green onions,and a can of sliced water chestnuts(as we love them). Last time had it with lo mien  noodles, this time with rice.

Very good. Loved the sauce but cut the soy a bit and added water. I also used sriracha as I did not have red pepper flakes.

My husband and I really liked this recipe! I didn't have any ginger or green pepper, and I used about triple the amount of garlic, and it tasted great. I'll definitely make this again sometime!

Absolutely loved this recipe! I had never made stir-fry before so I was looking for something simple yet delicious. I followed the recipe exactly (except I omitted water chestnuts because I'm not a fan of them and added snap peas). The outcome was better than I expected! I'll definitely make it again. Some reviewers said it was too salty, but I suggest using low-sodium soy sauce. You won't be disappointed!

This made a delicious stir-fry. I didnt use carrots, broccoli, or the water chestnuts (although the chestnuts would have been an awesome addition), but I did add mushrooms, zucchini and squash and then all the same ingredients listed.. I used regular olive oil, and added sesame seeds in the middle and at the end.. SO SO GOOD!! Im definitely making this again

I really loved this recipe!  I did make some changes only b/c I didn't have the stuff on hand (garlic, red pepper flakes and fresh ginger) I used my own veggies and did everything else in the recipe - LOVED the sauce, that is the best part - my husband didn't even realise that it was chicken, he thought it was beef!! Thanks.

Delicious! Just the right amount of sauce too. I sprinkled the veggies with granulated garlic powder and onion powder just after I added them to the frypan. I will definitely make this again.
