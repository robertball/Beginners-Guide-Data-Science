this is a very good drink, however, traditional lava flows do not have banana. i add a good amount of ice, omit the banana and double the coconut cream and pineapple juice.

You are missing a key ingredient here, ICE!
All the ingredients should be blended with ice. Also I would reccomend removing the banana we had this drink in Maui and they did not add banana and it is tastier without.

I loved these in Maui.  Except I added ice, I used banana liquor, malibu rum and frozen strawberry puree!  So yummy!

I had these for the first time in Hawaii and thought they would be great for my luau themed party last weekend. I pre-made the strawberry mixture and put in a pitcher so I wouldn't be behind the bar all night. I think I made about 50 of these drinks. Very important, crush the pina colada mixture with ice.I couldn't find coconut creme, so I used coconut milk which was just fine. I love this summer drink.

We can't get the strawberry and rum mixture to be pasty. It is very runny. We tried adding some ice also, but that isn't working.

The ingredients sound very delicious here, but the result is a little ordinary. The cocktail is very thick. All I tasted was banana with coconut milk. Maybe the cocktail would be tastier without banana.

It was very thick. Was a really good idea and I was really looking forward to it but I didn't care for this.
