this was fantastic! so easy and delicious...i was astounded. i'm sure it'd be great with any snacks you have in the cupboard. it was a little sweet though, so i think next time i'll omit the candy corn and add pretzels or some other salty snack. thank you for the recipe!

5 stars for the fun alone! My daughter and her friend chose the candy for this and they picked Jr. Mints and Dots. They also mixed butterscotch and white choco chips together. They had a blast making it and it tastes pretty good too! Very clever name!

I really tried this recipe because of the name 8)  Everybody ended up loving the name AND the mix.  I did not use all the candy corn since it is not a favourite.  I threw in a handful of Red Hots (which everybody loved).  I also splurged and used "Jelly Belly" jelly beans since they are smaller and have a more intense flavor.  I will definitely be making this again.

This is such a versital and delicious recipe!  I recently hosted a Girls Night party and made some of this to go along with all the other snack foods we had.  This was completely gone!  It was gone before all the margaritas and sangria!  lol.  I made it with Chesters Puffcorn as it has no kernals and has the buttery flavor of movie theater popcorn and took the suggestion of another reviewer who used jelly belly jelly beans.  I liked them best for their flavor and size.  And then I added some reeces pieces.... DELICIOUS!!! :-)  Everyone is hooked and wanted this recipe.  LOVED the name too.  very clever :-)

Wow this was great fun.  I had my grand-girls (3&5) over for an activity afternoon and we made this super snack.  They laughed through the whole assembly.  I had no candy corn and subbed small pretzels.  This is a great base for using up all the dibs and dabs of holiday baking.  Everything will work as long as the balance between sweet and salty is right.  This one is on my permanent snack list!

This was great.  I admit-I made it based on the creative name alone.  I love it-how clever!  Anyhow, it's delicious.  It did get a bit meltly in the hot sun today-we all decided it would be great to eat as cereal with a spoon!  Yum.  The possibilities are endless-it's great you can just throw in whatever you have in the cupboard.  Thanks for a great and versatile recipe-2 (sticky) thumbs up!

Very easy, and pretty good.  Bf really likes this.  One thing the reviewer didn't say and is pretty important--pick out the popcorn seeds if you have any.  Of course, everyone else who makes this is probably going to remember, but I didn't, which makes for some interesting bites.  It didn't stop the bf, though.  I thought this was good, but it's sweet, so I don't like a lot at a time.  I left out the candy corn and am pretty sure it's so sweet bc of the white chocolate chips, which can be sickeningly sweet, so be careful with them.  This recipe uses the exact amount to allow for coating almost perfectly, so I wouldn't skimp, but it's something to be aware of.  Add more salty food like pretzels, etc if you would like more of a balance.  Thanks for the recipe!

I used one popped bag of PopSecret's Homestyle Popcorn in this recipe for the popped corn. Instead of jelly beans (we just don't care for them, I'm sorry), I threw in equal amounts Peanut Butter M&M's. I made no other changes. This reminds me of White Trash snack mix. We all LOVED this. Insane delicious. We seriously inhaled it. EXCELLENT movie snack mix.

This was such a fun and easy recipe.  You can throw any of your favorite candy in and it works.  I made it for a party for the Oscars and it was a hit.  My 18 year old daughter just made it for about 30 people at her work for a potluck and they loved it too!!  I bought a big "popcorn" plastic bucket at the dollar store to add to the look.  What a fun idea! Thank you!!

Yummy!  I made this today for a trial run before my son's Cub Scout party next week, and "Wow!"  I used the following ingredients to make it more kid-friendly:  popcorn, corn chips, tiny pretzel twists, mini M&Ms, dry-roasted peanuts, and gummy bears; in addition to the melted white chocolate chips.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I made this tonight and it was super simple! I don't like candy corn so I added Reese's Pieces. I can't wait to try other types of candy (dots are next). Don't skimp on the white chocolate chips, it is the prefect amount.

I also tried this because of the cute name!! My kiddos (7 & 9) LOVE it, oh, and me too! I followed the ingredients exactly. I used Ghirardelli white melting chocolate wafers. Mmmmmm! Next time gonna try it with M&Ms and Cinnamon Imperials. Thanks for such a great party snack!!

What fun this is!  Very easy and the options for personal preference are endless.  I used mini York Peppermint patties, mini Reeses, deluxe mixed nuts, and Jelly Belly fruits.  Very addicting.
