I didn't adjust this recipe much when I scaled this recipe back to three servings. I just used one can of tuna fish and cut the celery salt back by half. Instead of american cheese, I chose to use sharp cheddar. The boys split the third one in half. When I baked these, I baked them at 350* for 12 minutes. They LOVED these "sandwiches"--both of them want this again for lunch tomorrow.

Classic recipe with a really cute name! This is perfect for a quick lunch and definitely a favorite when I was a kid! Everyone has their own "signature way" of preparing tuna salad and like many others, I did tweak this a bit for 1 can of tuna using a little more mayo, less seasoning and onion.  I toasted my English muffin and didn't bother buttering it then layered the tuna salad and cheese putting the oven at 400 and waiting until the cheese was nice and bubbly!  I topped it with a tomato slice and a little cracked black pepper - delish!

A big hit with my husband but I had to crank the oven up to 350 to get the cheese melted and the sandwich heated through.

This is a great twist on tuna salad. My sometimes picky toddler even enjoyed it. I did add a few more tablespoons of mayonnaise to make it creamier. This will become a regular meal in our home.

My kids asked to have normal tuna fish after we made this.  There were far too many clashing flavors,  and it was very salty.

This recipe was so delicious! I made them in a toaster oven because it was way too hot and humid to turn on my oven. They turned out wonderful. I put the sliced tomato on first, then the cheese and toasted them. The taste was so good!

I loved this recipe! However I am not a fan of onion and garlic powder so omitted these two items when I created my tuna chessies. I did not have any English muffins on hand so I substituted two slices of 12 grain bread and it came out great. Next time I will try it with the English muffins. Thanks for a great recipe that I will definitely make again.

I first had these over 30 years ago when I lived in Maryland.  So easy and so good!  Great with a cup of soup on a rainy day.

Yum! Trust me, this is not just for the kiddies!! I skipped the celery salt as tuna has plenty of salt in it already and placed the sliced tomato on top of the cheddar cheese I used before broiling. So delicious and thanks for a great lunch!

We grew up eating these! The only thing we do differently is not add any yellow pepper to the tuna mixture, (though I'm gonna try that next time). Also, we just toast the english muffins in the toaster and top w/ the tuna mixture, a nice slice of tomato and a piece of cheese. Then we put it in a 350 degree oven until the cheese melts. This is a great spin on the classic tuna melt! :)

These were really good. I roasted red peppers on the grill And then added a bunch of spinach with the tomato on top with the other half of the muffin to make a sandwich. Definitely yummy.

Really yummy.  Threw in what I had, some oregano, garlic powder, and onion powder.  Used shredded sharp cheddar, put it under broiler till browned.  Definately a keeper.

Fabulous.  Love the ingredients you combined with the tuna.  My kids loved it.  I cheated and used the broiler, it melts the cheese and heats the tuna through in just a couple minutes.  Thanks for the great dish.

I have a son with Celiac so we didn't use English muffins (I can't get them gluten free here).  We used plain bagel halves (his was gluten free!) instead.  I did have to heat the oven to 350 and it did take a little longer (add about 4 min) but it gave us a meal we all enjoyed.  I served them with a green salad to help cut the "greasy" from the cheese and mayo.  Everyone Loved IT!!

Very wonderful. I simplified it a lot. Just mixed tuna, some spaghtti sauce and mayo, added to the muffin bases and then topped with red pepper, tomato and cheese. My six year old wolfed it down after complaining beforehand that sh doesn't like tuna or tomato! Excellent, easy and relatively healthy.

Thsi was pretty good. I cut the recipe in half & I am out of celery so I used a  tsp of celery seed. I also added a bit of Old Bay seasoning  (skipped the salt), used 3 big cloves of minced garlic for the powder & I also gave it a squeeze of lemon. Also, I don't know if the temp is right...200 degrees is hardly hot enough to melt the cheese. Certainly not gonna toast the english muffins in 3 minutes! LOL So I put it at 400, keeping a close eye on it just in case, ...the times were still apllicable so I'm thinking it's another of allrecipe's editing mistakes. *insert rolling eye emotie here* I used white american cheese & forewent the tomatoes. Thanks NESLUNDCORI!

Very tasty! I think I used more mayo then called for (didn't measure, just eyeballed it) Also added some cream cheese, and a little garlic powder. We used real cheddar rather then the prosessed stuff, as we like it WAY better. Very tasty snack! :)

I put this on open sliced bread which worked just as well. Nice to put all in oven at once. Used 12 oz of tuna for 4 but could have used a little more. NEXT TIME: Family prefers provolone slices which fit perfectly on the English muffins. Plus, the 12 oz is a good fit for 4 muffins.I don't bother using celery salt.

Good recipe, bad degrees.  I don't want to wait all day for a tuna melt.  350 should do it.

Fantastic all you could wish for.  Simple to prepare easy to cook, tastey and healthy, cheap and now the kids are very cheerful. Someone else said this one is not for the kids no they are quite correct the whole family loved them and the kids can help make them. A snack keeper for sure!!

Cheap and easy. A good way to use up tuna and get veggies servings for the day. I’d definitely make this again.

I’d use this recipe again.  I added Paprika, left out the bell pepper and used sharp cheddar > american cheese.  I also eyed up the ingredients to personal taste and used more mayo.  Thanks for the recipe!
