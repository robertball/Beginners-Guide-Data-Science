This is a nice recipe, but I made several changes to intensify the flavor.  I added a couple of finely chopped celery ribs, a diced potato, three large squares of instant chicken bouillon, and a little crushed basil.  I used half-and-half instead of heavy cream (this dish is WAY rich enough without heavy cream!!) and also cut the cream to ONE quart.  I would probably add more corn and vegetables next time to make it more of a thick chowder.

good basic recipe, however i added a pound of fresh crabmeat, used 8 ears of fresh corn, 2 yellow onions and lots of freshly ground pepper. (toasted garlic french bread is mandatory with this dish).

my parents can be picky when it comes new new foods,But when I made this chowder the whole pot was gone. I revised it a little. I used two cans creamed corn and one can whole in place of the ears.

Ok I am revising my review for this. The basic recipe here is good. But it is very, very basic. To me it tasted like bland cream with corn in it. It wasn't smooth or flavourful in anyway. Ok so let's fix it by adding some cubed potatoes, chicken stock and half the cream. Add some garlic and chopped parsley, a dollop of butter to make it smooth and thicken it ever so slightly with corn starch as well. Also  substitute the 2 quarts of whipping cream with only 1 quart of it and 1 can of evaporated milk. The way this recipe is written is not tasty at all. It needs something more added.  I will give it 2 stars for the basic recipe, but it definitely needs major tweeking.

This is an excellent starting point recipe. I did mostly substitute the heavy cream for 1 fat free half and half, 1 regular half/half and added only about 1/4 cup of the heavy cream just to thicken it a little bit and cut down some on the fat. I also added potatoes to it. Overall this is a great recipe. Everyone raved about it. It is rich and creamy even using mostly the half/half. Taste great after letting it sit over night. Definite keeper. I use all the time

Some of you are gonna have issue with this but...
This was good but with some of the modifications I borrowed from several of the reviewers.
I used the frozen corn simply for ease but also appreciate the added nutritional benefit.  I also opted for half and half instead of the heavy cream.  Anyone do a comparison of calories there?!  I used less than a 1/2 of the recommended amount.
Cut the amount of onion in half, enhanced with dried Hatch chile and a little garlic.  Also added about 2 cups of shredded breakfast potatoes.
My husband ate this, my son loved it (multiple comments of "that was good") and I also appreciated my first attempt at Conh Chowdah.  :)
Hope you don't mind my modifications Michelle.  Your soup was a great base recipe.  
And thank you to the other reviewers for their suggestions.

with additions.  Used half the heavy cream and substituted chicken broth.  Also added about 3 potatoes, and 2 cloves minced garlic.  An AMAZING use of fresh corn especially when it is plentiful in the summertime.  Also finished with some Texas Pete.  YUM!

This recipe was to bland and used far to much cream. I should have read the reviews so that I knew what else to add. My family gave this chowdah the thumbs down.

MMMMM... very good! I added lump crabmeat, used can corn, heavy cream and half-and-half. I made this twice so far and it was a hit both times.

so delicious, easy to make, though probably not the healthiest choice with all that cream.

Risking being one of "those people" who rates a recipe that she has modified, this soup did turn out well.... with necessary additions to make it worth eating!  I agree with all the reviewers that say this recipe is *blah* as-is, with too much cream.  I cut that back by half and replaced with a combo of chicken broth and milk.  I also added diced red potatoes, a freshly minced green chili, & green onions instead of 'standard.'  That's all it needed to be turned into a complex, inviting, filling meal.  Best part: my kids REALLY liked it, and my husband said it tasted like "liquid butter."

I added red bell pepper, celery, diced potatoes and mushrooms to the saute. I used frozen corn that I had on hand rather than fresh. I added 4 small chicken bullion cubes and a small amount of water to the vegetables to allow them to soften and cook.  Next I coarsely blended about a cup of the sauteed vegetables with some heavy cream and returned the mixture to the pot.  Finally, I added  about a cup of  heavy cream and a cup of 1%milk to make a hearty chowder.  I adjusted the salt and pepper to taste and served with fresh dill on top.  With all those adjustments, it turned into a fantastic soup!

Great soup.. very heavy and rich yummy!  However I made some adjustments.  I added 2 knorr vegetable boullion cubes, 2 leeks finely chopped, 3 sprigs of rosemary and a pinch of cayenne pepper.  One quart of heavy cream and one quart of half and half.  I added the leeks along with the onions.  Then added the boullion cubes with the heavy cream and half and half,  simmer until boullion cubes breakdown.  Add the rosemary and cayenne pepper towards the end or early if you want a more intense flavor~ Enjoy!

Great foundation....I dont really use measurements, I read many recipes and then go from there. This recipe served that purpose I cut the heavy cream(Used half a quart) Added about a cup of chicken stock, used half and half and creamed corn to thicken. Add potatos and use bacon to garnish with LOTS of pepper! My picky eaters LOVED it.

I made this last night and I have to say it wasn't very good.   It was very bland and needed lots of salt to give it any flavor.  I probably won't b making this recipe again .
