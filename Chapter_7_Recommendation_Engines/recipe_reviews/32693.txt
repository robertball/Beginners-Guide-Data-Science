All of these ingredients sounded so good individually to me, but when you put them all together ... GROSS!  Orange-flavored blue curacao mixed with coconut...then throw in some vodka for extra punch, and then the fruity flavor of champagne on top of all that.  I thought the color would be nice, but with the red grenadine added to the blue liquor, I ended up with a grayish concoction instead of a pretty blue or purple drink.  I made 2 glasses of this, each a little different, and ended up dumping them both down the drain.
