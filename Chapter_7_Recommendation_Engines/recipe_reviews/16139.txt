I made this for dinner and it turned out really well.  It was filling enough for a main course and we used the leftovers as a side salad the next day when we barbequed hamburgers. I added diced tomatoes and 1/2 cup of sun dried tomatoes to it as well and it was delicious.

Great Pasta salad. Used leftover BBQ chicken and added tomatoes, green pepper, artichoke hearts and feta cheese to the other ingredients.

I *love* this recipe. I tried it out and it was so tasty. I could eat this over and over again. I don't always use olives, and tomatoes seems like it might be overkill, but when cooking the chicken, I use sesame seed oil, rice wine vinegar, and some soy sauce, as well as a bit of powdered ginger for a boost of flavor for the chicken all by itself. This is an excellent recipe.

This was absolutely delicious. I added cherry tomatoes and used 2 cups of bowtie pasta. I also seasoned the chicken with soy sauce and a little garlic before adding to the salad. Would make again.

My Mom and Dad really liked this, but I just thought it was OK.  I kept thinking that it needed something, like maybe some buffalo mozzeralla cut into cubes, but both of my parents thought it was great as it was.  We used 1 cup of chicken from a rotisserie chicken.  I mixed the veggies with the dressing and put it in the fridge for an hour or so before we were ready to serve.  I also cooked the pasta, drained it, and put it in the fridge an hour ahead of time.  It helped to make the salad nicely chilled and helped to combine the flavors.  I will probably make again for my hubby with the addition of the cheese.

This was excellent.  My whole family loved it.  I served it over sweet baby lettuce and added some balsamic vinagrette.  I will make this over and over again.

Yum! I used whole wheat ziti instead of seashell pasta, added mushrooms, and used green olives because I was out of black. The sunflower seeds add a nice flavor/crunch. Thanks :)

I didn't have olives or sunflower seeds. I used elbow macaroni,and added steamed broccoli. I included carrots and tomatoes to add color to the salad. Glad to have a macaroni salad that doesn't have mayonnaise in it. Ingredients don't have to be measured. I would make this again, just as tasty the next day.

This salad is delicious!  I served it to my husband and brother and they both loved it.  I did change a little bit of it though.  I used Sun-Dried Tomato Chicken Sausage and a green pepper (that's what I had).  It was great!   I think this salad would be good with pineapple, mandarin oranges, and lots of other stuff.  Thanks for sharing!

Awsome salad!!!  I usually have a great dislike of pasta salads but, this was one great exception.    It was easy, nutritious, and delicious.  I will definitely make again and again.

This is really good. I made it two weeks in a row that's how much we enjoyed it. Even my daughter who likes nothing loved it. I do leave out the sunflower seeds.

I doubled this recipe. I used chicken thigh meat (caught a good sale this week), balsamic-based italian dressing and threw in about a cup of halved cherry tomatoes. Nice quick throw-together salad that was easy on the budget. NOTE: The longer this sits, the better it gets.

We also add a bit of mayo and a squeeze of fresh lemon juice, as well as some peas, walnuts and chunks of Swiss cheese.  Just adds a little more to the salad (personal pref.) and makes it a meal.  This time I used campanelle pasta (ruffled bells).

My toddler and husband loved this! It is simple, yet delicious. I used kalamata olives (because that is what I had on hand) and I served it with the "Creamy Italian Dressing I" recipe from this site instead of a bottled Italian dressing. Very tasty!

This was excellent! I really enjoyed this the only problem I have is that it says it makes 6 servings. I ate half of it at dinner. I may need to double it next time.

This is a great summer salad and one to use up leftover chicken. I actually had some chicken in the freezer that I pulled out for this. I omitted the black olives because I don't like them and added grated carrots. I even tried to lighten it up a bit by using fat-free zesty Italian dressing.

Fantastic summer dish. I used sweet onion instead of green onions, and also added grape tomatoes and some feta cheese. Great as a main or a side dish. Will definitely be making this again
