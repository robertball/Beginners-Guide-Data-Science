This is a great recipe, only instead of the buscuits, i used tostitos scoops, they make a perfect bowl, i placed them on a cookie sheet, and made tons of them, my kids went crazy over them, it was a sure success the first time...

I tried these for a party and they were a big hit. The 2 things I changed were instead of bisquits I used tostitos scoops and I filled half the batch with burger and refried beans. They were wonderful.

they were easy enough but kind of plain i suggest spicing it up a little with a little green oinoin and tomato and i also suggest a corn shell or a corn tortilla shell  the biscuits don't work well with the overall taste.

I made these for my sister's kids.  They love any type of taco and really loved these.  I used a corn biscuit this time, but they are just as good w/ regular biscuits.  I added a bit of medium salsa to the taco meat for a little more kick.

I suggest using only half of one biscuit per muffin cup - otherwise you end up with a muffin-shaped biscuit with meat on top.

These were good but they we're a little dry. If you added something like green chillies or refried beans it would make them more moist. Other than they they tasted great and it is a really good idea for something "FUN"...

These were a different appetizer that I found last minute.  Some reviewers noted that it needed more zip.  I found a packet of seasoning at my local supermarket (Chi CHi's brand) that had onion and green chilis in it.  I used half of that and half of the regular taco seasoning.  That worked well and blended nicely.  I used a mini muffin pan and used half of the bisquit in each.  I set sour cream and salsa to the side.  Yummy!

These were so easy and my guests loved them.  Instead of ground beef I use ground chicken for a little more flavor and used half the layers of the Grands bicuits in smaller muffin tins to make more snack size cups.  Yummy yummy.

These tasted good, but not great.  I also had to tweak the recipe a bit because the cups werent quite working as easy as the recipe made it seem.

This is a great recipe.  Very quick and easy.  I used the large muffin cups and made it for dinner.  The kids and hubby gobbled it up.  I served with lettuce, tomato, onion and sour cream.  Will make again.

I think this would be best made with big ol' Grand biscuits, the smaller ones fell apart and don't fit in the entire muffin cup.

This is a good recipe, but I usually make these like pizza with hamburger,pepperoni,olives and pizza sauce.  Which I think taste better with the biscuits.

I thought they were very good.  I made them for an appetizer so the medium muffin pan made them too big to be eat without a plate and fork.  Next time I will make them in a mini-muffin pan.  Delish!!

Easy, Quick, Fun, Tasty!  I made it for dinner with a side salad. 
Taco Bell taco seasoning is definitely better than other choices and I suggest using a large Grands type biscuit.  Otherwise, you will need to combine two biscuits and they can get a little tough.

Extremely easy to make, probably more fun for kids events.  They were a pretty good hit at the party I made them for, just not a pretty platter... we've nicknamed them "meat muffins!"

This recipe was really yummy! I made is as a meal instead of an appetizer. I added fried potatoes to the cups and served rice on the side. It takes about three cups to make a filling meal.
