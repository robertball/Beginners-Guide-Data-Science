Only thing I did different was to let the prepared pudding (bread slices buttered both sides lavishly and 'cubed' before mixing) sit for a few hours in the fridge before I baked it, and also replaced the raisins with chopped pecans. I did 1 1/2 batches and baked in a (non-stick sprayed) 9 x 13 inch glass casserole. From the nestle site, where I first found this recipe, to serve with caramel sauce was optional; so I tried it with caramel (I loved it) and custard sauces (family's request), both homemade. Very much a comfort food, anytime, anyday. This recipe is eons ahead than the more popular bread pudding II (Ellen's) also from this site. Excellent recipe, not eggy and not mushy; and the smells when baking - buttery, creamy ... mmm .. anyone entering the house instantly felt hungry, lol. Good one.

This is awesome!  I hadn't tried bread pudding before this; the thought of soggy bread was over the top for me.  My whole family enjoyed this so much, though, that it will definitely be a regular around here.  I poured in the cinnamon and nutmeg (those things don't get measured in my kitchen), and I added cut-up apples (peeled, of course)and walnuts.  Wow-ee!

We cubed the bread (since the recipe did not call for it), added extra vanilla, and cubed apples. We had to bake it for about an hour instead of 35-45 minutes, but it was worth it. We drizzled warm caramel sauce on top and it was delicious. Recommend adding granulated white sugar in the mix and definitly adding the caramel sauce. Enjoy!

Overall this was a pretty tasty recipe. I adjusted it to 4 servings and baked it in a Corning Ware baking dish (covered), for about 40 minutes. I then uncovered it so it would brown nicely. I had to bake it for about an hour though. It was a very moist recipe. Next time, I will increase the spices a little bit and add a little granulated sugar. A little warm bread pudding topped with Cool-Whip for breakfast never hurt anyone!

This was real good.  I used a loaf of homemade cinnamon raisin bread I made in my breadmaker that was a few days old.  I cut the bread into cubes and added 2 cubed, red delicious apples.  I baked an additional 10 minutes. This turned out good and smelled good cooking.

This is a perfect recipe on it's own however I sometimes add canned apples to the bottom of the pan before putting in the bread and egg mixture.  Add ice cream while it's warm for a wonderful treat.

I made this for guests who absolutely love bread pudding and they said this was one of the best they had ever had!  I served mine warm with vanilla ice cream.

This was really great and my husband loved it! The only change I made was I used raisin bread instead of regular bread and added raisins.

This is one of the simplest recipes to create and yet results in a sweet, rich concoction.   Similar to other reviews, I let it bake for 45 minutes an hour, which did not dry it out too much and still let it very soft. Instead of regular bread, I used Cinnamon swirl bread (NOT Cinnamon Raisin-- I added my own raisins), cubed; which resulted in a cinnamon roll flavor. Thus, I also reduced the cinnamon ingredient. I did not add nutmeg; as I am not a nutmeg fan.  To serve, I topped it with cinnamon to decorate and Carnation condensed milk swirled which not only created a beautiful display, but lovely accented flavor. On other pieces, I omitted the condensed milk and topped it with raw, white Star Thistle Honey (you can find this at gourmet stores). This was also lovely. My boyfriend warmed it up with Ben & Jerry's and enoyed it a la mode.  Overall, a great recipe.

Excellent and easy peasy!  I omitted the raisins because I don't like raisins, but I think cranberries will be tasty and will try them in the future.  I used whole grain bread because that was all I had in the house, and 3 leftover cinnamon rolls (so I reduced the amount of cinnamon and nutmeg slightly).  I added a green Granny Smith apple peeled and cubed as well as walnuts, and after baking I drizzled with T Marzetti caramel sauce and topped with whipped cream.  It smelled heavenly while it was baking.  I could barely wait to taste it!  I ended up having to bake for 50 minutes total.  I will make this again and again!!

This is absolutely delicious.  It's moist and creamy, not eggy.  I substituted the evaporated milk with 2 cups of half and half and 1 cup of whipping cream for  a fresher flavor.  I also used raisin bread, so I cut the cinnamon in half and left out the raisins.  It was a quick favorite in our home.  Definitely a keeper.

Loved this.  Have had bread and butter pudding since i was young and almost always love all the variations.  This was a lovely light flavour and nice and solid.  I loved the throw it all in method rather than buttering the bread ec (i melted the butter and added it with the wet ingredients).  I didnt have enough bread slices so also used some bread rolls i just broke all the bread up into chunks i also didnt have quite enough carnation milk so topped it up with single cream.  Is delicious with custard.

Very good! The only thing I had trouble with was the recipe does not say to tear/cut the bread into pieces and it also didn't say what to do with the butter (melt, dice, etc) I tore the bread into large chunks and melted the butter. It tasted great though!

I made a double recipe for our family Christmas dinner. Everyone loved this pudding. I added a few candied red and green cherries to make it festive.  It looks like this will be a tradition at our Christmas dinner.

I've never made bread pudding before, this recipe is very easy and turned out delicious.  Instead of white bread, I used leftover rolls from the school cafeteria rolls recipe.  It was delicious.  I drizzled a vanilla glaze over it and served with ice cream....i'll be baking this again and again.

Breathtaking! I used dried cranberries instead of raisins, one can of carnation evaporated milk and 1 1/2 cups of water. A small piece of dark chocolate was chopped in the food processor with the other ingredients, and a tablespoon of caramel also from a larger piece of chocolate candy was placed in the center of the pudding.  My bread was also a hodge podge of different bread scraps including some whole wheat.  Some I processed, some I left as slices.  The blend of textures and tastes were impressive.  This was memorable to all who tasted it. I really enjoyed making and eating it.  This recipe is a keeper!  Thank you Nestle.

My DH has been on a bread pudding kick lately. Made this last night pretty much following the recipe. I used cinnamon bread that I tore up, instead of plain bread. Other than that I used all the ingredients called for except the nutmeg, not a fan. I had to let it bake for close to an hour. As is, it's okay. Not as stong of a cinnamon taste as I expected. Next time I think I will add a little more brown sugar. I served it with Cool Whip, but think I will prepare some type of sauce to go with it.

Yummy!  My family enjoyed it, too.  I like that it has brown sugar instead of white.  I used stale raisin bagels so didn't add extra raisins and did set the dish in water while it cooked.  Will definitely make again.

This is a delicious comfort food for a cold winter night. It's simple, easy to make, and I will definitly be making it again, come next season.
Only adaption I made was to use a half loaf of Irish Scone Bread, with raisins and a touch of rye in it. I halved this recipe and added less raisins, and it came out just fine. Only thing I was missing was ice cream or whipped cream!!!

My family doesn't like cinnamon so I omitted it. In went an entire stick of butter and the bread was replaced with four stale bagels that have been languishing in the freezer for such a time as this. The result? I could easily eat the whole thing without any assistance from anyone else. I never feel that vanilla is enough in anything,so you might want to up it a tad or a lot,your call. However, I have to wonder how this would turn out with a bit of rum or Irish creme slipped into the milk mixture.This is happily kosher, so it'd be a great addition to the Sabbath table. Now,where can I hide this stuff from myself between now and Friday night...

Great recipe, especially because I just came home from a trip with some great Italian bread that was a couple days olf from my favorite Italian store and I had no milk in the house buut I almost always have Carnation evaporated milk.  I only made a 1/2 batch and think next time I might a little bit more of the spices, but it was still wonderful.

Baked as instructed, very tasty but I think I will experiment like others have with using raisin bread or adding apples just to see if it gives more to the recipe. The nutmeg is apparent in the taste after baking, that I will cut back or delete from the recipe next time I bake. All in all, it was a success...I added some vanilla ice cream to a warm piece and will try it cold with the whipped cream. Ice Cream was a nice touch, expect the whipped cream to be the same result.

Perfect! I used almond milk instead of evaporated milk because I'm allergic to milk and it was perfect!

I made this for a family gathering and it was devoured almost as soon as it was put out.  Even the relatives that "don't care for sweets" enjoyed this.  I served it with hot caramel sauce.

This was okay, sweet and all, but I expected a more buttery and rich taste.  I would add more butter, use a more substantial bread (possibly french) and drizzle a sticky sauce on top.
