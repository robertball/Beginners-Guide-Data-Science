Taking a survey to determine the best chocolate chip cookie is as impossible as determining the best cola, the best burger, etc. It is sooo subjective. So many variables--the level of ability of the baker, the size and shape of the cookies, baking times, and imperfect oven temperatures to mention a few. Not to mention personal preferences...chewy or cakey, thick or thin, and on and on. I made this exactly as written, leaving some of the dough mounded, and flattening other batches slightly. The dough is just right...easy to work with. I found this dough will do whatever you want it to in terms of thickness.  The cookies come out of the oven with pretty much the same shape they went in with. Having said that, I still found this a good, but just average cookie (three stars to me means average).  A little on the thick side and not quite as flavorful as other recipes. I think if all butter were used it would take care of both issues. There are a lot of good chocolate chip recipes out there--my personal preference continues to be "Chewy Jumbo Chocolate Chip Cookies" on the Land o' Lakes website. Still, I would not discourage others from trying this recipe, as it just might be your favorite!

If I could have given this recipe no stars I would have.  An earlier review referred to a "Golf Ball" analogy.  They were being kind.  The reason you need a lot of ice cold milk (as suggested in the final part of the recipe) is that  you need a ton of milk to soften them up.  Coming out of the oven they are hard (not crisp) on the outside and dry in the middle.  As they cooled they just became hard all the way through.  And yes I brought them out of the oven while they still looked light and undercooked.

Great cookie. I was a bit afraid of the flour amount, especially when the dough tasted floury, too. I added a third egg and about 1/4 - 1/2 cup of oat flour to get to a good consistency (if choco chips can be 'plucked' from the dough without the dough sticking, then you're good to go). Tip: put rolled oats in a blender until flour-like if you can't find oat flour anywhere. Oat flour makes a chewier cookie, but don't substitute it measure for measure. My other chewy cookie secret: A teaspoon of regular MAYO. No, you can't taste it, and NO NO NO don't use Miracle Whip!!! THAT would be awful.

Great basic recipe!  I made a few alterations:  I substituted baking POWDER for the baking soda, because it keeps them fluffier, and used 1 1/2 cups brown sugar and 1/2 cup white sugar, to make them moist and chewier.  Thanks for the recipe! :)

Oh my god! These were the best chocolate chip cookies I ever made. I've made so many chocolate chip cookies, but I'll never go back to those other recipes - this one is by far the best. I learned a trick on here to made the chewier and softer: mayonnaise. Add 1 teaspoon of mayonnaise after beating in the eggs to the creamed butter and sugar, before the dry ingredients. Wow! It was amazing. I never thought I'd want to add mayonnaise to my cookies, but it was amazing!

This is a great cookie recipe - I have made these cookies at least 4 times and have gotten raves every time.  It also makes a massive amount (of small cookies) or a medium batch of larger cookies (which is what I do)  They also seem to do better when I take them out of the oven promptly at 10 minutes.

I've tried a ton of cookie recipes, and this one is by far my favorite!!  I even use the dough (made with EggBeaters) as cookie dough for my homemade cookie dough ice cream.  DEFINITELY do not overbake these, though, or they'll be hard.  I only bake mine for 7-8 minutes, let them sit on the pan for another 2 minutes, and then let them cool on a cooling rack.  I actually like these better the second day - they're a little gooey because I take them out when the middle's slightly underdone, but by the time they've cooled out they are absolutely fantastic.  They're chewy, gooey, and delicious.  I'm always asked to make these cookies for parties and picnics.  Thanks Beth!!!

Very delicious cookie...soft and chewy, as promised.  I really enjoy the texture, which is kind of similar to a really good peanut butter cookie.  The taste is unique for a chocolate chip cookie but definitely great!  A must for anyone who otherwise struggles with flat chocolate chip cookies!

If you flatten the cookies before putting them in the oven, then you will need less time for them to bake, say closer to only 8 minutes. If you do not flatten them and you drop them from a tablespoon then you will need the 12 minutes that the recipie states. So, ask yourself if you are a "flattener" or not and then judge your baking time accordingly and these cookies are a chewy delight.

Wowee Zowee!  Easy, plump, chewy cookies that taste better every time I put one in my mouth!  I followed this recipe almost exactly (I used regular shortening - just fine, although I will now get butter flavored specifically for this!) and let me tell you, I'm no baker, ask my wife, but these cookies turned out remarkable.  I would say that in lower climates (I live shoreside in Hawaii) take the cookies out in 8 minutes.  Also, stick to the tablespoon scoop of the recipe... the rounds look small, but these cookies are portly little gems!  Thanks so much for giving me the confidence to get back into baking!  Now, back to my next batch...

This recipe is practically verbatim from the 1969 Betty Crocker cookbook (only exception is that back then they didn't make butter-flavored shortening, so it just calls for "shortening,") and I've been making it for more than 30 years. Back when I started making it, I found that the texture is greatly improved by cutting out 1/2 cup of flour, using 3 cups only. Cutting the flour by half a cup allows for a lot of spread and a flatter cookie. If you prefer a cookie with moderate spread and a bit of a dome, only cut by 1/4 cup. Cutting the flour eliminates the "Golf Ball Syndrome" reported by others, allowing for spread. It's an awesome recipe that will get lots and lots of praise. It calls for a higher fat ratio than most, which makes it more tender and slightly chewier than most. You can count on these remaining fresh for a few days.  They freeze perfectly for up to 3 months. Everyone goes crazy for these.

I had no idea how these would turn out, but they are wonderful! I was pleasantly surprised as I am partial with another chocolate chip cookie recipe. The only thing I change is I use butter instead of shortening. Instead of making regular sized cookies, I made jumbo cookies by using 1/2 cup of dough per cookie. I took my 1/2 C. measuring cup and scooped the dough into my hands and I rolled them into perfectly round balls. They will be about the size of baseballs. I baked them on a dark metal cookie sheet at 350 for 20 minutes or until done. They spread out and bake nicely considering the amount of dough. I also make regular and big cookies and sometimes add sprinkles or M&M's to the tops. Terrific recipe!

I followed the recipe to the letter! These cookies are DELICIOUS!! They don't spread out flat like the toll house recipe. These are so nice and fat and full of chocolate chips. Don't forget the milk. YUMMY!

I've been making these for the last 3 years now, and it is an all time favorite of my family and friends! I do cut the sugar down to 3/4 cup. I read some of the reviews mentioned having crumbly dough...but mine doesn't turn out that way. I mix everything, but the chocolate chips and nuts, in the electric mixer. When dough is thoroughly mixed, I add the chips and nuts using a big spatula. Once all mixed, I press the though together in the bowl to look like big playdough. For a perfect, looking cookies, I use a melon baller (looks like a small ice-cream scooper) to scoop them out and place them on the cookie sheet (I use stoneware). Just like little ice-cream scoops, I bake them just like that. They turn out so perfectly! One of my co-workers mentioned they look like Famous Amos cookies...but better! I've tried other CC cookie recipes, but this one is the one I get many great compliments with. Hopefully this will help some of the reviewers. "Happy baking!"

As another review suggested, I added 1 teaspoon of mayo to the recipe.  That is the only the only modification I made, and, BOY, OH, BOY!, are these cookies delicious! I got 3 dozen large cookies from the batch and will have to make more before the day is over!  Thanks for sharing, Beth!

Cookies came out really good.  Crisp on outside and a chewy inside. I did add an extra 1/2 cup chocolate chips in addition to the pecans. Used a large melon baller to scoop out dough. Cookies were uniform in size, hardly spread at all and I was able to get 87 cookies from the recipe.

These cookies are as soft as can be and taste just like how my roommate used to make them.  Also, they don't spread very much (because of the shortening, so you can fit a lot on a cookie sheet.  I followed the recommendations for others and used baking powder instead of soda and added 1 tsp mayo.  When you bake these cookies, the tops will be white when they are done, but golden brown on the bottom.  They will look underdone, but won't deflate if you touch them.

I have to preface this review with the fact this is the first time I have ever used shortening in a cookie recipe, I usually bake only with butter but I had some shortening to use up and my son wanted chocolate chip cookies.
These cookies do not spread, if yours spread either your butter was too soft or you did not measure your flour properly and you need to add more. I used my purple scoop which made 54 cookies, I flattened them with the bottom of a drinking glass, I used mini chocolate chips and half whole wheat flour, 12 minutes was perfect on Silpat lined sheets, edges were slightly brown and crispy, the center was chewy. A big hit with my son's hockey team and helped me clean out my pantry a bit.

Sadly I cannot rate this cookie high.  It was tasty,  but it was much too hard & crunchy for my poor, old, aging baby boomer teeth.  There was nothing at all soft about them, & I took them out of the oven when the tops were just barely no longer spongy soft on top, & at only 9-10 minutes cooking time.  I'll most likely treat my bunnies to them, it will be good for their teeth.

My kids have been complaining about the tollhouse recipe I use on the back of the chocolate chip bag (ungrateful little things, aren't they? lol) so anyway, I tried these and thought they were good, nice and soft.  I only used 3 cups of flour, and 2 sticks of butter (since I didn't have any butter flavored shortening on hand).  FYI, I was worried the 1 TABLESPOON of vanilla was a typo, but it tastes just fine.

I made 1/2 a batch w/ less flour (since so many reviewers said this recipe had too much) and then I made another 1/2 a batch w/ the written amount of flour. This recipe is perfect just the way it's written. W/ less flour, the cookies came out way too flat. I made this again for the second time. This really is such a good recipe. We had some people over tonight and everyone just loved these cookies so much and everyone wanted the recipe!

These were the best cookies ever!! I loved them, my family loved them, they were great. The best part is too, they stay soft and chewy, which goes good around my house. Thank you so much for sharing your recipe!! I have made this recipe about 5 times already, and the last time I did, i added 1/4 c milk, and it made a big difference, in a good way!

These cookies were AWFUL!!!  I have no clue why the rating is so good for these.  Other than adding the nuts, I followed the recipe exactly and they were very dry and cakey. Even my four year old daughter spit it out and threw it away.  I will definately not be making these again.  Ick.

Mrs Sigg...you're 2 for 2 over here!  Not only were these delicious, but they were soooooo pretty.  By pretty, I mean these are a show off cookie.  I will definately use this recipe again, the dough was very easy to work with (which made it that much easier).  Thanks Beth, these are great!!!

i halved the recipe and used only butter and no shortening. in this halved recipe, i used half cup almond sticks, half cup raisins, and half cup choc chips. i placed the dough in the fridge before baking and it did turn out thick and soft. however, 10 minutes at 190 degrees seem to be too long as the botton of my cookies were kinda burnt. so i shortened the time to about 8 min. the flavor was so-so..not overly sweet.....but it definitely was not chewy, which i didn't like. if anyone has tried au bon pain's cookies..they'll know how divinely chewy they are..and this recipe is nothing compared to those cookies.

These came out perfectly!  Love the combination of shortening and butter and if you keep them in the fridge before baking ... they don't spread out as much when you bake them!

My 13 year old son made these tonight and they were wonderful; nice and thick and chewy-yum!  He's been searching for a recipe similar to the cookies served at his school and these seemed to fit the bill.  He baked them for 10 mins and pulled them from the oven and put them immediately in the freezer.  The whole family has loved them!  (the only thing he changed about the recipe=1 C. choco chips and 1C m&m's and no nuts) Thanks for sharing this terrific recipe!

I don't know why these cookies got bad reviews because I thought they were wonderful.  I didn't have cakey cookies like some others did and mine didn't stay in balls.  My cookies spread just a bit and mine were done at 8 minutes in my convection oven.  These cookies were everything you want in a chocolate chip cookie: soft and chewy inside with crispy edges.

Holy , these are delicious!  Thank you!  I have been looking for a recipe like this for ages.  I used 1 1/3 cup of butter instead of using shortening becuase I didn't have any.  They were DANK!

These are absolutely wonderful! I think the combination of shortening and butter give them just the right texture. Crisp on the outside and soft and chewy on the inside. I followed the recipe to a tee and I couldn't have asked for a better cookie. I made some of them smaller using my 1.5 Tbsp. cookie scoop, rolled them in balls and pressed them down slightly. The others I made using my 4 Tbsp. cookie scoop and pressed M&Ms onto the top.

Held their shape, nice texture and taste.  I used mini chips and walnuts, I think the mini chips are a nice way to go.  Yum.

I exchanged almond butter for the shortning and this recipe turned out AMAZING - I have been searching for a recipe that makes firm and thick cookies with a doughy center. This is the cookie!

We all loved these cookies. I used unbleached organic flour on the first batch, and they cooked up thick and delicious. Then, I made a 2nd batch and cooked with bleached flour, and they cooked up thinner but just as delicious. I also reduced the heat slightly and cooked 3 minutes longer because the bottoms burned on my first batch!  EVERYONE IN THE FAMILY LOVED THESE!!!

Even I, who don't like chocolate chip cookies think these are good. I made them with all butter flavored shortening for a lactose inhibited brother. Add 4t of water and that works fine.

these are probably the best tasting cookies i myself have EVER made. I actually changed it from just nuts and chips to mint and dark chocolate chips and I hope I don't get trapped and eat them all before I am able to give them away :)

When I first made this recipe I mistakenly used baking powder..after baking they were very bland, so I threw out the remaining dough. When I remade I following some reviewers advice and use 1/2 c. sugar and 1 1/2 c. brown sugar and used 1 tsp more of vanilla plus only 3 c. flour. Cookies turn out great, nice texture..nice thickness but, I find these cookies still lack a little bit of something?? Still a good cookie however.. and I would make again.

These were amazing! The hubs and I have tried so many different recipes and techniques for a good chewy chocolate chip cookie and these worked out perfect! I followed the recipe with the exception of 2 things that will help the cookie be chewier. I used one egg and one egg yolk, and also the 1tsp of mayo. When I formed into balls, I mashed the balls a little so they would bake evenly, and I only cooked for about 8-9 min, When edges start to crisp but middle is still soft. They look under done, but you let them cool on the baking sheet for 45 min to an hour. It seems like a lot of time, but works every time (learned from America's test kitchen) These were gone in 24 hrs. Thanks for such a simple but delicious recipe!

These were fantastic when fresh out of the oven. Do NOT overcook, or they turn crunchy the next day. These do best if they are slightly underdone, as far as texture the next day.

Awesome!.. My rating is for the final outcome with my modifications; I cut flour down to 3 cups because I didn't want them too firm.  I also used more brown sugar and less white sugar!.. I love how thick the cookies were; they really didn't spread much.   I used 1 cup MILK chocolate CHIPS  and 1 cup semi-sweet chocolate CHUNKS!  If you like flatter/gooey cookies (like Toll-House) go for one that calls for less flour!...  This is my favorite kind of chocolate chip cookie; more firm in texture; one you can really sink your teeth into!...

I just tried these, my very first homemade choc chip cookies!  I don't like shortening (hydrogenated fats are sooo bad for you!) so used all butter, mostly unsalted.  
Ran a little short, so cut down on the flour:  Add flour SLOWLY, if it gets pebbly there's too much!  Also ground up 1 cup of quick-cooking oats in the food processor and substituted it for 1 cup of flour, it made for a wonderful thick cookie that you really can't even taste the oats in.
I cut the sugar down to 3/4 cup each brown and white, and sampled a bit of the raw dough, it didn't taste sweet enough to me!  ...But once out of the oven, with all those chocolate chips, they were just right!  Creaming the butter (room temp, not cold!) with the sugar well at the beginning will get rid of any "grainy" sugar texture.  

When the cookies started turning brown around the edges I left them in for 30 seconds more:  They come out of the oven still squishy, but hardened quickly, and were still all soft in the middle.  Perfect, thanks!

I've been making this recipe for a few years now, and I'm famous for these cookies!!  Only, I have recently cut down the sugar to 3/4 cup each brown and white, and I like the texture better-- not so grainy.

Great cookie recipe. Soft and chewy. I use all butter so they will spread more while baking. With shortening,they are more cake-like than I prefer. The dough tends to be a little dry so I cut back on the flour. The only thing that keeps this from being a 5-star recipe is the fact that the cookies go stale so quickly. For best results,they should be eaten within 24 hrs.

THE BEST!!!  I have had many "issues" with chocolate chip cookies.  This recipe is perfect!  I made two batches in one week!  I did alter b/c I do not have butter-flavored shortening - I used 1 cup butter and 1/3 cup regular shortening.  I tried with the white and semi-sweet swirled chips (only a 10-oz. bag) plus mini Hershey's Special Dark bars in chunks to make up the difference.  Good-bye Toll House recipe!!

We've used this recipe a handful of times now, and these cookies always turn out fantastic. We omit the salt and instead of 2 eggs, we use 4 egg whites. It makes a chewier cookie thats just a little bit sweeter. They're wonderful right out of the oven, and even a couple of days later (you have to stash them to have any left that long after). Beth's peanut butter cookies are also delicious (although we do the same thing with the egg whites), they're listed as Mrs Siggs Peanut Butter Cookies, or something like that. Thanks Beth!

These are great! Here's what I did. Followed the recipe exactly except I added 2 T. vanilla for flavor. I've found cookies made with Crisco lack flavor. Also used a 2 T. cookie scoop filled to capacity then I flattened them to about 1/2 inch with the bottom of a floured glass. Left them in the oven for about 10-11 minutes and they turned out perfect. Very flavorful, crisp on the edges and soft in the middle. They look like bakery cookies. Next time I will make them with a 1/4 cup scoop. I love big cookies.

Thumbs up! I didn't have shortening and used butter...turned out fabulous. If you like thick fluffy cookies, just round out 1T cookie dough, bake 12 min. If you prefer your cookie a little flatter with crisp edges and soft center, round and flatten the 1t cookie dough in your hand first, bake 10 min. Keep the 1T vanilla! I used Ghirardelli chips and were they ever gooey! Yum.

Very good. but I would say you should refrigerate the cookies for at least an hour, this will make the cookie dough bake into a more cookie like form

These cookies turned out great. I cooked mine 8 minutes at 375°. They came out looking a little un-baked but once they cooled they tasted great.They stayed the same shape as when I put them on the baking sheet. I would diffidently share this recipe.

Fabulous!!!!!! these are my ideal cookies.  They came out strange looking; they looked golden but other than that they looked exactly like they did when they were put in!  they were still little balls.  They were perfect other than that though, they were crispy and chewy.  I would definitely disagree with the comment right before mine.

I think I need to review the other recipes after I tried this one twice the only changes I made were: 1- I tested one cookie in the oven before baking the rest to see if it's going to spread or stay like a golf ball , and what I saw that the cookie didn't spread much and it was too thick an raw so I started to flatten them by hand before baking them  .
2- if U are going to omit the pecans add more chocolate chip about  1/2 cup of chocolate chip  because one cup is not enough at all.
I really loved the cookies they were crispy from the out side and very chewy from the inside . don't ever try to substitute the shortening .

These are a very good, simple, and tastey traditional cookie.  I used all butter instead of shortning and butter. I also halfed the recipe and it still made a lot of cookies.

Great recipe! They are soft with a nice crisp outside.  This recipe is ALL in the time you cook them.  I took  them out while they looked not quite done, slightly doughy even(about 7 minutes) and they came out PERFECT.  When we took them out at 9 minutes, they were dry and tasted more bland.

These are quite tasty. They aren't quite as puffy as I like and they turn crunchy pretty quickly (30 minutes). I just like a chewier cookie, though; personal preference.

A solid recipe which baked up beautifully. I agree that it has an airy, cake-like texture. For me, it tasted light like a scone rather than the rich, flavorful cookie I hoped for-- no cookie crunch and yet no cake density either. Solid punch for guests but I'll keep looking for a knockout.

5 stars, but for the version I used. I did not use any shortening, but substituted butter so that I used 5/3 cup butter total. Used 1 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup white sugar. Substituted baking powder for baking soda. Made smaller balls a bit bigger than a silver dollar (not like in most of the pictures) and took out of the oven after 9 minutes.

Excellent. I make these big -- think golf-ball-sized balls of dough on the cookie tray -- and bake for about 14 minutes in a hotter-than-average oven.

Guess my expectations were too high. Inspite of the good ingredients, these turned out tasty kinda flat. Mine were crunchy without the soft center as advertised.

I absloutely love these!!  I didn't have chocolate chips, but I used peanut butter chips and used my medium Pampered Chef scoop to make a larger cookie than I normally do and they came out wonderful.  Crispy on the outside, soft in the middle.  Using the larger scoop I got 45 cookies and had to bake about 15-17 minutes.  Thanks for a great cookie, this is my go-to chip cookie recipe from now on!

We've tried several chocolate cookie recipes recently and like this one the best. Be sure to store them in an air-tight container to keep them moist. It makes a lot, so plan to share!

Lost my mom's recipe for CC cookies a few years ago and have been kicking myself since. All I could remember was 1 1/3 c oleo and 3 1/2 c flour. My eyes bugged out (seriously!) while reading this recipe, it all came back to me then, this recipe is the same except mom used all margarine and just a teaspoon of vanilla. After I became a mom I switched to 1/2 c white & 1 1/2 c brown sugars and doubled the vanilla. Thank you sooooo much Beth, I have the biggest smile on my face right now. :-D

I followed the recipe and my cookies didn't melt down - they stayed in balls. Still tasted good, but not the perfect cookie recipe.

Beth, these were fantastic!  I made them exactly as directed and got about 4 dozen crisp/chewy cookies.  It was hard to keep track of them because my family kept eating them as they came out of the oven!  Even though I'm the only one who likes nuts in my cookies, they all raved about these!

I love these cookies, thick crisp on the outside yet chewy on the inside.  I've been looking for a chocolate chip cookie that wouldn't just spread out, this one is definately a keeper.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

These are the best chocolate chip cookies ever! I have tried many recipies and this is the best one! I just love thick crispy and gooey chocolate chip cookies. I made them to bring on vacation with me. MAKE THIS BATCH!

TIP
I recommend to let them cool more than a about 75 seconds because I was so tempted I ate a very hot one. oops!

I want to start by saying that everyone is particular about how they like their chocolate chip cookies. Personally, I didn't like these at all, but that doesn't mean that they won't suit another's taste (obviously, because of all the great reviews). The batter was very thick and crumbly- I had to press the cookie together, and the chocolate chips kept falling out of the batter. After my first batch, it was obvious that this recipe makes very cake-y cookies. In my next batch, I tried to flatten out the cookie before I put it in the oven (these don't spread as they bake), which seemed to work better as far as appearance is concerned. As they cooled, it became apparent that these cookies are also for the crunchy cookie lover. I like my cookies chewy and soft. With all that said, the flavor was good- it was just the texture I didn't like. I'll stick with the "Best Big, Fat, Chewy Chocolate Chip Cookie" recipe on this site.

There are two pictures posted for these cookies...one is accurate, the other looks like pancakes made with very cheap margarine. If you follow the recipe, these cookies come out picture perfect and I happen to prefer them OVER the "Award Winning Choco Chip Cookies" that others keep reffering to.  I love those cookies too but they are way way sweeter.  This cookie is perfect in taste and texture in my opinion so to each her own.  AWESOME !!! (people who complain you will find did NOT follow the recipe...this one is great!)

These were very good cookies, although I gave them only four stars because they dried out rather quickly.  My husband gobbled them up, though, and he's pretty picky.  Thanks for the recipe!

I normally use the back-of-the-bag recipe for choco-chip cookies.  Not any more -- these are so much better!  I made big cookies using about 1/4C dough and after 9 minutes baking and 3 minutes cooling on the cookie sheet, the cookies had crunchy edges and a chewy middle.  Have to make more as they didn't last long.  Thanks!

i made these cookies yesterday, and let me say.. they are divine!
the height i got on them was great, and they were so chewy and thick and yummyyyyyyyyy.
i used milk chocolate chips, and sort of was afraid that they might be too sweet, but they were perfect! i also split the dough in half and mixed white chocolate chips and mini hershey kisses into half of it. those were awesome too, though didn't come out looking as nice for some reason.
i gave my boyfriend 2 dozen or so, and his friends now think i am a goddess  0:-)

I had been looking for a cookie recipe like this for :::years::: It turned out exactly as promised. Crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside PERFECT and WONDERFUL. What I enjoyed most about this was how solid the cookie remained during cooking it didn't thin out AT ALL!! It kept it's form from the spoon to the baking pan and EXACTLY 12 minutes in the oven cooking time. I will be making this recipe time and time again for ::many:: years to come. I may eventually add cornflakes to it like my Mother used to do. =))))))

Excellent cookies, I made exactly as directed, but I cut the quantity in 1/2, and I found that 10 minutes in the oven was more than sufficient, especially for subsequent batches.  A definite keeper when you have that craving!

I love to bake from scratch because I feel everything tastes fresher and better that way.  This recipe was a disappointment.  Though the cookies didn't turn out flat, which I dislike, the taste was *artificial* and they were a bit *oily* for my liking.  I had never used butter flavored shortening before and I doubt I ever will again.  Yuck.

WOW!  What an awesome cookie.  I wasn't sure how they would turn out, as the dough was very dry- in fact, it was so dry that I ended up adding another egg white in with the 2 eggs so the dough would at least stick together enough to form cookies.  But the cookies themselves turned out beautifully.  They're very light in color, and didn't spread much at all.  I baked them for about 8-9 minutes...just until the tops were starting to turn a bit brown.  You definitely don't want to overbake these.

I also put in 1/2 semisweet chocolate chunks, 1/2 white chocolate chips.  

They're INCREDIBLY chewy & soft.  I hate crunchy/crisp cookies, and these cookies are anything but.  They even stayed soft for a few days after baking them.  I took some to work and they were scarfed up instantly.  All in all, a great cookie...this recipe is definitely a keeper!

[EDIT]- a few months later, and this is still by far the best cokie recipe I have ever found.  It's phenomenal. The trick is to follow the recipe EXACTLY- and really make sure you blend the ingredients well.  Extremely well.  

I get rave reviews everytime I make these.  Thank you for the fabulous recipe, Beth! :)

This is the very best chocolate chip cookie recipe I have ever made. It was so easy, I don't know how anyone could mess this one up. I used margarine instead of butter flavored shortening, as suggested by others, and I used almonds instead of pecans. They came out perfectly, not flat like most home-made chocolate chip cookies. I gave this recipe to my mom, my sister, my best friend, everyone I know who bakes at home. Thank you Beth for a fabulous recipe.

Very good cookies! They are not as moist as some recipes so I am going to keep experimenting, but I would make them again.  Make sure to keep an eye on them because they bake fast, and that could be part of the reason they were a little dry for me. They are really great with 1/2 peanut butter chips and 1/2 semisweet chocolate chips!

HELP!  I'm supposedly on a diet, but I've eaten half the cookie dough already and the rest of the cookies I'm eating warm and ooey-gooey out of the oven!  These are the best chocolate cookies ever-I will never make another recipe.  I make them with all shortening for a big, thick cookie you can really sink your teeth into!

I was tired of using either the Mrs. Fields or the Nestle toll house choc-chip cookie recipes for the past 13 years, and I was desperately looking for a new recipe.  Since this had a lot of positive reviews, I gave it a try.  I followed the recipe EXACTLY, and they were delicious.  I will definitely be making these from now on.  Wonderful texture, beautiful cookies, and very good.  In the future, I may add maybe another 1/2 cup chips and bake for 13 minutes instead of 12.  Try it, it may just replace your current favorite chocolate chip cookie recipe (at least temporarily!)

These cookies are absolutely fantastic!  I baked some on my airbake pans and some on my cheap non-stick pans and I definitely recommend the high-quality pans--their taste and texture is so professional!  I also discovered halfway through preparing the dough that the butter I used was slightly rancid and the cookies are STILL spectacular!  This is my new recipe!  Thanks, Beth!

Your life is not complete without these cookies. I use the batter recipe and use choc. chunk instead of the nuts. Sometimes I add toffee chunks, I have never seen so many people flip out over a cookie. I love to cook and I try different recipes all the time and to this day my mouth drops to the reaction people make over these cookies.Thank you, God, I mean Beth!

INCREDIBLE!  These were fantastic!! I made them into cookie lollipops and they were perfect since they didn't spread out.  for those of you about to make it, don't mind the dough's crumbliness; it will go away with baking.  fairly light, moist, and thick--definately the BEST cookies i have EVER HAD!!

These cookies are dee-licious!  A couple things to note, though...watch your baking time---the first batch I made, I baked for 9 minutes and that was way too long (cookies came out tasty but hard---not at all "soft and chewy" as described).  Figured out that my oven bakes them perfectly if I take them out IMMEDIATELY after 8 minutes.  Also, I used a cookie dough scoop, and it helped if I flattened them out a bit before putting them in the oven---this dough does not spread much during baking.  Thank you Beth!  Keep your recipes coming!

A DELICIOUS cookie! I was a bit scared that I had
forgotten an ingredient since it was a "crumbly"
dough texture, but it came out great. I used mini chocolate chips, and will use the regular size next time. The mini chips are too much chocolate
for these cookies. Thanks you, Beth!
They are grrrrreat! Lynn in CA.

Really good cookies.  I used about 1/2 cup more flour and used baking "soda" instead of powder.  The cookies turned out more flat, with chewy centers and crispy edges.  Definitley good!  One of the best I've tried.  Also used butter instead of margarine.

My 9-year old son picked these out to make one Sunday afternoon - and enjoyed them very much!   More of biscuit-like cookie and strongly suggest using the pecans (great meld of flavors).  Do not overbake as they become rock-like!

These turned out awesome. Chewy, crispy, perfect flavor--not too oily or overly sweet like the Tollhouse variety goes, which I'm no fan of. Don't be afraid of the flour, you need every bit of it. The dough will be stiff, but the cookies have a lovely texture and aren't floury tasting at all! I used all butter instead of shortening (I don't like shortening). The cookies spread much more than the photo suggests but were still fluffier than the "Tollhouse" variety cookie. I am going to try using baking powder next time as someone suggested and see what happens with the shape. However, this recipe is going to be my staple from now on!

I did this exactly as the recipe shows, except I didn't have buttered shortening. I used regular. That, unfortunately really matters. We can totally taste the shortening. The cookies have a slightly gross, fatty taste to them. The cookies are perfect in thickness, chewiness, softness. To help cover the fatty flavor, (would have added butter flavoring if I had some) I added a little bit of almond extract and a whole bunch (maybe a 1/4 cup) of tiny peppermint pieces. So now they are Peppermint Crunch Chocolate Chip Cookies. lol. But they're good.

I made these for me, my brother, and his friend. They thought they were great, but I found a few flaws. Number one: make sure that the size of the cookie dough is a little less than a tablespoon. I like big cookies so I used a little over and they turned out HUGE and took forever to bake. Number two: they were a little too sugary. I could actually feel that grains of sugar as I ate them. Still, I wouldn't exactly encourage someone to use this recipe but everyone has different tastes.

Very good cookie - crunchy on the outside, chewy on the inside.  I made as written making half with the pecans and half without the pecans.  I got 85 cookies using the small cookie scoop out of this recipe.  More than enough to share and to freeze some.  Thanks Beth Sigworth for your recipe.  It is a keeper.

I only use real butter when baking, so didn't use 1/2 shortening, only butter.  I thought 1 tbls of vanilla sounded like a lot, but put in all anyway & was not dissappointed. I did add 1/4 tsp of cinnamon as mbb suggested. It really did add an extra something to the cookies. I also put in the optional pecans. This is the best chocolate chip cookie recipe I have ever made!!

This is my favorite chocolate chip cookie recipe. They always turn out really tasty and chewy. I like to add about a tbsp of mayo (not miracle whip) to the batter right before I add the dry ingredients, I find this makes them a little bit more moist (a tip I picked up on this website!) Its a staple recipe and I've used it as a base for lots of different cookies.

I used all butter as suggested by some, and a heavy amount of Hershey's mini kisses to try and sweeten them up as suggested by others... The dough was still so thick I had to get my man to finish the mixing, they don't settle at all so I had clumps instead of cookies, and they tasted like flour biscuits with Hershey's kisses at best. I was thinking it would be impossible to make a dry, bland, choc chip cookie, but here's the recipe for it!

I liked this recipe, I did change a few things though...I added about 1/4 cup vanilla instead of the 1 tablespoon, used all butter instead of the shortening and added 3 tablespoons of cocoa.  These cookies turned out very cakey and had lots of flavor.  I will definitely use this recipe again!

great cookies! i'm purty darn proud of myself and i'm NOT going to give Beth any credit for it cuz i accidentally put some baking powder into the recipe. let me say GREAT COOKiES (in case you missed it the first time).

i used butter flavored shortening sticks and recipe asks for 2/3 stick. up the servings to 108 US servings (LOL) and use the whole stick and store the rest cuz that's a whole lotta cookie dough!

These are very yummy.  The best chocolate chip cookie recipe ever.  Soft inside, a little crisp outside. Perfect!

This is the recipe that my grandma uses for chocolate chip cookies and she has given it to me, but of course every time I make them, the recipe has gotten dirtier and dirtier ( I am a messy baker.) Anyways, I have been looking for this recipe EVERYWHERE! It is fabulous. Flatten the cookies a bit before baking, and leave them on the pan for about 10-15 minutes, and they will stay softer longer. I also only bake mine for about 9 minutes. LOVE THEM!

I have been scouring the internet looking for an amazing chocolate chip cookie! This is it! Everyone loved them!  I added 1 tbs. of cinnamon for extra flavor/fragrance. WARNING: DO NOT OVER BAKE! Take them out of the oven when they are still a little doughy in the middle.

These are fabulous! I am making them for the second time this week because my husband cant get enough. I didnt have shortening, so I actually used stick margarine for the entire recipe and they were still great! I also add 1 1/2 tsp mayo in with the wet ingredients. This is a keeper for sure. Has replaced my go to choc chip recipe permanently! Thanks!

These turned out terrible, hard as a rock. And I  did not overbake, first batch I got out at 10 min, then cut it down to 8min.  I tried these because my normal cookie recipe uses all butter flavored crisco (and they are wonderful) But my husband "thinks" butter will make a better cookie.  Not so, I will be going back to my favorite chocolate chip recipe with all shortening

These cookies are awesome! I have made other cookies from scratch like this before and they always turned out too hard or something. These are perfect! Just make sure not to bake them for more than 8 mins!! I pulled them out when they were still slightly gooey in the middle.

Beware indeed!   My relentless (& obsessive) search for the best chocolate chip cookies recipe is now complete!  This is the ultimate recipe IMHO!  Thank you so much Beth you are a Star!  I made the recipe as instructed & they were marvelous!   I (intentionally) underbaked the first batch with soft, chewy, thick, & chocolatey results; then (accidently) overbaked the 2nd for a crispy, caramelized results--they were yummy both ways!  This will be my one & only from now on!  :)

This is always my go-to Chocolate Chip cookie recipe. I put a little less of the shortening and butter in (1/2 c each) but it's fine with the whole amount, too. I love the flavor this turns out.

I work at Max and Erma's and have been trying to make cookies like theirs for a while now. This is the closest I got. I did take the advice of one review by using 1 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup white sugar and using baking powder not soda. I also use dark brown sugar for a richer cookie. This is my recipe!! Finally found it!

These cookies are fantastic!  I will sometimes make them sweeter by using milk chocolate chips or occasionally mix it up with 1 cup of semi sweet and 1 cup of milk chocolate chips.  I also always use all butter, I've tried the butter Crisco combo, and prefer the all butter.  I've made this recipe probably 100 times or more, and never had a bad batch!  From those that have tried them they are universally loved.  Even those that tend to prefer the crispy chocolate chip cookies, appreciate and enjoy the softer chocolate chip cookie that I make.

These cookies are so addictive! I wanted to find a recipe like this for years! The only thing I changed, was that I used all butter. I always use butter, because I like the flavor better. They are soft and chewy, and they stay that way!

This is my favorite chocolate chip cookie recipe.  I make at least three batches at a time and i portion them out and freeze them.  So i can have cookies when ever i want with out having to spend the time to make them every single time.

There was one review that claimed the cookies to be hard.  I have never had that happen to me ever with this recipe.  I always got a soft cookie.

I'll make this short and sweet...these are excellent cookies. My new favorite!  I have been on a quest for the past few weeks to find the perfect chocolate chip cookie recipe and this is it.  The are not too flat, or greasy, or cake-like at all.  The outside is crunchy and the center is soft, just as promised. Simply delicious.

Pretty disappointing cookie. I followed the recipe exactly but they just tasted like flour.  The pale color was unappealing also.

I make the dough for this and Beth's other cookie recipes and freeze it to give as Christmas gifts. I use a cookie scoop and drop on a baking sheet and freeze 1-2 hours. Then put frozen dough in freezer zip bags. You can bake any flavor, mix and match right out of the  freezer. Just place on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper, bake for 13 minutes at 375 degrees. I found you really need to sift the flour then measure. Especially when making multiple batches. I was asked at Thanksgiving by several family members "your still making cookie dough for Christmas right!?!?!" Thanks Beth

I made these last night, and I think it's a good basic recipe. Like other reviewers, I used 3/4 c for the white & brown sugar. The only thing I changed was the amount of flour. I had measured out the 3.5 cups, but as I was mixing the batter it became apparent that it was way too much.  I think I ended up using about 2.75 cups of flour. The cookies have a wonderful flavor and are nice and chewy - exactly what I wanted in the recipe.

I just LOVE this recipe.  They taste like the ones my mom use to make.  Everyone can't get enough of these when I make them.  I never have to worry about them drying out because they are gone in a couple days. The ony thing I changed was I used reg crisco instead of butter.  This will be a recipe that I am sure will be handed down.  I has alreay been handed out many times

This recipe is amazing.  I have finally found my favorite chocolate chip cookie.  They came out perfect, the pictures dont do them justice.  I also added 1/4 tsp. almond extract for extra flavor.  I also used the swirled chocolate chips (milk chocolate and white chocolate swirled together in each chip).  They taste and look great. Be sure to use parchment paper.

I made these a second time after adjusting the amount of flour as I found them to be quite dry.....the change was to add 2 1/4 cups of flour instead of 3 1/2 and it worked perfectly for me!  If you like your cookies cake like then stick to the original recipe.  If you prefer them a bit chewier try less flour!  Either way, they are devine!  Thanks for a keeper.

I can not begin to understand how anyone could give these cookies a bad review!  They truly are wonderful.  The dough is a bit unusual though. It doesn't seem to come together but rather looks like a bunch of pebbles. Dont worry when you scoop out the dough all you have to do is slightly compress it into a ball(gently just until it takes shape.)  I typically make mine larger than a tablespoon.  Probably between 1 tablespoon and a 1/4 cup.  I like my cookies undercooked so I end up cooking them for the same amount of time the recipe calls for even though mine are larger.  The only other thing I do differently is to cut the choc. chips down to 1 cup.  Thats how my family likes their cookies.  Thanks Beth for the great recipe!!!!

I did not care for these cookies at all.  They were very thick and cake-like--I like my cookies moist and chewy.  Plus, they got stale extremely quickly.

Though the cookies were "good,"  they did not live up to the 5 star rating. They were ok warm out of the oven, but they didn't keep their fresh, soft taste very long.  Also, as another reviewer said, I would reduce the salt; I could definitely taste it in the cookie!
I would suggest the Award Winning Soft Choc. Chip cookie recipe from this site.

Wow! These are incredible. This recipe makes a ton of cookies, so prepare to spend some time baking them all. 10 minutes was a perfect cooking time to me. They are very buttery. So far, the best recipe I've tried for my husband's favorite dessert. I will keep this recipe forever.

Thank you Beth for such a wonderful recipe. This will most likely replace the recipe I've been using since 5th grade. Don't change a thing. They came out absolutely awesome. Soft and light, and just as good the day after. A+

Thick, chewy and yummy! These were very good. My 3 year old and I like to make cookies together and when she took her first bite, she smiled and said "I did a really good job. These are the best."
I didn't have any shortening and only used unsalted butter, they still turned out great!! Thanks!

The best! This is the one chocolate chip cookie recipe I turn to when I want to impress someone. I use a big cookie scoop when making these and bake them for 12 minutes and let them cool on the pans. They look like they're underdone when you pull them out of the oven but they are PERFECT-thick, soft and chewy once they cool. I frequently use half semisweet chips and half milk chocolate chips, but these come out fantastic any way you make them. Thanks so much!!

These cookies were the first thing I ever cooked from scratch and they actually turned out great. I, however, substituted oil for shortening, so they may have turned out better if I followed the recipe completely.

These turned out SO good. I made some soft and chewey by baking them for the min. amount of recommended time (These didn't stick around for more than a few days between my fiance and I but I think they would have stayed soft for a long time.) and some crunchy by baking them for the max. recommended time. I didn't have butter flavored shortening so I used a full cup of butter and 1/3 cup of shortening. I tried to make them stick around longer (which totally didn't work) by freezing a tray and they froze really well. They even had a great hard chewy texture a few mins out of the freezer. So the only thing that failed about this recipe was our lack of willpower. I don't think I'll ever use another choc. chip recipe.

VERY GOOD!  The dough is nice and thick, so if your mixer isn't a TOUGH one, make sure you don't burn up your motor and just mix by hand.  They're wonderful!

OK-These cookies were so perfect looking right out of the oven.  I think using half butter crisco and half regular butter makes for a perfect looking cookie-but as far as taste-using all regular butter makes the best chocolate chip cookie recipe. The taste was just OK on these.  All my cookie tasters agreed. For me the shortening overpowers the good sugar butter taste I love in my cookies.  But I would suggest using this recipe for all those who always have flat choc chip ccokies because they def wont be flat and they def have an OK taste.

Excellent cookies, my wife's name is Beth, so I had to try this recipe.  I've made them dozens of times, and my kids eat them all up, none left my me, unless I have fast fingers.

Hints:  Make sure all your ingredints are fresh, even the butter flavored shortening (the key ingredient) VERY IMPORTANT!  I leave out the pecans too.  

Thanks Beth Sigworth

My boyfriend said these cookies looked perfect - like they came right out of a box. They have a light crackle on top, soft chewy center and lightly crisp edge; however, I didn't think they tasted the best. They either needed to be more salty or sweet, but they are certainly worth a taste :)

This is just what I wanted. A slightly crisp, but chewy cookie that doesn't go flat when baking.  I added 1/2 cup of extra chips, but no other changes.  They were perfect!!  Thanks!

Very good cookie.  Beth always has the best recipes.  Of course you should never substitute butter for shortening, like one other reviewer did.  Shortening always gives a much more chewy texture to a cookie than butter.  Butter makes a dryer cookie, like shortbread.  The recipe is perfect just the way it is.

The BEST EVER  they don't last long at my house  It doesn't matter how many I make.  I never get close to 72 in one batch. I add a good heaping tablespoon of peanut butter  Good with milk chocolate and white chocolate and peanut butter chips all together in the same cookie............  heaven

Pretty good chocolate chip cookies.  I did end up using butter flavored crisco.  They are soft and fluffy.  Make sure you mix it well enough.  Plus they are not very sweet.

edit: I've been using this recipe for maybe six or seven years now and just can't beat it.  The only thing I've changed is using one egg instead of two for an even chewier texture.  I discovered that by accident when I wanted to make cookies but only had one egg.  That time I think its fair to say they were perfection.

As close to the "Perfect" chocolate chip cookie I've made yet.  These were as attractive as they were tasty! When they first came out of the oven they looked like they would be cakey, but after they cooled a few minutes, they looked perfect. These are really good cookies.  

p.s.  If you like something a little different, try using Kosher salt, you'll get little bits of salty sweetness......mmmmmmmmmmm delicious

These are the best choc. chip cookies I've tried from allrecipes.com.  They spread out just a bit and have a nice thickness to them.  

I've tried a lot of choc. chip cookie recipes that end up crunchy unless you eat them right out of the oven.  This cookie stays soft.  I just have to emphasize how nice and thick they are!  I don't like thin "pancake" cookies.  These are perfect.  They don't end up as "cookie mounds" or "pancakes."

These were great. I took them to work and about four people asked for the recipe. I did add 4 cups of flour instead of 3 1/2 to make them more cake-like, as I like a softer cookie, and I have had my cookies spread while baking in the past. I also used three types of chips: chocolate, white chocolate and butterscotch. Yum!

Are you trying to kill me? I made this recipe and make the cookies so big I only got about 2 dozen out of them.. Then I ate FIVE COOKIES in 2 hours. I couldn't help myself, these are SOOO good. I love you. Most cookies aren't so good without the chocolate, but I couldn't get enough of the cookie itself. Excellent.

Very good cookies.  I followed the recipe except for the baking time, as suggested by another reviewer I baked them for 7 to 8 minutes, then let them cool for about 5 minutes on the pan.  I didn't have any trouble with them. I'll add this recipe to my collection.

These are extremely cakelike nothing like the softness and chewiness described in reviews. Even when I used less flour. I was very disappointed. Especially after reading so many good reviews. I would not try this recipe again.

Used margarine instead of shortening, and it came out great!  I usually prefer flat cookies, but these have a great consistency--nice and light, chewy and not at all cake-like.  Store well for almost a week.  I've tried some other recipes, but this one turns out every time--I doubt I'll ever use another chocolate chip recipe again.  Thanks Beth!

Usually, when I see raves about "best ever" choc chip cookies, I prepare to be disappointed. Not this time. These cookies really are! Be careful not to overbake...take them out even when they still appear to be slightly undercooked. These are so good, I immediately did a search for Beth's other creations and found an oatmeal cookie and an orange frosted that i will try next!

This is the PERFECT chocolate chip cookie recipe. I experiemented with recipes for 3 years and still never got them quite like this. Chewy and not too firm and not too soft. Keeps its shape fabulously, with a thinly crispy edge, but not crunchy. And, most important to me, not cakey or greasy. I will never use another recipe again, and this is DEFINITELY not your toll house recipe. FABULOUS!

Another great cookie recipe from Beth!!  These are wonderful.  Bake longer if you like crispier cookies, or the regular time for chewy, softer.  I make two different batches of soft and crispy for my son & husband's different taste buds!  You'll love these!

Fabulous recipe! I am a novice cookie maker and the cookies came out chewy on the inside and crisp on the outside. My kids helped me make them. Once you eat these homemade chocolate chip cookies, you won't care to eat a store-bought chocolate chip cookie! Thank you, Beth!

These cookies were just as moist, fluffy and chewy as everyone has claimed.  At the suggestion of another reviewer, I used 1 cup of butter and 1/3 cup of shortening (regular, because I didn't have butter flavor) and they still turned out very nicely.  The ONLY reason I'm giving this recipe 4 stars instead of 5 is because I thought a tablespoon of vanilla was a bit too much.  Next time I make these, I'll use 1 1/2 tsp. vanilla and maybe 1/4 cup less white sugar.  All in all, though, this is a delicious recipe, and my sister likes them better than Tollhouse!

As far as taste goes they aren't anything spectacular.  The one thing that made me save this recipe is that the cookies did not come out flat for once!  The dough seemed kind of oily and the chocolate chips didn't mix in thoroughly.  All in all it's not a bad recipe but it wasn't what I was hoping for either.

Way to go Beth!  These are one of the BEST!!! For those that have had trouble with this recipe just be sure to measure the butter and butter flavor crisco correctly!!I almost put in too much, these are MUCH BETTER than the toll house recipe thanks for sharing!!!

These cookies were awesome.  I usually make tollhouse but they are always flat and crunchy.  My 4 year old told me they (tollhouse) weren't good because they weren't soft.  These were nice and soft and puffy.  He loved them.  I substitued regular crisco because I didn't have the butter flavored but they were still wonderful.  Thank you.

These cookies were amazing! I added chopped walnuts and without them, I don't think they'd be as good. I didn't have shortening, so I used 2 sticks of margarine and it was just fine! The recipe was unclear about what size measuring spoon, so I used the tablespoon, flattened them a bit, and got wonderful 1 1/2" cookies! I do think 10 minutes is too long; about 6 minutes should do it. Overall, they were fantastic and I'd bake them again.

These cookies are fabulous!  I too, used regular shortening and had great results.  After reading the other reviews I was a little nervous about them drying out, so I kept them sealed in Tupperware with a barely damp paper towel, and they stayed moist and chewy.  I made mine a little larger and ended up with 4 dozen, but they looked and tasted just like those big delicious bakery cookies!  Thanks for such a wonderful recipe!

I've been searching for the perfect chocolate chip cookie, and this is it!
I used regular shortening instead of butter flavored and they still turned out chewy and delicious.

Super Recipe!  I made them with regular shortening, not butter flavored, and used a medium-size cookie scoop.  They turned out great!  This recipe is a keeper!

Wow, amazing cookies, my family were all pleased with the cookies, including me. Soft and chewy in the middle and deliciously crunchy on the outside. The dough did taste flowery at first but turned out to be just what the cookie needed! Again, amazing cookie and this is the only chocolate chip cookie recipe that I will ever be using.

This was my first time ever making homemade chocolate chip cookies so I wanted an easy recipe that was sure to come out good.  With a few tweaks this was that recipe!  I halved the recipe and there was definitely too much flour.  To remedy this I added approximately 2-3 Tbsp's of vegetable oil to the finished dough.  Got a good arm workout but the dough turned out great!  While preparing I also added approximately 1 Tsp cinnamon and 2 Tsp mayonnaise.  The finished cookies are AMAZING!  Now I just hope I can duplicate this next week for Santa!  ;)

I loved this cookie! I did however omit the shortening, added a tad extra butter, finely chopped pecans, dried cranberries, and cut down the salt. They took a really long time to cook through. I'd say 20 min per batch. I watched them closely and waited until the tops were nice and brown.

The best chocolate chip cookie recipe ever. My son likes them with a dash of cinnamon and some white chocolate chips mixed with chocolate chips.  They are perfect just as the recipes directs also. I watch them closely as they bake as they are best when baked just enough and not too much.

I've tried this recipe over and over and it has never failed me.  My kids love it.. and I've tried a bunch, trying to find something like my grandma's.. this is it!!  I can't even screw it up.. although the only change I ever make is the candies I drop in instead of chocolate chips.  Stick to the recipe..

These cookies are so-o-o good.. I just finished making them and am chewing on one at this moment. I have made LOTS of chocolate chip cookies over the years and am always looking for the best one. Well, this is it. I think it's important to use quality chocolate chips, real vanilla and butter when making cookies. I did increase the vanilla to 2+ Tablespoons, but everything else was as stated in the recipe. Now if I can keep my hubby out of the dough!!! Thanks for sharing this recipe.

Too much flour for the amount of "butter". Too much vanilla.  Also, add 1/4 tsp of cinnamon for a truly distinctive flavoring.  It doesn't overpower the taste, just really adds to it.

This is now my go-to recipe for chocolate chip cookies... I can bake ANYTHING, but have never had luck with chocolate chip cookies (until now) despite trying many different recipes. This recipe is a bit floury, and I always add a splash of milk to the dough after adding the flour, if it is a bit too dry. If not using a stand mixer, it's been absolutely necessary. With a mixer, just a bit of milk was needed. These cookies turn out with the perfect soft/chewy consistency, excellent flavor, and overall are just a fantastic cookie. I receive positive feedback from everyone who samples them! Thanks for posting this recipe; I'll be keeping it forever!

Love these cookies!! All-time favorite!
I use regular flavored shortening but otherwise don't modify the recipe at all!
I do watch closely to not overcook.
In humid places I have to smash the cookies down otherwise they won't flatten out! The exact OPPOSITE problem I've ever had before :)

These were fabulous!  It is easy to overcook them, but I pulled mine out at 9 minutes and they came out great.  They seemed undone in the middle, until they cooled all the way.  Yum!

This recipe is delicious! We have been using the same recipe for years, since we received it from my Mother-in-law! We use walnuts instead of pecans but will definately be trying the pecans. We receive requests for cookies at every event we attend. They are very tasty, chewy and melt in your mouth. The very best recipe in my opinion!

I didn't have shortening, so I used all butter. Besides that, I followed the recipe exactly. It was DELICIOUS! These will definitely be a regular. (I only cooked mine for 6 minutes and they turned out perfectly.)

These cookies are awesome.  I have made them countless times and am known for "my" chocolate chip cookies, though the recipe isn't mine at all and I happily refer people here.  These cookies are packed with chocolate and soft as can be.  They DO need to be removed before they brown, so you need to keep a close eye, but the flavor is out of this world.  I wonder if they nay sayers are subsituting regular shortening for the butter flavored- that would make a large difference.  These are yummy!  Don't change a thing about the recipe and try Beth's other recipes- she's the cookie queen in my book!

Love this recipe. It seems like if I just used butter my cookies flattened, if I used plain crisco, they didn't taste right. This recipe combines the best of both of them and makes a fantastic cookie!

This is one of the best cookie recipes ever! I have been useing it for about four years & cookies are great every time. You have to know the basics of making cookies, for example: if you dont use soften butter & melt it all the way your cookies will come out flat & hard, mix all dry ingredients in a separate bowl & sift together then mix in a little flour at a time to make sure it mix's well with the wet ingredients & last but not least when you bake them you have to watch them & take them out the moment you see the top looking like they are cracking, they will look undone but they will turn out perfect!

I made these with just a couple adjustments made. I didn't have buttered flavored shortening, so I just added a little extra butter to make up for that. I also used two parts semi sweet chips and one part milk chocolate chips. I splt the recipe and made half with vanilla and the other half with amaretto - no real difference there. I left out the pecans as well as we are not nut people! I took them to my office and everyone just loves them! They taste great and look great. Best my cookies have every risen! I definitely recommend this recipe!

Wow, these are good. Moist and tender cookie, but chewy too. I ate too many just sampling 1, and so did my husband. He finally said, "get those sway from me!" Dangerously good. This made a large batch too. I've already baked 2 dozen and it doesn't look like I am even halfway through the dough. I may end up freezing it for later use because there is just us to eat all these cookies... not that I'm complaining.

I think it's a good basic chocolate chip cookie. I tried this reciepe instead of my normal pudding ones because I wanted to try something new. I added a third egg to the reciepe and with crisco if you add 2 tablespoons of water it makes it more buttery. I did this and I also added just a bit more vanilla.

The only change I made was to add about 1/4 tsp Almond Extract. I don't know why other reviewers have said that the cookies are like a 'golf ball'. I baked them for 9 minutes and they came out AMAZINGLY. My husband and company loved them!

Ive been baking for YEARS. This is the best cookie batch I have ever made. I always read reviews before starting. After reading the cookie turns out hard. I lowered the baking temp to 365 and bake for 10 min. I then let them cool on the pan for 5 min.  Also melt the butter in microwave (only butter). I used a full teaspoon on dough on pan. Perfect chewy cookie. Oh and I added 1 cup semi chips and 1 cups white choc chips :)
Thanks

There are a lot of mixed reviews on this cookie... if your style is a cakey, dry, flour-tasting chocolate chip cookie then this is the recipe for you. I couldn't even get the ingredients to stick together enough to form a cookie on my pan. What a waste of ingredients!

My favorite chocolate chip cookies! I took others advise and added the mayo. I haven't tried them without it so I don't know the difference with or without the mayo. AMAZING! Thanks for the recipe!

I didn't like these much at all. I made the recipe exactly as written.  They didn't seem to 'set' too well but more so stayed in the ball shape I put them in the pan....Not making these again.

These cookies are so very delicious! These are very chocolatey. Although, I didn't find them chewy. Mine were cakey. I don't know if I did something wrong. I used wheat flour so maybe that caused it? I'm not sure. I didn't have a whole cup of brown sugar so I used my 3/4 of a cup and they turned out fine. I lengthened the time to 14 mintues, after 14 mintues they were absoluetly done.

These are my new staple chocolate chip cookies. They stay thick, fluffy and gooey which is exactly what I look for in a cookie! The dough is hard and dense when you're mixing it though. My KA mixer could barely handle it towards the end. I did add the teaspoon of mayo before the dry ingredients. Worked wonders!

This was the best chocolate cookie recipe I have ever made! Replaced shortening with plain butter. The texture for making the cookies was perfect. And the finished cookies were amazing - they plumped up in the middle, light and crunchy - wow!

I made these to take to some old college friends I was visiting last weekend.  They were delicious!!  Everyone loved them.  Other recipes I have used yielded very flat, crispy cookies, but these were just perfect.  One modification- next time I would use a few less chocolate chips, because by the time I reached the bottom of the bowl, I had more chocolate chips than dough left!  Otherwise, the cookies tasted great, and I will definitely use this recipe again!

I cut this recipe in half and thought that the dough was really dry.  Then I realized that I forgot to add the shortening, and had only added 1/3 cup butter.  Too late - cookies are already in the oven and baked up just fine.  I added crushed pretzel M and M's to give them that salty/sweet combination, and they were soooooo good.  I am thinking about doing this one again - remembering the shortening this time, and just adding some crushed pretzels along with the chocolate chips.

This is my favorite recipe for chocolate chip cookies. Ever.  I've been using it for years and just made a batch this week and wondered why I've never reviewed here. They are thick and soft, and the mix of shortening and butter gives the maximum results for both texture and flavor.

Can't beat this recipe as far as I'm concerned!  I use this as a base for all kinds of cookies . . . various chips, monster, oatmeal, etc.  The only thing I don't like is that they tend to get dry after a few days.  I usually store them in the freezer after the first day to maintain just-baked freshness.

The texture and shape is perfect.  The flavor is lacking though. I'm not sure what it needs. I prefer the awardwinningly soft choc chip cookies on this site.

I made these for the first time last winter when a friend visited with his kids - they're real city kids with busy working parents and we live out in the 'countryside' here in Norway. I wanted to give them that country cabin feeling when they arrived and thought what's better than the smell of home-baked choc chip cookies wafting through the air...esp. to kids! Their eyes lit up when they were treated to these cookies and they were even more delighted when I packed some for their trip home. I enjoyed them more than the kids though...hehe...fantastic with a glass of cold milk. I can imagine making these with my daughter when she grows out of those nappies!

If there is anyone who did not love these cookies the first time they made them, then they DO NOT KNOW WHAT THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT!!!!  They're fantastic, and I have requests all of the time to bake them for any function that we go to.  
Maybe some people didn't read or follow the recipe correctly.  If made exactly the way the recipe reads, these chocolate chip cookies are the BEST EVER!!  Thanks so much for this recipe!!!

I made these almost exactly as Beth's recipe stated. The only thing I had to change was that I used dark brown sugar as that's what I had in the pantry and I added a tsp. of mayonaise as another reviewer suggested. I added some chocolate and peanut-butter swirl chips besides the semi-sweet chips, just because I had them. I baked them for 8 minutes, then let them cool on the pans for 2 minutes 30 seconds. They came out crunchy on the outside and perfectly soft and chewy on the inside. I'll be using this recipe again. 
Thanks Beth. I always ended up adding another 1/4 cup of flour or so to the Toll House recipe just to keep the cookies from going flat as they baked. Yours recipe is better.

i thought these cookies were only mediocre. what bothered me the most was the overwhelmingly eggy taste of the cookie. it also wasn't chewy despite having cooled it on the cookie sheet and taking the cookies out before they looked "done". i prefer the tollhouse recipe from this site.

Do NOT overbake,  you'll think they can't possibly be finished, It took me three pans to realize they were really soft I was just over baking them.  pull them out VERY VERY soft and they'll stay that way. these were very easy and delicious, i changed it a little by adding 1 tsp. orange extract along with the vanilla. the orange kicked the chocolate flavor from everyday to snooty cafe acceptable!

My nephews rate this recipe 7 stars. (That's what they said they wanted to rate it). They turned out delicious. We used margarine instead of butter. They were soft in the middle and crispy on the outside. Excellent!

I've made this recipe twice now, and both times it's made fantastic soft-centred cookies. I really like the proportion of flour in the recipe (though another reviewer didn't) -- I'm not a fan of oily, spready chocolate chip cookies. Like most cookie recipes, I find the yield to be much higher than the actual (we all know big cookies are better). I would definitely cut back on the salt by half, especially if you're using salted butter. I may just try adding a bit of oat flour next time to see if I can get them a bit chewier, but overall a big hit with me.

As far as taste goes, you can't go wrong with this recipe.  My first batch turned out flat as others have mentioned, so I was a bit dissappointed until I tasted them.  It certainly did not affect the taste!  They were delicious.  I added 1cup more flour to the second batch I made for guests and they turned out perfectly.  I got nothing but rave reviews!!  Excellent recipe!

I finally found a GREAT recipe! I did not have butter flavored shortening, but regular seemd to turn out just fine. I also used walnuts instead of pecans. These came out soft & chewy out of the oven. I found they did need to be tightly wrapped, or they became a bit more crunchy, but still very tasty! I just prefer a softer cookie! This recipe will now be a STAPLE in my house! These lasted ONE day in my house!I am going to wrap these up for teacher gifts next week!!!

Attention Chocolate Chip Cookie lovers. This is, by far, the best recipe I've tried for CC cookies in a long while. I followed the recipe exactly and baked up cookies with a perfect crunch to soft ratio. Give these a try.

UPDATE: I have now moved on to a different cookie recipe.  The stale problem that I mentioned earlier bothered me too much after a couple of batches, so now I'll continue my search for the perfect chocolate chip cookie recipe!
This is my new go-to recipe for chocolate chip cookies - I get rave reviews from friends and family when I make them.  I recommend making them with the white & semi-sweet swirl chips.  The only drawback, as another reviewer stated, is that they go stale quickly (my husband didn't notice, but I did).  The recipe does make a big batch of dough, so I freeze the dough and bake as needed, to avoid having dozens of stale cookies.

The best chocolate chip recipe I have ever found. They are the perfect texture for my taste, crispy on the outside, chewy in the middle. The kids love 'em and I had to put them away or they would have been eaten in a few minutes! Great recipe...thanks, Beth!

Deeelicious. I didn't have butter or butter flavoured chrisco so I substituted for 1 cup I can't believe its not butter & 1/3 cup regular shortening. It still turned out the way I expected soft & chewy. Yum Yum!!

I have to say, these are the most PERFECT cookies I've ever made...

I changed the recipe to all shortening [sub it in for the butter] and I haven't put in pecans... but it works WONDERS... and you can toss in almost anything instead of the chocolate chips... [M&Ms, other candy bars chopped up, nuts... IT WORKS PERFECTLY!!]

Excellent! Just like Subway cookies! Kids had fun helping with the whole process too. Only draw back was that they didn't taste as good the next day - could have just been my taster because it didn't stop everyone from eating them for days afterwards!

Ahh...chocolate chip cookies. They are like banana (nut) bread...lots of good recipes out there, but everyone has their own personal preference. I used trans-fat free Crisco because that's what I had. I also used mini-chips since I had those. The dough was TO DIE FOR!!! I could have been happy just eating it. (but I guess you're not supposed to) I halved the recipe so as not to gain TOO much weight! I'm not sure if this is my favorite recipe, but it is definitely in the top 3!!! A word of warning: you MUST watch these. My first batch got a little too brown after only 10 minutes. Check on them after 7 minutes just to be safe. Take them out when they still seem a little underdone. Enjoy!

These cookies were excellent!  The only change that I made was to use all butter instead of the butter/shortening mix.  Very good cookies and this will be the only recipe that I use from now on.  Thanks Beth :-)

Good, my family loved them.  I think next time I'll bake them at a lower temperature though, they seemed to bake a bit fast, making them a little too crunchy for my taste.

After trying many recipes for chocolate chip cookies with many disappointments, this one was finally a success. My daughter gobbled down three before I could stop her! I substituted half the flour with whole wheat flour and the cookies turned out great. They make really good gaint cookies too. Thank you so much for sharing this recipe, I was beginning to think I would never be able to make wonderful chocolate chip cookies.

These were incredible!  That first bite was so reminiscent of cookies I had eaten another time--perhaps a past life!  Excellent.  My spouse did not say if she liked them or not, however, she did not complain, nor were there any left within 24 hours!  Thanx so much!  The shortening was the key in this By the way, if you like these, try "Award Winning Soft Chocolate Chip Cookies" from this site also.

This recipe was awesome.  I have tried many ccc recipes over the years, but this one is the best I've had in a long time.  A classic cookie.  Simple and unadorned.  The only thing I might try next time is milk chocolate chips, but that's only because my family prefers them over semi-sweet.  Thanks for the great recipe.  Definitely a keeper!

followed the recipe exactly. I don't know what happened. They ended up really dry and didn't melt at all during baking. They kept their ball shape the entire 10 minutes. The flavor was what I was looking for, but the texture was certainly not. It must be some wierd fluke, but it still didn't turn out for me.

While the texture is great for these cookies they were very bland I added more vanilla which helped a little, the idea of using kosher salt would probably add to the flavour.  I will not be making again.

I am just a novice, and currently have messed up the past 5 desserts I have tried to make, bu these were great!  I halved the recipe and made them larger cookies and added about 1/4 cup a more sugar b/c I am a sugar fiend.  Everybody loved them and said to please make again.  Thank you so much for redeeming me!  Haha!

This is the best chocolate chip cookie recipe I have ever tried. Followed the recipe exactly--(I omitted the pecans and added 1/2 cup extra chocolate chips).
The butter flavored shortening(Crisco) is the key to the wonderful flavor.

These cookies are amazing, thank you so much. I am not sure how any chocolate chip cookie lover could ever not like these. my two and four year old sneak them all day long. I followed the recipe to the tee they were chewy and soft and soo buttery. Hint you need to get your hands dirty to mix dry and wet and that is the secret to the pefrect cookie.

These were really good....there is no shortening where I am so I made them only with butter....and I used smarties instead of chocolate chips but they were really good!!!!  Everyone loved the texture...a smidgin crispy on the bottom and delightfully chewy on the inside...mmmm....this one is a keeper!

I hate being the bad review in a mess of good ones but these cookies turned out ... horrible. I followed the recipe exactly and they turned out salty! I melted butter and added sugar to the batter. That took care of the salt problem, but i was left with a disgusting after taste. The cookies were extremely hard, and my guests didnt like them. I guess i probably won't make these again. Try these cookies anyway, they worked for a lot of people, i guess i'm not one of them.

It's all about how you mix the ingredients!  I can't believe how many reviews I read that say the dough/cookies were so dry or cakey.  I have made these cookies so many times, and every time I make them they are soft, chewy, not too flat, and certainly not cakey.  *Here's the trick: Use an ELECTRIC mixer to CREAM the butter, shortening, and sugars, and eggs.  Then later, when all of the ingredients have been combined, use your HANDS to really get in that dough and work it well, like you're a kid again and playing with mud.  Or better yet, let your kids do it!  It's all about melding the ingredients!  They won't turn out dry or cakey if the dough is mixed well!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

This is the only chocolate chip cookie recipe I will use from now on.  It is chewy on the inside and crispy on the outside.  I made slightly larger cookies (which still yielded over 3 dozen) so I had to reduce the oven temperature and bake for a little longer.  These are fantastic!

These are awesome! Just two suggestions-bake on parchment paper and store the cooled cookies in a ziplock freezer bag with 1/2 slice of bread. They will be as wonderful as when tasting them right from the oven!

I didn't like these cookies very much. When I was making the dough I became a little worried because it was very dry and crumbly. I couldn't get them to cook right either. They didn't flatten very well and they burned (definitely didn't look like the picture). I think I'll try another recipe next time.

Not as soft and chewy as I had hoped for... The beginning of the batch turned out much better than the last few.  Delicious, though!  Definitely made for MILK...Definitely...

Good reviews from my coworkers, family, and classmates of my children.  Some asked if they were actually made from scratch or if I cheated and bought from a store/bakery.  I'll keep this recipe!

This is a really good cookie recipe.  Unfortunately the cookies did not stay soft after they came out of the oven as I thought they would.  Other than that they were really good.

Excellent, as all of Beth Sigworth's recipes apparently are!  This recipe produced wonderfully yummy, soft chewy cookies. My boyfriend raved.  Definitely a keeper! And for anyone reading this - if you haven't tried her Oatmeal cookie recipe, check it out - they are to die for!

I wasn't found of these at all. The taste was good but the texture was very unappealing. Like other reviewers have said these are very cakey. My kids love to dip cookies in milk and that is impossible with these as they litterally just fall apart in milk. I won't be making these again.

This is exactly what I was looking for in the perfect chocolate chip cookie! These cookies have a sugar-crisp outside and soft chewy middle. The color and shape are both worthy of a bakery shelf...I made the recipe exactly as is, except I used 1 C. shortening and 1/3 C. butter and I would not do that again b/c the cookies lose some flavor...stick with the original measurements for best taste!! Also, I baked the cookies for exactly 8 minutes to keep them soft in the middle. Great recipe-thanks!

These did turn out to be rather cakey in texture, which disappointed me.  I followed the recipe to the letter, and the cookies are good, but they are definitely not the chewy cookies I expected though they are soft and moist.

Hands down, one of the best chocolate chip cookie recipes there is.  Followed the recipe as is, and wallah!  Nice thick, beautiful cookies with slightly crispy edges and wonderfully soft and slightly chewy insides- I didn't think they were really cakey.  I like that they're not thin, gooey and underdone in the center like the Tollhouse cookies. Got comments like "you could sell these"!  Also tried them with 1 C choc chips and 1 C chopped toffee- also good.  I don't understand what happened to the people that ended up with hockey pucks- these were easy and came out consistently good- twice. Thanks a million Beth!

REALLY good recipe!  These are not too sweet, bake up high and fluffy too.  I used Ghirardelli semi-sweet chocolate chips to make them a little more special. :-D  There are the best chocolate chip cookies I've ever made.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

Excellent recipe!  I did roll two batches for uniformity and they turned out fine, the centers were done.  these are a sturdier cookie than the traditional Toll House recipe, which is nice for storing, packing and putting in tins for gift-giving.  They don't have the chewy-gooey factor quite like the Toll House do but honestly, the fact that they stay in one piece and taste just as good if not better...well, this is my new standard.

These cookies are amazing! I have been using this recipe for about 2 years now and everyone knows about my chocolate chip cookies! I use this dough for almost every type of cookie I make now, like M&M, white chocolate and pecan, or just about anything you can think of!! Thanks Beth!!

I made this last night to satisfy a late night craving. They came out soft and chewy and delicious.  The dough was not dry as others have suggested.  The key here is method.  make sure you cream the butter and sugar well so there are no lumps. Add the eggs one at a time and add the flour in 3 groups.  The only small changes I made to the recipe was to use more butter than shortening (1 cup and 1/3 cup) and I added a touch of cinnamon for spice.  Thanks Beth.

Perfect!  This is the recipe I was looking for...  not a super sweet cookie, not too flat, not too crunchy around the edges or gooey in the middle.  I used about 1 1/2 c chocolate chips and added 3/4 cup white chocolate.  I did use the pecans.  Thank You!

These cookies are phenomenal!  I've been searching for the perfect chocolate chip cookie recipe for years, and I've finally found it.  They rise nicely, and are big and soft.  Awesome.

I am a HUGE chocolate chip cookie fan, but I'm also a very picky one. Over the last few months I have found myself trying almost a dozen different recipes trying to fine one that blew me away, THIS IS THAT RECEIPE!  I have thrown out so many batches frustrated w/ their turn out, but one taste of these cookies and I was elated.  They are fabulous, thank you for submitting this recipe Elizabeth!

I read some of the reviews to get an idea of what to expect. I noticed some found the mix dry, so I made certain to spend extra time creaming the fats and sugars, then added the eggs one at a time, to ensure a creamy mix. Then I added the flour mixture a little at a time to be sure it didn't get too dry. These are really great cookies! I will definitely be making these again!

I was very dissappointed.  The cookies did not flatten out and had a odd taste (like chemicals).  Maybe too much flour & too much baking soda?  I will not make again.

Wow!  These are just as good as all the other raters said!  I increased the butter by 2 tablespoons and used 1/2 white chips and 1/2 semisweet!  These are awesome!!!  And I made them yesterday and they are just as good today!  Be careful not to overcook as I can see how if you did, they might be dry the next day!

This is the ONLY choc. chip recipe I've ever made that was just right.  It's not too cake-like, doesn't flatten out.  Soft in the middle and a little crispy around it's irregular edges.  This cookie looks and tastes very homemade.  Thanks Beth.

WoW! These are the best chocolate chip cookies I have ever made! Beth-you know your stuff! This is the third recipe of yours I've tried and it's the best. To make the cookies extra soft I added a packet of dry instant vanilla pudding mix. These are much better than award winning soft chocolate chip cookies.

These were fantastic! Thank you Beth! Crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside. Previous comments indicated that they turn very hard the next day. I did not find this to be true. I packed them in tupperware dishes and they kept very well for several days.
Instead of just chips, I substituted whole pieces of fine milk and white chocolate and pecans.

I was expecting an incredible cookie based on all the reviews, but we were very disappointed in these cookies.  They were wonderful the first day, but that's as long as they lasted.  By day two, they were rock hard and inedible.  I guess if you only need them for one day, this would be the perfect recipe, but I'll keep looking.  These cookies won't be made again in this house.

This is probably the most "perfect looking" cookie I have ever made.  They came out looking like Famous Amos cookies, which someone had mentioned before.  The taste was wonderful.  The only reason I didn't give the cookie 5 stars was because it became hard the following day.

These cookies were not the best in my opinion, they weren't that bad, but they just don't have the "buttery" taste you get when you use all butter and I found that they got rock hard after a couple of day's which kinda ruins them in my opinion because then they get thrown away because no one want's to eat them. I most likely won't make them again. The weren't the worst cookes I've ever had, they just weren't the best.

Another winner from "Mrs. Sigg"!!!  I substituted walnuts for the pecans, and added an extra 1/2 cup chocolate chips, and they turned out perfect!!  I use a pampered chef baking stone, and the cookies did take an extra couple of minutes in the oven.  These are good warm out of the oven, and are just as good the next day after they've cooled!  Thanks so much Beth!!!

Excellent! I was looking for a recipe that made a cookie with depth, not a flat cookie.  This recipe is perfect.  I shaped the dough into a log on wax paper, rolled it up and froze it. I unrolled the wax paper and cut the cookies into slices about 1/4" thick and then cut each slice in half.  The mixture of butter and shortening is the key.

This is THE choclolate chip cookie recipe.  I was looking for a chocolate chip cookie that would not get flat and that still tasted good several days later and this is definately it.  They freeze well also if they last that long.

The dough for this recipe is dry. The cookies come out more like cake, they don't spread much. Their not your typical chocolate chip cookie, but are tasty and great with some milk.

I thought these cookies were excellent.  I have been making Tollhouse originals for 12 years and I never varied.  Now, I will be making these instead.  The recipe went right into my file with an A next to it.

Sorry....it was too bland, cake like and not chewy. It may be better with less flour but I won't be trying it again. I prefer the basic Tollhouse recipe. This one tasted more like a bread than a cookie.

Absolutely wonderful cookies! Though not as chewy as I normally like, I will forego my preference in favor of the awe-inspiring taste! I bake cookies quite often and have tried well over fifty different recipes, and this recipe is definitely the best! You can't go wrong with sheer deliciousness.

WOW! I have made a lot of chocolate chip cookies in my days, but these are by far the best.  They turn out perfectly.  They are super with or without pecans.  I am so excited to finally have the greatest choc. chip recipe in all the land!  Thank you Beth:)
P.S. I used real butter, what has everyone else tried and liked?

These cookies are awesome--they came out perfectly!  I was a little skeptical of them staying chewy instead of getting crunchy, but these did! *clapping* I will never make a different chocolate chip cookie recipe again.  These were just perfect--not cake-like at all, not too crispy.  I am definitely going to try more of Beth Sigworth's recipes!

My husband said these are the best chocolate chip cookies I have ever made!  After making the dough, I put it in the freezer for about 1-1/2 hours.  I then put the dough on the cookie sheets in thick 2" x 2" circles (rather than drops).  The consistency and flavor were perfect, with a baking time of 10 minutes.  Wow!

Beth's cookies rock! These chocolate chip cookies are great....followed the recipe but used a bag of mini morsels instead of the regular ones..everyone loved them. This recipe makes a hefty amount of cookies...great for sharing with family and co-workers. Will make again very soon...cant wait to try Beth's orange cookies next. I've been a die-hard for her cookie recipes! Thanks Beth!

Thanks Beth.....these cookies are fantastic!!!
Lightly crispy at the eges, and sooo soft in the middle.  They  got the thumbs up from everyone who tried them.  My co-workers all want your recipe. I was tired of my 'flat' tollhouse cookies, and I'm so glad I found your recipe!

My husband liked this although i find them a bit too cakey. I was looking for something that's chewy. I don't think i would try this again.

I love how these stay raised but I don't think it makes a difference whether you use pecan or walnut.  I gave it a 4-star rating only because it's still good but I prefer the actual Neiman Marcus Cookie($250.00 recipe that I found online). I make that NM one all the time whether the story is true or not, they are still the best I've ever come across.

We love these cookies! I have a variety of cookie recipes, but my husband now only asks for these. The pecans really make the difference. Be sure not to overbake-- these are perfect and soft when you take them out right on time or even a little early. Wonderful!

WONDERFUL!  I used my air bake cookie sheets and cooked for 12 minutes.  These are definitely the BEST chocolate chip cookies I've ever made!! Thank you so much for sharing!!  And my 20 month old son had a tantrum to have a second one, so I'd say that "Kids love them too!"  :)

I made these cookies today as a treat for my 12 year old that just got her braces on today. They passed my test as soon as I took them out of the oven,  but I had to make sure they passed the most important test....my children!! They loved them.
I had always made the tollhouse cookies but they always came out so flat. Love the way these didn't competely collapse & the taste was great.
I used a small ice-cream scoop (about a tablespoon) and baked them for 8 minutes exactly.
They came out nice & brown on the bottom but chewy inside. Thanks for the recipe its a keeper around here.

This has been the absolute best chocolate chip cookie i've tasted in a while!  They came out perfect....soft and chewy just as described.  My family couldn't keep their hands off it!  I had to hide some of them just to get any.  I'll be making these from now on.  I've never known a cookie to be so good until now.  I love all your recipes and each time I try a new one it never fails to amaze me how delicious everything turns out!

I dough is drier than I am use to (not the easiest cookie to spoon out)...and make sure not to overbake! I took mine out a minute early and left them on the baking sheet for 2 minutes. We love them and have made them numerous times.

I have always used the tollhouse recipe and was ready to try something new since although tollhouse is a good cookie, they always seemed to be kinda greasy and flat - and presentation counts too!! So.... my tollhouse recipe has been trashed and this is the ONLY chocolate chip recipe I'll be using from now on!! Beautiful, puffy, bumpy cookies that looked just as good as they tasted.  Took them to a Christmas party at work, and they recieved rave reviews. Thanks for sharing this excellent recipe!!!

I have been long searching for a soft, thick, chewy chocolate chip cookie--alas, my search is over.  These are the best chocolate chip cookies that I have ever tasted.  They are a big hit in our house.  Thanks Beth!  I keep the cookies in tupperware with a slice of bread in the container and this helps them stay soft for over four days.

Wow, Beth, just simply a delicious cookie!  We loved Mrs. Sigg's Snickerdoodles that you shared so I'm so glad I searched for more of your recipes. In reading other reviews on this recipe, it seems that no matter what you do, they are still great.  I thought I had everything but didn't realize that you called for sweetened butter so I used unsalted and substituted walnuts for pecans since that's what I had.  My DH is taking the majority to our grandchildren and they will be happy campers tonight!  It's wonderful to find a truly soft and chewy chocolate chip cookie.  Thanks!

I omitted the shortening, and added a teaspoon or tablespoon of baking powder, which made it puff up (I like my cookies puffy and chewy). Easy to make and prepare. Great with the pecans.

Excellent cookie.  Soft, moist, pretty fluffy.  Brought an instant smile to the face of the first person that tried it.  I used regular vegetable oil in place of butter flavored shortening, and regular unsalted butter instead of sweet.  I also made a bigger cookie; using the full recipe I ended up with 45 cookies.  Nice texture, excellent flavor.

This recipe was o.k 
Im a beginner so I wanted somethingeasy but yet good. on an easy scale of 1-10 they are a 8.I tried shaping them into balls. They tasted o.k. My second batch I flattened them out much betterI think. These cookies are some of the best i've had.With a little help andadjustments these cookies can definately be good.

Nice and moist. Cook for five minutes less than time advised. I added almond extract, gave the cookies a nice nutty flavour! Jim and the grandchildren love this recipe.

Finally, a cookie recipe that works for all of us who can't cook! I was a bit leery about making these cookies when the recipe didn't call for instant pudding, but called for butter flavored shortening & a large amount of flour. However, these were probably the best cookies I have ever made in my life. (And that's saying something since I am a natural disaster when it comes to baking;). They were so soft and flavorful. And the only things I changed was using unflavored shortening and dark chocolate chips instead. I wouldn't even know the difference!

I made a few additions, but a great base recipe!  The DEFINITE change I made was lowered the heat.....375 is way too hot...I lowered to 325.  I do not like over-cooked bottoms.

This has been my go-to chocolate chip cookie recipe for several years now! I’ve never had any issues and have gotten nothing but rave reviews!! My favorite is to do 1 cup chocolate chips and 1 cup chopped Reese’s peanut butter cups ?? whatever you decide to mix in, you can’t go wrong!

I made this on the 12th of April and I’m writing this review the very next day. These cookies are really good but I wouldn’t call them chocolate chip cookies more like sugar cookies. I made these for my husbands job and EVERYONE loved them! The only reason I gave it a 4 is because they don’t taste like chocolate chip cookies.

I made two versions of this recipe, one using shortening and butter and one using just butter. They were both good, but the all-butter cookies are a cut above, so I recommend that. I used European-style butter. I also added the tsp of mayo that some reviewers have recommended and replaced the nuts with extra chocolate chips. I also used Mexican vanilla because I love the flavor. Finally, I lightly sprinkled the cookies with pink Himalayan sea salt before baking, and I think it's the perfect touch. These cookies are soft and chewy and wonderful. I baked at 375 for 8-9 minutes depending on size (I used an ice cream scoop but alternated between half-scoops and whole-scoops).

i can make Chips Ahoy! the recipes is perfect! we follow the process from beginning to the end. the cookies is not too sweet or salty. When the cookies just out the oven, even the cookies are soft, we start eating.
 The only thing I don't understand is why we should use fork to press the cookies???

Loved it!  Best recipe I've found in years.  It's saved to my favourites.  Of course, it depends what consistency you are looking for.  I like the thick cookies that stay soft.  This is the perfect recipe.  (But I cut the white sugar in half)

soooo good!  I'm only 8 1/2 years old.  My sister and my mom helped me make these.  We only used 3 cups of flour.  We used half butter and half coconut oil.   The cookies turned out awesome.  Nice and soft on the inside and crunchy on the sides.  They baked wonderfully.  We used a scoop and did not flatten them. They spread out just right for a "flat" cookie.  They turned out AMAZING!!!!!

Just right, (as is) recipe. Perfect blend of crunch and chew. They were as good left out till the next day as they were right from the oven. 
Next time I will leave out the chips and coat half  of each cookie with chocolate. Win/win either way.

My new favorite! This ain't yo momma's Toll House mediocrity. This is a quality cookie. Crispy edges, chewy inside, great flavor. Made a few modifications due to necessity & other suggestions: 1) Used regular shortening, 2) cut sugar to 3/4 cup, 3) doubled vanilla, 4) used 2.5 c flour, 1 c oatmeal flour, 1/2 c cake flour, 5) baking powder instead of soda. Came out freakishly good.

If I were to make again, I would flatten the balls. Mine did not end up looking like the ones above, but rather like mounds. To be fair, I used all butter, because 'butter flavour shortening' is not a thing that I would ever have, so that might have caused it. And everything considered, they tasted fine, and were all eaten.

Made these to round out holiday cookie platters. This was my first time making chocolate chip cookies from scratch, and my husband was looking at tips for "puffy" cookies (extra flour, refrigerate dough, etc). I chose this recipe because it called for substantially more flour than other recipes I found. I left out the chopped nuts, at eaters' requests. Other than omitting nuts, I followed the recipe exactly. After finishing the dough, I dropped it in a gallon sized plastic bag and stuck it in the fridge for 24 hours. When I took the dough out the next day, it was HARD and unworkable. I left it on the counter for about 15 minutes to soften, and that worked just fine. I used a rounded measuring tablespoon to drop the cookies down (I ended up with about 65 cookies, not far off the recipe's yield). The first batch was too overdone (I baked for about 12 minutes) and the bottoms very dark. Using the recipe's guideline - the cookies' centers should be just set) and the rest of the cookies were perfect, about 9 minutes in the oven, turning the pan halfway through. They were chewy and soft, but more substantial than bakery treats I've tasted that are almost greasy and raw in the center. They definitely had a cakey texture, but I didn't find them too dry. I received rave reviews from literally every person I gave some to try. Will absolutely be keeping this as my go-to CC cookie recipe.

Other recipes spread out.  I was hesitant with the amount of flour but they turned out great.  It was unseasonably warm so I refrigerated the dough between pans.   They tasted great.

Awesome cookies but the flour amount was really big. I added in 1\2 a cup of M&M's  and 1\2 a cup of chocolate chips. It tasted better then the ones at Subway. lol

Cookies turned out perfect. Boyfriend was embarrassingly profuse about how good they were. Pat your cookie balls down just a bit so they come out perfectly cookie-shaped.

These cookies were the best I have ever made! They were soft and chewy in the middle and crispy on the edges. I used the chocolate chunks instead of chips. I also baked only one cookie sheet at a time and after a short wait transferred them to a cooling rack. My grandson could not get enough of them! I agree do not over bake they will get a little too hard.

These particular cookies are great when they are first cooked, however, after they have been place in a plastic storage container they turn in to a very hard crunchy cookie. I took them out of the oven before they were completely done as to prevent this, but my only suggestion is to place a slice of regular sandwich bread in the container with them if you plan on storing them until they are cool.  The bread will keep the cookies chewy and moist as long as they are in a covered container.

i subbed coconut oil for butter and shortening. Went with 1 1/3 coconut oil liquified and like 1/8teaspoon milk.
Overall good solid recipe, even with the changes I made( its what I had on hand) the dough was perfect not dry and not sloppy. Made the balls a little bigger too just used my hand rather than a spoon.
Cook time and temp for my oven was dead on too
My better 3/4s LOVED THEM! Best cookies I made so far. Next time cutting the recipe, there was a lot of cookies... I got to give some away.

every time i make these cookies, they disappear in 2 days! they're delicious, and very popular at home and work.
Try it with unsweetened coconut flakes instead of chocolate chips. Both recipes are delicious!

These were good.  But I would add less flour.  And take out of oven earlier before they are done and let it heat on rack for a minute or two.

These cookies turn out very similar to the thick soft cookies you get in famous cookie stores.  I just use regular shortening instead of butter flavored and they still turn out great every time.

I used canola oil (2/3 a cup) in substitute for the shortening  , but followed the rest of the directions as instructed. I cooked them for a little less than 9 minutes, and they came out perfect.  Probably my favorite chocolate chip cookie recipe now.

It Was A GREAT Cookie ! My Only Problem With The Outcome Was That It Was A Little Too Salty For My Taste. I Didn't Add The Salt And Just A Pinch Of Baking Soda. Next Time I Know Not To Use Any To Avoid The Salt Taste. And Instead Of Using Chocolate , I Used White Chocolate For A More Sweeter Route. It Was Over All Very Soft And Chewy , It Took More Than 10 Minutes To Bake. I Baked It For At Least 15 Minutes Scared It Would Be Hard But Still It Was Soft And Chewy Even After Cooling ! I Would Recommend This To Anyone Who Has Never Made Cookies From Scratch ??

I think that these are the best cookies I've ever had. I needed a recipe to make for some friends at school as payment, and I saw these and WOW!!! They were amazing! I'm sorry for those who didn't have the cookies turn out as most others' did. These cookies really are fantastic. The only thing I didn't do was use butter-flavored shortening. I used regular shortening instead. But wow. I love these things.

These were really good definitely beats store bought :) I used mini chocolate chips because that's what I had and used brown sugar instead of white sugar (so omitted white and doubled brown sugar) makes them a little sweeter :) my 2-13 yr olds loved them!! Thanks for the recipe!!

This is my favorite recipe.  I never have shortening on hand so I subbed out for butter.  These always turn out so chewy and good.  Its weird how everyone is getting different results.  My guess is the altitude.  Here at 4500 ft they turn out perfectly chewy, crisp, and great flavor(with the addition of butter instead of shortening.)

Made this recipe as is.  It makes an easy to work with dough that maintains shape while baking.  Fantastic, soft on the inside and delicious.  I will definitely make these again.  It is really important that you take them out while still underdone and let them rest on the cookie sheet a few minutes to finish.  I'm sure most people getting hard cookies are overbaking them.

I just made these cookies to take to neighbors and they turned out incredible! They look exactly like the picture, and taste fantastic!!!! Thanks for the recipe!! I did not put the shortening or the pecans and I put baking powder instead of baking soda, but everything else worked out perfectly!!

Makes wonderful soft and chewy cookies! The secret is in the shortening...it prevents the cookies from flattening and gives them a rich texture. I followed to recipe exact, but used regular shortening instead of butter flavored as it was all I had in the pantry. I made larger cookies; 8 per cookie sheet. Be sure to mold the dough the way you want the cookies to look after baking, as they retain their shape and do no flatten. 5 stars and a tall glass of milk  for these yummy chocolate chip cookies!!

I just tried this recipe and was kind of disappointed with it. It tasted more like a butter cookie than a chocolate chip cookie. It definitely needs more brown sugar. It should probably be 1 and a half cups brown sugar and 1/2C. of white sugar. I also used the suggestion of substituting baking soda with baking powder which did make it a fluffier cookie. I will continue my search for a good chocolate chip recipe.

I found this recipe to be amazing! Instead of 2 cups of choco. chips, I put one cup, and another of chopped Reese's! By the way I love peanut butter haha. Also, because the batter seemed very dry, I added an extra tablespoon of butter, and they turned out delicious!

Oh My Gosh!! These are the BEST chocolate chip cookie I have ever made (and ever tasten). I gave so many out as Christmas goodies since they were so good. And also because the recipe makes so many, which was my fault for not looking. These can easily be made for diabetics by using Splenda white and brown sugar and sugar free chocolate chips. I have three friends that are diabetics so I am making a bunch for them next year. I will half my recipe for next year where I can make half of them sugar free. Thanks Beth!

I made these today, and I thought they were pretty good, and my kids liked them a lot. My husband, however, didn't like them at all (he said that they taste like bisquick to him, lol). I added a third egg to it, so it wouldn't be quite so "floury". I will make this again:)

Amazing!  Used others' suggestions - 1 1/2 cup packed brown sugar, 1/2 cup white sugar, 1 tsp of mayo after eggs, medium scoop of batter on stone baking sheet for 10 minutes.  (edges barely turning golden.)  Let rest on stones 2 additional minutes out of oven then moved to cooling rack.  Perfect cookie at our elevation here in the beautiful Rockies Mountains!  Turned out amazing!  Thanks so much Beth and others who shared their modifications!

The only changes I made were to use 1 tablespoon vanilla extract, and regular shortening (I didn't have the butter flavor), and these cookies came out great!  I used my 1 1/2 tablespoon cookie scoop, and I always, always use parchment paper when baking cookies.  This will replace the other recipe that I've been using for the last two years!  I have also tried her snickerdoodle, peanut butter, and spicy oatmeal cookie recipes.  They are all awesome!  All hail The Cookie Queen!

I absolutely love this recipe. Although I changed it a bit according to a review I read. I added the 1 cup white sugar and the 1 cup packed light brown sugar, plus 1 teaspoon mayo. I had to leave it in longer, I'd say about 18 minutes but the end result was a very moist and great tasting cookie. Thanks a bunch for the recipe.

I've been looking for the best chocolate chip cookie recipe for a while. As soon as I tasted the dough for these, I knew they were going to be amazing. I ate so much dough I got a stomach ache. I left the cookies on the cookie sheet to cool though because they fell apart when I tried to take them off after 2-3 minutes. Best cookies ever.

This cookie taste as good as it looks. Texture and appearance was good. Mine didn’t have the “cakey” texture that some bakers mentioned. The dough did not need to be chilled. I baked them on a parchment-lined aluminum baking sheet and had excellent results.

I had higher hopes for this recipe.  I think the problem I have is that they are too artificial tasting, which I am guessing is from the shortening.  The dough is pretty thick and I had trouble at first figuring out how long to cook, they do have a tendency to brown on the top (even with my Pampered Chef stoneware), once I got the time right (11 min for me) it was fine.  They are not good right out of the oven, I had actually given this a worse rating but changed it as they taste better the next day.  If I decide to try these again, I will definitely be using all butter.  Thanks for the recipe.

i hate to give a less-than-perfect review, but these just aren't my favorite. i thought that there was something lacking in the flavor, and it must be just me, since my family went CRAAZY over them. they are however very addictive. i found the texture quite...puffy. they held their shape beautifully though, even if they didn't golden up, hence my family's name for them: white cookies
EDIT: I made these again a long while later from the first time and i have to change my review to another star. crispy  shell over a soft and chewy inside (and not white this time - beautifully golden). my search for the perfect cookie has ended (though it could have ended monthes ago, i just didn't realize)

Very good!  I followed the directions to a T as Beth always has good, original recipes that don't need many changes.  I don't know why people said these are hard. They are anything BUT! I took mine out right at 10 minutes. I've tried many more high rated chocolate chip cookie recipes from allrecipes, and this is one of my favorites!

Good cookies, I halved the recipe and added more chips.  Also I baked mine on a pizza stone.  These cookies are fluffy and a bit cake-like.

These were good cookies coming right out of the oven, but I'm only giving them 3 stars because by the next day, they tasted a bit stale.  Chocolate chip cookies don't usually last too long in our house, but I like them to still be tasty the next day.  I'll be going back to my old standby recipe.

I did not like this recipe.  The cookies just did not taste right.   The dough was too thick or dry and so the chocolate chips kept falling out(I think the recipe calls for too much flour or something).  They had a nice overall appearance but I just did not like the taste.  I would definitely recommend the recipe "Award Winning Soft Chocolate Chip Cookies" from this site.  They have a very similar texture but they stay nice and soft and taste way better.

These are not your typical chocolate chip cookie; they are more like a scone.They went over well with my family, but were not what I was looking for.They were VERY fat and tall.They didn't spread much at all. I think if you reduce the amount of flour in them it could help. The flavor was nice, the texture was cakey. I prefer a less cakey texture. I also did not use shortening.(I am AGAINST transfat)I used all butter. They were very good, but like I said, not what I was looking for in a chocolate chip cookie.

I was impressed by the amount of flour this recipe called for - I like my cookies cakey! After trying this recipe, I have to say it is the second worst I have ever tasted. (The first being the original Toll House recipe - blech) However, out of the 7 people that ate these cookies, about 3 of them did like them, so I guess to each his own. I thought the vanilla was maybe a little much...the cookies had a weird aftertaste, and didn't mesh well with the chocolate chip-iness.

This recipe is awesome.  I recently just started baking cookies from scratch and this is the third recipe I've tried - and the turnout is outstanding.  I've made a few batches with this recipe, and I've added two tablespoons of milk to it so that the dough is a little moist.  Thanks Beth!

These are pretty good cookies although I prefer mine a little crisper on the outside and chewier in the middle. I used an electric mixer as I always do to cream the butter and sugars. I actually used margarine (in place of butter) and butter flavored shortening. I left out the nuts. But then later added toffee chips to half the batter. I do appreciate that it actually made at least the 72 cookies it said it would, I so often end up with about half the number of cookies that a recipe states it will make. Doubt I'll make again but if you have all the ingredients go ahead and try!

This was the best I have had.  I am really picky about my chocolate chip dough because I hate chocolate.  I made these for a friend.  They are perfect.

I used all organic ingredients, Whole wheat pastry flour and no nuts.

I also used a whisk to cream and my hands to blend.  Delicious!  Not cakey at all!

Thank you for this great recipe!  Very easy to make & tastes great ... a definite with my entire family!  I love the flavor of butter so opted to use all butter in the recipe (great flavor & texture).  I used semi - sweet chocolate chunks & added 2 T. hot water - the dough seemed a little stiff & I remember a chocolate chip cookie recipe from long ago that called for the hot water - again my cookies turned out great.  I set timer for 10 min & on some batches added a 1-2 min (keeping close eye on them).  Allowed to cool for 2-3 min. & then they just seemed to disappear!  This is now my new standby chocolate chip cookie recipe.

I thought these were a little on the cakey side, but I know that's what some people prefer.  I just thought they would be chewier than they are.  My family seemed to enjoy them.

I've been looking for a chocolate chip cookie that has a great taste and the perfect texture.  Up until now, all of my cookies have come out flat and either ultra-gooey (borderline rubbery) or ultra-crunchy, and even ugly.  These are beautiful cookies. It's true- they don't lose their shape.  Not too sweet, but just sweet enough.

Absolutely the best chocolate chip cookie I have had homemade.  My daughter made these cookies, and since she's very impatient, she made them about 3 times the size the recipe called for.  It was brilliant.  It did take maybe 5-10 minutes more to bake but it was worth the wait.  One thing I really like about these cookies is they are not overly sweet.

HIGH ALTITUDE adjustments (5800 ft.): I reduced baking soda to 3/4 teaspoon and reduced baking time to 7-8 minutes to get a great cookie.  All other ingredients and directions the same.  I made the cookies following instructions the first time and they were bad - hard and dry.  Made them at sea level to figure out what they're supposed to taste like then experimented with adjustments for high altitude to get this excellent result.

This is my new favorite chocolate chip cookie recipe... Very soft and moist, with great flavor.  I used all butter because I didn't have shortening.  I also made it once with half dark chocolate chips and half peanut butter.  Absolutely irresistible!  I haven't found a cookie recipe from Beth Sigworth that hasn't been perfect!

Thanks Beth! these cookies were awesome. I used dark brown sugar instead of white though.Nothing unusual for me though,cookies taste better with the dark sugar.I didn't have real butter, so i used "i can't believe its butter" and it worked fine.also didn't have butter flavored shortening so i mixed in a little bit of margarine to get that taste.Very good i definately will be adding this to my recipe box!!!

Very easy to make with basic ingredients.  Soft, chewy and not too sweet.

Awesome recipe.  My kids gobbled these up in no time, including my hyper-picky 8 year old who never gets excited about any kind of food.  Will definitely add these to my permanent collection!

These were good, but not the "best" - a little cakey for our tastes.  We like moist, chewy cookies.

Great  cookies *IF*  you reduce  the  flour  by 1/2 cup, otherwise  the  dough and  cookies are  too dry. Also I baked mine  a little  under 10 mins and  they  were  great, chewy and  thick! Thanks  Beth.

These cookies turned out very crisp and shortbread tasting and this is after taking them out of the oven much earlier(around 8 minutes).  They  never came close to  being chewy. My brother warned his wife never to make these but I must say that I kinda liked them even though they were dry.  They were not too sweet and were not flat.  The only change I made was to replace the 1/2 cup white flour with wheat flour and the pecans were substituted with toffee bits.  I would not make these again and I am going back to the drawing board in search of the perfect chocolate chip cookie.

These cookies were good but nothing exciting. Everyone who tasted liked the cookies but I was looking for something different. These cooked fast in my oven-about 9 minutes is all it needed.

these were great, classic chocolate chip cookies. they went fast at my party. i substituted butter for the shortening and half of the flour with whole wheat flour. i also cut up bars of bittersweet chocolate for the choc. chips, and didn't have any pecans, though i'm sure that would've been delicious.

I'd like to thank Beth for these cookies... They are awesome and I can't believe how easy they are to make! I used a bit more chocolate chips and I used some margarine (because I didn't have enough butter on hand) and the cookies were excellent!

Once again, the cooks of allrecipes.com have made my day!  After frustration with batches of flat cookies (from the recipe on the bag) I decided to look for one here.  These cookies turned out awesome. They look perfect and most importantly taste great! ( I didn't have the butter flavored shortening, and was to impatient to wait, so I used regular shortening and they still were great.)  This recipe is definitely a keeper!

These were real good.  My cookies always turn out flat, but these did not go flat and tasted great.  I can't wait to make them again.  I added a little vanilla instant pudding powder which was real good.

This was a good solid recipe. I did like how the cookies didn't spread out to be paper thin - they stayed nice and thick. They tasted very good too. Other people had mentioned that the inside of the cookie stayed soft while the outside was crunchy, but that was not the case with mine. The recipe didn't make as many cookies as I was hoping for either. I will make these cookies again though!

ETA: original review was in 2004, and in 2019  this is still the only recipe I use. These cookies are always requested at gatherings. I bake a couple of minutes less to get crispy edges and soft insides. Love them!

I've been using the Toll House recipe since I was little but was never happy with the way they flattened out.  These cookies are just what I have been looking for! They taste great AND hold their shape nicely.

This is fabulous cookie - a little crunch on the outside, soft on the inside. I love that they remain thick. Next time I will mix chip flavors.

There is no way this recipe could get any better.  I was going to respond last night when my mouth was watering, but wanted to wait and see if the reviews about the cookies getting hard the next day were true or not...totally NOT true.  These cookies are fabulous and they look sooo pretty!  Definitely my cookie recipe from now on.  Thanks Beth!

I was so dissapointed with these cookies!  They looked wonderful but were crunchy :(  I prefer a soft cookie with a slightly chewy texture and these did not cut it.  I've made a few other cookie recipes from this author and they were wonderful but these were probably the worst chocolate chip cookies I've ever made (and I bake a lot!) I guess it's just a preference thing.

GREAT COOKIES!! I took 3 doz. of them to a game night with 12 ladies and none of them could believe that they were home made. Needless to say they were gone in a hour.!!
 I didn't have any butter flavored shorting so I used regular shorting instead.

This is the best recipe, I can't keep these around when I make them.  The key is to watch the baking time.  Remove the cookies from the oven when the tops just start to brown, and they will stay very soft and chewy.

This cookie is absolutely WONDERFUL!!!!I followed the recipe to the letter.  And the cookies are super moist.  I have a 7 year old boy, a 6 year old girl and a 3 and a half year old boy...and I have had to make this 2 times within the last 2 days.  I can't keep them around.

My husband (who is HARD to please when it comes to soft chewy cookies) LOVES them also!

These were pretty good cookies... I think I need to play around with the baking time some more (I baked them for 10 - 11 minutes), but overall I was rather satisfied.

Anybody who doesn't LOVE this recipe is nuts!  I used M&Ms in mine and the buttery flavor is a huge hit with my boyfriend and his coworkers, they are begging for more!  Thanks for this winner!  I followed the recipe exactly and got a nice cookie and NO complaints!

Very good recipe. A hint to keep it from getting dry: Halve both the butter and the shortening, then add the remaining amount in applesauce. It will keep the batter moist.

I was looking for a recipe that could possibly be similar to the every so yummy Otis Spunkmeyer cookies. I tried this on based on the review and upon making it found I was extremely disappointed. They tasted okay but extremely oily. If you look at the tollhouse recipe they donot call for that much butter or oil based product such as Crisco Butter sticks. I think all would agree at the good taste of the tollhouse recipe that is why I think there is FAR TO MUCH oil based ingredients in this recipe. I would not recommend to to anyone. I love chocolate chip cookies and I love to bake and try new recipes but this is by far the worst I have tried yet other than this Tres Leches Cake that called for the horrible Pom Pope cream Liquor. Very bland flavor in the doe too.

I did not care for this recipe. I've tried it two or three times and have gotten a flat, nothing special, cookie that gets stale in about a day even when sealed in an airtight container.  I guess I'll just keep looking for a recipe that suits my taste.

I thought this was an easy recipe to make! I only used 3 cups of flour and didn't add the salt. I didn't realize until now that I was supposed to add 1 TBSP of vanilla, I added 1 tsp, that's okay they still tasted great!

Good cookie. In my opinion, a whole tablespoon of vanilla is too much. And I found that lowering the oven tempeature to 350 (as suggested by others) did not work as well.

I was so impressed w/ the LOOKS of this cookie.  It would surely win 1st prize in a beauty contest.
The taste was good, but not the best I've tasted.
Also, the cookies DID NOT come out hard the next day or the day after that, like some of the other reviewers mentioned. Maybe because I followed the directions exactly except for 1 thing, I baked it at 350 instead of 375.

Fantastic recipe.  I think this will be my basic recipe for a while.  First of all, the cookies looked perfect - they were just so pretty and uniform.  Also, they were done perfectly at 10 minutes.  Usually my cookies are burnt if I cook them for the entire time a recipe says to at the stated temperature.  When I first took them out of the oven they tasted like any other fresh chocolate chip cookie.  It wasn't until the next day that I really appreciated the flavor.  They have a bit of a salty/baking soda-ish tinge that I really like.  The vanilla flavor was too much at first, but it has grown on me.  Next time, though, I will try using dark brown sugar in place of some of the light brown sugar for better flavor.  I also might try substituting milk choc chips for half of the semi-sweet ones for a bit more sweetness.  Overall - yum!

This was one of the best chocolate chip cookies I've ever made.  The texture was perfect, and the cookie itself was yummy.  But could you believe I hand-stirred everything by hand because my hand mixer was broken?  Nevertheless, it came out great.  The only change I made was I used 3 cups flour instead of 3 1/2, and baked them for just 8-9 minutes.   This one's a keeper!

To use chocolate chips in a different recipe is not fair to the chips!!! This is so good.. I will never use another chocolate chip recipe. This is the one! I did cut down on the flour and I used margarine instead of shortening.

Rich, flavorful and fluffy are words to describe this Chocolate Chip cookie recipe.  Chewy in the center, but crunchy on the outside.  Don't over bake this cookie.  10 minutes are sufficient.  My family was impressed!  Thanks for the recipe, Beth.  I give you a superior rating!!

I would put these between three and four stars, they weren't chewy at all, more cake like, but they tasted great and had a nice soft inner texture.

Awesome!!  My new favorite chocolate chip recipe! I've always hated the Toll House recipe because they spread too much.  Beth's recipe is what I've been searching for.  They are thick and chewy with great flavor.  Thanks for the recipe!!!

I only had regular Crisco on hand, so added
some butter flavored extract and used a little
extra vanilla to empty the bottle.  I flattened
them slightly with the bottom of a glass and baked for 8 min.  They are moist even the next
day and everybody has raved about them (which 
doesn't usually happen with the Tollhouse recipe).

These were not that good.  Will not make again.  The problem is they are more like golfballs and go hard.  They look like golfballs too.

These cookies were good, but they were too cake like.  My family prefers their chocolate chip cookies to be chewier. They also didn't turn a uniform brown color.  Maybe it was because I baked them in a convection oven and baked two cookie sheets at the same time.

These are pretty much perfect chocolate chip cookies!  They wern't flat, they were chewy and stayed soft!  They were also so easy to make.  I used milk chocolate chips and I didn't add the pecans.  My family enjoyed them.  I recommend these to anyone.

These are amazing!  I followed the recipe exactly, right down to "hand" stirring in the dry ingredients.  I am eating them for the second day and they are still soft and chewy with a great butter flavor.  My Tollhouse coookies never turned out this good.

Perfect chocolate chip cookies and very easy to make. Everyone keeps asking when I'm going to make more!  This is a recipe that I will use over and over, again.  I added a cup of chopped walnuts, too.

Sorry, but these were NOT my favorite chocolate chip cookies. They reminded me more of a sugar cookie with chocolate chips. They are missing something, but I just can't put a finger on what it might be. I think I will be sticking to Tollhouse from now on.

I just made these for a wedding reception that I am hosting.  These are great!  They flattened out nicely and they were not cakey- kind of chewy.I hope that they stay that way till this weekend!

The only changes that I made were:

Cooking at 350 (10 minutes for flat cookie sheet, 11 minutes for edged cookie sheet)

I used parchment paper on the sheets, 

When I doubled the recipe I used only 2 cups of butter (no shortening) and then I only used 6 cups of flour since I cut back on the amount of butter.  

Thanks for the wonderful recipe, Beth!

This is a great recipe.  For some reason my chocolate chip cookies never are any good.  These were delicious!!  They were thick, not thin like tollhouse.  I added M&M's instead of the chocolate chips and took them to my daugther's Valentine party.  I was even asked for the recipe.

Beth! Thank you so much for this recipe! Finally after trying nearly every recipe on this website I hit the jackpot! I did use baking powder instead of the soda to make them bake up a little lighter but other than that they are the best!!!! My chocolate chip cookie recipe search is over!! Elvis has left the building!

I just got finished making your cookies. If I learned one thing from these cookies, it would be that you must love chocolate. These were the BEST cookies I ever made. Next time I will cut back on the chips. Half a bag of the mini chips.  Your recipe is great, I just didn't care for all the chocolate. Thank you for sharing! Oh, the kids loved them, best they ever had.

These are GREAT chocolate chip cookies.  They are thick and tasty and can stand up to many, many chocolate chips and nuts.  They do become a little hard after the second day, but there's none left anyway.

This is excellent! Chewy, moist, and very choclatey. I used pecans instead of walnuts, and 2.5 C of chips, and they turned out wonderfully. This is my new basic chocolate chip cookie recipe.

these were ok, but nothing fantastic.  the shortening flavor came through a little too strong, even though i used 1 cup of butter and 1/3 cup of shortening.

I really didn't care for the cake-like texture; and they looked like little mounds instead of regular cookies. I prefer my chocolate chip cookies to be crisp on the outside and chewy on the inside.

My claim to fame are chocolate chip cookies made from "Mrs. Fields'" recipe, but these are half the work and keep better!  Thank you, Beth for another winner.  BTW Beth's peanut butter cookies are to die for.

They were thick and yummy but not that chewy. I
don't like cake like texture and they were a
little "airy", but I would make them again because
they beat any I have personally made before.

This is probably the best chocolate chip cookie I've ever made.  My husband loves them and he's the real critic.  I have been looking for a thick and chewy cookie and I have finally found it.  Thank you.

These are the best!  I had read some other reviews where people said their cookies were hard the next day - well it's the next day for my cookies and they are just as moist as yesterday!  Thanks for the recipe.

First time through I follwed the recipe.  2nd time, Instead of 2/3 cups each of Butter and Shortening, I upped the Butter to 1 cup and dropped the Shortening to 1/3 -  They still kept their shape, and improved the buttery texture.  Great recipe.  I hadn't ever thought to combine Butter and Shortening!

Fantastic!  These cookies are the best I've ever made.  They go together quickly and hold their shape while baking.  I reduce the chips to 1 1/2 cups and they still have plenty.  I also add 1 tsp mint extract and just 2 tsp vanilla.  Yummy!

A very ordinary chocolate chip cookie. Nothing spectacular. If anything, they were drier than other recipes I've tried and not soft or chewy at all. Very disappointing.

My daughter made these as her very first solo baking project. They turned out just perfect. The whole family declared them the best chocolate chip cookie ever! She used milk chocolate chips and omitted nuts.

I have been searching for a soft and chewy chocolate chip recipe -- and the search continues.  Admittedly, cookie-baking is not my culinary forte, but I was disappointed when, the next day, my "wonderful cookies" (from the night I made them) had developed the crunch of a cracker.

Beth, I LOVE your cookies!  We liked your snickerdoodles so much that I searched your listings and found this one.  These are far superior to Toll House....the best chocolate chip cookies I've ever eaten!!  Nice and thick, not flat, with crisp edges and a chewy center.  Perfect!

THE BEST chocolate chip cookie ever!  I've been looking for an easy, awesome chocolate chip recipe and now I can't stop making them!  I even ran out of vanilla extract and they still came out delicious.  I will never go back to Tollhouse frozen cookie dough!

I've never baked with shortening before being a butter kind of gal. I used regular shortening because I didn't have butter-flavored. This recipe was easy to make and tastes FANTASTIC! I hate cookies that spread when they back and these don't. Little pieces of heaven I say!

This recipe was ok.  Cookies are crisp rather than soft and chewy.  Also, the vanilla flavor really comes across in these cookies.

This was the best Cookie Recipe ever made!!  My husband loves Chocolate Chip
Cookies--and he LOVED them.  They were the perfect cookie!  Chewy, fluffy,
and the taste was awesome.  Everybody loved them, and couldn't believe that
I had made them.  This recipe is a definite keeper.  I used milk chocolate chip 
cookies instead of semi sweet--they made the taste melt in your mouth.  Also, 
if you use a cookie scoop, they will turn out picture perfect looking, as well as 
tasting!!

These are so delicious, I think this is THE chocolate chip cookie recipe. After my mother tried these, she said that they tasted somewhat like a cookie her sister in law used to make, but would never give her the recipe for! Beth, thank you so much!
