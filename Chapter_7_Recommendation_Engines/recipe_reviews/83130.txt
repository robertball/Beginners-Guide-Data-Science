I used the marinade for the pork but did not make the panzeznella salad.  The marinade made the pork tender and juicy, marinaded for about six hours grilled abou seven minutes or so per side until done.  Tender and juicy family loved them!

I baked the pork chops after they soaked overnight, and instead cut up the italian bread into thick chunks and toasted them with butter and pesto, put some in the salad and ate the rest as slices of bread. Also, added provolone cheese with the parmesan - it was amazing!

This was very easy and very good. I pan fried my pork chops and toasted the bread in a skillet with olive oil and salt because I didn't feel like fooling with the grill. Very tasty and light supper.
