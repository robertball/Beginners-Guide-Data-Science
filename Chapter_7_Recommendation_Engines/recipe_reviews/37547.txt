I was very disapointed in this recipe.  It was very bland.  My kids enjoyed making them, but the fun stopped there.

these are easy and great. only thing keeping it from being 5 stars is the fact that it should be chilled overnight and then it is still very sticky. needs plenty of flour to roll into 1/4 inch dough for cutting . I'm addicted to the cookies though. I brought some to a halloween party as a treat for the kids in snack bags and the candy was overlooked, not only by the kids but the parents were looking for where the host hid the rest of the cookies.

I really liked these.  I brought them for some friends for a treat.  I got a little inventive and made a powder sugar glaze with food coloring to paint.  They liked them so much that I didn't have any to bring home.  Thanks for such a great cookie recipe.

We found the cookies didn't hold together well and they were a little dry.  Perhaps it is my culinary skills, but I don't think so.  The over all taste of the cookies were great, however, I wouldn't make rolly snowmen, perhaps flatter ones.

The cookies look really cute, but they are to hard to handel and do not have a good flavor.

These were great my 4 year old made them for his class with me. He really liked decorating them and the kids enjoyed them.

Easy recipe, great taste.  Next time I think I will add a little almond or lemon flavor.  My son enjoyed making them, and they traveled well to his kindergarten class!
Thanks!

We really enjoyed the process of making these cookies and everyone loved them. We will make these again during the Christmas holidays.
