Great! Very close to an appetizer I used
to eat in Louisianna except we sprinkeled
Cajun spice before broiling. Wife is a 
little fussy about bacon and pre-cooks
it for a minute in microwave. Supposed to 
an appetizer but I so many no room for
main course!  We sometimes leave off the
water chesnut but I love the crunch.

There are too many competing flavors in this appetizer.  The sherry and bacon oil made the scallops taste a little on the sour side.  Since I enjoy the simple freshness of grilled scallops, or even scallops sauted in garlic and butter, I found the various flavors unsatisfying.  In fact, my husband also did not like the tastes and we ended up throwing out the appetizer.  This is unfortunate, since it is easy to make and would be a beautiful appetizer.

This is great and yummy, also! To save on calories and still enjoy the flavors (which I think blend wonderfully) I used pieces of turkey bacon. Regular bacon is more tasty, but I can then eat these little appetizers without much guilt! Thanks for this recipe!

These appetizers are simply delicious...literally.  So easy.  Beautiful presentation.  Make sure to use sea scallops and not bay scallops...makes a big difference.  But gosh are they good!!

This was okay but the submitter should have indicated whether the sherry should be dry, medium or sweet.  I wasn't crazy about the water chestnuts, they have no flavour and only add crunch, I ommitted the green onion.

Everyone loved this, quite a bit of work to get these browned evenly under the broiler and made a pretty big mess. Next time I will pre-cook the bacon a bit
