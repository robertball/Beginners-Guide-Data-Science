This recipe is very good!  I rated this 4 because I feel the directions should have included proper frying directions for those that may not have fried fish before.  I use my electric skillet to keep the oil regulated at 350 degrees and used about 1 1/2-inches of peanut oil.  Once they are golden brown on each side, I find it is best to drain on a rack placed on top of the paper towel, the rack will keep the fish crispy along with frying at the proper temperature.

Excellent recipe for spicy, crispy catfish! I used my Lodge cast iron skillet and melted Crisco for the oil (a traditional choice in Mississippi) until I had about 1 inch. I suggest you DOUBLE the dry mixture as you will not have enough to coat all the fish.

This was awsome! We totally devoured it! You do need to double the recipe for the coating. BTW, I didn't have time to let them sit in the fridge, so I just started frying them as soon as I had them all prepared. It worked just fine, no problems whatsoever! Thanks for the recipe!

Wow...GREAT recipe.  Take the other reviewers advice and double the dry ingredients.  I follwed this recipe exactly as written with the exception of adding about 5 dashes of hot sauce (we like it spicy down south) and my catfish turned out wonderful.  Thanks for the recipe.  This one's a keeper.

My husband and I "LOVED" this recipe. I changed only one thing, I had to use yellow mustard rather than ground mustard because I didn't have any.  Incorporating fish into our diet will be a sinch, if I can find more recipes as good as this one.

I gave this recipe a 3 because of the way it was written.  Normally I read the reviews, but this time I thought with these ingredients, you can't go wrong....boy I was wrong.  I ended up making 3 batches of the breading (I used 3 lbs of fish, so I had changed the number of servings).  Doing the batches on the fly was a pain.  Then I had used partially frozen fish, so my breading was basically mush before frying, and letting it sit in the fridge.  My recommendations are to double or triple this recipe, use fresh or completely thawed fish, and when putting it in the fridge, make sure it is in a single layer in your pan. By the way the taste of the seasoning, wasn't bad, but wasn't my favorite by far.

AMAAAZING!!!! I myself am not a big fish lover but i made this for my boyfriend and i for dinner with dirty rice and it turned out absolutely amazing! Had just the right amount of heat to make both him and i happy. He's all about spicy HOT food, me not so much. Will definitely be saving this to make it again and again! Thanks for the recipe :)

This was an easy to make and flavorful dish.  I served it as a sandwich with tartar sauce and cajun mayo.  I added more than a dash of hot sauce to the batter and it was just the right amount of spice for me.

Yum.. I cut the catfish in nuggets and followed the recipe. I served with Remoulade Sauce a la New Orleans which is on this site.  Will be buying catfish again to use this recipe.

I tried this recipe as my first foray into cooking catfish. It was easy to follow and came ouot pretty good. The only problem we had with it was it was too salty from the cajun seasoning (Tony Cachere's). I doubled the dry ingredients per other reviewer's suggestions, and still had to make more when I had about 1/3 of my fish left and not enough breading. For the second batch of breading I skipped the seasoning and added the spices myself - garlic powder, ground cayenne & chili peppers, and a dash each of paprika & cumin. Much better because it wasn't salty. All in all a good recipe but watch out for the salt in your seasoning!

This was an easy and awesome recipe. This was also my first successful fried cat fish. The only thing that I had to tweak was the temperature from med high to med low. I guess electric stove tops are a bit hotter than gas.

Excellent recipe every one in my house loved this including the kids who does not eat fish very well I agree with some of the other people the only thing that could make this better is if there were more tips on cooking fish for people who never have but the recipe is rocking by itself

This was tasty and one I will make often in the summer while my catfish are biting. I used a lot more Frank's because we like extra heat. The ingredient combo blended nicely in this recipe. I found that a Fry Daddy works nicely with this too.

We subbed bread crumbs for the cornmeal.  Used a big non-stick pan with canola and 2 minutes a side did the trick.

Just LOVELY.  Only thing was I had to use 2 eggs and three "batches" of the breading for the amount of fish.  Used a bit more oil (peanut) for the frying too.  Fish came out great.  Crispy, not spicy hot, just enough to warm your mouth up, then juicy, tender, flaky fish.  Great the next day too.

My husband and I love this recipe.  I do think it needs a bit of salt or something, but I guess I'll just have to use some tartar sauce.  I also am trying to figure out what will help the batter to stick to the fish a little better- if eaten right away, it's perfect, but after a few minutes of waiting for everyone to get to the table, the batter is starting to get a little bit less crispy and a little bit wilty. But overall very tasty!

It was great! Followed the steps and the results are great. Normally, I don't like eating fish but this made it more than edible. The seasoning I used was a little too salty but other than that I would definitely make it again!

I didn't have any cornmeal, so I coated in the flour mixture, dipped in the egg, and the coated in panko, just because that's all I had. In this scenario, I feel I could add another tablespoon of Cajun seasoning. Maybe not with the cornmeal? Anyway, even my stepdaughter liked it! Bless her, she knows I'm not a cook. I served with corn on the cob and broccoli.  Very good.

We rarely ever eat fried foods but I had some catfish and wanted to do something other than just bake it.  This was very good.  I doubled the flour/cornmeal mixture and used 2 eggs for less than 1 1/2 pounds of catfish.  It was not greasy at all, as I cut the catfish into small pieces as recommended and used very little vegetable oil, draining it all on paper towels once cooked.   I also made the remoulade sauce at http://allrecipes.com/recipe/remoulade-sauce-a-la-new-orleans/detail.aspx, but made a healthy version with Miracle Whip Lite dressing and no olive oil.  Served with broccoli, this was a good cold weather meal.
