Since I was roasting this with asparagus I increased the temperature to 400 degrees and baked for 25 minutes.  Moist and fork tender.  Also, since I was making this as the entrée rather than as simply cooking it for another purpose, I added dill, garlic salt, and paprika for rich color.  Easiest, quickest dinner I’ve made in awhile.  Good too.

I'm still surprised about this recipe, as I sit here eating leftovers.  As a cook who believes the only path to tender, oven-baked chicken is to slather it in sauces or breading, I almost blew right past this recipe.  But, desperate for simplicity, I chose this -- the most tender, melt-in-your-mouth chicken ever!  Instead of salt, I sprinkled both sides of each buttered breast with McCormick's Grill Mates Montreal Chicken Seasoning.  My chicken breasts were quite large, so I baked these about 50 or 55 minutes in order to reach 165 degrees, and I basted them a few times with the juices while baking.  I'm thinking this recipe will work quite well for my low-carb way of eating.  Definitely our new favorite!  Give it a try.

These worked great! I usually bake my chicken in the oven w/ evoo, salt, pepper and garlic powder, but I wanted to try this using the butter. I did add some pepper and garlic powder (I guess that made this 5 ingredient baked chicken, lol), but used the cooking method...it was very good...nice and flavorful! I used the chicken to make chicken salads for dinner. I do like my usual evoo, b/c it's a bit more healthy, but I would totally make this again, as it was very good! Thanks for sharing. :)

This has to be the silliest "recipe" I've ever seen.  I think my 5 year old grandson could figure out how to throw chicken in the oven if he had to cook something to eat to survive. This is ridiculous.  I really like this site, but if this is the cooking level most people are on, I think you better stick to TV dinners (if you can figure out how to turn on the oven).  Really?

Excellent basic recipe.  I was looking through some basic recipes to show my granddaughter who is on her own but loves to cook and willing to learn.  I hope that Fran, one of the previous reviewers, sees this.  Not all people who cook this are the morons she seems to think they are.  Turn on the oven?  was her comment.  Yet she  claims to love this site...every recipe in here that requires cooking tells you to "turn on the oven"!  Maybe she is so righteous cause she thinks she has earned the right since she is a grandmother.  Well I am too and sincerely hope I never learn her attitude toward people of any age who want to learn.  IMO, Allrecipes fits the bill for levels , ages and genders of  cooks.

I used this recipe tonight in place of the way I usually roast chicken breasts, the difference being that I use bone-in, skin-on chicken.  Then we discard the bones and skin---but they add so much flavor to the chicken that we really don't need anything else to go with this.  In place of the salt I used Papa's Seasoning from this site because it is such a flavorful blend of spices.  I use Trader Joe's package of Kosher Chicken Breasts (two halves to a package), and so I halved the recipe.  I really liked the butter and will continue to do so now.  Yum!  It was really tasty!   Thanks, jifiner25!

I made this and I am FLOORED at how good it is!  My husband came in just as I was tasting it. I popped a morsel in his mouth, and he about melted on the spot. His response, "OK, NOW you can open a restaurant.". 

The only thing I did different - I used garlic salt instead of salt. I also noticed that the picture seems to have pepper flakes, but they aren't mentioned in the recipe, so I added just a little bit. 

I baked this exactly as instructed, using a meat thermometer to gauge the cook time.

Made as directed! Wonderfully moist, tender chicken breast. Truly a great recipe that can become the base for using different flavors (citrus?), spices & herbs to create ethnic recipes with moist chicken. Don't waste the drippings! I can imagine uses for salad dressings, cooked veggies, gravies! I plan to freeze the drippings in ice cube tray to use to flavor other dishes! Thanks for a great recipe! Won't bake chicken any other way in the future. (Family loved it, too!)

Tasted great! I actually replaced the salt with Adobo. (My Husband & I are Puergo Rican) so I used the spanish seasoning instead. But other than that.. Very simple & tasted great. Was not dry either!!

I almost passed this one up because I thought "butter? It will end up greasy!" But I wanted something easy and didn't want to add breading. Instead of brushing on the butter it really was much easier to just dip the chicken breasts in it. I read reviews and added a mix of paprika and garlic salt with parsley. I seasoned quite liberally after seeing some comments about this coming out bland. This was truly the moistest baked chicken I've ever had. Chicken breasts tend to dry out so easily, but with the butter, and making sure to get them out of the oven once the internal temp is 165 degrees, it turned out so delicious! This is a great recipe to try different seasonings with different dishes, and I'll be making it again!

This was incredibly easy to make and it was delicious! I added a few extra minutes when the chicken was cooking. When the chicken was done, I sprinkled it with lemon pepper, and squeezed lemon juice on it from a lemon, and that really added to the flavour! It was the perfect combination of flavours. I can't believe how easy it was to make!

I used this recipe for making cooked chicken for chicken salad. I used large chicken breasts with rib meat, and they were done in about 35 minutes.  The chicken was moist and flavorful...not dry at all.  I had enough chicken left over to freeze for a dish of chicken divan.  I'm looking forward to that this week.  Next time, I think I will add some herbs to it just to experiment.

I added a teaspoon of minced garlic and used Kosher salt and sprinkled the top with a little pepper.  My kids asked for seconds so we will make it again!  Another successful recipe from AllRecipes!

Very easy and family liked it enough to comment.  Basted 4 breasts (pounded) with about 1/4 stick melted butter, with kosher salt and Montreal Chicken seasoning on both sides.  Baked for 35 minutes.  Looked and tasted great!

Easy and delicious! This recipe was a great find. I only changed it by using other spices in addition to salt, like Greek seasoning, oregano, black pepper, etc.. Also, I recommend cooking the chicken for a full 45 minutes, just to ensure thorough cooking.

This was a quick and simple recipe... Of course I did do some substitutions... Lol. Got to put my own kick to it! Lol! For my seasoning I used Montreal Chicken seasoning... Coated my pan with olive oil cooking spray and added a chopped onion! I also cooked it a lil longer... Instead of 30 mins... I did 45-50 mins (My chicken breast were thick)! It turned out tenderly delicious and the whole family loved it!

I have made this chicken recipe for years! I use seasoned salt , pepper, and butter.  I have also used cut up chicken rather than skinless breasts. It is always a hit and great when making a meal for a function or  someone  convalescing. It is my favorite go to chicken recipe.

EASY and delicious. Another reviewer noted "they were bland" but if she had read the  description, it was noted that these really are the basis for other recipes requiring cooked chicken.  So, I figured stand alone "blast of flavor" wasn't what I was looking for. This would work in so many things and in so many ways. Now my staple for making the base of chicken recipes. I guess, kind of like rue, also bland until you transform it into the final recipe.

Great, easy recipe.  I also have done bone in, skin on thighs and drumsticks.  Use seasoned salt for a bit more flavor.  A family favorite at our house

I really liked this recipe and found the chicken to be extremely tender & moist. My only issue was that it was a little bland & could have used a little more seasoning but there are so many options to make this dish according to your own taste, that the possibilities are endless. I will definitely use this recipe again and I think it will be fun to experiment a little with seasonings.

Lynn here.I must say-I do like simple, after 40 yrs. of cooking.Actually, I have been doing this dish with a side of my favorite-spinach.I just nestle thawed spinach along side the chicken and bake about 40 min.The last 2 min.I top with slices of Mozzarella cheese.At times we have this with Ramen noodles (I like to watch him use chopsticks-I cannot):-).Or just salad.Can't go wrong with too many vegetables at our age.

Excellent as is, but I tried adding a sprinkle of paprika after coating with the butter and salt mixture.  It was even better ...AND gave the chicken an appetizing color.

Added some fresh herbs to the mix and it was very good! Easily customizable, which is nice. I would definitely recommend it, especially for beginners!

I don't particularly care for breast meat because of how dry it is, but this was  the moistest I have ever had.  I will definitely make this more often.  The bonus is that it is SO simple.

This is a great recipe. Do not be afraid to add seasoning to it and salt liberally. I used salted butter and additional salt, black pepper, onion powder and a packet of Sazon. A tasty recipe and easy to prepare. I baked boneless skinless chicken breast for 40 minutes at 450. Perfect!

It was great, quick, and easy! I loved it but my family thought it was plain so the second time I made it I added some garlic powder with parsley, and  brochette sweet basil and oregano.

Name of the site is ALLrecipes, to the reviewer who gave it a 1 star rating and was ugly to the author....shame on you. My sister in law, literally could burn boiling water. This is a perfect base recipe or a simple recipe for someone just starting to cook. I am a seasoned cook but came upon it one night wanting to make something simple and healthy. As another viewer replied, my husband took his first bite and said, honey, this is delicious. (of course I used garlic salt instead of regular salt) but cooked it just the same. Sometimes, it the simple things in life that can be most pleasing. Kudos Jennifer Jones!

This is easy and you can add spices you like. I've never used butter for chicken but this was moist and tender.  
A big RANT to Fran and her nasty review.   It doesn't sound like she even made it.

Added what I thought was a good amount of  a lemon blend seasoning and it was very bland. However, chicken was moist and tender. Did not reheat well in the microwave, but did reheat nicely in the oven. May make it again with a lot more seasoning.

My whole family loved it,  including my picky 8 year old granddaughter. Did a little twist of my own by SLOWLY melting butter in a skillet, adding fresh crushed garlic and basted the chicken. Perfect quick, savory meal. It will be a family pic.

Lol. I took a picture and it got deleted before I remembered to write a review. ???? so. I did as said and let me tell y’all. Oooooooeeeeeeee was it good. (I am Texan so u have to say it like a Texan). Much more moist than our other recipes. I don’t normally like white meat but after trying this recipe it is the only way I will eat it now. (Except for chicken strips and nuggets) but straight up like this I normally dislike. Changed everything for me. ????????????????????????

Used half and half unsalted butter and EVOO with garlic salt.  I hate cooking chicken because no matter what I do it comes out dry.  NOT THIS TIME!  At high altitude had to extend time a little and did cover the pan with foil for the first 20 minutes.  The juices were exquisite and I plan on trying this with boneless thighs the next time.  So happy to have run across this recipe!

Decided to give it a chance.  Didn't make any changes, but I thought this was just OK.  Normally I would add a little more seasoning, depending what I felt like.  Almost always use garlic, pepper and onion.  Lemon juice is always good too.

This recipe is great.  I go a step further by browning both sides well in a iron skillet, season with Italian seasoning and butter;  then slice in half length wise and brown inside meat to finish.  

So many dishes can be made from this procedure.

I needed to cook some chicken breast for a recipe for later in the week, I saw this and gave it a try. What a pleasant surprise! This will be my go to in the future when I need cooked chicken. Customizing it to your recipe needs is the best.

This is a delicious recipe and so easy to put together on a busy evening. It actually needs no changes to be good. However I did change it by adding garlic salt and onion powder. The rating is for the original and not with my changes.

My son and husband really liked this so maybe it was just a problem with my piece but I found the texture a bit rubbery. The flavor was good though. I added Cajun spices, fresh garlic and paprika to the butter.

I just wanted something quick and easy to do with my chicken breasts as an entree and this fit the bill perfectly! This sounded to be overly simple and yes a child can do it but I have never thought to coat my chicken with  melted butter. Instead of salt I used adobe seasoning which I made also found on this site.  Very good and I can see how versatile this can be with any seasoning working well.

This was okay. Not much flavor, which, honestly, I was expecting. I did add some seasoning salt but I always try to let the recipe stand on its own first time out. Not sure I'll do this one again, though.

Very nice variation on grilled or sautéed chicken. Because many reviews said the chicken was pale I brushed it with “kitchen bouquet” browning sauce after pouring the butter over it. A few grinds of black pepper and into the oven for 45 min. I checked the temp at 40 min and it was 158, I should have pulled it then to allow for carry over cooking. 5 min later it wasn’t dry but was 168 degrees. Nicely browned. Picky grandson declared it delicious! Will make again.

This was moist and delicious!  I replaced part of the butter with olive oil and added a few seasonings based on other reviews: thyme, 3 tsp paprika, 3 tsp garlic powder, 3 tsp parsley & 1 tsp cinnamon. Will make again.

This recipe was quick and easy, and turned out so tender, not dry at all, like boneless chicken breasts can be sometimes. So yummy! Will definitely use again, Thank you!

Fantastique! Was looking for a simple good chicken and this was it. We used Lawry’s for our seasoning and upped from 15 to 20 min to get to 165 degrees for what was a thicker chicken breast, but perfection after that, my 6 year old wanted the left overs for three days in a row.

The best, most moist, most delicious chicken ever! Just added Lawry’s Seasoned Pepper to the butter and salt mixture for extra flavor. Super easy and super good!

This is easy to make but the chicken took much longer to cook and had no color on it - it was very bland tasking and bland looking........does this need to be browned before baking.  Also because it was baked so much longer the chicken was a bit tough.

This was the worst recipe I've ever made on here, I'm surprised as every 4.5 star+ recipe I've made on this site before this has been amazing! I should've known better that just butter and salt would be boring as could be. I even added grillmates garlic & herb seasoning just in case & still left to be desired as a dinner entree. I chopped up my leftovers into a caesar salad & covered in dressing to be satisfactory. Very disappointed for the first time.

Not sure where that photo came from - but that isn't the chicken in the directions in any shape or form.  This was bland and truly would never make again.

This dish was great and easy.  It was everything each of the good reviews said about it, moist, tasty and easy.  I tried different spice mixtures on half of each dish I made and they were all good.  You cant go wrong with whatever you add or with just salt and pepper.  My guests came back for seconds.

Used garlic salt instead of salt and added some fresh rosemary, had to cook for about 50 minutes, had good flavor.  Made again and added paprika and Italian seasoning, better flavor.

It is easy but - my chicken did not brown as pictured. Therefore I left it in longer thinking it might brown but it only  made it tough and pretty much tasteless. It looks like there is parsley in  the picture but it's not mentioned in the recipe.

This is my go-to chicken recipe for chicken that I use in soups, casseroles, and salads. I cannot stop eating this chicken. I never think to use it just for a meal because I rarely just make chicken but it is certainly SO good, I would. The simplicity and buttery flavor is addictive. DO use all of the salt and make exactly as described for perfect, juicy chicken!

There is absolutrly no place to make a mistake on this recipe but mine turned out rubbery, tough and an unappetizing gray. Totally tasteless. Made some pretty good chicken salad out of it.

This was really good. I had more than 4 cutlets, I had about 10 so I doubled the recipe . To the bitter I added dried spices, parsley, paprika, onion and garlic powder. I cooked about 50 mins in a roaster and basted with the juices through out. The juice will make a lot, save it. I used It on top of some veggies I served along side the chicken. This is easy and very good.

Terrific recipe for our weekly meal planning. I used 6 skinless, boneless chicken breasts....2 for today's meal and 4 to freeze individually to be used for quick meals. Chicken Parm, Chicken Caesar Salad, Chicken tacos or stir fry.
Fabulous, delicious and tender recipe. Thanks for sharing it here with all of us.

This is excellent!  It should go without saying that of course you can add any spices, salts, peppers, vegtables to make it your own.  I can't believe at my age that I finally found a way to bake chicken and have it come out moist, flavorful (due to my choice of seasoning's), easy - no fail way to cook boneless skinless chicken breasts.  Thank you

Easy and delicious!  I used it as the protein in a huge green salad, but the chicken was good enough to serve on its own.  I'm going to be making this frequently.

I use this recipe, as does the author, to bake chicken for recipes that call for cooked chicken. The negative reviews mention it's bland; well, it's not supposed to be cooked as is and simply eaten. It is intended to be spiced up more (with herbs , paprika, garlic, and/or other spices) or used in other recipes. At least we all agree it comes out moist, since that is the entire purpose.

This was excellent! I was serving this for dinner for myself and my daughters so I added a basil and garlic spice blend and fresh ground pepper to the salt and butter mixture. Three breasts took about 40 minutes and it is perfectly cooked, very tender and juicy! Normally I like to use split bone-in chicken breasts for more flavor but I realized I have a lot of boneless breasts in my freezer and this recipe happened to pop up today in my e-mail, so glad I checked it out! I might try adding some lemon next time for a little different flavor (Lemon/butter/garlic YUM!)

This is a great start as most recipes are, to make it for any dish that calls for cooked chicken, I go to this , rather than poaching.  When something says it tastes like chicken....that means it is bland, chicken really has not much taste, and unless you add something... it will taste bland

By far the juiciest, most tender chicken breasts I have ever made. I subbed in garlic salt for regular salt and topped with dried basil before putting in the oven and basted with the butter mixture twice during baking. My family loved it!

Amazingly simple and amazingly good.  I did use garlic salt as another reviewer did.  The chicken was tender and moist from the butter it was baked in.  We used the butter to pour over our potatoes which we baked at the same time.  I'd definitely make this again.

I came across this classic recipe and decided to make it for my family. I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of adding 2 teaspoons of minced garlic to the melted butter. My husband thought it was the best chicken he had ever tasted. It came out so moist and tender. Everyone in my family thoroughly enjoyed the chicken and I know this recipe will be a keeper! Thank you!

My Mom and I made it...and the only thing we added was about a pinch of garlic powder. We love it...quick and easy! I personally am a new cook...and It was so easy. We had mashed red potatoes and fresh carrots. We have a finicky oven...so we cooked on 400 degrees for 35 minutes. Turned out  great! There isn't a ton of flavor...just enough to still be delicious and a little healthier than other  extremely flavorful chicken recipes. I need to watch my sodium intake and this was pleasantly delicious even if considered on the bland side by some who've tried it. I would choose this over other chicken dishes I adore, simply for the health benefits and the simplicity of it. Oh...and the Taste is great! (Did I already state that?....lol)

 If you're looking for simplicity and something a little healthier....this is for you! And, great for newer chefs!

Sometimes, a simple but tasty old fashioned recipe is all you need.  In addition to the salt & pepper, I also sprinkled on a small amount of onion powder, garlic powder, dry parsley flakes, and paprika.  The chicken breasts were very tasty, and also incredibly moist.

This is served in my house almost weekly. We call it "butter chicken" and I actually make it on the stove. I've recently started brining my chicken breast even for just a half hour prior to cooking. What a difference! Results are moist and tender chicken in the pan or on the grill!

I've made something similar for decades, but I use Seasoned Salt instead of plain salt. It's one of my go-to recipes.

Fast, easy and delicious.  After pouring on the butter I sprinkled the chicken with black pepper, granulated garlic and paprika.  Baked for 40 minutes and found the chicken a tad dry so next time will bake for only 35 minutes.

This recipe was easy to make but very tasty.  I included lemon pepper seasoning (.5 tsp) and paprika (.5 tsp) with 1tsp garlic salt.
The chicken came out perfectly. I served it with mashed potatoes and a side of bbq sauce.

Wonderful! Will use this recipe often.  This was our no fuss supper tonight so I added garlic powder & and dill but would use as written if an ingredient in a recipe. Picture must be a file photo, mine was not quite so picturesque. I baked for 30 minutes but they didn't look done so added another 10. Temp was then at 220 but still moist and good-but not browned.

I LOVED this recipe! Simple, easy and delicious! Plus you can use this recipe to start and its very easy to make changes. For the last 10 mins you can add whatever you like, garlic, lemon, bbq sauce or creole seasoning would be just some of the ideas that you could use. This is my new go to recipe for baked chicken without skin!

This has become my preferred method for cooking chicken breasts! I no longer have to worry about them being too dry - even though reviewer 'Fran' thinks it's ridiculous and that we should 'stick to TV dinners', I appreciate this recipe. I've been cooking for 50+ years and this is by far the juiciest, most flavorful chicken I've ever made. I like that I can vary the spices to suit the occasion too.

I lied! Part 3!  AllRecipes must have changed the format of their review page.... no way to change to a new paragraph, just the 'done' on either my phone, or tablet..                                   In spite of the review, by Fran, I consider myself a good cook, know my way around the kitchen!!                                     That being said, some nights, the simpler, the better!                Like another reviewer, all I added was some Italian Blend Seasoning, to the melted butter.                                           Chicken was moist, flavorful, and so, so easy!                          Will be making this, repeatedly, trying with different spices.      Thanks for sharing!

This turned out great!!  I made some substitutes though, Instead of adding salt, I used salted butter and added  accent and also added garlic powder, onion powder, pepper, and a dash of A1 sauce.  I also cooked them at 400 degrees since my chicken breast were a little bit bigger than normal.  They turned out great!!  Will make this again.

Instead of salt, I used Mrs. Dash. It came out excellent, although the baking took a little longer than 40 minutes (closer to 60, actually, probably my oven's fault). 

Great dish, thanks for sharing!

I hadn't made boneless skinless chicken breasts in eons!  We like the bone-in.  I wanted to try something different.  So moist...I added some minced garlic and Mrs. Dash...whatever seasoning you've got in your pantry.   DELISH!

The only thing I added was a chopped clove of garlic and made sure to flip it halfway... it was DELICIOUS. Easily the easiest and tastiest chicken breast I’ve ever made. Can’t wait to play with this recipe!

I've made this many times using it as a base that I can expand on.  It's easy to add a few spices to get a flavorful chicken breast.

Very moist and a new nice flavour that blended well with stir fry veggies and spaghettini laced with olive oil, garlic powder and Parmesan cheese.  Will use this again, but might try it with olive oil instead of butter.  Just for health reasons.

I make this all the time and use different spices depending on what I have.  Just sprinkle salt and pepper and whatever spice I am in the mood for.  So easy, and really delicious.

Wow!  I never would have thought of using butter.  In place of salt I used Fajita Seasoning and some garlic powder mixed with the butter.  I had 3 full size boneless breasts.  Cooked for 45 minutes at 350F but did not quite reach required meat temperature so cooked for 5 more minutes.  Just a tad dry but my husband and 17 yr. old son scarfed it up.  Will definitely make it again.

I read the entire recipe including the footnotes, unlike some who made the negative reviews. This is a wonderful base recipe to make perfect chicken breasts. Per the footnotes, I added garlic powder, paprika, and a dash of Italian seasoning. Came out perfect. I’ll be using this style of cooking chicken breast for my chicken Alfredo in the future. Thank you for the recipe it makes chicken breasts amazingly tender and yummy.

I liked it, but it was too bland for my husband. I made it as a main course, so I used garlic salt instead of just salt. I also added a little pepper. I'll make it again with more seasonings.

The recipe itself is definitely a 5 Star.
I'm rating for my personal experience.
I took 2 two chicken breast; pounded  them just a touch since they were a bit thick.
Followed the recipe from there.  Rather dry.
But...I don't think my thermometer is right and the calibration of my oven is off.
I'll try again

It is important to add spices to this method of preparation. I added salt, pepper, onion powder, and thyme for my first attempt. Chicken was flavorful, tender and juicy. I will experiment with spices in the future to change it up. We really liked this!

I added juice from a half lime as I needed to use it up. Added a heathy amount of lemon pepper along with the salt.  Put about four small potatoes quartered in the baking dish too and they soaked up the butter beautifully.  Great meal.

With such basic ingredients, I doubted it would really be good. But the chicken melted in my mouth. I too added some Adobo and garlic seasonings. I saved the recipe....it is a good reminder that a good dish doesn’t necessarily need to be complicated.

Just ok. It’s so easy to bake chicken, so why not just add your spices and salt that you like?  I’m not sure I like the butter. I used convection bake and it took longer than stated.

Worked out great.  Instead of melting the butter, I just tucked little pieces of it under the skin and baked.

Nice basic recipe. The butter added a good flavor. Be sure to test with a thermometer, my breasts because of size, required about 10 additional minutes.

This is an easy way to cook delicious chicken without any fuss. I used checken tenders instead of chicken breasts, so I shortened the time. Also, intead of salt, I used Montreal Chicken Seasoning. I used this chicken to make chicken salad  for sandwiches.

I'm giving this 5 stars because it is so simple and so moist, tender and yummy - and because if it hadn't had so many high ratings, I would have passed it by as being "too simple." I'm glad I tried it! Even my picky kids ate it, and that's saying something.

I used olive oil instead of butter, added a garlic and herb seasoning, and cut the thickest parts in half so all pieces were a uniform thickness. It was delicious. Moist and flavorful. To those of you who are saying your chicken was tough and rubbery, it's NOT the recipe, it's the CHICKEN! It's called "Woody Breast Syndrome." Google it.

This is an easy go to for chicken breasts, and much less messy than my usual recipe.  The chicken is moist & you can add in  or vary the seasonings to get a flavor you like.  Butter makes everything better!

Simple and tasty. My family loved it. I added the Costco garlic salt mixture into the butter for some flavoring on the chicken. I'll be making this again!

Nice moist chicken breast even when it was left in the oven too long due to guest insisting on talking to me when checking doneness.  Sprinkled some za'atar seasoning on it before putting in oven and it was great - just a nice gentle touch of spice.  Did it again a few days later and used a fine herbes mixture on it, again moist and tasty and was not dried out when having it cold next day.  Have not used chicken breast a lot as it always seems too dry but will now always do this recipe.  By the way, the pan juices make a great gravy!

The 12 year old daughter made this while I was at work one evening.  I ate the plate she left me and it was delicious.  It was easy enough with the limited ingredients.  She said that next time she wants to make it with some rosemary.

Easy. Wanted to add a little more flavor so based on other reviews used garlic salt instead of just salt. Mistake - garlic took over. Would make again as written or try other herbs. Made single chicken breast - didn't even need 30 minutes. Keep checking temp so it doesn't dry out.

What a delicious, simple way to bake chicken.  I customized according to my seasoning preferences: to the melted butter, I added 2 tsp lemon juice, 1 T soy sauce, black pepper, cayenne, and garlic powder, and no salt.  Timing of this recipe is good.  I poured the finished pan juices over rotini pasta (with a T of ricotta).  Yum!

Stayed moist, which was awesome - but it was way too salty. I think with less salt, this would taste much better. I also added 1/4 tsp black pepper, 1/2 tsp each onion powder and garlic powder.

I just made this, and oh its so good.  So juicy. I pound my chicken to about 3/4 inch, since mine are always so thick. Melted butter, added salt, garlic salt, garlic powder, garlic and garlic juice. Poured about 1/2 of mixture onto lightly salted chicken, cooked for 15 min at 350 degrees, added the rest of the butter mixture and finished cooking it for another 15 min.  Covered it with tinfoil for about 10 min, and served.  Definitely will make this again.  So flavorful!

Super quick and simple! The only change I made was, I added more seasonings. I added a generous spread of jerk chicken seasoning and garlic powder. It turned out super juicy and flavored - my husband loved it! I will be making more of this!

I doubled the recipe, thinning out butter with some olive oil and sprinkled on powdered garlic, some paprika and a little herbes de Provence. I used chicken cutlets and boneless skinless thighs . The dark meat produced more sauce. Family agreed that everything really is better with butter.

VERY GOOD EASY  Yes this is very fast and easy and flavorful.
I did add the dill and paprika which helped. Watch the butter,
less is fine. Turn a few times in the butter to get the look.
Thighs worked well.

This is a wonderful way to prepare tender, juicy chicken breasts.  I used to "poach" them in butter in a covered sauté pan on the stove top, but somehow forgot about this method and was happy to be reminded by this recipe!  I did them in the oven as called for in the recipe, let them rest for a few minutes before slicing.
So simple, so good!

I made this using a garlic butter sauce with a little extra seasoning to give it flavor. I cooked it for 40 min and the last 5 min I put parmesan cheese on top and turned on the broil to give it some color. It was so moist and juicy.

Easy way of baking chicken. I used Himalayan Pink Salt, smoked paprika, ground some peppercorns on top but thought it was a little bland. If I make it again I will try different spices. It was moist & I know it would be great in chicken salad etc.

The chicken was definitely juicy and moist. I've always been nervous about cooking/backing chicken breasts, but no more. Based on others' reviews, I added some garlic salt, paprika, and the second time I made the chicken, I added a bit of sage. This will be my go-to recipe for chicken breasts.

This is a great, simple recipe.  My husband and kids thought I did something "special" but I didn't...just followed this recipe "as is."  Complimented the sides I chose to go with it very well.  Will use this over and over again, I'm sure.  Thanks!

I normally do not like breast meat. This was excellent.  Moist and tender. I used a little more butter than called for . Will make and EAT again!

This recipe is not bad however it definitely needs some kind of flavoring ingredient. Whether it is dried or fresh herbs, salt alone will not give it enough taste to do justice to the juicy outcome of this very simple recipe. I added pepper, dried thyme, and powdered garlic to the melted butter. The outcome was a very nice and juicy breast. Will do it again but next time I think I will try another type of herb. As a base recipe, the possibilities are endless for this chicken, especially because the addition of the herbs made the juices from the pan very tasty!

Simple and tasty as written. Easy to adjust to your own tastes if you like. I added 1/2 tsp. each of garlic, thyme, and lemon zest.

My boyfriend really liked this recipe. It is very simple and some people prefer really basic tastes. I did have to cook these a little longer most likely because my chicken started frozen.

This does not have enough flavor for me and my family. I don't understand all the rave reviews. I made it as directed, but added a little Montreal chicken seasoning. I can't imagine how bland it would have been with no additional seasonings. Won't be making again.

Very moist and easy to make.  I did add garlic powder and onion powder since others said it was bland.  I didn't have to bake it as long as stated but maybe the chicken breasts I used were smaller. I will be making this often.

Loved this simple easy recipe. I would say that is can be a bit salty. So either use no salt butter or reduce the salt measurement by a little bit. The second time I made this dish I reduced the salt, by 1/4, used salted butter and added basil, bacon (4 stripes) and garlic (1 tablespoon crushed) and a sprinkle of crushed red pepper.  So fabulously delicious either way!! This is a must make dish.

Made according to the recipe, it was bland and boring.  Ended up using BBQ sauce to give it some flavor.  It was'not as juicy as expected either.

This is a deceptively simple recipe. I added no other ingredients and the chicken was moist and flavorful. It's a big hit at my house. And the leftovers are yummy in chicken salad or  atop a green salad the next day...if you HAVE any leftover!

Very moist! I did add some more herbs and spices since it was a main dish but the cooking method does make it very, very moist. I will definitely use this method going forward.

I made this exactly as written.  Although the chicken was nice and juicy, it came out of the oven perfectly white and looked nothing like the photo.  My husband said, "Are you really going to make me eat white chicken?"  It looked really unappetizing.  I put it under the broiler for a few minutes which helped a little.  If I make this again, I would brown it on the stove in my cast iron skillet and then add the butter and salt put the skillet in the oven.  I think I'll stick with the Kraft recipe which uses only four ingredients (chicken, mayo, parmesan cheese and Italian bread crumbs) and looks and tastes delicious.

Tried this and it came out dry.  With chicken breasts I feel it is much better to have bone in with skin on and just roast it, no butter needed.

I made it exactly as the recipe indicated. It was delicious and I didn't feel it needed more herbs or spices but I served it with sugar reduced cranberry sauce. I do think it needs something more and I'm hoping to find other sauce ideas in past and future reviews.

This chicken was delicious and simple. I used garlic powder, onion powder and salt on thighs from which I removed the skin and fat. After baking them at 450 degrees for about 40 minutes, I poured   the juice that was in the pan over them before serving. I will definitely make this again. Thanks for such a good recipe.

This is the basis for a quick easy chicken dish. I've been doing it for years. Sometimes I use garlic salt and sprinkle with Parmesan cheese half way through the cooking. Last night I used garlic salt and smoked paprika for a bit of barbecue flavor. Use whatever spices are your favorite.  There will be a lot of buttery liquid to drizzle over your chicken.

I thought this recipe was exceptional!!  I used bone in chicken breasts because they have more flavor.  I also used garlic powder, seasoning salt and pepper along with the butter.  I cooked it at 350 for about 30 minutes and it was juicy and delicious.  Would definitely be making it again!!  Perfect for my low carb dieting!!

Awesome! My husband said it might be the best chicken he's ever had... I just used 1t poultry seasoning in place of the salt and the whole family ate it as a main dish. Super moist and delicious!

Made exactly to recipe and for a quick chicken dinner with only 3 ingredients, it far surpassed my expectations.  I added just a touch of garlic and would recommend cutting salt in half.

Awesome, simply way to make chicken breasts come out moist and tender and tasty. If eating it in this form (not for other recipes), I include a few shakes of garlic powder, onion powder, paprika, and parsley. Perfect every time.

I sprinkled mine with McCormick Chicken Seasoning instead of salt, and they turned out moist and flavorful.  I used large chicken breasts and baked for 40 minutes at 350.

This recipe was juicy and flavorful. I seasoned mine with salt, pepper and garlic; I also added a frozen winter vegetable blend mix to it, it was very good. I will be making it again.

I have never had a baked Chicken breast that wasn't dry as a bone and had the texture of shoe leather...until now. This was so incredibly easy and delicious and literally melts in your mouth. I added minced Garlic and papricka and also the remainder of a package of McCormick's grill spice (tomato, garlic and basil). Definitely a keeper.

Great way to cook hormone free chicken breasts! I cooked them at 350 degrees for 50 minutes because they were very thick. I followed recipe but added a few tablespoons of lemon juice. I will be using this recipe from now on as I have become allergic to all of the prepared spice mixes. With this recipe I know I'm eating simple ingredients but the chicken is still very tasty.

This is the first time I have ever made chicken breast that it turned out GREAT!  Usually my chicken breast turns out overcooked and dry.  Not with this recipe though!  This was juicy and full of flavor.  I used bone in, skin on chicken breast and gremolata under the skin as well as melted butter over top.  Our guests said that this recipe is amazing and a keeper!

I was genuinely surprised how good this was.  I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts  and used some seasonings, pepper, and mixed butter and olive oil.  The flavor was great, and they were really tender.  It's easily adaptable to suit your tastes.

Just a couple additions but this was delicious! I sprinkled emeril's seasoning on both sides of the chicken and chopped fresh garlic that I sprinkled on the bottom of the buttered pan and then on top of the chicken. Baked as directed and at the last 5 minutes decided to include asparagus. Simple yet delicious.

As the initial poster stated, this is a wonderful base. It leads to incredibly moist chicken, but it requires your own touch in order to add some flavor. In reading other reviews, I sprinkled garlic and basil on top of the chicken after brushing on the butter mixture, but I found that it didn't do much flavor-wise once I was eating it. I then salt-and-peppered it on my plate and it made it wonderful! Next time, I would simply salt and pepper the chicken breasts in the pan and see how that works. I really liked this method for getting moist, baked chicken. I also added some cut up carrots to the pan and they baked in the melted butter and were delicious!

Surprisingly good!  My package had 6 chicken breast halves, so I adjusted the butter and spice amounts accordingly.  I just melted the butter in the bottom of a 9x13" dish and dipped both sides of the chicken into it before seasoning.  Baked 3 breasts as written, 3 others with extra seasoning (pink salt, pepper, Hawaiian spice, and a little paprika),  seasoning both sides and turning all after baking 10 minutes.  The more seasoned ones that we ate for dinner last night were very tender and moist.  (Thanks for the tip not to bake any longer after reaching 165 degrees to keep it tender.) The other three breasts are waiting to be put into tonight's casserole.  This recipe is so versatile and will be repeated often at our house.

This is a great recipe that I will use again and again.  I used bone in chicken breast with the skin on.  I used coarse sea salt and a little pepper added to the melted butter.  My husband raved about this dish and I loved it to. Moist tasty chicken. Paired with acorn squash and a green salad it was an easy meal with little cleanup.  Thanks.

This chicken was delicious. A neighbor girl was having dinner with us and my daughter says "doesn't my Mom make the best chicken in the world?". I would say it was a hit and was so fast and easy.

Very nice and easy basic recipe.  I used it for chicken sandwiches (chicken salad one meal, sliced chicken for another).  I actually like it better than my usual boiling method (for sandwiches) and I like that you can cook several pieces as written for this purpose and jazz up some pieces for a dinner entree all at the same time.

Really easy to make and it was good.  My pieces were quite large so took much longer to cook, about 1.5 hrs  and although the outside was sort of dry the inside was so moist.  Mine didn't look anything like the pic.  I would make it again and hope it will look like the pic.

I started weight watchers last week and baked skinless chicken is in a lot of their easy recipes.  This chicken is so tender and juicy!  This time I am going to cut it up and make chicken chili!

This was really easy, but it was very bland and we has to add a sauce as we were eating it. I don't recommend this.

Easy, but I did add a few other things based on reviews. Garlic powder, onion powder and smoked paprika. Chicken was flavorful and tender. Thanks!

Fantastic!! I added dill, paprika, and garlic salt as suggested by naples34102 because she always has great ideas. It's fantastic because it's so incredibly easy.
