My boyfriend who considers himself an honorary Mexican and has eaten a LOT of posole in his life said this is the best he's ever had! Now that's a compliment! It had a nice deep smoky flavour, tender meat, lotsa yummy hominy, just a little background of spicy, and a good broth-to-goodies ratio. Some notes: It did take me about an hour or more to get to the first simmer, although I was going at a leisurely pace. I subbed 1/8 tsp allspice because I was out of cloves, and used whole cumin seeds crushed with my mortar & pestal. I topped it with fresh lime, cilantro, shredded mexican blend cheese, extra crushed Mexican oregano, chunks of avocado, and homemade tortilla strips with cumin & corriander. I wish I had cabbage though. I think the crushed oregano really put it over the top. IMO it didn't need the cheese. Thank you so much for this awesome recipe I can't wait to eat the leftovers today!

This recipe was awesome!! The thing I did differently was that I used hot instead of mild enchilada sauce, and also I used leftover broth from my freezer (from carne en su jugo).  I also cooked the pork roast whole and shredded it after it was cooked.  I also served mine with cabbage, onion, raddish, limes, tostadas and hotsauce. Thanks for sharing this recipe.

I cannot tell you how delicious this recipe is, it deserves 10 stars! If you would like to make a healthier version you can also try it with turkey bacon and beef stew bits, if your store does not carry poblanos use canned green chiles.  But let me be perfectly clear when I say this recipe is fantastic as is! I am mexican american and this tastes exactly like what I grew up with, the flavors are perfecto!!!

Hi Ken! Yours is our new favorite posole recipe. The blend of chiles is spot on. I used blsl chicken breast instead of pork loin as this is what I had in the freezer. Condiments: sliced radishes, shredded cabbage, sliced scallions, sour cream and lime wedges.  Fabulous! Thank you for sharing.

AMAZING!!!  Made almost as written and this just may be my new favorite soup recipe, definitely makes the top 10 at least!  I let it cook on low for 2 hours before adding the hominy, and then another hour on med-low and the pork was melt-in-your-mouth-fall-aparty!!!  Next time I'll cut the recipe in half though cause it makes a VAT, I froze half but it won't be in there long =)  Seved it with sliced radishes, avocado, sour cream, a lime wedge and fresh fried tortilla strips.  I know some people like cabbage in Posole, but I prefer it without... Heck, some people put pig's feet in there too but I won't be making that addition either!  I just LOVE this recipe, and it is authentic enough for this Gringa =)

This has become a family favorite.  I've made a few changes, so the rating reflects that, although I would rate it 4 stars when made as written (which I did the first time I made it.  For my taste, the hominy has a good "bite" but no flavor.  So now I add 2 14.5oz. cans of white hominy and 2 14.5oz cans of sweet corn.  I don't like to mess with all of those peppers on a normal weeknight, so I substitute 1/2 cup of salsa verde for both types of peppers.  I also use this recipe when I have leftover pork tenderloin to use up, so I can skip that part of step 3, and just add the leftover pork with the stock.  I think that I would like to try adding one more can of enchilada sauce in place of one cup of stock; I think the enchilada sauce kind of gets "lost" in all that broth, so I'm going to give that a try the next time I make this.  We serve it with tortilla strips, shredded mild cheddar and sliced avocado.  Love it!

1-27-2018 ~Sometimes I can get pretty long-winded in a review (it’s my tendency overall).  This time, however, I’ll be brief.  Make this.  Now.  Exactly as the recipe directs.  Just make double what you think you’ll need.

This is one of my favorite Mexican stews.  All the ingredients come together with full flavor.  I also roasted the jalapenos (about 6), used about half the amount of chicken broth and garnished with sour cream and fresh avocado.  Delicious!

This was really good although I made some adjustments. I didn't use any bacon, I thought it would take away from the actual flavor. I also left out the cloves, personal preference. I fried the pork in a little olive oil instead. Otherwise I followed it exactly and it was so delicious and comforting. Served it with some warm corn tortillas.

Made this for my family's Sunday supper and everyone LOVED it!  I read the recipe wrong so I only had half the amount of hominy needed (bought two 14.5 oz cans) so I threw in a can of black beans.  Thanks for sharing, I'll be making this again.

Yum! Both my hubs and I really enjoyed this. Being HUGE fans of all Mexican food, I did not doubt for a second that this would receive a thumbs up in our house. My hubs said this was by far the best meal I've ever prepared and even commented that it tops his all-time favorite - chicken & dumplings! :) The only downside is that this takes a considerable amount of time and effort to prepare. I felt like I spent more time chopping, dicing and roasting than I did actually cooking the posole lol. If it weren't for me working from home these days, this would have to be a special weekend meal. I usually make slight changes to new recipes, but didn't this time. THIS IS PERFECT AS IS. DON'T CHANGE A SINGLE THING!!! The poblanos are perfect in this. They are earthy and once roasted, impart a WONDERFUL somkiness. The bacon also adds another level of smoky flavor and the hominy adds texture. On this note, I advise that you splurge for Mexican oregano and NM chile powder. Both have unique flavor profiles that complement this particular posole nicely (FYI, Mexican oregano has a stronger flavor, perfect for holding up to the boldness of Southwest cooking). Topped with shredded cabbage, sliced radish, cubed avocado and a squeeze of lime (a must!), this was a delicious meal. Warm corn tortillas were the perfect accompainment. Thanks for sharing another great recipe, Ken! :-)

Never made posole, or eaten posole before- what was I waiting for??  This is delicious, and the leftovers are even better.  I left out one jalapeno, for the sake of my anti-spice kids, but there was still enough kick in it!  Loved topping it with avocado, fresh tomatoes, and cilantro.  We'll definitely make this again!

So flavorful!!!  I didn't have the pablanos (I know, (I know) so I roasted a red pepper and threw it in instead.  The seasoning is perfect in this!  I topped mine with radishes and red onion!  Thanks Ken!

ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL!!!  I followed the recipe exactly (including the ground cloves), and Hubs and I couldn't quit eating it.  I wasn't able to find the 14.5 oz size can of red enchilada sauce, so I added the entire 20 oz. size can but don't feel that this changed the taste.  I put everything in my slow cooker and cooked it on low for 6-7 hours, and it was PERFECT!  Try Ken's recipe - you won't be disappointed!!!

This is one of the best recipes I have found on this site.  I make no changes to it and it turns out delicious every time.  It does have a small kick, so for those of you sensitive to heat, I would be wary.

This Posole is really amazing! I used pork sirloin roast because it was cheaper, but the meat was very tender and it didnt even have to cook a whole 2 hrs. I also used regular chili powder because I didnt have the mexican kind and I substituted ground cloves for italian seasoning. I have to say I like this Posole better than my mother in laws and she is from Mexico!!!!! 5 stars all the way, I cant wait to make this for her to try!

This recipe is amazing!! Even my two mexican friends were really impressed. We have young children in the household so we omitted the jalapeno peppers and it was one hit and one miss.. It was perfect for a cold day and not too hard to make. I will definitely make this dish again and again.

This stuff is great.  I had never eaten posole before so didn't know what to expect.  Except for it being a little too salty for me, it was really good.  I used turkey bacon rather than regular bacon and fried it in olive oil to make it a little more heart-friendly.  A bit of sour cream on top really makes a huge difference--fantastic.  Will definetly make again.

This recipe is delicious!! The only other time I have had Posole was at a Traditional Spanish celebration with friends from Mexico who own a Mexican restaurant, so it was the real thing. And this recipe is almost identical. May be too spicy for some. Def needs the lime and cabbage to garnish. I served with warm corn tortillas. Thanks for this recipe!

The only thing I did differently is that I used a fresh New Mexico Chile from my garden in place of the powder. This was excellent! I love me some soup/stew and you could really taste the roasted peppers yet all of the other ingredients stood on their own as well too. The flavors all came together so perfectly. As far as the garnish goes well, top it with what you like or don't top it at all if that is what you choose. The radishes did add a nice touch but they were not necessary. Thank you so much Ken for a wonderful recipe. I highly reccommend this!

This is the best recipe for posole hands down! My wife is from old Mexico and I cooked this for her birthday, needless to say She went crazy for it and let everyone try it. It was gone way to fast. I usually don't like posole but this one was superb. Thank you Ken.

Great dish. Easy to prepare though while I'm not the fastest microwave in the kitchen - I'm not slow either, 20 minutes prep time just didn't do it for me. I was closer to 40 min at least. I will do it again and double the recipe and freeze some (2x the prep doesn't mean 2x the prep time). Love the taste. Could be a bit hot in the flavor if you aren't used to spice.

My 3rd or 4th batch is simmering on the stove as I type this.  I try to follow the recipe as exactly as I can and it is delicious every time.  It is so good, I have given a batch of it as a gift.  The only ingredient substitutions I have made are:
 
** Pork sirloin roast works just as well as tenderloin, just trim the fat when you slice into cubes.  Sirloin roasts usually seem to be cheaper.  

** Grocery didn't have Poblano peppers, so I substitute with Pasilla peppers.  

** Was out of fresh or chopped-in-a-jar garlic, so I used powdered. 

*I like the cilantro better as a topping instead of cooking it. 

*Half/half with yellow and white hominy, just because.

It does make a huge pot of soup, but being that it is pretty labor-intensive, that makes it worth your while.  It freezes and reheats perfectly, so that's what I do.  Once it's cold in the fridge, it thickens up and I spoon it into foodsaver bags and freeze it in those. I think it is actually even more tasty reheated.  Awesome recipe, Ken.

I've tried many posole recipes and this one is by far the best yet. I didn't use either of the peppers because we're not into spicy spicy, but my family LOVED it.

We've been making this for a couple of months now, and it is absolutely delicious!  I've made it on the stove and in the crock pot.  Either way, its just awesome!  I usually skip the bacon and bacon grease, just because I don't usually have bacon available.  The only other adjustments I made was reducing the chicken broth to 6 cups and adding another can of enchilada sauce.  And if I feel like its a little brothy and thin, I'll add a mixture of a Tbs of cornstarch and a little water to thicken it up a bit.  Don't forget to serve it with sliced avocados, lemon squeezes, shredded cabbage, chopped onion, and crumbled tortilla chips!! YUMMY!!!!

This was freakin' awesome.  I love Posole, but the addition of the cloves and enchilada sauce really sets this one above all others I have made.

There were no poblanos at my grocery store (crazy since I'm in Texas), so I used hatch chilis.  I prefer mine quite a bit hotter than what this came out to me, so I will either use some serranos in the next batch or add a couple of drops of Blair's Sudden Death sauce to it.  I like olives in my posole so I also added some sliced black olives and since I didn't half 2 pounds of protein, I invited my arch enemy, a can of black beans, to the party as well.

One small complaint would be the sodium level.  I didn't need to add the 1/2 teaspoon of salt with the enchilada sauce and chicken stock, but I did anyway.  Next time I'll omit that and half regular chicken stock and half low sodium stock.

Genius!  I have had posole before and this is by far the best and most flavorful I have tried.  I followed the recipe exactly except they didn't have poblanos at the store, so I used anaheim's instead.  It is amazing!  I want to make this for everyone I know now because nobody should be excluded from this deliciousness.

Love, love, love it!  This has become our new favorite soup and also was a hit at a recent work party.  A few times I substituted roasted Hatch green chiles since it was what I had on hand, but kept everything else the same.  We like to top it with diced white onion, more cilantro and lime juice.  Thanks Ken!

In one word, YUM.

I did tweak this a bit, but I know the original recipe is probably even better.

I used some shredded pork I made/froze a few weeks ago.  I also omitted the bacon/drippings, substituted enchilada sauce with more chili powder, cumin, oregano, and a can of tomato paste, added a can of black beans, and the store didn't have any poblano peppers (BOOO) so those were left out.  Even so, this was still such a fantastic dish, VERY flavorful.  My husband loved it so much, he was coming home on his lunch break to eat it.  This will definitely be made in my house again!

Never had Posole before so I have no "yard stick" to compare it to.  This was a "killer" hearty "stoup".  The tooth-feel of the hominy combined with all the other flavours and textures made it a joy to eat.  I added crumbled chicharron to top it, gave it a smokey richness.  *Slurp*!!

I've never had Pasole so I can't speak to the authenticity of flavor this recipes provides, however, I will say that we all really enjoyed this meal! I was skeptical to add clove, but so happy I did. The flavors are perfectly balanced and the pork was tender and delicious. I followed the recipe exactly and wouldn't change a thing. Ken, thank you so much for sharing.

This was excelente!  I doubled the recipe, except the onion and jalapeño, in order to use the 6lb can of hominy that I bought cheap.  I also threw in about two cups of shredded chicken that I had pulled from a rotisserie chicken and was needing to be used.  Mmmmm.  Very good.

WOWEE WOW WOW!!  After moving to the southwest this summer I knew once it cooled down a bit I wanted to try posole. So far I haven't seen it on any menus so I thought I'd make some of my own and I'm SOOOO glad I did, this recipe was  E X C E L L E N T !!  I prepared it just as written except once I had all the components finished I put them into a LARGE CrocPot and let it cook on low all day. I shared it with neighbors who have lived in the SW for 30 years and they also said it was the best they'd had. I have a feeling I'll be making this regularly during the "cool" weather ahead. THANK YOU SO MUCH KEN for posting your recipe!!

GREAT recipe!!! Did just a couple of things different but this recipe would stand alone just fine. My differences...
*Roasted the Poblanos and Jalapenos at the same time. Did not cut them or anything just roasted on the sheet and peeled when cooled, then deseeded. 
*Added 1 diced carrot in with the onion and garlic
*Had to use 4 cups of homemade broth and then 3 cups of Swansons flavor booster and water. 
*Used one can enchilada sauce (mild) and 2 small cans Rotels enchilada sauce (hot),
*Only used one large can of hominy. It was just too much for our taste. 

My husband LOVED it and I felt it was near spot on - being hispanic I have had my share of Pozole and Menudo. This would rate right up there with my grandmothers!

I LOVE this!  I've never had posole before and did a search on here for it.  I found three recipes that I saved and this is the first of the three that I tried.  I'm thinking I may not need to make the other ones, as this was fantastic!  I did adjust the amounts on some of the spices just because I'm not crazy about cumin or oregano.  I also added twice as much stock to make it more of a soup than a stew.  For a topper, I fried some thin tortilla strips and next time I'll make sure that I have avocado and cabbage on hand too.  Now how soon can I get away with making this again...

This came out more like soup... I was a little disappointed as the first posole I had was really good and it is roasted in the oven for a few hours. That made the pork very tender and fall apart yummy. This isn't as much... and the red enchilada sauce threw me off...

Sensational.  We used pork neck bones and added smoked ancho chiles.  We have been looking for a recipe that came close to the homemade posole we had recently in AZ.  This had the kids begging for more and now it is one of the most requested meals we have.

Although I've been a member for quite some time, this is my first review!  Ken, my husband wanted me to thank you for this most awesome posole recipe.  I didnt change a thing, although hubby poured about half a Modelo (mexican beer) in it while I was looking!  HA!  Fantastico!  Thank you!

I made this exactly as written, except I used medium instead of mild red enchilada sauce. The heat was just right...not too mild, not too spicy. Everyone loved it! Have chopped cilantro and shredded cabbage on hand to garnish, and it’s perfect! Note: this recipe makes A LOT, truly serves 12, so consider this if you need to scale.

My first time making posole....its delicious!! It has an amazing aroma. The new Mexico Chile powder makes a difference. I used some leftover shredded pork I had which worked just fine. Thank you!

This is fantastic.  I made it like the recipe except I used canned chilis instead of roasted peppers simply because I couldn't find these peppers at the store.  We loved it!

This was delicious! I had hoped for some extra to freeze, but after everyone got seconds there was none.  The broth was wonderful.   I had leftover Boston butt pork roast, so I started with the sautéing of the onions and garlic in a tbs of bacon grease, added all other ingredients, including chopped pork roast, and simmered for 30 minutes before adding hominy. Simmered another end 30 and voila! half the time but same deliciousness.  (Did cheat with roasting poblanos.  Used equivalent amount of jarred fire roasted green chilies, which gave some heat but not too much)

I have never had posole before, but this recipe is DELICIOUS!  The whole family loved it, right down to my 18-month old!  I made it exactly according to the recipe and made lime and radish garnishes for it.  We will definitely be making this again!  :-)

This recipe is GREAT!!! I did everything as written except add cilantro because I don't like it. Otherwise the soup was incredible and I'm so glad that you don't have to make a lot of changes to make it something awesome. You should really make this its well worth it.

Incredible flavor! I couldn't get poblano chile so I just used a can of diced green chiles. Topped with cabbage, avocado, and lime and served with flour tortillas. So good!!

I’d give the recipe 5 stars if it had instructions for cooking with dried hominy. I’ll figure it out, though, because the ingredients are kick-! But the hell with ”mild” red sauce — I like it HOT!

I loved this recipe!! 
Things I changed, I used Ortega Chile’s and blackened on bbq. Omitted the jalapeños. And didn’t have clove. 
It was the perfect amount of spice but my husband thinks it was still to spicy. This soup is one of my favorites!  Will definitely make again, the hubby will have to fend for himself when I’m craving this

Excellent, but I didn’t follow the recipe exactly. I skipped all the bacon and I put everything in a crockpot on low for ~ 12 hours (overnight). Topped with radishes, lime, cilantro, and cabbage.

Made it for the first time yesterday for the family. I did have to add a few more things to it though cause I had more meat because I used pork butt instead of pork loin. Pork butt is more flavorful, juicy and the spices soak right into it. I followed this recipe to a T. I added 2 onions another helping of garlic some cayenne pepper and more Mexican chili powder saute them together threw it in the pot with the rest. Otherwise let's just say this was a hit!! Just enough spice and kick and the family loved it.

i think next time i'll trim off the fat  pieces from the cooked bacon before i add it to the stew. i like the addition of whole peppers. the taste isn't quite as strong as i would like, i'll have to find out how to change the spices. I think my wife may like it because it isn't very spicy.

Made this for friends and family for New Years and it was fantastic!!!  Roasting the peppers added great flavor.  Followed the recipe exactly with the exception of omitting one jalapeño as I have a toddler and didn’t want to overdue the spice.  It had a nice bite of heat, that suited us all.

Holy hell!!!! Hats off to Ken in Cali for this tasty dish! My wife swapped out pork for chicken, basically because I love chicken pozole. But this recipe!!! Amazing flavors. My wife prepped it one day and we let it mingle overnight and JUST ate it. I’m sweating from this dish and it’s been years s8nce a dish made me sweat as if I just ran a mile - and I don’t run at all. If you’re in the mood for a dish that will guarantee a spot in heaven for Ken and you for making it - just do it, your loved ones and your stomach will sing your praises!

Holy moly. This recipe absolutely blew the others out of the water. I'm a multigenerational Texan who has frequently traveled to New Mexico, and my brother's family has lived in southern NM for some time now. In short, I've tried more than one recipe/restaurant version. This recipe turned every other on its head, however.  Deleting EVERY other recipe immediately. I used beef instead of chicken stock, and the garnish as per usual was a defining part of the recipe. Must haves: avocado chunks, sour cream, and a squeeze of lime. I also added cabbage shreds to the bottom of the bowl, and feel free to add thinly sliced radishes, cilantro, and/or shredded cheese on top. So. Good.

Love, love, love this.  The first time I followed the recipe exactly.  Since then I increased the poblano to 3 and use a pork roast chopped in 4-5 large pieces.  I brown the large pieces and shred when done.  This just is easier than cutting the pork into cubes.  It didn't change the flavors.    I goofed the last time and only used a 10 oz can of enchilada sauce....be sure to use the larger size in the recipe.

Wow!! A dish of delish!! Made it as written the first time around. The next time I made it I added cooked and diced chicken breast and it was every bit as good. My family requested that this be put in the regular rotation. Thank you for posting the recipe!

Delicious!
I've been wanting to make this for a while, and decided it would be the perfect meal to send off 2017. 
I followed the recipe exactly, except: 1) I added a 19oz can of enchilada sauce, because the store only at 10oz, or larger, and 2) I cooked the pork loin in my crock pot for 6 hours. Seasoned it with all the spices listed, and poured about a two cups of the chicken broth over it, that I transferred to the larger pot once the pork was ready to go in. Soooooo tender and juicy, added a nice flavor to the soup base. 

The flavors in this posole are great, and just the right amount of "kick". My boyfriend said it was the best thing I made all year. ;) Will definitely make it again!

This is delicious! We used our leftover smoked turkey, and cut down in the garlic and the cloves since I wasn’t sure how that taste would compete with the smoky flavor of the turkey.

Fantastic! My boyfriend loved it and said it was just like his mom used to make. He has already requested it again. We garnish with radish, cilantro, chopped onion, cabbage and lime juice.

Very good!  I cut the pork back to 1 pound instead of 2 pounds.  I did not add the chili powder or the cilantro and it was still delicious.  My hubby liked it pretty well too!  Yahoo!

Very tasty pozole and close to the traditional latin Christmas, New Year or fiesta styles .  Every family has their own recipe and secret ingredients.  I didn't use the red enchilada sauce as I prefer the white or plain style.  Peppers and spices were blended, adding several small tomatillos with a cup of the hot cooking broth.  After blending, just poured back into the cooking pot.  I used a 6 lb 9 oz, 2.97 kg, can of Juanitas hominy, with apologies to the Mexican side of my family.  A bit of work and time cooking but equal to or better than most restaurant versions, if you can even find them.  Grand recipe with plenty of room for your own additions or changes to come up with your own family's recipe.  Remember to always add love to it.

Great recipe. Family loved it.  Used vegetable broth for half of the broth, chicken broth for the other half  and decreased total broth by 2 cups.

Unbelievably delicious, made exactly as posted except added cilantro ( cooking cilantro can  cause a funky flavor) as a garnish, along with avocado, cabbage, radish and fresh lime. crushed a few tortilla chips on top and perfection.

I tried this recipe because last time the recipe I used was too spicy for my husband. He loved this recipe. I made a couple of small changes - I used a 28 ounce can of mild green enchilada  sauce (because that's what I had on hand), reduced the chicken stock accordingly and omitted the bacon and bacon drippings to reduce the fat content. It was excellent! Thanks for sharing this great recipe!

I have made this recipe at least 6 times in the last 2 years. My family loves it! I had not had pozole before, but I liked the flavors of this and was told it was very authentic tasting by my Mexican step daughters. Then I had pozole at this great little restaurant in Mexico City and I was shocked how close this recipe came to theirs. Excellent and worth the time it takes.

I made it and tweaked the heck out of it. Didn't use any pork just chicken and shrimp. I used a pinch of oregano, cayenne, cumin, and ground cloves. I used Kick'n chicken season by Weber and garlic salt. I also added 1 can of black beans and 2 cans of white hominy. I used 3 poblano peppers, canned tomatoes, and 1 red bell pepper. It was the bomb! I garnished with pico de gallo; lime; avocado; sour cream mixed with horseradish; red radishes, and Monterey Jack cheeses.

Have made a similar recipe, but this knocked it out of the ballpark.  Never used cloves in posole before and it gave it an interesting note (actually didn't have cloves so used allspice in it's place).  Would probably just do a literal sprinkle instead of 1/4 tsp or omit entirely next time.  Served with thinly sliced radishes and corn tortilla strips that I cut and fried and it was tremendous!  The recipe does make a lot so will freeze leftovers for a cold, winter afternoon/evening.  Thanks much for sharing!

I followed the recipe exactly, and this turned out fabulous!  The pork was fork tender, the flavor a were perfectly balanced.  Not too spicy, certainly not bland. I wouldn't change a thing.

I've made this over and over and over again. I have a little left over in the fridge as we speak, but it never lasts long. I love floating hunks of soft goat cheese in my spicy soups. I started doing it in my chicken tortilla soup, but I love it in this soup as well. This stuff made me grow a poblano pepper plant in my back yard, just so I always had peppers at the ready. I'd never used them before, and now I'm hooked. Thanks Ken, you rock!!!

This was very good. I added lime juice at the end and a couple of hits of a chipotle hot sauce I have because I wanted a bit more heat. Served with chopped cilantro and diced avacado. This is a keeper!

I had never made pasole or even really eaten any but I made this and it was EXCELLENT!!!  I left out the cloves otherwise made the recipe exactly as written.  I do make my own enchilada sauce - take a few handfuls of several different dried chilies (Hot chilies for a hotter sauce, mild chilies for a milder sauce) cut the stems off and break them into large pieces and cover them in water.  Simmer for 20 to 30 minutes and puree with an emersion blender or in a regular blender.

I have since tried this at my local Mexican restaurant.  They serve theirs with sides of chopped cabbage (2 small handfuls), a couple tablespoons of chopped onion and some chopped cilantro (instead of adding it during the cooking process-keeps the flavor better?).  
I am going to add the above to my next batch when serving.

EXCELLENT - this has become my favorite.

I've been looking for a posole recipe for a long time but now I've found the best. This is sooo good on a cold winter day, it just warms you from the inside. My neighbors are originally from Mexico so I thought I'd see how it stood up to the real test. They loved it and said I could fix it for them anytime. I've done both pork and chicken with pork being the favorite. I think the bacon and that little dash of clove puts this over the top.

I did not have poblano peppers, nor cilantro, substituted a can of green chiles and halved the recipe.  This was fantastic, could of only been improved if I had those missing ingredients- loved loved loved it!!!!  I should say I simmered for about 10 hours on our wood stove- so it would be awesome in a crockpot
