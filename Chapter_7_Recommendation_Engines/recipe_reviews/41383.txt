My guests reported they really liked these.  The only problem I had was that the casings on the sausage did not hold well on the skewers, especially after sitting in the beer for a couple of hours.  This made them a pain to make...but according the my guests well worth it.

Excellent combination of flavors; although, next time I'll probably cut down on the onion amount a little.

So good.  My boyfriend loved it.  I marinated everything in beer before I skewered- just an idea for others.

The cheese was a good idea...the rest of this wasn't anything particularly interesting.

Spicy good. I use shredded provolone, hot Italian sausage and different colored peppers along with the jalapeno. These are really good with or without the provolone. Thank you ROOKIE_WOOKIE.
