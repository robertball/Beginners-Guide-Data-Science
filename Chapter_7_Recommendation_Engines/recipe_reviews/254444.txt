I had a slushy version of this drink at a restaurant and loved it. Was very happy to find this recipe. I used a full pineapple and adjusted ingredients accordingly. As I prefer less sweet I omitted the sugar, triple sec and almond syrup. 
I put the grilled pineapple, rum, ice cubes and squeezed lime juice into a blender. Had this as a slushy and also tried it as a tall drink by adding lime sparkling water and quartered limes to the slushy mix. 
Loved the flavor and will make this again.  As the rum is already mixed in, any leftovers can be put in the freezer and it will remain in slushy form.

I'm normally not a big fan of mai tai cocktails, but this was just so interesting with the grilled fruit that I had to try it. It was so good, I'd definitely make it again for a party.
