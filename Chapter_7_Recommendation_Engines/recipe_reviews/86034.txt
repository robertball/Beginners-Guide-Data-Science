I made this once before and then again about five minutes ago. Instead of using dill pickles, I used about 3 TBS of dill relish (with a little juice). I used 9 or 10 olives, and more like 1-1/4 cups of mayo. I'm not a big parsley fan so I omitted it. I chopped the onion, relish, and olives together as instructed and added maybe a teaspoon of lemon juice... It's so good, especially after an hour or so. I love tartar sauce, and this is the best I've had yet! Thanks for sharing, Jackie!

Also, just did it in a mini-processor, but it was lacking something, so i added the juice from a small lemon, could have even used more, but excellent :)

Just good stuff!  It was super easy, I tossed everything in the food processor, I added a bit more parsley than the recipe called for, just because I love fresh parsley, and it was WONDERFUL.  So far the best recipe I've found on this site!

I loathe sweet tartar sauce. Loathe it. This is perfect. This replaces my old favorite tartar sauce, which I used to think was perfect. I was wrong. This is it. And, it gets better after a day or two. Yow.

Pretty good.  I didn't have any onion so I used a little chopped garlic and I added a dash of LA hot sauce.

This was really great. I made my own mayonnaise in a food processor and then added the other ingredients and blended. Looked just like the photo. Added a little lemon juice at the end. Thanks.

It seems I can never just make a recipe, even one as good as this I used 1 1/2 cups light Hellman's mayonnaise, added 2 TB or so  of capers.This depends on how much you like capers and how much you're making. I made four big servings, Then added lemon juice, one tsp per serving. Used a little less pickle and added 
Tabasco hot sauce to taste. My tartar sauce turned a pretty pastel pink.The onions are important. Don't be stingy with then, they add a little crunch. Do refrigerate it for up to a day before using to let the flavors marry. Cajun Belle

This was good, I used dry parsley instead of fresh.  Next time I will try the fresh.

Very good tartar sauce recipe!  It really does get even better the next day.  I added a splash of lemon juice per some of the reviews and used dried parsley instead of fresh BUT those were the only changes I made.  I plan to use this one again!

This is the first time I made this and scaled it down to 4 servings.  I used calamata olives instead of pimento stuffed green olives because that is what I had on hand.  This is the best tartar sauce I have ever tasted!!  Thanks for sharing

Taste just like the tartar sauce from Catfish Charlies in Corpus Christi. It's best if made ahead to let the flavors blend.  Much better the next day.  I don't change a thing.

Super easy to make. I made salmon cakes and  this sauce  was the start of the dish.  I used red onions and ready to use Dill Pickle relish.  Same amounts with about 1tsp of the relish liquid to make it look more like a dressing.

I made this as is. It was pretty good. But next time I made it I used Miracle Whip. It gave it more zing.
