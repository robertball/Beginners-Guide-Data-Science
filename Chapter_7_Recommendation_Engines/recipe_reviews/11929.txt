This was great.  I didn't make it in a crock pot, though.  I made it as an entree by adding 1 can mushrooms, and 2 shredded chicken breasts. I used Healthy Harvest whole wheat egg noodles, which I slightly undercooked. Instead of chicken bullion (which I was out of), I used beef bullion.  I also added 2 tsps of dill and instead of the hot sauce, I used 2 tsps of hot paprika.  I sauted the onions and mushrooms, then heated the ingredients through and put it in a cassarole dish.  I baked it for 25 minutes at 350.  It came out great!  Next time I am going to replace the water with either sherry or marsala (not the cooking kind, blech!). My husband loved this.

This is a FANTASTIC side dish!  Great with grilled pork tenderloin, hamburgers, steak!  I baked this at 325-degrees in a 3-quart lightly greased casserole for 60 minutes!!!

I found this noodle dish to bland and, when cooked in the crockpost as suggested, to be a large gummy blob. Even the kids wouldn't touch it. I was very upset at the time and expense for something totally inedible. I made it for an event and it was the only item that was almost totally uneaten.

Excellent meatless noodle dish!!!! Next time i'm going to add mushrooms. It has a wonderful creamy texture and a good flavor. I cooked it in the oven at 350 degrees for about 30 minutes until it was hot and bubbly.

Followed the recipe to a T and it was wonderful. I did not find it in any way bland or dry. The flavors really complimented one another well. I think this dish would be good with some beef, pork, or even tuna added to it for a hearty main dish. Thanks for sharing an easy recipe!

Great, creamy side dish. I used light sour cream and 1% cottage cheese. I did cut the recipe in half, so I cooked on high for 2 hours and low for 30-40 minutes. Had a few crispy noodles around the edges, but the pasta wasn't mushy. Also instead of the can of soup I used Homemade Cream-Style Soup Mix from this site. This would be a great recipe for a dinner party when you don't want to worry about all your dishes at the last minute :) And I would definitely serve this one to guests. Thanks for a great recipe!

Very tasty.  I added chunks of chicken that I sauted with some red pepper.  I didn't have poppy seeds so I used caraway seeds, they added a great underlying flavor. Next time I will make a half batch or freeze half because this was a TON of food.  Almost wouldn't fit in my crockpot.

I love this recipe - I add ground beef and pork and serve it as a meal  -  I put in the crock on low in the AM, and it is ready when I get home from work  -  about 8 hours.

I enjoyed how simple the recipe was to prepare. I think I would add mushrooms next time or even some sausage to make it go farther, but over-all I thought it was a good dish. I also baked this in a glass dish instead of a slow cooker, keeps it from becoming a big blob:)

The family liked this. Igave it four starts because I didn't. I didn't like the cottage cheese, but I'd never had it before so I didn't know that I wasn't going to like it. Made it exactly as the recipe states. Family yes, preparer no.

I am of Hungarian descent, and the dish my grandmother used to make is just the noodles, cottage cheese and sour cream.  It's very plain, but has always been one of my favorites.  It takes very little time to make and is much less caloric.  It also makes a good lunch dish.  Adding a little garlic powder would probably make it more flavorful for those who don't care for it plain.  To me the recipe is overkill in both calories and effort.

Terrific!! Something New!! This is my first time preparing a Hungarian dish and the pasta was great. Next time I prepare this dish, I am going to add tuna or chicken to the pasta, since this is a dish you can add meat to. I really enjoyed this pasta dish and it is a meal in it self. Thanks you very much!!

This was very good, DH really liked it and I thought it was pretty good. I made only slight changes - using cream of celery soup because I didn't have the cream of mushroom. Also I didn't have any poppy seeds so I used 1tsp of caraway seeds as someone else had tried, plus a shake of celery seed since I had the celery soup too. We used fat free cottage cheese & sour cream and it was very flavorful - we'll have this again.

Pretty tasty. I made it with cream of chicken soup, left out the parmasan, and used low-fat versions of sour cream and cottage cheese. Cooked for 3 hours in an 8qt crock pot (10 servings size) and it was fine - had a nice thick crust on the outside. Next time I may double it just to fit my crock pot.

i found myself with an abundance of egg noodles.  rather than hold onto them for my usual uses, i decided to make this as a main dish tonight. i added some chicken that i fried with onions and dusted of paprika. i did not have 'cream of' soup so i made my own.  i also subbed some leftover ricotta for the cottage cheese. (i also cut recipe in half) turned out really good. i put everything together and baked (covered) for about 40 mins at 350 degrees. thanks so much for the post CORWYNN DARKHOLME!

Yes, you can make this in the crock pot without the dish becoming gummy.  First off, cook the egg noodles only halfway.  I don't suggest you cook in the crock pot for the 3-4 hours. I did 2 hours on high, then you can turn down to "keep warm".  I did 2 hours on high and about an hour on low, which almost overdid the dish.  I added 1.5 lbs cooked ground turkey and a can of mushroom pieces.  I didn't have onion or poppy seed on hand.  Even my picky eater ate it up.  4 stars based on the original recipe which would have been overcooked if followed to a tee.

Not bad; a little bland, as if it is missing something. Other than that, a quick hearty noodle side dish.

My family didn't like this recipe.  I think that it might have been the worchestershire flavor.  It also wasn't as creamy as I would have liked.  I may try again with a few changes.  Thanks.

Very, very good... in fact it's better than you expect it to be.  I have been asked to share the recipe twice!  Only recommendation I'd make is to be sure you use a high grade cottage cheese.

Pretty good! Very similar to a now discontinued frozen favorite of our family ~ Stouffer's Noodles Romanoff. Other than leaving out the poppy seeds, I followed the recipe exactly. Will make again!

Pretty tasty. I made it with cream of chicken soup, left out the parmesan, and used low-fat versions of sour cream and cottage cheese. Cooked for 3 hours in an 8qt crock pot (10 servings size) and it was fine - had a nice thick crust on the outside. Next time I may double it just to fit my crock pot.

I made this for a Hungarian pot-luck at my neighbors.  It was just OK.  I was assured that this was Hungarian alright, but I guess I didn't find it very exciting.  I probably won't make it again unless requested.

Delicious! Rather than the slow cooker I baked this in the oven at 350 for 30 minutes. Was a nice accompaniment to a pork loin and green beans with walnuts.

I used 3 cups cottage cheese and only 1 cup sour cream but followed the rest of the recipe.  Family and co - workers  were pleased.

I was looking for a different side dish to serve with Grilled Short Ribs and made this. My family really liked it. I didn't find it bland as some other reviewers described it. It was exactly what is was meant to be. I do agree with some other reviews that this would make a great main dish with the addition of protein. I will definitely make this again.

I too don't  trust noodles and slow cookers or crock pots, So I took advice from one other review..  I mixed it all together and baked 25 minutes or until bubbly.  Came out GREAT! Family FAV!

I had high hopes for this recipe, but, it was awful. I made it as written and couldn't think of any change that could redeem it.

I took this recipe to a crock pot cook-off and won. I added chopped mushrooms and sauted them and the onion before adding them.

I made this dish according to the recipe given and it turned out very well. The noodles weren't over done and it was very tasty. By way of greater clarification, I would add the following to the instructions: 

Cook the noodles to al dente (4 min. in my case). 
Dissolve the chicken bullion cubes (I used "Better than Bullion") in a 1/4 cup of boiling water.
Cook in covered slow cooker on high for 3 hours, or until onions are just crisp and cheese is light brown.

Note: If this is served as a side dish (we ate it as an entree) it's probably much more than 10 servings.

Very good.  No hot sauce needed.  Bake in 350 oven for 30-40min., or prepare ahead, refrigerate, then bake for an hour.  Could add chicken or tuna for a main dish.

I brought this to a party, and it was very, very popular.  I personally didn't think it was extraordinary. It's ok.  But boy, kids and adults kept coming back for more helping!  It was a crowd pleaser for sure.  Very easy to make, comforting and filling.

My hubby absolutely loved this! I used Kluski noodles instead of wide egg noodles, because they're his favorite. I also added slightly more hot sauce to give it a little bit more of a kick. Great recipe!

It was great on the stove top but dried out and mushy in the slow cooker. Still tasty, if you could get past that feeling in your mouth.

I thought this came out rather good.  I didn't have the hot sauce so I subbed in hot taco sauce.  I used the oven at 350 for 30 mins; no crockpot needed.

I brought this dish to a Hungarian theme dinner with friends and it was one of the biggest hits. It's delicious and very simple to prepare. I'll make it again at home.
