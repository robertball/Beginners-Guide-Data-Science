I thought this recipe was a good starting point, but found it a little vague.  Here is what I did - 
I boiled the chicken in a little water with a garlic clove and salt until done.  I let the chicken cool until I could handle it and I shredded the chicken by hand (PERFECT in this soup).

In the soup pot, I sauted the onion until tender, added the chicken and spices and then added the rest. A REALLY good salsa to use that won't make it too tomato-y is a small can of "Embassa" salsa.  This can be found in the international isle of your grocery store.  It has a more fresh tomato taste than your normal jar of salsa and it's probably a quarter of the price - $1!

I boiled the soup for about 15 minutes and I think the thing that really finished this soup and made it more of a meal - I cooked some minute rice on the side and let people add as much or as little to their soup as they liked. I also added about a 1/2 can of drained and rinsed black beans. This gave the soup a little more substance.  Also - I used a LOT more chicken broth than the recipe suggested - a 48oz can of low sodium chicken broth, as well as 3/4 of a box (the resealable). I don't know if the broth would have been enough if I had followed the recipe.

This was delicious and could not have been any easier to make.  My husband threw all the ingredients into the crockpot and let it cook for about 7hrs.  Right before we ate it, he just took the chicken breasts out, shredded them up, and put them back in.  Great flavor for such easy preparation.  My recommendation is to use good chicken broth like Pacific or Imagine brand, and pepper jack cheese on top.  This is a great way to use up stale tortilla chips.

Our whole family (and many friends) LOVE this recipe!  I have made it many times with leftover cooked chicken or a deli roasted chicken...super easy.  I use a medium spicy corn and black bean salsa, and add diced bell or poblano peppers to the saute.  We then add a can of black beans and some cilantro to a double recipe. Instead of purchased chips, I use regular corn tortillas, cut them in half, then cut into narrow strips.  Spray with a little cooking spray, add salt to taste and bake in the oven until crisp.  They look and taste great on top of the soup.

Crockpot friendly and delicious. I quickly threw all the ingredients (including frozen chicken breast) in the crockpot (except the chips) and let it cook on low all day. A few minutes before dinner I took the chicken out and shredded it. It was perfect and SOO easy! I will definitely do this again and again. (Husband and kids loved it too!)

I made the mistake of tasting the soup BEFORE adding the tortilla chips and cheese and I added salt to the soup. The tortilla chips and cheese have plenty of salt--no addition salt is needed.

This was OK.  The instructions weren't clear about the chicken.  It was difficult to "mix well" the garlic and cumin with two whole breast halves.  Also, it never said what to do with the chicken after it was sauteed.  So after the soup simmered awhile, I took it out, sliced it, and added it back.  Personally, I think sauteed chicken is not as tender as poached.  Next time, I will poach the chicken in the broth and shred it before making the rest of the soup.  I will also sautee the onions beforehand so they're not so crunchy.  Maybe add a little less salsa, as a whole cup was a bit overpowering.  Definitely replace lime juice for the lemon.  I've seen restaurants that serve lime wedges with tortilla soup.  It's more "Mexican tasting" to me.

Absolutely wonderful! Quick and easy. I used a can of white corn, 2 tablespoons of chopped cilantro and upped the cumin but followed the rest of the recipe to the letter. While everything else was cooking, I allowed the soup to simmer (maybe one hour or more) and it reduced nicely to become a very THICK soup. I know some people said the broth was too thin. Do put the chips in the bottom of the bowl (I used large Tostito brand. So good. I also shredded the chicken as it was cooking so that it would be evenly spread throughout the soup.

Absolutely delicious! Followed the recipe with no changes. Next time I will use shredded chicken (just because I like the consistancy better than chunks of chicken) and add a can of rinsed black beans and double the recipe because it disappeared quickly! A definite keeper!**update, I made this recipe with black beans and shredded chicken....YUM!**

I highly recommend this recipe.  It's very easy to make and most of the ingredients are probably in your pantry. I had no chili powder so I used cayenne pepper instead. After I cooked the chicken for a few minutes, I added the onions and sauteed it for about 2 minutes.  Garnished with cheddar cheese, green onions, and a dollop of sour cream.

i was VERY pleased with the flavor of the soup. It wasnt too spicy for the kids, but not bland. I served this with steamed rice, and i used chili cheese flavored frito chips instead of tortilla chips :]. It was so freaking good. This will def. be in my recipe folder for a long time.

I pretty much followed what "NMR" said to do with this recipe.  I took the easy (and just as good) way out and used to chicken from a rotisserie chicken and shredded it with my fingers (with gloves on).  I then sauted the onions in about 1 tbsp of olive oil, added in the garlic at the end (so it didnt burn), then I added the spices (I used about 1/2 tsp of cumin and probably closer to 1.5 tsp chili powder) and the shredded chicken.  Then I added 3 (regular) size cans of chicken broth and the Embassa salsa that NMR suggested.  I also added in about a cup of corn and a can of drained and rinsed black beans.  I let it simmer for about a half an hour.  We put the tortilla chips in the bottom of our bowls and spooned in the soup.  Added cheese, a dollop of sour cream, and fresh avacado on top.  For me, the avacoda was the icing on the cake.  This was very full of flavor and filling.  If you are thinking this sounds good....trust me....it is!!

Very tasty! Took advice from others and added black beans, lime juice (as opposed to lemon, as the recipe calls for), cilantro and extra corn. I also made my own homemade chicken stock and used that in place of canned broth. I think it makes a world of difference.

5 stars with these changes...these changes make this really good recipe FABULOUS!
Boil chicken instead of sauteing so that it shreds much easier.
Saute onion, garlic and peppers in EVOO
Use 3 cans of broth, then mix some cornstarch with a 4th at the end to thicken.
Use 2 cans corn - or 2 cups frozen corn.
Use 1 T chili powder. You'll never taste a 1/2 t as the original recipe calls for.
Use 1/2 t cumin instead of 1/4.
Add one can Rotel tomatoes

I love this soup and serve it again and again with tortilla chips, shredded cheese and sour cream on top.  Here's a tip that helped me save time: Throw everything in this recipe (minus the toppings, of course) into a crock pot/slow cooker and let it simmer for several hours.  You don't have to cook the chicken that way, as long as it's diced, and don't have to worry about blending spices.  It tastes amazing and is SO much easier. :)

This was awesome, and will become a staple in our house.  IMHO, the soup is way better when ladled over the chips.  Rather than getting soggy, the chips will disintegrate, adding thickness, richness and body to the soup.  When the chips are crumbled on top of the soup, all you have is spicy chicken soup with flat cornmeal croutons.  Which is not necessarily a bad thing, but which is a long way from the wonderful substance which is tortilla soup.

Anyway, this soup is amazing.  Great flavor, not horribly labor-intensive, and not horribly bad for you.  (Except for the cheese.  And the sour cream.  And the deep-fried tortilla chips.  Other than that . . . totally healthy.)

This is a big hit with my family.  I put all the ingredients (except chips & cheese) in the crock pot in the morning and cook on low.  I also shred the chicken after cooking and before serving with the chips & cheese on top.  My 3 boys devour it!

I only gave 4 stars because I felt that to make it a five star recipe it needed some changes.  I used the advice of some other reviewers to come up with this variation:

I used 8 cups of chicken broth, 3 chicken breasts, 1 can of corn, added black beans, and doubled the salsa and spices. We served it with sour cream, cheese, and tortilla strips.

A tip for shredding the chicken: if you put cooked breasts in a KitchenAid mixer with the paddle attachment while they're still hot, running it at medium speed for about 20 seconds will shred it up for you! So much easier than using forks :)

You are going to hate me.  Yes, I did the evil thing and changed the recipe.  Not a lot. Not really anyway.  Ok, here's what what I did. I boiled the heck out of a chicken carcass that still had a lot of  meat with it.  After picking the carcass clean and tossing the bones, I added more broth. Since I was cleaning out the fridge, I added some leftover garlic Mashed Potatoes that were left over from a previous meal. Gave it a good, thick flavor. The seasonings and the remaining directions were as Ms Betty stated.  Verrry good.  The sour cream and cheese on top is sooo extra good.!!Thank You

I used leftover rotisserie chicken from Costco and added one can of black beans, drained and rinsed. I added two ears of fresh corn on the cob, 1 tsp. cumin and ½ tsp. of chili powder. I added 2 garlic cloves, chopped and 1 cup pace picante mild chunky salsa, 2T of tomato paste, just to give the background of the soup a little depth and dimension. I allowed the soup to simmer for a while to reduce and thicken up a bit. I also tossed in some fresh chopped cilantro for color, taste and freshness. I used Tostitos lime flavored chips, which is salted, so I didn’t need to add any salt to the soup. I also cut some fresh corn tortillas into thin strips, sprayed baking sheet with Pam, baked at 350 degrees for 15 minutes. I garnish the soup with a dollop of sour cream, shredded cheese, green onions and a squeeze of lime juice. It was a delicious, filling soup. The tortilla chips and black beans add a nice texture. The soup is seasoned just right, not too spicy, and fresh tasting. The chicken is tender and I really like the sweet corn niblets. I served this soup with a moist and flavorful, “Absolute Mexican Cornbread,” also from this website.

DELICIOUS!!! Put sliced avocado, shredded cheese, broken-up corn (blue or yellow) chips, and YUUUuuuuMY! I think we'll use sliced black olives on top next time too. You can use chips to eat it as well. This is my favorite kind of soup and I love how simple and delicious this recipe is.

This soup was AWESOME! I am not the greatest cook because I don't have the confidence in it. But, I am proud to say that I made this soup and I made it well. I even changed a few things to suit me. I used all the ingredients are posted below. I did use precooked/cut chicken strips though. Basically, I cooked the chicken in the crockpot  for 3 hours with enough broth to cover the chicken and I added 1/2 of all the seasonings. Also, I used a suggestion from another person and used the Empasa cans instead of salsa. After those 3 hours, I removed the chicken and shredded it. Then I added all the ingredients into the slow cooker and let it cook overnight on low. 
When I served this, I set out the tortilla chips, cheese, sour cream, and limes for garnish. Everyone was so impressed and it definitely made me want to try more recipes and keep getting that confidence. Definitely suggest this recipe, but also to have fun and make it your own!

Oh my this was so simple and so delicious. I also liked this recipe because it didn't make a huge amount.  I threw frozen chicken breasts into the crockpot (I shredded the chicken before serving)with the other ingredients. I used the cup of salsa and I also threw in a can of rotel with cilantro and about half a can of black beans.  I served it with sour cream, and avocado slices as well as the chips and cheese. I had seconds! I can't wait to eat the left overs tomorrow

A solid dish.  I would probably add less salsa next time, as this soup turned out a lot more tomato-y than your avg chicken tortilla soup.

I love this tortilla soup! I follow the recipe without adding/deleting ingredients and it is great. I simply wish the portions were bigger because everyone eats it up!

A great easy soup to make.   I used a slow cooker and simply put all ingredients in. (except cheese and tortillas).    Also added a bit of rice and a few kidney and black beans.
I shredded the chicken just before serving.
 It was delicious.

The only thing missing from this recipe is some beans (I prefer pinto beans) for texture and filling, and cilantro for zip. This recipe includes some essential ingredients that others leave out: corn, cumin, salsa, sour cream. Simply wonderful!

Very good soup and easy recipie.  I added leftover turkey leg meat that my husband and son wouldn't eat.  A good use of leftovers.  I didn't add cheese, as I am lactose intolerant.

This was a great base but I wanted a little more flavor so here are the changes I made: 1. I boiled my chicken and then shred it. I used 2 bigger breasts which were 1.20lbs... 2. I added 1 pablano pepper and 1 bell pepper to the veggies.. 3. I used 1 tbsp of garlic. I used 1tsp each of cumin and chili powder. 4. I used fresh corn, 3 ear and 3 tbsp of cilantro. 5. I made my own salsa. 8. I used 6 cups of chicken broth. 7.. I used corn tortillas, cut them into strip and put them in the oven @ 350 for 14 minutes with some cooking spray and some chili powder.

Followed recipe exactly except used a crock pot with frozen chicken breasts.  Started out on high for a couple hours and then low the rest of the day.  7 hours total.  Chicken was easy to shred and soup tasted delicious.  Added brown rice to soup bowl.  Yummy!

I added half and half and black beans.  Instead of salsa I used a can of Rotel.  I also processed a flour tortilla with some of the broth and added this to the soup to help thicken it a little.

LOVED IT!  I used the same basic ingredients but executed it a little differently.  Rather than sauté the chicken, I poached it in the broth/cumin/garlic combo until it was cooked through and then put everything in a crock pot on low for an hour or two.  In addition to the ingredients on the original recipe, I added one can of drained and rinsed black beans, the juice of one lime, two finely-chopped jalepenos (I like it spicy!), and, to thicken the soup, I added six crushed corn tostadas - maybe 1/2 cup's worth of crumbs or so?  Lastly, maybe five minutes before serving, I removed the chicken from the crock pot, shredded it, and added back in.

It was DELICIOUS!  Next time, in addition to garnishing with the Monterrey Jack, I'm adding avocado slices!

great recipe. I poached my chicken in the broth/onion/garlic and spice mixture then removed the chicken and shredded it, added it back to the broth, then added one can of corn and one can of black beans. I also added the juice of two small limes and a can of Embasa salsa. I served it with greek yogurt (instead of sour cream) and tortilla chips. Would be great with avocado too :)

I LOVE THIS SOUP RECIPE.  I only made a few changes after reading many reviews.  I added a third can of chicken broth (two cans is good if you are wanting more of a stew), I used lime juice instead of lemon juice, shredded the chicken after it was cooked, added a can of drained black beans (SO YUMMY in this soup) and used Rotell instead of salsa.  My three little boys LOVED it and I took left overs to my mother who took it to work for lunch and has requested I make her more.  Thank you for the original recipe Betty and thank you for all the reviews that helped me make this soup perfect for my family! :)

As I was making this, I thought the veggies seemed a bit sparse and contemplated adding some bell peppers or something but I'm so glad I didn't. One taste silenced the skeptic in me. The flavour is just too good as it is. I don't want to mess with it. Can't wait to make this again. Thank you so much, Betty!

CRAZY!!!!!So many people have saved &/or reviewed this!!!! I LOVED IT! This was my first attempt at Tortilla Soup and this is the one I chose to (almost) follow. I added black beans (rinsed). I forgot to squeeze in the lime even though I made  a special trip to the store for it!! I guess I didn't know it  was missing. I used 3 frozen chicken breasts and it was plenty of shredded meat. I also only had a box of Vegetable Broth so that was different but GREAT! 
I must say that the tortilla chips are a great addition . Just using Tostitos crunched up slightly are the way to go though. It really does add a nice texture to the soup. Didn't need the cheese either...I saved calories (yippee!) and felt it was still VERY good. Also my avocado wasn't ripe enough so I am waiting to have it with leftovers!! 
I can't wait!! TASTY soup!

Tried this recipe out on my family.... I added double the minced garlic, a can of rotel, two fresh tomatoes pureed, and only a quarter salsa. I took everyones suggestions and added a can of black beans and increased the broth by 1/2 cup. It was wonderful served with baked tortilla strips and Mexican blend shredded cheese. My 3 old liked it and my husband and 6 year old daughter had two bowls. The three year old said it was good except she didn't like the corn. She's not a fan of vegetables. Great dish on a cold rainy winter day and easy to make!

Great soup.  My family loved!  I didn't have corn tortilla chips, so I made my own by frying (375) corn tortillas  in veg. oil and then salting with sea salt - YUM!  Second time around, it seemed to need more chicken.

This was a good soup. I did make white rice and put a heaping spoonful into each bowl with an avocado slice. It was a hit! Also, very kid friendly for kids who don't like anything spicy. Personally, I would have preferred some kick but then the kids wouldn't have eaten it.

Amazing! I baked and shredded the chicken and used taco seasoning instead of chili powder. I didn't use cheese so I added a little salt to the soup. Delicious.

I had leftover roasted chicken from the night before and what an AWESOME dish to recycle it into. I shredded the chicken then put it over low heat with the garlic, cumin and oil...

I also fried my own tortilla chips using vegetable oil and corn tortillas cut into strips then salted them to my liking.

But I mixed all the other ingredients (including a salsa that was HOT and not too tomato-y) and thought the whole dish turned out great. 
I put a dollop of light sour cream on the top, followed by the tortilla strips and the Monterey jack cheese =) 

My family was very pleased!!!

I skipped the step to saute the chicken, instead I put everything in the crock pot with a raw chicken breast and cooked on low about 6 hrs.  Took the chicken out and shredded it and then put it back in the soup.  Easy and delicious!

I've had better, but as far as easy goes, this one takes the cake. I've doctored mine up with some more spices, (more garlic and chili powder) and I like it a lot. I tried another reviewer's suggestion to add white rice as a "side dish" and that is a really good idea. All-in-all, one that you should definitely try.

I found this to be bland as is...I tasted it before the end and it needed some spice and seasoning. I added a can of diced tomatoes w/ green chilies, some taco seasoning, parsly, basil more garlic and some black beans. IMO with those changes its a 5 star.

Man oh man! What a great soup! I was looking for a new way to use up my leftover rotisserie chicken and this soup is my new fav. leftover recipe. I followed the recipe and I must say it is excellent. I did add half salsa half green verde salsa for a little extra kick, although this soup certainly didn't need it. I just love green verde salsa. I did add sour cream and cheese to the soup which completed the meal (as suggested). I also added crushed tortilla chips on top of the soup as I like the "crunch" factor. I just added chips as I ate them in the soup.

I sauted the chicken and then sprinkeled with spices indicated.  Put a little water in the bottom of the pan, covered and baked on 350 for about an hour.  This made the chicken really tender and falling apart.  I used less chicken than indicated as well.  Only three breasts.  Four seemed overwhelming.  I also added more broth and seasoning to give it more liquid.  Excellent recipe with the salsa, chips and cheese !!  Much better than regular, old boring chicken soup !!

My husband and I loved this soup.  I also added more chicken broth then the recipe called for, added a can of drained, rinsed black beans and also a can of mild green chilies.  It was great because most of the ingredients we already had in the pantry.  We will definitely make this recipe again and I will make a double batch that way we have more left over.

This is an excellent, savory soup that my family enjoyed.  I did go with a few changes, namely no corn or lemon juice and substituting fresh cut tomatoes for the salsa.  However, it was delicious all the same.  Thank you for taking the time to post this, Betty.

I've made this a few times always to great raves.  Very simple. Changes I've made (original recipe first time): include  added 1 whole can of corn  and cut the cumin and chili powders in half (then put jars on the table for others to add to taste).  I also double the chicken and shred it after baking it wrapped in foil.  This is great in the crockpot.

Wow! This was great!! I took some of the suggestions and shredded the chicken, sauted the onion, added black beans and used bullion cubes instead of canned broth. I also made my own tortilla strips to garnish ontop rather than adding them to the soup. I cut up about 8 corn tortillas into 1/2 inch strips, baked them on sprayed cookie sheet for about 15 min, then turned the oven off and let them sit until I was ready for them. They were great and made the soup. I also used shredded "fiesta blend" cheese to garnish along with tortilla strips and added chopped cilantro and cubed avacado. YUM! This is a keeper in our house!

Awesome recipe! We have made this at least 12-15 times. I add a can of drained/rinsed white beans to make it heartier. If you don't like chunky soup, use the hand blender on your salsa and it makes smooth vs. chunky soup!

This is really flavorful! I did only a couple of minor changes. I substituted the can of crushed tomatoes with diced tomatoes with green chiles. I also added the juice of 1 lime, and that added a really nice flavor. Then I shredded a rotisserie chicken and added that halfway through the simmering time to allow the chicken to soak the flavors and shred up nicely in the soup. It's very good!

My kids who don't like soup were raving about this soup and calling it Yummy.  I doubled the recipe. I added chopped green peppers and chopped cilantro plus a can of black beans, drained and rinsed.  I also upped the spices and served it with Pepper Jack cheese instead.  A keeper.  Thank you so much Betty!

My husband and I love this soup. I usually double or triple the recipe. The first time I made it, I followed the recipe exactly and it was very good, now I modify based on what I have on hand. I usually use 1 can of diced tomatoes and if I triple it, I also use a cup of salsa. I up the garlic and spices and add green chilis or jalapenos, depending on who's eating it. Also I boil the chicken and I saute the onions. Sometimes I add a dollop of sour cream when I serve it. Delish

I gave this four stars, because while I feel like this would be an ok recipe as written, I really think it's more of a starter recipe. The mixtures of flavors in this are great, I just feel like it was missing a few things such as fresh cilantro and avacoado for garnish, also instead of the lemon i used lime, and finally i slow cooked the chicken in a broth and hot sauce mixture before adding it to the soup. Overall I think this was a great recipe, just needed a little tweaking for my personal tastes

This was a pretty good version but my family wasn't begging for more.  Since so much of the finished dish depends on the salsa you use, make sure you find a good quality one that you like.

This was a great recipe.  I used Chipoltle Salsa and that was great!  ALSO instead of chicken broth i had to use boullion.  I happened to have Chicken Boullion and  Chicken Chipoltle Boullion so that worked out well too! Awesome SOUP!!!

I thought this recipe was good but I also made some adjustments as some other reviewers. I cooked the chicken in water and a little oil until completely done and then cooled and shredded. In another skillet, saute onion, green onion, and cilantro (I buy this as a mix already cut up in the grocery store). Add the spices, then the chicken. Move all of it to a stockpot and pour in 2 boxes of chicken broth, 1 can of corn, 1 jar of salsa, couple of dashes of hot sauce, and a few squirts of lemon and lime juices. Place tortilla chips in bottom of bowl, pour soup and top with taco cheese and sharp cheddar cheese. Makes an excellent dish!

My husband had two bites and proclaimed, "This is a five!"  As recommended by others, I added a can of black beans (drained) and increased the garlic (to 2 tsp.) and cumin (to 1 tsp.).  I also added a pinch of red pepper flakes.  Shredding the chicken is a must...I will definitely make this again!

Since I don't have a stove for 5 weeks, I tried
this in my crockpot and it turned out great!
I buttered and broiled the chicken in the toaster oven,cut it up, put all ingredients in the
crockpot and cooked on high for 3-4 hours(or until
onions are cooked). Next time I might use less
broth and more salsa as the soup was thin although
it had a wonderful taste.

This soup is exceptional.  The flavor varies with the type of salsa used (I used Pace Lime--medium spicy). I also added a can of black beans, which made it more filling, and topped it with fresh avacado slices.

Excellent!  I substituted Swanson's Roasted Garlic Chicken Broth for the regular chicken broth, skipped the garlic and cumin, and it's the best soup I've ever made.  I haven't made it for anyone who hasn't asked for the recipe!

I thought this was a good base. I boiled the chicken first and added chili powder, garlic powder, onion powder and cumin to the water along with one large chicken bouillon cube. After the chicken was cooked I set aside the chicken to let it cool and saved the broth from the cooked chicken. I shredded the chicken and sauteed it with the onions in about 2 tbs of olive oil. I added the chicken, onion mixture to the broth and then chopped 1 zucchini and 1 yellow squash and added them along with the corn to the soup. Then I added the salsa and lemon juice along with a bit more chicken broth to give it the soupy consistency I wanted. It was so good with freshly fried corn tortillas and fresh avocado as garnish. Plus great way to sneak fresh veggies into my kids without complaints.

Really good starting point.  I have made many times and our favorite is:  more chicken broth, double cumin, a few chopped roma tomatoes, black beans,  good splash of tapatio.   Top with avacado, cilantro, cheese or sour cream is you want.   It's a hit for groups!

I thought this soup was great!. Being a firefighter, the guys I work with loved it too.  I took the advice of some of the other reviews.  Shredded the chicken, added blk beans, one can tomatoes, more broth. And used a higher quality salsa. Also gave the option for rice.  Very good. Will make again.

This is such an easy & DELICIOUS soup to make!  I added 1 cup of frozen sliced carrots and diced a few canned jalapenos to add as well.  I have made this soup countless times & never disappoints!

I can't believe how delicious and easy this soup is. I have made it many many times always using us every last drop. Very easy to personalize to your families likes and dislikes. I always add fresh cilantro and black beans, but made as is.. It is heavenly! You will not regret making this. Whatcha waiting for... Make it!

Oh YUM! I followed the more precise instructions from reviewer NMR and this turned out great. Had to sub gouda for the jack cheese cause that's what I had, but it was still pitch perfect. I also roasted a habanero pepper and chopped it up to put in my sweetie's serving, as he likes things very spicy. Yum!

My kids really liked it and said it could have been a bit spicier...I think next time, I will use the can of salsa that was mentioned in other reviews.
Great recipe for left over chicken - makes the recipe even easier!  I also substituted lime in place of lemon.  Very good soup!

This was the best soup I have ever had. I followed the recipe exactly except I used 3 cans of chicken broth and pureed my salsa because I do not like chunky salsa. I made some white rice, put it in the bowl the topped with chips, soup, cheese, and sour cream. AMAZING! My husband, son, and father said they want this at least once a week.

Very good.  I used lime juice instead of lemon juice and substituted Chipotle chili powder for the regular, which made a little spicy, but good.  Also, stirred in some avocado at the end.

My husband loves a tortilla soup served at a chain restaurant, but is rarely served. Thought about trying this recipe out, and he and I both love it more than the restaurants! Did the same tweaks as everyone else, using rotisserie chicken from the grocery store, serving with white rice, tweaking it just a bit depending on what we have in the pantry, and it's a great soup! Perfect for when there's a craving for Mexican food!

This was very good! I usually make a crock pot tortilla soup but didnt know I was making it for dinner until 4pm. So, I used this recipe and it was approved by the whole family. I followed the recipe very close except I added a lot more chicken broth. Probably about 48 oz. We will be eating this often!

This recipe is an awesome starting point!! I used leftover chicken I had in my fridge!! This could not have been easier!! I did do things a little differently. Since my chicken was cooked already, I sauteed my onion in some olive oil until it was nearly transparent. Then I added the minced garlic clove and sauteed a minute or so more. I then added my shredded chicken (shredding it was the hardest part of this recipe!!) and the spices. I added a can or black beans as per other suggestions and a lite more than a cup of corn. I used boxed broth, and used nearly an entire container. I let it simmer, but it tasted a bit bland (my boyfriend and I are spicy food people) so I added some salt and pepper, a must in nearly Amy recipe in my opinion, about 1 teaspoon total in chili powder, a dash of cayenne pepper and a few healthy pinches of my homemade taco seasoning (a mix of cayenne pepper, chili powder, garlic salt, cumin, and oregano). The soup was delicious!!! And not too spicy!!! Garnish it with some cheese and tortilla strips and you have yourself a delicious, filling, rather healthy dinner!! I will definitely make this again!!!

I love this recipe and found it to be a great starting point. I love veggies in my soup so I added diced peppers, celery and black beans. The flavor of the soup is perfect. I add less salsa, just a little for more flavoring and definitely use lime instead of lemon. Much better flavor. I also boil the chicken on the bone, shred it and add it to the soup.  Great soup and you can tweak it to your own taste. Thanks!

This soup was so easy and so tasty! I used a pre-cooked rotisserie chicken and it was fantastic! I added a little more broth since mine turned out less soupy, but nonetheless it was a easy delicious dinner! I am making it again tonight!

I made this exactly to recipe except I added a 1/4 tsp cayenne because I like it spicy. DELICIOUS!! And so easy! I just used yellow corn tortillas in a bag and a dollop of sour cream topped off with some cheddar. Amazing!

Absolutely delicious. I've made it about four times now, and I love it more every time. Changes I made: I added about double the cumin and a little more chili powder, an extra chicken breast so it's heartier, more corn, and a can of black beans. So simple and amazing.

What a wonderful soup.  My daughter made it for us and both my husband & I love it.  You can spice it to your taste.  My husband doesnt care for chicken that much so next time will cut back on it or exchange it for white beans

Quick and easy. I used 4 thighs b/c I prefer the flavor. Everyone ate it. I might add black beans next time, but that alone might turn my kids off....

REALLY good!  Freezable too.  Sauteed the onions ahead of time instead of throwing them in raw.  Also added drained black beans, about half a can.  Fresh chicken that is hand-shredded is best, it adds way better flavor.  Would give it five stars with my changes.

I definitely like this recipe.  I added some Worcestershire and liquid smoke (maybe a teaspoon of each) and I agree that it should be doubled.  I also added a can of black beans.

I always use this recipe as a base and kind of do my own thing, but the resulting dish is always amazing!  To start: I brown the onion and garlic first, then add all the ingredients except for the corn, throw the chicken in to cook until it's falling apart. Then I remove the chicken, add a cup of rice and the corn. Meanwhile, I shred the chicken and add it back, stirring the soup all the while- otherwise the rice will stick to the bottom and burn. Once the rice is cooked, I add a can of black beans- drained, let the soup simmer for another 10-15 minutes and voila!  I use blue corn chips, which I put in the bottom of the bowl, along with shredded cheese, a slice of avocado, and a dollop of whipped cream and we are good to go!

I have made many versions of this soup, but this is by far the best! I followed recipe exactly, and served with crumbled lime tortilla chips and cheddar cheese.  Also, used Roasted red pepper,corn, and black bean salsa. A wonderful soup! Thanks for sharing.

I make this all the time!  Use good chicken stock - a must.  I add chunks of zuchini and summer squash to the soup.  I serve chopped avacado and black beans as well as the sour cream and cheese on the side.  Be VERY careful of the salt - the tortilla chips and cheese add so much.

So simple and sooo good.  I had a cold and wanted a chicken soup - this was perfect.  I agree with another rater who said first saute the onions with the garlic and spices, boil the chicken and then shred when cool.  Use a less chunky salsa like on the international aisle and use chicken stock, not broth, two large boxes.  Doesn't need the sour cream or chips in my opinion, but add some cut up cilantro right before serving.  Delicious and low cal, cleared my sinuses!

I was looking for a recipe to add a little variety to our menu.  I made this for the first time but substitued a can of Kirkland (Costco) chicken to make it even easier.  That worked awesome because it is so easy to shred and add to anything.  Used a Safeway salsa that contained corn and black beans and the outcome was awesome!  Will definately make this again.  So easy, especially when you make the quick subs that I did.

Very tasty.  Didn't sautee the chicken in the oil, but instead boiled the breast of chicken in the broth, took them out to cool, then shredded.  Took the advice of others and sauteed the onions in the oil.  We love spicy food, so I used hot salsa and added hot peppers.  Thanks for the recipe.

Fabulous, fun, and easy soup!  
Leftovers were even better!
Used low sodium broth and did not miss the extra salt, as the chips provided plenty.
This soup would also be good without the chips & cheese as a healthy lunch or side dish option.

Wonderful! I love this recipe! It's so easy and simple. However, I do suggest using lime juice instead of lemon. It gives it a more traditional flavor.

I haven't been grocery shopping in almost a month, so this was something I could put together rather quickly with what I had in the pantry (which wasn't much).  

I needed to use the other half of a chicken I had boiled the night before, so I put it in a pot of water to boil (just to make some stock), and I used the stock to start off with.  While I let the chicken cool (so I could pull it apart), I sauted green onions, garlic and cilantro in some olive oil and butter, and then stirred that into the stock.  I added 2 cans of corn, 1 can of drained and rinsed kidney beans (I was out of black beans), 1 can of enchilada sauce, 1 can of rotel, 1 can of diced tomatoes, some chili powder, salt and pepper, poultry seasoning, 1/2 cup of shredded cheddar cheese and instead of using tortilla chips, I used real tortillas (I was trying to use them before they went bad).  I didn't have any avacado or sour cream, so I just topped with chopped green onions.  

It made enough for everyone to eat two bowls last night, everyone to take for lunch and guess what we're having for dinner tonight?  :)  It was really good, and everyone really enjoyed it!  (I can only imagine how good it would have been had I had all of the things I was supposed to put in it)!

Really good! I made a few adjustments: I used a rotisserie chicken from the grocery store to save time, added(2) cans of black beans, I doubled the chicken broth, (1) can of rotel diced lime and cilantro tomatos, (2.5) Cups of corn, Fresh cilantro, (1) jar of med. salsa. I let it simmer for about 3 hours, it was great!

My family's favorite soup! I make it whenever I have leftover grilled chicken breasts and just chop them (lately I've been cooking extra chicken just to have some left for this soup!) I double the spices, add black beans and usually have added a little extra chicken, too, so I just add more broth until it fits in my soup pot and looks right :) Great simmered for a couple hours and served with shredded cheese and/or a dollop of sour cream. You can add leftover rice, too.

I was so suprised how good this was! I added black beans like many have, and put almost 4 cups of chicken stock and added a bit more chunky salsa, and let it cook about an hour and a half. I didn't put soup on top of the chips, I put the chips on top of the soup to keep them a little chrunchy. I didn't have tortillas so i used fritos insted.

My husband will only eat tomato soup, and he doesn't like soup as a main dish. Well I slipped this one in on him tonight for dinner even though he was hemming and hawing about everything that was wrong with it.  WELL, he absolutely RAVED about it! Practically ran to the stove to get seconds! I poached the chicken first, prefer it to cooking in a skillet.  I doubled all the seasonings and the garlic (just because we like things that way) and added a dash of cayenne pepper. I also just used a basic salsa (Pace, I think?) and it came out perfect.  We served it with the recipe called "Tortilla Snack Strips" on top and pepper jack cheese. This is a definite keeper in our house... my 2 and 5 year old loved it too!

AWESOME and SOOOOO EASY!  I used southwestern seasoned pre cooked chicken breast strips instead of cooking raw chicken. It saved me 15 min!  It seems so basic so I wasn't sure if there would be a ton of flavor to this soup, but there is a TON of flavor! Also, I agree with everyone else... the better the salsa you add, the better the soup. I always add the fresh chunky mild-medium salsa that you find in the refrigerated area next to the fine deli meats & cheeses- NEVER the other kind (pace etc...).  One of my fav's to make!

This was so good.  Used left over chicken, diced up, also added extra broth.  The first time I made this we were out of chips so used a can of french fried onions.  Both ways turned out great.  Thanks for the post.

As another reviewer, I used more chicken broth than called for, and I used leftover turkey from the Thanksgiving bird, adding towards the end of cooking time.  Delicious.

Excellente!! I made a pot of this soup and ate up all by myself. Today I am making another pot of this soup, because my family did not get any, it was just that good especially for a sore throat. Recipe is great just as it is. This time I am doubling the recipe, so that my family may enjoy it as well. Mmmmmmmmmmm!!

I signed up for membership just so I could leave my review of this recipe. My biggest complain is that resteraunts take chicken soup-add some slice of avocado and tortilla strips on top and call it "Chicken Tortilla Soup". Not here-do yourself a favorite and stir in a dollop of sour cream-really smooths it out. And so easy! Chicken came out perfect texture. The recipe left out when to cut up the chicken-I took each piece out about 10 minutes before it was finished and shredded it, then added it back-it had cooked by then, but the end product was still moist.

My wife and I had this soup for the first time at a local restaurant and just loved it, but of course, the restaurant would not give out their recipe.  I immediately came home and searched for a recipe and found this one.  I must say, my wife and I thought this recipe was better than the restaurant's!!!!!  Can't wait for winter to get here!!!!!

This recipe is excellent!! I made it for my husband and some of his family and they loved it.  I had to double the recipe (the original is for four small servings).  I added black beans which was excellent.  I also added a little fresh cilantro - nice touch.  This is as good as you would find in a restaurant!

Good, simple & fast. I had all ingredients on hand which made it even easier. I followed NMR's review advice (shredded chicken, over 48 oz. of chicken broth, sauteed onion with the garlic and spices, add a can of drained & rinsed black beans & rice on the side) + adding some fresh chopped cilantro and it was a huge hit. I would've scored it higher but I feel like I made a mix of NMR's recipe and the original recipe. Very good!

This is a very good and easy soup! I  threw my chicken breasts in a pot with 3.5 cups of water and added 3 tsp. of chicken bullion (Better than Bullion brand). Then I added the onion, garlic, cumin, and salsa. Boiled and simmered it until the chicken was fully cooked. I removed the chicken and shredded it while the broth continued to cook down for a slightly thicker soup. Then I added the chicken back along with a can of black beans and the corn. When I make this again, I'll use 4.5 cups water (4 tsp. bullion) and 1.5 cups salsa just to have more of the "broth". I'm definitely adding this to my recipe box! Thanks for sharing.

I made my own version of this soup for lunch today. I had just made a pot of fresh chicken stock so I used the chicken meat that I had in my stock for the soup. I didn't use cheese for a garinsh or the sour cream and instqed of lemon I used lime with some freshly chopped cilantro atthe end,fantastic !!:)

Followed recipe exactly and it was light and tasty - would probably increase the corn, or add black beans next time to give it a bit more texture. Topped with tortilla chips, sharp cheddar and cilantro.

This was very good!! I did made a few modifications. I didn't have corn so I omitted and subbed a can of diced tomatoes for one of the cans of chicken broths and added an 8oz can of green chilies.  In addition to the chicken, I also added a left over pork chop that needed to be used up and I thought that it gave the soup an extra flavor.  Lastly I subbed lime juice for the lemon and added an extra two teaspoons.  It turned out absolutely delicious and I'll definately be adding this to my five star recipe box.

Definitely a keeper for two reasons - easy to make and it's darn tasty. I added chopped green pepper (one green pepper), added half a can of black beans, used black bean salsa, added a bit more cumin and chili powder, and added a can of rotel. It's delicious.

Although I added a few things, this recipe is an all-star! I added a can of fire-roasted diced tomatoes and mild diced green chilies. I did not have any frozen corn so used a can of corn. Both of my children who are not willing to try different recipes, especially anything hot, finished their bowl of soup. My daughter gave it 4 1/2 stars and took seconds!
My suggestion - double the recipe!!!

This was good, although I would double and have leftovers.  Also, if you drain the juice out, it makes a great nacho topping!

My husband loved this soup after I made a few changes to it. I halved the chicken breasts and coated them in taco seasoning before I cooked them. I also added some beans and a can a mexicorn to the soup.

I am surprised this was so highly rated.  Perhaps I'm a Tortilla Soup snob, since I live close to the border and have access to excellent Mexican cuisine, but I was not a fan of this.  It certainly came together easily, but the soup itself was not very good.  The cheese and tortillas made it edible, but I'll keep looking for a go-to tortilla soup recipe.

A couple changes: I boiled the chicken 15 min. with 1 clove garlic and salt. 

Sauteed the onion about 3 min., added the cooked chicken (now shredded) with remaining ingredients, and boiled for 15 min. 

Additionally, I made stuffed bell peppers the night before and had about 2.5 cups extra stuffing (see my stuff bell peppers recipe), and added that to the soup the remaining 8 minutes. It made the soup much more hearty!

I followed another users recommendation of putting everything into the crockpot, with a couple of exceptions.  I had cubed rotisserie chicken in the freezer so I added that, already cooked.  Also, I sauteed the onion and garlic for a minute to release their flavor before adding them into the crockpot.  I sliced corn tortillas into ribbons and fried them myself for the topping. (Don't forget to top them with sea salt) and it could not have turned out better!!!!!

Didn't have corn, but used black beans in place. The soup is good, but when garnished with ripe avocado slices, sour cream, and cilantro... there will be a party going on in your mouth.  Loved this, and will make it again!

Simple and delicious.  I add a can of black beans.  I didn't have minced garlic, so used garlic powder nor did I have an onion so used onion flakes.  Everybody loves it including my 1 year old!

Very tasty for as easy as it is.  I just threw everything into a crockpot (including frozen chicken breast) and shredded the chicken after cooking for several hours.  I added 1 tsp. dried oregano and 1 tsp. dried cilantro for good measure.  Very yummy!

This recipe was perfect! Lots of great flavor, but not too spicy, even my 1-year-olds loved it! I did poach the chicken ahead of time with onion and garlic (I think the chicken gets more tender that way), then put the rest of the soup together and simmered it for 45 mins or so. Like I said, perfect. I wouldn't change a thing. :)

Chicken Tortilla Soup V Haiku: "Not remarkable. Good, but doesn't bring the 'wow.' Maybe w/ more stuff?" This became an even easier recipe for me, as I'd had about 2 c. of cooked, shredded leftover chicken, so after sauteing the onion and garlic (w/ a bit of chopped bell pepper), it was a simply a matter of dumping in a pot. I followed the recipe exactly, and just wasn't blown away. I think I'd have been happier replacing salsa w/ Rotel, plus maybe adding some "Taco Seasoning I" spice blend, black beans and cilantro. (So if I made this again, I believe that I'd do just that, and possibly swap lemon juice for lime.) Served w/ crushed tortilla chips and cheese, it was a decent soup that only disappointed me in that it tasted mostly like salsa.

This soup has great flavor. The only thing I changed was that I liquified the tomatoes and chilies to make more of a broth rather then stew like. Great recipe.

I was in a hurry so used pre-cooked southwestern style chicken. For the chips I used roasted garlic and black bean.  The soup had a wonderful flavor.  I will definitely make this soup again but will add black beans to the pot next time.  Great recipe!

Restaurant quality, quite tasty.  Shredded chicken would work best.  I did chopped / diced chicken and shredded would definitely be better!

This recipe was great!  I was crunched for time, so I used two cans of chicken breast meat, drained.  I cooked it up in the skillet with the onions and minced garlic.  It worked out great as it shredded itself as it cooked up.  As that was cooking, I put everything else in a crock pot.  I ended up using a large box of chicken stock and a large jar of medium heat Pace Chunky Salsa.  Turned out wonderful, not too spicy!  I was hesitant about the chips in the bottom of the bowl, but tried it.  They are a must!  Thank you for the recipe!!

This was so good, I enjoyed it more than I thought I would!  I used leftovers from a chicken I roasted, omitted the oil and tossed everything in the crockpot.  The only addition I made was a can of black beans with jalapeno's.  I served it over rice and it was DELICIOUS!  My husband loved it and I will definitely put this on my menu rotation.

This soup was OUTSTANDING.  We loved it! Changes I made- boiled & shredded the chicken, then tossed it into the pot.  I also used canned corn.  I will make this a lot!

More broth, less chicken! Add some black beans and some cayenne pepper and you have some delicious soup. To make it even better, add some crushed up FRITOS on top and a huge scoop of sour cream at then end! There will be no left overs!

This was absolutely delicious! I didn't use corn, used Rotel for salsa, and hand squeezed lime juice instead of lemon juice but I'm sure that would have tasted great, too. I also used the Mexican blend shredded cheese instead of Monterey Jack. I will definitely make this again and again.

Was ok. We enjoyed , but probably wouldnt eat it it over white chicken chili- very similar. I followed the suggestion of others and added the black beans. Definitely help give a "bland" soup more a little more texture and flavor. I thought it worked better as a dip for my chips than a soup.

Very easy and satisfying recipe. I mixed all ingredients first in a mixing bowl and then poured the result over the two chicken breasts in a crock pot. After five hours at the low setting, I removed the chicken, shredded it, and returned it to the pot for two more hours.

We also cook the chicken in the soup, pull it out when it's done and shred it and put it back in. This is such a crowd pleaser. We triple this recipe and serve it on mexican night for our very large family. They all LOVE it!

This was awesome! I used an extra chicken breast and instead of chunky salsa I used Pace medium picante sauce. A also added freshly chopped cilantro which I think added a lot of flavor. The only thing I didn't care for was how soggy the tortilla chips get when you put them in the bottom and then add the soup on top, so for my second bowl I just broke up the chips and put them on top as I ate. SO YUMMY!

I didn't really like this. Maybe it was the salsa I used?  I don't know.  I'll stick with ordering it from the local Mex restaurant until I find another recipe.

We really liked this soup.  I used 16 oz of salsa for serving of 4 and the Tostitos hint of jalapeno scoops put a little bite into this soup.  I will definitely fix this again.  Thanks for sharing!

Great soup! I'm only giving it 4 stars because it wasn't as thick as I would have wanted. But I think most soups like this are a little runny. I poached the chicken in the chicken broth and garlic and then shredded. Came out great this way. Next time I'll add some pinto beans to add some substance.

OMG, that was the best soup ever. I used the instructions as a guideline and went from there. I used Rotel tomatoes instead salsa. I substituted lime for lemon added avocado and cilantro. It was a party going on. You must try it.

Really good!  I read other reviews and wanted to add black beans but didn't have any so I added drained ranch style beans.  My Fiance said it tasted too much like beans (which he hates) but I thought it was delicious! He must have too despite the beans because he ate two huge bowls. I also added mushrooms.

It was kind of bland. I added a little taco seasoning and some hot sauce. It was easy, but just OK.

I first made this recipe a little over a year ago... I made some changes after reading some reviews and it was AMAZING!  First of all, I make this in a crock pot, I throw everything in, including frozen chicken breasts, and let it cook. I take the chicken out after it's done and shred it. Shredded chicken tastes SO much better then chunks for this recipe.   I've made this so many times that I don't measure anything anymore... I just keep adding until the crock pot it full! This recipes turns out fabulous even when you add different items that you may like.   My changes... I add a package of taco seasoning, kick up the amout of cumin considerably (I just keep tasting it), add a can of white hominy, a can of black beans, I add shredded cheese in the crock pot or just when you serve it, and about an hour before serving it I add a small bag of noodles that are sold in the internation isle. They are like miniture shells, they have to be really small because regular ones get so big that it throws off the texture of the soup. They are called "La Moderna" Product of Mexico. They are only .60 a bag! They really give it what it's missing.  Served with baked tortilla chips that I break up and spray with cooking oil... just until they turn golden.  I gave it 4 stars because I add alot to this recipe, but after I'm done I'd give it 5!  When all is said and done, we have a delicious and very filling dinner! It's great to freeze and take for lunch. My Hubby LOVES THIS!!! I'm making it today

Very good!  Made the recipe as is, except that I sauteed the onions first.  Also, I recommend doubling the recipe so you'll have leftovers--it goes fast!  When it was finished, I topped off my bowl with avocado, shredded cheese, and some crumbled tortilla chips...yum!

Quick, easy, full of flavor.  I want to try with a little more heat, and better chicken (only had a can of shredded chicken and I think this needs chunks).

Really good flavor.  A little heat, but not too much.  I boiled the chicken in broth and then shredded it.  I also added a can of drained pinto beans and a dollop of sour cream.

I'm from South Texas, so I know my mexican food, and this is how it is amazing! I added some black beans and rice, and shredded the chicken after it had been simmering a while. With the added ingredients I'll probably add another can of broth next time. Avocado slices are really good on top.

Very flavorful and relatively simple.  I pre-boiled the chicken thighs with their skin on, then removed the chicken skin for my chicken and used the broth for that called for in the recipe.  I also added more garlic.  My family is a baby about spicy foods, so I omitted the cumin, used 1/8-1/4 chili powder, and 1/2-3/4 onion.  Topped with gouda cheese.  Don't forget the lemon juice, especially to minimize the kick.  My mom was surprised that she liked it.  Would make again.

I love this recipe!  It's beyond easy to make and the best part is that you really don't have to buy much that isn't already in your pantry.  The only thing I do differently is add a can of rinsed black beans and the "hot" level of salsa because I like things spicy.  I've made this in the slow cooker or on the stove and both ways work just perfectly.  I eat this all the time now and everyone who has tried it has loved it as much as me. I highly recommend the you use shredded Mexican cheese and tortilla strips as a topping.  The tortila strips I use that I think work perfectly are the Stone Ground Tortilla Strips Mission carries.  They are good texture and already in smaller pieces.  Must try this especially when cold out!

This was delicious!  
I added some minced chipotle chilies in adobo to the pot for an added kick!
To each bowl, I added chips, shredded cheese, diced avocado and a spoonful of half and half.

I've made this recipe several times and absolutely love it.  Using the salsa makes it so easy and it tastes delicious. I use a Costco rotisserie chicken and for the corn I use Trader Joe's roasted corn.  This last time I diced the onion and chicken up in the food processor first into tiny pieces and I think it made it even better.

I liked this a lot.  It is a super easy preparation and comes together nicely.  You can vary it easily based on your choice of salsa.  Overall, a really great recipe for when you need something quick and hearty.

DELICIOUS!! Agree with the vagueness of cooking the chicken but I just followed what the reviews said and it turned out great!  My boyfriend was hesitant because he doesn't like mexican food but after forcing it down his throat, HE LOVED IT!!  One thing we thought about was Fritos might be good for the tortilla strips.  Also, definitely added a lot more broth than was stated.  The great thing about this recipe is you can really adjust it to your taste!!  Will definitely be cooking this again!

I think this is a great recipe!  It's got a lot of flavor and is easy to make.  I've made it for several social events, and it has gotten great reviews.  I used lime juice in place of lemon (it was what I had) and have some cooked rice to the soup as well, just to make it a bit more hearty.

Delicious!  I used lime juice instead of lemon juice, added a can of drained and rinsed black beans and some cilantro.  I just used shredded up rotisserie chicken.  I also am trying to eat healthier, so I omitted the tortillas all together.  Really, really good still!  This took almost no time at all and is very healthy!

This is a great recipe.  I gave it 5 stars for tastyness and simplicity.  I doubled the recipe for my family of 5 and a few of us enjoyed the leftovers the next day, the soup was just as good as the night we made it.  Thanks for the recipe.

Muey Bueno!  This is a very good foundational recipe.  You can't really mess it up and it is quite easy.  I used fresh salsa from the deli department, added rinsed canned black beans.  The recipe was easily doubled.  The hubby requested "plenty of chicken" and boy did he get it.  We will definitely be eating this one again.

This is the easiest chicken tortilla soup ever! I usually boil the chicken first and shred it before adding it to the soup pot. I used a medium salsa, and the spiciness was just right!

Great and super easy recipe.  The only thing that I would add is that the chicken needs to be shredded after the 20-30 min of simmering and returned to the pot for an additional 5-10 min, to allow the flavors to soak into the chicken.  Also, a can of black beans and some chopped chili peppers would add another dimension of "yum" to the soup.

I altered a bit, but this was a wonderful base.  I added a little more cumin and instead of chicken, I used some left over smoked pheasant.  I also chopped up two jalepenos and added them in with the onions.  This was really, really good.  I will make it again.

Wow! My wife is always trying to find the best tortilla soup in restaurants.Now she has found it!I did use some previously written review recommendation's. Boiled chicken/garlic first.Let it cool a bit while preparing the same boiled water with the seasoning. Shredded chicken and added 1/2 can "Bush's best" Black beans. I used 1 large red onion for color. The salsa I used was named "Green Mountain Gringo" All natural,no preservatives,medium. This salsa tastes as fresh as fresh can be.I will use it with the recipe as long as I can get it. The kids gobbled it all up too! Great for cold night's. Try this and you will not need to look any further for a recipe/restaurant!

This soup won me a soup contest at work today!  I followed the advice of a lot of other people on here and added black beans and used rotisserie chicken instead of the chicken breasts.  I sauteed the onions and garlic for a few minutes before adding the rest of the ingredients.  It had a fantastic flavor and everybody was raving about it.  Thanks!

YUM!  I doubled this and made it in the crock pot.  I put the chicken in frozen, and shredded it a few hours before serving.  Will make this again!

This soup is a keeper!  I also made some adjustments based on other reviewers comments.  I used an oven roaster chicken.  Roasted in a pampered chef stoneware roaster - it only took  a half hour in the microwave!  I seasoned the roaster with sea salt, pepper and fresh garlic.  While that was microwaving, I sauteed 1 large onion and added in the spices, more garlic and chicken broth (I  used 48 oz).  For salsa I used Newmans own peach salsa  Yum.  I skipped the corn (no nutritional value) and added rinsed black beans.  Then dumped everything in the crockpot.  When the chicken was done pulled the chicken off the bones, discarded the skin, fat and bones and dumped chicken and all the juices in the crockpot and let it cook! I kept it on all day (8 hours or so on low). It was sooooo good.  It's already gone and I just made it yesterday.  One change I would make is to use 2 roasters because it could have used a little more chicken.  Thanks for such a great recipe.

Very good simple recipe...I made this several times for work pot lucks and everyone rants and raves each time. I also add a can of black beans as the others do and I poach the chicken gently with the veggies, it makes the stock tastier.

This is a great soup. I made it for a potluck at work and got many compliments. I did use lime juice instead of lemon and added some fresh cilantro. I also took someone's suggestion and poached the chicken breast with the cumin and garlic first to add flavor which I think was a nice addition. I made the soup the night before and then threw it in the crockpot on low for a couple hours the next day. This soup is very easy and now my family wants me to make it for them!!

I gave the basic recipe only 4 stars because I had to make a few changes.  I didn't saute the chicken before addding it to the soup because I prefer shredded chicken.  I put whole boneless chicken breasts and all of the ingredients into the crockpot and cooked for about 8 hours on low.  We added black beans and cilantro just for a little more flavor.  It came out perfect.  My 2 year old even asked for seconds!  Bonus: This soup freezed wonderfully for a quick lunch and dinner.

This was a simple, yet delicious recipe.  As stated by others, I found the directions to be a little vague, so I cooked the chicken in a pan and after it was done, I shredded it and set it aside.  After that, I sauteed the onions and minced garlic in some butter and added the chili powder and cumin to the onions.  As the onions turned translucent, I mixed everything else into the pot.  I used a can of corn (drained) instead of the frozen corn and I added a can of diced green chilies and a can of sliced black olives.
Two things I would do different (and will in the future):
Rather then adding the chicken into the soup after shredding it, I'd recommend not adding it until right before removing from heat, this will save the chicken from over-cooking and getting too chewy.  And rather than line the bowl with crushed tortilla chips, I'd garnish the top with it (just like the cheese and/or sour cream) this prevents the chips from getting soggy, keeping the additional texture.

I LOVE this recipe!!!! Very very easy to make.  I cook the chicken first, and while the other ingredients are heating, I let the chicken cool, then shred it by hand.  I also added black beans, and used a can of corn instead of frozen.  I get requests for this often!

As written I give this 4 stars.  I added a can of black beans since it just seemed to be missing something and I also doubled up of the cumin and chili powder. With those changes I give it 5 stars.

looks like a lot of us were making soup on the 25th!  I was so happy with the ease of this recipe and even picky 7 year old ate it (she'll eat anything with cheese and/or chips).  I had leftover chicken and I used tomato sauce instead of salsa (we're not salsa people) and it was very good with the substitution.  It was also a substantial soup, but not heavy.  I'll add beans next time too.

This recipe is the best, very easy, healthy, and get tons of compliments!  I always make a double recipe, use a packet of taco seasoning instead of the spices, add 1 large can of beans, and eliminate some of the measuring by using 2 cans of corn, 2 onions, and 1 large box of broth.

OMG. That was so good. I was surprised at how easy it was too. I was practically licking my bowl clean. I stir fryed the onions and fresh garlic to release their flavors before adding to the boiled soup. Garnished with avocado and Lime-flavored Tostitos==Absolute heaven. And still healthy, low fat. Just vegetables and tomato broth basically. It even tastes good without the chicken to make a stricter diet.
Also took a big tortilla, did a quick deep fry and placed it at the bottome of the soup bowl before ladling the soup over it. Very pretty

Excellent soup! I followed some others advice and boiled the chicken first with some garlic and then cooled and shredded by hand. I sauted the onion and garlic and added 2 chopped jalapeno peppers (we like things hot). I then added all the other ingredients plus a can of black beans. This soup was wonderful and certainly a keeper in my recipe box!

This is good. I doubled the seasoning to get more bite of it, which worked good for me. I also added a can of diced tomatoes. I'm rating this a 5 because I think for those who don't want it as spicy would find the original recipes to be just fine. Oh yeah, I did just throw everything into the crock pot and cook on low for 8 hours and shredded the chicken when it was done. Very easy and very good.

Easy and delicious!  I doubled the chicken broth and added extra chicken, salsa, corn and 2 cans of black beans.  Just remember that if you add extra broth you'll need to increase the spices as well so it won't be bland.  I put the uncooked chicken breasts and all of the other ingredients in the crock pot in the morning, which made it so easy.  Everyone had seconds and some had thirds, so I'll definitely be making this again.

This soup is the best!  I drained a large can of black beans and added it to the soup as other reviewers suggested.  This soup is a new favorite at our house.  I've made it 3 times in the last 2 weeks.  I would definately double the recipe if you have a family.

I had my doubts about this recipe, right up to my first bite.  WOW.  Really great soup.  Easy to make.  I put a small dollop of sour cream and jack cheese on top.  And of course, make sure you serve over the tortilla chips.  I did use 4 cans of chicken broth.  Also increased the cumin to 1/2 tsp.

i made this soup last night and it was good.  i took others advice and poached the chicken then shredded it myself. soo good in this soup. I also used the salsa Verde instead of regular salsa. i wouldn't recommend using the salsa Verde ... it was def missing that tomatoey taste that i think regular salsa would have given it. i made my own tortilla chips. i heated up veg oil for about 5 minutes then cut a huge 12 inch flour tortilla into trips and friend them omg! they were awesome. this soup is def going to be in winter rotation.

This was the best soup!  I boiled the chix and shredded with a fork!  I also added some cheese at the very end since I like the consistency and the taste!  Topped off with some fresh chopped cilantro.  For sure a keeper!

Don't let the pictures fool you. This is a fantastic soup. I intended to make it for one of my Once-a-Month-Cooking entre's, but we ate so much of it that there was nothing left to freeze! I took the other reviewers' advice and doubled the chicken & broth, added 1 can of black beans, the juice of a 1/2 lime and 1/4 jalapeno. Then I reduced it to make it more of a meal. Fabulous and filling! I'll try the taco seasoning tip next time.

This soup was awesome.  I made a couple of adjustments based on other reviews but nothing too drastic.  I used 4 cups of chicken broth, one can black beans, added one diced jalapeno and fresh cilantro.  It was delicious.  :)

This soup is so easy, fast, and delicious! I decided to add a can of black beans and that added color and another great taste to the mix. I would definitely recommend this recipe garnished with some sour cream! Thanks for the keeper!

I give it 5 stars based on the alterations I made. Foudn it really odd this had no beans or rice so I naturally added those. Added about a half cup of black beans and a cup of white rice. I added lime instead of lemon as lemon made no sense. Made this totally vegetarian using Quorn brand fake chicken which is the absolute best faux chicken u can buy. Used Whole Foods veg chicken broth powder w/ tastes exactly like chicken. I added soem smoked jack cheese shavings to the broth and a couple handfulls of lite mexican cheese blend from Trader Joe's. I doubled the entire recipe cuz as is it's just enough for 2 people. When I make soup my purpose is for left overs and this is enough for 6 people how I made it. Definitely will make again!

This recipe is very easy and delicious - one of our family's favorite meal!  To cut down on preparation time, I use precooked fajita chicken breast meat.

This was a great soup, I did just what one person did, I added taco seasoning. (It's what I had)Thank you for sharing this, I have been wanting to make this for some time and I am glad I did. I am going to take this to my next ladies meeting.

We LOVED this soup!!! And it was simple and fairly quick to throw together, too. I added about 1 cup of beef broth to the mix because I think it gives the flavor more depth than just using chicken broth alone. Also, I added one can of black beans and one can of Rotel, as some others had suggested. Once you spoon it out into your bowl, be sure to top it off with tortilla chips and some shredded cheese! MMMMM, MMMMM GOOD!!! Thanks for another great recipe to add to my archives!

Wow, this is great soup! I used 12 oz canned chicken breast and added the broth. Used Penzey's chicken soup base to make broth and added more cumin. I only had 1/2 an onion, and it was just enough for us. Also subbed lime juice for lemon. So easy to make and really the best tortilla soup I've had. Thanks so much for sharing your recipe, Sheri S; you have a winner with this one!

I loved this recipe. . .and so did my husband!  I used 1/2 package taco seasoning mix instead of Cumin and I also added some red pepper flakes to the broth for some kick.  Great recipe!  I will share this with all of my friends!

The soup was very good.  However, I did make a few changes to spice it up and keep it relatively healthy.  I rubbed the chicken with taco seasoning and let it marinate over night.  Next, I steamed the chicken breast in the oven by creating a closed foil pocket. This allowed me to omit the oil.  I also added 2t. of garlic salt and 1t. of red pepper to the soup for additional flavor.

For all the rave reviews, I expected this to be better.  The overall flavor was mild and rather bland.  A decent meal, but we probably won't make it again

My husband and I really enjoyed this. We were cooking out of the pantry, so we used a can of chicken, which turned out to be fine. I also had some chicken stock on hand made from a chicken roasted with Mexican spices. We also added a small can of mild green chilis. We were glad we did as it kicked up the flavor a bit. I'd add more spices and chicken stock next time. 

The best thing about this recipe is that it can made with ingredients ready to hand or leftovers.

We absolutly LOVE this soup.  I agree with the previous post, if I could give it more than 5 stars, I would.  I use the breast sections from a rotisserie chicken, an entire carton of chicken stock and double/triple the spices.  We also crumble the tortilla chips on top of the soup to keep them crunchy longer and add a dollup of sour cream.  Excellent recipe!!

This soup was so phenominal- it was a nice change to our regular menu!  My husband is very honest about what he thinks- and he loved this!  I added cilantro, because to me, tortilla soup MUST have cilantro!  It was a nice touch... also used a bit more chicken broth than listed.  All in all, a great recipe that can be tinkered with each time to make it a little different (and a little better!).  Make lots for leftovers- its even better two days later!

This was great.  The whole family loved it.  I used some of the other reviewers suggestion and added some of my own.  This is by far one of the best Tortilla Soups I have had and I am a native south Texan.  This will become a staple in our house.

For a short cut, I used rotisserie chicken and shredded it.  This also ensured moistness.  I sautéed the chicken in the onion, garlic and spices (doubled).  I used a whole onion and two cloves of garlic.  I also used 5 cans of chicken broth, black beans, and pace picante.  My fav add was fresh pico de gallo.  I did cook some rice and added avocado on top with the cheese and tortilla chips.  Super yummy.

This was a great, really different dinner idea. My boyfriend actually got off his chair and came around the table to give me a kiss after trying it! I basically followed the recipe, but made a few changes. I pounded out the chicken breast then shredded it, and fried that up with a clove and a half of garlic and the onion. I added about a teaspoon of seasoning salt in addition to the cumin and the chili powder. I didn't have chicken broth, so I used vegetable stock and it still came out with a lot of flavor. In place of salsa I used a can of chopped tomatoes and diced a green pepper and threw that in, along with a can of kidney beans. It was nice and spicy, very filling. I also cut up some old tortillas into thin strips and lightly toasted them in a frying pan with a bit of oil while the soup was cooking until they got crispy, then added those on top of the soup with some shredded cheese - Yummy! Will absolutely make again, very recommended!

This is an excellent soup.  I took someones advice on adding a can of (drained) black beans, which was great.  I also added a touch of fresh cilantro.   I did not put the chips in with the soup when I served it, just served them seperately for any that wanted. Used Kraft "Tex Mex" cheese to put on top.  VERY YUMMY

This tortilla soup was fantastic! It was so easy to make and really inexpensive to buy the ingredients. I made it without the chicken and it was still very filling.

Wow, this is an awesome recipe.  I love spicy food and this recipe has so much flavor. I used a mild salsa and next time, I think I might even try a really hot one.  This meal is good for busy week nights because it only requires one pot and it only took me about 30 minutes to prepare.  I'll definitely use this one again.

This soup was really tasty and easy to make, extremely fast.  I also added a can of black beans and 1 tsp. of oregano.  My Husband didn't feel that it was filling enough because the broth is so thin, but I really liked it and will be making it again. Thanks Betty.

Fantastic! I baked the chicken in lime! I also topped it off with advacado!
I served at a lunch I gave for my girlfriends, and it has become one of their favorite
recipes too!

This was a delicious soup--it was even great as leftovers.  I added an entire box of frozen corn kernels and even a can of diced tomatoes.  This gave the soup a little more consistency and heartiness.  I will definitely use this recipe in the future.

I use chicken thighs or sometimes rotisserie chicken, saute some green pepper with the onion, add a jalapeño or can of fire-roasted or Rotel tomatoes, and use the wonderful frozen fire-roasted corn now available. I reserve the tortilla chips for a crunchy topping , adding a small amount of cornmeal to the soup base for thickening and flavor. Top with avocado, sour cream, cheese,  scallions, and chips - yum!

So delicious!! I Made this soup tonight and I was blown away! Everyone in the house loved it! Easy to make & tasted great. I boiled the chicken ahead of time and used a little over 3 cups of broth and added a can of drained and rinsed black bean. I also mixed in a little cornstarch to thicken it up to the perfect consistency.  I also recommend a bit more seasoning than this recipe calls for. This is a new FAVORITE in my recipe book!

I love this recipe!  I always make homemade salsa and when we have left over salsa that is what I use.  It makes it a fresh twist on the soup adding jalapenos and cilantro while the soup is simmering away.

We LOVE tortilla soup and this recipe was a HIT with us.  There is really nothing better at any restaurant.   I sauteed the chicken with onion, garlic, parsley and olive oil in a stock pot until it was cooked and smelling delicious.  I then chopped the chicken into small pieces and placed back into the pot   I added the chicken stock and bag of frozen corn and the rest.  Cumin is a delicate matter and I added a little less than was called for.    Thanks for the great recipe I'll be making this again tonight!

This is absolutely delicious and so easy to make.  The only changes I made was that I threw all the ingredients in my crock pot and cooked it on high for 4 hours.  I then took the cooked chicken breasts out and shredded them, tossed them back in.  Served with some avocados, shredded cheddar cheese, and sour cream.  It is oh so good!

This is an awesome recipe, our new comfort food. I love how fast this soup comes together. We have been making this weekly for about a month now.  Everybody loves it. Made it for company to rave reviews. Lol.  Of course we have just been leaving the chip bag open and letting people use what they want, same with the jack cheese, and I doubled the recipe - I don't know about the author's family but you can't feed four midwesterners on 2 chicken breasts and 8 ounces of chips. We have been using medium Pace, I don't know what other people have been using. We also have been roughly chopping up a bunch of cilantro and throwing it in just before we eat it, but we're cilantro heads, my husband puts it in sandwiches instead of lettuce when there is a lot around. I tried lime instead of lemon once, but I think lemon is better. You can go complicated and start making fresh pico de gallo, or you can go simple as heck, as you wish, it is hard to make a bad soup.  I like using Penzey's chicken soup base instead of broth, I don't have to keep as many cans around (did I mention we're making a lot of this? lol!) plus the chicken flavor is more pronounced with the Penzey's (they're kinda champagne and caviar, but if you're going to spend the time cooking, might as well spend a little on your ingredients).  Oh yeah, quadrupled the spices, too.  My husband still reaches for the sriracha.

I did what the other reviewer said and boiled the chicken separate and then shredded it and added it to the broth after. I also added Spanish rice, jalapeño and garnished with avocado. I agree that you need more broth than what the recipe calls for. I had to cut mine with water to make it stretch. Other than that, it was a great soup and easy to make.

I've been making this exact recipe for at least 7 years, and love it.  I change the order, I'm sure others have done the same.  I brown the chicken breasts in a Dutch oven in a little olive oil, red pepper flakes and garlic; add about a cup of water to pan, cover and poach for about 20 minutes.  Shred the chicken when it's cool enough to touch.

I discard the "juice" but do use the pot with good stuff stuck to the bottom, and add:  olive oil, garlic, onion and cumin.  Cook for about 5 minutes til onions are translucent.  Then add the shredded chicken, broth, chili powder, lemon juice and salsa, and cook for 30 minutes.  I add the corn for the last 5 minutes (use a bag of frozen roasted corn in you can find it).

It's perfectly delicious, everyone asks for the recipe. I usually serve it with cornbread that has creamed corn, green chilis and cheddar cheese in it.  No dessert necessary! Thank you Betty, for years of this great soup.

This recipe is wonderful!  Rather than cook chicken as indicated, I boiled the chicken breasts and then shredded them as I prefer shredded meat to cubed in soups.  I used the broth from the chicken cooking water and added "no sodium" bullion cubes.  I cooked the garlic in the olive oil, then added the onion and the shredded chicken till warm, then stirred in the cumin.  For the salsa, I used half mild salsa and half medium salsa.  I did add black beans as well which gives the soup a little more substance.  This is a keeper in our house!

I have made this several times.  I cook the chicken in a crockpot overnight seasoned with pepper, garlic powder, and chili powder.  Then I shred the chicken.  I add 2 cans of green chili's drained and use lime instead of lemon.  Garnished with chopped cilantro, green onions, light sour cream and tortilla chips.  Very delicious!

Mike liked it. He'd never had Chicken Tortilla Soup before and thought it was different. He ate the whole bowl so that means I can make it again. Next time I need to cut it in half.

I boiled the chicken with garlic & salt. Shredded the chicken then proceeded to sauté the onions & garlic in a small pot first. I added chicken stock instead of broth. ( In my opinion, I think it's tastier than broth) then I added the cumin, (substituted the chili powder with ground red pepper cayenne powder) lemon juice & salsa. In another small pan, I roasted fresh corn kernels. Added that to my soup. It gives a smoky flavor which is great for this recipe. I also added drained black beans & a small can of diced green peppers.

Whole family really liked this soup and it was super easy. I followed the advice of other reviewers and used rotisserie chicken and added a can of black beans. I would add a little more corn, and a touch more cumin and chili powder next time.

I have a tried and true recipe that I use for tortilla soup but I didn't have all the ingredients to make it.  So I went in search of another for ideas of how to change things up.  SO GLAD I DID!!  My family loved it!  I did everything pretty much the same but I did use a little oregano.  I also didn't have chicken broth so I had to use water and boullion cubes (not my favorite option but it was fine) - and I used 4 cups instead of what the recipe called for.  As some other members suggested I added a can I black beans (drained and rinsed).  The family loved the flavor and the fact that it was more hearty than my other recipe.  Great recipe - thanks so much!

I followed the recipe as written, except doubled the garlic and cumin to make it easier to mix in. I didn't find it hard to understand the process at all. Simple. Easy. Delicious. If you think chips in soup might be weird (like I did), I recommend giving it a try. You might love it--like I did!

I only rate recipes I love and this is one of them. My hubby seeks out Tortilla Soup at restaurants and is never happy with the outcome. I happened to come across this recipe and now its a staple in our house. Its such a versatile recipe. I have made it by the directions exactly the first time and then the second I added more cumin, cayenne pepper and green chills. It made the recipe even better. I always boil my chicken, shred it and add it to the onions with garlic, celery and carrots. Then season them with the cumin chili powder and garlic powder. Then I add the broth green chills rice and corn, Thank you so much for an easy changeable recipe!

LOVED this soup.  I only changed one thing - cooked the chicken breast first and chopped/shredded it to start the recipe.  I love soups wit broth and this is a winner!  Getting ready to make a new pot full.

The basic recipe is great but... I also shredded the chicken, added black beans, a can of rotel diced tomatoes with chilis and a little chopped cilantro.  Delish!

Too many people already added their 2 cents, but I wanted to just say that we too found this soup to be simple to make and everyone loved it!  My little 6 year old - who  typically needs prodding to eat anything more than the first few bites of anything - had 3 bowls of this!!   I added  thinly sliced potato strips to add more body as this was our main course and used fresh corn off the cob, but I would think you can add pretty well anything to this and it would be fab!

I did really enjoyed this soup! It was very easy to make and only took about 45 minutes. I used rotisserie chicken and added cooked rice in the last 5 minutes. I'm not going to lie, the sour cream and cheese make the soup though!

I really love this recipe!! My husband and I both love things very spicy so I sliced up some jalapeño and Serrano peppers (with seeds) and threw them in. I also added a can of rotel diced tomatoes with chili peppers. Instead of cayanne I used chipolte chili powder. Amazing!! Instead of cooking and shredding chicken, I bought a rotisserie chicken from the food store which cut the time down. Doubled the recipe and froze what we didn't eat! Delicious.

This tortilla soup was awesome!  I made it in the crockpot very easily. I did add one green habanero to it to give it some kick.  I also added a can of black beans.  Topped it with colby/monteray jack, nachos and sour cream.  I will definitely make it again.

I did this one in a slow cooker, too. I threw it all together, put it on low for 6 hours, shredded the chicken and it was a fantastic soup!! It seemed a little thin for me... but I'm no soup lover, so all soups seem too thin, to me. So I added about a 1/2c of monterey jack and threw some chopped cilantro in, as well. Winner winner chicken dinner!! As a friend of mine said to me. LOL

The best chicken tortilla soup I have ever had. Placing the chips on the bottom before adding the soup, and that topping of sour cream, is what makes this soooo good. No soggy chips! Whole family loved it. =)

The first time I made this I followed the recipe exactly, however I found it to be a little bit bland.  It was an excellent starting point, so the second time I made it I just got a little more "creative".  I made it in my large slow cooker so decided to add a packet of low sodium taco seasoning and a large can of diced tomatoes.  I also decided to add a little more corn and just tasted and worked with it until it was seasoned to taste.  I also found that cooking the chicken ahead of time and shredding it before adding it to the soup was very helpful.  Adding it already shredded caused it to absorb so much more of the overall flavor, and after cooking several hours in the slow cooker it was very tender.   Like I said, it is a GREAT place to start, and from there you can really get creative and make it your own!

I have made this at least 6 times since discovering it a few months back, and I have taken the advice of some reviewers and alter it various ways.  I change things, add things (and always include carrots and black beans), but it has never failed to be a hit at our table.  So quick and easy, I make it for friends and take it for pot luck.  I always buy 2 roasted whole chickens at Sam's, remove the meat, then chop roughly. I usually put a little Ro-tel and/or diced or crushed tomatoes, and serve this with Tostitos "Hint of Lime" chips.  YUM!!

After a thorough review of recipes for this soup I combined several recipes and it is terrific. I bought a whole cooked chicken and shredded it.I sauteed my onion and pablano pepper added the shredded chicken and spices mixed well then I added chicken broth and 1 jar of Spikes black bean and corn salsa as well as a can of Golden Hominy(mexican corn) and a can of black beans. I let cook and then add cilantro before serving.
Very authentic and fresh and if you like spice you can add sliced jalapenos or habeneros to the bowls.

My new favorite recipe! I baked the chicken strips, then cut and added to the soup. And I did add a few things. 1 can red kidney beans, 1 small can of green chilies. Topped with green onions, cilantro. And I made a delicious topping mixing avocado and sour cream. So many flavor layers. Can't wait to make it again.

Very, very good!  Added a can of seasoned black beans (Bush beans), drained two hours into a 4 hrs high crock pot cook time.  Added 4 corn tortillas cut into small pieces at the end to simmer and thicken.  Then added some half and half until desired consistency.  Put the homemade Lisa chips on top with a whole avocado.  Salt and peppered individually to taste.  Very good!

I made this yesterday with only a few minor changes, in trying to keep with the true essence of the recipe. Instead of cooking the two chicken breast I shredded half a rotisserie chicken using both the dark & white side. I did sautee the onion and garlic in olive oil separately and added them to the soup mixture. I increased the broth to a 48 oz. container and used a 10oz. can of mild Rotel tomates with green chiles for the salsa and added a 15 oz. can of well rinsed black beans. Additionally I mixed a tablespoon of cornstarch with two tablespoons of water and added it to the soup, just to thicken it up a bit. Lastly, I omitted the lemon juice from the soup but cut up a lime and avacado and served them on the side, along with the tortilla chips to be used as desired individually. I think this was one of the most flavorful soups I've ever made. Thank you so much for the wonderful recipe!

My 13 year old son made this for the family on his own; it was awesome!!  We will definitely have this soup again really soon!!  He followed the recipe perfectly and did a really good job!  He did use flour tortillas in the place of corn tortilla chips being that was all we had; they made it really super and soaked up the spices nicely!

I was craving tortilla soup so much, and this really hit the spot! Very easy to make, I found most of the ingredients around the kitchen even before I went grocery shopping, thanks for this!

Fantastic!  Per other reviews, I used lime juice instead of lemon juice.  I add a can of black beans and serve with fresh cilantro.

I Made this recipe and it didn't turn out as soup, maybe I reduced it too much. I could definitely add more broth in this case though. Since it was very reduced I added it to rice and it was delicious!
Would definitely make this again.

Yummy! For the broth I used a rotisserie chicken from the deli, separated the meat from the bones and skin, added the skin and bones to the chicken broth(2quarts) added 2cups water and simmered for an hour. Strained the broth, added the meat,and all other ingredients (doubling the spices) plus a can of tomatoes and cooked for a half hour. Delish!!!

Delicious soup! I used the "most helpful" reviews and added more broth and more salsa. I also sauteed the onions and garlic before putting them in the broth. Overall delicious recipe! My two roommates slurped it all up! :)

I've made many different soups since we got married, and DH says this is by far the best one.  Made as written, using a hot salsa.  I sauteed the chicken breasts whole in the olive oil and added the rest of the ingredients.  Took the chicken out and shredded it after about 15 mins.  Garnished with cheese, chips sour cream and avocado.  Definitely my kind of recipe-  wonderful flavor and simple to prepare.  Thanks for sharing!

This is great soup. I've made this several times. Sometimes I use ground turkey instead of chicken. I always omit the lemon juice, add a can of black beans, and add a lot of cumin and more garlic. The last time I made it I added ripped up corn tortillas and it was fantastic. They completely dissolved but added great flavor and texture.

I've made this a couple of times for church dinners. Easy to adjust for more servings. Went with the lime as suggested. Used seasoned fajita chicken, sauteed with onion, garlic and peppers. Cooked a concentrated version in the crock pot all day and then mixed with hot chicken broth before the dinner. Served with corn chips, tortilla strips, shredded cheese, sour cream, and chopped avocado on the side. Always a hit.

My husband and I loved this recipe.  I made mine in a slow cooker.  I only had one can of chicken broth, so I substituted with one can of vegetable broth and a bouillon cube.  I also added 1 tbsp of cornstarch and 1 can of diced tomatoes.  It was DELICIOUS!

Very good starting point.  Made it once as written and again with modifications - I had no corn the second time, so I added orange/yellow bell peppers and some leftover rice - it was delicious!

I wouldn't add sour cream if using the mild salsa - but if you have someone who can't handle "hot" foods, mild salsa is the way to go - flavorful without being spicy.

Awesome soup! I also added WAY more chicken and black beans and I thickened it up with a little cornstarch about 30 minutes before serving. I served it with cornbread. My husband and kids ate this up fast!

The soup was good, but I had to doctor it a bit. It was a little soupy so I doubled the amount of chunky salsa I put in. The chips got mushy being put in prematurely, so maybe it's better to serve them WITH chips, not on them. I shredded the chicken between two forks when it was done cooking so the pieces were more manageable.

Good soup.  Like Bette I put everything in a crockpot and cooked for four hours.  Also I substituted southwestern style frozen veggies for the corn.  This mix has black beans, corn, peppers and onions.

Definitely worth making!  

The only reason I am why I did not give this recipe 5 stars is that I felt it needed a little something extra.  So to add that something extra, I used 1/2 packet taco seasoning and a tsp of fresh lime juice.

Love this soup!!!  I boiled the frozen chicken breast in the broth with all the spices and onion and garlic, removed the breast and shredded them and put it back in the broth.  This gave the chicken a very good flavor! I added rinsed black beans, one small can of mild chopped jalapeno and upped the cumin and chili powder. Simple and delicious!

This soup is wonderful!  I doubled the portion and used my 6-quart Crock Pot to make enough for company.  It was such a big hit that between only four of us, we ate so much that there is hardly enough left for leftovers!  The changes I made were: I boiled 4 chicken breasts just long enough to turn them white on the outside, shredded them and placed them in the Crock Pot.  I used 70 ozs (2 boxes & 1 can) of chicken broth.  I added 1 can of black beans, rinsed & drained.  I used only 1 1/2 TBSP lemon juice and added 1/2 lime juice.  I used 1/2 medium an 1/2 mild salsa so that it would be mild enoug for everyone to enjoy.  I added 1 tsp of fresh chopped cilantro.  I cooked on high for 3 hours and reduced to low for about 2 hours until company arrived.  I made the following available for people to add as they preferred: Mission tortilla strips, jalapenos, shredded Mexican cheese, sour cream and guacamole.  It was delicious!

I made this soup for dinner tonight.  My family LOVED it!!  In fact, my husband said it was as good as chicken tortilla soup from a restaurant!!
I used rotisserie chicken (breasts) and sauted the onion and garlic in olive oil prior to adding all the rest of the ingredients (my kids like the onions soft).  It had just the right amount of spice and great flavor.   I will definitley keep this in my rotation for fall/winter meals.  Thanks for the terrific, easy recipe!

Not only did this get an approval from the house food critics (My 3 & 10 y/o daughters). It was put on the definitely make again list. I consider this high praise for a very simple meal.

This was very good I used Rotel tomatoes instead of salsa because that is what I had. Also, like others I poached the chicken and shredded first. I also added a bit of cream because I had some I needed to use up and I like a creamy Tortilla soup.

I used a modified version of this recipe to feed my family and its always gone in 12 hours tops when I double, even triple the ingredients. I made a few changes, I use cajun seasoning instead of cumin for one and since my family likes a lot of flavor in their chicken, I tend to stick with the italian seasonings on that (sage, basil, and standard poultry seasoning). I also use red pepper for a little heat and a whole jar of medium heat salsa to 4 cans of chicken broth. Very versatile recipe, can also work with ground chicken if one desires to make more of a taco soup. I also buy corn tortillas and fry in olive or vegetable oil over medium/high heat to the desired crispness then season to taste with sea salt. Very yummy combination when added to the soup with a little bit of sour cream on top!

Great fast recipe.  I added a can of black beans, fresh corn and some small prawns.  I let it simmer for about an hour and added sliced guacamole on top.  Excellent!

I've made this several times, it's just sooooo good!!!!  I also add some chopped up carrot and sometimes I add some elbow macaroni, if the kiddies ask.  Also, when you serve with the tortilla chips, cheese and sour cream, don't forget the avocado slices and fresh cilantro :)

This recipe was good, but a little confusing.  I also boiled the chicken and shredded it prior to putting it into the recipe.  I think it could have used a little less chili powder, and I would definitely serve it with sour cream.

I love this soup and its so easy to change to suit personal tastes. I make it every fall/ winter. I usually cook my onions and garlic first, for extra flavor i add a packet of taco seasoning and chipolte powder. My kids even eat it good way to get lots of veggies in and protien with beans and chicken or turkey

AWESOME!  Boiled chicken in broth, salt, pepper, garlic powder and onion powder first, then shredded.  Threw chicken and rest of ingredients back into pot.  Also, I sautéed the onion & garlic before adding to pot.  Added a can of chili beans.

I added black beans, used a frozen chopped onion, green pepper and red pepper mix (instead of just onion), and garlic powder in lieu of fresh garlic.  The chicken broth I used was made from water and chicken boullion. Delicious!

This was very good and very easy for a weeknight meal.  I used a mild salsa because my family doesn't like spicy food so I just added some hot sauce to my bowl of soup.  This recipe is definitely a keeper.

Really good soup! I make this about once a week. This is my "no time to cook" meal because it is so easy! I follow the directions exactly except that I usually don't defrost my chicken first and just saute the frozen breasts in the oil which starts the defrost process. I then add in the onion and garlic and let it cook with the chicken for a few mins...then I add the broth and the rest of the ingredients including at least one can of kidney beans. I usually use a medium chunky salsa. I have added both rice and chips to this soup before and they are both really good. This is not only nutritious but yummy and it satisfies my whole family! Thanks for the great recipe!!

We did not care for this and I probably wouldn't make it again.  I did substitute Rotel for the salsa, which could be part of the problem, but even so it just seemed kind of blah.  Bummer!

Really delicious! I was forced to make a few changes. I did not have cumin in my cabinet - so to spare yet another trip to the grocery store, I combined a 1/2 teaspoon with chilli powder, corrainder seed, and curry powder all together.   I also added extra chilli powder, pepper, and about 1/8 cup extra of salsa. The chicken I used was remaining chicken from a rotisserie chicken.  I also added black beans, to make it more Tex-Mex. The kids loved it! My husband loved it!

Used shredded chicken that I simply cooked in chicken broth in the pot, added ingredients as listed, then removed and shredded the breasts when cooked through.  Good recipe.

Wonderful- hubby says it's his fave!  A recipe that you can change things up to make it your own.  I used green enchilada sauce AND salsa (for the salsa piece), I also added corn.  Definitely add the tortilla pieces, cheese and sour cream at the end to individual bowls- makes a difference!

Very yummy! We are not usually big soup people but this one is a keeper.  Next time I will add more broth...I was scared to stray from the recipe the first time making it or I would have taken others recommendations on this.  I also added some Rotel diced chilies and tomatoes.  And next time I will also add some El Pato Tomato Sauce (which is a spicy Mexican tomato sauce). We all ate ours differently some of us used Frito corn chips, some used white corn chips, and everyone agreed my technique was the best.  Before I put the soup in my bowl I added about a half a handful of shredded cheese.  I then poured the soup over it...then added more cheese to the top.  I used flour tortillas to dip in the soup.  It was YUMMY...the cheese at the bottom makes a nice gooey chewy bottom that sticks some of the shredded chicken together.

WONDERFUL!  I boiled my chicken with salt, didn't have a garlic clove as I'd wanted to do per another reviewer.  I was out of corn, but I did add 1/2 can of rinsed black beans as another suggested.  This was our first time to even eat this kind of soup & we both lOVED it!  Hubby said he wasn't even going to eat it last week when I talked about making it!  He came down asking what that wonderful smell was!  I just used some Hy Vee medium salsa that I had on hand.  Also, made the tortilla crisps with corn tortillas cut into stips in the oven. This ones a keeper!  Thanks for posting!

Love this recipe!!  I make it about twice a month, so easy and delicious!  We get the rotisserie chicken from costco, have that one night then use what's left to make this soup.  I also add two tomatos cut in wedges.  Delicious!

I used the slow cooker and it came out perfect. I omitted the corn because my husband doesn't like it. I used 2 cans of shredded canned chicken.  Baked corn tortillas until crisp and crumbled them into each bowl before serving. Added Mozzarella cheese to top it off.

YUM! This tastes every bit as good as the chain restaurants.  I will definitely make this again.  I did substituted Rotel in place of the salsa as was suggested by a previous rating.  I also used Tysons grilled chicken strips (deli section) to save on cooking time. AWESOME !!!!

Really good and easy!  I used leftover turkey from the holidays and I also cooked the onions first. I ended up doubling the cumin and chili powder to get it to the flavor that I expected but once I did that it was awesome!

I made this to the tee. Cook for 30 minutes. Tasted it and said, HMM, something isn't right. So doubled the chili powder/cumim and added 1 tsp of Salt PLUS 1/2 can of Cream of Chicken Soup. That did the trick. Delicious! RAVE reviews from Family and friends. They all said tasted like the Mexican food restaurants. Will make it this way from now on....

AWESOME!!!  This is a great recipe that any experienced cook can tweak it to customize it to his/her preference.  I am no fan of can soup for the reason it is salty and low on flavor.  Therefore whenever I look at making soup, I cut down all the hidden salt and add what is needed but along with spices and flavor.  I used 1 1/2 bone/skinless chicken breast and 1lb of bone/skinless thighs.  I cut the chicken in pieces, seasoned  with chili powder, cumin, garlic powder and onion powder rub.  After, I browned the meat in pan with olive oil and minced onions.  I added the chicken to crock pot, put in low sodium broth, minced garlic,  chili powder and cumin plus red pepper flakes and cooked for 10 hours.  I made homemade salsa with grape tomatoes, cilantro, red onion and put in fridge.  8 hours into cooking I added the salsa and two cut ears of fresh corn off the cob and some more broth. Serve with lightly salted tortilla strips and cheese if you like.  Next time I will add beans for a different taste.

This was a bit bland for our taste; I ended up adding more cumin and about a full tablespoon of chili powder.  I was low on salsa so I added a can of Rotel tomatoes.  I fried some flour tortilla strips, salted them and crumbled on top of the soup which gave a nice crunch.

This is my go-to recipes for this type of soup, my family begs for me to make it. I saute the onions with the  evoo, garlic, cumin, and cayenne. I poach the chicken and shred it, and saute it with the onions for a few minutes before adding the broth. It's fantastic, and never leaves any leftovers!

Delicious soup!  I followed the recipe as written, and really enjoyed it!  Next time I think I'll add some black beans.  Actually, I did make one change.  I boiled and shredded the chicken to make life a little easier.  This will become a regular in the rotation!

Really, really fantastic! My boyfriend wouldn't shut up about it. I had leftover chicken that had been marinated for another dish - didn't affect the flavor. I used only one can of chicken broth and 2 cups of a chicken flavored consomme powder. It has such a flavorful kick - it made me sweat while not being too spicy. So delicious!

This was delicious!  I used fresh lime juice instead of lemon juice and I also added in an extra can of chicken broth.  I had cumin, garlic and chili powder marinated pork tenderloin that we grilled the night before so I added that in instead of the chicken.  I served this with the spicy black bean empanadas from this site.  Will definatly make this again!!

I love chicken tortilla soup, but this one left me feeling a little blah.  I think the big problem is that the ratio of chicken broth to salsa is too high.  I really was wanting more flavour.  I think next time I will half the chicken broth and or double the salsa and play with it.  Maybe even add in some diced tomatoes. Make sure to use fresh chili powder. Also would use lime instead of lemon juice for a more authentic soup. I agree with previous reviewers - throw it all in a stock pot and leave it overnight and then shred the chicken.  That process worked great.

Made in slow cooker adding cooked chopped chicken breast and drained canned black beans.  If you like a little extra in the soup, can add extra corn and rice on the side for those who want it in their bowl.  Excellent for Sunday lunch after church.

I made 25 servings todays.  Having some friends over for football.  I added blackbeans, rice (not much) and a little flour to thicken the stock.  I think it tastes great.  I also took someone else's info and used the pace medium salsa.  With the cummin and medium pace salsa it def has a little kick.

I can't live without this!  I make this often and generally add black beans.  I also blacken the chicken and add red pepper which gives it a little more spice!

My cupboard didn't have all the ingredients, but I was craving this soup, so the soup pot ended up with turkey sausage (for chicken), diced tomatoes (for salsa), and also doubled the cumin, lime juice, and corn. My picky husband thought this was a "5"...

This is a great recipe, and after making it a few times, I have found it tastes awesome in the slow cooker (just add all ingredients minus the cheese and tortilla chips). I was able to toss in the chicken breasts frozen and then shred them up a few hours later once they were nice and tender. I also used the juice of one lemon and half of a lime (it really kicks up the citrus flavor). I added a cube of tomato boullion (I used Knorr) as well as a seasoning packet that contains tomato and cilantro. It turned out soo delicious with the extra seasoning. Next time I am going to omit the corn and use a can of hominy instead. Also, I have eaten it both with and without the cheese and tortilla chips. I actually  like it better without, but it's great to leave them on the table if people want to add their own.

This is a good starting point, but I used some of the advice of the other posters. This is what I did and it turned out AMAZING. I boiled the chicked in water with garlic and salt as advised NMR. I used a full 34 oz of chicken broth, but don't do this unless you are going to cook it down for a few hours. I used much more chili pepper and cumin than the recipe asked for because it was tasting too much like chicken broth. After a shredded the chicken I sauted the onion with garlic and the chicken then added the chicken broth and corn. I let this cook for 2-3 hours on a low simmer. About 30 min before serving I added 3/4 can of black beans. This gave the soup more substance and a great flavor. I served it in a bowl with a small amount of white rice at the bottom. I put 2-3 slices of avocado on one side and tortilla chips on the other than topped it with jack cheese. My friend came over for dinner and a movie she was raving about it all week!!

I wasn't crazy about this recipe until I added the cheese, tortilla chips and sour cream. After all of that is added, this is a very good soup! I also added a can of green chilies and some cayenne pepper. Very good!

This is my absolute favorite mexican soup recipe! (And I know my mexican food...) I only added one thing (1/2 to 1 whole packet of taco seasoning) that helped make the soup a little bolder, and the consistency a bit thicker. I found the soup a bit runny watery and not spicy enough for me. Adding the packet of taco of seasoning really made the soup! (If you make your own taco seasoning, throw it in instead!) Top with a dollop of sour cream and sliced avocado and you've got yourself the best soup. Serve with cornbread or quesadillas for a full meal.

My husband liked this dish a lot.  It was very easy to make and tasted great. I let it simmer in the crockpot for a couple hours.   The one change I had to make after tasting it though was to double the spices.  As it is written now, it is spiced so that toddlers will eat it.

This was very delicious.  A few changes that I did was 1)shredded a rotisserie chicken then sauted it 2) added a can of drained and rinsed black beans 3) added the juice of 1 lime and 4) simmered it for about 45 minutes.  Since there was more chicken meat I also added more chicken broth and increased the other seasonings just a bit more (basically doubled the chili powder, cumin, garlic).  This is a definite keeper!

Oh boy... this Tortilla soup quickly got put into our winter meal rotation. We love hot soup on a cold winter day and when we made this for the first time Chef Junior my teenage son and my husband and I all declared this a five hands down. Chef Junior likes to splash fresh lime into his bowl generously! We have made this about five times this winter. I just made this again today as a matter of fact! Love the grated cheese, although I typically use a Sharp Cheddar, Monteray Jack is nice as well. We love mexican food and this is one of the healthier choices. During the chilly New England winter this soup warms the soul! We WILL be making this again and again and again! Oh and it is a snap to make!

This recipe is to die for!   Just a few things that made it great for me!  1. Use fresh salsa...not like a bottled kind on a shelf...get one in a refridgerated section  2. Use cumin and chili powder to taste...you might want some more.  3. I added a dash of Cayenne pepper  4. I used tortilla chips (LOTS!) and CHEDDAR cheese on top, which I think is the best cheese for this soup!  5. Shred the chicken, like everyone else says.  AND ENJOY!

This is an absolutely fantastic soup.  We used fresh salsa from a local Mexican market and sweated the onions with some extra garlic.  It was fantastic.  The second time, we doubled it, but it did not need all the broth, and it was still great.  Now we have leftovers for lunch!

So easy, so quick, so good!  I made this for dinner Friday night and it was awesome, partly because it is a soup with lots of good stuff in it.  In addition to what the recipe says, I added a can of black beans (rinsed and drained), a little more broth than called for, and some chopped up red bell pepper.  I didn't use the cheese (obviously).  After it had been simmering for about 20 minutes, I took the chicken out and cut it into little pieces and put it back in for another few minutes.  I used medium salsa.  YUM

My family really enjoyed this-it can be altered easily to suit your taste.  I sauteed the garlic and onions before adding the chicken. I did add a bit more garlic than it called for-we love garlic). I used several different types of broth-chicken, chicken & garlic, and beef. One of my kiddos has a very sensitive palate so I cut back on the chili powder but added a 1/2 package of mild taco seasoning. I used a salsa that was very mild and not chunky (kids preference).  I also added 2 cans of black beans. Served it with tortilla chips on the bottom, colby jack shredded cheese and a dollop of sour cream.  Hubby and I used tobasco to spice ours up a bit.  If I were making it for just my husband and I, I would sautee a can of green chilies with the garlic and onion and use a different hotter salsa. I would also consider upping the cumin/chili powder and add a canned of diced tomatos.  I will certainly make it again-the kids have already claimed the left-overs for their lunchboxes tomorrow. :)

I'm torn between a four and a five on this one.  I ended up sauteing the onion and garlic before adding the other ingredients and I also poached the chicken before adding to the soup.  When I added the salsa, it wasn't at all tomato-y.  I thought that the salsa was "chunky", but maybe not?  Anyway, it ended up looking like funky broth with some salsa style veggies.  I tried boiling down the broth, but that didn't work.  It still didn't look/taste right.  The next day, I added some pureed tomatoes a tablespoon at a time and tested it until it came out the way I liked. I'm not sure if this is correct, but it ended up tasting very well!  The tortilla chips are definitely a must, but the cheese is optional, I liked it with and without it.

The absolute, hands-down best tortilla soup that I have ever made/tasted!  I'm a trader Joe's kind of girl, so I used mostly their ingredients.  I'm sure there are a lot of variations of how this soup turns out depending on what ingredients you use, but here's what I used to make the BEST SOUP EVER:  Trader Joe's Chunky Salsa, Trader Joe's Frozen Roasted Corn, Trader Joes Organic Free Range Chicken Breasts   I also added half a can of Trader Joe's Cuban Style Black Beans as well as some cilantro both as a garnish and in the actual soup.  I first boiled the chicken breasts for 20 minutes w/ 1 clove minced garlic & 2 bouillon cubes, then shredded into small pieces.  Then, I sauteed the chicken with the onion and spices, slowing adding in the chicken broth and other ingredients.  I garnished with cilantro, cheddar cheese, sour cream, and the "Baked Tortilla Chips" recipe from allrecipes.com by Michele O'Sullivan.  Happy Cooking!

I thought this was very good, not exception though.  If I make it again, I will put more seasonings in - I thought it was a little bland.  The tortilla chips really added flavor, so don't skip those!

Wonderful.  By the list of ingredients I didn't think it would turn out nearly as good as this!  We had a soup "party" and had four different soups and this one was gone way before all the others!  Definitely a keeper.

This beat the Chicken Tortilla soup I tried to make in the slow cooker.  Adding a can of black beans was a great idea.  The amount of stock called for made the soup look to watery but the taste was great.

This soup was really tasty.  I'm only giving it 4 stars because as it's written, it's pretty vague.  I would suggest to saute the onions before adding the broth or to let the soup simmer for about an hour.  If you follow the recipe exactly, the onions are not cooked through after simmering for only 20-30 min.  I also used roasted chicken breasts, shredded, which worked out great.  Delicious, though!  We'll definitely make it again!

So yum! Perfect for people who don't have tons of time to cook but still enjoy something homemade! I used the mild salsa from trader joe's and extra chili powder, turned out great. Next time I may use a bit more broth.

Left out the garlic and onion as I'm pregnant and can't stand the smell.  Otherwise, stuck to the recipe and it was AWESOME!  Hubby and I both agreed it was still delicious even without the beloved garlic and onion.

Very good. I wish it was a little thicker. I think next time I might use tomato paste or sauce in it to thicken it up. Really good flavor though.

I make this soup regularly.  I always add fresh cilantro and some sort of beans, black, pinto, chilis w/o sauce, etc.  It's a hit every time I serve it.  It's the perfect soup to whip up quick with on-hand ingredients!  I just dump it all in a pot and let it simmer.  Definitely top with cheese and chips.  I sometimes use cheddar.

EXCELLENT!!!  Made just as recipe stated, but after tasting added a little bit more chili powder and cummin.  I made it on Saturday but never had a chance to try it today.  Topped it with sour cream and Moteray Jack cheese and it is delicious!  Thank you!

I have made this recipe twice already and both times there were no leftovers! I gave this recipe only four stars because the directions were a little vague. I did like some of the others and boiled and shredded the chicken first, then followed the directions from there. It's a definite hit at my house!

This recipe was great!!  I added more cumin, chili powder, chicken and diced tomatoes.  As for the chicken, I sauteed the chicken breasts in olive oil and garlic until there was no pink visible, after simmering for most of the day i shredded the chicken and added it back to the soup.  My family loved this soup with monterey jack cheese, tortilla chips and cilantro as toppings.

Although the actual recipe doesn't tell you much about cooking the chicken, I read the various reviews and adjusted my recipe as follows: I sauteed the chicken breast... once the rest of the main ingredients were added and had simmered for about 10 minutes, I took the chicken out of the soup, let it cool slightly, tore the chicken breast into small pieces and then threw the chicken back into the soup and let it simmer for the additional alloted time.  

*Or the 2nd time I cooked it, I had rotiserie chicken that I threw in with the rest of the ingredients.   

*Either way... this recipe is a keeper.  (I did throw in a can of rinsed black beans).

I read other reviews before making this. I shredded the chicken and added more garlic, chicken broth, and cumin than was stated. We added some salt (our preference) and about a teaspoon of Tobasco, and rinsed, black beans.

This was good. I went to make it and I forgot salsa, so I used diced tomatoes.  It was good, so I know it will be be better with salsa too. My 6 year old didn't like the spices in this.  My 10 year old loved it though!

Very good, very easy. You really do need to add the black beans. I precooked my chicken and then shredded it into the soup. I think next time I will add a little more chicken stock, I think the beans might have thickened it up a bit, which was ok, just needed a touch more liquid. Served with some cilantro, diced up avocado and tomatoes - yum....

I follwed this recipe to the T and it was good, but after tasting it I decided that for our family it needed a little more heat.  I added the rest of the jar of salsa and additional cumin and chili powder.  I also decided to throw in a can of pinto beans at the last minute.  My husband and I really enjoyed it and will definitely be making it again.

Mmmm! So good!!
I put in cheddar cheese and extra chicken broth - the recipe's recommendations aren't sufficient.  Also, I boiled my chicken for the first time and tore it up for this recipe - perfect for this soup! Spices were kept the same, oil was skipped, and I added a red pepper because it was handy.  Diced olives came in my salsa and were also a good addition.
It was all that I expected and more!

Great recipe with lots of room for experimentation. The suggestions for poaching the chicken rather than sauteing is a great one that makes a big difference. 

Use care in selecting cheese to include in this soup. I used a store brand shredded colby jack blend that turned out poorly in the context of the soup (extremely buttery aftertaste)

I made this for dinner tonight. I didn't have garlic or lemon juice... it tasted great though. The directions aren't specific about what to do with the chicken breasts. I cut them up and sauteed them. Next time I will boil the chicken and then shred it (or bake a whole chicken then shred it). I had mine with cheese, my husband had cheese and sour cream on his. We both had two bowls. The kids thought that it was too spicy. I bought Tostitos to go with it but accidentally grabbed the "hint of lime" kind. Next time I'll be sure to get regular (I don't like lime). Overall this is a very good recipe. I've been craving it ever since I had Chicken Tortilla Soup at McAlister's Deli! Satisfied!!!

Like most people, I added black beans and cilantro, and subbed lime juice for the lemon. I used a great chili mix powder in place of the dry seasonings, and I doubled the recipe.  I used a whole bag of Schwan's pre-cooked diced chicken. Big bowls of this soup made a hearty meal for guests with the added slices of guacamole, a dollop of sour cream, pepper-jack cheese, and flour tortilla chips.  So easy, and the ingredients are always on hand.

I have never made chicken tortilla soup in fear it would never measure up to my husbands standards. It DID! He loves it. I served it at a fajita party and everyone complimented the soup above everything else. I did exactly what the recipe called for with one small addition of 1/2 cup sour cream and extra salt. I will definately make this again and again. Thank you sooo much Betty for sharing this with us :-)

Very good, I added some crushed red pepper to give it more of a kick and used canned corn. I also placed everything (raw chicken) in a slow cooker on high for about 3 1/2 - 4 hours; shredded chicken and replaced for 30 minutes.

I have searched for the perfect Chicken Tortilla Soup recipie for a long time and have finally found it! My Husband thought it was store bought. Have made it several times. I did make a couple of adjustments. I use canned chicken to make it easier and faster to make. I also use a more broth than the recipie orignally calls for, I use the chopped onions in a spice jar rather than real onions (since there is enough in the salsa you really dont need a full cup of onions) and use canned corn instead of frozen. Just a couple minor things that have made it easier for me.  This is my favorite recipie on this website to date. You won't be disappointed.

Easy and very good! Be picky about your salsa, as it really picks up the flavor. I cooked up my chicken with a little lime juice, then chopped and threw in while it simmered. Great weeknight alternative!

You have to try this recipe everyone!  And don't change a thing about it!  This was the best soup I have ever tasted!  I made this yesterday for my man and he said it's definitely a keeper.  The sour cream on top makes it even better.  Thanks so much for the recipe!

This was delicious!  It came out better then I expected.  As suggested by other reviewers, I added black beans, a bell pepper, spicy corn and black bean salsa and used a chicken roaster from the supermarket.  Fast and easy.  It actually came out more like a stew because the liquid was soaked up by all the ingredients.  YUMMO

Amazing. I added drained black beans and a can of diced tomatoes. I used a fully cooked rotisserie chicken from the grocery store, taking off the skin and hand shredding the meat for the soup. Perfection.

Awesome!  My family loved it.  I doubled the recipe and used cheddar cheese in place of Mont. Jack and Tobasco Sauce in place of chili pepper.  The sour cream adds a nice touch.  I also used Hot Salsa, which added even more of a bite.

Delicious.  I make this all the time--everyone ALWAYS asks for the recipe.  It's so quick and easy.  The only addition I make is adding a can of drained black beans.  I made it last week without the beans, it was still good, but MUCH better with them.

I made a few changes and this recipe was a keeper.  I baked the chicken ahead of time and shredded it by hand.  Then I sauteed the onions and garlic before adding the rest of the ingredients.  I strongly suggest sauteing the onions so they don't taste raw in the soup.

This was great!  I made a few changes: 1. Used 2lbs of chicken 2. Used apx. 4 garlic cloves. 3. I used an entire small package of frozen corn 4. I added extra salsa to get the right consistency 5. I added about two cups of cheddar cheese.  I will make this again for sure!  I used it as a quick Halloween meal while we were answering the door. Friends that were going to take off ended up staying after smelling dinner (and they ate all the leftovers!) and all the people coming to the door kept commenting on how great it smelled. I think that purchasing all of the items from a local co-op probably added to the freshness. Some guests needed to add a little hot sauce, I found it plenty spicy as it.  GREAT RECIPE!

This recipe is fantastic.  I do think that you should cook the onions while you cook the chicken so that the onions don't over power the soup.  I also double the amount of corn.

This was a real easy soup. Good taste. I did forget to add the cheese on the top when serving. I wish the broth was a bit thicker. I think next time I will add in some black beans.

This soup is great! Though it does need more broth. Swapping out the classic tomato salsa for salsa verde is a good substitution. I also added black beans.

Pretty good for such a simple recipe. Very quick to make too. I cooked this about thirty min longer for flavor. We like Zeke's tortilla soup better, but this is a much faster easier recipe and still good. Thanks, this is so easy.

Delicious! I did alter a few things per suggestions.  I used less salsa, added rinsed black beans, substituted lime juice instead of lemon and have baked and boiled chicken (I've made this twice!).  I prefered using the baked because it wasn't as chewy.  I also hand-shredded the chicken.  I omitted the tortilla chips but added montery cheese on top!

This is a great soup! I cooked the chicken in the broth with onions and a reduced sodium taco seasoning packet in my slow cooker overnight. I added the rest of the ingredients (corn & red kidney beans)the next day and simmered the soup for about 30 minutes. I garnished it with shredded cheddar, a dollop of sourcream and fresh chopped tomatoes. Very very good!

Two words:  Awe-Some!!  We took a shortcut with rotisserie chicken and added some extra cayenne.  We ate it with "Grandmother's Buttermilk Cornbread" (also 5 stars!) from this site.  Thanks Betty!! **Update - some black beans are also yummy!

This was great! I followed some other suggestions to shred the chicken and added a little celery and green peppers to the onion while sautéing (they were getting a little old and would have been thrown out otherwise). A can of pinto beans with jalapeños was tossed in and the soup was wonderful. Thanks so much for sharing the recipe.

I added some fresh cilantro and used a natural "medium" salsa.  YUM!  I didn't even have sour cream or cheese, and it was still excellent!  A great recipe for any time of year.

Delicious! This was the first time I have ever had Tortilla soup and was very surprised by the flavors! I made it exact except I added some black beans. We did have cilantro, cheese and sour cream (very little)as a topper. It was very filling. I served with corn bread.

I'm impressed! I'd never made tortilla soup before, and my husband was very skeptical, but this was one terrific soup! The only thing I did different was to add about 2/3 c. of frozen white corn. I made regular ol rice to serve on the side, but when I added it to my bowl of soup, it was a knock out! We crunched up the chips into the bottom of our bowls (the kids loved that part, too), ladled in the soup (and rice) and the entire batch was gone in less than 10 minutes. This will definitely become one of our often-made meals. Thanks!

This recipe was absolutely delicious. When I sauteed the garlic, I also sauteed the onion and added some bellpepper. I used a rotisserie chicken and fajita seasoning and black beans. On top of the sour cream, I also topped it with chopped cilantro,jalapeno, and lime zest. Its like a chicken chili.

This was AMAZING!! It was so fast and easy to make using things that you normally have in the house. It was an instant family fav.....even my 3yr and 1 yr old loved it! We added 2 cans stewed tomatoes and a can of white beans as well and actually fried stips of tortilla to use instead of chips.....mmmmmm amazing. Then top with celantro, alvacado, and sour cream!!!

I have updated this review.  This soup is delicious! I can't get enough of it! I love the corn and will add more in next time. To cut down on the sodium I use low sodium chicken broth.   
  Because I used skinless, boneless chick breasts, I cut it up in thin strips and sauted it along with the onion, garlic, and cumin to give the chicken more flavor.  I will be making this one many times to come. Thanks for the recipe!

I make this soup on a regular basis and freeze individual portions for a quick, healthy dinner.  I add a can of drained black beans and a extra chicken broth.  If you want a mild flavor, use a mild salsa and if you want it with a kick use one with more heat.  I've shared this recipe with several friends and they all love it!  We call it "Stewp" because it's not quite a stew but thicker than a soup.

A new family favorite. I made a few minor adjustments to the recipe, I added a 1/2 cup more corn, and added the cheese into the soup while cooking in the crock pot so that it melted in. I would suggest adding less chopped onion if the salsa you use already has some, it can get a little overpowering.

This was really good! I used a 48 oz box of Swanson chicken broth and cooked the chicken breast in it until done. Then I sauteed the breast with the onion and garlic. I then added the cumin and chili powder to the chicken and cooked for another minute. I then poured the chicken back into the broth and added a can of black beans, the salsa and lots of corn. I also substituted lime juice for the lemon juice. I cut real corn tortillas into 1/4 to 1/2 inch strips and fried them in oil. I used those to garnish the top once the soup was in a bowl. I also topped with fresh cilantro and colby jack shredded cheese. 
Hubby wanted cheese tortilla soup so next time I am going to thicken it with lots of Velveeta.

Easy and delicious.  I added black beans and red bell peppers.  I didn't have onion.  I also added brown rice.

My boyfriend and I really liked this soup.  This is what I did:  I doubled the recipe to ensure leftovers (a big time saver for me through the week).  Instead of buying raw chicken, I just bought a whole rotisserie chicken in the deli and stripped all of the meat off (I recommend this step for everyone; if you can buy a whole chicken for $5, that is precooked and full of flavor, why would you spend more just to have to do more work?).  I sauteed the onions in olive oil with the garlic and cumin to soften them up, and then added my cooked chicken pieces.  I added all of the other ingredients after that and cooked for about an hour.  Garnished with the recommended tortilla chips, cheese and a little sour cream.  I just realized today that I completely forgot the lemon juice, but it's good without!  I also tend to like a thicker soup, so I mixed a few teaspoons of cornstarch with cold water and added it about a half hour into the cooking process.  It seemed to work well.  I just had leftovers for lunch.  I will make this again.  Good stuff!

This was a big hit at aMexican food party that I took it to. I only added black beans. It was great. Even my husband, who is not a great lover of soups, had 2 bowls.

This was a pretty good soup and I really loved how easy and quick it was. The soup itself tasted great but I felt the chicken was just bland; maybe it needed some kind of marinade? The recipe didn't specify, so I cut the chicken into little cubes. I agree with some who said that I'd like a little thicker consistency; that's what I'm used to from restaurants. Maybe a little bit of cornstarch next time? This was an overall good dish and I'd make it again.

Amazing!  I used 2 cans of Swanson's shredded chicken instead of chicken breasts and it worked perfectly.  You'll think it's going to be too thin, but it thickens up quite a bit as you simmer it.  I would definitely double the recipe...I didn't and it only made 3 bowls worth.  Might try adding some diced tomatoes and cilantro next time.

I made this soup almost exactly as written and it was GREAT. It really tasted better than any restaurant variety I've tried.  I browned the chicken the poached it in the soup before shredding it at the end - perfect. I did add some extra canned tomatoes with chilies just to make it a little chunkier. I cooked rice to add in to the soup, and topped it with some sour cream, crumbled chips, Monterey Pepper Jack cheese, and some chopped cilantro. really makes a delicious, easy and filling meal! next time I would love to top it with some avocado and add some black beans - YUM!

Five stars with a few additions.  I sauteed the onions and garlic with the chicken.  I added a can of black beans or any bean I have in the house.  I did not put in the chili powder because my salsa is pretty spicy.  To make it creamier I added a can of tomato soup!  IT IS AWESOME!!  The family loves this.

Flavor was great. I put mine into the crock pot for 4 hours on low.  I ran out of chicken stock so I substituted a bottle of dark beer.  I also added half a pack of taco seasoning for a little more flavor.  I put some rotini noodles in, but should have waited towards the end because my noodles were so mushy.

This is an excellent Tortilla Soup recipe.  I followed this recipe as written w/ a few minor changes.  1) I sauted the onions and garlic in light olive oil first, then lightly browned the chicken breasts.  I threw everything into a crockpot and cooked on low for about 4-6 hours.   2) About an hour before serving, I shredded the chicken breasts and added a can of black beans.  3) I substituted canned corn instead of frozen  

This recipe has great flavor and it isn't too spicy so you can adjust per your family's tastes (my 2 year old son loved this).  I served the soup w/ cilantro, avocado, cheese and tortilla chips for toppings and a green salad on the side.  Excellent!  Had rave reviews from my family and our guests.

OMG...This soup was AWESOME.  I used leftover grilled chicken breast from a previous meal.  Also did not have enough chicken stock on hand, so I used half chicken and half beef stock.  I think the combination of stocks help to make the broth have an even richer taste.  My entire family (even my finicky husband) love the soup.  I can't wait to make another pot.   Thanks for the simple and delicious recipe.

This was wonderful!  I was expecting a little creamier soup but the flavors were outstanding.  I also threw in leftover rotissiere chicken I had in the fridge.  It wasn't too spicy (if you have little ones you're concerned about) but my husband and I spiced our own bowls up.  We ate it for 4 days straight.  Will definitely make in future!

I liked this soup - easy to make and you can add chips, sour cream and cheese to your liking.  I found it to be a little salty for my taste, so next time I will use a low sodium chicken broth.

This soup is so good.  I added a bit of chopped cilantro, some chopped avocado, and pretty much doubled the spices, and this soup tastes exactly like the tortilla soup from my favorite Mexican restaurant.  My husband couldn't rave about it enough.

I made this soup exactly as the recipe says and it is BY FAR the BEST Chicken Tortilla Soup I have EVER had ANYWHERE!!!!!!  I will say that it's really only good for about 3 people, as I had 4 people at the table last night and only had about a half bowl of soup each.  Torture!!  :)  I will be making this over and over and over again!!!!!

Excellent with some minor adjustments.  I cut the chicken into cubes and sauteed with onion, garlic, 4oz can of green chiles, and 1tsp cumin.  Also used 1qt of chicken broth and as others suggested a can of black beans (rinsed) and a can of diced tomatoes.  Topped with monterey jack, green onions, sliced avocado, and a dallop of sour cream.

We love this soup.  It looks so simple to make and even kind of boring in the pot, but it is delicious.  I have to double it to feed my family of 5 and I do add a can or two of kidney or pinto beans to stretch it.  It's very tasty.

This soup was awesome!  I followed the recipe, but added a can of black beans, an extra can of broth and used leftover hard corn taco shells instead of chips.  I also used leftover chicken, and sauteed the onions with the garlic.  Definitely top with chopped avocados!

Very good!  Mu husband, who usually doesn't like soups, even went back for seconds on this one.  The only thing I'll change is to sauté the onions with the chicken in the first step, as I found them a little too crunchy.  Still, a good recipe.

i LOVE this recipe because of the lemon!  My family craves it as well.  I add black beans, a little bit more of all the spices, and I shred the chicken.  I also pair it with Amy's cilantro cream sauce (also found on this website) instead of plain sour cream.  Delicious!

Delicious!  When my hubby got home and learned we were having this soup for dinner he instantly turned up his nose.  He is not a big soup lover.  I turned him around with this one.  He even ate a second bowl!  The only thing I did differently was add a can of beans.  I will add this to my collection!

Superb! Could not have been easier to prepare. I did have to add black beans (because I love black beans) and a dallop of sour cream to garnish, okay I also added a can of diced tomatoes. The only suggestion I have is to double the recipe. Makes great left overs to take to work.

this soup is awesome and so easy to make too.  I took it 1 step easier and used a store bought rotisserie chicken and shredded the meat off it instead of cooking my own chicken.  I also added a can of black beans.  I like the flavor of the soup, it was just the right amount of heat, not overly spicy and definitely enjoyed the toppings of cheese and sour cream, altho they are not necessarily needed, the soup is great by itself.

Oh my, this is really good!! I borrowed a couple of suggestions from other users. I placed everything except the corn into a slow cooker for 6 hours on low. I then shredded the chicken, added the corn, and added half a cup of black beans (canned, rinsed and drained). I cooked it for about 30 more minutes in the slow cooker. I served this with shredded cheddar cheese and sliced avocado as toppings. Next time I will add cilantro. It was perfect for my taste and I will make this again and again. Edit 1/20/12: I made this on the stove top with leftover cooked chicken and it all came together in about 30 minutes - pretty impressive! We loved it, but with the chips it was pretty salty. I think I would change the lemon to lime next time, and use low sodium chicken broth OR home made baked tortilla chips with less salt.

I used one of the fresh roasted chickens from the market. This recipe is simple & amazing. My man doesn't like tomatoes, so I used fine chopped jarred salsa. Those were the only changes I made.  Awesome. He LOVED it too. Also great as leftovers.

The soup was very tasty, I have made it twice now and the second batch I doubled. I made a few changes, I browned the chicken in a seperate pan and shreaded and put back into the soup. I also used lime juice instead of lemon and added fresh cilantro. I went to a local Mexican restaurant to buy the salsa and it really have it a great flavor. I'll be making this again!!

This recipe is wonderful! Easy, fun and sooo delicious! I agree that it can be very thick so I put a bit more chicken stock in it. Also, I've found too that boiling chicken and shredding it makes for better soup. I also have taken to putting light sour cream in to the soup to thicken the broth. You can also throw most any veggie in here, I like using fresh jalepeno/habenero from the garden (California is wonderful for that!) or bell peppers too. Instead of chips, I take tortillas, cut them up, sprinkle garlic and onion salt on them and bake them. This helps make the recipe a bit lower in sat. fat.

We've made this soup 3 times in two weeks! My kids are hooked on it! 
I saute the diced chicken and onions first in the dutch oven, add the spices, then the broth, salsa(we use medium chunky Tostitos brand), corn & remaining ingredients and simmer for about an hour. Top with tortilla chips, plenty of shredded cheese(cheddar & MJ), sour cream, diced avacado and top with fresh chopped cilantro. YUM! So easy!

Great recipe!  Thanks for sharing.  I made a couple of changes.  I used the entire breast from a left over rotisserie chicken. Sauteed chicken, onion and garlic together about 5 min.  I wanted more broth, so I used 3 cans instead of 2. Added a dash of white pepper and used a good salsa. Instead of corn, I used a can of great northern white beans. Excellent!  Everything else the same.

We made this soup one night on a whim and it was really easy to prepare.  Even though we did not have cumin we followed the recipe as directed and it worked out just fine. I did cut the chicken breast into strips before cooking it.  Simple ingredients, not much fuss, and really tasty!  This recipe is a keeper!

Seemed a little brothy for my taste so I added a can of fat free refried beans, worked well to thicken it. I also added a can of black beans.
I think next time I make it I'll use more chicken and try Rotel tomatoes instead of the salsa.
You could play with this recipe a lot and always come up with something delicious.

This is a fantastic recipe and this comes from someone who once burned spaghetti!!  I did follow the advice of another and used taco seasoning since my spice cabinet is sparse and a rotissere chicken, shredded up.  I am not the most skilled cook and I have little time for lengthy cooking, but this was one of the easiest and best recipes I have tried!!

I made this with some leftover Pork Ribs that we had grilled. It was great. Like some suggested I added black beans.
My husband kept asking is there any of that soup left?

Very good, easy recipe. The first time I made it I used salsa from the jar and the recipe was good, but I had jack up the spices a bit.  The second time I used fresh salsa from the refrigerated aisle and that made a big difference - it has a much better fresh tomato taste.  I also used a roasted garlic salsa so I omitted the garlic called for in the recipe.  Either way, it's better the second day!

Oh, sooo goood. I added twice the amount of cumin that the recipe called for. And I didn't really dig the idea of throwing tostitos in my beautiful soup, so I cut some corn tortillas into strips and deep fried them myself, sprinkling a little chile powder on them while they simmered. They were perfect for this recipe. I also added some avocado slices on top. I think it was the best soup I ever had.

This was a wonderful recipe!  The only thing I changed was the addition of a can of black beans.  Even my very picky husband loved it!  We had enough for leftovers the next day, and it made the flavors combine to make it even more flavorful.  I will defintely put it together the night before the next time I make this.  Topped with tortilla chips, cheese, chopped cilanto, and a squeeze of lime, it was a fantastic meal!

This is a great Tortilla soup!!!  I will definitely be making again.  I added some black beans for consistency and it was so yummy.  I also shredded the chicken, added it back in, and let it simmer another 15 minutes to absorb the flavor.  Perfect!

This recipe was great! I made it for my parents and I, and even though it was only the second thing I cooked by my self, it turned out delious! This maindish is full of commelements! 
I used alvaco instead of sourcream, added 1 can of mexiacan beans and corn, and only had 1 can of plain corn. Then I had a 1 can of big purple beans. I like to add the juice of the beans for falvor. For cheese i used a bag of shreded cheses two kinds. Other that that I think thats all the cratitivity I used for this one. It turned out very good! I even ate the left overs!

Everyone loves this when I serve it,  I have used canned chicken from Sam's Club, and used bouillion cubes when I don't have time to cook chicken or have can broth on hand.  Good taste, easy to throw together!

My husband is not a big soup fan and loved this dish. Putting the chips on the bottom was great. I added some zucchini that I had in the fridge.

This is great for a family with small children, because it's not too spicy.  I personally would like to have more spice in it, but I don't think my three year old would appreciate that.  Excellent family meal. I will for sure make again.

This was really good. The only thing I did differently was add some Frank's Red Hot sauce to it for a little more spice, about a tablespoon or so. Thanks for the recipe.

Ok I hate it when people change recipes they get online but I had to. I browned 1 cup of rice in a bit of olive oil with half of the cumin, garlic, lemon juice, and chili powder. Then I added the chicken broth/stock, corn, the other half of the dry ingredients, lemon juice, 3 bone-in skin on chicken thighs, and one can of tomatoes with jalepenos. I brought it to a boil then reduced for 25 min. It had enough juice and the chicken was tender. It was awsome!!!!!!!!!!

I'm an avid cook and this was a great recipe because it tasted delicious and was easy.  As usual, I made some changes:  I started by sauteeing the onion and garlic in 1 T. olive oil, added cumin and chili powder and cooked until fragrant.  Added remaining ingredients, substituting one shredded rotisserie chicken for the chicken breasts. I was out of salsa so I used a small can of diced tomatoes with green chiles instead. I also added one can of black beans.  I boosted the richness by melting in 1 cup of shredded cheddar/jack cheese at the end.  Garnished with fried strips of corn tortillas, diced avocado and sour cream.    Received rave reviews.

this was excellent. i too added a can of drained and rinsed black beans, slightly more corn and i also added one can of water (14.5 oz) to cut back on the sodium a bit. (i did not have low sodium broth). the flavors are great. a great way to use up some leftover chix breast from grilling or even a picked over roasted chix from dinner the night before...thank you for sharing

I loved this!  I used an entire can of yellow corn and left out the onions.  I also sliced up some black olives and fresh carrots, added some sliced jalapenos, and threw in a can of black-eyed peas.  I didn't have any chicken broth on hand, so I threw in 1 cup of water with a boullion cube -- but this just made it super salty.  I would leave out the cube next time around.  I made up some cornbread and served it with honey and/or butter.  A great and hearty meal, perfect for using up scraps of leftover chicken!

I agree with other reviewers that this recipe was a bit vague, but when I followed their advice it turned out great.  I boiled the chicken first with a couple cloves of garlic, then shredded it.  I used Embassa brand salsa.  I also used 1 tsp taco seasoning rather than chili powder and cumin, which I did not have.  I also used 3/4 C yellow onion and 1/4 C red onion, and bullion rather than broth.  I don't know if that made any difference, it's just what I had on hand.  The result was fantastic, one of the best tortilla soups I've had.

This is the best tortilla soup I've ever had!  I order tortilla soup at every Mexican restaurant I go to because I LOVE IT!  This recipe was the King of tortilla soup recipes.  We added shredded cheese, tortilla chips, sour cream and chopped avacados.  To die for!

Great base recipe.  Adjusted a little since I used what I had on hand...3 large skinless, boneless chicken breasts, 4 cloves of garlic, 46 oz. of chicken broth (1 box and 1 can), 3/4 of the large 28 oz. can of diced tomatoes, 3/4 of the 4.5 oz can of chopped green chilis (would have gladly used the whole thing but hubby doesn't like too much heat), 1 can of black beans (drained and rinsed), 1-1/2 cups of frozen corn, 1 packet of taco seasoning, liberal amounts of cumin and black pepper, and a handful of crushed tortilla chips.  Served with sour cream and cheese.  The texture was perfect.  Mmmm!

I used a taco spice pack as  did a other reviewer did.  i also added black beans, and to thicken it up a bit I ground up some tortilla chips in a coffee grinder about two grinders full.  My wife had two bowls, she never has two bowls.

I love this recipe. I am huge into experimenting, so I altered this recipe by using more jalapenos, less broth, more corn, and more onions. I also prepared the chicken with Mexican Chili Pepper, minced garlic, onions, and diced green and jalapeno peppers. I took half of the cheese and added it directly into the soup, letting it sit for more than four hours. When I served it, we used homemade tortilla strips and the rest of the cheese. It was a huge hit with my family.

This was really good, but not overly outstanding. We added some red and green chili pepppers as well as orange and yellow bell peppers. Served 2 of us with a single scoop leftover. Next time we'll double it for leftovers. Will definately make this again.

Very flavorful!  I substituted one envelope of taco seasoning instead of all the other spices.  Also just used water/boulion in place of chicken broth.  Added some black beans too.

Fabulous! I altered it a tiny bit, adding more chicken broth, but it turned out wonderful. Very tasty and very filling. My family's requested to have it again soon! In future though, I will add either noodles or rice to give it a little more substance, and a little less spice, as my youngest said it was too hot, but other than that is was perfect!

It was very good, but not as spicy as we would have liked (hence not a 5). I addwd a can of black beans & a small can of green chilis. We topped it with shredded Cheddar & Pepper Jack cheeses. If you cover the pot during the 20-30 minute simmer you shouldn't need extra broth.

I thought this was fabulous!  The flavor was fantastic.  We did add black bean and kidney beans and used can corned instead.  Topped it offf with avocado, sour cream and chips, it was delicious and will replace our old tortilla soup recipe!

Very good.  A bit more time consuming since some similar soups are just made by "opening cans".  Next time I may try canned chicken, or leftover rotisserie chicken.  Don't leave out the citrus; it adds a lot!  I used half lemon, half lime.

I used leftover chicken breast torn into bite sized pieces .  And, I sauteed the onion in olive oil, then added spices, then chicken.  I moved it all to a stockpot where I combined all the remaining ingredients and tossed in a dash of hot sauce.  Maybe we're big eaters, but this just made enough for my husband and I.  Next time he asked me to double the recipe for leftovers.  He thought it was that good!

This recipe is an exceptional find! I join everyone who wishes they could give it more then five stars. I think it's the lemon juice that gives it the extra tanginess. Next time I'll use more broth, as others suggested.

This was a good chicken tortilla soup recipe!  I made some minor adjustments... I boiled chicken breast tenders in a chicken broth/water combo, sauteed the onion and garlic and added seasonings and lemon juice, then 32 oz. chicken broth and a full jar of salsa, and the shredded chicken.  I'm eating it now and it tastes great!

This was great!  Since I was making a large amount for a church supper I boiled the chicken first and then threw everything together in a crockpot on high for about 5 hours.  It turned out wonderfully.  Thanks!

Absolutely love this recipe!  I try slight tweaks each time and found adding green chilies and a can of enchilada sauce to be good alternatives.  I cut the chix broth depending on my mood for consistency.

This is a great soup recipe, if you prefer broth based tortilla soups (as I do). It tastes very similar to the soup served at one of my favorite cafes. I doubled my recipe and used lime juice instead of lemon. Because I do not like the taste of most jarred salsas, I used 2 cans of diced tomatoes with chili pepppers. Yikes! I should have tasted them before I added them because they were super spicy! To compensate, I added extra water and let it cook a little longer. Still turned out fantastic!

GREAT tortilla soup!  I made the recipe just as said, and I added 1/2 can black beans (some salsas already have black beans).  Will make again and again!  Family loved it too!

Yum! Didn't change a thing except I shredded the chicken and added cayenne to spice it up. I made baked tortilla chips from a recipe on this website and it was fabulous meal.

Wonderful!  To save time, I used part of a rotisserie chicken.  Also, I would recommend putting in the chips on top to keep them crunchy longer.  I did take the suggestion of sauteing the onion 1st, but I think next time I won't to see if it would be a little crisper.  No matter what you do - it's a definite keeper!

I served this for friends and we all loved it.  I did kick up the flavor a bit with some extra cumin and salt for flavor.  Next time I make it I think I'll double the stock and seasoning so there's more soup.  After the first serving, there wasn't a lot of the broth left.

This recipe is wonderful or to build on and there is plenty left over. I have made this a number of times with the following changes: I boil the chicken first then shred it, I also add in black beans, rice, jalapenos, red, green and yellow or orange peppers diced and i usually double the spices. it turns out beautifully with sour cream and cheese on top! Serve it with cornbread and you have a hearty and beautifully colored meal.

This was so good.  I had some ground chicken in the freezer that I wanted to use up, so I used that instead of the chicken breasts.  I also did not have any salsa, but I added fresh tomatoes and black beans.  Yummmm!  Thanks for the recipe.  I will make again!

I had leftover rotisserie chicken and needed something to do with it.  This was great.  I added a few things (black beans, 1 jalapeno) and left out the corn.  Excellent.  I can't wait to have the leftovers!

I'm a vegetarian, so I didn't actually taste this, but my parents really seemed to like it. I sauteed the chicken for just two minutes  before adding the garlic (increased to 1T), cumin (increased to 1.5tsp), chili powder, and 2T of fresh chopped cilantro.  I sauteed all of that for an additional 3 minutes, then added the broth, corn, lemon juice, and salsa to simmer for an hour.  I topped it with cheese and served with tortilla wedges (cut flour tortillas into eighths; brushed with 1 T vegetable oil + 1/4 tsp lime juice; sprinkled on a mixture of 1/8 tsp chili powder, 1/4 tsp garlic powder, 1/4 tsp cumin, and 1 tsp salt; baked at 350 degrees for 10 minutes).

We LOVED this soup - and it was SO easy!
I cooked the chicken breasts as directed, but didn't know what to do with them after they were cooked, as the recipe doesn't specify.  We ended up cutting them in bite-size chunks - and that worked out well for us.  I used Pace Chunky Picante Sauce and used the full cup.  We garnised it with sliced avocados (yummy), tortilla chips and a Monterey Jack Blend cheese.  It was excellent and I am working on the second pot right now.  This time I am leaving the corn out - personal preference.  
This recipe is definitely going into the "favorites" cookbook.  Thank you for sharing.

Absolutely awesome!  I was not convinced that this would be great simply because it seems so easy.  Well, it IS easy, and it IS great!  I boiled the chicken breast and then used the broth (with a few added boullion).  I about tripled the amount of cumin and chili pepper and used my homemade salsa (with lots of cilantro and jalapeno).  I also made my own tortilla chips and crushed a few over each bowl of soup (in addition to some additional cilantro, some green onion, and a touch of cheese).  My family loved this, and my sons have already asked when I'll make it again.  Thank you for a truly excellent recipe!

This was a definite favorite in our house! I used "On the Border" salsa to really spice it up and lots of cheese and everyone was a clean plater! This is a keeper.

Very Good!  I've made this several times and will continue to make it!  I double the recipe, put it in a crockpot all afternoon.  I rarely have cans of chicken broth so I just use the equivalent of chicken bullion cubes.  I add a can of stewed tomatoes and instead of corn I use a 16oz bag of frozen gumbo vegetables (a frozen bag of soup veggies works just as well).

Great recipe.  I doubled the cumin as suggested in several reviews, served it at a big family gathering and everyone LOVED it, I should have made more, everyone wanted seconds.  I highly recommend this recipe, and it was soooo easy.

Delicous! I much prefer this to the thick, creamy chicken tortilla soup recipes. I think they should be a little brothy so first you get the crunch of the tortilla chips and then they soften and thicken the soup a bit themselves.

This was delicious.  I used a can of Rotel instead of salsa and added some garlic salt.  It was awesome, with or without the toppings!  I will definitely make this again.

This was the best soup ever! I added a can of black beans rinsed and drained, 1 can of mexicorn drained (instead of the white corn), 1 can of mexican rotel tomatoes. Served it with monterey jack/cheddar cheese and crunched up Tostitos and everyone is still talking about it! Thanks for sharing your recipe! Valerie

I did double the recipe to make sure there were leftovers =)

I love this recipe.  I have made it for parties at work in the winter and it has always gotten rave reviews.  Sometimes, to make it a little heartier, I add noodles.  It is always wonderful with or without.  It is a hit with the DH and kids also.

This was a great starting place for this soup.  I added black beans and a lot more garlic.  Next time I might kick up the cumin a bit and add a jalepeno.

Very tasty and my guests enjoyed it!

My first attempt at cooking!  Very good recipe; the soup turned out wonderfully.  I added a can of black beans, some Ortega green chillis and cilantro for a little extra oomph.  Easy to make and very good.  Served with a side of homemade guacamole and tortillas.

Ever since having Tortilla Soup at El Torito in California I've always looked for a similar recipe, and I think this is it!!! This soup was amazingly simple, and good! For a change it was nice not having to purchase a new set of condiments in order to cook!

I thought it was good.  I ate it with the tortilla chips on the side as I prefer them crispier & my husband put them in the soup.  As he doesn't like dishes too spicy, I'd probably try 1/8 tsp cumin & 1/4 tsp chili powder next time & just taste the soup to see if it needed more.

Something was missing from this recipe.  It tasted OK but was too watery without enough bulk and the corn chips turned almost instantly to mush.

Made receipie exactly as stated but used rotisserie chicken. Since chicken was already cooked just brought to a boil and served. The whole family enjoyed. I used PACE for the salsa. Great flavor, but wish I had doubled it, did not notice this only makes 4 servings. Will make again.

Excellent recipe!  I added extra corn and a can of drained black beans.  Did not cube chicken - just threw everything in the crockpot and after 7 hours, I removed and shredded the chicken before replacing in the pot.  I cut corn tortillas into strips, sprayed with baking spray and cooked in 375 degree oven until they were crisp...put them on top of soup with Monterey Jack cheese...delicious!

Okay so you guys are gonna love this. Only changes I made was that I added Sol beer to it! Every time I make this, it’s always killer and the whole family loves it! The beer just gives it that extra kick but it’s subtle. This recipe is authentic just like when your south of the border. Not to mention it really helps out when your sick. Almost like a home remedy. So so so good!

Excellent recipe & very tweakable. I combined several tweak suggestions. I added w slivered corn tortillas to the pot because the soup seemed a bit thin. I did not use any corn or black beans but may do so next time.  Doesn't seem to need these.  I bought a can of enchilada sauce to add but first   tasted it & it was much too peppery.  Be careful with all such salsas & products.  Yes, needs more chili powder & cumin. Will serve with cheese, cilantro, toasted tortilla strips & avocados, sour cream. My version made about 4 quarts or a  full Dutch oven

This soup turned out Fantastic!! I did make one change and some additions. First I used a Salsa Verde for the salsa (didn’t have any red). Then some veggies, carrots and zucchini added, and pared it with some cilantro lime rice. Wow was it good!

I loved it. I did it as a slow cooker recipe though. I just briwned the chicken first. while it was cooking I added the liquids and spices to the crock pot. I cooked all day on low.

I never made tortilla soup before. This was easy and delicious. I used an already prepared rotisserie chicken and just added all the ingredients to that. I used fresh corn off the cob and just let it cook in the broth. Not major tweaks, I just used what I already had. Yummy!

I read the reviews on this recipe before making it, like i always do with any new recipe, and followed what was said about not putting salt and adding black beans. I did not use chunky salsa because i had some my mom made( she's mexican so can't get more authentic than that ?) It needed more broth for sure, the picture shows my plate with ALL the broth from the pot. instead of tortilla chips i used a tostada, same thing. Topped with sour cream and cheese

This was sooo good! The only thing I did different was I added more chicken broth, about 8 cups and added a can of rinsed, black beans. Make sure to add the chips, sour cream and cheese after. Yum!

This soup came out great!  I did make some minor adjustments.  I added a can of rinsed black and a can of diced tomatoes to give it more body but then had to add more water (a couple of cups?) because it then become more of a stew instead of soup.  I also added a bit of black pepper (maybe half a tablespoon?).  The result was absolutely delicious!  Thanks for sharing!

I was really surprised at how good this is - I thought the recipe looked too simple!  I made it with rotisserie chicken and only used one carton (32 oz) of chicken broth, and let it simmer on warm for about 2 hours.  Since I'm trying to trim calories, I didn't even do the chips, cheese and sour cream, which would make it all the better I'm sure!

Like a party in your mouth!   Better when topped with corn tortilla strips shallow fried in oil, sliced avocado, and sour cream.

I  have made this soup as written and it was received well by volunteers I fed.  However, I felt it could be tweaked, so here goes.  In addition  to the salsa, I also added  a can of Rotel.  Any diced tomatoes with chilies would work.  In place of chili powder I used taco seasoning ( probably a bit more).  For Mexican, I usually use lime juice instead of lemon.  I like black beans so those were also added.  Last I added dried cilantro.  I put everything together in a Dutch oven including the uncooked chicken and let it simmer on the stove.   When the chicken was done, I removed it, shredded it, and returned it to the pot to simmer for a few more minutes.  While this is really good as is, the Monterey Jack cheese and sour cream puts it over the top.

Yup, I’ve made it many times and found it to be a great base.  5 stars are because it’s inspiring.  A couple of things.  One pot is all that’s needed.  Sauté the onions, celery and garlic in the oil first.  Cook the chicken in the broth (Add a lot more broth).  I use 4 quarts total.  Always shrewd the cooked chicken and replace after adding all ingredients except corn.  I add a can of diced tomatoes, rinsed black beans and about a half cup of rinsed white rice along with the corn.  Cilantro is a must as well as the lemon.  Add another recipe amount of cumin.  Use good chunky salsa about 16 ozs.  This makes about 12 healthy servings.

I changed it up a little bit by adding more broth and white rice to it.  As a result, I added a little more ground cumin, minced garlic and salsa.  I also air-fried the chicken breast and then cut in cubes.  It came out delicious.  I made so much that I had to place the rest in containers and freeze it.

Made a couple changes and turned out great! We used rotisserie chicken and cooked down with cumin. A can of whole corn- drained, a jar of a Mexican salsa, tablespoon of rotel with green Chile’s, and squeezed a lime into it.

This soup is amazing and super easy to make. I added black beans to it and cooked it in the crock pot all day. I took it to work and it was devoured. I can't imagine trying to eat it without the sour cream and cheese though. Next time, i'm making it with ground chuck or skirt steak.

I’ve made other chicken tortilla soup recipes, but this one is the best. Instead of lemon juice, I added the juice from 2 limes.  I also added a small can of stewed tomatoes, a can of black beans and fresh cilantro. I would highly recommend garnishing with a dollop of sour cream, it really kicks it up a notch!

This was very good, however 1/2 tsp of Chile powder is not enough for people who really like Mexican food.  I used a generous tablespoon of Chile powder, 1 and 1/2 tsp of cumin and added 1 and 1/2 tsp. of oregano, plus a 4 oz can of mild Chiles.

Very good! Made it 2 times in one week. I did add some changes. Instead of lemon I used lime. I added a can of spicy black beans. The frozen corn I used also had a south west season. And I used a cooked rotisserie chicken but that’s because I’m lazy :)

This recipe was  good starting point. I didn’t have corn so I used a can of drained hominy then used a full can of black beans.  I put in about 1 Tbsp of chili powder and a couple of tablespoons of tomato paste.  Added a little more broth than what it calls for and the soup was nick and thick. I’ll make this over and over again!

This was so easy to make and had a lot of flavor.  Instead of putting one cup of salsa I added 1/2 cup and filled the rest with water.  I didn't want to overdo the spice.

I don’t like using processed products so I made chicken stock from scratch and then shredded the chicken.  made homemade black beans the night before and added them to the soup at the end.  instead using of canned salsa I diced up some tomatoes and jalapeño.  Spicy!   Also added a few carrots.   It turned out good.  I’ll make it again for sure.

I definitely will make this again. I tripled recipe and added a can of black beans. Served with southwest salad, jalapeño squares and corn bread. Great served with a dollop of sour cream,  Jack cheese and a few tortilla chips.

This is an excellent base for Tortilla Soup. I like my Tortilla Soup with chunky veggies so I added in 1 zuchini and 1 yellow squash sliced in .5" half rounds and about 1.5 cups cubed acorn squash. I did what another person said: boiled the chicken breasts (4) in water with garlic and salt, then shredded once cool to touch. Topped each bowl with fresh avocado slices, sour cream, grated cheddar cheese and fresh cilantro. I had to increase the chicken broth with these added veggies. Great family hearty dish that fed us for several days. Yum!

I loved this recipe! Bonus factors, it’s so easy to make, quick to reheat, and fairly healthy to ingest! 
The only thing I did different to give the soup more substance is I pulse the entire batch in my Vitamix until the chicken was completely shredded (but yet the vegetables were still chunky). 
Loved it and will definitely make again.

This recipe was so simple to make yet had my family going back for seconds. We like a bit of spice so we opted for hot salsa instead of the mild, and we fried our own tortilla chips. some on the bottom and some on top added a great texture element. This will be a soup that gets made often in my house

I made this yesterday and my family of 4 ate on it for dinner and brunch and then proceeded to ask me to make it again for dinner, lol!  I had to go to the store to get a few things in order to do so but I've made it again tonight.  Great flavor and overall yumminess.  We tried bowls of it alone, with shredded cheese added, with and without tortilla chips and also with just sour cream in it and we each like it most ways!  I did put some cream in it last night but not a lot, maybe 1/4-1/2 cup; however, if you add cheese and/or sour cream it would have the same kind of effect really. The sour cream takes it to a whole new level!!
P.S.  I have added black beans (optional per recipe) but so far I've only used Trader Joe's Cuban Style Black Beans and I think they are part of what really puts this over the top as far as overall flavor goes!  I also happened to use chicken I baked with pepper and garlic powder then shredded - mostly because it was a time/convenience thing.

I used a mix of fresh tomatoes, onions and jalapenos and cilantro rather than store bought salsa.  kept the rest of the ingredients the same but I pan seared the chicken, baked it and hand shredded it. Added it to the rest and cooked it in a crockpot. Takes longer but I think it's worth it.

Simple and delicious recipe. I added a small can of drained green chili’s and a squeeze of fresh lime juice at the end. A keeper!

So good and easy to make. I used chicken strips that were cooked already  but cut into smaller pieces and a can of kidney beans.. I also added a handful of cilantro ( stems and all ). This will be my go to soup on taco Tuesdays. Thank you for sharing.

This recipe turned out great! I had to adjust it a little for a soupier version - I added almost a full 32 oz box of chicken broth, a full 16 oz jar of salsa, and shredded the chicken. Everything else worked out great. I will most certainly be making this again.

This was very good, but I wanted more flavor from it. I doubled the garlic and cumin. I also added diced tomatoes and 2 more chicken bouillon cubes. Family loved the result.

It was a great soup but I recommend using low sodium chicken broth or cutting the salt down cause mine turned out really salty.

I have made this one twice now. The first time all I had was a can of cream corn so I substituted, the second time I made it as per the recipe. Both times it turned out great but I have to say I liked the creamier version with the cream corn best. This recipe will become part of my regular fare as it is very tasty and easy to make.

Didn't change anything and my family loved it. I would probably put more vegetables in it like black beans however, I wanted to rate the recipe as stated. So yummy and so easy, why complicate it. I put all of the ingredients in a slow cooker and it came out perfectly. Also I had frozen chicken breasts that I put in the slow cooker so I didn't need to add the oil.  Add a slow cooker liner for easy clean up !

Kind of a blah soup.  To make this more of a traditional Mexican soup, nix the garlic, add more chile powder (mild), add cumin and oregano and don't add salsa.    If you want more veg, add chopped Anaheim from the jar or can.  They add more flavor and are easy to use.  Monterey Jack is the wrong kind of cheese for this soup, I recommend using queso fresco or other fresh Mexican cheese.   We don't add tomato products as it takes away from these Mexican flavors.  Tomato would make it more Italian. For the best tortilla soup, saute a chopped onion in coconut oil, when the onions are transparent, add the spices and herbs making a roux ( cook for 2 to 3 minutes). Add the broth (I use Better Than Bouillon roasted chicken paste, no MSG), then add the other ingredients and simmer until hot.  add the tortillas, spoon into warm bowls and top with queso fresco.   We don't add beans to this kind of soup.  For the amount of liquid stated in this recipe, I would use 2 to 3 tablespoons of mild chile powder.  Each person can add their own desired heat when served.  Not everybody likes spicy hot food, Mexican or not.

Great easy recipe. As with everything I cook, added way more garlic, I threw a can of black beans in there too and some dried peppers I found at a Fiesta. Pairs great with a Topo Chico, each sip cleanses the palette and intensifies the next bite.

Turned out great!  Made a few changes. First I did black beans instead of corn. I put all ingredients in the crockpot and let it cook all day. Then about an hour before it was done I added cilantro and topped with spicy cheese when serving. Loved it and it made the whole house smell amazing. Will make again and again!  Thanks!

Place the following in crockpot:Frozen chicken breast tenders 6-7One small can of green chilies1 jar of chunky medium salsaHalf of a large onion chopped 1 green bell pepper choppedOne cup of mexicorn6 cups of chicken broth (or more)1/2 Tbsp chili powder1/2 tsp Garlic1/2 tsp CuminCrockpot for 5 hours high- add can of drained and rinsed black beans towards end so they don’t fall apartShred chicken/place back in soup and continue cooking soup for 1 more hourTake Corn Tortillas/cut into strips and spray with cooking spray- bake for 5-10 min, flip halfway— could also use old taco shells! Just crush in bowl Serve by placing tortilla strips in bowl, pour soup over, add dollop of sour cream, cheese, avocado and cilantro and lime slice YUM!!!!! Thank you for this recipe!

Very good. Should have added black beans.  I cooked im Dutch oven with vegetables first and then added chicken broth and taco seasoning packet. Added chicken and poached low and slow for 1.5 hours. Will definitely make it again.

This delicious soup was quick to make and absolutely the best tortilla soup I've tasted or made.  I'm not a fan of over-the-top tomato flavor, and the red salsa is perfect!  I made no changes to the recipe, but I used my Instant Pot.  This made it very quick and easy with minimal clean up!

I have made this soup so many times now. I can eat it for lunch and dinner for a week without getting sick of it. I use way more garlic (I use about 1/2 a head every time I use garlic), and I at least double the chili powder and cumin. I throw everything in the slow cooker (my chicken breasts are always frozen), and use enough broth to almost fill the crock pot. I put it on high for 4-5 hours, or on low all day while I'm at work. About 1/2 hrs before eating, I take the chicken out and shred it, and add a can of rinsed black beans. I definitely prefer the whole grain tortilla chips in this soup but it's good either way! I also sub lime juice for lemon juice, and double that too since I use more broth.

I love the flavor of the soup, but when my 4 and 2 year old(and even my husband) see chunks of tomatoes(from the salsa) or pieces of onions, they immediately won't eat it. Blending these(and even the chicken)  in my ninja with the chicken broth solved my problem and allowed the whole family to enjoy! Yummy!

I feel this was a good base. I would give it 3.5 stars if I could. As another user suggested, I also poached the chicken breast in the stock for 15 minutes, shredded it, then added back to the stock and added the rest of the ingredients—plus a can of black beans (drained). To add a little more spice, I added a mini can of Ortega fire roasted green chilies (mild), a few shakes of smoked paprika, salt, and pepper. I garnished it with fresh cilantro, green onions, sour cream and avocado.

I added black beans per another recommendation. Glad I did. Boyfriend loved it so much he asked to make it again 2 weeks later. First time served with jalapeño cornbread and honey butter, second time with banana bread. This soup is easy to make, flavorful and easy to make. It’s a keeper.

Made it with extra broth as recommended by commenter. Also used the caned embasa brand salsa- no tomotoy taste. Just good good tasting spice. Also cooked chicken, cooled, the hand shredded.

My husband and I really liked this recipe. I had everything on hand to make it. Made it as written, as I usually do the first time. Next time instead of the tortilla chips in the bottom, didn't care for them all soggy, I might try soft flour tortilla cut in small pieces, for a almost dumpling like effect. Or perhaps dip my chips in it as I eat it. My husband even gave it a thumbs up, and he is quite picky.

We LOVED this soup.  I followed the recipe but just added a half a can of black beans.  Hubby added jalapenos to his bowl.  We both added chopped avocado, sour cream, a sprinkle of fresh cilantro and some grated jalapeno pepper jack cheese on top of the soup .  Wow!  It was utterly delicious.  This one is going into the rotation as a regular occurrence at our dinner table.

yum! my entire family loved it.  I used Pace restaurant style salsa.  it was plenty acidic so i skipped the lime juice.  Also i didn't have any chili powder so, sliced up some jalapenos and put a slice in everyone's bowl.  Definitely a keeper.

it definitely was a hit. we all loved it.
I did add sour cream, Adobe seasoning with white pepper. clove of garlic and avocado. it's wonderful to make your own tortilla chips, with Yellow Corn Tortillas, slice into small strips, fry in olive oil, salt to taste, garnishing a top to set it off. also i cut the remaining pkg of corn tortilla into the shape of chips, fry  ing, salt to taste. adding to soup. enjoy.

I made a few slight changes but that's the fun of cooking. Instead of salsa I just added a 8 oz tomato sauce, and black beans to go with the frozen corn, used frozen chicken breast. I used my slow cooker and after 8 hours I shredded the chicken. I top the soup with the cheese and sour cream. Love to eat this with tortilla chips!

This was so easy to make! I did make a few adjustments. I boiled and shredded the chicken rather than cube it. And I added a can of black beans instead of the corn. Turned out GREAT. It's my current favorite thing, and I can't get enough!

This soup was terrific! I followed some others suggestions, and added an extra can of chicken broth, used the juice of one small lime instead of lemon, and adding a can of black beans is a must! I also used heaping cups of salsa, corn and onion (just a little extra of each) as well as a large heaping 1/4 tsp of the cumin since others said it needed a little more. I sautéed the onion in the soup pot for about 5 minutes, then added the cubed raw chicken and lightly cooked each side with the garlic and seasonings, about 5 minutes total. I added the broth and rest of ingredients to the pot before the chicken was fully cooked to prevent it from getting dry, and let it finish cooking as the soup simmered. Another good addition to tortilla soup is some diced chunks of avocado garnishing your bowl (don't cook the avocado, just add it to your hot bowl at the end) it's always served like that in San Diego... Delish!

Very good and easy to add extra ingredients to to make it your own. I made it as suggested, just leaving out the corn as I can't handle corn since my bariatric surgery. It tasted very good, and you control the spiciness depending on the kind of salsa and amount of spices you add.

Definitely a keeper. The only thing i did different was with the salsa. I used a garlic salsa & since my family is not a fan of chunky salsa i pureed the salsa with an immersion blender. Voila! Great flavor & no chunks. It actually thickened it slightly. Already made it again & am adding to family favorites.

This is soooo good. Quick to make . I will make this soup often. The only change I made is the frozen corn. I used frozen mixed vegetables with peas, corn and carrots. Great soup with just of touch of Mexican flare. MAKE IT !!!!

My husband & I loved this soup! I used this recipe as a base and these are some changes I made because I didn't have everything according to the original recipe:
I used left over broth from a Chorizo/cabbage dish I had made.
I browned 2 mild Italian sausages and added some left over cooked chicken as well.
I used one large carton chicken broth and a 28 oz can of tomatoes.
I also added a can of black beans and some minute Rice!
My spices were basically the same - some salt, garlic powder, cumin, chili powder and 1/2 lemon.
I served it with grated cheese, sour cream and broken up nacho chips! Yum, yum!
It's a keeper! I will make this soup again! ??

I always follow original recipe first.  Since recipe didn't state 'cooked or raw,' I assumed you saute the chicken cubes first, so that's what I did.  This didn't need any changes.

A real thrill - my hubby usually can't eat Mexican-type food but this looked relatively safe. He definitely can't handle garlic, so we left that out. Doubled the recipe, used a slow cooker this a.m. as guests were do for dinner. Did make changes thanks to several reviewers: Added a can of black beans and used canned corn, used lime juice instead of lemon, used 2 qts. of broth, thickened soup with cornmeal, completely forgot the chips; and served separate dishes with sour cream, cilantro leaves, sliced ripe olives, chopped scallions, and lime wedges on the table - everybody loved it, had seconds, and want the recipe. It was amazing - the basic recipe is wonderful, and the additions were above and beyond. Thank you!

I doubled the recipe (leftovers!)  My husband said he would prefer less lemon juice.  I think it would best best to place the tortilla chips on the top, along with the cheese and sour cream.

I used chicken thighs,  Rotel diced tomatoes and chile, and topped with chipotle cheese, sour cream and jalapeño tortilla chips, it was delicious! I sautéed onions in olive oil, then added the chicken. Once cooked through, I cut up chicken in bite size pieces, then added rest of ingredients and simmered about 45 minutes. I served with corn bread. This recipe is a keeper!

I thought this was a good base recipe. Flavors could be stronger...maybe more spice and seasoning and heat? I added a can of refried black beans, a great thickener. I also used an entire jar of salsa, which I thought it could take even more tomato flavor. Perhaps a can of diced or rotel along with the salsa. I also used shredded chicken that I had previously cooked in the slowcooker.I will continue to modify this until I get it just the way I want it :)

I find it funny for those who said it was hard to mix the chicken and cumin well as the directions were vague.  Read the recipe again.  It clearly says two boneless skinless chicken breasts cut into cubes.  Besides that it seems pretty obvious that you need to cube the chicken, who wants a whole breast in there bowl of soup.  This was a great recipe and we will be making this again.  I do agree with lime being used instead of lemon however..
Thanks for a great recipe

Delicious recipe but I feel like something is missing compared to restaurant chicken tortilla soups.  I'm not sure what it is, but I can't say this recipe is better than I've had in a Mexican restaurant.  But, in a pinch, it's fairly quick and yummy.

Really tasty soup! Didn't use the salsa the first time, so I had to up the spices a bit. I agree with most of the previous reviews that the chicken should be shredded; just taste better for some reason.

I love it.  I don't change anything except I add a can of black beans if I have them.  I really can't think of another soup that I can put together this quickly that I like as well.

Yum! Super easy and delicious. I doubled for the family. This is good with tortilla chips and torn apart corn tortillas. I liked mine with a squeeze of lime juice and a little Mexican cheese and avocado on top. All 3 small kids ate it and liked! Not spicy but very flavorful! Good with a little Valentina to spice it up!

I had leftover chicken I made in the crockpot for quesadillas  (2 lbs chicken, one can of rotel tomatoes and green chili, super easy to make) and I used that chicken.  I substituted one can of cream of chicken with one can of water for the chicken broth.  Served it as suggested on top of nacho chips and with sour cream and avocado thinly sliced - easy and delicious, thank you!

This is a great recipe. I do rise and drain a can of black bean and add it in. Topping it with cheeses, sour cream, avocado, and the colored tortilla strips. I always double and triple the recipe and freeze it. It is alway great thawed and reheated.

This soup is fantastic. I made a few changes, though. I used lime juice instead of lemon juice, I added black beans, too. And cilantro for garnish. I also backed down the chili powder to 1/4 tsp plus some salt and pepper to taste. This soup was so good my family even loved it. I will definitely be making this again. Thanks for the recipe.

It was a bit vague, but a good easy recipe. I added black beans before I even noticed others had done it! It just looked like It needed something! I served it with rice and it tasted great. I let my 9 year old help make this as she learns to cook. It's not too bad. I will do this one again!

I made this last week for dinner since I don't knowusually canned broth I used homemade stock, and rotisserie chicken. It smelled so yummy I was so excited that I forgot the cheese and lime. Lol also was out of salsa so I used a can of stewed tomatoes and a some pickled jalapeños. It really was wonderful.

I make this a lot. Everyone loves it! I like to add a bit more salsa, cumin, and chili powder. Usually I make 10-12 servings and buy a Rotisserie lemon-pepper Chicken from The store and pull all the chicken off minus the skin. Saves time and dishes. I also love to add 2-3 cans of Black beans or White, Pinto, whatever you like. Adds more fiber and protein! Very hearty soup even without Tortilla chips!  The sprinkle of Monterey Jack cheese or a dollop of Sour cream is frosting on the cake. Chives or green onions too.

This is my second time making this soup. I prefer boiling the chicken first then shredding it, then letting it simmer in the pot with the rest of the ingredients.  The tortilla chips on the bottom add a nice flavor and some crunch but of course they will get soggy if they sit too long.

This is an awesome soup! I use left over roast chicken or a deli chicken, up the child powder and add a can of rinsed black beans . I add a dollop of sour cream just before serving. I have made it many times and for impromptu guest lunches and everyone raves about it!

Great and flavorful! I made the following changes: I sautéed the onions first, then browned whole chicken breasts. I boiled them in the broth then pulled them out and shredded them with two forks. I used canned corn, because it's what I had. I used half the chili powder since I have a toddler. Also, I used lime juice instead of lemon, again because I had limes. Then, i topped it with diced avocado and cilantro. Turned out great!

We loved this soup! It has become our "go to" recipe and to be honest we can't find a restaurant tortilla soup that we like better. I did make some minor adjustments to suit our tastes. I like to saute the onions prior to putting them in the soup mixture and I also like to add a can of black beans to the soup to make it a little more hardy. Like others have said, instead of using lemon juice, I use lime.  All in all a great recipe for delicious soup!

Absolutely delicious. My husband is pretty picky and love this soup! I've made this on the stove and also thrown everything in the slow cooker. Either way, delicious and easy. If on the stove top- I boil the chicken, shred it, and throw in a bouillon cube instead of using chicken broth. I also use taco seasoning instead of the cumin, chili powder, etc. Great, super easy recipe!

This was a very good recipe. Based on some other reviews I added a can of rinsed black beans and also threw in a minced jalapeño. Was a little watery so next time I will also add extra corn and peppers.

This is a great soup! I poached the chicken & then added hot sauce. I also added Worcestershire sauce, because I'm British. Came together quickly & was a hit!

This recipe is a great start to something I tweaked a bit. I used more chicken, seasonings, broth, & added 1 can of diced tomatoes with juice, 1 can of black beans rinsed & didn't have frozen corn on hand so I used 1 can that I rinsed as well. Came out fantastic & the hubby loved it as well. I would definitely make it again & recommend!

Turned out to be the best soup ever!  I did make a few changes though.  I cooked the onions with the chicken and garlic.  I also used about a tablespoon of Taco Bell's taco seasoning in addition to the other spices.  Finally, I used the mixed Mexican cheese instead of just Monterrey.  So delicious!!

Great recipe. The only change I did was to sauté the onions and garlic before adding the chicken. Next time I do this, thinking of putting some fresh diced avocado in the bowl and pouring the soup over it.

This tortilla soup was very tasty! I did not have a full cup of salsa, but it was yummy all the same. It would be good with some black beans, avocado, and/or cheddar cheese and sour cream.

This sounded so boring, but had great reviews, so I decided to try it. It was super good! I added the recommended sour cream and Monterey jack. I also think the salsa is really important, make sure to get a salsa you really like, not just any old salsa. Lastly, I actually always have corn tortillas hanging around, mainly because you can only by a pack of 50 or something. I fried 4 up in about 2 tablespoons of olive oil and cut them up for the soup. Yum.

This is a good recipe. The second time I made it with a rotisserie chicken which saved some time. I also used 2 cans of tomatoes with green chilies because I didn't have salsa. I actually liked it better . Thanks for the recipe, I will definitely keep making this!

It turned out super yummy! Except I added carrots and celery to the soup for an added flavor and instead of the salsa it suggested I switched it out with authentic red salsa from a nearby Mexican market!

Great flavors of the Southwest, every ingredient was of the correct amount with the exception if the amount of water required. I added an additional 16 onces and additional chicken broth to cover the entire content of the bowl. Additionally I added 1/4 of avocado (diced) per bowl for taste.

I altered a little by adding Cilantro, which I know some people wouldn't care for .  I found it gave the soup a richer flavor.  I also use fresh corn when available.  I cut the kernels off the cobb and save one cobb with corn to float in the soup.  I also serve the soup with sides of sour cream, avocado's  and tortilla 
strips.

I used the breasts of a rotisserie chicken. I added a can of black beans and a little more garlic, cumin and lemon juice. Served with dried oregano, cut up avocado, green onion, yellow cheese, cilantro for the fixings. Then added the corn chips to each bowl. Add a little sour cream to each bowl if wanted. Had a salad and bread. YUM!

This soup is amazing. I prefer to cook the chicken before hand and shred it so that it is in stringy pieces and not in chunks. So tender that way. I always use the Tostitos chunky medium salsa and it's great but I am trying new salsa this next time. I recommend highly! And so easy to make

I don't normally comment on these but I wanted to thank the girl that mentioned how her husband put everything in the crockpot for 7 hours. We were making this for a lunch for cinco de mayo so started the night before. In the morning I shredded the chicken. It was delicious. I wanted to make a larger quantity so used 3 chicken breasts and increased some of the other ingredients. I used a bag of frozen corn, 32oz broth, a 15 oz jar salsa and so on...

I made this for my family and we loved it. I did make it as some others suggested with taco seasoning and a little chili powder.  I cubed the chicken but next time I think we will shred it. My husband didn't like the tortilla chips in the bottom because they get soggy so on our second bowl we put them on the top and it was still delicious with the crunch!

I've made this dozens of times since I saw this recipe here and thought I'd reviewed it as well but doesn't look like I did.  This is a fabulous recipe and my husband loves it.  It's quick and easy to make which works for lunch or dinner.  I add a tablespoon or two of taco seasoning and some cayenne as my husband likes a bit more zip.  This is his favorite soup of all time so it's a regular on our menu.  Thanks for such a great recipe!!!

Delicious with lime juice as well. I use Adobo seasoning too. Sometimes I add rice. I make it in my crockpot and it comes out great.

This was easy and delicious! I used some leftover cooked chicken - shredded it and simmered in the crock pot for about an hour and a half with the rest of the ingredients. I didn't have tortilla chips so I served it over rice. It was perfect for lunch - can't wait to eat the leftovers!

Personally I think this soup is perfect the way it is. Being a SoCal native, this soup reminds me of home.   My only suggestion is shred the chicken that way it is more authentic.

So much flavor!  I boiled my chicken first and shred it as soon as it was cool enough to handle.  I also used a beer and ale salsa.  I will definitely make it again.

I've made this soup 3 times. Each time tweaking it a little more. I finally found the perfect way my family loves it.
-Don't add corn.
-Use tomato sauce instead of chunky salsa (too chunky and sometimes spicy).
-Chop the onion VERY finely, or leave it in larger strips. 1/2 and onion= 1 cup.
-Add about 1/2 tablespoon of Knorr Suiza. Taste and add more if needed.

The chicken is a little dry when I follow the recipe, next time I will try some of the other reviewers suggestions.

This was a delicious recipe. If you like your soup with more juice (like I do), I would suggest doubling the chicken broth. I boiled my chicken first, shredded it, and then cooked it with the onions, garlic, and cumin before adding any liquids. I also added cayenne spice to make it spicier. Next time I will add black beans and cilantro for garnish. I served this with cornbread muffins. This really stunk up my apartment but it smelled delish!

Loved this soup! I changed the recipe a bit, I added 1 organic zucchini, 3 organic carrots, 1 organic green bell pepper, 1 organic red bell pepper, 1 organic tomato, organic canned black beans, canned corn and 3 regular sized organic garlic cloves. I used a teaspoon of chili powder, 1/2 a teaspoon of cumin and a teaspoon of oregano. Organic low sodium chicken broth 32oz and I had left over pan seared chicken in the fridge from the night before so I just shredded that. I sautéed the onion with the olive oil, green&red bell pepper and added all the spices. I let that sauté for about 3 minutes with stirring occasionally. Then I added the chopped tomato and garlic and let that sauté for about another 2 minutes. Next I added the chicken broth, a cup of chunky salsa, one bay leaf, corn, black beans and the rest of the veggies. Stir everything and let it boil for about 20-25 minutes. Once it was ready I served the soup added the shredded chicken, some shredded Mexican cheese, 4 tortilla chips cut up and avocado! Voila...amazingness!!!

Excellent soup!  I had never eaten a chicken tortilla soup,  but I was looking for something simple and dairy-free that I could make for a friend's family.   I made it for my family first so that I would at least know how it tasted and if it turned out well.  We all LOVED it!  To be honest, the idea of the soup didn't  really appeal to me at first- as i thought it would be incredibly spicy.  I was wrong. I made it with less spice than it called for and realized that it could probably take more. The 2nd time I made it with all the spices  per the original recipe and it was  still on the mild side. We ended up making this recipe 3x within a week!

All of the basic ingredients are here, I just switched up the order/instructions. I had a roast chicken leftover, so I picked that apart. Sautéed the onion and garlic in the olive oil first, then added the corn, sautéed that a bit, then added the spices & salsa. Mixed in the chicken, then added my own homemade chicken broth. I think the homemade broth really, really made it shine! Do yourself a favor and keep some homemade broth around, especially for soups. It's truly the vehicle that drives the other ingredients.

I read a couple of reviews and also tweaked mine a bit.  I boiled the chicken in chicken broth/water with minced garlic and salt and then shredded it.  Then I sweated the onions with garlic and cumin and then combined everything in the pot to simmer.  I also added chopped cilantro and avocado when I served and a zucchini and squash during the last 15 minutes of simmering to add a bit more texture to the dish.  The husband could not stop raving about it all night.  Will definitely be making this recipe again!

This recipe is absolutely delicious as is! Because of my husband's corn allergy, I tripled the recipe, replaced the corn with carrots and let it simmer for 2.5 hours. I also made cilantro lime rice and ladled the soup over the rice in individuals bowls-perfection!

I make it just the way the recipe listed and its an amazing soup. Sometimes I add a can of black beans but only because I like black beans. I also fry my own chips. Just fantastic. :)

This was a very easy recipe and took very little time. When I make it in the future, I will add black beans and some cilantro. A dollop of sour cream would also be good.

Tried this recipe and it was very good, easy and quick.  Great to make for dinner.  Although next time I won't put the tortilla chips in first because they were mushy.  I like mine a bit crunchy so I add them as I eat the soup.

First time trying this it wasn't to bad. I think the salsa we got was a bit to spicy and the chicken needed a bit more pizzazz but once again I just made this real quick. I'd say this recipe is very efficient it just needs some tweaking on my part so I can get it to the taste I like but we'll definitely make it again.

A bit too much liquid to be a good winter (which is really my main reason for making a soup each week, the cold weather) soup. I added rice, I would have added a can of black beans if I had it in my pantry. Next time I'll probably add fresh diced peppers as well. Some sliced avocado & sour cream on top help make it more flavorful and complete. Okay but not my fav chicken tortilla soup recipe.

I did the crockpot method- I put 2 frozen chicken breasts and I did not use oil. Since I was putting this in the crockpot I used half the called for chili powder and cumin. I did not have frozen corn, I used a can of black beans. I also added more chicken broth and salsa. I cooked on low 7 hours and the chicken shredded with a fork before serving. It was very good for a cold day!!!

We loved this.  Even the kids loved it!  I had intended to do the crock pot, but the day got away from me.  It was easy in big soup pan too.  I added more onion and garlic, which was great.  I will certainly make this again!

This was great. It was 4 o'clock and I had chicken breast and not a clue what to do with it. I didn't have salsa so I added a can of diced tomatoes.  I also added a can of black beans. I spiced it up a little bit with half of a fiesta ranch packet. The fam loved it!

I've made this recipe 30 times. Double all the seasonings and add a little more lemon juice and it's amazing. And I do 4 cups of broth. Always a show stopper for guests.

Easy and delicious. Used rotisserie chicken and lime juice and added a can of pinto beans. Started with spices as directed but after tasting upped the cumin to 1/2 tsp and chili powder to 1 1/2 tsp. Consistency was just right with the beans. Thanks!

This is a great recipe for the crock pot. I add everything to the crock pot and in about 4 hours it is perfect. I put the chicken breasts in without cutting them up and when tender shred it. It turns out awesome because the chicken absorbs all the goods flavors from the soup. I leave out the corn but add a cup of diced tomatoes. I like to garnish with cilantro, olives, and jalapenos and of course, cheese and sour cream. I serve it with quessadillas. My family loves it.

This was just bland. Chicken stock and salsa didn't really seem like a good combo, and all the other flavors were just covered up by an overpowering salty chicken stock flavor. The sweetness of the corn was nice, but wasn't near enough to bring all the flavors together. When serving adding tortilla chips that turned to mush, and cheese and sour cream that just melted into the soup giving it nothing but some extra calories, left this dish at 2 stars.

Made this last night and my family loved it. I did add a can of drained black beans per the recommendation of others and used lime instead of lemon juice. The only recommendation my son made was to try to thicken the soup next time. I let it simmer to thicken up but it is still a broth soup and tortilla soup is usually thicker. But I've already been told I should make this again! Very easy to make, I used a crock pot and it was so easy!

Good basic chick tortilla soup recipe.  You can add and subtract as your taste buds wish.  I didn't have any salsa on hand so I used a o14oz can of Mexican flavored chopped tomatoes.  I also increased the cumin a bit and added the fresh cilantro as suggested by one of the other folks.

The can of salsa is the key and makes this sooo easy. I also use a store bought whole roasted chicken for this so it's more flavorful. Add avocado slices, a dollop of sour cream, cheese and tortillas strips and you've got an impressive, easy meal for guests. I usually make cornbread to go along with it.

I just finished making this, following the directions exactly and it is absolutely delicious! I didn't have straight chicken broth so I used bouillon, and I also added a few slices of avocado on top. Fantastic recipe, just as good as a restaurants :)

Super easy, and tastes great! I boiled my chicken breasts in some of the chicken broth, along with semi-creamed onions and garlic first (threw the olive oil in with that), pulled it, then added everything. My family loves it!

This is my go-to recipe. I make this at least once a month and my husband loves it. I stay pretty true to the directions, the only variation I make is stir frying the onions before they go into the soup so they're softer. I also add a can of black beans to give it a little more substance. But, I love how easy and absolutely delicious it is! A staple for me!

Both my husband and I loved this! Very easy. For the salsa i used canned fire roasted style diced tomatoes. I had frozen chicken and cooked it separately then added it when it was ready. I also had celery and cactus/nopal on hand so I added those. Topped with some cheese and avocado, yum.

This soup was definitely a hit with my family. I only thing is the amount of chicken broth it suggests in the recipe is not enough! I had to add about 4 more cups . I also cooked the chicken differently and took the advice from another user and boiled and then shredded the chicken which IS perfect for this soup. I then sautéed the onion and minced garlic and then added the chicken and the seasonings and then everything else. I wasn't sure what salsa to use and I did up using pace lol. It came out amazing! The Monterrey jack cheese on top is wonderful. Another helpful tip I used tri color tortilla strips that I found where you can find croutons in your local grocery store.

I love this recipe! I had frozen chicken breasts so I just boiled them while I was cooking everything else, then I threw in the chicken at the end. Also, I like cream corn so much better than plan whole corn so I used a can of that. I also toasted my own corn tortillas in strips, but I've seen someone not even toast the strips and I guess it turned out great too.

Great Basic Recipe.  Good starting point but even better when enhanced.  I used all the ingredients listed except the chili powder.  I used one pack mild taco seasoning, 1/2 green pepper, 1 can rotel and 1 can of pinto beans to add more depth (plus my husband is from Texas so in our house you must always include pinto beans with any south of the border recipe). I also doubled the salsa. We served it with fritos scoops(on the side), sour cream and cheese.  Was a huge hit!!!

YUMMY! It was so good and tasty! My family loved it a lot. I shredded my chicken instead of cubed, other than that I followed exactly and it was perfect!

I prepared mine in a slow cooker leaving the breasts whole. By the time it is done there is lots of shredded chicken. Once the chicken is shredded out it is more like a chili than a soup. I added cannelini beans this time. The last couple of times I made it I used pinto beans. My kids absolutely love this soup. I gave it five stars because I made it to our taste :)

Love love love this soup. Have made it multiple times. I boil chicken in a separate pan, shred it and then add to soup. I omit salt and usually forget the lime juice. Must crunch up tortilla chips on bottom of bowl and serve soup over it. I add a little shredded cheese on top before serving!

Super easy recipe that comes out perfect every time. If Im super lazy, I'll use canned chicken to cut down on time, but otherwise this recipe goes untouched.

Easy to make since used rotisserie chicken. Doubled cumin and chili powder. Added 1/2 can of black beans. I have a different tortilla soup I prefer so don't know that I'd make again.

Loved it,but I have a big family so I doubled the recipe, added a can of black beans and a can of pinto beans and tripled the cumin and chili powder and put everything in the pot to simmer. I like it without the chips--just a personal preference.

Love this soup, we make it at least twice a month.  Sometimes I add cooked rice or black beans but it is great just the way it is in this recipie too.   Just toss it all together and delicious!

This is a great recipe and very easy to make. I didn't change a thing and it came out great! Even my son who is very picky and doesn't like soup loves this! We've made it several times - always a winner in our house. I threw everything into a crockpot(frozen chicken breasts) except for the chips. Cooked on low for several hours.(My crockpot is old and cooks really hot so I don't use the high setting very often). Took the chicken breasts out about 1/2 hour before serving to shred. Put them back in the crockpot after shredding, gave it a good stir, put the lid on and dinner was ready in 1/2 hour!! So easy and so tasty!! Love this recipe!!!

This soup was delicious! I followed the review of NMR by adding beans and rice. This soup was not just delicious, an added bonus was the fact that it was quick and easy! I used rotisserie chicken in the soup, for an almost no hassle meal, can't complain about that. Serve with sliced avocado on top! (You won't regret it!) and of course add some Tapatio for a little bit of a kick

My family loved it. I added zucchini, potato, celery, chopped cilantro & salt. I also chopped avocado and served as a topper with cheese and sour cream. I also used chicken tenderloins and took them out to shred them when they were done. This is going in my recipe box for sure!

Yum!  This was exactly what I was looking for.  I think the quality of salsa can make or break this recipe.  I used El Sol fresh salsa from Costco (what else are you going to do with a giant container of salsa?) I probably added twice as much salsa as called for.  Because my salsa was garlic heavy, I omitted that from the recipe, but added double of the additional spices because I love cumin and chili powder.  Piggy-backing on another recipe of mine, I used a chopped rotisserie chicken instead of raw, making this a throw together meal in minutes.  I sautéed the onions in a bit of oil until translucent and then added chicken and spices, then the additional ingredients.  I subbed lime for the lemon juice and added it after cooking was complete.  We served it with cheese, sour cream, cilantro, and avocado and tortilla chips.  DELISH!

Very good, fairly easy. Watching the video helped make clear how to do the chicken. I added black beans and stewed tomatoes. I would add more "extras" in the future as I felt that I ended up with a little too much broth. Tastes great with fritos in the bottom and sour cream and cheese on top!

So yummy!!! I did make minor changes, I used three chicken breasts, 1/2 teaspoon of chili powder instead of cumin (I did not have cumin), Lime juice instead of lemon juice, and one can of Mexican corn. This is definitely a new favorite. Thank you for this delicious recipe :)

One more note: I topped with mozzarella cheese, dollop of sour cream, green onion, fresh cilantro, and blue corn tortilla chips (instead of pouring the soup over the chips).

the recipe was easy to follow but i felt it was a bit salty so i added a spoon of sour cream when serving it was really good and decreased the saltiness, next time i will use low sodium chicken broth. 
i made one change to the recipe, i sautéed the onions a bit before adding the stock.

I thought it lacked flavor, so I added a package of mild taco seasoning.

Good recipe, except I added about twice the Cumin, and Garlic, as I like it spicy. Also added Red pepper Flakes.  For a twist, I sliced thin strips of Corn Tortilla, and baked them until crispy and used as a topper rather than the crumbled Tortilla Chips on the bottom.

The lemon juice and onions were overpowering.  I had to scoop out half the onions so my kids would even attempt to eat it.  I wish I read the review about replacing the lemon with lime juice to see if that would have been better.  Gonna look for another recipe.

Easy and delicious.  I used a salsa that was not chunky- just personal preference.  Left out the corn as well.  So good!  My family of 5 all love this!

The whole family loved this!  I increased the ingredients as needed because I had three chicken breasts.  I poached them first, then cooled/shredded them.  I then sauteed the onion and garlic in the pot, then added everything else.  I used a lot more chicken broth because I didn't want it to be thick (just eyeballed it).  I also substituted lime for the lemon, though.  It was sooooo yummy!!

I followed the recipe, but to really top it off, after you add the cheese put some finely shredded lettuce on top. It adds an extra texture and crutch.

Like most people I felt that this recipe was helpful, but needed to be slightly revised. I boiled the chicken strips then shredded them. I also sautéed the garlic and onion in a little if the chicken broth so they would be soft. I also added black beans bc I like them. It turned out great. I ate until I couldn't handle anymore and I can't wait to have some for lunch tomorrow. Thank you for the recipe it will certainly be added to my list!

On the video, at 1:58 it says to add 2 29 oz cans chicken broth. The recipe calls for 2 14. oz cans of chicken broth.

Good recipe. I followed NMR's review, added more broth and beans. Next time I think I'd add a bit of hot sauce to give it a little more kick.

Really good!  I made it quick with chicken cut off a leftover roasted grocery chicken.  Added a 21 oz can of Bush's Grillin' Beans - "Black Bean Fiesta" because I had no corn or black beans on hand. The Bush' beans had chipotle sause in it so I left out the salsa too.  I put in everything else in the recipe: broth, sauted onions, spices etc.  Like I said, really quick!  Topped with fresh avacado chunks, grated cheddar, sour cream, and fresh cilantro.  OMG heaven!

This has become one of the go-to recipes in my kitchen for a quick and flavorful dinner.  The recipe is delicious as written, but my personal "tweaks" include adding one can of drained great northern beans, substituting a can of fire-roasted, salsa style tomatoes in place of the salsa, and omitting the onions.  Several reviewers have commented about the directions for cooking the chicken - I simply cooked it in the soup pot with the olive oil until done, then added the spices and remaining ingredients.  Thanks for a keeper!

I have made this at least 10 times in the last year. Introduce it to anyone who will listen. Haven't had anyone not love it yet. Just fine as is. I often add more vegetables and a bit more salsa. ChiChi's Thick n' Chunky is the salsa I like to use. Medium for a kick, but still good with mild.

Everyone enjoyed this soup.  My 14 year old said, "This is the best soup I've ever had". I made it pretty true to the original recipe however I boiled the chicken breasts in some garlic and cumin and a little chicken bouillon  instead of sauteing them.  Then I cut them into chunks and sauted with garlic and cumin.

I only gave thus four stars because the chicken is best if you oook it in a crockpot all day and then shred it. It adds more flavor to the soup. I also added some hot peppers to spice it up and I think black beans are a must in tortilla soup.

I've made this soup several times now and when I am pressed for time, I pick up and use the meat from a rotisserie chicken, throw all the ingredients in. I like to use fresh corn instead of canned and a squeeze of real lime juice over the serving bowl. I will use tortilla chips crunched up and set out in a small bowl for people to use if they want to. Other small bowls contain the shredded cheese, green onions slices, sour cream, etc. I have taken this to my Spanish class and they all wanted the recipe. It may or may not be totally authentic, but it is tasty and filling. I really appreciate how easy it is to throw together. Great recipe!

This was great! I made as the recipe stated except for adding some dark meat in addition to the chicken breasts just to make it meatier. I'll have to try some of the ideas from the reviews- like black beans and cilantro. The recipe is great as is though.

This was incredibly good. So good that I could not stop at just a little taste test. Basically just followed the directions. Next time I'll try the black beans that others mentioned. And the slow cooker angle sounds interesting too.

This is an incredible recipe; it's simple and super delicious.  I've tried it with uncooked chicken cut in cubes, but the best is shredding cooked roasted chicken.

DELISH! Made a few tweaks... I added A can of rinsed black beans, I sauteed the finely chopped onion with the chicken. I also added Cholula Chipotle Hot sauce for a little smokiness and substituted fresh squeezed lime juice. I also added a can of drained petite diced tomato as well as the salsa and ramped up the garlic! Very easy and very very tasty soup to not only warm your bones on a chilly day but the flavors were spot on!

This recipe is great!  I'm a busy mom so I was able to throw everything in the crockpot (chicken was still frozen!) and have a yummy dinner ready for the whole family in the evening. I'm not very adventurous so I didn't change anything. It wasn't spicy at all, but had a delicious flavor.

It was easy and it had good flavor but I cooked it a little longer so the onions would be more tender.  Next time I will sautee the onions first.  This recipe is a good starting point though.

This is a really delicious, easy recipe.  Since I'm a lazy cook, I don't follow the directions exactly.  I throw everything into a slow cooker (including frozen chicken breast).  Once the chicken breast is cooked, I pull it with a fork, then return it to the crock pot.  Great recipe for a busy day when I don't have a lot of time to cook.  You can also substitute hominy for the corn.

Super easy and very cheap to make!  I made it in the crockpot with only one change: I just stuck the chicken breasts in whole and uncooked.  I shredded them with a fork after 4 hours on high.  It was so tender!  There was more juice in it from the slow cooker, but I didn't mind. I've also made it in the pot like the recipe says, but added a can of black beans.  Also a good idea! :)

I didn't have any salsa so I just added a can of diced tomatoes, extra chili powder, and some cayenne pepper. It's very simple if you already have leftover chicken. I just cut it up, put it in the pot with some oil, cumin (way more than the recipe called for) and onion, added chicken broth (also way more than asked for) and corn. Done putting it all together in about 10 minutes...now just wait for the corn to cook. If I had more time I would have found more things to add, like black beans or black olives. Not bad for a last minute meal.

I did not use the exact ingredients. I used diced tomatoes with green chilis instead of salsa. Topped with fresh celantro, green onions, and tablespoon of sour cream.  All in all good receipe.

I used this recipe as a guideline. I added a can of black beans and served over rice. It was better than Qdoba's Mexican Gumbo (which I freaking love)!

Husband liked this...used medium salsa....not too spicy.  Substituted  12.5 oz canned chicken, one 11 oz. can Mexicorn, 1/2 cup onion then added 1/2 can low sodium black beans, 3 oz. tomato paste to thicken and add a little more flavor.  Followed measurements in rest of recipe.  Simple and fast.  It's a keeper for us.

This chicken tortilla soup has a great flavor, but I do admit that I have to tweak it a bit for my liking. I prefer to use shredded chicken rather than cubes of chicken, for both texture and presentation. Also, I use 3 cans of chicken broth, a whole can of corn and add a can of black beans to make it heartier and last longer. Next time I might even try to put it in the blender for a few seconds to make it smoother and thicker. I leave out the cheese and sour cream because of a milk allergy, and instead top it with crushed tortilla chips and fresh avocado slices. A great dish for a cold night!

I used all the ingredients listed in this recipe plus added a few of my own and it came out excellent.  I first used a rotisserie chicken to save time and it offers much more flavor. I added a can of black beans;rinsed, a can of Rotel tomatoes with green chilies and a 1" wedge of Velveeta cheese and a little flour to thicken the soup. I cut up flour tortillas into 1"  strips and deep fried them at medium high heat in a frying pan with just enough oil to cover them. they brown very quickly.  Serve the strips over the soup and add a dollop of sour cream and guacamole and your in heaven.

This was so yummy! I used half vegetable broth as I already had a carton of it open and then used chicken broth. I did add probably a cup or so more broth then needed and that was just perfect.  Less would have not been enough in my opinion. For some reason it kind of reminded me of french onion soup (the flavor of the broth), maybe it was the onions and cheese.  I just wish I had black beans just to make it that much healthier and filling.  I will be making it again.

Great recipe.  I just put the uncooked chicken in a crock pot with all the other ingredients, and shred it towards the end.  I also add a can of black beans, and put fresh cilantro on top.  Mmm mmm good.

As others suggested I shredded the chicken, added black beans, and substituted lime for lemon. I used 3 cans of Rotel diced tomatoes w/green chilies and 1/3 can of chipotle peppers in adobo sauce instead of the salsa. Ladled over the (store bought) tortilla strips and garnished with shredded Mexican cheese, sliced black olives, chopped green onions, sliced avocado and sour cream. Great presentation and delicious taste. A real hit.

Delicious! People have really good advice here. I added black beans and cilantro and used lime instead of lemon juice like everyone said. Also added extra chili powder to make it spicier. Made it for a big church group and it was a big hit!

makes 4 very small servings. Definitely double. Increase garlic and spices and add 1 cup of black beans to make it more of a meal. Also add a jalapeno for more heat

I thought this recipe was easy to follow.  It did not take long.  I added an avocado to the ingredient's and used my own homemade salsa.  Will be making this again during the cold winter.

Used a rotisserie chciken so I doubled the recipe.  It was very bland at the end- I'm amazed it has SO many rave reviews.  I added a can of rinsed black beans, a package of taco seasoning and some fresh cilantro at the end and it was so much better- 4 stars.  It might earn that 5th star topped with chips sour cream and cheese.  I was trying to keep it healthy though!

Made this recipe for a soup night with a large group of friends.  I tripled the recipe and used twice as much chicken broth as the recipe called for.  I boiled the chicken breasts in some chicken broth, then shredded the meat, before making the soup.  I also substitued the lemon juice for fresh lime juice, increased the chili powder to twice the amount called for and put the salsa in the blender, so the soup wouldn't be so chunky.  I used corn tortillas, cut them into small strips and fried them in some oil, this really made a difference in flavor for the garnish!  I also topped the soup with some chopped green onions and shredded cheese- my friend's loved it!

Very good basic recipe. I used a quarter of a leftover rotisserie chicken, so I put in the leftover bones and chicken with the skin on in there and let it simmer for an hour. I also added a dollop or two of sour cream when the soup cooled down a little.

Not the best chicken tortilla soup I've ever had. The broth was pretty thin. I think it is a bad idea to pre-cook the chicken because it just ends up tasting bland and the big chunks were awkward to eat. It would be much better to cook thigh pieces in the broth or add shredded rotisserie chicken. The big chunks didn't really work. Also, I think the amount of broth needs to be quadrupled. I found myself needing to add more water, salsa, and chicken bouillon to cover the ingredients. I have eaten most of it (not much other food around) but if I were to eat the rest of it, I would need to make more broth.

This recipe is a great and simple recipe that can be altered to your tastes. I made the following changes and it came out great: First I boiled one large chicken breast and two leg quarters and I added garlic powder, onion powder, salt, and pepper to create a broth.I let that boil until the chicken was cooked. I took the chicken out (saved the broth) and shredded the chicken, then followed the directions and added everything back to the broth that I created instead  and added black beans. I also had leftover soft tortilla shells so I preheated the oven to 400, cut the shells into strips, placed the strips on a cookie sheet,brushed then with oilve oil and sprinkled them with garlic & onion powders and placed into the oven for 7-10 minutes. These are amazing and addicting, I added them to the soup and it was wonderful.

It's a good thing that I decided to double this because my mom said it was the best soup she'd ever had! I doubled the cumin to match the amount of chili powder. Since I'm not a big fan of chunks of peppers I pureed the salsa before adding it and I think it really helped distribute the flavors more evenly. Rather than browning the chicken I brought the broth, onion, garlic and spices to a boil and then added the chicken and let it simmer for a bit before adding everything else. This was so good I had to make another batch for company the next day!

As stated, a GREAT jumping-off point and a fantastic way to use up leftovers! I used 1-32 oz box chicken stock, leftover turkey thigh meat (several handfuls), 2 C frozen corn, a small red pepper and 1/4 sweet onion. I nixed the garlic and forgot the salsa, subbed lime juice for lemon, added a good soup-spoonful of sour cream and a nice heap of shredded Cheddar on top of that.  The spices seemed weak (I did use more stock than the recipe called for), but there's another couple of servings left over and I'm adding the salsa before I mess with the spices. Oh, I did add some oregano. And...I made the whole thing in the microwave!  Cooked the frozen corn with the red pepper, and cooked the onion after that. Then I just stirred everything into the broth and heated it all up. I also made chips in my toaster oven, from corn tortillas (hey, I said I was using leftovers!) and served them on the side.  This is going into my file for sure! Thanks, Betty!

Super easy!  Delicious!  Followed the recipe exactly.  There was only 1 time I made a change.  I didn't have enough broth, so I made up the difference with chicken bouillon.  It tasted just as good.

Oh wow! Delicious!!! Olive oil isn't necessary, we used the oil we had at the time -which happened to be corn oil. We also left out cumin and added season all. EXCELLENT dish! A 40 minute dish that tastes like it was in the crock pot all day is always ok in my book!!

This is a great basic recipe and after reading  other reviews I added rinsed black beans, cilantro, and more cumin and chili powder. I also poached the chicken and shredded it before-hand.

Love this recipe! I would suggest using less onion, around 1/2 a cup. I also like adding more corn, maybe 2 cups. You can add any other ingredients you'd like, noodles are a great addition!

Very tasty.  I used roasted chicken from Costco and just shredded it.  I also doubled the ingredients as the one profiled doesn't make much.  We added the chips at the end, as well as a little scoop of sour cream in each bowl.

I would have given it 5 stars if I hadn't have added a few things and greatly increased the amount of broth, which seemed to be way off. I took a reviewer's advice and used Embasa salsa but I added 2 cans instead of 1. I also added a can of rinsed black beans and I doubled the amount of chili pepper and tripled the amount of cumin. We like a bit of kick around here. 60oz of chicken broth is what it seemed to take, in my opinion. It's a great recipe to use as a starting off point. You just need to adjust it to your liking. I definitely recommend this soup topped with sour cream.  This recipe will definitely be in my recipe rotation from now on. One last note... I cooked and shredded my chicken prior to assembling the soup.

I made some adjustments based on what I had in the house.  I doubled the recipe and in addition to the corn, I added a can of hominy and a can of black beans.  I used a low sodium packet of taco seasonings so I didn't have to fuss measuring spices out.  I didn't have any salsa so I added 1 cup of bloody mary mix and diluted that with 1 cup of water.  Gave it a nice kick.  I poached my chicken breasts in water instead of adding them to the onions and oil.  Cubed the chicken after it was cooked and added it to the soup.  Served with green onions, avocado slices , sour cream, cheese and tortilla strips.  Thanks Betty !!

Delicious! I used fresh salsa (which I would highly recommend as this is where the majority of your flavor comes from) and threw all of the ingredients in the crock pot and let it cook all day.  My kids put the Monterey Jack cheese on top but I left it off to save some fat and calories.  Either way, this is is a fabulous recipe.

Very good soup.  I make this every fall/winter and it is a huge hit with my entire family.  I usually poach the chicken which not only makes it very tender but also gives you your chicken broth.  I also add black beans (YUM) and sometimes add cream of chicken soup in order to thicken it up more.  Overall this is a really great recipe.

I was a little concerned about this recipe, but it turned out to be excellent.  I accidentally forgot to put in the lemon.  We topped it with tortilla chips, sour cream and avacadoes.  The avacadoes were a great addition.  Oh, and I also used fresh corn because I had it on hand.

One of our faves. Poach chicken in broth.  Sautee the onions and garlic in butter/olive oil mix.  Salsa yes, but also try about 1/2c pico de gallo. Add 1/2 can drained/rinsed black beans.  Lime instead of lemon juice.  Add more broth as needed.

OMG! I made this recipe for the first time tonight! I did everything the same but instead of putting salsa(because that sounds weird in soup) I used one can of diced tomatoes with green chiles in it. I also made my own tortilla chip strips by cutting up taco shells and frying them in oil. It was the best tortilla soup i have ever had, even better then restaurants. My brother even told me i should make it every week from now on. I am making it again next Wednesday and im doubling the batch so we can have it for two nights! I can't wait!

This is one of my favorite rainy-day soups. But when making this for my family, I always grill the chicken with a dry bbq rub on it. This gives the soup a wonderful smokey flavor. I usually add more cumin and garlic (letting it simmer right in the broth) and love adding black beans! Love this soup!

Amazing soup!  Chicken tortilla soup has always been my favorite, so I have probably tried 7 or 8 different recipes over the years.  This is my favorite by far!  I've decided that my search is over!  When I'm trying to be more healthy, I leave out the chips and the cheese.  The soup has a wonderful flavor on its own.  I do add a full jar of salsa, though.  I love very spicy foods, so I want it more spicy, I add a hot salsa.  If I'm making it for others, I use medium salsa.  I also always boil the chicken a shred it for this recipe.  I enjoy it shredded much more.

This was Delicious and so easy to make. I had some really good tortilla soup a few months ago and i have been trying to find a recipe like it. This is SO much better. I made a few changes. I boiled the chicken and shredded it. I sauteed onions, garlic, and a couple little sweet red peppers. Used "Better than Bouillon" instead of the broth. Added black beans, hot salsa and cilantro and left the cumin and chili powder out because i didnt have any. Such an awesome way to use up stale tortilla chips!!

My roommate is vegan, so I altered the recipe to better fit us, and it still worked out perfectly!  Instead of chicken and chicken broth I used seitan and vegetable broth, I used one medium sized jalapeno pepper and just a dash of chili powder, and added two avocados cubed along with the original recipe minus the chunky salsa.

The only reason that I gave this recipe 4 stars, as people have mentioned in earlier reviews, is because it is vague. But I sauted the seitan with the garlic and onion for about 3 mins, and then let the rest of the items simmer in the vegetable broth for about 20 mins, and it turned out awesome!

This is the recipe that finally got me to register for an account so I could post a review.  So delicious!

I used NMR's suggestion to poach the chicken first, then shred it and add to sauteed onion/garlic and combine with rest of ingredients.  

I used Pacific Chicken Broth (32 oz) and a jar of Spikes Medium All Natural Chunky Salsa (16 oz).  I also followed suggestions to use lime instead of lemon juice.  Other than that, I followed all the directions.  Oh, and in addition to the tortilla chips, sour cream, and cheese, I added a handful of shredded lettuce on top.  Yum!

Spicy, tangy, and otherwise just delicious... and hearty!  BF went back for seconds :)

Threw into the crock pot for about three hours on low (the chicken was already cooked and shredded from the previous night's dinner). I wasn't expecting much, but it was absolutely delicious!

This recipe is amazing. I have made it a few times, and it is always a huge hit.  LOVE it!  I do add white rice and sour cream to each individual bowl and its phenomenal. Highly recommend this recipe.  I also do suggest doubling it.  The 4 serving size hardly fed me and my husband.  I think it barely gave us each 2 bowls.

Great recipe!  I've had chicken tortilla soup in restuarants and always wanted to try making it.  It was simple to make.  I did pre-cook the chicken and then used the broth from that along with one can of chicken broth.  I sauted the cooked cut-up chicken with the cumin, garlic, and onion before adding the rest of the ingrediants.  Thanks for making this recipe available.

One of the best broth-based soups I've tasted. I used a whole bag of frozen sweet corn and one can of rinsed black beans. I also used a jar of hot chunky salsa to add heat. I also used lime juice instead of lemon juice. Everyone loved it!

Used canned corn, Chi-Chi's Salsa, and baked the chips. Added an extra chicken breast that I boiled with a couple garlic cloves and cut up. I have never had chicken tortilla soup, and all I can say is that this is the best soup I have made in my life!! Very, very, very tasty. Thanks!

Fantastic soup!  I used vegetable broth, three chicken breast, half shallots and half green onion.  My family loved it.

I use leftover roasted chicken in this recipe. I make a few alterations, but it's a delicious base for a soup.

I loved this recipe!  I browned the chicken in a pot with the olive oil, removed the chicken, added in the onions and garlic.  After sauteing a few minutes, I added all the other ingredients (including a drained can of pinto beans.)  I shredded the chicken and added it back in.  Delicious!  I used store-bought tortilla chips, but next time, I plan to bake my own.  I loved it!  It was exactly what I was craving!

Yum!  Easy, easy recipe.  Made my own broth, had a carcass left over.  But really good & my kids loved it.  Going into regular rotation.  Uses everything that I always have on hand.  Warmed flour tortillas to sop-up the bottom of the bowl.

This was delicious! I baked up some corn tortillas in the oven to cut the fat out of regular tortilla chips, and crumbled those into the bottom of the soup bowl. Make sure you put the chips in the bottom of the bowl before you pour in the soup; the chips will soak up the soup broth nicely and the soup will thicken up. If you don't want to have to cook the chicken breasts, you can use 2 cans of shredded chicken instead.

Very good soup!  The ingredients are simple and the whole process was pretty easy.  The end results were great!  I boiled the chicken first, shredded it and then picked up where the recipe stated the instructions on how to cook the soup.  I accidentley put 1 tsp of cumin instead of 1/4 tsp, but it turned out good.  Although the end results were good, I think the soup could have used a little more punch to it!  Overall, easy, simple, and good. It's a keeper in my book.

This was really good- I did add a can of black beans to stretch it a bit, and did use lime juice instead of lemon... other than that followed the recipe exactly. Turned out great. I think I prefer it without the tortillas.. not a fan of mushy tortillas- will leave them off of mine next time, but the men in the family really liked them.

I loved this recipe but tweaked it a little bit. I added a full bag of frozen corn, a small spoonful of the onion (next time using onion powder), added several dashes of lime juice, dashes of fajita seasoning, and 1/2 a potato cut into cubes.  I also got nervous about just sauteing because it wasn't cooking through so I boiled the soup for about 15 minutes then removed the chicken and shredded it with a fork before returning it to the soup. Once the soup was finished, I put a sprinkle of shredded cheese on top of the tortillas in the bottom of the bowl before pouring soup on it.  So yummy!

Wonderful and easy recipes.  I made this for company and adults and kids alike loved it!  I was also asked for the recipes.  I just used plain old Pace for my salsa and it was excellent.  For the chicken, I used chicken breasts that I had baked and shredded.

Excellent!  I baked my chicken then shredded it and added to the soup.  It was so easy to make and enjoyed by all!  Thanks for sharing!

I made this as the recipe said.  The only extra thing that I added was a little cayenne to spice it up.  For a garnish I put on a dab of sour cream and cilantro as well.  4/4 people liked it!

This soup was really easy to make and turned out delicious!  I used leftover rotisserie chicken that I hand-shredded.  I put that aside as I sauteed the onions and then added all of the spices and lemon juice first, then the chicken, stirred and then the chicken broth and salsa.  In the future I'll add an additional can of chicken broth (and I used low-sodium) and up the spices just a touch to compensate.

We LOVE this recipe. I always make it when I've made chicken, pork or beef the night before. I just use whatever meat leftovers we have and it tastes fantastic. Enjoy

Update, we decided we didn't like the beef in it, but left over turkey was amazing. I've also added additional broth. Tonight was a double batch:

Roughly 3 cups of cut up turkey
12 cups of chicken broth
a small bag of petite frozen corn
2 jars of chunky mild salsa
then doubled the rest of the ingredients....we can't get enough!!!

I sauteed the onion and garlic in the olive oil then added the remaining ingredients which included a can of chunk chicken which I shredded. I subbed lime juice for lemon and added a can of black beans which were drained and rinsed. Served with some sour cream also. We really enjoyed the simplicity of this soup and it tasted delicious. Could've used a little more spiciness, but overall very good.

This was really good and I will definitely make it again.  I thought the tomato flavor was a bit too strong for my taste and even the mild salsa I used caused it to be spicier than my kids will eat, so I added about a half can of cream of chicken soup to tone it down a bit.  This made it creamier and I liked it much better.  Like others, I also used lime juice instead of lemon juice and I think this gave it a better flavor than lemon juice would have.  My husband and two daughters (including my 20-month-old) really enjoyed this soup.

This is the BEST tortilla soup. I make it exactly as the recipe says, just adding 2 more cans of chicken broth. This soup is a Christmas Eve tradition at our house. We serve tamales and con queso with chips-instant Christmas fiesta! The beauty is the soup is so easy, you can enjoy your guests.

This recipe is a great hearty soup in the winter! I did tweak it a little however... I used 2C. of chicken broth and 1 can of corn.  I also added some cilantro and a small can of diced green chiles. adds a little to that southwest flavor! Definitely top it with a dollop of sour cream, a sprinkle of shredded cheese and some tortilla chips! turned out great :)

I was looking for a restaurant-quality chicken tortilla soup and I think I finally found it! I doubled the chili powder and matched it with ancho chili pepper. I found that adding some chipotle peppers and liquid smoke gave the soup a very smokey-savory flavor. Great soup! We will be having this soup again for sure!

This is a great recipe. I had a craving for this and your recipe came through. I used lime juice instead of lemon, I used purple onion. I also diced an avacado and put it in the bowl on the chips. Turned out great!!!! Thanks

This was wonderfully yummy.  Football Saturday and we didn't want chili AGAIN.  Happened across this and we all loved it.  I doubled the recipe and added a can of rinsed black beans.  Also, I prepared Mexican frying cheese and they crew went nuts.  It will definitely be a repeated soup at our house.

This is delicous and easy to make if you use a crockpot.  I put the liquid and spices in the crockpot, add 2 frozen chicken breast and set for about 4-5 hours.  (Our crockpot is dark and cooks quickly)  When the chicken is done I take it out and sread it, add it back in with a can of black beans and the corn.  I serve it with fried tortilla strips and it is always a hit.  Thank you for this great recipe.

Add a can of green chiles and some black beans.  I cooked frozen chicken breasts in the crock pot for a few hours then added the rest of the ingredients and let it simmer for about 4 hours.  I shredded the chicken just before serving and added it back to the mix.  Very tasty.

My sister made this for my baby shower and it was the first soup to disappear! I loved it! When I made it later at home for my husband, I did make a few changes based on what we had on hand: I used homemade salsa with nice huge chunks and shredded chicken. I added more chicken broth and some black beans (have used pinto, too) that were not from a can, since I knew my husband would need more in his soup. We've also added diced chilies and roasted sweet red bell pepper with great results. Very good soup as is, and versatile enough to be great with any changes you make.

This soup was excellent.  I made mine in the crockpot.  I followed the entire recipe except I used lime rather than lemon juice.  I increased the chili and cumin powder.  I feel like it needs another vegetable (maybe chopped tomatos) or beans- onions were not enough and my salsa melted down with the cooking.  Very very good!

Made this yesterday changed serving size to 24 fedmy family of six with just enough leftover for me and the baby today. This was fantastic just enough spice to taste good but not too much for the children. It's quick and easy and super tasty. Great for a cool autumn day. Thanks for sharing

cooked the chicken using the salsa chicken recipe on this site.  Then just put into the pot with the broth, corn, garlic and more salsa and added the chips when done.  My son doesn't like onion and it was still good without it.  Also didn't have lemon juice.  It was excellent!

My husband and I love this soup.  I cut the amount of onion to about a 1/3 of a cup and sautéed it adding  garlic, diced rotisserie chicken breast and the remaining ingredients.   I tried a couple of different salsas but my favorite so far for this soup is Pace Medium Chunky salsa.

A very tasty soup!  I cut the chicken into pieces prior to sauteing and added canned black beans near the end.  Add the seasonings to the chicken for better flavor.  For my taste, it needed more garlic. Some pickled jalapenos added some heat. A good squeeze of lime juice helped point the flavors in the soup. I didn't have Monterey Jack cheese, so I used Velveeta, which was also good.  I served green onions,crushed tortillas, shredded cheese and sour cream as toppings on the side. A very tasty soup!

Quick, easy and delicious. I do make another recipe for Chicken Tortilla Soup that I like better, but it uses more ingredients, and can be a pain in the butt to make. This recipe is easy to make, and fairly cheap. Enjoy!

I love this recipe and make it regularly with rotisserie chicken from the grocery store.  This is even better with the mexican style tomatoes with cilantro and a can of green chilies.

Great recipe! Made this for my parents and they loved it.  I did add extra corn, onion, and salsa, and also added a can of black beans.  Definitely shred the chicken, the smaller the better. You can also use a rotisserie chicken and eliminate the 5 minutes of sauteeing step. Will make this again!

I love this soup. I modified it into a vegetarian soup by using vegetable broth instead of chicken broth. I throw all the ingredients except the chicken in a big pot and let it simmer awhile. I either omit the onion or saute it first. I add black beans for a protein source. Then I take out just enough soup for me and put it in a smaller pot. I cook some chicken while the soup is simmering, cut it up and add it to the bigger pot for other members of my family who aren't vegetarians. We put tortilla strips, avocado, cheese and/or sour cream on top. It is one of my favorite and easiest meals.

This recipe is AWESOME! It is so easy to make and it tastes very yummy! I make mine in the slow cooker all day. First I brown my chicken on either side for a few minutes then add it in to the mixture.  About a half hour before serving, I shred the chicken.  When I serve it, I add some avocado slices! Yummy!

This was a huge hit! I was skeptical given how simple it looked but everyone asked me to please make it again. Only changes I made were to double the recipe and boil the chicken breasts to keep them moist. Doubled the garlic, chili powder and used a medium hot salsa. Thanks for a simple yet delicious recipe!

This was absolutely delicious for the amount of time put into it. I have another recipe I have always used that I love but tried this one that seemed simpler. This was amazing.

Yum!  This was really easy.  I added a can of black beans (drained and rinsed) and I think that was a nice addition.  Added a little more spice because I think the salsa I used may have been too bland.  It doesn't say in the recipe to shred the chicken (assuming that's implied...ha) so I went ahead and did that.  Will definitely make this again!

Amazingly good.  The tortillas are definately a must.  I was amazed at how much flavor they added to the soup.  Be sure to double the recipe.  You'll need to!

Works great for a family of five. takes a little time. the results are worth it. I add less salsa and broth then requires. I have made this many time so I know just how much liquid my family like in the soup. I also adjust the servings on every recipe that needs it so I don't make to much or to little for the family. I also add a can of drain black bean to the soup.

A really nice soup! It wasn't too salty, or too "sweet". My family and I thought it was great. Will definitely make again! Also, I recommend adding a little more broth to it, though.

This recipe was amazing, so easy and quick!  I made a few changes, I used 1 chicken breast instead of two and put a 14oz. can of kidney beans in there(cheaper but was really yummy;))Then I also added 3 pickled  jalapeno peppers in there.  Next time I think I will shred the chicken too!  Great recipe, I didn't have to buy anything except for the chips...LOVE recipes like that:) Thanks

Very good!  I used tomato puree and Chipotle Tabasco instead of chunky salsa (didn't have any).  My hubby LOVED it and declared that I must add it to the regular dinner rotation.

I thought this tasted great. I've tried several tortilla soup recipes, and this is the best. It's the salsa that makes all the difference. I used a 10oz can of chicken breast just to make it easier on me. Will make again.

Wonderful, easy recipe.  I have used pre-cooked chicken/turkey, doubled the recipe, and added a couple of cans of black beans.  This recipe is also great for the slow cooker.  Just throw in all the ingredients (meat pre-cooked) and let it go.  Very tasty!

3.5 stars for flavor and 4 stars for an easier preparation than my other favorite chicken soups.  I used low sodium chicken broth which I think caused the lack of flavor. Next time I'll try to add some garlic salt to see if that helps. I poached the chicken before shredding and putting in soup. Made homemade tortilla chips which were great in soup!

This is a very, very good recipe. However, I did make a few changes. I sauteed the chicken for a total of about 15 minutes, removed from heat, and shredded it. I placed it back into the pot and followed the recipe for the rest. Recipe changes: I used 1 tsp. minced garlic, 2 cups of salsa, 1 tbsp. onion powder, 1 tbsp. granulated garlic, and 1 tbsp. dried cilantro. I also used 1 tsp. of chili powder instead of 1/2, and instead of frozen corn I used 1 can of sweet corn. I also added black beans like some others suggested. I let all of that simmer on medium-low heat for 45 minutes. To serve I spooned the soup into a bowl, crushed tortillas over top, and topped with cheese, and stirred until melted. I love this recipe! And my mother, who loves to criticize my cooking, said nothing but good things about it.

I thought this recipe was okay, but nothing amazing. To me it tasted too much like canned salsa. I was looking for something a little more authentic tasting. If I make it again, I'll definitely try using a homemade salsa instead.

This is the BEST soup. And so easy if you go pick up a already made rotisserie chicken from the market. just shred the meat in the pot and add the rest of the ingredients. Add some black beans and top it with cheese,crushed tortillas, sour cream and pico de gallo. It's delicous and is defintely a full meal! Try this!!!!

This has become one of our family's favorite meals. It's super easy to make, and even our super picky five year old asks for seconds. We only do a couple of things differently. We use twice the amount of salsa and we add an extra can of chicken broth. Sometimes we add a can of black beans.... Mmmm Delish!

This is simple and good. I used left over chicken that was already shredded. I also added some rice to the soup. You can add tons of things and customize the recipe to your liking. I'd like to make it again for sure.

Incredible...I substituted lime for lemon here like I read in a review, added a few dashes of tabasco for a little extra heat and it was restaurant quality. Couldn't get enough!

This soup is awesome!  The first time I tried it, I made it with my homemade salsa-it was great!  The second time, with jar salsa-very good, but not as great.  I would recommend either making it with fresh salsa, or the freshest store bought refrigerated salsa.  It makes a difference.  I also added more corn to my liking and a can of drained and rinsed black beans.  Very delicious!

Just made this soup for dinner and it was great!  I also boiled the chicken first and then drained, adding olive oil to the pan and cooking briefly with the garlic and cumin.  Very tasty and easy!

I made this last night, and made only a couple of modifications recommended by reviewers.  I sauteed the breasts whole along with the onions, just until the outsides were cooked, then added the rest of the ingredients and let the soup cook for nearly an hour, adding more chicken broth if the soup didn't cover the chicken.  Also, I used 1/8 tsp. garlic powder instead of the garlic.  Once it was done, I pulled out the chicken and shredded it.  My family LOVED this, I wish I had doubled the recipe, it is definitely going in the recipe box.

Good, hearty dinner. Very easy. I used mexicali corn, green chilies, and precooked, leftover rice. It was excellent. Serve it up with some sour cream and melted cheese on top and crushed tortillas for a great meal. I'll do this one again.

Very yummy, super easy tortillas soup!  I use shredded deli rotisserie chicken just to make it easier (rather than raw).  I also add a can of black beans.  Very good comfort food!

This was the perfect dish after a day of snowboarding!  Instead of sauteing the chicken in oil, I halved them and let it simmer in the chicken broth until it was fully cooked.  While that cooled on a cutting board, I sauteed the onions in a little butter and added in the garlic and cumin.  Then I finished the broth by adding all the veggies, lemon juice and salsa, used more corn than called for and added kidney beans.  Shredded the chicken breasts with a fork and added back to the broth.  I did add a little salt because I used organic tortilla chips and also put the chips on top because they get soggy underneath.  Topped with sour cream and served rice on the side, but everyone added it into the soup - it made it heartier :) Overall a great recipe and only made minor changes.  Will definitely make it again!

Good base recipe, I completely changed it. I add red enchilada sauce instead of salsa, add 4 cloves garlic, cayenne instead of chili powder, I also add a chopped zucchini, some chopped cabbage and use lime instead of lemon. DELICIOUS!!!!

I loved the flavor - but I wish the recipe was clear on what to do with the chicken.  I ended up cutting the raw chicken into small cubes before starting and then following the directions from there.  I think this would have been MUCH better with shredded chicken but I don't know when to shred it :( I've never made soup with shredded chicken before!

If I would've known it was this easy to make homemade chicken tortilla soup, I would've done it a LONG time ago! It's absolutely DELICIOUS and filling too. I shredded the chicken, and used more broth to accomodate the amount of meat. I also added black beans for more substance, in addition to adding more corn than the recipe calls for.

Yummy, easy, & healthy!  I did the crockpot method with aprehension but am now glad I chose to do so. I added the chicken in as whole breast and took them out about an hour before to allow to cool then shred.  I think the chips are better served on the side so they do not get soggy.  I also served with sour cream (yum-yum), shredded cheese, and avacado.  Leftovers are even better!

I think this recipe is great.  The only thing I would add is a diced avocado.  It makes it just as good as any you get at a restaurant.  Quick and easy, no big mess and great soup.

Really really good!  I did make changes that a few others have mentioned.  I boiled the chicken in broth instead of sauteing it.  I did however saute the onion and garlic to get it cooked a little more.  It was super easy and both my husband and I wished I had made more.

Oh my goodness...so delicious!! Easy and quick to make. I twicked it a bit by adding a little more chili powder, a little more garlic, a little more lime juice + zest and 1/2 c. Bush black beans & a little dried cilantro.
My family raved over it.Can't wait to make it again. I was making it as a front was blowing in...doesn't get any better than this. YUM!!

This was a great recipe!  Quick & easy.  We omitted the corn and added a can of rinsed black beans.  We also grilled the chicken and then chopped it before cooking with the garlic.  We will definitely make this again!

Excellent soup! Extremely simple!  I have made it three times now and I will continue to make it. My family doesn't like too many chunks so before I add the chicken (I use canned, precooked to save time) I use an emersion blender. It makes it the perfect consistancy.  So quick and such an excellent flavor!

This was a really good tortilla soup.  My kids loved it.  I thought the recipe seemed to simple but it had a lot of flavor for a soup that came together so quickly.  Will make again.

I made this soup for dinner last night. I pretty much followed recipe as written except I cut my chicken up before I sauted it and I added a can of rinsed/drained black beans. This soup was so simple and surprisingly good. My kids gave it a thumbs up so I guess I will be making this again. Thanks for a great simple recipe.

Great Recipe! I added some extra jalepeno peppers (diced) and a 16oz can of black beans! Super yummy & super easy! I smashed up an avacado and put a dallop on the top of my stoup (soupy + stewy = stoup) Enjoy!

Really good!  I chopped the chicken first and cooked it in the oil instead of cooking it whole.  I also used a can of beans that already contained the cumin and other spices which made it even easier.  Simple, quick and easy.  Love it!

I used leftover chicken (don't we always need a way of using that up!!!).  I sauteed the onion and garlic and spices in the olive oil then dumped everything in the crockpot and cooked on high for 2-3 hours.  I also followed the other reviews and added a can of black beans. Delicious!!!

Very good, will make again. I used the boiled chicken recipe from this site, then shredded it. Used a can of black beans as others had suggested. Mexican blend of cheese was used. Partner said he would do without the sour cream next time.

Wowie Wow Wow!  This was so good!  As I was making it, I realized that it was basically just chicken and corn, so I added a can of black beans (rinsed and drained), and a can of diced tomatoes.  Perfect!  Will definitely be making this again!

My Girlfriend and I made this one night together.  It was great and since we love Cheese we just added all we wanted.  It was delicious.  If you want it to be a little Juicer though.  Just add some more broth.  A little more Lemon Juice brings out the flavor a little more too.

Great hearty filling recipe.  I used the crock pot to have the chicken cooked and ready to go.  I also sauteed the onion and added some beans and brown rice I had for the last 10 minutes of simmering.  Topped with sour cream and cheese... how could it be wrong?? Would definitely make it again.

This recipie is sooo good! I used left-over chicken I had cooked and shredded in the crock pot the night before so i did not saute it or have to let it simmer for 30 min.  I did saute the onion and garlic brfore adding the broth. This recipie is VERY high in sodium so i also used a low sodium broth.  I uesd hot mexican style chili pwoder because thats what i had.  I also took another reviewers advice and used a small can of "Embasa" salsa. It was great! Thanks for sharing this one.

Good soup.  I used three and one half chicken breasts and will stick to two next time.  I added a can of kidney beans and will do that again.

Using some leftover shredded chicken meat for this recipe made it very quick and easy to prepare for a "need it fast" dinner.  I sauted the meat, minced garlic and onion in a touch of olive oil until the veggies were tender.  I then added a 32oz box of chicken broth, one can of sweet corn, one can of pinto beans (drained and rinse), added the rest of the ingredients as called for (I used a "hot" chunky salsa with corn and beans), then simmered for 30 minutes to let the flavors combine.  This was very flavorful and I will be making this again!

Yum! Yum! Yum! There is a mexican restaurant near my home that has a very similar recipe. The only difference is they have black beans and chunks of avocado. I'm definately going to try this again and maybe add those two things. Great recipe!!!

pretty good recipe. I turned it into a slow-cooker meal. I used 3 large chicken thighs (I think dark meat is best in soup because it doesn't dry out from long cooking) and I let them simmer all day in the chicken stock and 1 c. of salsa. This infused the meat with the spices. Then I shredded the chicken. Aside from that, I did everything else the same. Added more salt though. Then at the very end I stirred in 1/2 c. of sour cream because its soooo good when its creamy. Served it in bowls with sliced avocado, crushed tortilla chips, and cheese.

This is absolutely my favorite soup recipe!  It is quick, easy, and you can change it to suit your taste.  I add a little more corn and onions than what is called for.  This soup also makes for great leftovers.  I will make a large amount and eat if for lunch for the next couple of days.  VERY good!

Absolutely delicious and I didn't change a thing! Well, actually the recipe doesn't say to cut the chicken breasts into bite size pieces - so that can be done either before or after cooking.

Everyone loved this soup! I added black beans to the soup and cooked it in the crockpot overnight. I also made my own tortilla strips. It turned out great, but next time I think I will try making it on the stove and add some cilantro to it.

This is a wonderful dish to make. I have made it a few times and never had any compliants. I would reccomend doubling this recipe though, 4 servings is not enough.

Very yummy=I added the "Embassa" salsa also but doubled the can.  It made the soup nice and spicy.  Just the way we like it.  I also boiled the chicken beforehand instead of sauteing. I think it kept the chicken more moist.  In my opinion, chips and cheese are not necessary.  Very good.

Wow! I made this for a soup supper at church.  I let it simmer in my crock pot all day.  I didn't have cumin, so used Penzey's Adobo seasoning, and threw in some extra.  It will be made again ... definitely ... only we won't share it!

As a mother of three boys I needed a new recipe.  I tried this one and my kids love it.  I always double the recipe so I can have left overs.  I also add two cans of kindey beans.

I made this recipe for guests this summer and it was a huge hit.  It was nice because those on a diet could skip the cheese, sour cream and nacho chips on top and just have the low fat, plain version.  Or, you could go all out and pile everything on top.  Awesome, easy recipe.

The flavor of this soup is great.  I had some difficulty with the chicken, though.  I had to use way more oil than the recipe called for to saute my chicken correctly and it took a lot longer than 5 minutes.  I almost gave up because it was sticking and not cooking thoroughly.  I'm glad I didn't!  Eventually, the chicken cooked.  Once I added the other ingredients (including a can of black beans as others suggested), the soup turned out delicious!

Love this soup!  Often make it in the crockpot so that the chicken shreds up.  I season with chili powder, cumin, garlic powder, salt and onion powder.  i also add a handful of chopped cilantro.  Top with cheese, tortilla chips, avocado and an extra squeeze of fresh lime juice.  A favorite!  I don't usually add the corn because I can do without the extra carbs.

This was sooooo easy!!!  and yummy too!!!  I followed the suggestion to put it in the crock pot.  All I did was brown the chicken breast a little and I put all the ingredients into the crock pot and left it.  The chicken breast practically shreads itself when you lift the lid.  Thanks for sharing!  Will definitely make again!!!!

Great recipe!  I always poach the chicken first, cut it up and saute it with the garlic and onions. I also add a pinch more cumin and chili and use warmed soft flour tortillas to dip in the soup instead of the tortilla chips.  Wonderful on a cold winter night!

Fantastic.  Just like my favorite restaurant's soup.  Topped it with sour cream, avacado, and jack cheese.  It was a hit and made our house smell sooo good.

This soup was amazing.  The second time we cooked it, my husband and I couldn't decide whether we wanted this or chili.  So I combined them. I used ground beef/italian sausage (omit chicken), lentils, kidney beans, beef broth(omit chicken), extra chili powder, half can of tomato paste to thicken, a tad of allspice, and left the rest of the recipe exact. It was A-M-A-Z-I-N-G! Served as suggested with cheese, chips, and sour cream. Either way this recipe is good as is or dressed up. It is a great basis for your own taste. Wonderful thanks.

Husband and I both enjoyed this recipe. However he preferred it without all of the extra toppings. He said that the tortilla chips tasted like crackers when they were in the soup.

Fantastic!  I had broiled 2 whole chickens the day before, picked them, boiled the carcass' and made stock.  Used the stock for this soup and 1/2 of a chicken cut up. To make it super quick I used Mexican seasoning mix to spice it and WOW!  It could have used a bit more chicken, next time I might add some rice too and more corn. But WOW, it was really good with some cheese and tortilla chips on top!

This soup is WONDERFUL!  I seasoned the chicken with fresh ground pepper and Season-All before baking and I cubed the chicken instead of shredding.  We topped it with Mexican-blend cheese and sour cream. Next time I make it, I plan to add black beans, also.  If you're looking for a soup that's easy and delicious, this is the one!

Hi everyone!  This recipe is wonderful.  Very easy to make.  We grilled the chicken and then shredded it.  Also, we used Kroger Medium Salsa and it gave the soup a bit of a kick.  Might have been the cumin as well.  We topped with fat-free sour cream, chopped green onions, and mild-cheddar cheese.  Also took the advice of a previous review and used lime juice instead of lemon.  Low Sodium chicken broth didn't affect the flavor at all...delicious!  Will definatly make this again!  ~Laura

Letting the soup simmer is key to full flavor. Prior to the simmering, the flavor wasn't full--not watery--but just a little weak. We used mozarella cheese, which we had on hand, and it was spectacular. The texture combination of cheese, chips, and liquid is really satisfying. My wife liked it a lot. If one is looking for healthy, leave out the cheese and chips and it would still be good, yet more healthy.

I made this with Thanksgiving leftovers.  Turkey and turkey stock.  It was great, my kids (and I) ate the entire pot.  I will definitely double it next time.  I sauteed the garlic and onion first, then added everything else.  I added a small can of green chilis, and I used a fresh salsa that had cilantro in it, which I definitely think added a nice flavor.

Yummy! So good and easy! I agree with previous reviews, that you need to first cook the chicken in the olive oil, and the shred before add the rest of the ingredients to the pot. I also sauted the onions with the chicken before adding to the pot.

This is an excellent soup.  I boiled the chicken in water with a touch of salt and one garlic clove, as suggested by someone else, and added just a hint more chili powder (we like it spicy).  My husband took the leftovers for lunch today and asked me to make another pot for dinner tonight!!  Thanks for the recipe.

My family LOVED this soup. I also used the crockpot and added black beans (drained). I only had half the amount of chicken broth the recipe called for so I added a can of cream of chicken and about a cup of water. I wasn't sure how it would come out, but it was wonderful. It cooked for about 10 hours on low. Very easy and delicious.

Based on the ingredients I didn't think it was going to stand up to the 5 star rating, but it was excellent!  My family loved it and couldn't stop raving about it...I will definitely make this again!

Boiling hte chicken is a must, makes for easy shreading. Threw everything in the crock pot & cooked on high for 2 hours, it was good. Next time I will saute the garlic & onion before adding to crock pot. Adding a can black beans is a must too. Hubby loved it, I thought it was good.

I made this last night. What a great soup this is! I'll tell you what changes I made for my own tastes. I used fat free half and half and it still was rich and creamy. I hate cream corn so I used a 16oz bag of frozen corn. I used a little more salsa than it called for and also some cayenne pepper to add more heat.We had fresh crusty rolls with real butter with this soup. I'll be making this from now on! It was almost as good if not better than Max and Erma's!

I had a delicious Tortilla soup in Austin once and I've been searching for one like it ever since.  The soup was more broth-y instead of being a thick stew and all the recipes I found, while many were good, none had the consistency I enjoyed so much in Austin.  This one is the closest and it has great flavor.

Thanks for the terrific recipe!

FABULOUS!!  I had some leftover grilled chicken and Rice-A-Roni from the night before that I used to make this wonderful soup.  I cut up the chicken so it would be easier to shred, then added the leftover rice at the end (just long enough to heat up).  This just became a family fave.  Thanks so much for sharing~

This is the best chicken tortilla soup we have ever had! It beats all the restaurants. So yummy, and not to mention quick! It took about 30 minutes total. (chicken took about 5 min. to cook, and then I let the soup simmer for about 25 min.) I followed the recipe exactly, only it's not very specific on how to prepare the chicken....I just cooked it in the oil like it said, and then shredded it. I then added the minced garlic and ground cumin, and so on and so forth. I also used a medium Picante sauce instead of chunky salsa. Thanks for such a delicious recipe!

Good but not great.  I will make it again because it was so easy to make in the crock pot. I threw in the chicken breasts whole and shredded them at the end of cooking and also added a can of black beans.

Wow! Great Flavor. I added about a TBsp. of fresh cilantro, and fried my own tortilla chips(white corn tortillas). The whole family loved this one.

Fantastic and easy soup.  Easy to modify to whatever spice level you prefer, and also simple to adjust to your preferences in terms of material.  I find a little cilantro in it makes a good improvement.

I made this tonight and it turned out awesome.  I boiled the chicken and shredded it by hand after sticking it in the freezer for about 10 minutes.  While waiting for it to cool, I started the onion and garlic and spices going in the olive oil in my large pot.  Once they were tender I added the broth, corn, salsa (made my own using lemon juice (would have used lime if I had any on hand).  I also added about a cup of black beans, which were just dry beans so I had to simmer mine a bit longer to get them tender, about 35-45 minutes.  Once in bowls, I added a spoonful of sour cream, and a small handful of pepper jack, and it was delicious.   I think next time I might add a diced jalapeno; there was one in the salsa recipe, but since this only called for a cup of salsa, not much heat transferred over, and I like a little kick.  I also used way more broth than this called for, but the additional broth was a no sodium veggie broth, so it didn't add anything bad, just flavor.  I think I ended up with one quart of chicken broth and an additional 7 or 8 cups of veggie broth and water.  I had also bought a whole chicken, so I'd cooked the thighs as well as the breasts to get a little extra meat in it.  Even with all the extra liquid, it was still a thick soup, with a hearty consistency.

This was a delight. Full of flavor, and my Fiance said it was a keeper, since he is my official taste tester! I made a few changes, but I am sure that the original is not far from the changes and it was a wonderful soup. Highly recommend.

I was surprised by how good this recipe turned out.  The only change I made was that I added a few stalks of chopped celery and an extra cup of broth (I needed to get rid of that stuff before it went bad).  Other than that, I followed the recipe to a T, and it was extremely flavorful and delicious.  One serving makes a pretty good amount of soup...I ended up freezing some for later.  Thanks for the great recipe!

I also added some diced green peppers, black beans, a few dashes of red pepper flakes cause we like spice,taco sauce instead of salsa, (my husband doesn't like tomatotes). At the end I added a few diced green onions. I personally didn't care for Tortilla chips I ate it without. I have 5 kids and everyone loved it!!!

Tastes really good with shredded chicken. I didn't have lemon, so I'm not sure how it would've tasted. Definitely recommend the sour cream on top.

Very good!  It needed a bit more salt for my taste.  (my tortilla chips were homemade by someone else, so they weren't as salty as store brand ones)  I slow cooked the soup, and sauteed the chicken and onions together like suggested by other reviewers.  I was worried that the onions were overcooked.  They tasted great, but I wager that they would have had more flavor had I added them at the very end of cooking the chicken.  I highly recommend shredding the chicken, and possibly doubling the recipe, because it's THAT good, that you'll want to freeze some for next time.  Husband tested and approved.

Yummy! I made my own tortilla chips to go with this and it was so good. If you use too spicy of salsa, the sour cream will help to bring down the hotness.

Very Yummy! I poached my chicken in chicken broth first instead of sauting it and then did everything else the recipe called for, but I added a can of black beans and a little extra spices & salsa for personal preference and it was delicious!  My picky husband liked it and so did my 21 month old.

This is great!!!!!! I add red, yellow and green peppers with a lot of onion. I also add cilantro. I add a little more chicken broth because i add all the other stuff to it. I like hot stuff so I add 2 jars of salsa and more chicken. This way I can eat it for a couple of days!!!!!! I love it.

I made this the other night and it was fantastic! I did alter the recipe by adding  black beans to the soup. While the directions were vague, I did follow the advice of those who commented on this recipe.

Loved it!! I thought it was going to be too spicy because it kinda made my eyes water while it was cooking.  Once I added the cheese and chips it was the perfect amount of spice for me.  I used Pace Picante Sauce, Medium. Also used leftover roasted chicken and tostitos broken up on top. Didn't have any monterey jack cheese, so I just used cheddar.

My family loves this recipe... My brother even liked it immensely and he doesnt care for tortilla soup usually. Very flexible recipe, I didnt have the corn so I used some fresh snapped green beans and some chopped green and yellow zucchini and I also added a bit of Cilantro to the chicken before I put the broth in. It turned out excellently. Its definitely turned into a family favorite!

This was SO good and SO easy to make.  Like other reviews, I cooked the chicken in a pan and then shredded prior to making the soup.  I did add a can of green chiles, a can of black beans and some fresh cilantro.  The monterey jack cheese, sour cream and chips were a great addition.  My family loved this and I plan on making it often.

My husband and I LOVE this soup. This recipe is a great starting off point. 

I usually add another can of broth and another cup of salsa. 
I double the cumin, garlic and lemon juice. 
I also add potatoes, carrots, garbanzo and or black beans.
For an extra twist, add diced avocado the last few minutes of cooking. 
ENJOY!

My husband said it was the best thing I've ever made. And so easy!!! 
I increased the garlic to 2 cloves, and I sliced a dried chipotle pepper which I added with the salsa. I reduced the chili powder to taste. 
To top it off, I added avocado slices. 
WOW! Soooooo gooooood!!!!!

Delicious - but it's very important to use a type of salsa that you really like cause it makes a big difference in the taste.  I ate this soup leftover for four days.  I would very highly recommend it.

Great recipe.  Simple and fast to make.  I went with another's suggestion of using a can of "Embassa" salsa.  It came out just spicy enough.  I used a clove of garlic instead of the measurement listed on the recipe.  I garnished with fresh cilantro and fresh chopped onions.  I skipped the sour cream but did put a pinch of shredded mexican blend cheese.  All in all, it was delicious!

This is some really great soup. The directions were a little vague, so I trimmed the chicken and cut it into chunks, then poached it in the chicken broth. When the chicken was cooked, I stirred in the rest of the ingredients and let it simmer for a few hours. I suppose you could also do that with whole breasts, take them out & shred them, then put them back in. I also substituted canned chickpeas for the corn. Will definitely make again :D

I thought this recipe was pretty good. I didn't change much but I did make it with homemade chicken broth. Also, instead of putting the tortilla chips in the bottom of the bowl and pouring soup over them (they get very soggy quickly), I crush them up and use them as a garnish on top.

Very good.  I definitely recommend to add black beans, also used fresh corn in season- yummy. I like it thicker but didn't thicken it and it was great.  I didn't have cumin so I omitted it and it got great reviews from the hubby. Easy and quick.

Added 1 small green bell pepper, finely chopped, and 1 can of black beans, drained.    The beans gave the soup an extra dosage of protein and heartiness.  Yum!

Delicious! My husband and I loved it. I added and extra 1/2 can of chicken broth (Low Sodium)and a 1/2 a can of black beans. I boiled the chicken first for 10 minutes and then sauted it with the garlic and cumin. We added whole grain rice to give it more sustainence. Delicious and easy to make! I will be making it again.

This recipe is delicious.  I sauteed the onions and shredded the chicken and then added the rest of the ingredients.  I also added 3 cans of chicken broth instead of two and a half a can of black beans.  Will add to my rotation.  Thanks for a great recipe! My husband loved it!

This was wonderful! I would have given 5 stars however, my family where not as in love with it as I.  My husband thinks it needed some peppers and my children wouldn't eat it at all.  That's ok.  I will decrease the recipe and make it all for me!

I made this for a party and it was so popular I barely got a chance to try it.  I'm also a fan of "Chicken Tortilla Soup III" but it's completely different and probably not what most people are expecting.  CTS V is what you expect and really terrific.  

I tripled the garlic (as is my usual) and just shredded up one of those whole roasted chickens from the grocery store.  This way, you can skip the olive oil and there's no pre-cooking.  I also added a lot of bell peppers and cooked in a crock pot, wow.

First, I have to say that this soup was great!  I made it for the first time last night for a group of 8 and everyone loved it!  Of course like most people I made a few changes here and there after reading several of the reviews.  First I changed the recipe to accommodate 8 servings.  Here are the other items I modified: I use extra virgin olive oil, 1 clove of garlic, 72 ounces of chicken broth, 22 ounce bag of seasoned southwestern frozen corn, ½ teaspoon of cilantro, no chili power, 2 tablespoons of lime juice in addition to the lemon juice, 3 cups of salsa (La Costena – Home Style Mexican Salsa Medium), Tostitos Restaurant Style White Corn chips.  In a large pot over medium heat sauté the chicken in the olive oil, garlic clove, salt, pepper, and cumin (mix well) for 10 - 15 minutes until completely cooked. Let chicken cool until you can handle it to shred the chicken by hand.  In a soup pot (pot should be at least 5 quarts) cover the bottom with a thin layer of extra virgin olive oil; add onions and sauté until tender.  Then add the broth, frozen corn, lemon juice, lime juice, cilantro, and salsa. Boil soup for 10 minutes.  Add shredded chicken into soup pot then reduce heat to low and simmer for about 20 minutes.  Pour soup into bowls then break up some tortilla chips and place on the top of soup.  Make sure you add the chips right before eating so they do not become soggy.

This was wonderful soup!!! The flavors really improve as the days go on and they have time to meld. I did add 1 more can of (low sodium) chicken broth than the recipe called for. I will definitely make this again.

I love tortilla soups at Mexican Restaurants but this recipe didn't add up to any tortilla soup I've had before. Could be the salsa, I used pace medium. Will make again for how easy it is to make and my picky eaters 1 and 3 loved it.

Awesome soup...just made it and I wouldn't change anything.  I too made the mistake of tasting it without the chips, sour cream, and cheese.  But it was amazing after.  Also, topped with a little cilantro for presentation and color.

This was soooo good and easy to make! Better than in restaurants. My 3 year old will not eat soup and he loved this. I doubled it, used leftover rotisserie chicken and served with fresh cilantro.

I thought this soup was pretty good.  I cooked the chicken for a few minutes on each side then moved it to my crock pot.  I threw everything else in there (I added extra chili powder and some mexican oregano) and cooked it for about 3 1/2 hours at medium heat.  I then pulled out the chicken, shredded it, and threw it back in.  I also drained and added a can of black beans.  Next time I plan to use cilantro as well.

Took all of the ingredients and put them in a slow cooker for 4 hours.  Took out the chicken, shredded it, and tossed it back in.  It was amazing!  We will be making this again for sure.  The only change I will have for next time is to add a little more corn.

This is super-easy and tasty. I made just a single serving for myself with some leftover chicken that I shredded. Unfortunately I did not have any corn! I didn't realize until I started making the soup, bu it was still good without it. I can imagine how much better it would be with the corn though! I can't wait to try it. I also added some green pepper. It was so delicious!

This has a great flavor. I am giving it 4 stars because it was a little too thin for me. I do not want a creamy soup, but maybe next time I'll add some more cornstarch. I also added a can of black beans, and maybe it could of used more corn. And I thought it had too much onion(that could be because of the salsa?)So I took out 1/4 cup. All in all it was fairly quick to prepare, and has a great flavor. I will make this again.Thanks!

Delish! I followed another reviewer's advice and poached the chicken in the simmering soup.  Super easy!  Sometimes I add a little velveeta at the end of cooking to make it extra cheesy.  Too bad that I discovered this recipe in the spring...looking forward to making it again in the fall.

I used more spices (about double) and would shred the chicken, as suggested by others, next time.  Otherwise this is very tasty, easy, and quick...the whole family liked it!

This was excellent!  I used leftover grilled chicken and corn on the cob.  And I added some cilantro at the end.  Next time will add black beans to make it even yummier.

really easy and good. i actually sauteed onions, jalepenos (seeded and chopped), and the chicken all together with a little bit of olive oil and then added garlic, cumin, and chili powder. after i sauteed it a bit, i added the low sodium chicken broth then cilantro and a little more salt. i boiled the soup for 15-20 minutes and served with shredded cheese, sour cream, and avocadoes. also had tortilla chips and mojitos.

This was very good. Added some cilantro at the end. Maybe next time I will use slightly less chicken or a bit more broth. It seemed a bit heavy on the chicken.

My first attempt at Chix Tort Soup.  I used smoked BBQ chix leftovers and doubled the broth and spices.    Yum  It was great!  I didn't think I would be able to make it so delicious.  Five Stars for quick easy and a keeper.

I really wasn't impressed with this recipe, but that might be my fault. I followed other reviewers suggestions to add extra liquid, and I wish I hadn't because it was way too liquidy. I compensated for the extra broth by adding extra spices, but the taste still wasn't what I was expecting. It defintately needed an avacado sliced over it and some sour cream. I think I'll keep looking for a chicken tortilla soup recipe that my family likes.

This is the only soup my husband has ever asked me to make again. I love soups, but he usually finds them unfulfilling. I added black beans and rice as another reviewer suggested. It really made the recipe complete. This is also an easy recipe to substitute ingredients in and out of depending on your pantry.

This recipe is the BEST! It is super easy too. I through everything in a crock pot, including boneless,skinless breasts. After about 4 hours on high, the chicken just falls apart and it has amazing flavor! I've added blackbeans too. Also, I tend to go heavy on the spices...lots of cumin! Excellent!

5+++ Stars I have made this 3 times once for my sister and twice for my husband. This recipe is sooo easy and quick and good. I followed the recipe the first time.I buy frozen chicken @ Winco because the chicken is always tender. I boiled the chicken the second and third time because it's easier for me. To me you can't have a mexican dish w/o avacado on the side. I highly Recommend this dish. Oh I only put 1/4 of a teaspoon of the chili powder as I don't care for too spicy.

This is exactly like the chicken soup I grew up on, only in a mexican house we didnt call it tortilla soup, just soup. I made a couple changes, but this is because i like things with a lot of flavor. I doubled the spices. Sauted the onion & garlic first. Added all the ingredients to the crock pot and let it cook for 8 hours on low. Delicious! Oh and I also added a can of Rotel tomatoes with lime and cilantro...very yummy!

A favorite with my family.  I add extra cumin, to give it a stronger flavor, but very good as written. My 2 year old and 4 year old are SO excited when they hear that this is for dinner! My biggest suggestion - double the recipe!

We absolutely love this recipe.  I like adding black beans (as another reviewer suggested).  I also concur with the notion that more chicken broth is better.  It's incredible...even without the cheese and tortillas!

This was very good soup.  I added a little extra salsa to the soup, since my family likes the flavor.  I also added a can of black beans to this.  It was delicious.  I used tortilla chips I purchased from the grocery store, and added shredded cheddar cheese on top.  All of my friends at work were envious.  I also cooked it in the crock pot, since I usually work late in the evening. I will definitely make this again.

This recipe was fantastic!!  I would make a few changes to match the taste of my family, I would use less broth, or simmer it down to less liquid, and double the recipe!!  Also, next time I think I will add peppers and cook in a crock pot.

Delicious soup! My hubby is usually the cook of the house, and isn't big on soup for dinner, but he scooped up every last spoonful of this one! Very good as the recipe reads, I just added a little cayenne pepper to spice it up a bit. Next time I'll add some black beans and fresh peppers. Thanks for a great dinner!

Words cannot express the joy my family has when I make this dish. I do not care if I double or triple the recipe; I rarely have leftovers. I just threw everything in the crockpot and let the seasonings simmer. I have made this a few times now and the last time I added a little cilantro and enjoyed it even more.

wow- yumm!! easy and flavorful.  The only changes I made was instead of tortilla chips, i used Fresh Gourmet tortilla strips (santa fe flavor). In the grocery store by the croutons. I like onions-but will prob cut back a bit next time.  And I added some fresh cut cilantro on top of served bowl along with cheese.  Great! Will be a regular in my home.  Thanks!

Very, very good recipe. Since I am a born rebel, I didn't follow it to a T, but used crockpotted split chicken breasts.  I also added more chicken broth and a can of cream of chicken soup--perfect creaminess!

I used a deli chicken for this recipe and it shredded beautifully.  From start to finish, this recipe took five minutes.  Just throw it all together in a pot.  Very very good.

This was fabulous! I was searching for a good Tortilla Soup recipe for my 9 year old because she orders it at every restaurant she can get it! 
I was skeptical because it was so easy, but we had it last night and it was FABULOUS! It was even better today for lunch. Thank you for the submit!! 
If your skeptical....don't be. Try it! =} 
I had my own chicken broth and also put julienned carrots and zucchini....DELICIOUS!!

Delicious, easy to make and what a savory smell!  I cut the chicken into bite-sized pieces before cooking.  I used a black bean salsa and the beans added a little extra color and flavor, so I decided that next time I will add a can of black beans and maybe a pinch of cilantro.  Otherwise it is perfect!

This was really good!  After reading the reviews, I decided to throw in some rinsed black beans and minute rice - and more broth to make it soupy again.  A very versatile recipe.

Delicious; tastes just like authentic chicken tortilla soup. Definitely use lime instead of lemon. I used a box of Imagine chicken broth, and I didn't have any fresh garlic so had to use garlic salt. Also, I added black beans. We topped with tortilla strips and sour cream. Even my 4 yr old who said "I'm not going to eat that" had two bowls full!

HOLY COW! THIS IS GOOD!!!  People, it doesn't get much easier than this, either.  About 45 minutes from start to finish and I didn't change a thing. You can adjust the "heat" by using mild/med/hot salsa.  You will enjoy :)

Absolutely yummy!  If it is available, try it with fresh salsa.  I think that gave it a distinctive flavor.  I also added 4 oz velveeta so my kids couldn't see the tomatoes and onions as well :).  That maintained the thin broth, but made it more opaque.  The recipe doesn't make a lot -- if you want to feed more than 4 or 5 consider doubling it.  In fact, consider doubling it anyway because the leftovers will go fast!

I love this recipe because it can be so versatile.  I like a little more texture so I also add a can of Hominy.  Sometimes I will change up the beans.  Whatever you're in the mood for, this recipe will take it!

Fantastic!  Highly recommend making it the night before as it tastes even more terrific THE NEXT DAY. I used breast meat of a pre-cooked chicken, a can of rinsed black beans, and Embassa salsa. Have an extra can of broth on hand in case you like it soupier, but I felt it was fine the way the recipe stated.

The flavor of this soup is great but truly amazing when you add the sour cream and cheese... it is a must.  Will use other reviews' suggestion of using more chicken broth.... soup needs just a little more broth to it.  Thank you for the great recipe!

I loved this recipe! It was sooo easy and quick to make I will definitely make it again and again. I took the suggestion of some reviewers and added 'mexican style' beans (with liquid to thicken up the soup) and also used a packet of taco seasoning for flavor. I think it made the soup more like a meal. I only had canned corn so I used that and it came out great. I boiled the chicken before hand and shredded it before adding it to the soup mixture. The amount of broth you add just depends on how thick or soupy you want it.

This is my official first review because this soup was definitely worth it. My fiance and I had planned to do tortilla soup tonite but I decided to try this recipe before cooking our instant bagged soup. SO GLAD I DID. I used the advice of others and added one more can of broth...totally necessary if you seconds later. And I used tenderloins instead of whole breast (they take less time to cook). I didn't have garlic so I just used a mixed seasoning that included both garlic and cumin and it really turned out great.  Will make it again next week!

It was a good recipe.  I couldn't find my recipe and it was on my Christmas Eve menu.  I substituted this recipe and it worked out beautifully.  I like to fry strips of white corn tortilla instead of using chips.

Made this tonight and it turned out wonderful.  I also modified it a little as some of the others did. I added a can of rinsed black beans , and extra can of chicken broth , and thickened the broth a little with some cornstarch .  I also made my own tortilla strips by cutting some flour tortillas and frying them in a little cooking oil .  My familiy loved it !

With all the great reviews, I had to try this. I'm glad I did. Followed the recipe with one exception. Instead of jar salsa I used some leftover "spicy bean salsa" (from this site) and to keep the tomato content added a can of diced tomatoes. Also, as other reviews stated, added 1 additional can of chicken broth. The kids loved it. I think it is the only time I have gotten either of them to eat tomatoes in anything but ketchup! Thanks for the recipe. By the way, "Homesteader Cornbread" (from this site) is a good side for this awesome soup.

This was sooooo good!!! When I was making it I thought it would be a little boring but we loved it!!  I kept the chicken whole and simmered the soup for about an hour.  Then I shredded the chicken and put it back into the soup and cooked it about 15 minutes more.  The soup cooked down a little so next time I might use a little more salsa.  Adding the chips and sour cream at the end made this soup out of this world!!!  Super easy and so full of flavor.  One of my new favorites!!!

This was awesome. For a thicker, creamier soup put 1/2 jar of the double cheddar sauce in from Ragu.

I couldn't believe that this recipe could be so good and so easy! I made this for my girlfriends and our kids and everyone loved it! My husband was sad that none was left for him. I cooked the chicken with Taco seasoning and added a can of black beans- it was perfect. I will definately make this for my husband soon!

This soup was excellent.  Made just the way it is printed.  I used Pace's medium Salsa, which gave it a little kick, but was not too spicey (we don't like too spicey).  Yummy...

I thought this was really bland.  I kept adding more spices, but it never got any better.  We had leftovers, but no one ate them.  I won't make this again.

love it! i followed the advice NMR gave...and it turned out very good! I also used fritos instead of tortilla chips! yummy!! and definitely use more then 2 cans of broth especially if you are adding black beans. i used 4 and it still was barely enough so i added some water and spiced it up some more.   **UPDATE** I now use boilion cubes...so I make 2 cups, and then I add 2 more cups of water to make more broth. Also last night I only had drumsticks and I just boiled those in there and when they were done I took them out and took the chicken off the bone, and put it back in the soup...WOW it adds a lot of flavor! This is my suggestion! Also, you wont even need to add more chicken broth you could use water and cut back on the sodium.

This was oh so good.  The flavors were great together.  I did add a can of rinsed black beans, 1 chopped and seeded jalapeño pepper and 1.5 cups of steamed white rice.  The rice seemed necessary as I thought the soup looked rather runny before hand.  I also used 1 lg can of chicken as I was in a hurry.  Very good, will make again.  This would be a perfect recipe for those once a month cookers to freeze!!! (just make the rice at the time you thaw the soup; don't freeze with the rice in the soup!!)

This is a great and well loved recipe.  I also boil the chicken and shred it as suggested in other reviews.  I also saute the onion before I add it to the pot.  I use the water/broth that I boilded the chicken in instead of the cans of chicken  broth - just to cut a few calories and I use almost 3 cups.  It is very good and a meal that we cook often.

This recipe was fantastic!  My only complaint is that there was not enough broth, making it not quite a stew but just not enough for the way I like my soup.  I also made a few changes:

After the chicken was cooked, I removed it and shredded it myself and then placed the chicken, onion, and garlic back in together.  I used 2 cans of diced tomatoes and chiles (undrained), 1/2 can of black beans (drained), and reduced the salsa to 4 or 5 spoonfuls. I also like mine spicy so I used a little cayenne pepper, too.  Next time I will probably just use another can of chicken broth. Overall, delicious and definitely becoming a staple in my recipe book!

TRY ADDING SOME SOFT CORN TORTILLAS AT THE VERY END OF COOKING. I USUALLY CUT THEM INTO SQUARES. IT HELPS MAKE IT MORE FLAVORFUL AND FILLING. I HAVE 6 KIDS THEY ALL LOVE THIS SOUP. I DO FOLLOW A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT RECIPE. THIS IS A GREAT QUICK STARTER RECIPE THOUGH.

This is a fabulous soup!  I floured and fried up 8 boneless,skinless,defatted chicken thighs (in 1/4 cup sunflower oil)first.  Took out 4 for shredding and saved 4 for another meal.  Poured a box of organic low sodium chicken broth into the brown bits of the frying pan and boiled them a bit to soften.  Pouring that into the soup made for a VERY hearty flavor.  I used salsa verde instead of chunky salsa.  Garnished with cilantro and pepperjack cheese.  I'm making a double batch next time since my family wolfed this down with little to spare.

Loved it. Easy. Quick. I cooked my frozen chicken breasts in some broth and a little water for about 30 minutes and then shredded it. I added more cumin and chili powder and a fresh diced tomato along with a few tablespoons of a green salsa in addition to the cup of regular jar salsa. I was so happy that I had everything on hand. I will definitely make this recipe again and again.

Great Recipe! I added Mexican Style and Kidney Beans. I also added onion powder, garlic powder, taco seasoning and more cumin. I used shredded turkey and turkey broth. I also added a can of rotel. I served with homemade tortilla chips(didn't put in soup), sour cream and jalapeno's . I made this for my in-laws and they loved it! Will definitely make again.

I gave this 5 stars based on some little changes. I bought a rottiserie chicken...you know the ones at the store that are already cooked for you and shredded into the soup.  I added the taco seasoning per others suggestions and left out the corn...just dont like the texture in soup. I just crushed the tortilla chips on top as a garnish instead of adding them and getting soggy. The result was a wonderful tasting soup. I had a lot of people asking for the recipe.  The most important thing is my 4 kids loved it and it wasn't too spicy for them...YUMMMM

A great treat for the coldest weather. I did add Cayanne to mine to kick it up a notch; my own personal taste. The cheese and sour cream sealed the deal! My entire family ate it up. I'm making it for a potluck at work this week!

This was absolutely delicious and easy! To save time I prepared the chicken using a package of chicken taco seasoning in a medium sized pot, then added the chicken broth, salsa and lemon, simmered, poured over Mission Brand Cilantro and Lime flavored tortilla chips, finally topped it with mexican blend shredded cheese.  I did not add any onion, garlic or other  seasonings, It was perfect and done from start to finish in 20 minutes!

Easy.  Delicious!  This is quite a bit of chickend for the broth.  If you like it really soupy, use more broth or less chicken!

DEEE-licious! I have 6 people in my house so I had to double the recipe. It was spicy and soooo good. We used pepper jack instead of the Monterrey jack because we wanted just a kick in the cheese. SO good! Perfect for a cold night!

Very flavorful.  I added a pint of half and half.. this makes it a little more creamy.    If you add the half and half omit one can of chicken broth.  (this makes it less salty too)

I loved this recipe.    Main changes, no corn added, no salsa added.  Instead I used whole peeled tomatoes in a can, fresh cilantro, and avocado slices added to the bowl.  It tastes so fresh and healthy.  I love it and will defenitely use it again.

I did make some ajustments but I am sure if you follow this recipe exactly it will come out good.  My adjustements are as follows:  I double the entire recipe: I seasoned the chicken with salt, pepper and garlic.  I like shredded chicken so I boiled the chicken in chicken stock first and shredded.  I countinued on .the receipe as directed and even added a little olive oil to the cooked chicken.  Instead of the salsa, I used Hunt's New Fire Roasted Diced with Garlic tomatoes. I think this gave it a great flavor as I am not a huge fan of store bought salsa.  Once I had everything in the pot I brought it to a boil and then reduced to simmer for one hour.  Came out great!

Excellent!  Modified only because of what I had on hand: used 2 cloves of garlic to saute leftover Thanksgiving turkey, used 1 medium onion, replaced water and bouillon with turkey/herb drippings, replaced lemon juice with fresh lime juice.  Added 1 can black beans while simmering and fresh chopped cilantro in last 10 minutes.  Used PACE Picante sauce.  Came out super yummy: best tortilla soup I've had thus far.  Thank you!

Check out the enchilada sauce for the spiciness factor.  I like a more hearty soup with more veges.  But nice spicy flavor.

This was fantastic. I used a rotissere chicken from the store and just tore it up. I also added a can of black beans, drained and rinsed. I garnished with avocado! Great recipe for a cold rainy day.

I didn't know what to expect from this because I have never had this kind of soup before.  I was almost regretting making it when I was putting it all together, but it turned out SO well.  I added another chicken breast, black beans and more spice than was called for.  I also wasn't sure about adding the tortilla chips but they, as long as the cheese and sour cream I put on top, really added to the flavor.  Yummy!

Outstanding recipe!  I did tweak it a bit.  I made homemade chicken stock with split chicken breasts and used the chicken and stock from that.  I used lime juice instead of lemon juice.  I also doubled the amount of broth and added additional cumin, chili powder and salsa because the tortilla chips absorb a lot of juice.  Finally, top it with fresh cubed avacado along with the cheese...YUMMY!

Wonderful!  Everyone's additional advice was very helpful.  Every ingredient is on the list of 'good food' that my doctor gave me.  The only change that I made was to boil/shred the chicken breasts first, and then I made a salt free broth from the water.  Free Broth!!

My take on this recipe turned out great. I doubled the recipe and two boxes of broth worked great. I browned the chicken in a skillet with the olive oil and put all the ingredients in the crockpot on low as another user suggested. I skipped on the onions (don't like them) added a can of rinsed black beans and used a can of extra hot rotel for the salsa. The chunks of tomato and green peppers were perfect in the soup, and it was plenty spicy. Added a dollop of sour cream on top, and it was perfect! Hubby loved it.

I made this soup for dinner tonight and it turned out great, despite not having the corn and onion to add to it,it still had a wonderful spicy flavor. I added a package of taco seasoning because I love the flavor, substituted cheddar for the monteray jack since I had none on hand. Additionally added cream cheese to the top since I was out of sourcream and it was delicious! I'm rating it five stars because in addition to being delicious it's super fast and easy.

Sorry, we didn't like it. Tasted too much like a broth. This is why we added heavy cream to it, which helped a bit. Make sure to use a really good salsa. The one we used wasn't great and probably contributed to the overall mediocre taste.

This soup was good, but could have been a little more flavorful.  If I make it again, I will add a few additions of my own.  I think that beans of some sort would add flavor, as would more chicken broth.

This recipe was very tasty.  My only change was to let it simmer for about an hour, simply because I had the time, and knew the flavors would just continue to blend and get better and better.  Oh, also, I misread the recipe and only used half as much chicken as called for (2 breast HALVES, rather than 2 whole breasts), and that was plenty.  Next time, I'll follow the suggestion of other reviewers and add a can of drained and rinsed black beans.  I used Mission brand corn chips, and served the soup with hot corn bread.  Yum!

Wow, Wow, Wow! This was soooo good! I added black beans to mine. I had half of a roasted chicken left so I shredded that up and added more garlic. This with some bread and salad and it was the perfect meal. Yum!

Oh my goodness!  We loved this soup!  I made a few changes:  I boiled the chicken breasts ahead of time with a crushed garlic clove and some salt.  I cooled them and shredded them and then added them to the sauted onion and garlic.  I also used lime juice instead of lemon juice.  I've made this with and without black beans, and we liked it without the black beans better.  This soup is so tasty and we'll make it over and over again for sure!

Yum, yum, yum.  I wouldn't change a thing on this recipe.  The whole family loved it and wants me to make it again, just a week later.  Served with a green salad and crusty bread.  Great comfort dinner!

THIS is definately the BEST Chicken Tortilla soup I have EVER had.  My kids even loved it....and they are 4 and 2!!  I did leave out the salsa and added a can of chopped tomatos instead, also added a can of black beans (drained).  YUM!!!  My husband also said it was one of the best soups he's ever had!  He can't wait until I make it again.

It was delicious.  I used turkey instead of chicken.  Added a jalapeño and Tapatio for some spice.  For the top, chopped cilantro with the cheese and sour cream and my husband made tortilla chips out of corn tortillas.

I've made this recipe 3-4 times so far and each time it's just as good as before (or even better!) My roommate salivates whenever I make it. I big dice the chicken and also put in a can of black beans. And use a lot more cumin and garlic than the recipe calls for. Also some fresh cilantro as garnish! DELICIOUS!

This recipe was wonderful! I followed the advice of some other reviewers and boiled the chicken in a little water, adding a decent amount of crushed garlic, cumin, and cayenne pepper. I also cut the chicken breasts in half and boiled them for only 10 minutes. They almost shred themselves. I also sauted the onions a bit with the garlic and spices before adding the chicken broth. I then just used a whole small bag of frozen corn mix (corn, black beans, peppers, tomatoes) in place of the cup of corn. To a bit more heartiness, I used about a cup and a half of black bean chipotle salsa. This was an amazingly easy and rewarding soup. My 3 roommates loved it!

I'll make this again, but add more broth. I added a can of kidney beans and topped with pepper jack cheese, avocado, and sour cream. You HAVE to use good salsa since that's where so much of the flavor comes from, don't skimp!

Wonderful Soup. I tripled the recipe for 12 servings and 5 of us had seconds with just a little left.  I followed the advice and added drained,washed black beans and tomatoes with cilantro. I also used a whole rotisseri chicken to save time. Will add it to my book! It was great!

My husband loves this soup, although I'm not sure what the lemon juice adds to the recipe. I reduce the amount of onion by half (personal preference) because the salsa also contains onions. You can control the amount of heat in this soup by the type of salsa you use -- a mild salsa will give a nice flavor, but less heat, while a spicy salsa will amp up the intensity of the flavor. Use a low-sodium chicken broth because the salsa will already be salty.

This recipe was pretty good!  Next time I definately want to add Cilantro though.  Also I used left over chicken from a whole chicken that I roasted the day before.  Instead of tortilla strips and shredded cheese on top, I cooked a quesadilla with Monterey Jack cheese and then dipped it into the soup.  Now that was tasty and my husband raved over the quesadilla soaked in soup!!  Thanks!

Made this as an appetizer for "Chile Pork" and "Mango Tango Black Bean Salsa," also from allrecipes, for an amazing low-carb, low-fat meal at a dinner party.  Easy and excellent.

This was so good. I will make this one often in my Michigan winters. I did add 1 can of black beans and more frozen corn. I made my own chips by cutting some flour tortillas into thin strips and deep frying until crispy. I served them on the side along with other extra's, avacado, shredded cheese and sour cream. Yum!

My family gorged themselves on this soup and asked for more.  They can hardly wait for me to make it again.  The only change I made was using pepper potpourri instead of chili powder because I couldn't find my chili powder. My son eats in some of the best restaurants in the country with his job so he is hard to impress.  He was greatly impressed and planning ahead for the next time I should make it.  This soup would go great with wings for football weekends.

This recipe is great! It is so simple. I usually boil the chicken the night before (or freeze it) and throw everything into the crockpot to cook while I am at work. I think sitting all day makes the flavors combine really well!

Very good, and healthy.  But I wasn't a fan of the crushed up tortillas in the soup because they became too soggy. Next time I will serve them on the side for people to add in as they eat.

Added chipotle seasoning and lime juice while simmering. In addition, what really made this great was adding fresh chopped cilantro, chopped green onions, sliced avocados on top before serving.

This is the best soup ever!  I could eat the whole pot myself, but I would have to fight off my family.  I make it with canned chicken and canned corn and it is so easy and fast!  Try adding a can of (drained) black beans - mmmm!

Other than substituting the chili powder/cumin for taco seasoning and thickening it up with corn starch, I followed this recipe as written.  It was very good - everyone, husband, 4, 6, 8 year olds, as well as an 8 year old neighbor, were full of compliments.  The only negative is that my husband didn't care for the tortillas under the soup - didn't like the soggy chips.  Easily remedied next time.  Made a ton so hopefully it freezes well.  This would be fantastic on a frigid winter's night.  Yum!!

Very, very good.  My daughter--who does not cook much--filled the house with the aroma of this soup and it was fantastic!  We had cheese quasadillas with it and we will be making it over and over.

Delicious!  I used a pre-cooked rotisserie chicken from the store to make this soup.  So easy!  I added the largest can of chicken broth I could find and a can of rinsed black beans.  I skipped the chips and served it with Mexican corn bread.  I will make this over and over.

Very good.  A little on the murky side both in the flavors and clarity.

Good stuff!!  For those who like a thicker soup base you can try one of two things.  You can add tomato paste, but you may have to adjust seasonings to account for this.  Or you can add black beans and mash some of them.  These give a nice cream texture.

I've been looking for a good chicken tortilla soup for a while and this one is it.  The only change I made was to add more garlic; I grated two large cloves.  Next time, I'll probably sautee the onion with the chicken.  It's a good basic recipe that you can tinker with to suit your tastes.

I really like this soup, but I do not like it with the tortilla chips.  The chips totally over power the soup and take away from the flavor.  It is MUCH better to chop up 1 or 2 tortillas and them directly to the soup!

Will definitely make again....without the chips, but with added tortillas.  Thanks!

This was good and hearty too.  I substitubed hot NM Hatch chilis (red & green) powder for the regular chili powder.  I also added about 1/2 -3/4 c of Hatch green chilis. I accidentally used Herdez Ranchera Salsa but it didn't ruin the soup.  Like others suggested I added a can a black beans -yum.  I thought another can of chicken broth would have made it more like a soup but hubby thought it was fine.  With the tortilla's crushed and added to the bowl, followed by the soup and a garnish of sour cream, chopped avocado and a single tortilla chip it was tasty and satisfying.  Even without the cheese this was good and I will be making it again.  Relatively quick and easy.

This was good.  I did adjust a little: added more cumin and chili powder, used the juice of one lime instead of lemon juice, added one can of black beans, and thickened it a little with cornstarch and water, then stirred in about 1/2 c. shredded cheddar cheese.  It was pretty quick to make, and had very good flavor.  I will be making this one again!

I loved this recipe!!!!  I used Rotel like others suggested, increased the amount of garlic and added a cup of cooked rice.  This was delicious and quite filling.  I will definitely be making this again. (And to think I spent so much money at my local Mexican restaurant this summer!!)

This was really great.  My toddler got into the spice drawer and stole/hid my cumin so I replaced it with taco seasoning, and it worked well.  I also added 1 cup of canned black beans, which makes for a chunkier soup.

I should've doubled this!  I made this for company and thank goodness I made sopapillas to go with it -- the soup was devoured in minutes.  It was not creamy and thick like a certain restaurant's, but I liked this better.  I used hearty tortilla chips and medium salsa.  It had great flavor, but not the spicy bite that would've upset kids & elderly in the grouping.

This was great. I used garlic powder because I didn't have fresh garlic and I omitted the onions... seeing how there is enough onions in the salsa (I am not an onion fan) I also made some changes. I added a can of refried beans, 2 cans of diced tomatoes, a can of rinsed black beans, and an avacado. It turned out great. With plenty of left overs :)  Will make again.

This soup was delicious!  I boiled the chicken with a clove of garlic and shredded it (as another reviewer did as well).  I reserved some of the broth from where I boiled the chicken in case I needed more than the recipe called for--which I did.  I also added black beans to the soup.  It turned out great!  I will definitely make this again.

My entire family loved this!  I am making it for the 2nd time in only 10 days.  I use a 32 oz box of organic chicken broth, a can of black beans drained, and double the amount of corn.  It is great with or without all of the cheese, chips, and sour cream.  Quick, easy, and yummy!  A major keeper in our house!  Thanks for the recipe.

Very tasty. I cooked mine longer because I love the smell of a good soup cooking! I had grilled chicken that my husband grilled with pecan added so it gave the soup a great smoky flavor. I used Emeril's medium salsa it gave the soup a nice kick. I love garlic so I used a lot more garlic than the recipe states. I sauteed the onion in the oil & added the rest. Really good - thanks for sharing.

I skipped the seasonings & just added a taco seasoning packet, plus 3/4 c. water to cooked chicken. This  is a great soup. You can add lots of 'extras', too. Black beans, diced onion & avocado, veggies, rice, etc.

I pretty much stuck to this recipe except I boiled my chicken breast first with cumin, garlic, chili powder and i boullion cube then I sauted it and I did not use the can broth.  I used the broth that I made.  I fried my own tortilla strips and topped the soup with sour cream, gaucamole, and mexican quesadilla cheese.  My family loved this soup and I will for sure make this again.

This was very good, but could have been better.  I was low on garlic and didn't have time to go the store to get more.  I shredded the cooked chicken & added black beans.  Also sauteed the onions a little first.  Next time I make it I think I'll do the same changes as above except I'll also add some jalepeno, a little more broth, and use a little more garlic.  It's good served with tortilla chips, monterrey jack cheese, and avocado pieces.  I hope to perfect it next time I make!

This soup was fantastic!  My boyfriend loved it and ate one too many bowls!  I made a few alterations such as using a whole carton of chicken broth, adding 1 jalapeno pepper, and half a can of black beans.  We loved it and will definitely make it again!

This was great!  I agree that a little more chicken stock is needed to get more broth.  I put the onion/garlic/jalepeno (yeah, I added a jalepeno) in the food processor and added it to the chicken all together.  The soup turned out a little spicy for me (next time I'll deseed the pepper), so I put 2 dollops of sour cream in it to tone it down.  And it was perfect!

Awesome & EASY!!!  Super recipe of things already in the pantry.  I made just a few as-you-go changes...  I sauteed the onions with the chicken, used 1 can corn (drained) rather than frozen and added a can of (rinsed) black beans.  Skipped the chili powder & lemon juice.  Used picante sauce since that's what I had on hand.  And I thickened it slightly with 1/4 cup water & 2 Tbsp cornstarch.

I was craving something Mexican last night.  I stopped at the store and bought ingredients for this soup on my way home.  At home I discovered I had no chili powder so added 1/2 tsp. more cumin plus 1/2 tsp. oregno and 1/4 tsp black pepper and 1/8 tsp. red pepper.  I also added black beans.  I used 3 cups broth that was in freezer instead of canned broth and stirred in cheese at the end.  The texture was perfect and it was delicious.  Satisfied my cravings.  As others suggested I may double up on spices next time.

Very good!  Added black beans and will use a bit of a roux to thicken next time, as it was kind of thin.  Flavor was awesome!

My huband saw the onions and thought "ewww" but I made him taste it and of course later he asked for seconds.  Then later that night asked for thirds.  I followed the recipe exactly but diced the chicken breast before I cooked it.  The whole family loved it.  I will be making this again very soon.

If I could give this soup more stars I would. It is me favorite thing to eat...period! A friend gave me the recipe after making it for me and my husband and we now joke around that it is like crack because we are always craving it and wanting more! We both make this at least 2 times a month and I always make so much extra just so I can eat on it for days! I have passed this recipe down and everyone who has it also makes it a few times a month and loves it as much as I do. The tortillas (we like the hint of lime ones best), cheese, sour cream, and cilantro on top makes it!

I also made a few changes not many-instead of salsa I added a can of Rotel tomatos, I also added a pinch of dried Cilantro and one more can of broth.  We like plenty of broth.  Sooo good!

Very, very good.  Two chicken breasts were almost too much chicken, but lucky for me I love chicken!  I also doubled the amount of garlic and cumin as other reviewers did and used corn and black bean salsa.  Excellent recipe.  Thanks!

This was a really good, filling recipe.  I didn't have any cumin, ground chili pepper, or lemon juice on hand, but it didn't seem to lack them.  I think I'll take the other reviewers' advice and try shredding the chicken instead of just leaving it cubed. I also added a lot more garlic (half a clove) and sauteed it with the chicken for about 1 minute before adding the broth.

Very good and FAST!  I didn't have any salsa so I used a 32 oz can of chopped tomatoes which worked great with the 1 whole chopped green pepper I added.  Black beans would be a tasty addition to this soup also.  Will make again.

Wonderful soup!  After simmering the whole breasts for 20 minutes, I shredded them then simmered another 20 minutes.  Tastes a lot like Posada's!!

Wonderful and easy tortilla soup.  Just what I was looking for!  It is a wonderful way to use up some left over chicken also.  Just shred and pop in while cooking.  I added a little more spice and garlic then the recipe calls for but I like a lot of flavor.
Thanks for submitting this, it will be a regular in my house this winter.

Easy. I used chicken and broth that I made in the crockpot during the day and then assembled the rest on the stove in about 10 minutes. Delicious.

I made this for a party & everyone loved it.  I did not have the black beans or hominey but did have white kidney beans & added more tomatoes (the kind with green chilis) I love versatility of this soup-the options are endless.  Don't be afraid to experiment! LOVED IT!

Awesome!  We had a cold snap in Tampa and this smelled INCREDIBLE simmering on the stove.  I doubled the garlic, cumin and chili powder, added a can of diced tomatoes and navy beans (I was out of black beans) and tossed in a hearty pinch of red pepper flakes.  I poached the chicken in some broth so it would be tender and shredded it before adding it back into the soup.  I also sauteed the onions and garlic.  YUM!!!

A great, fresh tasting soup.  I made this with some leftover corn-on-the cob last summer and still can't stop thinking about it 8 months later.  I'm looking forward to corn season again, just to make this soup!

Absolutely the yummiest.  I did everything except for the corn, I did add avocado slices right before eating.  It's got to be the best recipe I've tried, the best thing is that it had very few ingredients, I had everthing I needed in my pantry.

Great recipe. I made this for my Bunco group and they loved it! Substituted canned corn for the frozen and it worked just fine. I also cut back on the salsa, as someone else noted.

AWESOME!!!  Had to make the following substitutions:  green onion, diced tomatoes with jalepenos (had no salsa).  Easy, fast and delicious!  We'll be having this one often.  Thank you for a great recipe.

My husband, being from Texas, often misses Tex-mex cuisine. I tried this recipe for him. We both really enjoyed it. I had to eliminate the chili powder because of a food alergy to it, but the recipe was still great. I add rotel to ensure some kick.

Incredibly simple and so very delicious!  I added the whole chicken breasts after adding in the broth and allowed them to cook for 20mins before removing and shredding them.  Used  fresh lime juice and also served with lime wedges for added flavor.  A keeper!

I was a little leery of this recipe at first, but it turned out great!  I cooked the chicken and shredded it before adding the rest of the ingredients.  The cheese and sour cream are a must!  Next time I might add some black beans, also.

Great recipe, although I did add a few extra ingredients, including hot sauce, one small chopped apple, black pepper, kosher salt, and a freshly chopped jalapeno pepper.  I have one suggestion: I believe the soup would be much better with the chicken shredded.

We thoroughly enjoyed this soup.  I had lime juice instead of lemon, and garlic powder for flavoring instead of fresh minced garlic, but it still turned out to be delicious.  The only problem is that I will need to make a double batch next time - highly recommended!

I love this recipe. It's so easy to make! I've made this recipe several times for different guests and everyone of them has asked me for this recipe. It's great for a large crowd. (my husband likes it with avocado on top with sour cream)

Betty, thank youfor sharing this wonderful recipe!! I've made it several times now. The only change I've made is to add just a little water. So quick, easy and tasty.

How excellent is this recipe!  Make sure you put the tortilla chips in the bottom like the recipe instructs.  I was not going to do it but I am glad I did.  Excellent flavor and very easy to make.

This was my first try at making tortilla soup at home.  Excellent recipe!  Very easy to make, very tasty, and definitely a keeper.  Several in my dinner party asked for seconds.
