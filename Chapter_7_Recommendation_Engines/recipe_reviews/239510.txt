I made this recipe. I used only 3 boneless chops,4 T butter on bottom of the dish,  pkg of stuffing. I also used 1 can cream of celery soup and 1/2 c milk instead of the tomatoes. I covered it and baked at the 375 for 45 min.as it started to smell like it was burning. I took it out of the oven and all was well. I will make this again!

I didn't have high hopes for this recipe. No changes made, other than use bone in pork chops and salt free seasoning. I do think the second can of stewed tomatoes should be blended to give extra liquid for the stuffing.

I used the recipe as shown and the results were not good at all. The stuffing mix was soo dry we had to remove it and soak it in hot water to make it edible.  A partial improvement would be to use half of the stuffing mix called for and add liquid to the stewed tomatoes. We ate what we could and tossed the rest out.

This probably would have been better if I had melted the butter in the bottom of the pan since parts of the stuffing stayed dry. Overall the dish had a good flavor with the added tomatoes. Would I make it again? Maybe.
