My friend said "It's a work of art!"  My modifications: Do NOT use sugar.  3 T of coconut oil is sufficient oil.  Slice carrots thinly with food processor.  Didn't have croutons, didn't need them.

We really liked this!   I did not cook it as long as the recipe suggested.   I sliced the carrots very thinly and added garlic.  Skipped the croutons.  Will use red onions instead of red cabbage next time.

This was very good! It was a nice change of pace for roasted veggies.  As other reviewers mentioned, I skipped the croutons, and it was still good.

Offers a sweet option to veggies.  We didn't have the croutons & still loved it.  Will make again.

Sugar, salt and Italian herb seasoning does not go well together. My family and I didn’t like this recipe at all.

It was quick,easy, and delicious. The only thing I did differently was due to necessity. I only had balsamic vinegar infused with cranberry and walnut.  But it turned out delicious. I will definitely make it again!

This turned out  great. I didn't add carrots and used green cabbage instead of red, but I had a red onion so included it. The flavors were great.

My husband and I enjoyed this and we’ll probably try it again sometime. The only thing I think we’ll do differently next time is either cook it for less time or at a lower temp. We cooked it for about 26 minutes on 425 and it came out quite crispy.

All my guests loved this! Nice flavor and a great addition with the red cabbage. Didn't take that long in the oven to get tender though. I was afraid they would be mushy if I left them in that long

Delicious! I added garlic salt and garbanzo beans as well; don't like croutons so I left those out but it was fine without them. I will definitely be making this again!
