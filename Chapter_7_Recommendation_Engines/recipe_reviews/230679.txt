Oh yeah baby! This is it!! So good my family asked for it the night after we first ate it. I reduced the heat by only adding half the red pepper and no jalapeño. I also added one can kidneys, one black bean and one great northern to give it an amazing eye appeal. Next time I'm gonna make it vegan with the vegan sausage from Costco and veggie broth. Beautiful and delicious.

I made this exactly as written. It was really tasty, but too salty!  The only Cajun seasoning blend I have has salt as the first ingredient.  I hesitated to put a tablespoon in, but decided to give it a chance.  I shouldn't have.  The recipe should be adjusted to say "salt-free Cajun seasoning blend", if such a thing exists, then salt can be added as needed.

That being said, we loved the spice and flavors in this.  I will look for salt-free Cajun seasoning (or just use less of the one I have) and make this again!

Excellent recipe!  I substituted brown rice for white, and dried beans for canned.  I threw everything in the slow cooker at once. Unfortunately my beans didn't cook up but that was no fault of the recipe.  I will make again using canned beans!

I made this dish exactly as written, only change was I used 2 cups of low sodium chicken broth (boxed) only for the sodium content. It was a huge hit with the whole family. I didn’t find ours was too spicy, but that could be that the Cajun seasoning I had was milder. This will go into our regular dinner options! Thank you for sharing this!

I usually don't come back and give a review, but felt obligated to do so.  I will definitely make this again!  I've been trying to find a Red Beans & Rice recipe for years with every other recipe going in the trash.  This is THE ONE!  My husband & I kept going back for another bowl.  The spices were dead on.  I can't wait to try left overs as I bet the spices marinated even more.  I watch my salt intake & did not think this was too salty as I used low sodium bouillon and did not add salt.  Thank you for sharing your excellent recipe!!

My husband raved about this dish!  I substituted Mezzetta Tamed Jalapeno peppers for the jalapeno... still spicy and delicious...not too fiery.

We loved this. Made a few changes: 1) turkey kielbasa because we don’t eat pork. 2) low sodium beans. 3) lower sodium chicken broth instead of water+bouillon 4) lowest sodium Cajun seasoning I could find 5) low sodium diced tomatoes 6) no additional salt. Some said it was too salty so I eliminated as much as I could and it was great. Husband can’t wait for me to make it again. I a,

Great recipe. I left out the hot pepper flakes and let people add them later. That made it more kid friendly. I also added some cubed ham we had in the fridge.

I love this! I’ll admit I made it with turkey sausage instead (lower fat). I also omitted the jalapeño and halved the pepper flakes to make it milder. The first time I made it exactly as the recipe and it was very spicy, more than my wife likes so. I also used chicken broth instead of water and bullion cubes. It was awesome though! Love it!

After other reviewers mentioned the salt, I read the label of the Cajun seasoning I bought and since it also had salt as the first ingredient I added no more salt to the dish and it was great. I substituted a couple ingredients because of what I had on hand but we thought this was very good, even my son who isn't a fan of leftovers ate it for 3 meals this week!

I've been searching for a recipe for beans and rice that would remind me of what I had in New Orleans.  This is it! I used Aidell's Cajun Style Andouille and also omitted some salt.

I made this and had an infrequent “this is great” from my husband. I used fire roasted tomatoes and minced garlic. I didn’t have jalapeño so I used red pepper. Thanks for this recipe!

My husband and I could eat this every week!  This was so delicious, so flavorful, and it had the perfect amount of heat.  The only thing I did differently was use locally made polish kielbasa instead of store bought smoked sausage.

Turned out excellent.  I did strain off about 3/4 of a cup of the water from the beans and tomatoes just to get it thicker faster.  It’s on our list to make again.

Made it as written except I omitted the jalapeño as I didn't have any, and I used spicy kielbasa. This was SO good, and EASY!! I served it with cheese quesadillas and my whole family loved it! Made enough for 4 servings with enough left over for lunch tomorrow. I'll be adding this to my regular week-day roster!

This dish was a sleeper hit at my recent bbq.  If it wasn't so spicy, I am sure more of my guests would have enjoyed.  Am making it again and this time less heat.  Thanks for a wonderful recipe.

I accidentally put all ingredients in on the 1 st step and then let it simmer on low for about 45 minutes. It was great! Even my young kiddos loved it!

I've made this recipe twice so far and everyone loves it. Very easy to make and delicious. I left out the red pepper flakes as some in the family can't take the heat. I just add a splash of ?? hot sauce at the table.

Delicious! I especially like that the rice was portioned out equally. This recipe sure gives new meaning to the phrase “rice and beans”. I was inspired to search for rice and beans because I recently started Dave Ramsey’s Financial Peace program. Thank you for this tasty treat! I will be making it regularly.

Great recipe! I replaced the boullion and water with two cups of vegetable broth and left out the sausage. Still turned out great!

Remove half the red pepper flakes and cajun seasoning and it'll be tolerable.  Otherwise TOO HOT.  I have a lot is Spanish friends, they tried and and said it is trying too hard to be over the top spicy.  Won't make again.

The snobby part of me didn't think I could make yummy red beans be rice using canned beans. The snobby part of me was wrong. The only thing I altered is that I used my homemade chicken stock instead of bullion (because I had it) and I added a half tsp of thyme. Thyme is a "must" ingredient for red beans and rice so I was a little surprised this recipe didn't call for it. Also, I never add salt while cooking and I use low sodium everything but these were still seasoned enough that nobody in my family added salt to them at the table. I will be making red beans n rice a lot more frequently now that I know I don't have to soak beans over night!

DELICIOUS!!!!  I didn't make any serious changes.  I thought I had jalapeño and realized at the last minute that I didn't so instead of using jalapeño and tomatoes I used a can of Rotel.  I also ended up adding all of the onions and peppers in the first step.  The family raved about it!

Very good but to spicy for my wife.
Next time will sub the following:
1 can mild Rol-Tel Tomatoes
1/2 tbls.Cajun seasoning
No red pepper flakes or add @ table to taste.
Instead of garlic seasoning use fresh garlic
2 stalks of chopped celery
1/4 tsp cayenne pepper

I used only two cans of beans (all we had) and did not separate the onions/green peppers.  I did not use the hot seasonings and did not add extra salt.  We used brown rice instead of white.  Fantastic recipe - the whole family loved it.

My family really likes this dish.  I make it without the hot peppers as I am feeding some little ones that cannot handle spicy dishes.  My husband says, "It's good."  which for him is a compliment and means I need to make it more often.  I appreciate that it is not complicated.

I made this tonight as a side for Jerk Chicken.   It was perfect.   I loved the flavor throughout.   I followed the recipe as written and I didn't see the need to add in any extra salt or pepper.   I will be making this again when I feel the need for Cajun and I won't change a thing.

Made this yesterday with a few changes given the ingredients I had on hand. I used spicy deer mets instead of smoked sausage and used garlic powder and Italian seasoning instead of Mrs. Dash. I didn't add salt given other reviews. Ours was super spicy because of the deer mets but was great!!  We'll definitely make this again. Thanks for sharing!!

I made it lower sodium and loved it. I used low sodium chicken broth instead of the cubes and water. I used lower sodium beans and did not add any salt.
