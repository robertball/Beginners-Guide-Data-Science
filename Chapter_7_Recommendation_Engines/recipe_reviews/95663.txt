This is the same recipe that was given to me when I was a newly wed living in the old Italian neighborhood in Chicago by by landlady.  It is out of this world good - and is one of my favorite comfort foods.  I love it best cold.  Glad to find this recipe again.

This is an old recipe my Grandmother and my Mom make.  The only difference is we also add diced ham to it.  That also makes it great.  It is the best food!

This was ok.  My husband and I both thought this recipe was lacking.  However, it did open my eyes to easter pizza and I will keep looking for the right recipe.  I would like a recipe with different types of meats and different types of cheeses.  The crust was also very bland.  This recipe was not a keeper in my book but I am excited to keep trying and find an easter pizza to my liking.

Pretty good, easy. Added ham & mushrooms as well. Probably won't make again, but worth trying

WAY too much sausage. Even after I drained it, the inside was super greasy and the ratio of sausage to egg to cheese seemed off. I also thought the entire pie lacked flavor. All you could taste was sausage.

this was very good,but I added ham,italian ham(prosuitto)genuoa salami and three different cheeses! To the dough I used eight eggs, four cups flour, one teaspoon vanilla, one teaspoon salt, one cup of sugar and one tbls of baking powder!!! makes for a tastier Easter Pizza!!!
