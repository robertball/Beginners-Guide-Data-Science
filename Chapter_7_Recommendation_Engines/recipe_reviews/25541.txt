I love deviled eggs, but didn't enjoy this recipe much. The barbeque seasoning kind of killed it for me, and the green olives were unneccesary. I also recommend using fresh olives if you're going to add them in. Followed this recipe perfectly, and wasn't happy. My guests weren't either.

The taste was great, but it was WAY too runny!  I would use half the amount of lemon juice and mayo or extra yolks.

I woud just use 2 teaspoons of the lemon juice. And for those complaing about the filling being too soupy, you are probably using the wrong size egg. I like using extra large to jumbo. Men especially love the larger egg!

I don't like deviled eggs, but these were great!  I substituted barbecue sauce for the seasoning because I ran out and used regular style mustard.  It was a little runny because of the extra liquid from the sauce so I reduced the lemon juice to 1 T.   It was still too much for my eggs, though and so after filling them all quite full, I still had a lot left over.  One other thing, I used 1/2 miracle whip and 1/2 mayo.

Not a fan of these. Waste of six eggs. Used the remaining eggs with one tsp mayo 2 tsps water, one tsp dry mustard and salt and pepper to taste. Came out yummy!

We thought these were good! I did halve the lemon juice, and was glad I did b/c it really didn't need the whole amount called for, and that is probably why they are turning out runny for some people. Liked the bbq seasoning in these...even sprinkled some extra on top. I would make these again! Thanks for sharing. :)
