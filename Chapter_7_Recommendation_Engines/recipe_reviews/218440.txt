I made these into miniature desserts to control the portion sizes.  I think this is a quick dessert, but I'm thinking the vanilla pudding gets drowned out by the chocolate, so unless you're going for a layered look (which isn't instructed) it's pointless to use two different puddings.  I cheated and used Reddi whip, instead of making my own whipped cream.

I made a regular pie crust because I don't like graham cracker crust. I have tried this with graham cracker crust but I like the regular pie crust the best. I bake the crust and let it cool before I put the cream cheese and pecans into it.
