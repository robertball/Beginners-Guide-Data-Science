I thought this was really good.  I did take the advise and cut back on the soy sauce and I am glad I did.  I was cooking this in -26' weather so I did not grill it but I did cut it into tender size strips which cut down on marinating time and cooked it for about 5 minutes on the George Foreman Grill.  For added nutrition I used brown rice with carrots, green pepper, celery, and onion with a little bit of olive oil.  I also did not use the same marinade the chicken was in, I made extra sauce and set it aside, the pineapple in the marinade was good on the rice.

This recipe was quick and easy. I marinated the chicken for about an hour and a half. One MAJOR change---I made 1 1/2 times the marinade, as I will NOT reuse marinade that has been used on raw chicken. I went ahead and followed the instructions and boiled it, but I'm not sure what the benefit was there. I took this to a party and it went over great! Everyone loved it. To serve that purpose, I cut the chicken up into chunks, then put it over the rice. This was a great marinade and does great things for the rice, also.

i was looking for something quick and was inspired by this recipe. i put together the marinade portion, adding about a half-cup of water mixed with a tablespoon of cornstarch, which turned the marinade into a silky smooth sauce. then i diced the chicken and sauteed it, adding the sauce and a bunch of precooked rice. i like the combo but would add some red bell pepper next time for color and contrast, and cut WAAY back on the soy sauce (down to a quarter cup, i think). would be good as a tofu marinade for the vegetarians in the house, too.

This was excellent, fast and a nice dinner for a warm summer evening.  As an alternative, I used the chicken, cooked in this manner, then sliced it onto a salad of romaine, mandarine oranges and chow-mein noodles.  Yumm!

i changed the pineapple to a can of cocktail and then reduced the soy sauce to 1/4 cup...sodium is unhealthy!  then i added a can of coconut milk and then stirred everything together into a crockpot and cooked it on high until the chicken was cooked through and served on a bed of brown rice....yum

The family agreed that using store-bought Terriaki would have been much better and, certainly, a lot easier.

i liked this recipe a lot. but i did not like the pineapples.  next time ill use just pineapple juice! i also cut back on the soy sauce (1/4 cup) and use brown sugar instead of white.  o and added and extra tablespoon of bbq sauce (i used a spicy bbq sauce) and a tablespoon of honey. o and i baked the chicken since its too cold out side to grill.  it was very yummy over the white rice and i served w/a side of steamed broccoli.

Nope, sorry.  The chicken was too salty but I could eat it.  The boiled marinade I had to throw out because all I could taste was the salt from the soy. The rest of my family agreed.

nope, sorry, this one is gross.  And I agree with the other reviewer, you should NEVER reuse a chicken marinade.

Delicious!  I actually did a recipe swap with the one and took the marinade and marinated chicken with it for several hours.  I then had my boyfriend grill the chicken and we added a piece of provolone cheese on top and let it melt.  When it was finished cooking we put them onto hogie rolls and it was quite scrumptious!   I will definitely be using this one again in the future!

Great. Very flavorful. I cooked the chicken with the sauce and the rice by itself.

I think I might have added a bit too much curry powder by mistake, but in the end I found it much too over powering. I followed the general idea on the reviews and only used about a third of a cup of Soy Sauce. This recipe just wasn't very good. I ended up throwing it out. The chunks of pineapple just tasted gross with the barbeque sauce and curry and it ended up being a real waste of food after a few mouthfuls and throwing it out. I was watching the movie, "Rumour Has It" while preparing and eating this meal so now I will get horrible flashbacks every time I watch it. :(

We thought this was good although I agree with the pp that there is way too much soy sauce.  I think next time I will also add some bell pepper.  We will make again!

It's rare that I leave a review but..I should have read the reviews first. I followed the recipe exactly, including the 1 cup soy sauce. This was profoundly nasty.  I had been really looking forward to trying this recipe. I believe that it would have been great had I cut back on the soy.  I won't be trying it again though, left a bad taste in my mouth.

I made this for an office party and and it got a ton of complements! I did alter the sauce however.   I omitted the curry because I didn't have any, and I cut back on the soy sauce too.  I also wanted to use fresh pineapple so the marinade didn't have any pineapple juice in it to begin with. But then when I sniffed it I realized it really needed  the sugar in the juice so I added the juice from a can of pineapple that I ran to the store to get.  I baked the chicken in cubes  from the marinade bag.  While the chicken was in the oven I sautéed tricolored bell peppers, the fresh pineapple, and onion in the remainder of the marinade.  Then I put it in an aluminum tin in the fridge overnight, and then baked it for 20 minutes at 300 in the morning to rake the chill off before I brought it to work. People were eating it at 10:30!  Some of my coworkers couldn't wait  until our normal lunch break. You did a great job with this one Shannon thank you so much for sharing!
