Excellent recipe!  I toasted my almonds for added crunch.  Used plain Greek yogurt and added honey.  It complimented the rest of the ingredients.

This is good. I don't usually eat apples in yogurt, so it was a nice change from my usual fruits. I used vanilla yogurt, so I just added maybe a teaspoon of maple syrup just to get a hint of that flavor.

I like the mix of ingredients. The ratio of maple syrup to yogurt was a bit sweet for me but it was well appreciated by my husband (he who owns the sweet tooth). This worked nicely with a pear and trail mix, too. Thank you for the recipe.

Easy and really good. I mixed plain nonfat yogurt with vanilla. The plain gives it more protein and reduces the sugar.

This is so easy and the "Yogurt bowl" is the popular way to serve it now. You just layer the ingredients in rows on top of the yogurt. See the picture... after I did the fruit and nuts and berries I added a touch of melted chocolate instead of honey or other sweetener

So so delicious! I couldn't find good fresh blueberries here in November, so used blackberries. I tossed my apple slices in cinnamon and nutmeg, and drizzled the maple syrup over top the entire dish. Also used Greek yogurt. This was so crazy good it will become a regular breakfast for me. Thanks for this simple, yet filling and healthy breakfast or late night snack idea :)

I didn't have any maple syrup, so I added some stevia and a few drops of maple extract to my plain Greek yogurt. I don't like a heavy breakfast, so this was perfect for me.
