I gave this 5 stars because after I tweeked it a bit it's an awesome recipe. I add 1/2 c. sugar (or to taste) and I add milk instead of the brandy because we don't drink. I also don't mix up the whip topping. I add it to the cream cheese while it's still powder. Then I add milk until it's pudding consistancy. It sets up more while it's in the fridge. It's YUMMY!!

I thought that this recipe came out way too sour.  Perhaps it needs some sugar added.  I really donâ€™t know what would make it better.  I put fresh fruit on top of this cheesecake.  Maybe it would taste better with that sugary cherry pie filling on top.  The recipe was easy to do.

I added 1/2 cup of sugar to the filling as other reviewers suggested. It sure was necessary, it came out just right in sweetness. However, the taste overall was a bit like package cheese cake, nobody was impressed.

Simple to make! Followed advice of previous reviewer & combined powdered topping with milk and cream cheese. Topped with canned blueberries and turned out really pretty good...and this is coming from a person who hates cheesecake!

i followed other reviews and added some sugar to the batter and i left the whipped topping in its powder stage when i mixed it with the cream cheese. I also added a tad bit of reall vanilla to give it just an extra bit of flavor. i just now stuck it in the fridge and i can not wait to eat!

I definitely took the advice of the other reviewers & added some more sugar and omitted the brandy, using vanilla instead.  It was very good but had the consistency of mousse more than cheesecake.

this is a great recipe for something quick and on the go. i found to get rid of the tartness is mix half cup granulated sugar and on 1/4 cup of powderd sugar to take the tartness away. also can jelled fruit such as cherries or strawbarries really helped it out. family loved it.

It's okay but other recipes are better. I added sugar and more cream cheese to the recipe. It's okay for a no bake recipe.

I put toasted coconut in the crust and baked it at 350 for 7 min. using parchment paper to line pan last time it stuck. it was too sweet with 1/2 cup sugar so I will cut it to 1/4 this time.
