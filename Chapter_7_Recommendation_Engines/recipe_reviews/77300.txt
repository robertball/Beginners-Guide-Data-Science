I spent 2 hours looking for a Swirled Cherry Cheesecake recipe that had a good rating..my husband has been craving it for quite some time. This Cheesecake is verrrrry good and beautiful. I did however use a premade g-cracker crust because my husband is not a fan of chocolate..

The cheesecake itself came out great - considerations for change are in the crust, adding in the cherry puree, and in preventing it from falling next time.  The cake itself is delicious - very silky and creamy.  I made it in a heart shaped pan, so I think I had too much of the crumb base and my cooking time took longer than 55 minutes.  I would consider just using a graham cracker crust - the chocolate crust was rather heavy.  Also, I don't think I swirled in my cherry puree thoroughly as some "globs" sank to the bottom and then oozed out of the bottom.  Finally, mine fell when it was cooling so I was diappointed in how it looked.  I will try it again and hopefully have better luck (problems most likely are in the "chef" and in the different sized pan.)

I did not have chocolate cookie crumbs but I did have graham crackers so I threw some in my blender and ground them down to a fine crumb, then mixed with the butter and made a crust out of that. I did not add sugar to the crust ingredients as I had a feeling that the pie would be sweet enough on it's own. I used reduced fat cream cheese, "light" cherry pie filling and fresh squeezed lemon juice. This was well recieved by my husband and two kids, though I thought it was a little too sweet. I also think there was a little too much butter in the crust and my husband did remark on that. I think cutting it back just enough to hold the ingredients together without being greasy is the key--maybe three or four tablespoons instead of 1/3 of a cup. It's quite good, but with a few small tweaks, it might be perfect.

I chose this recipe cause it sounded good and easy to make, which it was very easy. I did not like the flavor of it, the sweet condensed milk is what did it. It totally over powerd all the ingretients. I'm going to try it with heavy wipping cream and sugar and I think it will give it a better taste.

I made this for my husband and kids for Valentine's Day and they thought it was fabulous. I did make a few adjustments though. I didn't need an entire cheese cake for just us so I divided the recipe in half. I used an Oreo ready made crust and then only baked for 40 minutes. Doing it this way I recommend only putting the cherry puree on top and just use what it looks like looks good, then swirl immediately and put in the oven. If you let it set out at all the cherry will fall to the bottom and isn't as pretty. Be sure to turn off oven and temper when you take it out and all the other cheesecake baking recommendations and mine turned out beautiful. I drizzled with chocolate sauce and cherry puree and it plated up beatiful too. They were all impressed and would love to have it again.

I followed this recipe as written and it came out tasty and beautiful. There is another cherry cheesecake by LJ Bryan (don't quote me on name exactly) that works great for a regular pre-made pie crust. This one is perfect for the thicker 9" spring-form pan.

When this recipe is substituted with a store bought ready made crust, there is far too much batter and left over cherry puree.  I would ammend this recipe to specify deep dish glass 9 inch pie dish, or cut the recipe in half.  Otherwise, it is a very easy to make cheese cake with a nice light texture, pretty close to New York style.

The only modification that I made was to make a graham crust instead of a chocolate one.  We loved this cheesecake.  It is beautiful and delicious!  This would be a perfect cheesecake for Christmas, Valentine's Day, or 4th of July.  We just had this as our weekend dessert, and it was gone in 2 days.

this is easier than it sounded I was worried when it looked so runny but it baked up fine I had to much dough due to  I seemed to have miss placed my spring pan, so I used a glass pie plate ,the extra dough/ cheese cake I put in to muffin tins lined with cup cake holders  I also used fresh strawberries from the garden in this receipe. I did due like others said and added the freshly puree strawberries at the end and swirled. I will make this again because my husband liked it so much he promtly went out and bought three sizes of spring form pans lol thank you so much for this reciepe :)

Just made this and it is soooo super yummy. Did take a short cut and make it in a 9" oreo premade pie crust. If you do this too you need to halve the ingredients. I had a ton of batter left over and I hate to waste food. I barely used half the cherry filling for the puree. but once I let it cool in the fridge overnight i topped it with the some of the left over filling and it looked nice with the whole cherrys on top. Next time I will take the time to make the crust myself. enjoy!

Well, folks, it's a winner.  My sister asked for a cherry cheesecake for her birthday and I groaned at the time and effort it would take to produce...not to mention the expense of the recipe I had used for years.  So I looked on this site for alternatives and thought I'd give this one a shot.  I did and it has now replaced my old recipe as my favorite.  I made no changes in the recipe except to make the crust out of leftover shortbread cookie crumbs I had frozen since Christmas.  Plus, I did not want an overpowering chocolate crust to compete with the delicate flavor of the cherries.  I thought about doing a fresh cherry reduction as the swirl, but I was running out of time and cherries were $6/#.  So I used the store brand cherry pie filling.  Gosh, it's a good cheesecake.  Kudos to the developer!  I am a professional caterer/personal chef...I've made a few cheesecakes in my lifetime.  It's a good one.  It's fast and easy and I can see where it would be deliciously adaptable.

I just made this and all I can say is WOW! I had a feeling, like others, that this would be very sweet, so I did go with a graham cracker crust instead of cookies. It baked up beautifully and was a huge hit! I do recommend cutting into small serving sizes as it is very sweet and a little will definitely do ya.

I would say this is a very good recipe!  I baked it a little too long because this was my first cheesecake in a springform pan. 
I used graham crackers instead of chocolate chip.
I would add more than a 1/2 cup of cherry puree between layers next time for a "prettier look".
I put my pan in a water bath using a jelly roll pan as suggested on this site.  It worked nice.  Be sure to use a double layer of foil to prevent water from seeping into the cheesecake.  
Taste was perfect!  I would like to top it with un-pureed cherry pie filing next time just to get the "pretty" look.

This is a delicious cheesecake.  It is not too sweet and has a wonderful cherry taste.  I did not add the sugar to the wafer crumbs and butter.  My family found the bottom sweet enough without the sugar.  Will definitely make again.

Be careful if you make this in a 9" pie dish. The crust is very buttery and will tend to seep out. If it lands on the element you'll notice little spits of fire popping up. I had to be very thorough about opening up the oven and wiping the butter off of the edges with a cloth.

the filling was a bit thick so it was hard to swirl it without it sinking so I made a second and made the crust, put the filling then filled the cheesecake and what was left of the filling I swirled it around so that way you every bite had cherry in it but everyone loved this recipe.

Made two of these.  One for a Christmas treat for our wonderful neighbors and one for our Christmas Eve dinner.  It was ok, not the best cheesecake I have ever made.  Nothing I would make again.

I loved this cheesecake! I didn't have chocolate wafers so made the crust with vanilla wafers and cocoa powder. I was mostly impressed with the consistency of the cheesecake mixture and how the cherry puree didn't sink to the bottom when I poured it in; I was actually able to make four layers and marble it! Thank you for the recipe.

Loved this cheesecake! I used chocolate graham crackers to make the crust. What a lovely, tasty and pretty cheesecake!
