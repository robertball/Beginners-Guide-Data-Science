These are quite heavy and very egg-y compared with my English Nana’s recipe which calls for 1/2 cup each water and milk and 2 eggs. And we always use butter. Using fat was something she thought poor people used because they couldn’t afford butter and it just wasn’t proper, lol. When I make them with Nan’s recipe, they come out already in the shape of cups. There’s no poking needed, and it’s light and crispy yet still very soft. These are ok, though.

These ended up turning out well despite the mess.  I used oil since my roast didn't produce enough fat.  I questioned the amonnt of oil needed in each muffin cup (used a pan for large muffins)...should have trusted my instincts because a tablespoon of oil was WAY too much and made a huge smokey mess in the oven.  I think 1 teaspoon of oil would be plenty since there was 1/4 inch of oil left in each tin and 1/4 inch had bubbled out to the bottom of my oven.

It was awesome.  I read somewhere if you don't have beef fat that you can use butter instead.....but I haven't tried it yet.
