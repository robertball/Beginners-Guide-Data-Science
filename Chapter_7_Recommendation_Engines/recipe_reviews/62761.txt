We loved this.  I made a few minor changes: 1) substituted olive oil for the veg oil, 2) substituted a can of diced tomatoes, drained, and 3) added 1 clove of minced garlic with the onions.  My husband and I ate it all during dinner tonight.  A keeper!!!

easy, light, and flavorful summer side dish.  Used EVOO and added some garlic minced.  Sauteed the onion w/some sweet red peppers.  Seeded the roma tomatoes to take away some of the bitterness and reduce water content.  summer squash have a higher water content.  Added just a touch of brown sugar to cut down on the tartness.  Salt and pepper. Used fresh basil and fresh chopped parsley. pretty color combinations also.  Served w/jasmin rice and nice complimentary side dish to baked tilapia.

I have to admit I am not a big zuccini or yellow squash fan but I wanted to use a few up so I tried this recipe.  Well I have made it twice in two days!  It is soooo good.  I didn't have any fresh tomatoes so I used 2 cans of Rotel canned tomatoes with chili peppers - WOW.  I also eliminated some of the oil because I am on weight watchers.  Thanks for this recipe!!

This was a great way to use the fresh veggies when you tire of the same-ole-same-ole. I used more garlic and didn't cook it as long -- so that the veggies didn't get mushy. The best part was I actually got TWO meals from this recipe: the next night I put the leftovers in a skillet and added more fresh tomatoes, basil, garlic, pepper, and a bit of water and served it over hot angel hair pasta. Yummy! Thanks for the recipe.

I didn't think I liked squash until I made this for my boyfriend!  It was really good, and the only change I made was adding garlic (because I add it to practically everything).

OMG this was awesome!  I never liked squash before but this was soooo delicious.  My neighbor gave me some summer squash today and I looked to this sight for a recipe to fix some for dinner.  I made it as written except I didn't have any zucchini so I used all summer squash and I added some fresh garlic.  I will be making this again and again and again.

Summerly Squash Haiku: "Could've been awesome. But never tender enough. Just change the method." I halved the recipe, but followed exactly as written (fresh basil > dried), and the cover-reduce to low-simmer for 20 min. (especially w/ 1/2" thick slices) just didn't get them tender enough. Don't get me wrong - I love an al dente hunk of squash, but these, while light and flavorful, were still too tough for us. I'd rather stick to traditional sauteeing (in EVOO, not veg oil) at med. heat, and not cover and simmer.

Love this squash recipe!  I did make adjustments based on what I had and preferences.  I used a can of seasoned tomatoes, drained, plus minced garlic, and oregano.  I didn't use as much onions as the recipe called for, and I used frozen ones as I am not a fan of onion.  This turned out great, I have made it a couple of times this summer and even those that don't like squash went back for seconds.

Really great recipe! I'll make this again and again! I sauteed minced garlic with the onion, used fresh minced basil  and left out the bay leaf. I'm very glad to find this simple, delicious and low fat dish. Oh yeah and I only had zucchini so it was just zucchini, onion and fresh tomatoes, but I'm sure squash would be the same.

4.5 is a more accurate rating. I LOVED this dish, and my husband did too!! That was shocking. I used the matchstick shape veggies like other users suggested for faster cooking time and added an extra tomato. I also added 2 cloves of fresh garlic and I think that was a good addition. I sprinkled a little grated parm over the top and it was so good!! Excellent way to use up those summer veggies! Definitely make again.

So great as a light lunch. Vegan too! 

I added garlic and used fresh basil and cherry tomatoes. 

Will definitely make again.

This was a very good side.  I followed the directions mostly except I used olive oil instead of veg oil.  And I used tomato basil garlic Mrs. Dash instead of dried basil.  I will make it again,  everyone ate it.

This was GREAT!!!!!!! I didn't have tomatoes, which I know is a main ingredient, but I added half a green bell pepper (I added it in at the same time the tomato would be added) and the taste was amazing. I also added two pieces of garlic which I simmered with the onion. I also didn't have a bay leaf, so I used some Italian seasoning and a pinch of red chili powder for an extra kick. I really enjoyed it and so did my mother who kept complimenting it. I cut the original recipe in half to serve 3 because it was just the two of us, and we finished the whole pan.

I just made this again for my lunch, and I couldn't help to think It would make an AMAZING vegetable panini with some grilled sliced bread topped with some sort of white cheese. YUM!!!!!!! I would have done it if I had some white cheese, maybe pepperjack for me since I like spice : D

This was great. Except for the yield. I'm one of those starving college students so I don't exactly have the luxury of a large skillet. I used a sautee pan, so the measurements were a little bit off but it still came out yummy. I ended up with too many tomatoes and chunky squash. Recommend slicing the squash and zucchini into strips instead of rounds as I did. And if you're going to overdo anything, go with onion; it adds to everything else and it's the base so you'll stop yourself from going overboard anyway.

We enjoyed this.  I used 1 tablespoon of olive oil and 1 tablespoon of butter and added some minced garlic. I think next time I will add a tablespoon of dry white wine.

This was really good. Didn't have zucchini so I substituted with fresh mushrooms. Olive oil, garlic, a little fresh grated parmesan over the top. Yummy. Even in winter. :-)

I served this over spaghetti.  Because I used canned tomatoes I didn't need to add sauce.  It was perfect and light.  I may add mushrooms next time.

We found this recipe several years ago, and now it is our favorite way to use the squash and zucchini from our garden.  Sometimes we use Italian seasoning instead of the basil and bay leaf.

3 and a half stars, actually. This dish has potential, but the basil is too overpowering for a side dish. Maybe reincarnated as a ratatouille.

This is so full of flavor! It's a real keeper. The tomatoes add SO much more than I imagined reading the recipe. I may even try this with cherry or grape tomatoes sometime. I will also try using a steak rub as called for in the original recipe since this time I used McCormick Grill Mates Mesquite seasoning instead of a steak rub. My husband raved about it with each bite. Yum!

Delicious!! I didn't have a squash but followed the rest of the recipe as directed. I ended up eating this solo as a side dish but the kids really enjoyed it over penne noodles. Added this to my recipe box.

Used Heirloom tomatoes and squash from the Farmers Market.  Also added parmeasan cheese and it was great.

Excellent.  My two year old even ate this, and it's usually a battle to get her to eat vegetables.

My dinner guests also complimented me on this dish - and it makes your kitchen smell wonderful while it's cooking.

My son and my husband gave this recipe 4 stars, I myself would give it 3 stars. It tasted pretty good but was not very attractive to look at. I think I would try it again with diced onion instead of sliced, the slice onion made it look kind of messy.  I would cut down on the basil to 1/4 teaspoon. It was easy to make.

really easy and delicious recipe to get some veggies into the family.  Easily the best part of this dish was the tomatoes and onions.  They became like a chunky pizza sauce with a strong basil taste.  Did not change anything to the recipe.

A great and healthy way to use up those batches of summer veggies. I used a small can of Rotel tomatoes including the liquid instead of fresh tomatoes. The only other change I made was at the very end of cooking I put about 1/4 cup of parmesan cheese on top - melted that and served.

Tasty fresh side dish for summer! I skipped the bay leaf, used fresh basil, and sprinkled some feta cheese on top. The sweet basil with the salty feta was a great combo and helped add extra flavor to the veggies.

This is wonderful! I have made something similar many times in the past but never with the tomatoes. The addition of the tomates was awsome!! Lucky for me, I have my own garden tomatoes. I also subbed Italian Seasoning for the bay leaf, just because I like it that way and it adds a bit more flavors. I also added garlic. A person could add some sweet peppeprs too for fun. Thanks for the great recipe.

My wife and I loved this dish! If possible use veggies fresh from a garden or at least a farmer's market. I also substituted the vegetable oil with olive oil and added minced fresh garlic. We had it with fish tacos. Dinner was delicious!

I didn't like this very much. It was ok, but certainly not what I was hoping for. It turned out so bland! I added more salt and pepper and topped it off with Parmesan cheese, but it still lacked something. I probably won't be making this again.

Enjoyed this very much! It was a good contrast to some baked chicken in cream sauce. (I would maybe cut back a tad on the salt next time...but my husband loved the salt, so that might just be me!)

I tried this because I had quite a bit of squash and zucchini left in my garden. I substituted the fresh tomatoe for canned ones and this turned out great. I didn't have a bay leaf but this turned out fantastic anyway. I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil too. My children added some shredded mozzarella and grated parmesan cheese to theirs. I will definately make this a family favorite recipe and make it often during the upcomming summers as well. Thank you for such a practical recipe. Serve this with pasta and it'll stretch for unexpected guests or children who love pasta too (of all ages). YUMMERS

This was very tasty.  I added 1 garlic clove to the onion and I used fresh basil and I added a little more tomato.  I would cut zucchini and squash into almost matchstick size next time, to cook it faster.  I served over pasta. Fantastic!

I am always looking for a new way to cook. This was very easy to do and very filling. I added salt and pepper and next time I will add in garlic to give it a more flavorful taste. I would have givenit 4 & 1/2 stars but I don't have that option.

My hubby that is not all that fond of summer squash found it to be a keeper. He likes his food a tad blander than I do....he likes it as is. I would like it better (and I am doing the rating!) a bit more with a bit of garlic an parm cheese as another poster suggested.

When I sold my house and bought a condo, I didn't miss mowing, but was sad not having a garden. Well, now I have the most beautiful vegetable garden grown in big pots on the balcony. As an empty nester, I had way too much so this recipe was a great find. Got to use my fresh zucchini, summer squash and tomatoes. I used fresh herbs from the balcony, and as everyone here has...garlic sauted with the onions. To use up an overflowing pot of spinach I also added that right at the end of the simmering. My daughter came for dinner and I seved this over penne pasta for a main dish. A terrific recipe for a vegetarian. This was spectacular, thanks

I followed the recipe with two changes. I added garlic to the onions and in the end I topped it off with reduced fat feta cheese. Then I served it with whole wheat linguine. It was fantastic!!

Perfect as is.  The only substituion I made was to add some fresh garlic when cooking the onion and I used E.V.O.O. instead of vegetable oil.  Served over homemade gnocchi.  DELICIOUS!

We don't normally eat squash but I had been given some yellow squash and needed to figure out what to do with it.   This was very easy and tasty.  I only had yellow squash, green beans and onion so that's what went in the skillet.  I used a can of diced tomatoes instead of fresh.  We'll be adding squash to the veggie rotation!

This was a hit at our family reunion. I ommitted the bay leaf and added some garlic. Thanks for sharing.

Very tasty use of my garden veggies!  I really think the bay leaf adds another dimension.  I, as many others, did an some minced garlic to the onion.  YUM!

Very good.  I added a little garlic powder and forgot the bay leaf.  Really tasty.  I served over brown rice with a roast chicken.  Yum!

My kids usually refuse zucchini so when they asked what they were eating I told them "summer squash".  They told me how much they liked it.  My youngest said "Hey, that looks like zucchini, not squash!"  Busted!  Anyway, we all enjoyed it very much.  Used all zucchini, no yellow squash and added two tsp minced fresh garlic.

I had three small zucchini and a couple of tomatoes that needed to be used, so this recipe was perfect!  It turned out pretty good.  I did add some minced garlic but nothing else 'extra'.  I've never made squash this way, and it was better than expected.

You know just 5 years ago, I didn't eat any kind of vegetable that wasn't starchy.  Now I can't get enough.  I like them cooked or raw, and this is an AMAZING!!! dish for me to add to my veggies....Thanks...

This was a delicious side dish! I made the following changes and it still worked wonderfully: I ommitted the onion but instead used about a teaspoon of freshly minced garlic, I didn't have fresh bay leaves, so I used a half teaspoon of dried bay leaves, finally, I added more salt to taste after stirring in the zucchini and squash. It was fantastic!

I didn't have yellow summer squash so I didn't use it. I made the tomato pieces a bit bigger and just added more. I also don't like onion chunks so used onion powder instead. I did like this for the most part but felt it could have used more seasoning. My husband didn't seem to like it but he isn't a big vegetable fan. Overall I'd say I'd make it again if I could find a way to season it more.

We thought this was just o.k. It needs some added spices to it. I'll make it again, but tweak the recipe a little.

Since my father-in-law considers tomatoes and zucchini the food of the gods, I had to try this one.  I used the receipe as is, to serve six; there were five for dinner and not one spoonful was left.  It has now been saved to my recipe box.  Thanks, Squeakychu!

The only change I made was using a little butter instead of oil to cook the onions. Leftovers are good, too.

Other than there being too much oil, this was an excellent dish and full of flavor.  I will definitely make again, only next time, I'll cut the oil in half.  Thanks for sharing!

Wonderful!  Thank you.  I've made this twice now and it was a hit both times.  The second time I didn't have enough tomato so I used italian stewed tomatos.  Very, very good.

Terrific! I didn't use the bay leaf because I fogot to, and used lots of fresh basil instead of dried. Perfect! Nothing beats the old tomato-garlic-basil combo. Very nice, highly recommended.

I loved this recipe! I added a 1/4 cup of white wine mixed with one tsp of vegetable base and also added 2 minced garlic. I simmered uncovered until all liquid was almost completely evaporated.  It was awesome!

Delicious and healthy, too! I used a can of Italian stewed tomatoes in place of the fresh. Cut back on the dried basil because of the flavorings in the tomatoes. I subbed olive oil for the veg oil. Added a little brown sugar to cut the acidity of the tomatoes. Cooking time was just about right. I've been having it as a side dish heated, but it probably could be eaten cold, too. Thanks for the great recipe!

We really enjoyed this. I was looking for a recipe for summer squash that needed to be used up. I only had 2 yellow squash and maybe 1/4 purple onion and no tomatoes. I used olive oil, the purple onion and some frozen chopped onion, and added garlic. I had some leftover spaghetti sauce in the fridge, so I added some in place of the tomatoes. It was delicious!  Thanks for the recipe!

Adjusted slightly. Used olive oil, added a few minced cloves of garlic and a little oregano. Excellent side dish, I make this frequently.

I followed the directions and it was delish! I'll definately make this again but I probably will not cook it the full 20 minutes as I prefer my veges a little crunchy.

I loved this recipe.  Had some yellow and zucchini squash on hand and wanted to use it up.  Reheated, it was still yummy.  Will be making this again.

Love squash and zucchini and will make again.  Two bay leaves as shown in one photo and increase the seasonings.  Vey pretty with the tomatoes.....add more garlic powder or salt to taste..Omit fresh tomatoess and use canned, diced instead..much better as fresh loses color and texturee in cooking

I made the recipe initially as directed only I didn't cook them for as long as long as directed because I hate mushy vegetables. It was okay, but I found it a bit too bland for my taste. I added garlic and more basil and some feta cheese on top. That made it better.

Easy recipe. I didn't have onion.  I added orange bell pepper, thyme and shredded carrots. Also, at the last 5 mins, I added fresh cilantro to give it a little something extra. I would make it again but as more salt for my taste.

This was made for a side dish to our Easter Ham and complimented it well. It wasn't the most beautiful dish, but tasted good. I did substitute canned diced tomatoes in place of fresh and added garlic. I did cook it slightly longer to soften the veggies more as my family isn't big on firm veggies.

I am sure that this is fabulous as is but, I had no tomatoes!   I did, however, have zucchini and squash that I needed to use NOW.  I searched for recipes and found this one ..... I sauteed the onion, added chopped garlic, then added the sliced zucchini and summer squash.  Kosher salt/pepper.  Yum!  No disrespect to the originator, but I just had to share and hope most can appreciate these "crisis" moments in the kitchen.     I gave five stars based on the proportions and combination of ingredients alone, plus the other stellar reviews.  I promise to make "as written" and will give another review then.  Squeakychu:  my deepest compliments to you and know that you inspired me in a critical moment!

I'm not a fan of squash but I liked this!.  I needed a recipe to use up a bunch of yellow squash and eggplant that was going bad.  I peeled the squash and eggplant.  I didn't have zucchini so I subbed in cubed eggplant, used 2 med onions+  4 cloves garlic and a yellow pepper.  Pleasantly surprised.  :)

I halved this recipe for my husband and I, followed the recipe with no changes -- delicious! I ate the leftovers cold for lunch the next day, still nummy! This is a great side veggie dish that I'm going to make again this week, a real keeper.

I usually don't like cooked squash because of how mushy it can get, but a thicker slice seemed to help maintain some crunch. The flavors were to die for, and I used a shallot instead of a regular onion to give it a stronger onion flavor. I also cooked it in coconut oil and used a no salt seasoning plus the pepper and salt. It was the best cooked squash recipe I have tasted ever!

Used diced tomatoes (flavored with oregano and basil) instead of fresh.  Had to cook much longer than the stated time of 20 minutes.  I thought it was just okay.  The next day, I smothered the leftovers with shredded parmesan and tons of mozzarella and put it in the microwave to melt the cheese.  It was WONDERFUL.  I definitely recommend adding cheese!  Provolone would be delicious, too.

This recipe was really yummy! I did not have any zucchini so I used just yellow squash. The only thing different that I did was add garlic salt..... Garlic is great in everything. I will definitely make this again.

Yum!  Sliced the onions extra thin to get more juice out of them and omitted the salt.  This dish still had PLENTY of flavor!  Maybe a bit much squash; I used one medium squash and one medium zucchini and it seemed to be the perfect mix.  If I make it again, I'll probably add a pinch of minced garlic to it as well.

Used Olive oil instead and added some minced garlic per others suggestions.  I didn't use a bay leaf since I didn't have one on hand.  Was really good!  Even my husband who rarely eats vegetables enjoyed it.

Best squash I have ever made!! I used olive oil, minced onion (since I was out of fresh), a bit of garlic, and a dash of salt along with the basil... I also left out the tomatoes since I don't care for them. I absolutely loved it. NONE left!!!!

Great!  I had a lot of squash, so I subbed one can tomato sauce plus one can diced tomatoes for the chopped, fresh tomatoes.  I used fresh basil rather than dried, added a few cloves of minced garlic with the onions, and grated the squash rather than slicing it.  I served it over spaghetti with some grated parmesan on top - really good!

A very tasty dish! I didn't have zucchini, basil or the bay leaf, so just used salt & pepper and 1/2 tsp. red chili pepper along with fresh garlic (3 cloves, crushed & sauteed with the onions). I also added a sliced green pepper in for colour with the squash and it turned out great. We had it as a main dish served over rice and was very delicious. A great new way to use squash. Thanks!

This is really good. I added an 8oz can of tomato sauce, couple cloves of garlic (sauteed with onion) and then served over pasta.

Really three and a half stars.  Nice flavor, very savory.  If you like the texture of cooked squash, you will like this.  Made as is, except to add garlic w/ the onion.

I'm rating this recipe as it was written. I found it a little bland and a little dry.  I think the substitution of canned, undrained tomatoes would add some moisture.  The parmesan cheese some reviewers suggested would probably give it the needed touch to not be bland.

In terms of easiness, it was brilliant! I made it with spaghetti squash instead of summer squash (totally different, i know!) and it was delicious.  I added a bit of water to the tomato/onion mixture, and cooked the spaghetti squash separately, mixing them together after both were fully cooked... I would definitely recommend adding parmesan cheese on top, it needs a bit of extra flavour in my mind!

Delicious! Followed recipe, except for adding 2 of the small green squash (not sure what they are called, I think maybe patterpan?) in place of one of the zucchini, turned out great!

I LOVE this recipe. I almost rated it 4 stars because my husband didn't like it. However, he only likes fried squash. I guess it's the texture he didn't like. But I give it a definite 5 star. I used one can of Rotel and one can of tomatoes with bell peppers and onions. Everything else was the same. We ate it over spaghetti with a small amount of shredded cheese on top...Yummy!

This has been very well received amongst my family members. My father in particular loves this over angel hair pasta, and coming from an Italian man whose mother is a marvelous cook, that's quite a compliment! I make this using fresh herbs - a little parsley thrown in with the rest gives it a nice taste. Thanks for giving me another way to use my insane kitchen garden harvest!

This is a good dish. I made it as the recipe stated, except for adding a little garlic. I will be making it again. It's a great way to use up some squash. Don't you just love summer, with all these great vegtables

This was a perfectly delicious way to use the veggies from my garden this year and still be able to taste them rather than disguising the taste in a casserole or whatnot.  I followed the recipe exactly except that I used olive oil rather than vegetable oil. It was really yummy and was a great side to go along with the highly rated "Chicken Florentine" recipe on this site! Hubby and I both enjoyed it!

Excellent (with a few changes)! I substituted olive oil for the vegatable oil and added a little minced garlic for a little more flavor. My family loved it! Will make again.

I made this recipe but with different seasonings. I used sea salt, olive oil, crushed red pepper and two dashes of basalmic vinegar to give the dish a Mediterranean flavor.

This is a great recipe that doesn't alter the taste of the fresh veggies. I omitted the tomato, sliced fresh mushrooms, and used dried spices. I think a bit of Parmesean cheese would add to the dish.

A little bland... I added some oregano and basil to the recipe.
