Great soup. It is thick, so some people might prefer more broth. The only change I made was I cooked the beans, rather than using canned. In order to lower sodium, I cooked them without salt. It is very hearty, with lots of flavor.

5+ stars.  Made as written, my only negative would be that this soup is very thick.  Next time I may add another can of broth.  Do not thaw the collard greens, just drop them in the soup when ready.  I think the juices from the collard greens is what makes the soup!!!  Definite keeper!!

I used white canellini beans and venison sausage.  Flavoring was just right!

An unusually rainy day in Arizona. This soup made the day. Very easy to make, very tasty, very filling soup.
