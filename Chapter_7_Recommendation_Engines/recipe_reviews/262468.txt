Made this soup for Christmas dinner and it was a huge hit!!  I did make a few adjustments:  I browned 3 hamhocks in the Instant Pot and then actually cooked it in a large pot on the stove.  Also, instead of shredded carrots, I just used a ½ bag of baby carrots, chopped.

Instead of the 6 cups of chicken broth, I used 6 cups of water and 4 heaping tablespoons of “Better than Bouillon” chicken flavor from Costco .

Instead of dried navy bean, I used 6 cans of white beans, drained and rinsed.

I didn’t have diced tomatoes, so I used a 14.5 ounce can of stewed tomatoes with Italian herbs.

Even the kids loved it!  I will definitely make this again!  Thanks for the recipe!

This was great!   I used 8 cups of water and 8 bouillon cubes instead of chicken broth.  Also used a bag of 15 beans  instead of Navy.

Way too much thyme for us.  It overwhelmed the taste and smell of everything else.  Next time I'll cut the thyme back to 1/4 teaspoon and improvise with some other spices.

I made this the original way the first time. The second time I used bacon instead of ham—chopped it into bits and cooked it, used the drippings to cook the veggies. Very good!

This was delicious. I used a 16oz bag of navy beans and, when I added the ham and tomatoes, I added additional broth for more liquid.

Very good recipe, I followed it except I added a dash of Liquid Smoke and Worcestershire Sauce to the soup, it was great!!

I did add 10 more minutes to the final cook after adding the ham and tomatoes to make the beans softer and another cup of water to make the soup runnier.

Okay I used home grown northern beans. It definitely needed more time. I added an additional 10 minutes of pressure after the tomatoes/ham step and a cup of water. And left natural pressure release for 20 minutes. It still could have used another 5 minutes of pressure cooking. I am not sure if the air pressure of a snow storm affected the cooking time or if it was the type of beans. I was hoping for a richer brothy soup. I am thinking soaking beans over night next time first.

Great recipe! I chopped the carrots into small pieces instead of shredding them and they cooked up just fine. I had to add another 7 minutes to the cooking time because not all the beans were tender enough for us, but after that, they were perfect! The flavor is rich and seasoned just right. We will definitely make this again!

Have a 3-qt instant-pot so cut recipe in half.   So nice to be able to make this soup without hours of soaking the beans! 
 Exceptions:  I used 4 cups chicken broth after reading other reviews about the beans soaking up all the liquid.  Not a problem - used baby navy beans.  Also did not use the paprika, thyme, or tomatoes to suit our personal preference.    Flavor and texture were perfect for us.  This recipe definitely goes into the "keeper" "will do it again" files.

The soup is delicious!  I made the soup exactly how the recipe said.  On Step 4, I got 2 "Burn" errors because the soup was so thick.  The soup ended up being cooked without finishing Step 4.  The next time that I make this, I will only use a 16 oz bag of beans, in hopes that the soup  would not be as thick.

Pared this down to accommodate my 12 oz. bag of beans.  Turned out great!  I love my Instant Pot...Recipes that used to take hours can be made with minimal planning.  Thank you for this great recipe!

I followed the recipe except I added  ham hocks to first pressurized cooking time, which gave the beans  more ham flavor. Also added more liquid. Next time I will use fewer beans.

I made a few minor changes.  The beans i used came in 16 ounce packages.  I used two.  Because of the extra beans i used two full cartons, 8 cups, of broth.  When I went to my store they were out of small quantities of ham, but they had 1 pound of pork loin strips on a deep discount.  I cut this into small chunks and sauted with the veggies.  It worked great.  I altered the spices slightly using 1/2 tsp "sweet" paprika, 1/2 tsp thyme, 1/2 tsp rosemary, and a bay leaf..  this all turned out great and is my new go to Navy bean soup.

This is simple and delicious!  I replaced the navy beans with great northern beans since my store didn’t have navy beans. I also used a little extra chicken broth to get more “soup”.  My family loved it!  I will definitely be making this again.

Perfect basic navy bean and ham soup recipe. There is nothing more comforting.

This recipe was easy and came out pretty well.  I diverged from using navy beans and used a 15-bean mix, which resulted in a thick broth and burn warnings during the second pressure-cook period, so I won't try that again, but the soup tasted good without that going as planned.

Would make it 1 1/2 lbs of ham, more celery and carrots.
Four cloves of garlic, and try to add more tomatoes possibly a 28 ounce can.

I substituted giant white dried lima bea ns for the little navy beans because I love them :-) This required 2 extra cups of chicken stock or else it was too thick. 
As well I think cutting the thyme in half would make this recipe perfect, as good as it is  right now.  For my taste the thyme was a bit too strong as the recipe currently sits right now. 
It's also possible the thyme I got was just a little stronger than the authors.  Other than that the recipe was excellent!! Thx for sharing!

I pre-made this for later in the week for a dinner after karate class.  OMFG!!!!  Best ham soup I have tasted in a very long time.  This should/will be a keeper for our household.

This is really great navy bean soup.  My husband asked me to use this recipe in the future--not the one I've been using for more than 30 years!!!  The only changes I made was to cook out the ham bone and adding ham base in place of the chicken broth.

I added extra ham and a bay leaf as a personal preference, but otherwise followed the recipe. The soup won praises from my husband who would live on ham and bean soup. The beans were really tender.

I used 2lbs of beans, 2 qt. chicken broth,  1.5 lbs of ham might use 3 lbs next time and 3 - 14.5 cans of diced tomatoes . I also doubled the amount of seasonings. I will make it again.

This was very good, although I did not add the carrots, tomatoes or celery and I thickened the broth. I did not saute the onions, Just combined the rest of the ingredients and set the timer.  I wanted a recipe that was close to what I grew up with. It  brought  back many warm memories of my childhood. Thanks!

The ingredients in this recipe are spot on for my taste.  I made this in the Instant Pot.  The cooking time is listed as 34 minutes with natural pressure relief.  My beans were not done at 34 min. and they soaked up most of the stock.  So I added 2 more cups of stock, re-pressurized for another 10 minutes and did a quick pressure relief. Came out perfect.  Not a big deal. Maybe I just like my beans a little softer.  The Instantpot website lists navy bean cooking time as 20-25 which is even less.  I also don't know why the beans absorbed so much stock.   I did use a can of roasted garlic diced tomatoes because I had them and a little less garlic.

I added chicken to this to increase the protein and some additional spices. It's a very flexible base to work with so definitely experiment with flavorings to your liking.
