Baked these for my daughters kindergarten class and they were a huge hit, also very easy to bake! I used frosting instead of using the whipped topping mixture.... YUM!

Brought these to a super bowl party-gone before the pizza and wings. I made 1/2 with berry Oreos and 1/2 with original.  I do not recommend using flavored Oreos, they don't peel out of the wrapper well and get very hard.
