I followed this recipe precisely, except that I added a lot more worchestershire sauce and brown sugar, because I wanted a really strong flavor. I cooked my steaks over the stove with diced onion and green pepper, and poured the sauce over it as it cooked. the steak was flavorful and juicy, def. a favorite at our house now.

Used 1 TBS minced garlic, doubled lemon juice, worcestershire sauce and olive oil and added  1/2 tsp dry mustard.  Served over a bed of steamed spinach and topped with the sauce and sauted veggies (mushrooms, bell peppers and onions) on the side served twice baked mashed potatoes. So, so good and so easy. Most of the prep was done ahead.

All I can say is "Oh My God!!" This is absolutely  outstanding. I changed only one thing, because I didn't have fresh thyme leaves, I used a 1/2 teaspoon of dried thyme and it came out wonderful. I'm a man and I love cooking for my wife and 5 kids. Everyone raved about this. Thanks for a very different, but creative recipe!! Will make this a weekly steak dish.

This was yummy! My husband made it with double the amount of worcestershire sauce and thyme. He also substituted the tomato soup with italian diced tomatoes. He mashed them slightly just to leave some little hunks of tomato in it instead of huge pieces. IT WAS DELISH!!!

Was just ok. The cut of meat mentioned was very tough. I'll try this with another cut in the future.

This was VERY simple to make- all ingredients are in the pantry!  I have never made a steak with Tomato Soup before. I did heavily pepper both sides of the steak before grilling with course ground black pepper.  The recipe is definately worth trying.  If you are looking for something REALLY tangy you will need to spice this one up.

We absolutely loved the sauce - it was sweet and tangy & a really nice change. I cooked a sirloin tip roast in the oven with this sauce. Unfortunately the steak was tough. Next time I make it, which I will because the sauce is so good, I'm going to double the sauce and cook my roast in the slow cooker to tenderize it more.

Next time I'll use a better cut of meat.  I marinated the meat before grilling.

I followed the receipe exactly and was not impressed. It was just ok and tasted sort of like barbecue ribs. Will not make this again.

Although I made it exactly as stated, the tomato soup was overpowering and left the house smelling strong. It also made the meat taste somewhat raw, or fishy. I won't make this again. My husband had to come in and rescue me by throwing spices in.

The beef still tasted like beef unless I dunked each piece in the remaining sauce. I won't make this again.
