I made four of these little gems last night. I did not add the additional sugar to any of the four apples and I used dried blueberries only because I didn't have any dried cranberries. I used Pinata apples which are very sweet on their own, baking them only made them sweeter which made me glad I didn't add the sugar. The only person who did not like this dessert was my husband. The kids and I REALLY liked ours. Great low-calorie dessert that was simple to make with on hand ingredients. I'm SO making this again.

I love baked apples and this looked pretty simple so I had to give this a try and I'm glad I did.  I cut back on the sugar a bit and used brown instead of white.  You could easily sub raisins for the cranberries or add some nuts if you like.  These smelled very good and once they came out of the oven I drizzled them with a little caramel sauce.  Perfect with vanilla ice cream and a bit of whipped cream on top!

Well I was in the mood for a fall desert and needed something to keep the kids busy tonight while dinner was cooking. I am not a big fan of baked apples unless they are very sweet, so I came across this recipe and liked the combination of Cranberries and apples.  I made a couple changes. First being that I made it for 3 apples instead of just 1, so I tripled all ingredients. I have no nutmeg, so I substituted 1 tsp. of dark brown sugar to make the apple sweeter. I also had no dried cranberries on hand, so I used a Tlbsp. of canned cranberries. Everything else I followed, including cooking times.  The family LOVED these. They were perfectly sweet topped with some cool whip and some of the extra sugar mixture on top to make it look pretty.  I am going to try some oats on top or graham cracker crumbs to give it a different texture, because I am a huge fan of apple crisp.  All in all, this is an EXTREMELY simple and delicious dish that can be thrown together quickly, and is something the kids can help with. It cooked while we ate dinner. Just great.

I loved this recipe, and will definitely be using it again.  I used Honeycrisp apples, which are large and very light of texture, and they bake beautifully. A couple of other reviewers mentioned texture problems with the filling; I did not have that problem.  The filling was creamy, rich, and oozed deliciously over the tender apple flesh; broken open with a spoon.  Next time, I may hollow out a slightly larger cavity in the apple, sacrificing a little bit of apple flesh to have more room for filling.

Just made this. It was delicious! This is a real keeper!!  I used Splenda brown sugar and fat free cream cheese to lighten it up. Since I don't like the texture of cream cheese, I threw in about 2 T of oatmeal. It was perfect. My husband gave it a "10".

I used Splenda and Raisins, and I added a tiny bit of flax. Delicious!

This is not the prettiest dessert, but it tastes very good! I followed the directions exactly. The only difference was that after adding half of the sugar mixture to the cream cheese, there was really more left than I needed. Even after sprinkling some in the cavity and some on top, I still had some left over. Mine did collapse a bit during baking (35 min). All in all, this was a tasty treat. I will probably make it again.

This was a delicious treat! I used brown sugar instead of nutmeg and half mayo half cream cheese for the filling. I found, like some other reviewers, that I had quite a bit of the sugar mixture at the end.. maybe because I was using small apples? Next time I'll cut back on those measurements, but I will definitely be making this again.. yum!

I love baked apples, I love cheesecake, so I thought I would love this hybrid.  They smelled great baking.  I was disappointed to find that my fillin had taken on a rubber-like consistency in the oven.  Not very appetizing....

I was looking for a more traditional style of baked apple like the kind my Mom used to make.  This looked interesting though so I tried it.  I should have stuck with my gut.  Though the flavors were great - the extra filling made a great cream cheese spread - the texture difference between the apple and the filling was not.

I used a rather large apple and the stuffing didn't come close to filling it.  The flavor was just ok.  I did use weight watchers cream cheese and raisins so maybe that made a difference.  It was also hard to eat- having to cut it up and try to get bites with stuff on them.

I decided to try to ease my husband into eating warm or cooked fruit (he's a strange one: no hot pie a la mode, no pineapple upside down cake, etc.) by pairing it with his weakness: cheesecake.  It worked!  We loved the combination of creamy filling and warm apples.  I only with the filling was more like cheesecake, to me it was just a flavored cream cheese.  I'll toy with it next time.

I used Braeburn apples as well but changed up the filling a bit.  I used golden raisins and candied pecans instead of the cranberries.  I used a bit of hard pear cider in the pan for liquid (didn't have apple juice)  Next time I plan on making a carmel sauce to spoon over.  Made it for company and they LOVED it!

I made this at the last minute for our late Sunday afternoon lunch.  I used two small softball sized Fuji apples.  I followed the recipe exactly except I halved the sugar mixture (didn't sprinkle the inside of the apples or the top of the cream cheese mixture) and I eyeballed the amount of cream cheese.  We really enjoyed this baked apple.  Next time I will score the apple peel because it broke and peeled away anyway.  I will also add some finely chopped nuts next time.  Thanks!

This was a nice dessert.  I omitted the cranberries this time, I might try them sometime in the future.  I used honeycrisp apples and they held together nicely but were still tender.  I also used cream cheese with 1/3 less fat and think it would have been better with regular cream cheese, but that was my fault, not because of the recipe.

So easy to make. So delicious. This went wonderfully with the pork butt. It was nice to have something different for a side dish.
