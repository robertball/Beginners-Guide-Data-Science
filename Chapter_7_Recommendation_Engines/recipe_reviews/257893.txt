This turned out really good and was a great way to utilize the homemade stock and leftover turkey from Thanksgiving. I did make a couple of changes. I had everything to make this except for the red onion. I did have green onion though and so green it was. My next change was due to personal preference. While the bacon would have added flavor to the base of the soup, I despise "wobbly" bacon. I used the crumbled bacon as a topper instead. Due to not using red onion and the bacon not being in the soup I felt it needed color. I added sliced carrots and must admit they work very nicely in this soup. I know a lot of people like stewed tomatoes with their okra and I think tomatoes would work well in here too. This was a really good soup and a definite keeper. The only reason I'm giving it a 4 instead of a 5 is the treatment of the bacon.
