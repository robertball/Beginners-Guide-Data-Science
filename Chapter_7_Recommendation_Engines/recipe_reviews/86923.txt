i loved this, and actually i used guava paste instead of an actual guava.  The guava paste has a more concentrated flavor than the fruit, so be careful how much you add.  I did it to taste, but also be aware that guava paste is a bit grainy (but that didn't bother me).  I just chopped up up the guava paste into small cubes and heated it up according to instructions, then transferred to the blender and gave it a quick whirl, then poured back in the pot and added the rest of the ingredients and followed the directions.  It was AMAZING.

I was looking for a fruity type bbq sauce recipe that would be different from my usual sweet and tangy ones. This came close but something about so much tomato paste and no vinegar just didn't hit all the notes I was looking for.

Sorry I haven't made it but am trying to figure out how to do so with Guava Paste. A guest brought me 4 packages for a pot luck (imagine that) and I'm trying to figure out how to use it.
