Okay, I did not want sweet pancakes, I wanted savory....so I substituted equal parts garlic and onion powder instead of sugar.  They were fantastic!

I liked these, but the family thought they were, and I quote, 'weird', lol.  I served these drizzled with honey and topped with whipped cream. I don't know if I could eat these as a dessert or something that I would make all the time, but they were fun to try and tasty. Thanks for sharing. :)

First of all, the kids definitely knew this was zucchini, and so did I. This tasted like semi-raw, sweet zucchini. There is not enough flour to make them a pancake consistency or even like a fritter.  Also, I had to turn the heat down and cook for a longer time. They were burning on the higher heat suggested and weren't getting done at all in the middle. I was able to eat them, and I'll eat the leftovers for breakfast tomorrow, but I won't be making these again.

just made this...i cooked the pancakes for way longer than 2 minute per side, and the insides of the thin pancakes were still raw. e.   if i could figure out how to cook them all the way trough without burning the outsides, they might taste good!
