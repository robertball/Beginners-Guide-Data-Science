If you like bean salad then you will LOVE this one!  The flavors blend nicely and guests ask for seconds and thirds!  I added a little more sugar to bring the sweet/sour more into balance.  The longer it marinates in the refrigerator, the better it is!

i usually don't like bean salad but i followed this recipe exactly and it was great.  i did let the marinade cool a bit before pouring it over so the beans wouldn't get mushy.  i sliced my vidalia onion into rings so us non onion eaters could easily pick them out but they definately add to the marinade flavor.  i love the peppers in this!  it adds a nice crunch.  i used 1/2 teaspoon salt.

This is so easy to make, and so tasty!  I add an extra can of wax beans and an extra can of green beans, and leave out the lima beans.  Black beans are also good in this salad.  I also add a can of sliced carrots for color.  It's a wonderful dish for picnics, get-togethers or barbeques.

Liked it a lot.  Made a couple of changes:  beans:  1 (13oz) can black beans, 1 can garbanzo beans, 1 can "6 Bean Blend" (39oz altogether) plus I used a little more of the dried herbs.  Went Fantastic.  2nd batch I figured I'd use fresh herbs--disaster.  I chopped them way too coarse and got 'wood' in my salad.  I thought about trying to save it by draining the bean mixture and straining the dressing to return to salad, but never got around to it.  Will use dried for sure and maybe a little more sweet onion for zip.  A keeper!  :-)

This salad is awesome. So many possibilites for it. I have made it 3 times and it always tastes super no matter what kind of beans I use. It looks like a lot of ingredients but really isn't once all together. 5 cans of beans will yield a very large salad. I like to use red onion for extra color. I like the addition of dill for a unique flavor. This is a good inexpensive dish to bring to a potluck. Once you have some, you'll be hooked.

We liked this, but be forewarned:  it makes a LOT, and there's not really any way to cut it in half.  I was afraid the dressing would be too sweet or oily, but both were fine.  I used frozen green and lima beans because I'm not nuts about canned veggies, and substituted navy beans for the wax beans because I'm an idiot who spent far too long in the wrong aisle of the grocery store failing to find the latter.  Sigh.  Anyway, I don't think the character of the dish was changed by either substitution - if we can get our neighbors to help us eat it, we'll make this again!  Thanks!

This recipe is very versatile.  I don't care for wax beans so I leave them out.  I sometimes add white kidney beans, dark red kidney beans and green peas.  I always add a can of shoepeg corn. Sometimes, if I have it, I throw in a spoonful of diced pimento and some green olives. The marinade makes it delicious no matter what you add.

This was so easy and super tasty.  I didn't have the proper spices so threw in what I thought would work.  Instead of rosemary & basil I used a little thyme and celery seed, along with dill and garlic powder. Also used a red and orange bell paper and much more sweet onion than was called for.  I think that any spices you prefer would work, but definitely stick with the prescribed amount of vinegar, oil, and sugar. Be warned this recipe makes a large amount!

My husband loved this.  I omitted the lima beans, and my husband requested that the next time I make this that I only put in half the called for amount of garbanzo beans, and to make enough dressing for the beans to be completely covered by the liquid.

What a healthy, colorful salad!  This recipe was exactly what I was looking for in a multi-bean salad! But it made WAY more than 6 servings!  As tasty as it is, I can only it a small serving of a salad like this at a time!  Will make again-in a smaller proportion!

OK ... I made a few changes, some out of necessity.  Could not find canned wax beans, which led me to substitute frozen (steamed lightly) green beans and limas (never could find wax beans...).  Added (canned) black beans.  Omitted the peppers.  Cut down on the sugar (by about a third).  I found I had no white vinegar, so substituted white-wine vinegar.  I kept the herbs essentially as directed, but wonder how fresh herbs might have changed/improved the final product.....  This recipe is very forgiving.  I am enjoying having it for luch at work all this week.  Thanks, Jessica!

I made this  bean salad for a birthday party last night and it was a big hit.  Everyone loved it.  I would not change anything in this recipe because I think the amounts are right on.  The only thing I did was to add black olives to the salad.  It makes alot so it would be great for a big gathering.  Will be making again.

This was very easy to make. I actually only had edamames, kidneys, white, and green beans on hand, so I tossed that in with some onions, ADDED celery, and the dressing on top tasted great!  The dressing is really what made the salad, sweet with a little bit of tang.  Just be careful with the dressing--Do NOT let it boil!!  It is also good served warm.

My husband and I always keep one or two cold salads in the refrigerator.  This salad is absolutely our very favorite.  The only thing I change is to reduce the sugar to 1/4 cup.

This was the first time I ever made a bean salad and it is so easy, quick and delicious. I used what I had in the house so I substituted a purple bell pepper for the green pepper and only used cans of garbanzo and kidney beans and used fresh yellow bean from the farmers market. I also used a greek salad herb mix in place of rosemary. Finally I used a small amount of red wine vingear in addition to the distilled white wine.

I made this the other day, and I've got to say it is really the best bean salad recipe I've ever tried. My husband and I added black olives and some capers as well. YUMMY

I added a can of black eyed peas and I doubled the amount of liquid.  But after chilling the salad over night, the liquid on top got a little gelled. Not sure why. But I’ll make it again and follow the directions completely. It tasted okay and we ate it all!

I followed the recipe exactly except I added a can of black beans (rinsed/drained), shredded carrots & dried cranberries.  Also we found everyone liked it better served warm.  I used a slotted spoon to remove the salad from the oil mixture after it marinated overnight & put in a clean dish. There was plenty of flavor left on the beans without dripping off the fork..This is a great dish!

This salad is easy to put together. I used red wine vinegar in place of the  white vinegar, olive oil in place of vegetable oil and black beans in place of the Lima beans. Next time I will use less sugar as it is a little sweet, otherwise I would have given it 5 stars. My husband loved it just as I prepared it and didn't think that it was to sweet.

I loved my grandma's bean salad but no one had her recipe.  I found this and tried it. The only change I made was I omitted the lima beans and added black beans.  It was fabulous.  Great for a summer picnic since it has no mayo to worry about being in the sun.  Definitely will make again.

Quick and easy to make. I like alot of onion so i used a very large vidalia onion. I must say though it was very very sweet. I expected more of a savory flavor. Next time i make it i will cut the sugar in half or maybe do half 2 parts sugar 1 part salt.

This is good! I used green onion and shallot to use up what I had in the fridge. Didn't use any green beans, just 2 cans garbanzo and 2 cans kidney.

Not only does it taste good but is colorful.  A festive dish for the holidays.  Made it for a potluck and it was almost eaten completely.  I used Italian seasoning in mine (1 tbsp but could have used a bit more) and it turned out good.  Next time will use a bit less sugar (a little too sweet for me) and make sure I have all the recipe seasonings before getting started.  This is definitely a recipe to keep.

Excellent Dish! I sometimes substitute the oil and herbs with a little Italian dressing to save time as all I want to do is dig into this scrumptious meal.

This was absolutely delicious!!!!  I couldn't find garbanzo beans so I used a can of corn.  Also cut back alittle on the onion and the sugar.  Hopefully it will last until the party I made it for!!!

This salad is addicting! I added one can of an already-made bean salad from Trader Joe's, and left out the pepper and wax beans since I didn't have them, and it was so tasty! My roomate felt bad for eating so much of it :) Am making this again right now actually...

This was great! I couldn't find wax beans, which would have made it even better, but replacing them with white beans worked fine too. Very tangy and easy to make. Thanks!

This recipe was okay.  It isn't quite what I was after.  The dressing was far too sweet for me.  The dressing flavor reminds me of the juice in a bread-and-butter pickle jar.

I substituted black beans for the wax beans, used Italian green beans, cut the sugar in half and added about 3/8 tsp. salt.  Everyone loves it!  A definite keeper!

I really didnt care too much for this salad, it sounded really good, and the reviews on it were great, but I thought the dressing was way too sweet, if I made it agian, I would use more vinegar , just too sweet for my taste.
