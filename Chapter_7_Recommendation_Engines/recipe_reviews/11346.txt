I used toasted almonds instead of pecans, and chilled the dough overnight. I cut them into mickey mouse heads and butterflies with cookie cutters. They were very crunchy and tasty. They were  my son's favourite.

This is a nice little cookie that's not too sweet and perfect with a cup of coffee.

The cookies are good, but even after an hour chilling in the refrigerator, they were way too soft to roll out or use cookie cutters.
