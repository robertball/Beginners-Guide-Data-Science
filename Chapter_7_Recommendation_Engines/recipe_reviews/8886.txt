I would certainly prepare this again, but only with a few modifications.  First, it was way too salty.  I will begin by at cutting the garlic salt back by at least half.  Also, the ketchup flavor is too prominent; I will decrease the ketchup next time.  With these modifications, I suspect I would rate the recipe at least a four--maybe a five.  The flavor is decent and could be far better.

My tropical themed event went very well and my guests loved this dish! I do, too! I used Ginger Juice, less onion powder as I spread onions and colorful sweet peppers on the bottom of my coconut oiled baking dish. Less ketchup and more brown sugar. Used fresh garlic and not garlic salt. Rice vinegar instead of cider vinegar. Marinated the raw boneless chicken breasts for 1 hour in vinegar mixture. Greased deap dish stoneware, placed peppers and onions, then chicken and topped with pineapple mixture. Baked at 350 for 45 minutes.

Fabulous!  I used boneless, skinless chicken breast and reduced the cooking time to 30 minutes total.  I also used a lot less brown sugar, as the pineapple makes this dish plenty sweet already.

Good. Easy to make.  I reviewed other comments before making it. Here are my suggestions. Full portion of ketchup is probably too much, but 1/2 is not enough (bottom line - to taste).  I used boneless/skinless thighs - drained most of the fat/liquid off b4 adding the sauce.  Also brushed both sides up front (double the vinegar/spice mix, use low sodium soy - skip the garlic salt, use powder or fresh).

I used chicken breasts instead of bone-in chicken and baked it on a bed of veggies as someone suggested earlier. Then I served it over white rice. Everyone loved the mixture of tastes! The meat was very tender and juicy. My family said they especially liked the pineapple - my mother said that she normally doesn't like pineapple, but it was good in this dish. We're definitely going to make this again, especially since it was relatively easy and simple to make.

This was excellent. The only changes I made were: I only used three quarters cup of ketchup and because I found the sauce to be a little runny, I added 2 tbsp of cornstarch and water during the last 10 minutes of cooking, it thickened the sauce beautifully. My family were inhaling the aromas before supper and could hardly wait to eat. No one was disappointed. Thanks for an easy and tasty recipe. Will be serving again in the near future.

Great tasting and very easy to make. The chicken almost melts in your mouth, and the rich mixture of the ginger & soy combined with the sweetness of the pineapple five it a wonderful flavor.

I have made this recipe twice with excellent results. My husband loves it.  I did modify the recipe some as I did not have all the ingredients listed. Instead of ketchup I used a can of tomato soup and white wine vinegar instead of cider vinegar.  I also used low sodium soy sauce and garlic powder not garlic salt. Also instead of basting the chicken with the soy sauce mixture - I mixed ALL the ingredients in one bowl and covered the chicken in it. Much easier! Turned out great and it will be a regular in our house! Thanks for the recipe!

Fast & easy dinner. I used chicken breast, since that's what I had. I also used teriyaki sauce instead of soy sauce.

This was alright. My son liked it, but my stepson did not. It was too ketchup-y. I was hoping to recreate a hawaiian chicken recipe for my bf and this wasn't it.

I made this a couple nights ago.  I was searching for a "sweet" chicken recipe that I had all the ingredients for.  At first I was a little leery of the ketchup addition, however, once the dish was complete and we all tasted it, it is a real winner and not hard to prepare at all.    I'm a mother of 3 children, ages 2 up to 8, and I have a husband who should be a food critic.  They all enjoyed it, even my 4 year old little boy who turns his nose up at anything with vegetables in it.    This was a great dish for the cold weather we're having here.  I served it over jasmine rice.  Easy prep and it satisfied my whole family.

The reviews fr this recipe were very mixed.  My family and I liked it, although my husband said he would have liked it spicy, so next time I will add some dried crushed peppers to his chicken.

This was a big hit with the whole family. I used some of the suggestions in other reviews, reducing the garlic salt by 1/2, and the reducing the ketchup by 1/4. It turned out excellent!

I rated this 3 stars because it was edible, but we did not like it at all. Way too vinegary and the sauce just wasn't very good.

this was good, but not all that. Ketchup taste was very over powering. I will change that and try it again.

i thought this was a great variation for an asian chicken recipe, and my only change was boneless/skinless chicken breasts.  my children didn't like it as much as i thought they would, but what do they know - ha!

This was OK, but my familiar was not bowled over.  The chicken became extremely tender though - no need for a knife.

I made this with boneless, skinless chicken breast and basted both sides of the breast, cooked it for 15 minutes, applied the other sauce and cooked it for 25 more minutes.  This is, by far, the best chicken I've ever had!!  I served it with carrots instead of rice and we used teryaki sauce instead of soy sauce.  I highly recommend this!!!!

Terrific recipe, Amy! I reduced the garlic salt in the marinade, and doubled the sauce recipe as others suggested. I made another couple of modifications to use things that I had on hand. I used a 29 oz. can of sliced peaches instead of the pineapple. ( sorry Amy, a great recipe like this always inspires me to adlib, and I didn't have pineapple! ) I reseved the peach syrup, as others had said that their sauce was too runny. I also chucked in the last 2 ozs. of a jar of mango / pineapple salsa, and a dab of cranberry & fig preserves. When you have dabs of jelly lurking in the fridge, this is a great type recipe to use them up!           
  One other tweak that I did was to add a couple of dashes of worcestershire and a couple of generous squirts of hot chili sauce, as we love things sweet AND spicy. You can usually find hot chili sauce in the chinese food section of your grocery store. It's a very flavorful sauce that isn't real hot unless you use too much!                              Served this over a bed of white rice and, oh mama, dat's tasty!

Very flavorful, a bit heavy on the soy sauce and salty taste, but a little adjusting of the ingredients will make that better for me, no complaints from the family.

This was not good!  We even cut back the cider vinegar because of the reviews, but it was still TOO MUCH!  I think I would try maybe basalmic vinegar and only 1 tablespoon.  Maybe that would be better.  I also even added a tablespoon of honey thinking it would help balance the vinegar, but that wasn't enough to do the trick.  I will NOT be recommending this to anyone.  Now I am stuck with another meal of this.

Instead of garlic salt, I used fresh minced garlic. This was good, but really sweet. I think it could use fresh onion and maybe fresh ginger paste as well as cutting back on the sugar just a touch. I'd like to play with this recipe a bit, see if I can't make it better.

I love this recipe it's delicious!! But I did do some changes like recommended by other reviews. I  used a little bit less ketchup than the recipe said and I used real onion instead of powder. DO NOT USE CIDER VINEGAR! It smells really bad, I tried rice vinegar instead and only one tbs. It was really good. My mom and dad loved it. I will definitely make this again.

tasty.  i only substituted the garlic salt for garlic power based on earlier suggestions.  i thought it was a wee pinch of "something" from being perfect (maybe more salt).  my wife felt it was perfect just the way it was prepared.

This recipe was absolutely delicious,  at the end it says to leave in for 30 minutes, and i took it out in 20 so it was extra juicy, but fully cooked.  Everybody had seconds!

this is a good recipe that only requires a couple of modifications. use tomato paste instead of ketchup and white wine vinegar instead of cider vinegar, that way the rest of the ingredients arent overwhelmed. i baked the chicken on a bed of onions and red peppers and it was delicious. i served it over rice but i think i'd like it in a wrap better. thanks for a great weeknight dinner!

Very good...served it over white rice.  This dish smelled delicious as it cooked. I used boneless, skinless breasts. I used low sodium soy sauce, used fresh minced garlic, omitted the onion powder, and added crushed red peppers. Next time I'll bake it on top of green peppers and onions.  Really tasty and the man liked it too.

I thought this was great! A perfect blend of flavors! Not too sweet, not too tangy. Just right! Followed the recipe to the "T" including the bake time. The meat came out very tender and the suace was very flavorful! Very simple and tasty dish. The crushed pineapple leaves a very pretty presentation! :) This was enjoyed by the whole family including my aunt who had joined us for dinner that night.

I have to say that my husband will eat anything and he wouldn't eat this.  The cider over powered and gave it a not so pleasant smell and taste.  Leaving out the cider makes this a great dish.  Full of flavor and taste when it mixes with the juices of the chicken.

I made a few minor substutions with this recipe to suit what I had on hand and I had ZERO leftovers!! 
To start with I used bone in chicken breasts, which did require a longer total cooking time. I only cooked it for the first round of the saucesless bake to help keep the breasts from being too dry.
I was short on ketchup so I made up the difference with a small can of tomato sauce like you would use for chili and a few odd spices for flavor and I also added a can of mandarin oranges! My husband who HATES pineapple begged me for seconds!!  
I will definately make this again and again, of course, I'll have to double it from now on!

This recipe is good, but not as presented, that is for sure. Take a real good look at this --

1 tablespoon onion powder 
2 tablespoons garlic salt 

Heavens! A tablespoon! With soy sauce, too?  I knew this would be too salty, so I switched to 1 teaspoon each of onion powder and garlic powder (not salt). Then I used low salt soy sauce. Even then it was rather salty. Think next time I'll use minced garlic and onion instead. 

I also saw the cook time was ridiculous. It should only take about 30 minutes at that temp to cook bites of chicken. I basted 7 minutes each side and then cooked for 20 minutes with the topping. I still think I could drop the basting to 5 a piece. It sounds like this recipe was not only misprinted, but with the cook time and amount of ingredients, I think it was originally for a whole chicken pieced out. 

I also used pineapple chunks which I mashed up a bit, so that there would still be chunks which my kids love. Next time I will probably use those new shaped pineapples -- they're kind of between chunks and crushed.

Once I made the necessary changes (and this was sheer guessing) it was kind of fun.

We all really liked this.  I noted that some reviewers said it was too salty and I wonder if that might be your garlic salt. I have two different brands in my pantry:  one brand lists 237 mg sodium per quarter teaspoon and the other brand lists over 500 mg in the same amount!  Obviously, the two tablespoons called for in the recipe will be dramatically different depending on the amount of salt in your garlic salt.  I used half the saltier garlic salt and half plain garlic powder.  It was a fine salt level for us.    Normally I brine my chicken before cooking, and in that case I'd use just garlic powder and skip the salt altogether.

Also, I felt like i had too much pineapple mixture for four pounds of chicken.  I used it all, but it just seemed like half as much would be fine.

All in all, a great, easy, tasty dish!

I would describe this as interesting. . . I did not have all the ingredients on hand and made substitutions.  I used fresh pineapple and ginger garlic paste for ginger powder.  I also used chicken breast.

We really enjoyed this chicken dish! I was looking for something new and had all the ingredients. I used boneless, skinless chicken thighs (4 to serve two) and cooked them on a raised rack for the first two 15 minute bakes-then finished them in the sauce,(half recipe),in a casserole dish. When finished,the sauce was just the right thickness to stick to the chicken. This flavor was very rich-I might use a little less sugar next time-OR use unsweetened pineapple and juice. Substituted fresh green onion for onion powder in the basting liquid.

I absolutely loved this. I did however omit the garlic salt and added 2 tsp. garlic powder. Trying to watch salt intake so with the soy and ketchup, seemed logical. I also cut the onion powder to 1 tsp. and used sliced onions and green peppers in the bottom of pan. Only had white wine vinegar in pantry, so I used that.

Not bad.  This was a first time attempt and it came out a little sweeter than originally anticipated.  I reduced the cook time by half (which made for a juicy chicken) however the sauce was a little too sweet.  Fairly easy recipe and very different.  Served over jasmine rice, which I also topped with the extra pineapple-soy mixture from the baking pan which gave it a complete aloha flavor!

I liked it, the picky kids liked it.  I would have to say it does need some changes to make it really good.  Way less garlic salt, less ketchup, less soy sauce.  Then it should be really close to perfect!

I have to agree this is not a very good recipe, once I started basting I knew there would be a problem. I ended up basically boiling the chicken in pineapple juice and the "spices" that were in this recipe for about 30 minutes, then I dumped it out and let the chicken cook in the "sweet and sour sauce" with pineapple...all was not lost =)

The recipe ends up way too salty for our tastes. I'd suggest cutting down on the garlic salt and soy sauce and replace it without something else.

I agree with some of the other reviewers that the recipe had too much salt. I only used part of the basting mixture instead of the entire amount.  The flavor is good but very strong.

My chicken was already in the oven when I started reading the reviews. Luckily, 
I had already substituted garlic powder and cut it  to 1/3 the amount called for, and reduced 
the ketchup to about half. I also used rice vinegar instead of cider vinegar, it worked 
fine. My family didn't rave about it or anything but it was okay. If I make it again, I'll add chopped green peppers and take the skin off the
chicken.

Absolutely fantastic!!! I tried it on Pork spare ribs too and it was just as great!! You have to give it a go. I changed a few things to suit my needs tho.  I used drumettes. Also, instead of garlic salt, I used crushed garlic from a jar. I also used red wine vinegar.

The Staff at Allrecipes has modified this recipe; the chicken ingredient now lists '4 pounds chicken thighs', but there is also a description note pointing out that any bone-in pieces can be used. The larger amount of chicken reflects the original submission and improves the recipe. Happy Cooking!

I loved this. I doubled the chicken and decreased the garlic salt to 1 tbsp. My husband and I love strong dishes and we really loved this. I served it over angel hair pasta and it was so good. My 3 year old even liked it and she is picky!

I too would cut back on the garlic salt, maybe even try using garlic powder. Very very salty, but overall nice flavor if you cut back the salt

I was not too impressed by this recipe. I lowered the amount of ketchup and it still had a strong tomato taste. I was looking for a sweet/sour taste.

My husband and I thought this was delicious but it didn't go over well with the kids. I omitted the garlic salt and used fresh garlic to cut back on sodium. I also used the crock pot but I think it would be better in the oven, thicker sauce. Gonna try it again, it was good, something different!

This was a great recipe.  My husband exclaimed multiple times over it.  I did make many changes though, so no five stars.  Used fresh ginger and garlic as well as tomato sauce over ketchup, coconut palm sugar instead of brown, and sweet soy sauce instead of regular.  Still yummy though!

I did not like this recipe the way it is... it was way too salty. I made some changes. Instead of ketchup, I used one jar of spagetti sauce, one can of pineapple bits, a 1/4 tsp of garlic salt, 1/4 teaspoon of cloves instead of ginger and a couple dashes of soy sauce. I then added chicken legs and covered it; cooked it on top of the stove on medium heat for an hour. I like this recipe because it is so flexible! You can adjust it to suit your own personal taste!

A crowd-pleaser.  The flavors are a bit strong-- follow what it says about increasing the amount of chicken to decrease the intensity of the flavor.  For me, you can't have too much of a good thing.  :)  I think this would make a great appetizer-- I'm going to try it with chicken wings when I get back to school in the fall.

I decided to try this since we've been to Hawaii a half dozen times and I also had all ingredients on hand.  I wasn't too impressed.  The chicken was very tender, but like other reviews, the cider was a bit much.  If I did decide to make again I would decrease the cider to 1 tbs. and also decrease the amount of ketchup.  I recommend serving over white rice, since the flavor is a little bold.

I took this dish to a church potluck. I altered it by puting a little less salt and vinegar. Everyone loved it and asked for the recipe. Goes great with rice.

I made this for my husband.  He said it was good but the cider vinegar was a little to overpowering.  Next time I will only add a little of that.  I would recomment low-sodium soy sauce.  It was yummy over white rice.  Chicken is always fun to cook with.  This was a recipe you either love it or hate it.  I will have to alter the ingredients next time if I want to make this recipe again.

I used this recipe with boneless chicken breasts. Cook the breasts on each side for 15 minutes with the mixture in step 2 - and then I put the chicken into a foil bag and put the pineapple/soy mixture in as well and bake for 25 mintues. Very yummy!

I agree with most of the reviews.  I cut the tablespoon of garlic down to one tsp and made it granulated instead of garlic salt.   The bake time is incorrect also and has to be more for larger pieces of chicken.  I also used balsamic vinegar and used low salt soy sauce .   This could be good grilled.  I will try it this spring.

Like the others, this recipes really needs to be modified--replace the garlic salt with garlic powder and add 1/2 cup of ketchup instead of 1 cup. This recipes is delicious! If you're running short on time, the chicken can be cooked in a skillet. Then, simply add your sauce and let it summer for 20 minutes!

My husband and I loved this dish, although our children found it a little spicy
for their taste. It isnt a really quick dish to make, but is fairly easy to follow
and as far as Im concerned, well worth the time. It is delicious.

After reading the reviews, I modified the recipe and used garlic powder instead of salt, and also halved the amount it called for. I also used about 1/4 cup of ketchup and basted for 5 minutes and cooked for 10. After these modifications the dish was delicious. I also served it over rice, which added some flavor. I did have extra sauce left over, which may make a good marinade.

Not the easiest dish in the world, but, MAN!, the taste! You'll eat the leftover days after the chicken is long-since disappeared.

Very good recipe.  I left my chicken breasts whole and they were a little on the dry side.  I would cut it up as the recipe indicates.

I had wish I read the reviews before I made this recipe! I agree that it was way too salty and way too ketchupy. Next time I would cut those in half. We are wondering what we should do with the leftovers!

I think the proportions on this recipe are way off.  I only put in half the garlic salt and it was still VERY salty.  I would not make it again.

I was a bit skeptical when making this for the first time,
but it is really good, and my kids liked it.  I reduced the
ketchup to about 1/2 cup and it did not require the full cooking
time.  Also didn't use all of the basting mixture, so next 
time I will make only about 1/2 of that.

suggestion:  skip the ketchup/pinapple sauce and just use the marinade.  The sauce was WAY too Ketchupy!!  The ketchup overpowered all the other flavors.

The sweet and sour sauce was delicious and the chicken was really easy to make. It took a little less time to cook, at least in my oven. Try checking the chicken after about 8-10 minutes--then add the pineapple sauce mixture and continue to cook.

I doubled ginger, paprika, garlic salt (I used powder), onion powder and used apple cider vinegar because that is what I had.  Made a paste and rubbed into entire boneless chicken breast.  I let it sit overnight.  Mixed up rest with 2 TBS brown sugar and only 1/2 cup ketchup and spooned a little on top of chicken.  Baked @ 350 for 45 minutes.  Heated remaining mixture and served with rice and fresh from my garden green beans!!! Grandkids wanted more!

We LOVE this recipe! The only alteration that I made was that instead of the Pineapple with juice I use the Pineapple with syrup. Very good with organic chicken thighs. YUM!

This chicken was delicious! I gave it four stars only because I thought it tasted a little too tomato saucy. Next time I will use less ketchup. I also did not have as much gravy as I would have liked. Maybe I will add more pineapple juice next time so I have more gravy.

This was a good quick recipe. I would advise reducing the ketchup by at least half. If using boneless skinless thighs cut all cooking increments by half as well.

This recipe is delicious!! I will definitely use it again and again. It is not what I expected. I used drumsticks and combined all the ingredients in the crock pot and set them on high for 4.5 hours. The meat just fell off the bone and the taste was great! I did reduce the ketchup to about 3/4 cup. The sauce is very thin so if you're looking for a recipe with a thicker sauce this isn't it.

Really nice flavor, the longer it cooks, the thicker the sauce.  I did think that it was a bit too salty and will just use garlic powder in the future.

This actually turned out way better than I expected. I scaled the recipe down to 4 servings, but found I had to make a lot more of the vinegar basting mixture. I'm not usually a fan of meat and fruit, but there was just the right amount of tangyness to counter the pineapple. Thanks, Amy. Nice recipe!

Not bad. I would probably make again, but next time I'd leave out most of the soy (not really a soy person). It is a nice deviation from the regular chicken dishes. I used chicken tenderloins so I cut down the cooking time by about half, plus I only had 1lb of chicken. I did reduce the soy some. I made brown rice to go along with it. Maybe next time I'll put more pineapple in it too.

I made some modifications like some of the reviews suggested. I used fresh ginger, garlic, and onions. Everything turned out great except it was undercooked so I had to leave it in the oven for another 10 min.

This was very good the way I made it. First I did not use all the vinegar called for I used 1&1/2 tablespoons of vinegar and 1&1/2 tablespoons of chicken stock. Also did not use all ketchup. I used 1/2 ketchup and 1/2 tomato sauce. It was very good even the 10 month old liked it. I will make this over and over.

YUMMY! This recipe was great! I used some of the other reviewers suggestion to use tomato sauce instead of ketchup. Will definately use it again!

This was okay, but not great. I used boneless chicken breasts and changed the cooking times a little. I read the previous reviews, so I used garlic powder instead of garlic salt. I also used about a teaspoon of onion powder (instead of a tablespoon).  The "sauce" was WAY TOO MUCH!  I only needed about 1/3 of what the recipe made.  I usually love chicken and pineapple recipes, but this one isn't worth the effort.

After modification, this was great! First, I mixed all ingredients together.  I substituted garlic powder for the salt.  I marinated an entire FAMILY PACK of chicken overnight.  (There is just too much sauce for 2 breasts.)  I poured all into a large casserole dish, baked covered for about 45 minutes and uncovered for 30 minutes more(until chicken done)- I can only think that the positive ratings are from those who modified the recipe.  As written it is terrible.

I read the reviews on this recipe first and did a lot of modifications. I used bone-in breasts, 1t onion plus, 2t garlic powder, reduced the ketchup to a little less then 1/2. I spread the cider mixture on the chicken, then dumped the "sauce" over the top, covered tightly with foil and baked at 350F for about an hour. It came out very juicy and tasted really good :) Everyone here ate it including my 2-1/2 & 4yo daughters.

This wasn't the greatest dish I've ever made, but my husband ate it anyway.  My 3 year old HATED it.  I read the reviews and cut the ketchup in 1/2 and used garlic powder instead of garlic salt, but the ketchup flavoring is still overwhelming.  Edible, but not worth making again.

This had to be the worst thing I have ever made for dinner.  I wish I had read the reviews before making this slop.  The cook time for the chicken was way too long.  My chicken was extremely overcooked. This dish was also way to salty-- so much it burned my tongue!  I have no idea how this got such a high rating.

Very tasty, but I would limit basting time to 15 minutes and cook time to 30.  Mine started to burn in the second basting.  But very good!

I thought the recipe was great except I would have to agree with other's it was a bit salty I think by cutting out the garlic salt and adding garlic powder or minced garlic would take away that over  bearing salt taste.

This recipe yields a large amount of the 
sauce the chicken cooks in. I recommend 
doubling the chicken amount, at least, to 
balance the dish out.
It was a hit in my house when served
over white rice.

Blechhh! I wish I had read the reviews before starting to make this one.
As I was assembling the ingredients I started to have a bad vibe about it, but thought what the heck.

Too much gaslic powder, a CUP of ketchup?? My God, what a mess.

NEVER AGAIN.

In the future I would use less ketchup, salt, and slightly less vinegar.  I prefer more "sweet" than sour.  But my husband liked it as it was, which is a good thing!

WOW! Where was my mind when I was adding ALL that salt? I don't want to be rude, but all I could taste was the salt. I think it could be a good dish if 80% of the salt was cut back. Thank You, Linda

Would not make this again.  Even with reducing the garlic salt it was not very tasty.
