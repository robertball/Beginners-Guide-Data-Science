I took to heart what some were saying about the dryness and taste and I tweaked the recipe a little also. I did:
 
2 eggs
1 cup milk
1 cup chocolate morsals
3/4 cup sugar
1/4 cup brown sugar
1/4 cup oil
1/4 tsp cinnamon 

and left all the other ingredients the same.

The morsals did not sink to the bottom. The muffins were moist. The cinnamon was just an extra hint of flavor. Everyone loved them!

These were not good at all - even with the alterations that were suggested.  My daughter had been bugging me to make choc chip muffins for months - and she took a bite of one muffin and wouldn't touch the rest.  Very disappointing in both taste and texture.  Sorry - I usually try to come up with something nice to say, but I can't with this recipe.  My advice to anyone searching for a good muffin recipe - keep looking.  The alterations may help some - but not enough.  Save yourself the hassle.

The taste of these muffins was okay but the texture was quite dense - more like a biscuit.  I followed the recipe exactly.

These muffins are delicious, and so easy to make. I didn't want too much sugar in this snack, so I used a dash of cinnamon-sugar in place of the brown and white sugar topping suggested.

Well, I followed all the suggestions I read here.  I added more sugar, 1/4 cup brown sugar, less oil, 2 eggs, more chips...plus I added a tsp of vanilla.  I also sprinkled the tops with some extra morsels before the brown sugar/sugar mixture. Anyway, I am guessing they would not have been as good if I followed the original recipe.  But with the changes, they were delicious.  They tasted like bakery muffins!  The dough was not as thick as I thought it would be, so I didn't need to add extra milk.  Thank you to all of you who sent in your reviews.  They are always a big help!  I will make these again sometime!

I baked those for the Bake Sale at my daughter's school this morning. Good recipe, yummy and very moist!
I followed some of the recommendations (more milk and a little more oil) and it turned out great.

As for next time: I would cancel the salt.

Ok so my boyfriend and I have died and gone to muffin heaven...  this chocolate chip muffin recipe may sound pretty standard to make, but I think the brown& white sugar topping really does add something extra (like a sugar high, lol).  Instead of 3/4 cup milk I added 1 cup, and I used regular semisweet chocolate morsels instead of mini - but apart from this, I followed the rest of the recipe exactly.  I did end up with way too much leftover sugary topping though, so I would suggest mixing 2 tbsp white sugar and 1 tbsp brown.  I also sprayed the muffin tin with Pam (with Flour for Baking) AND gave a quick spray inside each paper liner, which I credit the ease of taking these muffins out.  20 mins in the oven is all it took for these babies to come out, perfectly puffed and sugared..  This recipe is def. a keeper for chocolate chip muffins - Thanks Nora!

My 3-year-old son wanted to make muffins a few days ago, and I didn't have any prepackaged mixes--we found this recipe, he helped me make it, and the muffins turned out great!  I froze the remaining muffins; we reheated some this morning and they are great out of the freezer too!

These tasted great, but don't cook them for over 20 minutes. I cooked mine for exactly that amount of time and they came out dry - I wish I would've took them out 2 minutes prior. However, the topping made it better!

I also found the batter to be a bit dry, but instead of adding any extra milk or oil to add moisture, I added several spoons of vanilla yogurt.  And watch the bake time!  Mine baked for 18 minutes before I checked them, and they were already a little overdone. The crunchy sugar topping is a great idea...

this is the same exact recipe as "chocolate chip muffins" by janice.

here's the url: http://allrecipes.com/Recipe/Chocolate-Chip-Muffins/Detail.aspx

and there's more reviews on that one, with more tweaks for those of you who tried the recipe and thought it needed something.

These muffins were pretty good. However, I did not cook them the length of time specified (I only cooked them for about 17 minutes) and I reduced my oven temp to 375. They came out light golden on top. The chocolate sunk to the bottom of the muffin and it could have used some vanilla or other seasonings to the batter. Will probably try a different recipe next time.

These are easy muffins to whip up!  They freeze well too!  I have made them with chopped up Reese Peanutbutter Cups in place of the chocolate chips and they were just as yummy!

Yummy & moist. I prefer to add an entire bag of chocolate chips though so they are super chocolately! I also sprinkle sugar over the top before baking, this leaves a yummy coating like a sugar cookie!

PERFECT SOY MILK SUBSTITUTE MUFFINS - 
yummy muffins... they did seem quite heavy as other reviewers have mentioned but muffins are traditionally heavy compared to cupcakes so I wasnt surprised at the texture/weight. I changed the milk component to VANILLA SOY MILK and it was GREAT!!!!!

These muffins turned out a bit too heavy for me. I measured and sifted everything exactly, but the result was a thick, dense cake, not a light, crumbly muffin.

I was done mixing these muffins before I read the other reviews.  Had I read them first, I would have realized the 'four star' rating of these muffins was for the modified recipes included in the reviews.  This original recipe was very dry, grainy...even my kids wouldn't eat them.  Wish someone would publish this recipe, altered, so we could try that as written.

These are good.  If you make the changes that everyone recommends then they are GREAT!   We just ate them all for breakfast.  The changes included: add 1/2 cup brown sugar, increase to 2 eggs, increase to 1 cup milk, increase to 1 cup chips, decrease to 1/4 cup vegetable oil.  Keep the white sugar, flour, baking powder, salt the same.   They freeze well but I wouldn't make the topping if you want to freeze them (it just falls off).  Try them - you will like them!!!

I have had this recipe for a while and finally made them today.  They are delicious.  However, I do agree with several reviewers and added about another 1/4 c. of milk.  Otherwise the batter is extremely stiff.  I used regular sized chocolate chips but added extra.

The top was really good because of the sugar, I found the middle a bit lacking of flavor. I would also recommend putting a few more chocolate chips in (especially for us chocolate lovers). All in all a very good recipe and I'm glad I made them.

This recipe is ok but I think that the muffins tend to be a little dry and tough.  It seemed like there was too much flour in the batter and it was hard to mix it in.  It also seemed odd that the chocolate chips were added with the dry ingredients and not folded in at the end as is customary.

These were a hit when I brought them into fellowship, though I suspect college students will eat pretty much anything.  I made a second batch substituting raisins for the chocolate chips...those were devoured too!

I tried all of the alterations people suggested--more sugar, extra egg, less oil, more chocolate, and the dough was so thick--it reminded me of cookie dough.  I was like "what I did wrong. whatever" and baked it anyway.  They turned out like big thick cookies--not fluffy, like muffins.  I don't know what I did wrong, but I would have liked them to be "lighter" like muffins rather than dense and heavy like cookies.

This recipe is flwaed.   The muffins were too crumbly to come out of the tray, and when they did they didn't even taste nice.  They were so bland, but what can u expect from flour and sugar? I liked the idea of leting the sugar on top, but there was toom much sugar, as soon as i inverted the tray, sugar; all over the floor.  Unfortunately i did not read the other reviews until they were in the oven, which only others findings.  DO NOT MAKE THESE MUFFINS!

I followed all changes recommended & scaled the recipe for 6 muffins but get 12 muffins from the scaled recipe! I used the Reynolds aluminium muffin pans & filled to 3/4 cup full. The first batch I baked was still somewhat bland so I added more vanilla & it turns out great!

This muffin recipe was very easy to make. I did omit the sugar over the top, but they were still delicious. A little bit heavier of a muffin than I'm used to but filling and still very good. I'd certainly make them again!

I also used the alterd recipe and it turned out pretty good, not the best I have ever had though. I baked half of my batter right after making it and the muffins turned out good, but nothing spectacular. I put the remaining batter in the refrigerator overnight and baked them in the morning adding more vanilla extract,brown sugar, and milk. The muffins turned out much better than before, they were really good!

I LOVE chocolate chip muffins, and I especially love the crusty, sugary topping in this recipe. If only sugar was as good for you as it tastes. *Weep.*

If you want to please a crowd do not make these muffins.  I followed the recipe exactly and these things came out horrible.  My kids hated them and so did I.  They were more like rocks instead of muffins.

I agree with JAKYSMOM--since everyone said the muffins were terrible on their own I did what she suggested plus a bit of vanilla extract. They were really good!! My rating for JAKYSMOM's recipe would definately get a 4.5 out of 5 stars!!!

I've made these heaps of times and they are fantastic - especially if you add one or two ripe banana.. I found the trick is to not over mix.

This is a great, simple recipe for slightly sweet chocolate chip muffins.  I've made them and brought them to work, and my co-workers love them.  My roomate always asks me to make them, too.  I love the sprinkling of sugar on top, it's a great touch.  Thanks for sharing, Nora!

I made this recipe on a Sunday morning for a treat. I didn't read the reveiws until they were in the oven. The batter seemed a little thick but in the end they were moist on the inside and crunchy on the outside. What a nice and simple treat. I used regular chocolate chips instead of mini which was fine. Muffins can sometimes be too moist and gooey that's why i really loved the texture. no modifications neccessary for me and I'm sure I'll try them again. To all the reviews muffins are definately a fickle baking choice and you should always make whatever modifications feel right at the time.

These were really good. I ate 3 of them in the same day and then ate some for breakfast and snack. I would have to say that I got them to how *I* like them, with a bit more cooked outer side, and did that by cooking it for 23 minutes, right inbetween. YUMMM!

These muffins are delicious and a favourite with my two year old.  Next time I make them, though, I won't add the sugar topping - They are sweet enough already.

My sons have been requesting chocolate chip muffins and they loved this. I used the modified recipe suggested by the JAKYSMOM review (2 eggs 1 cup milk 1 cup chocolate morsals 3/4 cup sugar 1/4 cup brown sugar 1/4 cup oil 1/4 tsp cinnamon and left all the other ingredients the same)but left out the cinnamon since they aren't such fans of it and added 1/2 teaspoon vanilla. I found it a little sweet by itself but it went great with a cup of black coffee! It was quick and easy to make...even for breakfast on a school day :) We'll definitely be making this again.

These muffins are pretty good, I too used JAKYSMOM's modded recipe. I definately will make them again, probably with milk choc. chips instead of the semisweet, think i might try the vanilla too.

They are quite nice, but certainly not the best muffins I have ever tasted. I found that all the choc chips sunk to the bottom and stayed there.

We liked these.  I made them mini size for a holiday tray, so I used m&m baking bits instead of chocolate chips for some color and omitted the topping.  I also added 1 teaspoon of vanilla.  They made cute, moist little nibbles.

I think these are a little bland, to be honest. They rise nicely though, and have a fine, not-too-dense texture. Maybe I should have added some vanilla extract.

AWESOME!! Took a little more milk than the recipe called for, but I live in a dry climate so that might be the reason.
