Great simple recipe.  It is the exact cannoli cream recipe grandma used.  Not sure about the “con latte” part. Also I used powdered sugar as it melt smoothly into the cheese.  Cookies add the right amount of crunch when you done have time to make cannoli shells.  Sometime I use ice cream cones too.  Molto Delizioso!!!

I used regular Ricotta cheese and a little extra of the chocolate chips. Even better than I imagined!!
