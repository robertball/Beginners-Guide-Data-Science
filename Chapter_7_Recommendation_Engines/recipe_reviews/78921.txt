You'll need at least 10 sheets of phyllo on the bottom, otherwise the custard will just swallow the phyllo. I'd also be sure that the phyllo is overlapping the sides of the pan, not just the bottom, so be sure the dough is large enough. You may also want to cut the custard mixture by 1/3 to get better texture.

The traditional way to serve this is in rolls, not as a casserole. You roll the custard filling in a sheet of fillo and layer in a baking dish, bake until golden brown and then drizzle the honey mixture over the top.

I had absolutely no trouble with the recipe as it was written, I used less sugar, and less syrup because I'm not a fan of sweets. It was delicious, my family ate the whole thing in two days!

It was very good. Although you shouldn't add to much of the syrup or else it will be quite sweet. It is very rich to but its good!
