Mmmmm!!! I used the suggestions of others here and omitted the water and used half the milk and broth.  I didn't have all the listed ingredients so I used these substitutions: 

3/4 Cup chicken broth (broth from Amanda's chicken casserole recipe preparation [not published])

Havarti cheese for the parmesan

It was incredible! I really want to use this on other vegebables using different kinds of broth.

This was a good starter recipe.  I omitted the water and broth and only used 1 3/4 cups of milk.  I also left out the sage and used 1/4 tsp of basil, 1/4 tsp of dill weed, and 2 tsp of garlic powder.  Instead of parmesan, I used fontina cheese.  I also steamed the asparagus and poured the cheese sauce over the asparagus rather than cooking the asparagus in with the sauce.

This was good. I used a pound of asparagus, eliminated the water, used 3/4 c broth, and only a splash or two of milk. Still there was too much liquid - I ended up thickening it a bit with some corn starch, and straining away the extra liquid upon serving. The Parm cheese did not want to melt when I mixed it in - it just got clumpy. Next time, I'll just sprinkle with cheese when ready to serve.

I like it! Agree with other reviewers...cut down on the liquid.  I removed the water entirely and cut the broth and milk in half.  The asparagus steamed fine, and the sauce was appropriate viscosity and intensity of flavors.

I have to wonder if this recipe is for asparagus soup?  I read the recipe and decided there was too much liquid in it, so I omitted the vegetable broth.  Also I used a whole pound of asparagus, not a half pound, and I steamed it ahead of time.  Even with these changes there was still quite a bit of liquid so next time I will reduce the milk to 1 cup.  But the flavor was very very good, the sage and thyme and Parmesan cheese were the perfect blend for this vegetable.   I will make this one again.

Loved it but used about half of the broth and no water.  Also added a little more thyme.

I went with some other reviewer advice and reduced the liquid to one cup each broth and milk.  I think it was just a little too liquidy but not bad.  I had one bunch of asparagus, and used 2-3 tbsp parmesan and just a couple shakes of poultry seasoning since I didn't have any plain sage.  Would definitely make again, with just a little less liquid.  Thanks!

This was ok, but I thought the dried herbs really detracted from the delicate asparagus flavor. I won't be making this again. Thanks anyway.

Maybe I did something wrong, but I couldn't get the sauce to thicken.  Also, the asparagus cooked for way too long.  The potential is definitely there, though.

Too much liquid in this recipe. Even with one pound of asparagus rather than 1/2 pound, this was still was too watery.

I had some fresh asparagus, and was looking for something different. Generally, I do the olive oil saute with garlic, or butter with lemon. Unfortunately, I think that I'll be sticking with that method as I prefer my greens to be crisp, and these were very infirm. I didn't change any of the measurements, and didn't have a problem with the sauce being watery, but there did seem to be too much of it for the asparagus. It did actually taste pretty good, though! Maybe I'll try making half of the sauce to serve over sauteed asparagus, in the future.

Was a huge hit!  I used 3/4 cp milk and 1/2 cp chicken broth and used dill and basil for seasoning since those were the ones I had on hand. Added a little more chicken broth towards end of cooking and stirred in as it was a little thick. Turned out perfect!
