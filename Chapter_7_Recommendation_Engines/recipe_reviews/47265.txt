This tastes great and was so easy to make.  I left the orange juice out because it just sounded weird.  The salsa gives the beans a nice kick and it was good with sour cream.  We'll make this again!

Ok, but odd.  The flavors don't necessarily compliment each other.  Maybe if you are a HUGE baked beans fan.  My husband suggested next time just use a can of pinto beans.  I think I will try that.
