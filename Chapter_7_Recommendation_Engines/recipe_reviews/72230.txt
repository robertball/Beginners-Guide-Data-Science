This is not a review... it's my recipe and it's supposed to say that the beans should be drained and RINSED.  Also, I specified that any combination of beans would work, but contrasting colors make the best presentation!  But, you know, I think it's a 5* recipe, so I'm going to give it 5*s just to get you guys started!  Enjoy!  p.s. to "likkel"... why would people who don't like cold bean salads even try this recipe?  that's like saying vegetarians won't like a beefsteak recipe!  And WHY would you feed it to your husband, knowing he doesn't like garbanzo beans??

This was so good Cathy! I used garbonzos and pintos in this recipe and added some chopped cucs and black olives. This is a very refreshing salad and went so nicely with our spicey pork tenderloin. Thanks so much!

I thought this was pretty good. My husband wouldn't eat it. I made him try it and he first picked out the garbanzos since he doesn't like them. People who don't like cold bean salads won't like it. 

I used Lime instead of lemon; and red beans in stead of kidnet beans. I did half with fresh cilantro and half with fresh parsley and I liked the cilantro better (but I love cilantro); the parsley batch had a nice fresh flavor.  I tried adding some (thawed) frozen corn and thougth that was good. I added some more chopped red onion since that gave it nice flavor and crunch and a bit more tomato was good.

Great recipe,  but I used cherry tomatoes.  I have made bean salads before and they taste great, but leftovers can be too watery if you use chopped/cut up tomatoes. With cherry tomatoes the leftovers taste great too.

I made this for a family get-together in July and got rave reviews on it. It was so refreshing after we'd spent the day out in the hot sun!

I added a can of butter beans and a clove or 2 of smashed garlic. (I whisked the garlic, lemon juice and olive oil together before pouring it over all the veggies and beans.)

Fresh and flavorful, and I love the light, refreshing dressing.  I used all ingredients to taste and a 2:1 ratio of olive oil to lemon juice.  I added some finely chopped green pepper for a contrast in flavor, color and texture.  Very festive as well as delicious.

This was simple and delicious!  My tastes required a few changes, but the beauty of this recipe is that it's versatile and you can easily make swaps.  I added some finely chopped cucumber, a splash or two of balsamic vinegar, and topped the served salad with feta cheese.  We ate this along side some grilled chicken and I even sprinkled some of this on top of some salad greens--yum!  The next day, I took the leftovers and added them to a prepared can of tomato soup and sprinkled in some additional garlic powder and dried basil and topped with a little feta.  My kids gobbled it right up!

Thank you for this very easy to put together bean salad. I changed based on what I had on hand. I used white and black beans for the contrast and yellow cherry tomatoes cut in half and cilantro. I didn't have capers so I left that out. It seemed it was missing something and it may have been what the capers did for it so I added only a teaspoon of ACV and this is perfect. I will be buying capers next time.

This is amazing. I made this along with,  the Fiery Fish Tacos with Crunchy Corn Salsa  and it was amazing. Then I at the bean salad as a salsa both alone and mixed with the salsa from the above recipe, amazing, then I took both salsas and put them on my breakfast burritos, amazing!!

Highly recommend this dish. It is very versatile, fresh, healthy and great for many summer dishes.

Very good.  I added some garlic,  and I'm glad I did--this salad needs some perking up, but not too much.  It's still pretty basic and very good.  Easily added to for personal taste.  As with most bean salads, this gets better the longer it sits. Thanks for the recipe!

This is an awesome recipe! So easy, so handy, different, light.....I can't say enough good about it.  I served it as a main coarse over a bed of spinach.  You could do this a little warm over a bed of couscous too.  Endless possibilities.  I have the tex mex version on next weeks menu plans.  We aren't vegetarians, but I do only cook meat once maybe twice a week. This is a good protein filled meal that you can prepare easily at the end of a work day, or for a weekend bbq.

The lemon juice added with the lemon zest made the lemon overtake the flavor for me.

A very versatile dish that you can tailor to your individual meals and your own taste. I added feta cheese and black olives right before serving to play up the zing.

So refreshing and delicious!  Wow!  I couldn't stop eating it.  I'm not a huge fan of bean salad.  All the ones I've ever tried were just bland, but this was out of this world.  Since I've never made a bean salad before, I was afraid to vary to much from the original recipe, but I did make two tiny additions...I added a small clove of minced garlic (fresh) and a little bit of pepper.  I wouldn't use cherry tomatoes as I thought the cut up tomatoes added to the "sauce".  Perfect.

This is so good...really. It was easy to find ingredients for and easy to make...Leftovers are especially good as the flavors have more time to meld.  My 7year old loves this!  Thanks for the wonderful, healthful recipe!

This is an easy and delicious salad. I followed the recipe but used white beans with black beans, and sliced grape tomatoes. The dressing is awesome. It is definitely a keeper and one I'll make often. My husband is not a salad fan, but loved this one!

I wish the recipe was updated to specify to rinse the beans, not just drain. After I added the ingredients and had a frothy salad, I went and read the original posters comment about needing to rinse the beans. I also think the salad was missing something with the overall flavor profile. Beware to rinse the beans or else have a frothy salad :(

I used the lime-cilantro suggestion as my family doesn't quite like a lot of parsley (we don't eat much parsley in Malaysia) and it turned out wonderfully well. I didn't use capers, and couldn't work out how to get the lime zest. It was still so flavourful and my family loved it when I brought it to our weekly lunch. I made it twice last week (took some to work over 3 days) and will definitely make it again. Thank you for a great, easy recipe!

Super quick and easy recipe. I used a food processor and chopped the red onion for several Mediterranean dishes all together to save myself the step in the other recipes. I love the dishes Allrecipes gathered for their Mediterranean dishes.

This is so good as a side dish or a meal on its own. Great for potlucks or packed lunches.
We have made this many times and usually use halved grape tomatoes and extra capers.
Delicious!

This was great. Added cucumber and mozzarella perline. Omitted the lemon zest (personal preference), but not the lemon juice. Served it with sautéed shrimp, garlic bread and a bowl of fresh spinach to mix and match. Great dish for a hot summer night.

I’m on a long sailing trip and have been looking for recipes easily made in a rocking galley. I made this one today, but with a can of tomatoes and dried parsley. I made it the night before because conditions were predicted to be rough for lunch preparations the next day. I think the overnight soak helped reconstitute the dry parsley. It was delightful to have such a

I’m so obsessed with this recipe! I like to add olives to it (goes well with the Mediterranean theme!) as well as pepper and extra onions. I’ve made this every day for the last three weeks. I also want to add that i am usually freaked out by raw onions but for some reason the raw spiciness of the onion gets muted by the lemon juice and it just works. Love.

I made this recipe without any changes, and we loved it! I made it again after we had finished it, as it also makes for a filling, healthy snack.

I love this recipe!  I can eat it as it is, use it as a green salad topper, or serve it on meat!  Having a gathering or prepping a snack for the kids?  Put about a teaspoon of this salad into those little bowl shaped scooping tortilla chips and serve on a platter, garnished with a little Parmesan cheese, and dig in!

This was so easy to make, and turned out delicious.  I used what I had for beans:  canned garbanzos and black beans.   I rinsed them thoroughly in a colander before I started. I went the Tex-Mex way, and substituted lime and cilantro for the lemon and parsley.  Also, added some  cumin and chili powder.  It was delicious and healthy.  I used it as a main dish to replace a meat dish, but it makes a great salad/side.

Nice fresh recipe. I added a little cumin, garlic, powder, and cayenne to spice it up. Anyways, a nice healthy side to go with my lunches at work.
