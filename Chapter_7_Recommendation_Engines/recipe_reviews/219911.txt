This salmon is delicious!  I used a wild salmon filet and was worried that the topping would overwhelm the natural salmon goodness, but it only added to it. I minced the garlic and mixed with the other ingredients (no food processesor necessary, imo). I subbed fresh thyme for tarragon, as I did not have any fresh tarragon. I think fresh dill would be great, too. I ended up baking at 400 for abut ten minutes, according to a similar recipe, and it worked out fine, although, I will broil next time for the added browning effect of the topping. I would definitely try this technique with other fish, too.

This was absolutely delicious!  I do not like the taste of mayo, so used non fat plain greek yogurt instead.  Very tangy and full of flavor.  My whole family loved it and deemed the recipe " a keeper"!  Will make many times.....

As a novice cook, this dish seemed like it would be a challenge, but it was pretty easy to put together. Our salmon steak was quite a bit thicker than the 8 oz, so we more than doubled the cooking time before the fish was flaking. As far as taste, both our picky 4 YO and our autistic 8 YO loved it, eating more than an adult serving each. We combined it with a spinach salad with vinegar and olive oil dressing, along with some left over potato salad. I accompanied my dinner with some merlot that our neighbor had to get rid of before it went bad. Over all, a "perfecto" dinner, as my daughter put it.

Wonderful Salmon recipe.  I used dried tarragon in stead of fresh. One thing I did add was Panko crumbs and freshly grated Parmesan cheese which made it a little more crispy on top.  Flavors are wonderful and the left overs the next day were even better.

My family has been trying a lot of different salmon recipes recently - and liking them - but unfortunately, this was a thumbs down from all.  We just didn't care for the flavor combo.  The texture of the fish was perfect, though.

This recipe is simple and fantastic!  I loved using a mortar and pestle, too. I will start doing this more often with more herbs.  I do believe the mortar and pestle help extract bold flavors.  I recommend this recipe to both the seasoned and novice cook!  Your taste buds will thank you!!!!

I did this on the grill and it turned out great. The sauce really helped compliment the salmon. The only other change I made besides cooking on the grill was using yellow mustard instead of dijon.  I think dijon would only improve the flavor.

an excellent, yet simple, recipe.  My kids (2, 4, and 6) ate it very well.  I used basil and thyme for the herbs because that's what I had growing outside

This was amazing.  My wife actually said OMG, this is the best dish I've had in years. I'm not a huge fan of parsley, so I used half a tbsp, and that's the only change I made.  I had really thick salmon fillets, so I heated on the bottom first until the sizzle, then baked at 400 for about 10 minutes and broiled for 2. Delicious!

I love finding quick recipes to make during a busy work week and this fit the bill. The recipe came together quickly and we really liked the flavor of the tarragon with the salmon.  It is a little heavier than we normally prepare with salmon, but, it was a nice change.  Thanks for the recipe!

This salmon is deeee-licious!!! I have made this many, many times not just for my family but for company as well to rave reviews. This recipe is foolproof. I love that I can change up the herbs with whatever is fresh from my garden. Once I remove the salmon from the oven, I usually hit it with a squeeze of fresh lemon juice and a sprig of dill. Yummy!

This was really good. It was pretty salty though, next time I'll try cutting the amount of salt in half.

This was outstanding but I did change the recipe.  I didn't have the fresh herbs so I substituted pesto for the herb mix and did the rest of the recipe as written.
It was wonderful.  The salmon was moist, not overdone, and the pesto herb mixture was to die for.

This is a good keto friendly recipe.  I used regular mustard instead of dijon and the substitution worked fine.  I used dried herbs instead of fresh which probably diminished some of the flavor. Overall good easy recipe that will probably make again.

Very tasty and so easy to make. I didn't have fresh herbs on hand so I used dried and the flavor was still excellent. Will definitely make again with fresh herbs.

Chef John, you never disappoint! I love fish, especially Salmon, and this recipe just brought it to a whole new level! It was a hit at my small dinner party! Unfortunately, I didn't have any Tarragon, but it still turned out awesome!

My husband loves salmon, I don't; so I am always trying new recipes, so that I may enjoy salmon too.  This is it!! I looked at the video, then followed the instructions.  It came out GREAT, it was so easy, and taste so good I made it for a dinner party and everyone loved it.  Thank you Chef John and Allrecipes.

This was a delicious herb spread.  The suggest cook time was right on.  The only difference I made was to add salt to the herb spread (before putting on salmon) as well as the salt on the actual salmon.  I will definitely make this again!

My whole family loved this.  Well we had 4 out of 5- my 9 year old flipped it over and loved the non sauced side.  The sauce is great and I made it exactly as listed, but I used dried herbs and a dash of olive oil to make the paste- it saved me the time and hassle of using a blender and finding fresh tarragon.  We will be having this again and it is has made it into the regular reciepe box- of family favorites!!

This turned out really well!  The cooking times were right on and the herb mixture kept the fish moist and flakey.  The only adjustment I might make next time is to add a few bread crumbs to the mixture to hold it together and prevent it from sliding off the fish as it cooks.  Other than that, it's perfect!

I made this to complement the turkey for Christmas dinner. It was a great success and I was asked to provide the recipe from a number of people at the table. Sent them the link to allrecipes. I have had good success with many of the recipes provided by Chef John. K\UDOS

Did this tonight for the family and it was fantastic. Thank you as always Chef John, you're the best.

BTW I used my food processor because I don't have a mortar and pestle, and it was still a huge success with intense flavour.

Thanks again.

This was dinner last night.  I did not have 8oz fillets but instead had 3 small portions.  I made the herb rub but mine was a bit thinner.  I spooned it over the fish and followed the instructions except for the time.  I cooked it for about 9 minutes and it was browned and gorgeous.  I served it over lettuce with bleu cheese dressing and it was the best ever.  My husband said this was the best salmon recipe I have ever made and he asked me to keep it for future meals.  Love, love, love this recipe and Chef John.  Thanks!

Loved the recipe just as is! Appreciated his notes that indicated it would be fine to use basil and thyme as alternative herbs.  I had lemon thyme, which worked well.

I love this dish.  We forgot to soak our plank board so I needed something else to do with the salmon.  The taste of the sauce was awesome.  And, I love Chef John.  I always learn something from him.  He makes cooking almost foolproof.

Excellent, I follow the recipe, double the sauce because I had bigger pieces of salmon. Never tried tarragon before love the aroma and the flavor that added to the salmon, and cooked them longer.

I've made this on Sunday night for dinner. I've made some tweaks to it. Instead of broiling it, I've baked it for five minutes. But I think it didn't do the sauce justice when I baked it. But it tasted so good. I would love to make this again.

Super good!  Everybody but the picky 4 year old loved it!  The only change I made was the type of herbs I put on.  Didn't have tarragon and Italian parsley, I used fresh basil, marjoram and oregano.  Will definitely make this again.

I have made this delicious sauce delicious sauce several times. I have used it on salmon and swordfish. I find a mortar and pestle to be the best tool to use. This is a keeper!

Did it more than once, with different herbs each time. The result is always outstanding. 

You do not have to use the broiler to get a crispy-looking salmon; a 350F oven for 12-15minutes work. if you are close enough to the heat element. Best results when your salmon has a uniform thickness.

OMG OMG OMG... So, so good. Made it exactly as written, using a mortar & pestle. If you have one, please use it over a blender. If you don’t have one, get one. ?? I tasted the sauce before putting it on the salmon. It was garlic-heavy. However, when broiled on the salmon, it was perfect. Thanks Chef John for another delicious dish.

This is a keeper. Very simple to make and so tasty. I didn’t have fresh herbs so I used freeze dried tarragon and parsley and used the mortar and pestle to mash it up with the garlic. Once you add the mayonnaise and mustard the flavours of the herbs really start to come out. The cayenne pepper was an added bonus and gave an extra little kick.

"OMG" exclaimed my husband last night at dinner when he took his first few bites of this wonderful salmon. I had to make some changes to what my grocery store carries & what I had on hand. 1) Salmon - Farmed :( & was skinless. 2) Used cooking spray instead of 1 tsp oil; 3) dried herbs, 4) Balsamic Vinegar for the lemon (Excellent substitution!) My husband is NOT a salmon fan, but we decided that this recipe was worth the chance to retry this fish. We are so glad we did! And I was so glad there was some leftover sauce in the bowl...
Can't wait to try this sauce with many other dishes! YUM!

I only changed two things: used dried herbs and added pano crumbs for a little crunch. Really good — light but with a little zing from the Dijon. Will definitely make again and again.

Chef John's recipes are consistently amazing. Kudos to him for not going the tried and true "sweet mustard salmon" direction with this recipe. It's got a rich flavor which enhances the salmon in all the right directions. All that being said, it's subtle...perhaps a little too subtle? Next time, I may add more cayenne, or maybe even some yuzu sauce.

Absolutely delicious!! Unfortunately I didn't have the fresh spices on hand so I subbed dried. I don't use vegetable oil these days so I just omitted it and it was fine. I used mayo for my hubby's and kids' salmon but used greek yogurt on mine and after taking a bite of theirs, I actually preferred it with the greek yogurt! We all loved it and I will definitely be making it again!

Super good and the only change was adding 1 tsp of grated fresh ginger to the mix served with rice pilaf and broccolini.  Make sure you  broil the top first as this was the added bonus to this dish.

I have made it twice in a short amount of time. I did not have tarragon so I used rosemary, instead, which gave it a nice flavor. Other possible substitutes might be dill and/or basil. My family loved this recipe! It is so very delicious!

I have made this twice. First time I used fresh basil instead of the tarragon because I had it on hand. The most recent time I did it exactly as the recipe directed with fresh tarragon. I’m not a huge salmon fan though I know it’s so healthy BUT I love this recipe! So incredibly yummy! Really easy too. Strongly recommend trying it!

Everybody at our table loved it, l served it with a side of shrimp and a good size salad and fresh out of the oven bread.  To almost every fish platter at my house l usually serve  a green veggie like kale or spinach and rice, even when l serve the dish with mango salsa.  But today it was an extra big portion of a great salmon and the shrimp.  We will make it again, thanks Chef John!

Delicious! Only change I made was to use dried spices and subbing the tarragon for herbs de provence (didn't have fresh tarragon or parsley on hand). Cooked exactly as directed. My oven got smokey but the salmon came out perfectly! Another home run from Chef John!

Made this pretty much following the recipe.  Used dried tarragon and parsley as I didn't have fresh and added an extra clove of garlic.  This was amazing.  The salmon was so moist and very yummy.  Served with a side of spinach saute'd with a hint of garlic, onion and lemon.  All around fantastic dinner.

Loved it! Changed tarragon for basil and dijon mustard with a bit or horseradish cream (didn't realize I had no dijon so had to think quick midrecipe). My boyfriend and I would definitely eat this again.

Great simple salmon. I have made it plenty of times and it is always good. I ran out of mayo and substituted plain Greek yogurt, but it still tasted good.

I used light Mayonnaise and dried parsley, because that's what I had.  I added some cajun spice to the mix because I didn't have tarragon.  We liked it as an alternative to our favorite Salmon --  Firecracker Grilled Salmon recipe from this site.  The herb crust tasted great!  Easy to make and a quick way to fix salmon.

Made it with basil and thyme from my indoor garden, otherwise exactly as written. Used my toaster oven/broiler.  Tremendous hit with hubby and me. Hubby even said if the grandchildren could taste fish like this "they might even like it!" Definitely goes into our "impress the guests" file. So easy! So delish!

We recently cut out sugar from our diet so my old standby of brown sugar salmon was not an option, that's why I did some searching and found this recipe. I was a little worried because it was such a change from that usual flavor combination, but it was very, very delicious! My only change was that I used sage because I didn't have fresh tarragon.

Great recipe especially if you aren't such a fish lover. I actually add some Tzatziki sauce after its cooked because I love the creamy flavor.
That said I made the recipe as is and really like it even without the tzatziki. If you are like me just pile the topping on but be careful not to over do the garlic.
If you don't have pistol and mortar put the ingredients inside folded tin foil and use a coffee mug to smash it.

Terrific, I cook Salmon at least once a week and is always looking for new ways to make it. This is definitely a winner. The only thing I changed is to bake the fish first for 5 mins and then placed it under the boiler. Served with Fettuccine Alfredo and Spinach. Lady "D".

Delicious! Used Wild Caught Salmon with skin. Estimated measurements as I was too lazy to get the measuring spoons. I’m not sold on broiling as I always mess it up so I went the safe way by baking it at 425 for about 15 minutes. I was also worried about the mayonnaise overwhelming the flavor but I was pleasantly surprised. This will be a repeat recipe. Thanks Chef John!

I made it using fresh thyme and basil, otherwise followed the recipe. I'll make it again, but will use a lot less mayo next time.

Used mainly fresh dill, a little fresh tarragon & parsley.  Excluded cayenne. Followed everything else exactly - including instructions listed in video but not in written recipe (cooking bottom of fish after it's on the pan over a burner). The salmon was beyond scrumptious! Very flavorful and moist!

This was fine.  I used 1 tsp of dried tarragon and parsley, then plain greek yogurt instead of mayo.  The family ate it, but it wasn't our top salmon recipe.

Terrific spice combination.  I reduced the amount of mayo by 2/3.  I made 3 lbs of last year's catch (not fresh) salmon with 3 Tbs of mayo.  All else i increased to recipes specs.  I might increase the mustard as it was not prominent but may be supporting and not noticed.   Living in Alaska I prefer grilling very fresh fish but am always looking for recipes that make frozen for awhile fish useable and tasty.  This recipe is perfect for that.  Thank you for this tasty and creative recipe.

This was good! I had to use dried tarragon but other than that I made it as written. I feel like it needs more seasoning so I added some salt and pepper. I also used cooking spray instead of oil to cut some of the calories. Super quick to make and I had all of the ingredients on hand.  Win, win situation!

Yes I made a change... but only because I had none of the spices.
I did everything like the recipe only used 1 rounded T.  of PESTO in place of the spices, I still added the garlic etc... and WOW!  It is our new favourite salmon recipe...even my daughter who is not a fan of fish loved it! ??

A little too much mustard taste for my liking but other than that it was great.  I had only light may so I did 2Tbsp of it and 1 Tbsp of Greek yogurt.  Will definitely make it again but will cut back to 1/2 tsp of the mustard.

Delicious! I followed the recipe exactly and it came out great! I love the herb crust! oh, one thing to maybe tweak next time is the baking time. A thicker salmon needs to be baked a bit longer, of course. so yummy. thanks for sharing!

BEST x 100000000000 Salmon dish I ever have. The fish is juicy, and smooth. I followed the recipe accordingly, except I used Chervil instead of Tarragon because the grocery store simply ran out of it. It took like a snap moment and its ready to eat. I served it with an Irish dish, Carrot, Parsnip and Potato Colcannon. They are ABSOLUTELY perfect for each other. Neither of them was over-flavoring than the other. This dish is healthy and nutritious. Thank you Chef John.

Wild salmon is expensive, but it was worth every freaking penny!  Aside from using vegan mayonnaise, I followed the recipe exactly.  Truly satisfying, delicious salmon!  I used the leftovers to make salmon Caesar salads the next day, and they was fabulous.  #foodlove ;)

This is one of the very best salmon dishes that I have ever prepared!  Our family loved it.  My 16 year old grandson, who never comments on food, said "Wow this is good.  Make it this way every time, Gramma."

I did have to use dried tarragon but adjusted accordingly.  Thank you for a terrific recipe.

This recipe has become the basis for my weekly salmon/fish meal.  I use whatever fresh herb I have on hand.  By roasting on one pan starting with potatoes and adding fish and broccoli (or asparagus) later, dinner is ready in 30 minutes with very little clean-up. Sometimes I roast red grapes too. Thanks Chef John!

Holy moly. I use All Recipes all the time but I don't think I've ever left a review. But I just had to for this. So SO good!!!! I'm often disappointed in highly rated recipes (though I'm the common denominator!) but this one was amazing and mine looked just like the picture! :) The flavor is incredible but somehow doesn't overpower the salmon. I didn't change a thing. Make this. Make it now.

My husband sometimes is not fond of Salmon but I did this recipe last night and he loved it.  He went up for seconds.  I think the thing that worked for him was that it was not dry like other Salmon recipes.

I followed the cooking instructions to a T.  And it was perfect. The salmon was cooked just right, and the flavour was awesome.  I didn't have tarragon, so left it out.  Used lots of parsley and ground paprika instead.

Made just as directed. With the exception of dry herbs.   It was so tasty. My kids loved it.  My husband was mad I didn't make his piece this way.  (He doesn't like change)   Can't wait to try it again with fresh herbs.

This recipe is excellent!  My husband who doesn't really like salmon insisted on eating this for lunch after he tried one bite  (I had a steak ready to broil for him that went back into the fridge).  I do not like to make changes to recipes the first time I try them so I prepared this as instructed, only I needed to use dried tarragon and dried parsley that I crushed with the oil, and I did not slice fresh garlic but squeezed it through a garlic press. Served with rice and asparagus - as good as a restaurant meal for much less time and $$!   I will make this recipe again and again!

Yum!! Delicious and easy.  I just kind of smashed it all in a bowl and didn't blend in the blender.  My husband likes coarse mustard so I blended a little over his in addition to the blend here.  He loved it! I also only broiled it- didn't need to bake it, but my filets were not super thick.  We will make it again.

I made it exactly as written and it turned out delicious.  Moist and flavorful.  I enjoyed using the mortar and pestle for the first time, and will definitely use that technique again. I served with asparagus, fresh tomatoes and spinach for a fantastic meal! Thanks for a great recipe!

This deserves a 5 star. I made it the first time with basil and parsley and a second time with tarragon  and parsley. Basil is my most favour herb. So you guessed it I liked the basil and parsley the best .Next time it's going to be tarragon and basil!

I made the recipe exactly as it was written with the exception that I grated some lemon zest into the sauce before I added the juice. I thought it was delicious! My husband and other guests really liked it, too. The only other suggestion that I would make is that I will line the dish with foil or parchment paper next time because even with the oil the skin stuck to the bottom of the dish.

I've made this dish a number of times.  One of which was a dinner party.  Everyone at the table raved about it.  The topping perfectly complements the delicate flavor of the salmon. It's my go to recipe for salmon.  Follow the directions exactly and it comes out perfectly.  Just delicious.

Could not have been simpler and the fish was cooked to perfection.  I wasn't fond of the mayo as it made the dish a little fatty.

We normally like our salmon on the grill, but this definitely is our favorite baked salmon.  I've made it twice and used the fresh herbs I have on hand, cilantro, parsley and chives.

The herbed mayo is delish!  Be careful how much you put on the fish.  I put too much but next time I will do it right.

Smple, easy and cooks very quickly.  I didn't have fresh parsley or tarragon, so I used dried instead.  It was perfectly fine (even though I'm sure the fresh herbs would be even more amazing).  I'm a Food Processor person, so I processed all the ingredients in it.  Easy!

I just made this last night, and I am very please with how it turned out. The salmon was moist inside, very tender. The herb mayo seasons the fish well. I did not salt the salmon. One thing that threw me off was that the video says to cook the fish on the sheet pan on a burner on the stove top first (for about one minute or until the fish starts to sizzle), before putting it under the broiler, but the written recipe leaves that part out. I followed the instructions in the video, rather than the written recipe. I first cooked the fish on the sheet pan over a gas burner set to med/high until the fish sizzled, which was well  under a minute. Then I put the salmon under the broiler, etc, as instructed. Chef John said in the video to position the fish about 8 inches from the broiler, but I think next time I will make it a little closer, so that I can have more browning on top without worrying that the fish will over cook. I left my fish under the broiler for 5-7 minutes, but it didn't get as brown on top as I would have liked during that time. It was still delicious though!

This seems really great. I thought I had all the ingredients at home, but didn't have dijon and tarragon. I made it without the dijon and put a bit too much lemon, but it was still very tasty. Will definitely make again when I have everything!

Super recipe. I didn't have fresh parsley or tarragon so I used dried instead and reduced the amount to about a teaspoon each. It all turned out lovely and delicious but next time I may use a tad less lemon juice. It was absolutely delicious.

I did change the recipe, but in a minor way, my husband hates mustard and not too fond of mayonnaise so I reduced the mayo, left out the mustard and put my own herbal mixture of tarragon, Parsley, thyme and lemon thyme. The point being that what is on the crust is a matter of choice and preference. But so very crucial is the cooking instructions. I had been using a recipe from Alton Brown and my salmon was always over cooked. In season we get amazing local salmon from the Monterey Bay, it is very expensive, fresh daily and precious. To over cook it is a cardinal sin. I just couldn't get it right. Following Chef John's instructions tonight I did get the perfect cook on our salmon fillets. He IS the master! Thank you Chef John!!

This dish was perfect. I added fresh basil and and mint to the dish and came out absolutely delicious. Really watch the salmon as it bakes I burnt mine a little. Try this to impress your guests.

This is outstanding! The best Salmon I ever ate! My son had fermented some whole lemons and I added some of that and it was off the chain. Fermented lemons are easy and add such flavor to certain dishes, like this one.

Used thyme and curly parsley. Instead of Dijon mustard I used regular yellow mustard and a bit of fine white wine vinegar. The salmon came out amazingly good. My husband was never a fan of salmon and mayo ( he prefers the salmon that comes in a tin can ), but now he has definitely changed his mind. He finished all the leftovers ( I just heated them up in a little oven) and I am sure he will be asking for more very soon. Thank you, Chef John, for a wonderful recipe. I will be cooking salmon more often now...

I made this for my husband and really absolutely loved it!  I had some salmon and went on allrecipes and this was the recipe of the day, so I didn't bother to look any further.  It was extremely easy to make and cook.  He kept asking me what is in it, and said to make salmon this way from now on.  Not a lot of clean up, not a lot of work, great tasting fish.  win/win/win  Definitely try!

My husband HATES salmon!  Growing up with 8 kids in the family his mom used to make a lot of Salmon patties with the white sauce so, he never cared for salmon at all.  I have tried other recipes in the past to incorporate salmon into our diets but, he could not stand any of them until this recipe.  He loved this!  He told me that I could make this recipe at any time.  I switched up the herbs to what I had on hand.  Basil, Rosemary, Thyme, Sage.. have tried multiple different herbs together with the mayo mixture..... no other words but, DELICIOUS AND ENJOY!

Nice change from my regular salmon. I had used soy, but no longer due to a new gluten free diet. I used 1/2 greek yogurt, half mayo. Also used dry tarragon and parsley. Next time I'll use all mayo, as it never browned on top. Also would add more garlic. I'm a garlic lover and didn't even notice it in the recipes.

Be prepared to leave the salmon in the oven a little longer than specified, depending on the thickness of the cut.  The combination of broiler and oven in this recipe made for a great presentation.  I look forward to experimenting with other fresh herbs.

Quick and delish!  I do a number of varieties of this concept - dill, salsa in mayo topped with slice avos, wasabi and soy sace, etc. I had never tried tarragon.  It made the dish.  Chef John, as usual you sense the nuances.

I used a large Salmon Fillet that was thinner than what John used in the recipe, but it worked out very well skipping the baking after broiling.

We changed it up a bit to fit what I had in my pantry and garden. For my paste I used the juice of one large lemon, chopped up tarragon from the garden, three grated garlic cloves, salt, mayo and deli mustard.

It came out very tasty.

I really enjoyed this flavor profile. I made up some scallops in a separate baking dish and baked the same time as the salmon. It took my convection broiler 7 minutes total, but still didn't get the browning, not sure why. I turned to convection oven @ 350, baked for about 8 minutes, still not cooked through. Bopped to 400 and it took an additional 5 minutes. So much longer cooking times than stated in recipe, but the recipe is well worth trying if you amend your cook time and temp. Thanks for the recipe.

It's a keeper! Very tasty. I used thefresh basil and thyme for the herbs and added a little melted butter when combining the herbs and garlic into a loose paste. Better than many restaurants in my opinion.

This is the best salmon recipe I have ever tasted! The only things I changed were to substitute fresh dill instead of tarragon (didn't have any) and omit the cayenne, since we are not fans of spicy. Super fast and easy to make, but with a sophisticated and delicious taste!

This sauce goes well on white fish as well. I use it with tilapia all the time. The sauce is rich and creamy. It always comes out good. I have managed to convince my boyfriend to try fish because of this recipe.

I liked this salmon. What I liked most about it, was how easy it was to make. I have never done the mixed combination of broiler and oven, although I have seen it done at restaurants. It stopped the meat from getting too dry from the broiler alone. I had only one large piece of salmon. I wasn't sure the ounces, but I cut it into 5 or 6 pieces and just doubled the topping for it. I used Dukes regular mayonnaise left over from the holiday, but I might try light next time. The topping doesn't really create a layer, but more just keeps the salmon moist. I lined a jelly roll pan with thick foil and sprayed it with Pam and it worked fine. The only thing I changed was using 1 tsp of dry tarragon for the fresh, for twice the topping, but used fresh parsley. I just blended the sauce in my Vitamix blender for 30 seconds approximately, stirring once. It saved time, but next time I will mince the garlic well first. The only thing I thought this needed when done was a light sprinkle of salt and pepper and a squeeze of fresh lemon on each piece. ty

It is an excellent, delicious salmon! I didn't have tarragon at home, and I used dill instead! Served with pasta, it was great, very fast and simple recipe. I recommend it to everyone.
Thanks chef John:)

Our doc says to eat more fish and we're not fond of it but we don't mind it with sauce. I used summer savory instead of tarragon (because we don't like it)but made everything else the same. I didn't like the mustard flavor but my husband did. Next time I'll split the sauce in half, one with mustard and one without and hopefully I'll like it better and rate it again. I served it with a mixed green salad with a lemon garlic olive oil dressing and quinoa both of which went nicely with it. I'm still on the hunt for a fish dish we'll love ;)

Very simple to follow, used sweet basil because I could not find any tarragon in my local market.  I liked the results and so did my roommates.  We live in the Western region of Abu Dhabi, in spite of our desert location, the fresh veggie and fruit market is well stocked.  Next, will try this with a local fish, hommour.
