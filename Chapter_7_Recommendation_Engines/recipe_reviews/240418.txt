This was an interesting recipe and I was intrigued by the crock pot aspect.  I tossed everything in the crock pot before work and came home to...well, I'm not sure it can be called a "soup"; it was more like "cheesy potatoes".  There was some significant stickage to the sides (I'd sprayed it, too), but that is my fault as the recipe calls for intermittent stirring.  While the taste is fine, the texture is just a bit too gluey for me.  I fought the urge to add stock to it this morning and now I wish I had.  It's not something you'd serve guests, but it is certainly worth trying for yourself to see if it's up your alley.  THANKS for the recipe!

I have been making this forever from a recipe my mom gave me. I started out making it in the Crock-Pot but have since moved to cooking it on the stove top. Much less time! Also I also tend to add more milk depending on how thick I want the consistency to be.

I made this because I was literally looking through what I had on hand.  I just got out of surgery and still have a son to feed.  Luckily we both really enjoyed it.  I added salt & pepper to our tastes but the recipe itself will be something I use again, for sure...ty!

This doesn't really turn out to be a soup. There isn't enough liquid and the tater tots fall apart. I would say it makes more of a thick almost mashed potato dish. It has a nice flavor and is a good comfort food.

This turned out to be a big crockpot of bland-tasting mush. May have to use it as a dip for tortilla chips after I try to add some flavor.

My boyfriend and I really liked this! I didn't have ham and I added some cayenne, garlic & Worcestershire sauce for a lil extra flavor. It doesn't come out soupy, turns out more like a thick porridge consistency but we both thought it was super tasty!!
