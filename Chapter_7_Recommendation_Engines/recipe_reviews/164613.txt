I am the submitter of this recipe.  You need to add the olive oil to the rest of the seasonings while marinating or coat each chop and then put the seasoning on the chop, even if freezing.  Then no additional oil is needed to either pan fry or grill.

This is the only way I make pork chops now.  I follow the ingredients exactly.  Usually buy 16 to 20 chops, throw ALL of the ingredients (including oil) in a gallon ziploc bag with 4 chops as soon as I get home from the store and throw them in the freezer.  Thaw them our and throw on the grill.  Heaven!   If you change the recipe and then rate it, you're rating your own choices not this recipe.

I gave this 4 stars only because I liked the basic recipe but I improvised it quite a bit. I marinated it all day rather than 2 hours with the oil, garlic, and ginger but added red wine vinegar, salt and pepper to it. Then when I cooked it I did so in a pan. About half way through the cooking time I added 1/2 a lemon's worth of juice and some worcestershire sauce. I also added small amounts of water as the pan got dry. My husband and children really enjoyed it and we aren't generally a pork eating family.

hey abbeypat...this recipe didn't even call for fennel.  What the heck?  It called for sage.  Not fair to give a recipe a low score when you didn't follow it correctly.

Most of us liked it. Because of time constraits I broiled them in a minioven with some oil covering the bottom of the pan. I used refrigerated mustard, fresh sage, and ground ginger mixed with a little oil and lime juice.

7-24-11:  Ann said this was very good; I thought it a little dry - maybe I overcooked the meat.

IMO, these were just okay. I made one change, using rosemary instead of ginger. I know that's a major change but I really wanted the seasoning to flow well with dinner. It was good, but not WOW fantastic.

I rate this low only because I added too much fennel and it was way too tangy of an outcome.  If you've never worked with fennel before (like I hadn't), it is potent and releases its flavor during the cooking.  So it may smell mild, but it is not if you are not careful.  We will try these again, but the mistake was mine--not the recipe's.  I still would recommend it for its easiness.  As a last little note, I would reduce the cooking time.  I had medium to thick chops and this timing was too long.  They came out pretty dry.

I added rosemary and red wine vinegar.  I made the olive oil and vinegar a 1:1 ratio.  Turned out great.

This is a terrific recipe and I will be making it again.  I didn't have ginger paste, so I substituted with 1/4 tsp dried ground ginger + 1/4 tsp apple cider vinegar.  (Also, I'm not a fan of olive oil so I used canola oil.) I marinated the chops in the frig about 8 hours and cooked them in a cast iron skillet.  Absolutely delicious!  Thanks for the recipe!

i couldn't quite imagine what to expect but these were very tasty!!  increased the spices--browned chops then baked covered in dutch oven at 350 for 30 min,  on top of onion slices.   had some coffee setting in a pot, so threw some of that in for liquid.   will def make again!!!  served with mashed sweet potatoes with raisins.  thought it would taste asian, but it didn't.  just GOOD.

Yummy with (crispy mashed potato pancake I found here) apple sauce and green beans with bacon. The chops flavor was mild but good....I like spice so next time I'll increase the spice. Thanks, Happy Cooking!

Some adjustments that I made: added enough brine leftover from some fermented mushrooms and garlic to cover the chop along with some Worcestershire sauce. Also, I added some of those mushrooms and a small onion while cooking until caramelized and then served with some sauerkraut. This was the first time that I have cooked pork chops and it was super easy, thanks to the submitter!

All I can say it excellent!! My family enjoyed them and my husband even had seconds. I used a tenderloin that I cut into chops and marinated in ziplock baggies overnight then I cooked them in cast iron skillets. I posted a pic too they seared excellent and were very yummy. A new favorite in my house.

While good, the taste of spices didn't come through.  Will double up on them next time while leaving the amount of oil the same.  Definitely worth a try.

Found this recipe just in time to marinate the chops for 2 hours.  I was concerned the flavors wouldn't come through but I was pleasantly surprised.  The chops were moist and favorable.  My family loved them.  I used 2 Tlbs of fresh sage because I had it in the house.  A definite keeper.  Thanks Prell2k4.

This was a great recipe!  I think the grilling option is probably better than the skillet option.  I did it in the skillet and I had a lot of splattering and smoke.  It got done a lot faster than the instructions, too (5 minutes on side 1 and 3 minutes on side 2).  I used Football Forever's suggestion about the ginger paste, but with rice wine vinegar instead of cider vinegar:  1/4 tsp. dried ginger and 1/4 tsp. rice wine vinegar.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly.  In the future I would make more marinade (it just barely covered the pork) and marinate it for a longer time (the marinade flavor was very subtle).  I am also going to try SCC's suggestion and broil them in my mini-oven to reduce the smoke and splattering, but I don't know if I will still get the wonderful seared top and bottom.  This method really made even boneless pork chops juicy and, as the name states, succulent.  I haven't ever had boneless pork chops this wonderful: they are always boring and bland, which is why I usually use bone-in pork chops instead.  Finally, it was extremely easy to make!  There are absolutely no cons with the recipe other than the smoke and splattering, and those would definitely not occur on the grill.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Best pork chops I've made in a while.  I marinated them in plastic bag with olive oil, spices listed and added some fresh rosemary.  Also took suggestion and added some red wine vinegar.  Marinated them several hours.  I used my new digital meat probe to verify that they were the correct temperature.  They were done after 7 mins on the first side and 6 mins on the second side.  They were very juicy and tender.  I will make this again.  After removing the pork chops, I put some mushrooms in the pan, added red wine, and cooked until they were done.  Yummy.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!
