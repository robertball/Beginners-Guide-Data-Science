I changed the recipe a little. I did not use the corn or peas and added garlic. It turned out great. Very good flavors and my husband loved it!! The soy and sesame oil gives it that pop!!

Excellent! I added just a splash extra of the sesame oil and soy sauce. Very good!

Very tasty! I am not personally a huge fan of the texture of Quinoa however this is a delicious easy and healthy way to serve it up. I used olive oil instead of canola and left out the peas and cilantro (HATE cilantro). Definitely a keeper!

Great dish! We enjoyed this a lot! This is also very versatile. I used Sesame seeds instead of sesame seed oil...as that was laying around. Also I added a green pepper garlic and a small onion as they needed to be used. We will certainly be making this again.

Tried this tonight - I didn't use toasted sesame oil as I did not have any. Also added an egg and scrambled it up in the mix before adding the shrimp. With the addition of some dried chili flakes for a bit of bite it wasn't bad!

My husband who loves Asian food liked this a lot. My jury is still out on quinoa... This dish was very easy and took exactly the amount of time stated. I substituted red onion and left out the cilantro since I only wanted to use what I had on hand. I would add an extra teaspoon of sesame oil and add egg into the mix next time.

This was incredible! I did make some changes though I did not have green onions so I used half of a regular onion. Then I did not have corn so I couldn't add it. I also only had a peas and carrots frozen mix. I used olive oil because that is all I carry. I also added about a tablespoon of ketchup with the soy sauce. It came out perfectly! Thank you so much for sharing this!

This was great! I made some minor changes. I used egg instead of shrimp and coconut oil instead of canola. I also added a little garlic. I will be making this one again for sure

Needs something for a signature taste doesn't have that. I added salt and pepper to taste then a little chili powder to get it Still not there. I'm confused on the many 5 star ratings

Will definitely make again but next time will cut the corn and peas in half. I will also add the onion (vidalia not green) later than suggested since I prefer my onions al-dente in dishes like this.
