I made this recipe without the gin for a church group of men.  I think they died and went to heaven when they ate these wings.  The other thing I did different was that I baked them in a 350 degree oven for 30 to 40 minutes.  Yum!  This is a keeper!

This sauce is delicious--it's not too sweet like a lot of barbeque sauces.  I didn't have gin so I used rum, and it worked out well.  Kids and husband loved it.  I used it for pork ribs in a slow cooker for about 4 hours after 1/2 hour in oven first.  Meat just fell off the bones.  Highly recommended!

Very good, I also think the broth needs to be thickened.  Definitely use less water.

the marinade is very strong. 





this was great! i've made it twice now for party crowds.I buy a 5 pound bag of frozen wings and drummetes.separate wings and marinade into 2 large plastic bags and marinate over night.Then i grill over low heat turning once. This you must watch while on the grill. because of the sugar, it will burn easily. this turns out great!

I made this recipe with pork tenderloin and barbequed it on the grill.  It was great.  I called my sister and she made it today and they also loved it.  Thanks for the recipe.

I won the prize for best appetizer using drumettes.  I saved some marinade and thickened it and then brushed on as I baked them at 350 degrees for about 35 minutes.

Delicious chicken wings, I am from western New York and believe me I know wings!  I followed the recipe exactly; I marinated them overnight and my only difference was to bake them in the oven.  I chose this recipe because I am always looking for something different and the gin stood out.  I will make this again however I will omit the gin - it gave a slightly bitter taste.  I will also leave out the soy sauce, it didn't add flavor just more salt.   I disagree with another reviewer that bottled teriyaki marinade is just as good, no way.  This is a good recipe and in my opinion will be better with slight modifications.

Fantastic resturant quality wings!  Served it to a group of people that finished every one and couldn't stop licking their fingers. When I make this again for just my hubby and I, I'll add something to give it some heat or at least more of a zing. But if you're cooking for a group that you don't know their heat tolerance...the recipe as it is ...is lovely!

Finger-licking good!! We all loved these wings. I don't use oyster sauce so I used more soy sauce instead, and I substituted brandy for the gin. I also added the honey to the marinade rather than brushing it on. After I took out the wings, I boiled the marinade and served it as a dipping sauce. People also used the sauce on their burger sandwiches and the flavor was beyond!

This is a keeper! I didn't have oyster sauce, and they still turned out great. I sprayed a piece of foil with Pam and placed it on the grill then put the wings on it. This helped keep them from burning.

This recipe should only take 8 minutes to cook on each side NOT 20 then 25!! I realized mine was burned on one side after only 12 minutes. It was still awesome tasting even though they turned out "country dark".

It was pretty good. THink I will leave out clam sauce though next time. had a slight fishy after taste. Will add more ketchup or perhaps BBQ sauce into it. I will also try to make it hotter(spicy).

Followed the recipe exactly and marinated for two days with country-style pork ribs. Absolutely mouth-watering.....everybody went nuts over it. My husband is sitting next to me moaning over the leftovers as I type.  

We did forget to brush the honey on, so I'm not sure if that would have changed anything. Also, as someone else said, watch it closely on the grill because all that sugar makes it burn easily. 

Definitely a keeper!

ok, we didnt do it exactly like it says, we jsut needed a recipe for how to cook them.  it is such a good idea to refridgerate them for 20 mins.  im makes so much difference.  for the sauce, we just got some from the store pre-made and poured it on the wings.  it was really good.  :)

I made these wings a few weeks ago and they were wonderful. I did not have liquid smoke or gin so I omitted and they were still great. I added a bit of srirachi sauce for some kick and definitely did not cook them as long on the BBQ.

Great tailgating recipe! I followed everything in the recipe with the exception of the liquid smoke (as I didn't have any) and I used chicken drummettes instead. Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe!! It will be our staple tailgating recipe for the upcoming season!

This was super easy and delish!! I omitted the oyster sauce and the liquid smoke flavor (only because I didn't have any) I also baked my chicken wings for 40 minutes turning over after 20 minutes.

I was expecting this to knock my socks off! It was as good as wings that we get in a restaurant but not better. If you want to make restaurant quality wings though this will do the trick.

Delicious!  We made these wings on the grill and forgot to brush with honey but still great.  We had these for dinner last night and I've got thighs marinating in this tonight so we can have tomorrow!  Even my parents were impressed!

SUPER DELICIOUS! Tried this yesterday and was a hit among guests! I didn't have enough teriyaki sauce so I added just 1/4 cups or less. I also did not add gin or liquid smoke flavoring. BUT IT TASTED GREEEEEEAT! Make sure it's slow-cooked over the grill so it won't burn. Turns out nice and golden :) Will definitely use again!

Excellent!  The only change I made was to cut the gin in half.  I used this on chicken breasts, and it was awesome!

This was a tasty sauce.  I especially liked the oyster sauce giving it an interesting flavor.  I might use it on plain chicken breasts in the future.

I served it at a party and they were gone in no time. I didnt put the honey on b/c I was afraid it might be too sweet and it still turned out great.  Marinated in bowl over night.

Did exactly as listed except for oyster sauce. Didnt have any. This was to die for!!! Hubby and I both loved it. Used the little bit of sauce that was left over the next day for hot dogs. Will try this again with different cuts of meat.

Very good overall, and the honey at the end is great.  A little too much Asian influence in these though, I was hoping for more barbecue flavor.

the secret is about the marinade and you have to turn the wings frequently once on the BBQ... people call and ask me to have a BBQ so they can get wings... i do between 15-20 pounds and never have a wing left. 

TURN THE WINGS A LOT

AWFULLY SWEET!  So sweet we could only eat a few.  Smelled and looked great but if I ever were to make again, I’d cut the sugar in half (and probably wouldn’t use the honey either).

My family really enjoyed these wings. I didn't add the Gin, because I didn't have any and only used 3/4 of a cup of oyster sauce, because that's all I had, but it was still tasty! I did cook them in the oven (I didn't have the option of grilling at the time) at 350 for 20 minutes, flipped for 15 more minutes and 5 minutes under the broiler. I also cooked them on a baking rack so they wouldn't boil in the juices. I think it did help with the texture.

Not sure what all the fuss is about… we were not that impressed.  We made these wings exactly as directed with the minor exception of leaving out the liquid smoke because we cooked them on our smoker and didn't feel it was necessary.  They were good, but certainly not great.  We will continue our quest for the best grilled wings recipe.
