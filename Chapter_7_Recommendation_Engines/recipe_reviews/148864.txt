The chicken was fantastic! I made this chicken but used the peanut sauce recipe from 'peanut sauce II' I don't have a grill, so I skipped the skewer and grill bit and just fried the chicken in a frying pan, then served the chicken and sauce over rice. I had a guest over for dinner and he kept commenting on how good it was! I'll definately be making this again!

I'd give 4.5 if I could.  The chicken was very tender, and the peanut sauce was OK...  I think I'd sweeten it up a bit and add less soy sauce and more chiles next time, but that is just a matter of personal taste.  What I hate about EVERY peanut sauce recipe I try is the reliance on peanut butter!!!  The sauces you get in really good thai restaurants don't have that same waxy/silky texture that the peanut butter produces, but I simply cannot find a peanut sauce recipe without it!!  Maybe time to create my own (and then post it!)

YUM!  This was great.  It made a lot of sauce, but it was good.  My sister in law is from Thailand and this was very similar to her chicken satay.  Thanks!

Like everyone has said, this recipe makes tons of sauce.  My solution?  Make a full meal out of this by cooking up some rice noodles and green peas, putting the chicken on top, and spooning the sauce over it all.  May not be the most "authentic", but it tastes delicious and means I don't need a separate vegetable dish.

Loved this dish. A few adjustments: broiled instead of grilled the chicken and used dried chili pepper flakes instead of fresh (what I had on hand). Made a lot of sauce but the sauce tastes so good, that isn't a problem. I think the sauce would also be great tossed with rice noodles.

What a lovely recipe! I last had chicken satay with peanut sauce 3 or 4 years ago and have been hankering to try it out for ever so long! There is definitely too much sauce for this amount of chicken, I suggest   making only 1/3. (I'll be freezing the left over though; it just too good to throw away!) I also suggest tasting your sauce and adding whichever ingredient you feel is lacking. Finally I processed my onions to get that 'minced' requirement and it worked like a bomb!

This recipe is fantastic! I just made a few modifications to the chicken based on reviews and from looking at other satay recipes.  I added about 3/4 tsp each of cumin, coriander, turmeric, and about 1/2 cup of plain yogurt in with the marinade and I upped my chicken to 1.5 lbs of meat. I broiled the chicken strips instead of grilling because my grill-master wasn't home.  I made the peanut sauce exactly as written except I used vegetable oil.  I served it with rice and used the peanut sauce on my rice as well as dipping the chicken  YUM!!!!!  I didn't want to stop eating, but eventually I had to!!!

The only thing I added was 2 tsp of curry powder to the sauce to give it just a bit more depth and a 3 inch piece of lemongrass (took out the lemongrass after cooking sauce for 10 min)  I was afraid to add the fish sauce, but very glad I did.  It does make a difference!  Thanks for the great recipe!

This recipe was a big hit at our block party!  I substituted red pepper flakes for fresh red peppers and it tasted great -- a perfect little kick at the end.  I've already shared this recipe with a number of people, as everyone was asking for it!

Mine needed a bit of salt and I used 2/3 cup of smooth peanut butter.  It was still really good..I even added a pinch of dried red pepper flakes and eliminated the seeded chiles and it was fine. I wish mine was a little more sour though.  Still awesome!

Took this to a football game party a while back and it was an enormous hit.  I followed the recipe exactly, except that I broiled the chicken.  Served it with lime wedges for those who wanted an extra kick.  Solution to the oft-mentioned problem of too much sauce-make double the amount of chicken!  And do use boneless/skinless chicken thighs-much more flavorful.  A hint on the fish sauce-you must use this for the sauce to be anywhere near authentic, but the best and least stinky kind are those that are filtered and appear clear albeit amber colored...if the fish sauce is cloudy it will be extra stinky (even the clear stuff smells like gym socks).  When put into the recipe, you don't notice the taste but will notice if it is missing. Even the proprietor of the Asian market I got my red chilies, coconut milk and fish sauce at recommended a clear fish sauce, Three Crabs Brand Viet Hu'o'ng.  THe bottle was huge but that just means I'll have to make this again and again...such a big it it is now part of my regular repertoire for parties.  Awesome recipe...the BEST SATAY I'VE EVER HAD!

The flavor was great, but we didn't like the chunky texture of the sauce. Next time I'll swap out the shallots for a bit of onion powder and will use smooth PB.

Don't let the smell of the fish sauce scare you off - This is excellent and friends always ask for the recipie.  The sauce is way too much for this appetizer, so I save the excess for chicken stir fry another night.

I probably won't make this again...  I could still taste the fish sauce.   OH my goodness, when I smelled the marinade....  Everyone ate it and said it was good...  But I could smell the fish sauce...

Loved it! Fantastic flavour. I was a bit weary about the fish sauce so I left it out but now I'm curious about what it would taste like and I'm feeling confident so next time I'll give it a whirl. There will definantly be a next time!

I thought this tasted great.  My only complaint is the sauce quantity doesn't match the amount of chicken.  I have tons of delicious sauce left over.  Hmmm....maybe that's not a problem.

This is a lot of fish sauce and it smelled and tasted fishy.  We enjoyed the recipe (which I made as directed) but if I make it again, will reduce the fish sauce significantly.

This recipe is great. I was very impressed with how good the chicken was. I was skeptical of the marinade but it was perfect. The sauce needs to be finished "to taste". Mine needed more red pepper (I used a 'saracha' red chili sauce), soy sauce, and lime juice. I also ran mine through a processor to make it smooth. We had it for "picky" company and they like it. Served with steamed broccoli and lightly curried rice.

I only used the marinade on chicken, but it was lovely and SIMPLE. Fish sauce does *stink,* but it adds a great flavor to grilled chicken.

This review is for the chicken only - I used a different peanut sauce recipe (coconut allergy). The chicken was wonderful - I was a little skeptical, but overall very happy with the dish - I marinated for about 2 hours. The chicken was moist and had fantastic flavor.

Didn't have time to leave it for the full hour or skewer the chicken onto sticks but this was SUPER YUM! The addition of coconut milk was a fantastic addition. I also added bok choi in the last 2-3min which gave some colour and contrast in texture. TOTALLY RECOMMEND!!!

YUM! Made this exactly as directed - including the fish sauce! - and it was heavenly. Very authentic, very mouthwatering satay. All of us here, we couldn't get enough! I halved the amount of sauce, which in a normal recipe would have been perfect, but we were fighting over the last drops for rice. Add in some big juicy chunks of pineapple and oh! What a dinner!

As I was making this for kids, I backed off the shallots some (4 seemed a lot) and upped the brown sugar just a little in the sauce, and it was great.  Stir fry some veggies and noodles, and the leftover sauce will work great for that too.

Very good sauce!  I added some stuff too it only because I like mine a little more flavorfull.  For the chicken however, I spiced it up with some mint, cumin, corriander, garlic, ginger, salt, and pepper.  The I added it to a skillet that was already simmering with curry paste and olive oil.  Coated it well and cooked until chicken was almost done.  Then I added about 1/2 cup of coconut milk and lemongrass and let it simmer down until thick.  Delicious!!

Very Yummy!    Used Crushed Red Pepper Flakes instead of peppers, decreased the fish sauce a bit and increased the peanut butter by 1/4 cup to amp up on the peanutty taste in the sauce.

As is, I thought the sauce was a little too sweet. I would omit the brown sugar and up the soy sauce and/or fish sauce a little to make it more savory.

Excellent as is. I also made this with a few adjustments inspired by peanut sauce II such as substituting honey for brown sugar, and adding some basil at the end and it was good, though I'm not sure if better. I think that using peanut butter made of only peanuts (yes it exists) will produce the best quality sauce.

I went to high school in Thailand and chicken satay is a favorite.  I don't have an outdoor grill so I just grilled the strips on the George Foreman.  They weren't very pretty so at first I thought "oh no this isn't going to be REAL satay," but the flavor was actually quite good - a little too salty, but good.  The peanut sauce was not entirely authentic tasting, but it was very very good, and we all enjoyed it.  It's VERY close to another chicken/peanut sauce/rice recipe that I have that we all love.  Really nice.  The sauce makes a LOT so I tossed the extra with hot pasta, a few additional "saucy" ingredients, green onions, and peanuts, and served the chicken with that.  Will make again!

I thought this recipe was great as is - I didn't do anything different. Served it with jasmine rice and broccoli sautéed with roasted sesame seed oil, garlic and soy sauce - it was wonderful. The sauce amount was perfect for 4 adults, although I did increase the amount of meat/marinade by 1/2 (used 1.5 lbs. meat).   Oh yeah, one difference is that I used turkey breast instead of chicken thighs - turned out tender and not dry at all.

This was very very good.  I didn't have chili's so I used crushed red pepper.  I'll need to add in more next time as it didn't have as much spice as I would have liked.  The sauce was slightly running at first so I up'ed the temperature and constantly whisked until it was thick.

The chicken was great, tons of flavor! The sauce came out way too thick and sticky for my taste, I added a ton of water, some lime juice, and some red curry paste to thin and kick the flavor into high gear. I'm going to try grilling the chicken this summer, I'm betting that charcoal will make it even better!

I didn't use this sauce recipe (maybe next time!) but the chicken was AWESOME!  I only had time to marinate it for about 30 minutes, but it still had a ton of flavor and was super moist and juicy.  I'll definitely make the chicken again, though... no question!

This was awesome!  I did not use the red chile peppers because of my small children (added red pepper flakes) & used natural chunky peanut butter as well.  I served it over brown rice with broccoli sautéed in a few tsp of sesame oil.  I will definitely make this again - very easy & flavorful!

It was good.  I left out the chile peppers, but will try it with them next time because I would like a bit more flavor to the sauce.  Would make again.

The sauce is amazing. But I did add a bit more to the chicken to marinate in. I added some coconut milk, grated ginger, garlic, and soy. I broiled the chicken as it was way too windy to grill. Very nice!

this peanut sauce is awesome!! I did however add 1 1/2 tsps. of curry, but otherwise great. I also had some left over coconut milk, so I added it to the chicken marinade. Oh and I read the recipe wrong and put the oil- which I used sesame - in with the chicken to marinade, so hopefully that works out well.. lol..
otherwise thanks so much for sharing, the peanut sauce rocks!

I found the peanut sauce  lacking of flavour to be honest. I am used to a richer consistency with a delicate yet powerful blend of flavours. I added tamarind and that made a difference. But I wouldnt make this again. The chicken was fine tho

The chicken was so good!  I didn’t have coconut milk to make the peanut sauce so added lime juice and rind and Thai red chili to the marinade and had it without the peanut sauce.

Fantastic flavoursome dish. The chicken is Devine, though the sauce is very rich, it’s so tasty, just don’t put too much on your plate.

The marinated chicken turned out great, but I was disappointed with the peanut sauce. I did not have fish sauce and used oyster sauce instead -  that may have been why the sauce disappointed.

Super yummy! Didn't do skewers or grill, just pan fried in sesame oil. Added some cumin and ground coriander to the sauce. Next time will top sauce with cilantro and minced green onions. Makes a ton of sauce so thinking this will be dinner again tomorrow. No complaints about that!

personal taste aside, it is a solid recipe. I noticed that some other people complained about using peanut butter to make the sauce. To that I say what else would you use. I mean you could make your own peanut butter, but that again is using peanut butter. I mean the level of pomposity that goes into a comment like that is both ignorant on the level of of cooking and on the level of comprehension.

I wasn't sure that the chicken would be seasoned enough with the 3 ingredient marinade... it was!
Peanut sauce was outstanding!!! My husband  loved this recipe! I served it with brown rice and we stirred some of the sauce in the rice...yum!!!
Will definitely make again!!!????????

This was awesome and so easy. I didn't think the simple marinade of the chicken would amount to anything, but was surprised how simple could taste so good.

This was really, really good.  I loved how simple the marinade was.  I did decided to add some of the dipping sauce to the chicken while it cooked.  It was so juicey!  Based on the reviews, I expected to have a lot of sauce so I made this with rice noodles and assembled thai lettuce wraps with lettuce, cucumber, and pickled carrots.  This is definitely a keeper!
