The basics of this recipe are great.  I went with a cinnamon graham crust which was terrific.  I also substitued with light cream cheese and light cool whip.  We live in Florida so always have frozen mangos in the freezer.  I drained the frozen mangos and used the jiuice as part of the 1 cup cold water....really added to the flavor.  My husband Loved this dessert.  Very nice and light with great mango flavor.
