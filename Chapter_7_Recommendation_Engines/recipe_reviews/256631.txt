I fully expected this chicken to be sweet however it is not. This savory, juicy chicken with a touch of spiciness cooked up in no time in the CIO. This is definitely a keeper and no doubt would be equally as good with other preserves such as apricot or orange marmalade.

Really good. Used chopped fresh peaches and some bottled jalepenos.  Just simmered them together with a touch of sugar until they were thickened slightly.  

I marinated the chicken in about half the seasoning and 1/4 cup of the peach sauce for about 4 hours, then put the rest of the seasoning on and about 1/2 the sauce. Grilled, brushing on more sauce. Then served the remaining sauce with the chicken.  We all really enjoyed this!

Grilled the chicken on the BBQ - off direct heat/flame - and was really impressed. Excellent recipe.
