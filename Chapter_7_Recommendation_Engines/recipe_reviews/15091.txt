Instead of melting the chocolate to drizzle on top I simply added whole semi-sweet chocolate morsels. You could even try the peanut butter kind or even reese's pieces. This was a popular and easy dessert.

These are a yummy treat, very easy to make. My 5-year-old made them with me and he had a lot of fun pressing the crust into the pan and then (gently!) pushing the peanut butter mixture into the chocolate layer. Also, I completely forgot to add the tablespoon of milk and it turned out fine without. The cook time on the crust seemed a little long, though. Just be sure, as one reviewer mentioned already, not to overcook it. It would be better a little lighter and fluffier than mine came out. Next time...

I thought these were pretty good. I followed the recipe exactly,but my peanut butter mixture was not crumbly at all, it was like thick peanut butter, so it was hard to spread, it turned out more marbled than layered...maybe I should refrigerate it first next time??? They were good anyhow, just not as pretty.

As of late, after all I've baked for my husband (Trust me, it's alot!!) now all of a sudden he thinks these are his ALL TIME FAVORITES!! Creamy, addictive, like candy bars, and he claims even better coming from the freezer! So you know now they freeze well too!  Make sure you plan the way you'd like to top it with chocolate. Presentation is also important.  I drizzled one way with the chocolate, then crossed over the other way!  Pretty for chocolate! Thank you for your recipe!

Very yummy!  I added more powdered sugar to the topping to make it more crumbly- going according to the recipe it just becomes thicker peanut butter.  Besides that very easy and good!

Extremely tasty but hard as rocks to cut.  I also had to add 1/4 cup more powdered sugar to get the peanut butter mixture less mud-like.

When I made these I made it exactly as suggested other than using soften butter rather than fully melted. And I added some chopped peanuts between the chocolate and peanut butter. I made them specifically for my boyfriend because he likes peanut butter much more than I do. When I tried them I knew they were too rich but he agreed that there was waayy to much peanut butter. I think if you used a 9x9 pan and cut the peanut butter mixture on top in half it would be descent. I'm was a little disappointed because all of the rave reviews had me pretty excited. Overall a big disappointment for us, I'm gonna give them to the teenage boys next door.

Honestly, this one of the worst things I ever tasted. My niece said it tasted like rotted peanut butter crackers. I can't imagine how anyone rated this with 5 stars. Normally if I didn't have something nice to say I wouldn't say it at all, but this consumed money and time. :(

I should have gone with my gut and used softened butter instead of melted as the recipe called for.  Neither the crust nor the peanut butter topping came out crumbly as the recipie indicatated.  Not a favorite.

Really sweet.  Extremely rich with chocolate and peanutbutter taste, almost overwhelming.  Next time I might add a layer of jam to cut down on the richness.

Took these camping.  Family loved them.  My husband, who normally doesn't care for chocolate/peanut butter treats,  went crazy over them.  I tried to make the peanut butter layer "crumblier" like others did but next time I will follow directions exactly since I think that layer would be better if it was gooey.  Will make these again!

Ugh...I was SO excited to make these for my peanut butter loving husband for father's day, but they did not turn out!  I followed the recipe (after reading reviews I used 9X9 pan, and added a bit extra powdered sugar to top mixture to make more crumbly) pretty much exactly.  

I knew they wouldn't be that great once my hubby started cutting into them and they were HARD AS A ROCK!  He actually gave up, and ate a crumb instead.  On the flip side, my 3 yr old and 1 yr old both gobbled them up.  They flaked apart and were super crumby, not in a good way either.  

Maybe it was just something I did, but if you want a sure thing for peanut butter/chocolate bars then try a different recipe!

I agree with other reviewers that the proportions were all wrong in this recipe for a 9x13 pan, and there was just too much peanut butter filling overall. So sweet and rich you couldn't even taste the cookie crust. Not for us. I think I'd do better with a peanut butter swirled brownie.

Pretty good, pretty easy, but I didn't LOVE them.  I used high quality milk chocolate chips instead of semi-sweet since I always have them on hand for my chocolate chip cookies.  I may make another batch and mail them to my brother, the real peanut  butter freak in the family, to see what he thinks, but I probably won't be making these for my house again.

These ended up being much too flat for a 9x13 and not tasty at all. Try something else.

I thought this recipe might be the same as my mom's, and since she was out of town I tried it.  It was okay but not as good. first of all, there is way too much peanut butter mixture and not enough crust in my opinion. what my mom does with her bars, is to spread the peanut butter on first, then melt all the chips on top and run a knife back and forth alternately lightly through it.

These bars taste very good, but they are rich and very sweet. I would have rated them higher except that the result did not match the recipe. The layer of chocolate chips on the cookie crust did not melt. I used a name brand chip. I couldn't spread them on the crust and even if I could have I think they would have been a very thin layer of chocolate, not like some of the photos here. The peanut butter mixture was sticky and very difficult to lay on top of the not melted chocolate. As one other person said the result was more marble like. And the pieces fell apart when I cut them. However my family loved the taste. So I'll probably try them again but make some changes to improve the presentation .

Not bad. First time making these. I took the advise of adding extra powdered sugar to make the peanut butter mixture more crumbly. These are almost impossible to cut. don't use a metal pan or good knife or you'll ruin it trying to cut these. Thankfully I used a glass baking dish.. not sure if I'll make these again. Too much work for not tasting as good as they sound...

My husband called the gourmet peanut butter cups. I doubled the crust part, but next time I'll just do 1.5 I also increased the qty's for the chocolate layers too, but followed the peanut butter layer exactly.  For the top layer I didn't have any shortening but I understood it was needed to help soften the chocolate, so I used a little canola oil cause that's what I had.  I stirred it into the chocolate over a double boiler and it worked great!  I'll use that trick again!

This is really rich, too rich for me! However, my family ate it & loved it. I would suggested doubling the recipe if you want it to fill a 9x13 pan. Otherwise there isn't enough crust to fill the bottom. Same on the peanut butter layer & top chocolate layer. It also isn't very attractive so if you are going for presentation this isn't it.

This came out for me how it looks in the original picture.  But I did have to modify it a bit.  I used about a cup more flour for the crust when trying to make it crumbly but I gave up (was still very yummy)..I have have misread about crumbly crust.  And I tripled the amount of chocolate and shortening for the topping....there was just no way that little bit could cover a 9X13 pan.  It came out so good...I was worried about the taste of the crust but it was really good too.  Will definitely make again.  Still a lot left because a little goes a long way...even with the crowd I cook for every weekend. I cut it up into 2 inch squares.  :)  Yum!

These were better the next day.  Maybe it's because I totally undercooked the crust part of it.  I also used a FULL BAG (less the 1/3 cup for the over the crust layer) of mini-choco chips and 2 spoonfuls of Butter Crisco for the topping, and spread it as a thick layer of frosting.  Could've been a bit more peanut butter'y, and they're really sweet.  But, they have killed the Sugar Beastie that's been ragin' in me lately.
