This was amazing! I will be making this again and again! I couldn't find fresh mango's and so I actually used a bag of frozen mango pieces. Sometimes these are not very sweet, so I defrosted them by soaking them in a cup of mango fruit juice to make sure they had plenty of sweetness and flavor and added the mango and juice to the salsa. Followed the recipe for everything else and the salsa was amazing! Oh, I did add extra tomato. Good to know that frozen mango can be used in a pinch. The second night we had this, I mixed diced avocado into it, and that was great too! Thanks for a terrific salsa recipe! My husband hasn't stopped talking about it!

This recipe is easily adjusted for taste preferences but each ingredient is essential, contributing to the distinctive flavor and texture of this cool, fresh Salsa. It goes well with a wide variety of main dishes as well as a stand-alone chip dip.

Hi- this is my recipe and I should mention that the cilantro bunch is to your personal preference.  You can always add more if you want.

Used this to top the Marinated Tuna Steak recipe on this site. It was great! I used one whole serrano pepper and removed the ribs and seeds on the other two and was plenty hot for us. Might reduce the cilantro in 1/2 next time.

Wonderful recipe!  I followed the recipe exactly and served with Grilled Shrimp Scampi and Orzo with Parmesan and Basil.  The different flavors made a fantastic dinner and it was great with lunch the next day.  Thank you Frack's!

This recipe was fantastic! I took the advice of another reviewer and reduced the amount of cilantro. Served over tilapia, it was an absolutely a perfect combo!

I made a couple of variations based on what I had on hand and it still turned out tasty: one habañero (deseeded), two jalapeños (deseeded), 1/4 large red bell pepper. I think next time I may try lime juice instead of the vinegar, skip the sugar (my mango and corn were both really sweet) and add an extra roma tomato.

Nice sneaky sweet heat. I substitute a squeeze or two of honey to lure my heat averse diners in.

I was looking for a quick salsa to make for march madness get together and chose this salsa because it closely matched items I had at home. With that said, I did have to make a good amount of modifications: I didn't have sarenno peppers, so I didn't use. I didn't have green pepper and substituted with mini red, yellow and orange peppers. I didn't have cilantro and so omited as well - I feel this is an option you can omit depending on your taste preferences. This recipe was quick and easy to put together and it was well liked by friends and family. Thank you.

I didn't have a food processor so I just did a chunky style and it was nice to have the kick of the peppers balance the sweetness of the mango.
