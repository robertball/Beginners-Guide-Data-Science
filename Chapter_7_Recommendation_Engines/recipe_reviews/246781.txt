Omitted coconut because I dislike it.  Used almond milk not coconut milk in the rice.  Used stevia instead of sugar and no coconut garnish and gluten free breadcrumbs not panko and gf flour.  It was yummy.  Needed another side dish vegetable, but I would make it again.

Loved this dish!  I'm a coconut fan so this caught my attention. Made it by the recipe other than I cooked brown rice before I did the chicken cooking (I'm slow in the kitchen. This gave me breathing room).  Worked out absolutely perfect. Family wanted more!  YUMMO. Will make again. Thank you.

WOW! This dish was amazing. The combination of everything all came together with such a great flavor. Hubby raved over this one.

I made exactly as written minus the rum. It was juicy and flavorful.  Will be making again, and will try putting rum in the marinade this time!

Very good.  Rice was surprisingly sweet. Not sure the bread crumbs needed toasting so long on such high heat.
