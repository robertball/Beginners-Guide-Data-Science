This bread smells wonderful when baking. It's refreshing and light. Next time I would add chopped dark chocolate to make it even more irresistable.

Excellent! So easy to make. I did use splenda instead of white sugar and margerine instead of shortening. I made it in one regular-size loaf pan and it was done baking in 25 minutes. My first time making and eating orange bread. It was delicious!

This recipe was easy to make and tasted great! It's pretty forgiving too - I used pecans instead of walnuts and it tasted fine!

THIS WAS A MOIST AND FLAVORFUL CAKE! I BAKED IT IN A BUNDT PAN FOR 35 MINUTES AND IT WAS GREAT. INSTEAD OF WALNUTS I ADDED 1 CUP CHOCOLATE CHIPS VERY NICE COMPLIMENT TO THE ORANGE FLAVOR. THIS IS A KEEPER!

There are way better recipes for orange nut bread. There wasn't anything I liked about this recipe flavor texture or even how it looked.

I made two batches using the mini loaf pans for gifts. The first batch did not rise very much and I determined that the 1 tsp of baking powder with the addition of the baking soda must be the culprit. I increased the baking powder to 3 tsp and eliminated the baking soda after looking at another recipe. This remedied the situation and the second batch was lovely.

This is great I added a chocolate glaze on top and now I have to fight people off from stealing it.

Yes I will make it again. I did make some changes to what I had on hand. I had several mandarin oranges from a can that I chopped and put on top down the center of the bread before baking. I also used 1/2 honey and 1/2 sugar. It turned out delicious.
