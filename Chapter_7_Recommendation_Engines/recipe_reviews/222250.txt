I thought these were wonderful! The plantain adds a bit of sweet to it which I really enjoyed. I have to admit that I had to make some changes: I didn't have any mushrooms so I used black beans as a substitute. I also added some cumin because, I love it! Great recipe, thanks!

This was a nice change from usual veggie burgers. They are a bit sweet so I topped these with some buffalo sauce. I think next time I might add a few black beans and some cayenne or chipotle to the mix

Didn't meet my family's or my expectations.  I know it's a veggie burger, but it was a little too different in both taste and texture.  To help the texture I recommend finely chopping the mushrooms and olives separately, and then mixing them into the other items that have been blended/processed.  Adding an egg should help everything stick together.
Then for the taste when working with plantains ripeness is a concern, as their taste changes a lot the riper they get.  In my personal experience the greener plantains will add something similar to a pickle taste, which could work for a burger if you like pickles.  I don't know how to give it a meatier taste.
