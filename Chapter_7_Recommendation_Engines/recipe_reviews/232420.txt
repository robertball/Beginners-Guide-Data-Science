Very good recipe, so nice and easy.
I was serving corn on cob as a side so I omitted the can of corn in the recipe. Used basmati rice rather than the wild rice & herbs and I added 1/4 tsp herbs de provence, 1/4 tsp smoked paprika, and pinch of sea salt and pinch of pepper.
It was very tasty and my whole family enjoyed it.

Delicious! I did make some changes because of what I had on hand. I had some leftover rice. I used 2 cups. No Italian tomatoes, just regular diced tomatoes. I saut√©ed 1 onion and some garlic, added the undrained tomatoes, drained corn, some Italian seasoning, a teas of beef bullion, simmered for a bit. Then put in the browned pork chops,  whole. I think I will dice them up next time. I put all in the oven and baked, covered, for 30 min. I didn't use any water since my rice was already cooked. Very nice weekday meal. Thank You!

This is a very versatile recipe that leaves you open to lots of options depending on what you have on hand.  As suggested, I substituted cooked chicken breasts for the pork as that's what I had in the house.  I've also substituted or added broccoli, carrots and peas.  Easy and good.  It's a keeper.  My leftovers reheated well for lunch the following day.

This was great as written, but I was worried that the amount of rice seemed a little skimpy for 4 people, since the box indicates that it's only 3 servings. So I made up for it by adding in about 1/2 of instant brown rice to beef it up a little. 

My husband loves things spicy, so he added cayenne pepper and some hot sauce to his and deemed it perfection. I served it with cornbread.

This is a good skillet recipe. I needed something fast for dinner and this was the answer. Thank you for sharing. Every one really enjoyed it. I did kick things up a notch with some onion and red pepper flakes. This is a keeper.

SImply and easy and gives plenty of leftovers for the week for my wife and I.  We use the pre cubed pork chops because it makes it so much quicker.  All you have to do is heat up the chops and add stuff without having to cut everything up.

I had diced pork I needed to use up. This came together quickly and the husband loved it. I used crushed tomatoes instead of diced because I prefer less chunks. The dish turned out great and we had plenty for lunches for a few days

Oh my this was good! I added one seasoning packet of sazon Goya and salt and peppered the chops. I didn't cook the chops for as long. Otherwise I followed the recipe.  This was very good. Next time I will use spices my boys like a little heat.

Used chicken instead (3 decent sized breasts) seasoned with Adobo seasoning as I cooked it. Water didn't seem like enough, so I added about 2C of chicken broth.  Also added Adobo seasoning to the liquid for more (yet subtle) flavor.  Rice mix didn't seem like enough, so I added a handful of red quinoa.  Used frozen shoepeg corn (heated up first), as well as a pkg of frozen creamed spinach (again, heated up first).  Came out AAAAA-MAZING!!!  Definitely a keeper!

I'm only giving this a 4 because it needs tweaking. I added tomatoes & peppers (we've got an abundance from the garden), also added chili powder & cumin. Other than that followed the recipe as written. It was delicious & all was eaten!! Thanks for the great base :-)

I followed the recipe as directed and I thought it was very good. In the summertime I might opt to add fresh cooked corn kernels just for a fresher taste.

I wanted to try something different with pork chops, this recipe is easy and delicious.  The only change, I added sea salt and freshly ground pepper. Husband  loved it, this is going to stay in my favorites.

This recipe is OK in my opinion. It feels a bit bland despite the seasonings. I added 2 garlic cloves and still it came out bland to my taste. I am not sure if I would make it again. On the positive side, it is extremely easy to make.

Made this but changed it up some. Took out corn and changed rice to yellow rice. I've even left out the pork chops. Kids ate it up.

This was simple and good. I would make again. Great for a quick and easy weeknight meal.
