I've made this twice now...it is extremely popular with both family and friends. After following the recipe,  I used a crockpot to keep the final product warm for an appetizer party. It was a smash!

I poured over rice instead of baguettes.  Family ate all of it and wanted more.  I made a second batch and they ate that also.  Just enough leftovers for a lunch for me the next day.
