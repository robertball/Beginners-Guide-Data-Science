I combined the two Tandoori recipes (I and II) to make a wonderful combination. I substituted the spices from II for the allspice in this one. 

First time I did include the vege oil and the vinegar and forgot it the second time. I prefer it without, but that's just me :) 

I am not very good with rice - it kept turning up dry, but if I can figure out how to keep it moist, then I am sure I'l like this dish even more. Meanwhile it might be good to try it buttered noodles or something. 

In any case, this is a definite keeper. I love it, and will make again.

I didn't have allspice, but I found some Garam Masala in my pantry that I bought at an Indian store some time ago. I also grilled the chicken instead of baking. DELICIOUS!!! Marinate, then forget about it and the next day you have an amazing dinner!

I followed the advise of a previous  review and combined some of both Chicken Tandoori 1 with 2 and
took the breasts to a cook out. We loved it. I would not use quite as much lemon juice the next time I make this, but it is definately a keeper.

I found the proportion of the Allspice WAY TOO OVERPOWERING for the dish. Luckily, I sampled the sauce before I marinated the chicken in it, so I took some liberties and added a bit more yogurt, one teaspoon of sugar, and a handful (1/2 c maybe??) of shredded coconut to the mix, and that toned down the bitterness of it. Even still, my family found the dish too spicy and didn't eat much of it. I did not read the reviews ahead of time, like I usually do. I definitely think a different combination of spices would have worked better.

This was pretty good. I used garam marsala instead of five spice, and chicken wings coz I had no chicken breasts. I slit the wings to get some of the marinate into the meat. I grilled the chicken in the oven for about 45 mins. Good with jasmine rice, but I suggest you make some other side dish coz this is too dry to eat alone with rice. Left overs can be used to make sandwiches or pita bread fillings.

I used a Tandoori spice blend I bought at the grocery store, combined with the lemon juice and yogurt idea of this recipe.  I didn't really measure but used about 1-2 cups greek yogurt with probably 2-3 tablespoons of lemon juice.  I used 5-6 tsp of the spice blend, mixed it all together and marinated my chicken thighs for around 2 hours then baked.  Personally, I don't think you can get anywhere near a real Tandoori flavor with just ground Allspice.

Didn't look, smell or taste like any tandoori chicken I ever had...maybe something was left out of the recipe?  Anyway, the leftovers were excellent in Julie's Chicken Salad from this site.
