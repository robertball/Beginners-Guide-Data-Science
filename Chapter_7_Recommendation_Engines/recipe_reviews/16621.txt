Excellent! No changes, just seasonal additions. Chopped zucchini, fresh snap peas, cucumber, green pepper....you are limited by your imagination. I also learned on Cook Illustrated to add seasoning to ingredients and let sit a bit (1/2 hour) before mixing in the mayo. Seasonings absorb better to macaroni, instead of mayo. Thank you for sharing.

This is a great recipe.  I, too, upped the mayo (Hellman's Mayonnaise because it's the best), and I also added a dash of vinegar to give it a little zing. I  added frozen peas, which adds to the color and flavor more than you would expect.  It reminded me of how mom used to make it.

Excellent!  Very tasty and a unique salad idea.  I upped the mayonnaise to 1/3 cup because I had a lot of veggies cut up, and was surprised to find that that was enough...I had expected to need even more!
Addition:  we did have to add more mayo the next day because it had dried out quite a bit.

It was okay.  I thought it was a little bland and definitely not enough mayo - I had to add a whole other half a cup to make it at all creamy.  It could use some more flavor.  The other people I served it to liked it okay, but I wasn't thrilled.

This was a very good salad.  I used reduced fat mayo and whole wheat pasta.  It turned out great,not to heavy and very fresh tasting.

Refreshingly crisp--not loaded with mayo like other salads. Will make again!

I added a bit more mayo - but this was a great recipe! Loved the crunchy radishes and celery.

I was a nice starter recipe. I can't find radishes (spring radishes that is) in Thailand so I substituted snap peas and green peppers. I cannot buy Old Bay here either, so I added 1/2 tsp of  mustard powder, 1 tsp of paprika as well. I prefer the flavor of Miracle Whip, but as usual - can't buy that here. So for that I added a tbsp of balsamic and a tbsp of white vinegar and a dash of sugar. Then for a little zip I added a tbsp of crushed garlic, a dash of cayenne and thai chili. I thought I had made too much but it is disappearing pretty fast!

I appreciate the inspiration from this dish to use radishes the way one would use red onion for some kick.  I will likely make it again.  This is a good dish, but the recipe as written is just the starting point.  Here's what I did: used a 14oz box of whole wheat macaroni pasta, one bunch sliced radishes, 6 celery stalks, what little green onion I had in the house plus a couple garlic scapes I had (they're like green onions except garlicky), 5Tbl mayonnaise, a dash of white wine vinegar, and then plenty of salt, pepper, and Old Bay seasoning.  It took me a while to keep adding spice, stir, taste, repeat.  It's a simple dish, yet satisfying and I look forward to seeing how the flavors deepen the second day.
