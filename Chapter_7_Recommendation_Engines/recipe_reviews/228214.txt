Way too much dressing for the pasta. I halve it. Love the versatility of the dish. We just use cucumbers, tomatoes, and black olives. Yum!

There is way too much dressing, next time I will only make 1/4 of the dressing called for otherwise it's just like soup! I also only used 1/4 cup sugar to make it healthier, and it tastes just fine... I would think a whole cup would make it too sweet! I'm not sure what kind of mustard the recipe calls for, but I used dijon mustard. Other than that it's great, I will make it again!

Great sweet and tangy flavor! Very light side dish as there's no oil in it. I'd love to add some color to it though, it's not as "pretty" and colorful as most pasta salads, but flavor is great and I will be making this again! Thanks!

I tried this recipe and found it to be very tangy.  I did make some changes.  I used red onion and cut the dressing in half.  I agree the original dressing is to much.  I will definitely make this again.

We used the recipe as stated, sort of. We added a chopped red chile pepper. The flavors worked very nicely together. We will use this recipe again.

This was SO good! I've never made anything like this before but definitely will again.  I used a mandoline to slice the cukes and onions nice and thin and I think that was key.
The only reason I took off one star is that the recipe made WAY too much dressing for the amount of other ingredients.  Maybe with double the pasta and veggies it would work but not with this amount. Still, I will for sure make this again, with half the dressing.

We love dill cuke salads, and the dressing on this one is very similar to what I typically use.  I did use Truvia instead of sugar and fresh dill (twice the amount of dried in the recipe) simply because I had it on hand.  I do like the additional texture that the pasta brings to this salad, and I can see adding some chopped red bell pepper for a little color and grilled chicken which would turn this into a nice (and make-ahead) summer main course.

OMG Kim this stuff is out of this world  delish! I can't stop eating it and I drank the juice right out of the bowl.  Don't change anything just make it.  It may be that I used a fresh picked cucumber that my neighbor gave me but honestly this stuff would be good with a Kroger cucumber.

I did not care for this recipe as written. I had to tweak it, because I didn't want to waste organic cucumbers.  I added ½ cup of mayo, and ½ cup of Crumbled Feta Cheese. I would also advise to cut the sugar and water by half.

It's great!!  Very delicious.  I also halved the dressing and used turbinado sugar instead of evil, refined, white sugar???  I'd make it again with about a quarter of the sugar called for.

I made the dish just as the recipe said, and I took it to a family reunion today. I got lots of compliments and got asked for the recipe. I really liked it, and I loved the dill taste. A hit!

Thanks for this wonderful recipe. I've been making it the last couple summers and everyone loves it. No changes needed. Sometimes I use a tri-colored penne pasta in place of the bow tie for extra color.

I have made this salad many times and everyone enjoys the change from the common flavors of macaroni, potato and pasta salad. It is a refreshing salad with lots of flavor. Sweet and crisp.

Great recipe! Made this for a party and received tons of compliments. 
I used 2 cucumbers and more dill. I think next time I will use 3 cucumbers, definitely enough dressing for the additional cucumbers.
I had to make this about 24 hours before the party and it held up great.

Good pasta salad! You could probably halve the liquid ingredients. There was a lot.  I'll probably reduce  the water next time also.

Very refreshing and light salad.  The only thing I do differently is slice my cucumbers a little thicker and then cut them into quarters.  IMO it seems to be a little easier to dish up.  Either way, it's good!

This is great! I had no white vinegar, only apple cider vinegar so I cut back a little but everything else was on point and it came out perfectly

Good salad.  Yes there’s a lot of dressing but I made it on the side and added what I needed.  I would say work with a little less sugar.  It was a bit too sweet.

Delicious and versatile. As others have indicated, you can tweak this however you like and it works wonderfully--no need to cut down the amount of the dressing, just add more stuff!  Additions I liked from other reviews were feta, mayo, and red pepper flakes, both for color and an extra zing, and extra dill. Might try red/yellow peppers,  halved cherry tomatoes or  small melon chunks next time.

Made this for the 4th of July party and it was a huge hit!!  Everyone loved it and it was very refreshing salad.  I did use organic sugar and did not have dill in the house, used a little thyme and parsley in it's place.

This is an excellent summer salad. Just two little things...
1. Use a mandolin to cut the cukes nice and thin. (Watch the finger tips!)
2. If at all possible use fresh, not dried dill. I think fresh really adds.

Sorry.
Way way too much dressing and sugar. I hate wasting food but probably won't eat the leftovers.
