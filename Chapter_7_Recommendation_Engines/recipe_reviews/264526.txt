5.18.18  Just a drizzle of lime would have worked better for us.  I did have some cotija cheese  in the fridge (more authentic for elotes, I believe),  so I did sub that for the parmesan.  Cotija is probably a difficult one to find in many areas, and I think parmesan would be equally good.  Full of flavor and quick and easy to make.  Kelsie, thanks for sharing, we enjoyed it.

Didn't come out anywhere near the way I expected.  Consistency was wrong, flavor wasn't what I expected.

This recipe is AMAZING! This is only my second time having this dish. I ordered it a Mexican restaurant while we were traveling and thought, "I have to have that again!"
I didn't change anything except that I used the Mayo I am accustomed to and I cut the corn off the cob.  Everything was accurately proportioned. Absolutely delicious ????
