My Grandma taught me to make this when I was a little kid, using the cucumbers and dill she grew in her own garden. Now when I make this, I use reduced fat sour cream in this salad. One of my favorite summer salads.

Didn't measure anything,just  kind of dumped things in till it looked the way I wanted it to.  I had planned to add a squirt of fresh lemon juice but I forgot.  That was pure serendipity  because it was perfect just as is.

The first time I prepared I followed exactly and it is refreshing and delicious.  The second time I added a little more dill and an extra green onion and it was even better.  Hits the spot and is super easy.  Thanks for posting this recipe Mark.

Cucumber salad as I remember it!  It wasn't until I sampled this after putting it together and refrigerating it that I realized this tasted just like Mom use to make…and Grandma before her.  Can't go wrong with this classic cucumber salad.

I was looking for a recipe that would give me the taste of that good ole Cucumber Salad I had many times back in the day, at those church pot lucks.  I have to say, this brought back those memories. I'm not really a dill lover but this is one dish that always gets me.  Thank you, even my daughter loves it.  Funny girl, she loves guacamole, when she came home from work she took a taste of this salad, "good mom, it's so refreshing".  Then went to her guacamole, next thing I know that is put up and she's eating the Cucumber Salad, she said it was so good she had to have it instead. lol

I used light sour cream, and dry dill weed and Vidalia onion because that's what I had on hand. It still turned out great! I used two fresh cucumbers from my garden.

Pretty good balance of tastes, although I would have preferred either another cucumber or less sour cream.  Also next time I will blend the spices into the sour cream before adding it to the cucumbers, to avoid that thing where a bunch of salt or pepper clings to a single cuke.  Overall, though, I'm glad I found this tonight; adding it to my faves!

I made this recipe for friends this weekend, and everyone raved!  The only change I made was to add a little Hungarian paprika.   I heard my German-Hungarian grandmother whispering in my ear to do that, and it was the perfect touch.  :)

I added extra green onion because I thought it was a little bland.   I also added a splash of lemon juice which brightened up the flavor.   Next time I may try half sour cream, half plain yogurt.

I've never had a cucumber salad but had a couple cucumbers I needed to eat so I looked for recipes with cucumbers.  I'm so glad I found this recipe. I followed the instructions exactly, except for substituting low fat sour cream for the regular sour cream. I really enjoyed the salad and will definitely make it again. I need a little variety in my diet and this salad was very refreshing. I posted a picture. It was taken a couple of days after making the salad so the cucumbers weren't crispy but they were yummy!

It wasn't that it was bad, it was just bland. I like a lot of flavor and this fell short. It tasted like it needed more ingredients.

I used very thinly sliced Kirby cucumbers (with the skin on), and some thinly sliced Vidalia onion. I suggest a longer marinating time than 30 minutes, such as half a day to a day. After just 30 minutes, the flavors haven't really melded enough, and the taste of plain old sour cream predominates. I did add a sprinkle of cayenne, to good effect, but not so much that the dressing was dyed pink.

Given the rave reviews, we were disappointed with this recipe.  It was rather tasteless.  Maybe our onions were too mild?

Great quick recipe! I didn't have any sour cream, so I used a lite ranch dressing. I used dried dill (about 1 and 1/2 tbsp).  I have no leftovers. We were eating it before it came to the table.  Yummmm

A little soggy but I'll certainly try again with different cucumbers. My daughter who is the cucumber fan in the house LOVED it. Thanks!

This is a very nice cool salad for a hot summer day! The only thing I will do differently next time is use less dill.
