I am the baker who originally submitted this recipe.  I like the recipe just the way it is as I submitted it because it makes it a thinner, more crisp cookie like a ginger snap (which is my all time favorite!).  Of course alter the recipe the way you prefer for taste, texture or dietary reasons but please don't knock my recipe.  Everyone has their own tastes and what they like.  I am glad to see the recipe is well rated though...enjoy as I have!  :)

Just made these cookies again..  I know, I'm a chocoholic....You too?? 
I sifted the cocoa into the mixture, dry instead of using the extra 3 TBS of butter..  a good thing! Much better cookie than the last too....Abit extra height and more flavor...MAGIC!

I can't really rate this recipe because I didn't follow it exactly! Like other posters, I added the cocoa to the dry ingredients and skipped the melted margarine alltogether. Also, I rolled them in powdered sugar instead of granulated and...I LOVE these cookies! They're firm, yet so soft in the middle, and the powdered sugar is kind of absorbed into the tops of the cookies, creating a subtle marbling effect that I really like. I can't rate the recipe as it is, but with these modifications, it's my favorite chocolate cookie!

The recipe as written isn't bad.  We finished off 2 batches as I continued to fiddle with the recipe.  I finally changed the recipe by omitting the cocoa powder/melted butter step completely.  Instead, I sifted the cocoa in with the dry ingredients and left out the extra 3 tablespoons of margarine. The dough was much, much less sticky and gooey and much easier to roll.  Instead of regular sugar, I rolled ours in powdered sugar and we like the taste and texture better. For the recipe as submitted, I give it 4 stars.  With the minor changes, it's a 5 and definitely one I'll make again and again.

Apologies to the cook for skipping the melted butter/cocoa step, but in the interest of time I sifted the cocoa with the dry ingredients like other reviewers. This is a great, standard chocolate cookie. I used dark brown sugar and a touch of instant coffee to enhance the chocolate flavor and it really suited my tastes.

I agree with reviewer "martinmom" completely with the revisions made.  I made the recipe as is, but I would make it next time with those changes.  First of all, when you melt 3 tbsp. margarine and mix in 1/2 cup baking cocoa powder, it turns into chocolate "glop".  I let it cool, and tried to incorporate it into the other ingredients by stirring, but I finally used the mixer.  I will just sift the cocoa in with the dry ingredients next time. Also, the dough was VERY sticky, even though I left it in the fridge overnight. I had to frequently rinse my hands as they became sticky while rolling the cookies.  Also, make sure to put the dough in the fridge inbetween batches or it will "melt".  The granulated sugar on the outside was...well...grainy... I tried powdered sugar for the next batch and it was much better.  Finally, these are good cookies, inbetween a chocolate cookie and a sugar cookie.  Not overly chocolatey tasting, but not overly sugar cookie tasting either.

these are REALLY good.  The only thing I did different is I did not bother chilling or roll in sugar.  I immedately dropped by large spoon (I always make big cookies) on a cookie sheet and baked.  Flavor and texture was PERFECT

Excellent! I followed other reviewers and omitted the margarine/cocoa step and added the cocoa directly to the dry ingredients. I chilled the dough 2 hours and had no trouble rolling these into balls. Using my small cookie scoop I got 47 cookies, and I rolled some in powdered sugar and some in granulated. Unlike some of the other reviewers - we prefer the look and taste of those rolled in granulated sugar. Mine were perfect at 8 minutes, slightly crisp on  the outside and chewy (almost brownie-like) inside. A new favorite for us! Thanks for sharing!

This recipe is perfect.. there is no need to change it! The only thing you have to worry about is self-control after they are done baking.

These are SO GOOD!  My husband, who isn't a big sweets fan, ate 3 for dessert last night.  He even took 1 with him to work today, saying: "I love your cookies!"  They turned out crispy on the edges and very chewy.  Thanks!

These were some of the best choc. cookies we've had!  Very soft on the inside and just a little firm on the outside.  Yum! I actually added half of the cocoa to the flour mix and the rest to the melted margarine.  Did not have any problems with it all mixing together.

I found this recipe a few years ago and have been making it regularly ever since (in double and triple batches) Even giving them as gifts at Christmas.  As with lots of other posters I omitted the melting butter step, and just sifted in the cocoa.  I also use half butter, half butter flavored shortening.  I LOVE these cookies!

These are the BEST! I make these pretty often. The only thing is, I don't think the extra step of melting the margerine and cocoa in the pan is needed. I leave the margerine out completely. I mix the sugar and butter (actually I used butter flavored shortening in mine) then the eggs and vanilla. I then add all the dry ingredients and mix well. I also don't refrigerate it for an hour. I think if you use butter, like the recipe calls for, then the refrigeration is needed. I am using shortening, so it doesn't make a difference whether it has chilled or not, and I have done it both ways to make sure.

After searching high and low for a "good" chocolate sugar cookie recipe, I finally found this one.  By far, the best taste and the best baking performance.  These cookies can be made to be big or small, flat or puffy.  Just like a regular sugar cookie!

These were just o.k. We should have read the reviews before making.  I will not melt the cocoa and margarine together if I ever make these again.  It ended up in a huge clump.  Trying to incorporate this into the cookies was not a fun experience.  It left little flecks of dark in our cookies. If you make these cookies, I would omit the margarine, and mix the cocoa powder in with your dry ingredients as suggested by other reviewers.  They cookies came out soft and chewy, just not chocolately enough for me.

I had my doubts about adding the cocoa to the margarine and they were well founded.  It clumped and made a big lump of wet cocoa.  Even after mixing there were large bitter clumps in the dough.  I had high hopes, but I don't even want to consider making them again and adding the cocoa powder to the dry ingredients.

Really good recipe.  Cookie was firm on the outside and soft and moist inside.  I made these on Monday and today (Thursday) they're still delicious.  Thanks, Andrea.

My family loves these. My favorite chocolate cookie. I don't do the step where you put the 3 TBSP margarine in the pot and melt it with the cocoa. Not necessary. I just leave the 3 TBSP out all together  and mix everything up like a normal cookie recipe, sugar and butter first, then the eggs, dry ingredients etc. The step of letting it sit in the fridge is also unecessary-this might be because I use butter flavored shortening (Crisco) instead of butter.

Delicious cookies!! I made them exactly according to the recipe and had no problem. I don't know what happened to the lady who couldn't incorporate the melted butter/chocolate mixture, but mine did just fine. I'll be making these cookies again!

Delicious! Soft and chewy. Great cookie. I added the cocoa to the dry ingredients, as others suggested. I also made it a rounded 1/2 cup to make them a bit chocolate-ier. Other than that, I followed the recipe as written. Thanks!

Update: I changed my rating from 5 stars to 4 because I tried the Chocolate Chocolate Chip Cookie 1 recipe from this website and thought it was much better. Cookies tasted great even a few days later unlike this recipe. Previous Rating: This recipe was good. They're soft, chewy, and just the right amount of chocolate.  I also took the advice of the others and omitted the 3 Tbs of margarine. I added the cocoa powder with the flour mixture. They came out great! Best if eaten the first day. Not as good as each day passes.

YUM-YUM. I took others suggestions and combined the cocoa with the dry ingredients & eliminated the 3 TBSP butter. I don't believe it affected the taste or texture. Baked 8-9 mins. They taste like a brownie cookie. Slight crunch on the outside and soft on the inside. Really yummy warm! Because of the ease of these, they will be great for my holiday cookie platters.

I just made tonight. I did omit the margarine and added cocoa powder to flour mixture. I also rolled a few in powdered sugar and the rest in white sugar. My family likes the cookies with white sugar vs. the powdered sugar ones. They remind me of a chocolate snickerdoodle. We all enjoyed them and I will make these again. Thanks.

Yum. I had to use olive oil instead of margarine. I also used goat butter. Very beautiful too because they sparkle.

We love them.  Even my husband (a real food critic), said they are GREAT! He ate 4 as soon as I finished baking.  I didn't have butter and used margarine instead and it worked out great.  I've read the other reviews are saw the comments about the cocoa and margarine, as soon as I melted my butter, I removed it from the heat and stirred in the cocoa, yes it lumps, but I used a hand mixer and thought it worked well.  If I changed anything, I would melt my butter in the microwave and then stir into the cocoa.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

This recipe is soooo good! I made the cookies last night and followed the advice of some of the other contributors. I left out the step with the extra margarine and mixed in the cocoa powder with the rest of the dry ingredients. After everything was mixed together, I let the dough chill in the fridge for an hour, then rolled the dough into balls and sprinkled them with powdered sugar before baking. Baked them for 8 minutes and they turned out perfect!! If I could rename these cookies, I would call them brownie cookies -- that's what they tasted like right out of the oven! Delicious!

One word: Heaven! I went by the recipe except I rolled the cookies in brown sugar/white sugar mixture. They turned out 100% better than my favorite snickerdoodle recipe! Soft and chewy on the inside and crunchy on the edges. Perfection in a cookie! I baked them for 8min. only. I found there wasn't a gooey mess when I added the cocoa to the melted butter. I did it this way instead of taking the suggestions of other reviews because I figured there was a reason that step was there. It has to be done to get that soft, chocolaty center. Thank you for a perfect chocolate snickerdoodle cookie!

Yum - bite-size brownies!  I stirred in 1/2 a cup of mini-chocolate chips and 1 1/2 cups of finely-chopped toasted walnuts.  The first batch was rolled in powdered sugar, but the cookies were too sticky for my cookie jar.  The rest of the cookies were rolled in granulated sugar which worked much better.  All of the cookies, however, were delicious!  And as for the eternal question - to sift the cocoa with the dry ingredients or melt with margarine as directed?  I sifted it into the dry ingredients and increased the amount of butter creamed with the sugars accordingly.  It worked out great and I'll definitely make these cookies again!

Even after chilling the dough for a few hours, it was softer than I expected, BUT it still worked great.  I dipped the rolled dough in "big sugar" instead of regular granulated sugar, as I like the sparkly look and extra crunch it provides.  These are excellent.  Oh--I used an additional 3 Tablespoons butter instead of margarine, as the recipe states.  Worked just fine.

Very good cookie.  I recommend baking the full 10 minutes though.  I baked the first batch for 8 minutes (I prefer a moister cookie) and it was still gooey and raw in the middle.  The next batch i baked for 10 minutes and it was soft in the center but crunchy on the outside.  

I skipped the 3 tbspoons margarine and just mixed everything in the same bowl as previous reviewers suggested and it was very good.  Yummy, thanks for the recipe!

Wonderful!  Just like Sugar Cookies, except - of course - chocolate!  A bit less sweet as not much extra sugar is added and cocoa is bitter.  This is VERY forgiving - I added the flour mixture before adding the cocoa butter or the vanilla, and went AH!  Stirred in the cocoa and it was fine after a bit.  Then I couldn't let it sit 2 hours because it was 10 at night, so I just left it in the cold storage till morning before baking - and they were great!  A nice morning treat.  So, 4 stars for the cookies, 5 stars for simplicity.

I followed this recipe as is and they turned out great! I did need to bake them more like 12-14 minutes, maybe due to the type of pan or the parchment I used. The texture and flavors are great! I am only giving 4 stats because I feel like so

I've looked for a good basic chocolate cookie recipe for a long time.  I've found it! The only changes I made to it were sifting the cocoa powder in with the flour, leaving out the margarine and adding 2 teaspoons of espresso powder to the dry ingredients.  Chilled for 4 hours.  Baked them for 8 minutes.  Crispy edges and soft centers.  Great recipe!

I decided to make these cookies as printed....WITH the exception that I just beat in the chocolate/butter mixture with the beater after adding the eggs.  No problem there.   I did half with powdered sugar topping and half with regular sugar.  I liked the regular ones better.  I did use Hershey's Special Edition chocolate, and, honestly, I am not thriled with the flavor of it.  BUT the cookies were very good.

One word...YUMMY! 
I've been making chocolate sugar cookies for a few years now using devil's food cake mix - which are a favorite among my children and their friends. I was looking for a version that I could make from scratch and this is it! I did follow other's suggestions to sift the cocoa in with the flour though...perfect! 
Thanks for sharing this great recipe!!

YUM!!!  Like others, I added sifted cocoa to the dry ingredients and omitted the margerine alltogether.  I rolled 1/2 the cookies in regular sugar and 1/2 in powdered suger.  I think I prefer the powdered suger, but love them both!  =)  Thank you for the easy recipe!

These were alright...they flattened out quite a bit when I baked them, and had to bake them a few minutes longer than suggsted. I put a mini chocolate star in the middle of them (similar to a peanut butter blossom cookie, just with chocolate cookies) and they ended up good enough. Nothing REALLY special in my book, but a decent cookie.

I made these last night.  They look wonderful (top cracked). Texture was great and they had a soft center which I liked.  I didn't taste the chocolate flavor as I had hoped too.  When I added the cocoa powder to the margarine mixture it glopped and flaked. It wasn't easy incorporating that into the mixture-It specked the dough.  I think I must have done something wrong but I followed the recipe. The cookie was lighter after baking.  Maybe next time, I'll try using butter and more of it to melt the cocoa thoroughly-and add more cocoa to the mix for a darker cookie. I rolled the dough balls in fine sugar.  That made me taste the sugar more then the cookie.  Next time I'll try course sugar and dip just the tops in it.

After reading other reviews I also combined the cocoa with the dry ingredients. I added chocolate chuncks for double chocolate goodness. These were FABULOUS! Almost a cake texture, soft and moist. They kept very well too!

Very good.  I added the cocoa powder to the dry ingredients like other posters.  I did not have time to refrigerate the dough for an hour, so I baked them immediately.  They turned out just fine.

I probably didn't do something right, mine stuck to the cookie sheet and broke into pieces/crumbles after letting cool the recommended 5min before taking off pan. Any suggestions?

These cookies are exceptionally good--crispy on the outside and fudgy on the inside. Also, not too rich or sweet. I had to make myself stop eating these. I made them exactly as written(I like to do this the first time I try a recipe so that I can rate it fairly), but next time I'll try the suggestions of other reviewers to leave out the margarine/cocoa step and roll the cookies in powdered sugar instead of granulated. Try this recipe, it's really delicious!!

I thought these were really easy to make, though I did follow other people's suggestions.  I added the cocoa powder with the flour and rolled the cookies in powdered sugar.  Even my husband who doesn't like chocolate went back for more!

Absolutely the best cookie I've ever eaten, and an all-time favorite with my family!  Has the added benefit of being easy to make.  I followed the advice of previous posters and sifted the cocoa powder with the other dry ingrediants, thus eliminating the messy mix-with-margarine step.  Also, I find that using butter gives a fudgier texture and--to me at least--better flavor.

A definite Hit! Everyone who loves chocolate will love this cookies! and Definitley listen to the advice of others and don't do the margarine and cocoa mix step, just add the cocoa in at the end.

This recipe is excellent.  I have a crazy schedule so my kids make the dough in the evening if I'm working so I can bake them the next day.  Excellent for gift giving too.  I'm also going to try to freeze the raw dough for future use.

the boy sure said "mmm!" a lot.  these cookies chill up firm and dandy in one hour (even here in arizona!).  the recipe made 59 cookies, by my count (and i think i have a quite generous idea of what "1 inch" is!).
