I thought these bars were great, but my two sisters hated them. Not sure why, but I really, really, liked them, so I'm still giving them 5 stars :) They were super easy to make as well. I used quick oats, and they worked very well. The only change I made was to line my pan with Reynold's Release nonstick foil instead of greasing it...I could lift the finished bars out easily, which made cutting and removal much easier, and the bars looked much nicer. I also used the bottom of a measuring cup to press the oat mixture into the pan...it worked great and wasn't messy at all. Thanks for sharing the recipe...I'll be making these again!

Super easy bars!! I heated up the Raspberry Preserves in the microwave for about 45 seconds before spreading them on top of the bottom layer of oats to make it a little easier to spread and it worked like a charm!!!

Love how easy it was to whip up a dessert!  These are really good.  Subbed Red Plum Jam instead since out of raspberry preserves.  A bit too sweet (not because of the jam)so next time I will cut back on the sugar a bit by maybe a tablespoon or so.  Will make again!  Mine are still too hot to eat but I keep picking at it anyway.  So yummy!  ***Update 3 days later:  I just had to make some more!  I love these.  I subtracted 1 tablespoon of brown sugar and it was perfect for me. ***Update 4 days later: Used vanilla extract instead of almond.  Love it this way the best!

I made this exactly as written, except I didn't measure the jam, I just spooned it over the mixture until it covered most of it. Maybe it was because of that, but I found these a tad on the sweet side. I think when I make these again I'll use less sugar. Other than that, these were great.

These are awesome!  Don't know if I like these or Delicious Raspberry Oatmeal Cookie Bars better.  These have the almond flavoring a 1/2 cup more sugar.  I think I remember the others being more crumbly but these ones held together beautifully.

these were very tasty! I wanted to try something a little different and this was perfect. I followed the directions to a "T" and they were perfect. I let mine cook for only 30 minutes and that was plenty enough-will definitely use again. thanks!!!

Followed the recipe exactly, and was a bit worried about how thick the crust seemed to me compared to the pictures, but WOW does it come out perfect! It was not too thick after baking, very easy to cut ito tiny little squares without breaking. They were soooo delicious, and chewy, and whoever said they were not flavourful, must have done something wrong!  I took them to our Sunday family dinner, and even though everyone has become sooo picky due to the amount of desserts they've tasted from me, they unanimously LOVED these!!! (which is rare!) My brothers could not stop eating them, they were sooo addictive! All I could hear during dessert time was "mmmmmmmm mmmmmmmmm mmmm..." Thank you so much for this sooo simple, amazingly delicious recipe! I truly believe that the most delicious foods are the simplest ones! :)

These are absolutely delicious!  The only change I made was to add 1/4 cup chopped walnuts to the topping.  I would save a little more of the crumb mixture for the top next time.  The bottom was thick and the topping was almost gone after baking.  But the flavor of the buttery crust and the tart jam was wonderful!

Loved these bars.  Made these to sell individually for a volunteer project.  Was concerned they would be too sweet but Smuckers brand Red Raspberry Preserves aren't overly sweet.  I doubled the recipe and baked in a 9" x 13" pan.  I used an entire 20 oz. jar of preserves (about 2 cups) so almost double what the recipe called for.  Then I reserved almost 2 cups of the crumbly mixture to use for topping.  Worked perfectly.  Gave a little more fruity flavor and I had plenty of the crust mixture for the base.  By using less for the base and more for the topping, it kept them nice and solid.  Used 1/2 quick oats and 1/2 old-fashioned.  For my own taste I would probably reduce the brown sugar by about 25%.  Will definite make again.

The best raspberry bar I've ever had! I also added about 1/4 cup of sliced almonds to the mixture. Also, before spreading on the raspberry jam I spread about 1/4 cup of apricot jam for a little zing. Great warm or chilled!

These were so good I sent half the pan with my  husband to work- to rescue my waistline! I made them as written with one exception: I only had blackberry jam, so I used that. People went nuts over them. Also, I only have a 9X9 pan, so I baked them for 30 mins. I think it's a versatile recipe that would work great with your favorite jams or flavorings. I think a few pecans or walnuts added would have been yummo too!

These were not as good as I had hoped. Something, can't put my finger on what exactly, is missing from making these a knock-out. We added semi-sweet morsels to the oat mixture and the chocolate-raspberry connection was there... but it was really just OK.

Made exactly as written, except I lined the pan with foil and then sprayed the foil. That way, it was easy to lift off the pan. I loved the flavor of the crust/topping and I know any flavor of preserves or jam would work great on them. I immediately imagined apricot! Yum!!

I, too, didn't measure the jam and covered the bottom (which I'm pretty sure ended up WAY more than 1/2 cup!).
I also used raspberry extract instead of almond extract and these turned out super yummy!

I made these using blueberry preserves and the result was very good!  Because so many reviewers said these were too sweet, I did cut the brown sugar down to 3/4 cup.  I didn’t think 1/4 cup of the oat mixture would be enough for the topping, so I reserved 1/2 cup and was pleased with the result.  These turned out great!  Chewy and not too sweet.  I think you could use any flavor of preserves with excellent results.  I’ll make these again!

These were very good, just not sublimely delicous enough for me to make them again. Very, very easy to make. And I was able to make them with ingredients I had on hand. I used strawberry jam instead of raspberry.

Oh heavens these are good.  My husband couldn't keep his hands off them and he's usually a strictly chocolate lover.  Per suggestion of another reviewer I subbed the almond extract for vanilla and added 1 Tbs less sugar.  And the thing that made them to die for was I used apricot preserves instead of raspberry (because that was all that I had).  I think I'll try plum next and then maybe blackberry. These are definitely a new favorite!

I made this recipe with blueberry preserves a couple days ago....and had a mishap. I mistakingly left out the baking powder... as if that wasn't enough, I baked it too long. Sometimes mistakes can be good. This one sure was! The finished product tasted like scrumptious blueberry granola! We couldn't get enough of this stuff...lol. I will definitely make this again, but next time I will make sure to follow the recipe exactly. This one is a keeper.

I think this is a great recipe to hold on to when you need to fix a treat with ingredients on hand.  I thought they were good--- a little too sweet for me and I would have liked to have tasted the oats a bit more.  I may play with some variations of the "doses" of the ingredients in this recipe next time.

Really easy recipe with great results.  I live overseas & could not get raspberry preserves.  Even though I reduced the sugar to 3/4 cup, these squares were still VERY sweet with apricot jam.  If you are not using a (very) tart jam, consider seriously reducing the sugar.  I will use 1/2 cup next time.  (Some added coconut with the topping is also a nice addition.)

Very Good!! Excactly as described. I only have a 9x9 so they were slightly thinner but still worked out fine. Baked 30 minutes and because of the larger pan, probably could have taken them out at 25 min., but still delicious. We will make these again.

I made two batches of these, first one i followed the recipe to the T, and my husband and I found that the second batch was better, I added a Tbsp of Molasses, it made the bottom crust much more tender and chewier, there was nothing crunchy about it, I poured some whipping cream on top of it and ate it with a spoon.. boy was it yumm-o!

I have made these many times and they always come out great.  I found that they needed a full 40 mins in my oven.  When spreading the jam over the crust, avoid letting the jam contact the sides of the pan; leave just a little space.  I've followed the recipe exactly as written, and have played with different kinds of jam, (i don't even measure the jam anymore) and also made them thicker by tripling the recipe and putting it in a 13x9 pan.  Wonderful, versatile recipe.

Excellent!! These are chewy inside, a bit crunchy on the ends, and the almond flavor is so yummy, even the aroma through the house smells like almond. But!! I am betting these are great just as is, but I drizzled some white chocolate over the top(just a bit) and these are heaven. they probably dont need the chocolate but they look pretty and taste great. Love them!

I thought these were awesome!  I heard that a lot people thought they were too sweet, so I used No Sugar Added Blackberry Jam to try and get it a little less sugary.  It was perfect this way; the tartness of the jam went very well with the sweet cookie bottom.  I'll definitely make these again!

Very satisfying treat!  I did take the advice from a couple of folks and use Vanilla instead of Almond extract and I also reduced the brown sugar by 1 TBS...these were still sweet enough and oh so rich and tasty.  I did press the mixture into the pan very firmly which helped it hold together very well in the end.  I also used Blackberry preserves instead of Raspberry and it was very good.  I would imagine any flavor preserve would work!  :)   I was amazed at how easy this recipe was....simple enough to have the kids help with too!

These were pretty good.  A bit too sweet though.  I decreased the b. sugar to 3/4 cups and still too sweet.  Maybe add a pinch of salt?  All in all though we liked them.

This recipe is excellent.  I made a few minor changes after reading the comments about being too sweet.  Instead of jam, I used fresh raspberries, about a quart, mixed with only 1/2 cup of sugar(jam would have at least 4 times as much), and a tablespoon of clear jel. This made more of the raspberry layer, which was so very yummy. I should mention that I doubled the recipe for the crust and crumble part and used a 9 x 13 pan with the quart of raspberries. Baking time was good at 40 minutes.

All I had was strawberry preserves and I also used vanilla instead of almond extract.  These were very quick and easy to make and were delicious.  Moist and chewy.  I'm sure you could use any flavor preserves!

Pretty darn good, although mine were slightly overcooked and hard on the edges.   The center pieces were soft and chewy.  Just make sure that you watch the cook time.  Will definitely make again and probably try different preserve flavors.  Oh and I subbed vanilla for the almond extract, because I didn't have any.

5 stars!! Very easy, very few ingredients, and GOOD! I adjust the recipe for more servings and use a larger baking pan. They are done in 30 minutes. I sometimes add chocolate chips along with the topping....GREAT either way!!

Easy to make and delicious. Will make again and am thinking of trying other jams, eventhough the raspberry was wonderful!

I used 1/2 Barley flour, and 1/2 WWflour, and used more jam.  They turned out great, but REALLY sweet, next time i'll cut the brown sugar in half.

These are amazing and so easy to make. I substituted the preserves for a pint of fresh raspberries. I used the bottom of my measuring cup to push the crust into the bottom of my baking and then used it to smash my raspberries on top. I WILL be making these again!!
