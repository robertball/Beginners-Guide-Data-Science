I read through this and thought it sounded more like a good place to start, rather than a recipe that can stand alone well. So I added more veggies, like carrots, pea pods, broccoli, water chestnuts, onions, and baby corn, then enhanced the flavor by adding minced ginger root, which I think really made the dish, not to mention took the emphasis off the nasty-smelling oyster sauce. And it turned out absolutely faboo!!!

This dish was quite tasty.  We added a bit more soy sauce, and also soy paste and sesame oil (available at Asian Grocers).  We also added fried tofu, green onions and a can of water chestnuts.  This dish was so yummy that we will add this to our monthly menu. I am sure the dish would be great as is, but we just wanted to add a few more items.

BTW the amount of spice was just right.  A bit of heat, but not too much.

I really hate to rate a recipe so low. I followed this recipe exact except for adding some baby corn,  a bit of sesame oil & a dash of hoisen sauce. This is not authentic vegetable lo mein, it reminded me of vegetable soup, without broth or flavor. There seemed to be too much of an overall broth taste, that was not appetizing at all. Maybe I could have saved this by really dousing it with soy sauce, but I just ended up tossing it out. This was not liked at all, I will not make this again, I'm sorry (:

Very quick but surprisingly good..very good base recipe especially for the simple flavor. I've made it twice now, once as posted, and once juiced up a bit on spices...both were good.

Like others have said, a good basic recipe.  I wound up doubling the soy and oyster sauces, plus I substituted cornstarch for flour (and used more of it) so it wouldn't be so thin.  I recommend undercooking your noodles slightly so that they can finish in the sauce without being overdone.

So good! Really fast, really easy, and it satisfied my craving for chinese food. I added some ginger and a little bit of basalmic vinegar since I didn't have oyster sauce. I'll definitely do it again.

This rates four stars because I loved it and the rest of my family didn't.  I will make it again though. I think I would add a little ginger for additional flavor and add a lot more vegetables, which I found to be the best part.  Thanks for the recipe!

I completely agree with some other reviewers who said this is a good start. Not a bad recipe but I would prefer more taste, pretty bland.

This dish is wonderful. I modified this by flash frying cut steak then, tossing everything together in the hot wok.

Used Hoisin sauce instead of Oyster sauce (since I didn't have any), fresh linguine and chicken broth.  Did not add extra salt since they all say we are eating too much of it.  Excellent flavor...plan to add grated fresh ginger next time as someone suggested.

This is a nice basic lo mein recipe.  I added two tablespoons of chinese chile sauce for some heat & it was perfect. Ignored the bamboo shoots because they scare me... aren't they a means of torture?  Why would I cook with them?  Perfectly lovely lo mein recipe.  Thanks.

We omitted the oyster sauce and bamboo shoots and added water chestnuts. We loved this though. We served it over udon noodles which made a great crunchy vegetable and al dente noodle combination.

I really liked this once I added more sesame oil. The oil adds a really nice nutty flavor to the noodles. I would recommend doubling the veggies though. Not enough for my taste.

Really good base recipe. I doubled the soy sauce and oyster sauce and added onions and used Thai rice noodles instead. I omitted salt since the soy sauce provided enough saltiness to the dish. I'll definitely come back to this recipe in the future.

I have been looking for a lo mein recipe for awhile, so I was thrilled to find this.I just finished dinner with this recipe and it was fantastic! The whole family loved it, although I had to delete the mushrooms as my husband is allergic to them so I added some raw cabbage with the veggies as I had some on hand from some soup I had made over the weekend...this was fantastic.Even my hubby ate a huge plate of it. My brother came to visit and headed straight for it..LOL. I have some left and I can't wait to eat it for lunch tomorrow. Thanks so much for this recipe!

A quick and easy recipe, but be aware that one pound of noodles is a lot.  I added some cayenne pepper to give it a little more life.

I was particularly interested in trying the recipe for the lo mein sauce as I was tired of buying the packaged kinds.  There was virtually no difference between the sauce in this and the packaged version--quite good although not out of this world yummy.  I think I will go back to buying the packaged though as it works out cheaper here in the UK.
