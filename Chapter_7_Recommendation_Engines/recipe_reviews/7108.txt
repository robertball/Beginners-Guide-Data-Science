This is a good recipe that just needs a few adjustments.  First, the batter is too dry and reduced flour or extra milk does the trick.  Personally, as the recipe stands I think there is no point in adding cheddar, as it is drowned out by the cinnamon and brown sugar.  If you want afternoon apple bran cheddar muffins, reduce the cinnamon and sugar, and increase the amount of cheddar.  If you sweet apple cinnamon bran muffins, leave out the cheddar...  Thanks for this recipe, its a great place to start and ends up with many potential great outcomes!!!

I couldn't believe the instructions said to "pour" the batter into the muffin tins -- it was so dry I had to add almost a cup of milk.  The result was tasteless and bland.  I threw out 11 of the 12 muffins and will not be trying this one again.

Wonderfully different and delicious with a few changes (they def need more liquid!), similar to what the first reviewer wrote.
I used 1 cup milk, shredded the apple, used 2/3 cup melted real butter instead of the veg oil, used 1 cup whole wheat and 1/2 cup white flour (instead of all white), 1 cup cheddar and added about 2/3 cup of chopped walnuts.  With all of these changes, it made too much for one batch, so I split it in 2 batches.
My boyfriend and I LOVE them and these will definitely be made again!  Mmmmm!

I found the mixture dry and had to add additional milk.  Not very flavorful.  Would not make this recipe again.

There needs to be more liquid in this recipe-I was somewhat dissappointed in the overall flavor-maybe more cheese.

I'm an amateur cook and this looked easier than it was. Definitely worth the effort if you like bran - YUM!  Could probably use more cheese in recipe and I had to add a little water while mixing, but the cinnamon/br. sugar is wonderful!

The so-called batter looked and felt more like a streusel topping.  I did add a little extra milk because it was so dry, but to me, baking is chemistry and if I have to toy with a recipe as much as some of the previous reviewers did....it just can't be good!  I expect that a baking recipe is correct as written.  Anything more than adding chocolate chips or nuts invalidates the recipe.  My son, who was so anxious to make this with me, and I were terribly disappointed by this recipe, because it sounded so good in theory.

This was a really easy recipie to make.  My 5 year old, who is really picky, didn't like the way they looked, but said that they tasted good on the bottom.  I guess the top looked too "ugly".  I would definatly make these again.

My boys like these.  They are great with milk, (they are a little dry).  Next time, I will add more apple.

Muffin batter very dry, could not incorporate the dry ingredients as the bran soaked up all the milk.  I increased the milk to 1 c., the oil to 2/3 c., the cheese to 1 c. and the cinnamon to 1.5 tsp.  I also added 1/4 tsp of nutmeg.  Will use this recipe again with these improvements.

I agree with most of the other reviews about the dryness. I added more milk and oil so that the flavor didn't go away. My five year old loves them. Easy to make.

Batter was extremely dry + muffins were tasteless.  Also, muffins barely rised despite the high amount of baking powder.

I have made these two times, first time I followed the recipe exactly, the second time I used 1 cup of milk and shredded the apple and cheese, made a much better muffin the second time around!!!!  Very tasty and moist, I will definitely kite this one in the front of my recipe book!

Woah, some of you are being too harsh. These are muffins, not cupcakes. I added a bit more apples and a little more milk. My bf and father loved them since they were not too sweet. Drizzling honey over the muffins adds the perfect touch of added sweetness without compromising the recipe. Next time I will add more cheese, less sugar and continue with the honey. If your muffins are bland, remember when you add more of bland ingredients (such as milk, water, baking powder, etc) you need to add more savory/sweet ingredients (salt if you have more cheese, sugar/cinnamon if you add more apples). Just my opinion.
