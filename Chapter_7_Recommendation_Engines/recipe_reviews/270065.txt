I served the beef and sauce over roasted radishes and mushrooms and it was fabulous and KETO friendly! This is a keeper in the recipe world.

AWESOME! Used half & half instead of heavy cream and dried basil (1:3 ratio) and cherry tomatoes; recommend using meat thermometer as our steaks took a bit longer than recipe indicated and they were perfect med-rare at 125 degrees.

FABULOUS!  Easy to make too.  I made no changes other than scaling the recipe back a little and using bacon-wrapped filets because that was all my grocery store had.
