These are very light and very tasty. I was worried because when I had the whole mixture together I thought there was just too much other "stuff" and not enough of the meringue, but when they were done it worked out just fine. They also didn't puff up very much, so I suggest making little ones that you can just pop in your mouth. Mine spread out a little bite more than they should've because I didn't get the meringue to stiff peak phase, but very close and they still turned out delicious. A little difficult to get off the tin foil, and since they're so fragile I would probably suggest spraying the foil first.

All in all, very easy (after beating the meringue) and it is a nice treat to have them ready in the morning!

Very good, just what I was hoping for.  My two-year-olds eyes expanded twice there size when she saw me "magically" pull cookies out of the oven first thing in the morning.

LOVE these...if they turn out.  It's about a 50/50 chance that they turn out like meringues or if they are a puddle of goo.  Be warned:  Cannot make them when it snows or there is high humidity in the air.
When the weather is right, they turn out great, and are simple to make and taste so light and so flavorful!

Adjusted to 3 egg whites - separated the prepared merengue into 3 dishes for the following flavors: mint chocolate, Bubble gum and Cotton candy..super delicious + taped a note to oven "DO NOT OPEN" :)

Great! I ended up leaving all extra ingredients out (chocolate chips and walnuts) because I didn't have them, but the meringue is still amazing! Will make this again for sure.
