Perfect traditional gravy just like Mom made. And no lumps! For chicken or pork, I use the half milk and half water. But for roast beef gravy, I like to 2 cups of water and no milk (use the water used to boil your potatoes for mashed potatoes to go with the gravy!)

I made this gravy using drippings from my chuck roast cooked in the crock pot.  In order to make a rue with the right consistency, I used at least 6 tablespoons of drippings to the 2 tablespoons of flour.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe for milk and water.  The gravy cooked and thickened nicely.  I'm giving 3 stars only because I was in a hurry, and had I not saved any more drippings than the 2 tablespoons called for in the recipe, I'd have been in trouble!!  Will use recipe again, but more drippings.

I have never had problems making gravy in the past, but this just didn't work.  It wouldn't thicken, and was very bland, even with A LOT of salt and pepper.

i've never made gravy from drippings before and this turned out perfect!!!  though i didn't measure anything..  i just took all the drippings (beef) and added some flour and a dash of milk.  oh, and i added just a bit of beef stock.  i had the corn starch ready, but i'm amazed that i didn't even need it!  i'm glad that i read the dirctions and decided to wait because it only took about a minute to thicken up.  anyway, thanks for posting this, it saved my butt today! :)

This is a good recipe, but it needed some salt and pepper. I used beef stock in place of water for a richer flavor.

I omitted the milk and I used the juice from the chicken instead. Added some oregano, basil and parsley just to get abit of italian taste. My husband really liked it. Went well with mash potatoes and BBQ Chicken. View pic.

This was good, I did add a bit of sage to mine, salt and pepper and the milk without water.  We served it over mashed potatoes on New Years Day! :)

I am a 16 year old boy and I not only successfully made this gravy I made it easily. Other than the fact that it needs more drippings than called for the recipe is great. I needed something quick and simple for a hamburger steak and this was perfect.

This was a great starter gravy recipe, especially since it was last minute and I had to use what I had on hand. I cooked the gravy stove top, but it was quite bland so I added salt, pepper, and onion powder. It thickened perfectly with a bit of time and patience. Be careful not to add to much salt like I did, other wise it was a great recipe with plenty of room to play with.

I made this today to put over the round steak we cooked in our crock pot.. It turned out wonderful!! The meat was seasoned well, so the gravy turned out well seasoned from using the drippings. I will make this again!!

First time ever making gravy without going to the store and making it from the pack. This recipe was very easy. I was looking for something that did not require bouille tabs, stock, or any additional ingredients. This was perfect.  Adding the salt and pepper in the recipe was well needed. Great Recipe!

I probably should have given this 4 stars because I used more drippings and a dash of salt/pepper. BUT the instructions are great. I've never been able to make a successful gravy but this worked!

Did not work for me.  I used beef broth as another suggested in place of the water.  It was not brown in color, didn't thicken and did not taste right no matter how long I let cook or how much pepper I added trying to season.  Will keep looking for other recipes to try.

We forgot to make gravy (again) this year for Thanksgiving, so I did a search for easy last minute gravy recipes.  This recipe came out beautifully, and I did my very best to screw it up at each turn!  You can't go wrong with it.  Totally good stuff.

It came out okay, didn't thicken much and was kinda bland. I recommend using more flour and less drippings!

Don't use this recipe!  Following the directions and exact proportions  . . . the gravy would NOT thicken!  Thank goodness I had a couple packets of gravy mix from the grocery store I prepared which saved our dinner.  VERY disappointing recipe because from the photo it looked like medium brown gravy mother used to make, but the milk and water together made a white thin mixture and not at all brown or even tan.

This was great! Instead of 2 tablespoons of drippings & 1 cup water, I used 2 cups of strained drippings from a rump roast in my slow cooker. All other ingredients the same. A definite keeper!

It would not thicken and tasted like flour water. Thank goodness I saved enough drippings to make a real gravy and saved dinner. I honestly have never given a bad review.

This recipe was ok, but needed to add a LOT of salt and pepper.  I didn't have any problems with the thickening, just could've used a little more spice.

I have never made gravy before, but it just didn't work.  It never got thick and was white like milk.  My boys were so hungry and waiting for the gravy my husband and I winged it with using as much drippings we had left from the roast and added some flour.  It thickened nicely.

I skipped the pan drippings.  Added Worcestershire sauce,  gormet mustard with seeds, garlic and onion powder along with everything else.  Whisked it over low heat. Add ingredients to taste. It came out great without the oil.

I think 2 tbls of flour was way too much, it took the cup of milk, cup of flour and had to add about a cup of stock with a lot of salt and pepper to take down the taste of flour, ended up having to add paprika and chili powder also. just didn't do it for me, following the recipe exact didn't taste right, gonna have to fix this one in the future

I struggled getting this gravy to thicken. By the time I got it to a decent texture, there was little flavor despite the copious amounts of salt, pepper, and garlic I was adding. Maybe I made a mistake along the way, but if I were to make this again I would at least triple the amount of drippings used.

Could never master Gravy on my own.  This gave some structure to my attempt.  I amped it up by adding some diced onion and crumbled bacon to the roasted duck drippings.  Winner, Winner Duck Breast Dinner!!

Used as a guideline for Baked Pasta that needed 12 oz gravy sauce.  Not really sure of the taste since it was mixed with tomato sauce. It did thicken up the ziti sauce and tamed the tomato flavor. Used ground beef dripping and 1 tsp beef bouillion.

Great foundation, can leave as is or spice it up a little. I sauteed garlic and mushrooms in olive oil. Later when gravy was thickening I added and it was an amazing mushroom Tracy. Thanks

Adding the milk is a terrible idea.   I should have known better than to add milk to a brown gravy.

I made the rue from lamb drippings and butter, and used unbleached organic flour.   I cooked them until a deep brown, but it seems I was unable to get rid of the raw flour flavor.   

Usually that's taken care of by just cooking it down and adding more water.

While thick, it was bland even after I added tons of pepper (black, cayenne and paprika) and over three grams of salt.

I used the  beef broth from a beef roast I made, the broth had onion chunks in it.  I used about 2 cups of the broth, and about a half a cup of flour.  I used half butter milk and half milk, 1 cup total.  The gravy thickened very nicely and tasted amazing on the roast and mash potatoes.

Perfect! Smooth and delicious. The only thing I would mention is to check the taste to make sure you don't need more salt or pepper before you remove it from the pan.

This is a very quick and easy gravy, however it taste like boxed gravy. I will make it again and I won't use milk at all and I will use more juice (drippings) and flour. Otherwise, great!!!! Thank you!

I fried sirloin tips and left them in the pan when I made the gravy as directed, then added mushrooms and served over rice. Very good recipe, but a little extra seasoning would make it even better.

This recipe was confusing and you don't want that when you trying to finish everything and get it on the table.  It has the right foundations, but we just had to kind of make it up as we went.  Maybe if the cook could have just had better instructions.  I am a new cook so it may only be me.
