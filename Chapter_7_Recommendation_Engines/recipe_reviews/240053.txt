Yes, I am the creator and these are really easy, few ingredients and very moist.  Kid friendly and helps to sneak some veggies in too. Office mates will enjoy this treat too!

This was really easy to make, and when they were hot out of the oven, we liked them, but the cookies do not keep well.  The flavor was basically chocolaty, soft, but the texture was a little strange.  The real problem, though, was how damp the cookies got.  I stored them in tupperware with waxed paper for a couple of days, and every time I pulled them out to serve them, they were damp, and patting them dry didn't really work because they continued to sweat.  It was unappetizing.  If you make these, eat them right away.

although easy, not visually inviting at all. I'll stick to the original "hungry girl's Yum Yum Brownie Muffins" recipe, which is Yummy, lol.

These definitely are fudge and moist.  I decided not to use the mini chips.  The batter was very sticky and a bit runny but I ended up with rounded cookies and was very pleased.  Used milk chocolate kisses but I think these would be good with any kiss flavor

I LOVE this recipe. Simple, healthier option.  Took them to a party last night and everyone was pleased!
