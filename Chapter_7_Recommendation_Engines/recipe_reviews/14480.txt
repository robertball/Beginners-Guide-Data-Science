I left out the water but did heat the vinegar. I took a course dealing with herbs in cooking and one focus was using herbs in vinegars. Diluting the vinegar really serves no purpose. I found that heating the vinegar really caused the herbs to go to mush. After two weeks I strained out the mushy herbs and replaced them with sprigs of fresh Rosemary. I have used this in a simple vinaigrette dressing and in a marinade and both were delicious.

Delicious, let your imagination run wild with herbs.  This is so much more economical than purchasing those expensive little bottles in shops....easy recipe.

Great!  Made a romaine salad with onion, blue cheese and sunflower seeds and mixed it with garlic olive oil and this rosemary vinegar!  Big hit an so easy.

So simple and fantastic! I don't go through it very quickly, so I've only made it with rosemary so far. Great as a salad dressing (especially for a Greek-style salad with feta and black olives over spinach!), I've even used it as a marinade for leftover steak/pork.

I made this with purple basil.  Beautiful color.  All my herbs took off in my raised garden beds so I can't wait to do this with all of them to give as gifts.
