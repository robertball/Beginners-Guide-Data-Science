Just made it this evening.  Delicious! We did not add the pumpkin spice. Didn't think it needed it. Highly recommend! Takes a little longer than I would like, otherwise,  5 stars.

Has a good flavor and was a hit with my wife's co-workers.  I think next time I make this I will lower temperature of oven to 250.  Was starting to get burnt top at the 20 minute mark
