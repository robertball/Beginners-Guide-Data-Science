This was a great, quick and super easy recipe! After I put the cheese and parsley on it, I put it back in the oven for a short time to soften the cheese. I will definitely make these again...expecially for a party!

These were delicious and easy to make.  The only thing I would do different next time is cut the puff pastry into smaller pieces to make them bite size. Also I'd like to try different cheeses or a mixture of cheeses.

Well, this was an adventure for us. I have never had goat cheese. Just couldn't quite bring myself to use goat cheese. I used the feta. As usual, I made two batches. The first one exactly as written and a second time with some changes. The isntructions are pretty simple andwe really enjoyed them. The second time I made them I added some onion, a little garlic powder and a sprinkle of Mrs. Dash Tomato, Basil & Garlic seasoning. All said both versions were quite tasty and would like to have them again.

I jumped at this receipe because of the goat cheese and th reviews.  I could not keep the mushroom mixture and cheese on top of the pastry and had to use a knife and fork.....not convenient for an appetizer.  I agree with most of the comments that more blending of the flavors is necessary along with other ingredients like onions and peppers.  I think baking the mushrooms and cheese inside a pastry would keep the appetizer together and blend the flavors.

These were quick and easy to make and we really liked them. I made half the batch exactly as written and the other half I added a splash of dry white wine and cracked black pepper to the mushrooms during cooking. I also popped the assembled tarts in the oven for a minute or 2 so the flavors would meld. It made this good recipe, great. I will definitely make these again, especially when I want to impress.

Those who found this not so tasty might want to try 'real' feta, which can be found in the gourmet cheese section of most grocery stores.   American feta is made from cow's milk and is dry and bland - Greek feta is made with sheep and goat milks (and sometimes just goat or just sheep), but the texture and the flavor makes a big, big difference to any recipe calling for feta.

These were excellent! I sauteed the mushrooms with onion, garlic, butter, salt, pepper, and worcestershire.  We don't like parsley so we omitted it.  What a great appetizer!!

I added red and orange pepper to the mushrooms during the saute process. I also added sundried tomatoes as the base. Instead of puff pastery I used slices of artisan sea salt filone brean from safeway. sprinkle with fresh parsley. At the end I tested paper thin sliced cucumber, chilled once pulled out of the oven to ad a fresh crunch. Very yummy!

Great recipe. Everyone in my family loved it. Very easy to make. Be sure to serve immediately after removed from the oven, so will still be warm.

These were great. I made three different appetizers for a dinner party and these were the favorites. I used a combination of shitake and oyster mushrooms and the delicate flavors worked great with the puff pastry. Next time I'll make more.

I made this for a family gathering of about 8 adults, the puff pastry was easy to work with, and I feel that for this appetizer the flattening process was necessary. It does not make it into a soda cracker. I liked all of the components separately but together they should have been exciting but they kind of all blended together the texture wasn't exciting. I kind of blame it on the puff pastry. I think a pizza crust or a crispy french bread may have suited the mushrooms and goat cheese better. They were nice to look at. No one at the get together had more than one, and about 8 pieces got tossed. The general consensus was that they were just okay. The other problem is that these must be served right out of the oven once they get to luke warm they need to be warmed up.

I made these as written, using the feta substitution.  Maybe it was because I didn't use goat cheese, but I was unimpressed.  I thought that they just tasted like the individual ingredients, and didn't gel into a unified flavor.  I think the goat cheese might be the key, and when I was eating them, I really felt like onion would have added a lot to them too.

YYYEEESS!  These were soooooooooo good!  I made these exactly as written, except that I forgot to poke holes in the puff pastry before cooking (and therefore the little buggers really didn't want to stay down after I flattened them)but that didn't affect the taste or anything.  Made these to go with the Rosemary Chicken Kabobs for dinner tonight & between my dad & I they were long gone (the tarts that is, they were even more popular than the chicken).  LOVE everything about this recipe...it is sooo easy to make, quick & the tastes combine beautifully.  Warning:you will not be able to eat just one!!!

Delicious, however I made them as is and fried some onions in a second batch and liked it better. The directions weren't clear with what to do with the puff pastry, so if your not familiar with puff pastry it would be rather confusing. Otherwise great recipe!

Delicious and so easy. I used Phyllo cups after reading some reviews. Worked out great. I also used more garlic than the recipe called for. Other than that, I followed recipe exactly. They are best when hot.

I love mushrooms, and wanted to try this out for an appetizer. I used the mini phyllo shells instead of the puff pastry, and that made these so easy!  Perfect bite size servings.  I also added white wine while sauteeing the mushrooms, and used a mix of baby portabella and white mushrooms.  This was a huge crowd pleaser!  Have already had requests to make it again and share the recipe.

I modified this recipe with a Provolone Italian Cheese and used a square muffin tin to contain all the goodness.  You can add other toppings to make this recipe your own.  This one is a Keeper for sure!

Made these today.  Seems like a lot of work just using 1/2 sheet of puff pastry.  I used a whole sheet,  1/2 lb of mushrooms and 6T butter.  Also added a little white wine & fresh pepper.  Crumbling the goat cheese was messy as it's so soft.  It was only somewhless messy to place the cheese on the mushrooms and pastry.  Didn't have fresh parsley so I used fresh basil.  As a few reviewers suggested I put these back in the oven to melt the cheese.  Our guests raved about these.  We loved them too.  I only rated 4 stars due to the issue with the cheese, but the taste was great and I will make again.

I would add some more seasoning, salt or garlic salt.  I tried cutting the puff pastry sheet in smaller squares but then the mushrooms do not stay on well.  I did like the appetizer and will make it again.

Easy and delicious, will definitely make again. As some people recommended below, I put the tarts back in the oven after adding the mushrooms and cheese.
