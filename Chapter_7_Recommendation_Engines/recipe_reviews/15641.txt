We love the strong herb flavors of this chicken!  If you don't like balsalmic vinegar I would suggest you don't even try it.  I make it with dried herbs as I don't usually have fresh herbs on hand and it turns out fine.  Just make sure to decrease the amounts as dry herbs are stronger than fresh.  This chicken is best when cooked on the grill as the smoky flavor blends incredibly well with the herbs and balsalmic vinegar.  I have made this chicken for a few guests and everyone has said they loved it.  It's great served with roasted garlic mashed potatoes and grilled asparagus.

I definitely recommend doing this on the grill to get the best results.  I had fresh rosemary on hand which was nice and used dried thyme and dried parsley.  I put everything into a mini food processor to blend.  I pounded the chicken down thin and let it marinate for close to 12 hours.  If you're not a fan of balsamic - use white wine or white wine vinegar.  This is a great marinade.  I've tried so many from this site and this is one of the best.  This chicken would be great over pasta!

Fairly easy to prepare and good results.  My only complaint is the balsamic vinegar overpowered the other flavors a bit.

I used my immersion blender right in the bowl I was marinating the chicken (breasts and boneless thighs) and it made for less to wash. I, too, reduced the balsamic vinegar (to 1/4 cup) and increased the olive oil (to 1/3 cup) and found it was nicely balanced. Used dried thyme. Added 1/4 tsp. crushed red pepper flakes as well (we like heat!). A keeper!

This recipe was exactly what I was looking for, a way to make flavorful chicken breast without drying it out. I made a double batch of this for dinner and leftovers. Boyfriend loved it. Asked me to make it again. This is a perfect base. I changed the herbs and added some red pepper flakes for a little spiciness but this recipe is awesome.

This is a wonderful recipe. I decrease the vinegar a little as was suggested by some reviewers and it was great!! I added a little extra of each herb as well!! I will definitely use this again on beef and pork as well. I think it would be great on salmon!!

This was excellent - I used boneless chicken breast that I cut up into bite sized chunks (to cut down on cooking time) and I marinated it for only 1.5 hours.  I made a foil packet and poured everything onto it - left it open on top and placed on the grill.  I cooked for about 15-20 minuted.  My 16 year old, 11 year old and 4 year old asked me to make more next time!

Great light tasting summer meal.  Always looking for ways to utilize all the herbs in my garden.  Used less vinagar (I used sherry vinegar) and more olive oil).  Will do again.

I liked this recipe,What I suggest is if you don't like the sour taste very much (so dominant), the 2 hrs marinating is enough.

baked instead of grilling, 375 for 35 minutes, and it was delicious! Thanks for the recipe!

I don’t generally like marinades because the meat tastes like the marinade, not the meat.  My wife likes experimenting with marinades so she convinced me to try this.  The marinade looked vile to tell you the truth, but it was a nice combination of flavors. To my surprise, although the marinade made the chicken look burnt, it kept the meat moist and didn’t have an overpowering flavor.  Other than using bone-in chicken breasts, I followed the recipe with no changes.

I generally follow recipes to the letter when offering reviews, because I think that is the fair way to review.  However, on this one, I wish I would have read the reviews first and modified it before preparing.  I agree with other users who say the balsamic vinegar over-powered the other flavors.  When putting such a nice combination of herbs into my blender, I expected a nice, herby, and savory chicken.   Instead, it tasted like balsamic vinegar and nothing else. That is ALL I tasted.  My son was a fan but the rest of us were not impressed.  Next time, I will cut the vinegar in half or perhaps use white wine instead.  It was very simple to prepare though, and has potential.  Definitely do not follow the recipe as written!!!  ;)

We enjoyed this, but I found myself thinking I'd have preferred it to have just a hint of sweetness and a little heat.  The sweetness factor may have been my balsamic vinegar - perhaps it wasn't as sweet as others.  This could be easily remedied, however, by adding just a bit of brown sugar.  I used all fresh herbs, including the sage, because I had it.  Even though we enjoyed this, next time I may tweak it just a bit with the brown sugar and a little cayenne.  UPDATE:  Made again using a higher quality balsamic vinegar and am now giving this five stars, rather than my original four.  The vinegar you  use makes a lot of difference.  If you don't want a dominate balsamic flavor, marinate for a shorter period of time.  I marinated for five hours and it was just right for us.  I also reserved some of the marinade for basting while grilling, which give this a nice, moist sheen.

Thanks for the great recipe.  Had guests drop in unexpectedly so only marinated for a short time (made sure I poked lots of holes in the chicken so marinade could penetrate)  They raved about it and begged for the recipe.  We loved it too.

Superb marinade for chicken. After sitting overnight, my husband grilled the breasts to perfection. They really explode with flavor. The combination of herbs is just right and leaves a memorable impression. Loved it!

This was absolutely delicious! I threw everything in the food processor to chop & mix, then poured it over chicken in a plastic bag to marinate, couldn't be easier. Grilled up great, chicken was tender and juicy, even the leftover pieces we heated up the next day.

This was a great hit at my BBQ party.  I marinated it for 8 hours and used fresh basil in place of sage--that's what I had on hand.  The vinegar wasn't overwhelming, but produced a very tender, moist breast.  The herbs were such a nice blend and the parsley really enhanced the flavor.  Good thing because boneless breast is usually so darned dry and tasteless.  Loved it!

This chicken was great, but I did make a few changes.  Reduced the olive oil to just a couple Tbsp to save calories and thus reduced the balsamic vinegar to just a Tbsp.  This made just enough liquid, along with the garlic and herbs, to rub into the 2 chicken breasts I was preparing.  I have tons of fresh thyme in the garden so I patted several sprigs onto each side of the chicken and squeezed the juice of half a lemon over the top of chicken before putting it in the fridge for the day.  Marinated for about 8 hours and it was awesome!  Fresh herbs really make the difference if you have them.

I call this 'Scarborough Faire Chicken' - you know, parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme!  The only change I make is reducing the  balsamic vinegar and increasing the olive oil; otherwise, the vinegar seems to overpower the other flavors.  This recipe results in extremely flavorful, moist chicken.  Have even made this marinade and given jars of it away as gifts.  Thanks so much for a really great grilling recipe.

This recipe was fabulous!!!!  Instead of chicken I did it with Pork and I have never tasted such moist and tender pork off of the grill before. My entier family loved it and I have some picky eaters :o) I did switch the amounts of the balsamic vinegar and olive oil though.  I used 1/2 cup of olive oil and 1/4 cup of the balsamic vinegar instead so there was not as strong of a vinegar taste. I highly recommend this recipe!

PERFECT...  I used the marinade to bake 12 chicken wings.  I baked the wings at 375 degrees for 50 minutes.
DELICIOUS.. Meat was falling off the bones.

Great basic chicken recipe. Ate it with some kabocha and orzo. My only complaint was that my chicken stuck to the grill, so I guess the oil you marinate it in isn't enough to keep it from sticking. I'll add it on the grill next time.

We were not impressed with this recipe; however, I did not completely ding it because I followed reviews and added the balsamic later in the marinating. I also did not have all of the parsley. I can say it drastically needs salt and pepper.

I halved the oil and only had time for this to marinade for 30 minutes. It was very good as-is, but I also boiled down the marinade while the chicken was grilling and used it as a thick dipping sauce. I'll make this again for sure.

I'm not a big fan of vinegar in general, so I was a little leary of this recipe, especially with a half cup in the marinade.  But the wife and kids love balsamic, so I thought I would give it a try.  It turned out fantastic!  We pounded out the chicken breasts and doubled the garlic.  We didn't have any sage so we just went without and marinated it for about 4 hours.  Very juicy, flavorful and didn't have an overpowering vinegar taste to it.

This is a wonderful grilled chicken recipe. I thought the amount of Balsamic would be a little tart, but actually pretty tasty. I used all fresh herbs, but had no parsley, so used cilantro instead and we loved it. I should have added a touch more kosher salt to the marinade. Next time I will add a little salt and probably add a little more olive oil. This is a very nice grilled chicken! I will save this one and make again!

Pretty good! Although not the best grilled chicken I've ever had, this was decent nonetheless. And WOW, was this ever moist! I do have one gripe tho.... The fresh herb flavor was VERY mild (I thought it would be stronger - my marinate smelled WONDERFUL). I only marinated my chicken breasts for two hours. Next time I'll marinate overnight for optimal results. I also think I'll decrease the balsamic a little bit so that the marinade becomes more paste-like. This will ensure that the herbs adhere better to the meat. If you like the taste of balsamic, just use a stronger one to compensate (there are a multitude of varieties to choose from). Served with a tuscan bean salad and fresh rosemary bread, this was a quick and healthy meal. Thanks for sharing, Robyn! :-)

Very good for a healthy grilled dish.  We used bone in leg quarters and we slow cooked them.   The marinade smelled better than the dish actually tasted though.

Yum! This was delicious, only I did make a few changes. The first and most significant was I used white wine instead of balsamic vinegar. The flavor from the wine went really well with the mixture of herbs. I used all fresh herbs and added a bit more then it called for. I poked holes in the tops on the chicken thighs and let them marinade for 24 hours. Then I baked them on about 190 degrees Celsius for about 15 minutes and then grilled them in the oven until they went brown and crisp on top. The result was succulent, flavorful, and crispy chicken. I served this with pasta with a garlic white wine sauce and a nice fresh salad on the side. Thank you for the recipe, I was defiantly make this again!

Great, simple recipe!  The only thing I would add is that if you are able to chop your herbs fine enough (like I did) I don’t think there is reason to blend the herb mixture in a blender – which can be a pain to clean.  This is a keeper!

Great! I cut the amount of balsamic vinagar to 2 T, we are not big fans of it. i cut the sage to 1/2 t. I used dry herbs but i put them in the ziploc bag first with 2 T of warm water and let them sit while i prepared the chicken to go into the bag with the vinagar. i didnt put the herbs in a blender either. with them chunky they fall off on the grill easier so you get flavor with out the stuff. pan frying or broiling is not as good. i pounded the chicken so it was very thin before i put in the bag and let it rest for 20-30 min. its enough. my chicken tired family loved it!!

This is a great way to barbeque chicken thighs.  It was so good, we probably won't even try it with breasts.  However, DH and I both agreed that this recipe requires BBQ'ing.  Wouldn't work in the oven.

The 1st time we used dried herbs and marinated the chicken for only 8 hours.  It was just ok, I rated it 3 stars.   This time I used fresh herbs, 1/4c  balsamic called, and 1 tsp hot pepper flakes. Much better!

Moist and tasty chicken. This was a great recipe. I added more olive oil and used all dried herbs except for the parsley. Marinated about one hour. I also pounded the chicken breasts. This was a really nice dish. Will make it again. The balsamic vinegar was not noticeable and I made the recipe exactly as recommended.

This one I just loved. I had to choose a recipe that was ok for diabetics too, so I did a search for diabetes and this was one of the results... 

May I just say "oh mannnnnnnn" this was good. I love it, and I think this will be a keeper :)

Wonderful marinade! I did cut back on the balsamic vinegar a bit, though. I made a vegan version of this, using seitan. It came out delicious on the grill, juicy and just crispy enough.

It would be helpful here to list the amounts of herbs BEFORE CHOPPING, so that they could all be chopped together in the blender with the oil and vinegar. . . easier and faster.  Otherwise, good recipe.

Delicious!  It had a sweet flavor to it.  I have to admit I added a little worcestire sauce, and didn't have parsley so I used lemon basil instead.  I also used fresh sage.

I've made this recipe a couple of time, and just hadn't reviewed it yet. I didn't have all the herbs recommended fresh, so I used half the amount of dry herbs instead. For using so many herbs, the flavor was still surprisingly mild. A good keeper.

This came out really good.  I was kind of hesistant to add 1/2 cup of balsamic vinegar because I thought the vinegar would overpower the herbs, but to my surprise it didn't and it was delicious.  I used the marinade for chicken kabobs and I was only able to marinade the chicken for a little less than 2 hours and it still tasted great!  Next time I will marinade it longer to get the full effect.

Definitely something I would make again.  I used a little more oil (and decreased vinegar) for the marinade.  Worked well.

Used (mostly) fresh herbs, marinated for 5+ hours, used 6 yr balsamic (less oil/vinegar than called for), and grilled over charcoal. Tender, flavorful, and delicious. Note: used small hunks of meat rather than whole breasts.

Four stars for appearance, but 4.5 stars for taste.  We felt this had a good flavor.  This did not look like another "naked" chicken breast, but the dark brown chicken was a little strange looking.  I marinated for 24 hours and used a very nice balsamic vinegar.  I also used all fresh herbs, and if I do this again, I will probably cut the vinegar by half and double the herbs.

I like balsamic vinegar but I only use about 1/3 cup.  Marinating 2 hours was plenty.  I used fresh rosemary and thyme which I do think makes a nice difference from using dried.  Very flavourful!  :)

Made this recipe as is and marinated the chicken for about 5 hrs.  It tasted good, but my husband and I felt that it was lacking something.  Perhaps marinading overnight/for 24 hrs makes a difference.

Followed recipe exactly but didn't have onion or parsley and used chicken tenders. The flavor was great and I think it helped that I used tenders because each bite of chicken had more seasoning than if I had used a thick chicken breast. This is great served along with a side dish or two. Tomorrow I'm going to serve the lefovers on a salad. Definite repeat. Almost forgot, the tenders only required 20 minutes to cook.

My family raved about this grilled chicken. I used fresh herbs from our herb garden, rosemary, thyme, dill, parsley and also added the suggested dried sage and garlic. The chicken only marinated for 45 min. After grilling, I cut it in thin slices, laid it on top of rice pilaf and topped with mandarin oranges. It was beautiful and delicious!

Flavorful chicken. It was easy to mix the ingredients. The aroma was different and had my family wondering what I was cooking. Once presented, they continued to wonder since the finished cooked chicken looks different than what they usually have. Once they began eating everyone was extremely pleased with it. One that I would repeat for even a larger group.

I made this with Marinated Barbequed Vegetables also from this site and it was an amazing meal.  The only thing I did differently was to omit the parsley, use fresh sage, and add a bit more garlic.  I marinated for 6.5 hours.  The chicken was so tender and the flavor was incredible.  It heated up quite well for leftovers, too.  The next time I have company for dinner I am making this!

A fantastic easy marinade!  I made the marinade the night before, following the recipe exactly.  In the morning, I put the chicken in and marinated for about 10 hours. My husband returned from out of town the next evening and ate a leftover piece cold and still loved it.  I'm making next week for dinner with the inlaws, and I'll marinate for a full 24 hours to enhance the taste a bit.

This recipe is full of favor and very easy to fix. The chicken is very juicy and tender. My daughter is a very picky eater and she loves this chicken recipe. My husband is also picky about trying new recipes, but this is one that he has actual asked me to fix again. Everyone should try you can't go wrong. Thanks for sharing it. Lorie

Outstanding recipe...I flattened chicken breasts and made them quite small.  I then maranaded them and cooked them on the "Foreman" grill.  I placed them in a baking dish and served them for a family picnic for all to make sandwiches.  It was a great hit.  Thank you for this great recipe!

My husband is not a real fan of chicken but he LOVED this recipe.  Like the others, I reduced the vinegar to 1/2 cup, and used only 1/2 cup of olive oil.  I didn't  have sage, and it still tasted great.  I parbroiled my chicken first, then transfered it to a bowl and covered it with the marinade.  It soaked for about half an hour, and then I grilled my chicken on low for about half an hour.  The chicken was TENDER, and the flavor was WONDERFUL!  Thank you, I will be making this again, and I am planning on trying it on pork.

I was really worried about this recipe after I had blended it up. It looked pretty revolting. Once it was on the grill for a few minutes it was beautiful. I made 4 breasts at a total 3lbs. I increased the vinegar to 2/3 cup and oil to 1/2 cup. I used a pre-packaged organic fresh spice blend of sage, rosemary, and thyme along with the 2 tablespoons of parsley. It sat in the fridge for about 10 hours. It was pretty freakin' amazing. Everyone loved it.

This was good, but I made a few changes to the original recipe.  I used dried instead of fresh herbs in half the recommended amounts.  I realized I did not have any sage on hand, so I used poultry seasoning (which has some sage in it) instead.  I also swapped the amounts of olive oil and vinegar.  My chicken marinated for about 5 hours.  While it was grilling, I basted it a few times with the marinade.  It was good with salad.

I left out the sage and only let it marinate for an hour and a half, but it turned out great!  It has so much flavor.  I paired it with corn and a bed of rice for a nice compliment.

This is good, I only gave it 3 stars because the flavor was a bit mild; next time I will inject the marinade into the breasts. This dish is easy to freeze, and you can marinate and freeze some to cook later.

i tried this in a pan using  all fresh herbs an 1/3 c vinegar. even with the reduction in the amount, the balsamic vinegar overpowered everything else and dried out the chicken . it is edible by me but wouldn't dare serve it to anyone

Very easy marinade and tasty. It has a distinct balsamic taste; if you like the flavor, you'll love this recipe. The fresh herbs were a nice touch- great flavor. I don't have a grill, so I used a George Foreman, which didn't work so well-- the marinade burned (like it has a tendency to do on that "grill"). Next time I am going to bake it in the oven, including the marinade in the baking dish.

This was ok,but will probably not make it again. Have recipes we like better than this one. It seemed the thyme really overpowered everything else, not the balsamic vinegar.

Excellant. As stated by other reviewers, I used 1/3 cup olive oil and 1/4 cup Balsmic Vineger.  Did not have any sage.  Used fresh Rosemary and Thyme and dryed Parsley.  It was very tasty. Served with roasted garlic mashed potatoes and avocodes.

5-12-13:  Pretty good, but not a star.  Easy, though.

Great marinade!  I only had dried herbs and it still worked great.  I did cut back on the balsamic just a bit.  Came out real good.

perfect. All fresh herbs, added fresh spring onions, switch amounts of oil and vinegar, added 4 tblspns butter.  Squeeze lemon on the chicken right before serving. Amazing...

Yum!  Love this simple grilled chicken!  I didn't have balsamic so I used red wine vinegar!   Can't wait to try with the balsamic though!  I used fresh sage instead of the dried!  Loved all the fresh herbs in this!  I only got to marinade it the minimum 2 hrs but looking forward to doing it over night!  Thanks so much!

I did not agree with the other reviewers that it had too much vinegar.  I would let it marinate at least 3 hours next time.  A bleu cheese sauce or balsamic reduction would go nicely on top.

Very easy recipe, I followed directions exactly except for the amount of vinegar - that I cut to about 1/3 of a cup.  Chicken was very flavorful and moist.  This is a very versatile recipe depending on what herbs you decide to use.

Ok, I didn't care for the flavor of this chicken, but my husband enjoyed it so much he asked me to make it again.  I followed the recipe exactly, except I used 1/3 Vinegar as suggested.  I thought the rosemary was overpowering and my husband thought it was perfect.  I guess it's a matter of taste.

I'm giving it 5 stars because i tweaked the recipe a LOT due to lack of ingredients. With the correct ones i'm sure it would have been fantastic too. Didnt have any balsamic vinegar so just added 2 tablespoons of regular malt vinegar with teaspoon of sugar! Had all driend herbs and no sage. Left to marinade for about 4 hours and the chicken was so soft, even b4 cooking! I think the trick 2 juicy chicken is vinegar in the marinade. Not dry at all, even had to pour away some of the juices from the chicken before plating up! Excellent

This was easy and fast - I marinated it for about 3 hours.  Flavor was great, tho chicken wasn't quite as moist as I'd hoped.  Would make it again but half the herbs and allow it to marinate overnight.

Made very moist chicken. The only thing I didnt like was that the vinegar taste was a little strong and I am a fan of balsamic. Will reduce next time.

I was SO excited to try this after making the marinate - it smelled great! But, I thought it just tasted OK. And my husband (who'd rather eat things plain) wasn't crazy about it. Maybe my expectations were too high after smelling the marinate all afternoon! The chicken was nice and tender though. Not sure if I'll try this again... especially because I'm not sure what I'd change to improve it!

I sliced the chicken, marinated it, then b-b-q it, about 3 minutes each side.

Delicious, quick, easy, great.

I really loved this recipe.  It is so, so good!  The taste is exceptional, and I used mostly dried herbs (threw in some fresh basil because I had it).  I let this marinade for over 24 hours.  Some of the best-tasting and most tender grilled chicken I have ever had!

I thought this was excellent.   I used bottled balsamic vinegrette, instead of the vingar and oil, and I used dried thyme because it's all I had.. I bet fresh would be even better... it's going into the summer meal rotation in our house.

UNBELIEVABLE!!  Tender and tasty....and nice and light!  I had to scale the recipe for 2 servings, but it turned out to be outstanding.  I paired this with a baby greens salad topped with the Raspberry Vinegarette dressing from this site for a delicious meal.  Thanks Robyn, I will be using this again!!

This recipe is wonderful! extremely easy and tastes grate. i added some fresh oregano and basil. i also added a teaspoon of lemon juice and allot more olive oil to the recipe because it makes it more moist, i added some brown sugar as well. i estimated how much of each ingredient to put in, so sorry if this is unclear.

I LOVE IT! ITS QUICK AND EASY. LOTS OF FLAVOR AND THE MARINADE MAKES THE CHICKEN VERY TENDER.  LEAVE THE CHICKEN MARINADE FOR AT LEAST 2 TO 3 HOURS FOR THE FLAVOR TO SET.  IT HAS BECOME A FAVORITE IN MY FAMILY AND TO ALL OUR GUEST WHO HAVE TASTED IT.

Used all dry herbs, marinated for just over two hours and grilled on the barbeque. The combination of herbs was really nice and the balsamic vinegar gave the chicken a great sweet, tangy flavor.   Delicious!

What a wonderful recipe! Since I was unable to find all of the fresh herbs in the grocery store, I opted to use all dried herbs instead. I found there was no need to reduce the amount of herbs since I had marinated about three pounds of chicken. I suggest marinating for 24 hours in a Ziploc bag. The chicken was moist and very flavorful! My entire family loved it!

I made this recipe for dinner last night.  I like recipes with fresh ingredients, few calories and that taste great.  This met all of this and more.  The only thing I changed was to use red wine vinegar instead of the balsamic.  I mixed all the ingredients in my mini food processor, poured it over the chicken breasts and let them set in my refrigerator about 5 hours.  I broiled them in my oven for about 7 minutes on a side. (A huge rain storm changed our plan.)  I served these juicy, flavorful breasts with fresh vegetables and red potatoes then added raspberry pie and ice cream for dessert.    I will definitely make this recipe again.

The picky eaters in our house like this chicken.  Most reviews say the balsamic vinegar is too strong.  I followed the recipe and used 4 chicken breasts the first time I made it and used 6 the next time I made it.  We marinated both times for an hour and a half.  The longer you marinade the chicken, the stronger the taste will be. We did not experience a strong vinegar taste (even though it smelled pretty strong in the blender!) I wouldnt follow the same recipe on less than 4 chicken breasts; I think the vinegar taste would be stronger that way.  All in all, if my 9-year-old will eat it, it's now in my "recipes to use again".  They really liked it.  It's a really healthy dinner and to me, that's a win.  We are really making an effort to stay away from processed foods and foods with chemicals.  This helps us do that.

We all liked this chicken.  After reading the reviews about it being a little too tart, I too changed the quantities of oil and vinegar and added a touch of brown sugar.  I did 1/3 c oil, 1/4 vinegar, and 1 T brown sugar.  Worked well.  Glad for the reviews.

This recipe is wonderful. I didn't add the vinegar until the next morning, for fear it would be too strong. I also left some without, because my daughter hates any vinegar and it was great too. So glad I found this recipe. YUMMY! Already getting request for for it.

My husband really liked this!  I did cut back on the Balsamic vinegar to 1/4 cup, also used dry herbs at 1 tsp for 1 Tbl, and heaping 1/4 tsp for 1 tsp.  Marinated almost 3 hours and they grilled perfect!!

I thought this was terrific. Not for someone who doesn't like balsamic vinegar. I plan to try it on pork next. And I think you could use dried herbs if fresh are not on hand.

I love balsamic vinegar, and herbs, but though I made this recipes per instructions, it was only okay for us.  Even the grill didn't add the expected flavor.  I did pound the breasts down, and will admit, it was very tender.

Followed recipe exactly.  It simply was not very good. Boring - not much different than marinading in a bottled salad dressing.

Very tasty!  I would suggest pounding down the chicken breasts to make them thinner, though.  I eyeballed the herbs (used some fresh, some dry), white wine vinegar instead of balsamic, and it turned out great on the grill!

Very tasty...lots of flavor and moist!  I used chicken tenders and was only able to marinate them for 2 hours and after grilling them, still found them with alot of flavor and not dried out like most grilled chicken becomes after grilling!  Will save recipe for future chicken grilling!!!

Since the weather was so nice yesterday my fiance got the grilling bug. He made this for dinner minus the balsamic.(We had used it all last week.) He let it marinate most of the day. It was so tender and delicious. I loved how all the herbs created this tasty little crust. Thank you for a simple yet delicious recipe.

This was a very tasty recipe! I made a sauce of butter, soy sauce, garlic and lemon and poured it over the chicken. Like some other reviewers, I baked the chicken for about 35 minutes at 375. Came out really tender with lots of flavor!

Very Good....I cut back on the balsamic vinegar just a little bit...turned out very good.  Instead on boneless chicken breasts I used chicken thighs, legs, & breasts with bones.  Grilled it med/high heat to brown and then indirect heat to finish.  Very similar to Grilled Tuscan Chicken, but the pieces work better for a large party.  Everyone enjoyed.

after reading reviews I tried this for baking 12 chicken wings. It was really good. 375 x 50 minutes was just right. Baked the wings right with the marinade and served over white rice.  reminds of chicken adobo. Can't wait to do it with chicken pieces on the grill, but I will leave the skin on. Know it will be good!

This is very good.  It's a great way to used up the fresh herbs in the garden.  And you can add as many herbs as you would like to personal taste.

This is an excellent recipe.  Only change made was to substitute beau monde for sage.  Marinated for 36 hours & flavor was fantastic.  Will definitely make again.  Thanks for a keeper.

Used this recipe tonight for dinner with white risotto and grilled asparagus; the chicken was the perfect compliment to the rest of the meal.  I like balsamic quite a bit, so I made a quick balsamic reduction as well for a little extra kick.  It's our new favorite way to have grilled chicken!

I'm a vegetarian, and don't know the first thing about cooking meat...but I don't have the heart to let my meat-eating boyfriend go hungry, so I tried this recipe to give him a break from my veggie-ways...I'm just glad it was a success because it would be kind of hard to taste-test it for myself :)

The ingredients really come together for a excellent chicken dish.  Make sure you don't cheat and use dried herbs, fresh is the way to go.  Super juicy and even my picky kids enjoyed it.

I made this last night and it was delicious!  I did 1/4 tsp ground thyme because I couldn't find any fresh in the stores.  I also doubled the garlic.  I used four fat chicken breasts, so had to bump the cooking time up to almost 40 minutes total.

I think it should be called Grilled Chicken with Herbed Balsamic Vinegar though.

Great flavor. Used white wine instead of balsamic vinegar because that is all I had. Should have let it marinade longer though.

This was just okay for me. The marinade smelled wonderful, but the taste lacked something. I even used the suggestions of adding the red pepper flakes and cutting down on the balsamic. My husband said it was "different".

Very tastey!  The balsamic vinegar made the marinade smell pretty potent, but it didn't overpower the taste of the chicken.  The combination of herbs was wonderful and everyone seemed to enjoy this Mother's Day meal!  A definite keeper . . .

I made this as written.  I am always looking for flavorful chicken recipes as my husband is a cardiac patient and is not a fan of chicken.  He did not like it all.  I thought the herb flavor was too strong as well.  I was hoping the balsamic would dilute the herb flavor some what, but it did not.  I'm removing this one from my favorites. I will continue searching.

We used this to marinate and then grill a couple chicken breasts which I shredded to top a roasted brussel sprout salad.  I had all fresh herbs on hand and thought they added nice flavor to the chicken.

Loved it.  However, I tweaked it based on what I wanted to feature which was fresh sage.  So used only fresh sage and fresh parsley which I grow.  I added a bit of honey.  It was excellent.  Next time, I might try a bit of heat too.  I'd use the other herbs too because I have them.  But I couldn't quite imagine using all of them at one time.

I have a herb garden with fresh sage too and marinated chicken over night. It turned out great except I thought the thyme was a little over powering.

Super simple recipe and excellent flavor! I read other reviews and decided to do 1/4 cup balsamic vinegar and 1/3 cup of olive oil, I also used majority dried herbs with the exception of parsley and basil (which I substituted for the sage). I baked at 350 for approximately 20min. I've started measuring temperature for chicken instead of going off time to make sure the chicken is not over cooked. I reserved the leftover marinade and added more about 3/4 way through and pulled the chicken out once it reached internal temp of 150degrees. Covered it wit foil and let it rest for 10minutes as it continues to cook. Turned out absolutely perfect! I also was short on time and only marinaded it for 2hrs. The trick is to watch internal temp. This was the first time I tried this recipe and I will def use it again! Thanks!

I made it but with some changes.  I used white vinegar (that's all I had on hand) but only a 1/4 cup.  I used dried spices 1/2 quantity because that's all I had on hand.  Also added chili flakes because we like a little bit of heat.  I was in a hurry I cut the chicken into 1/2 inch strips poked with a fork and marinated it for only 3 hrs then quick fry on the stove.  It was great, served it on pita bread with hummus and lettuce/tomato/onion cilantro salad.  Was a hit with hubby.

Love this recipe!!! The flavor is out of this world and it's very easy to make. It's midsummer so all the fresh herbs needed have come right from the garden. The second time I made a larger batch to eat over a few days. It's versatile--the first night I made Greek-inspired accompaniments: cucumber, yogurt, herb sauce then Italian style: roasted polenta and tomato.

I'm using a small indoor electric grill, so the chicken needs about 8 minutes/side. 

Delicious and I will make it again.

This recipe is a real winner!! Reduce balsamic vinegar if you're not accustomed to that flavor. We tossed asparagus in olive oil, sea salt and pepper and grilled. Same with some jalapeños, portabellol mushrooms received the same marinade as the chicken, because I made just two breasts. I garnished with a little blue cheeses, because I love it...yuuummmy!!

I actually use this marinade for Quorn vegetarian chicken, and it is absolutely delicious.  It's my 3-year-old's favorite! The tanginess of the balsamic is just perfect.

This was a hit with my family.  I used 1/2 raspberry balsamic because I was trying to use it up.  We liked the slightly fruity taste.  I would not use all raspberry balsamic though.  Served with the Spinach Tomato Tortellini by LELA NORTHON on this website.  Yum, Yum!

I needed something for some boneless chicken and this served perfectly! I used all dried herbs     ( nothing fresh in the pantry) and only had 1/8 cup balsamic so used white vinegar to top off 1/2 cup needed for vinegar. Whole chicken was great...grilled up beautifully! Will make again

This chicken tasted amazing! I had to tweak it a little bit because of lack of some ingredients, so instead of balsamic i used italian dressing. It still tasted absolutely delicious! I usually eat my chicken with ketchup but the herbs made it so flavorful that I didn't even need the ketchup.

This made some delicious chicken! I used dry herbs, and the flavor was still great! I did not have time to let the chicken soak in marinade, but the vinegar and herbs still had a great flavor. I broiled the chicken and sliced it to serve on a salad.

Delicious! We marinated overnight. The flavor and tenderness is great. Next time I may add a bit more balsamic.

I used this on some chicken breasts that I baked.  The oil helped keep the meat moist.  As someone else suggested, I used half the oile and extra mustard.

Doubled the recipe and it was enough for 5+ lbs of thighs (bone in) and 2 lbs of boneless,skinless breasts.  The only disappointment was the lack of leftovers!

Tried the recipe.  Easy to follow.  Only the chicken was a bit dry.  Any way to recommend to make the chicken pieces more juicy?

5 Star Marinade. Who knew this mix would be so good on chicken? It stayed so moist and added a yummy fresh flavor.
I did not have balsamic so I used vinegar with a couple Tbsp. Red wine I had open. Even the kids ate it! Will be making this again for sure!

I used expensive, very high quality balsamic vinegar.  This was okay, but not great - I thought it could have been more flavorful.

A tasty grilled chicken recipe. The balsamic gave it a great flavour, and I used one that had been aged, so it gave a sweeter flavour to the marinade. I made the recipe as directed, except used fresh sage, and marinated closer to the 2 hours. I agree with other reviewers that using different blends of herbs would be worth trying with this recipe. Thanks Robyn - a definite make-again.

This smelled good, but it was just a little too much for us.  It was nice and juicy though.  I think it would be better next time if I scraped off the herbs a little more.

I eat a lot of chicken, so I'm always looking for new and healthy ways to prepare it.  This was a solid recipe.  Didn't have any fresh herbs on hand, so used dried.  Vinegar gave it a nice taste.

Couldn't find fresh thyme or rosemary in the market so that could be why this didn't "wow" me. I'll try this again when I can locate fresh herbs.

My family has fallen in love with this
recipe. We use split breasts w/bones
and grill it on low. Just wonderful.
