Since we don't get golden beets here, I used the purple kind.  I used only whole wheat flour, and subbed honey for the sugar.  I baked it in a pie pan, and it only took 30 minutes!  My family finished this in no time!  When (if) golden beets ever become available here, I know I'll have to try this recipe with them!  Until then, I'll make this with the purple beets again!  Thanks for the recipe!

This is good.  I like the taste of beets, but their flavor is pretty much lost in this, so I think even non-beet fans would like it.  I used purple beets since that's what I had. I also used 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup honey since I did not have turbinado sugar.  I omitted the nuts.  I wish I had checked the bread at 50 minutes b/c it burned on the edges a bit at 55 minutes.

Took this to the office. Was SURE that No One would touch it. Beet bread!?!? Are you serious?!?!? I can not believe that #1 everyone tried it #2 no one hated it. Don't know what turbinado sugar is & I was running low on agave so used only a 1/2 cup of that. Used red beets. Omitted walnuts. This is a great recipe to use on all those leftover CSA beets. I mean like what can I do with beets that I get every week! THIS!

I happened to have 3 leftover golden beets and didn't know what to do with them since I do not care for the taste. This recipe was a great way to use them! The bread tastes like beets but is yummy! I added 1 tsp pumpkin pie spice and 1 tsp vanilla for some flavor. I also added the water from cooking the beets to the blender to make the mixture smooth, not have to add water later, and retain the nutrients lost from cooking. My 18-month-old daughter also approves.

I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of leaving out the walnuts due to allergy. There was a definite beet taste. We'll eat it but I don't think I'll bother with making it again. Maybe I should have added cinnamon or something?

delicious! So, I changed a couple things: used canned beets and mashed, threw in pepitas instead of walnuts and since I had no turbinado sugar I just used regular. I added a touch of cinnamon and vanilla, as well as chocolate chips. cane out delicious, thanks for adding this awesome bread!

The flavor of this was fine, but nothing spectacular.  I did add a little almond extract, some cinnamon and nutmeg, and if I make this again, will increase those.
This recipe will be good to have on hand if there is a bumper crop of beets, but nothing to go out of your way for.
