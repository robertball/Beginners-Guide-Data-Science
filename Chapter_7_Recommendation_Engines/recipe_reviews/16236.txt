It was a little difficult to make, but the orange zest really added a punch to the flavor.  The bread got hard after just a day or two, so eat it quickly!!

OK, so as far as breads go, this one isn't easy. But in terms of special, holiday breads, this Babka really isn't that tough to do at all. And to top it off, the results of your efforts will be worth the bit of extra work. The bread is flaky and buttery--not what you want to eat when you are trying to loose a few pounds. But then, what the heck? This bread is for special occasions. It's completely yummy. Thanks Alicia!

This was an interesting bread to make!  I made it Easter Sunday for my family's dinner and everyone loved it! Had some issues with the dough rising (I am not a great "yeast bread" maker-quick breads are more my speed), but I let it cook about 15 longer than suggested (because it was still a little "doughy") and it still came out great!  I omitted the raisins and it was still wonderful!  I left the extra loaf at my Dad's for the family to enjoy well after Easter!  Can't wait to try it again next year!

This recipe is delicious, but there is so much dough that I think I will use three loaf pans from now on instead of just two.

I have used this recipe for several years and found that 3 9"x5"breads can be made.

I love making yeast bread but I am lazy, so I used my bread machine on the dough setting which makes it so much easier. I scaled to 9 servings because 3 cups of flour is perfect for my machine.
I used all milk, 1 tbsp yeast, 1 tbsp vital gluten flour, 2 whole eggs, 2 egg yolks and 1/2 tsp salt. This bread recipe is missing salt which is very important when making bread. When my bread machine beeped at the add in time I added the melted butter, then the raisins after it was well kneaded, I needed to add at least a 1/4 cup of extra flour as it was quite sticky. I was able to make 4 mini loaves (12 oz of dough each) which baked in 25 minutes. I brushed the loaves with butter as soon as I removed them from the oven as it ensures a soft crust. Usually when I make Easter bread we also put a glaze on, I used a scant tsp of orange zest, 4 tsps orange juice and a heaping 1/2 cup of icing sugar, which I brushed on once the breads were cooled.
It smells awesome! My neighbours will be so happy with their little gifts.
I made this for the Allrecipes Allstars Canada April Challenge #ARFaceless

I have made this as an Easter gift for my sisters every year since I found this recipe back 7 years ago-- they all love it-the only thing I change is that I don't  glaze the top and I put in a little extra orange zest
