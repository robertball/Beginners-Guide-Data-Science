Has pretty good flavor. I used ground beef instead of beef sirloin because it was all I had, but it still worked well.

I used left over Tri-tip, added sliced fresh mushrooms and about 2 tablespoons Worchestershire sauce, and I used a can of Golden Mushroom soup instead of the Cream of Mushroom Soup.  Very tasty!   Came together in no time and it's a great left-over make-over recipe!!!  No one in the family will eat left-overs so I have to be cleaver and disguise left-overs and turn them into something new.  This fooled everyone at the table, no one suspected that I used left-over Tri-tip in this dish.  I'm so sneaky :+)

Very yummy and oh so quick and easy!  First batch was a little thick; I think next time I will add water or beef broth until it's a preferred consistency.  Will definitely make this again and again.

Quick and easy recipe!  I used 2 cans of the cream of mushroom, used 1 cup of fat-free sour cream added black pepper and garlic herb spice and it was superb!  Will definitely make again!

My husband loved this dish!  I only gave it four because I modified it slightly:  I doubled the reciped, I substituted ground beef for the round steak (but I only used just a little over a pound), I didn't add the flour, I added 1/4 c. of milk (it would have been too thick), and I used cavatappi instead of egg noodles.  Much easier to handle and the sauce clung very well to them.  All in all, a good recipe, I will try it again, but I'll add some fresh sauteed mushroom, some peas, and possibly substitute roasted chicken for the beef!

I would give 3 1/2 to 4 stars for the flavor, but combined with the ease to make, that definitely bumps it up to a 5 star recipe. I make with frozen meatballs for a super fast meatball stroganoff that's ready to eat in under 20 mins!

This also works with ground beef or ground turkey. I also add a dash of worchestershire and a little dried basil and if it's too thick, a little beef broth. If I have it, I like to add a cup or so of sliced fresh mushrooms when I saute the onion. It's a lot like the SOS that I grew up with as a kid. It's great over mashed potatoes or fresh fluffy biscuits.

Tasty and east version of the classic. I skipped the sour cream as I had none but it would have been better if I had added it. Still, a yummy dish.

The round steak took forever to get tender, though. I simmered it in beef stock and it cooked for nearly an hour!

This was very easy to make and tasted great. The only change I made was I used ground turkey instead of beef strips. Will make again.

This recipe?  Bland and blander...  I tried the 1/2 cream of mushroom, 1/2 golden mushroom combination.  I added a bit of Worcestershire sauce (as some reviewers suggested).  I'm really unsure how this recipe has so many positive reviews.  Maybe it's me.

Pretty good!  I followed the recipe pretty close, but added some seasoning to the meat when browning and also added some fresh mushrooms that I had sauteed in garlic for the extra veggies.  That gave it that extra something it would have needed.  Everything else was exact and I served over whole wheat rotini.  Its going in my recipe box for sure!

Because I don't eat meat, I replaced the beef with fresh portabella mushrooms, and added some broccoli. Delish!

I did this using stewing beef for the meat and served it with quinoa (I didn't have any regular pasta on hand.).  I liked how simple it was.  The flavor and consistency were good.  For me this recipe gets bonus points for having few ingredients, all of which were readily available in my kitchen when I needed a quick dinner in a pinch.  I'll probably use this again, though perhaps not too frequently because it is somewhat rich.  :)

Couple of suggestions: 2 cans of cream of mushroom, added 1 beef bouillon cube with 1/4 milk which made it more ceamy and more flavor. Will make again!

It doesn't taste terrible but I would not make this again. It just tastes like mushroom soup on noodles.  I'm removing this one from my recipe box.

This is a quick way to make beef stroganoff on a busy night but the taste is the tradeoff.  This is passable, and I may return to it when I have a craving but don't have much time, but it lacks the depth of flavor.

Quick, easy, and tasty! I marinated the steak in a tad of salt, vegetable oil, and Worcestershire sauce for an hour before cooking in the fridge. The meat was really tender.

I was preparing one of the ground beef helpers with double meat, which I seasoned well with dried minced onion and steak seasoning, and needed more sauce and I chose this recipe to supplement and was presently surorised.  It's was really too thick so I added a little milk and Worcestershire sauce resulting in a very good flavorful sauce. I will keep this in my recipe repertoire

For how fast and easy it was, this is a five-star recipe. I sauteed a small chopped onion and a handful of fresh mushrooms and used ground beef. I also tossed my cooked egg noodles with butter and parsley. I served it with steamed broccoli and yeast rolls, and we really enjoyed it. Thanks, Campbell's! :)

This was very quick to make. It's probably not more difficult than classic stroganoff, just less time consuming and you can make it when you don't have fresh ingredients. Reading the other reviews I see many of us made similar alterations with better results. 1. two cans of soup ( I used 1 can cream of chicken and 1 can cream of mushroom) 2. more seasonings (seriously) I used garlic powder, parmesan cheese and fresh ground pepper. I also used yogurt and the whole bag of noodles. Yummy. I would make this again with the addition of fresh mushrooms.

I am giving this a 4 star due to great basic and easy recipe. However for mine I did use the sirloin and the sour cream. I doubled the soup and added 1 tbs. worcestershire. And I added one soup can of water (too thick). Also when you read the directions (if I read them right) there is no need to separate anything. Using the steak I used it created wonderful juices and I cooked the onion with the steak and seasoned well. I kept it together to keep the flavor. Easier and better! I also added peas to the plates with my non picky eaters :) Tasted great and everyone loved!

I did not care for this! Might as well make a bowl of Cream of Mushroom and add steak. The mushroom flavor is overwhelming and not one of my kids liked it.  Waste of good steak!

This came out very well.  What I really needed was a good guide line of ingredients, and an order to make the dish.  After that I add or take as needed.  But on this one I followed it, and I was really surprised as to how good it came out.
Best of all, it was quick.  My family loved it.
Thanks again.

This was very fast and super easy to make! It only took me less than 30 mins to make it... as long as it takes to boil the noodles. I used ground beef that I precooked and froze from the freezer, so it made it that much easier! I also added a can of sliced mushrooms, yummy!

Followed recipe but made these changes:  Increased cream of mushroom soup to 2 cans, 1tsp paprike, added 8 oz canned mushrooms, 2tbls Worcestershire sauce, 1tsp garlic powder, 1/2 tsp salt, pepper to taste, and almost 1c sour  cream.  Next time I'd love to try with fresh mushrooms but canned is all I had on hand.

i didnt measure out the egg noodles, just used a whole 12 oz package. and instead of topping the sauce over the noodles, i mixed it into the noodles which was not a good idea as there was not enough sauce to coat the noodles! next time i will double the sauce mixture. also used ground beef since its more economical and thinned out the sauce with a little beef broth.

This was very good and fast to the table too. I used another half can of soup though as it was really thick and added a splash of milk. I stirred the pasta right in. My family loved this dish. I used ground beef instead. Thanks!

I sauted fresh mushrooms with the onions low and slow until they caramelized. Then I added my ground beef and cooked through. I also added a tablespoon of worchesterchire sauce for kick. It was delicious!

I grew up with this dinner, so when my boyfriend visited I thought it would be nice to make it. I followed the recipe exactly and it was just o.k.  It tasted alright, but was on the bland side. Not how I always remembered it.

I've been using this recipe for years. It's a great stand by, quick weeknight meal, and good comfort food. The only thing I change is the cream of mushroom soup, I'm allergic to mushrooms so I substitute cream of chicken or celery or whatever I happen to have on hand. Dried minced onion can be substituted for the onion (this also cuts down the prep time if you're in a hurry)

It was a quick and easy recipe but I had to alter it so much to make the sauce the right consistency and added extra spices because it was so bland. Sorry won't be making this one again.

I've made this twice now. The first time, i made it as written, and it was great. Second time, i added a clove of garlic and 1/2 a green pepper, chopped, when the onions were almost done. (I like green pepper slightly crunchy, not mushy, so i only sauteed them for a few minutes.) Again, it was very good. Easy ingredients, and quick to make. Perfect for a busy mum like me!

This was not a reminiscence of the beef stroganoff I've ever eaten before! It was too runny, didn't have any flavor of the sour cream, and just generally wasn't good! Even my hubby, who can eat anything, didn't care much for it. I think I will keep on looking for a good recipe

Yes, I used 3 cans of Cream of Mushroom Soup, 1/2 cup  2% milk, 2 pounds of thin sliced round steak, probably a  1/4to 1/8th  inch thick cut into 2  bite size pieces and I added 
1 small can of Mushrooms, chopped.  Absolutely delicious and fed 6 people with a small amount left over.

I understand this is 'base' recipe. Having used allllll the ingredients, I am one of those who like to add things, I.e. Sweet peas and carrots. I used beef cubes cut into smaller sizes and marinated them a few hours prior to shaking them in flour and adding to olive oil. In the end, I drained the noodles and mixed everything together. My taste-tester hubby said it has great flavor! Happy Father's Day! Next, I'm making an apple pie-bfilling crisp/dump cake found on my go-to recipe app which is right here! (as I was working on this recipe, I marinaded the apples in cinnamon, nutmeg and allspice.

It tasted great b 4 adding the mushroom soup.  I marinated the beef in a strong beef base/beef stock.  After browning the steak and sauteing the onion, I put aside, then added the beef base mixture and some cornstarch to the pan to thicken.  Then add back the meat/onions and sour cream.  I forgot the soup but it tasted great and wondered if I should just leave the soup out.  Well, I added it and made it taste bland.  I'll add more worchester.

We prefer stew meat and beef broth instead of water for a more intense flavor. I also slice my onions thick so they do not cook down and become invisible. I have tried this both ways and this is our preference as a family. I have made a double recipe for family dinners with a big salad, glazed carrots, hot rolls and our favorite dessert. My family loves me even more when I cook this delicious meal!

I actually use the crock pot and slowly cook the beef (usually a pot roast) and add the soup in the last hour or so. I also Add Worcestershire sauce and beef broth! Very Yummy

I've made this quite a few times, and it's really a good base.  As is, it is pretty tasty and definitely worth making.  To make it extra good, I add some more mushrooms when cooking the onions, and then add in about 1 tbsp of mustard and a bit of worcestershire sauce.  And now I love it!

We had this tonight and it reminded me of dishes I used to make in the 70's.  My husband, a meat and potatoes guy, loved it but me, not so much.  It was just O.K.  It was very thick so I added water after I'd added the soup.  I won't make this one again.

Very easy. Thank you for all the tips! I used ground venison. I do not use any oil. I added fresh garlic and a can of mushrooms. Very good!

This one was really good. I added a little more sour cream to make it creamer and some lemon juice and a bit of franks red hot sauce to give it a bit of a bite.

I have been making Stroganoff this way for years.  Super Easy and Delicious!  I use veggie crumbles to make it vegetarian for me and use ground beef for the hubby.  Sometimes I use fresh mushrooms, sometimes canned, whatever I have time for.  I always throw some garlic (a clove or two) in with onion and meat. Other than that I make it exactly as written.

I made this for dinner yesterday, it is really good! I added a small container of fresh sliced mushrooms to the ingredients, that is the only thing I did differently than what is called for. The husband loved it and it has officially been added to the rotation list

This is so basic and easy, even my picky kid liked it. *snicker* He thought the portabello mushrooms I added were beef! I used VERY sweet onions and practically burned them giving it a rich sweet flavor. I agree that the sauce is too thick, however after I added a little Worcestershire sauce, I think it was fine. I think the proportions I used were: a big can (it said '45% more') of Campbells Cream of Mushroom soup and about a cup (maybe more?) of full fat sour cream.

Very Good, but sauce is too thick. Recipe is enough or two. Another review suggested beef broth, use at least 1/2c. Also try using onion soup mix instead, otherwise an excellent stroganoff!!!:)

Loved the flavor! I do recommend marinating the beef the night before cooking because it was a little tough. But overall a great dish.

I cook vegetarian so used Worthington Tender Rounds instead of meat. I followed the rest of the recipe as follows and it turned out great. Have made again.

I have been using this recipe for years.  It is one of my husband's favorites.  Its economical & fast. I use the fat free soup & nobody can tell the difference.
