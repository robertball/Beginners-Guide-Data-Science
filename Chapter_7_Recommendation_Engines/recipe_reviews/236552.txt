I didn't change anything but we just rolled them into little balls and ate them as raw cookie dough.

Incredible for that sweet tooth! Loved it just as written, except for m&ms instead (which made it fun as a dip). This would also be great for making homemade cookie dough ice cream! Authentic cookie dough flavor. Yum!!!

this is so good. i used it as a filling in a chocolate cake, so decedent. I used regular chocolate chips, I didn't think it would make a big difference. I was wrong. The mini chocolate chips are a must, It gives the frosting a better texture.

It didn't have that much flavor and it didn't flow well. But it was still delicious and okay.

Needed WAY more cream than told to make it frosting consistency. Wanted something different to try, and was horribly disappointed.

This was so good! I can't believe I never thought of something like this. I followed the recipe exactly (using half cup of cream to my taste). I used this on chocolate chip pound cake. Everyone who tried it loved it. I wish I could give it more stars.

Made this and used it as the middle layer for my daughter's birthday cake.   Followed the recipe with exception of adding the milk to my desired consistency for spreading.  Will be hanging on to this one.

This is super good!  The key to making this light and fluffy is to keep mixing until the sugar has dissolved and it is not grainy.   As other reviewers stated, you will need more milk/cream.

I wasn’t sure how much this made so I doubled the recipe to frost a 9x13-inch pan of brownies and I had plenty (even some left over to pop in the fridge to snack on later).  Took the brownies to work and they loved them!  I did have to add more cream to get the right consistency and I followed another reviewer’s suggestion to bake the flour.

Frosted a yellow cake with this for my sons birthday. It is fabulous! Everyone raved about it and my son loved it. Totally agree with previous reviewers who said to add a lot more cream plus milk. It needs a LOT more to make it fluffy and spreadable but flavor was still fantastic.

Needed more milk than stated in recipe, but I used it as a filling for a chocolate birthday cake, and the birthday girl loved it! Actually, so much so, that she was sad other people wanted a slice! This is my go to now!

I didn’t like it. Since I was making it for an event, I needed it to be perfect. So I ended up throwing this out and making my own normal cookie dough recipe. I just omitted the eggs and added some milk, one tablespoon at a time, until it was the right consistency.

Made this for my cookie-dough loving daughter.  It was delicious as a filling for a layer cake with chocolate ganache.  The only change I would make in the future would be to cut the flour back to  1 cup.  As written we felt that the flour was too pronounced.  Otherwise, it was wonderful!  We will make this again.

Everyone loved it!  I used half salted and half unsalted butter , also used a bit less salt and a lot more cream to get it to a frosting consistency..  if you're a cookie dough fan you will love this recipe.  We used it to frost cupcakes -when refrigerated the frosting seemed to lack flavour but at room temperature it was amazing !

Excellent recipe that I've made several times. Does anyone know how long this frosting will last in the fridge? I need to make it today to be served on Saturday.  Thanks for a great recipe and a family fave!

I made this recipe exactly as it is written and added milk until it had a spreadable consistency .  It tastes just like chocolate chip cookie dough and I used it as a filling for a yellow, 3 layer cake.  Super delicious for the cookie dough fanatic!!

This is delicious! I didn't measure out the heavy whipping cream, just slowly added it to get the frosting consistency. I've only eaten it by spoon so far, but I look forward to spreading it on a graham cracker soon. This was a really tasty way to use up leftover cream!

Too salty to eat. Wondering if recipe should call for unsalted butter or adding half the amount of salt?  Waste of time and ingredients.

LOVED THIS, I am not a fan of icing and this was perfect!! The only change I made was I used 4 tablespoons milk and 4 tablespoons heavy cream. Using a pastry bag or freezer bag with a hole cut out to insert the cookie dough in the center of the cupcake as well as on top is PERFECT. I made 24 cupcakes and everyone who ate one is coming back for more.

To make this a spreadable frosting, I added milk, and the flavor was still true to chocolate chip cookie dough. I'm storing the cupcakes in the refrigerator because we have a heat advisory today and I don't want the frosting to melt and run, but I'm expecting the chilled frosting will be fun to eat anyway. My son suggested we make this to add to brownies next time. There goes the diet.

Fantastic!  My kids love to eat cookie dough so I got on here to look for a recipe for an eggless version. This one is perfect! We didn't have whipping cream so I added in Sweetened condensed milk, which was also yummy.
