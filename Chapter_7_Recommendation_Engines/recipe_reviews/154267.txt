I baked this in 2 8x4 pans and the baking time was only 40 minutes. We love the holiday fruit and eggnog taste. Great bread!

This turned out wonderful- I could tell it's a good cake batter by how smooth it was once mixed. I used golden raisins currants and dried cranberries. The texure of the cake is perfect: not crumbly around the fruit moist without being terribly dense.

Delicious! I baked it for only 60 minutes and should have taken it out earlier still. I used full fat full flavor egg nog and switched out chunks of a dried fruit bar for the candied fruit which I did not have on hand. The dough is springy and moist and I thought it was very flavorful. My hubby and I ate half the loaf for breakfast it was so good!

So easy to make and it turned out excellent! This was an experiment for me as I made a few adjustments to accommodate my egg allergy and to also make it a little lower in calories (used egg substitute light egg nog and only 1/4 sugar and the rest Splenda)so I did not expect it to turn out. I baked it for only 60 minutes and the result was a moist delicious bread that everyone loves. Great recipe!

made this over the holiday family like it enough that i made a second one 2 weeks after... but the first one was a little dry so on my second round i just add a little bit more eggnog and bake it for 60 instead of 70 mins. and come out nice...

The loaf came out really well. I think next time I will add more cherries and use mixed fruit instead of raisins. I will also add a bit of nutmeg as it could have been a bit spicier.

I doubled the recipe and got two regular sized loaves as well as one slightly larger loaf. I reduced the baking time to 60 minutes it doesn't need more than that. I used 3 cups of add-ins (mixture of green/red candied cherries raisins and other candied fruit though I omitted the nuts) that I soaked for a day in the remnants of a bottle of Tia Maria (that which I later poured over the cakes after pricking them a little). I do think this it could use another cup of add-ins but that's personal preference as the fruit cake my mother used to make was literally jam-packed with add-ins. I also added 2 tsps. of homemade pumpkin/apple pie spice. The eggnog flavour was barely detectable (maybe because of the addition of alcohol) so the next go around I'll try making it with milk to make it more cost effective.

This bread is definitely going to become a Christmas tradition. It is absolutely delicious. I prepared the recipe exactly as written except I omitted the raisins. I probably could have taken it out of the oven at 60 minutes but forgot about it until the timer went off at 70. It was a little dry on the outside but inside... mmmm..... Thank you for sharing this recipe!

This bread is pretty good. I exchanged currants and raisins for candied fruit. The bread did not have as much flavor as I expected. I have to adjust recipes because we live in 6000F and bread came out little dry. I am not sure if that is my adjustments or it is drier type of bread. It could be good with little bit of honey or jam.

Not crazy about this. I followed the recipe exactly but it was too dry and not sweet enough even with the addition of a coarse sugar topping. It didn't have a strong eggnog flavor and I would definitely increase the fruit. It did look very pretty though. I probably won't make this again.

i had eggnog and other ingredients left over from holiday baking. I substituted walnuts for pecans and added 1/2 c coconut along with the raisins and cherries. Really liked the bread so decided to make another loaf. This time I only added 1/2 c semi sweet chocolate chips and 1/2 c coconut. (My husband isn t a fan of raisins.) very good!

I would make this again. It is a very dense bread but quite tasty. I think you could put about any type of candied fruit into this bread so may try raisins and cranberries next time. Husband gave it two thumbs up.
