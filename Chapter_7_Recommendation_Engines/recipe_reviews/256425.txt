I don't like flavored or sweet coffee but made this for my husband and he said that it was really good but that it could have used a little bit more vanilla. I plan on experimenting with other flavors for him. Thanks for sharing!

I made this creamer using the Carmel sweetened condensed milk. I thought it was good and economical. My husband thought it was lacking enough flavor but good overall.

This is a good recipe if you are trying to save $ since coffee creamer is expensive.  My husband is one that has a little coffee with his creamer so we are always having to buy more.  I followed the directions (super easy).  I look forward to trying different flavors, maybe different types of milk like almond or coconut.

There are a lot of variations, play with this recipe!
You can use hemp, coconut or almond milk in place of milk, and I use more like 2 1/4c because sweetened condensed milk is crazy sweet. 
When I use hemp milk (which is thicker), I add something thinner for the extra 1/2c so that it's not so thick.
Also, in place of vanilla extract you can use almond extract!
So simple and versatile!

I made it as the recipe states and also made it with caramel sweetened condensed milk. I like them both.  Very easy!

I ended up adding a teaspoon more vanilla and a small amount of sugar to it. it just wasn't sweet enough.

Forgot to by creamer at the store, so I figured I would give this a try. 
I made my own sweetened condensed milk with
1 (12 oz) can evap milk
1 Â³/4 cup sugar
1 tsp vanilla

Then I added everything to the recipe above. I like it. I will definitely make it again. I think I'm going to play with flavors next time.

Simply easy to make but I did have to add more  Vanilla extract, heavy whipping cream and sugar to make it  More like a creamer you would buy in the store which were use to.   I think this recipe is a great start to tweak the way you want it.
