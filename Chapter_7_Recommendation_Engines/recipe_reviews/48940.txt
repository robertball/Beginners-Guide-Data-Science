this was a big hit at christmas.  No matter how hard I have tried I do not like almond flavoring so I altered the flavorings a little I used 4 Tablespoons of vanilla and 1/4 of a teaspoon of the almond.  I then added frozen strawberries, orange slices, maraschino cherries and pineapples to the punch bowl I used gingerale in the first bowl and then I used rapberry gingerale in the second and then grape gingerale in the third all three disappeared.  And I still had syrup leftover!

Oh my sweetness! I made this recipe and at my house we called it "Homemade Cream Soda" which is more how I would classify it than Vanilla Punch. It was sickingly sweet but you can cut that by adding more ginger ale or ice. It was delicious though! Love that vanilla flavor!

I used this as a base for making a white/ivory punch and it looked like clouds in the punch bowl.  I made the syrup using regular dark pure vanilla since I wanted to get a bit of ivory color, although it didn't change it much.  Scoop 1/2 gallon pineapple sherbet into the punch bowl.  Pour 1c. chilled syrup over the scoops then pour on 2-3L. of chilled mixed berry sparkling water.  Let it set about about 1/2 hour (so you can make this plenty ahead of time) and then stir/fold the mixture well before serving.  I found that 1c. syrup to 2L. water makes it pretty sweet so if you want less, then reduce the amount of syrup or add another L. of the sparkling water.  The mixed berry added just enough zing to the taste, the syrup sweetened the water plenty, and it was "colorless".  The perfect white punch.

I made this for a baby shower and everyone liked it. I will use it again because it is always nice to have something different that is pleasing to everyone. Until I found this posted here I had never heard of vanilla punch before. Now I have something that is as universally liked as sprite and pineapple punch but it is different enough to stand out.

Tested this for my mom's wedding.  It was WAY too sweet.  We both have a sweet tooth, but couldn't tolerate even one entire glass of this.

The punch was delicious to not only me but to 6 young ladies who ages range from 5 - 10 years old. I found this recipe when I was searching for a clear punch in which I wouldn't have to worry if it was spilled onto my cream colored carpet. It was perfect the perfect recipe.

This punch is requested at almost every event I cater... even some that I don't. ;) I have utilized some of the ideas of others, always with rave results.  I have tinted it blue, pink & left it the original cream color.  I have put ice cream in it... used flavored ales... floated fruit... you name it, it has been done. You can't go wrong with this punch.  Be adventurous, use your imagination & enjoy.

This a fall back when I cater and they do not want a fruit punch. It helps to cut the sweetness if you add a bottle of club soda or tonic water.

I used this recipe for a bridal shower. It was kind of plain by itself, the taste was good...but it just looked like soda. I added fresh raspberries and chopped up mint leaves and added this to the punch. It was a hit. The subtle additions in flavor made this recipe wonderful! And it was very aesthetically pleasing :)Thanks!

This is an excellent punch.  I've used this recipe or one just like it for about 11 years and everyone loves it.  For a twist change the measurements a little and use 7 c sugar, 5 c water, 5 T vanilla, 5 T almond extract, one can of frozen pineapple and 1 can of frozen lemonade.  It gives it a kick.  This is a favorite at all of our church functions

Wonderful clear punch! Didn't have to worry about the ice melting because it was even better after the ice melted. I put the leftover syrup mixture in diet pepsi and it was so good.

This punch turned out fantastic.  Everyone at my daughter's first birthday raved about it.  Mixing the syrup was a cinch.  The only problem I had was when it came time to serve it, the refrigerated syrup had thickened and settled a bit.  After a few short bursts in the microwave though it was remedied and the final punch was great.

My sister-in-law gave me this recipe recently and I logged in today to create a new recipe for it but was really happy to see it already on here. I use real vanilla extract when I make this but when you mix it with ginger ale, it will turn that color anyways so I'm fine with using it. Also, i haven't heated mine up to dissolve the sugar but will try it next time. I just mixed it well before pulling the 1 cup syrup and that worked fine.

I was pleasantly surprised..this didn't sound like something that I would like very well.  I was looking for a punch that didn't have a lot of color and thought I would try it for my parents 60th Anniversary.  I saw comments that it was very sweet so I left out a cup of sugar and used half splenda to cut sugar but not sweetness.  My nephew camped out at the punch bowl.

Great punch, great hit , especially with men.  This is an easy recipe and the results are always received well.  I do a lot of church functions and this is always a big hit...especially the men.  They line up to get 2nds and 3rds.  This is a great make ahead recipe as a stress saver for those last minute parties. I have passed this recipe on to many,

When I put the punch in the refrigerator, I used a BALL Jar that holds 4 cups. It has a measurement on the side and I let it sit in the glass (open) until it cooled and then put it in the fridge.

I just finished a test batch of this recipe because I'm planning to serve it at a baby shower where the color theme is black and white and safari animals.  I found the champagne white color appealing for my theme.  (I used gingerale.)  The taste is very good and I would liken it to a very sweet 'Italian soda' which is a flavor syrup stirred into carbonated soda water.  I will probably dilute the syrup more than called for so it suits my taste but that's easily achieved. 

The reason I gave 3 stars is for the consistency.  It's not very special for a punch bowl.

To remedy that I plan to float some scoops of Breyers Vanilla ice cream in the bowl to give it more fizzle and appeal.  I agree with another reviewer that it is like cream soda.  So I guess it will be a giant cream soda float!

I am giving this 5 stars because it was so easy to make and it turned out great.  I made it for a wedding reception at church and added some frozen mixed berries for garnish.  This did turn the punch pink but added a little extra touch.  I had enough syrup to make two batches (2 liters each) and have plenty syrup left to make at least 3 more batches.

I am a big fan of creme sodas so I was eager to try this after reading the reviews. I was not disappointed. I cut the recipe in hlaf to give it a try, used real vanilla extract & I didn't make punch. Just put the syrup in a bottle & added a couple of tbp to a glass of iced gineger ale. Yummm. Thanks so much for a new addiction, Teri G.!

I noticed a lot of the multiple star recipes made alterations. I made the recipe as noted and we did not enjoy it. It tasted like medicine. I had two sips and couldn't stand it. Must have been the ginger ale. If I were to make this again (and I probably won't), I would use the lemon-lime soda.

Wonderful punch for my little one's 1st birthday party!  I added 3T of the clear vanilla extract and 1T of the almond extract, used ginger ale and added frozen strawberries along with the ice.  Everyone loved it!

Most guests seemed to enjoy it, I found it crazy-sweet! I poured the syrup into half-pint jars before refrigerating so I can just grab one...don't like measuring the sticky stuff :) I used Seagram's ginger ale.

As written this punch was far to sweet and had too much almond. Almond is one of my favorite flavors but it was overpowering in the original ratio.

Made this punch to serve at a Christmas party at our home.  I did NOT want people to spill and stain our carpets, so I searched for a "clear punch" recipe.  THIS IS AWESOME!  People were seriously RAVING about it...I made the syrup and added it to a combination of CLUB SODA & GINGER ALE to taste - probably more club soda - not as much syrup.  It was refreshing, not too sweet.  I also floated ORANGE SLICES and ice in the punch bowl.  It looked so festive!  It was not your typical "punch"!!  Try it and you will love it!  (don't use real vanilla because it will turn your punch dark - use the clear!)

We made this for a wedding that used black and white for the color scheme. The punch was OK, but not great. Too sweet for my taste.
