Very good, tastes authentic.  I use ground beef instead of lamb and serve with the traditional garlic sauce:  4 gloves of garlic, peeled and crushed, 1/4 c olive oil, juice of 1 lemon, 1/4 teaspoon salt.  Process in blender or food processor.  If the mixture is too runny, add mayo to thicken it to a creamy-thick consistency.  Serve over the koftas.

Made these with only ground beef, and baked them for 25 minutes at 350, and served them with some lettuce, yogurt, tomatoes, and a sliced up garlic pickle in a pita - delicious!!!

We recently moved from the Detroit metro area where we were lucky enough to have our choice of many of the best middle eastern restaurants in the U.S.  These kebabs taste just like the Kofta we sampled in so many places - delicious!!  We used beef instead of lamb, but I have also had chicken kofta.

Bored with the same ol' same ol,' I decided to throw caution to the wind and go for something completely foreign to me. I planned this around an entire Middle Eastern dinner!  I have never had anything like this.  (I know, where have I been all my life?)  I wasn't sure at all that I'd like all the spices, many of which were common to a pumpkin pie!  I was particularly wary of the cinnamon and was tempted to cut it way back.  But I was eager to try this, and figured if worse came to worst we could always come up with Plan B.  I was so pleased, so surprised!  Somehow the myriad of spices all come together and produce something pleasantly and mildly flavorful, albeit unusually so.  I found they're not as good on their own, however, as they are tucked in a pita or flatbread with some fresh greens and tzatziki sauce (thinly sliced tomato and red onion would have been very good with this too - wish I would have thought of that BEFORE we sat down to dinner)  I made them into little sausage shapes, two per skewer, then turned them over to Hubs, who grilled them to perfection over charcoal.  Still, this preparation of meat is different and unfamiliar to most of us, and as such won't appeal to everyone - as it did not with my mother...  (Note: I used two parts lamb, one part ground chuck)

Pretty tasty. I made mine half and half with ground beef and ground pork and doubled the recipe. I was worried that the spices might be overwhelming, but they weren't. I didn't bother shaping the meat into 28 (or 56!) round balls, I just formed cylinders (about 4" by 1.5") around the skewers. The double recipe made 10 portions this way. The meat was nice and moist after grilling. They were great grilled and served with pita bread, tomatoes, cucumbers and tzatziki.

I have followed the recipe perfectly in the past and made delicious kofta, but more recently I started using lean chevap meat instead. It tasted absolutely divine!

Pretty good. It was enough for 2 maybe 3 people, I made 3 average size skewers, I have no idea why it says you need 28 skewers. I couldn't even make 4 with 1 lb of lamb. But it was perfect for me and my man. Very juicy, great flavor. If you have a family I would make 2 lbs. I served with yogurt sauce I made, grilled pita breads, lettuce, tomato, and cucumber.

Delicious! My family loved these and asked me to make them every week. I did use ground turkey instead of lamb. I add one egg per pound of meat and also used fresh mint. The flavor was great!

This recipe was so good that I immeduately threw away a recipe card I had with a different recipe for kofta kababs on it. I thought the spices of yours were perfect. I made mine with ground beef instead of ground lamb, minced the onion instead of grating it, and broiled the kebabs (6 minutes one side, 7 minutes the other side) without skewers, but only forming them into cigars.  I doubled your recipe which then successfully served 4 people.

We love greek food, but certainly were not fond of this recipe.  We all thought there was entirely too much cinnamon in it.

These were very tasty. I also made mine with beef (lamb's too gamey for me) and baked the skewers on racks. I think they'd taste better grilled, I just didn't feel like messing with a grill today. I served the kebabs in pita bread with spinach, tzatziki sauce, and feta. Soo tasty.

These are soooo good! I added some chopped mint and doubled the recipe using half hamburger and half lamb. What is the DEAL with the servings on the recipe? 28 skewers? With a double batch we only had 7 skewers. Definitely one of our favorite recipes. Everyone loves it!

I used a mixture of ground beef and lamb.  I was a little wary of so much allspice and cinnamon but it really works.  This made really great koftas that went well with tzatzki and grilled pita bread.  I will make this again.

Spices, herbs, seasonings and aromatics are perfectly balanced to the flavor of the lamb. I made 20 skewers and let them set in the fridge overnight to ensure a crisp crust. They cooked on a hot grill in just under 5 minutes to a perfect juicy medium.  Served on grilled "Naan" (recipe this site) with feta, tomato, shallot rings, tender baby lettuce from the garden and tzatsiki. Simple  and delicious meal.

Took these to and EID potluck tonight and they were gone in a flash.  Everyone loved these and I was asked for the recipe a few times. I loved these because they tasted authentic and were so easy to make.  I actually almost tripled the recipe (to 72 servings) which only used 2 1/2 pounds of meat.  Out of this, I really only got about 20 normal/good size kebabs, so keep that in mind when making this recipe.  28 servings out of 1 pound of meat? I don't think so. You may get 6 lunch or dinner sized servings out of it.  I used half chicken and half turkey because that is what I had on hand and I may keep making it this way in the future because they were just so good (and healthy).

These were quite tasty. There was a little too much cinnamon flavor for my tastes, so I might go up in the cumin and coriander next time. I might also add a little more parsley.  The only things I did differently were to use all beef instead of lamb, and I baked it in the oven in the form of meatballs (350 for 25 minutes as recommended by another reviewer) and they came out great.

Great great recipe. I made them with all ground beef. I would recommend adding 1/2-3/4 cup of ground rice (cream of rice will work). My Mom always makes them that way. It's kind of like adding breadcrumbs to meatballs. Gives them a bit of a melt in your mouth texture.

Great flavor!  Sometimes I use ground beef instead of the lamb, and I get rave reviews either way.   I serve it with pita, tzatzaiki, and grill up some veggies alongside the meat.  It's not authentic, but is so good!
The only reason I didn't give this five stars that 28 small balls on skewers is too time-consuming.  Instead, I just form tubes, and previous reviewers have stated.  All in all, a great ethnic recipe!

We tried two versions of Kofta Kebabs (both as meatballs baked in the oven - at 350, then cranked up to crisp a bit; put them on a cookie rack above a baking dish so they didn't just sit in their own grease), and this one was the favorite! The amount of cinnamon is correct (or at least delicious) as written, although some reviewers were put off by the quantity. These meatballs are a good mix of exotic and savory. I used beef and mixed it all together with my hands to really get the spices worked in. Lots of compliments - wish I'd made more!

AMAZING Recipe! This seasoned meat tastes like a $20 restaurant plate at a decent middle eastern restaurant - and is sooo much easier and cheaper to make at home! I went a little free-handed with some spices I know my boyfriend and I like more - parsely and cumin. I really don't think you can mess it up, no matter how you proportion =)

made this recipe with ground beef (85% lean), turkey (dark meat) and lamb. folks really loved it; although the lamb and turkey kabobs were more popular than the beef. wrapped a large handful onto each skewer, the recipe made 6 skewers. grilled then cut them into 1 inch pieces for pita stuffing...excellent recipe!

I use this recipe to make lamb burgers for my fiance at least once a month and we both think this recipe is perfect just as written.  That's new for me, since I never follow recipes and always put my own spin on things.  This one doesn't need my spin.

We serve our burgers with tzatziki sauce (I make my own), tomatoes, feta cheese, cucumbers and red onions. Delicious!

I also used ground beef as this was what we had in the freezer. Absolutely fabulous! Since I made the kofta in the spur of the moment, I didn't check on my spices. I only had 1 tsp. of dried coriander so I added a generous 2 tbsp. chopped fresh cilantro. Perfect! Thank you. We will enjoy again!

I've been looking for a good recipe for Kofta since I was in Pakistan in 2002.  I finally found it.  I made it using veal (no lamb handy) and it was wonderful.  Thank you.

IT was too much work to prepare it outdoor so I cooked it in a pan with EVOO.  I used 1/2 lean ground beef and 1/2 fatty ground beef.  Did not put any cinammon but Allspice made it just as tasty.  I made this 6-7 times already.  I freeze the leftovers and it tastes just as good any day in the week.  Love this recipe!

I have made these several times, for many people young and old.  Everybody loves this.  No matter by how much I increase the amount made they are ALWAYS finished.

With only two minor differences, be aware this is pretty much an exact duplicate of the Kofta Kebab recipe from the Food Network Kitchen. The only difference being that the copycat here misstated two measurements from the original:  instead of a 1/2 tsp of cinnamon as originally called for, the poster here says to use 1 tablespoon.    Instead of 1 tablespoon of kosher salt, this poster says to use 1 teaspoon.  IMHO the original Food Network recipe has the better proportions of those two, and since it isn't stolen from someone else, I'd go with that version.

I made this with ground beef and baked it for 18 minutes at 350. Turned out great. The spice mixture is right on, I'd add more cayenne for spicier tastes and less cayenne for kids & those with lower spice tolerance.

I used 80% lean ground beef instead of lamb (only because I'm a cheapo). It was absolutely delicious! It was very moist with the high fat content beef, and so flavorful. It is definitely good enough to eat on its own, but would also be good with a dipping sauce. I'm going to make this and bring it to my next party.

Lovely.  Where I live ground lamb is rarely available and when it is, very expensive, so I used a half-half mix of ground chicken and ground pork.  Cut back on the cinnamon just a bit, but not too much - basically put in 3/4 of what the recipe calls for.  Smelled amazing whilst cooking.  Tasted delicious.  Served with home made tzatziki  and a light salad of cucumber, tomato, peppers, olive oil and lemon juice - bit of salt and pepper and oregano.  Perfect meal for the low g.i. diet I am on.

I was worried about all of the spices but they turned out absolutely delicious, very tender and flavourful. I served them naan bread, tzaziki, tomato and red onion. ( You could use pita as well).
Accompanied by a lovely fresh Greek salad made this a fabulous meal.

I saw others' comments about the amount of cinnamon and noticed that the amount was off in terms of larger to smaller amounts of the other ingredients so took it down to 1/2 teaspoon instead of 1/2 Tbs (which is an odd measurement anyway).  I skipped the skewers and just shaped into long sausage shapes and grilled inside on a George Foreman. Heated the pitas up on there after wiping the grill down. Served with a tzatziki yogurt/cucumber sauce and some chopped lettuce. Delicious!

I thought this was very good.  My children weren't crazy about it, but I suppose I should be more surprised that they were willing to eat it at all.  ;)  I was worried that the amount of cinnamon would be too much, but it turned out to have the perfect flavor.  I did substitute dried minced onion for the grated onion and I broiled them for about 7 minutes in my oven instead of grilling, since it was cold and rainy outside.  I let them rest for just over an hour and did not make them into kabobs, just 9 smallish ovals of meat.

INCREDIBLE... really easy to make, I wouldn't change a thing. We had them with quinoa and tomatoes, avacado, and feta... they would be really good with tzatsiki or some kind of cooling sauce. You have to try these!

My husband is a hunter and has been bringing home goat meat. I usually make it into curry but thought I'd try something new. I saw this recipe and and heard that goat could be substituted in recipes for lamb so I figured I'd give it a try. The jury is still out on how the husband likes it since he hasn't eaten yet but I thought it was really good. As suggested by another reviewer, I served with a yogurt sauce from this site.

This was fantastic!  After having similar kebabs over the summer made by a woman from Israel, I've always wanted to make something similer, although I didn't think I would be able to.  These were surprisingly easy and taste very authentic. After reading the other reviews I decided to mix in 1/3 beef (1lb lamb and 1/2 lb ground beef).  I didn't increase the spices although I increased the meat and it was still delicious.  This recipe is a keeper for sure, thanks for sharing!

This recipe was delicious with ground bison. Because the bison is pretty lean, I couldn't get it to stay on skewers, so I remedied that problem by putting a sheet of foil below them and poking the foil with a fork to get the flavor of the grill to come through. I did not have ground coriander, but used a spice mix with coriander as the first ingredient that also contained several other of the listed ingredients. I could not resist adding a little smoked paprika, either. Great with tzatziki; I'm finally getting through my glut of cucumbers.

I tried this recipe last night and loved it!  I made the following substitutions: instead of ground lamb I used extra lean ground beef, replaced garlic cloves with garlic paste and I finely chopped the onion (couldn't figure out how to grate it). Rather than making the kofta kebabs as appetizers I made 4 large kebabs and bbq'd them on the grill on top of aluminum foil for approx. 12 mins.  I served them with pita bread, hummus, a Greek salad and some steamed veggies.  Very yummy!  Next time I'll try to incorporate a bit of lemon and/or mint to add some zestiness.

Have been using this recipe for years!  The only difference in my preparation is that I grate an entire onion into the mix, add more parsley, and I also add dried or fresh mint.

Perfect as is!  We got 8 decent size kebabs from them - 2 each!  Goes well with roasted bullhorn peppers stuffed with feta, couscous salad and tzatziki. Going to make them for our street party/BBQ this weekend. :)

This recipe ROCKS. I've made it twice and the flavors are fantastic and the kebabs are so moist. Remind me of the kebabs I'd eat in India. Instead of skewers, I roll them into 3 inch sausages and cook them in the cast iron skillet. We then eat them in a pita pocket with tzatziki and veggies. Definitely a go-to meal for us now.

Excellent.   I am currently on a cleanse and this recipe qualified with the ingredients.   Bursting with flavor.    Next time, when not on a cleanse, I'll try serving with a greek yogurt/mint sauce on the side.

We had Greek night at our house, with my husbands assistance, we turned out quite the meal.  We did make these Kofta Kebobs and were very impressed with the outcome...Although, personally, I would cut back on the cinnamon a little, I felt it was very overwhelming.  All of the spices really changed the way the meat tasted..By the way, we changed up the lamb for 1/2 lb of ground beef that was 94% lean and 1/2 lb. of ground pork.  We were very pleased with kebobs and will make them again using our original method, but lessen the cinnamon.

Very good.  I used a bit less cinnamon (personal preference) but other than that followed it to a "t". Did not use skewers, simply rolled into oblong shape and threw onto the (indoor) grill. Sprinkled with sumac and served with lettuce, cucumber, yogurt, radishes and tomato.

These kabobs were good.  Next time I will not add the cinnamon.  I really try to like cinnamon in savory foods, but I just don't care for it.  Other than that, they were tasty, even my 4 year old son ate them.

These were great. My changes were: 1/4 tsp allspice, instead of the onion use 1/2 T onion powder, and add 1/4 cup breadcrumbs. Instead of putting them on skewers I just formed them into long cylindrical meatballs and fried them in oil like my mother in law does. Then I made a sauce made of tomato sauce, garlic, and a little cinnamon and a dash of pepper to go with them. These were good!

These are really good! DH found them a bit too spicey, so I cut down on the amount of spice the second time I made them. I also did half ground beef and half ground lamb, but besides that delicious.   (I tried a recipe from an actual cookbook for kofta, and those were terrible. These were sooo much better.)

My son doesn't really like hamburgers, but he LOVED these skewers. He described the meat as "sweet", and really wished there was more than the 1lb. We had this with lettuce and Tzatziki Sauce, tucked inside soft pita bread. It was pretty fantastic.

My husband is Jordanian and this is a good recipe.  We thought the cayenne pepper was slightly too strong, we'll use a little less next time.

This is exactly the recipe I was looking for. The herbs are worth the effort, though I used fresh mint as I think that goes better with lamb. I also made about 14 big kebabs as 28 would have been tiny.

Made these with ground beef and the spiced flavour was delicious. The cinnamon and cumin really stood out. I used extra-lean ground beef and they dried out quickly on the grill. Next time I will use moister beef/pork combo and consider adding egg/milk-soaked breadcrumbs. All in all, very flavourful. Thanks for posting!

Made these in celebration of "Things on a Stick Day". Fantastic and super tasty! I accidentally added a tablespoon of cumin instead of a teaspoon, but it worked. I also only needed five skewers, guess l made the balls larger than the recipe called for.

Fantastic! Baked instead of grilled, and served with garlic sauce. I've used other recipes for this dish, but prefer this one.  Thanks for sharing!

I did not care for this recipe. The spice mixture was fine. I used lean ground beef and baked it in the oven as other reviewers suggested but it came out dry. Maybe the oven temp or the cook time was too long. Either way, the flavor wasn't there.

My family loves this recipe! We make it with ground beef and serve it with homemade pitas and yogurt sauce.  In the winter, I cook it in the oven and it still tastes yummy!  The garlic is a little strong and I sometimes only make it with 3 cloves instead of 4.  The only problem with this recipe is that it does not make 28 skewers.  I can usually just put it on 5 large skewers or so.

My family loves this recipe,  I always double it.  Many Americans don't like to use lamb, it took me years of living in Australia to even try it, and I loved it.  Don't be afraid to use lamb in this recipe it's amazing!

Used 20oz. Package of ground turkey. All measurements the same. The floors came together very nicely. This is similar to Armenian Losh Kebobs, but taste very different. I will definitely make them again. I served them with traditional Armenian rice pilaf.

I liked the meatballs made with only beef, but none of the family liked it.  I cooked in the oven at 350 and they were done in 15 minutes, and at that, they were a bit over done.  Unfortunately, now I have aa whole pan of meatballs I have to eaat myself.  I will eat them, but disappointed no one else liked them.

Very flavorful, but almost too much so.  I could barely taste the lamb in these.  I will probably make again, but may cut back the spices just a bit.  Quick and easy to make, with a side of Naan and Rice.

I used beef in place of the lamb (although I am sure lamb is wonderful in this recipe!)  I cut back on most of the spices just a bit and added some fresh mint.  Very flavorful and just like the kind I get in a local Middle Eastern restaurant.  I skewered some onion and pepper along with the meat and served over couscous and drizzled with tzatziki.   Warm pita triangles on the side.  YUMMY.

So very aromatic and delicious! My kids basically hate all food. BUT, they actually came in from playing outside, to find what smelled so delicious! After razing the platter, they demanded I make a second batch. Who knew picky suburbanite white kids in the western US go nuts for middle eastern food?

These were yummy.  Because there was too much snow on the deck to get to the grill, I made small patties and cooked them in the skillet.  I'm looking forward to trying them again on the grill.

To suit my kids taste I LEFT OUT the allspice, cinnamon, and cardamon. But left everything else the same. If you have access to farmers market lamb, try it, it's mild these days. And they were quite wonderful.I also broil my kofta (see directions below) I skewer them three per skewer, which came out to 21. And we just eat off the skewer with a yogurt sauce.
I always cook my kofta in the BROILER. Seems such an ordeal to get a grill going when a broiler will work perfectly. Let the broiler heat up while you prepare the ingredients. Then place a oiled roasting grate over a shallow cookie sheet. And raise the oven grate to the second highest level. 
I broil 6 minutes on either each side, until they look well browned...slightly less well done than the picture above, but still crispy.

Outstanding.  These tasted just like our local restaurant! The seasonings were perfect, nothing overpowering.   I doubled the recipe and I made only 7 kebobs.  This is one to make over and over.

I made this using ground lamb and pretty much followed the recipe except that I did not use the cayenne. I subbed fresh peppermint for the parsley and cut back on the garlic to only 3 clove. I put 3 "patties" per metal skewer, making 12 patties in all.   Wow, so tasty!  My son, who doesn't like lamb in any form loved this.  We put the patties in pita with homemade tzatziki sauce, thin sliced onion and tomato, and shredded lettuce.  I will definitely make this again.  Not difficult and very flavorful.  This recipe is a keeper, for sure.

Amazing!  I tweeked the recipe slightly, but mostly stuck to it.  I didn't have any allspice, so I replaced it with nutmeg and I added roughly 3 tablespoons of freshly chopped mint.  I served it with tzatziki sauce over rice pilaf with a cucumber salad.  My husband and I cleaned our plates!  It seems like a lot of people opted to replace the lamb with beef, but I'd suggest trying it with the lamb.  You won't be disappointed!

Thought it was good!  I used turkey and bummed that my husband over cooked it :(.  The other minor change was to omit the cinnamon...I'm not into adding cinnamon to any dish except dessert lol.  I didn't make 28 but 10 4" koftas.

Loved this, served with Tzatziki sauce.  Followed recipe exactly, but I did alter the cooking method since it was 10 degrees here and I didn't want to fire up the grill.  I made them into four hand formed loafs (4 ounces each) placed them in a baking pan and baked them at 350 for 20 minutes.  Served with the Tzatziki (also from Allrecipes) and a fennel salad with red peppers, mandarin orange, red onion with a light apple cider vinaigrette.

This one gets a 5+++ from us!  Quick and easy to mix up and so full of flavor.  I'm sure it would taste much better using lamb, though our budget wouldn't stretch right now.  Used equal portions of ground turkey and italian sausage, served on pita bread with tzaziki sauce and sliced cukes.  Will be a repeat for us!

Too much work! Funny way to start a 5-star review, but I had to rate it that after tasting them!

I used all lamb & made them into little oval patties that I baked on a broiler pan (so grease would drip down). This was unnecessary as there wasn't much grease. And I think they'd be even better fried or on a grill.

Next time: no mincing onion nor mashing garlic -- I'll just do that in the food processor. Well worth making & freezing for future pita pocket stuffers.

This was delicious!  Taste just like the kofta I order from the restaurants.  I only marinaded them for 30 minutes and rather than put them on skewers, I just rolled them into the elongated shape as pictured and cooked them in a grill pan on the stove.  Very easy!

Delish koftas!  Only thing I did was reduce the salt by half as I only had table salt and also reduce the amount of cinnamon per the other reviews.  I bakes it in a 350F/180C oven on a rack for 20 mins and was easier.

Lamb is out of my price range so i make these with a ground pork/beef combo.  These are easy and great! Very similar to a gyro type flavor.  I skip the cinnamon and the ginger...I've tried those types of flavors w/meat and its just not my thing but this recipe is amazing without them.  They're def better if you mix the meat & spices the day before and let the flavors marry overnight+.  I've also made them as meatballs for parties.  I make them w/tzatziki or, even better, Barefoot Contessa's Yogurt Mint Sauce on the Food Network site.  Deslish!

Delicious!!! Thanks for the recipe SRKELZ! I think if I went with the original recipe it would have been better but I was lazy. Used ground beef 90/10, because it was in the freezer and dry spices (no cumin as I did not have any on hand), parsley was fresh out of the ground though. The spice mixture was spot on for this dish. I made 4 skewers, 1/4 pound each, and cooked on the grill for 12 minutes with a flip halfway through and they were perfect.  The grated onion and fresh garlic would have added a little more moisture but they were very edible.

I followed the recipe except I used beef- will try the lamb next time just didn't have any and I didn't have any ground coriander.  The flavor was nice- heavy on the garlic, but the other spices complemented well.  After getting the skewers all ready and getting these on the grill I decided next time to ditch the skewers.  I just didn't think I needed them.  I think this might make an interesting burger in a pita with some middle eastern toppings.  Thanks for sharing.  We love to try new things.

I prepared these, and it was amazing! It was so authentic, so delicious...   I used ground beef, and instead of fresh cilantro I used a cilantro paste, and I was out of cardamom so i simply omitted it, and it was so delicious, my husband has been begging me to prepare them again!  I broiled them in the oven instead of grilling, and they were perfect.   I would reccomend this to anyone... even my 5 year old loves them... make them with rice pilaf or lebanese potatoes (recipe on this site) and a green bean salad and you have an amazing meal... dont forget the pita and tzatziki!

This really deserves the five stars! Nice spice blend, did 3 cloves of garlic instead of 4 due to the fact we were going out that night. I left my meat overnight in the fridge which makes the flavor more intense, and when ready to use take it out ahead of time to let the meat come to tempature, again this inhances the flavor.

These were amazing! I doubled the recipe but tripled most of the herbs, spices and onion. I served it with Tzatziki, homemade hummus (topped with EVOO, pitted Kalamata olives and chopped parsley), warmed pita bread, wedges of tomatoes and cucumbers on a bed of lettuce with greek dressing. It was SO tastey! Thanks for the recipe!

We use hamburger because we don't have access to ground lamb, plus lambs are just so dang cute, but this is part of our regular rotation. I actually use the garam masala recipe from this app and adjust the amount to match the amount of spices listed here. I make a large quantity so this ends up being really easy to prep. I always make tzatziki and have hummus and pita or naan bread with this. Roasted tomatoes with feta cheese and oregano also make a great side with these

I used to date a guy from Lebanon.  He would make this as a special treat to me and I never got recipe before he went back.  All I remembered was the cinnamon...   I tried this and I’m so happy!   This may be even better than his!   Served with olive oil couscous and watched it disappear!!

Made these last night with 93/7 ground beef (WW friendly) and I cut the cinnamon down to half a TEASPOON... cooked the little footballs on a oiled grill pan and I didn’t skewer them(very informal).  They were super juicy and delicious!!

Great recipe. I made a few minor changes based on personal preference and what I remember the street vendors in India doing. So I use a blend of ground beef (as done by Indian street chefs) and chorizo (about a 2:1 blend). I also chop up some green bell pepper to go with the onions and add a teaspoon of clove powder for that slow heat. Finally, lacking easy access to a grill at my apartment, I cook these in my oven at 350 degrees for about 15 minutes and that works just great.

I’m from Detroit also...and miss Greektown. I was more of a dolmatas/Greek salad/Opa! girl....but these tasted great. I served them with tomatoes, cucumbers and onions, pita bread and a zesty dill sauce I made (sour cream, fresh dill, lime juice) I also added some feta to mine...because...you know...FETA!! Not sure I’ll make this recipie again. 14 year old step-daughter wouldn’t touch it and my husband is more interested in watching TV and eating chips lol. I think my kids in their 20’s would like it.

Made these twice now. The spices really add wonderful savoury flavour. Goes great with tzatziki or any yogurt sauce. 
Tip: don’t turn the lamb too soon. It will move easily when it’s seared. If the kofta is sticking to the pan give it another minute.

We doubled the amount using 1lb of ground lamb and 1lb of lean ground beef (93/7) and baked at 375F for 25min. Next time I will try a less lean ground beef to see if it will come out a bit less dry. Overall though it was an excellent recipe!

Perfect and easy.  I used 1 lb of g. lamb and 1/2 lb of g. chuck.  made into sausage shape and baked at 350 degrees for 25 min. Served on warmed pita bread with cukes, lettuce, sliced onion and cherry tomatoes.  When I have raw onions on hamburgers or salads, I usually slice and soak in ice water for ten minutes.  They aren't as strong that way.  I also made the garlic sauce another post mentioned.  I am making this for the second time.

The only change I made was adding chopped mint to the meat, for which I used half lamb and half beef. Excellent recipe, very tasty.

Since this was the first time making this, I did not change the recipe at all, and I wouldn't next time either.  I served these as an appetizer and my guests RAVED about them.  I will definitely make this again!

These relatively easy to make and came out tasty.  I did cut the amount of cinnamon in half and it was fine for the recipe.  I also made the meat balls about triple the size recipe called for as I had bigger sticks I was working with.   Still Cooked fine on the grill.

So good! Made these with ground turkey and made into patties since I was a little pressed for time. So basically made turkey burgers with them. Even my picky eater loved them.

These were amazing! I loved the spice combination. I doubled mine up on the skewers, since it seemed like a waste to only put one little meatball on each skewer, and stuck a mini sweet pepper in between them. We ate on pitas that we also grilled, with yogurt and cucumber. I wish lamb were cheaper so I could make these more often!

I bought a lamb roast then filleted and ground the meat myself. I only had six skewers so my portions were big. I left the onions out due to personal preference but it turned out really well.

We've never eaten anything like this before and were unsure what to expect. I followed the recipe exactly except I baked them at 350 for about a half hr instead of grilling them. I only used 4 skewers and shaped the lamp mixture into 2 inch ovals and put 3 on each skewer. I served it with a Tzatziki sauce that I found on this site. Both hubby and I really enjoyed it. The flavors were so different than anything we normally eat and they were so good!

These turned out AMAZING! This recipe made 16 nice pingpong sized balls. For those of you who feel that there was too much cinnamon, try using ground cardamom instead. It still subtly gives it those warm, sweet notes but it adds real depth.  I will definitely be making this again. Thanks for such a great recipe!

We have an Egyptian restaurant that we go to for their Kofta kebabs and I really wanted to make them at home. This recipe was GREAT! The flavors were spot on - thanks for sharing this. Definitely would make again and share with friends.

Note that I made them on longer metal skewers and seared on high for 2 minutes each side and then 4 minutes each side after on medium, rotating continually to get an even cook. YUM!

Love this recipe, it's a go to for me when we are grilling Mediterranean style foods.  Very authentic, sometimes I use lamb and sometimes we use lean beef, either way they have always turned out delicious.

Delicious. An easy sauce to serve with it is, that I got from another reviewer is: 4 cloves of garlic, peeled and crushed, 1/4 c. olive oil, juice of 1 lemon, 1/4 t. salt. Blend in food processor/blender.

We love this recipe! I make it following the recipe. I make about 20 meatball sized  balls, and then shape them onto mini skewers.  Baked at 350 for 25 min. We eat it with rice or couscous. Delicious!

This recipe is so delicious!  I make it at least monthly usually doubling the recipe for leftovers. Typically I skip putting them on skewers and just grill them directly turning frequently.  Occasionally I make larger patties and turn them into lamb burgers topped with grilled purple onions, tomatoes, tzaziki, and a small spread of hummus. Kofta night is always a hit!

I made this tonight for the first time. Will definitely be doing it again. I made the portions bigger though. I doubled the ingredients, and ended up with 18 skewers altogether. Crispy brown, barbecued in butter. I used tzatziki dip instead of yoghurt. Delicious!

Followed exactly. Seasonings tasted great. Instead of making that many small ones I got lazy and made 10 larger pieces to grill

Made with beef/pork mix. Used less cinnamon and subbed nutmeg for allspice, as that's all I had. Pan fried too. Served over rice (toasted garlic and pine nut). Topped with dressing recipe as provided in comments by reviewer named Chuck Wesserling. Simply delish!  Hubby can't wait to eat the leftovers tomorrow ;)

These are delicious! I didn't put them on skewers, but rather made them into patty-like shapes and grilled them. So much flavor!!! I used ground beef bc we can't afford lamb :)

I used ground beef because I didn't have lamb on hand and these turned out AMAAAAAZING. My husband and I both loved this recipe and it was easy as pie to make and grill. We served it over basmati rice with homemade tzatziki sauce and it was just killer.

These were amazing! I made them according to the recipe, and they tutned out perfectly.  I was surprised how juicy they were considering there was no binder like most meatballs. Will definitely make these more often!

This is a fine recipe for Kofkas, but it doesn't serve 28 people . I re-read the recipe about six times, trying to figure out how one pound of lamb was going to feed that many people. This recipe is for maybe 4 people at most. It needs to come off the category, "cooking for a crowd" - because it'll leave a crowd hungry, if that's all that's available for a main course.

Amazing!  I doubled the recipe and used half turkey and half beef because the grocery store was out of ground lamb.  The spices gave the meat a wonderful flavor. I served this with homemade pita bread and a Greek salad.   Will definitely make again.

I made these as directed, minus the cinnamon. I was pleased that they held up so well on the grill -- I was worried they would stick and fall apart. My only complaint would be that they were a little dry. They may have benefited from the addition of another ground meat, like veal or pork.

These are tasty, but no reason you can't make them with a lower fat meat, like lean ground beef.  Served in pitas and lettuce wraps with lemon-tahini sauce and a cucumber, tomato, onion, mint blend with lemon juice, salt and pepper.

This was incredibly delicious. I made it as directed except I used ground turkey thigh.  Because this meat can be dry I gently melted about 2 tablespoons butter in a small pot and used that as a base to mix all the seasonings.

They were good. Only downside is they were quit dry even though I followed the recipe perfectly. I suggest a side a tzatziki sauce for dipping

I'm Middle Eastern and grew up on these. This is a pretty good recipe. There is however a spice combo available at Middle Eastern markets called "7 Spice", which is as traditional as you can get, this recipe is missing a spice.

This combination of seasonings was delicious! I made my kebabs with onion and pepper, grilled in an iron skillet, and served on top of some basmati rice. I cooked the skewers for 6 minutes each, 3 minutes per side, for a beautiful medium. I did use cubed lamb chop, instead of ground lamb because I prefer steak to ground meat. I simply put all of the seasonings into a bowl and coated the lamb with it. I did need to use a little bit of olive oil to make it all stick and give the lamb a nice crust of the seasonings. It was absolutely delicious!

This is an excellent recipe but I think next time I will cut the cinnamon back just a little. Otherwise, I made it as written for the first time and served it with tzatziki sauce. I forgot to buy pita bread. That would have been perfection then! We will have these again at our house. Love lamb and it sure is fun to find creative ways to use it. Thanks for a wonderful recipe.

I love this recipe. The first time I made it I didn't have any lamb so used ground beef as others had done. I followed everything else as per the recipe. For cooking I place 4 of the kebab balls to one large metal skewer. Used ask many skewers as required based on how many servings I required.. This made rotating them during cooking very simple while being able to cook many in one sitting. While the ground beef turned out well the next two times I made them I used lamb and they were awesome. Everyone in the family loves them and will continue to make as per this recipe.

Delicious! I had about 1/2 lb lamb so I scaled it to 14 servings. I loved the spicy flavor with a nice kick (no coriander on hand). I don't have access to a grill, so I rolled them into 18 small meatballs. I placed them on a foil-lined sheet and baked @ 350 deg F for 25 min. (I had plans to broil a bit, but they browned up nicely just baking them.) I made a little of the garlic sauce mentioned by the top reviewer, and it was excellent with these! I get the gamey taste of lamb, so I'm going to try with beef, as others have mentioned, the next time. Great recipe - thanks!

The spice combination is really authentic! I make it without the skewers and the lamb doesn't fall apart. Great with side of tabbouli, cous cous, and some mint yogurt.

My husband and I recently started eating a healthier low carb, higher protein diet.   After several weeks, our taste buds were beginning to get bored, so I decided to try a savory protein based dish.

This was delicious and hubby hasn't stopped raving about tonight's wonderful dinner.

I omitted the cayenne pepper since we both suffer from acid reflux and super spicy foods aggravate the condition.

Will definitely be making this again soon!

I love lebanese food but my husband always said that he did not care for ethnic foods. I made this recipe into meat balls but did not tell him that it was a lebanese recipe until he said that he really love these meat balls. The kicker is that he wants me to make them again

A very good blend of spices. I had to alter the recipe a bit due to cupboard restrictions but it came out nice nevertheless. Maybe I wouldn't go so heavy on the cumin next time but that's a personal preference as it's a flavour I'm not particularly fond of.

So freakin good!! I used a combination of ground turkey and beef in place of the lamb. There is no way you can screw these up. Thanks for the yummy recipes!

Made as instructed, except skipped skewers, just flattened approx 25 meatballs and put on the George foreman. As someone who raises lambs, but was not raised on lamb meat, I can truly appreciate this recipe. They're like delicious mini sliders, great over a bed of rice. And mostly a lovely alternative to my go to of browning, draining, and dumping a packet of taco mix over my ground lamb meat.

Have made this 3 times as written. So simple and easy. make them a few hours in advance if you can and refrigerate to let flavors marry. not necessary, though. As good as any ive eaten in restaraunts. Grilling them is the only way ive done it. doubt broiling would be as good. make a tzaziki style yogurt sauce if you like!

These were so delicious, even picky T liked them!  A&E not so much.  They were perfect with the sauce Chuck  Wesserling mentioned.  I skipped the cayenne  (didn't have), used 1T dried parsley (didn't have fresh), and micro-planed the onion. DH grilled them to 155°. They tasted just like a Greek restaurant's! 1 lb was good for us.  Next time try with ground turkey?

I will make this again very soon!  My only slight change was to use 6  (12 inch long) skewers and put two meatballs on each for a total of 12 slightly sausage shaped pieces. They were so delicious and fragrant!  My husband cooked them on the barbecue and they were slightly crispy on the outside and moist inside and did not fall apart at all. Served with tzatziki sauce and white rice because I didn't have any pita on hand.

We loved this! My husband is still talking about it this morning. I did make a change, and used a good quality curry powder rather than fussing around measuring out the coriander, cumin, cinnamon, allspice and ginger. Those ingredients are already in a good curry powder. Very easy recipe, and really delish!!

Excellent! I used dried parsley instead of fresh, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. I did pop the meatballs in the freezer for 40 minutes.... This firmed them up enough to get them on the skewers and to grill them without them falling apart. I made these to go with the Mediterranean Orzo Spinach Salad....fabulous!!!

This is a brilliant recipe.  I thought the spice quantity seemed slightly exaggerated, but the result was awesome.  This spice blend is one that everyone can fine-tune to their own taste (less cinnamon for me).  Fantastic on the grill.

Delicious!  I used ground beef instead of ground lamb and the result was still great.  The coriander was a little strong, so I'll cut that back to 2 tsp  instead of 1 tblsp next time.

Perfect but skip the cinnamon, I like cinnamon on sweets only not in meats. I used it on beef also. I added fresh cut thyme instead of the cinnamon, jut a bit not too much.

I've made this now twice. The first time, identical to the recipe, and it was delicious. I thought it had just the correct amount of spices, including cinnamon.
The second time, I decided I wanted more, so I combined 1 lb ground lamb with 1 pound hamburger. I had run out of parsley (can you believe that?) so I subbed mint leaves because thats all I had on hand (for me, mint is a typical greek sub). It still was excellent, but of course I now had more skewers or delectable meat!
I served with tzaziki sauce, olives, feta, and authentic pita bread. This is totally a keeper - can't wait for our 4th of July bbq so I can show this dish off!

PS - For those that didn't like the cinnamon in it, I noticed most either used just beef, or beef and pork combo, or turkey - my thought is that is why it tasted too cinnamon-y. The cinnamon helps with the gaminess of the lamb, lamb is strong flavored for sure! I used 85% lean lamb, and 85% lean beef - you need a little fat - or else it will be dry and yucky - no wonder there were some poor reviews!! If you overcook the lamb, same thing, dry and yucky. I would never cook any lamb or lamb combo in the oven just for that reason.

I was hesitant to make this with all of the listed spices, but I stuck with it because I was looking for something to make with ground lamb, other than my usual lamb burgers. I'm so glad I tried this recipe! I followed the recipe and made tzatziki, along with a Greek salad and cauliflower rice. So amazing! I'm making it again this week, only I'm doubling the recipe and I'll throw half of the koftas in the freezer for future workday lunches and last minute dinners. These are something I'd like to keep the freezer stocked with at all times.

I used 2lb lamb + 2 lbs beef to make these kofta kebabs.  The taste was phenomenal...however, instead of fresh parsley, I used fresh cilantro as that is what I had handy.  Additionally, I added a few tablespoons of fresh mint.  While grilling, I seared them on each side on high heat and then turned the temp to low in order to keep them moist.  Definitely recommend.

I made this with ground beef. The seasonings create an excellent flavor. The suggestion to put 28 pieces on 28 skewers is kinda silly, not to mention completely unmanageable on the grill. We ended up putting several on each skewer for grilling. Next time I think I will try making them into meatballs and baking.

Very tasty. We loved it! 

I used Oregon grass fed lean hamburger and added an egg.  With those two exceptions I followed the recipe. The flavor reminded us of Sticks Kebob Shop in Charlottesville, VA.  Both, highly recommend. 

A little tip:  while you have all the dry spices out, make up an extra spice pack or two for future meals. I'm going to send a couple to my kids to try.

Well- I used beef and I doubled this recipe. It was a bit spicy for my taste. Too much cinnamon according to my family. But it was good with tzatziki sauce and lettuce, tomato on flat bread. I made jasmine rice on the side (and added tumeric to it for a more middle eastern flair.)

I have been trying to find the right recipe to match some of the middle eastern and turkish restaurants that make this. This was actually spicier than the restaurants I go too. If I made this again, I would cut the garlic, cumin and cinnamon in half.  It was good though. Definitely tasted like restaurant style middle eastern fare.

Following this recipe to a T, the lamb was delicious. Skip the skewers! You won't need 28 of them, and you can make meatballs instead, like I did. 1lb of ground lamb yielded something like 12 meatballs for us. I baked them at 350 for 20min like another reviewer suggested. I thought it might not be long enough, but they were perfect. Lamb isn’t super fatty, so I did not use a baking rack in my glass dish when I baked these.
The spice blend is just perfect. I would not change a thing. I have not been able to take the gamey lamb taste, but using this recipe I finally can enjoy lamb!

This was a hit with my family, and especially my husband. Even though I left out some ingredients because I didn't have them, it turned out really good. I didn't use coriander or allspice, and instead of grated onion I used onion powder, dried parsley for fresh, and ground beef instead of lamb. I made six medium patties instead of the skewers, and I heated them in a pan for a few minutes to get a nice brown on the outside then finished them off in the oven at 350 degrees for 15-20 minutes. Served it with jasmine rice (probably better with basmati) and a Greek salad (mixed greens, cucumber, feta and a yogurt dressing) and also Chuck Wesserling's recipe for traditional garlic sauce. Delicious! We all ate it up with no leftovers!

It was really good. The only thing I would change is maybe no cinnamon, but even with it i still loved it.

Excellent! Slight change...didn't have ground coriander to crushed some coriander seeds in the motar and pestle. Also, didn't have fresh parsley so used dry parsley.

I used half beef and half lamb but other wise followed the recipe exactly. Except I made 9 ovals that I cooked on my grill pan for about 7 minutes per side, and also did 7 "tube-shaped" ones on skewers and grilled them on my infrared barbecue for about 9 minutes, turning every 3 or so. I will probably do this again my way because neither cooking method accommodates as many servings as I wanted, but both turned out delicious! I had them in pita bread with tzatziki, onions, tomatoes, and greens and absolutely loved it. The only reason I didn't give the recipe 5 stars is that it took awhile to put together with all that grating and slicing and measuring, but because of the flavor I will definitely make these again!

My husband and I both enjoyed this. I did cut the cinnamon from 1/2 tablespoon to 1/2 teaspoon thought it may have been a typo. Made 4 patties instead of placing them on skewers.

This was delicious!!! I used turkey because it is what I had.  I love lamb and can't wait to try this with it.  The spices were a great mix.  I didn't have the coriander so I used cilantro.  The spices allowed for very little salting.    As a side I made a rice dish with sauteed onion,spinach, red peppers and Hungarian peppers along with light use of the spices in the meat mixture.  So very tasty will do this again.

Mixed reviews: sis loved it, hubbs...not as much. I made little patties and browned them in olive oil first, then baked at 350 to finish. Flavor was good, but will probably either skip browning first or only pan-fry. Served with rice, tzatziki sauce (also from here), and store-bought hummus with pita bread. There are some changes I will make next time, but it was a good change of pace.

The blend of spices was just right but I reeked of garlic for days so I'd probably reduce that by a clove or two. The lamb didn't go as far as I would have liked; I would have preferred to have made larger sausage-shaped koftas but I wouldn't have had enough to go round, so instead made smaller meatball shaped koftas. Next time I shall use slightly more meat. I also think it could have done with a chopped red chilli.
I served the koftas with a greek salad, tzatsiki and home made Turkish flatbreads (recipe can be found on this website - very nice). These would also go well with some spicy / savoury rice.
I will definitely use the recipe again as it went down really well with the family.

I made a few changes. Beef instead of lamb (cheaper). Baked instead of grilled. 12 instead of 28 (3 per serving). I baked them for 20 minutes at 350 as someone had suggested but mine were a little overdone. Next time I'll try 15 minutes. I served with zucchini and tomatoes from my garden. These were delicious. All the spices made just the right flavor.

The spice ratio was excellent.  Like others mentioned, I was worried about the amount of cinnamon because the smell of it was so strong, but it works in this recipe very well.  We made lamb burgers and not kebabs out of it, but it was delicious regardless.

This was very good. I used ground chuck and doubled te recipe.  I kept the measurements in proportion but just heaped them and didn't level them off. I'm glad I did. This has a nice flavor that was well balanced.  Served in pita with cucumber yogurt sauce.

Delicious blend of spices in this dish.  As another reviewer mentioned, no need for 28 skewers, I used 6.  I served it with a tahini sauce, grilled pita, a Greek salad, and a bottle of Syrah.  Outstanding recipe, thanks!

I tried this recipe and found it addictively delicious. I did find it a little salty and will cut that back a little, as well as the cinnamon, nextime. I skipped the kebab skewers and opted for a stove top skillet. Forming them into sausage sized links that I flattened a bit in the pan. I served them in flour taco shells with tzatsiki and lettuce and tomatoes.  I literally ate half of the batch myself. Don't miss this one.

This recipe was fantastic! Cooked inside, under the grill rack in oven, so still had the grill marks. I added a diced red chilli to the paste - I also saved some of the paste, mixed it with plain greek yogurt, and used it both as a baste during grilling, and as a drizzle sauce on the finished plate.
Served with a greek salad with fetta cheese, and it was a perfect meal!

I just made this, but changed it, so I don't think it is ok to give it a bad rating when I did not follow directions. It doesn't need a bad rating anyway. I used turkey because that is what I had. And I have no grill so I added a tiny amount or liquid smoke and cooked them under the broiler. The only complaint I have is that it was really hard to keep them on the sticks. Maybe because I added a few grams of liquid? anyway, even with those changes it tastes great.

This recipe was absolutely fantastic!  I wanted to double it and didn't have 2 lbs of ground lamb, so I substituted a lb of lean ground beef.  Yum!!! Highly recommended.  The kids raved about it as well.

This was a very good recipe, my family loved it. They even went as far as suggesting that I sell it in a food tent at our local farmers market. Here's the changes I made. I doubled the recipe and used a pound of lamb and a pound of higher quality ground beef. I also added a doubling of the spice mixture to a gallon sized ziplock bag add a ½ cup of water to create a marinade to which I added two pounds of chicken breast. If possible purchase thinly sliced chicken breast or ask the butcher counter to slice it for you. Let the chicken marinade for a minimum of 24 to 48 hours. I also used wood charcoal when I grilled everything it helps add a smokiness to the flavor of the meat.

These were delicious!  I made them into meatballs and baked them at 350 for 30 minutes, then 350 convection for 10 more minutes.  They smelled so delicious while baking!  Served with homemade Tzatziki sauce, rice, & broccoli.  Use lamb like the recipe says, not beef, for authentic flavor.

I used half and half ground regular and lean beef. I formed the mixture to 24 balls (golf ball size); rolled them to oval shape on a plate with vegetable oil (this way the meat did't get dry); and refrigerated them. I place the balls on flat skewers ( 5 pieces per skewer) right before grilling. This recipe is pretty easy for a beginer like me as most of the ingredients are ground.

I make it with ground venison some time. We pulled the kabob off with flatbread and load it up with tzatziki and tomatoes and cucumber. My 9 yr old love to make this so it has become a summer staple for us.

Had my first chance to grill outdoors this 80 degree spring day in May.
My wife wanted burgers, but the warm air brought back memories of a trip I took to Israel. My regular american diet became much broader with the addition of many of the Middle Eastern dishes I experienced while there. 
I was invited to a cookout at an Arab families home, but there were no burgers, hot dogs, or ribs on the grill but lots of Kebabs!
This recipe turned out some delicious, savory meat kebabs like the ones I ate there.
If you have none of the ingredients you could end up spending 40 or 50 dollars for this meal. I had most spices. I only lacked coriander & allspice. The allspice was 3.00 and coriander was 7.00, add 8.00 for the lamb and a buck for some fresh parsley. I actually saved some money by not buying the coriander but found a spice blend that closely matched the recipe for $3.98,(Ras El Hanout).
 Not only did my wife and I eat our fill, with salad and rice on the side, I shared a half dozen kebabs with my neighbor.
 I have no aversion to lamb being of Scottish heritage on my father's side, but the piece of lamb I bought was just over 3/4 of a lb. so I added a half lb of ground chuck to stretch it.
My wife also wanted some grilled pineapple which I added to a few of the kebabs. The picture is of the leftovers I reheated on the grill. 
A note on the kebabs I had in Israel: The kababs were formed around a metal skewer in a sausage shape and then removed from the skewer to grill them.

Delicious! Very simple way to prepare lamb. The smell of the spices was fabulous and the taste was equally as good. Served with flat bread, yogurt, tomatoes, lettuce, cukes, and onions. Will be making again and again definitely!

I made a derivative version and there's no turning back. I ground up the spice mix with everything except the lamb, and caked it all over bone-in racks of pork ribs. After marinating overnight, it baked for 45 minutes in the oven at 400F. Absolutely DELICIOUS! I find it takes a double-batch of this mix to properly coat 1 large rack of pork back ribs.

My family loved this recipe. We have small children so we omitted the cayenne. Still delicious! I think this recipe will become a staple in our home. We have made it with beef as well and it was still a hit!

I made this as is and my four year-old daughter declared, "This is my favourite meal ever!"  I served it with Lebanese garlic sauce, tzatziki, tahini, and homemade flatbread.  So good!  Thanks for a great recipe!

This recipe made eight skewers and each one was devoured by my appreciative family.  Even my 13 year old son really liked it and he hates meatballs, meatloaf and salisbury steak with equal fervor.  Most ground beef foods really gross him out.  I served these on garlic naan with a mince of cucumbers, cherry tomatoes, arugula, parsley and mint.  I didn't have yogurt to make a tzatziki sauce, so I made do with a lemon-garlic-tahini sauce and they were so tasty that I'm going to get the ingredients to make these again and try freezing them.  Like others, I put these in the oven and they were done in 12 minutes.  So easy!  Thanks for the lovely recipe.

I made this using ground buffalo and it was awesome!  Buffalo is much leaner also. I do plan on trying it with the lamb too, as the spice mix made me think I was back in Istanbul :)

I have made these for years.  So did my grandmother.  They are fantastic.  Your "title" calls them kebabs.  Kebab is a middle-eastern word that means meat.  NOT little round meat things on a skewer... the term Shish Kebab means skewered meat.  I wish all the recipe/cooking giants would get the real meaning of kebab.

Loved it! Took larryK's advice and baked at 350 for 25 minutes and used the sauce from chuck weaseling, juice of 1 lemon, 1/4 C olive oil, 4 cloves of garlic and 1/4 tsp salt in vitamin. Heaven!

FABULOUS! a must with ground lamb... we actually pan fried them first in long hot dog shapes as we didn't have skewers then baked for approx. 20 min and they were amazing.  Great level of spice with the lamb... will be making this for guests soon.

I had the pleasure to have these kabobs the last two weeks on three separate occasions with some new friends visiting from Saudi, Arabia. They are amazing, cayenne to taste of course, but the Saudi's make them mild and slow barbecue them over a small charcoal barbecue (it is better). I used my gas s/s barbecue and they were still great.

I used regular ground beef(as recommended by my new friends). I soaked the skewers and then formed the meat mixture around the skewer for the whole length as I had seen them do. 

You won't be disappointed and like all good cooks, mix your seasonings around to your preference. This recipe is a great starting point!

Pretty good, but I made a few changes that improved this recipe a lot. I substituted the lamb for ground beef, and cooked it in a pan with cilantro, chili powder, and cumin. Then I served it in corn tortillas with lettuce, tomatoes, cheddar cheese and sour cream. It was excellent this way.

I LOVED this recipe! At first I was sceptic about some spices but oh man, it was heavenly! Made it the first time last summer, followed recipe to a T, came out perfect (I broiled it).  My good friend loved it and wanted to make a lot, to freeze some, so she bought 6lbs of ground beef and made it. This time, due to different quantity, it was kinda dry and not as flavorful as the first time. So we're going to make it according to this recipe and not to increase quantity. I also made some tzakiki to go with this kebab. What a wonderful dinner we had! Going to make this again in a couple weeks for an old friend's mother (who's an Armenian) that would love to have some. Can't wait to make it and eat some! Whoo hoo!! Thanks for this recipe!!

Really good recipe. We love lamb, being from the UK and so substituted nothing. A great tasting Kebab.  Not so sure about the 28 skewers, I got about 15 and pretty small, but big enough.  Had them with lamb steak(sliced leg, I think) roast potatoes, tzatziki, but should have had pita also. Definitely a repeatable menu.

This recipe is extremely tasty. I followed all the recipe's ingredients exactly. It was excellent and authentic!!! Very flavorful. I baked the balls at 350 for 20 minutes. The only thing I would do differently is mince the garlic more finely and perhaps cut back on the garlic. This recipe made 10 small balls. Delicious!

Amazing, amazing recipe! my hubby loves koftka at our nearby lebanese restaurant so this will be a keeper!!
i did the recipe to a T and it came out terrific! i served with 2 dipping sauces, tahini for me and tzatziki for the hubbs. 
as were staying away from carbs, we didnt use pita, but that would have been the dish of the tasebud heaven. 

only thing i would change, is the place by our house serves it in a sausage type on a skewer. next time i would arrange it like so on the skewer, as the balls were hard to flip on the grill and that way it cooks all the way.
besides that, it was terrific!! thank you SO much we no longer have to spend  $15+/entree to get our favored koftka

This is fabulous. Best made on the grill served in  pitas warmed on the grill. Added arugula, tomatoes, feta cheese, and the garlic sauce suggested by a reviewer. I used 90% lean beef but would like to try 85% for juicier results next time.

Our entire family loves these. So much flavor!  I cut the cayenne in half for my children. I have used turkey and beef and loved them both.

I used turkey (on purpose) and cilantro instead of parsley and no allspice (out of both), and these were still delicious.   I didn't use the skewers, just shaped them in to small patties.  My family loved them, including the kids.  They were great in pitas with hummus, tzatziki, tomatoes, cucumbers, etc.

Delicious! Just as I remembered it from this great Mediterranean restaurant in town! I marinated overnight and then baked them for 350 for 25 mins. They were juicy and tender. I also used 1/2 beef 1/2 pork. Fabulous!

Goat meat friendly!  Bake at 350 degrees on center rack for 25 minutes.
