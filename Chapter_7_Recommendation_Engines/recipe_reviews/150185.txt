I really love this dressing. I use it on a mixed green salad with mandarin oranges, sliced strawberries, and red onions. I recently made this for a PTA luncheon with grilled chicken and it was a huge hit. I always make it with the "olive oil mayo" and "real" maple syrup, I was asked for the recipe at least 20 times.

I'm sorry, this just tasted like PURE mayo to me! I was so excited and even added the red food coloring to make it pink.  When I tasted it- I gagged! I just kept adding more maple syrup, sugar,and vinegar but I couldn't cover up the mayo taste!! I made my husband taste it before I brought it to a party and he said to leave it home!! Sorry- not for us.

Wow, this dressing is incredible. I too used fat free mayonnaise and splenda in place of sugar. Served with fresh baby green salad. A new staple in my fridge!

Trying to Duplicate a Local Restaurants Maple Poppyseed Dressing. It is a Staple for them. Popular served with Chicken Fingers and Sweet Potato Fries!!! Try it! You'll never eat them again without Maple Poppyseed Dip/Dressing! 
I did Double the Maple Syrup and also Doubled the Red Wine Vinegar. Also added 2 teaspoons of Dijon Mustard!! Added more Maple taste and a bit of a tang to the back of your pallet. Awesome!!

This is a really lovely dressing.  My husband raved about it.  Will definitely make this a regular in our house.
