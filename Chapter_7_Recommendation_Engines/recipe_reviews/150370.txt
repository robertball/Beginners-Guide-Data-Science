I am so sorry, but this recipe didn't even deserve one star, but it's making me use at least one.

 I have never written a poor review before and I'm not really sure what to say.  First off, I made it EXACTLY as written; no adjustments.  It not only lacks flavor, but when the cheese melted, the entire thing seperated and looks just terrible.  Don't even get me started on what my house smells like right now!  All in all, this recipe is in need of an overhaul.  I'm so sorry...
