awesome, but used fresh lemon juice and Ketel One Citroen to make this drink a true 5 star rated libation.  Ketel is so much fresher tasting than Absolut Citron, it's not even funny. And it really makes a diff in this drink!

At first read I thought this would be sour because of all the lime juice.  It turned out to be a refreshing surprise. The only modification I made was to substitute .5 oz. of limoncello mixed with 1 oz. of Skyy Vodka to simulate citron vodka.  Unlike many martinis which tend to be heavy with alcohol, this was a light, thirst-quenching martini one could enjoy on a hot day.

I'm a bit of a weakling and increased the sweet and sour to a full 1/4 cup. I also added some sugar to the mix to sweeten it a little. Ciroc is my favorite so I used that and added some fresh lemon juice. Delicious!

This was my first martini to make and I served it at a recent party.  My guests loved it and by the end of the night I was serving it to everyone, I ran out of vodka.  Delicious and easy, will make again and again.

very tart but amazing. The sugar rim can make it or break it sometimes. without it, it can be too sour.

I only had lime vodka so this turned out as more of a lime-drop martini...and I loved it!  Tried it a second time using lemon juice instead of lime (with the lime vodka) in order to keep the lemon-lime taste--this was also very good (but I liked the all lime one a little better).

Very, VERY good. I've had this drink when I've been out but it's nice to enjoy it at home. Now I know how to make it. I think this is better than any other I've had before.

This is wonderful!  It reminds me of the Lemon Drop Martini I got on our last cruise - except that one was $9.95 plus tip :)  Thanks for sharing this!

To make this even better, skip the sweet and sour mix but add: 
half ounce lemon juice 
half ounce orange juice 
half ounce of Lemocello. 

 And if you were to substitute tequilla for vodka and add a splash of orange liqueur you would have what I call a - Mayan Martini - do to the large amount of Italians (lemoncello factor) residing in the Yucatan penninsula.

Questions: why would you use lime juice in a lemon drink? What is vodka citron and what brand sells it? And wouldn't you wanna rub the lemon zest strip around the rim and dip the rim in granulated sugar before putting the zest strip in the glass and pouring the drink?

made it according to the recipe, it's was very good.  then I made it with Absolut Citron and added a dash of lemoncello.  even better.  it seems to be especially liked by the women (not sexist just observing).
I will make it again and again.

This was fabulous.   Used good grey goose Citron vodka adding a bit more as I made enough for 3 glasses.  Added fresh squeezed lime juice.   Tasted so good but 1 was enough.   Will absolutely make again....

Very good, simple cocktail. Ingredients are typically on hand. We only had three meyer lemons which are very juicy, but ours was more like a lemonade (which we found preferable).

Really liked it! Yummy and refereshing. Next time I will use the previously suggested lemon juice, instead of the lime juice. Also, I used Smirnoff Citron, but may try a higher quality vodka next time, just as an experiment.

Great! I followed Cowboy Phil's advice to make a Key Lime Pie Martini - substitute Nellie and Joe's Key Lime juice for regular, substitute whipped cream vodka for citrus vodka. I added a half tablespoon sweetened condensed milk. Delicious! Thanks for sharing!
