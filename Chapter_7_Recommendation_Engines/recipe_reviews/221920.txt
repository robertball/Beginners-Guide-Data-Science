I wasn't at all very impressed with this sushi. The vinegar was just too much just to make a simple roll. If anyone makes this, I'm sure you only need about 1/6 of a cup, because the rice was straight up pink and vinegary. Left a very sour taste, even with soy sauce.

Epic fail. Do not use this recipe. All the vinegar will not allow the rice to stick and roll.

I didn't care for the red wine vinegar in this. I ended up trying the recipe again using Chef John's recipe for sushi rice but followed the recipe for assembly. I ran out of nori so I used rice paper wrappers. I gave each sushi roll a tumble around black sesame seeds before cutting.  The flavor changes considerably but the fun is still there.
