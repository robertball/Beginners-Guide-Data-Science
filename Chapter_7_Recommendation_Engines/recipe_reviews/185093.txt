This was my first time cooking collard greens and I was looking for something non-traditional; and by that, I mean "southern-style." This was really tasty! Some changes I made, I didn't have quite a pound of collard greens (only 11 oz), and I used a whole onion and a lot of pre-minced garlic. I followed the rest of the spicy exactly. I felt that it was a little too gingery for my liking and if I make it again, I will half the ginger. It overpowered all the other flavors. I would probably also toss out half of the reserved water next time; I cooked for the said amount of time but it was still quite watery and I am rather impatient. It was still quite good though! I also only divided this whole dish between two people and served with a tilapia fillet. I was surprised to see that all of the ingredients were key players in detoxification so that's a plus!

This recipe was amazing, way better than I imagined it would be, but there are some minor alterations I would like to add. First off, when chopping the collards, remove the hard stem.  What I did was sort of cut an elongated V shape up the center of the leaf to remove the most of the hard stem and rib together.  Also, I dumped all of the collards and the water into a large bowl, and used the same vessel the collards had been in to cook the onion.  When ready I poured the collards, water and all, back into the onion mixture.  This saved some time and energy.

For my very first encounter with collard greens, I will say it was delicious! I used ground ginger, because I did not have any fresh ginger handy. 
I didn't understand why the greens needed to be drained and liquid reserved if it all goes back into the pot, so while the collards were simmering, i cooked the onions in a separate pan and when it was time i just added the onions+garlic to the pot with the greens and continued on from there.

I made this exactly as the recipe called for and it was surprisingly delicious and to my utter astonishment, my very picky nine year old gobbled it down and asked for seconds.  My whole family loves this recipe and now I have a recipe for all those collard greens I planted this year.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

My ethipian born children thank you for this wonderful and closely authentic recipe!  I use chicken broth for the liquid and found frozen chopped collards in my local grocery to cut the time down!

After boiling the greens and draining them (saving the liquid for sure!), I used a cast iron skillet for the final steps. Green pepper needs to be sliced fairly thin. This was aromatic, just spicy enough, colorful and delicious!

This recipe was delicious and healthy, though it didn't quite have the flavor that I expected. I added more ginger root and some hot sauce, and omitted the salt, and it was perfect. YUM!

This is fantastic.  I am going to make more tomorrow! My gold standard (until now) for collards was southern style - cooked in pork back.  Move over Paula Dean, Gomen Wat is my new favorite way to prepare collards! I did have to make a couple changes: I used ginger paste (shame, shame, I know), jar garlic (8 cloves is a lot to mince, sister), and store bought lemon juice.  I did put a pinch of salt in the water to boil the collards and I doubled the tumeric and allspice. This dish is perfectly balanced.  In my experience with Ethiopian cooking (limited), I have found the flavors are even better the next day. I've made this dish a few hours ahead of dinner time so it can develop a little .

Wow, really surprisingly good! I sort of reversed the steps. I sauted the onion, garlic and ginger first, added the spices and green pepper, then the collards, then just enough water to cook them and simmered for about 20 min. The result was great, much better than I expected!

Trying to learn to eat the South Beach way, I thought I'd try this healthy version of collards. AWESOME! I wasn't sure about this combo of seasonings, so I started with a little less than what was called for on the allspice, ginger and tumeric and then seasoned to my taste. A little cayenne pepper finished it off.  Don't forget the lemon juice--it's essential. The dish is very pleasing to the eye as well. I can't wait to make it again and show it off to my friends.  I'm eating this whole skillet myself!

Wonderful recipe, thank you! I love collards and this was a wonderful new flavor for them! Ok, the dreaded changes and substitutions…I used more liquid, water and a heafty addition of what I call “refrigerator stock.” I take whatever leftover juices (within reason for a Cajun) and keep up my supply in the fridge.  Some of the extra liquid from the greens actually went back into the jar. I added onions and garlic to the greens as it cooked. I then added much more garlic and onions and omitted the bell pepper ( none on hand). I added a lot more of the spices as others recommended and added a large dollop of cayenne pepper. So good, but the next day it even better so make extra!

Yum! I grew up in the Southern U.S. and really only knew one way to cook collards (with meat). This vegetarian dish is delicious! I weighed my collards and after cooking them down, it seemed like I could have used double the amount in this dish without sacrificing flavor. The flavor is the real bonus of this dish! I was looking for a vegetarian collard dish that would be flavorful and this is perfect!

My only suggestion is to cut down on the reserved liquid you add. It took me about 20 minutes to cook down the water and I added about 2/3 of my liquid.

I really enjoyed this recipe - I used red peppers instead of green and skipped the onions (didn't have any on hand) and it still came out very good. For those watching salt intake, you can decrease the amount of salt and it will still be good. thank you for posting!

Very flavorful! Few changes. Use picsweet frozen turnip green or collards and doubled the onion(we are onion heads) I am from the south so if looking for southern greens look somewhere else!

Really good instructions, and the result turned out flavorful!  It is important to remove the stems of the collards and boil in water first.  Served this on top of injera with other Ethiopian foods for a complete meal!

I really liked it - just happened to have already cooked collards(last of my garden crop cooked yesterday) with liquor(the juice ) which made it really simple! It was 'funky' as one reviewer noted - very different from American tastes! in a good way for me.  I put it over a baked potatoe with plain yoghurt topping - yum!(don't eat much meat) I will make this diff recipe for collards again.  Perhaps will try to make injera - the flatbread Ethiopians eat it with(instead of forks!) or just use pita!

Made it without any changes. Excellent flavors and a nice change from traditional greens. I just drained off the excess liquid before storing the leftovers and saved it for a soup base.

This is a great recipe! I used orange and yellow green bell peppers to add color (definitely cut into thin slice!) and increased the oil to what is typically used... 1/3 cup. I also added 1/2 tbsp of lemon pepper. I would highly recommend this recipe!

I followed the recipe to a tee, but did NOT care for the end result at all. It was way too gingery and the spice combination tasted a little off. It's too bad; I really enjoy the gomen wat at my favourite local Ethiopian restaurant.

I should start by saying that I have never had/prepared collard greens, but I do like spinach, kale, etc.  Also, I love Ethiopian food.  Following the recipe I still didn't have really soft greens, I had to increase the cooking times throughout.  I really like the flavor of the spices, but just not with the greens.  I might actually try the spice combo on some chicken : )

Well, I guess I just don't like collards.  I really tried, with them being so healthy.  Perhaps if you like the slightly bitter taste of collards, you'll like these.

I thought this was awesome.  A nice new way for me to make collard greens.  I'll make this again and will pick up some of the sour spongy bread at an Ethiopian market to eat with it.  YUM!  It reminded me of a meal I had in not Ethiopia, but in Tanzania, because of all the great spices!

This was too lemony and too gingery for us. It was very very bright. The only alteration I made was leaving out the green pepper, as I didn't have any. I don't think that would have altered it enough to be palatable for my family. However, the method was interesting and useful, and I will be able to change up the flavorings to make something that our poor american taste buds can handle. :)  Just to try to tone down the acid/brightness, I tried drizzling a little honey on the collards. It wasn't enough. So we won't make this specific combination of flavors again, but we will use the method.  The lemon, ginger, and slight bitterness of the reduced cooking water was really what overpowered it for us. We're new to collards, though, so it was definitely worth a shot. We will try something a little more traditional southern next time, I think. Or perhaps tone down the ginger and leave out the lemon.  It definitely gave an interesting flavor twist to collards, it was just a bit overpowering for us.

I added poblano peppers and extra onions. This was so delicious. I love this dish. And, I have made it since. Still a great dish.

I didn’t have quite enough collards, so I used a mixture of collard greens and spinach. Delicious over rice!

This was a big hit! I love Ethiopian food, but have never had this particular dish at a restaurant. In fact, this was my first experience with collard greens. I did simplify things a bit by using frozen chopped collard greens and a whole onion and whole bell pepper instead of measuring the exact amounts. Used a red bell pepper because that’s what I had on hand. I only had 6 cloves of garlic, but will make sure to use 8 next time. I also used only about 1-1 1/2 tablespoons of ginger which I thought was plenty, and I added 1/2 teaspoon of cayenne to the spices for a bit of heat. I followed other reviewers suggestions and sautéed the onion first, then added the garlic, ginger, bell pepper, spices and second tablespoon of olive oil for one minute. I then poured 2 cups of unsalted vegetable stock (instead of water) in the same pan and added the frozen collard greens and a pinch of salt. I brought the whole thing to a boil and then reduced the heat to a simmer, cooking until the liquid was mostly evaporated. By that point the greens were tender. Finished with the lemon juice. Next time I will likely increase the spices, but that’s just personal preference. This is an excellent and extremely healthy dish that I will definitely be making again.

Very few changes: I cooked the collards in vegetable broth, not water. I used bottled lemon juice as it as all I had, and used orange bell peppers because I don't like green bell pepper. Then I added an earthy hot sauce at the end (The Last Dab Reduxx with Pepper X and Chocolate Pepper X). This was literally the BEST way I've ever had greens in my life, and I like greens! From now on, whenever I have collards, I will go to this recipe.

The second time I made this, I was out of a lot of stuff. I cooked the collards in water with about a tsp of miso paste dissolved in it, as I was out of vegetable broth. I used vegetable oil for frying the onions and coconut oil for the added oil later on, because I was out of olive oil. I also had a little less allspice than called for, closer to 1/4 tsp. I was completely out of bell peppers, so I didn't use any and didn't replace them with anything. I added a little more minced ginger root than called for, since I had plenty. I again added a bit of the earthy hot sauce at the end. Even with all these omissions, it was still delicious!

What a wonderful recipe. Thanks!

The peppers made this dish especially bitter and for all the ingredients to make it interesting, we didn't like it at all.  We will continue to boil greens in salted water with a little olive oil.  This brings out the hearty taste of the greens and makes it versatile to go with many foods.

I am a huge fan of etheopean food and have eaten this dish in restaurants. For me this recipe was just ok. It was a little blan and not quite on the mark. I even added some etheopean spiced butter to it to make it more rich and flavorful and a dash of berbere mix.  I served it with injera home made kifto and we enjoyed the meal, largeley because kifto is usually so spicy it carries most of the flavor. I dont think that I would make this as a stand-alone side though.

Loved it! Tasted just like we get at our favorite Ethiopian restaurant. Thanks for a great recipe!
