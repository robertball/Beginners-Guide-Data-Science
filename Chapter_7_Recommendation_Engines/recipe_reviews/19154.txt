These were FANTASTICALLY EASY!! I'm the Queen of Short Cuts so here's my take- I made them according to the directions, but added about 1/4 t. of Mexican vanilla to the Marshmallows while melting in the butter. (QUICK NOTE* 1/2 CU OF UNPOPPED POPCORN = about 4 QTS POPPED CORN). I had to use microwave popcorn, and that little fact was not printed out on the bags.  I used LITE BUTTER FLAVOR. PICK OUT THE UNPOPPED KERNELS NEXT! I poured the popped popcorn into a large lightly sprayed (with Pam) pot to mix with the melted marshmallow mixutre. MUCHO EASIER to stir together in a deep pot then in the cake pan with low sides! After mixing well I dumped that into a lightly Pam sprayed 13x9 cake pan. I laid a sheet of wax paper over the pan, and gently tapped the mixture out (but not too tight or it squishes the fluff out of it).  I squished a Hershey's Kiss into the center of a few to see how it held. It stuck well, and looked great.  Then, I cooled it for about 30 min, and cut into 25 squares so instead of 8 whompin' sized popcorn balls it produced enough to feed at least 20 hungry goblins..lol. 

I've since added M&Ms to them when stirring it all up,and they were also inhaled!

Yes, I dirtied a second pan, but it was far easier to wash the second pot then try to stir that huge mixture in such a small pan with 2" sides.

This may seem weird, but add a small box of flavored jello to the marshmallow mix.  My mother used to make them that way when I was a kid.  I loved loved loved them.  You can also add 1/2 cup brown sugar to the marshmallow and butter mix.  That way it tastes a bit like caramel popcorn.

My family made this all of the time growing up. For a little more of a chewey caramel flavor, we would melt together 2 cubes of butter and 2 cups of brown sugar to an almost carmelized point before adding in 2 cups of marshmallows and the popcorn (more or less depending on how gooey you like it)
We also would add red hots, spice drops, candy canes, nuts, tiny jelly beans, etc, depending on the season and give them as quick gifts.

If you like more caramel taste... I used 4 cups marsh. 1 cup caramel bits 1 teas. vanilla and these are more caramel less rice krispie like. Very good. They set up perfect. I have made these both ways  and both are very good it just depends on taste.

These are soooo yummy, and way easier than traditional popcorn balls.  It's even easier if you use microwave popcorn - I used 2 bags of Kettle Corn, which made them nice and sweet.  My classmates loved them!

I didn't have time to make this recipe into balls so I just pressed it down into the pan and cut it into squares!  I also added salted peanuts to it which my kids (and husband) loved!    :)

I originally was looking for a simple popcorn coating for a quick midnight snack, but I came across this recipe and since I had the marshmallows on hand, I thought, "why not?"  I'm glad that I did.  This was very simple to make (took less than 3 minutes!), and the results are fantastic.  I deviated a bit from the normal instructions and used an air popper (much more healthy, IMHO).  I also decreased the marshmallows a bit - if I had made this using the standard recipe, the balls would have turned out way too sweet for my indvidual taste. The kids will probably enjoy this as well (I have no children, so I can't say for sure...).  Thanks for sharing, Kory.  Everyone should give this a try!

These were so easy to make! My 4 yr. old helped me and we added some orange coloring and chocolate sprinkles for Halloween. I used a bag of microwave popcorn and it seemed like there was too much marshmellow mix. Next time it will cut back on that.

These were so yummy! I don't particularly like hard caramel corn, and this had a soft, chewy texture even after cooling. I did add about 1/2 cup brown sugar to the butter to add a golden color and make it taste a bit more like caramel corn. Kids loved it, husband too! Highly recommend!

This was the first popcorn ball I ever made. I learned to make this with a small box of jello stirred in, my memory seems to think it was either strawberry or cherry because it was bright red. It's foolproof. It's a lot like krispie treats, you really can't mess this up and it's great for little hands who want to make something in the kitchen.

After a conversation about days of yore when you'd go trick or treating and get  a few yummy home made treats along with the standard candy, I couldn't stop thinking about popcorn balls!  Made this to cure that craving and all I have to say is YUMM-MMY!!!  I cut the recipe in half for 2 of us and I'm actually glad I did since we ate nearly the whole pan last night and would have done the same with twice the amount!  I used 1 bag micro butter popcorn which gave it the perfect salty/sweet combo you might not get with air popped corn, but obviously adds extra calories (pour into a bowl to pick the unpopped kernels out unless you want a trip to the dentist with a broken tooth!). 3 tb butter, and 1/2 bag of marshmallows.  Added a splash of vanilla to melted mallow mix once removed from heat.  Rather than shape into balls, I pressed them into a square pan and cut into bars once cooled, more out of laziness than anything else.  Made this Halloween night and we barely even touched the candy we were handing out cause these were soooo good!  I will make these year round as a 'olden timey days' alternative to rice crispie treats... I think I might even like this better!

My grandsons love these,  I add 1/2 cup of peanut butter into the sauce pan after the marshmallows are melted.  If you like peanut butter,  you'll like them this way.

Made around 70 balls for my halloween party...they came out perfect...I took this recipe and made it my own...microwave popcorn...two bags to half bag of mini marshmallows with the butter too of course...

I then melted everything in the microwave...laid the popcorn out on wax paper with seeds out.  Then poured the mallows over that.  Then made the balls.  No big mess with the nasty bowl or squishy the popcorn with a spoon.  

Easy, Quick!  After I formed the balls and let them sit a bit I put them in halloween baggies.  SO GOOD!

super easy for a rainy afternoon!  We did 1 bag mircrowave kettle corn, and 3 tbsp. butter, 1 1/2 tbsp. brown sugar, a dash of vanilla, and 3/4 of a bag of large marshmallows.  It's what I had on hand- very good, the kids loved them!  I'd like to add peanuts next time.

Really good, really cheap and really easy! what more do you want?  Followed others' suggestions and added 2tbsp brown sugar with melting butter and vanilla.  also added flax meal for some modicum of nutrition. My one tip is to just wet your hands with water rather than using spray oil or butter - water actually worked better for me!

Easy & delicious! Don't forget to take the unpopped kernels out before u combine the popcorn w/the marshmallows. Its hard to fish them out of sticky marshmallow otherwise.

Delicious!!  Added crushed candy canes and a touch of salt.  Wrapped in cello they were perfect holiday treat (party favor, token gift, etc.).  YUM, YUM, YUM!

Minor tweaks:  I used 2 TBSP oil to cook popcorn.  (BTW, this makes 4 QT so do use a 4QT pan.)  I reduced to 5 TBSP butter (more than krispie treat recipe but less than this recipe) and used full 10 oz bag of regular size marshmallows (approx 40 marshmallows, fairly sure this is equivalent to minis called for in this recipe).  Also added 1/3-1/2 tsp salt and 1/3-1/2 cup candy cane pieces.  YUM!  Candy canes, of course, were for the holiday season and salt added the salty-sweet contrast we wanted.  I mixed in the largest bowl I own then shaped into balls onto wax paper.  Spray or butter the bowl and your hands.  This stuff is sticky!!  

Secret tricks:  Melt butter and marshmallows slowly on LOW heat and stir constantly so they have no chance to burn.  Also, add 2 tsp milk into melted marshmallows, a tip I picked up on a rice krispie treat recipe here on allrecipes.  Makes it all extra creamy.  YUM!!

So this is how I made them.  I used 3 bags or  microwave popcorn & 1 16 OZ bag of Mini Marshmallows.  I put the marshmallows into a microwave safe bowl along with 2 TBS of water.  Microwave for 30 seconds and stir, repeat 5 times (for a total of 2 1/2 minutes).  I added food coloring to my melted marshmallows, mixed it in and then dumped it onto my popcorn (that I had in a VERY large bowl.  I put on some disposable gloves and then greased my hands up with Crisco.  I folded the popcorn and marshmallow togehter, formed it into balls (I got 20) and I stuck popsicle sticks in them (kids love anything on a stick).  I let them cool on wax paper then wrapped them up in some plastic wrap.  Came out great!  Kids loved them!!  Thanks for the idea!

Very easy! Added 1/2 C brown sugar as others recommended and M&Ms. Need to add candies after almost completely cooled or they melt when forming into balls.

So fun to make! I thought I was going to have a huge hassle with this one,but I was so wrong. I needed a last minute treat for my daughters class' Valentines Day party(how could I have forgotten?), and we had almost all the ingredients on hand already.I had hubby air popping the corn while I ran to the store down the street for the rest! We quadrupled the batch to make thirty, and ended up with FIFTY! I added one small box of sugar free mixed fruit jello,that was a great suggestion. They were nice and pink with a fruity taste. I'll experiment with other colors/flavors,possibly seasonally, and also try it without anything extra. Thank you for an easy, fun and delish recipe!

Fun to make with kids. We made them during the holidays & called them snowballs.  I added pretzel pieces & candied pecans to the popcorn & that was delicious. Make sure to use fresh marshmallows or they will come out kind of hard.

Easiest recipe ever especially if you use microwave popcorn and melt the butter & marshmallows in a big microwave safe bowl. I used the holiday gingerbreadman marshmallows with a splash of vanilla and cinnamon. Perfect!

Sooo good!  Had to make a few quick subs due to lack of proper ingredients, but these were very tasty.  I used Jiffy Pop and marshmallow fluff instead (note: marshmallow fluff is quicker than melting marshmallows).

1 package of popped Jiffy Pop, 1 jar of marshmallow fluff, 3 tbsp butter and 1 1/2 tsp vanilla.  As some others have suggested, I mixed in a large bowl and then pressed into the cake pan and cut into squares.  This stuff is addicting!!

These were so easy! Took about 10 minutes to make and boy do they taste fantastic; I couldn't stop eating them! I went with lightly buttered microwaveable popcorn to make it even easier, and I also added about 1/4 to 1/2 cup of brown sugar to the marshmallow mix to make it more carmel flavored. On my second batch, I made them with marshmallow cream because my boyfriend is vegetarian and marshmallows have gelatin. I then added some orange food coloring to the sauce. After tossing it all together, I added some choc chips for halloween. A+ recipe! Thanks for sharing!

Fantastic! I did half a batch and added probably about 1/4 to 1/2 cup of brown sugar for more flavor. My whole family ate them up and asked for more!!

I like these & more importantly, my son adores them because as well as tasting good they aren't hard! However, I did change it a bit. Before adding marshmallows, I put in 3/4 cup of Karo syrup with butter & cooked till it was "hard ball stage" (when dropped into cold water) then I put in mallows & 1/2 cup brown sugar.  It was a light caramel taste, coated well & I could easily form into balls! Yay

I used to make these when I was young so I was looking for a recipe-couldn't quite remember how we did it-we always scrubbed the kitchen sink, filled the drain with foil and did the mixing in the sink for easy cleanup.  Works great as I doubled this recipe.

This recipe was very easy and quick. But, the taste was sort of bland. I used no butter microwave popcorn. My young child liked it in bits and pieces.  Next time I would add more butter and salt.

These were so yummy!  I made them for my little boy to take to school to share for his birthday.  I made the balls smaller (made 25), added a few tablespoons of rainbow jimmies and set them in fancy cupcake liners.  They looked so cute and he loved them!  A little messy, but so are rice krispie treats :)

Yummy! I always make the corn syrup poopcorn balls and wind up burning my hands every time. These were so quick and easy. It doesnt matter if you use mini or reg. marshmallows-you'll be melting them. 5cups is about a 10oz bag of marshmallows(if you eat a few while you get everything ready). I will definitely make these again, they were soft and yummy. I dont now about the idea of adding jell-o to the mixture for color....I wouldnt like grape or orange flavored popcorn balls, plus I would think it would be too sweet.

These were easy. I did alter the recipe for ease and with what I had on hand.  I used microwave popcorn.  I just popped one or two bags and put that in a greased 9x13 dish.  You could probably just use a big mixing bowl too.  I used light butter and melted some heart-shaped strawberry flavored marshmallows.  Poured this over the top of the popcorn and sprayed cooking spray on my hands and rolled into balls.  I thought they tasted good, like marshmallow treats.

This recipe seemed really simple but when I tried it the balls wouldn't stay together and then when we finally got them to stay together and tasted the final product it wasn't tasty at all. We followed the directions exactly by the way and I made these with a group of people and all of them agreed on how clumsily they went together and how the taste wasn't good

These were AWESOME -- quick, easy, and very tasty.  I made them for a Hallowe'en party and added red & yellow food coloring to make them orange.  They were a HIT.  So much easier than the traditional method with corn syrup, etc.  Thanks for posting this!

These are just like the recipe my mom had growing up.  We decorate the outside with 10 cinnimin candies and tie with a red bow and hang on the Christmas tree.  Thanks for helping me pass down a family favorite to my kids!

These were super easy, just like rice krispie treats. I didn't have mini marshmallows on hand, only the large. I used a whole bag of the regular size Marshmallows to substitute and melted up fine. I added 1/2 c. brown sugar and the balls turned out so yummy and ooey gooey. Kids gobbled them up.

MMMMMMM....yummy! Even the pickiest little kid eaters love this one. Perfect for sending to family with Christmas packages. Traveled well and stayed fresh. Used hot air popper and a roasting pan. Very quick, simple and easy and my 5 year old was easily able to help in the process. Added the 1/2cup brown sugar as another member suggested for a yummy carmelized flavor. Thanks for the great recipe.

This recipe was quick and easy. Be sure to put the marshmallow and butter mixture pan in water as soon as you pour it over the popcorn. You'll be doing dishes for AGES if you don't! I sprinkled flaked coconut to make this recipe even better!

Very easy!  I used my air popper for the popcorn and added 1/2 cup of brown sugar to the marshmallows and butter.  This made it taste more like caramel.  I make these all the time.  So yummy!

I found this recipe about 3 years ago.  We started making them at Christmas time.  Since then we make them for other holidays.  Halloween - we add candy corn, Valentine's Day - cinnamon red hots.  My father has eaten many a popcorn ball in his years and these are his FAVORITE (even with dentures)..LOL  They can be tricky at times to sticking together...we always butter our hands well before working with the popcorn!

Yesterday at 4:30 pm - my Boyfriend remembered that he was supposed to send treats for his sons kindergarden class.  I thought popcorn balls would be great so I jumped in here to find a recipe.  They turned out beautiful - I double the recipe, added the brown sugar as recommended and a spash of vanilla - 26 perfectly sized popcorn balls for the class.  Easiest recipe I have used for this - the marshmallows kind of made it like a rice crispy treat with popcorn.  THANKS!!!

These were so easy to make and my toddlers gobbled them up. However, I followed the advice of another reviewer and added 1/2 cup of brown sugar. I thought they were a bit to sweet. Maybe a couple of tablespoons instead or  jello flavoring. I also colored mine orange for upcoming halloween partys. I thought it looked cute.

I am in love with this recipe!! i wanted to make pop corn balls for my daughter's halloween party - a monster lab theme. Well i tried the jello powder suggestion  using a package of cherry jello powder to the marshmallow mixture and upon mixing it all up discovered i had created the MONSTER BRAIN for the monster lab!!  It was quick, easy and very tasty!!

Quick easy and satisfying!  I hot air popped the corn (reduces "old maids" and fat) and added about 1 cup of peanuts.  Instead of rolling into balls, I pressed the warm mixture into a bundt pan (what else do you use it for) and let it cool completely.  We then turned it onto a plate and put salty pretzels in the center hole for movie night snacks.

Great recipe.  I've used many different popcorn ball recipes, and this one ranks pretty high.  They were a little hard to roll and keep their shape, but once I got the hang of it, it went pretty smooth.  The kids loved them. I would suggest using a very good popcorn.  I used a store brand that yielded alot of kernels that I had to sift out, for fear of breaking a tooth.

good! took another reviewers suggestion and added 1/2 c. brown sugar to the mix. also added food coloring to color mine. they didn't set up as well (harden) like other popcorn balls I've made (they were soft, which I love, but almost too soft)...but some could be related to our weather here right now--very humid/hot...not sure. still VERY yummy!! :)

I've made these before, but like to add 1/2 a package of unsweetened koolaid crystals to the marshmallows and no extra sugar.  Kids like the colour and flavour. Adding all sorts of different chewy candies as well.

They were a big hit with family and friends on halloween!  I added a few Reese' Pieces candies to be festive.  I also popped my own popcorn in my Whirley Pop with some olive oil and sea salt.  What a yummy treat!

This recipe is very easy and the best one I have made! The popcorn balls are soft, not hard. I just added a little salt and 1/2 tsp. vanilla to the melted marshmallow/butter mixture. I really like this recipe because there is no added corn syrup or sugar! This recipe is no sweeter than rice crispy bars. My whole family loves these! I will make again!

We though these would taste more like rice rispy treats but the just didn't.  They were ok but way too sweet.  Maybe a little vanilla would help.  We won't make these again.  Too sweet and greasy.

I made these for a party and had some older kids help shape them in balls. I had them wet their hands with water instead of butter. It worked perfectly, less mess. 

I also added 1 tsp of brown vanilla and ended up making a 2nd batch... the vanilla didnt taste well. I am not sure if the vanilla went rancid from the heat since I poured it directly into the pan with the butter and marshmallows. 

I also used 1 bag of microwave popcorn, Simply Salted.

Good.  I looked in my pantry and decided I didnt just want popcorn, so I added 2 T more butter and 2 cups more marshmallow with 1t of mexican vanilla, then added about 2 cups of rice cereal and a handful of shredded coconut.  Also mixed in sprinkles.  Turned out wonderful.

I've never made such an easy popcorn ball recipe.  I did add the 1/2 c. of brown sugar and threw in a few M&M's.  The kids helped make them into balls and it wasn't even that messy!  Yum! Yum!  The marshmallows are the secret ingrediant that I wish I would have known about a long time ago!

Fun Recipe! I changed it a bit because of the ingredients I had. I used chocolate cheerios, semi-sweet mini chocolate chips, and made half the marshmallow mixture. I poured the mixture (which I made in the microwave by the way) over the cheerios, mixed it up, greased my hands and rolled the balls. Then I rolled the balls in the chocolate chips. These were so good.

I would rate this ZERO stars, but I had to pick at least 1....... I don't know what I did wrong!? I used 2 bags of micro Popcorn, 1 bag of mini marshmallows, and butter. I got a gooey mess that didn't want to form. I even tried to put into 9x13 pan, no luck! After 2 hours I tried popping another bag of corn thinking I had too much of the mix, that didn't work either. Disappointed due to all the great reviews!

Nice basic recipe. I used 16c of prepopped lightly salted popcorn and added some vanilla for extra flavor. Make sure to butter your hands a few times, they get a little sticky even with butter!

I popped a few bags of microwave popcorn and added it to the marshmallow mix until it looked like enough.  These were really good.  I had some left over melted caramel and chocolate from making caramel apples, so I drizzled the popcorn balls with caramel and chocolate. very good.......

Super easy! I've always wanted to make popcorn balls and this is by far a yummy and easy treat to make. I had the kids add different types of Christmas sprinkles to the mixture after it cooled a bit and right before we rolled them into balls. They are so festive and cute! I used two bags of microwave lite popcorn and one 16 oz bag of large marshmallows. I used a full half cup of butter since I used more marshmallows and a little more popcorn but I bet it would've been fine with just 6 Tablespoons. Thank you for a great recipe!

These are so easy and tasty!n The only thing I will add is to put the lid on the pot when you are popping the corn!  I forgot and had popcorn flying all over the kitchen :)  My four year old helped make the balls and we had fun.  He loves them!  Next time we will add little M&Ms or some other kind of candy.... YUM!

I love these. I added 1/2 pk of jello mix to add flavor (my mom did that when I was a kid).  I only had large marshmallows on hand so i used a 10oz bag and they turned out great.

Sooo yummy!  I found this while looking for traditional corn syrup popcorn balls and thought I would give it a try, I am so glad I did. My husband and kids love it.  Good thing they are easy because I have to make them all the time now! (Just be sure to remove any unpopped kernels to save your teeth)

This is a great easy way to make the popcorn ball kids and adults love alike! I have been making popcorn balls for many years per request because most folks tell me they just cannot get them to stick together. This recipe works every time and is so easy! I usually add candy corn to mine just to give them the autumn look but good any time! I have shared this recipe with many over the past year, folks cannot believe how simple. Don't get me wrong the old fashion recipe with the sugar and water is great too, but this one take less than half the time and never fails! ( for beginners, you add the candy corn at the end when you are making them into balls :)

My mom made these as a kid and I always loved the chewy texture... like Rice Krispies but with popcorn.  I looked for years and years for her popcorn ball recipe, but came up empty handed... until now :)

Thank you!!!

I had never made popcorn balls before and this recipe looked like a very easy recipe to follow. Plus, I had all the ingredients in the house so I decided that I would give it a try. They turned out very well. The recipe was very concise and direct. There was nothing to misinterpret. I did notice that the mixture would stick a lot to my hands when making the balls. The recipe said to put butter on your hands to keep from sticking. I had to keep reapplying the butter because it would stick too much. However, it didn’t seem like the mixture stuck together because I had to pack them together just to stay. I used many different types of popcorn that I had left over from the popcorn bar we had at my wedding. I used buttered popcorn, kettle corn, and cinnamon-flavored popcorn. I would have to say that the best one was definitely the kettle corn. I would suggest that everyone try it with kettle corn. I also tried to add m&ms to the mixture with the buttered popcorn; however, that just made the chocolate melt which made the balls less sticky and they fell apart.

We loved these. We made them in the microwave so they were quick and easy. The kiddos and I made them green for Halloween and then they decorated them to look like goblins.

These are really great and easy to make. I also used microwave butter lite popcorn and I also use a microwave to melt the marshmallows. Less sugar, less marshmallows and it all is easy.

These were so fun to make!! I have made it twice, once following the recipe wich turned out great. The second I tried to use marshmellow fluff and it did not turn out at all. It would not stick together. I also tried to add coloring with food coloring, but I think the culprit was the fluff. I ended up with a bowl of loose marshmello covered popcorn. I guess this would work nicely if you wanted to add nuts and make something that resembles cracker jacks.

Yummy and gooey popcorn balls!  I sort my popcorn after it pops to get rid of kernels and partially popped corn that can wreck your teeth.  That makes the balls much more enjoyable to eat.

Great recipe, makes way more than 8 though, unless really huge. I popped the popcorn without oil in a paper bag in the microwave while I did the marshmallow and butter on the stove- if I had popped more than a 1/2 cup popcorn I could have easily made more balls, because the marshmallow/butter mix makes a lot. I butter my ands and dormed into balls and let set in greased muffin pan, got 16+ nice size ones. Since its Halloween, we also chopped up reese pieces and formed it into some, delish! Definitely will use this again at other holidays with other candies added depending on the special day.

You know, most people that eat these wonderful treats are so surprised that popcorm can be used instead of rice krispies or other types of cereal.  I makes these for every party we have or go to and for school activities.  These are usually the first treat to disappear among the rest.  Another keeper!

Great and easy recipe.  I added watermelon flavoring (1/2 tsp of LoriAnn Gourmet Flavoring and green sprinkle)--kids and everyone else just LOVED them.  I am going to try other flavors too---Thanks for recipe.

These were pretty good...they were certainly easy enough to make. I used microwave popcorn (2 bags of light), I used a bag of lg. marshmallows & I added candy corn. I made 10 lg balls, wrapped them in plastic wrap & tied them off w/ orange & black curling ribbon. Very festive & my grandkids enjoyed them...thanks!

easy and delicious.  i used pam instead of butter to melt the marshallows and used smart pop microwave popcorn with light butter and salt.  i thought  the saltimess of that popcorn and the sweetness of the marshallows offset each other perfectly.  a healthy snack when craving sweet.

Delicious recipe!  Reminiscent of Rice Crispy Treats, as a lover of both marshmallows and popcorn, I couldn't resist these tasty, tasty treats.  The only thing I did differently was to leave them in the pan and cut them into bars instead of forming them into popcorn balls.  I also air popped the popcorn in hopes of saving a few calories  :)

My son won a huge thing of marshmallows so we made 3 batches of these with 3 variations.  First we made it just as the recipe said & those were great.  We made one the same but with 1 c brown sugar added to the butter before the marshmallows.  The third & favorite was adding 2oz unsweetened chocolate with the butter then adding craisins with the popcorn.  These are very chocolatey & the craisins go great with it.
Thank you for a great recipe.

This was okay. I like the flavor, but I didn't feel the marshmallow goo was able to be incorporated thoroughly.  But the popcorn did hold together as balls.

This recipe was not good. I've made these kind of popcorn balls before. and there is way too much butter in the marshmallow mixture. I even lowered it to 4 tbsp and still too much. i'd go with only 2 tablespoons otherwise it will be a mess that refuses to stick together! I ended up having to press mixture into a pan and cool in the fridge to cut up into squares...

This has become my family's go to quick snack recipe. It's also fairly cheap as far as snack food recipes go. We try to always keep some popcorn and marshmallows in the house for this treat. It's also good adding peanut butter or brown sugar too.
Thanks so much for sharing this and giving my family a new favorite!

This is a great recipe! But make sure that you have a lid on when you are popping the popcorn or it will go everywhere. We did this recipe with movie theater popcorn out of a bag so we had to clean the kernels by rinsing them with a lot of hot water to remove the butter. Then we dried off the kernels and added them to a pan. Big marshmallows also work, as long as you use 5 cups. It was easy, but it took longer than the required time since we did not have plain popcorn kernels. Otherwise, this was an awesome party recipe(:

This was so good! I never thought about using marshmallows instead of the usual vinegar and corn syrup. The best part was that it essentially only has 2 ingredients: popcorn and marshmallows.

These were really good.  My 10-yr-old daughter helped.  They were super sweet and yummy - just what you expect a popcorn ball to taste like.

Loved them, I haven't made popcorn balls in forever and my husband isn't a huge caramel fan so I thought I would give these a shot. We all liked them.

They were fine.  I brought the balls to a Halloween party and they were eaten all up.  But, I missed the caramel flavor.

Very easy recipe, but the balls are very hard to form. Had to have my spouse keep spraying my hands with oil. Also it doesn't have that classic taste of a popcorn ball. Still, a good recipe for someone who doesn't want to fool with a more complex process.

The kids thought these were good.  I prefer more of a crunchy popcorn ball, these were chewy.  I probably wouldn't make again.

These are fun to make! I added a little orange food coloring to the marshmallow mixture and mixed Jelly Bellies and mini chips in when making the balls. I let the mixture cool a little more than I should have because I was afraid it would melt the chocolate - but it cools really fast, so if you are adding candy you might want to so it sooner so the balls will stick to it a little easier. Thanks for the recipe!

These are quick and tasty! I made these for an afterschool snack for my kids. They gobbled them up. I made smaller sized balls and ended up with 12. I also added a drop of orange food coloring to the marshmallow mixture since it is close to Halloween!

Turned out great! I made these for halloween & were easy. I heated the ingredients in the microwave- I then added a small pkg of strawberry jello. It came out a bit too soft to shape into balls so I spread it out on a cookie sheet until it firmed up to shape. But it was worth the wait!

My dad always used this recipe when we were kids and the whole family would join in.  But we always always used peanuts(unsalted) in the popcorn balls.  I just don't think they are the same without peanuts.

This is an okay recipe, nothing really special. I've used this recipe many,many times.I have used hot air popped corn, and heat/oil. I've noticed that the air popcorn is much better,but stails quicker.And you also wont get a greasy product, and kernal flakes.

This is super fast and easy to make....and is super yummy! If you don't know anything about using a candy thermometer, or what a "hard-crack" or a "hard-ball" stage is... then this is the recipe for you.  And even if you do know what all that is, this is way too easy!  It took me longer standing in line at the grocery store!  MAKE THIS AND ENJOY!

No need to look for another popcorn recipe: this is it! The only thing I did differently was to add a good pinch of salt to the freshly-popped popcorn. We also added some orange food coloring to the marshmallow mix. These are going to be a big hit at my kids' library group next week. Thanks so much!

Great recipe, quick & easy to make. As previous reviewers have noted, don't try to stir the marshmallow into the popcorn in the 9x12 pan, use a large deep bowl. I also added some m&ms as I was forming the popcorn balls.

I think that this a great easy and quick snack to make if you don't have a lot of time. One bad thing that happened was that it was too sticky but after it cooled down it was great. A thing that we added were a little bit of sprinkles. This added a little color and some taste. Over all this was a great snack.

It tasted like stale rice krispy treats. This recipe served its purpose for me though. I needed to make easy popcorn balls for my preschool class as a part of a thematic unit. This was certainly easy. I made one change which was to use air popped popcorn since that's what I have here. I don't know if that is why it had the texture it had. Anyhow, my preschoolers won't be the wiser. They will just enjoy a sweet treat while we read Elhert's Snowballs.

Tip: Use an Air Popper. Using unsalted sweet cream butter lets you control the amount of salt you add to your mixture.  Let your final mixture cool in the bowl that you air popped into.  Just wipe it with a paper towel and spray with nonstick cooking spray.

Wonderful snack! I made no changes to this recipe, only added to it! I mixed a handful of unsalted pretzels and a handful of chopped walnuts over popcorn and then stirred in the melted (unsalted) buttery marshmallow! Formed into serving size balls and stored in zip lock bag for a quick no sodium snack!! Def. will be keeping these on hand for now on!

Much softer than jello popcorn balls, but more difficult to form into a ball and not as tasty I thought.

I just made this to try to salvage a disastrous attempt at making caramel popcorn. Added some white chocolate melts and it turned out amazing. Thank you for saving the day!

Made this and I found them to be kinda bland. They didn't taste as sweet as I expected them to be. I even added white chocolate m&ms and still didn't help the flavor much. They were also really hard to bind together.

These are great! I haven't had a popcorn ball since I was a kid...our neighbor used to make them for Halloween. That's exactly what I did for my girls' Halloween parties this year, and they were a huge success! I brought them to work, too, and they were gone very quickly. They are easy and fun to make....just make sure your hands are well greased!

I think these are pretty good.  They are definatly easy to make.  They were more chewey than I expected.  But still good.  I made 20 smaller balls with this recipe.  I also added 2 tsp brown sugar to give it some color, and orange and black sprinkles to make them cute for halloween.  I will definatly make these again.

really easy to make with the kids. We used food coloring to make 'easter egg' popcorn balls, it was a blast.
