My mom always makes pineapple upside-down cake from scratch for birthdays with the white cake and then the sugar and pineapple rings on top.  This cake tastes very similar, but it is so much easier.  The only thing missing was the maraschino cherries.  My parents, my sister, and I really enjoyed it late one night, while it was fresh from the oven.  I'm sure it would be great with ice cream or whipped cream on top too...

My husband and I really enjoyed this and it was so easy to make. I didn't have any walnuts so I decided to use a crumble topping from an apple crisp recipe and it turned out great. Also I realized that I was out of evaporated milk so I used sweetened condensed milk in place of that and the sugar. I will probably continue to make it this way because it was excellent.

The cake tasted fine, but the topping ruined it. There is way too much of it, and it weighed down the cake so much that there were holes everywhere.  My husband wouldn't try it just based on apperance.  You could probably skip the topping all together, or cut in in half at LEAST and it would be better.  I'm dissapointed that more than likely, I'll be tossing the rest of the cake.

This was a big hit!  It's very moist and great warm or cold.  I reduced the brown sugar to one quarter cup and didn't add the nuts.  Contrary to the instructions I did butter the pan.  Thanks for the recipe, this will be a regular dessert at my house.

Oh soooo good Kitty!  This almost has a caramely flavor going on...delicious.  I forgot to add the brown sugar and walnuts to the top of the cake so I just mixed them in along with the icing ingredients.  It turned out perfect and the pineapple gave this a suprisingly wonderful taste.  I'll pass this one on...thankx a bunch.

This was okay warm from the oven, but after it cooled it had a very unappealing clammy texture.  My kids wouldn't touch it and we threw out over half of it--very rare for desserts in our house.

Outstanding!  Great texture (similar to coffee cake texture).  Tasted similar to pineapple upside down cake but much better.

I made this cake for a family get together and it got great raves from the kids as well as the adults. I doubled the recipe, thankfully, because the hostess couldn't wait to have the leftovers for breakfast! I used the condensed milk over the top as others had suggested. I think this cake would be good with either milk. It would probably be good without either one, too, for those of you wathing your weight. I added some cinnamon chips to this cake batter to give it a little pizzaz- good choice! This cake doesn't have a strong pineapple taste, which I liked. Overall it was just a yummy coffee cake great for a get together. I think I will try this next time with strawberries and whipped cream! And maybe I will replace the white sugar with brown. This is a very versatile recipe- the combinations are endless!

Very easy and very good and moist. I cut back on the butter in the topping to 1/4 cup ( 1/2 stick).  I don't think it hurt the taste any.

This cake is awesome.  The moist spongy texture and buttery flavor are just what I was craving.  After moving to the UK 4 months ago I was missing a taste of home and this cake hit the spot.. I felt like I was back home in Texas in my Granny's kitchen.  My fiancee also thought this cake was delish.  Oh.. and our flat smells awesome.

I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out so yummy!  My family loved it.  It is a very dense, very rich cake unlike any I've had before.  It was so simple to make.  This recipe is a keeper.

I actually call my grandmother "Granny" so I made this for her for that reason. It was awesome! I ended up using vanilla creamer in place of the evaporated milk and it still turned out very well!

Can I give this cake 10 stars? It is so incredibly good and so easy to make. And, I usually don't like pineapple! I used sweetened condensed milk and omitted the sugar for the topping (as recommended by others) and it turned out scrumptious. I can't say enough about how yummy this cake is. Serve it warm - it's even better.

This cake reminded me of my mother's pineapple upside down cake.  It is very moist, but you could cut down the topping by half and it would be as good.

I liked this recipe better when I put the batter in an 8x11 pan and baked for 40 minutes. I also halved the topping ingredients since the cake was, overall, smaller.

I made this for book club tonight. Several friends raved about it. I tried it after everyone left and it was ok. It felt like it was missing something but I can't figure out what it is. My only change was to use half the topping (liquid) on the warm cake. 

I can't say that I'd make it again. The cake part was just too bland for me.

This is a comfort food dessert. I used pecans. We put the topping in a serving cup and poured it over individual servings (in bowls). That way the cake didn't get soggy and made better leftovers. Leftover cake is best heated a little and topping poured separately.

Great taste extremely moist!  The only change I made was 1 cup light brown sugar and 1 cup chopped pecans sprinkled over the batter. To anyone contemplating making this cake you won't regret it, It's a keeper for sure!!

The only thing I did differently was use 1 cup chopped pecans...super easy, super sweet (we love sweet), and super moist! It did take just over 40 minutes in the oven. This is an easy one to make last minute.

I made this cake using only brown sugar. Cake is addictive. I will certainly keep the ingredients on hand for quick preparation.

I wish I had read all the comments before making this. If I had, I would have cut out a lot of the sugar.  I am sure that for most people this is a delightful cake but for us it was way too sweet. It tasted very good though....  and if I make it again I will just cut out half the brown sugar and half the white sugar.

Positive:  really easy to make
Negative:  This cake is really sweet and dense.  I only used half of the topping sauce and half the brown sugar topping and it is still too moist and sweet.  This cake won't get eaten.

It was WAY too sweet. I will make it again with revisions.  I/2 C. sugar in the batter instead of  a whole cup. Half of the brown sugar topping and cut the glaze topping in half (there was way too much)

Delicious.......especially warm with vanilla ice cream!!  Very easy to make.  I had some toffee chips left from another recipe so I sprinkled 1/2 cup over batter with the brown sugar and nuts.  I doubt this made a great difference in the "deliciousity" of the cake.  I also used 1/2 c sweetened condensed milk in place of the evaporated milk and sugar in the topping.  I'll definitely be making it again.  Other than the pineapple, I always have all the ingredients on hand.  I'll just make sure I keep a can of pineapple in the pantry at all times!

I gave it a 3 because my family thought it was good but I just didn't care for it. I will agree with others as it was very moist.

Very moist.  Taste is very similar to old fashioned pineapple upside down cake I make in a cast iron frying pan. Great potluck dessert.

This is the only cake my husband will eat, so it is the only one I make. I substitute heavy whipping cream (not whipped) for the evaporated milk so I don't have left over milk I won't use. I use canned pineapple in it's own juice, and if I skimp on sugar, I use less white sugar making the batter. Don't omit the brown sugar as it adds flavor.

This recipe is amazing. Turns out perfect every time. It is a great cake to throw together for a quick dessert. My grandmother made this for me as a child so the recipe has been around a long time. She always served it with sweetened whipped cream. Delicious !!!

This was much better than what I expected.  My company really raved about it.  I especially love the "caramel" topping!
