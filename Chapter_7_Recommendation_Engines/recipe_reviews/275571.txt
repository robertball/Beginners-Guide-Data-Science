This is delicious! The only change I made was only using the juice of half a lime and omitting the lime zest.  Definitely a keeper!

I put it on a bed of fresh arugula and served it with a crusty baguette.   So good!

This will make a wonderful luncheon salad to serve to friends!  I had to add a little bit of sugar to the dressing because my lime was a little tart!  I grilled my chicken after a short marinating in lime olive oil and lemongrass mint white balsamic vinegar.  Serve this with a little toasted French bread and you have yourself a winner.  Thanks, lutzflcat!
