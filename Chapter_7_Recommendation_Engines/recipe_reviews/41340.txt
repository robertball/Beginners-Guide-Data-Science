I changed these a little. I added 1t more cinnamon, 1t mixed spice, 1t nutmeg, replaced 1/2cup of plain flour with wholemeal flour, replaced 1/2 cup white sugar with brown sugar. I also used 1/2 cup more grated apple. The extra apple makes them very moist. When you haven't got tart apples make sure you reduce the sugar because I didn't think of it and mine were a bit too sweet last time. They're easy to make, the only time consuming bit being the peeling and grating! Yummy!!!!

yummy!!  I made a few changes.  I substituted applesauce for the oil to make it lower in fat.  and I added nutmeg.  You could also add splenda instead of sugar if you are diabetic.  loose the walnuts and it's lower in fat and calories. However the muffin is really good with the walnuts.

My whole family loved these muffins.  I thought they looked too healthy to be good but boy was I wrong.  I freeze them in individual baggies and my kids love to take them to school for snack.

These muffins are amazing! I exchanged oatmeal with raisins for the raisin bran and 1 tsp powder and 1/2 tsp soda in place of all that soda. They turned out so light and fluffy - I eat them every morning for breakfast now!

I prety much altered this recipe beyond recognition... 1tsp baking powder, 3/4 tsp soda, a full cup carrots, and instead of raisin bran cereal, I used a cup of quick-cooking oatmeal and 3/4 cup of Grape-nuts cereal. AND I dind't have buttermilk, so I used 1/2 cup low fat sour cream and 1/2 cup skim milk. I would decrease the powder next time to 3/4 tsp and add raisins or chopped prunes. They turned out great, not really cake-ey.

My 4 year old helped me with this recipe.  We made this in an 8x8 in baking pan rather than muffin tins (at the last minute I realized I didn't have them...only the miniature) but it turned out good anyway.  I added a splash of vanilla extract to the batter and meant to add a mashed banana, but forgot.  Good way to sneak in some extra vitamins.

I've been looking for a reasonably healthy snack muffin, and these are wonderful! Made a couple of tiny tweaks (to satisfy my mind that these are as healthy as can be). 

Reduced sugar to 1/2 cup. Replaced 1/2 cup of the flour with oat bran for extra fiber (you can find oat bran with the hot cereals at the grocery). Shredded 3 small granny smith apples (with their peels) and 4 carrots in the food processor. Ended up with more than called for (probably totaling about 2 1/2-3 cups) but put it all into the batter anyway. Based on other raters suggestions, added a smidge of fresh grated nutmeg.  I was worried the shift of ingredient balance toward fruit/carrot might mess up the consistency of the final product, but they came out great!!

I ended up with more than 12 muffins worth of batter, of course. Since I didn't expect much rise (with the added apple/carrot) I filled muffin cups to the tippy top and mounded the batter a little. Ended up with 15 muffins. As expected, very little rise - but mounding the batter gave them a nice muffin shape (see pic) and they were very light, had a nice texture between sticking together and crumbly. Just PERFECT sweetness, even using tart apples.  

PS - after freezing - nuke for 20 seconds, then 1 minute in the toaster oven - tastes just like fresh from the oven!

PPS - DON'T forget to spray inside paper muffin cups with pam. I forgot once and it was miserable to get the papers off.

I'm a high school senior, and my younger sister and I are always looking for quick breakfasts to eat on the way to school, so I tried these muffins.  The recipe is just so-so, but I'm sure that with some "tweaking" they would be much better.  I didn't have raisin bran and I'm not a big fan of raisins, so I used Special K instead.  I also didn't have buttermilk so I subbed 3/4 tablespoon of vinegar and enough skim milk to make 3/4 cup.  Also I omitted the nuts.  One thing I found was that the muffins have a prominent baking soda taste, and they didn't rise very much.  Next time -- and I will try these again -- I will use one tsp of baking powder and 1/2 tsp of baking soda instead of the 1 1/4 tsp baking soda.

This is a good hearty muffin.  A good breakfast muffin for someone on the go. I got a little crazy with it though. I had no buttermilk and no inclination to make any, so I used the yogourt substitute... with a twist. Since I had no plain yogourt I used what was in the fridge, blackberry yogourt. Mmm, very nice substitute. I suppose any fruit yogourt would be just as good... think I'll try pineapple next time...

This recipe is excellent!  I was skeptical at first, since the combination of apple and carrots seems odd, but it is delicious!  I double the recipe and make 2 loaves.

I liked these, but found them a litte dry the first time I made them.  I too, used baking powder and less soda.  I didn't have Raisin Bran cereal so I used oatmeal and ground graham flour--very good.  Also, plain yogourt is a good substitute for buttermilk. All baking should have vanilla!  Second time, I used 2/3 cup of honey in place of sugar which solved the moisture problem and Raisin bran cereal definately is better to use in this recipe!!  Yum, Yum--will make again and again with honey, vanilla and Raisin bran!!

I orginally gave this recipe 3 stars but increased it to four after eating a few more of the muffins over a couple of days time.  I decided that I like them more than I originally thought!  They were better after completely cooled and even toasted the next day.  I made a bunch of changes to this recipe, mostly based on reviews and my daughter's egg allergy.  I used Raisin Bran Crunch cereal topped off with a little oatmeal, 1 tsp baking powder and 1/2 tsp baking soda, and instead of the egg I substituted 1/4 cup applesauce.  I also used 1 cup all-purpose flour and 1/4 cup whole wheat flour, decreased the sugar to 1/2 cup, and added 1 tsp of vanilla to the batter.  I got exactly 12 muffins and they were done perfectly at 20 minutes.  The muffins were kind of bland and stuck to the paper when warm, but were much better later.  When I make these again I will either try brown sugar or keep the original amount of sugar stated in the recipe and increase the cinnamon.

I wasn't overly enamoured with these, though I'm not sure how much was the fault of the recipe and how much was mine. I reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup because the batter tasted really sweet with that much, and also used plain bran cereal as I had no raisins left. As I say, I don't know if it was because of these changes, but I found the resulting muffins quite bland. Other changes I made included using part natural yoghurt and part milk instead of the buttermilk, grating the apple with the carrots and using part almonds as well as chopped walnuts.

These muffins are easy, moist (using very little fat) and are very flavorful.  Although my 7-year-old son didn't like seeing the grated carrot in there, the rest of us enjoyed them.  I would make these again.

This is one of my favorite muffin recipes. They turn out very moist, very tasty, very hearty. Great by themselves or with a bowl of soup. The only changes I make is to use egg substitute, use part whole wheat flour, and if I don't have fresh buttermilk on hand, I use Saco Cultured Buttermilk Blend. It's an awesome product for those who don't keep fresh buttermilk around, but want to use it periodically in recipes. Enjoy!

Was expecting a better muffin.  Used applesauce as suggested by some other reviewers to increase the moistness but still turned out dry.  Just ok.

I made 42 mini muffins that baked for 13 minutes with this recipe.  Following some of the earlier suggestions, I used 1 tsp. baking powder and 1/2 tsp. baking soda in place of the 1 1/4 tsp. baking soda called for.  I also added 3/4 tsp. vanilla and a handful of golden raisins (this was a good tip.).  Turned out moist and flavorful.

very good muffins, with lots of fruit and veggie goodness. i substituted lowfat peach yogurt for the buttermilk and unsweetened apple sauce for the sugar. everything else i did to spec and i find them to be chewy, sweet, and generally pretty great. i think i will leave the walnuts out next time, just because i don't care for them too much, and maybe i will try to use some whole wheat flour too for more fiber, but a good recipe.

I made some substitutions, but part of what's great about these is how forgiving they are.  I used Special K instead of raisin bran and added in some golden raisins, I used peach yogurt and some cherry juice instead of buttermilk because I didn't have any, and finally very finely chopped pecans instead of walnuts (personal preference).  I wasn't too sure when I was putting them into the papers, but they came out great.  The fruits and cereal all cooked down.  It was a little alarming to see the super chunky batter going into the muffin cups - I thought they would be dry and taste like fruits and veggies.  Not the case at all.  I even made cream cheese frosting so my picky kids would eat them, but I'll leave it off because they taste good without, and I can freeze them and just eat them myself when I want a snack.

Really good.  Froze them and warmed them and they tasted fresh baked.  Would definitely make them again.

I just ate the first muffin, still warm, and it was wonderful.  Love the moistness and the textures.  I used Raisin Bran Crunch which is sweeter so decreased sugar just a little (I like sweet!).  Also added a pinch of powdered ginger and about 1/4 tsp nutmeg and am very pleased with the result.  Other than that, used ingredients as listed.

This is a very moist, very good muffin.  The flavor is not strong and could use more of something, maybe cinnamon, nutmeg, clove or allspice.  I will try that next time.  It also made 22 muffins.

Excellent recipe!!!  I used applesauce instead of oil but sprayed my muffin cups so they wouldn't stick.  These are the best muffins that I have ever had.  If you like carrot cake you will love these!!!

These are delicious, and I will definitely be making them again and again. I really like the juicy chopped apple pieces, and think I would prefer it to grated apples. I followed some other reviewer suggestions: 1 tsp baking powder, 1/2 tsp baking soda; added nutmeg; cut sugar to about 1/2 cup. Also, I used pecans instead of walnuts, since I had them on hand. I also used a cup each of apple and carrots.  I used buttermilk powder, since I find it easier to keep around the kitchen. I used extra large muffin cups, and this recipe made 9 wonderful muffins.

I can't say enough good things about these muffins.  This is one of the best and most reliable muffin recipes I've ever tried!  Versatile, too.  I agree with another reviewer that they're a bit on the sweet side, so I cut the sugar back to 1/2 cup.  I've used dried blueberries in place of the apples, want to try pear sometime.  These are now a mainstay at our house, and they also have the advantage of not tasting "old" the next day (if they last that long!) like many muffin recipes do.  Great cut in half and toasted too!

These muffins are excellent.  My whole family loves them so much that I have made them 3 times already this week.  Instead of chopped apple, I grated one apple and added about 1/8 to 1/4 cup of applesauce to equal 3/4 cup.  I also used regular milk and omitted the walnuts.  I cooked them for 13 minutes at 400 degrees and they turned out perfect!

Very delicious.  I modified the recipe by adding about 1/3 c. unsweetened applesauce and made an icing from powdered sugar and apple juice.  Yield one loaf and 6 muffins.  Bake at 375 degrees for 45-50 min.

This was a really good muffin!  I did not have buttermilk, so I just used about a TB of vinegar in the 3/4 c of milk as a substitute.  I also used pecans instead of walnuts (what I had on hand).  It made 7 extra large muffins that came out moist and delicious (for the extra large muffin cups, I heated the oven to 350, and baked them for 25 minutes).  Next time I will try using whole wheat flour to make them even healthier.

Very good and moist, not too sweet.  I used a mixture of carrot/tropical fruit juice cocktail and skim milk instead of the buttermilk.  I had to buy raisin bran for this recipe because we don't normally have it - my money was not wasted!  My 3yo ate 2, which is a feat.  Definitely a keeper.

I needed a "healthy" muffin for a preschool treat. I just made them and they passed my taste test.  Hoping the kids will too.  I did use frosting, b/c I decorated for Halloween, but they DO NOT need it.  VERY moist, and tasty too.

Fabulous muffins!  I ended up with 1 1/2 C chopped Granny Smith apple so I left out the carrot.  To save calories, I also omitted the nuts.  Result: a wonderful apple muffin!  The texture is just perfect.

I really liked this recipe, but I did think it was a tad 'oily'

I also substituted dry oatmeal for the nuts, for an allergy reason.

With nuts I bet it would be delish!

Simple, quick, delicious!  The only thing I did different is decrease the sugar to 1/2 cup and use skim milk instead of buttermilk. Great way to use up cereal, I simply used bran cereal minus the raisins. Very good.

Mine came out an absolute disaster. But then, I changed the recipe quite a bit, so it was my fault :-( I added honey instead of sugar and apple sauce instead of oil, and all I got was a gooey mess, which I had to throw out. 

Next time, will avoid the honey and stick to sugar.

Just an average recipe.  I used olive oil instead of canola, and left out the walnuts.  Next time I will just use bran flakes instead of with rasins.  The kids would not eat them, but I thought they were okay.

I wasn't thrilled with these. I don't think the ingredients melded enough into a muffin and it seemed like I ended up with apple and carrot bits held together by a muffin shell. They got eated by by husband (my not so picky kids wouldn't touch them). I don't think I'll be making these again.

These are so tasty and moist!  I added a bit of powdered ginger just because I like ginger.   The natural sugar in the carrots and raisins adds a lot of sweetness, so I cut the sugar back to 1/3 cup and these were still sweet enough for my husband and me!  (We live in Japan and have become accustomed to not-so-sweet sweets.)  I've passed this recipe on to friends and they love it too!  Thanks for sharing.
