These were fun but I have a huge tip here. Peel you potatoes and boil them for 7 minutes to soften. Drain and cool. THEN put them in your food processor and shred. It makes for the perfect consistency to shape and form your tots with no draining or anything else. I suggest some seasoning such as onion powder, s&p, and dill. Great recipe and fun but I find you really need to soften those potatoes before they ever go in the oil if you want them crisp.

I added garlic salt and black pepper to this and was pretty good, but the store bought is much crispier and certainly less time consuming.

Maybe I didn't shred them finely enough but they didn't stick together even a little.  We ended up making hash browns because we had to use the shredded potato for something but I won't try this again.

These were very tasty and they were easy to make! My family loved them and I definitely will be making these again!
