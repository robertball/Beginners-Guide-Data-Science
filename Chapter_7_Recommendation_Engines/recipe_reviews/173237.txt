I followed the recipe exactly except not sure about size of arugula since I don't have a way to measure.  My husband and I agreed that is was nice to have something different, but there are other salads we like better.  Unusual, but not over the top great.

This salad was delicious--light but satisfying. I served it with chicken kabobs. (About fennel, try it! I hadn't till recently, because I'm not a black licorice fan, but it was so good in this!)

I was happy to find this recipe, having fresh spinach, fennel and oranges sitting on the counter waiting to be used.  I substituted pine nuts for the almonds, other than that I followed the recipe.  I love it as written. The cumin in the salad dressing is a nice touch.
