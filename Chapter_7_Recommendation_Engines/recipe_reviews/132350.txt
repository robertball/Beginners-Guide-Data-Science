Nice take on the traditional "Reuben" sandwich, one of my favorites! Plus it's quick and easy to put together.  Since homemade dressing is a sinch to make to make I opted for "Creamy-Style Russian Dressing" from this site vs. using mayo and hot sauce. I also used low fat Swiss cheese and these were delicious- a definite keeper and one I'll have to remember for Thanksgiving leftover turkey!

I used Bagel Thins in place of the rye bread and homemade roasted onion mayonnaise. I was careful to drain and squeeze as much of the liquid out of the sauerkraut as to prevent soggy or wet sandwiches. The whole family thought these were fantastic--my husband asked for seconds after he'd eaten his. The roasted onion mayonnaise really made this extra fabulous. VERY good.

This was a tasty sandwich!  It's great for a quick lunch or dinner.  I didn't change a thing and it came out great.  It's a unique twist to the classic reuben.  This recipe is a keeper in our house.

I made these for lunch today with a couple of minor changes. I used whole wheat tortillas to make these into a wrap, low fat laughing cow swiss cheese and made my own thousand island syle dressing to put in it. I made the wraps in advance and took the kraut and dressing in a bowl to work . I assmebled it all and nuked for about a minute. Very good.

I enjoyed this one!  No rye bread or hot wing sauce, we used Gluten Free Bread and I used cocktail sauce & spicy mustard with a healthy squirt of sriracha sauce to sub for the hot wing sauce.  Delish!

I made these for my family one evening because I was looking for a quick meal.  They were amazing!  The only thing I did different was add 2 slices of swiss cheese instead of using 1.  Even my 12yr old thought they were delicious.  I will definitely be making these again!

I made this recipe exactly as explained.  I liked it fairly well, but there were issues with everyone else.  My boyfriend's daughter said it was too spicy, even though we cut down the hot sauce on hers, and my boyfriend didn't really like it at all saying it didn't compare to corned beef.  I liked the flavor, and would probably make it for myself again, but I think I'll be trying to find ways to tweak it, and make a normal Reuben for everyone else next time.

I made the low-fat version with Laughing Cow cheese and not wing sauce, just very little Thousand Island brushed on. It was great.

Yum! I used deli style Dijon mustard instead of the mayo/hot sauce mixture, but it was delish! Will make again for sure!

Huge hit in our house. The only tweak I make is to combine the mayo and hot sauce before putting it on the bread. Great way to get variety in the weeknight dinner rotation!
