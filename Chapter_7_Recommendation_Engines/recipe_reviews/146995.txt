I've been making this jam for years.  It is a jam not a jelly.  Jelly is made with only the juice.  Anyway be creative and use any flavor of jello you like.  Apricot seems to be the favorite.  It's easy and sooo delicious.  Fun to tell your friends what's in it after they tell you they love it and hate zucchini.

This recipe was actually really good. It has a nice texture and and looks beautiful once canned. I used 1/2 the recipe and only had strawberry/banana Jell-o on hand. Next time i will just use the strawberry to give it a stronger flavor. I will definatly be making this again and giving this away for christmas gifts. I may change the name and just say surprise Strawberry Jelly to make it more appealing for gifts. Thanks;)

This recipe is fantastic.  No one could believe it was zucchini.  I didn't have enough Strawberry jello - so I used Red Raspberry instead....  Took a jar to work....  it was a big hit!  Highly recommend this....  great for gifts

The jam has good flavor (It is NOT jelly) but do not make this recipe without pectin or it will be runny!

I used orange Jello because I've never seen apricot around here.  I did have peach, but peach/pineapple didn't sound appealing.  I used 4 1/2 cups of sugar and it is still very sweet.  I will probably cut it to 4 cups next time.  I wasn't sure if one package of Jello would make it set up so I threw in another package of plain gelatin.  I also used 4 packets of "True Orange", a crystallized orange powder I just found and fell in love with.  I had to cook the zuchinni for 3 hours on a low simmer until it turned clear.  I'm going to label it Mock Orange/Pineapple Marmalade.  My boyfriend had to admit that it was absolutely unrecognizable as a zuchinni-based product.

I used Blackberry Fusion Jello and it came out wonderfully. I only got 6 1/2 pints out of the full recipe not the 6 pints as the recipe states. I think I'll bump up the lemon juice to 3/4 of a cup next time so it's not as sweet. Am also going to try it with crushed cantalope instead of pineapple and just use unflavored gelatin. Great way to use zucchini!

I increased the lemon juice to 3/4 cup and decreased the sugar to 2 cups! I made raspberry, strawberry, and peach. Still perfectly tasty. And it gels up just fine without pectin (cuz that's what the jello is for!)

Great flavor from the gelatin but I still am not sure how long I should have boiled the zucchini.....it's texture is a little odd and I am wondering if I should have boiled it longer.

This jelly was delicious! I used strawberry jello & will try orange on my next batch. I followed the recipe exactly & I only got 8 pint jars but I'm new at canning so maybe I overfilled the jars??

LOVE IT. Last double batch had 3 cups sugar per batch.  I didn't have enough lemon for 1 cup, so added in lemon zest.  This is very good.  You do have to cook it for a bit longer that called for.

I used up the last of the Zucchini from my garden yesterday with this delicious recipe. I did not need pectin like another poster recommended. I did boil the mixture for a good 45 minutes and I used less sugar (about a cup less) and it came out perfect! Also I did not peel the zucchini since they were not tough skinned. I will definitely put this recipe in my keeper box! I did use a box of strawberry & a box of lemon and I look forward to experimenting with more flavors next season :>) Thank you for this wonderful keeper!

I love this jam.  Great way to get rid of your zucchini in the garden.  I used 4 1/2 cups of sugar and two .3 oz packages of sugar free strawberry gelatin. This sets up just fine.  I was worried at first.  I had to let this sit for about 24 hrs before they really started to set up in the jars.  More like jam then jelly.  My zucchini came out a little crunchy but my family really enjoys the texture.  Thanks for the recipe.

Very good recipe, I ended up only making 1/2 a batch and used peach jello. Will be making this again and handing out at christmas. Also gonna enter it in the fair next week! Thank you for a great tasting recipe! Mine didnt turn out like a jelly though- more like jam or marmalade. Very tasty no matter what you call it.

WAY too much sugar. I reduced the sugar to 3 cups and used sugar-free jello trying orange,strawberry or raspberry. It set up beautifully with NO need for pectin. One pint even sealed without hot-water bathing. (I planned on trying it the next morning so I just left it on the counter overnight and in the morning it was sealed.) I would call it marmalade, though.  I put orange zest in one batch and it was wonderful. A bigger can of crushed pineapple didn't hurt anything. I probably cooked it for about an hour. Highly recommend!

I have made this twice.  Both times I used the 20+ oz. can of pineapple.  Drain the can a LOT.  And if I had it to do over, I would have reduced the sugar.  Really sweet the second time because I ran out of lemon juice and finished it with key lime juice.  It doesn't give you a time on how long to cook it.  Mine was two to three hours.  And I thought it might have too much liquid so I boiled uncovered.  If it looks like about four cups when you are done, throw in the gelatin.  If it looks like more, then you may have to add pectin to get it to jell.  The first time I didn't peel or seed.  Worked fine and it's Christmas colors!  But I took it to work and every body loved it.

I did my own bit of modifying - 4 cups sugar instead of 6 and 3/4 cup of lemon juice because I am leery of the squash not being pressure canned I wanted to up the acidity.  I also subbed patty pan squash for the zucchini since I had a ton of it too (about 2/3rd of the 6 cups).  Also used a 20 ounce can of pineapple as that is what I had on hand.  I boiled mine on high for about 20 minutes and used an immersion blender to get the consistency regular.  Processed in sterilized hot jars in water bath for 5 minutes as recommended.  Product was tasty going in and they appear to be setting fine.  Now just have to watch for shelf stability.

Great jam for those with a sweet tooth. I only put 4 cups of sugar for 6 cups of zucchini, and it was delicious. 
You don't need pectin if using the right quantity of jello:  a 6oz box is the large box of jello (170g); the regular box of jello is 85 grams=3oz. If using the smaller box, you will need two boxes to make one recipe.

This recipe is good, never know zucchini is in it  I have made a bunch of it kids and everyone loves it.  Can't get it to set following this recipew ouldn't set tried it a few times just to make sure it wasn't a one time thing and they stayed very runny I was told by veteran canner that you have to add some pectin in it to get it to set right.  Not sure what I am missing but have followed the directions exactly and it always stays runny. Tastes good but comes out more like a Zucchini jelly soup.

This is a great and easy recipe. I did cut the sugar to 4 cups but that was the only change. Set up perfectly.

I had an abundance of zucchini and yellow squash. The zucchini I used for breads, so replaced the zucchini in this recipe with yellow squash.  I used mango jello I had on hand and used 4 cups sugar.  The flavor is great!!  I did have to cook a little longer than 30 minutes. I did use an immersion blender at the end, per another reviewer; however, I think it would have been prettier if I hadn't.  I'll name this 'Tropical Jam'.

I made peach, raspberry, and cherry. I love the cherry and raspberry, and at first I didn't like the peach until I had it with peanut butter. I did do an over pour for the lemon juice and the end product was still sweet and perfectly set. I made a double batch and then split it to make the three jellies/jam.  I'm looking forward to next season and trying other flavors including adding some chopped jalapeno into one. I did let the crushed pineapple drain overnight.

Very good, and easy. I cut the sugar by a cup, used peach jello, and ended up boiling for about an hour,  but excellent texture and taste.

Same recipe my grandma used, except she made it with apricot jello and kept it in the freezer. It is also good on ice cream! Grandma has the recipe boiling for 6 minutes.

This is a good recipe however a bit sweet. Also there is no way this makes 12 pints. I got only 9 1/2 pint jars and 1 1/4 pint jar.... which would be only 4 3/4 pints.

Delicious! I was very excited when I found this recipe while looking for some unique ways to use up some of my extra zucchini. My family loves this jelly. I have tried many different flavors but our favorites seem to be strawberry, cherry and grape. The younger ones seem to really enjoy the blueberry too.
Thank you for this recipe. I will be using it alot.

Wonderful!! EASY!!! People won't believe this is made with Zucchini! You can be creative with this, use different flavors of jello. I've made strawberry (my favorite), peach (not bad) and grape (imho - NASTY!! tastes like the mix for grape koolaid, no water, just the powder. But, I am not a big grape person, so you may like it). I'm not sure what the poster did who said you need to add pectin to this recipe it's plenty thick as is. It is runny when you can it, but after it sits it thickens up nicely. Think about how runny jello is when you first make it. I have noticed when I pull a jar out of my cabinet it is less firm than when I use it after it's been refrigerated. So no, DO NOT ADD PECTIN TO THIS RECIPE!! Otherwise you wont' be able to use it!!
