Delicious! I brought these to a party and everyone loved them.  The sauce is amazing just as it is.

DELICIOUS! I scaled the recipe back to make just enough for me to have for a light lunch, and it was perfect! The dressing is absolutely to die for, and that combined w/ the crunchy/salty bacon and the creamy avacado was just right...This is a definite keeper, for sure~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

The sugar candied, leaving large lumps in the sauce. Did I do something wrong? To my dismay, the result was barely edible. I suppose I will give it a second try at some point in the future.

In any case, I'm not sure this recipe is the best use of such quality ingredients. Combining two great things - avocado and bacon - sounded like a great idea, but topping two fatty ingredients with a butter-based sauce just went too far for my taste. I feel the dish needs something dynamic to counterbalance the overwhelming amount of fat.

I'm always looking for new ways to serve Avocado (a favourite in our house).  I tried this last night and it was AMAZING!  It was so good that I didn't even have time to take a picture - hubby was into it before I could put it on the table.  I will most certainly make these again.

I made this with no changes. It was delicious. The sauce was quite sweet so I may cut the brown suger next time. Definitely making this again.

I like the concept but I am not a fan of the sweet sauce. Squeezing fresh lemon juice into it helped cut the sweetness. I will try this again omitting the sugar and adding some lemon or lime juice. 
UPDATE: I have tried this recipe multiple times now. I found that reducing the amount of sugar instead of omitting completely makes a better sauce to me. I liked it more savory than sweet and didn't need to add any lemon or lime juice. I would give it 4 stars after making the sauce changes but will leave the rating for the recipe as written.

I had to substitute 3 tbs apple cider vinegar for the 1/4 cup red wine vinegar and it was fabulous.   definitely a keeper and I will likely stick with apple cider vinegar.
