I took advice from other reviews and added garlic and basil to the pasta before putting in dish.  I used whole grain penne instead of the ziti and reduced the amount.  I added ground beef as others had but also added chopped spinach to the ricotta mixture.  It was delicious and my family LOVED it.  I too recommend using extra sauce.  I warmed some and served it at the table so everyone could get the amount they wanted. Yummy!

With a few modifications, this recipe is perfect for a crowd! To combat potential blandness (as previous reviewers warned) I used an 8 oz can of spicy tomato sauce (RedPack brand) and an 8oz can of tomato sauce with garlic & onions. I also used spicy Italian sausage and through in a cup of fresh-chopped Basil.  I also used whole wheat pasta (Barilla plus) to add to the health factor. In response to other reviews, I found neither the white wine to be overwhelming nor the flavor to be too "tomato-y". This got rave reviews at my extended family's Easter buffet dinner.

This is a delicious and easy recipe, one I will be making again and again. I do have to agree with everyone who said that the recipe needs 2 jars of sauce, not one. After reading those reviews, I decided to be faithful to the recipe the first time I made it, and actually had to run out to buy another jar of sauce in the middle of cooking. I also recommend topping it with some fresh chopped basil before serving--it's a nice touch and adds some extra flavor!

yummy.  tastes like lasagna.  but i have to leave out the ricotta and egg since my husband doesn't like ricotta cheese.  I did everything as suggested except instead of spreading ricotta, I sprinkled that 6 italian shredded cheese mix you get at the store over the ziti noodles.  Thanks for a no-sour cream baked ziti.

What a hit this made!  I made it for a family with a 1 1/2 year old toddler and a 5 day old baby girl, to help them out as they're hands are full.  I made it in one of those tins so when they're done they can throw it away, and WOW!!  I added basil to the ricotta mixture, and ground turkey sauteed in garlic, onions and pepper, very yummy!  I couldn't use all of the pasta, however, maybe if I had a deeper dish, but I will make this for years to come, especially when I have a family of my own.  Thanks a lot!

Made it and my wife, brother-in-law, and buddy enjoyed it!  Everyone had a second helping.  After reading a few of the comments I also added the following:

browned 1 lb. of ground chicken

chopped/sauteed 1 yellow squash, 3 green onions, 1/2 white onion, 1 orange bell pepper, 1/2 green bell pepper

combined veggies and ground chicken and add to dish as an additional layer after pasta sauce

after baking, broil for 3 minutes then remove and top with chopped italian parsley

This dish was okay, a little dry though. I reccomend using 2 cups of sauce where it says 1. Also, the pasta is a little bland so i would add some salt pepper basil and garlic to it before i use it for the layers in the ziti. I will probably make this again with a few adjustments like i mentioned so it wont be as dry. It's a great recipe to build off of though.

I took the suggestion from one of the reviews to add extra sauce and it was delicious. I also added 1 lb hamburg and fresh basil, oregano and garlic to the sauce mixture. Its quite a large recipe, it would be great for large families and cheap too.

This tasted pretty good!  I added half a pound of ground beef (which I cooked with half an onion and a few teaspoons of minced garlic) to the sauce.  I seasoned the beef with basil, Creole seasoning, and seasoning salt.  I used  1 and 3/4 cups of tomato sauce (where it said 1 cup) and instead of ricotta cheese, I used cottage cheese.

I found this recipe today and made it for guests this evening as a side dish for Italian beef sandwiches.  Everybody loved it!  They kept telling me how great the pasta dish was!  It was so easy to prepare. I am going to keep this as a permanent part of my cooking "repertoire."

I made a few changes, but basically used this recipe as a reference. I browned a lb. of ground beef and then added a jar of spaghetti sauce. Cooked a package of ziti pasta. When pasta was al dente, I combined the pasta and meat sauce. Poured half of the pasta mixture in a pan, then the ricotta cheese mixture, and topped with the other half of the pasta mixture. For the ricotta mixture, I used Italian cheese mix (found in the grocery), added a clove of garlic, and seasoned with salt, pepper, oregano, basil. My guests raved - even the 7 and 8 year olds!

Oh dear - this needs help. Easy to make, but needs some flavor enhancing. I recommend adding at least 50% more sauce and as much as 50% more ricotta. I would also stir into the ricotta, a generous dose of dried oregano and basil and other favorite Italian spices. I added browned Italian sausage to mine.

Perfectly nice starter recipe -- inexpensive, quick, satisfying, reasonably healthful.  Taking advice from other reviews, I used 1.5 jars of sauce ... next time I'll use 2.  I tend to like my pasta fairly lightly sauced, but even with the extra half-jar it was slightly dry.  Also as per other reviews, I added minced garlic and some dried basil to the ricotta mixture, to richen the flavor.  For health reasons I used Eggbeaters rather than an egg, and Barilla multigrain pasta -- both seemed to work fine.  Altogether, results were quite pleasant, but next time I think I'll do more to it.  Meat would be an easy addition but I'm looking for healthy & satisfying meatless options to make our diet healthier, so I'm thinking about adding chopped onions and mushrooms and maybe squash or eggplant to the sauce, and maybe adding some chopped spinach to the ricotta mixture.  I think those would enhance the flavor nicely as well as adding nutrition.

This was really delicious and simple.  The only change I made was browning up ground beef and adding it to the sauce..gave it a great extra flavor and texture.  I will make this one again for sure.

This was great.  My daughter doesn't like ricotta so I mixed half whole milk ricotta and half Italian herb cooking cream from Philadelphia then added the egg, parmesan cheese and a good big pinch of Italian herbs.  I used "pizza cheese" instead of straight mozzarella and only used about half of what was recommended, but maybe a little more parm than was asked for.  And I added mushrooms to the pasta.  My daughter (who complained before trying it) ate two big helpings.  It was delicious, but I agree with others that it was a little dry.  Next time I'll use more sauce, maybe half again as much.

Not bad...it seems like it could have been more melty though. I took the foil off for the last 5 or so minutes so the top could get a little browned. Other than that, pretty good recipe!

This dish was delicious! =) I am 16 and made this for my parents. It was easy to make and I made some garlic bread puffs to go along with it. I made some adjusments: 1 1/2 jars of sauce, basil into the ricotta, and 1 package of ground beef and part of a link of turkey sausage. I browned the beef for 10 minutes and added the sausage. Then I let the meat and 1/2 a jar of sauce simmer for 15 minutes. I put it on the top and covered it in mozzarella and shredded parmesan. It was so good!

This is a great recipe!  I did make a couple small changes.  I added one pound of ground beef, browned with some garlic, then simmered the sauce with the beef.  I mixed the pasta and sauce together before I did the layers.  It didn't have to cook as long because it was already warm, just needed the cheese to melt.

A great recipe, but it definitely needs more sauce, as suggested - two jars would be plenty. It's very flexible, too - I added some minced garlic and parsley to the ricotta mixture. You could also add spinach, or even roasted veggies.

Delicious! I made it exactly as written but used my own, homemade sauce made with my own garden veggies and herbs, so there was plenty of flavor. I used a little extra sauce as some others suggested.

I loved this also. But it's better to find a smaller in size Ziti. I used the Creamette's brand & my pasta grew so big in size. It was so easy when putting it together.  I had left overs for 3 more nights. I made this on 4-7-10. When I told them {the kids }that we were having hamburgers. They asked for more of the Ziti from last night. Which cooks up better the next day. A small green salad, Garlic bread, & the smacking lips of a great meal. I'd give you 5 more stars for your rating. Thanks Paula Z.

Did it pretty much as instructed, but with only 2 layers of ingredients, used italian 6 cheese instead of mozzarella (and used quite a bit more than called for in the recipe, think that helped keep it from tasting dry) and added shredded chicken - it was phenomenal!

I've made this recipe several times since finding it a few months ago. My husband and I love it! I always halve the recipe since I'm just cooking for the two of us, and still always have lots of leftovers. We add about 1/2 lb. ground beef, oregano, garlic, basil and italian seasoning, using about 1/2 jar of sauce.  Usually serve it with a nice salad and garlic toast or breadsticks.  My daughter and her family love our leftovers!  Thanks so much for sharing this tasty recipe!

This is a good basic recipe.  You can jazz it up to your liking.  I added some extra sauce 1/2 jar more and some parsley into the ricotta.  All in all my family likes it and they are pretty fussy.

This was a good basic recipe - I needed a meatless main dish since we were having vegetarian guests, so I made this pretty much as is. The only difference was to use 2 jars of sauce instead of one, which is a must - it would have been way too dry otherwise. Thanks! ***UPDATE***I made this again the following week, and added a liberal amount of Italian seasoning and garlic powder to the ricotta mixture. It was much better! Otherwise, the ziti has a blandness problem.

Good base recipe that can be modified to individual taste.  I like to add fresh garlic and basil to kick it up a notch.  I think no matter what your taste preference, it needs more sauce though.  It is too dry and the sauce/cheese ratio just feels off as is.  I use about 1/2 of another jar of sauce.

This is a great basic recipe for baked ziti.  Since it is so easy and there are so few ingredients, it can be made as is (and still be delicious) or you can add to it.  I added some spinach to the recotta mix, as well as some basil and garlic. I would recommend always adding about 4 cloves of minced garlic because the flavor really stood out.  My family really enjoyed this one.

We thought this was very tasty. I added spicy sausage to the sauce as well as some defrosted chopped spinach. I added fresh basil to the ricotta cheese mixture, and used an Italian 3 cheese mixture in place of parm cheese. I too used more sauce than the recipe calls for. Thanks for a great recipe!

I used cottage cheese instead of ricotta and penne pasta instead of ziti. I divided it into 2 small pans and baked one for dinner tonight and put the other one in the freezer since i'm 38 weeks pregnant and it's going to be nice to have on hand after the baby comes. Thanks for the great and easy recipe!

An winner for a crowd. I used a mozzarella/provolone blend which was excellent.  Next time I will double the sauce and increase the ricotta. As long as the sauce is a flavorful one (add in spices if necessary), the dish will be perfect. But more sauce is key. And make sure that the pre-cooked noodles are boiled only until tender to avoid a squishy baked product!

I was thrilled to find a simple baked ziti recipe that called for ricotta, parmesan and mozzarella cheeses (not sour cream!). This is how my grandmother made baked ziti, and wanted to stick with those classic flavors. 

I have made this recipe several times and typically make two adjustments. First, I mash 6-8 homemade meatballs in the sauce. (Obviously, this means the recipe is no longer light, nor vegetarian, but it does add a lot of flavor.) Second, I add extra sauce - a cup or more - because it comes out a bit dry if you use only 28 ounces.

Bottom line: this baked ziti is quick, easy, delicious, and it's great for feeding a crowd.

This was very good.  My only adjustment was to add 1 lb. ground beef to the sauce.  I also used an extra 1/2 jar of sauce, but it was still too dry.  The flavors were good, so I will make again, but add at least 2 jars of sauce with 1 lb. beef.

4 stars before my alterations and 5 stars after. I added sauteed onion and ground beef and added that to the sauce, of wich I used 2 jars of. I also used almost double the amount of ricotta, to which I added Italian seasoning. It was delicious after my changes, but 4 stars go to the original recipe. Thanks for this one!

Sorry...I found it bland and dry, dry, dry.... Next time I will brown some sausage meat and add it to the layers, and double the sauce and ricotta cheese filling. Also add garlic, salt & pepper.

I made this recipe for my babysitters one night when my boyfriend and I had a date. I made it early. Threw some veggies in it and made some garlic bread and they loved it. There were no leftovers. And instead of spaghetti sauce i used alfredo sauce it was great!

Very good and easy to make.  I took advice from a few reviews and added italian seasoning, garlic powder and basil.  I also used 1 1/2 jars of sauce.

I made this recipe last night for dinner and it was a big hit...especially for my picky 6 yr old!  I didn't have any ricotta in the house so I just substituted it with cottage cheese and it was delicious.  I might add a little more sauce next time because we just like it a little saucier. Nice quick week night meal!

This is my first time really cooking from a recipe usually i improvise. This is a great base recipe. I did read the reviews about adding more flavor so i added garlic, and fresh basil and 1/2 cup of chopped frozen spinach (cooked in the microwave for 1 min.)

Very good with a little tweak. 
I added: 
* onion & garlic & basil
* 3 c. Mozzarella (an extra cup)
* & used a 45 oz jar of sauce (recipe calls for 28 oz) the rest I left the same as directed

I was going for meatless but next time I'll try adding 1 lb of ground sausage

This was a great recipe.  I did take the advice of other reviewers to add more sauce.  I also added ground beef, which I cooked and then added to the sauce before adding it to the casserole.  I also added more cheese because I like cheese.  This keeps VERY well in the fridge, and tastes great the next day!

Was very very very Yum! I tried to recipes as a way to use all my left over Lasagna/other past ingredients. Ended up using penne pasta and probably twice the cheese so I wouldn't have any left in the fridge to go bad. Turned out great. I think I'll actually make the real thing next time.

I added more cheese to give it more flavor.  I used romano because it is stronger and added it to each layer.  I do have to say that it tasted better the next day after. I just added some additional fresh romano and it was delicious.

Good recipe I agree with the others, but I used half Ricotta cheese and half cottage cheese along with the more sauce and it turned out great.  For sure a bigger pan

Wow, I was always interested in making baked Ziti and this recipe was a perfect starter recipe!  The meal was delicious and so easy.  When you need a good dinner during the week, and do not have time to make lasagna, baked Ziti is now an easier option.  =)  Great Recipe!

i tweaked this a bit--used homemade marina instead of jarred sauce, part-skim ricotta, and whole wheat pasta.  Let it stand for a few minutes when it comes out of the oven, so the pasta can absorb the bubbling sauce.  Very simple recipe and really tasty!

This turned out pretty good! I used whole grain penne and served it with bread and salad. I can see how some thought it was dry. It wouldn't hurt to add a little extra sauce but it is still good as is.

Pretty good-nice comfort food.  It could use a little more flavor somehow though.  I think next time I'll add some garlic or something to the sauce.  We loved how cheesy it was though and it was great as leftovers for lunch the next day.

This is a good 'meatless' recipe.  I found it a little dry so when I make it next I will definitely add more sauce. It is a hit with the kids! AND Easy to make!

Very easy and still very good! I added ground turkey with basil, oregano and Italian Seasoning.
