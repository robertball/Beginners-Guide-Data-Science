I halved this as it was just my daughter and I, and I used only blueberries since I didn't have any raspberries. I can only imagine how great this is with them! With just blueberries it was lovely. I love how quickly this comes together too. Thanks!

I used 3/4 cup each blackberries/half raspberries (that's what I had on hand), 1/4 cup of Splenda,  a little more water than called for (as I wanted it a little thinner) and I added a tablespoon of lemon juice. This was just sweet enough and made an excellent topping for fat free frozen yogurt.

good recipe.. I did have to tweak it a little because it wasn't thickening. I added some cornstarch to some cold water and threw that in. It thickened and was very yummy!!

We love topping our pancakes with fruit syrups and light whipped creme.  This is almost perfect-but missing a few simple ingredients.  It needs a tsp. of lemon juice and 1 TBSP. cornstarch added to 2 TBSP. water.  Add to the rest of the ingredient list, blend then heat the syrup and it will thicken.  It will be a syrup more in keeping for pancakes, ice cream topping, etc.  Otherwise you have a fruit topping that is absorbed by your pancakes rather than laying on top of them.  If you don't like seeds, mash, then strain the seeds, (that's a lot of  work though...)  Easy, Tasty, winner recipe.  Thanks!

This was a great recipe! I enjoy eating fruit syrups with my breakfast foods, but they can cost so much, and usually very limited in variety; this was a great save for my breakfast. I used mixed-berries and cherries in mine since that was what I had on hand, and it was delicious! I had to mash the cherries down because they were large, but I'm definitly adding this to my regularly used book.

This was easy and delicious.  I served it with homeade pancakes and whipped topping.  My family was floored.  Thanks for the recipe.  I used fresh berries and am now ready to try all kind of fruit.

Just tried this I was looking for a way to eat more blueberries. I used fresh blue berries and left out the raspberries but this was still great along with a little whipped cream.

Very good topping. I rated this a 4 stars based on original recipe; but, it's actually 5 stars with my adjustments. I used all fresh raspberries and blueberries, not frozen. I also squeezed fresh orange juice in place of the water. In addition to that I added the zest of the whole orange for more of an orange-y flavor. I found I had to add a little cornstarch to thickened up the sauce as it was too thin. The sauce is BERRYlicious - just sweet enough with a little "tart". The addition of the orange juice and zest gives this sauce a wonderful flavor. I am glad I thickened this up with cornstarch because it has the consistency I wanted. I also plan on using it over pancakes and for another dessert!

This was awesome. I used a combination of blackberries and raspberries because that's what I had on hand. I also followed the advise of another reviewer and added 1 T. of lemon juice and 1 T. of cornstarch disolved in 2T. of water. 
The only thing that detracted was all of the seeds. Next time I will run the syrum through a strainer at the end. Definately will be making often!

Such a simple recipe! I've made it with a combination of raspberries and blueberries and with blueberries alone. The recipe, as is, is great. With blueberries alone, you can add 1/2 tsp almond extract, a little splash of lemon juice (to replace the acidity that the raspberries would give) and a little cinnamon. Nomnom!

Great basic recipe!  I used only blueberries - fresh not frozen.  I washed the blueberries, drained, but used still wet - then added the water too.  Yum!  During the summer I'll try it with the mix of blueberries and raspberries.

I didn't get to use this on pancakes. We put it on ice cream and wow it was delicious. I will definitely make this again. Maybe this time we can try on pancakes or even waffles.

I started making this sauce thinking I had raspberries but actually had only strawberries  and blueberries. So I separated them. Made a half batch of blueberry and strawberry sauce individually using this recipe. 1 cup of blueberries, 1/4 cup of sugar and 2 tbsp's of water. Did the same thing with the strawberries. Came out perfect! Also I used it on french toast instead of pancakes. YUM!

I used fresh instead of frozen as they are both in season. I love this topping! It's not sweet like syrup and the flavor is fabulous! Doubled the recipe (I had lots of very ripe raspberries) and froze some. Delish on pancakes!

Tried this today with a bag of frozen blueberries and raspberries. I cut the sugar to about a quarter cup and that was perfect since the fruit has a ton of sugar in it already. I will be making this every time I decide to make pancakes in the future. Thanks for sharing!

A sweet topping for pancakes, and i convinced myself it was healthier than syrup since it was made from fruit and not pure sugar.

I made this using 2 1/2 c. blueberries, 1 T cornstarch and 1 T lemon juice.  I put the blueberries, sugar and cornstarch in a pan, mixed that, then added the water and lemon juice.  I then followed the rest of the recipe instructions.  The flavor was excellent. However, it was a bit thinner than I liked. I will try adding more cornstarch next time. This is definitely a keeper recipe!

So yummy! The addition of lemon juice adds just the right amount of zing! And adding a bit of cornstarch helped to thicken it nicely. Thanks for a keeper recipe!!

Just a touch to sweet but otherwise great. I liked that it wasn't super thick. It was perfect as a syrup for waffles.

Very tasty and so easy to make.  The amount of sugar is perfect; not overly sweet.

I put it in a pyrex casserole bowl and baked it for 30 min. at 375.  I did add 1 Tbs of corn starch also.  It thickened while sitting awhile

it was great in flavor, but I just didn't know raspberries had so many seeds. If it wasn't for the seeds, I would have given the rating 5 stars.

I actually made this to top a cheesecake with and it was perfect.  Nice tart/sweet combination.  I am so glad that I have some left over to put on tomorrow morning's pancakes.  Will definitely use this recipe for many things- pancakes, waffles, french toast, ice cream..... Thanks!

I made this topping over vanilla sponge cakes for a dessert.  I halved the recipe and threw in a few blackberries to add a little tartness. I used fresh raspberries, blueberries and blackberries.  I boiled it for 3 minutes and then simmered on low for 5 minutes.  Pour it over the individual sponge cakes and then top with homemade whipped cream.  (Wholefoods sells a whipped cream they make, its delicious.)  My husband was very impressed.  This recipe is very simple and will make any novice in the kitchen look like Emerald! BAM!

Followed recipe, did a mixture on side of 2tbs water, 1 cornstarch and 1 lemon juice after reading a few comments on here, added half as wasn't quite thickening. Unfortunately I made blueberry pancakes from the site.. Todd's .. I threw them away as they were not edible. Had a bit of this sauce left, put it on toast, delicious, will use this again when I find a decent pancake recipe.

This was a super easy, quick, delicious topping that thickened up nicely. Giving it 5 stars even though I cut the sugar to 1/4 cup, because I cut the sugar in everything I make AND I don't think this recipe would be too sweet with the amount of sugar called for, just too sweet for us!

Used fresh berries instead of frozen and served over french toast.  I think this could be tweaked a bit to be a 5-star recipe (at least for us), but it's still very good as written.

I have never made a comment or rating on a recipe that I had to make a change or two before since I feel the rating is not accurate.  I just had to this time, I only had blueberries (fresh) and not a single change needs to made to this recipe.  It is the most delicious pancake topping that I have ever had.  There is absolutely no need for any thickeners at all as long as you completely follow the recipe and directions as stated.  My family will continue to use this recipe and thank you for sharing.

My husband and kids absolutely loved this topping.  I found it to be a bit too sweet for my taste though.  Next time, I will definitely make two separate batches, one with half the sweetness requested.

So Yummy: Better than just syrup and better that having the berries mixed in the pancake batter. I just made this topping and my husband and I  just love the berries on top of the pancake. I made one little change. I didn't have sugar on hand so I used a No-High Fructose Corn Syrup and at the end I did mix in a TB.spoon of cornstarch. Had a lot of flavor:  It's So000! Goo00D !!!

For a healthier recipe, omit the sugar. And you don't need water either.  I just put the frozen berries in a bowl in the microwave and heat them up and pour them over waffles or pancakes.

This was so easy to make and delicious! I used 2.5 cups of fresh, hand-picked blueberries. I added 2 tsp of white flour to help thicken, but honestly I didn't even wait to see if it would be needed. This turned out perfect and I look forward to making again. 

I used this to top "Whole Wheat Blueberry Pancakes" also from this website.

This stuff is amazing!   Definitely add a generous squeeze of fresh lemon juice and the corn starch. This thickens up nicely in the pan (no heat) as you do other things.

I made this topping for my parents on Parent Appreciation Day, and they loved it. It was cheaper for us to buy a blend of all the berries then the separate raspberries and blueberries, so our version also had blackberries and strawberries. We also didn't add as much sugar which worked out fine.

Loved it as is.  I only added frzn strawberry because it was in the mix.  Mashed fruit while simmering, a few times.  I didn’t mind the sauce being slightly on the thinner side.  Thank you for posting.

Simple and easy. I only simmered it for 7 minutes rather than 10, because it got very thick (like a jelly) and I didn't want it to get any thicker or burn.

My 11 year old made this while i made  paleo pancakes. Very easy.  We swapped the sugar for rice malt syrup as we are trying to reduce our sugar intake. It worked well. Perfect on pancakes. Probably even on vanilla icecream or as an accompaniment with Pana cotta or Creme brule.

This recipe is VERY sweet, if that's what you want you will love it. It thickened well and everything but I like my topping a little more tart, so I will reduce sugar to 1/4 next time. That's just a matter of opinion though, other than that, a good recipe.

Mixed frozen berries from Sam's Club, and this was fabulous. Just what I was looking for for a potluck breakfast at work. It was more work FINDING this recipe than MAKING it!!! Making for the 2nd time today, and it won't be the last time, I'm certain.

Super easy to make, but it was a little sweet for me. I strained mine to get rid of the seeds, and used a frozen mixed berry bag. I might cut the sugar down a little next time, but will definitely make again.

I made this sauce to use as a cheesecake topping and it was delicious! After a quick taste in the final few minutes of cooking, I did follow other reviewers' suggestions and added 1 Tbsp lemon juice as well as 1 Tbsp cornstarch. Fabulous recipe! Will definitely make this again!

I love this sauce! It reminds me of some sauces they serve at IHop. I saw others' reviews and did add 1 tsp of lemon juice and (1 TBs of cornstarch after it reached the boiling point) and I'm sure it made the difference!

I surprised my wife on Mother's Day, with the easy recipe. It is complimented the blueberry pancakes perfectly. It's sweet, but the blueberries add a little tartness to the spread. My wife and I will be making this again!

This was pretty good.  I did add 1 tbsp of lemon juice with some cornstarch to thicken it up.  Although my husband liked the sweetness, I thought it was a bit too sweet.  It went well with homemade Belgian waffles.

Used 6 cups of mixed frozen berries from frozen state (blueberries raspberries, blackberries, and strawberries), 1/2 cup sugar, 3 Tbsp cornstarch (dissolved in 1/4 - 1/2 cup water), 1/4 cup water, 1 Tbsp lemon juice and simmered until thickened.  Absolutely delicious.

Just cooked this up and tasted it. All I can say is YUM! It tastes fantastic all by it self. Not too tart, not too sweet. Having it for dinner tonight with Buttermilk Pancakes II from this site. I like the fact it has less carbs than regular pnacake syrup in the bottle that you'd get from the grocer.

Oh my goodness! This was fantastic!!
I only had fresh fruit so I used that. The amount of sugar was perfect. It was slightly tart. Even my 4 and 6 year old gobbled it up. I made it with the Fluffy Pancake recipe off this site.
If I were to make one criticism, I would add a bit of cornstarch to thicken it a bit more. 
I would give it 6 stars if I could!! Thank you thr33things for submitting!

I just made this recipe for waffle topping. It's wonderful! I used fresh blueberries and raspberries in the amounts listed above and the sauce thickened up with no problem. My husband, who doesn't much like to try new things, loved it.

Delicious.  I used blueberries and rasberries as called for, and I would make it again.  The only difference is I would add a little more water as I like it a little bit thinner.  The kids loved it (besides my daughter not eating whole blueberries), she even ate it.

Love how easy this is; it was a nice (healthier) change from syrup for my French toast! Fresh blueberries were all the fruit I had, and I did think it was better with the addition of a little lemon juice - likely not necessary if raspberries are included - as well as some almond extract and cinnamon. Thanks for the recipe!

sounds wonderful, but for tose of us who are dibetic, use sugar free syrup as a base for your fruit syrup,, it really is wonderful
