Awesome smell when cooking!  Also makes fantastic pizza crust!  Just use a generous amount of flour when rolling out!  Use lite beer, any brand as it all tastes the same when baked, for a few less calories.  The biscuts that taste great... AND less filling!  Big Scott

This is an excellent recipe!  Instead of beer, I used a Scottish Ale, and served these marvelous biscuits with blue cheese.  It made an excellent appetizer.  One tip to avoid hard biscuits:  Make sure you follow the directions and preheat the oven to 450 degrees and do not over knead the dough.  These biscuits will come out nice flakey, and savory.

I enjoyed the ease, flavor and texture of these biscuits. Next time I am going to try baking them touching each other in a 9inch round cake pan and brush them with melted butter for more color.

I made this again, and again they're excellent.  If yours are too hard, perhaps you used too much flour?  They need to be a little sticky when you cut them.  I went easy on the flour when cutting too.  I wonder if it's the choice of shortening too...  I used Crisco's no trans fat (the green can).  They are not hard at all, though they are not "brown".  These are the best I've tried.  I did put some cornmeal on my pizza stone just in case of sticking.  These are really great.

The buscuits were good, but you could certainly taste the beer.  I used a light beer, but the taste was still prominent.

Very easy to make. I will make them again, but will use less beer than the recipe calls for. My family thought the taste was a little too strong, but gobbled them down nonetheless.

This is a really great biscuit - simple, with a flavor on its own, without over powering other flavors when served with a meal or soup.  I used this as an oven baked casserole topping once... very delicious!

I used a full cup of Blue Moon Ale, brushed the tops with butter, and these turned out delicious.  My whole family loves them, even my husband, who isn't much of a bread eater, had thirds!  My kids said to use this recipe from now on.  Guess its a keeper!

This also makes a great pizza crust.  Just flatten the dough and viola.  Very versatile recipe can also be used to make a loaf of bread any way you wanna shape it it will hold up.

I made these with Miller High life this morning and substituted coconut oil for the shortening.  They turned out very flaky with less fat than most biscuit recipes, which is exactly what I was looking for.

I've made beer biscuits before, and expected these to turn out much the same - tasty, but very dense.  Instead, I prepared these exactly as directed and found them to be much lighter than anticipated.  I used a very light beer (Tecate) and absolutely minimized the blending and kneading process.  I also used fresh baking powder and baked them for only 12 minutes and did not attempt to brown them.  Very good.

I made these for dinner last night (St. Patrick's Day) and I used a pale Irish ale in them. I added a teaspoon of garlic powder, as well...I'll make these again, but I'll probably reduce the salt to 3/4 of a teaspoon. I didn't roll these out, instead I patted them out to about an inch in thickness and cut them out with a rock glass...perfect size. The beer and baking powder make them rise up beautifully. Thanks for this recipe...it's going to be a fun one to play around with.

Instead of beer I use milk.  Yummy!  I use these biscuits for everything now.  I've made just plain, cheese and chive, topping for chicken pot pie, and chicken-n-dumplings.

I used slightly more shorting (1/3 cup) and slightly more beer (1 1/4 cup).  I used a pumpkin ale and it gave the biscuits just a hint of something sweet.  I've also used a ginger beer (Good Juju). YUM!

Great biscuits- fluffy with a nice mild beer taste (I used a local beer.) I used butter instead of shortening.  I brushed the tops with a little melted butter and they browned nicely. I rolled mine a little thicker and got 8 biscuits.

These were really good, but a bit dry. Nothing some butter or honey can't fix though! I'm not sure how to remedy the moisture in the biscuit dough though. My biscuits were about 2 inches round and took 6 minutes.  Will make these again though, the flavor was fantastic! I used a dark Irish stout and the beer is very subtle in this biscuit.

First, the changes I made: I replaced the 1/4 cup shortening with 3/8 cup of margarine. I added around 2 tablespoons of maple syrup (but I didn't end up tasting it). I also made these drop biscuits b\c I'm a lazy person.

I used Leinenkugel's Red Lager as my beer. I was very pleasantly surprised with how these turned out! They are a little on the salty side but I think it really works. Some reviewers found the biscuits to be rather dry - and I could see how that could happen but the margarine (and upped dosage) really helped! These have a very buttery taste. I ate them with chili and they were great! Now I can't wait to slather some whipped honey on them to see how they taste with that!

While I could taste the beer, I found it to be rather subtle. The beer flavor intensifies as they cool but I think even a beer-loather could appreciate the layer of complexity it adds to the flavor. All in all, a worthy Saturday morning breakfast treat!

Great! I think I will make some personal pizzas later with this as the dough -- the beer flavor (I used PBR) goes very nicely with sauce.

I am only giving three stars but I think my downfall might have been user error. I followed the recipe exactly, but my biscuits did not rise. They taste GREAT! But they are more like crackers or tea biscuits. I will try again.

Good recipe, didn't have shortening so I used butter instead. Should have made it thicker than 1/4 inch but overall very tasty.

I made these with my husband's home brewed wit beer, they turned out a little dry and tasted like saltine crackers.  I think they might be better if made with a lager or something a little maltier.

Used unsalted butter in place of the shortening ... VERY good. These went really well with gravy for breakfast. Bake time ended up being 14 min instead of 10 - 12.

These came out so light flaky! This is practically a fool proof recipe. I made this with my 8 year old so we ended up just throwing everything in the bowl and mixing it together at once (I added a tad more beer to make them drop biscuits). Great addition to my lunch soup.

I love this as a biscuit,but its not really a beer biscuit. You can't tast the beer at all. It might be better with a darker beer. I used Blue Moon,a Wheat Ale.

These were very easy, I added some dry dill for a little more flavor.  It must be my oven but mine took closer to 20 minutes.  Will be making again

I made these last night to finish off our Chuckwagon Stew and they turned out great. I made them about an inch thick so I only got 8 biscuits out of the mix. They puffed up nice and high. I only kneaded it a little bit, enough to lay it out and cut them out. I used Coors lite because that is all we had in the house,but you can still taste the beer in the biscuits. Yummm,Thanks for the recipe.

We made these last night to go with a hearty beef stew.  This is a great simple recipe.  They don't rise very much but they taste great.

I added 1/4 cup sugar and cut the salt to 1/4 tsp.  I cut the beer to 1/3 cup and added 1/3 cup milk (2/3 cup liquid in total).  The biscuts had just a hint of beer flavor and turned out great!

I really enjoyed this recipe I used 60g salted butter instead of shortening and ommited the added salt.  

They turned out perfect.  We had them at breakfast with jam and for dinner I sliced them in half and used them to make mini pizzas they were a hit both ways.

I was very disappointed with this recipe's taste and consistency.  My boyfriend would have beer with or in every meal if possible, he LOVES the flavor of beer.  Personally I don't but I thought I would give this a try for him. The taste was so bad that he only ate one and I only ate half of one and we threw the rest away. (biscuits are his favorite breakfast food and he usually eats 3 or more) The texture was interesting, a bit more chewy and dense than the biscuits I usually make. In the end I gave them 3 stars because they were easy to make (I didn't even roll them out just patted the dough in my hand to the right size). My boyfriends verdict was not to mess with a good thing so from now on I will make my old recipe.

Fair. I bake a lot, used a convection oven and  I followed the recipe exactly as described. The biscuits did not brown well. The bottoms were browned nicely but had the flavor and texture of a cracker. The inside was moist but not buttery and flaky. There was definitely a yeasty   flavor from the beer (I used HARP LAGER). I was making biscuits and gravy so they were fine for that recipe but I wouldn't rely on them as a stand alone bread for breakfast or dinner. With butter they are a little better but still nothing to write home about. Probably won't try this recipe again. Skip the mess and pop open a can of Grands Biscuits instead. This is certainly not the recipe you want if you are looking for a "grandma's homemade biscuit".

These are awsome.  I made these lastnight to send with my fience on a hunting trip to eat with sausage gravy.  We couldn't help but try a few and we both agreed that these will be made all the time.  I can't wait to make more.  This recipe was very easy to make and I made it in no time.  Thank you soooooo much for this recipe.

The only reason I gave this recipe four stars is because they didn't rise quite as much as I would have liked.  Otherwise they were light, flaky and delicious.  I tried them with chicken and gravy and as breakfast with honey and jam.  This recipe is a keeper

Followed the recipe exactly.  Rolled to 1/2 inch, they rose to maybe an inch.  Not really what I was hoping for.  Taste was fine, but I'd hardly call them 'biscuits'

Not bad, but they didn't rise as well as I would have liked, and tasted a bit salty. I'll probably try them again using a different flavor of beer.

When in doubt use less salt!  This receipe is very easy and stands up well to a stew or bean dish.  It is not a buttermilk biscuit so don't try to compare and you may like it for what it is . . . an easy receipe when you are short of time.

My husband and I loved these biscuits even more than the beer bread I make. I served them up with beef stew for dinner and cut them into heart shapes. It was a big hit with the family. I will be making this recipe again.

These were very good. I did modify the recipe a little. I used a cup of unsalted butter instead of shortening. 1/4 cup of fat didnt seem like it was going to be enough and they turned out great. i only gave it 4 stars because i wish they would have risen more. still great anyway. i will make them again.

This is a great recipe. My boyfriend says they are the best he has ever had and he's 52! I doubled the recipe and used a vegan butter spread rather than the shortening. By increasing the dough I was able to make the biscuits thicker and still have plenty for everyone.

These had a great store-bought biscuit texture; I could pull it apart the way you do the Pilsbury Grands, layer by layer.  It's lacking in flavor, so next time will try making with butter or butter flavored shortening.

The beer is just too strong of a presence and normally I love beer. It seems this biscuit took the bad tastes in beer and magnified them. The aftertaste was salty and bitter. Will not use again.

I agree with others in that for one, these were pretty bland, and two, the taste of beer really comes through (which for me, wasn't a bad thing).  I added finely shredded cheddar and some garlic powder to give this more ooomph (without succeeding) and was forced to add more beer as the dough was nowhere near the consistancy it needed to be.  Made these as drop biscuits and they paired well with the roast beef hash leftovers I had.  Thanks for the recipe.

These were really salty. I did use butter instead of shortening, but I can't imagine it made them this salty. Next time, I think I will substitute self-rising flour for the all-purpose flour with baking powder and salt.

Very easy recipe to make- As always it's better to check the reviews.  I've made this twice; once exactly as the recipe called for, once with more shortning and less salt.  When made exactly as the recipe the buscuits come out very dry and tastless.  Still a better taste then the biscuits in the fridgerated section, though.  Good with a sausage gravy or hamburger gravy. I used a full bodied lager because that is what I had on hand both times, so the biscuits had a very deep flavor.  I'm not sure how you'd get them to rise more because both ways they were pretty flat.  I added a star for how easy this recipe is.

Quite a good recipe, but needs some changes:
1. Cut the salt by half
2. Increase the shortening a bit - an extra tablespoon
3. Use lemonade instead of beer.  This avoids problems with taste and makes the biscuit light, moist and fluffy.

This recipe worked great and was easy even for me, and I have not made biscuits in over five years! They were delicate, flaky and delicious.

These were light and crumbly. My husband & I agreed next time we use a dark beer. I used butter flavored shortening & they tasted better with butter. These would be great with sausage & gravy.

We really liked these, although they aren't as fluffy as other biscuits.  
The best part was that my son who's allergic to dairy and eggs could actually eat a biscuit with the rest of us!

My only carb vice is bread and with every Sunday dinner, I need to splurge! These were great, altho I nixed the salt. While baking, I brushed with a little melted butter and some parm. Delish and thank you Miss Lisa!!

These are terrific biscuits. I cut them with a small cutter, then baked them in the toaster oven, my cutter made 23 biscuits, so it took two batches to get them baked, but it browned them nicely at 400F. They smelled yeasty coming out of the oven, and the beer taste is mild. They baked up nice and light.

I thought that these were really tasty. I used PBR and found the beer flavor perfect. I followed the recipe exactly and found that the dough was too sticky to roll out, so I made drop biscuits instead. Next time, I'll add enough flour for rolling. Thanks!

This was pretty good. I substituted half of the flour with whole wheat and used it as a pizza crust. It came out crisp on the outside and chewy on the inside. It was a little bland but had a slight beer taste. I used Budwiser. I will use it next time I have any leftover beer around.

Good enough for my clan! Love that it doesn't call for ingredients I don't usually have on hand. The beer adds an unusual and distinct flavor. I'll probably make these again if I'm in an ingredient bind.

this recipe came out very yummy, crisp on outside moist on inside . I adjusted to make a half recipe but ended up having to add a lil more flower than it said for only 6 servings and I used redds apple ale instead of normal beer. I would definitely make again!

Made these for Easter dinner, and everyone RAVED about the dinner rolls!  Easy recipe that makes a tasty addition to any meal.  I'm going to add sugar, and almond extract and see how the recipe works for strawberry shortcake!

i shouldn't have erred on the side of caution.. after reading the negative reviews i was worried that the biscuits would be salty.. so i omitted the salt and they came out very in need of salt.. im guessing there's some kind of super salty butter out there.. either way these were nice and fluffy and i'm serving them with gravy anyway.. ty for the recipe.. i'm going to try making these again tomorrow and will post my true review then.. UPDATE: they weren't salty to us.. they just tasted like a rich buttery biscuit.. sorry for doubting you in the first place! just a side note, we used natural light for the beer

I was really excited to make these, but they didn't turn out well. They didn't rise much and they were very very salty and the beer taste was really strong. I don't think I'll try the recipe again, sorry.

This recipe did not rise as well as I would have hoped. It's just OK. It just tastes like a typical Non Buttermilk recipe as far as I can tell.  Next time I'll just make one of those recipes or buy some buttermilk and not waste a good beer.

Caution, I used low carb beer and my recipe was horrible. My goof. I thought it was too strong in flavor and not fluffy. probably due to the beer I used.

OMG, These are sooo good, light and flavorful. I used baking soda because I didn't have any baking powder, and they came out fine. I also added a little extra beer. Man, these things are good.

Came out nice and fluffy but wouldn't brown.  Or at least I just took them out after waiting 15 minutes for them to bake.  Just like those biscuits you find at the mexican restaurants.  Smelt like the beer and left slight after tastes tho.  Maybe it was just the german beer i had lying around the house for the onion ring batter.  A bit stronger than your average beer.

I'm trying to be nice, but this was the worst recipe that I have ever tried.  I followed it exactly, and they came out salty and hard, with a terrible taste.  We had to throw them out.  Definatly not like other biscuits we have had.

It wasn't very good. The texture was fine but the flavor was kind of bland. Maybe if I used a different kind of beer. I used the only beer I had in the house, Guinness.

This was a great recipe.  I liked the slight beer taste to the biscuits.  They were moist and fluffy.  Definately a keeper.

These were good but nothing really special. Easy to make, but just lacked the flavor I was expecting. Might make again...was nice for a dinner biscuit.

These are great biscuits to dunk in soup!  They have a mild, but noticeable beer taste.  My family loved these with clam chowder.  Not a fluffy biscuit, but very delicious.
