I didn't make the cookies myself, but I sure  did eat them. In addition to the sheer deliciousness, I loved all the different textures you get in every bite. So good!

This was a really unique cookie and it was well received at a gathering. I, too, reduced the amount of sugar. I also added a mix of white and brown sugars to the meringue to help it whip up to a stiffer consistency. I loved how the meringue shattered as you cut into these.

i decided to try this recipe based on a fellow  Allstar's review. I did tweak the recipe a bit based on her  comments, which i think worked out great in the end.
I cut the sugars in half, and added a 1/2 tsp of cream of tartar to help stabilize the meringue. 
The meringue did turn out nice and chewy, breaking upon cutting which I expected from a meringue.

I was very excited to try this recipe when i saw it. when i read the recipe i thought it may be very very sweet, given the ratio of sugar to flour. i was right. these are make your teeth hum, sweet.  i also thought that the meringue would be on the chewy side, it was not. it stayed soft.  while the flavour of the cookie base is good, it is way to sweet for me.
