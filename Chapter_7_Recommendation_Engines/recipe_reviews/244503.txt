We followed the recipe exactly except for adding a BIT more sauce towards the end. We re sauce people. We like to have a lot of it. My teens thought it was a bit spicy but my husband and I thought it was perfect! Everyone enjoyed it and we will make it again.

Really fast really easy really tasty! Except for the fresh parsley which I keep growing by the back door everything is a pantry item. Dinner was ready in a flash.
