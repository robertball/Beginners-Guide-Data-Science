YUMMY!!! I have been looking for a Jalapeno sauce for my fish tacos and this is a true winner. I added a touch of cayenne powder and it gave it a great kick. Now that I have a container full, guess I have to make some enchiladas now. Thanks for the recipe. It is a keeper.

Easy recipe loaded with flavor. Served it over grilled shrimp with Mexican spices, diced avocado and rice. I know I'll make it again.

Feel free to scoff, but I was looking for a different sauce to dip tater tots in. : )  (This is what happens every time I watch “Phantom Gourmet,” I get incentive to try one of the concepts.)  I let the mixture sit for a couple of hours in the refrigerator to allow the flavors a chance to meld.     Success, it worked splendidly.

This was good but not much heat.  Might leave some of the seeds in next time.  Also might try replacing some of the sour cream with mayo to enhance the flavor.  Worked well on fish tacos.

I made this yesterday for a 4th of July BBQ. Everyone loved it! One of the girls at the BBQ loved it so much! She put it on everything she ate!! I also used fresh garlic instead of garlic powder. Very good sauce!

Great sauce for topping tostadas. This will probably be best on fish tacos.
