OMG This is amazing.  My husband and I loved it and it is so easy to make.  I used Healthy Request Cream of Chicken and did not change the recipe at all.  Total comfort food.  This will be on a regular rotation.

Simple and easy enough to put together but it really needs some extras. I used cream of mushroom soup instead of cream of chicken, and added about 3/4 cup of 2% milk. I added two cloves of minced garlic to the onions and added salt and pepper. After the adjustments this recipe had much more flavor.

Was very good and quick.  I added cream cheese, a couple garlic cloves, 1/2 can white wine and some milk along with green onions.  Also sprinkled a little Italian Dressing dry mix on chicken and into skillet.

It was easy and fast to make. I followed the recipe exactly like it is. I felt the sour cream overpowered the dish. Next time I will cut back on the sour cream.

Very simple to do and came out smooth and tasty. We prefer a bit more sour cream, but you always change recipes to taste.
