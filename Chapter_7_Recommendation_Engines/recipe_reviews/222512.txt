As the recipe is written, for my family's taste, it rates 4 stars.  After making it as written once, I tweaked it to suit our tastes better--I omitted the basil and cilantro (I LOVE both of those herbs, just not in this salad) and I use white balsamic vinegar (it is not as overpowering in this salad).  With just the mint, it is wonderful!  I have also made the dressing with and without the lime juice based on what I had, and we like it both ways.  This is a wonderful recipe--summer-y, fresh and unexpected.  This is always a hit when I take it to get-togethers, especially with the people who thought they'd hate it.

Excellent recipe, ingredients go well together, light and fresh, can even be used as desert.  We modified and did not add onion.

I made the recipe as is with the exception of using fresh basil.   I used freeze dried basil instead but I cut down the quantity.  I did have fresh mint and cilantro.  I also used a feta cheese that is stored in brine and I cut the block into cubes.  My guests loved it. Several women asked for the recipe. I will definitely keep this in my summer repertoire.

Weird combos excite me!  And this truly is odd, but I loved it!  We always have leftover watermelon...only 2 of us...anyway was searching for something to do with the rest of it and found this!  Such a great summer time salad...for those hot nights, served with leftover cold grilled chicken and it's a meal!

This salad was amazing, I made it the first time twice because my husband did not want the dressing on it. Since posting a pic on FB I have had 5 requests for it. I did everything exact ( not like me ) Didnt have mint, but will definetly get the next time.

Delicious; however - important to note that it's one of those salads that should be tossed RIGHT before serving. mmmm

Love this. It is so easy, and it's always a big hit. I don't use cilantro (my husband and I both don't like it) and I use an expensive balsamic vinegar that's more syrupy, almost like a reduction. I do add the lime. It's so fresh and summery - perfect complement to everything else we serve when we BBQ with friends.

Yes I just tried this recipe. It was a huge success. I'd almost call it a watermelon salsa. Yummy many wonderful flavours.  People are asking me to bring it to the next get together.

I put the cut pieces of watermelon in a colander to drain before assembling the salad. The dressing was made and onions cut up the night before but I cut the melon and herbs just before taking to a potluck.

Skipped the red onion, cilantro, and lime juice. Just combined watermelon cubes with olive oil, crumbled feta cheese, mint leaves, and a balsamic reduction. In retrospect, the mint tastes better than the basil and should use entirely mint without basil.

Made this salad last night for a summer dinner party & it was a HUGE hit! Everyone wanted the recipe. The only thing I changed was to finely dice the onion instead of slicing.

I love this salad! Every time I eat it, I become a bit more thankful for small blessings. When I first saw it, I thought hmmm, that's so weird I have to make it. It was so yummy it inspired weird salad night. Now all my friends on Facebook can't wait to see what I'm going to try next. No changes, no modifications- it's perfect. Thanks for sharing.

I cut back on the cilantro.  Best to make  and immediately serve.  Good tip to use cold water melon
It was a hot day and the guests loved it.

This turned out pretty well. I didn't have fresh basil, so I used basil paste, which I don't think changed the flavor, though the salad didn't turn out as pretty. I will also try a better watermelon (mine was pretty watery). I will make this recipe again!

This was delicious and I am not even a big fan of feta cheese. I did add an extra TBS of balsamic.  I used half Honey Ginger balsamic vinegar and half regular balsamic.

Great as is!  I   seldom just follow recipes, even those by master chefs.  This one works, counter to my intuition.  Just drizzle the vinegar and oil.

Made this for a party and everyone loved it.  I made a couple of changes because I am a fanatic about good olive oil and thick, aged balsamic.  Used blood orange olive oil and probably at least double the amount of aged balsamic.  Truly a delicious recipe!

Nope, not for me.  I had a couple people at my barbecue this  summer who did enjoy it which is why I am giving it two stars.  My boyfriend took a bite and spit it out (I didn't think it was THAT bad).  I always like trying something new, so thanks for sharing, but I will be passing on this one in the future.

This is really quite good. Dried mint (home grown and dried) and basil will do in a pinch; or in my case, laziness this time.

Interesting taste and I love a surprise taste combo! Too many herbs though.... I had lots left in the empty bowl after the salad was dished up which didn't stick to the other ingredients. I intend to halve the herbs next time.

It is just my husband and I. We like all the items it called for. I admit some of the ingredients recipe called for you may think it doesn't seem it would taste good. It was delicious. Only thing is if you do not eat salad on the first day it would become watery. so make sure you make just what you are going to eat.

I made a small, one-bowl salad for myself, and it was a refreshing and filling lunch on a hot summer day. I skipped the cilantro and sprinkled the top with a little dried basil. I've been buying very good quality balsamic vinegar lately, and it really makes a difference in any salad. I can see adding kalamata olives, as well. Nice salad!

This was a unique side at a summer party. It was very tasty but the mint and basil overwhelmed the cilantro. I may cut that out next time.

This salad is amazing! Very refreshing, perfect for a summer picnic. And something about the combination of flavors really brings out the sweetness of the melon. Made as written, except did not use the cilantro as I didn't have any and I d I didn't measure anything except the oil and vinegar.

Refreshing summer salad!  I made a couple modifications:  no cilantro as I don't like it, and instead of all that fresh basil, I just sprinkled some dried over the watermelon.  The unexpected meshing of the flavors make for a great tasting salad.  This is a hit at our house.

Made exactly as is many times with great success and always get asked for this recipe. Only sub was red onion with sweet one - my preference. Adjust herbs to your own liking but fabulous as is! Thanks for a great summer salad recipe.

I was skeptical but made it like it said and was amazed at how well everything just worked!  Had a friend over and he liked it so much he took the recipe home.  My husband and I could not stop eating it; will make again on the 4th of July gathering!  I had a lavender balsamic  I had not used in awhile so that is the balsamic I used.  It's a keeper for sure!

Refreshing! That's how I can describe this salad. I was intrigued by the combination of ingredients, and was not disappointed. I made it as directed, and I really loved the combination of fresh herbs, the saltiness from the feta cheese and the sweet watermelon. Great summer salad!

So good! Deliciously sweet and savory and so full of tastes! I've made this twice now and never really measure. I love balsamic so I Up that ratio. Rather than all those herbs I sub arugula.

This is simply the ultimate summer salad!  I would have never imagined things like watermelon, feta, balsamic vinegar and cilantro EVER going together in one dish...this knocked my socks off!  I've made it several times now and I've taken several of them to get together, there is never anything left for me to schlep home afterward!

This is sooo good and very refreshing.  Great with a quiche or something else that is light.  I would suggest you not try to make this an entree; it doesn't lend itself to protein.  Use it as a side salad.

There are way too many herbs in this dish. I did not like the texture or the flavors together at all. Next time I will try a different recipe.

Very easy, and adaptable. I didn't have mint on hand so it was omitted, and switched lime juice for orange juice. No red onions by preference, and it was delish!

Fantastic, fresh, crisp & flavorful! My husband and kids loved it! The herbs came fresh out of my garden and my daughterI added more balsamic, a little more than double, and it turned out beautifully.

Love the way all the flavors go together. However there was no cilantro to be had so we were missing that one ingredient. Highly recommend, great refreshing salad!

This is a very delicious and refreshing salad. I made it just as the recipe says except for I used watermelon mint. I think the next time I make it I will use gorgonzola cheese which is sweet.  It was very good with the feta and the basil, cilantro and mints.

YUM! Don't substitute dried herbs - they gotta be fresh. I used a melon ball tool which made the salad extra pretty. Seeded melon is ok to use ... just pick the seeds out. My nephew had 3 servings. This one's a keeper.

Very good! I did not put in the full amount of herbs (I didn't want to kill my plants!) but it still turned out awesome.

Used balsamic reduction instead of the vinegar, made it a little sweet but still delish!

Very good, fresh, summer salad.  I have been growing my own herbs, so it was a pleasure to use them in this tasty salad.
