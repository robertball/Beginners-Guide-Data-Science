This was super good!  I did add to it though.  I seasoned the roast with fresh cracked pepper, onion and garlic powders, and paprika.  Around the roast in the crock pot I put pearl onions, carrot chunks, and halved garlic cloves.  I used a smaller, petite roast as it is just my husband and I, so I cut the cook time down.  When done, I took the cooking liquid and put it in a pot on the stove and thickened it with a cornstarch slurry.  The veggies were soooo delish, I highly recommend adding them!  I did find the sauce to be a touch salty, so perhaps using reduced sodium soy sauce would be better.

I didn't use the sugar. I added 1 onion - quartered, 1/2 tsp garlic salt, 1/2 tsp onion powder, sprinkled the top with paprika, then filled the remaining space with carrots and mushrooms. MmmMmm!

This was so good! It fell off the bone and had such a great flavor! My husband said it was his new favorite recipe for a roast. Thank you so much for sharing!

I always make a recipe with out any changes the first time or you really can't rate it. This recipe is solid, good flavour very tender meat. It's very easy and very little clean up. It's a winner. I did however the second time I made it added potatoes carrots and onion. It really change the taste of the broth but it was still very good , it had more of a stew or pot roast flavour. It is a recipe you could change up very easy by add different sauces instead of soya.

I liked this recipe since it was simple and had minimal ingredients, most of which I already had in the cupboard. I did add baby carrots, potatoes, quartered onions and seasonings - paprika, onion & garlic powders. I used low sodium soy sauce, after reading another review on this recipe. It was delicious!

Used brown sugar instead of white. This roast came out perfect and requires almost 0 prep. Thanks.

My family of very picky eaters, ranging in age from 12 to 45, all LOVE this.  It only gets 4 stars because I do add 1/4 to 1/2 cup ketchup and increase the tomato sauce to 14 -16 ounces (depending on size of roast) to the recipe to even out the taste of the soy sauce.  Other than that, this makes a very tender, juicy and flavorful roast PLUS the next day I shred the leftovers, add a little of our favorite barbecue sauce and we have pulled pork.  This is the keeper of all the slow cooker recipes I have used.

I made the exactly as written and I must say it had an odd sort of flavor.  I made it for dinner for a couple of sick friends and after I got home and ate mine, I was thinking 'hmm maybe should've fixed something else'.  It was just a really weird flavor.

As recommended by others I added garlic, carrots and onions. I also added a bit more sauce to make sure the roast was covered in liquid.  It was wonderful. I separated out the juices and thickened to make a gravy and served it more like a stew. Everyone really liked it, nothing was left.  Next time I may try the same recipe with a chuck roast or a big chuck steak, I  think that the sauce would be perfect with beef as well.

Admittedly did this in the oven but from frozen. Marinade was great. Used exactly as listed. Cooked for about 1.5 hours. Would do again.

Cooked a little quicker than advertised. Meat pealed off. Very suculent. Look forward to using my slow cooker more often.

This was the best pork roast recipe I have ever tried. I put it under the broiler for a few minutes first and cooked it about two hours less than called for,, since I knew I was going to have a long day at work, and it was going to be on warm for a while. The roast was moist, and the carrots, onions and potatoes were perfect! Delicious!

I gave this 4 stars only because of the adjustments I made. Reading some of the other reviews, I skipped the sugar. But I substituted teriyaki sauce for a touch of sweetness. I used Dijon mustard spread thinly over the meat. I also added garlic. I didn’t have tomato sauce so I used a small can of V8 juice. I made sure to place my pork roast with the fat side on top. This is my new recipe! It dried out slightly on the plate so keep the liquid handy or make into a gravy. Yum!

This is a very simple recipe, but it works wonderfully! I typically try to follow the recipes on here as written, at least the first time I make them, although after I started preparing everything, I realized I didn't have ground mustard or enough soy sauce. I substituted prepared mustard and added a little hoisin sauce  and water to make up for the 1/4 cup of soy sauce I was lacking. The family loved it. Nice, tender, juicy, and a little on the sweet side, but not too sweet for my family's tastes.

So Simple yet so moist and delicious. My family all loved this roast. I was skeptical about the ingredients, but it all works amazingly well somehow. perfect for a meal you set and forget in the slow-cooker on a busy day. We'll make this again and again.

For us, this was just ok, but I must say, it did grow on my husband and me as we ate through the meal.  We both agreed it is too sweet to be a real winner and neither of us found it to be salty (although we used reduced sodium soy sauce).  I added one large onion and 3 gloves of garlic at the beginning and paprika as others suggested.  This only saved the recipe, so not docking points for these aspects not written into the recipe.  We won't make again as is, but perhaps with reduced sugar and something else to make it more savoury.

I've been making this for years and it's great exactly as-is.  

Today I had pork chops instead of a roast so I cut everything up to stew sized pieces and it worked out just as well!  I think I'll do it this way from now on tbh. 

Love this recipe and these flavours so much.

Was so easy and delicious! I just seasoned the pork with a little salt, pepper and paprika before adding the sauce. Cooked it with carrots and a quartered onion and added cornstarch to make a gravy when finished. It was a sweeter gravy than we usually have but it was great!
