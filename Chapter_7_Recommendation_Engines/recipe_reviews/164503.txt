this is amazing. this may be a go-to recipe for life. overall, i made these changes:  stupid me added 8c of veg broth and 2 c chicken broth. (i had NO IDEA what i was thinking) this made it more soup like however it was perfect. i did not add the parsley as i did not have any. if you do not like spicy, i would recommend a pinch of the red pepper flakes. with the 1 tsp it is a bit spicy but not overbearing. i love it.  i also added 1 cup of chopped carrots. i had them on hand, so why not.   i assume this would have been a stew had i not added 2 1/2 times as much liquid as called for, but suprisingly, it seemed correct and it worked out.   lucky for me, i had all the spices. i cannot imagine this tasting the same without them, so i would strongly recommend that you indeed have these spices on hand.

I've made this recipe several times, and it always comes out very delicious and flavourful. It was a big hit at a recent pot-luck dinner. I didn't need to alter the recipe in any way. Very healthy, and highly recommended.

Amazing! I tailored it to my taste- substituted fresh cilantro in place of the Thyme and parsley because I had it on hand and prefer the taste (and because I love cumin and cilantro together!), and subbed chicken stock for the vegetable stock.(I'm obviously not a vegetarian...) I subbed a little allspice for the coriander because I didn't have the coriander. I also added cubes of potato to the boiling water with lentils and boiled until tender to add to the dish, and I added shredded carrot to the sautee of vegetables. Lastly, I added a can of black beans. I think it turned out like an amazing vegetarian chili! Mmmm... I had a ton leftover, so I added shredded chicken to it and it was delicious! A new favorite for me:-)

We love this stew.   Very similar to Medici's in Hyde Park/Chicago.  I've made it for both meat-eaters and vegans; loved equally by both.     We serve with a side of baked pita.    I make a few changes:
1)  Increase tomatoes to 15 oz can
2)  Reduce cinnamon to 1/2 teas.
3)  Add additional spices to menu:  1/2 teas. turmeric, 1 teas. curry powder, 1/2 teas. oregano

Very yummy soup.  The first time I made the stew I used a butternut squash. The second time I used a red Keri squash I got down at my co-op  and it was delicious also. I baked the hard winter squash first than after it cooled I peeled and cubed it.  I adjust the spices after everything is added to my taste.

Found this recipe to use a butternut squash on my counter. I cut down on the bell peppers, don't care too much for them....otherwise made it pretty much as written. I did cut the red chile pepper flakes in half and even that was a bit spicy for my group. Added some grilled pork loin to the leftovers and that was yummy. I guess I wouldn't make a good vegetarian! lol

This is really delicious.   I made a couple changes.  First I do not like lentils so I used barley instead.  YUM.  Also I added about 1/2 cup of golden raisins. SOOOOOO GOOD!

Absolutely fantastic! It can be a bit time consuming due to lots of chopping but it is definitely worth it. This recipe makes lots (and you will love the left overs), tastes great with shredded chicken added to it as well.

The smells from the kitchen, while making this stew, are absolutely intoxicating! I made about 1 1/2 times the amount of this recipe because I had a lot of people to feed & I wanted left-overs. I HAD NO LEFTOVERS!!! I didn't have butternut squash, so I used sweet potatoes and I added more vegetable broth because I wanted it to be more of a soup than stew. I will make this again & again! Thank you, Cara!!!

This was incredibly delicious! I did not even have the parsley, coriander, zucchini, peppers or  thyme leaves and it still came out great. My kids and husband enjoyed it also. We added fresh spinache on top of the stew right before serving. Yum!

Enriching, colorful, nourishing, comfort food.  Comfort food at its best', except my family didn't grow up with this food, so it doesn't have quite that niche in our lives...yet! I hope I'm willing to wrangle w/butternut squash enough for this lovely stew to become exactly that. It is relatively low cal per nutrition content, but stuck with us anyway! We didn't have coriander, so we used nutmeg. I was concerned about the heat in regards to my youngest child, so we cut back a good bit on the red pepper flakes (so the stew was probably not quite as good because of that...., but it was still very nice). We had no parsley, so stirred in some spinach at the end, which was a nice touch of color.  Also, had no peppers, but still wanted to make the stew: put in carrots as 'fillers'. It would have been prettier w/peppers, but still very nice.  USED A SLOW COOKER. NEXT TIME WILL ADJUST AS FOLLOWS: make chickpeas or white or red or black beans from dried beans using a mini crock pot, adding about 1/2 t salt for the whole mini pot full ON HIGH; at the same time place oil & spices in large slow cooker ON LOW, then chop veggies, adding veggies as soon as chopped - stirring with each addition; add rest of the ingredients including ***uncooked lentils & water 4 lentils**** (add everything except for the yogurt, parsley & mint - - but go ahead and add cayenne to taste, we like a tad, as it goes a long, long way) ADD BEANS, HEAT THROUGH TO COMBINE FLAVORS, CORRECT SEASONING, SERVE.

Super Yummy!  I was out of lentils so I made it as written except for using them.  It was DEE-licious!  Very favorful and hardy.  Even better for leftovers the next day.  I fixed the 'homemade flour torillas' to go with them (from this site) and it was a satisfying meal.

Really liked this recipe, the spices and flavors are yummy!  I improvised a bit since I didn't have any butternut squash or peppers at home, so instead I added a cup of carrots.  I also did a whole onion instead of one cup.  Also, I used some dried spices for thyme and parsley since I didn't have fresh, but it still came out great.  We loved it!  YUMMY!

Lots of chopping, but a heathy, hearty, meatless, pleasantly spiced main dish.

Very flavorful, but also very labor-intensive. I used just about every pot and pan I own. I hope this freezes well, because this recipe makes a LOT of stew!

Wow, this stew is fantastic! Exactly what I wanted out of a Moroccan Stew. It is a bit time consuming - lots of chopping and more steps than I usually spend on a soup - but soooo worth it. (I also made the chickpeas from dried so that added some extra steps)  I followed the recipe very closely - but did substitute some of the veggies. I didn't have peppers, so instead put in 1 cup carrots; also didn't have butternut squash so threw in some leftover roasted pumpkin chunks towards the end. I used the exact spices recommended, but did reduce the red chilli flake to 1/4 teaspoon, as what I have right now is very very hot. This was perfect for me. I did not love the addition of yogurt at the end, but the mint added some nice complexity. Am already planning on making this again for a vegan dinner party in a couple weeks.

Very good, nutrious and tastey!  The only thing I did different was add a bit of salt to the lentils while they cooked.

You can make in Slow Cooker.  Same recipe. 
Just put chopped onions on bottom, dry lentils next, then layer all ingredients on top.  Let cook on Low for at least 5 hours without stirring. give stir after 5th hour, add some spinach and cook 1 hour or until done.

LOVED this! I did make a few changes: I added about twice the garlic it called for because I love it, I didn't have celery or zucchini so I omitted that and I only added one red bell pepper. Also, I didnt have any fresh herbs so I used only dried ones and added about a half a teaspoon or so of both curry powder and garam marsala because I had it on hand. If you want you can wilt a little spinach over the top at the end. Overall, a delicious dish that was a hit with everyone at the table! Heads up however: if you're not feeding a small army consider halving this recipe. It makes a lot! You can also freeze it I guess... Superb!

This is awesome. We don't even miss the meat. This recipe is super adaptable to whatever fresh veg you have. Once the chickpeas and lentils and spices are in, the rest alters easily!

My stew is in the final stages, and the house smells fantastic, my preliminary taste tests definitely fnd it worthy of 5 stars.  I eyeballed most of the measurements, and didn't add the amount of cinnamon called for, and also put in some sweet potato.  I am sooo looking forward to this meal!

It was ok. I'm not a fan of the cinnamon, which hits you after the other flavors and seems overpowering. I think if I left that out, I'd like it a lot more.

To save time, I also use canned lentils. Add them right into the pot.

I have made this 3x now and finally am getting around to rating it.  I took a sweet potato and cut it up into french fry sticks and dropped into the batter and then into my deep fryer before the fish.  Fantastic, voila.... fish and chips.   did not alter this recipe at all it's just great the way it is.

This recipe did not live up to my expectations. I feel like it's missing a major flavour note -- the sweet/fruit note that other Moroccan stew recipes have. What this recipe needs are prunes or raisins!

Fabulous! I skipped the lentils, and instead made spiced turkey meatballs (ground turkey,breadcrumbs,dehydrated onion, cinnamon, cumin, salt & pepper, and fresh mint)and dropped them in after browning them in the oven to let them finish cooking in the stew. I served it with curry couscous, plain Greek-style yogurt and more fresh chopped mint. Family approved!

Wow, the flavors of this stew are incredible--not one dull bite!  I didn't even have all the ingredients (missing the veggies and chick peas) but will gladly try it again with all the right things.  The way this recipe has you cook the lentils really makes this dish.  Thanks!

This stew is very savory! made it pretty much as stated but didn't have chickpeas so just used a can of mixed-type beans. Chickpeas would have been more authentic, but it is wonderful even without them! A great way to eat your veggies in a very tasty dish!

We were a little let down by this.  It looked wonderful and smelled amazing, but if I make it again, I will cut out the cinnamon (it overpowered the other flavors) and instead add ginger.  We also added a lot of salt and in the end we decided it was better over a bed of rice. (We made the rice with ghost pepper oil instead of butter to give the entire dish a bit of gusto.)

This is rapidly becoming a favourite.  :)  My only change is the addition of a handful of raisins as we like the sweet-n-spicy combination.  I've seen other reviewers say it's labour-intensive or creates a lot of clean-up.  Not true for us at all.  One large pot, one bowl to hold the cooked lentils, and a colander to initially clean the lentils and then to drain them - that was it!  Everything goes back in the same pot.  We regularly chop up our extra peppers, celery, and onions and toss them in the freezer, so our only immediate task is to cut a squash and a zucchini.  Absolutely worth it!  A rich, delicious dish with such a wonderful smell.

Absolutely amazing.  Whole family loved it, and it's now a regular "Meatless Monday" offering.  Makes a big batch,  perfect for feeding a big family, or for some fantastic leftovers.

Thanks Cara, this was very tasty. It was also inexpensive to make and a real nutritional powerhouse. If I eat a bowl of this for lunch, I don't feel the need for any afternoon snacks and am hungry but not famished by dinner time. The only changes I made were to use homemade chicken stock instead of veggie, and cilantro instead of parsley. I also added half a bag of fresh spinach at the end.

I made this as written, other than I couldn't find fresh mint or thyme so I used dried. It was very good, but it didn't blow me away, either. Just by itself, I didn't find it satisfying enough and didn't have pita bread or rice to serve with it. I think that would definitely have helped. It smelled heavenly while cooking. I used frozen butternut squash instead of fresh - far easier to deal with! Thanks for the recipe! I would make it again.

This was good but not great. I think next time i will either cut the cinnamon in half or omit it all together.It was a bit too much for my palate. I hadn't tried butternut squash before and I'm not sure I am a fan. I might use potatoes next time.

Love this light, flavorful, healthy recipe. Lots if chopping. I think my Weight Warchers friends will enjoy this! I followed all the directions but doubled the diced tomatoes because I had a larger can. I like eating it at room temp. So good. Enjoy!!

I liked the idea of this stew but had to make a number of changes to make it more authentic.. I omitted the chick peas as the lentils were enough. Added 1 tsp. ground ginger and 1 tsp. turmeric- switched out the parsley for cilantro and used one bell pepper which was plenty. I omitted the thyme as well. Nice favors and easy to make.
