This was an interesting combination for a Ritz cracker. I have never had pastrami before and only corned beef a few times. The dressing was on the thin side but had a nice taste. The meat and dressing would make much better grilled sandwiches. Ritz crackers have a very distinct taste, and are heavy tasting, that seem to over-power many of these oderbs. Maybe, with a different style of Ritz, possibly. I also thought it badly needed some swiss cheese to give it that deli sandwich taste to me.

Made this for friends this past Sunday and they were a big hit. I ended up heating the corned beef and pastrami a little before placing them between the ritz cracker. Pretty easy to make and everyone enjoyed it.

While this was a great treat to have for #gameday. I found it had way to much meat. Using the Hillshire Farms deli slices, my stack literally 2 1/2 inches tall. So I cut down to half the meat that was required. Other then that, the sauce was nice, a bit runny but nice. My family enjoyed this.

These were delicious!  I added a slice of swiss cheese layered in between the meats. Super tasty!

The dressing is fantastic with the pastrami & corned beef!  I'm happy to have the recipe to try with full sized sandwiches, and look forward to making reubens by adding melted swiss and sauerkraut to the other ingredients--served on rye, of course!  YUM.

These are quick and easy to make!  The homemade russian dressing is delicious with the pastrami and corned beef.  It is easy to assemble.  I prefer it opened faced because it is easier to eat.

So easy and so yummy! Made this for this past superbowl and it was a hit.  The only thing I would recommend is make these right before your ready to eat so that the cracker does not get soggy from the dressing. Oh, I did add a slice of baby swiss. Overall very good and I will make again.

Insane!  Only Carnegie Deli could come up with this. I doubles the meat and made it twice as good.
