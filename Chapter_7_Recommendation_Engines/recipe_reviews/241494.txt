Wow!  What a great idea!!!  I think the shredded beets are more flavorful because they are cooked in very little liquid and in butter. Plus the pieces cook quickly and uniformly.  We were out of regular balsamic vinegar so we used some bottled balsamic glaze.  So delicious!!!

12.18.15  The recipe's name says it all, it is  easy and tasty.  I was a little concerned that the balsamic vinegar might overpower the beet flavor and almost used  milder white balsamic.  Not to worry because 2 Tbsp of regular balsamic vinegar is spot on.  The beets did take an additional 5 minutes  to soften, but that additional time didn't mess up the rest of the meal.  My hubby who never has been a  beet lover  liked them.  Thanks for sharing  ddow.

Delicious! The only thing I changed was to add a little honey at the same time as the vinegar, and I topped it with chopped fresh parsley just before serving. The parsley really went well with the sweet-tanginess of the beets. Definitely a keeper!
