I was looking for something unique and totally devourable for a party last weekend...This recipe was a hit. I've never prepared a dish that disappeared so quickly. (And I doubled the recipe!) I took the advice of another reviewer and served these on slices of my favorite baguette, drizzled lightly with olive oil, topped with the Titaina and then toasted briefly under the broiler. The only adjustment I made to the topping was to add a couple splashes of balsamic vinegar, which I think really brought out the complex flavors of such a simple dish. I used a large can of albacore tuna and  fire roasted tomatoes from my local organic grocer. Still, no one could believe that anything came from a can...not to mention that I put cinnamon on tuna :)Thank you, thank you, thank you!

this is very good with a few tweaks.  Kept all proportions the same, but used jarred roasted red peppers, 1 jalapeno for a bit of zip, fresh chopped cilantro,and garnished w/some oil-cured black olives.  I couldn't see the sense in cooking this for as long as stated, unless it is supposed to be the consistency of a chili sauce, maybe?  Never having this before and no posted pic, I didn't know if that was what the consistency was supposed to be, but preferred it less 'mushy'.  Added the drained tomatoes after sauteeing the veggies, and added the spices; threw in the tuna and cilantro at the very end.  When I tasted this, the cinnamon was very apparent and did not meld well with the tuna.  It needed some citrus for the sake of the tuna.  I didn't have any fresh lemons to garnish with, so added 3 packages of True Lemon(dried real lemon that no kitchen should be without)  This drastically improved the flavor!  the tuna stood out, and it subdued the cinnamon, and added no sour taste, only the taste of lemon zest.  I would only prefer this hot if it was going to be served over pasta(which would be a great Lenten dish) but instead, liked it at room temp to serve w/fresh baked savory bread.  thanks for the recipe that can be tweaked to taste.  Super quick and easy and can use your imagination for a variety of ways to serve it.

Was skeptical about making this at first, but boy am I glad I did! Visually, it wasn't appealing to me and the thought of cinnamon and nutmeg in tuna sort of made me gag :)  Am so glad I took the chance. Tweaked recipe a bit by using a can of Rotel diced tomatoes with green chiles. Added really nice but not overpowering kick. Chopped up a roma tomato since the Rotel can was only 10 oz. Also squeezed in a wee bit of fresh lemon juice and some balsamic vinegar which another reviewer recommended. Also followed her recommendation to serve on oven toasted baguette slices with olive oil. Also had sea salt crackers, but the crunchy bread was the best My husband absolutely loved it. Will definitely make again and again.

For years I've tried to replicate the filling of another spanish dish: Empanada Gallega.
Well, not anymore, this is it!.
Thank you from the bottom of my heart.

Oh, by the way, we had this with bread and warm green beans mixed with minced fresh garlic, olive oil, salt, pepper and feta cheese.

I spread this on slices of a round French loaf, put some salad on the side, and we ate it all up!  My husband was amazed at how good it was, and he said he never would have guessed it was made with tuna, especially canned tuna.  It's a keeper!

This was delicious!  I used fresh tomatoes instead of canned and added a little lemon juice.  I served it on some crackers.  Thanks for the recipe!

I LOVED THIS!  All of the ingredients are pretty much staples in my kitchen, so I decided to give it a try.  I doubled the recipe so I could use my entire 12 oz. can of tuna, used green pepper only (didn't have any red), and omitted the pine nuts (didn't have any).  This has a very unique taste and you can't really tell what spices are in it... it just really brings out the flavors of everything.  I'm sure it would be fantastic with the pine nuts, too!  I just ate it with some crackers (next time I'll plan ahead and get GOOD crackers!), and the next day I had it in a mini wheat wrap for lunch.  I will definitely be making this often!  THANK YOU!

so yummy!  I was unsure of this dish at first, but I loved it!  I am GF, so I had it on a brown rice tortilla.  My husband had it over rice.  It was delicious both ways!

Yes, cinnamon and tuna can go together!  This was unusual but well received by my six dinner guests.  I put mine on small whole wheat pita rounds and broiled as other reviewers suggested.  Pine nuts are super expensive; if you're on a budget, you can leave them out without sacrificing much.

made as directed apart from the sugar and nutmeg, neither of which I had to hand - served with crusty white bread - great- then added just a little cayenne for personal taste - shame the wife doesn't like bell peppers, guess it's all mine

Easy and delicious! I've made it 3 times in as many months. I used one Starkist smoked tuna pouch, and it came out very nice. The smokey flavors go well with the cinnamon and sugar.

This is tasty, but I think it could be ramped up still.  It needs to pop, and to get it there I will look at the reviews and try some other things like: roasted red peppers instead of regular peppers, green olives, red onions, etc.  I'll let you know:)

My boyfriend adored this and took seconds, I on the other hand thought it was OK. It was a tad on the sweet side for me and I couldn't figure out the fishiness with the cinnamon. I served it on leftover naan bread from another recipe, that was definitely a good idea. Could use some tweaking and a good dose of red wine vinegar.

This is fantastic!!  These are all items I keep on hand, so when friends dropped in recently I prepared it for them, along with the baguette of fresh bread I had happened to buy that day.  The first time I made it I thought it a bit tame, so I doubled the spices.  We love it, and even make a lunch of it on slices of fresh baguette from the local padaria.

I was reluctant at first, thinking cinnamon and tuna would not blend well- I WAS WRONG! This dish was incredible! I left the pine nuts out, but otherwise, a great dish! I would definitely recommend trying it out!
