I had already roasted pumpkin cubes (with no seasoning) that needed to be used up, so I picked this recipe. Instead of making it a "lasagna," I put the squash in the bottom, then the ricotta mix, then the meat, then the mozzarella and parm on top. The family loved it. My 4 year old didn't want to eat the big pumpkin pieces, and I am sure he would have preferred the seasoned lasagna-style flat pieces of squash. I will definitely put this on the regular winter meal rotation.

For minimal carbs: skipped the brown sugar and used a standard sized (~24.5 oz) jar of marinara sauce w/o sugar.  The 2 squash I used were relatively small, but that worked great w/ this size jar of sauce and meant a nicely cheesy/meaty lasagna overall.
