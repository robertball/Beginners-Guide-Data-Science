These are incredible cookies! My fiance and I eat them just about every night (yes, we bake a batch every weekend). To reduce calories, I use sugar substitute, reduced fat margerine, whole wheat flour and egg whites, and they always turn out delicous, or as my fiance says,"exquisite." Once you drop them on the cookie sheet, its good to flatten them a bit and give them a little shape, or else they turn out like bigs clumps of cookie (but still taste great of course).

I lost my favorite rasin cookie recipe (Cora's Jumbo Rasin Cookies) and this is the closest I have seen to it - because it too calls for boiling the rasins - which makes for a very moist and tasty cookie.  Thanks.

This is the absolutely the best tasting raisin cookie I have ever made.  
I had lost this recipe a few yrs back and was thrilled to find it here.
My husband and kids have already requested I make it a least once a week
until further notice!!   Also, this recipe doubles very nicely.  The 
exception I make is to delete the nuts.
TRY THIS ONE ! ! !

I found this recipe to be a bit unflavorful. I came upon it while looking for a recipe my grandmother gave me years ago, lost it and thought this would be close. If there was more cinnamon added, it might make it a bit more tasty, but other wise, this cookie was good and tender.

Something wasn't right about these cookies. I think boiling them in water made the raisins taste funny. Not too big of a hit here.

I didn't add baking powder and they still turned out great. Used blueberry craisins instead of raisins, brown sugar instead of white. Yuuuummmm

These are a very Tasty cookie!!! I did  omit the nutmeg just a personal preference and substituted it with cinnamon! ! and used butter instead of shortening. These bake up nicely! had a wonderful buttery taste and  crispy around the edges and chewy in the center.I did flatten them a bit they didnt spread much!! I will most definitely make these again!!!

These were good cookies but a little on the sweet side.  I would probably decrease the sugar next time.  I used margarine instead of shortening.  Also, I reduced my oven temp as they seemed to brown too quickly at 375.  My batch made 4 dozen cookies of pretty good size.  These are very similar to the type of cookies my mom makes.

These are really good cookies. Soft with just a little crunch on outside when fresh from the oven. Dough starts out almost like cake batter and firms up enough to bake right away, becoming very firm after refrigeration. I’ll make these again.

These cookies are a huge hit with both my kids and my husband! I originally had baked these with hopes to replicate his grandma's cookies and they're so close in flavour, we couldn't love them more! I also omit the walnuts due to personal preference and have never had issues. Now all my friends and family ask for the recipe for "those" cookies!

I was craving cookies and needed a good batch to take for a camping. These were the perfect fit ! I used butter instead of shortening and added a pinch of orange peel powder as a spice. Makes a perfect snack or breakfast.

excellent recipe. Closest to my husband's grandmother's recipe that I have found so far.  I substituted 3/4 olive oil for the butter. Also had to reduce the cooking time but I think my oven was just running hot.

I used this recipe twice now.  The first time I followed it to the "t", except I added more cinnamon.  The second time,  I thought I could just kinda "wing" it and use the "dump and go" method. Follow the recipe, they will turn out fantastic. I did flaten with a fork. Got BIG kudos from my father-in- law because these cookies taste like his mom's cookies, she has been deceased for sometime now.  My kids and husband LOVED these cookies as well.    I am going to try the lower fat version based on the reviewsquarebar of others.  I feel like a lower fast version will likely be good because the raisins are already sweet.  This is a winner in our house:)

Yummy! I love soft rain cookies and boiling the raisins makes them soft and perfect. Maybe add a little more cinnamon but so amazing and cake - like.
