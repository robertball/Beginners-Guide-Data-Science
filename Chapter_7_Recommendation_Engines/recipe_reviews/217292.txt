Super Tasty! We make pesto from about everything that grows in the garden.
FYI, Cilantro are the leaves and Coriander are the seeds. Two different flavors.

I'm a big fan of cilantro so I thought I'd give this a try.  It was great!  Very light and fresh.  I was actually surprised at how light the flavor was given that cilantro has such a strong taste.  I ended up using 2 teaspoons of lemon juice to give it a little more zip.  I served it with whole wheat spaghetti, and really liked the way the flavor of the pesto worked with the nutty taste of the whole wheat.  I'll definitely make this again.

I had purchased a package of gluten-free tagliatelle pasta when it was on sale, so I was wondering what to do with it. I came across this recipe. I love cilantro and I love pesto, so I knew I would like this recipe. It was wonderful! So flavorful and fresh. The cilantro, feta and pine nuts go perfectly together. It was a great side dish to go with the "Greek Style Garlic Chicken Breast" recipe from this site.

I like to use asiago cheese instead of feta (just a personal preference).

Super easy and has become a favourite at our house. If you are on a budget, you can substitute sunflower seeds for the pine nuts (they are crazy expensive at the moment!) and it's still very good. 

By the way, it's called coriander in Australia as well (both the fresh herb and the seeds).

As somebody already noted, this is Cilantro Pesto, but whatever you call it, it's really excellent! I think next time I'll cut back on the olive oil a bit and double the feta cheese, but that's not a criticism of the original recipe. Thanks for sharing this!

Great tasting recipe. For the coriander/cilantro debate. In New Zealand it is just called coriander and coriander seeds.

I did not care for this recipe. I'm sticking to traditional basil pesto in the future.

The feta overpowers the other flavors rather than working with them.  This did not score big in our house.

This was fantastic and got very great feedback from everyone I served it to. I did add one fresh jalape√±o to the food processor for a little more kick, and also increased the lemon juice a bit. I served this over penne with diced chicken breast (cooked in the sauce). I will certainly be making this recipe again. Thank you for the excellent recipe!

This was tasty and was even better as leftovers (maybe the pesto got to meld together more overnight?).  I did not drizzle the pasta with the extra oil at the end.  This pesto was also good on broccoli that we had on the side/on top of the pasta.  I would like to make this again and mix in a bunch of vegetables with the noodles.

I made it according to the directions.  The family liked it.  I made the pesto a day prior to serving.  I added pine nuts before serving.

This is a pretty typical pesto pasta dish. It was probably the easiest recipe I've made in a while, and it was very fast to cook. I used a blender which worked just as well as a food processor. It is very filling so I would recommend splitting between at least 2. If you like your sauces on the lighter side, this dish is not for you. I would also recommend adding less olive oil to the dish, about 1/4 cup instead of 1/3. Would probably make/eat again but not exactly the healthiest of meals out there.

Delicious, but agree you should add extra lemon, otherwise it is a little mild. Paired it with Trader Joe's lemon pepper pappardelle and it turned out great. Definitely will make again.
