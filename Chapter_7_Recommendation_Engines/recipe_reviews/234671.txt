I think this a very yummy, simple dish to make. The flavors are really nice, but most people will probably want to add salt or use vegetable broth instead of water. I personally didn't add any salt but I added red onion, garlic and mrs dash seasoning to kick up the flavor just a bit.

Absolutely awesome with a few tweaks.  I was trying to clean out my fridge so in addition to the celery, lentils, quinoa, carrots, I added half an onion chopped, 1/2c. frozen corn and a finely diced jalapeno (I didn't have mushrooms).  I used the cumin and ginger with some fresh ground pepper.  I skipped the chilli powder b/c of the jalapeno and added chicken bouillon.  My mixture needed 5c of water.  Bring to a boil then simmer for 30 minutes. Full of flavor!

Instead of water I used vegetable broth to add more flavor. Instead of chili powder I used cayenne red pepper. I'm not sure how the chili powder would have turned out but the red pepper made this HOT! I also added some beef tips to make it a little heartier.  Overall it was good but really spicy

It is for sure healthy. It definitely needs some flavor so I added salt and a small amount of butter (I'm not vegan). Not my favorite lentil soup but it is alright

It definitely is healthy, but no flavor as stated.  My husband said thanks for trying, but no thank you again.  Denice

I use cayenne pepper and turmeric instead of chili powder and cumin. Definitely had a lot more spice
