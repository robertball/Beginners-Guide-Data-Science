I must say...I did make a few changes, and wow! I did add 1/2 tsp. sage as others suggested (if you like it, which I do); I took others' suggestion and only added 1 tsp. brown sugar instead of 1 tbsp., and used 1 c. skim milk plus 1/2-2/3 c. half and half. For the finishing touch, I thought "wow, I have a bottle of whiskey just sitting there, I wonder how that would be??"  So I added 1/4 c. whiskey....Let me tell you, that was the best way to finish this sauce!! Terrific! We served it on Trader Joe's Butternut Squash ravioli with grilled chicken breasts and fresh butternut squash chunks.  Amazing!!

I omitted the oil, used soy milk instead of cream, and omitted the brown sugar.  This was great on beet raviolis!  I can't wait to top other kinds of pasta with this sauce!

Very good.  A little too thick, though.  Would use more milk next time.  Served it over Trader Joes honey roasted pumpkin ravioli.  Yum!  Perfect meal on a cool, fall night.

This recipe works... but note the variations.  

variation 1:
just do the ingredients in the first column: butter, oil, thyme, rosemary, flour.     

This is actually what i was hoping for...  and i should have stopped and scooped some of the sauce out for my dinner here, but i kept on with the recipe.

Version 2:
add the creme

this had me concerned because first it thickened up almost into a paste... but then once i got to a certain point of creme (~1 full cup?)  it turned back into a fluid sauce.   I only had ~1 cup of creme in my fridge, so i didn't use the full 1 1/2 cups in the recipe.   This also tasted great and had more body than version one.   I DID scoop some of this out and save, but it was enough for 3 ravioli.

Version 3:
i added in the final ingredients...   nutmeg, cinnamon, brown sugar. (no salt or pepper as i don't use them often anyways).

After, taste testing, i thought it was good, but not the sauce i was hoping for.   Too sweet for my more hearty craving (although it would be great for a sweet craving).  However, once I put it on the raviolis, it actually worked GREAT!!!   All three variations are delicious

Personally, I'll probably stick with v1 or v2 depending on whether I feel like eating a light or heavy sauce, and only use v3 around the holidays

I added the sage anyway and used skim milk that I thickened with a little cornstarch instead of flour. I know it sounds kinda strange but it worked and less fat. It had a very nice taste and was wonderful on our squash ravioli. I also omitted the oil.

I love this recipe with butternut squash ravioli. It's amazing and addicting! I've made it a few times and it's perfect when you're breastfeeding since sage can reduce milk supply.

Delicious but cut sugar by 1/2 and added chicken broth as well as sage for flavor.

This was great with our homemade acorn squash ravioli.  It was quite thick and next time I would add more cream or milk.  I also added walnuts to the dish as a final touch.

Well I forgot to add in the sugar, nutmeg, and cinnamon but still thought this was a tasty sauce for the Costco butternut squash ravioli. I didn't have sage so this was a great alternative. I also didn't have cream so I used 2% milk with a cornstarch slurry as another reviewer had mentioned. Nice to be able to pull together a sauce without having to run to the store!

I made this to put over butternut squash ravioli. It was very delicious, just a little on the sweet side. It's also very easy to make. Highly recommend giving this one a try.

We really liked this although I didn't add as much sugar and cinnamon as the recipe calls for. I also used evaporated milk with a cornstarch slurry because I didn't have any heavy cream. It was absolutely delicious served over roasted butternut squash

I used half and half instead of heavy cream. I did add a dash of sage. Also, I added some frozen peas, julienne carrots and walnuts.  It came out amazing.

Very easy to make.  Had to use 1/2 and 1/2 instead of heavy cream.  Seemed to work out really well.  I also had to add a bit more flour for texture.  What an amazing sauce!!!

This is very rich and delicious, so a little bit goes a long ways. I put this over butternut squash stuffed seashell pasta rather than doing raviolis.

Lovely. I tend to like savory vs sweet so next time, I will cut the brown sugar in half.

Thank you for this recipe - one of my favorite restaurants in my home state served a similar sauce over filet mignon..don't knock it until you try it!  I am using my first batch over butternut ravioli.  I omitted the oil by accident, added a dash of sage and will be topping the dish with toasted walnuts.
Thank you

I took the advice of one of the reviewers and only used the first column of ingredients. And it was fabulous! I used EVOO as my cooking oil for the heart benefits and it was delicious.

Followed the recipe and I loved it!  Easy to make with ingredients I typically have in the kitchen.  Went perfectly over some butternut squash ravioli.

This was good, it is pretty sweet but it pairs well with butternut squash. I followed the recipe except I did add some dried sage & I used skim milk and then thickened the sauce with cornstarch. Next time I think I will reduce the amount of brown sugar to make the sweetness a little more subtle & add a bit more pepper, but otherwise we liked it.
