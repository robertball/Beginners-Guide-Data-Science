Tried this marinade today and it was delicious! We purchased a box of 8 oz. sirloin steaks from GFS and were disappointed because they were tough and thick. We butter-flyed them and used the marinade. They turned out juicy and flavorful! We are going to try this on pork chops next.

Update: since I tried this recipe on this sight, I use it all the time, it's my go to marinade! Use it not only on beef, but pork, & it's great on salmon& shrimp. It's so good, always make my own marinade, no need to buy any marinade!!we just got a new grill , & we needed one! It's a infra- red grill, they are great!!! Well we fixed steaks & shrimp , just like the first time I tried this recipe . Thanx for posting a great recipe!!

Very nice with a hint of sweet. The steak was very tender. We originally adjusted recipe to amount of steak we were doing, but hubby still had to cut it in half again & had plenty to marinate in.  I did think the soy sauce was a little dominating & made it salty for my preference so we'll cut that back just a tad for next time.  I suppose since we marinated overnight could be why it seemed salty to me. We decided a serving for one will be enough marinade for one pound of steak.  If that doesn't work we'll adjust accordingly.

This is my go to marinade for all cuts of beef as well as pork ribs.  I have been asked many times for the recipe.  Definitely a five star recipe.

I double the bourbon and garlic, and omitted the confectioners sugar.
