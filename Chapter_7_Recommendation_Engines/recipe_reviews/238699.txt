The name is misleading.  basically you are cooking bananas on a grill, not grilling the banana meat.  Use extremely firm bananas, otherwise they will completely mush up.  Personally?  I prefer them fried.

I have made this before by cutting the bananas into coins and lightly sauteing them in butter and sprinkling with cinnamon and nutmeg, then serving them on top of vanilla ice cream.

Cooking in the oven sure isn't grilled. Taste is really good, but don't call it grilled.
