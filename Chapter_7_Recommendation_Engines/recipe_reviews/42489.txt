I love these!  I usually think that cake mix is pretty gross, but my step mother made these for years before I ever knew that they were made from a box mix.   If you like nuts and dates you should really try them.

I can't honestly give this 5 stars since I never really followed the recipe exactly.  I used sunflower seeds, not walnuts, and mixed dried fruits in place of the dates.  It turned out to be the BEST breakfast bar!   I love the easy, fast prep and the freedom to use any kind of nuts or dried fruits to tailor this to hubby's tastes-he has breakfast during his commute.  I want to try upping the healthy portions and possibly adding some dry milk or protein powder; I may replace some of the butter with canola oil.  If anyone else plays with the recipe, I would appreciate your tips.   But just as it is, the recipe is definitely a timesaver and will taste and look like it's from scratch.

These were awesome!  Buttery tasting, chewy, and fairly easy to prepare.  It's a very thick batter, so I wet my hands and pressed it down. My husband loved them.

I followed the recipe with the exception of adding some coconut.  I thought they were great and received many compliments.  I might reduce the sugar next time, however, my husband thought they were perfect as is.

So good and so easy!  These have been a hit every time I've made them.  I'd suggest getting whole dates and chopping them yourself as opposed to the already chopped dates.  This makes the chunks bigger and more flavorful.  And the more dates the better!

Made a half batch of this yesterday with figs instead of dates.  Took them to dessert party and everyone loved them.  Will definitely make them again.

For taste I am giving this a 5 star rating. But I did have disappointing results with the edges raising and browning up, way before the middle was done. Will try again to see if get different results. I didn't have full 2 cups of dates so I used craisins as a fill in but I don't think that has anything to do with edges getting tooooooo brown before middle was done and my oven temps are right on.

These bars are moist, tasty and easy to make. I made them several times during the winter holidays. A crowd pleaser!

I make massive amounts of cookies every year for Christmas. If I don't make these I hear about it. But why wouldn't I? They are SUPER easy to make & everyone LOVES them. My 7 year old grandson declares them as his favorite. The dates melt into the batter and give it a gooey flavor of sweetness. You can leave out the nuts for those with allergies & they will still be delicious.

This is a great recipe!  I followed it but substitued 1c of each, walnuts, chocolate chips, raisins and coconut for the dates and walnuts.  This recipe is totally adaptable to what you want to add.  Next time I'm going to try different mixes of fruit, nuts, and other add ins.
