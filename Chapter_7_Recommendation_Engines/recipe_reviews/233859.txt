Please refer to the "Cook's Note" if your personal choice is not to use food coloring :)  On a related note, if you are choosing to go for the tie dyed effect, the recipe should say to use regular rotini pasta, not the tri colored (though the tri colored is delightful if you forgo the coloring).  Obviously, this isn't an every night side, but something to mix things up a bit for a special occasion (the special occasion it was created for was a Tie Dyed themed baby shower).  Regardless of your color stance, this is one of our family's favorite pasta salads and a nice change of pace from the standard italian dressing based pasta salads.  I do recommend adjusting the sugar to your personal preference.  Enjoy!

A nice change of pace from the Italian and Greek pasta salad dressings.  I used a variety of garden vegetables with shell pasta, as that's what I had.  I hope to have a reason to try the Tied Dyed effect sometime!

This recipe is a keeper.  Made as written with only one change.  Used sweet mini peppers vs green pepper for personal preference. Took this salad to a big family cookout.  It went over very well.  If you are looking for a different pasta salad this is it. It's bright and refreshing.  The only suggestion I would make is add a couple extra drops of the yellow food color.
Thanks for the recipe!
