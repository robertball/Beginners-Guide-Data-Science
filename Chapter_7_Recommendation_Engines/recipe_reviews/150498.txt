Overall, a satisfying and filling meal that makes plentiful servings. I did tweak the recipe a bit (more spinach, more chicken, no nutmeg, no cheese, less water, added tomatoes). I found the recipe to be incredibly bland as written, so I seasoned it with paprika, black pepper, red pepper flakes, and cumin - which really made the dish MUCH better. Next time, I will marinate the chicken beforehand, add olives, and use grated parm (like you would find in the pasta aisle). I have high hopes for the leftovers - hopefully the flavors will meld together a little better and it will be even more delicious than tonight! The bottom line: a tweakable filling recipe with plenty of potential.

Using cream of mushroom soup for this instead of cream of chicken makes a big difference. I also add a tbs. of lemon juice, and a tbs. of italian seasoning into the soup mixture before adding the rice.
