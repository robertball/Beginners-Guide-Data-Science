This is gooey and a waste of time. Soak a cup of uncooked rice in water overnight. Discard water and place the rice, a can of evaporated milk and about 4 cups of water in a blender. Mix. Add 1/2 cup sugar, 1 tsp vanilla and 1/2 tsp cinnamon and blend well. Strain through a cheesecloth a few times and serve over ice. Easier and way better, i promise.

This recipe turned out great, except you can't follow the instructions completely.  First, instead of a cinnamon stick I substituted ground cinnamon.  Second, I added 1 quart(4 cups) milk)in addition to the other ingredients.  Then I heated up the mixture, not waiting the 3 hours, just until it was hot, not boiling.  Pureeed the mixture till smooth and strained it.  Then I chilled the mixture.  Excellent.

Being Mexican myself, I'm biased when it comes to Mexican recipes.  However, I do love horchata.  It takes alot of time to prepare, but it is worth it.  My nieces and newphews love it, but then again, they are also Mexican, :-). My fianc√©, on the other hand, is white, and he can't get enought of this drink.  I decided to learn how to make it for him, and that is what brought me here.  So even though it isn't especially easy to make, it is worth it just for it's delicious taste.

I read the recipe, then the other posts here and had to laugh. The person who posted this recipe skipped a crucial step: STRAINING the horchata (Do you really think we can drink something that has cinnamon bark in it without straining it?). Funny. Also, I usually like to let the rice mixture sit overnight, then you don't have to cook it and lose its lovely fresh milky flavor.

The measurements for the water and sugar in this recipe must be WAY off. I followed everything precisely and what I ended up with was a very thick, milkshike-type drink. Nothing at all like real Horchata I grew up in my Mexican household. I had to add about 3 more quarts of water (and consequently another few cups of sugar)to make the drink thin enough and sweet enough to drink. In the end, it still tasted like pureed rice pudding and not like Horchata. I was skeptical when reading this recipe at first because of the directions to cook the rice. I knew that would make it very starchy, but proceeded anyway. I was very disappointed. I guess the hunt still continues for a good Horchata recipe. :-(

The proportions are definitely off.  After blending 'til smooth this was a thick rice milkshake, not a refreshing rice drink.  Look elsewhere for a good horchata recipie.

After reading the reviews, I made LatinaCook's recipe instead.  The only variation I made was to add a touch of almond extract.    Nice drink for a change of pace...

With all due respect to the author, this did not come close to the authentic horchata my family is used to drinking.  I was disappointed to find white sludge after I followed the recipe exactly.

This did not turn out well at all.  It looked like rice pudding after cooking, and after blending it turned into a rice shake.

Taste was good.  The results were in a thick sauce form, like thick paste gravy.  Thinning took away any flavor.  I am use to Hispanic made from Chicago and it was always so goood.  Will return to purchased mix from the store.

The horchata --- pronounce it or chah tah --- recipes that came up here are NOT the authentic Mexican way.  We discovered horchata when my son undertook Latin American Studies in college AND we learned how to make it from Mexican neighbors.  Our hometown in Iowa is heavily - around 20 percent - Hispanic.  I was taught to simply boil rice in lots of water, eat the rice in another dish and use just the milky rice water for the DAIRY FREE drink.  Add sugar to taste and either ground cinnamon or ground nutmeg like you would for eggnog.  You could add milk if you wanted, evaporated milk being the preferred choice, but try it the ECONOMICAL and purely simple way with rice and water plus sugar/spice to taste.  Horchata is definitely addictive and beats corn syrup sweetened pop any day.

Unfortunately I had to discard the entire batch of this ... Maybe(?) I did something wrong  but after I cooked and pureed the rice, it became a fragmented heap of glop (like watered down paste-glue or wet soap or soaked flour  with chunks or something akin to that). I TRIED to strain this but due to glue-like consistency and thickness  ended up with a mess. I made an additional batch practically the same way, with the addition of Creme of Coconut AND  WITHOUT cooking the rice - end result: Fabulous! VERY IMPORTANT TIP: DO NOT boil the rice!

Something isn't right about this recipe.  When I tried it it turned out to be more like a gritty pudding that was too thick to even strain.  I just had to throw it away and wasted a few hours of my time.  I'm thinking it shouldn't be cooked at all, but just soaked.

After spending five hours cooking, waiting, and straining this stuff, I SOOO wanted to love this.  What I ended up with was the consistency of cake frosting.  Once I watered it down, it tasted much like the boiled water you'd find in under-cooked rice.  I am sad to throw this out after all the effort, mess, and waiting this required.  I just can't bring myself to like it.  Try another recipe if you value your time.

I may have had horchata once or twice before in my lifetime, so I'm not a good judge of what this *should* taste like. It's a bit strange for average-white-guy tastebuds, but I'll have to say it grew on me a little, as I drank the whole batch in a few days. I gather from the previous reviews that there was some confusion on whether the mixture should be strained (perhaps the recipe was amended, as now it says to do so). I'd never used cheesecloth before, and gave it try here, but it, um, didn't quite work for me. So I reverted to using a fine-mesh sieve instead, which I'm a little more familiar with. The resulting mixture was still a tiny bit grainy (is that how it's supposed to be?). But it occurred to me, while reading the reviews, that perhaps straining the mixture more than once would be a good idea (I'd never thought of that). I did use the optional vanilla, and the full 1/2 cup of sugar. It's definitely best served chilled, although I forgot about the "over ice" part after my first glass. This wasn't fantastic, and it's a little time-consuming, but it did help broaden my horizons a little bit.

I followed LatinaCook's advice and my boyfriend raved.  I didn't try this actual recipe, though.  I'm no expert, but cooking the rice does sound strange.  Did you know that in Mexico, they make it with blanched almonds in place of milk?  Check out Wikipedia for more info.

We attempted to make this for a school project and we ended up just going to the store to buy some rice milk. After cooking the rice and letting in chill overnight (before purreing it) and after purreing it we attempted to just use  sieve but we had to push it through the mesh. So we attempted to use the cheesecloth, it was really bland tasting too. It was not thin like how it is supposed to be, but rather gooey and pudding like. After sitting out for a couple of minutes it quickly turned into a jell-o like substance. I would never make this again! Find a better recipe!

Gooey, Sticky, Mess. Horchata is supposed to be thinner than milk, sweet, refreshing, and you can never have enough. Atole is a thick cornmeal drink, like breakfast in a cup. It's quite tasty and a comfort food here in New Mexico. This recipe turned out somewhere in between Horchata and Atole. I love both, but not mixed together. Blend the rice, but don't cook it, and throw out the gritty ends.

I haven't tried this one. But this is the only one I have ever seen that uses cooked rice. My first thought was that it would make a mess, and sure enough, one reviewer confirmed it. This sounds like a terrible recipe. All the proportions are off.

I was in a hurry and did not look at the reviews.  I like the fact that the only two positive reviews here are from someone who hasn't used the recipe yet and someone who did not follow the recipe. Incredible that this was the top recipe when I googled harchata.  Never again, IVYP.

This was a complete disaster for me! It was ridiculously thick. I'm not sure what I did wrong... My boyfriend still loved it, but he will eat anything.  I will give this recipe another try, but i'm not expecting much. This was nothing like the horchata my grandmother would make.

I have to agree with the previous reviewers.  This makes unstrainable starchy sludge.  If you left out the step where you cook the rice and do everything else the same I think it would work out OK.

I'm glad this recipe "costs only a few cents to make" - I didn't feel so bad throwing the results out.
I followed the recipe instructions and got the same milkshake sludge as other reviewers. No matter how much I strained it - it was still an unpleasant texture in the mouth.
I then did as another reviewer suggested, soaking the rice uncooked - which only produced a cinnamon flavoured water - I didn't need to waste the rice to get that result.
With apologies to all, this is the only recipe I've ever rated one-star.

I gave this three stars because it got me on the right track toward making my own horchata recipe.  I didn't have any dairy products and wanted something milky... so the bag of rice sprang to mind.  I boiled two cups of rice in four cups of water and kept adding water to cover the rice, until the rice grains were huge, puffy, and creamy.  Then, added water until it was soupy and blended.  When most of the rice was broken up I strained.  If your strainer is getting clogged, run your fingers around the holes and/or add more water.  I found that more water made straining easier.  Keep the rice shards you strain out and make rice pudding.  Same sugar, cinnamon, and vanilla as the horchata, just in a more solid form.  If it comes out too thick ... add water and blend and all will be well.  And mine tastes strongly of rice, regardless of the tons of water.  Must be from all the ground up rice in it.

i use the recipe all the way up to step 2. i smashed the rice during the boiling process, so you can get all that extra water out of the rice. and i added about 1/4 cup of milk to it.

I tried this recipe and followed it exact. The rice to water ratio is so far off all I ended up with was a thick rice pudding like mix but the fun part was trying to figure out how to dilute it or thin it out without sacrificing flavor after a ton of water, milk sugar and more cinnamon and vanilla we ended up with a product that was delicious! If you try this I recommend cutting the rice measurement in half or doubling the     Water! Goodluck!

This was like rice porridge and I had to add a LOT more sugar and cinnamon to get even close to the authentic taste I've had elsewhere.

I liked it.  If done with milk it would be much better.  The water is good if you want something refreshing and not too heavy.  Will make it again.  Thank you for sharing recipe.

Did not work at all. Don't know what I did wrong, but wouldn't even go through the cheese cloth. Tasted nothing like the Horchata I had when living in Phoenix.

When you make Horchata with uncooked rice, you throw away much more of the rice. The solution is diluted more. The thick texture than can come with cooking rice can yes come from the heating process, but also the fact more rice turns into liquid. I made Horchata with organic short grain brown rice. The uncooked method does not work as well since this is tougher rice. I actually pressure cooked the rice for way too long pretty much just rice, water, and a touch of lime as an acid. This combined with blending after pressure cooking, and leaving it overnight does make way to thick of something to drink. This is because it is a concentrate. Since almost all of the rice dissolves, you have to dramatically change the ratio of rice to everything else.  One pitcher not quite full of the pudding like result makes about 3 very full pitchers of Horchata. When enough water/milk is added, it is the proper texture, has an amazing rice flavor, and you do not throw away most of the rice, as you do with uncooked Horchata. Maybe authentic is not anywhere close to how I did it, but organic rice is expensive, and is not as easy to work with. I have made Horchata both ways, and will stick with this one. Made properly, it has an amazing flavor with organic brown rice, and uses rice far more efficiently. I just add sugar and other ingredients to taste when I turn the pudding like concentrate into the drink, after straining. The idea of this recipe is good, but I personally would cook rice very well

If you prepare it according to the directions, it will result in uneatable sludge. I recommend you find Lola's horchata

All I do is get some rice milk add 1 tea spoon of vanilla about a 1/4 cup of sugar 1 tb of powdered cinnamon and mix well.I would have to agree with fluxmaster about the reveiews.
