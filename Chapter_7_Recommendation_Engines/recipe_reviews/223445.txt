I must say I was looking for a dip that used crab, not imitation crab (I'm not really sure what that is, actually!).  So I used the same quantity of canned crab lump meat.  I thought it might be a bit acidic with all that artichoke, so I cut back on it a little.   Other than that, the only thing I changed was the addition of a tablespoon of seeded mustard & it was delicious.  Very creamy & crabby, with enough zing to make it really more-ish!

Will make again!  I made the following adjustments according to what I had on hand:  I substituted 1/3 fat Neufchatel cheese, light mayonnaise, dehydrated onions, and also added spinach.  I didn't really measure but did have to add extra mayo since I added an ingredient.  Sour cream would've been nice for a creamier flavor but once heated through, the taste is not too "mayo-y".  I will definately make again and just use sour cream and also add a little salt.

We really like this recipe.  I've made it 3 times and it's been delicious everytime.  I use the Bumblebee fancy lump crabmeat in a can instead of the imitation crab.

This recipe is pretty good! I used lite mayo and real lumped crab meat, and it turned out very tasty. Next time I may add a little more seasoning, though. Maybe salt or a little garlic. Overall, delicious.
