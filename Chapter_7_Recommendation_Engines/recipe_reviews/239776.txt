I made this for 4th of July. Loved it!!  I used 2 cups of the simple syrup instead of 2 1/2 cups--it was sweet enough with only 2 cups. I used spiced rum, not white which I feel gave the sangria an additional flavor. I served the sangria with frozen strawberries, lemon slices and orange slices.  Fantastic recipe!
