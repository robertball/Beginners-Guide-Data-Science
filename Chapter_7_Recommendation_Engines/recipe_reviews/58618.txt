I made this as an appetizer for Thanksgiving with my family. Everyone tried a bite but the overwhelming response was that noone liked it at all. Although everyone in my family does like blue cheese, it just didnt tast right and certainly didnt look appetizing when the candied nuts I had used...to add a little extra sweetness...started to change the dip to an awful brownish looking color. Overall, not good. We'll not make this again.

This has a great combo of ingredients and everyone loved it. I didn't have to time to make or find candies pecans, so I used regular ones, but toasted them first. Yum!

Very good mix of flavors.  I would add about 1/2 of the blue cheese, and a little sour cream as well.

This recipe was amazing.  I made my own candied pecans which I recommend.  The cranberries and pecans really complimented the blue cheese.

The sweetened dried cranberries with the glazed peacans make this spread.  I would like to offer a couple of tips - either add more cranberries or do a course chop of the cranberries so that each bite has some - a bite of this without a piece of the cranberries isn't nearly as good.  In addition to the pecans in the spread I sprinkle the outside with the  finely chopped glazed pecans.  This is hard to spread so make sure you plate it with a small knife- next time I might add a bit of sour cream to make it a bit more spreadable.   Thanks for a nice recipe.

I'm sorry, we just didn't care for this.  I used craisins and toasted, chopped pecans so the color was fine but the flavors just didn't seem to meld.  We love this combination in a salad form so I had high hopes.  I also added a bit of heavy cream to make this creamier/easier to spread and to dilute the strong blue cheese tang but it didn't seem to help.  Thanks anyway.

A HUGE hit at my party last night. I candied my own pecans (using a recipe on cooks.com)

I made this for Thanksgiving last year and it was requested again by my family. I doubled the recipe to serve 30 people and we had none leftover!

Fantastic!  I added some heavy cream (because I had it on hand) to thin this out just a bit.  I served it with slices of pears. Very delicious!

We loved this.  To the people who didn't like it, most didn't follow the recipe and used regular pecans as opposed to candied.  Don't give a recipe a bad rating if you don't follow it as written.
