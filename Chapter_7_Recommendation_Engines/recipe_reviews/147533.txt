This salad made a wonderful light Sunday night fall supper served with a nice crusty bread.  The only change I made was to add just a touch of honey to the dressing.  Very good!

I love this salad. I make it for dinner almost every week scaled down for two people. The only thing I do differently is saute the onion for a couple of minutes with the sausage. Thanks!

thanks for this most interesting recipe.  sorry i did change a couple of things but it was still good.  i didn't have pecans so used walnuts; some of my friends don't like blue cheese (don't know what's wrong with them!!) so i used parmesan instead. worked a treat. but i AM going to make it with blue next time - at least a small one for those who are blue lovers!

Wonderful! I used pine nuts and baby Romaine because that's what I had. Go easy on the onion; it can be overpowering. I also added 1 tsp sugar to the dressing to cut some of the tartness. We'll definitely be making this again. Thanks for giving us a new way to use up a bunch of arugula!

I am giving this recipe a three because the dressing is very bitter. It had a really unpleasant taste and ruined a great salad. My husband had the salad without the dressing. He used bottled honey mustard and said this was one of the best salads he's had. If you make this skip the dressing. It ruins a great salad!

Great salad!  I found that adding the sausage to the salad was so enjoyable.  I did add 1/2 tsp. of agava nectar to the dressing to cut the tartness. Real good!

This was awesome. Used goat cheese because I don't like blue cheese and added a bit of honey to the dressing. Sooo good, I was looking forward to leftovers but there weren't any.

EXCELLENT salad.  The only thing I did differently was to use chicken strips (will try with sausage next time) and add a dash of honey to the dressing.  The family loved it!

oh my!  I got both dandelion greens and arugula in my veggie box delivery this week.  i've never prepared either...so this was a perfect use of both for a first timer!  I also subbed the sausage with kielbasa and the blue cheese with gorgonzola.  SOOOOO good!

I loved the idea, but my results were far from great.  Would not make this again.

A really nice salad that is a change of pace. I especially like it as a green salad in winter.

dressing was simple and delicious. I used gorgonzola instead of blue cheese, and cooked the sausage on the grill. It turned out great!

I loved it. Hubby and son felt so so. Dressing needs a little sugar. Good light refreshing dinner.

This salad makes a decadent, filling meal!  While cooking the sausage, I added a splash of light beer to the end of the cooking time.  This added a nice balance to the apple sweetness.  Like others, I used goat cheese.  Instead of apples, roasted beet slices added great color.  Brown rice cooked in chicken broth garnished the side.  A new, healthy favorite!
