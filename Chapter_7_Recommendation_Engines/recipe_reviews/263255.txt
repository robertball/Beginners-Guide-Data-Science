Loved the flavor of this! I will definitely make it again, however I think I'll change up the method. I will cook the salmon first in some oil in a pan, remove to a plate to keep warm, then whisk the cream sauce in the pan. Then I'll either return the salmon to the pan to cover with sauce, or just serve the pan sauce over top of the salmon.  I found when the sauce simmered in the pan the whole time, the cream had a tendency to separate/curdle, and there wasn't a whole lot of liquid to simmer the fish in.  Very tasty and great for company!

Quick, simple, tasty. I put little extra curry in. I would probably put 1/2 teaspoon extra

I baked the salmon in the oven and simply poured the sauce over it on the plates.

Loved this recipe!  The sauce was awesome.  Very easy and charged with flavor.  Will definitely serve this again.  I did grill the salmon separately as well as the sauce....and then combined the two.  This kept the salmon with that grilled edge and the sauce was a perfect accompaniment.

Cannot give this salmon recipe even one star.  Made it exactly the same as shown online.  It is really terrible, no taste for the most part.  I wasted good salmon on it.  We ate some and the rest was donated to the garbage disposal.  Too bad this can’t be sent unless I highlight a star.  Poor rule.
