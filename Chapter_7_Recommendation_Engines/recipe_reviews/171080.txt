This is fantastic! I used frozen shrimp, marinated them overnight, and used sliced shallots instead of onion. Definitely making this for company. Thanks for a great recipe!

Fell in love with ceviche in Peru last year - thought I'd try some at home.  Used cooked, frozen shrimp and just let it marinate longer.  This was really good!  I didn't have the whole pepper so I put some chile paste in the mix, only a little onion since I don't care for them but like the flavor.  It's a wonderful blend of creamy (coconut milk), spicy (chile paste and pepper) and delicious (shrimp)!  I'm a little at a loss on how to serve it so will serve in martini glasses or just eat it out of the bowl!  Yum!
