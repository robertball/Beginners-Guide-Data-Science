A true juicy Lucy uses American cheese. Just fold into quarters -- no sense fussing with cutting out circles. Make sure edges are sealed. I use a little bit of water on edges to help "glue" together.

These were amazing from assembly to eating.  I’ve made other versions before, but the technique and finished burgers were sooo delicious!  Definitely a new favorite at my house!

This is an incredible burger. I did make it medium and added to the flavor and juiciness. Since  I am a freak for onions on burgers, I added caramelized vidalia onion along with the cheese to the center of the Juicy Lucy. WOW.  I also plan on trying this with some of Chef john's Bacon Jam as a topping. Just can't go wrong with bacon and onions.

This is amazing! As good as at least one of alleged original juicy lucy creator but without the drive and wait for a table. Based on other reviews, I used 80% fresh ground beef and Montreal steak seasoning in lieu of individual spices, and a slice of American cheese folded in quarters. Due to sweltering heat, I popped

I have to admit I worked garlic and onion flakes into the meat before forming patties. I used a biscuit cutter to cut the cheese. I also put a spoonful of chopped canned green chiles on top of the cheese before sealing. Heaven!

Chef John is absolutely right when he said this is a different experience than a normal cheese burger. This is now my go to for all burger parties.

I made these with USDA Choice Top Sirloin I get a Smart & Final for $3.99 lb. The steaks were a bit chewy grilling on my Traeger and tried cast iron skillet in oven. So I now grind them to make burgers which works out Great especially at $3.99 per lb. I made these and this will be my "go to" way of cooking cheese burgers. Another one of Chef John's favorites!!

When ever I have the time (having 2 kids) This is the best way to make a burger for  friends family and KIDS! They always love it!!! even though sometimes it's a little to much for the young crowd.   By the way I like to change it up with other things stuffed in here and there, what ever you like or have a taste for, and it's always awesome

Lives up to all the reviews I read before making it. I appreciate the cheese being in the middle. Well worth the try if you’re in the mood for hamburgers

My mother made these special burgers for a few of my birthdays.  In the late 1950's - early 1960's the ingredients were considered expensive, so they were truly a treat.

The cheese does, in fact, keep the inside meat perfectly rare as the outside browns.

First time I made I used sliced cheddar. It was a decent thickness but got lost in the burger. 2nd time I only did 2 oz patties and a nice thick1/4 in or so extra sharp cheddar chunk in. We loved the ratio. I also add tarragon flakes to the burger after Worcestershire. Next time I may even add some bacon bits and or caramelized onion to the inside,and a variety of cheeses. Boarshead  makes a horseradish cheddar that might be good.      So a much thicker slice of cheese makes this a five star for us. Thanks again for another great taste to try

Absolutely 5 star - this is the best homemade burger I've ever had! Easy assembly, and the cayenne adds a nice little kick.
