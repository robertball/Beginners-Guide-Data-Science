This soup looked intriguing, so I tried it tonight. It's fantastic! I followed the recipe exactly, but used red snapper instead of cod. I also didn't use a cup of red pepper flakes, since I think that's a mistake. I probably used 1/2 teaspoon and it was perfect for us. Great recipe though, worth every minute of preparation.

This is absolutely delicious.  I didn't have the leek or lemon so I put more onion.  I also used chicken stock instead but did add in a beef bouillon to compensate.  

Even my father who is not a fish fan ate every last drop.

I was looking for a new variety of fish soup, and this really hit the spot! It's delicious! We didn't have the cheese to go on top, but the baguettes with the topping really were not lacking without it. We only used 1 teaspoon of red pepper flakes, which had a great kick. Any more would have been a mistake. Instead of half-of-half, we mixed 1/4 cup cooking cream & 1/4 cup 1%milk. We didn't have cod, so we used tilapia filets, instead. Turned out great. For this amount of fluids, we used 2 lbs. of tilapia.

WARNING:  When blending hot fluids, don't seal the blender lid shut tight. I did this, and it exploded all over the kitchen, burning me in the process. I now know, leave the lid cracked and cover with a towel.

Thank for the amazing soup!!!

I found this inedible.  Too much wine in the broth.

Great dish! Made this for my hubby when he was sick with the flue, and he really enjoyed it. Didn't have any wine so replaced white wine with a little cider vinegar and water and the red wine by chicken stock. Really yummi. Will definitely do this one again.
