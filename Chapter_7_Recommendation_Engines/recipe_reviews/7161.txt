This made a lovely soft, light and fluffy dough.  Really east to work and handle, I think I could user it in lots of diferent ways, I used Fliimsy's idea for cinnamon rolls this time.  There was a little bit of a bitter taste from the baking soda (so not 5*) so I'm going to reduce the amount next time and hope I will still get good results. Thanks for the recipe.

Not only does this make good biscuits, it also makes great Cinnamon Buns.

Roll out the dough and sprinkle with cinnamon and both white and brown sugars.   Roll up and slice. Delicious!

I changed the instructions some. Used half whole wheat flour & half all purpose flour. I increased the oven temp to 400 degrees dropped the amount of time for baking. And skipped letting it rise. They turned out pretty good.   I also tried letting them rise for an hour and baking at the higher temp. They turned out a little lighter.

My family loved this. They smelled great while they were cooking. The texture is a little cakey. I had to add around 1/2 cup more flour to get the right consistency but the flavor is terrific.

great recipe... and so easy! I line the baking sheet with parchment paper 1st and don't even have to wash the sheet...  I do find that if you are rolling them out, you need to add about 1/4 - 1/3 cup more flour... I've never tried these with whole wheat flour, but I think I will next time

OMG I don't know what I did wrong but they did not rise very much.  The only thing I can think of is that I didn't let the starter sit out long enough to room temperature.  After only 20 minutes in the oven, they were almost burnt.  I had to throw them out.  Elly May Clampett's looked better than these!

very good flavor and texture. I have done several Herman recipes from this site and this is my favorite. I used a 1/4 cup of wheat flour and added a few tablespoons of ground flax and a2 tsp less of oil. they were great

Excellent --but was worried-no picture and a # of tales of woe. Herman is a sweet sourdough starter and these tasted sweet like they contained honey. I have learned to avoid the slow to rise problems by making the dough the night before--punching it down in the morning--making the dough balls [12] and letting them rise-- baking them at noon. Unlike french begets which can collapse with to much rise time Herman recipes respond well to this approach. Will include a photo next time these were devoured to quickly.

My biscuits turned out blah.  I used a sourdough starter I already had ready instead of the Herman starter which may have been the problem.

These didn't turn out well for me at all. They were flat...and very sweet. I was hoping for more of a sourdough biscuit. I had added garlic salt and shredded cheddar cheese and you couldn't even taste it...they were still very sweet.

For this recipe I just use my own sourdough starter wWhich is made from the wheat flour and water. To this recipe I like to add A bit of Italian seasoning garlic powder and the cheese of choice. I also managed to stretch to make about 13 biscuits every time and bake for only 17 minutes. The amount of time it says is required is WAY too long.

So easy & dough turned out beautiful! Had to keep adding flour while kneading to get correct texture. I rolled the dough into 16 balls & patted down a little. Next time I'll probably make a dozen larger size. Turns out between a biscuit & roll. Delicious flavor!
