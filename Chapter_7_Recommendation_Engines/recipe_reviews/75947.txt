These were easy and delicious!  However, being one who is trained and worked in Food Safety and Temperture Monitoring, I would recommend cutting the baking time almost in half.  Pork Chops need only cook to 160 degrees for Medium and 170 for well done.  You take them out of the oven when they are 10 degrees from where you want them to be because there is carry over cooking time.  This will keep them juicy...I cooked mine 15 minutes less then suggested and they were still way over cooked (190 degrees when I took them out).  So, a definite keeper recipe, using fresh mushrooms, but only need to bake about 20-25 minutes!

I did not have sherry on hand, so I substituted it with apple juice. The chops were very tender and tasty.  Definitly worth the effort.

I didn't have canned mushrooms so I used 1 8 oz package of presliced mushrooms. I didn't have beef broth either so I used 2 cups hot water and a knorr beef bouillon cube.  It turned out so good my bf ate 3 and his friend had 2.  I only got 1.  It makes alot of gravy so I made mashed potatoes with it.  All you need is a vegi.  Gravy was so good my bf ate his peas with the gravy on it (he does not like peas).  I can't say enough about this dish it was so good. Thank you for sharing a wonderful dish that I will make to get those ohhhs and ahhhs.

The first time I made this the only modification I made was to use fresh mushrooms. As it stands, I would give the original recipe a 3. But with modifications, I think this could easily be a 4 or 5. Here is what I now do. First, I use a dutch oven for the whole thing so there is not bother with two pans. In the dutch oven when the  butter is melted, I add about 1/2 minced onion and a couple sprigs of thyme, in addition to the garlic. After browning the pork chops, I add the mushrooms, cooking for a minute or two and then the sherry (the kind you drink, not the cooking kind) to deglaze, cooking on high until it's almost evaporated, about 6 or so minutes. Then I add the beef broth, bring to a new boil, cover and stick in the oven. I only cook for 35 minutes covered and 10 minutes uncovered. DH and I both enjoy this and I tend to think pork chops are just "okay."

I did the entire thing on stove top. When it was time to add the cornstarch, I pulled the chops out, added the cornstarch/water mix to the thickness I wanted, than added some Classico pesto sauce (to taste - about 2 - 3 T) and then, bleu cheese salad dressing (Maria's - about 1 - 2 T) to give it a little kick. Put the chops back in, warmed everything up and had it over brown rice. Amazing with adding pesto and bleu cheese can do!

I added one sliced onion and I also used fresh mushrooms. This was easy enough to make but we didn't really care for it. It really was inedible. In my opinion, there was too much sherry. Maybe cut it in half, at least? It just tasted too much like alcohol and you couldn't taste any of the other ingredients. If I'd had time, I would have read through the reviews first. My mistake. We had frozen pizza for dinner and dinner was WAY late. NOT HAPPY.

Recipe came out great, thanks to my meat thermometer.  As mentioned earlier, the cook time for this is too long.  I also used flour to thicken instead of corn starch, as I don't like clear gravy.  We liked it, and it is now in the rotation.

This is the best recipe yet from this site. I will definetly be making this again. I served over a bed of rice and made extra sauce to put on the rice. Fresh asparagus sauteed in butter also goes great with this recipe. I felt like I was dining in a fancy restaurant. Bravo!!

i subbed apple juice for the sherry since i dont keep it on hand and this is by far one of the best pork chop  recipe ive tried on this site. i did add about a half of a sliced white onion to the pan when i did the garlic and i sprinkled the chops with ms dash before i cooked them. very slight changes i dont think altered the recipe a bit. this was amazing and great with mashed potatoes green beans and a tomato salad. ill make this alot this winter!

Dad and I loved these. Since it was only the 2 of us eating dinner tonight, I only made 4 chops, and I also used fresh mushrooms. I baked them for 45 minutes, and my chops (boneless 1/2 thick) were perfectly tender and not overdone at all. My gravy was a little thin, but that was my fault, cause I didn't get the sherry/beef broth mixture boiling before adding the cornstarch. I served these with homemade mashed potatoes and corn. I'll definitely be making this again.

This turned out so good! Used fresh mushrooms and instead of the sherry I used red cooking wine. I cooked everything in the skillet. I can not imagine cooking pork chops for as long as stated. In the skillet I cooked for about 15 minutes. The gravy is the best! Great with mashed potatoes.

reduced the number of chops to three, but made full amount of gravy.  Served gravy on potatoes too.  Used 1/3 cup Marsala in place of sherry. Following others advice, only baked 25 minutes. Chops and gravy delicious.  Chops tender.

This is a great recipe without using canned ingredients. I've made this several times now, the only change I make is leaving out the sherry, as I don't like cooking with alcohol.

My family loved this recipe! I will definitely make this again.I also used apple juice instead of sherry. I did not put the cops back in the oven after the 45 minutes of cooking, they were done and very tender. Oh and used fresh mushrooms!

This would have been an amazing recipe but the cook time is based on a thick pork chops (learned that the hard way). I cut cook time covered by 20 min and were still overcooked. I don't feel cooking them for an additional 15 uncovered was necessary either. Check after 25 covered and if cooked pull them out and continue with instructions. The gravy was delicious and I will definitely make this again being sure to cook for way less time.

If it's made to the letter, the chops come out way over done, 1 T of butter is not enough fat to cook even two pork chops, and the garlic gets burnt and bitter tasting.  I cooked over medium heat to try to avoid this, but even on medium heat the garlic ends up burned.

I recommend using 2T of olive oil to brown the chops, and adding the 1 T of butter and garlic AFTER the chops are out of the pan.  Slightly brown the garlic and deglaze with the sherry/wine.  I also agree that 1 cup was way too much wine.  I used 1/2 that much.

Amazingly delicious with a couple changes:
Browned pork chops on medium-high heat for probably less than 2 minutes on each side and got great caramelization 
Used fresh mushroom slices 
Used red wine and chicken broth to deglaze the pan to make sauce
Baked for about 30 minutes (any longer is really unnecessary) and used a meat thermometer
Added a pat of butter and flour to thicken sauce

They were very flavorful and juicy.

I just made this and it was DELICIOUS!!  I used fresh mushrooms instead of canned.  I didn't have any beef broth, but substituted chicken bouillon with 2 cups water.  I also didn't have any sherry, so I used white cooking wine instead. Sooo yummy!!  ALSO, only cooked in oven 15 min. covered and 15 min. uncovered...30 min. total.  I seved with mashed potatoes and green beans.  Mmmm

This recipe had mixed reviews from my family.  I just thought it was ok; however my husband and his friend loved it and raved about it (maybe it's a guy thing?)  I wouldn't make it again for myself; but have already made it a second time for my husband's benefit.
I did like that it didn't use the mushroom soup you so often see.  My husband has high blood pressure so we try to eat as close to salt-free as possible.

Good basic recipe, but unfortunately, we followed it without checking all the comments about shortening the cooking time, so while they tasted good with the gravy, the meat was too tough. Next time, we'll cut the time as recommended.

This is a great recipe. I modified it a bit based on others' comments, but it's basically great. All I changed was doubling the gravy amounts with the exception of the sherry. I used apple juice as others who had no sherry had suggested. But, while I doubled the other original ingredient amounts, I halved the original ingredient amount for sherry and substituted it with apple juice. It received excellent reviews from my partner. Did not taste like apple at all.

I love this recipe. I cook it for a shorter amount of time and combine this recipe with the baked pork chops I recipe on this site, meaning I bread the pork chops with Italian seasoning bread crumbs and used a can of condensed mushroom soup in the gravy.

These were wonderful! I, of course, used fresh mushrooms instead of canned ones. And I did reduce the cooking time.  But aside from that? Perfect! Even my two young children devoured them.

Based on other comments, I shortened the cooking time and used a meat thermometer.  I probably browned the chops too long because mine were at 170 degrees in 30 minutes. I added one half sweet onion chopped, used 3 8oz packages of fresh sliced mushrooms and substituted chardonnay for the sherry (only because that is what I had on hand).  All in all it is a good recipe, I am going to try the mushroom gravy with other meats. I served this with steamed cauliflower and some great crusty bread

I have a house full of pork chop fans and nobody cared for this recipe. I think it was strong sherry flavour that turned everyone off.

Very tasty. Overdosed on stock, because I had a quart of beef stock canned a while back, and because I had more pork chops to cook than good sense. So instead of water I just added the juices to the cornstarch at the end. Made great gravy.

Excellent flavor, easy to make.  I think the cooking time was too long though.  I'll be making it again.  Will knock off about 15 of the 45 minutes.  The sherry seemed like it would over power this dish, but it was all good in the end.  Don't worry like I was worrying.  Good dish!

We loved this, but with my changes.  I used olive oil instead of butter and I also used fresh mushrooms, about one pound, sauteed first.

I cooked this on the stove top. Browned the pork chops as directed, sauteed some fresh mushrooms in the same pan, then added the "broth" ingredients and let simmer on low for 30 minutes. Removed the pork chops and added the cornstarch/water to thicken the sauce. I served this with mashed potatoes (with the sauce spooned over the top) and steamed spinach. The chops were very good, tender and fairly juicy inside. I would make this again.

We buy pork chops in bulk and I'm always looking for a good way to cook them.  This recipe was delicious.  I didn't have sherry or beef broth on hand so I substituted apple juice and chicken broth.  It turned out fabulous.  Also to make it more of a meal, I added broccoli to the gravy.  I served it all on a bed of rice.  We'll be using this one again and again.  Thank you.

Way to much sherry.  Was more like a wine reduction than a gravy.  I planned to serve with mash potatoes and we had to eat the potatoes plain.

Simple and delicious. My hubs loves smothered pork chops and this was a hit here. I used low sodium SeasonAll and canned mushrooms and thick boneless  pork loin chops that were butterflied. I didn't have sherry so I just used more beef broth in it's place. My sauce really didn't thicken much but it still turned out a fabulous man pleasing dish. Thanks for Grandma's recipe!

I did bread my chops with some Italian bread crumbs. I used one cast iron skillet, just removed the chops to a plate while deglazing and making the broth.  I then put my chops back into the skillet and baked. The reason for four stars is the time is too long, my chops were well done in 45 minutes and they were pretty thick. I'd make again with fresh mushrooms. The gravy was good, I did use low sodium beef broth. Very good with mashed potatoes.

My chops were one inch thick, and the cooking time was perfect.  The only changes I made were to up the garlic to six cloves and to lay the chops on a bed of vidalia onion rings in the baking dish. I used fresh mushrooms rather than canned, and also added just a bit of sage. Quite delicious!

Delicious. Since this is basically a braise, I used decent sized bone-in pork sirloin chops. Because of their size, I doubled the gravy ingredients so the chops could remain mostly submerged. I probably could have increased the amount of gravy by only 50%, but it was so darn delicious I'm glad I didn't. By the way, don't saute the garlic until after you've browned the chops in a little oil. Otherwise you'll just burn it up, along with the butter. With the extra gravy I increased the lid-on cooking time by half an hour, and the lid-off time by 15 minutes. The only change I might make next time would be to use stock instead of broth. I highly recommend doing what other reviewers did, as far as using a dutch oven to sear the chops, saute the garlic, deglaze with the sherry, then throw everything back in for cooking in the oven.

When I read the reviews I thought they were fairly positive.  I noticed someone complaining about lack of flavor, but just dismissed it.  Well, I made recipe about a week ago - and that person was quite right.  There was no flavor.  I used fresh mini bella mushrooms with pork loin.  It all looked lovely, but it was completely tasteless.  I think it needs something with zip - like fresh rosemary.  Just something other than salt and pepper.  Disappointed.

Was very happy with how tender the pork chops turned out. The recipe did not specify bone-in chops or not, but I used boneless and it worked great. Definately a keeper....even my 3-year old loved it.

I agree with everyone on here who said to CUT THE COOKING TIME.  I wish I had listened.  The pork chops turned out very rough & dry even though they had cooked in a delightful sauce.  I couldn't believe how dry they were.  The sauce itself is wonderful.  Next time, I will definitely cook the pork chops for less time and see what happens.

Wonderful meal!  Did not have beef broth or sherry, used chicken broth and white wine.  Paid attention to the fact did not need to bake for 60 minutes.  Baked boneless chops for 20 minutes covered and then 10 minutes uncovered.  Will definitely make this over and over again.

Great recipe--especially since it is not canned soup based. This sauce is also good with chicken breast and artichokes (use all the sherry). You may substitute a veggie stock for beef. Thanks Heidi!

I used pork tenderloin and an 8 oz package of fresh sliced mushrooms instead of canned.  I couldn't bring myself to use that much sherry, so I used 1 can beef broth, 1/4 cup sherry and the rest apple juice. I didn't have cornstarch on hand, so I used a few tablespoons flour mixed with a few tablespoons the juices after it came out of the oven. I whisked in to the rest of the juices and it thickened up nicely. Turned out excellent!

I'm not a big pork chop fan, but thought I'd give this recipe a try with boneless center cut chops.  The store was out of plain beef broth, so I used Swanson's Onion Beef Broth. My husband and son loved it.  The chops were tender (even though I overcooked them a bit) and the gravy was delicious.  Next time I'll cut the cooking time down by at least 15 mts.  And - by popular demand - there WILL be a next time!

Terrific quick recipe and a great alternative to "the can".  I did take some liberties with the cooking method and a few ingredient tweaks since I was using super thin cut pork chops.  I used Montreal on the chops so skipped added garlic to the pan and browned in a mix of butter and shallot infused oil.  I removed chops and added mushrooms and onion to the pan, sauted until soft, then added a can of french onion soup, sherry, cold butter, and a slurry of sherry/flour to thicken.  Lots of nice cracked black pepper and a few shakes of dried bouquet garni, too. Added the pork chops back into the sauce and let them gently simmer for a half hour or so on the stove.  Just delicious.  Great base, glad I found your recipe & thanks for sharing with AR.

My husband and I enjoyed this recipe very much. I purchased two large, thick bone in Pork Chops. I followed the recipe as written except for using fresh mushrooms, 2 cloves of garlic and Tapioca Flour to make it gluten free and a few sprigs of fresh thyme.  Only had to bake them for 25 minutes covered and 5 minutes uncovered. We don't like our meat over-cooked, so I used a thermometer.  Pork was tender and moist. Let the pork rest, while I made the gravy.  I did use a good drinking sherry, which I believe makes all the difference.  I cooked it all in one dutch oven. I set the pork chops on a plate while I sautéed the mushrooms and deglazed the pan, then added them back to the pan. Gravy was wonderful!  Will be making this again and again!  Thank you for sharing.

Excellent!  Cut the sherry down to 1/2 cup, and added more beef broth to compensate. Used fresh baby portobellos. Ran out of cornstarch so used flour to thicken gravy. Didn't change anything else.  Will definitely cook this one again.  Served w/spinach and mashed sweet potato w/diced jalepenos.

My husband and I loved this recipe.  I made it almost as written.  The only difference is I used fresh mushrooms and sauteed them in a little additional olive oil.  I also added a bit of onion and some fresh rosemary to the mushroom mixture. My intention was to bake them for 30 minutes but my hubby is funny about pork so I baked them for 45 minutes.  They were a tiny bit tough but with the gravy that goes over them, they were simply delicious.  I also made some mashed potatoes and the gravy was delish on those as well.  I will be making these again.  Thanks for sharing!

I gave this 5 stars because it was super easy to make. Don't let the header "takes a little bit of work" may you shy away. I thought it was very simple. I like a thin gravy and this suited me fine. I did add scallions while cooking the garlic the garlic. Perfect with mashed potatos, sour cream & chives. Delicious.

This was really good. I made just a few modifications: I used fresh mushrooms and onion. I only cooked 30 minutes covered because the chops were almost one inch thick. I then cooked another 10 minutes uncovered. Thanks for sharing a great comfort food.

I thought that sauce/gravy was great, had a ton of flavor and was the perfect thickness.  However, I thought the pork chops had very little flavor.

I didn't follow the recipe exactly, but it's a good base to start with. I had fresh mushrooms rather than canned, but this was the only recipe I found that didn't use cream of mushroom soup. I added half an onion and a little thyme. After tasting, I added some garlic powder as I could barely taste the garlic. I don't have sherry, so I used more beef broth and a splash of white wine vinegar. I removed the chops after a short time as they cooked quickly and I didn't want them to dry out, and kept them warm in the oven while I continued to cook down the gravy. I served it with mashed red potatoes and corn. It wasn't the best gravy I ever made, but it was pretty good with a little adjustment.

This did not turn out well for me.  The sherry was overpowering.   I cut the cook time down significantly but the meat was still tough.  Not the kid-pleaser I was hoping for.

YUMM!  This is now a staple in my home.  USE THE SHERRY.  It truly gives it a rich, lucious flavor.  Just make sure you allow it to cook off. I usually have wine in the house so I've used both white and red and both produced excellent results.  I make lots of gravy and serve with mashed potatoes and a veggie with fresh Italian bread.  What great comfort food.  Thank you grandma!

These were very good; I used fresh portobello and baby bell mushrooms. The sauce was a little thin, but better the second day after being refrigerated (since I only cooked 2 chops, I had leftover sauce, which I used the next day on pan seared checked breasts).

These were great!  Serve with homemade mashed potatoes.  GOOD stuff!!  I would use boneless pork chops with this recipe, otherwise you can get little shards of bone in your gravy. Easy and fast.

This was extremely bland as is. I instead used fresh mushrooms (who uses canned mushrooms anyway?), some hot peppers, coriander and fennel, and served it with grilled eggplant and rice pasta. Very good if it's changed!

I used fresh creminis, more garlic, and thickened the sauce with a roux instead of corn starch. The gravy was great over some red potatoes mashed with garlic. This works as a salisbury steak recipe too, just sub some round or cube steak for the pork.

Excellent!  After an hour in the oven, the pork fell off the bone.  This time I used cooking sherry which made the gravy a bit too salty, next time I'll use "real" sherry.  I followed the recipe exactly, except I used fresh mushrooms which I sauteed in the pan before adding the broth and sherry.

We all really enjoyed this very tasty recipe.  The only things I did differently were that I used chicken stock instead of beef broth (didn't have any at home), used fresh mushrooms instead of canned, and I didn't make the gravy and just used the remaining juice with the mushrooms as a side.  I should have made more pork chops because everybody wanted seconds!

We really liked this recipe. I used garlic salt instead of regular salt when I seasoned the chops. I think I might have gone a little heavy though. The end result was a bit salty. The overall flavor, texture, and color was terrific and I'll definatly make this again.  Thanks for the great recipe.

Very tasty though the pork is dry. I used 3/4" center cut & sirloin chops, the first time as directed, the second cutting the cooking time by 10 min & 5 min, also putting the chops back into the gravy each time while the rest of the dinner finished. I wonder if if the cooking time is still too long?????

I gave this recipe 4 stars because I thought the sauce was excellent, even though the chops were a little dry. My husband wasn't as thrilled with it and would only give it 3 stars.

Wow what a great recipe.  We didn't have any cooking sherry, so we used cooking wine and chicken broth instead of beef broth.  We also added an extra can of mushrooms.  This is definitely a keeper.

My husband absolutely loved this recipe.  The chops were so tender.  I put them back into the gravey for 10 more minutes after thickening it on the stove top.  Gave them a nice color.  Used cooking sherry that I found in the supermarket.  Was very good, but I thought 1 cup was a litte too much of an alcohol taste...but as I say, hubby loved it.  It's a keeper!

This was my first time cooking with Sherry.  I also couldn't bring myself to use 1 cup.  Just used 1/2 cup and 1/2 cup apple juice.  Kids refused to eat it.  Husband ate one but also didn't care for it.

This was wonderful.  I was concerned about the amount of sherry, but it gave the gravy a very good flavor.  I also served mashed potatoes to take advantage of all the gravy.

If you like the taste of alcohol in your food, then this is the recipe for you.  All I could taste was the Sherry and it was extremely strong.  I would suggest to cut back on the Sherry and maybe add some apple juice or something.  I thought it was awful and was a big waste of time and money.

This was fantastic.  The sherry makes a rich tasting gravy.   I made a few small changes.  I used half the sherry (I used Harvey's Bristol Cream).  I also added chopped onion to the garlic and mushrooms.    After thickening the gravy I added back the browned chops and topped  them with the shrooms and onions.  I cooked them on stove top, very low heat for about 30 minutes.    I think this was the best pork chop gravy I have ever tasted!  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

This turned out nothing like the featured picture.  Was flour used to coat the chops?  It certainly looks breaded.  Anyway, the flavor was fine; would make it again, but will bread it first.  Only made 3 chops, so I baked it 20 minutes (15 may have been good enough, though), with 10 minutes without foil.

This is just how Pork chops in Mushroom gravy should taste. LOVE it!!! Added a little Cayenne pepper for a kick! The gravy is wonderful over rice, potato, stuffing or even noodles, I have done it all. My husband and my son love it too. Thanks

I have made this twice now in the last 2 weeks and LOVE it!! So very good. The first time I did nlt have beef broth or sherry so I used 2 bullion cubes and 3 cups water to ake a little extra gravy and I used white cooking wine instead of Sherry and it was very good. The gravy is great on potatoes on the side also which is what I did. I also shortened the baking time to about 20 minutes and an additional 15 because I think I cooked it a little longer when I pan fried it. I cooked it in a cast iron skillet which i just used to put straight into the oven and made making the gravy easy. The second time I used fresh button mushrooms aand actual beef broth but still used the white wine since it was so darn tasty the first time. Definitely a kepper!!

Awesome!  very easy to throw together on a busy or lazy night!  Served with mashed potatoes, canned peas and carrot sticks!  Yummy!  It turned out very tender, I put in the oven for only maybe 15 mins.....
Thanks for the recipe!  Oh ya, and it was seasoned with La Grill chicken spice.....before browned in the skillet   :)

I cooked this exactly as the recipe called for, and it was fantastic. The only thing I would experiment with is using fresh mushrooms instead of canned to cut down the sodium, and adding some onion.  Very tasty!

No canned soups places this recipe way up there in ratings, but no canned mushrooms would rate it even higher. I suggest fresh mushrooms, and this will be a smashing success. Got my pork chops in the skillet already, and I won't even bother with the oven . . . finish the chops in the skillet, remove & keep them warm while you make the sauce in the skillet. Tender juicy chops & incredibly tasty sauce.

Per the reviews we reduced the cooking time. Next time will use a meat thermometer. Added a minced shallot because I like them.  Used fresh mushrooms, and thickened with flour because had no corn starch.  3 of 4 of us loved it.  Served with mashed potatoes.  Will double the gravy next time because it we added more broth and sherry and we still ate it all! Thanks for the recipe.

Made this for my sweet hubby who has a paranoia about anything 'cream of mushroom' based. He enjoyed the flavor although did comment he missed a little creaminess. Cooked a thick bone-in chop for 30 minutes, which was plenty. I thought the texture was a bit tough but hubby said it was just right. A good no-fail recipe for pork chops!

This was a really good recipe!  The only ingredient variation I made was fresh mushrooms. The beef broth I used came in a 14.5 oz can, so I used the left over broth in the dutch oven when the chops were 'just browned,' and I went ahead and put them in the oven with the broth.. This way it didn't take quite as long to bake them.. As soon as my mushroom mix was completed, I poured all of it in together.. The meat was VERY tender, and I liked the sherry taste in it.. I rarely cook with wines, so this was a nice change!  I served with mashed potatoes, corn and biscuits.. Thanks for the recipe!

Rather than using the oven, I prepared this on the stove top, simmering the chops for about an hour. They were very tender and moist, however the dish itself was very bland. I might try making this again, using various seasonings to add more flavor.

Absolutely delicious!!
I've made the recipe once and it's the one request I keep getting since!  The mushroom gravy tastes great on baked potatoes too (going to try it on a veggie burger for my hubby tonight).
The only thing I would add is some sauted onions.

These pork chops were delicious!!  They smelled so good when they were cooking, too.  Will definately make them again.  Next time, I won't even bother with the corn starch and water.  Good stuff!!!

I made this using boneless pork loin chops so definitely recommend reducing the total cooking time to 20 - 25 minutes. Fresh mushrooms are a must!

Not bad.  Made as written but used fresh mushrooms and served over noodles.  Next time I will cut the cooking time down.  The pork chops were not as tender as we like.  Did like the gravy a lot.

A fine recipe.  I give it 5 stars mainly because my husband says these are the most tender pork chops he's ever had.  The flavor was a bit subtle; perhaps I'll add a little rosemary or thyme next time, along with more garlic.  I also used canned mushrooms; next time I'll use fresh.  The gravy was very silky.  A keeper.  Thanks!!

We really enjoyed this dinner, which we served with boiled/mashed rutabagas and parsnips mixed together and fresh spinach. The only changes we made were that we used fresh mushrooms instead of canned, and we only used a 1/4 cup of sherry, which seemed to be plenty.

The leftover sauce, when mixed with home-made vegetable broth made an excellent soup the next day.

FANTASTIC!  Great recipe for when I pull frozen boneless pork chops out of the freezer .... knowing I usually am going to have a tasteless meal, but I am tired and I don’t care.  But WOW these are not those!  Easy to make, common ingredients for me to have on hand, impressive presentation to serve.  Will be making again and again.

And I also think this would be a great recipe when multiplied to serve to a large group of people.  Thank you Grandma!

Loved it. Family loved it.  Substituted fresh baby portabella for canned mushrooms and used cast iron skillet for browning and cast iron Dutch oven for baking and gravy. Pork was super tender and moist. I also used thick cut chops and did course sea salt tenderizing for 1 hour at room temp before browning.

Really good site. Recently widowed, after 29 years. Did not pay a lot  attention to my wonderful wife’s cooking .  I just ate her great tasting food. She would ask me me what I wanted for dinner. Them boom a very very delicious meal. I should have payed more attention. But as you Ladies know, I am a man. Buy I can cook. My wife said doorway do a man’s heart is through his stomach. Boy was she was right. I was 17 when I met her and she was 16. Even then she cooked really great food. Always asking me, when I came to her house, are you hungry? When I said no , she said what did you eat today!!! And don’t lie!!! Then she would make me some food. I really like this site. It’s explained idiot proof.

The flavor was phenomenal!  I followed the recipe to the letter, except I used minced garlic.  He only negative comment I can make is that, if you are using 1/2" thick pork chops, cut the cooking time in half.  I expect that the timing was worked out with thick chops, but the thinner ones were overlooked and dry.  I'm sure that it will be perfect with adjusted cooking times!

OMG are people actually using canned mushrooms.  It is a last resort item I use in chili con carne if no fresh ones available.  This is a full on 5 star recipe when I substituted sautéed baby bellas instead.. So yummy with the sherry. Thanks for the recipe and it just needs a fresh mush. addition, Edit...also fot those who are having issue with alcohol taste or even using it....boil in step 3 until alchohol is burned off  and u get a tasty syrup. MARSALA is a wonderful sub.  There are sweet sherries and marsalas/madeiras so use what u want for personal taste'

I had to use chicken broth, but otherwise I followed the ingredient list.  The cooking time is not to today's standards, so it was ready in less time than listed.  I didn't need to put the chops in the oven at all.  With a few changes in preparation,  this becomes a nice dinner!  Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe is easy to make, and you can work on the rest of your meal while it's in the oven. I didn't have any sherry, so I substituted 1/2 cup vinegar, 1/2 cup water, and a teaspoon of sugar. I wondered about using beef broth instead of chicken broth, but the beef broth added some umami I think the chicken broth wouldn't have had. The chops were tender, moist, and flavorful. Mashed potatoes are good to soak up the extra gravy. I'll definitely make this again.

This really came out nice. I've made it twice. First time exactly how it is written, 2nd time with very minor changes. I added a few extra garlic cloves, added a tbls of Olive Oil to pan to keep butter from browning too much, changed the mushrooms to fresh, and sautéed the mushrooms and caramelized 1/4 of an onion in pan before adding the liquid. I added a 1/2 tsp of Rosemary to liquid before pouring it onto the chops and sticking in oven. I also flipped the chop when I removed the lid for final 15 minutes as I used 2 inch bone in chops and wanted the protruding part to not dry out. Served along with crispy baked potatoes and slightly steamed then sautéed green beans. Will definitely make this again. Easy way to get tender chops without frying or having to smoke out your kitchen with cast iron or slow cook them. Thanks for sharing this. Reserved the leftover gravy for mashed potatoes later this week.

A diced onion was sautéed with the garlic. I modified the baking time to 20 mins. w/ lid, then 15 more without lid. Served with mashed potatoes and green beans. My family really liked it, I loved it!

This hit the spot.  I used fresh mushrooms, but other than that I followed the recipe exactly.  Only mistake was cooking it for the full time.  Definitely should cut that time in half for a more tender pork chop!

Very good but needed modifications.  Cooking time does need to adjust based on the thickness of the chops. I did a total of 45 mins in the oven which was a little too much. However, cooking in the liquid meant the meat was very tender and falling apart.  I used fresh mushrooms, bone broth instead of beef, and arrowroot instead of cornstarch. I also added some fresh rosemary. It's not quite paleo with the Sherry in it, but close enough for me. The flavor was very good!

Good recipe, very easy.  But cooking time must be shortened; I checked them after 20 minutes with the instant read thermo and they were at 155 degrees, which was perfect for us; after resting for a while they would have been at 160 degrees or more, cooked to medium.

I used more garlic and butter than called for, fresh mushrooms and chicken stock and 3/4 cup sake as substitutes.  

Not a big flavor punch but still yummy and much healthier than using canned mushroom soup.  My 12 year old son loved them, will make again.

This recipe was super easy to make and it was delicious.  For next time, I would use fresh mushrooms instead of canned and I did add a bay leaf to the gravy while cooking in the oven.  Overall, delicious way to eat pork chops!

The gravy was good, but the pork was far too overcooked.  It was so tough and dry that my son and husband threw most of theirs away.  If I made this again, I would seriously reduce the baking time.

I used green onions instead of chives, and chicken boullion instead of beef broth. FRESH mushrooms too!! I used sherry and a bit of chardonnay, and only baked for 30 mins., then uncovered for about 5 minutes as my chops were not too thick. I think I could've cooked them less.  It was delicious none the less, served with buttered peas.  YUM!!!!

Very good I must say.  45 min seems long but I believe it's going by how thick the chops are.  I used more beef broth and less sherry a cup seemed to overpowering so I used 1/2 cup.  I used pork chops on the bone so it would cook nice and soft.  I would definitely make this again!

I cook them until internal temp is 145° (safe according to national pork board), producing a much juicer chop.
I prefer to brown the chops and finish in the oven, making the sauce and pouring over the chops.

Use 1 pack fresh mushrooms and half an onion, pinch of thyme. 3/4 cup white wine and 1/2 teaspoon molasses instead of sherry. Make extra gravy for sides. Cook 20 minutes in the oven uncovered. Use flour instead of cornstarch. Serve with garlic mashed potatoes and green beans. Will make again and again!

Made this tonight and it was delicious.  Used center cut boneless chops, baked them for 25 minutes  and they were perfect.  Next time I will add onions just because I like them.  Great recipe, quick and easy. Will make these again .

It was good and I would make it again.  Like some of the reviews suggested, I used fresh mushrooms (white button and cremimi).  I didn't have one full cup of sherry so I used to white wine to make up the difference.   As suggested in one of the recent reviews, I didn't cook it as long as suggested.  I took it out 10 minutes early.

This was delicious! I used 4 pork chops for my family of 4 but kept the amounts the same. I made some minor changes because of our preferences and what I had on hand.  I subbed apple juice for sherry and added some  onion because we like it.  I used fresh mushrooms because I had them.   It does make a lot of gravy so I made mashed potatoes. I also decreased the total baking time to about 45 minutes and I let the chops rest while I made the gravy. And as far as the some other reviewer's comments about it being bland, as with any recipe add the amount of spices your family likes.  I used plenty of garlic and sprinkled the pork chops liberally with Lawry's seasoned salt.

Fantastic recipe! Mostly because of what I had on h and,  I used fresh mushrooms, added more garlic, and used some of the red wine (malbec)  I was drinking and some cooking wine. As some reviewers have said, cut the cooking time in half and I used thick cut chops. Not a difficult recipe but does take a little time, but very much worth it.

I used fresh mushrooms as some have suggested and it did only take about a half hour to cook to 170 in my oven.  I used red wine because I couldn't find sherry.  Very good, a keeper.

This recipe is easy and delicious.  It will be one of my favorite go-to recipes.    Used ingredients I had on hand rather than make a trip to the store.  Used merlot and a can of french onion soup which is just beef broth with onion in it.   I also used fresh mushrooms which is always my preference over canned and overly salty mushrooms.

I didn't have Dry Sherry and didn't want to go to the liquor store to get it so I substituted cooking wine red. I also used Portabello mushrooms instead of canned mushrooms put them on top.  It was amazing my family loved it.  Although next time my sister sis said I should add apples or pears to it.

Made this with a few modifications. Only used 3 large pork steaks. No sherry, extra H2O and canned mushroom liquid, added onion powder since I had none fresh. Done entirely on the stove. Took the chops out just to make the gravy. Served with buttered rice and green beans. Total time for all... 25 minutes. Will make again. Thanks for the recipe.

AWESOME recipe. I was a little worried about it, because some of the reviews said it was bland. FAR from it! Very flavorful. I made it with garlic mashed potatoes and steamed veggies. I did cut back on the cook time based on the reviews. They were delicious and my husband loved them!

I made this last night and it was awesome.  I wish I had known years ago how easy it is to make your own gravy. After reading over many reviews, I decided to make a few changes to the recipe. I diced about 1/3 cup of onions and sauteed them with the mushrooms. I cut down the cooking wine to 1/2 cup which was plenty, so I'm glad I did that. I also added 1/4 teaspoon thyme. I used thin cut pork tenderloin and cooked the whole dish in my electric skillet. It was awesome.

My husband liked it but I didn't.  My gravy did not turn out like gravy, more like a slightly thick mushroom juice.  I thought that it did not have any flavor.  Usually when I make a recipe for the first time I make it exactly as the recipe states.  After I took the foil off and was going to let it cook for 15 minutes with it off, I read some of the reviews and saw how their pork was over cooked so I took it out right away.  Mine was dry but edible, good thing I took it out when I did.  If I make it again I will use more seasoning on the pork and use twice the amount of cornstarch and water, or try flour instead.  Sherri's pic made this look so good.

This was very good and I made the recipe as written.  My pork chops were very overdone and dry regardless of the gravy.  This is why I only gave it a 3 instead of a 4.  I will make it again, but will cook the 'broth' in the oven a little while before I add the chops.

Okay, I did alter this recipe slightly. Some reviews said it was bland, so i seasoned my chops and gravy with pepper, garlic powder (omitted fresh garlic cuz I'm lazy like that), and onion powder. I also seasoned the chops with salt but didn't add any to the gravy bc the broth is full of salt. I also used fresh mushrooms bc canned shrooms are flavorless and pointless imo. With the alterations, it came out perfect. Will be making time and time again!!!

This dish is fabulous! If you like pork chops, and LOVE mushrooms, you will not be disappointed. I made this for my parents last night. Needless to say, I got back empty plates with nothing but the bones. LOL I did alter the recipe a bit. Since it called for six (6) pork chops - I ended up buying six (6) 2" thick pork chops. They were huge. But I have a Dutch Oven so they fit in there nicely. I also used a 14 oz. can of beef broth (instead of the listed 10.5 oz can) and at my local grocery store, instead of buying an 8 oz. can of mushrooms, which to me, wasn't many at all, I bought two (2) huge containers of sliced white mushrooms. I mean if you love mushrooms, you can't go wrong with adding as many as you desire. The flavor of the gravy was to die for. I will certainly be making this again! P.S. - If you've never bought dry sherry before and want to know where to get it; liquor store.

I'm not a huge fan of pork chops, but my husband is. He really liked this recipe. Pork chops were very tender and had alot of flavor. Simple meal and  not too much to clean up afterwards.

Used fresh mushrooms instead of canned. Also used a flour base instead of cornstarch. Apple Juice instead of Sherry. The cooking time in the oven is too much. My pork ended up a bit dry, even though it was cooked in the juices. I will definately try this recipe again. The gravy is delicious.

It turned out awesome, my husband loved this .  I used Campbell's Golden Mushroom soup and a little water instead of the beef broth and also added the onion.  I  also used real Sherry Wine and it turned out most excellent.  I will make this again for sure.

Just ok, I did add onions and used white wine instead of sherry. If it wasn't for the pepper I added, it seemed bland to us.
