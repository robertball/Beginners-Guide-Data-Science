Simple, quick, and they disappear faster than I can make 'em! These don't crumble as easily as other recipes I've tried, and seem like they'd work well as decorated cut-outs (we ate them plain). I like my shortbread just a touch sweeter, so I added a couple tablespoons more sugar to the second batch--YUM! You could also sprinkle a little extra sugar on top before baking if desired. If it won't roll out well, try chilling it for about 30 minutes in the fridge first, especially if you didn't use cold butter. Or add a little more flour if it's sticky. I also suggest you use your (clean) hands to mix the dough, to get that perfect, smooth texture!

I just finished trying this recipe and have got to say that it is my new 'go to' cookie recipe. I used confectioners sugar instead of white, (I added 1/4 cup more for a little extra sweetness) added a tablespoon of vanilla, and replaced a tablespoon of flour for corn starch. I did not need to refrigerate the dough, in fact I used a little less of the flour mixture and rolled up 1 inch balls and placed them on the cookie sheet. Then I flattened them with a fork, pushed a little hole in the middle and filled them with jam. mmmmmmm yummmy!

I found this to be exactly what I was looking for.  I didn't feel like rolling and cutting them all out so I baked them like a bar and I added some crushed pecans!  So Good!

This was a great recipe and held together nicely. I have never had much success with using a roll out dough (new to baking) and this went perfectly none of my rabbits lot an ear. They had good flavor and even held up in the cookie jar. The kids loved them. thank's for a great recipe.

This recipe worked great.  I used my KitchenAid mixer, and used the dough hook for the kneading part, and only 2 cups of flour as stated.  I did use cold butter, as someone stated previously.  They rolled out wonderfully on a marble slab and I was able to use my star shaped cookie cutters without a hitch!  Tasted great.

Far easier and faster than my usual recipe.  Family wanted it a bit sweeter, added 3 more tablespoons of sugar with the second batch.  They loved them! Thank you!

These are the measurements I used in Scotland, where I lived for fifteen years.  Simple recipes are the best and this remains the most authentic recipe on the site.  Just remember TWO flour, ONE butter, HALF sugar. Easy.

DELICIOUS OPTION: This recipe is very robust and can stand up to a little messing about. Feel free to throw in a small handful of raisins or chocolate chips when adding the flour.

This is very easy to make, however, I wasn't too pleased with the flavor.  It was sort of plain.  It rolled out easily and baked up nicely, but just didn't have that shortbread flavor I was looking for.

A very simple and yummy recipe.  COLD butter helps quite a bit.  With a little extra sugar, they taste just like store bought English shortbread biscuits.  Very yummy.

Basic ingredients for a basic shortbread cookie. They tasted absolutely fantastic and melted in your mouth when they were still warm, but after they cooled a few minutes later, the cookies did not have that melt in your mouth, creamy shortbread texture that I was looking for. The taste though was excellent. I added 1 tspn vanilla extract for a little more taste. I had a ton of chocolate baking wafers, so I put one in the middle of each of my cookies to make them look prettier and for a little chocolate treat. Easy to make and great tasting, but as for the authentic 'shortbread' factor, I would say it's lacking in the texture compartment.

You can't ask for a dough to come together any faster. However, I tried using cold butter like another reviewer suggested. I'm not sure how that would ever work. I just ended up flinging tiny cubes of butter all over my counter. No problem, I just put the whole bowl in the microwave for 20 seconds. Then it fluffed up just fine. I added the zest of two lemons and 1 teaspoon of lemon extract. After baking just until they barely started to brown on the bottom, I put them face down in powered sugar while still hot. That melts on a thin layer of the sugar. I think they look nice that way, taste fantastic and I think it helps keep them soft. Who doesn't love a tastey recipe with only 3 ingredients! For those who think they come out plain, think of them as a blank canvas. Add what sounds good to you. Next time I think I'll do a cinnamon  pecan shortbread. Yum.

Fast and easy~ the dough requires no refrigeration, it is easy to roll out and cut and the shapes stay together and come out of the cookie cutter easily.  They stay together after baking and the flavor is SUBLIME~ PERFECT.
Absolutely the best cookies I have ever made or eaten, well worth the work and the calories. Thanks Carl! ~Mompryor

We all loved this! I added just a tad more flour, enough to make it less sticky to work with. It then rolled beautifully. I added a cherry to the center of each cookie. Thanks for the recipe!

Funny story. I was supposed to make some cookies, a recipe of my own, but after pulling out everything i need, i realized i'm missing one thing... 1 egg that's required to make my cookies. So i hopped on all recipes and searched for an eggless cookie recipe and stumbled across this one. truth be told, i've been wanting to make shortbread cookies for the longest time, strawberry shortbread cookies to be exact. So I was ecstatic when I found this recipe. It couldn't be any more simple than this and it's easily modifiable. I made heart and bear shaped cookies and somewhat thumbprinted them, put some strawberry jam, and baked as the recipe instructed. after they were made, i put them on a plate in the kitchen. We have a family of 5 that aren't really into sweets but everytime i popped by the kitchen, the plate seemed to be lacking some cookies. and so the cookies were disappearing and within a day, they were gone. (i cut the recipe in half btw cuz we only had half a cup of butter... yes, i was in need to grocery shopping). So just today, I realized we have more butter and since everyone liked them so much, I made more :P I'll upload a picture once they cool... if there are any left anyways.

I make this shortbread every year at Christmas time... and it 'ages' well --it tastes even more rich and delicious a couple of days later!  I also use it to make a fabulously rich crust for my cobbler and pecan pies!

Wonderful! I did add a bit of vanilla and a pinch of salt (unsalted butter) Well, it was my teenage son actually who made them with some assistance. He made some dulce de leche too and with this recipe managed to get 60+ small rounds which he sandwiched into 30 caramel filled cookies. I'm jealous of his class who get to eat them tomorrow, but at least we got to sample them first. Very nice.

Awesome, simply, easy recipe. I wanted to make sugar cookies for the kids to decorate for Christmas, but didn't want to take the time to refrigerate the dough... found this recipe and followed it exactly. At first I thought I'd done something wrong - the dough seemed super crumbly - but as I started working it and rolling it it smoothed out nicely. The cookies are VERY fragile while still warm but once cooled they're firm & won't break... they held their snowman, Christmas tree, and candy cane shapes very well without the cookie itself being hard to bite into. VERY tasty and a fun, easy, quick cookie to make.  This has definitely become my "Go To" recipe. I brought a plate of these to a church function and they were gone instantly!

This is fabulous recipe! I gave it 4 stars because the shortbread is a bit dry but still taste's excellent. I added some almond extract (1tsp per batch) to give some extra flavoring. Instead of doing cuts outs (too time consuming and messy), I rolled the dough into balls and slightly pressed them down. Baked as directed, let cool, then dipped half the cookie in chocolate (melted choc chips with a little butter in the microwave). They went fast! This is the only recipe I will ever use.

Absolutely delicious, and so easy to make! I added 1/4 tsp of salt to the dough for more flavor. I also found that the dough was a little hard to work with, though. I ended up adding more about 2 tbs. of extra flour, and it was still really hard to roll and cut with cookie cutters. I used a ton of flour for rolling, and by the end, the dough was easy to work with. Next time I make these, though, I will probably add about 1/4 cup of extra flour to the dough before I attempt rolling. I used festive cookie cutters (a maple leaf and an acorn) and piped melted chocolate chips onto each baked cookie for decoration. They turned out really cute, and everyone loved them. Thanks so much for sharing this great recipe!

These were great!  I was also a wee bit lazy and just firmly pressed these into a brownie pan and baked a bit longer and then cut into strips.  WONDERFUL.  One thing I did do was to lightly brush the top with milk and then sprinkled granulated sugar on top to give it a light sheen.  Thank you for the recipe.  This is a real treat!

For some reason, when I cooked these for the listed minimum of 12 minutes, they were burnt and crispy. That was my fault, though, I thought I could leave for a few minutes and when I came back they'd be done. Next time I bake these I'll make sure I watch the stove!

Simple recipe with quite a nice flavor. As other reviewers recommended I put in 3/4 cup of sugar instead of 1/2 cup and also added a teaspoon of vanilla. I didn't have an electric mixer to heated the butter to about half-melted, then creamed. The results turned out great. However, the third time I made it I heated the butter too long to completely melted. The resulting dough was very crumbly. I added a bit of flour and waited for the dough to chill a while and it turned out fine.  One note: if you add vanilla be sure it is a good quality one otherwise it leaves a bad taste.  I also tried this with a couple teaspoons of fresh lime juice instead of vanilla and dipped them in powdered sugar while warm. This was a hit with me and my husband and I'll be making more of these! Very versatile dough.

Best cookies EVER! :) I was never a fan of those overly sweetened sugar cookies. These shortbread cookies are AMAZING COOKIES! Just perfect! :) My mixer was broken so I decided to hand mix the batter. Hand mixing cold butter is a pain so I just stuck the butter in the mircowave for 10 second -- enough to just soften the butter. I added a bit over sugar than required. The mixture was too crumbly and kept falling apart so I added about a 1/2 teaspoon of milk or more. This made the batter real nice! The batter didn't crumbled or fall. When hand mixing -- USE  MILK! :)

I did as was instructed, made at Christmas time and in HUGE batches- I customized the recipe to a yield of 100. I added a little bit of vanilla to the mix, and after 3 hours of rolling, cutting and baking they were all done! A great recipe!

This came out rather a disaster. The dough was crumbling and I couldn't even try to roll it out. I added more flour, like the recipe suggested, but it didn't work, even when I kept it in the fridge for the whole night. Added couple eggs and kept in the fridge for three more hours - still useless. Not sure if I can even make something of it later, just a waste of products.

Very good! nice and soft, melt in your mouth, I pushed them off a teaspoon and pushed gently down with a fork and put a cherry on top.

I loved this recipe, but made a few changes to save time.  I used just two cups of flour, unsifted, and added vanilla and fresh grated rind of an orange.  I dropped a teaspoon onto the cookie sheet, flattened a little and sprinkled with coarse sugar.  Very good flavor.  I only cooked enough to eat fresh & stored the rest of the dough in the refrigerator to bake as needed.

I made these for a bake sale and got huge reviews in the kitchen at taste testing time  : )  
Will make these again. Double the recipe at least to get a good amount.

I made 2 batches; one as is which turned out pretty good. but then the second batch I added 1/4 cup of cornstarch and they baked up lighter and super delicious!
I love how quick and simple this recipe is I made 2 batches in well under an hour and got about 6 or 7 dozen cut out cookies (about an inch and a half sized cookie cutters)

When I tried this, the dough was all crumbly....tried doctoring it up..didn't want to put any milk in it (for some reason and didn't have any eggs at the time.) So, I decided to go out and buy some instead of keep screwing around with it... Next time? Maybe.

This recipe was the perfect base for what I needed. I needed a recipe for my dairy allergic child to bring to school and decorate with his classmates. I substituted the butter for vegetable shortening and I used icing sugar/confectioners sugar instead of the white sugar for a finer look. The cookies were perfect, held together for decorating and still melted in your mouth. Not too sweet either. Thanks for posting, this is definitely going into my baking repetiore

They were easy to make with the kids but not much taste even though we increased the sugar by 1/4 cup and added a touch of almond extract. I wouldn't make them again.

These taste great. Next time I'll roll them a little thicker. I thought 1/4 inch was a bit too thin, but that is personal preference and nothing to fault with this simple recipe. I made heart-shaped cookied and dipped half of each heart in chocolate.

Wow, this is good.  I followed other reviewers hints and added a teaspoon of vanilla and a couple tablespoons more of sugar; pressed dough out in a metal pan, scored with a pizza cutter. A hit.

Great recipe!  Cookies literally "melt" in your mouth.  For flavor I add 2 teaspoonsful each of almond and vanilla extracts and a cream cheese frosting w/ sprinkles on top of cookies. Food coloring adds a nice touch as well (see my uploaded photo*).

Yummy and buttery!  I bake these in a cookie sheet and cut them into bars.  After they bake, I top w/ a bag of semi-sweet chocolate chips, let them melt, and then spread across the top.  Put in fridge to cool and eat.

By far the best shortbread I've ever made or eaten.  I am already imagining the possibilities for add-ins such as orange or lemon zest, lavender, cinnamon...but they are fantastic as is. I made these tonight and cut them out with a salmon shaped cookie cutter and dipped the "tails" in melted chocolate.  I'm bringing them to a work Christmas potluck tomorrow and I know they'll disappear fast.  I softened the butter just slightly enough for it to easily cream with the sugar, but not so soft that the dough got too messy. I made them a little on the thin side and baked for 11 minutes.  These are delicious!

Fantastic recipe. I beat the butter for about five minutes before adding the sugar, then another eight minutes or so with the sugar added. I did end up poking holes in the shortbread with the end of a spoon and then adding some jam before cooking them, which was a lovely addition; but all on its own, this recipe produces a wonderful, not-too-sweet shortbread.

This made a lovely crisp biscuit(though I think I over cooked mine a tad) and I did add in a little vanilla as I was using butter flavoured margarine and not the real deal. Sweet, crumbly, crunchy and pretty  tasty! Really easy, I left my dough in the fridge for about 15 mins though before attempting to roll and shape it. A great result from so few ingredients!My only comment is that they are a little bit bland, but if you're after a nice, sweet, plain biscuit, this will do fine.

What a great recipe!, simple and yet delicious. I have used this recipe so many times now. :) I do have a tip for this recipe, instead of regular  sugar use powdered sugar and it just gives it that extra crummy texture and taste to it!, also use an electric mixer if possible makes it quicker and easier to mix and doesn't  change anything

This is a very good, easy shortbread.  I like my browned a bit more, because they are crispy when cooled.  They held their shape really well when use cut outs.  Very impressed.

I tried this recipe and everything came out as described. I even added a touch of vanilla.  However I was disappointed in the taste, it was not rich tasting as I would have expected for a "supreme" shortbread.

So easy to make, and tastes great! I was looking for a recipe for a cookie exchange, and this will be perfect. Just made a test batch, and I won't need to alter it in any way. My only word of caution is to use flour on the cookie cutters, the doughy is a bit sticky.

UPDATE _ TIPS! ***Be sure to use really really soft butter, wrap in plastic wrap and plunk in the fridge until cool to the touch.  Roll out with a little flour, but be sure to keep them THICK as they don't rise very much and cut them with a cutter and you're good to go!*** Awesome. Cut into circles and Put a quarter of a maraschino cherry on top of each one before cooking. cooked them for only about 8 mins (have a hot oven) Delicious! :) Just like gramma used to make (gave her some and she asked me where i found her recipe!)

Perfect!  Just like grandma made.  Just remember to add only as much flour needed and not handling the dough with hands so much.  Thank you for sharing!

I've never made shortbread before and this was INCREDIBLY easy and very delicious.  The dough was easy to handle but I just dropped them onto the cookie sheet.
Thanks.  Thanks. & more thanks.  
Even the batter is very good tasting.
Will DEFINITELY make them again.
Have emailed this recipe to my sister too.  
NOT disappointed.
I agree, Christmas only, large quantities.  
Out of 10, how about an 11.  
The only thing I disliked was not the taste (to die for) was that some of the cookies were too crumbly when I took them off the sheet and they broke apart too easily so they were not a complete cookie, at least, not all of them.  
But, hey, I'm diabetic so I get a slight taste without raising my sugar too high.

These were awesome!  I sprinkled colored sugar on these after cutting them out but they would be equally delicious with some frosting which I will definately try.  They held up well to cookie cutters especially after putting in the freezer for 10 minutes.

These are soooo good and super easy to make! Thanks for sharing this recipe!  P.S. Make sure you press the dough really hard and flatten it before rolling it out because it's impossible to handle the dough when crumbly.

My new favorite cookie recipe.  This is great if you want to make iced cookies quickly.  (Which I did!)  No chill time for the dough, and the cookies come out light and buttery.  They weren't too sweet either, so the frosting was a nice addition, rather than too much sugar.  I will say that I have tried this with Land O Lakes margarine and it worked almost as well as butter, but try it with butter first.

These cookies are great!  Not too sweet, very easy to make and go wonderfully with coffee or tea.  I also made them with a tsp of vanilla the 2nd time and that was also wonderful.

Yummy! Altho I'm not sure how you can get very many 1/4" inch cookies out of that amount of dough. Mine were thinner because I wanted a greater quantity. I also had to bake them for 13-15 minutes to get them done. Only then did they show a slight golden color.

I made it exactly as the recipe states and I found the dough a little crumbly when I rolled it out so I added a few drops of water.  End result were beautiful Christmas shaped, tasty cookies.  My family loved them!

Like others have experienced, the dough turned into a crumbly mess. I’m not sure how anyone had it come out well when I followed this recipe exactly. I now have to try to find another recipe similar to salvage this one. We didn’t even make it to the oven - sorry. This one is a dud for me. :(

This is the recipe my 100 year old Scottish Grannie used to teach me how to make shortbread. When making by hand, there comes a point where the dough is very crumbly and will not hold together. Don’t add water, milk or an egg; just keep kneading. The warmth of your hands will cause it to come together. The baking temperature is way too high. It should be 275 to 300 degrees Fahrenheit for 20 minutes or until golden. Grannie also lined her baking sheets with two layers of heavy brown paper. Store in an airtight container or someone could break a tooth. lol. Thanks for sharing!

I made these shortbread cookies and substituted 1/2 the sugar with 1/2 Splenda. It worked very well.  Dough freezes well too, I wrapped the dough in parchment paper, tied at both ends. Dated and placed in the freezer.

I will definitely make these again.

Thank you so much. I finally made a recipe of cookies & it became cookies. The recipe is easy,  the cookies taste delicious, & I had added 50gms of sweetened coconut, & it is even more delicious.

Im gonna make this recipe more times for sure.

Now, its time for some coffee, maybe tea with my delicious homemade shortbread cookies...YUMMY, ;)

Was crumbly, the sugar didn't melt, and I am a experienced baker. Overall, it was still good.

Made shortbread cookies for the first time tonight and absolutely love this recipe. I did a little bit of a heaping 1/2 c. of sugar (not to much) and it turned out perfect. Thanks for the recipe ?

I made this today and - keeping in mind some comments I read - I added both vanilla and almond - these are not terribly sweet so might benefit from more sugar but if you're like me and decorate with chocolate then that's enough added sweetness.  Excellent cookie - one of the easiest shortbreads I've ever made...I make ALOT of different cookies and I like to try varied and new recipes - so when I say these are top 10 easiest that means out of hundreds of recipes these made the top 10.

This is my first time making shortbread, and it turned out great. I wanted to try out shortbread Christmas cookies this year, rather than sugar cookies, and the consistency came out perfect.  These will be easy to decorate with icing.

Needed a quick and easy shortbread cookie to take to school for a birthday party. These were perfect! Family had to hold back from eating them so there would be enough for the class party. The Kitchenaid is the only way to go. I took the advice from another reviewer and used the dough hook to knead the dough. Easy,  easy and more easy.

These were amazing.  They do lack flavor but just add 1-2 teaspoons of vanilla or almond extract.  I frosted these and they turned out great.  Rolled out really easily.

These were easy to make but I found them a little delicate.  I made them to add to my treat boxes for the holidays, and I'm not sure they will hold up well for packing and traveling. We'll see. Three cookies broke as I was moving them to the cooling rack, even though I let them sit for a full 5 minutes. Perhaps I made them a little too thin. I enjoyed the light, not-too-sweet taste, and added my sweetness by sprinkling colored sugar on top.  I rate this recipe a 4 for taste and ease of preparation. Next time I will make these when I plan to keep them at home while entertaining.

Just what I needed for my base cookie.  I added one lime, juice and zest, plus one tbs grated jalapeño and a little salt and the cookie was fabulous!  Especially with the jalapeño lime icing added on top.  Super yummy!

Makes great cut-out cookies.  The dough is really easy to handle.  I've these cookies a few times with my little ones.  They taste really good too.  I usually put icing on them - but they are good without.

Perfect cookies absolutley delicious!... I did add 1 tsp vanilla and chilled the dough for about 30 min... I do suggest checking them after 9 min off baking these cookies bake pretty fast and I think the baking time depends on how thick your cookies are I rolled them to about 1/4 inch thick and the baked really quickly about 9-10 min or so

There is no way this recipe can hold together with anything near 2 cups of flour.  I had to add about a full extra cup to be able to roll the dough.  They cooked perfectly.  I added a tsp of vanilla essence but they still tasted a little bit bland. I think Next time I'll increase increase the sugar to 3/4 cups. I chilled them overnite once done and they had a great shortbread texture.  All in all, I'd make them again, if for no other reason than the simplicity of the recipe.

This is the same recipe that has been passed down in my family for almost 5 generations.  The key to these, is that you have to bake them, and put them in an airtight cookie tin, and let them mellow for about 2 weeks before you eat them, then drink them with your Grandma with a cuppa tea.  Then they are not just good they are AWESOME! Miss you much grandma!

Absolutely awesome recipe; simple and everyone loves them. My only complaint is that as a shortbread rookie I found the directions a bit vague, it should be noted that the butter needs to be room temperature otherwise your dough won't come together.

Sadly, not what I would call supreme. This just was not the shortbread flavor I was hoping for. If I am going to splurge on an unhealthy cookie - it should taste awesome! I will say that they weren't so awful that I threw them away. I added crushed heath bars to the top before baking the rest of them and those were okay. I won't make these again though. Sorry.

Yum!! These are so deelish and buttery! I also increased the sugar to 3/4 cup.  Some I made plain, others I used thin confectioner's sugar icing.  Found that kneading the dough after mixing and refrigerating for a few minutes helps.  I cut these into bar/squares.

out of control deliciousness.  I changed the sugar to 3/4 cup per a pastry chef's recommendation and have added vanilla extract or lemon extract (1/2 tsp) for variations.  So good.  Egg free, too, so good for kids with allergies.  Excellent for dunking in coffee.

I made these to dip in various kinds of chocolate and give away, and they were well-received. However, I found them to be a little harsh and grainy without the added chocolate, though it wasn't very noticeable with it. Perhaps it just needed more or less mixing; will have to try again. Still, very simple recipe, very versatile cookie for decorating or adding on to.

Great recipe for last minute shortbread. I don't like recipes that use icing sugar and i didn't have time to cure a true shortbread. I added a touch more sugar (in response to earlier reviews) and sprinkled some more on top. A little chewier than usual shortbread but the flavour was nice. Will make again.

This is a wonderful recipe. I used it to make thumbprint cookies with strawberry jam in the middle and it was delicious!

We patted this dough into a tart pan as the base for a fruit pizza. It was just right for most of my guests but I thought it was a bit bland. I think needing a better quality butter might have been my problem

I had a recipe for shortbreqad handed down through the family, but this was so much easier and took half the time!  I also added a bit more sugar and about a 1/4 cup more sugar. My family ate almost all of them in one night!

This was a tasty and easy recipe. I will say, if you are using butter make sure it is softened slighly when beating with the sugar. otherwise it will stick in the beaters. I found the best way to cook these was in the top part of the oven for 11 minutes. I used cookie cutters and decorated with a little icing sugar with water and vanilla extract, and sprinkles. Very nice.

This recipe turned out perfectly.  I rolled out the dough and cut it into squares.  Then I pressed a pecan half into each.  These are very rich!

The cookie is absolutely delicious (I love that it is not too sweet) but when rolling out the dough it didn't roll out quite as smoothly as I hoped, the bit of flour helped and cooling the dough. I used X-Mas cookie cutters and they look wonderful and hold nicely.

I tried this recipe to use in my cookie press. I had to refrigerate the dough for about 20-30 minutes (no fault of the recipe!), and it worked wonderfully! The cookies are not very sweet, but very good. I plan on making several to give as gifts this Christmas.

Yikes!  I have just had the biggest problem with this recipe.  I may be shortbread challenged, but this dough was not rolling out for me at all, then once I finally got the cookies onto the baking sheet it was browning unevenly when baked.  I have just dumped the last half of my dough in the trash because it doesn't seem worth it to continue.  Plus, my unevenly browned cookies would really need to be iced in order to be tasty.  My suggestion - try another recipe if you intend to do more traditional cookie cut-outs.
