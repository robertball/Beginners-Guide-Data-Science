We loved it... It was light and delicious.  I add lots of parmesan and threw in a small amount of shredded mozzarella at the very end to make it a little more cheesy and flavorful.  I couldn't find the bag of Dole Extra Veggie in my grocery store, so I used some spinach leaves and grape tomatoes.  I will make this again!

Really good. I left out the sausage. Added fresh spinach and it wilted nicely. Lots of parm, and a little shredded mozzarella.
