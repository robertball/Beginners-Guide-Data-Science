A perfect recipe, fulfilling every criteria of a 5-star rating--thanks, Ken from CA!  The ingredient list is accurate & the instructions clear. If anything, this underpromises & overdelivers. (Three times, my normally-quiet husband said, “My God, this is good.”)  Specifics:   (1) PREPARATION.  Easy! This is a restaurant-quality dish, which puzzled our dinner guests, who asked if my schedule had changed since it seemed I’d been cooking all afternoon. (2) RELIABILITY.  Follow the instructions & there’s no way to mess this up.  (I made a couple of mistakes—the phone rang while I brought the milk to a boil; no problem—just skim the overboil and add more milk. I also set my gas burner too high, allowing the milk to boil down too quickly; adding more milk was an instant fix.)  (3) FLEXIBILITY.  Don’t hesitate if you have a smaller loin, or maybe a larger one (as in our case). Substitute garlic salt for regular, if you wish.  Etc.  (4) PLATING. Carving‘s a pleasure because the pork’s just-right tender and manageable.  (5) SERVICE. There are a variety of options. Since the finished pork and gravy looked scrumptious, I decided to carve at the table, thus set the whole loin on an oblong serving dish, surrounding it with sliced tomatoes and mixed lettuce leaves. (6) BONUS. The gravy makes itself! * DO* COOK DOWN THE MILK TILL IT’S THICK, CURDLED AND GOLDEN BROWN. THE SAVORY KERNELS WILL POP IN YOUR MOUTH.

Any pork loin will work for this.  Tying it just helps maintain its shape.  And my recipe didn't call for it to be trimmed.  Actually, you want some fat on it.  Fat is flavor.  If you cover this completely, it will overcook.  The lid should be about 3/4 on so it can vent over a nice simmer.  I think people are covering this or cooking over too high a heat, because this is one of the most foolproof ways to cook pork LOIN (not tenderloin).

When i was preparing this recipe, i thought i must be doing something wrong because it looked weird and how could curdled milk possibly taste good. Well, don't be fooled, although it does not have the prettiest presentation, the flavor is amazing. Highly recommend and im sure any pork roast would work fine

This is to die for. You need to try it! I'm going to cut the salt in half next time though -- we could only eat tiny portions of the wonderful brown kernel sauce because the salt was just too much for us. We do tend to be low-sodium kinda people, though, I guess the low sodium diet has finally succeeded in changing our tastebuds! This smells so divine and looks like you slaved for hours, when really, you just prepped it and left it for a few hours! Thanks for the recipe, Ken, I'm sure we'll have this again! (To those who wound up with dry meat -- you need to use a deep pot, so that the meat is swimming in as deep a milk mixture as you can get. I also turned my roast (using tongs!) halfway through to keep the top from getting too dry.)

This is a recipe that I had saved almost from the day it was published and never got around to making until tonight. I had some pork medallions that were in my freezer needing to be used. I decided that if this recipe was intended for a roast, then it would also be fine with what I had, and right I was. Followed the recipe exactly only I did up the garlic to two cloves and used dried rosemary. I do think it's essential that a heavy bottomed dutch oven be used. It produces a nice even heat distribution for even cooking and no problem with recreating the sauce to look like it was intended. Great job Ken and thanks for thinking outside the "box" with this one.

Delicious. A very tender, moist pork loin. Tying I did not do and had no problem with it. I asked Ken, in the exchange, if I had done the sauce right. He said it should have been cooked longer til it turned more brown. Albeit, it wasn't a nutty brown it was still very, very good. Thanks for the recipe Ken!

I am glad I tried this recipe but found that it just wasn't for me.  It was too salty and the meat turned out dry.  I did like the 'milk curds' but again...too saltly. I prefer more seasonings.  Interesting recipe though...

I used 2% milk and this turned out great - don't over salt your pork or the sauce will be salty (I didn't measure the salt and it was a tad salty but not too much).  Since I didn't allow my picky kids to eat this with ketchup they tried the sauce and all but the 3 year old liked it.  Thanks Ken.

OMG!  This is amazing!  Thank YOU, KEN!  My Hubby thinks I can cook a little, now! The meat was tender, the milk browned perfectly into little chunks and were delicious.  I served with mashed potatoes and mixed veggies.  Hubby took a bite, and "Mmmmm!  See what happens when you follow a recipe?!" *lol* And I learned a new technique!  Thank you for your personal assistance and confidence in me (or was it the recipe? :D), and thank you, as well as, for this recipe, and for teaching me that I, too, can do a gourmet meal!  And it was easy!  Thanks again!

very interesting recipe, Ken. I used 1/2 the salt-personal taste. After browning the pork loin I set it in the slow cooker. I poured milk into the pan to heat and slowly cooked off the tasty bits of meat that stuck to the pan. The milk made me leary when it was time to make the gravy but I strained the liquid and it was fairly clear.  I sauteed some onion, added the liquid, thickened it with corn starch and flour. Thanks for the recipe.

Wonderful, easy concept of cooking a pork loin and tasty gravy all in one pot. I always know when a recipe's a keeper when I watch my husband's face after the first bite, and see his eyebrows raise up in approval. He commented on the tenderness of the chops and tasty gravy. (I checked with Ken about using extra thick pork loin chops a/o that's what I had in the freezer. They worked just fine.) We like bold, savory flavors so in addition to 1/2 tsp of dried rosemary, I added 1/2 tsp each of sage and thyme. Very nice, Ken. Well done. Cathy in CA.

My ex-boyfriend made something similar awhile back so I couldn't believe it when I saw the recipe. This totally delivers - the pork is so tender and the gravy is flavorful! I halted the cooking and then started up again to reheat - and it was still great! My only complaint is that the gravy was a little on the sweet side - but that may have been my fault with the reheat and the effect it had on the rosemary. Will make again for sure and this time for a dinner party! Sure to be a crowd pleaser! Follow the recipe exactly for best results - thanks Ken!!

This was a hit here. I thought it had a nice herby flavor with the thyme and was a very homey comfort type food. I used double the black pepper, twice the butter and skipped the veg oil, used 2% milk and dried rosemary and tossed in a couple of bay leaves because I have to tweak. It's an obsession, can't help it :) The milk sauce separated and wasn't really a sauce and never got another color besides light golden and looked like it needed straining but no matter as the husband took a bite, declared it very good and then said it would perfect with egg noodles, and specifically asked me to make this like "chicken and noodles". I looked in my pantry, found 2 packages of opened dried egg noodles and tossed them into the pot, and the meat just sort of fell apart, and hubby was very pleased with his pork and noodle dinner. (WaHoo for using up leftover bits from the cupboard!!!) Thanks Ken, my man is very happy now and loved his meal!

Followed the recipe closely, used half the salt listed and a  boneless pork loin roast (not a tenderloin). Pork was not very tender. The brown buttery kernels were quite yummy. Not sure if I would try this again.

I have to admit, reading some of the reviews of "curdled bites that pop in your mouth" had me a little hesitant to try this.  My sauce was not as pretty as the pictures but the overall taste was very good. Ken had recommended I try this recipe a long time ago when I complained on the recipe buzz that I had some pieces of very dry pork loin.  This did the trick. The pork was moist and flavorful. I will make it again and try to get a prettier outcome.  :O)

I've made this with both chops and roasts, we(my family) loved both but did prefer the roast.  The only change I made was making more sauce, only because it is so so good. Great recipe...you gotta try it

This was so easy and turned out really tasty.  I used pork tenderloin which made it even better.  Also, I didn't bother with tying it at all, just sliced off the silver skin and got started.  Delicious and super easy recipe that was a hit at my dinner party!

This is great, so simple and delicious! I used 3 lbs. of boneless country style ribs, making sure to trim off the extra chunks of fat. I definitely left enough on for flavor. It only took about an hour and I served it with whole grain rice and asparagus. The whole family cleaned their plates! Thank you for an easy and tasty recipe!

According to my incredibly picky teenage daughter, this pork is amazing!  We all loved it and I'll definitely be making it again.

The recipe is perfect as it is and I wouldn't make any changes to it.  Thanks Ken!

I would never make this again.  It was way too dry and the sauce was curdled.  Nonetheless, it tasted pretty good and my family liked it.

Thanks, Ken for showing me pork doesn't have to be greasy, dry and flavorless.  Recipes like this are changing this non pork eater into a convert.  I had to make a few adaptations to suit our needs.  I used extra thick cut center loin chops, that worked out just fine.  Then, I realized I only buy skim milk so I mixed it 50-50 with half and half.  That worked out fine too.  The kitchen smelled great, the meat was moist and tender and the milk curdled itself up into the most amazing little bursts of flavor.  Wonderful recipe, thanks for sharing.

Very tasty. Though about adding a little heavy cream at the end when I was finishing the curds.

I will use this recipe again and thought the meat was nice and tender and had good flavor. It wasn't over the top but good enough to use as a change in the way I normally cook it. It is more for the family, in my opinion, vice company as it's appearance is more like "comfort" food than elegant for a special occasion. I used pork loin chops.

YUM! My roast was half the size of the one called for so I halved the recipe and there wasn't really enough sauce, so if you reduce the milk and other ingredients, only do so by maybe a quarter.

The taste was very good. I don't think I cooked down my sauce enough because it wasn't too brown and there were no "kernels" as other reviewers described and which can be seen in photos of the recipe. I used a beef blade roast instead of a pork loin. The meat did get a little tough, but was still edible. I think that next time I will try removing the beef while it is medium-rare and focusing on "curdling" the sauce. Thanks for a good recipe, Ken!

Thanks for a great recipe! I had a boneless pork shoulder which I cubed into 2 inch chunks, trimmed most of the fat, and browned in bacon drippings (of 5 slices of crisped up bacon). Brought the milk to boil, then simmered on low most of the way covered about 1.5 hrs. Then uncovered and reduced until I got the desired consistency. Some of the most tender and flavorful pork ever!

I followed the recipe exactly with the only tweak being more garlic. Absolutely delicious. Did a 4lb pork loin the first time and this time only doing 1 1/2 lb. And making pierogies to go with it.

I follow a low carb diet so I used heavy cream instead of milk.  I used half cream and half water.  It turned out so yummy!  I'll  definitely make this again.

My results agree with others - fat adds flavor, and a pork shoulder roast works better than a pork loin roast, though it really does need tying.  Also, turning the meat every half hour  and keeping the liquid level about 1/3-1/2 way up the roast keeps it moist.  The milk really does curdle, but it is the magic ingredient that tenderizes the meat.   Pollan suggests that if the curdy appearance bothers you, you can throw the finished gravy into a food processor to break down the curds into a creamy sauce that is better looking and just as heavenly as the chunky version.  Anyway, try it!  It is the best!  Try it the Etruscan way, with sage.  The leftovers are even better the next day.  Yum!

I've got to think I did something not quite right. The taste was wonderful; the seasoning is spot on and the pork came out fork tender. My problem was the milk gravy - while it thickened reasonably well, the little 'curds' mentioned by other reviewers as 'savory' and 'pop in your mouth' just didn't happen for me. It was really just like lumpy gravy. I made this while in a rented vacation cottage with an electric stove; as I am used to a gas stove, this may have been an issue. I will definitely try this one again, though, because the tender and flavorful pork is worth another try!

This is amazing! Fresh rosemary is a must. I also added a little extra rosemary and garlic. Soooo good and tender! I don't think I had to cook it quite as long as the recipe called for though. The first time I made it, it was dry. The second time I cut down on the cook time and it was perfection. Kids loved it!

This was really easy and was well received by my family.  Like others who are short of all the listed ingredients, I changed a few items; used skim milk, added dried onion flakes, and because I used FF milk, I had to add flour-milk to the gravy so as to thicken it up.  Did this all on a dutch oven on the stove top.  Certainly will do this again!!

This worked really well with chicken breasts too and was so easy.  I just cooked the meat for less time (also used skim instead of whole milk), and it was delicious.

Excellent recipe.  Pork was so tender and even though the milk curdles, the curdles are what makes it even better.  Just doesn't look as pretty as some recipes but way makes up for it in flavor.  I did add a bit of garlic powder when seasoning the pork but otherwise followed the recipe exactly and couldn't be happier.  Very tender and the brown milk gravy is tasty.  Served with mashed potatoes.

I made the recipe as written except that I reduced the salt.  It turned out tender, moist and delicious.  I used a programmable thermometer set to 145 degrees inserted into the meat.  The temperature rose to 155 degrees as it rested.

I was so disappointed with this.  The loin was dryer than when I roast it.  Taste was totally blah.  Tomorrow I'm taking the half that was uneaten, washing off the curdled milk, and braising it in tomatoes and wine.  Hopefully I can salvage some of it.

The pork loin ended up being juicy and delicious.  I did serve it with the leftover brown sauce, after skimming out the curdled milk (I couldn't get past the idea of it to eat it).  I used Thyme and Marjoram instead of Rosemary as a personal preference (don't like Rosemary) and I used 3 cloves of garlic.  It was perfect!  I'm only docking a star because the recipe doesn't address the curds that form with this - was I supposed to whisk them further? Remove them? Not entirely sure.

Loved this recipe.  Made it as posted and wouldn't change a thing.  Simple with great results just don't have your heat too high during the braising period and vent it as stated and you will have nice tender meat.

Absolutely delicious! I not only pleased my boyfriend, but my parents too! I make up my own spices, since my boyfriend likes a little heat, and on my third try really got the sauce right. The first time I did too salty, but still delicious, the second time I didn't season quite enough, and the third time? Perfection! Really a fantastic way to make moist, savory pork! Thank you so much for the recipe!

Yum Yum! Used reduced fat milk instead of whole because it's all I had. I was nervous about the sauce because the milk curdles looked weird, but they are delicious. I put in more rosemary because I have a gigantic rosemary bush in my backyard so I am quite liberal with it. Anyway, I don't have much cooking experience, so I'm really proud of myself. I will say that it seems like the bottom that was soaking in the milk longer was more moist. I did rotate the roast once, but maybe it needs to be rotated earlier to make more of it moist? Anyway, it was still good though.

This is the 1st time I have done a review for this site. 

It was delicious.  I added egg noodles to the gravy(after removing the pork loin) and let the mixture simmer 15 minutes.  I did need to add additional milk.  I let the milk gravy reduce again and then thicken it with corn starch/water.(I like my gravy thick)

I used very little salt.  I added a few drops of Tabasco Sauce to the gravy while it was simmering.

I will make this again.
