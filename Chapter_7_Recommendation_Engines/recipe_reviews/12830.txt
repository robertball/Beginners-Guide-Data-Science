I made this dish today.  It was good, but needs adjustment.  I used two cans of tuna, and with 8 oz of noodles, it requires more cheesesauce or at least a thinner one.  My casserole was dry.  Thin the cheese sauce with milk to make it creamier or use less noodles.  I will make it again.

I had to doctor up the sauce with seasonings to get some kind of flavor into it. Also, the amount of liquid stated would have left me with a very dry casserole, so I tripled the sauce and it was perfect. I topped the casserole with buttered Panko crumb and some parm cheese. This recipe has the makings of a good dish, but you really need to play around with it. Thank you Cat!

I never thought I would like Tuna Casserole made without Mushroom soup.  Boy was I wrong!  This was fantastic!  I doubled the sauce and added a few splashes of Frank's to it.  I used frozen peas and  a big can of tuna and I added a can of mushrooms.  So good with a sprinkle of french fried onions on top.  YUM!  thanks for the great recipe Cat!

this is an excellent base recipe.

i doubled the cheese sauce and also used half cheddar half provolone. i cooked some mushrooms, red peppers, onions, and garlic in olive oil and steamed a little broccoli and added all that in at the same time as the tuna and noodles. i also used two cans of tuna. i baked club crackers and parm cheese on top for about an hour. it was excellent and my boyfriend was excited to have leftovers to bring to work! thanks!

Yum! Yum! Yum! I doubled the sauce recipe, but still only used the one can of tuna and one bag of noodles. I used kraft sharp cheddar cheese in the block- no need to shred, just slice it thin. I used almost the whole 8oz block of cheese since I doubled the sauce.  I think the kraft sharp cheddar cheese tastes best -better tasting than the already shredded packs of cheese. I also used frozen peas. Served my family of 5 and still have leftovers for next day lunch. 

I will make this again. A keeper! Thank you!

Excellent recipe, I too am grateful to see a recipe for Tuna Noodle Casserole that is made without a can of soup.  Definitely tastes "like mom used to make it."  Thank you!

This was really good!  I was looking for a tuna noodle casserole recipe without the canned soup that has all that salt.  The white sauce was easy and good.  I added 1/4 teaspoon of garlic powder and onion powder and used soy milk.  I topped it with bread crumbs.  I didn't have any peas to add and this was still delicious!  I will make this again and next time I will add the peas.  Thanks!

I made this last night for my family and very picky brother!  It was devoured.  I liked this recipe because it is a great starter.  Add whatever tastes you like...cayenne pepper, salad supreme seasoning, cumin, green chilis, sweet bell peppers, water chestnuts, mushrooms, etc.  My kids ate it mild and my husband poured on the pepper and cayenne for more spice and flavor.  Even the picky brother had seconds!  I also added a heaping spoonful of sour cream just to make the texture more creamy and soul satisfying. Great Job!

Mmmmm...yummy. I used a cheddar/jack blend and it was very nice and creamy. I used large shells as well. My hubby loved it.

I have played around with this recipe for the past year or so and have finally found the best ratios.  I use triple the butter, flour and milk and use double the noodles and tuna.  This makes plenty of sauce and no need to cover while baking.  I use frozen, not canned, peas and never measure them, just pour in until it looks like enough.  I also add plenty of black pepper and top with crispy fried onions.  Perfection.

Pretty Good, but would have bland without changes.  

I added diced onions and a minced garlic clove and let them simmer in the butter for a while.  I also added paprika, and several dried peepers.

To make the recipe healthier, I doubled the tuna and only used about 1/4 cup of cheese (mixed chedder and mozz).  To keep it creamy I added a big scoop of plain greek yogurt.  Wheat noodles added some fiber, and since people were complaining of dryness I added some vegetable broth to the sauce.  

I also sprinkled crushed Saltines to the top to give a little crunch.  It turned out tasty and was easy to make.

Additions are fine, but the fact remains that this is a great basic recipe for tuna noodle casserole that doesn't include that horrible can of soup!

Good recipe, I added a package of ranch dressing mix (dry) after adding the milk while making the sauce, only because I had it on hand. It turned out GREAT! So play around with this recipe with what you have in the cubbard.  Have fun cooking everyone!

I doubled the cheese sauce (a must), adding garlic powder, crushed red chilies, pepper, dried minced onion, and a pinch of celery seed, and used a large pouch of tuna. I also added some lightly steamed broccoli. In place of the egg noodles, I used whole wheat bow-tie pasta.  I covered it in the oven for the first 10 minutes, than added Panko bread crumbs tossed with a little butter and left it uncovered for the rest. I used the broiler at the end to deepen the top crust.  The husband loved it, and I'm happy that there was plenty for leftovers later in this busy week. This recipe is a good base, and I'm looking forward to varying the spices and vegetables in the future.

Four stars! This recipe is a good starting point, something to tinker with different ingredients like veggies and seasonings. The sauce is very much like what you would use in a from-scratch mac and cheese, and worked well. I used some cooked elbow macaroni I had on hand instead of the egg noodles so mine was very much like a mac-n-cheese dish, but the egg noodles would be great. Honestly, I just eyeballed how much cooked noodles to use for how much sauce I made so I can't really comment on the noodle-to-sauce ratio in the recipe. I doubled the sauce as others suggested, but for the small can of tuna I use that was excessive. The sauce was bland, so I had to kick it up a notch with some spices. May fave was hot sauce. I aso used cooked frozen carrots and peas instead of the can. My kids were so hungry I didn't put mine in the oven, but it reheated great in the oven for lunch the next day so the step isn't totally useless. Overall, a keeper. Thanks Cat!

This was so good, I ate the whole thing in two days.  I made more of the Rue and milk then called for and used frozen mixed vegatables (peas, carrots, etc)  instead of the canned peas, and I put Panko bread crumbs on the top.  Delicious.

Very tasty, easy, and you can easily use any type of pasta or noodle on hand that you may be trying to finish off. The major change I would make would be to definitely ADD more TUNA. The more tuna, peas, and broccoli you could add would increase the health benefit for more fat/calorie content eaters. So fast, will make again on a night I need to put dinner on the table without much time.

I took someone else's suggestion and I doubled the sauce. This was really very good! I was surprised because the sound of tuna and cheese together didn't do much for me but this was really good!

I'm never using canned soup again for this hotdish.  Made quite a few adjustments for my tastes but this is a great starter recipe.  I'm so glad there's such an easy way to avoid the salty canned soup.

Delicious and easy - my two favorite things!! I did have to put about 1/2 cup more milk in to make it nice and creamy. Otherwise I think it may have come out a little dry. I sprinkled some extra cheese and some bread crumbs on top before baking to make a nice topping. Very nice - will definitely be a regular in my recipe box!

I made this with cubed chicken and also doubled the milk to two cups in the same amt. of flour/butter and used low fat cheese in it and it was delicious.    I did add a few drops of Louisana Hot Sauce to the cheese mixture just to have it have a little "kick" to it.    It was just delicious and will never use creamed mushroom soup again in this type of recipe.    THANKS for sharing this with us.    Loved it.

This turned out very good!  Much better than using a can of cream of "whatever" soup in it.

I am rating this as a 'base' recipe.I adjusted alot due to taste preferences..used cubed cooked chicken and steamed broccoli and sauteed mushrooms...followed sauce but doubled it except the cheese...also added ALOT of seasoning to the mixture..garlic and onion powder,turmeric and a touch of nutmeg..YUM!  Will definitely make this recipe with my adjustments. THANKS for a great base!!!

I am so glad I used this recipe for my first ever tuna noodle casserole. I did make a few small changes as I thought the dish might be a little bland for my taste. Firstly, I didn't measure the flour and milk to make the roux, I just did it by eye as I am used to doing. It created more sauce but that was a good thing in the end or the casserole may have been a little dry. I added a good pinch of dried thyme and a  teaspoon or so of garlic powder. The garlic powder added that extra dimension which made this a winner in my family. I also added a generous dollop of single cream and used frozen peas. This recipe is a cracking base for anyone to add their own spices/ingredients to taste. I want to make it again tomorrow!

This is great tuna casserole without using canned soup.  I doubled the sauce portion and made it a little saucier because we like it like that.  I also used frozen peas instead of canned -- they didn't mush.  Excellent recipe!

EXCELLENT!! After reading some rewiews that it was a dry dish, I made some changes.  
I added 1 more cup of milk in the sause (so it wasn't to tick) + salt, pepper + nutmeg.  Boiled the peas in salty water.  When everything was mixed I added 3/4 cup pasta water.  
I used thin spaguetti.  (I think this recipe would work with any pasta, whatever you have in your paintry).  My husband, my daughters 1 and 3 years old and I LOVE IT SO MUCH... So tasty, So good, So easy!!!!!  I am going to do this again very soon!

I needed a tuna casserole without canned soup, because I didn't have any and it's not readily available where I live (Spain). I had to make a few minor changes to the recipe to adapt to what I had: multi-colored bow tie pasta instead of egg noodles, a 5-cheese blend instead of just cheddar, and 1 cup of frozen peas, partially thawed, instead of canned. I left out the salt. Before I put the casserole in the oven, I sprinkled the top with Parmesan cheese and crushed Ritz crackers. It turned out great, very tasty, and even looked nice with the different colors in the pasta, the peas and the topping. Thanks for this one!

I don't know why people had doubts about this, because we loved it. My hubby didn't even want to try this just because it has tuna in it (he won't touch Tuna Helpers), but once he did, he couldn't stop eating it! Maybe it just turned out perfect for us this time?? It wasn't too hard or too runny. We will definately be trying this again. I added 1/2 cup extra cheese, medium egg noodles, one extra can of tuna. You could eat this without baking. Baking makes it crispy, more delicious.  I am never going to buy Tuna Helper again! BTW: I love Tuna!

This was quite good. I have tried 6 recipes on this site for tuna casserole and this one is by far the best one. I give it 4 and not 5 stars because it was a bit dry, so I added a can of fat free cream of mushroom soup to add moisture. I also added seasoned bread crumbs on top. Very good, quick and easy for busy stay at home moms like me.

I liked this.  I did use the wrong size dish and it came out a little crunchy.  The second time I made it, however, it was really good.  I think adding Pita chips or even potato chips would be a tasty addition.  Plus, I used 3 cans of tuna and it came out great.  It is really neat to make the sauce in the pan.  I had never done that before and it was really easy.

Not bad.  Plenty of cheesy sauce, but not enough tuna, I felt.  Overall, I thought it a little bland.

Great basic recipe!!  I am the only one in our household that will eat tuna casserole!  So I do not eat it very often.  I used leftover egg noodles from last nights dinner and leftover garlic and cheese croutons smashed on top.  Surely not my mother's tuna casserole!!  Quick and easy and very forgiving.  Add what you like and take out what you don't!!  YUMMY!!

This is a good start.  I doubled the sauce using triple cheddar blend instead of sharp cheddar,  used frozen peas instead of canned, added 1/4 cup sour cream to the sauce.  I also added an extra can of tuna and topped it with crushed potato chips.  I added my own seasonings since it needed some flavor.  It is good if you can't have a lot of salt and need to avoid canned soups.

We thought this was good but I had to leave out the salt due to dietary restrictions.  I used a few shakes of Mrs Dash instead.  I agree it needs more sauce but I just doubled the milk and it worked just fine. We don't care for canned peas so I used frozen.  Lastly I crushed some herbed croutons and sprinkled on top and it was dinner.  My 4 yr old gobbled it up!

I had mixed veggies instead of a can of peas, I also added 2 cans of tuna but found it was a little dry. I think a little more sauce and I would have given it 5 stars.

I made this with ham instead of tuna (I know, I know) - but it was still delicious.  The cheese sauce was easy making this a great lunch to throw together.  I'll be making it with tuna today.  :)

This recipe has a wonderful flavor!!! Better then one I previously used with Cream of chicken soup.  The only adjustments I made to this recipe were using 2 cans of tuna instead of one, and adding an extra 1/2 cup cheese in response to suggestions made by other reviewers. I added a little milk to compensate for the added ingredients. I also sprinkled dried bread crumbs on the top before baking. I added the crumbs 20 minutes before the casserole was finished baking so they wouldn't burn. The bread crumbs definitely completed the meal!! My only complaint is that the casserole seemed a little dry to me. My husband and his aunt thought it was just fine. I guess I like a soupier casserole. Other then that personal preference this recipe is a keeper and I love the fact that it doesn't use canned soup! Very simple and yummy! I would recommend to others but don't forget the bread crumbs!! Thanks for sharing.

Really enjoyed this recipe - my daughter is picky and she loved it too.  Very easy to make, the top layer does dry out a bit in the oven but it makes it a bit more crunchy so I didn't mind it.  You probably don't need a full package of noodles.  I bought a 12 oz package of noodles and used about half.  I will definitely make again.  Good for leftovers too.

I read the reviews before I made this recipe.  I doubled the cheesy sauce ingredients (as suggested) and I am glad I did.  I also added a tsp. or so of Emeril's essence and a tsp or so of dry ranch dressing powder.  It turned out REALLY good.  We all liked it and I would definitely make this again!!  I have to say I was worried it would taste bland, but it tasted really good.  Had more flavor than the normal cream of mushroom soup tuna casserole.

I thought this was a very good basic recipe. I teaked it a bit by pureing 1 small green pepper, 2 small onions and 5 cloves of garlic in a bit of olive oil. I then added the puree to the tuna and let it sit for about 15 minutes. I scaled down the sauce a bit since the puree added creaminess. Also, after I baked the casserole for 30 minutes, I took it out of the oven, sprinkled the cheese on top and put it back in the oven on the low broil setting until the cheeze became golden in color. (You have to watch this very carefully, it only takes about 5 or less minutes) Everyone in my family loved it, including my mother in law who at first was not very thrilled since she'd never had tuna casserole before. It came out very tasty and I'll definately make this again. Thanks Cat! OOPS,,, Forgot to say that I added an extra can of tuna and omitted the peas.

Recipe was easy.  I added some fresh mushrooms, made a little extra white sauce as one of the other reviews mentioned it was a little dry.  Used colby-jack cheese (as that was what I had on hand).  It is better with the white sauce than the can of creamed soup which is always too salty.  Good recipe Cat.  It's a keeper.

We love this casserole, with the following modifications: double the butter, flour, milk, cheese, and tuna. We use mini pasta screws which make it more springy and less potentially glued-together than the egg noodles.

Great base recipe...tweaked it in almost every way!  I'm not a huge fan of condensed soups and like to make as much as I can from scratch.  I used pepperjack and parmesan instead of cheddar.  I also used half and half in place of milk, doubled the recipe and used two, 12 oz cans of albacore tuna, sprinkled a couple dashes of red pepper and cut about 4 cups of fresh spinach up to add into the mix.  YUM!

Made it without baking for a quick lunch.  Put leftover croutons in the food processor and mixed it into the noodles.  It definitely could have used some seasoning, though.

I followed the advice of many of the reviews - I doubled the tuna & the sauce (and added about a half cup extra milk). The texture was fine, but it still probably could have done with more sauce. I used chopped fresh baby portobello mushrooms and a bag of frozen mixed veggies instead of canned peas. I also used a light celtic cheddar from trader joe's and added a little frank's hot sauce just to make sure it wouldn't be bland like so many tuna noodle recipes. The boyfriend and I both had seconds :)

I just made this - never made tuna casserole before, and was delighted by how simple it was. I had most of the ingredients in my cupboard, but substituted the egg noodles with pasta. I think it'll be a winner with the kids. and on our weekly dinner menu.

I made this last night as a last minute, no meat on Friday meal. It turned out really good. I ended up using a mix of cheddar and shredded mexican cheese (not the kind with taco seasoning). I also added some crushed up buttered Ritz crackers for a cruncy topping. Good base recipe that you can really do a lot with depending on what kind of flavor you are looking for.

Yum-Yum!  Tastes as delicious as mom used to make, but without the soup (a nice surprise).  I made a couple of adjustments, but nothing to change the basics.  I doubled the recipe to ensure leftovers, I used shells instead of wide noodles, added some chopped celery to the cheese mixture and I sprinkled Panko crumbs on top before popping in the oven, which gave it a nice crunch.  One other note...I used tuna packed in foil instead of canned, which is just as juicy and flavorful but no need to drain it .  Thanks for sharing, Cat.  This one is a keeper!

My family loves this but it needs a couple changes. I double the sauce and the tuna otherwise it gets a bit dry. I also use frozen or fresh veggies rather than canned. This is totally on our monthly meal list!

I am giving this three stars because it is a good base recipe, but when I make it next time I will be making some significant adjustments.  As written, this was more like a "pea casserole".  There were too many peas and not enough tuna.  Here are some things we are going to try to enhance this recipe: use 2 cans of tuna, use half the amount of peas, use a little more cheese and/or sauce, and make a breadcrumb topping to cover it with.

Good quick, no-frills, last-minute dinner idea.  I'm glad to have a tuna casserole that doesn't use condensed soup.  I used 2 5-oz cans of tuna and some frozen mixed veggies.  The kids loved it!

Have to be honest, did not enjoy this at all. Not only was it dry, it was pretty bland. I added extra spices, but left me without taste. Not every recipe is a winner. I am sure if you work with it, you can make this a great dish. But, BEWARE you have to make double or triple the sauce, otherwise it will be too dry.

This was sooo quick and easy. It took only 10 min. (max.) prep time. I did not have egg noodles, so I broke some lasagne noodles in pieces before cooking them in salt water like I would have the egg noodles. It turned out really good! I also did not have cheddar but used slices of american cheese. My teenage son had a huge portion and I couldn't stop eating it either. Great stand-by recipe when there isn't much time to get dinner ready.

Pretty good, needs some seasoning though. I add 1 teaspoon Mrs. Dash, 1/2 teaspoon Morton's Nature Seasoning, and I saute minced garlic in with the butter before adding the flour and salt.

This was easy to make and turned out great.  I love that this version doesn't use a can of condensed cream soup. I used half and half instead of milk to enrich the flavor.  I also used 2 cans of tuna since one didn't seem like enough.  And a little red pepper flakes gave it a nice kick. Other than that I followed the recipe exactly. Tastes like Mom used to make.

Yummy!  I'm the only one in the family who will eat tuna, so I made this with chicken breast instead.  I also increased the amount of cheese sauce I made in light of other posts, and added a few spices from Tastefully Simple, Onion Onion and Seasoned Salt, to give it more flavor.  I also added canned mushrooms.  I topped it with 1/2 cup melted butter, 1/2  parm cheese and 1/2 cup bread crumbs mixed together.  Very tasty and I'm super excited that I learned how to make a cheese sauce!!

This was really tasty, and I was so glad that it did not call for Cream of Mushroom soup.  I would recommend either skipping the "baking" step, or making EXTRA sauce.  It really gets sucked up into the noodles and mine came out a little dry.  I had to add some more milk before serving.  But I thought it was great, and I think chicken, or turkey, could be substituted nicely, too.

With a little love and modification I was able to make it lovely.  The only thing I changed was the order of the ingredients.  I melted the butter first, adding one tablespoon of flour after.  Next I added the milk and the rest of the flour.  This worked out splendidly.  I also added some corn along with the peas for a little extra ruffage and a can of mushroom soup.  With these changes I believe that this great recipe came out even better.

Definitely 5 starts with a couple of modifications. I doubled the tuna, added 1/2 cup sour cream to the sauce and used sharp cheddar. I also used broccoli instead of peas just because that's what I had on hand. The casserole was moist but not soupy and very flavorful. Great weeknight meal made with pantry staples.

I liked this recipe as a base for a "canned soup free" tuna casserole. I personally like more flavor, so I added 1/2 tsp paprika, 1/4 tsp of ground mustard, 1/4 tsp ground black pepper, a dash of cayenne, and 1 tsp of dried chopped onion. I put panko on top as well, and as another reviewer said, I thinned out the sauce a bit with some reserved pasta water. Thanks :)

I was searching for a tuna casserole recipe that didn't use cream soups and came across this one. I used 12oz noodled, tripled the sauce and doubled the cheese and tuna. I also added some pepper, celery seed, and oregano because the sauce was bland and threw in a bag of frozen carrots, celery, and onion. It was delicious! Leftovers were yummy too, and I liked that were was no crumb topping to get soggy. Will definitely be making again!

Pretty tasty, and very filling. I took the advice from other comments and doubled the cheese sauce. Also used lowfat buttermilk instead of milk, but less butter. Added cayenne, black pepper, and garlic powder, but omitted salt, which may have been a mistake. topped with crushed triscuits for a nice crunch. Would add frozen instead of canned peas next time, and maybe mushrooms too.

As is this is very bland; I like the idea of homemade sauce rather than canned soup.  This might be fine for younger children but people with a more  mature palate will want to add onions, celery, possible chili flakes or hot sauce, or other herbs to their liking.  I chop an onion, stalk of celery and nuke them with a bit of butter until slightly soft, then add to the rest of the ingredients.

This was fantastic! More importantly the husband loved it! I doubled the cheese sauce, which by the way was so easy, two 5 ounce cans of tuna, 12oz noodles, added some garlic power and dried chopped onions to the sauce and topped with bread crumbs and a tiny bit of Parmesan. Served with baby spinach salad. So delicious and easy! Thanks a million. Would definitely make again.

Great Recipe, I didn't need to make less noodles or more sauce it came out very saucy as is. I chose to mix in tomatoes and frozen peas and added a paramesan and bread crumb crust before baking. tasted great, great recipe for mix and matching what ever you have on hand. Thank you for the recipe!

loved chewy texture and homemade taste. i did 1.5 c milk, 1.5 c cheddar, but it still seemed dry so i added .5 c milk at end. a tad dry, but it was fine. did 1 c peas and 1 c chopped broccoli. bland, but good for toddler. could add parmesan for more flavor.

This recipe was pretty good, and very easy to make which is a total bonus when your busy with family and life. I added carrots to get my kids to eat a few more vegetables, and a clove of garlic that I stir fryed for about 5 minutes, and having added this to the mix the casserole could have used a touch more sauce. Also, I added a tiny bit of cheese to the top as well as some bread crumbs, and it was really pretty good. :)

OMG! I'm glad I read the reviews before I followed the recipe as directed. I added some garlic salt and lipton mushroom and onion soup to the sauce (which I doubled) and the casserole came out wonderful. This was my first time ever having tuna casserole as well as making it and it turned out pretty good. I would definately recommend this recipe to others.

This was very good and very simple to make.  So much more healthy than adding can soup.  You can also add any vegetable you want.  I added edamame and sliced fresh mushrooms.  I also used 2 cans of tuna and some of Emeril's essence for some spice.  Add whatever flavors you want.  Good stuff!

Great dish! I added just a bit (1/2 - 1tsp) dry ranch mix and skipped the baking. Turned out very delicous and the kids even raved about it. A definite do again! Thanks!

This got good reviews at the house. I added a can of mushrooms and less peas because a can seemed like too many. That could be because I don't like peas very much though. Overall it was not bad, a little dry but I would make it again.

Very good. Per others suggestions I doubled the cheese sauce recipe. I usually do not change recipes the first time around but this sauce did need a little something extra. I added Garlic and onion powder and 1 can cream of celery soup. Also added some steamed broccoli (we do not like peas) and during the last 5 minutes topped with fried onions. Excellent!

12 oz egg noodles, triple the cheese sauce, 2 cans tuna. In lieu of peas I used broccoli and onion. Garlic and paprika added with shredded cheddar. I did not bake and it was very delicious.

This recipe was only ok. It was pretty dry even though I added more of the sauce. I added my own seasonings which really helped and topped with breadcrumbs. It definitly needs more sauce to the recipe, LOTS more.

This is a very good recipe, to those who think this is bland: it's tuna noodle casserole!! you shouldn't expect too much different flavors because it is a classic casserole, if you think it is lacking something, my suggestion is a little more salt, as that seems to be the one thing people don't put enough of in.  The only think I did to alter this recipe is that I followed other reviewers suggestions with doubling the sauce recipe to compensate for the amount of noodles listed, I highly suggest this, because I am sure this would have been too dry had I not doubled it, I also added a small can of mushroom pieces, and I thought that added a nice flavor. Good recipe!

I love this recipe.  I made it as it was written and for tuna casserole it was great.  I really like that it doesn't have soup in it.  A very versatile recipe, you can add more cheese if you like or not.

Glad I read the reviews before making this, I doubled the sauce and probably could have tripled it! It would have been incredibly dry if I had not done that. Also just threw in some mixed frozen veggies and topped with some panko bread crumbs. With those changes it was very good.

Used 1% milk for 1/2 c. Used Whip. Cream (or half&half) for 1/2 c.  Doubled the tuna using 1 can packed in water and 1 can packed in oil.  Seasonings:  1/2 T. smoked paprika & 1/4 t. ground red pepper.  Used frozen mixed veggies & 1/2 can quartered artichokes.  Instead, could sub 3/4 c. chpd celery & 1/4 c. chpd green onion with 3/4 c. frozen peas.  Topped with panko bread crumbs drizzled with melted unsalted butter. Broil until topping slightly brown.  Delish!

Very good base recipe.  I doubled the cheese mixture and the tuna per other reviewers. I also added about 1/2 tsp of garlic power and 1/2 tsp of onion salt and two pinches of paprika to the sauce. I also added some broccoli to the peas. Next time I make this I'd like to try adding red peppers and/or zucchini.

This is a good recipe.  I used two cups of noodles with the amount of sauce described, plus two cans of tuna and a bunch of pepper since the sauce by itself was a little bland.  I also used broccoli instead of peas and topped it with fried onions.  I will make this again.

Great recipe, easy to follow.  Spruced it up a little, added some spicy seasoning, 3/4 cup of celery, a chopped green onion and I used frozen peas instead of canned.  I also doubled up on the tuna and the sauce.

This was a good recipe. My daughter hates tuna, but the flavors blended together. She was very surprised after she asked me "What is this made of Mom?"

Yum! Who knew that homemade tuna noodle casserole could be so easy. Up until now I have always used cream soup or Lipton noodle mixes, but never again! I added some  bread crumbs to the top of mine, but I think next time I might top with potato chip or Stove Top. Thanks for a GREAT recipe!

I was looking for a recipe of tuna casserole without the use of a canned soup when I found it was time to make dinner and I hadn't defrosted meat of any kind. I had to also use ingredients I already had in the pantry. I took the advice of a few of the other reviewers and doubled the sauce recipe. I also used the panko and parmesan to top it, spraying it with a canola cooking spray so it would brown. I also added pepper. My husband really liked it and my kids ate it as well. For being totally unprepared, I was pleased with the outcome.

This a great basic recipe which you can tweak a little to suit your own taste.  Definitely double the ingredients for the sauce, though I still kept the cheese to 1 cup. To add a little more flavor, I decreased the salt to 1/2 tsp. and added 1/2 tsp. of celery salt, along with some garlic powder.  And bread crumbs on top before baking makes it even more tasty.  This passed the test of even my most pickiest eater!

Great Base Recipe, like many others I added to it and it turned out fantastic. I added 1 tsp onion powder, 1 tsp garlic powder, 2 tsps salt, 1/2 tsp paprika, 1/2 tsp pepper and 1/2 tsp red pepper flakes. I used 12 oz evaporated milk and 8 oz chicken broth for the liquid (we ran out of milk). I also added 5 ounces of provolone and one cup of shredded mozzarella to the cream base. I substituted broccoli for the peas and layed squares of mozzarella on top instead of using bread crumbs and cheddar. All in all, this is a great base recipe that easily adapts to what's in the house!

This turned out really great, I was out of milk so used whipped cream.  It was a little heavy so want to try it with the milk.  Otherwise it still turned out great.  Not fishy tasting and everyone loved it.  Thanks for the post.

here's the thing...i always make recipes exactly as the recipe reads, therefore, if you make this recipe as is, it's just fair.  not much flavor and more work than necessary.  follow others suggestions i.e. 1 more can tuna or maybe some seasoning salt.  don't make this recipe as is or you will just have a fair casserole in front of you.

This is THE BEST!! I've been making this for about a year now. It is our favorite and now the favorite of our friends! I double the sauce, use a whole bag of No Yolks dumplings and a 12-oz can of albacore tuna. My secret is during the last 10 mins of baking, I sprinkle a small can of french fried onions on top. Delicious!

Fabulous. I'm so grateful to have found a recipe that doesn't call for canned soup!  I doubled the recipe and added crushed ritz crackers on top.  Other reviewers mentioned it came out too dry.    Not so for me.  I wonder if they covered their casserole dish with a lid while baking?  I did, and it came out PERFECT.

This is just like the delicious tuna casserole my mom used to make.  I love the fact that you don't have to use any soup in it.  I followed the recipe to a tee except for I topped it with a layer of crushed ritz crackers.  I did this for 2 reasons.  I read other reviews where it said it came out too dry, so I figured this would help the noodles stay nice and moist (it did),and it just sounded to me like it needed a crunchy top.  The result was yummmmmy! The family loved it and ate every bite! This one is a keeper.

I was nervous to try this recipe as I'm not a big tuna fan but the previous reviews really helped out! I used 4 oz noodles & 2 cans of tuna. Believe me-any more noodles would be too much! I also added 1/4 tsp onion & garlic powder but next time will double that-it wasn't enough flavor! Sprinkled some french fried onions on top. The cheese sauce was great (I used fat free cheese)-it'll be greater next time with more seasoning. And I only used 1/2 cup frozen peas. AND the leftovers are DIVINE the next day-it reheats very well! Thanks SO much to the previous reviewers for their help!

This was great and so easy to make.
I sauteed some onions and mushrooms, even though it would have been good without.  I doubled the tuna.  My boyfriend loved it.  Will definitely make again.

this was so good.  I used spaghetti noodles instead of the egg noodles.  I tripled the sauce mix and instead of regular milk, I used the canned evaporated milk.  I didn't have any bread crumbs, so instead I used Special K cereal crushed, and added that on top of the dish.  I put sliced cheese (sandwich cheese) on top of that.  Even my three year old, who won't eat ANYTHING ate this and said that it was good.  This reminds me of the Tuna Helper "Tuna Tettrazini"  5 stars from me and I will be making it again.  thanks CAT!!

I made this recipe with shells. It was all I had on hand. I doubled the sauce recipe and used a processed cheddar from wis pride. It was the only cheese I had left. I used one cup of milk and one cup of half and half plus two cans of tuna. My husband who hates Tuna noodle casserole loved it!

I will never use a recipe that calls for canned soup in my tuna casserole again.  This recipe is perfect.  I used frozen peas because I don't like my peas mushy. For the kids I leave the recipe as is and they love it.  For my husband and I get more creative and add our favorite vegetables.

I did make some changes to this recipe which would give it about 4stars but I'm not sure how it would have been without the changes. First I melted the butter, then sauteed about 1/2 an onion and 3 cloves of garlic for about 5 min. Then I added some sliced fresh baby portobella mushrooms and continued to saute for another 2 min. I then sprinkled the flour over all and slowly added the milk stirring constantly (I did need more than 1 cup milk to get this at the right consistency). Finally I added the cheese, a little less than 1 cup shredded cheddar (that's all I had left). Now at this point the "sauce" tasted very very good...alot like a homemade cream of mushroom soup! Now with the noodles...all I had was a 16 oz. bag so I cooked about half the bag and added them to the sauce little at a time. I didn't used all the noodles I had prepared but had just very little left over. At this point this wasn't too dry. After spreading this into the casserole dish I sprinkled the top with seasoned breadcrumbs and popped it in the oven for about 20 min. or so. Turns out, it was a little too dry...not too bad, but could have definitely used less noodles. This recipe could also possibly use another can of tuna but I guess that depends on personal preference. I used solid white albocore. Overall, prepared this way, with just less noodles, this was a very good, quick and easy meal.

Delicious!!! Made as is.  The 2nd time I made it: added 2 tsp minced garlic and 1 tsp cayenne pepper as suggested by another reviewer; the garlic I like (maybe more); but the cayenne pepper made it a little too spicy for my taste.

A great basic tuna noodle casserole recipe.  We did make a few changes to jazz it up to our tastes.  

Added 1 tsp Herbs de Provence (french herb mix), 1 tsp lemon pepper and the juice of 1/2 lemon.  The lemon works well with tuna and "sharpens" the flavor slightly.  Topped with crushed potato chips and sprinkled with Parmesan cheese.

Will use this recipe again!  Possibly adding onions and fresh mushrooms?

OK ... so this is a great start, but I think I found the sweet spot for the finish: 

- Double the ingredients for the sauce, so the casserole isn't too dry. 
- Add a little bit of water, like maybe 3/4 cup. 
- Add a can of cream of celery soup. Makes a WORLD of difference. 
- 2 tsp. minced garlic
- maybe a tsp of cayenne pepper. or a can of diced green chiles. 

I followed the instructions otherwise, beside doubling everything for the sauce. Used frozen peas - stuck to the prescribed amount. Doubled the tuna., and it turned out awesome. Thanks for recipe!

Definitely a winner esp after moms' day at work with a waiting toddler and hungry husband! It was super quick and easy too- did not bake.  I used 2 cans of tuna, mustard, some frozen peas and about a cup of extra milk as I used 3T flour instead of the recommended 2T for approx. half pack of fettuccine pasta. Will be having this again- thanks for sharing :)

i added a can of cream of mushroom soup... awesome addition!  i saw a recommendation of sprinkling bread crumbs and Parmesan cheese on top... i think that would be a nice touch at the end, uncovered.  BTW, i baked covered and had no issue with it being dry.

I am just stunned how this recipe turned out without using mushroom soup! I was nervous about it and of course read other reviews and made sure the cheesesauce was to my liking, but I am glad I gave it a shot. Okey well I didnt have cheddar, only colby. So since I love it this way, I'm keeping it this way lol.

Was looking for some comfort food on this cold November day- this recipe really hit the spot! I used about 2 cups of frozen peas instead of canned but stuck with the rest of the measurements. I did top my casserole with a little bit more cheese as well as some fried onion strings before sticking in the oven. Thanks for the great recipe!

Great base recipe. I decided on dinner last minute, and didn't have the canned soups I have always used-- this is much better! I had to triple the sauce recipe, but it turned out great! I added frozen veggies, a little garlic and minced onion and italian seasonings. I recommend with a little broccoli and birds eye steam fresh mixed veggies.

The first time i made this recipe, i did make more sauce, but it did not have a good taste. The next time i made it i used 1/2 teaspoon paprika, 1/4 teaspoon ground mustard, 1/4 teaspoon ground pepper.Doubled the tuna and still doubled the sauce. Used velveeta cheese, not sharp cheddar. As written a two star, as i make it a five star.Sometimes i use ( cream of chicken soup from scratch ) from this web site, very good soup.I use it instead of the sauce that comes with the recipe

Added some pepper and red pepper flakes for a little zest but otherwise a really good recipe.

Delicious.  A bit thick though, but adding some more milk to it sorts it out.

I only gave it four stars cause I made alterations. I wanted to add more flavor, so I followed a previous review and used onion soup mix the first time I made it. The second time however, I couldn't find the mix, so I used french onion soup instead of the milk. I added a bit of thyme and red wine, doubled the sauce mixture and the tuna. I also used more cheese because my DH and I both are cheese lovers:) it comes out delicious every time!!

I've made this twice now -- first time because I realized I had no cans of soup so I did an i-search for a "tuna casserole no soup" recipe -- I was very pleasantly surprised at the creamy outcome!  
I gave it 4 stars because twice now I've deviated: 2nd time I made it I had to put in less peas -- I'm not one to need a pea in every bite.  Also, I add shredded cheddar and mozzarella along with breadcrumbs (seasoned with pepper and onion powder) to the top before I bake, to give it a nice, crispy crust.  

I also tried this second time with homemade noodles (feeling frisky, I guess) -- YUMMMM!!!

Overall, though, very good and easy recipe.

I liked this recipe because it did not require cans of soup.  It is a good starter that enabled me to be creative.  Instead of plain milk, I first mixed it with a vegetable dip mix (like Simply Organic's Creamy Dill, Ranch or French Onion) before adding to the sauce pan.  I omitted salt since the dip and cheese had plenty of sodium.  I also doubled this sauce mixture to prevent the drying out of the tuna casserole when it is baking in the oven.  In addition, I  doubled the tuna and also added chopped onion and celery.  It was fabulous!

This is a super easy recipe and I, by no means, am even an average cook.  It was tasty, flavorful and came out on my very first try.  I did substitute peas for broccoli though because my husband is allergic to peas.  I will definitely cook this again.

This has become my "go to" recipe for tuna casserole. I love it! Don't tell my mom but I like it better than hers. The only modification I make is to double the sauce, because I like a really saucy casserole. It's delicious as is but can easily be dressed up by adding some sauted mushrooms and onions, or any other vegetables of your liking. I also like to top it with cracker crumbs and parmesan cheese.

Nothing special.  Will look for another recipe.  Some changes if you are to make it: double the cheese sauce, 12 oz. package of noodles, two cans of tuna, half a can of peas, and a good dollop of sour cream mixed in the cheese sauce.

This was quick and easy to make. But turned out kinda dry and bland. Next time I will triple the cheese sauce and add more seasonings for flavor. Definitely something I can play around with!

Yum!  I also doubled the cheese mixture, added a few dashes of Worcestershire Sause, a couple big squeezes of mustard and chopped up a bunch of dill pickle slices which gave the sauce a great little zip.  Will make again - super easy.

This was a five star recipe for my family with a few changes other reviewers suggested. I added slightly more milk, some worcestershire sauce, and mustard. Also, added two cans of tuna with some of the water left in it and frozen peas. I only cooked on the stove and added some French's Fried Onions as topping. Very Good!

First time ever making tuna casserole without cream of mushroom soup  Made my cheese sauce up lickety split in the microwave while the noodles were cooking  Only changes I made were that I  used 2 cans of well drained chunk light tuna & I just have to have my crushed potato chip topping so added that!  I agree that this tends to go dry so next time I'm thinking that I 'll drain just one can of tuna and add all of the liquid and meat from the other  In closing, I DID NOT MISS THE MUSHROOM SOUP &  probably wont use it ever again!  Thanks for my new tuna casserole recipe

Three words...Quick, Easy, Delicious! I am always looking for ideas of what to make for lunch and dinner that my 13 month old will enjoy as well as me and my Husband. I made this for lunch, and he devoured it, he seemed to enjoy it better than Mac n Cheese... hallelujah! .... The only thing I did differently was used shell noodles so that it would be easier for my 1 year old to eat, and also instead of just peas I had a can of peas & carrots that I used. I will make this recipe again, and again! Thanks for sharing it with us :)

I am not a fan a tuna casserole, but I did enjoy this recipe. I followed the instructions of some other reviewers and doubled the sauce - butter, flour, salt, milk, and cheese. I also didn't have any cheddar cheese, so I used some mozzarella mixed with parmesan. The sauce was really creamy and mild, and it might be a better option for those who don't like strong cheese. When I try this recipe again, which I will, I will probably use the cheddar cheese; I like the stronger flavor.

I just made this, and it turned out perfect. I am not sure why some are turning out so dry. I did add some french onion season mix and worcestershire sauce. I am going to serve it with a big loaf of french boule bread. Yummy! Thanks for the quick and easy recipe. Cheers!!

I made this on a day when my kitchen was bare. I didn't even have cheddar cheese so I used Monterrey Jack instead. I gotta say, 4 being a last minute dinner it was pretty yummy. My entire family loved it.

This  is a very good recipe.  I followed some of the other reviews, and doubled the cheese sauce and the tuna.  I used almost a whole package of Liption mushroom and onion soup mix in the cheese sauce.  It gave it a great flavor.  I also added a can of corn.  This did not last long in my home.  My picky two yr old even asked for seconds.

Needed more spices, didn't really have much flavor.  I also doubled the amount of tuna, but it still didn't seem like enough for my bunch.  Also a little dry, so next time will double the amount of sauce mixture.  We enjoyed it very much though.

I just recently saw a recipe for a tuna noodle casserole that included all the Worcestershire sauce you like mixed into the tuna.  I noticed there were no remarks about needing to flavor that one up, so I just thought I'd mention it.  I'll try that, I love Worcestershire!

I thought this recipe was great. I changed it up a bit though. I doubled the cheese sauce like others had suggested and also added onion and garlic, sauteed first and steamed broccoli instead of peas. Then I topped with crushed butter crackers. I also doubled the tuna. My husband loved it and that was my goal. He hated tuna casserole until I made this.

This was great.  I will admit I did substitute bow tie pasta for the noodles because I didn't have egg noodles on hand and I don't like canned peas so I used frozen and I added an extra can of tuna, however, even the base recipe woudl turn out wonderful as well.  Thanks!

Very good, a little bland, so I added caujan spice. I didn't have croutons, so I used 3 slices of toast, which was a tasty alternative.

Great! I did have to use a little more sauce than the recipe states but still a good recipe. Also we used shredded chicken instead of tuna (not big tuna fans in my house!) but even my 5 year old asked for seconds!

It is a good recipe but it gets too dry so you should at least double or triple the sauce to make it creamier.

as written, not the greatest. following the lead of other reviewers i doubled the sauce and doctored it up with garlic powder, paprika, chili powder, and red pepper flakes. I also omitted the salt. as to veggies, I added some grape tomatoes I had leftover as well as some canned green beans. I doubled the amount of tuna. Topped it all off with breadcrumbs. AMAZING.

I thought this was great.  I modified it a little tho.  I doubled the cheese sauce and used Velveeta Cheese, instead of the cheddar.  I also added a bit of Lawrey's Season Salt.  I used 1 can of peas, 1/2 can of carrots, and 2 cans of tuna.  Before baking I crushed some Ritz crackers and sprinkled them on top.  YUMMY !!!  Thanks for the starter recipe Cat !

Although I love fish, I usually find the taste of tuna overwhelming.  My boyfriend on the other hand, hates fish, but loves tuna.  I tried this recipe because it didn't use cream of mushroom soup and it had peas (his two requests).  For me, this was just okay (what I would expect out of a tuna casserole), but he absolutely loved it and that's a big accomplishment.

Great basic recipe.  I like my tuna casserole firm, so the amount of sauce was just right.  I add some garlic and paprika to the sauce, add green onion for color (since my beloved doesn't like peas) and use crushed cracker crumbs on top.

This is a great recipe!  You know you've got a winner when your family asks for seconds - of tuna noodle casserole no less!  The only thing I did differently was saute a little onion in the butter before adding the flour.  Delicious - highly recommended!

Not bad for tuna noodle casserole. Made it for lunch today and it was a hit with my three year old. I will make it again it is easy on the pocket book and schedule. I used whole wheat noodles and added more milk per others suggestions. I am not a pea fan I did use peas this time but will not again that's not the recipes fault though. Thanks for sharing!

My cabinets are almost bare and I didn't want to go to the store.  So, I found this recipe and decided I could make it work with what I had.  I added some seasoning salt in place of the regular salt.  Used some extra milk in order to thin out the cheese sauce.  I also used whole wheat elbow macaroni.  I steamed some fresh broccoli florets and used that in place of the peas.  And I used a 12 oz can of tuna.  This is a decent meal when your short on time.  In the end, it is still just a tuna casserole.  Good but not spectacular.

I didn't think the casserole was cheesy enough.  I didn't add any cheese on top, just bread crumbs.  I also added onion and garlic powder for flavour and that helped.  I thought it was just okay as is, but you can play with this recipe to make it how you like. It's nice however to see a recipe w/o mushroom soup, so I'm giving this a 4.

I give it 4 stars only because I had to make some changes.  But, I am throwing away my old cream soup tuna noodle casserole recipe.  This was awesome!  I used 3 tbsp. each of flour and butter, and added seasoned salt and onion powder.  I also increased the milk to 1 1/2 cups and added several healthy splashes of cooking sherry.  I also used 2 cans of tuna and about 10-12 ounces (almost a whole bag) of egg noodles.  I used half an 8 oz. package of sharp shredded cheddar in the sauce and then threw the rest on top before baking.  (Probably could have used less on top).  I baked covered for 20 minutes and then added crushed potato chips and baked another 10 minutes uncovered.  Kind of tasted like a cross between mac 'n cheese and tuna casserole.  Without any cream soup taste.  Excellent, thank you, will make again!!

I'd forgotten how good homemade tuna noodle casserole can be! I use 2 cans of tuna (or 1 12oz. can) and skip the flour (you don't need it). My husband loves this, too. Good old-fashioned comfort food.

This recipe was ok. I added extra milk like others did and added 1/2 can of cheddar cheese soup, plus the regular cheese and also added 1/2 a bag of broccoli. I think it would of been better if I had fried onions on top.Seems like it needed a crunch. I didnt have any fried onions so I added crushed crackers, which was ok. May make it again and try the onions.

My daughter is a vegetarian so it's always hard preparing meals that she can eat.  This one went over well and was very quick and easy.  We used peas and bread crumbs on top.  Really good recipe.  Thank you :)

I have made this recipe a few times.  Both hubby and I love it.  I doubled the sauce mixture, added about 1/4 cup of parmesan cheese instead of cheddar (I didn't have any cheddar cheese on hand) and I added some freshly ground black pepper to the sauce.  I also melted 2 tbsp. of butter and 3 tbsp. of bread crumbs and sprinkled the mixture on top.  I don't make this dish that often...I don't know why, it's so YUMMY!

Not bad. Not great. The french fried onions on the top saved it. I did make some mods, though, that might have impacted the results in the opposite direction. Based on "dry" reviews, I did 1.5x each ingredient in the sauce, except the cheese. Thought that the "bland" reviews could be remedied by a bit of blue cheese for bite in addition to the sharp cheddar. Used two cans of tuna just to make it a little hardier. Looking forward to leftovers tomorrow, though. Ate this one right from the oven, so it may not have had time to really settle into all the flavors. I think the onion/garlic/celery advice in other reviews would have been worth heeding. Husband liked it regardless.

Excellent, I have been looking for a recipe like I had when I was a kid. I put a bread crumb crust on top but think french fried onions would have been better, I will try that next. Also I used a 12 oz can of tuna, a full bag of noodles, and doubleed the sause, TRY IT!

I'm sorry- but I really didn't like this. I put spices in, but still thought it was bland. It seemed to get dry quit often, so I had to keep adding more liquid to it. 
Won't make again.

Wow!  This is delicious, and so simple.  I skipped the baking stage and it was still great.  I used elbow noodles, and cut the salt in half, and also added a touch more cheese.  Will definitely make again and again.

Definitely don't need to bake this, unless you're adding a crunchy topping. The recipe was OK -- nothing special really. But its an easy, quick recipe to make if that's what you're looking for. Also, I used macaroni pasta, which I thought was really good.

I was pleased to find this recipe as my usual recipe for tuna noodle casserole uses mushroom soup and I'd run out.  I substituted canned salmon and added some dried dill and marjoram for flavour.  I also increased the ingredients by 1 1/2 to feed 6 hungry people.  It is a good basic recipe and I'm sure I'll use it again.

Not bad--your basic tuna casserole.  It was a little boring.  Maybe more cheese would help.

A very simple, belly warming meal.....I doubled the recipe and added a couple dallops of sour cream and topped it with bread crumbs. I am not a tuna fan but it was good without being overwhelmingly fishy.....will be a regular monthly meal for us!!!!

This is the second time I have prepared this casserole.  Used a cup of shredded four cheese and added a small can of sliced mushrooms.  Wonderful flavor without all the sodium of the canned mushroom soup. Husband and I both loved it. Thanks Cat, this is a keeper.

Following the advice of others- I doubled the sauce. (Thankfully!) I used 1c frozen peas, 1 c frozen corn, 2 cans tuna. I Also did half milf and the other half was half & half. lol I tasted the sauce before adding it to the other ingredients and found it to be bland, so I added a few good shakes of oNion powder, some pepper, and a little Italian seasoning.  After putting it into casserole dish, I topped it with about 1/3c Italian fine breadcrumbs, it was pretty good! I chose this recipe bc my hubby hates mushroom soup which many recipes call for.

I made this and it was great, I'm not usually a tuna girl but my fiancee and I loved this. Definitely used two cans of tuna, double the sauce to keep it from getting too dry, only had frozen veggies so used those and added some garlic & parsley as well as a ritz cracker crumble on top!

Listened to the reviews and doubled the white sauce recipe which made for a perfect amount. I also used 2 cans of tuna and used old cheddar instead of sharp cheddar. I also added grilled onions and mushrooms to the mix and topped off the casserole with bread crumbs. Very, very tasty!!

Love the idea of  making your own sauce for Tuna Noodle and I did as others suggested by doubling the white cheese sauce. BUT used half chicken broth and  half milk to make it from being to dry.  Gave more flavor too !! Thanks

This was good, family liked it.  (I didn't get to try it this time, though).  Doubled the sauce, added black pepper and garlic powder to it.  Also added some broccoli flowerets and sautéed mushrooms, and 2 cans tuna.

I was looking for a recipe that didn't call for sour cream.  This was quick and delicious.  I added a small jar of pimentos which added a little kick.  This basic recipe can be tweaked any which way, but in a pinch without a lot of ingredients, this was awesome and my husband loved it.

I made this dairy free. I subbed unsweetened cashew milk, vegan butter, & used a few slices of Daisy cheese (probably 5-6 slices). I used unbleached white whole wheat flour. I roasted a head of broccoli, half red onion, & 5 cloves of garlic,  w olive oil, garlic powder, s&p. I also used a couple lil dashes offer pepper flakes. After roasting I put all of it in the mix too. I used a bag of frozen organic peas. & a mix of Noddles I had on hand. I used a big can of albacore tuna. Did it all in the same cast iron skillet. Doing it this way does take much longer to prep. But it makes a lot. It was delish! The whole familiar loved it! This was my first attempt to do this dairy free & it was just as good as the original. I will defiantly make it often.

This is a good script to throw things together and get a good casserole. I did not have many of the ingredients so I subbed penne for noodles, Monterey jack for cheddar, frozen peas for canned & seasoned bread crumbs for chips. Based on others' reviews, I increased butter & flour to 3T each and used 1-1/2 c of milk. I added 1 t. oregano and a hefty sprinkle of garlic powder. I also sauteed 1 chopped celery rib, 1/4 c. red onion and 2 chopped mushroom and added those. So I basically transformed the recipe but it was very good and would be tasty with cooked chicken instead if tuna and any cooked veggies mixed in.

This was easy and had a good flavor once baked. The only thing I changed was it was a little dry  once it was all mixed together so I stirred in about 1/2 cup of milk before I put it in my casserole dish. Would bake it again. Also sprinkled the top with buttered bread crumbs.

Just put this together for dinner tonight. I could tell from the way it tasted while preparing it that it is going to be delicious.  Followed the recipe as written except doubled the egg noodles !! and tripled the sauce & used frozen mixed veggies instead of just peas.  Thanks for a great recipe.  We both have to watch our sodium intake, so finding a recipe from scratch like this was wonderful !!! Thanks again

This was delicious! My son hates tuna fish, he loved this recipe! I used half and half instead of milk and before baking it I crushed up Ritz crackers and crumbled them on top then I added Locatelli cheese. It's was a hit!

I used twice the tuna, Parmesan instead of cheddar, and frozen peas instead of canned. Next time I'll also add sauteed onion to give it a little more flavor. Perfect comfort food, easily tweaked to your preferences.

Great Tuna Casserole Recipe. Double sauce, double tuna, use slightly sauteed mushrooms instead of peas, add dash of cayenne pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, celery seed.  My 12 year old loved it!

This is a great substitute recipe if you do not have soup on hand. I made double the sauce (based on other reviews) and used 2 cans of tuna. I also suggest adding French fried onions into the casserole and also ripping it with them for the last 5 minutes. My picky 11 year old son ate 3 bowls of this. Easy and delicious.

I am not big on the mushroom flavor in tuna casseroles so I loved this recipe though I only gave it 4 stars because it needs more taste. My family added more salt.

Boy, I sure wish I'd had the time to read all of the reviews before I decided to make this recipe -- if I had, then I would have known to double the sauce.  The casserole was dry as a desert!  Good thing I was the only one eating it last night (everyone had other plans), or my family would have very dissapointed.  I've always heard that there were tuna casseroles you could make without the mushroom soup, but if this is any indication of how they all taste, then I will stick to my "Gourmet Tuna Casserole!"

Yet another awesome recipe that I have found on this website.  It was prepared according to the directions but I did add some pimiento's for color and onions because we eat onions on everything.  I also threw in some thyme.  I doubled the recipe and did not feel that it was dry at all.  It was a really great dish that will be prepared again.  Thanks for sharing such a great dish!

This was very yummy, I just tripled the sauce because my family likes everything extra creamy.  My family loved this!  I was thrilled when my daughter's eyes brightened and she told me she liked it.  She is very particular in her food choices, so this recipe is definately an addition to our family favorites.

This is a great quick dish that can serve as a base for a lot of customization. The proportions are definitely light. The sauce needs to be at least doubled. However, the possibilities are endless. Different types of cheeses and seasoning can be tried and the amount of milk can be varied to control the thickness of the sauce. Different vegetables can be added. This is a great dish that is very open to possibilities, and still stays cheap and easy.

Wile this recipe is fantastic,the flavor is right on the target, I think the cheese sauce part of it needs to be tripled. I've made it once doubled already but it still came out a little dry. An extra can of tuna and more milk may also fill out the sauce a bit, to give it a more creamy texture.

Versatile, easy, and delicious recipe! I did the recomended doubling of cheese sauce, which had great results. Also, I used frozen green beans, pepper mix, and a leftover cob of corn from the previous night's dinner for my veggies. A few extra spices were thrown in for a boost as well. The tuna could have been doubled, but with my tuna-hating sister in mind I kept to the recipe in that aspect- and she loved it! This recipe was excellent because it can be made from a variety of fresh or frozen products, and comes out great!

I combined a few different ideas I had gotten from other recipes, and combined them with this one which made the best tuna cassarole I've ever had!(And I hate tuna cassarole!)First of all,I doubled the sauce,and added some sour cream to it,and seasoned with salt and lots of pepper(I like pepper)and about doubled the amount of peas(frozen!) I also added another can of tuna. Last but not least, I topped it with some crushed french fried onions and baked:) SO good!

I gave this two stars because it didn't taste bad but it didn't taste like much. I think sautéing and onion in the butter would have helped.

I made this as a treat for  my mother in law and I (we're the only ones who like tuna casserole) and it turned out great! I'm still learning how to cook and it was my first try at a Tuna Casserole...since I needed something fast...did the no bake option. Shall be making this over and over again....using the bake and the no-bake options!!

This was excellent!  Be sure to cook your roux to a nice brown for more flavor.  I did double the sauce and I used broc instead of peas, but great, and no condensed soup!

This is easy to make and yummy. I followed the suggestions of some other reviewers and doubled the sauce. I also added a few shakes of bread crumbs before baking and used 2 cans of albacore tuna. I did not have a 2qt casserole dish so I put it in a 9 x 13 baking dish. It turned out great!

This casserole was really good and quick to make for a Sunday dinner the only extra thing i did was top it with 3T of Panko bread crumbs with 1T of melted butter then put it in the oven until heated through along with the cheese will diffently make it again.

This recipe is much better if you eliminate the butter and flour and just add a can of cream of mushroom or cream of chicken soup to the milk.

When I don't know what to fix for dinner and like to cook from scratch, I go to allrecipes.com. Finding this recipe, I combined 1/4 package of egg noodles with 3/4 package of elbow noodles. Having no sharp Cheddar cheese in the house, I used mild Cheddar and added 1/4 cup Mozella cheese. Doubled the tuna using 12 oz vs 6, and added green beans instead of peas. I added 1/4 cup of soup/water mixture to compensate for extra noodles and tuna I used. Just before baking, I sprinkled whole Kellogg's Special K cereal on top. My family enjoyed this meal, which I served with lightly fried whole wheat bread buttered on both. Our casserole was wholesome, tasty, and moist. Some of the leftovers will more than likely find its way to my slow cooker for another tasty meal. Thanks, Cat, for sharing your recipe with us - it worked well for a spur-of-the-moment meal.

This was a fantastic recipe. I tweaked it a little by using three cups of milk instead of one and added red pepper flakes, paprika, salt, and pepper to give it a little kick. Then topped it off with some fresh parmeson cheese. It came out spicy and creamy. Fantastic

First let me say that I'm not big on tuna casserole but this was a enjoyed by my family and it gets an extra star since I had most of the ingredients on hand. I substituted rotini pasta for the egg noddles due to allergies but kept everything else the same. Thanks for a recipe that didn't have me running to the store for a can of condensed soup! Very good and I will definitely make this again.

Great basic recipe.  I also doubled up on the cheese sauce and added some feta and a three cheese mixture.  Oh! I also added some clams and used frozen peas.  A little garlic and ceyenne pepper and it was a huge hit.  Thank you for a wonderful recipe.

This recipe is a keeper, due to the made-from-scratch sauce.  Rather than canned tuna, I used some leftover tuna steak from a previous dinner.  I also added (chopped & sauted) celery, red/yellow pepper, and sweet onion to the mix, and sprinkled the tuna with cumin.  Another option: cilantro.  Husband took seconds - always a mark of a good dinner item.  thanks for the post, Cat!

I love tuna casserole but my boyfriend doesnt like tuna so in the baking dish i split it up with crackers and on his half i subbed bratworst, onions and green peppers. This was an easy recipe and I did double on the sauce mix. Will make again!! I used shredded colby and monterary cheese.

Thank you for posting this recipe. I dont like mushroom soup and I usually use cream of celery soup for this but I was out of it so the white sauce was great and I will probably use that in the future vs soup. My husband doesnt like peas so I used a can of drained green beans which we buy in quantity and always have on hand. I also added some red pepper flakes and sprinkled with grated fresh Parmesan. Next time I will add tomato slices to the top then sprinkle with Parmesan and see what happens! Great recipe, thanks for posting.

Great recipe.  Perfect for "Oh, no!  I didn't get anything out of the freezer for dinner!"  I added broccoli because I didn't have enough peas, and doubled the sauce, and two cans of tuna.  There were plenty of noodles.  I also topped with fried onions before baking, which was outstanding!  Great suggestion!

I followed the advice of the other reviewers and doubled the sauce. I used heaving whipping cream instead of milk because it was what I had on hand, and put parmesan cheese on top before baking it.

It turned out great! I don't like the traditional cream of mushroom base, because I'm not a fan of those canned style mushrooms, so this is an excellent alternative! Thanks Cat!

Very good-just what i was looking for-I did make a few adjustments to the recipe. I used 2 cans of tuna and american cheese instead of cheddar. I would recommend doubling the cheese sauce for a creamier texture-I needed to add more milk and salt but overall the recipe is convenient.

Nice recipe. Added garlic, onion and mushrooms and doubled the sauce. Other comments were accurate, do need to add something extra to give taste but will definately make it again. It's a lovely basic recipe that is fun to experiment with.

I thought it was dry.  I liked it better before I cooked it in the oven and wonder if it could just be served as a hot pasta...I don't think there were any raw ingredients?  Some cooking sherry would add a nice flavor to this also.  I will probably add some celery next time too.

I followed the advice of other reviewers and didn't use the amount of noodles it called for.  I cooked the full amount and then added them slowly while stirring the sauce until I had the amount that I thought was good.  I topped it with breadcrumbs before baking.  I found that I needed to add a lot of salt to give it some more flavor but overall it's a great base for a tuna noodle casserole.  next time I will add some more spices and possibly some more cheese, as the cheese flavor didn't stand out as much as I would have liked it to

I've got to agree. Triple the sauce and use more milk.  A little on the dry/thick side, but a good, relatively easy dish.

I think I got a little too carried away with this one. I read two pages worth of readers' reviews and jotted down several ways that everyone spiced up the recipe. I thought that if I added a little of everyone's thoughts that I would have a killer dinner. I was wrong. I added steamed frozen spinach and frozen brocoli to a mixture of one can condensed milk and one can of chicken broth using 3 tbsp flour and 1/4 cup of butter. I felt that the tastes of the brocoli and spinach contradicted each other for an unsatisfactory taste. Using simply what I had in the house, I blended six leftover Pillsbury dinner biscuits for a bread topping before putting it in the oven for 15 min. Another bad decision. I felt that the sweetness of the rolls combined with the unpleasant taste of the vegetables was too much for me. I also sauteed onions and mushrooms, but in my hurry to keep adding ingredients to spice up this recipe, I didn't cook them long enough, so the strong taste of onion tended to overpower the other offending tastes. 
And by the way - all that liquid I added was way too much! I ended up making two casseroles!!
   All in all - if you are going to try this recipe, don't make my mistake. Stick to a couple of added ingedients, not 25! Even my husband didn't like my variation, and he eats everything. At first I thought that it was me, since I'm pregnant, but nope, it really wasn't good. I'm giving it four stars though because I'm the one who messed it up.

Sorry, I didn't like this at all, lacked flavour and baking didn't add anything!

The flavor was really good and the consistancy was nice too. I just wished my kids would eat it! My husband and I enjoyed it though!

When I made this I started by sauteeing onions, garlic, and celery, and then added the rest of the ingredients. I even added extra cheese to the sauce and it still did not taste as good as the ones made with canned soup. After I baked it, it came out dry and almost tasteless. I was very disappointed, even after the additions I made.

i added some an extra can of tuna.  this is definitely a recipe to play with until you get it just the way you want it.  it was pretty tasty and i loved how you didn't need a can of soup.  my only criticism is that  baking it is COMPLETELY unnecessary unless you want melted cheese or breadcrumbs on the top.

We loved this! I doubled the sauce and used two undrained cans of tuna. I also added a few shakes of garlic powder and seasoning salt for more flavor. I thought the flour was necessary because it made it nice and thick. I didn't bake it. It was very good.

An Excellent tuna noodle casserole!! I agree with others about this dish needing more sauce so I doubled the amount of sauce and it turned out great. I added one can of drained mushrooms. Very tasty dish!!

I always secretly thought that if Congress wanted to pass meaningful legislation, Tuna Noodle Casserole should be banned.  That said, my boyfriend, who LOVES tuna noodle casserole (but will only eat one kind of lettuce, for example) gave me his most imploring look to make this.  If he can tolerate my carrot juice, soy milk, and mesclun salad, I figured I'd give this a try.  Well, after decades of avoidance, I think I need to admit that maybe I was wrong.  I don't think I'll ever love Tuna Noodle Casserole, but this is a very good recipe.  I doubled the sauce, added mushrooms and seasoned bread crumbs.  Will make again.

I'm giving this only a "4 star" rating, because I'm not much of a tuna casserole freak - however, my husband absolutely loved this and said it reminded him of old time deli tuna melts (he gives it a 5+).  This also was great leftover!

This was a great recipe. Thanks.  I used canned chicken (12 oz) and 2 cups frozen broccoli though because I didn't have any tuna or peas on hand.  I thought the sauce was just the right amount.

I'm embarresed to say that there were zero leftovers. My husbabd and myself singled handedly polished off the whole thing!!

This didn't turn out as well as I thought it would.  The cheese sauce looked great before I mixed everything in...then it just seemed to disappear!  Maybe I used too many noodles?  It got pretty dry after baking.  Should have skipped that step, I think.

Good recipe, especially because it didn't use condensed soup, which is impossible to find in Germany. However, I either overcooked it or needed a bit more "sauce" as it came out a little dry with some of the noodles being rock hard.

This is my boyfriend's favorite dish, and he loved this recipe.  And contrary to the other reviews, I thought it was much better after it was baked.  I added extra cheese on the top and doubled the recipe.  My boyfriend ate almost a whole recipe by himself!

Very basic recipe that didn't include cream of mushroom soup.  I did as others suggested and doubled the cheese mix and didn't bake it.  I did top with breadcrumbs and put under the broiler for a couple minutes.  It was good and quick.

This was really good before I baked it.  It had a really good flavor and it was nice to vary from the mushroom soup recipes I've tried.  After I baked it, it was dry.  Next time I will omit the baking step and just sprinkle crushed potato chips on it.

I made a bunch of changes, but it was really good so I figured I'd review it anyway.
I added a small onion, 1 clove of garlic, black pepper, a can of corn, doubled the sauce and cheese, used 3 cups of spiraled noodles and 2 cans of flaked turkey. I also sprinkled paprika on top. This was great, but a little bland so next time I'll add some heat and maybe peppers. Thanks!

The casserole seemed to be a little dry at first, especially after heating leftovers.  I have found if you add about 3/4 cup milk to the cheese mixture, it helps out a lot.  I also used a small can of peas so they did not dominate the overall taste.

I find that this recipe is better if you add a can of mushrooms, a stalk or two of chopped celery and about 1/2 cup of peas (it's also an excellent way to get your kids to eat veggies without even knowing it!).

This was a wonderful, quick & easy recipe. I followed the advice of others, and used 2 cans of tuna. I also made extra cheese sauce, because I definitely didn't want dry noodles. I put bread crumbs on the top & baked. It turned out great. My boyfriend loved it! Great basic tuna casserole recipe. I will definitely make this again, and look forward to experimenting with this recipe.

This is a great tuna and noodles recipe.  I definitely like the fact that it doesn't call for soup.  I didn't have any egg noodles so I just used spirals and it came out fine.  For a change a pace, try adding french fried onions to the top.

good basic recipe--I used fat free 1/2 & 1/2 for the milk and it was rich and creamy.  I also doubled the amount of tuna.

This was good and pretty easy.  I took the advice of others and added a can of cream of mushroom soup (low fat), but next time I think I will just make more sauce instead.  I also did not have any canned peas so I used canned beans, which was ok, but I will definitely use peas in the future.

This is a easy dish to make for those nights you just want a meal in a jiffy.  Taste is just good enough to get by as something I would make again when I am in a fix on what to prepare.

Nice change of pace for a tuna noodle casserole.  Son and I shared this for dinner while hubby was out of town and we both agreed it was good.
