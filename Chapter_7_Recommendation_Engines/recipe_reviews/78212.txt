Delicious and easy recipe to follow. Because the burgers use 1/2 lb meat each, and are then stuffed they come out to be pretty large burgers. The second time I made these instead of stuffing the burgers, I just seasoned the meat according to the recipe and topped the burgers with the roquefort and bacon, and they were just as tasty, and easier to eat!

Tried these last night using 80-20 ground chuck and gorgonzola cheese.  They were fantastic!  My kids weren't thrilled, but they'll definitely appeal to the adults in the chow line.  I'm going to try making them the next time (soon) with cheddar crumbles and bacon for the kids, and follow the recipe exactly for the adults.

My Husband remembered these from when I had made them over a year ago and just re-requested them tonight.  Again, very good. I recommend using blue or boursin cheese- tried nonfat feta and it just didn't have the same zing, although it did work. I also sauteed mushrooms and placed them atop with a little melted swiss cheese. (Doesn't overpower the other cheese because they are so distinct.)

I used all the elements but I was too lazy and too hungry to mess with the stuffing process.  I had just bought a big bag of real bacon bits so I used about 2 heaping T per burger and mixed it in with the meat.  Blue cheese went on the bottom bun and I added a slice of cheddar to the top. The burger wasn't stuffed but I sure was.

This made an excellent tasting burger and I was pleasantly surprised!  I used gargonzola cheese and the tint of thyme was very good....something I would never have tried on my own.  I used dried thyme, not fresh.  This might be why another reviewer thought the thyme was overpowering.  Remember, don't use the same measurement when switching.  I would probably use only half the amount in any receipe when switching from fresh to dried.   I didn't even have to use ketchup or mustard, etc. like I normally would.  Just a slice of tomato, red onion and fresh lettuce on a Martin's Potato Roll was terrific.   Since I had purchased a pint container of gargonzola and had extra burger (used 80%), I made 2 extra and placed them in the freezer.   Remember to make them large and pretty flat before adding the cheese mixture.  Seal the edges good so no cheese can escape while cooking.  They will shrink while cooking and with both top and bottom patties, they are a pretty hardy burger.  These would be great for most adults if trying to cook up something a little different for a change.  No flavor was so overpowering that it can't be enjoyed by most.  Just follow the directions and make sure to use half the amount of thyme if not using fresh.

This was a fantastic recipe.  I didn't know what Roquefort cheese was so I stuck with blue cheese.  Only thing i could suggest is making sure that you've sealed the cheese in really well in the hamburger.  We had a big problem with the cheese dripping out.  But other than that, it was perfect.

These were a hit, thanks. They were pretty Thyme-y, and I couldn't really taste the cheese. I'll try gorgonzola next time.

This is the best burger ever! I only changed a few things like I omited the thyme (b/c I didn't have any) and I substituted cheddar. My husband can't wait for me to make these again!

My husband and I really enjoyed these burgers. The only thing I did different was mix the blue cheese and bacon in the meat before I made the patties. I have made stuffed burgers in the past and I found it hard to keep them from falling apart. Also, with blue cheese being so pungent, I thought the flavor throughout the meat would be better. I sauteed onions and put extra bacon on top. For a condiment, I got Hidden Valley ranch powder and mixed it with sour cream. Sooo good, I cant wait to make these on the grill.

Gorgonzola, Roquefort, Maytag, Devon, Stilton -they are all varieties of bleu. I think what makes this burger so tasty is the combination of bleu and bacon. The thyme was an unexpected, flavorful surprise.  I made my burgers (with 80/20 ground beef) slider size and added more bacon that suggested. One of the burgers I substitued Swiss for the Gorgonzola since hubby was too keen on the bleu option. Since it was the first time I had made these I opted to cook them on the grill even though the outside temps were so extreme. Overall, a very yummy burger.

Excellent burgers!  Followed the recipe exactly for the seasoning of the patties, then topped the burgers with bacon, blue cheese, and guacamole.  Served with homemade fries.

This was very good!!  I made the burger per my own burger recipe (mixed together ground beef, one chopped onion, one egg, cup of crushed saltine crackers, T. Worcestershire sauce, & T. A1 Bold and Spicy), and stuffed it as described, but used Gorgonzala cheese.  It was delicious!  I was afraid the stuffed cheese was going to be too overpowering, so I didn't use all of it and so wished I would have used it all.  Also, I couldn't taste the bacon as much as I would have liked and think next time I will double the bacon, or just put it on top of the burger after it's done.  Next time I think I will also use gourmet burger buns!  Thanks for the great recipe!

The best burger I have ever made! I used blue cheese, and topped the burgers with avocado, fresh sauteed mushrooms, and swiss. Next time I may try to stuff them with feta and spinach. I also used more worchestershire sauce than the recipes calls for. Very simple to make, and all the stuffing stayed inside the patty.

These burgers are amazing! They are so large, we often skip the buns. I love Roquefort cheese, so I disagree with the other reviews listing cheese substitutions.

Yummy!  These burgers are huge!  We used cheddar cheese in place of the Roquefort.  We also browned them stove top and finished them in the oven.  These will definitely make it into regular rotation.  Thank you!

very good though I mix the blue cheese and bacon throughout the buger and not stuff it.... I have had bad luck in the past with stuffed burgers: biting into a burger with melted cheese in the middle (WHEN I was able to seal it properly and not have the cheese leak out in the first place...though blue cheese not being firmer would have less of that problem) I got a burned mouth or tongue hitting a center of hot melted cheese. I have had blue cheese and bacon burgers before but the thyme was a different twist on it. aHubby liked the burgers. My daughter did not care for the thyme as much (gave it "eh OK") rating. What she objected to was the crunchy bacon bits in her burger....just didn't like the crunchy bits with the soft burger. I have another bacon blue cheese burger recipe that they both loved....so I will keep the other one since it has appeal for all here.
