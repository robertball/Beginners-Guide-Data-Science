I absolutely love smoothies!!  They are one of my favorite breakfast items....except I made this one for my lunch today.  I love the oatmeal in it, but think that 1/2 a cup is a little too much.  I used quick cooking oats since that's what I normally have on hand and substituted a container of strawberry yogurt for the strawberries.  I have not been able to find a decent batch of strawberries yet this year. They are not sweet for some reason, so I'm a little hesitant to buy them.  Anyway, the oatmeal made this smoothie VERY filling and I too omitted the vanilla and sugar since I used vanilla flavored soy milk.  Great new find...thanks Astrophe.

FABULOUS!  I have never tried a smoothy with oatmeal!  Who'da thunk!  Well this is great.  I also tried a variation of using fresh juice in place of the soymilk.  Fresh pineapple juice was especially yummy!  Also, when you use juice in place, no sugar or vanilla is needed.  Thanks for this great idea.  I am thinking of trying wheat flakes too!

This is a great morning smoothie. If I don't have frozen strawberries I make sure the banana is frozen.. one of them has to be or else it is too liquidy. Also, substituting half the strawberries with peaches is a great combo too. This recipe says 2 servings, but really it's the size of a regular smoothie you'd get at a place like Jamba Juice.

I ran the oatmeal through my blender before adding the rest of the ingredients. I used a frozen banana as well as the frozen strawberries and used whole milk. (We don't drink soy.) I thought it was good, as did my kids. The sugar wasn't really needed, IMO, as I felt it was sweet enough on it's own. It's just a personal preferance.

This is delicious!  I grind up the oatmeal in the blender first and sometimes use a combination of frozen strawberries and peaches.  I love the thick texture the oats give it, and it's very filling.  My boyfriend begs for these.

I LOVE this smoothie! I've made it literally hundreds of times since I first found it two years ago. It has just the right amount of sweetness, and it's thick and filling with the strawberries and oatmeal, so I often have it as a meal . Like others, I always process the oats first to a powder. I then add the milk, and I add just enough strawberries to meet the level of milk instead of counting them, since the size of the strawberries often varies. I find this gives it just the right consistency every time! Thanks for a great recipe!!

Pretty good! I cut this in half and used skim milk instead of soy.  It's very filling - I love the strawberry banana combination.

Being a chocolate lover, I didn't try this recipe as written, though it does sound good. I used chocolate soy milk instead of regular, and in place of the sugar, I used chocolate milk powder. Yum!

This is for all smoothies that use raw oatmeal.  Soak oatmeal overnight or for 10 mins. in milk (1/2 c. to l c. milk)before adding to any smoothie to avoid any grainy texture.  Works great! I use this method for having cold oatmeal for breakfast during summer months and adding yogurt instead of milk overnight. Then add fresh fruit in morning for a delicious cold cereal.

Since Hubs is not a fan of oatmeal (except in cookies) I thought I'd try sneaking some in this drink and make him something really wholesome and satisfying.  It didn't really work. Even using the Vitamix it didn't blend to complete smoothie smoothness and creaminess and the uncooked oatmeal taste was unpleasantly apparent.  I used regular milk instead of soy, and had I skipped the oats I think he would have been a happier camper.

This smoothy was very invigorating. It gives you energy! You do not need a big serving of this to start your day. It was filling and satisfying. Some people may want more sweetness but it's healthy the way it is.

Really yummy smoothie! I loved having the oats in the drink (I did grind mine into a fine powder with a mortar and pestle). It felt really wholesome and was a great way to start my morning.

Super quick and super easy!  I find that the banana and strawberries combined with vanilla soy milk make this plenty sweet, so I omit the white sugar and vanilla altogether.

Delicious!! I really liked the oatmeal flavor in this and was a little unsure about that before I made them.  I didn't have soy milk, so I just used 1%, otherwise I followed the recipe!  I did like another reviewer's suggestion to try chocolate soy milk - maybe we'll do that next time! :)

What a great idea to add oatmeal to a smoothie! A good way to get your oatmeal in the summer without having to heat it up!  I also added ground flax seed to this for omega 3 fatty acids...Even more nutritious!

This was delicious! I've been on a smoothie kick since I've been pregnant and this is definitely one I'll be adding to my rotation.  I did have to decrease the oats and grind them first because I'm not big on the bits of chewy stuff, but it's a great concept to add oats to make it more filling.
Edited to add: This is NOT a smoothie you can put in the fridge and come back to if you don't finish it.  The oatmeal gets really thick and becomes pretty gross and grey.  Definitely want to drink this when it's fresh!

OMG...I love this! I did change a few things but only because I couldn't wait to try it until I went to the grocery store!!! 1. I did blend up the oats first like others suggested. 2. I used skim milk. 3. I did not have frozen strawberries so I used a few splashes of grape juice. 3. My bananas were frozen. 4. I did not add sugar because of the sweetness of the grape juice. OMG....so good!!! I love the hearty texture and earthy flavor the oatmeal gives. I cannot wait to try it with the strawberries! I want one right now! lol

Tastes great, very filling! I added 2 tsp. of sugar. Next time I will decrease the oats to just under a 1/2 cup & add a splash of O.J. for a more dimensional flavor. I have found that adding a Coffee Mate French vanilla (in liquid form) tastes great in smoothies too.

This is a fun way to sneak in some more whole grains.  I blended the oats first, till they were powdery.  It is definitely pastey consistency, but I don't mind it.    I used regular milk and frozen bananas.  Tried it without the sugar, but ended up needing it.  It's a great starting point for other fun creations!

I eat oatmeal year round and found I like this smoothie better if I cook the oatmeal in the microwave first to absorb the liquid, then put it in the blender along with the frozen fruit, banana and additional milk.  Pre-cooking the oatmeal prevents the gritty texture and also the extra thickening that occurs when the uncooked ground oats start absorbing the liquid.  Much smoother texture this way and only adds about three extra minutes to the process.

I am not a fan of drinks where you can taste bits that get stuck in your teeth.  This is what happened for me where the oatmeal got chopped up and turned into a powder.  I compare this to those Protein shake drinks where you can taste the powder.  I wonder if I cooked the oatmeal first if it would have been different.  Anyway I guess this was a bit better then those Protein shakes but it is not for me.

Delicious!  I have tried other smoothie recipes with varying degrees of success and this one really delivers!  It is smooth & creamy and just the right thickness.  I didn't have soy milk so I just used 1 cup of skim and did add the vanilla & sugar.  Tasted great!  This one will be a regular!

Pretty tasty. I can definitely see using this as a morning meal. Currently, I am looking for a smoothie to serve with Easter brunch, and it's a little to oatmealy for that, but definitely a keeper for other purposes.

This is one of my favorite smoothie recipes, now.  It's great!  It's so good that it's hard to believe that it's so healthy.  I didn't even have to add any sugar (honey would be a better option, though, if sweetener is needed, I think), and the vanilla adds a nice flavor.  If you don't have soy milk, use regular milk, and you can add soy powder to it.  I hope you'll try it.

This was pretty good considering that my idea of eating oatmeal is when it's in cookies.  I used skim milk, sweetener, and added about 1/4 cup of pineapple chunks. I didn't use the vanilla.  My Vitamix blender whipped the drink into silky smoothness.  My husband loved it.  I have been making this for a couple of years.  I like having it for breakfast because it is very filling and keeps the munchies at bay.  In the beginning, I was having a hard time with the raw oats taste so I started lightly toasting the oats to see if that would ease the raw taste.  My husband says he can't tell the difference, but I can.  To toast the oats, I measure enough rolled oats to last for a week and place them on a large foil lined cookie sheet and lightly toast them at 300 degrees for a few minutes.  The oats need to be stirred a couple of times to keep them from burning.  They toast quickly. Once they are finished, I let them cool and grind them in my Vitamix and store the powder in a container.  I have also toasted the oats on top of the stove in a large skillet over medium heat.  I just stir them constantly until they start to smell like they are toasting (sort of nutty) and remove them from the heat, and the skillet.    I used the skillet method the first time I toasted them, and since it was an experiment, I only toasted a 1/2 cup of oats. Fortunately it worked it out for me!

I've made this a few times, and followed the recipe exactly. I think it tastes quite good and it is filling. I usually drink this smoothie before going to class when I'm in a rush. It's very quick to make and it's healthy for you. Oh, when I'm out of strawberries, I use powdered chocolate (the one you use to make chocolate milk for kids). It tastes just as delicious as when you add strawberries, so if you run out of strawberries, you can substitute it with chocolate. I definitely recommend this for people who want to make a quick healthy, delicious AND FILLING breakfast smoothie. If you usually don't have time to sit and eat breakfast at the table like me, I highly recommend you to try this recipe at least once. It's very good :)

This was nice for a breakfast change.  I blended the oatmeal first so it would be more of a powdered texture and less obvious.

I have been making smoothies almost every day for breakfast, but had never seen a recipe with oats in it, so I was really looking forward to trying this. I am so glad I did! Filling & delicious! I like that you can change up ingredients to your liking or what you have on hand as well. I used steel cut oats & ground them up a bit in blender first. I also had some plain yogurt so added that along with the soy milk. I had frozen mixed berries that I used in place of the strawberries and also threw in about 2 tablespoons of cocoa and some flaxseed meal. I felt this did not need the sugar, which I was happy about. I loved the addition of oats and this will be my new "daily breakfast smoothie" from now on!!!!

This recipe received many raves when I took it to a breakfast meeting. My kids loved it too. Didn't have soy milk so I used regular milk. I only used 1/4 cup oatmeal, but a full tsp. of vanilla. Other than that followed the recipe. Very tasty.

I was eager to try this, as I have to eat breakfast or I get physically ill, and I hate breakfast foods.  I love strawberries, and I love oatmeal, so why not?  It was a little bland, but not bad.  I didn't feel hungry at all.  Next time I will try adding some other fruits, maybe some spices?  Overall, I will use this recipe again, but it needs modified a bit.

This is a delicious smoothie.  I used 1% milk and did add the sugar and vanilla.  It is very filling and so easy and fast.  The oatmeal is a little gritty, but I didn't mind.  Give this a try!

Great smoothie - I used all the ingredients listed, but I used cooked oatmeal rather than raw oats.  I had made oatmeal, but decided to use it in the smoothie rather than eating it.  I loved the consistency the cooked oatmeal gave the drink.  I've made this recipe a couple of times since and have changed up the fruit flavors, but still used the cooked oatmeal.  I've also tried adding a few ice cubes to make the drink colder.  This smoothie is a winner.  Thanks for sharing.

Delicious smoothie with a nice texture thanks to the oatmeal. I use almond milk instead of soy and, if I don't have any bananas on hand, add for some extra berries instead. This is a pretty thin/watery smoothie- if you prefer something a little bit thicker/icier then freeze your banana as well. You can even leave out the sugar and it is still quite sweet thanks to the fruit and vanilla.

I did what a couple other reviewers have done and put the oatmeal in the blender first and ground it into almost a powder and then added the ingredients. I didn't use as many strawberries, and instead used frozen raspberries. I also used frozen banana and added 1.5 heaping tablespoons of soy protein powder. It's good, just VERY thick and I think next time I'm going to cut the oatmeal in half. Great recipe!

Something new, healthy and yummy! This recipe has plenty of room for preferences (fresh/frozen strawberries, peaches, blueberries, etc. !!!) I used an organic instant oatmeat packet which was perfect because it only contains natural ingrediants and was exactly a half cup - maple and brown sugar or cinnamon and spice are perfect because they add plenty of flavor and there is no need to add extra sugar or vanilla. The end result was delicious, filling and gave me ample amounts of energy! A great recipe - thank you!

Really delicious addition to my breakfast! I loved it and so did my husband(and he usually hates oats).
As the other reviewers recommended, I powdered the oats before using them. I also tried substituting the oats partially with wheat germ and it worked out well. Thanks!

This was really good.  I made it exactly as directed (using cows milk), but my frozen strawberries were sliced, so I just added them until it was thick.  Both my young kids and my husband loved it, as did I.  The oatmeal adds a bit of a gritty texture, but it also adds a really good flavor.  I had never thought about putting oats in smoothies, but I really like it.

This recipe has become our standard breakfast for the past 6 months -- thanks so much!!  My system is to layer the oatmeal, then banana, then plain soy milk in the blender and let that soak while we have our morning coffee (about half an hour).  Then I blend those 3 together at a high speed to break up the oatmeal.  Then I add a small handful of frozen raspberries and blend thoroughly; then about 8-10 frozen strawberries and blend again.  It makes enough for my husband to have a full glass and for me to have about 2/3 of a glass.  We love having all these healthy things to start our day and we don't feel the need to add any sweeteners or other  ingredients.  So yummy!

My kids loved this smoothie!  I used a packet of individual flavored oatmeal because I didn't have any regular in the house.  Grinding it up first made all the difference in my kids not tasting it.  I also froze the bananas and used 1 1/2 for a thicker smoothie.  I passed it off as a "milk shake" and it worked!  I also used splenda instead of white sugar. I will make this again!  Thanks!

I leave out the sugar and it makes a great healthy breakfast drink for those on the go times.  Sometimes I add a serving of tofu to the ingredients for added protein.

I loved this smoothie! My husband did not like it because of the oatmeal, but the oatmeal is what I liked the most. I suggest 1/4 cup oatmeal, finely ground, for pickier eaters.

This is indeed very filling, it is great for quick breakfast. I vary it with other frozen fruits. Maybe a little gritty with the rolled oats but still nice and thick.

I use this recipe almost every day.  I combine the oatmeal and milk (or juice) the night before then in the morning the oatmeal is softer and blends better. I use all kinds of fruits and veggies in this recipe!

I substituted honey for the sugar & ground up the oatmeal 1st like several other people commented & it was wonderful!  The 2nd time I wanted one I was out of strawberries so I used homemade raspberry jam, skipped the sugar & threw in a banana.  Then the kids made them with instant flavored oatmeal & fruit with no added sugar.  Great basic recipe to get oatmeal without even noticing!

I really liked the oatmeal taste of this. I took someone's advice about soaking the oats--I soaked them in half a cup of soy milk for about a half hour (didn't drain--the oats soak up most of the milk). I used 1 T. of honey instead of the sugar. I put the honey, some flax oil, the vanilla and the oats in first and blended for about 30 seconds to make sure the oats got well blended, then added the milk, banana and strawberries.

This recipe did not turn out well for me at all.  I found it way too thick and I the overall flavor was not my thing.  I did like the flavor and texture that the oatmeal brought to the smoothie and I will try incorporating it into other smoothie recipes I like.

Need to grind the oats really fine, close to powder like. Didn't do sugar or vanilla.  Added vanilla yogurt instead

This smoothie is good for quick breakfasts especially in the winter before going to work.  If it sets too long though the oatmeal clumps a bit.  Stir as you drink!

If I hadn't tried it I would never have believed it!  I first made it exactly as written for 2 servings, except that I did substitute non-fat milk for the soy milk, and I used a pack of Sweet and Low instead of white sugar.  (I also ground the oatmeal first as so many of the previous reviewers had suggested).  It was good, but I thought it could be better, so I added 1/4 cup orange juice and 1/4 cup pineapple juice.  It was great, but a little thin.  So I threw in 6 ice cubes, and it was perfect!  Thanks to all the previous reviewers for making this sound so good that curiosity made me try it.  I'm going to compute the "points" and share it with my Weight Watcher friends. (and I'm going to experiment with some mango and peaches, etc.)

this is absolutely delicious.  mine was not vegan, i used skim milk and a bit of vanilla yogurt.  otherwise, just like the recipe.  one day i added some mango i needed to use up.  the oats make it a little texturey (is that a word?), but we loved it.  i think you could blend the oats first and then add other ingredients, but i always forget to do that.  thanks for this healthy breakfast drink!!

Awesome! I just got my wisdom teeth out and really can't have much besides smoothies and applesauce so I wanted something filling and delicious and this was perfect! It totally filled me up, and the sweet flavor of the strawberries and banana blended very well with the oatmeal. I didn't have any soy milk on hand but I did have some almond/coconut blend milk so I used that and it was delicious. This is going to become a new breakfast staple for me.

I made it with Almond Milk as can't have the soy, but it was really good.  Added frozen blueberries to bananas and strawberries, and organic oats & T of powered wheatgrass - in place of white sugar I used organic coconut sugar - family loved it as our teens love smoothies for breakfast too.  Filled us up nicely.  Oh, also added a handful of raw pecans for a twist.

I love this for breakfast, but i don't add the sugar, and i use almond milk, not soy milk. I also used Bob's Red Mill high fiber oat bran, instead on rolled oats.  My stomach is happy with this, as i have become sensitive to dairy, and gluten. 
  I've also tried making this with blueberry Kefir, and frozen strawberries, blackberries, raspberries, blueberries, and 1 tablespoon of chia seeds, and 1 tablespoon of ground flax seed, with almond milk. LOVE IT!!

What a great way to get the healthy benefits of oatmeal if you don't like it.  I just made this today and it was so good and I couldn't tell I was drinking oatmeal.  I followed the ingredients but omitted the sugar.  It didn't need it.  I had frozen rasberries on hand so used them insead of strawberries.  Any frozen fruit would work.  Since I am lactose intollerent I have to use lactose free milk.  I had chocolate on hand so I used that.  It couldn't haven't been tastier.  I put the oatmeal in my Magic Bullet to pulversize it, added the milk (I cut the recipe in half because I only wanted one serving but I still used l cup of milk because I wanted it thinner) berries, banana, vanilla, and bingo - a new delicious, healthy drink.  Thanks Astrophe!

Well, the flavor / texture of the oats seemed to overpower and get in the way of the fruit smoothie.  I really wanted to try it, though, cause I like the idea of adding such a nutritious ingredient to a regular smoothie a lot.  Could there be a different way to prepare the oats so that it would blend in more naturally?

I put the oats in the blender first as other reviewers suggested and substituted skim milk for the soy and stevia for the sugar.  I used sliced frozen strawberries, so it was hard to determine how many to add.  I ended up having to add more milk because it was very thick.  We thought it was very good.  The oats give it a nice texture.  We will make this again.

I love smoothies and make them a lot. After reading all the high reviews I thought I'd try this one since it would be more filling with the oatmeal. I followed the recipe exactly and could not drink it. The oatmeal taste is so strong and really gave it a bad aftertaste. The consistency of the oatmeal really turned me off too. I even grinded the oats up first. I would suggest making half the recipe to try before wasting a bunch of ingredients in case you don't like it.

I don't know what I did wrong but I didn't like the texture, even though I ground up the oatmeal first, and I didn't think it was sweet enough. My husband thought it was "ok" but I don't think I will make it again.

Love the idea of getting oatmeal into a drink, but I feel there was too much in this recipe for me. Also I will decrease the amount of strawberries next time. Freezing the berries somewhat helps make a thicker drink. I ground the oatmeal as fine as I could get it in a food processor. I found while photographing it, the oatmeal softened making a better texture. Now I will always have some  prepared oatmeal made-up when I need an on-the-go breakfast. Lots of variations to play around with here.

First time that I've ever had a smoothie with oatmeal.  I don't really like the taste of bananas, so I was worried that I wouldn't like it.  The smoothie tasted great and all of the flavors blended well.  Can't wait to make it again :)

I recently bought a personal blender and was looking for a good smoothie recipe with which to break it in. I settled on this one and BOY was it a good choice. I've been making them all week. The only changes I make are that I use regular 2% milk and about 8 frozen strawberries because 14 is just too many for my small blender. I also blend the oats first, then add the milk and strawberries and top with the bananas, sugar, and vanilla. It turns out perfectly. As others have said, it's filling, but it didn't overdo it for me. It's a good snack or healthy dessert after a smaller meal. The oats are a nice touch that I never would have thought to use. I know I'll be making this recipe long into the future.

Absolutely love these smoothies! Made it with Almond Milk initially and loved that too. I agree with those that wrote about grinding the rolled oats first. Makes a big differece in the texture. Great breakfast!

Very delicous, and a good start to your day. I make this just about every morning for a quick but nutritious breakfast. I can't really taste the banana much, I guess the strawberries kind of overpower it, but still very good. I added a little cinnamon and nutmeg to it as well. Love the rolled oats.
 A lot of people are saying that one serving isn't much, but really its plenty, at least for me. One serving nearly fills a tall glass, and this is a very filling smoothie.

Great foundation for any smoothie! The oatmeal adds a great creamy texture. I also blended Flax seeds and Sunflower seeds with my oats. I substituted Frozen Blueberries for Strawberries. I also used an orange for sweetness instead of adding sugar. I'm really happy with this breakfast smoothie and I will be adding it to my personal Recipe Book. Thanks! :)

Yum! The first time I made this (years ago!), I did so as written and was put off by how the oatmeal felt in my mouth.   I tried it again today because I wanted a really filling breakfast smoothie, and decided to finely grind the oats into powder before adding it to my smoothie ingredients. Oh my!! What a difference.  Rich and creamy and so good.  I didn't have a banana, so just used all strawberries, used regular lowfat milk and also didn't want to use sugar, so used some organic honey.  Fabulous!

I too put the oats in first and grind them up smooth before adding the milk and fruit. I have used both regular milk and soy. If using fresh fruit, just throw in a few ice cubes. I've even used a little brown sugar when it was easier to get to then my white. Possibilities are endless with this one. Great breakfast and very filling.

best smoothie i have ever made! (and believe me, I've made a whole lot of them!) it is delicious and actually keeps with me through the whole morning. i would suggest grinding the oatmeal into a fine powder first, it gets better results. at first i was dubious about putting raw oats in at all, but it adds extra protein to get you through the day.

This was really good,  but I did make a few changes.  I didn't use soy milk,  I grew up on a dairy farm,  we support our dairymen.  I used skim milk, no banana, didn't have any, added blueberries, used honey instead of sugar, and added in a container of strawberry yogurt.  Turned out great, will make again soon!!

This was delicious and filling- I used frozen strawberries and raspberries, added flax seed oil, powdered fiber and used vanilla yogurt instead of milk. Very good, I will be making this more.

Really great smoothie.  After all the smoothies I've made, never would have thought to add oatmeal.  I just put regular oatmeal in my blender to make it powdery fine first before making the smoothie.  Don't bother adding any sugar, the fruit makes it sweet enough.  I did add a handful of spinach though.

I use vanilla almond milk instead of soy b/c it's healthier (soy mimics estrogen) and the sweetness of the vanilla eliminates the need for sugar.  Also, any berry will work if you don't have strawberries on hand.

Fantastic!!  In my repertoire of healthy breakfast meals.  Thank you!!.  Has anyone tried making this the night before?  When one of us is on a business trip and need to rush out extra early it would be nice to gulp down a glass.  I'll try it a few times and report back.

While I didn't follow the exact recipe (aren't smoothies a formula??), I DID start to use the oatmeal trick in my smoothies. I actually take a quart jar, fill it with oats and then take my immersion blender and make it into flour and add that to the smoothie. A tablespoon of flax seed too and you have a GREAT healthy drink in the morning!

I had such high hopes for this...I was prepared to love it!  Not so much.  It really had very little taste to it, surprisingly...I followed the recipe, though I did sub skim milk for soy milk and I subbed kiwi for banana for personal preference.  I also ended up adding a few splashes of pineapple juice to provide enough liquid to make it blend.  I'm not sure how else to describe it, other than *bland*...TY for the idea of adding oatmeal to smoothies, though, I will def use that in my *regular* strawberry smoothie!

This is so easy when you don't want to cook breakfast or serve a regular cold cereal. You can make this in a variety of ways.  I love to put half an avocado, banana, and maybe some honey if the banana isn't ripe enough.  Never add sugar.  You can add ground flax seed to this as well.  My kids love it as a snack too.

This is really awesome. I only made a few changes - one whole small banana, no sugar, 2 tsp honey, milk instead of soy and I added 3 tsp of oat branfor extra nutrition. I also ground up the oats and bran in the blender before adding the other ingredients as others have suggested. This will be my new morning routine for a healthy breakfast. I am giving this recipes to friends tomorrow at work!!!!!!!

I used Kashi's Heart to Heart instant packet of oatmeal for this.  Didn't need to add any sugar or vanilla.  I also did not add a banana.  I put frozen blueberries along w/ the frozen strawberries and it was good that way also.

This smoothie is one of the best I've made. I used strawberries and cream instant oatmeal, almond milk instead of soy milk, and a frozen banana. I also used stevia instead of cane sugar. I think the strawberries and cream instant oatmeal was a stroke of genius. Exquisite!

I saw this recipe about 4 weeks ago.   I tried it out and have been making this smoothie for breakfast every day for 4 weeks.  I absolutely love this.  I have tried different types of berries but strawberries work the best.  I omitted the vanilla and sugar.  I have been using sweetened vanilla flavored almond milk. Taste delish...thanks for the recipe.

Didn't love it, thought it was a bit chalky the oats were to over powering, it grew on me as I drank it all and it did need me satisfied until lunch.I used almond milk instead of soy milk and I also added  1TBS of Chia seeds, which I usually sneak in to mimic strawberry seeds and hubby has no clue but it packs a punch of omega. I think next time I'm going to try mixed berries instead, I think raspberries and blackberries are stronger in taste and will tone down the strong oatmeal taste.

I love the nutty flavor the oats give to the smoothly. This recipe is PERFECT as is. I make smoothies everyday.  Here are some suggestions.  After pulverizing the oats, add frozen banana, 1/2 cup frozen blueberries, 8 frozen strawberries. Instead of the sugar I use 1/2 tsp of honey, 1tsp vanilla (I vanilla everything), 1/2 cup of fat free milk, 1 cup of cold water. Enjoy.

I just bought one of those fancy expensive blenders and love making different smoothies.  I was actually looking for something more filling in the morning and adding oats is a great idea! I'm not a vegan or vegetarian but I must say this was pretty tasty.  I halved it and just used vanilla soy milk instead of the extract and organic agave nectar instead of the white sugar. Next time I will add some veggies.

This smoothie was one of the best. It was so delicious. I drink it every morning now. Who would have guessed oatmeal would go so well in a smoothie. thanks for sharing your recipe.

Very delicious and filling. The first time I soaked the rolled oats in soy milk for about 15-20 minutes. It wasn't too bad but the second time it was just right. I soaked the oats overnight and the next morning, it blended well. Both times I used low fat vanilla soy milk and vanilla extract as well. My husband and I loved it! Next time I will go with Sarah Jo's technique and put oats in a blender before mixing with the other ingredients. Definitely a keeper. Thank you Astrophe for sharing.

GREAT!!!  I substituted Greek yogurt for the milk, no sugar, no vanilla.  It was delicious.  I also ground the oatmeal first.

Fantastic!  I made this recipe exactly as stated except I had no bananas, so I just used frozen strawberries and kept adding until the smoothie was thick enough.  I also used honey instead of sugar.  I did follow the suggestions of others and ground up the rolled oats first before adding the other ingredients.  My husband and I both loved it and it will make a great breakfast alternative for those mornings when we don't have time to eat.  Thank you for a great recipe!

YUM! I've made this twice. The first time I made it with whole milk. The second I used goat milk due to allergies ( it was creamier than the milk version) and I used honey instead of sugar. My children just love this. I even added a handful of spinach the second time when we had it for lunch. You couldn't even taste a difference!

This is really good. I love the addition of the oats and vanilla because it mellows the sweetness from the fruits. No need to use any sugar. I used a frozen banana in addition to frozen fruit and had  to add another cup+ of milk to get it to a consistency that could be drank. 14 strawberries is a pint or about 16 ounces. I used frozen blueberries and used 2 very full cups of berries for a change.

This smoothie is really easy to make and tastes great! Be careful when using a blender to blend ingredients one by one because the smoothy gets really thick.

Excellent, I'm not vegan, so I used skim milk; had on hand raspberries, pretty much the same otherwise. I love the oatmeal in it. Very satisfying.

This was really yummy. Next time I will soak the oatmeal in the milk for a few minutes before mixing it and then adding the other ingredients. I didn't like the texture of the ground oatmeal but love the idea of having it in the smoothie for extra protein.

This is a fresh, yummy, and filling smoothie. 
I made it according to the directions except I used regular milk instead of soy. 
Next time I will probably use vanilla yogert instead of adding the sugar and vanilla extract. 
Great recipe though. Will definitely be having it again soon!

After many times making this I came up with my own delicious modified version:  

1/4 cup oat (75 cals)
1 cup unsweetened almond vanilla milk (35 cals)
10 frozen strawberries (40 cals)
1 banana (100 cals)
1 tsp vanilla extract
2 packets Truvia.  

SO yummy filling, and just 250 calories for the entire thing!

Very filling and completely versatile.I've tried strawberrie & mango,strawberries & peaches and chocolate & strawberries and they all turned out great! I also added some vanilla yogurt and used splenda instead of white sugar. This is my go-to for a fast meal replacement.

GREAT RECIPE!  I was looking for a way to sneak oatmeal into breakfast for my 5 yr old. she loves these shakes! I omitted the white sugar and sweetened with a little agave nectar. another time I used almond milk and omitted the vanilla. worked perfect both ways! I also took the oats and ground till fine powder like someone suggested. great idea! thanks for the recipe!

Great smoothie!  I had read a prior review where someone suggested adding the oats first and grinding them up.  Doing this without adding liquid clogged up my blender.  I would also recommend chopping up the frozen strawberries to make the blending process easier.

A lot of oats.  I tried adding more vanilla and still only taste the oats.  Would probably reduce those and add more vanilla next time!

First time making a smoothie. I followed the directions with the exception of using vanilla yogurt in place of soy milk and only half the amount. I also added ground flaxseed for fiber. My preschooler loved it, I thought it was alright. But will keep making it for him. Oh, I left out half of the oatmeal too.

Couldn't get it to blend without adding extra milk. Then it didn't have much flavor.  I like the idea of adding oats...but it does make it a touch grainy.

I followed the suggestions from comments and blended just the oats first, but it still came out very grainy - but very, very tasty. The next time I made it, I blended the oats and then added the milk, and let it soak for about 10 minutes before adding the rest of the ingredients and blending. That helped, but next time I'll soak them longer. The flavor was very good - the nuttiness of the oats really complements the strawberry. (I didn't use banana, as my daughter is allergic.)

I was *SO* impressed with these smoothies! Had them already a few times this week, and will definitely use the recipe again. They were fast, almost effortless and pretty darned delicious! Filled me up all morning, as promised.  The recipe tastes great as is, but I think that you're pretty free to change the fruits/dairy as you please and still end up with a great smoothie. For a thicker drink I might try yogurt instead of soy milk, or substitute the fruit for raspberries.

This is good and filling.  Reduced oats to 1/4 cup and no sugar was added.  I only had 8 strawberries and it was still good.  I blended the oats before adding the rest of the stuff.  I will make this again.  Kept me full for longer than usual.(maybe I will lose some pounds) LOL

To be fair, I rated this recipe in Jan 2011 and now again tried it in Jan 2014. The first time I tried it I had a different blender and did not care for it due to the oatmeal being so prominent and I didn't like drinking gummy hard bits of uncooked oatmeal, according to my old review. I had also written that it left a chalky taste. Years later after trying quite a few smoothies in vanilla and chocolate like flavors with oatmeal, that I just love, I decided to give it another try. I also upgraded to a Vitamix blender.  The oatmeal became liquefied this time, but again it was still bland and left a chalky like after taste. I may have to read the reviews sometime to see how others may have improved on the flavor. I like everything in it, but I guess not all together.

Very good and filling!!  I used skim milk instead of soy milk and did not add the sugar.  I've done it with frozen strawberries and then with frozen mixed berries - delicious both ways!  I followed another reviewer's suggestion to finely grind the oatmeal before adding everything else.  Never would have thought to add oatmeal to a smoothie.  Loved it!!

Now this was good. I used almond milk because thats what I had. I put two bananas and I put some fresh spinach in there. You cant even taste the spinach even though the spinach doesnt make it look appealing it was a very tasty breakfast drink.  Yum Yup

Easy and delicious. Kids enjoyed it for an after school snack. Put in about a large TB of oj concentrate for fruitier flavor. I put oats in magic bullet. This would be really good with almond milk. I will make this again!

This is a very yummy and filling smoothie! I am doing a cleanse right now, and this was a perfect breakfast for someone who cannot have dairy, protein, or processed foods.  I did add 2 tbsp. flaxseed meal, and substituted 1/2 cup natural apple juice and 1/2 unsweetened almond milk for the soy.  I also added 1 package of french vanilla stevia sweetener.  The oatmeal gives it a very interesting texture.  I will definitely be making this one over and over again!  Thanks.

This was okay. I had to add quite a bit more milk to get it to a texture that wasn't too thick to swallow.

I would have never have thought to put oatmeal in a smoothie, but it works!  It adds a nice, nutty flavor, and I don't mind the texture at all.  I used vanilla soy milk, so I didn't add the vanilla extract, and instead of sugar, I used Splenda.  This was extremely filling and delicious-- will definitely become a regular in my house.  Thanks!

The oatmeal makes this smoothie thick and creamy but in a smooth way. You can't even tell it's there. But it gives this a nutrition boost. The flavor is smooth, too, with no tang whatsoever. Whether that's a good thing or not depends on personal preference.

I'm afraid I may have made this wrong...I didn't grind the oatmeal. I gave it such a low rating not because of flavour but due to colour and texture. The oatmeal caused it to take a slightly brown/yellow hue and made it extra chunky.

Yummy and thick, but a little gritty (but it was so good I didn't mind that too much!) I also used the last of the rolled oats for my smoothie, so when I made it for my mom I subbed 1/3 cup oat bran instead of the 1/2 cup oats and it worked great. It was good made with both almondmilk and ricemilk. I will be making this one again!

There are several healthy foods I know I don't eat enough: oatmeal and fruits are among them.   Not having soy, I used 2% milk. Since I keep ground oatmeal on hand for all-natural beauty recipes, I used 1/2 cup of that since I did not think I would like the texture of the whole oats. I also used 1.5 teaspoons honey rather than sugar and added 2 tbs ground flaxseed. Next time, I'm adding 2 tbs wheat germ.  The smoothie tasted delicious, just sweet enough, with the perfect consistency. I'm psyched to include this in my diet regularly. I'm definitely going to use soy milk in the future, though, since it has more vitamins, etc, than regular milk.

wow this was really good, my 3 yr old drank all of his right away while simultaneously saying mmmmm and an occasional yummy. I'll be making this often. the only changes i made were to use vanilla rice milk and i didn't add sugar or the vanilla. i also ground up half the oats before adding. thanks for the great recipe:)

So thick, I almost couldn't swallow it down and the oatmeal had an overwhelming raw taste along with the texture of swallowing little pieces of paper.  The actual 'taste' wasn't horrible that is why I gave it 2 stars however, the texture leaves A LOT to be desired.

Thanks for a great smoothie. I took out the sugar and added only half of an individual serving packet of Splenda. Really could do without the sugar if you like raw, unsweetened fruit taste. I was just craving a little sweetness. I did grind the oats first, nice texture. Will make again.

Very drinkable, which is the best I could ever possibly hope for in something so healthy, My new morning routine. I halved the recipe and still couldn't drink it all, it's so filling. I may use half the oatmeal next time, so it's not so thick and grainy, and add a dose of soy protien isolate to boost the protein so it fends off hunger longer. I see lots of potential by adding different kinds of fruits. It's got me to thinking of all the various drinks I could add oatmeal to to make them more of a "meal replacement", like V-8 juice. A good solid recipe to use as a base for other experiments in smoothie-land.

Sounded different. Thought I'd give it a try. Didn't have strawberries so I used frozen blackberries instead.Texture was alittle gritty so next time I'll try pulverizing the oats first in my coffee grinder. Flavor was REALLY GOOD though even made with the blackberries.Gave it a pretty purple color. Thanks for something new, quick and different.

This is the perfect way to start the day. I varied the recipe a little bit, using some of the other reviewers' suggestions: I use vanilla soy milk and cut the vanilla and sugar,and I grind the oats for a smoother texture. I also add 2 tbls of ground flax seed, which adds essential fatty acids and a very nice flavor. I love this recipe. It's very filling and keeps me going throughout the morning. Delicious!

I have to go against popular opinion and say I did not like this smoothie and neither did my children.  I found the oatmeal taste overwhelming, the texture too grainy/powdery and it was too thick for my liking.

This is great. I put the oatmeal in the blender and blend it to down to a near powder and then add the rest of the ingredients, using soy or almond milk instead of regular milk. I also usually freeze the banana and I don't use quite so much sugar. It is almost like ice cream and it is not only good but good for you. I added Mexican vanilla last time and it gave it a new taste dimension. I have also used cherry and almond flavoring in the past (just depends upon what fruit I am using). Sooooo GOOD!!!

My husband thought this was perfect.  Other smoothies were not filling enough for him for breakfast and he would be hungry still.  But he found this one to be filling enough to hold him over until lunch.  It was also the right amount of sweetness. Next time I will try with 1/2 c. fat free yogurt and 1/2c. milk to cut back on calories.

This was very good. Like others suggested I ground the oatmeal first until it was like powder. We don't eat soy in any form so I used unsweetened almond milk. I froze the banana chunks along with the strawberries. I used about 1t of honey in place of the sugar.  I blended everything in my Nutra-Bullet. It came out thick and silky smooth. Will make this again.

good, but did not use sugar, why would you want to put sugar in an otherwise healthy meal? use 1-2 dates instead, or a bit of honey. some blueberries would be yummy as well.

I made the recipe with the substitution of blueberries instead of strawberries because I didn't have any and I really wanted to try this. I omitted the sugar and the vanilla it was perfect for me. I will make this again. Thanks for the recipe!

Instead of making a smoothie that you drink I made this a smoothie bowl with added cinnamon, banana slices, hemp seeds and hearts, fresh strawberry slices, PB2 peanut butter powder and PB2 with chocolate, cacao nibs, and granola. I left out the sugar and vanilla extract and used almond silk!

As it is, this only turned out OK.  I've tried it multiple times following the instructions exactly and didn't like the gritty texture from the oatmeal.  I tried grinding the oatmeal, but that didn't help much.  It wasn’t until I reduced the oatmeal to 1/4 cup instead of 1/2 cup, and cooked the oatmeal in advance as well, that it then turned into a 5 star recipe.

I believe recipes should be rated for what they taste like when made as written.  So although it is the basis for a great recipe, it doesn't taste great if you follow the recipe exactly as written.

Great recipe! I used the light vanilla Silk soy milk and added blueberries and a splash of mango juice and it tastes amazing!

First time making this recipe and it is amazingly delicious! I pureed the oatmeal first and added everything else. I didn't add the white sugar because the vanilla extract was already sweet enough. I added six ice cubes and vanilla yogurt to give it a smoother texture. Also, I used organic 2% milk instead of soymilk. Overall, the results are amazing and it is going to be our family go to smoothie recipe. Thank you for posting this recipe. It is a great weight loss recipe if you replace two meals a day.

I make smoothies often in my NutriBullet, not to loose weight but to eat healthier.. I add a smoothie in between meals to make sure I get in my daily required fruits and vegetables. I've never had oatmeal in a smoothie and thought this would be a great change. This was really good!!!  I made a few changes.  I added kale, vanilla soy milk, and apple juice. I omitted the sugar because the banana and apple juice were enough sweeteners. I tore up a whole leafy kale stem, added sliced bananas, frozen strawberries, 1/3 cup oats, a little vanilla flavor, and filled the cup with 1/2 vanilla soy milk and 1/2 apple juice up to the"Max" line ( I used the large cup serving).  I don't like thick smoothies so I wanted to make sure I had enough liquid to absorb the oats and still have the right consistency. I did taste a little grittiness as some reviewers noted but not enough to bother. The NutriBullet does a great job mixing/chopping/blending fruits, nuts, and vegetables anyway.  Now that I like it next time I'll add flax seeds as one reviewer wrote!

The smoothie isn't what it looks like in the picture, and it's really difficult to make it not chunky. It's a tad bitter, and I thought it would be sweeter. I've had worse smoothies, and I don't mean to give this one a hard time, but it let me down.

Loved the smoothie, but it was a little on the thick side. I'm thinking this is because of the oats though. Otherwise it tastes great, I didn't even put any sugar or vanilla and it was already sweet enough for me. I also added extra soy milk since it was much too thick at first. But the oats make it a healthier and more filling meal for sure.

This is a great change from using protein powder all the time.  I have oats already made into oat flour on hand since I make my own dog biscuits, just put oats into a food processor and work until fine.  This makes it very smooth that way.  I also use coconut or almond milk instead of soy milk. Adding any flavor yogurt or Greek yogurt is also a good idea.

This is a very delicious, filling, and versatile shake.   You could easily substitute any of your favorite frozen fruits (e.g., peach, apricot, berry mix) for the strawberries.

This was good!  I soaked the oatmeal in the milk overnight.  I used coconut milk instead of soy and omitted the sugar.  It turned out very yummy.  I am going to experiment with other types of frozen fruit.  Good, filling breakfast!

It was yummy and filling! I first followed the steps and the original recipe. I did swap out the sugar for the only substitute I had which was Truvia. I added chopped Kale too. It didn't affect the flavor at all. I did follow the suggestions of other reviewers and puréed the oats prior adding the other ingredients. It was smooth and very filling. I was full until lunch time! Will make it as my new go to breakfast. Thanks Astrophe.

Yummy. I added a few extra strawberries and blended the oats first. I also put in a little extra vanilla and sugar. I didn't have soy milk so I put in 2% milk. Will definitely make again!

I've been having this smoothie for breakfast and lunch for 2 weeks. It keeps me full, it's yummy, and I've already lost 7 pounds! I change up the fruit, replacing the strawberries with raspberries or blueberries. I also leave out the vanilla and sugar since I add a container of honey or vanilla Greek yogurt for extra protein. I also use regular milk since I don't tolerate soy well.

I tried this several weeks back, and fell in love with it. I make as a daily breakfast. It fills me up because I am working on getting healthier. I don't even need to use vanilla extract or sugar. I use frozen whole strawberries, and I add a banana and a orange to it, with oats, and almond milk. It's yummy, I recently got a family member wanting to try it out to. :)

Tried this am and is great. Since I don't keep white sugar I used Blue Agave, I also blended Old Fashioned Rolled Oats, after tasting I added the rest of what I do daily, but rated on original with Blue Agave. I added 10 whole almonds, goji berry (already mixed together), 1 tsp cinnamon, normally use honey, but since already used Blue Agave didn't need any sweeter. I will definitely use this again but will cut back to 1/2 banana, honey/cinnamon (helps to lower cholesterol) and will use Almond Milk and no additional almond extract or sugar. Thanks for sharing the recipe Astrophe, a great one to be able to expand on.

easy and delicious recipe.  I took some of the other reviewers' advice and ground the oatmeal in the blender before adding the3 other ingredients.  I also used regular milk instead of soy milk ( I don't tolerate soy well), substituted brown sugar for white sugar, and added a tablespoon of ground flaxseed for extra goodness.  in the future, I will be freezing the bananas and strawberries before hand so I can make this on the go for breakfast.

The taste on this was great!!  I had fresh strawberries, so I made sure to use a frozen banana. I ran the oats through the food processor first, but they were still noticeable in the texture of the smoothie.  That being said, I will definitely make this one again!  My whole family (me, hubby, 1 year old and 3 year old) all enjoyed the flavor (and it feels so fresh and healthy :).

Amaaaazzing!! I substituted the white sugar with either brown sugar or honey, and added chopped almonds to the mixture, simply because I love the extra crunch!! Also I had to grind the oats to powder before adding them in. A delicious and wholesome meal!

Very tasty and filling. A little thick but I used 1% milk instead of soy so that could have been why.  Just splashed a little more milk in it. A wide straw is definitely in order.

Very refreshing and filling.  Perfect for with breakfast.  I blend the oats first for a finer consistency, and then pour in the milk and let it soak for a few minutes.  I use either dairy milk or coconut milk rather than soy milk.

Cook the oatmeal in either water, or Silk first.Solves the "texture issues" people have been mentioning. It's also very good with some real maple syrup splashed in instead of the white granulated sugar. Play around with what you like, this is a good base recipe.

DELICIOUS!!!  I used the other's recommendations for grinding up the oatmeal first.  Then, I realized my strawberries weren't frozen! To thicken it up, I used a half cup of KALE and to make it colder, I threw in a few ice cubes.  I love putting (sneaking) either kale or spinach into our smoothies.  The big guy never notices and I love keeping us healthy!

Overall this is very good. I made a few alterations though. I substituted the soy milk with unsweetened vanilla almond milk (then left out the vanilla extract), and used honey instead of sugar.

I made this as written except I didn't use frozen strawberries and I used regular whole milk instead of soy.  It tasted great and I wouldn't change a thing.  It has everything and makes a great meal.

I used coconut milk, as I don't care for soy, used only 1tsp.sugar. Never had a smoothie with oatmeal, this is a keeper. Thanks for sharing.

Great smoothie! The advice to grind up the oats first worked out well. I froze both the strawberries and banana, and I liked the texture of the oatmeal. I would try making this without sugar next time to be healthier.

I like yogurt instead of the milk and I add a tablespoon of extra virgin coconut oil to make it the ultimate healthy smoothie, yummm!
Thanks for the great idea of adding the oatmeal to a smoothie, who'da thunk? It will keep you full for hours!

used vanilla soy milk, so skipped the additional vanilla. Used a frozen banana as well as the frozen strawberries. Great breakfast!

this was between a 3-4 star for me, the flavor was good but I think pulsing the oats FIRST is a must, otherwise you'll have bits of rolled oats overpowering the texture. I used 2% milk and about a cup and a half of frozen sliced strawberries. Also a small handful of blueberries. Healthy and not bad, just a little chalky!

So tasty and filling!  I used one container of vanilla low fat yogurt (I like Activia) and 1/2 cup 1% milk as I didn't have soy milk.  I used about 1/3 cup oats and I ground the first before adding the rest.

This is a wonderful recipe! I didn't have any strawberries but I did have blueberries. I blended the oats to powder like others suggested. I used 2% milk and for a little mocha taste I used a scoop of my protein powder. It's different with the oats but it definitely gives a full feeling. I don't like eating blueberries but with this recipe I taste more of the banana and mocha. Now I can have my antioxidants in a tasty recipe. Thank you Astrophe!

This is crazy delicious. I made just one serving but kept the whole banana, doubled the vanilla, and omitted the sugar (on a diet). It has no right to be so simple yet taste this good. Perfect to take to work on busy mornings. May add yogurt in future to be more filling.

This was really good. I used 3/4 skim, 1/4 apple juice in place of soy milk and 1 cup frozen mixed berries as I did not have frozen strawberries. I really liked it. My husband didn't like the texture. I was afraid that my kids wouldn't like it, so for theirs I threw in a squeeze of agave and it was a hit.

I've made this smoothie several times and I love it.  I grind the oats up a bit before adding the other ingredients and let it soak in the milk a while (I use almond milk, which is delicious and removes the need to add sugar).  It is lovely and thick and very filling - a perfect quick breakfast on a busy morning.  I have enough for 2 glasses, so I keep on in the refrigerator for the next day.

This really is the perfect smoothie for me. It's not TOO sweet while still satisfying my sweet tooth, very yummy, and suprisingly filling. I never thought to add oats but its really good and adds a nice texture to it :)

This was good and filling!  I added 2 tablespoons ground flaxseed and halved the strawberries and added 1 cup frozen blueberries. Omited the vanilla, since I used vanilla soy milk, and omitted the sugar to be healthier. Very good and will make again!

I love the idea of oatmeal in a smoothie! I always grind the oatmeal in the blender first for a smoother consistency. I also like to add flax seed for some additional nutrients. I like my smoothies to have a thicker consistency so I always add plain yogurt and reduce the milk or just omit it all together and maybe add some fresh juice. I've tried all kinds of fruit in these and they are all delicious. I like to make a big batch and store it in a pitcher in the fridge so that in the mornings I can just pour a tall glass of smoothie for a great on-the-go breakfast!

The taste was good, but the texture and the chalky aftertaste was awful.  We even added some extra juice and fruit, but raw oatmeal is just not something I will ever put in another smoothie.

As another reviewer suggested, I blended the oats first and then I allowed 1 cup of the soy milk to soak for 15 minutes.  I added  1/2 cup of Light-N-Fit vanilla yogurt.  I added a 1/2 cup of frozen berry blend (what I had on hand).  I did not add banana simply because I did not have any on hand.  I also did not add vanilla extract or sugar.  Excellent recipe!!  Thank you.

Good, super quick breakfast smoothie that is very filling (what I like best about it). My family didn't care for it, though, as they prefer yogurt based smoothies - but hey, more for me!

Very, Very filling. I couldn't even finish the first time I tried it so I cut it in half the next. I recommend running the oats through the blender before adding the other ingredients. Also, using fresh strawberries is a good idea... frozen strawberries don't seem to add enough flavor and it turns out a bit bland.

Pretty good, but tastes mostly like the oatmeal instead of strawberries and bananas.  I think I would increase the amount of fruit next time.  I did blend up the oatmeal first like other reviewers mentioned... it would be too grainy if you didn't.  Good basic recipe though!

I haven't tried this specific recipe, but I've made a recipe like this for years. The one suggestion made by another reviewer to blend the oatmeal into a powder before adding the liquid is a really good suggestion. If you don't mind chunks of oatmeal in your smoothie, you can omit that step.

Such an interesting texture. I've never tried a smoothie with oats in it before and I feel like I've missed out. I didn't use any vanilla or sugar and instead added some honey, which I prefer. Also, I used other user's suggestions and pre-blended the oats. Thanks!

I did grind the oatmeal. I have made it a few times adding different frozen berries and fruit. (frozen peaches!!!) I did add 6 oz of vanilla yogurt and omitted the sugar and vanilla. My son is a football player and sknny so I add a pkg of carnation instant breakfast and use nonfat milk instead. Makes it non-vegan. I also have added 6 oz of OJ with calcium. Yum.

This time I made the smoothie with almond milk and a stevia blend. Still delicious! 6/3/2010I love this smoothie!  I ground the oats before adding them to the rest of the ingredients, and I subbed skim milk for the soy.  Delicious and refreshing with a very little bit of texture to it.

Yummy yummy!! Can I give it ten stars? Because that's what I feel it deserves. I followed the advice of many other reviews and blended my oats a little first and I think that made a big difference. I did change a lot of the recipe... in fact pretty much all of it... to fit what I had on hand and my tastes, but the oatmeal idea is genius. It does give it a certain texture and I can see why some people wouldn't like it, but I really enjoyed it. I don't have time for breakfast most mornings and this is so filling and perfect. I used a cup of nonfat plain Greek yogurt, a handful of frozen strawberries, a banana, 1/2 cup of the blended oats, and enough orange juice to make it all blend smoothly. I can't wait to make this again.

Nothing frustrates me more than people who rate a recipe then give an opinion that has nothing to do with the actual recipe, this helps NO ONE!  Anyhoo, moving on....I love the addition of oatmeal to a smoothie!  It definitely makes for a much more stick-to-your-ribs kinda smoothie, perfect for breakfast.  I've also tried it with honey instead of sugar and that was very good too.  This seems to be a very versatile recipe that you could switch up with different fruit, milks or even yogurt.  Thanks!

A pretty good smoothie, even without the banana! Next time I'll make sure to blend the oats before I add the other ingredients so it's a bit more smooth.

This is a fairly good smoothie recipe. I didn't have any soy milk on hand and used skim milk instead. I also substituted white sugar for honey. When I first tried it, I didn't care for it. It didn't seem to have much flavor. So I added a couple handfuls of frozen raspberries to give it more flavor. Once I added the other fruit, I liked it a whole lot better. If I make this again, I'll use juice and keep the sugar out.

Hello all! I was up earlier than usual this AM (considering I am unemployed & do not need to get up early to go to work...), and, after a couple of hrs., the hunger pains set in! I wanted a quick-fix. Michelle's smoothie fit the bill perfectly! And, who would have thought of using oatmeal as a thickener... genius! While I agree w/ some (that this was a tad lacking in flavor - I guess I like my smoothies extra sweet!), it was yummy nonetheless. Since I had planned on making this last wk. (but I never got around to it...), I ended up freezing my fruit for later use. Today, all I had to do was remove what I needed, add the rest of the ing. and voila - a thick, creamy & filling smoothie! My only change was to use vanilla flavored soy milk (whole, skim or ff would also be fine) and omit the extract. I think I will add OJ next time or maybe sub. raspberries for strawberries (I think it's the tang that is missing). A mixed berry combo (i.e. blueberries, strawberries, blackberries, raspberries) would be an excellent sub. too If your store only sells sweetened mixed berries, omit the sugar called for.  Oh, and I think Jeanbean1001's idea to use an instant oatmeal pk. (cinnamon - yum, yum!) is an EXCELLENT idea (I will try this next time!). I will DEFINITELY be serving this at my next brunch AND as a quick  "on the go" pick-me-up on those all to often busy mornings (w/ my noted changes, of course). Thx. for sharing, Michelle :)

Great on-the-go breakfast!  I used regular milk and left out the sugar - quite tasty.  The banana and the oatmeal make for a great slow-burning energy to fuel the morning.  It was very thick - almost needed a spoon - which isn't bad at home, but if I'm running out the door, I need something easier to drink.  May add more milk to thin it up a bit if that's the case.

I'm not vegan, so I used organic skim milk.  Very good.  I followed another reviewer's advice and put the oatmeal in the blender for a bit first.  I also added some chocolate protein powder and used it as a post-race smoothie.

I doubled the recipe and found there were too many oats for my taste...but great idea and this smoothie is tasty and its an easy way to eat healthy! I didn't have any strawberries on hand (boo!) so I just used banana and strawberry yogurt...I bet it will be even better with the strawberries!!

I took the advice of other reviewers and blended the oats into a fine powder first.  I doubled the recipe to make 2 tall glasses.  I also made the following changes, since that's what I had on hand.  I used chocolate soymilk instead of plain, and 1 10oz. bag of frozen peaches, instead of strawberries.  Frozen mangoes also made a good substitute for the strawberries.  I omitted the sugar and vanilla.  This was very good, healthy, and super quick!

This was really good!  I screwed up and added TWO cups of oats.  :)  But it was still VERY good...but I used two percent milk and whole strawberries.  My six year old loved it (and he got his fiber!)

This was an awesome smoothie!  Half of the recipe makes about one smoothie.  Using the full recipe, I used 2 bananas rather than one and used 2 packets Splenda rather than sugar.  You can use strawberries or mixed berries.  The oatmeal I ground in the blender before I put the other ingredients in.  The oats really help to keep the smoothie from separating... it was so tasty!

Really hearty!  I enjoy the oatmeal flavor, so I added a bit more.  Also added some wheat germ to the blender while I was pre-grinding the oatmeal.  Great idea for a super healthy and 'different' breakfast!  Thanks!

This was alright. I used strawberries and a small handful of frozen blueberries. It wasn't very sweet, and my little guy, who normally goes crazy for any shake, wasn't interested in this. We will keep searching for breakfast shakes.

My boyfriend loved this.  I thought it was pretty good, too.  We'll definately make this again.  I ground the oats in a blender as others have.  Thanks!  That was such a great idea and I have incorporated that to another recipe(oatmeal chocolate chip cookies) as well.  They turned out great!  Again, thanks for the idea and the smoothie recipe.  Awesome!

D-E-L-I-C-I-O-U-S!!! I use 1% milk instead of soy, & 2 individual packets of Splenda instead of sugar. Sometimes I use a little more oats. Sometimes I grate the oats in the blender before mixing all of the ingredients for a smoother texture; sometimes I don't. But I do drink this everyday!!! THANKS!

My oldest who is 9 requested that I make this breakfast smoothie today. We are new to smoothie's so I was nervous. Especially, since it has oatmeal in it. 
She LOVED it. She even had seconds. I enjoyed it also. The texture is a little off for me but I have issues with textures. 
KID TESTED, MOTHER APPROVED ;)

Loved it.  I had only a frozen banana and refrigerated strawberries, but that worked fine with the addition of a couple of ice cubes.  I used only half the recommended sugar and it still tasted sweet enough for me.

This smoothie is delicious, I make it all the time!  I sometimes use a frozen banana to make the smoothie colder, and have started substituting the sugar for honey, it makes it so much sweeter!  Sometimes I will also add a handful of blueberries.

The only change I made is I used 1/4 C steel cut oats and dry  blended into a powder before adding everything.  I like it because I don't notice the oatmeal that way!  BTW If you use reg oatmeal then you stick to 1/2 C

My opinion is this delicious smoothie is good without the added sugar. I mean, you get natural sugars from the fruits. Why add more?

You do NOT need to put in extra sugar. The strawberries and bananas are just fine. Adding sugar to this is really pumping up the sugar content. Otherwise a decent smoothie.

I haven't made it yet but was wondering if this was good for people  watching their cholesterol. I am new to cholesterol watching but my son and grandson have both been diagnosed with it so I'm looking for heart healthy smoothies...they like smoothies lol -  I will re-rate it if and when I actually try it out.

I also powered my oats in my Vitamix, used frozen strawberries and a frozen banana. Mine was extremely thick, unpourable. I added more soy milk and substituted Splenda for the sugar. It is very filling and I will make it on those times when I know I will be having a very late lunch.

I made this for breakfast today because I ran out of eggs and needed something to hold up my family up until I went and got groceries later.
I doubled the recipe and ground up steel cut oats first until it was a fine powder. Then I ground up raw almonds until it was also a fine powder. Then I added the low fat milk and the other ingredients, except the vanilla because I was out of that too.   My bananas and strawberries were frozen so I was getting a mixture that was looking like ice cream so I let it sit for a bit. I blended it more until is was more like a smoothie and tried it. I ended up adding more sugar otherwise the kids would not drink it but I thoroughly enjoyed it. I will def make again and add vanilla next time. I used all organic ingredients so I'm sure it's very nutritious and healthy. I will continue to use almonds as well as oats since I think it makes it even more filling and satisfying. Thanks for the recipe!

The recipe was great!!  I don't eat oatmeal and this will probably be the only way it will make it's way into my diet.   Like others suggested, I blended the oats first into a powder before adding the other ingredients.  I also used vanilla almond milk instead of soy.  It was really thick (I think I used too many strawberries), so I added a half a can of peach nectar juice to thin it out and to give it a little bit more sweetness and let me tell you it was DELICIOUS!  It was really filling and held me all the way to lunch.  This will become a regular.

I love this recipe!  Made it yesterday morning and went out last night to get more ingredients to keep making it!  Love the flavor and that the oatmeal makes it "chewy"...in a good way.  I was full all morning till lunch.  I ground the oats first and also used a frozen banana like other reviewers and highly recommend.  I used 1/2 cup milk and 1/2 plain yogurt just to make it thicker.  I imagine this would be yummy as blueberry too.  So glad I found this recipe!  It will be my summer staple.  :)

Masses for breakfast this morning. I didn't freeze my fruit as I like it better with no brain freeze. I used the vanilla but left out the sugar. I will be making again, we thought it was wonderful.

I love this for mornings when I am running late and need a quick breakfast on the go, this will keep me full until lunch time! I make sure to grind the oatmeal into a fine powder before blending with other ingredients, and it gives the smoothie a nice thick texture without taking away from the other flavours. I use vanilla soy milk so the sugar is not needed. Nice to try different berries some days, to shake it up a little! Great recipe.

This recipe is awesome! As a few others have done, I ground the oats to a fine powder first. But then I blended my silk vanilla soy milk with it before adding the fruit. It blended much better this way. I also omitted the vanilla extract because I used the vanilla soy milk. This was very fulfilling it kept me energized right through to lunch time. One thing I will say is if you aren't really an oatmeal person I suggest using a little less than what the recipe calls for because you can really taste the oats, not more than the strawberries and bananas though. Added bonus: this is a great recipe for those who are lactose intolerant.

This was tasty but not a favorite for me.  The banana was very overpowering and the oats were weird in texture.

I didn't like this much when I first tasted it, but it grew on me.  I don't know if I'll make it again.  It was fairly bland (but some people would like that, and I expected it from the ingredients).  The oatmeal didn't grind up very well.  I think the instructions should tell people to blend the oatmeal first and then add the other ingredients.

Fast, easy and tasty! It's a meal in a glass. I used 2% milk in place of soy milk.

I left out the sugar, but this was still plenty sweet. The kids didn't realize that it had oatmeal in it, but I thought it was a bit grainy tasting but not too bad. I blended longer than usual, too. I will make this again, maybe trying that trick from another reviewer about soaking the oatmeal in milk first.

I loved this smoothie and will make it again.  Instead of adding the vanilla I used vanilla soy milk.  I've been trying to eat more oatmeal and was wondering what I would do when the weather got warmer.  Now I have an option.

I use unsweetened vanilla Almond milk instead of soy for my smoothies Great flavor and less calories too!  I also use natural dates (not coated in sugar) instead of sugar as a natural sweetener.  Usually 3 dates chopped will do the trick for a 2 serving smoothie recipe.

This is a good smoothie.  I'm feeling quite yuckie today and this tasty smoothie helped my energy level. Plus the kids who refuse to eat oatmeal raved about it. I followed the recipe except I used brown suger instead of white.

Absolutely love this smoothie! I followed one reviewer's suggestion of blending up the oatmeal to get it really fine before adding the other ingredients, and that helped. Also, I just used regular milk instead of soy, since that was what I has on hand. Delicious and definitely one that I plan to repeat!! :-)

This is one of my favorite smoothies.  I don't use banana because I'm not a huge fan, but I use frozen strawberries, unsweetened vanilla almond milk, and 1 tsp. of truvia.  I also precook my oatmeal so it's got a nice, thick consistency.  I didn't like the texture of the raw oatmeal.  I cook oatmeal for several days with nothing in it, keep it in a covered bowl in the fridge, and use as needed in smoothies.  YUM!

Nixed the sugar and vanilla and replaced with vanilla soy milk, as one reviewer recommended. It's pretty good, but I think it's definitely still in need of a pinch of sugar!

I looked up this recipe for a quick breakfast option this morning but just had to take some time out to rave about it! Very tasty! I make recipes by the book, so I did everything this called for (without the optional sugar) and it tastes so good! I like thinner smoothies, which is why this is only a 4/5, but the taste is one-of-a-kind! I took the advice of other readers and ran the oatmeal through first. I think the vanilla is the ingredient that just pulls it all together!

Im just getting into making smoothies so this was a good easy recipe to start out with. I didnt add vanilla or sugar because i dont like a lot of sweetener. I never would have thought to add oatmeal! Good addition for a breakfast smoothie. I like to add frozen pineapple chunks or frozen blueberries to the mix too, and some oj to help mix it up.

Yum! I love this smoothie. You'll need a really good blender to get a completely smooth drink, but I like the texture of the oats myself so my cheap blender is fine.

For the oatmeal, that I blended first, I used BetterOats Oat Revolution's strawberries & cream with flax seeds. I omitted soy milk (used juice instead), vanilla and sugar. If you don't mind the grittiness you'll love it.

Sooo great! While waiting for our other breakfast to bake - which didn't turn out so well we ended up starving. So we made 2 variations of this: one with frozen pineapple & maple syrup. Amazing! And the other with an cinnamon applesauce cup, which was warmed because I can't have cold things. It was like apple pie if I'd only had the whip cream dollop and sprinkled cinnamon and sugar on the top! Would be great with a side of scrambled eggs for an easy kids breakfast. Thank you!!

Great recipe! I used 1% milk in place of soy as i didn't have any on hand, turned out great! I tried it with different frozen fruits, it was delicious!! Mango and raspberry are great. As others have reccommended I ground the oats before hand. Thanks for the recipe!!

This is an excellent base for many different smoothie combinations.  Definitely need to grind the oatmeal into a fine powder prior to adding other ingredients.  Try adding a handful of spinach to up your intake of greens-- you will not taste it at all.

Yum Yum Yum! I love the texture that the oatmeal adds and the vanilla brings out all the individual flavors. I added a splash of orange juice. Just like other reviewers suggest, grind your oatmeal into powder in the blender and then add the ingredients to that.

This is really a rating on the oatmeal, as I used only soy milk, oats, and mango.  I did blend oatmeal until fine, but maybe not fine enough.  It still was gritty.  I also stuck the soy milk in and blended that next, thinking it would dissolve the oats.  Just not a fan.

I Am not vegan and personally cannot stand the idea of not eating meat.  A lady I have been courting is vegetarian though, so I made this smoothie for her with a few tweaks.  I added some protein powder And a couple of extra dashes of worcheshire sauce.  This bimbo couldn't even taste the sauce!  Now for the good part...I was rewarded handsomely for making her a smoothie and now she said she would like one every time she comes over.   Far be it from me to refuse a lady the protein that gives her the energy to keep up with me...passionately.  Now, for those of you  who are looking for a sure fire way to get your woman in the mood...cook up a batch of cheese sauce and a big ol blender of these tasty, frosty smoothies.  Run and get what you need...now!

This recipe is truly a 5 star recipe!  I omit the bananas just because I don't care for them and used fat free milk instead of soy because that is what I had on hand.  I got my whole family including my 2 year old addicted to these!  They are great for breakfast or just an afternoon snack and are actually really filling!

This is excellent!  I blended the oats first and used mixed frozen berries.  It was very simple and quick to prepare, and it came out very thick.  This is now a staple in my house each morning, as it is the only thing I can keep down (due to morning sickness).  The kids love it too.

Quick, easy, hearty. Although I ground the oats & blended until smooth, it still felt a little chalky.

Instead of milk, I used nonfat plain yogurt and 1/2 cup of juice (white grape since that's what I had at home but apple works fine too) and I omitted the sugar. Was good and kept well overnight in the fridge.

This smoothie is amazing! I never get full and this filled me up! Plus it tastes fantastic! I used frozen strawberries to make it a little thicker! Awesome job!

I have a bullet and made this I could only fit half the recipe at a time. I substituted frozen for fresh and only used 3(remember my recipe was cut in half).  I also used 1 Tbs. raw sugar. Fabulous! I'm thinking maple would be good too...yummy!

Great and filling. I was making it this morning and realized I was out of rolled outs so I threw in a pack of instant "peaches and cream" flavor oatmeal. It added a great thickness and additional flavor!

Great smoothie, I just made one serving and sort of eyeballed ingredients. Instead of sugar I added honey to my desired sweetness. Great to get you oats, fruit, calcium and potassium all in one glass.

This was awesome. The oats add a thickness that almost makes it seem like an icecream shake. Based on other reviews, I did cut down the amount of rolled oats I used in this recipe.

Tasty but a little chalky. I added 1 more teaspoon of sugar and a few more strawberries, and that made it better. It is a good, healthy recipe and a good way to get your oats!

Love this, very filling. I use Vanilla Almond Milk and dont add the sugar or vanilla bc the Almond Milk already has vanilla flavor and is somewhat sweet.

This was yummy! I did tweak it a bit though. Since I drink almond milk b/c it is creamier than soy, I added a cup of that. I think next time Ill try another persons idea and use vanilla flavored almond milk next time like i used to add to my summertime smoothies. The oatmeal was great and grinding it before adding other ingredients was a good tip! I had some ground flax seed and blueberry stuff so I added that and little less of the oatmeal. Next time i hope to have just strawberries on hand. I only had mixed berries, and with the flax seed, oatmeal and berries, it was a little...chunkier than Id prefer, but again my ingredients fault, not the recipe. Reason I gave it 4 stars not 5 was b/c it does call for added sugar which with the soy milk and fruit I didnt feel adding more sugar would be a great breakfast idea to avoid that mid day crash. All in all, great ratio's and a very tasty and quick breakfast. Kept me full for a while.

I've never been much of a fruit fan and it's a struggle to get our youngest to eat it as well.  My entire family really enjoyed this!  We blended the oats first to make sure they were finely ground.  We used regular cow's milk instead of soy.  Definitely use frozen strawberries, as ours were straight from the fridge and the smoothie wasn't cold enough.

Delish! I added kale and substituted the sugar for agave but I don't think it even needs that.  I also added cinnamon and a whole tsp of vanilla. Enjoy!

Awesome taste and definitely more filling than the usual smoothie. I made it with strawberries first, using honey instead of sugar and it was great. Then I made it with frozen blueberries alone and it was still amazing! I didn't have any ripe bananas and never missed them - the smoothie was so good and healthy. :)

This was so good! I'm a big smoothie fan, but I usually find that they aren't filling enough to be a full meal. This one absolutely was. I followed the suggestions of others and blended the oats first, used vanilla soymilk, skipped the vanilla extract and sugar, and swapped out some of the (frozen) strawberries for peaches. This is definitely a keeper. I'm looking forward to trying this with different kinds of fruit!

Wow!  Who would have thought adding oats to a smoothie could make it so rich and creamy!  I even snuck this past my picky eater.  She drank the whole thing without realizing what a healthy thing she was eating.  I used skim milk in place of soy milk and increased the sugar to about 1 T.  It was fabulous!

I made this smoothie this morning! WOW! Best one I've had in a while! Very Filling!

I did what others sugguested and ground the oats in my coffee grinder first, and since I'm allergic to soy, I used 2% milk, and had mixed frozen berries, so I used them in place of just strawberries.  

Very good, and the way I made it, there are 268 calories per serving, so good all the way around!

the only change i made was i used skim milk in1stead of soy. i didn't really like it, it was a little bland and not sweet enough for my tastes. maybe the soy milk would've made it taste better.

I LOVE using raw oatmeal in my smoothies.  I grind up my oatmeal first in the blender really fine.  Then I add crushed ice and vanilla soy milk.  Grind that all together and then add a frozen banana, some plain fat free greek yogurt, some decaffeinated instant coffee granules for flavor, a little bit of honey and blend it up real good.  OH MY GOSH...best smoothie I've ever had.  I have this every morning for breakfast.  So healthy and delish!  Try it, you'll love it.

Even though I ground the oatmeal beforehand there is still a slight (but tolerable) chalky texture to the drink.  I just like the fact that this drink can be a fast, easy and nutritious breakfast for the whole family!  I used milk, and honey instead of soy and sugar because that's what we usually use for our smoothies.  Next time I'll try a mango version!

I found this recipe a few weeks ago and my 10 year-old has asked for it almost every morning since. We use vanilla almond milk so we leave out the sugar and vanilla. Delicious.

This was really good and really easy. I have also substituted frozen berries when I don't have fresh strawberries on hand.

As is the recipe is OK. I was not a fan of the texture when I first made this smoothie, so I put the oats in the food processor first (as others have stated). I used 3/4 cup of soy milk and a 6oz container of fat free vanilla yogurt instead of the extract. I omitted the sugar in part because of the yogurt, but added a drizzle of honey in the end to get the right sweetness. I also felt it was not 2 servings if you want to have it replace your breakfast.

This was very good. I'm not a breakfast person so this fits me very well. I made mine with skim milk, blueberries, oatmeal, vanilla, and a little sugar subsitute. It was very good. Will be having this for breakfast more often.

I like the idea of putting oatmeal in here. It gives it a nice taste. I recommend processing your oatmeal until very fine before adding the rest of your ingredients.

I used 3/4 cup of regular milk and 1/2 cup of vanilla yogurt. I also used 1 1/2 bananas. The yogurt made it sweeter without having to add more sugar. My 4 and 2 year old's LOVED them!!!!

I loved it.  Easy and filling.  The kids didn't since it tasted to much of the oatmeal.  That just means that I won't have to share!

Loved this! I ground up the oatmeal first, as some other reviewers suggested, as well as using whole milk instead of soy milk. The texture was nice and thick, and it was just the right sweetness. My kids even loved it. I can see this becoming a "go to" breakfast on school mornings.

OMG - Love this! I did not make mine vegan as I used low fat strawberry yogurt in mine, but found I didn't need any added sweetner at all other than the fruit.  I used mixed berries as that's what I had.  Can't even taste the oatmeal or banana. I have a new breakfast treat!

Delicious!  I used coconut milk instead of soy milk, and had frozen mixed berries rather than just strawberries.  I also subbed a little bit of stevia in place of the sugar.  Tasted amazing, and was filling, everyone loved it!

Love the nutty taste of the oatmeal.  Forgot the vanilla and sugar - but it doesn't need it.  Next time, i will grind up the oatmeal in my coffee grinder to make it finer.

I never would have thought of putting oatmeal in a smoothie, but the addition made this a nice thick texture as well as more filling.  I loved it, my kids loved it, it's an overall hit at our house!

Very tasty. I used skim milk instead of soy and frozen peaches and melon instead of strawberries. What a wonderful way to get a balanced breakfast with some fiber and complex carbs. Thanks!

I really liked this. I was very surprised the addition of the oatmeal didn't make it gritty. I threw my oats in the blender first though to give them a quick whirl. VERY filling. Five stars based on healthiness, speediness, cheapness & availability of ingredients. Oh, and big ol' manly husband approved- filled him up on the way out the door to move furniture.

This is definetly a stick to your ribs type of smoothie! I did change a few things, I used half a cup of frozen peaches instead of the banana, used 1/2 cup soy milk and 1/2 cup plain greek yogart and omitted the sugar. The consistency takes some getting used too, but this smoothie will keep you full until lunch!

Yummy, nutritious, and filling!  This recipe is very versatile, and i often put ground flaxseed meal or rice bran in mine for added fiber, omega 3, and protein.  However, I recommend grinding up the oats first before putting everything else in the blender.

I used regular milk since we don't have soy.  I also used frozen cherries instead of a banana because I don't like them.  It wasn't all that sweet w/o the banana.  At first I didn't think I'd like it (not being very sweet) but it definitely grew on me.  My daughter liked it as is but my picky son added honey.

I've been looking for a good breakfast-on-the-go option for my kids and I and I think I've found it!  I also added a tablespoon of flax meal and used vanilla almond milk instead of the soy.  Turned out great.

Super clever adding oatmeal to the smoothie! It was delicious! The texture isn't like most smoothies but I don't mind it (I blend before adding anything else) and I know it's going to be healthier and much more filling. Very versitile...I think the 14 strawberries equal out to be about 1-1 1/2 C. frozen fruits.

such a great idea! i agree that the strawberries or the banana need to be frozen for the right thickness, unless you want something more like a juice. i added a squirt of agave nectar and used plain rice milk, and didn't need any extra sugar

I make something like this every morning, and it's great. I grind the oatmeal in the blender first, with some flax seeds for extra nutrition. I generally use orange juice, not soy milk. Great breakfast.

Sorry but I just don't like the oats in there.  It wasn't the texture.  I tend to give a little whir to anything frozen first, then add other stuff and add only enough milk at a time to be able to blend, so that everything gets blended as smoothly as possible.  (Don't like ending up with 'pulp'.)  So the oats just blended fine with everything else.  Granted it was more filling than some smoothies but I didn't like the taste of the oats in there.  It wasn't bad - just not great.  I've actually made it several times trying to play with it (but still mostly sticking to the recipe), like I've used both fresh & frozen, and 1% milk and nonfat dry milk (don't have soy).  I also reduced the oats by half and it still tasted too much like oats.  (And I'm sorry, but adding things like blueberries would so incredibly change the taste that it wouldn't be this recipe anymore.)

Very fullfilling for breakfast or as a snack. Don't leave leftovers since it will no longer be drinkable!  works perfectly with no vanilla and regular low fat milk.

LOVE IT!  Perfect breakfast (or anytime) smoothie.  I keep all my fruit (even my bananas) frozen.  The texture of the smoothie was really perfect.  I also used honey in place of white sugar.

Big hit at my house!! All the kids aged 14, 9, 8, 4, 4, 2 1/2 LOVED it! I love how it has the oatmeal to make it more filling. I made a couple changes to suit us. I didn't add the Vanilla or sugar because I used Vanilla flavoured Soy Milk, and I ground the oatmeal up first to make it less chunky.  Other then that it was AWESOME! I will be making these again for sure for a great before school breakfast!  I may even throw in some protien powder for my husband when he has it later! :)

Yum!  This made a great breakfast.  My banana was also frozen so it was very thick.  I had to thin it so I used 1/4 cup orange juice.  I will make this a lot!

I only had a seven grain oatmeal, so I think that the texture was a little grainy because of the sunflower seeds, but otherwise a very filling and yummy smoothie!

I think this smoothie is FABulous!  I substituted whole milk for the soy milk, and blue agave nectar for the sugar...and also ground up the oats before adding the other ingredients.  This is a new family favorite for sure!

Great idea using oats. It was delicious. I subbed orange juice for the soy milk and added a little vanilla yogurt and my son drank a huge glass. Very filling!

I was a little nervous about how this would taste with the oats but it was really amazing. I halve the recipe and it is just enough to fit in my travel mug and take to work. I grind the oats up first like everyone else, and I have also been using Chocolate soy milk.

I'm not vegan or even vegetarian, but I now add oatmeal to all of my smoothies.  I grind it in the blender first as I prefer a finer texture, then add the juices or milks (otherwise the oatmeal doesn't mix nicely w/ the fruits), then the fruits.  If you have a strong sweet tooth, try making this with sherbet!

This was pretty good, but I do prefer yogurt smoothies - used this recipe because I was out of yogurt.  I switched my frozen fruit, using a frozen banana and fresh strawberries, as well as a few blueberries, cherries, grapes and a piece or two of pineapple (using up some fruit salad!) and I didn't need to add any sweetener at all.  I really did like the use of oatmeal - I actually had some ground outs on hand (I use the "oat flour" in a lot of my baking), but still, without the yogurt I felt something was missing.

What a life saver. This is a great after school snack. My kids don't asks for more food till dinner time. They are all filled up and the oatmeal makes it last with them. We add frozen banana, 1% milk (if I have no soy) and 1 large Tbsp of peanut butter. Thanks for such a great healthy meal in a cup.

I'm not a health nut or vegan but I am trying to eat healthier and looking for recipes which I can transition. Outside of the powdery consistency of the oatmeal, I found this to be quite good. I will make it again and hope my taste buds will adjust to the oatmeal, as I know it is good for me:). I did eliminate the white sugar as I found it was sweet enough without it. I haven't quite made the soy milk transition and did use 2% milk.

Delicious and easy. 
I used milk and did not add the optional vanilla and sugar (it was sweet enough without). I used a hand blender in a large measuring cup, so clean up was a snap. This kept me going all morning.

This was an excellent recipe, a good combination of ingredients.  I would recommend adding a 1/2 cup of frozen spinach or 1 big handful of fresh to give it a major power boost.  YUMMY!

Don't leave out the sugar entirely, otherwise the oat taste pops out. As suggested I also powdered the oatmeal some before putting the rest of the ingredients in. I also added a few cubes of ice, it was still thick enough for me. Great that I can have this for breakfast and still feel i'm getting nutrition/fiber not just having fun :) plus just fruit is never filling.

I used frozen mixed berries, of blueberry, raspberry, and lingonberry.  It's just what I had on hand in the freezer.  I plan to make this again, but next time I will put it through a sieve to get all those little seeds out!  But the taste was great, and it had a nice consistency.  My hubby and I are always trying to get more oatmeal in our diet, so this was a perfect cold drink for us!

This was really good, except I used regular milk instead of soy milk and blueberries instead of strawberries, since that's what I had.  Flavors nice, but the blueberry skins wouldn't grind up.  I also added a shot of orange juice, which added a little sourness to the sweetness of the banana and blueberries.

Awesome! This drink is so good, and a good source of energy in the morning. I added nonfat plain yogurt, and used soy vanilla milk. I also used splenda. This will be made often.

...a little on the gritty side, even if you grind the oatmeal first.

I didn't even use any sugar or vanilla and also used skim milk instead of soy.  Also added 2 Tbs wheat germ.  LOVED IT!  So did my kids.  BIG HIT.

I drink a lot of smoothies and I never thought to add oatmeal or vanilla, so for giving me a healthy new way to make smoothies I give this five stars!! I like honey instead of sugar, and like to add some plain yogurt to my smoothies to get the added benefit of yogurt. Thank you for the new recipe - this can so easily be adapted (different fruits, milk instead of soy milk, add yogurt, etc.) I will make many variations of this!
P.S. A very healthy addition to any smoothie is 1-2 teaspoons of ground flax seed - found at Trader Joe's or health food stores.

I loved the recipe the only thing is I liked the recipe 10X better with regular or even 2% milk (I'm not a vegan)I also added other fruit such as blue berries and sometimes peaches. I found that frozen works/lasts better than fresh, so I brought different bags of frozen fruits and for the banana I simply sliced them up and froze them in a ziploc bag. This recipe is a great outline but there are a lot of possibilities with it. Overall with my changes a great recipe.

Yum!  I'm enjoying one right now for lunch.  I used other suggestions and used a bit less than half a cup of oatmeal, ground it, and added flax, too.  It's a keeper!

This smoothie was awesome! I omitted the banana because I didn't have one that was ripe, but it was still very, very good. I also only used a heaping 1/4 cup of oats and it turned out nice and thick. The smoothie was delicious, very filling, and I highly recommend this recipe!

This was very good but I did not care for the raw oatmeal.  I will put less in next time.  I also substituted honey for the sugar and added a teaspoon of wheat germ for extra nutrition.

I used skim milk, fresh strawberries, and left out the sugar. I think next time I will add fresh pineapple and less strawberries. My strawberries seemed to be more tart than sweet, so pineapple would really do this recipe some justice in my case. I really like the oatmeal in the smoothie. Thanks for the recipe!

This is great - I used the Vanilla soy milk, did not grind the oats, my blender an old Osteriser must have grinded them while I was blending it all together as I didn't find the smoothie to be gritty at all.  I did NOT add vanill  OR sugar, I did add a TB of honey and a 1/4 cup of orange juice to make it a ting less thinner.  YUMMY.

I substituted Carb Countdown 2% milk for the soy milk, omitted the sugar and vanilla and added 1 tsp honey instead.  I also used 1/2 frozen strawberries and 1/2 frozen peaches and ground the oatmeal first.  My husband & I really liked this recipe, and will have this in the AM when time is short.  Very filling, and I can see experimenting with the fruit and liquid.

Really enjoyed this smoothie!  Used less oatmeal than was called for and ground it up first, as others suggested.  Used regular milk since I do not like the taste of soy.  This would be great with any combination of fruit!  Thanks for the great recipe and for the great suggestions!

This smoothie is delicous and very healthy!! I made half of the recipe because I was just wanted one serving but I still had some left over!!I did make the mistake to freeze big strawberries without slicing them into smaller pieces so when I was blending they were very hard to break!! This is keeper!!

I loved this smoothie! I was looking for something that would be quick and healthy for breakfast and to fill up my pregnant belly without overloading on calories. This was perfect. I used a frozen banana and 6 huge strawberries rather than what the recipe called for, and used a whole tsp of vanilla rather than half. Perfect!

Great!  My mom and I are allergic to bananas, so I substituted kiwi for it, and added a little extra sugar.  My mom thought it was too bitter (she really does not drink smoothies), but liked it ok with yet more sugar added.  My dad and I (big smoothie drinkers) thought it was great.  Just don't add too much oatmeal!  It tastes really funny when you do.

This shake is really tasty! I used regular milk instead of soy. I didn't have any bananas on hand so I added a dash of banana extract for taste. I used frozen strawberries with added sugar and the result was excellent! The oatmeal was really filling. I will be making this a breakfast regular!

Substituted sugar with honey, used fresh instead of frozen and was enough to make two large (~20oz) glasses of smoothie!
Essential base to making smoothies, love the inclusion of oatmeal, certainly makes it a ‘hardier’ breakfast item.

Not enthusiastic about this recipe.Maybe it was the oatmeal.  Perhaps adding other ingredients and removing the sugar would improve it. I'm glad others enjoy it. That said, it's not for me.

Excellent! I made as per recipe except for using regular milk instead of soy, and I skipped the sugar. I did preblend the oats which gave it a nice texture. Great way to drink a healthy breakfast!!

It tastes really nice but is really thick in volume. If it wasn't for the extreme amount of thickness then it would be a 5/5.

I halved all ingredients because I just wanted to make one smoothie for me.  I did as other reviewers suggested & blended the oatmeal before adding the other ingredients to break them up.  Once you do that, nobody can tell that oatmeal is in the drink.  I did not have rolled oats so used old fashioned oats.  My smoothie came out very thick, I had to add more soymilk to make it drinkable, maybe because my strawberries were big.  It was good, I probably will make again.

This recipe worked as a great base for me. I didn’t have strawberries, so I used blueberries, and I don’t drink soy milk so I used coconut, other than that the first time I made it I did it pretty in line with the recipe, the second I took out the banana and added 1TBS of cocoa powder. I also halved the recipe the second time since it makes enough for two smoothies.

I enjoyed the smoothie, but was not used to the texture the oatmeal added.I reduced the amount of sweetener (sugar) and substituted agave for the sugar. Iwill definitely have it again.

I did not want to drink alcohol this 24th and with this smoothie I am happy I didn't buy rum and whiskey. Is so amazing, the only change I did was that I could not add ice to it but it still is amazing.

This is yummy and easy to make. I first ground up the oatmeal as others suggested. I didn't have any strawberries so used a fresh Okanagan Peach with the frozen banana! 1/2 cup of coconut milk and 1/2 cup vanilla greek yogurt. 
Delicious!
Thank you!

I doubled the recipe and made this with sweetened coconut milk because that's what I had on hand, so I omitted the sugar and vanilla.  After tasting, I added a pint of blueberries and half a pint of raspberries, and 1/2 cup frozen pineapple.  I also added 2-3 tsp of honey.  It was absolutely delicious and very filling.  Definitely a meal replacement.  Kids loved it!  Will make this again for sure.

I made this smoothie by grinding the oatmeal first, as had been suggested. It did improve the smoothie, however, I was not a fan of the grainy texture. I also didn’t add sugar. Overall, this smoothie was delicious, healthy, easy, and filling, with only the one minor bad point.

I really like this recipe! My 7yo son liked it too! Although, I used Almond milk (unsweetened) and I ended up adding more almond milk to the recipe (about a 1/4 cup) and I think I would add a tad more sugar and vanilla next go round! I will make this again!

This is the first smoothie I've ever made and it was good.  I used fresh strawberries and almond milk.  Since I don't like drinks too cold, that worked out well.  The oatmeal was just fine uncooked.

Used fresh strawberries instead of frozen ones and skim milk instead of soy milk.  The flavor of the oatmeal was a bit overwhelming, but the texture was fine.

This is now one of my two favorite breakfast smoothies! It's a fast and easy recipe, and exceptionally filling.  I followed the recipe, but substituted almond milk for the soy, and a few drops of liquid stevia in place of the sugar.  Amazing!

I've been doing this for years, but I never use sugar. I use mangos or pineapples also and organic natural apple juice. I also use coconut milk instead of soy, and a little flax seed powder. mmmmm!

Delicious! I also ground the oats into a fine powder and omitted the sugar and Vanilla since I used Vanilla Almond-Coconut milk in the recipe. The Bananas and Strawberries were sweet enough. The only small change that I did make was to add cinnamon to the mix, made it even yummier.

I left out the sugar because I didn't have soymilk and substituted vanilla almond milk instead - the nuttiness of the milk actually brought out a little bit of the oatmeal taste and made it really taste like a legit breakfast smoothie, totally filling.

Loved it and very filling.  I was excited to try it so I just used what berries I had in the freezer,  just some mixed berries.  Then second time that day I used just blueberries.  Both times they came out delicious and since I used vanilla soy milk there was no need to add sugar which works perfect for my diet right now.

I was so disappointed with this recipe! I had to throw it out. The flavor was okay but there was a starchy flavor that was noticeable. Also, the oatmeal ended up in tiny chunks which was horrible! I even tried to strain the oatmeal out so I could at least drink it. Maybe make this recipe only if you have a great blender? I do not.

Made this with frozen banana, fresh strawberries, and coconut milk. Tasted good, kind of like strawberries & cream instant oatmeal. It's not something I'd crave, but it's definitely a good quick, filling breakfast.

Definitely needed more strawberries imo. Its good, it's not great, and I'll have to modify it next time. But there will be a next time and it's plenty filling and should be good for when I hit the snooze one too many times before class. Didn't use the sugar and thought it was sweet enough, but just a little too bland as is.

Yummy! I used 10 strawberries instead of 14 because some of them were large. I also used 3 small bananas because I really love bananas. I also replaced the sugar with a little non-dairy hazelnut coffee creamer. Perfection!

I used a frozen banana because I like smoothies really cold. I used 10 strawberries, quick oats and unsweetened vanilla almond milk. I blended it A LOT because I didn't want oat pulp. It was really good!

I followed the recipe with the exception of using skim milk.  Since I was the only one drinking it, I decided to try using what was left to make smoothie pops.  They are in the freezer now, hoping they turn out!

A cool, fantastic summer alternative to a hot bowl of oatmeal.  Loved it!  I did use Honey, instead of the sugar, a smooth flavour.  I also used half the required Strawberries and topped it up with frozen Raspberries.  A quick, easy breakfast smoothie.   (Feels like I am cheating on my diet, but I'm not)

Delicious, quick and healthy smoothie! My 3 kids, 12 yr old nephew and 2 yr old granddaughter loved it and even asked for seconds! I made a few minor changes, however. I used about 1/4 cup 2% Fairlife milk along w/1/4 cup vanilla yogurt. I also used "Kind" brand vanilla blueberry clusters with flax seeds in place of oatmeal. Will be making this again. Thanks for sharing!

This is a filling smoothie! I subbed almond milk instead of soy, omitted the banana (not a banana lover!) and subbed honey for the sugar. I ground the oats in the blender first as recommended by many. I also added 1/4 cup plain yogurt. The result was delicious and thick. I could feel the texture of the oats, but it didn't bother me. Will make again!

Okay I did make changes but I have to say how amazing this is! I used cow milk in place of the almond milk and a mixed berry blend in place of the strawberries. I blended the oats with the  milk first to get the oats all blended (my blender won't blend just a half a cup of anything), then added the rest of the ingredients. It does taste like flavored oatmeal but so much better. It's such a fun variation on my normal smoothie and I will definitely be making it again!

Excellent. The oatmeal does make it very filling but I love that it is easy to make & supresses my hunger for hours.

Made this with my stepdaughter for Mothers day to go with a mini omelet. We added one table spoon of Stevia for a recipe that made three 8 oz. glasses. We will be making this again.

Used vanilla flaxseed milk so I omitted the sugar and vanilla.  Was pleasantly surprised by the texture--so much better than yogurt smoothies.  I'll be adding this to my morning routine.  Thanks for a great and easy AM recipe!

Great smoothie! I use half unsweetened vanilla almond milk and half skim milk. I leave out the sugar because the fruit is sweet enough.

I made exactly as the recipe stated. It was ok. My daughter seemed to like it, and I'll probably make it again for her. I just didn't care for the taste. Felt like I was missing something.

Very filling, even my 2 year old loved it. Next time I will blend oats first because it was a little grainy. I used 2% milk instead of soy.

I made as the recipe calls but found the texture unpleasant.  So instead of using raw oats the night before I put the oats in a bowl with a little almond milk and heated for 1 min.  put in fridge and used the next morning and it was great.  The texture was perfect.  Thick and creamy.  Yum!

Good flavor.  I wanted to find a smoothie that did not use yogurt and this works well.  I make it for the nutrition rather than the flavor.  It is a tad grainy from the oats, but the nutritional benefit and satiety it provides is worth it.  I like that it doesn't have the extra calories from yogurt as well.

I made this recipe as written except I left out the sugar, and it came out really good! As someone suggested, I mixed the oats first, creating something like an oat flour before I started mixing everything else. I thought about adding yogurt to it, but when I saw how thick the mixture was, it was very filling and satisfying! I will definitely make this again. In case anyone is wondering, I used a Nutribullet blender. It's a lot easier to clean than a traditional blender.

Really good! Bananas made it creamy but didn't overpower. I followed the suggestion to decrease the oats to 1/4 c. I also added chia seed and garnished with frozen blueberries for eye candy! Yum.

I love strawberries, I love oatmeal, I love banana's and often make hot oatmeal with vanilla, almond milk, strawberries and banana. However, mixed as a cold smoothie I'm not digging too much. I actually processed the oatmeal into a fine powder and then used and somehow it still came out grainy. The oatmeal flavor is overpowering the banana and strawberries which says a lot since this calls for so many strawberries. If I were to make again I think I am going to knock the amount of oatmeal down considerably and possibly add a little more strawberries and a second banana. As it's written I don't really care for it and wouldn't make it again. With my moderations it might be bearable. On a side note if you use normal almond milk you shouldn't need sugar as it might come out being too sugary, if using unsweetened almond milk definitely add the sugar because it might come out bitter depending on how sweet your fruit is.

Really delicious. Next time I would soak the oats in the milk for a while first to soften them more. Riper bananas would also give better flavour. Filling and yummy!!

Good.  Frozen strawberries gave it a nice thick texture with no need for ice.  I used 2 packs of Stevia instead of sugar.  Next time I'll use quick cooking oats instead of rolled oats.  It's cool, refreshing, healthy and filling.

very good - Oatmeal fills tummie :-)
Slight variation: 
Strawberries - less than recipe & added blueberries....
1 bannana is too sweet for me in smoothies, used 1/4 . Used Silk Almond Milk. 
I didn't have frozen fruit, mixed all in machine...next added ice...mixed again.  Used Ninja machine.
Thank you ------ for the Recipe & All the different variations.


P.S. omitted sugar & vanilla

This smoothie recipe is so delicious! I used only 1 teaspoon of sugar instead of 1 1/2 and used 1% milk instead of soy. I make fruit smoothies regularly, usually using only fruit and greens but I will definitely be making this one on a regular basis now! It wasn't too sugar-y and had a really nice, thick texture from the oats. So delicious!

This was pretty good and tasty, but both hubby and me thought it was a bit chunky. I soaked the oats in milk overnight like one reviewers suggestion, but I don't think that helped any. Maybe the pre-blitz that another reviewer suggested would work, so I'll probably try that next time.

I really enjoyed this smoothie. I did make a few changes based on what I had available. I used cashew milk and mixed frozen fruit. Like other reviews I ground the oatmeal before adding other ingredients. I also added flax seed flour and only used a teaspoon of sugar. Next time I will skip the sugar. I think it will be plenty sweet without it and healthier also.

I used unsweetened almond milk instead, i'm not sure the sugar is necessary.  be sure to let the oats soak for a while before blending otherwise you'll be left with nasty bits

I made this for the first time this morning and it was absolutely delicious. I used almond milk and I added a scoop of chocolate protein powder. I didn't need to add sugar at all! I loved the fact that you could put rolled oats in it...it was great!!

Delicious! I was out of bananas so I used one small orange and one kiwi to replace it. I also had quick cooking Irish oats and vanilla soy milk and no sugar.

Turned out great!! My fussy son who's 5 hates smoothies, but he loved this one! I blended the oatmeal first before adding other ingredients. I also added a 1/2 cup of organic vanilla yogurt along with the vanilla and sugar because we just had organic milk on hand.

I used frozen blackberries instead of strawberries and whole milk instead of soy and a frozen banana. It wasn't very sweet but it was very thick. I like the idea of the oats.

Love this in the summer when I don't want hot oatmeal. I can't eat bananas so usually substitute with peaches or mango. Also use almond milk instead of soy milk &  no sugar as trying to cut back.  So easy &  filling, love the pretty pink color too!

Really delicious and filling for breakfast. I put the oatmeal in first and ground it up before adding the other ingredients. Swapped almond milk out for soy. Didn't need to add the sugar or vanilla, it was sweet enough with all the other ingredients. This only take a couple of minutes to make, so perfect in a rush. It's really only one serving though.

I didn't have strawberries so I used 1 1/2 frozen blueberries.  I also used old fashioned oats and the smoothie had a bit of grittiness to it (even though I used a Vitamix).  I will try with quick cook oats next time to see if that makes a difference.  All considered, it was excellent!  Amazing purple color with the blueberries!

I used rice milk, frozen banana (banana should be super ripe, they're much sweeter and you can skip the white sugar). No vanilla, or sugar.  I blended the oats first. Between the strawberry seeds and oatmeal. It was a bit grainy. But quite good.

This recipe is amazingly versatile! I love adding some extra oatmeal and blending it all together - it's great with bananas, almonds, chocolate, apple... I've tried so many different combinations. A great smoothie recipe to put on the list for a quick, easy snack or breakfast.

All I had was old fashioned oats, so I put them in the blender first and powdered them.  I used a little bit of honey instead of the sugar.  Overall, it was OK.  A little too much oatmeal flavor.

Love it! The only thing I changed is skim milk instead of soy because thats what I had on hand. Delicious! Makes 2 full servings and because of the oats its a really nice thick texture! Put the oats in the blender first at the bottom so that they are ground up better so you don't get chunks.

I soaked the oats in soy milk overnight (a tip from another reviewer) which I like, I don't like the grit of uncooked oatmeal.  Also I halved the recipe, and 7 frozen strawberries is way too much.  It turned the smoothie into more of a sorbet.  I used 3 and that was perfect.

I just made this recipe for the first time. The only thing I changed is the milk. I used almond milk instead.  My oatmeal blended perfectly using my smoothly blended.  Next time I will use a little honey instead of the sugar.  I love the taste that honey adds.  I also would like to try it with kefir instead of almond milk.

I loved it! it was very filling, and delicious!! I just used 1% milk ( in place of soy milk) and frozen strawberry jam ( in place of  frozen strawberrys and sugar.) also I didn't have a banana so I didn't put that in. but it still turned out great!

This is a great recipe! I used it for my breakfast the first time today and it's so filling and slightly energizing! I added more oats to mine (probably a total of 3/4s cup). I also substitued raw brown sugar in place of the white. Again, this is a great smoothy and I will be making it again! Thanks for the great recipe!

My oats turned out as almost jagged additions in my smoothie, because I used extra thick oats. I love the idea though so will try again.

Yummy! Left out the sugar and just used vanilla as recommend by others. Ground the oatmeal first and used lactose fat free milk because that's what I had in hand. Will definitely make this again! Thank you for another enjoyable recipe ;)

Used almond milk instead of soy and used waaaay more than the recipe called for.  Didn't include the sugar and I thought it was fine, though my 7 year old daughter wasn't crazy about it.  She said she thought it "tasted like dough."  I would make again though may add more strawberries and include the sugar if making for my daughter.

It's taste pretty good but I am detecting a hint of pepto bismol at the end. I didn't want to add extra sugar and I didn't have vanilla extract so I used Vanilla Almond Milk. Maybe these substitutions made a significant difference

I used regular milk instead of soy milk...I also used stevia instead of regular sugar.  The consistency was very thick so I added an extra cup of milk.  It was still thick but oh so good!  My 10 year old even enjoyed it!

I've been having this for breakfast every morning these past two weeks. Used 1/4 c oatmeal, 1/2 c frozen organic berries, half a banana (you can freeze them by the way!), a tsp of chia seeds, and 1 cup unsweetened  original almond milk. The bananas take care of the sweetness for me, so no need for sugar. Changed it up to lessen the calories. And it keeps me full for about 2 1/2 hours....easy morning routine! Thanks!

I think it's a must to use a coffee grinder to grind the oatmeal into powder first. I even ground quinoa but that has too much of a strong flavour. Also added ground almond powder. Yum.

Great for breakfast! Very filling! I substituted frozen strawberries for regular ones, but I froze a banana to use. Almond milk goes well with it,too. I cut a strawberry in half and stuck that on the glass for a fancy look.

This was great! I actually like the chewy texture of the oatmeal, but my 4 year old did not, so next time will take other's suggestions about grinding the oatmeal to a fine powder first. Did not use vanilla extract since I was serving it to my 2 and 4 year old, but still tasted great! We added a little stevia to it, and a little more milk for a slightly thinner texture. This was an awesome smoothie and will make this a lot!

Great smoothie.  Like most other folks I grind the oats first. Other great thing about this recipe is that you can use your imagination and substitute many other types of fruit for a variety.  I also add other items to increase the amount of protein to really fill me up in the morning before starting work.  I do leave out the vanilla extract and sugar,  the fruit adds enough sweetness. I make this for my 4 year old son and he loves it before we go out to do farm chores.

Way to thick and creamy but overall okay.  I'm not much of a smoothie person but I needed to use my fruits and had to replace a meal.  I used quick cooking oats and also microwaved it with the milk for a minute then chilled.  I'm weird I know!

This is a great recipe. I double the recipe and my kids and I have been having this at breakfast. They love it! It's a great breakfast for me while I commute. I do grind the oatmeal first and have been experimenting with other frozen fruits and that worked well. I did use skim milk as I didn't have soy milk.

This became a regular for us. Love it.  Thank for sharing this recipe.

Like one of the other reviews, I find it better to grate the oats first, then all of the next steps.  I always leave out the sugar.  The banana is enough.

shredded the oatmeal first like everyone suggested and it really worked great. I like this smoothie because the oatmeal ads a surprisingly nice touch to it and its not OVERLY sweet (just the right amount) I will be making this a few times a week.

This was pretty good. I ground the oats to a fine powder in my food processor. It's pretty filling, but for me it was just one serving. I did not add the vanilla or the sugar and it was sweet enough. Thanks!

Great basic recipe. I used strawberry kefir and a mix of frozen fruit. Ground up the oatmeal first and then let it sit a while in the liquid before adding the frozen fruit. Kids loved it. Left overs always get made into Popsicles. :)

This is so delicious and so filling. I make it for breakfast all the time now. My two year old usually ends up stealing half of it. I agree with other comments that you need to grind up the oats first, and I always use frozen strawberries to give it a thicker texture. I like to add just a splash of orange juice to give it a little tang and it's fantastic!

I LOVE strawberry-banana smoothies, but I could never get the right proportions when making it at home.  These are the right proportions.  Like everyone else, I blend the oats first to get them to a powdery consistency.  I find it plenty sweet on its own, and don't use the sugar or vanilla extract (I did at first).  The recipe is for 2 servings, but I'm the only one drinking it so I cut it in half.  I use about 2/3 of a banana for each serving, and I freeze them in individual portions so I don't always have to keep bananas on hand.  BUT they MUST be defrosted when you're blending, otherwise it will take forever.  Usually I defrost them overnight, or for a few hours in the morning.  They don't look too appealing when defrosted but I freeze them when they're ripe and they're going in a smoothie anyway, so who cares.  I buy a big bag of frozen strawberries from the store and find it to be way less work than freezing my own.  Great recipe!

Perfect!

It is also the first time I've ever added oatmeal to a smoothie (going to be a regular addition instead of yogurt)!  The neatest part about this recipe is its flexibility.  I have made it as directed = delicious.  I've added other things like spinach and swapped fruits to use mango vs strawberries = delicious.  I have made some version of this daily for the last week....love it!

I love the oatmeal flavor in this smoothie, I add cinnamon to really enhance the "oatmeal for breakfast theme". I also add vanilla protein powder to make a real meal out of it, and typically use almond milk instead of soy ( And honey instead of sugar)

I added organic almond milk instead of Soy as I don't use soy products and I skipped the sugar in favour of honey. I found it a bit 'heavy,' maybe too much oatmeal. I'll try less later.

It was good, but 1/2 C of rolled oats is way too much for me. I pre-grinded them like most other reviews, but there was still definitely a grainy trace after each swallow. Maybe reduce rolled oats to 1/4 C and it'll be fine!

I liked this recipe but I used juice instead of milk because I'm not a fan. I saw that some people thought that the raw oatmeal taste was off-putting so I blended the oatmeal into almost a powder before adding the other ingredients into the blended and it blended perfectly and the flavor of the oatmeal flavor was very subtle that way.

Wow! I never used oats in a smoothie before, so it was definitely a different taste than I'm used to, but very good. It was a lot more filling than my typical smoothie. I took the advice of another reviewer and grinded the oats in my blender first. I also had to add a bit more milk because the smoothie was a bit thick. Overall, it was a delicious smoothie that I'll definitely be adding to my rotation!

Let me start by saying I altered the recipe in 2 ways: I used fresh, not frozen strawberries and also I did not have soy milk so I used almond milk.

I didn't like this. The oat flavor was very prominent. The consistency was very runny but that was probably due to the strawberries being fresh and not frozen. Overall, the taste was a little bland.

Very nice and easy. Per other reviews I put the oats in first to ground them up real good. Instead of sugar I used a cinnamon honey and I also used unsweetened vanilla almond milk as I don't do soy. It makes enough for 2 shakes mine made 32oz. I also used a few more strawberries to use up what I had in the freezer. so if it's an individual serving I would maybe scale back on ingredients. Over all winner in my book will definitely make it again!! Found this on Pinterest.. gotta love that site!!

I had to adjust the recipe for one serving and use lactade milk instead because I don't like soy. It was quite good, really thick, and very filing. Loved it!!

I never would have thought this would be so good.  I used lactose free milk instead of soy milk.  I used blueberries instead of strawberries. I used just a little less than 1/2 cup slow cooking oatmeal.  And I blended the oatmeal first before adding the other ingredients.  I did not add sugar nor vanilla. I added 1 pack of splenda. Very tasty.

Great breakfast smoothie! I blended the oats first (as suggested by other reviewers). I also found that it is better if you have time to let it sit for about an hour or two after that- the oats soften more so you don't notice them as much. I use a single serving blender and adjust the liquids and berries and such to make it fit in my cup. Great way to have a fast, filling, healthy breakfast on the go!

A little grainy. I don't like smoothies with banana because they overpower the other fruit but this was perfect!!! Had a good strawberry flavor and was very filling.

I too pulverized the oats first as brilliantly suggested by others.   I had many more bananas to use up so I needed to add some more milk--I used Almond milk instead of soy. Also I needed a splash of lemon juice and a tsp of cinnamon.   I also omitted the white sugar.

Pretty tasty. :) I love the idea of putting oatmeal in it. I used 1/3 of a cup of old fashioned (preblended) oats instead. Skipped the banana and added half a scoop of strawberry whey protein, some drops of vanilla, and a packet of no calorie sweetener . . . along with the cup of milk and 5 frozen whole strawberries.

Instead of using vanilla extract I used a scoop of vanilla whey protein. I usually add it to all my smoothies, works great!

This is great for a quick breakfast when you don't have time to make something big. After reading some reviews, I decided to grind the oats in my blender to a powder before adding in the other ingredients. Also, I didn't have any strawberries or bananas and I don't usually freeze fruits so I used a couple of peaches and it turned out fine. I really like the idea of adding oats; it gives the smoothie a nice texture and fills my stomach. ??

I was looking for a filling smoothie recipe, and here it is! As per other reviewers, I dumped the oatmeal in the blender first and gave it a few quick pulses to break it up. I didn't have soy milk, but I had a tub of vanilla yogurt, so I used that instead, skipping the extract and sugar.  It's a hit with everyone in the house!

I did as Sarah Jo and ground my oats before adding the other ingredients.  I used nonfat milk and frozen fruit, which gave it a wonderful texture.  Definitely needs the vanilla extract and a little sugar.  My only issue is the calorie content.  Don't know if the nonfat milk makes a difference.  But a good smoothie nonetheless.  Thanks, ASTROPHE.

This is a tasty and filling smoothie. I will try oatmeal in more of my smoothies. It does have a different consistency, but I liked it. I left out the sugar because I used 1/2 c ice cream and 1/2 c milk. I forgot the vanilla, but I'll try it next time. Very yummy. Thanks for such a great idea. Oh, and my 19 month old liked it too!

Delicious, but definitely blend the oats first and then let them sit for a bit in the milk. Kids all liked it, too! I think the serving size is perfect.

I'm drinking my smoothie as I'm typing this. Do grind the ostmeal first. Today I added close to a cup with no problem to taste. I also added peanut butter and omitted sugar and vanilla. Great taste! This recipe is better than most because you want to avoid a lot of sugar. Some days I even add spinach and you cannot taste it! I use frozen fruit because it makes it creamier. Have fun experimenting.

This was so easy to make. It was Very good and not overly sweet for my taste. I left out the banana and added in a1/4 cup of plain yogurt and a handful of frozen blueberries. I also used coconut milk because I didn't have soy milk. Will definitely make again

I was scrambling this morning to make a filling breakfast for my 2yr old son since I discovered we were out of eggs and those are his favorite! I used this recipe as a base because I was also out of bananas, yikes! So I used fresh strawberries, frozen blueberries, almond milk, honey instead of sugar and ADDED flax seed and yogurt for more protein. He is asking for more :) can't wait to get bananas today and make it again. 
Thanks,
L.

My daughter has this 4-5 times a week. I use whatever fruit I have on hand but always include a banana (and omit the sugar). I also add chia seeds for added goodness. I always forget to add the vanilla but my daughter can't make out the difference. I love that I can omit the sugar and still have a fantastic healthy and yummy smoothie.

I put porridge oats in my smoothies every day and to make less grainy I steep them overnight in just enough milk to cover.   Lovely with mango, or combination of mango and strawberries or blueberries, whatever soft fruit you have to hand... Filling and yummy.

I have made this smoothie recipe several times, but I find it a little bland as written.  I definitely grind the oats first as recommend by other viewers, but to pump up the flavor, I add a few drops of strawberry extract or even a scoop of frozen juice concentrate.

I make this smoothie every day, and the only substitute I really make is almond milk instead of soy, just because that's what I keep in the house regularly. It's absolutely perfect for a quick meal before work or exercise, and it's so good that I've even gotten my mother hooked on it. 
I love that there is no yogurt in it, since I can't eat yogurt in the morning.

This is a good concept and is filling, but there was something about the milk and fruit combination that didn't appeal to me.  I ground up the oats first, so there wasn't a texture issue. Since I do prefer a juice based smoothie, I proablay won't make again.

I've made these a few times now and am really happy with the results. The combination of the frozen strawberries and oats makes it the perfect consistency. At first I tried to add some things like a splash of lemon juice and extra vanilla, but I've found that making the recipe exactly as is is the best! I use quick cooking oats and 2% milk, but I'm sure soy milk would be tastier. I've also tried these with a cup of blueberries instead of the banana. It's not quite as good, but works for those aren't banana fans. What a great way to wake up in the morning!

I used a frozen banana, strawberries & raspberries, and soy milk yogurt (that I make myself). I just mixed it all in my Oskar food processor a little longer than usual due to the oatmeal, also added a little more sugar (4 teaspoons) although I could have added a little stevia.  It was very good and very filling.

A tasty way to start the day.  I modified the ingredients, slightly, using almond milk and oat bran.

My 4 year old daughter loved this smoothie!  She had two glasses before breakfast and kept saying how yummy it was.  I, on the other hand, did not care for it.  It was too sweet.  I prefer other smoothies that I make.

DELICIOUS!! I found this recipe after creating my own oatmeal smoothie and looking for other ideas. What I did: a little less than 1/2 cup of oatmeal, 6 frozen strawberries, and a little less than 1/2 cup of chocolate almond milk!! I think I'll add a banana for tomorrow's smoothie!

I would use oat bran instead of oats, more fiber and protein. I also would agree with many of the reviewers and recommend grinding up the oats/oat bran first. Yum! (o and I don't do soy milk either, regular milk for me)

I agree with Josie, perhaps just a bit too much oat meal, but now I know for next time ;) I thought it was wonderful, and I replaced the soy with almond-coconut milk, which makes it refreshing taste. I think next time I may add another fruit in as well, just because I'm a fan of a mixed taste. I didn't add sugar or vanilla and it still tastes great and filling. Definitely recommend it. So easy.

Be sure to freeze all the fruit. It's easier to make it in a food processor if you're using all frozen fruit. The recipe makes two, and if you split it in half to make one at a time, add 1tsp sugar and 1tsp vanilla.

I just made one I did not have frozen strawberries, but I did have fresh and they were so large that I only used 8. I had 2% milk, so I made it work. It tasted good I am on my way to the gym I will find out if it will be filling for me. I followed the recipe and should have made one serving. I put the other serving in freezer was not sure how it would do in the refrig. I will be making again next time I think I will do my own thing.

Maybe I should have read the reviews first and ground the oats.  I did not like the texture or the aftertaste of this smoothie, and I drink a lot of them.  This recipe has had great reviews, but it's not my favorite strawberry smoothie on this site.  OK, but I doubt I'll make it again.

Wow! I was having one of those "nothing looks good" mornings so I got on all recipe and looked up easy fast vegetation breakfast. I was scrolling through the list, when I found this! I am not normally a smoothie girl, but this was amazing! It was fast and easy but tasted great. My frozen strawberrys already had sugar in them so I left out the vanilla and sugar to make it healthier. I also used raw whole milk instead of soy milk. And as far as the serving size, I think this could feed three people. I gave some to my sister and some to me and I had trouble finishing it because I was full. :D This is a great recipe!

Great smoothie for us high schooler's out there trying to find a healthy quick breakfast! Great tasting, sweet, filling! Exactly what I need for a smart head start! Only thing I wish I knew to fix was the thickness of the smoothie!

Very tasty.  I rarely eat oatmeal for breakfast so this definitely hits the spot!

I really enjoyed this smoothie. I did what the others suggested and placed the oatmeal in the food processor first, and pulsed until it was finely ground. I also used frozen mixed berries, regular milk, and added in a half-tablespoon of peanut butter. I didn't add sugar (I don't add sweetener to my smoothies, just a personal preference). Very creamy and filling. Will be making again.

I finally got around to making this recipe this morning. I thought it tasted pretty good after making a few alterations. For one thing, I didn't do any measuring--I put in what I thought would taste good. I didn't use any sugar or vanilla extract. Instead, I used vanilla soymilk, 8 oz canned pineapples, and some Ciao Bella mango sorbet to make it sweeter since I didn't have any bananas on hand. I will definitely be making this smoothie again.

This was nothing to write home about. The oatmeal gave it a grainy texture. I guess one positive aspect would be that it is filling, but I'm going to stick with yogurt-based smoothies.

Great smoothie...other variations I have tried are adding fresh squeezed orange juice, flaxseed , cinnamon, organic coconut, and using raspberries ...helpful to hear from others to purée the oatmeal first...! Also if I do not have frozen fruit, I just pulse 2-3 ice cubes in it at the end.

Oh my!! I have been making fruit smoothies and protein shakes for almost a year now and this is my new favorite. I used frozen strawberries and bananas and the texture was comparable to ice cream or frozen yogurt. Soo good. I didn't add sugar and only a splash of vanilla, and it was plenty sweet. I usually have one of these after a workout and it fills me up and keeps my energy level up too. The oatmeal adds a really nice texture and flavor as well. My boyfriend, who complains about every healthy meal I make, tried this without me telling him what it was and he's addicted!  Make ASAP

I thought it rather grainy with an odd flavor from the oatmeal. I would much prefer flaxseed, which I've done before in smoothies, and think that gives it a much smoother texture without the aftertaste.

Taste was ok, but the texture became little bit too firm. I would reduce the oatmeal to 2/5 cup, reduce strawberries to 10-12, increase sugar to 2 teaspoons and add a little bit more soy milk.

Also I can't imagine myself drinking this daily so that reduces the stars. I think this would be good drink for somebody trying to reduce calorie intake.

I am always looking for ways to change up my daily smoothie. Each weekend I make two large bowls of fruit salad, I just threw 2-3 cups of chunked fruit (your choice),  with the ground oats and a yogurt (left off the vanilla and sugar) and it was Ah-mazing! Thanks for sharing!!!!!!

Was actually very good.  I used frozen strawberries and milk (because that is what I had) and it actually came out like ice cream.  Great alternative for a night time snack.

I found the recipe sounded really yummy, but after whipping it up in my Cuisinart, it was the oatmeal flakes didn't break down enough so the texture is very oatmealy instead of rich & creamy. if you don't mind the consistency, it tastes good.  I too left out the sugar. I also substituted soymilk for almond milk and threw in some mini chocolate chips.  the chips will soften up while the smoothie settles in the fridge.

I made this smoothie exactly as written for lunch today. My husband and I both liked it. There was no tell tale taste of the oats. The smoothness was perfect. It could have been a bit sweeter for us, but that is an easy fix. Thanks for sharing.

Delicious!  Was thinking of what I could give my picky 11-year old in the morning for breakfast that would be healthy and filling instead of the traditional sugar loaded cereals, bacon, or sausage.  For her I added a non-fat whipped topping. She loves it, and I do too!

This smoothie is pretty good! It was slightly thick for me, but my Vitamix gave it a really creamy texture. I used 2 bananas (love bananas) and it still came out fine. You can hardly tastes the oats; the flavour really came out for me in the aftertaste.

We make this all the time.  You really don't need the added sugar.  If you're worried about the oatmeal, add it to the blender first and give it a good whirl.  Sometimes we toss in some protein powder and then use water for the liquid.  We also add a good amount of ice.

I took some of the other reviewer's hints and added less oats - about 1/4 cup. I also used vanilla soy milk so I skipped the vanilla extract. I added a few extra strawberries and a handful of raspberries and left out the sugar.. even without the sugar it was sweet and delicious. Because of all the modifications I had to make, I only gave it 4 stars but it really is a great recipe that you can easily tailor to fit your tastes!

Surprising - I didn't think that raw oats would work - it did. I blended the oats first to get a fairly fine flour used a squeeze of honey, vanilla soymilk, and blueberries. Nice way to get some morning fiber (I hate eating cereal) with fruit.

absolutely Love this! I substituted the milk for 1 cup of coconut water , I also used 1 cup of organic berry supreme , instead of the 14 strawberries. I also used  1/2 cup quaker oats, and 1/2 cup of greek yogurt instead of adding the sugar and vanilla extract. To make this semi sweet I added 1 Tbs of honey This came out so delicious and much more healthy for you! :)

i have made this recipe exactly as listed and it was fantastic!  However, I also made it without the vanilla and the sugar and it is still pretty great, and healthier! Plus I usually make this at work and don't have vanilla on me. 
A few notes: it is important to use the frozen strawberries or even frozen bananas.  This makes it colder, the proper temperature.
If you do not like the consistency of oatmeal, grind it up before hand.  

You can substitute pretty much any fruits in here, but I'd leave the banana in.  Keep in mind, the other fruits won't taste as strong as the strawberry.

I made this smoothie this morning for breakfast. Agree with other reviewers in regards to putting the oatmeal in first, and then blending. It makes it quite a bit less gritty. I also added in a handful of blackberries, and rather than sugar, I used a tsp of honey. I also put in two tsp of benefiber (it makes it more filling, and just another way to get your fiber in). Minor modifications...this was a really great smoothie. Will try experimenting with other flavors like mango.

I would have rated this 5 stars, but I made some changes. First I ground the oats before adding them and I also ground about a tbsp or so of flax seeds and threw those in there. I don't know if my fruit wasn't sweet enough on its own, or if I just prefer a sweeter taste, but I had to add more sweetener. This turned out great and I will be making it many more times!

This was really good. I did make a couple of changes. I did not have soy milk, so I used vanilla almond milk instead. Cut back the oatmeal to 1/3 C.  Added strawberry yogurt, 1 tsp vanilla, and 1T sugar. Yummy!

Looove this smoothie! I blended the soy milk and oats together first so the oatmeal was ground well, and then I added the strawberries, a scoop of vanilla flavored protein powder, and a little piece of banana. SO good!

I am not a smoothie fan in general, so I am giving this 3 stars instead of 2 as I would like to.  Like others said, I processed the oatmeal first before adding the other ingredients, but I didn't like the oatmeal in it at all.  I frequently found myself picking out small bits of oatmeal from my teeth.  I also didn't add the banana because it was already way too thick with just the strawberries.  After tasting it, I found it to need more sugar, so I added orange juice to thin it and sweeten it.  My son liked it okay, but I doubt I will ever make this again without more major adjustments.

This was really enjoyable. I made mine with skim milk (that's what we had) and I used splenda in place of the sugar. Everything worked out great. The best part was when my 3 year old tried it not only did she love it! She thought it was icecream! Woohoo! Healthy homemade icecream! Thanks for sharing.

Wow! Nutritious and delicious!! Just one tip: If you have allergies to soy milk (or just don't like it), you can substitute Almond Milk (my absolute favorite!) and it is super delicious. Thanks so much for this recipe!!

I used Splenda instead of regular sugar and ground the oats to make a powder. I also used 1% milk since that's all I had on hand and it was very good and filling.

This is a good starting point for a nutritious smoothie.  We have modified it by also grinding the oats, using frozen bananas, water instead of milk, agave syrup and 1/3 block of tofu. VERY rich, creamy and healthy

Love this after a workout.  I, too, used the vanilla soy milk.  I didn't like the banana when I made it.  I found I have to add more soy milk to get the consistency correct when I take out the banana.  I also use honey instead of sugar.  YUM!

at first the graininess of the oatmeal kinda was weird but I did as the others did as well and ground it up first into a fine powder then added other indredients.  It is quite yummy and would be great on the drive to work every day.  I am trying it for lunch this time though.  Yum Yum

The added oatmeal really makes this filling and tasty. I used almond milk instead of soy and omitted the sugar and vanilla. If you're using ripe fruit, it's really not necessary to sweeten it further. Also, if you have a high powered blender, it's not really necessary to break down the oatmeal first, though I did use a frozen banana, so I had to add additional liquid to keep from turning the smoothie into ice cream.

This smoothie was much better than the many others I have tried. The oats gave it a really nice texture. For some odd reason, though, I really want to try this warm...

I made this as the recipe calls, except I used non-fat milk instead of soy milk and it is a yummy breakfast smoothie, the next time I made it I added some ground flax seed and a little honey to the original recipe and it was also delicious.  Great smoothie, healthy and filling!

Very good! Definitely grind up the oats before adding the rest of the ingredients for a smoother texture. I may even add an extra banana next time. I also subbed the soy milk for coconut milk, since that was what I had on hand. =)

Liked it.....not overly in love with the oatmeal texture (I did blend to a more powder like form first) but I know it's good for me so I still put it in.

Used Vanilla Rice Milk so I skipped the vanilla extract. I'm not a huge fan of bananas, but this had just the perfect amount.

Very yummy! Didn't miss the dairy at all! I made the first batch sans bananas for myself & it was delicious! I added the banana for the second batch for my husband and he also loved it. The only change I made was that I added some extra sugar.

This is definitely two servings like the original recipe says, I don't know how people can drink the whole thing! I put the rest in a large thermos that I am taking to work, so I can smoothie throughout the morning.  I almost folllowed the recipe... I did 1/2 cup 2% milk and 1/3 non fat yogurt. I also only did 9 strawberries (mine were huge). I ended up finding it too thick, so I added 1/3 cup water just to thin it out at the end (I didn't want to add any more fat from the milk, and it tastes just the same at this stage of the recipe).   I really enjoyed this smoothie. You can taste the oats, and you can tell in the texture that they are there, but I think it's quite delicious.

Overall, this smoothie is a little thicker than I’m used to due to the oats and a lot less “smoothie” was produced than I’m used to drinking for my morning meal.  The oats, though, add a really filling aspect that should hold me over till lunch (my normal breakfast smoothie does).  I'm giving it three stars though because I had to change around the recipe quite a bit.  14 frozen strawberries with only 1 cup of soy milk isn't enough to create a consistency that I'm used to in smoothies.  (I make one every.single.morning in my VitaMix).  I also omitted the white sugar as it isn't necessary with all the natural sugars from the fruit.

Healthwise, this drink is great.  I think the sugar is definitely a necessary ingredient though.  The rolled oats give the smoothy a very bland taste.

YUM!! I didn't have soy milk so I added half a brick of silken lite tofu instead. I also added apple juice instead of sugar and ground the oats first, as previously suggested.

I found I needed to add more liquid but I was using frozen strawberries and a frozen banana and I added some protein powder.   I also used less strawberries since mine were really big.  I should have blended the oatmeal first like others suggested.  I also used vanilla soy milk and left out the vanilla and sugar.  Overall a really good smoothie!!

This was a lovely morning  drink!  We are smoothie LOVERS and this was delightful!  I used Agave nectar instead of white sugar (never use the white death!!) and have used rice milk, orange juice and almond milk in place of the soy milk.  The vanilla extract isn't necessary but kinda nice.

This came out great. I used only strawberries because that is all I had on hand and it tasted great. I thought you might be able to taste the oatmeal texture but it came out nice. I also added a little protein, I will definitely make this recipe again!

I was skeptical about the oats but this was fantastic! It kept me full all morning. I didn't use anymore sugar...it doesn't need it. I did not have a clue what rolled oats were...I used quick oats and it worked! I also used regular skim milk cause thats what I had and it was really good!

I got up with my husband this morning just to make him this smoothie and use up some of our fresh strawberries and bananas (didn't find that it was too runny with nothing frozen. The oats thicken it up I think). I used light soy milk and made sure to powder the oats first before adding the liquids (texture preference). I wasn't terribly precise in measuring the strawberries. I just put in a couple big scoops, maybe a cup and a half. No sugar was needed in addition to the main ingredients but I added the vanilla because I love it! I think I will start adding oatmeal to all my smoothies for health reasons. I could hardly taste it and it helped fill me up so I didn't overindulge. This made about 6dl of smoothie in my estimation. Thanks!

Really thick, tasty and versatile. One caution: I've made this numerous times, blending everything before adding the strawberries one at a time. Today I added the strawberries, in succession, too quickly and bent the blades on my blender. Now I'm drinking strawberry flavored milk and have to order a new part. So be careful!

I love this recipe. I made it as listed and it was great. I also modified it slightly by adding Flax seed to it and using Splenda instead of sugar. I like to first grind the oats and flax then add the remaining ingredients. Makes for a great breakfast.

YUM. I used this recipe as a "guide" bc I didn't have all of the exact ingredients. Used fat free milk, substituted an orange for the banana & used agave nectar instead of sugar. Loved the idea of sneaking in oatmeal and added a tbsp of ground flax seed too. Will definitely revisit this one frequently.

This is fast and quite delicious!  The smoothie was so thick, however, that an additional 1/2 cup of soy milk was needed to get it to blend.  Maybe we used jumbo berries.  lol!

I used my blender to make the oatmeal into as fine a powder as I could then added the other ingredients and it still was gritty- liked the concept of the oatmeal but it did not work

This is a really good recipe. I use slightly less than 1/2 cup of oatmeal finely ground and add a few packets of sweetner. I also used 2/3rd cup of unsweetened almond milk because I wanted the smoothie really thick. If you allow the smoothie to sit for a few minutes before serving it gives the oatflour time to absorb some of the liquid which eliminates the "chalky" taste that some complain of. This is definately going in our rotation.

Before I found this, I had been wondering how oatmeal would be in a smoothie because I want to eat it, but don't like it plain. It was wonderful! Pair it with a hard-boiled egg for a quick, delicious, and filling healthy breakfast.

Not bad.  I grounded up the oatmeal like everyone else did, but the oatmeal still kind of overpowers the fruit flavors a bit.  I might have to cut that down a bit next time.  I also added agave for a little bit of sweetness.  Good recipe!

I halved the recipe, used 1% milk, added 1/4 cup of plain 1% yoghurt and a tbsp of ground flax seed, and subsituted honey for the sugar.  Normally I don't add sweetener to smoothies but I think the oatmeal needed a little sweetening up.  I omitted the vanilla because the extra flavour didn't seem necessary.  It is a thick, filling smoothie-- I am glad I didn't try to make and consume the full recipe.

So good. My kids loved it too. I will make it again and add some wheat germ for a little more nutrition. Put the oats in the food processor first as others suggested.

Can't believe how incredibly filling this is! Had to sub frozen blueberries for the fruit but that was it. Never been much of a smoothie person but this is definitely going to be my breakfast from now on. Thanks ASTROPHE!

Fabulous! I used skim milk since I can't have soy, but I would think any kind of milk would do. I made it again with frozen blackberries instead of strawberries. I will never make a smoothie without oatmeal again! Thanks for submitting this wonderful recipe.

Five stars because of the easy preparation and health benefits, four stars on the taste.  I might add a different fruit next time.  Maybe peaches?  And just a little bit more sugar!

The previous reviewer was right; this IS a great way to get in a few servings of fruit.  I thought this would come out runny but it was really thick; I used a frozen banana & I think that helped w/ the thickness.  Next time I'll add blueberries. Great recipe!

A change I made is something I saw them do at Planet Smoothie - Instead of using plain oats, they empty a single serve pack of instant oatmeal into the smoothie (I love the cinnamon or apple). It's awesome and gives it a little more flavor for those who don't mind some extra sweetener in the mix.  Great smoothie though - just as good as the one I pay $6 for at Planet Smoothie! This will become a regularity for me.

Really good.  We used Almond Milk instead of soy and we used fresh strawberries.  I was a little dubious about the oats, but I really liked it.  Will make a lot more times in the future!

Very yummy, though I made a couple of changes.  I used regular milk and a 1/2 C of Vanilla yogurt.  I used an artificial sweetener instead of sugar and omitted the vanilla and banana (I didn't have one).  I LOVED the oatmeal in this!  It covers up the seeds from the strawberries and makes it so filling!

Just what I was looking for; a healthy, low fat, cholesterol lowering, filling breakfast drink!!!  What more could you ask for? I often make without the banana and it is still thick from the oats. As other reviewers have suggested, put the oats in the blender first and blend to turn into powder before adding rest of ingredients Thank you for submitting!!

I loved this smoothie. I really never thought to make a smoothie with oatmeal, but it's a really nice, filling addition. Also as I'm not a sweets person I left out the sugar and substituted the vanilla extract for almond extract. Completely delicious. It was basically room temperature when I tried it so I refrigerated the other half before drinking. Great recipe!

well, I thought this was going to be great. I didn't have soy milk but used skim and since one other reviewer said they make it with skim and they gave it 5 stars, I figured it would be ok. This was very bland. I doubled the recipe for two people but used about 1/2 the oat meal. Still bland. Husband says its chalky. not the worst thing I've ever eaten but Pretty disappointing. Ended up having to add coconut extract to add some flavor because we couldn't taste ANYTHING. Maybe just leave out the oatmeal? I don't know. I really wanted a good smoothie tonight because I just got a new blender and hadn't used it yet and I'm very disappointed.

Who would have thought to add oats to a smoothie?! It's delicious! I make this every morning for breakfast, with a few modifications. I blend the oats alone first, until they are powdery, add two bananas, five or six large frozen strawberries, and add coconut milk until it's the right consistency. I always throw in a few handfuls of kale to bump up the nutrition. My kids (6, 7, and 9) go absolutely crazy for this -- and it's so fast and healthy!

Well, I used skim milk...sorry! But other than that, adding oats to the smoothie is such a hugely awesome idea... you can taste them,  but it's a good taste...the smoothie becomes more of a breakfast, not just a drink to go with breakfast. Since I was using it as breakfast, I did try it with 1 c skim milk, 1 banana, 5 large stawberries, and 1/4 c oats and it held me for hours.

I love the taste of this smoothie. I've made it twice. The 1st time it was a little too thick for my taste. The 2nd time I used 1/2cup soy milk and 1/2cup berry juice cut back on the sugar to 1tp and it turned out great.I'll be making it again and again and again!

Soooo good! I made my mine with 1% milk and blueberries, peaches and pineapples (because that's all I had for fruit). I'm looking forward to trying the banana and strawberry. I really like the oatmeal texture, so did my 5 year old!

I've always loved the idea of a smoothie for breakfast but have never been able to find one that I liked - always too sweet, too bland, weird texture.  Wasn't sure about the addition of oatmeal, but it was great, nice texture, right amount of sweetness.  I used regular milk because I can't tolerate soy, and powdered the oatmeal.  I have this so often now, that I powder a few cups of oatmeal at a time so that it's ready anytime I want a scoop.

I would give this a 4.5 but can't. I added 1tsp of vanilla by accident but was still very good. I put the oats first and gave them a whirl just to make them more like powder. Next time I might add less strawberry cause I like more a banana taste then strawberries, but otherwise very yummy and both my girls love it too(20months and 4). Thanks for sharing.

Loved it! I really liked the taste and texture the oats gave it. The only change I made was to omit the sugar completely, as I don't like my smoothies really sweet. Thank you, I'll be making this often!

Officially addicted to this!!!  The only things I do different:  I use honey instead of sugar and regular milk instead of soy (don't usually have soy).  I did try it with pineapple juice once and did not care for it at all.  Personally, I think it needs the creaminess of the milk/soy.  Although doing half frozen strawberry and half frozen pineapple is divine!!!  It gives it sort of a tropical flavor.  I LOVE it this way!  I could drink this every day!

I used fortified light vanilla soy milk and eliminated the sugar and vanilla and it was delicious! I also ground the oats first before adding the other ingredients and blending.

perfect for breakfast or light dinner!  Instead of the soy milk & vanilla, I used 1 cup vanilla flavored non-fat yogurt; it still came out perfectly. Even my husband (a junk-food junkie) loved this.

Yummy!  I didn't have soy milk, so I used about 1/4 c plain yogurt.  Replaced the strawberries with frozen blueberries and threw in a bit of ice.  I added pomegranite/blueberry juice to get it to the right consistency.  The oatmeal was different, but definitly not bad.  I made it for my husband who was on a fast, but my kids drank most of it!  Will make this again!

This was pretty good. I kind of despise bananas so I added a few more strawberries and some vanilla yogurt to thicken it up. I also used splenda. I think I will add a litle more splenda and vanilla extract next time (I didn't measure it...) Very tasty though.

This was quite delicious!  However, I cheated.  I didn't have any frozen fruit, so I used about half fresh strawberries and half fresh raspberries (a few more raspberries than strawberries since they're smaller).  It turned out great :)  

I also think agave nectar makes a good sweetener for the smoothie, rather than sugar.  Either way, it was awesome and the oatmeal was a totally new thing for me!

Thanks! :)

This smoothie is delicious, though mine also had a gritty texture. I blame that on my blender (the thing dates back to the stone age). My husband thought it tasted great, and had TWO 8 oz glasses instead of one, what he usually does with smoothies! I think he liked that fact that it was a smoothie of substance. Will make again.

This is great. Made this at least a couple hours ago and I'm still full. Pregrinding the oats was the perfect suggestion by the others. Just sprinkled a little splenda for just a touch of sweetness.

This recipe was very easy to make and it tasted great!  i made it with 1% milk and left out the sugar and banana.  I tried it with only 1/4 cup of oats but i thought it tasted better with 1/3 cup.  My 2 and 3 year olds love it as well and call it strawberry ice.

This recipe was a perfect start of the day breakfast!  I threw in some ice to bulk it up a bit (so I wouldn't gulp it down) and it was just right.  I didn't add any sugar or vanilla though.  My husband loved it too and says that we should cut out the "coffee & bagel" mornings and just drinks these.  The next one I want to try omiting the fruits and add a coffee flavored protein powder that is low in sugar I found at Trader Joes - gotta get the coffee flavor some how! (hehe)  There are probably many healthy variations on this you can make and enjoy if you are watching calories.

This was very good.  I like the oatmeal.  It was very filling.  This will definitely be a breakfast regular.
