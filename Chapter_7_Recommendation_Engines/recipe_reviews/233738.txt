I made a few of these this morning! I was very happy with the fact that I can still enjoy pancakes while maintaining a gluten free diet. That said, I am not the best cook in the world, and making fabulous pancakes before switching to GF was no easy task for me. These were simple enough to make, and I think wold have turned out even better if I had a nice griddle to cook them on, instead of using the good ol' frying pan. I will be making these again in hopes of perfecting the art of pancake making! 
Another thing to be aware of, is since this recipe has no flour in it, the pancakes will be a way different texture than what you might be used to. I was told to cook them slowly or they get all weird.

This recipe was amazing!! I wanted to eat more, but 1 banana a day is my max (they hurt my stomach).

I made a couple of adjustments because my banana was a little bit small & the batter ended up way too watery.. So I added about 2 teaspoons of oats (which I blended in) and about 1/2 a teaspoon of xanthan gum (which is great for all kinds of things that need thickening. most people use it to thicken smoothies) and I just stirred that in and waited about 3 minutes. 

I also added a sprinkle of cinnamon and topped them with peanut butter & maple syrup. YUM! I will make these a lot! :) Thanks!

I have never eaten anything at would be considered paleo. I was not a huge fan. I would eat them if it was a diet I was following but probably not as a regular part of my routine meals.

Three ingredients! Squeeze an orange slice on it and WOW. These were REALLY good! I didn't have arrowroot powder on hand, so I used tapioca starch. The result was a great breakfast! Another keeper. All three of us liked it!

I made significant changes to this recipe, and they turned out great! I used 2 bananas, 2 eggs, 1/4 Cup+ of arrowroot, 1/2 tsp baking powder, and added 2 tbsp coconut sugar, 1/4 tsp vanilla extract. Blended up in a Magic Bullet pitcher attachment! My kids LOVE them, and my husband and I think they're pretty good too ;)

Made these this morning and really enjoyed them. I took another's suggestion for corn starch since I didn't have arrowroot. I sprinkled toasted unsweetened coconut on top after pouring and spread homemade apple butter on them. Excellent and easy peasy! Will definitely be experimenting with this recipe but keeping the main ingredients for the base. Thanks for sharing!

I loved this! Instead of arrowroot powder (because I didn't have any) I used 1 tsp of almond flour. I put some agave syrup on top when they were finished! DELICIOUS!

I had these for my New Year's breakfast this morning. I topped them with some homemade apple butter that I was gifted for Christmas. I love that this recipe is so simple. I used cornstarch in place of arrowroot. Will make these again and may try my own variations.

Not bad! I did this recipe using 6 bananas, 6 eggs, and 6 tsp of arrowroot powder. I also added a teaspoon of cinnamon and a 1/2 tsp nutmeg to the batter. Then as I browned the first side, I sprinkled a few sliced almonds on each one before I flipped them. I placed parchment paper between them and froze them so I will have them available each morning to pop in the air fryer before work. Obviously the texture is a bit off from regular pancakes but they are a great way to change it up from just having regular old hard boiled eggs for breakfast each morning.

This was my first attempt at Paleo pancakes, and I was not disappointed! It was quick and easy to make, and even my kids liked it. Instead of syrup I used the spiced buttery apple spread from the 21 Day Sugar Detox recipe book. This recipe is a keeper.
