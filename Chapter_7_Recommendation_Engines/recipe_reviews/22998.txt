What a classy and utterly delicious dish!  I now know how to properly wilt spinach!  I love the texture of the cool chopped tomatoes over this hot savory dish.  This recipe is easy and will be the star attraction at future dinner parties.  Good going, Tracy!

We really liked this. Don't like the pesto sauce mix so I used garlic & herb sauce. 2 can's of tuna is plenty. Bow ties were very nice. I near doubled the mushrooms and added way more than 2 cups of spinach. Next time I will add a huge, huge pile of spinach. Also, topped with asiago. Very quick dinner. Looking forward to making this again.

This is a keeper for our family. I don't eat meat and I can easily leave the tuna out of this or take my share before adding the tuna last. The only change I made was to replace the milk with 1/4 cup of olive oil and a 1/2 cup of water for a healthier alternative, which is on the back of the pesto mix packet. This was delicious and I will be making it again soon, I highly recommend it!

Really good for a canned tuna recipe!  I'm impressed.  I did have to make some changes, mostly because I couldn't find the creamy pesto sauce mix.  I did find a non-creamy pesto sauce mix (Simply Organic Sweet Basil Pesto - 0.53 oz) and used that instead.  The directions on the packet said to use 1/4 cup olive oil and 1/2 cup water, so I used that instead of the margarine and milk.  To make it more rich in nutrients, I used a whole 8 oz. carton of mushrooms and doubled the spinach.  We topped it off with parmesan cheese and it was a delightful meal!

I didn't have pesto sauce mix or mushrooms, so I used 1/2 cup of dried basil and half a can of condensed cream of mushroom soup (although it probably would have been fine with the whole can). I tried it with only two cans of tuna like a few reviews said, and because I wanted to make sure it was a good recipe before I used all of my tuna in it (haha), but I'll definitely use three next time. I sprinkled a little garlic salt and parmesan cheese on top at the end. It was delicious! Thanks!

Very nice, enjoyed it but I should have used all albacore tuna.  Found it needed a little more seasoning. Since I don't eat them, I left out the mushrooms but I did toast a few pine nuts (1/4 cup) and tossed them in near the end.  It added a great nutty flavor and were a nice compliment to the pesto.  I also sprinkled a little grated parm on top when I served it.

Delicious!  Great change from traditional tuna noddle casserole.  I couldn't find creamy pesto seasoning so followed a previous review and made white sauce and added pesto seasoning (spice section of grocery store).  White sauce recipe was 4 Tbsp. butter, 4 Tbsp. flour and 3 cups milk.  Also added about 2 tsp. salt 1/4 tsp. pepper, and 2 tsp. of pesto seasoning.  My husband loved it and my two little ones (daughter 2 1/2 & son 15 mos.) ate it also!  Will definite make again!

Good, filling meal. I messed up a little bit and used pesto sauce instead of pesto sauce MIX, but I added a tbsp of flour to thicken my watery mess up a little bit and it worked great. I also recommend adding some seasoning at the end to spice it up a little bit. The tomatoes really work well in the dish, setting themselves apart from the rest of the dish as a refresing bite without being distracting. Would like to try again with the mushrooms (my girlfriend doesn't like them!), I'm sure it's great.

I don't know if I would consider it an "elegant" dish, but it looks good & tastes pretty good too.  Next time I'll try it with chicken- the tuna tasted funny in it.  I used just a regular pesto (as opposed to creamy pesto) sauce mix, so it was soupy too, which was not good.  My husband did not like this dish, but I thought it was okay.  May make again when I'm in a hurry- I usually have those ingredients on hand.

I made this dish with garlic cream mix since there was no pesto, doubled everything to make enough... It was ok but quite bland - needed more seasons. Probably wont be making this one again.

I cooked the tomatoes and mushrooms with the pasta for 5 minutes. And I "cooked" the spinach by draining the pasta over it (works perfectly every time.) I think it needs some cheese. Tastes good cold too.

I never thought tuna would be so yummy! This was a really enjoyable dish. I did not have pesto sauce mix, so I just made a white sauce with butter, garlic, flour and milk, then added everything to it. Also added a sprinkling of red pepper flakes. We'll be making this again.

I was not fond of this recipe.  I'm not sure if I disliked the creamy pesto mix (first time using it) or if the pesto and tuna flavors were competing, but it just was not appealling.  It was a bit bland.  It may be good with homemade creamy pesto made with fresh basil and garlic.  Also, I think shrimp would be better with these ingredients than tuna.  I followed the recipe exactly.

This was really, really good.  Even my husband, who rarely comments about dinner, was raving about it to his co-workers.  Substituted Whole Wheat bow ties, used a couple teaspoons of jarred pesto (couldn't find the mix), and omitted the tomatoes (couldn't find any really good ones).  Definitely a keeper!

This was very good and also very easy.  I only used 2 cans of tuna, and my roma tomatoes were pretty big so I only used 2 of them as well.  I bought the Knorr's Creamy Pesto sauce mix.  It all came together very well and I would definitely make it again.

Success!  This one is a hit for spinach lovers.  My father in law and husband licked their fingers and praised it a lot. Very easy, fast preparation and really very tasty.

We love this dish! The creamy pesto and the mushrooms with the tuna was an unexpected delight. I agree with other posters about using only 2 cans of tuna, but otherwise, I like this recipe as is.

I really enjoyed this one!  I'm not a big fan of "packet" sauces/gravy so I made my own pesto sauce.  I also used grape tomatoes because that is all I had on hand.  Thanks Tracy, I loved this!

It was good, but a little too much tuna!  I would recommend only using 1/2 the amount of tuna listed.  Other than that, it was pretty good.  A little bland.

It was okay.  I did not like the tomatoes, perhaps red bell pepper would be better if you want the color.  Definatly needed salt and pepper.  Husband liked it, my one-yr old daughter loved it.  Good weekday comfort food, but not for company.

Very nice! Didn't think the tuna would work in this, but it tastes so good, you hardly realize it is tuna you are eating. Didn't have pesto sauce, so made a white sauce, added pesto and garlic, the rest of the ingredients and topped with toasted pine nuts and parmigian cheese. Lovely!

Made a cheese sauce instead of the creamy pesto mix as we don't seem to have that at my local grocery stores. Quick and easy dinner.

I couldn't find a creamy pesto mix so I changed the recipe to use what I had. I used a jar of alfredo sauce and mixed in most of a 6 oz jar of basil pesto. I kept the rest of the ingredients the same and it was very tasty.

I liked that this recipe used veggies and tuna but something about it just didn't quite taste right. My husband did eat the leftovers but the vote was not to make this again.

This was a great recipe!!  I used 12 oz of pasta, which was the whole box.  I also have used chicken and added half alredo sauce to it and it was great!!!  I added double the mushrooms and extra spinach.  I also added a fontina, romano, parmesan cheese blend to the mix and added more when served.  Thanks for a great recipe!!

This was a pretty good recipe although I doubled it.  I like leftovers and finding only 8 ounces of pasta is near impossible.  I did cut back on the tuna, instead of using 4 cans because of doubled, I used three just to not overdo it and I would say next time, I will only use 2.  I did add more veggies than it called for.  But my six year old said it was the best pasta he has ever had.

Very good.  I didn't have any pesto mix so I mixed: fresh basil, garlic, chili pepper and olive oil in a pan then added the milk.  Also added some shredded cheese before serving.  Came out wonderful!!!

This recipe was really quite good and easy.  I personally thought that three cans of tuna was a little much.  Next time I make it I'm going to only make it with two.  It's a really great idea and I think would also be great with chicken.  The only problem I really had was when I was mixing it the pasta broke apart a little and this was frustrating.  Other than that it was great.

I really wasn't impressed with this dish.  The standard tuna noodle casserole is a better base recipe and be altered a number of different ways.

This is a great recipe to add to your regular routine!  Only thing I would change is to cut the tuna down a bit and to use only albacore (all white) tuna.  Otherwise, the natural pink color and slight bitterness of regular tuna subtracts from the dish.  Also, I hate mushrooms - so those were omitted.  And, I couldn't find a 1.2oz pesto mix so I used 2 (.50oz) packets and it tasted fine.  This dish is FAST and HEALTHY!  Definitely a keeper!

Couldn't find pesto sauce mix, used jarred pesto by Classico and added a little heavy cream. Also had sundried tomatoes on hand from Trader Joes! Used two cans of tuna, was plenty. Topped with shredded Parmesan cheese. Turned out wonderfully!!

My family and I did not enjoy this recipe. In my opinion the flavors did not go well together. Canned or fresh chicken may have been better.

Very yummy dish.  It was a little hard to get my children to eat, but once they began it went over well.  My husband suggested trying it with Chicken next time, so maybe we will.  All in all very good!

Very good dish! I used extra spinach and mushrooms, garlic and herb sauce, 2 cans of tuna, and not so much pasta.  My boyfriend is not too excited about my "healthy" dishes but loved this one!! Will definitely make again!

This is a very tasty way to use canned tuna!
I ended up using about twice as much pesto.  I also sauteed some onions and celery in butter before starting with the milk and pesto step.  I used a little more spinach than the recipe called for just because I like spinach and I had a lot to use.
It turned out very well!  Fair warning, the spinach and mushrooms will release liquid as they cook so drain your pasta well.  I am glad that I used twice as much pesto because there would have been too little flavor if I'd used the recommended amount.  You may want to add garlic or a little something to jazz it up.
Will gladly make again!

This dish was fantastic! I mixed together Pesto sauce mix with Alfredo sauce mix, with slightly more Pesto than Alfredo. I also used two cans of tuna instead of three (all I had); also, I had noticed some commenters reccomended descreasing the amount of tuna. Although, my boyfriend mentioned that the tuna didn't seem to be a more dominant flavor as he had expected, so I think maybe next time I will use three cans instead of two. Everything else I followed the recipe exactly and it was great! Will definitely make again, thanks for sharing.  EDIT: I have made this many times and I have to add another comment: Whenever I use mushrooms in recipes 99% of the time I use chopped Portabella mushrooms; however, this recipe really calls for canned mushrooms slices.  Perfect.

The only reason I'm giving it 3 stars is because:

When we decided to make it, we couldn't find pesto sauce mix anywhere.  We didn't have the ingredients to make our own pesto sauce, so we ended up kind of creating our own recipe based on some of the ingredients listed in this one, plus a couple more we had around the house.  We really want to try making this one again, though.  It sounds wonderful... if only we can find a place that sells pesto sauce mix!

I didn't have the pesto mix, but I had an alfredo mix. We don't like salty food, so I added extra milk (probably 1 1/2 cups more) and a couple Tbsp's of tomato paste. I steamed 3 cups of broccoli and added the last bit of spinach I had to the dish as well. I only added 2 cans of tuna and no tomatoes. Everybody liked it, and it wasn't too salty either. Great recipe to use during Lent...thanks!

I've used this recipe for a couple of years now, and keep going back to it. Garlic and wine are essential, but reviewers who say it isn't the traditional tuna casserole are right.  It isn't supposed to be, but I got the DH to eat tuna caserole with this, and that's a big plus!

Instead of the Creamy Pesto sauce mix, I made the "Pesto Sauce" recipe from allrecipes.  I also added 1/2 each of a green and red pepper instead of mushrooms.  I used canned chicken instead of tuna.  It was pretty good- a little bland, but overall good.  I would probably use less milk next time, and add more spices (more salt and pepper, maybe some italian spices).

I was very pleased with the results on this one, even my 17yr old ate it. Big PLUS!!! Creamy pesto in dry form hard to come by around here, simply substituted pesto in jar, omitted the milk and added some sour cream.

This is a very nice recipe that is elegant enough for company yet easy enough for everyday.  I sauted the mushrooms in the butter until light brown and flavorful before adding to the sauce.  I only used one 6 oz. packet of chunk light tuna and it was plenty for me.  I topped it with freshly grated parmesan-reggiano.(sic)
Something tells me that the left-overs served as a cold lunch salad will also be yummy!

My husband and I thought this recipe was great!  However, he is not a big seafood eater, and said he would prefer a little less tuna.  My kids actually ate it pretty well, other than the tomatoes and mushrooms, which they were able to pick out.  I think most of that has to do with their age, though.  Thanks for the recipe, I will definitely use it again, but just modified for my "picky" family's needs!

This was very tasty as written (4*s).  I made it again with some changes which suited our palates, and I think I'll stick with this version:  I always use Whole Grain Pasta. The flavor of the tuna is important, so I used Tuna Packed In Olive Oil - drained well & patted dry (very flavorful).  I always use Evaporated Milk in casseroles for a more creamier texture.  Also, Baby Bella (Crimini) mushrooms have a more pronounced mushroom flavor (if that's what you like) than a regular White Mushroom.  Lastly, I didn't chop the tomatoes.  I used a couple more Romas than the recipe called for & quartered them (it looked better to me this way.)  A light dusting of Grated Parmesan-Romano Cheese and a few leaves of Italian Parsley on top, and ENJOY!

Very delicious! Nice n' light unlike the regular casseroles. I did make a few changes partially due to kitchen inventory. I was out of mushrooms but will definitely add them next time. I added 1 tbsp. of white wine, a few capers and Sun-dried tomatoes chopped in addition. I put in a casserole dish and sliced tomatoes over mixture and topped w/real bacon, and Feta cheese. Just adding to the many wonderful flavors!

I don't know that I would call this a fancy tuna casserole.  It was a nice meal that balanced fresh ingredients with an inexpensive budget.  We would make it again.  Left-overs were not as great as the original night.

Bow Tie Tuna Florentine Haiku: "Colorful and great. And very easy to make. Didn't use the milk." The only pesto sauce packet that I found in the supermarket called for stirring w/ olive oil, so I followed its directions in conjunction w/ the recipe's directions. I'd hover on giving it 4.5 stars since I think it could benefit from some chopped garlic, onions, and black pepper, but as written, it was healthy, easy to make, and pretty.

I liked this, but the rest of my family did not, i did have some problems with moisture, it kept wanting to dry out.

This was the best tuna "casserole" I have ever had.  My husband loved it's "comfort food" taste.  Even my one year old ate it up with no adversion to the tuna!

I'm not a pesto lover, so I followed another persons recommendations for adding basil, garlic and chili pepper (I'd omit that next time - I think it made it too spicy), and it was very good. Served with warm French Bread and it was quite a treat! Substituted non-dairy creamer (1 cup) + 1/4 cup water (as we are lactose intolerant) - made the sauce a bit sweeter, but still very good!

Good, but heated canned tuna isn't the best.  Probably better with chicken breast instead, which I will try next time.

I made this the other night and it was good.  Didn't like the tomato too much, but otherwise good!  Nummy leftovers, will make again!

Very easy to make.  The pesto sauce really makes this dish taste fabulous.  Even did well as leftovers for lunch the next day.

This recipe is delicious. Very quick very easy and just so good, my 13 month old grandson loved it. If you are short of time and forgot to defrost something for dinner, you can just go to your pantry and with a few ingredients have a great dinner, add a salad and fruit and you have a great meal.

I didn't think the flavors blended very well. The sauce was on the dry side,and the packaged pesto sauce tasted artificial.

This was a really good recipe... my fiance loved it and he is not a big pasta person! I did add some minced onion and about 2 teaspoons of minced garlic as well. I think the garlic added a very good flavor to the dish! This is a keeper! Thanks!

This was a fantastic change from original tuna casserole.  I feel it is something good enough to be served in a restaurant.  My children do not eat seafood so I won't make it often but I do know it is something I will want to eat for many years to come.
