Tasted like watered-down bottled lemon juice that happened to have sliced strawberries in it.

Yes, it was very refreshing.  The sugar can be adjusted as my husband thought it needed a little bit more even though I only used 6 cups of water.  Also, it will turn light pink as it sits.

I had a massive hankering for lemonade this week  & stumbled upon this recipe. It's very tasty. In my opinion it just needs a little more strawberry! Next time I make it I plan on adding some blueberries & raspberries to get a mixed berry flavour!

This was actually pretty good as is. The key is to let the strawberries release their natural juices in the sugar for a minimum of 10 min.

The flavors in this recipe could have been stronger. I barely tasted any strawberry or lemon flavor, despite using ripe berries from the farmers market and fresh-squeezed lemons. I do want to try it again with more lemon juice and strawberries.
