Having been to a couple of luaus now, this effectively recreates the taste as well as you can without burying a pig in your back yard. We used a low sodium soy sauce, which was fine as their is more than enough salt in the recipe. We cooked a 4 lb butt in the slow cooker for about 8 hours, steaming with the cabbage for the last 30 minutes. The result was great. I served it with Guam styled fried rice, so it was a real gut buster feast. While buns or rolls are somewhat traditional, as a low glutein household we don't feel they are required. in fact, the first time I served this with hot dog buns the bread was ignored entirely, as everyone was perfectly full with pork, cabbage, rice and vegetables. while not anyone's idea of a health nut dinner, this is certainly a good option if you want a breadless meal.

This was pretty good.  I followed the recipe exactly, except I used low sodium soy sauce and a bag of shredded red cabbage.  I also added ~1/2 cup of water to the crock pot.  It was a bit salty, so next time I will cut back on the kosher salt, and increase the pepper, ginger and liquid smoke.

I followed the recipe, but added 1/2-1 cup of chicken broth and discovered that was totally unnecessary as it was a little soupy.  It was still delicious, but I, too, would cut the salt down a little next time (I also used low sodium soy sauce).  The next night I reheated some (it makes A LOT!) of the meat in a pan so it got a little crispy and made burritos.  Super yummy!

Excellent Kalua Pork. Thanks for the recipe Mei. I chose this recipe over others because it called for ginger, worcestershire, and some soy sauce vs. just salt and liquid smoke, which I feel flavored the roast much better.

 I also used medium grain Hawaiian Alaea Sea Salt. If you do use a granule salt, like I did, whether it be Kosher or Hawaiian, assure that you first crush it with a mortar and pestle, and cut the salt back if you don't like your meat very salty. 

I also served the pork over a bed of the steamed cabbage leaves just as it was served to us at "Feast at Lele" Luau in Maui last month. I would recommend this for two reasons. First, this is a lot of pork and since there were lots of left overâ€™s, I wanted my cabbage steamed fresh when eating it again, not soggy as it would be when you reheat it with the cabbage mixed in. Second, I also added Mexican spices,(Chili powder, cumin, garlic powder, onion powder, cayenne pepper. etc..), and made some delicious shredded
pork tacos for lunch one day.

I will be making this recipe again many times in the future.

Omit the salt!! Double the rest of the ingredients (except the pepper)  and it is smokey and savory.  A nice alternative to BBQ!

When we got back from Maui I wanted to make some authentic Hawaiian food and found this recipe. All I can say is "Yummy!"  It was like bringing a little bit of paradise home with us!  My son's wedding is Hawaiian themed and he and his fiance' asked me to cook up a huge bunch of Kalua pork for the reception.  I've done two crock pots worth so far and need to do one more.  this is great served on rolls.

**EDIT** I have to take back everything I said about this dish!!  We had this as leftovers a day later and it was completely different after 24 hours.  You could taste the ginger (athough I still think it needs a touch more than what's called for,) and the 1-1/2 tbsp of salt was perfect after I shredded the meat. I served it as mini-sliders on Hawaiian rolls, with a touch of hickory smoke BBQ sauce, the cabbage, and a slice of swiss cheese... Delicious Hawaiian goodness!  Amazing after cooling down and sitting in the fridge for a few hours.  Can you tell I loved this?? :) **EDIT**

Having lived in Memphis, Tn for the last 30 years and eating pork shoulder at seemingly almost every gathering, work luncheon, etc., I was excited about making this and was hoping for more of a Hawaiian flare, but that was not the case.  You can't really taste the ginger at all but you can definitely taste the salt which I cut down to 1 and 1/2 tablespoons .  The salt should probably be cut down to 1 tablespoon and the amount of ginger should be increased.  The roast did cook beautifully in the crock pot (and once I shredded it the salty taste subsided quite a bit.)  The best part of the dish for me was the cabbage which I shredded and just threw on top of the roast for the last hour of cooking.  The cabbage soaked up the flavor of the roast quite well.  I spooned it out before shredding the roast and saved it in a separate container to stay crisp.  Thanks for the post.

Delicious! Didn't bother with salt since I used regular soy sauce, and it turned out fantastic. I've made this twice and the first time I put the cabbage in the crock as instructed, but I felt like it didn't get soft enough. So the second time, I just boiled in a skillet on the stove with some butter, salt, and pepper, and served along side the pork. So good!

Really very tasty! I made the recipe almost exactly (it wasn't bad with regular Kosher salt and probably 2 T of liquid smoke compared to what is called for) and it really tasted exactly like what I'd get in my local Hawaiian restaurant. Highly recommended!

One tip, use Hickory smoke instead of Applewood.

I made this for a neigbhorhood potluck and it was enjoyed by everyone. It is so very very easy and tastes better than the kaluha pork at the luaus in Hawaii. Moist and flavorful, no need to add liquid because as the meat cooks it generates its own liquid.

Tried this exactly as stated in the recipe.  It was wonderful.  Reminded us so much of what we used to eat when we lived in Hawaii.  It was a little salty, but that's how I remember it.  We served it with white sticky rice.  The family wants it again. :)

I'm engaged to a Polynesian and this dish is big in their culture and I feel in love with it first time I had it. Seeing that I'm not trying to prepare it in the ground like it's traditionally done I followed all the directions here except I wrap the pork in a big banana leaf and tied it with butcher's time before placing it in the slow cooker.  It came out  near identical to the traditional method. This is the only way I'll make Kalua Pork from here out.

This was delicious but a bit salty.. I will make it again and use half the salt and double the ginger. Then I believe it will be 5 stars. 

It was still very good and so easy to make. It did wake me up at 3:00 in the morning because of the delicious smell coming out of the crockpot.

Amazing recipe! Super easy and my husband said it was the best Kalua pork ever. I made a few small changes I started with 1/2 the amount of salt and added more salt at the end to taste, I also added an extra teaspoon on liquid smoke for more of the smoky flavor and instead of using 1/2 of  cabbage I used a whole.

This was delicious!  I did micro-steam the cabbage separately just to keep it fresh. I also halved plus a bit the salt, a good idea since not adding in the cabbage.

I followed this recipe entirely. It was amazing. It reminded me of the Kalua Pork in Oahu when living there. It was a bit juicy but its whats to be expected when cooking in a slow cooker. I just drained the excess juice and voila! It was amazing and delicious!!

Tastes awesome! Please keep in mind that this is a tad on the salty side and is expected to be eaten with rice or bread. (Shaved pork slider etc).

The tenderness was great and the flavor profile was good but severely lacking in volume. I would at least double all the  ingredients. I also would leave out the cabbage.

I did not have an issue with the saltiness. I took note of the other reviews and used low sodium soy sauce. The meat was tasty but not as flavorful as I expected. Served as a soft taco. What I thought this recipe seriously lacked was a sweet aspect. I didn't have time to experiment with sauces but I found that serving this with apple sauce or maple syrup really took the dish to a new level.

We love the cabbage in this, so I use a whole head of green cabbage and allow it took cook for about 2-3 hours after shredding the pork.  It's delicious every time I make it! One of our favorite meals and takes us back to our time in Hawaii!

One of the best pork slowcooker dishes I've ever made, and waaay better than anything I've eaten outside of Hawaii.

Cut the kosher salt down to about one heaping tablespoon, and use another big tablespoon of soy + a dash. Good liquid smoke is important, get some hickory flavored (I'm not a huge mesquite fan).

What really set if off for me was that I rubbed the pork in brown sugar, about 2 tablespoons, before pouring on the sauce. I think this gave a great balance.

Added the cabbage after I got home and put on low for another hour, it was perfect.  Also, my roast was only 2.5 lbs., so for a 5 pounder, the sodium is probably about right. Ignore the whiners, this one just works.

My wife and I moved to Spokane from Las Vegas. Her big complaint out here is the lack of authentic food, especially Hawaiian. This recipe is as close as we've found to her favorite hole-in-the-wall Hawaiin restaurants. I don't measure out the salt anymore, I just grind a coat over the pork like I would when prepping a steak(same with the pepper and ginger). Either way, I've never had complaints about too much salt, even when I followed the recipe to the letter. Fix this with some macaroni salad, Botan rice, and a side of Siracha and you're good to go.

Seasonings do not overwhelm the pork. Substituted 2 tablespoons minced fresh ginger for dried.  Used low sodium soy sauce. Trimmed fat off the pork shoulder. Have made this several times already

I made it. Put the roast on last night. Added a bag of shredded cabbage this morning and enjoying it as I type this message. I guess I got lucky because it is not overly salty at all. I did use a little more cabbage than the recipe called for and because it was pre shredded for slaw it also had some carrots but it tastes wonderful!

Any miniscule liquid was burnt after half an hour, leaving a cold pork in a slow cooker. Broth or water should be added, which I did. At the end, I omitted the cabbage, poured bbq sauce over it and called it southern Hawaiian food.

We absolutely love this meal. Instead of adding the cabbage into the pork I use some juices and saute it on the cook top and serve it separately (my son doesn't like the cabbage). This is one of our favorite meals. We serve it over rice and soy sauce.

Great alternative to traditional Southern BBQ.  I also approximately doubled the seasonings and reduced the salt.   I cooked the cabbage separately using the fried cabbage recipe here on AllRecipes.  Would be great with mashed potatoes but we are doing low carb.  Delish!

My daughters and I lived on the Big Island of Hawaii.  We all loved seeing how the pig for Kalua Pork was cooked on an underground pit with banana stumps and t leaves.  This was a good recipe.  It was as close as you're going to get without killing a wild pig and digging a large pit.  Mahalo!

We lower the pepper amount a bit, and use chicken thighs instead. A regular recipe for this ohana. My husband said this reminds him of Lei Day as a boy when they would have a luau afterwards!

It is extremely bland and boring, with the cabbage giving it that disagreeable stewed cabbage odor. Everyone I served it to ended up dousing it with soy sauce at the table to make it palatable.

I've tried a number of recipes for kalua chicken and this was far and away the best - as judged by me, my husband, and both teenagers.  I made it the night before (and the aroma DID awaken two members of the family).  I turned it off in the morning and skimmed the fat in the afternoon, before turning it back on and adding the cabbage.  The only change I made was to slightly reduce the salt and slightly increase the amount of ginger relative to other ingredients, per other reviewers.  We had the leftovers on sandwiches - usually at this point everyone adds BBQ sauce to my leftover pork but most of us ate it just as it was.  Yum.

Holy salt buckets!  We love the flavor of this but the salt was over the top.  After reading the reviews I did half the salt using 1 Tablespoon of Kosher salt and it was super strong, even for this salt loving family.  I think I will just try a teaspoon next time.

This was excellent.  I never modify the ingredients in a recipe the first time so that I can experience the dish the way the poster intended.  The next time I make this, I won't change a thing.  A lot of people said this was too salty but I thought it was just right.

I followed the recipe except: I first seared the pork, cut it in third and used fresh ginger.  I guess I should have cut it up then seared it but that's not how it happened.  It turned out wonderful and my husband ate too much.  I will definitely make this again.  Thanks so much!

The pork came out super tender and juicy. I didn't use liquid smoke (substituted with a smoky spice mix I got from Trader Joes) and the pork came out tasting bland, so next time I'll try liquid smoke and maybe add more spices.

I served this with white rice cooked with a miso broth. This turned out amazing. I cooked the cabbage in the broth of the pork so it soaked in the flavors.  Family loved it!

I made this in the last couple weeks 3 times my boyfriend loves loves it.  This is his favorite meal now.  I used the low sodium soy sauce, about a tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce since we love it so much, a couple tablespoons of minced garlic and a cup of low sodium chicken broth.   I throw it in my instant pot for about a hour and 45 minutes high pressure.   Once it finished I throw the cabbage on high pressure for 2 minutes.   Absolutely amazing our favorite recipe.

I used a boneless pork I already had. I decided to omit the salt all together (glad I did) and next time I might use low sodium soy sauce. However, having said that.. I took this to a pot luck. Everyone loved it and all 5lbs were gone. I used no sauce, bun, or rice. I will make this again for sure. Great flavors!

The seasonings were spot on unril you got to the kosher salt. Instead of using the 2T of kosher salt , I only used one. I wanted to slice an onion thin and add but forgot to do it.  I think I'll do it next time I make it. Easy recipe!

I created this in my Instant Pot (pressure cooker) and wanted to update for those who might want it in less than an hour.  I used a 1 1/4 lb boneless pork loin, half a head of chopped cabbage and added an 8 ox potato with the skin on and diced large.  Trimmed the pork and followed the recipe.  I used hickory smoke flavor.  Set my IP on meat for 55 min and used quick release since we were hungry.  I had a friend over and she had 3 servings.  My husband raved about it.  No leftovers!  I'd keep everything the same but would add as much cabbage as my pot would hold.  It really shrunk down in the cooking.

I only gave it 4 stars because I changed the recipe a bit by adding a banana with peel on the top, doubled the ginger and cut the salt in half as other reviewers suggested.  With the changes it is a 5 star recipe.  I also soaked the cabbage in the juice after it was cooked which gave it a buttery taste.

I don't have liquid smoke so I added hoisin sauce instead, used squeeze ginger in the liquid sauce,  and I added 1/2 cup of chicken broth.  Turned out great. The islander wife said it could use a touch more soy sauce.  I served on Hawiian buns and topped with a dab of hoisin sauce. It was amazing

This was delicious and so very easy!  I made it for my family, along with the Old Fashion Potato Salad (on this website), Sweet Hawaiian rolls, corn on the Cobb and baked beans.  It was a huge success!!!

Did not like this at all and will not make it again. Very greasy and salty. Hoping I can salvage the meat and somehow use for something else.

I made this for a Hawaiian themed Christmas party for college kids.  They loved it! Some asked for the recipe and some offered to help me out by taking the leftovers home with them. The only change I made was that I forgot to shred and add the cabbage. I had cooked the pork the day before and then put it in crock pots to reheat it on party day, but I completely forgot the cabbage.  Next time I'll try to remember it!  Now I need to find something to do with those two heads of cabbage in my refrigerator ...

If I could give this 10 stars, I would. I made it exactly as written, no added water or anything. I was skeptical putting that big pork shoulder in there with no added liquid, but when I came home, it was soaking in awesome juices. It reminded me of the pork I had in Oahu when we went to an authentic Hawaiian restaurant.

Halved the salt because everyone was talking about that.  Probably needed more than half.  I liked this recipe.  I got lazy chopping the cabbage and made it in bigger chunks.  Should've cut thinner or shredded.  I think maybe a little more liquid smoke could be used but that is my thought.

I thoroughly enjoyed this recipe. I read the other reviews & chose to cut both the salt & soy sauce by 1/2, I doubled the Worcestershire and ginger & added Orange Peel. I only had a 4lb roast which cooked in 8 hrs. Was tender, juicy, full of flavor. Served with cabbage & baby new potatoes! Looking forward to making it again.

This recipe was soooo good!  My whole family absolutely loved it!!!  I made the pork shoulder in the crock pot as directed.   I had my son get the cabbage and he came home with a 4-lb head of cabbage!  I quick steamed the cabbage in about two inches of chicken broth in a separate pan, right before serving.   I sliced the cabbage up by cutting it first in have and then slicing it in 1 inch pieces and I put those in the pot of steaming chicken broth.  It took just 5-7 minutes before it was crisp cooked and ready to serve.  I didn't add any extra salt in the cabbage as the review said it was "salty".  I also quick cooked some red potatoes cut up and some fresh green beans as another side for this.  Again, no salt added just in case the meat was really salty.  We lifted the pork out of the crock pot and pulled it in a baking dish.  Then we poured the juices into a measuring cup so we could sparingly add it to our dish, as needed.  Wow!! what a hit.  And even though it was a slow cooker dinner (usually reserved for winter meals) it was a nice and refreshing meal even for 90 degree weather.  Will definitely make again.   It was so delicious  we even enjoyed it as a leftover meal..

It was incredibly dry, even though I doubled the amount of sauce.  Also, there was no real flavor.   Waste of time and money.

I made this last night and it was phenomenal! So easy too! I did not use any cabbage   Instead, we used cole slaw and Hawaiian buns and had sliders. I also made black beans & yellow rice to go with it. A definite recipe to make.

This recipe is really great!  The whole family loved it. It was so tender and flavorful. I used hickory smoke in mine. I followed the recipe exactly but after I put the spicy rub on, I Iet it marinate for about 30 minutes before turning the heat on. I will make this  a standard way to make pulled pork! Thank you for sharing this!

I think I will make pulled pork like this from now on. I only had a three pound pork shoulder and omitted the cabbage because I decided to make coleslaw instead. I thought I had adjusted accordingly for the salt (2tsp)  but it was still too salty. I think if you use regular soy sauce the salt may not be necessary or add to taste after shredding. I served the pork on sweet buns with Swiss cheese and dill pickle slices. Yum!

I doubled all the seasonings. Our kitchen was mostly moved to our new house so I had to babysit the pot on the stove all day but it still turned out very tender and very moist and flavorful. Very inexpensive to make.

I made it for Father's Day for my friends Husband and Dad and they all went back for 3rd'shift and 4th's!!! I completely omitted the salt but used the soy sauce with salt and used boneless under the shoulder roast that were equalled about 5 3/4 pounds because we adjusted the recipe to 15 people instead of 10 and it was PERFECT I followed it accept that I used the boneless roast's & added a little extra ginger & smoke since using boneless roasted I needed a little water but we will be making this several times in the future!!! THANKS FOR POSTING!!!!

This recipe is pretty Good! I worked in Hawaii  for a stint and this was pretty close to what I've ate on the island. Made a few changes- doubled the soy sauce  Worcestershire and liquid smoke and added around a cup of Budweiser  beer which gave it a Lil more flavor. Also added shredded carrots  to the cabbage.

Kudos!!!  I have to admit...half-way through the cooking process, I said to myself, "Hey, I know where this is going!"  So, I added 1/4 cup packed brown sugar, 1/2 cup of my homemade golden plum sweet BBQ sauce, and 4 tablespoons of Yashidas sauce.  Then, I replaced the top...and waited...and waited. To make a long story short, the cabbage tasted like it had been bathed in butter, and you'll all have a hard time keeping pieces in a fork. I served it with a blend of Brown and Basmati White Rice, with chopped sweet onion, using vegetable broth, 1 teaspoon each of Better-than-Bouillion chicken and beef (doing this makes the greatest pork flavor goin') as the moisture (not water!)  OMG!!!   
The following day, I added 1 tablespoon each of McCormick Smokehouse Maple, and Vanns Spices Harissa.  Heated it back up in a smaller crockpot, added sauteed sweet vidalia onions with brown sugar to caramelize'em, then served this onto Onion Hamburger Buns, with shredded Mexican blend cheese, with a spread of mayonaisse/honey mustard/sweet basil/worchestershire sauce, and lettuce.
After the tears and the folks could talk coherently once again, they just stared at me and asked, What was that?"  I told'em what it was and where to find it.  Get ready gang.  Keep yer spats straight.

This was really great! I wasn't able to find a bone-in pork shoulder, but the boneless worked out just fine. I also added a little less cabbage because I had a smaller cut of meat, but I would add more next time. I have already shared the recipe with some of my family to try!

I made it according to the recipe. With it just being myself to cook for, I was able to freeze the remaining portions for lazy days. It's a wonderful dish and can stretch the budget for 1 or 2 people.

I very much enjoyed this dish. I cut down on the salt by half and added a bit more of the liquid smoke. Once the roast was done cooking I put the cabbage in put I noticed it took more than 30 mins for the cabbage to soften so I let it cook longer. In the meantime I did a taste test and decided to add some water to help with the cabbage and in addition I also added some crushed pineapples to the mixture as well. I knew that it would give the dish a sweet taste to balance out the smokiness(which I was totally correct). After everything was done I put it on hot dog bun and squeezed some bbq sauce on it and I can say that it was amazing... It tasted wonderful before I added the enhancements but i believe I made it better... Also the water does make it soupy so don't add too much but I believe it is necessary to help the cabbage soften.

I browned my roast, cuz I always do.  I was afraid about not adding any liquid so I had chicken broth close by, but never used it.   I clamped down the lid tight on my crock pot and ended up with an absolutely wonderful, moist, tender and tastey roast.  Not only did we have it for dinner, but we are using the leftovers for spectacular sandwiches!!!

This is super easy and inexpensive. I only use 1 tablespoon of salt, otherwise it's too salty.

Didn't like this. I followed the directions and found it dry and tasteless.

Loved this pork and also used other advice as well. I'm fairly new to using a slow cooker and wasn't sure if I was supposed to use water...but I put water in the slow cooker anyways...came out good both ways. preferably with no water since the fat of the pork just juices it right up.
