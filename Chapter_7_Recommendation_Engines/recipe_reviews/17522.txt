This was seriously good. I used 1 cup of red lentils, and 2.5 cups of vegetable broth in place of the water specified.   I also used half a white onion, half a red onion, four cloves of garlic, and during the last five minutes, wilted fresh spinach directly on top of the lentils, along with the remaining salt, pepper, cumin and garlic specified in the recipe.  Got rave reviews from vegetarians and meat-eaters alike.  Excellent recipe!

I have been making this for a few years and love it every time. I always use fresh spinach and substitute chicken broth for the water. Very tasty!!

This was very good. I doubled everything except used only one onion and used chicken broth for half the water. I also added 3/4 c. finely chopped carrots in the last 15 min. (b/c mom always did) and added fresh spinach in the last 5 minutes of cooking. I suggest doubling this to serve four as a main dish. (Hubby and I had little leftover) Awesome, thanks!

Like other reviewers, I used 1 cup of lentils and 2 1/2 cups chicken stock. I also added the cumin at the beginning to the onions to develop the flavor. Added sliced carrots during last 10 minutes. Used about 2/3 bunch fresh spinach and wilted in pot. Also added pinch of nutmeg with the spinach and flavor was incredible. Serves 4 over rice. Very filling and a different flavor to help shake up dinnertime. Meateaters won't even notice it's vegetarian it's so hearty. Will put in my dinner rotation.

Delicious!  I was a little skeptical about the other reviewers' suggestion to double the lentils (I do love my spinach), but I decided to use the full cup anyway.  Definitely the best ratio!  I also added a can of diced fire-roasted tomatoes and used red lentils.  It's actually quite pretty with this mix.

Loved this....I didnt want a soupy dish...and I followed my fellow AR recipe exchange friends advice and left the amount of water the same....glad I did because the lentils really needed it to cook properly. I wasnt left with much water and I drained off the rest. I sauteed my onion and garlic in evoo, added my baby spinach (I had 2 6 oz bags), wilted that down and then added the cumin and red hot pepper flakes. Scrumptious! Will make again!

This was a wonderful meatless dinner. The only thing I did differently was that I used fresh baby spinach instead of the frozen but everything else was the same. I served this over rice with a nice crusty bread and white wine. Next time I will add some diced carrots or diced red peppers with the spinach.

Delicious and nutritious, not to mention inexpensive! We added carrots to the recipe. I'd recommend perhaps doubling the amount of lentils. The boyfriend would like to add more salt to it, but I thought it was perfectly salted and seasoned. No longer must I envy the cooking aromas of my Indian neighbors.

It is very difficult to find meatless dishes that both my husband and I can agree are delicious.  This one is fantastic and filling.

This is a great start but it needed some doctoring to create a main course meal.  I made the recipe as described, except I used broth instead of water as recommended.  I decided to taste it before I served it.  As a side dish it would have been fine but it was my main course and therefore a bit on the bland side.  I added to taste: extra cumin, garam masala, celery seed, ground mace, granular garlic and cayenne pepper.  It was better but still needed something else, I added 2 tbsp of butter and about a 1/4 cup of cream.  That made the difference.  I also served it over wild rice for extra texture and as one other reviewer recommended, a dollup of greek-style yogurt on top.   YUMMY!  I tend to like food with complex flavors, so I usually go heavy on the spices.

Delicious. I sauteed the onions and garlic with sliced carrots and mushrooms while the lentils were cooking. Threw fresh spinach on at the end to wilt it and added a little turmeric. Thanks!

This dish was very flavorful.  I doubled the lentils and used 2.5 cups homemade chicken stock instead of water, and also added a can of diced tomatoes.  An added bonus: this dish was very cheap to make and I had almost all the ingredients in my cupboard!

I thought this was a delicious dish.  It was very easy to make.  I would serve it over rice next time as it was a little dry over baked potatoes.  I added fresh spinach instead of frozen & it cooked down in just a few minutes.  I would definitely recommend this meal!!

I coincidentally made something very similar to this on a whim last night (before seeing this recipe) and I thought I'd share my version. I used green lentils, olive oil instead of vegetable oil, fresh kale instead of spinach, added a few slices of diced eggplant, and added coriander. I sauteed the eggplant, onions, red bell pepper, and (last minute) kale separably and stirred them together with the lentils and spices once the lentils were finished. Finally, I used this mix to top some left over dill mashed russet potatoes. My husband ate seconds and didn't complain about eating the same thing 2 nights in a row! :-)

I'm a busy college student on a budget AND trying to be healthy-- this was AMAZING! It reminded me of a dish I ate in Spain with garbanzo beans.  The smell of it made my roommates want to try it and before we knew it, there was hardly any left! 

I made a few changes:
I used 1 cup lentils, 2.5 cup veggie broth, and just 3/4 white onion.  When I cooked the onion I added the cumin, I used frozen spinach, and I added half a can of diced tomatoes (avoiding the juice- wanted it to be more stew-like).  Add more water, broth or tomato juice if you want it more soupy.  Make sure that the lentils are soft when you add the spinach.

Easy, relatively fast to prepare, tasty, and good for you... what more can you ask for? I didn't change a thing, and served it over brown rice. Wonderful! I'll be making this often.

It’s a good base recipe but I had to add a lot more flavor to mine (~ 1 tsp. curry paste, 1 tsp. turmeric, 2 tsp. tomato paste, a few vegetable bouillon cubes) to flavor it up a bit. I will make this again but will continue to add the extra ingredients. I would suggest for people trying this out to following the recipe and give it a taste test mid way through to see how you feel about it and then add any extras if you feel it’s needed.

I loved this recipe, although I did make a few changes. Like others, I used 1 cup of red lentils, 2.5 cups of chicken stock.  I also added to the onion 1/2 each red and green bell peppers.  I also used about 8 oz fresh spinach instead of frozen, adding it right at the end after the lentils were tender along with 2 fresh chopped tomatoes!  For a little heat drizzle with Srirachi hot sauce at serving.  Yum!  Thanks for the recipe.

Good base recipe that invites you to play with it! As other reviewers suggested I used one cup of lentils and 2 1/2 cups of chicken stock.  I also added one 14 oz. can of diced tomatoes with liquid and added fresh spinach during the last ten minutes of cooking.  Beefed up on the cumin and added a pinch of cayenne. This was very good and made for great lunch leftovers the next day even without  any rice or potato added.

I found this recipe while looking for a low carb recipe that incorporated lentils and spinach and the end result was very good.  I even had my 7 yr old and BF try it and they both thought it was good, and neither of them are really very health conscious!  :)

This was a really nice dinner. Note that I did change the recipe a bit: doubled the lentils (red), added a Roma tomato, some diced celery, and two small spoonfuls of medium salsa. My husband and I had it with a side of steamed red potatoes, baby carrots, and broccoli as well as some green olives (I'm an addict of those things!). I cooked this until most of the water was gone. My husband thought it could use a little more "bulk" but I would make this again. :)

Tasty! Simple ingredients and very easy to prepare. I love lentils so next time I think I'll try adding just a half cup more of them.

This is such a great "cozy" dish! My family loves it and I make it often. I can't believe more people don't serve it with naan, though... To me, that's what makes the meal. I used everyone's suggestions. The extra lentils, the chicken stock, diced tomatoes. We love this!

Have made this several times, its always delicious.  I use less water and fresh spinach and just serve as a side dish instead of over rice.

This was good and hearty. I used vegetable broth in place of the water, maybe 1.5 onions, more cumin, and fresh spinach. My boyfriend and I both really enjoyed this served over a baked potato.

Wow, this was SO good!  I added tomato, and brocoli, just because I had it in the fridge.  It was delicious... my daughter, who is picky of course, loved it just as much as I did!  Thanks for sharing!

He was a bit skeptical about the flavor combination, but we liked it quite well.

Great when I added sliced carrots  in the last ten minutes and served over a diced baked potato. I also added a few tablespoons of lemon juice in the last five minutes. Perfect!

Really easy and really delicious. This recipe handles throw-ins really easily, so it is great when you have various odds and ends in the fridge when you want to use up. I added in some leftover homemade marinara, a bit of canned corn, and some fresh zucchini and carrots. Delicious served over rice.

This makes for a wonderful vegetarian meal high in fiber.  I used yellow onions and added in 1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon Harissa paste for some zip.  The spinach was defrosted and excess water removed then added to the lentils the last 10 minutes of cooking.  This was served over steam brown rice with cornbread on the side.

blah and bland.  my Rx:  used veggie stock instead of water.  Doubled garlic cloves.  Added matchstick carrots.  Then it still seemed to be missing something. Added garam masala and served with a heaping dollop of plain yogurt.  Much better.

I loved this and would have given it 5 stars but my husband didn't care for it. Mainly because he doesn't like the texture of lentils but he said the flavor was really good.  I took advise from other reviews and made it with 1c lentils and there was still moisture in the pan so I'm glad I took that advise - I wouldn't have wanted it too soupy.  I also added a can of diced tomato, that tasted excellent along with all the other ingredients and seasoning.  I will make this from time to time, it's a nice healthy meal even if my husband has texture issues :)

Good idea, thank you. Did alter a bit. Used quick cooking brown lentils, and a load of fresh spinach, and added a chicken stock cube. The spinach only needs to be washed, chopped, and then wilted in, a few moments before serving. DO NOT DRAIN, the liquid is nice, especially over rice.

Sooo good, really.  We used this in phase 1 of our South Beach Diet.  All the ingredients were on the "okay to eat" list.  And I think the complex carbs from the lentils gave me a little extra energy I really needed. Hint: use fresh spinach! Just prepare as directed on bag before using in this recipe.

This is a delicious side dish. The only changes I made were that I used fresh spinach instead of frozen and I doubled, or tripled, the amount of cumin.

Very very good food.  It won't necessarily be the big "wow" dish you serve to guests, but it should be.  It is delicious, nutritious, vegetarian, and very versatile.  It just isn't very impressive on a plate, no matter how you dress it up.  But we eat it regularly because we love it, and it is highly forgiving and versatile.  Sometimes I don't have fresh spinach, so I've used kale (not as good, in my opinion).  I serve it always with naan (mostly homemade, but during the week I have to cheat sometimes).   This dish should get  more respect!

LOVE this!  Here are the adjustments I make after having made it a few times:
- double the lentils
- use 2-2.5 cups vegetable or chicken broth instead of water
- use fresh spinach (put in at end) instead of frozen and let wilt
-add a can of diced tomatoes about halfway through cooking of the lentils
- if I have it, I add cilantro when I add spinach

Omg, this is delicious! Based on my taste and other reviews, I doubled the lentils, used chicken broth instead of water, added a can of rinsed and drained diced tomatoes, baby spinach, cilantro, and red pepper flakes! So incredibly good!

My husband and I LOVE this recipe and my kids like it well enough to clean their plates!  I add carrots the last 10 minutes, substituted some chicken broth for some water and serve over a bit of rice.  Fantastic meatless dish and makes great leftovers.

Like most others, I tweaked this to our taste. 1 white onion, 1 cup red lentils, 3 cups chicken broth, 1-teaspoon Sri Lankan Curry powder and two large andouile sausages sliced 1/2 inch. Threw it all in a crockpot on high for 3 or 4 hours.

Very easy recipe. This will be a new favorite! I used vegetable broth- 2 1/2 cups and added extra broth near the end. I also used 1 cup of lentils and fresh spinach and Swiss chard from our garden. I cooked the greens while the lentils were simmering, squeezed all the water out of them and then chopped them. This was my lunch today also. Great recipe!

Delicious Vegetarian/Vegan meal!  I mixed in about 1/2 cup cooked quinoa and ate as a main course.  Very healthy and satisfying.  The lemon really brightens up the cumin.  Will make again.

My family loved this! I served it over quinoa.  Minor changes to suit our family's preferences where 1) Increased garlic to 4 cloves 2) Increased liquid to 2.5 cups and used chix broth instead of water 3) 3/4 c chopped carrots added at the last 15 minutes of cooking 4) Used 3/4 c fresh spinach added at the last 5 minutes of cooking.

This dish is very yummy I agree. I substitute the spinach with fresh kale (remove the stems). I allow the kale to wilt in the pot about 15-20 minutes before it is done. This dish takes a lot longer to cook than recipe says. It usually takes me close to an hour, but is worth the wait.

Really good! A healthy, filling, inexpensive meal!  Made it just as written, and really liked it :)  A little bit of cinnamon might be a nice addition.  Yum

This was good, however not great. I added a bunch more veggies, cauliflower and carrots. I also added tomatoes. I used a bit more spice with cumin, garlic and I added a pinch of fresh rosemary. That really made it aromatically appealing. Served over brown rice and it was quite a hearty meal. Plenty of left overs for lunch the next day for both of us.

I followed this recipe exactly and it was pretty much tasteless.  The only thing I really tasted was the cumin.  I wish I had read and taken the suggestions of some of the reviews.  If I was to make this again, I would definitely use chicken stock instead of water.  I would probably use a bit more garlic and salt.  I had to add way too much salt to make this dish edible as it is written.  It is a good base recipe but needs much doctoring.

Very good! I too used 1cup lentils and I'm glad I did. I also added about a tsp each of Tumeric & Garam Masala to give it a bit more indian flavor. I also added 3 chopped tomatoes. This is so yummy & easy to make!

Its true, it doesn't look like much, but the flavors all together are amazing. We had it served with baked potatoes and while some people complained it was too dry for that, we thought it was great! Also great with a drop of sour cream or greek yogurt on top.

Very good dish.  I just eat it by itself, no rice or potato necessary.  I have made a similar recipe on this site,  Fried Onions and Lentils.  I sprinkle  cinnamon on the onions as they are cooking, and put the cumin into the water the lentils cook in.  I also doubled the lentils for a better ratio of spinach and lentils.

We had this as a main dish, served over white rice & it was pretty good!  I loved that it was pretty inexpensive & healthy too.  I did use 1/2 chicken broth in place of water & Im glad I did.  I will make this again, probably as a side dish next time.  My husband & daughter said it was great as a main dish.

I just made this for dinner tonight and it was DELICIOUS!  I wilted fresh spinach on during the last 5 minutes of cooking, as suggested by previous reviews, though I definitely could have used almost double the spinach that I did.  I also upped the amount of lentils to about 3/4 cup, and dissolved just a 1/4 of a vegetable bouillon cube into the water for some extra flavour without adding too much sodium.  I seriously cannot get over how amazing this was!  I will definitely be making it again soon!

This was more flavorful than I expected, and it was very easy to put together. However, it was a bit soupy; if I made it again, I'd decrease the liquid (I used veg broth). I used fresh spinach, and I caramelized the onions in coconut oil while the lentils were cooking. The recipe doesn't specify which type of lentils to use--I used brown, but I think red would work better with the extra liquid.

I wanted to eat in a hurry and used this recipe as a base. In a splash of olive oil I sauteed 1/2 yellow onion with some dried minced garlic union opaque. Added 1 can of lentils and about 1/2 cup water, cumin, curry and sea salt to taste. Added in a few grape tomatoes, rinsed a handful of fresh spinach and wilted down in lentil mixture. All was done in 10 minutes. It was AWESOME!

The recipe idea was great, however it took a lot of extra seasoning to make it taste good. I used vegetable broth instead of water. I added mrs. dash regular, celery seed, cumin, white pepper and a red onion to pep up the flavor. After that it was a huge hit. The original recipe just needs some polishing.

I enjoyed this recipe a lot. I added a little celery with the onion and made it a little thinner with extra water. I found a sprinkle of parmesan cheese adds a nice finishing touch.

This is okay.  Not sure if it's a keeper yet...I want to see how the flavors meld overnight.  I used 1 cup lentils with 3 cups water and 2 veggie bouillon cubes.  After cooking it down a while, I decided that it was going to be a little on the bland side for me.  So I added extra cumin, coriander, cayenne, and curry powder.  Could be used as a base; then I could add tomatoes; or peas instead of spinach.  Update:  the flavors did not get better.  I'll try it again once more, but no hurry.

This is a great vegetarian side dish. I used chicken broth in place of all the water. It was delicious. It would also be a great main meal, served over some brown rice, maybe with some tofu. Yummy, Indian comfort food.

This was delicious and beautiful. I used miniture yellow lentils and they cooked a lot faster, so just be careful to watch the cooking time. The combination of the green spinich and the yellow lentil was really stunning.

This was pretty good and hearty.  My husband liked it!! I also added some crushed red pepper and chili powder to the seasonings and I served it on top of cous-cous and toasted pita on the side.  I'll definitely make it again, but I'll add some bacon or proscuitto in with the sauteed onions, and also top it all with some Raita (Garlic Cucumber Yogurt Sauce) with the toasted pita.  Really quite satisfying and also extremely cheap to make, which is great for those on a tight budget!!!

The soup was great.  I cooked this in my pressure cooker for 10 minutes, with 1 cup basmatic rice and 3 potatoes, cut in large chunks.  I added carrots, mushrooms and several colors of bell peppers also when sauting the onions.  I added some soy sauce, salt and about 1/4 cup of ketchup also to add more flavor, into the pot of lentils.  I also added about 4 cups of extra water to make this a more brothy soup.  It was WONDERFUL.

This is a VERY tasty recipe. I served it over rice. Watch the cooking time, though...after 35 minutes, all the liquid was abosrbed. I may try soaking the lentils before cooking next time.

I must have done something wrong. It seemed really bland after it cooked, so I tried adding a bit of garam masala to it. Then a bit more garlic.  Alas, the garlic gets stronger as it stands, so be careful! It ended up an ugly-looking dish that my husband and son, who do like spicy food, turned their noses up at. I should try the coconut version on this site next because it sounds more like what I was hoping for.

I found this to be incredibly delicious! My food aversions due to my pregnancy have left me with very few meals I can eat. I figured I would give this a try. This was simple to make and such a budget-friendly meal. Only difference I made was to add about a two tablespoons of canned tomato sauce. Delicious! Thank you!

This dish is excellent! I followed the suggestions of others and used chicken broth instead of water and doubled the lentils. As I had fresh spinach, I used that, supplemented with frozen. I will definitely be making this again.

I added extra cumin, vegetable broth instead of water,  and used red lentils and brown lentils.  It was a hit!

Delish! I've been trying to eat more vegetarian meals. This is a great main dish. Added some grape tomatoes to individual servings to just  warm a little. Adds a nice sweet tang.

I know people dont like when we change a recipe and then rate it based on that... but I am recording my changes because they made this dish AMAZING! As is, it was delicious and a really great start. I added a little more cumin, equal amount of turmeric, garlic salt, and salt. 

Then when I served it, I added a spoonful of sour cream and topped it with slices of hard boiled egg. It was SOOOOO GOOD!

I loved this! I skipped the oil (to save calories),  doubled the lentils, spinach and cumin, added a few teaspoons of chicken bullion in place of the salt and added a few teaspoons of curry powder. Super easy, super healthy and super delicious!!

This was slap me silly good! The only thing that I did different was to add a teaspoon of ghee and I used himalayan pink salt. In addition, I used shredded carrots with a pinch of cayenne pepper to give it some heat.  It turned out fantastic and I am looking forward to digging into it.

I really liked this.  I did half chicken stock, half water.  I added a tbsp. of garam masala, threw some fresh spinach and chopped grape tomatoes on top, and tossed in some chorizo.  I might leave out the chorizo next time.  This dish has so many possibilities.  This will be a go-to for me from now on.  Yum!

I am not a big fan of Indian food but this adaptation was done nicely... It was delicious on the rice I have made. My vegetarian step son liked it too, he came back for second helping.Tasty, healthy, easy... What else would I ask for? I will definitely make it again.Thanks bobawood :)

I made this with Sally's Spinach Mashed Potatoes and put the lentils on top of that and my wife and two young girls liked it a lot! The lentils by themselves were not my daughters cup of tea but with the mashed potatoes, they gave it a thumbs up!

Great gluten-free dish with lots of fiber! Like some other reviewers, I used fresh spinach.  It wilts nicely over the lentils at the end. Healthy and delicious!

I have made this dish several times....super easy and very tasty. Just make sure to add enough sale. My now one year old loves this dish. I didn't add tomatoes, but did put frozen as well as fresh at times spinach in at the last 10 minutes...came out wonderful.

I felt this was flat in taste. I reduced the cumin and salt, however I ended up adding some garlic salt and Adobo seasoning anyhow. I used 1/2 of a 1 lb of fresh box of organic baby spinach and red lentils. I am thinking the recipe called for green lentils or another type. Mine were mush in 20 minutes. It almost looked like mashed beans and spinach. It worked fine for lunch and fresh. Just hope last couple portions are not wasted.

Added chopped carrots with the lentils and diced tomatoes 15 minutes later.  Let the luquid evaporate (once the lentils were nearly done) most of the way before adding the spinach.  Served over short grain brown rice with lima beans.  My spinach (and lima bean) crazy daughter was in heaven and neither hubby nor I missed any meat.  Delicious.  Can't wait to make again!

I liked this recipe a lot.  I doubled the cumin, used fresh spinach (I didn't cook it before I added it, just added it to the pot and put the lid on, and stirred it a couple times until the spinach wilted), and added a can of tomatoes at the end.  I served it over smashed cauliflower, which I've never tried before, and it was absolutely delicious!  I would definitely recommend that to pair this dish with!  It's not a super exciting dish really, but somehow it was just REALLY good.  I think there is probably a lot you can do to add/tweak this dish to make it a little different if you want, too.  I definitely think the tomatoes were a good addition, and adding Rotel instead would probably be a great idea if you like a little spice.

This is the first lentil dish I have made.  It was pretty easy to make.  I do agree with everyone on doubling the lentils or if you don't want to make a lot, 1/2 the spinach.  I will probably make this recipe again.

This is really yummy! Even my mom, who hates lentils with a passion, likes it! I sometimes mix it up a little by adding a bell pepper and only one onion. It's really good. We usually serve it with rice.

"This is actually pretty good," said the man who usually chokes down lentils just to be polite.  I thought it was better than good.  I used the suggested 1 cup of lentils and 2.5 cups of broth, and made sure my onions had caramelized before I added the other ingredients.  Added 1 cup diced carrots towards the end, then wilted fresh spinach into the mixture, along with 1/4 cup julienned sundried tomatoes.  I even used the full amount of cumin called for, although I usually go easy on cumin in other recipes.  Served over brown rice accompanied with naan bread (recipe from this site).  I wish I had leftovers!

This is one of my staples. I always add a lot of cumin, turmeric and curry to give it more flavor and use fresh spinach that I throw in at the end to wilt it. Very hearty and healthy!

I make this all the time and follow the recipe as written, though I sometimes mix things up and use fresh spinach instead of frozen. You may consider serving over quinoa instead of rice. Additionally, I add a small spoonful of sour cream and whatever hot sauce I have on hand.

I made this tonight for a Syrian friend. He loved it, as did my husband. As suggested, I substituted chicken broth for the water, and steamed fresh spinach (because I had an abundance.) VERY tasty. Will definitely make it again.

My first time cooking lentils. These were sooo good. Very easy recipe. Great for "meatless Mondays" at my house! I used fresh spinach, wilting it in another skillet before I added it to the lentils.  Excellent!

I was confused making this- I didnt realize it would be a bit soupy.  Was scared to try it cause it didnt look as good as the picture, but it was amazing.  I added a lot of salt though (I love salt!) and I only used one onion because two just seemed like a lot.  Next time I make it Im going to try using more lentils and maybe chicken broth with some meat in there to make it a bit more! :) Thanks for the recipe.

Surprisingly, husband and I both loved this. Very filling. Took suggestions of other users and doubled lentils and chicken broth. I also threw in a little bit of quinoa, and then used fresh spinach at the end. I upped the cumin to almost a full tablespoon, added a dash of nutmeg and cayenne pepper for some kick. DELICIOUS! We added feta on top but honestly it wasn't even needed!

Excellent! Really enjoyed this! I did use chicken broth in place of the water and 1 cup of lentils instead of the 1/2cup called for. :) I love lentils and always enjoy making them new ways! Thanks for sharing! :)

Would have been 5 stars if I'd have used fresh spinach. Blended 1/2 mixture up in my VitaMix to make it a little soupier.

This is seriously, surprisingly delicious. So much more than the sum of its parts. My first experiment with red lentils, and I made the same mods as most reviewers re: amt of lentils, broth, added can of diced tomatoes. The leftovers were even better.

Deeee-lish!!  This was so tasty!  Both my husband and I kept saying mmmm after every other bite!
I only made a couple changes/add's... I Added a cup of diced HAM!  I bought a ham steak with the bone in it.  I diced the ham and set it aside, except I put the leftover BONE in with the lentils while they simmered. I threw the ham in during the last five minutes of simmering.  I also added 2 stalks of celery fined chopped for flavor.  I then diced up a couple of fresh tomatoes and sliced a couple of green onions and sprinkled them on top as a FRESH garnish. YUM!  I served the whole thing over whole-grain rice.  I can't wait to make this again!!  Oh!  I also used FRESH spinach.  I just tossed it in during the last minute of simmering.
Thank you for this DELICIOUS Recipe!!!

I REALLY screwed this up, but it still tasted pretty good.  I can't imagine what it would taste like if I hadn't messed it up, but I'm guessing it would be great.  (I forgot to turn the heat down when I was simmering it.  It got a bit burnt).

Added a cup of lentils to the original. Also, added dried parsley, and 2 boxes of frozen spinach. 

Covered over rice and a side of cornbread!

This was very yummy!  I used fresh spinach instead of frozen and also left out the salt because we're watching our sodium intake.  It wasn't as good the second day, but it was a tasty and healthy quick dinner that I'm sure I will make again.  I served it over leftover mashed potatoes because I already had them on hand, but next time, I think I'll try it over rice.

Delicious! I have probably made this 10 times since first finding it but have forgotten to rate. 

The only things I changed was instead of using water, I used chicken broth (or chicken buillon) and added a lot more of each spice and garlic. I also doubled the lentils.

We eat it with rice and yogurt. Yummy!

This recipe is exceptionally good! My first time making lentils and it was a success. I didnt have all the ingredients so I had to improvise a bit. I subbed with olive oil, red onions, garlic powder and threw in fresh crushed tomatoes. I used cumin but I also used chicken bouillon packets and a little cayenne. I added fresh spinach at the end. Delish!

I followed the suggestions of several other people. I used fresh spinach instead of frozen. I just sauteed it in olive oil, onions, and garlic for about 10 minutes before I added it to the lentils. Also, I threw in a can of fire roasted tomatoes. I drained the juice from the tomatoes into a measuring cup, then added vegetable broth to make 2 cups of liquid - I used the mix instead of water. I also used olive oil instead of vegetable oil and I added the cumin, salt, and pepper to the lentils while they simmered for 35 minutes. We ate it with white rice. It appealed to everyone from my picky 4-year old to my co-workers who are considerably better cooks than I am.

After reading the reviews, I had high hopes for this recipe but did not care for it AT ALL!  Nor did the rest of my family. :(  I used vegtable stock insted of water and fresh spinach as many reviewers suggested this. It got off to a good start w/ the sauted onions and garlic but took an fast plunge.  the lentils cooked up great but th falvor was ... not good.  Perhaps I'm not a cumin person but have never disliked it till today.  Good luck!

This was delicious and very healthy!  I used fresh spinach, I just put a few handfuls into the pot a few minutes before the lentils were done.  I also added some thinly-sliced carrots.  The cumin is a must, don't miss out on it.  I was too lazy to grind my cumin, but it still came out great.

This is FABULOUS. Reminds me very much of Indian food, which I love. Only changes I made were to add red pepper flakes for some heat, I used low-sodium chicken broth instead of water, and I sauteed one green bell pepper with the onion since I had it around (I don't think the bell pepper added anything but extra veggies can't hurt). Served over brown rice. DELICIOUS. I will definitely be making this again.

I was looking for a good recipe with lentils and I love spinach, but I dont love this recipe.  This one had great reviews. I tried it...following the suggestions (only 1 onion) and even doubled the rest of the recipe.  I threw it over some rice.  The one onion alone added too much to the taste.  It wasn't that great.  I might suggest throwing some meat in w/ it, but thats just a guess I have because I dont like it enough to try that out.  I wont be making this one again.

This is a lovely recipe. It's warming and filling and the aroma alone will make your mouth water. A few changes I made were: I was out of Onions so I used Leeks instead, I added more water because I wanted it a little more "soupy", and I added some cardamom because I find it goes well with cumin.

a delicious vegetarian dish!
definitely make sure the onions are nice & brown, this adds wonderful flavor. I too, doubled the lentils (I used red) & used broth in place of the water & then omitted the salt. I used a bunch of fresh spinach instead of frozen & served with warm whole wheat naan. 
thanks -it was DELICIOUS!

AWESOME!!! I really liked this recipe and will definitely be making it again! I took the advice from other reviewers and doubled the lentils and used chicken broth instead of water. I also diced up a couple of potatoes and threw in. Served with Basmati rice, it was an amazing and flavorful dinner! Even my picky toddler ate it!

Very tasty and quick & easy to make.  My toddler just loves this with rice.  I use less garlic and I use garlic powder.  I also use fresh spinach and put it in with the lentils for the last 5 mins of cooking until the spinach wilts.
Thanks so much for this wonderful vegetarian recipe.

Great recipe, really tasty. I doubled it as someone else suggested, and now I have plenty of leftovers. I threw some chopped tomatoes on top to add a fresh taste, and they complimented it nicely. I used fresh spinach instead of frozen, just throwing it in in the end. I also may have added a bit too much water as it was a little runny. It was a little salty as well, and really only needs half of what the recipe calls for. I'll also throw in some sauteed tofu next time, for an amazingly healthy and tasty main dish.

I took the other suggestions and it was exactly what I was in the mood for!  I substituted a 28oz can of tomatoes, added a can of spinach, a tsp of chopped garlic, and lots of cumin.  It took quite a while (over an hour) for the lentils to soften, but it was worth it.  Yum!

It came out really well, and my family of meat eaters were pleasantly surprised. I used 1 cup of lentils which is the right amount, vegetable broth in place of water, chopped up a few baby carrots and threw them in, also thew the spinach in during the last 10 mins of the lentils simmering (because 1 pot is better than 2 or unnecessarily using a microwave). I put the dish over a Black and Brown rice I prepared. Dish was easy and delicious, clean up was easy.

I used 1 cup of lentils and 2 1/2 cups water as others have suggested.  I also used 2 tsp. of cumin instead of 1.  I spooned it over brown rice and added one Roma tomato, cut in bite-size chunks to my bowl.  I served it with homemade yogurt.  It was fairly good but I enjoy it more left over for lunch than supper.  It's nice to have warm leftovers during this busy season.  Done like this it is vegan.

I doubled the lentils, used vegetable broth instead of water, and used fresh spinach added at the end.  I really liked this, and will make it again.  I will try with carrots and celery next time, and probably add a bit more spices.  Next time will serve with naan or put in it a pita for lunch.

I've been making this for years. Some changes I sometimes make. Add bell pepper, celery and/or carrots at the beginning.   My kids don't like chunks so sometimes I hit it with a hand blender before I add the lentils.  I've added stewed tomatoes. I always add lemon juice at the end. Always use chicken broth. I love it poured over a slice of Swiss cheese.

Very delicious and very easy. I made it with some of the reccomendations of the other reviewers:  Doubled the lentils to 1 cup  and increased the seasonings: 2 tsp of cumin , 1 tsp of celery seed and 1/8 tsp of cayenne (I also soaked my lentils for a half hour before I cooked them up) .  This dish will become a standard in my kitchen - Thanks!

I made this as written except for using fresh spinach. 
It definitely needed something so I added a packet of bovril/OXO chicken stock, red wine vinegar, diced tomatoes and cilantro. I will definitely make this recipe again with the changes made.

It's a good recipe. I'm not allowed to eat spices like cumin so I changed the flavor profile a bit but the base recipe is solid. I was looking for something to bring to work for lunches. I found that doubling the lentils as some comments suggested turns this into more of a full meal which was more food than I intended. Especially when I served it over rice. I also took AllRecipe's suggestions and cooked it in broth instead of water. I didn't need to add salt at all.

My one suggestion would be to not trust the time it takes to cook. I set a timer for 20 minutes after moving the lentils to simmer and went back. They had absorbed all the water and overcooked. I fear what would have happened after 35 minutes! I'll definitely make this again but keeping a close eye on my lentils.

This was fantastic.  I made it for my vegan niece that was staying with us (swapped the veg oil for olive).  Used 2 large yellow onions, doubled the lentils, cumin, and garlic. Added a tsp of turmeric, used fresh spinach, and veg broth instead of water.  Added a can of diced tomatoes half way through cooking time.  It was so good I made it for hubby and I and added sausage.  Flavors are out of this world.

I made this as-is the first time and really liked it, but felt it was better the second time when I wilted fresh spinach into it in the last 5 or so minutes of cooking the lentils instead of using frozen spinach. I felt like the frozen made it a little mushier than it should be.

Fantastic!!  I ended up  adding 1 cup of lentils and 4 cups of vegetable stock.  I also, as per other reviews, added one diced carrots and one diced yellow pepper.  And I doubled the garlic, since we all like garlic in my family. Such a great recipe.

. I was very happy with this recipe. I wasn't sure what to expect but the fact that it used a whole bag of fresh spinach was awesome! I took some of the other reviews and added the carrots, the nutmeg and used the fresh vs frozen . It was very good. I wished I had some crusty bread but I don't normally eat bread but it surely would have complimented the dish. Would be good when its cool out as it is hearty !

Added a couple of large dollops of curry paste while sautéing the onions and garlic, replaced the water with veggie broth, doubled the lentils and broth, and ate over white rice with chopped tomato on top. It really hit the spot! Good stuff!

This was outstanding! It’s definitely worthy of the rave reviews. I made some substitutions based only on what I had on hand. I used diced red onion that was leftover from yesterday’s brunch, as well as diced yellow pepper because I didn’t want it to go to waste. I used homemade chicken broth instead of water as well since I always make lentils or rice with broth instead of water. Finally, I used fresh spinach because I had some leftover from the farmers market. I just added it in the last five minutes and wilted it down. Everything else I kept as is. The final result smelled amazing cooking and it tasted great. Cheap, tasty and healthy! I do recommend doubling the recipe if you plan to eat this as a main dish. I halved the recipe intending to have a little leftover for lunch, but I definitely could eat it all in one sitting.

This recipe is a keeper!  My son recently became vegan, and he loves it.  Myself, as a meat eater, I think this is a great recipe!

However, I amped up the ingredients.  The lentils come in one pound bags, which = 5 cups.  So, I use the whole bag, and use 10 cups of vegetable broth (actually 8 cups, or two boxes of veggie broth, and 2 cups water.  What am I gonna do with leftover two cups of veggie broth, right?)  Then, I add several chopped carrots, and some chopped celery right at the end of the sauteing the onions/garlic.  I also use 10 oz fresh spinach rather than frozen, and just toss it in.

Also, like another reviewer suggests, I used two onions:  one sweet and one red.

Wonderful!  It's a meal in itself.  This is really really good.  And  be careful, my modifications make a LOT of lentils, so be sure to use an 8 quart pot or bigger.  The leftovers get devoured, so you can get many meals out of this.

I used at least a quart of vegetable stock to make this dish more flavorful, and added more as needed to make the consistency of a soup.  This has been a great option for both vegetarian and vegan guests.

WOW! like other reviewers, I added 1 cup of lentils (green), some red onion, carrots, subbed 2 cup water for chicken stock and 1/2 cup water (ran out of chicken stock). 

definitely had to go heavy handed with the seasonings and it is ESSENTIAL to add minced garlic for the final product! happy plant based cooking!!

Great vegetarian dish -- I substituted shallots for the onion and added a handful of (blanched, skin removed) grape tomatoes. I hate to waste food and had about a dozen of these little tomatoes that the skins were beginning to shrivel so why not add them to the lentils -- turned out to be a nice addition. I also used fresh spinach which I did not saute but  julienne cut the fresh spinach adding it to the hot lentils just before serving.  To plate the dish I reserved some large spinach leaves to make a nest  adding a nice scoop of lentils to the center of the spinach nest then topped it off with a healthy sprinkling of  fresh Parmesan cheese.

I combined two different recipes to get the pot I desired. I added sweet potatoes and carrots to the dish along w fresh basil and oregano. I added crushed peppers for more spice. Very delicious I must say.

I've made this a number of times and love it! 

This last time I made two changes - I added spiralized carrots - great idea! and I used frozen spinach instead of fresh - bad idea! Stick with the fresh spinach, the frozen really changed the flavor. :(

meh. I thought this was decent-after I remembered to add extra garlic at the end. It was really bland to me. I even made it with chicken broth instead of water. After tasting it, I ended up adding the extra garlic it calls for, some extra salt, and a tsp of garam masala blend.  I served this over rice with diced tomatoes and a scoop of plain Greek yogurt. I may try this again with some bacon added.

I took this to a potluck the first time I made it (I know they say don't do that!). Anyway, several people commented to me how much they liked it, and appreciated having a vegan dish. I only had one medium yellow onion, and since I did not have cumin, I used ground coriander and a little chili powder. I did find it a little too watery, so next time I will reduce the water.

I made this several times and I always change something.  A must adaptation is to double any spice and exchange some type of broth - vegetable or chicken for the water.  I also love to add diced tomatoes and cracked red pepper.   I have a habit of making extra bases and sauces when I cook, labeling and freezing them.  Once I added to this a cup of sauce from the shrimp fra diavolo recipe here and 4 pieces of cooked chopped bacon - it was amazing.

Mine wasn't so soupy as cover photo. It was delicious! I used one large white onions instead   of two medium. Only used the 3 garlic cloves, didn't add any more at end. 
Served over quinoa. Topped with crumbled baked bacon and fresh tomatoes. 
It was delicious!! I will definitely make this again!

I added 1 cup lentils and 2.5 cups water and after simmering for 35 mins there was hardly any water left. I had to add more water. The soup didn't have much flavor, it felt like it was missing something. If I made this again, I would use vegetable broth instead of water.

I gave this recipe 4 stars because I think it might be a bit bland had I not followed the additions suggested by other reviewers. As they suggested I used (veg.) broth instead of water, I used fresh spinach instead of frozen, I added a can of fire roasted tomatoes as well as adding cumin and garam masala. My masala was a bit old and therefore weak so I also added "curry" powder. With these additions my dish wasn't bland at all, it was amazing! Vegan ,fat free and still satisfying. With these suggestions in mind I will definitely make this again, soon!

Very good. Quick and easy.  I added some diced sweet potatoes and carrots to it for body.  Then used fresh spinach, which I put directly into the pot to save time and dishes.  Definitely a keeper recipe.

This is delicious, but I am with the person who says to add a little bit of butter. For some reason, that makes a big difference. Yummy.

I really enjoyed this recipe.  I did make a few additions.  I added 3 chopped carrots, 1 chopped celery stalk,  and sauteed it with the onions and minced garlic . I added 1 bay leaf, and cayenne pepper for it to have a little spicy kick to it. I used 3 cups vegetable broth in place of the water.

I made this with canned lentils, shallots, and two cloves or garlic,  salt and pepper and a little bit of braggs nutritional yeast.  It was super yummy.  I am not even a vegetarian...I just like lentils they are my favorite bean.

Pretty good. I made this with green lentils  & used fresh spinach.  Will make again with 1/2c less water as the lentils turned a little too mushy.

My vegetarian boyfriend LOVED this dish. He requested this be on our regular recipe repertoire. I used only one onion, veggie broth instead of water, fresh spinach and half of the cumin.  It was great!

This is a very easy and tasty recipe.  I did make some modifications.  I increased the amount of lentils because it was to be a main dish for my family of five and I didn't think 1/2 cup would be enough.  So I made it a full cup of lentils and increased the liquid to 3 cups.   I also used fresh spinach instead of frozen and added in sliced carrots at the same time as the spinach, letting them cook in the lentils for the last 10 minutes.  I also added in curry powder with the cumin.  The dish turned out really well--I'll definitely make it again!

This recipe was quick and easy.  I used fresh spinach.  I cooked my spinach in with the lentils after the lentils became tender. 
This recipe had a nice flavor.  I would make it again.

Making it again for sure. After reading some of the reviews I decided to double the lentils and use the chicken stock instead of water suggestion. I added 1/4 cup of chopped celery, 1/2 cup of diced carrots, 1 diced tomato and only used half the onion because my boys are not fans. To change the leftovers up a bit I added slices of cooked chicken spinach and feta sausage. My boys paired it with warm tortillas because I can't seem to suppress the Mexican in them. Lol. Great recipe!

I should have read the previous reviews and used less water.  OK, because at the end of the cooking I left my pot uncovered to cook off most of the excess water.  Also, rather than Cumin I added 1 Tablespoon of Garam Masala once the lentils started to cook.  Like another reviewer I also added a can of diced tomatoes along with the spinach.  An easy, enjoyable side dish that we enjoyed with our dinner of grilled chicken and vegetables that were served with a walnut lemon sauce.

This was delish, however I did make changes.  I doubled the lentils and soaked them over night.  I used olive oil instead of vegetable, and added about an extra 1/2 cup water to compensate for extra lentils. I used an extra clove garlic.  I also used fresh baby spinach not frozen.

WOW!  I was looking for a lentil recipe besides the typical soup.  This was great b/c I had all the ingredients on hand.  It turned out so good.  I used coconut oil for the onions, used broth and water, upped the cumin, added tumeric (beautfil color), used fresh spinach, and added some carrots, too.  This was the main feature in our meatless meal.  Served with toasted pita bread and olive oil.  My husband and 3 boys all loved it.  They said it was exotic, but delicious. It was SO easy!
Update: I make this regulary, and when I do not have fresh spinach, I use canned.  You must put the canned spinach in for a longer time to get the canned taste out; it's the only way we eat canned spinach, actually.

I followed the recipe but didn't love or hate the dish.  It wasn't until afterwards that I remembered another review saying they used chicken broth instead of water.  I'm going to try this again using that suggestion to see if that will change my opinion.

This was super delicious.  Will definitely be making it again.  I doubled the recipe, used 1 tbsp, plus 1 tsp onion powder instead of onion (only because I was out of onion), chicken stock instead of water, and a 10 ounce package of fresh baby spinach/kale mix instead of frozen spinach.  The 10 ounces of greens in the doubled recipe was perfect for my family, although 20 ounces would've still be delicious.

Surprisingly good considering its simplicity. For me the best part was the onions, which I cooked slowly in 1 teaspoon ghee & olive oil until caramelized with a teaspoon of sugar. I used 1 cup red lentils (which cooked in like 10 to 15 minutes)and I only used water, no broth, 2 cups. Next time I want to try broth since it would most likely be better yet. Also used fresh spinach added at end and just wilted and served over jasmine rice - enjoyed it very much.

I'm not much of a fan of lentils, but since they are healthy and cheap I make them every now and again.  My family really liked this recipe.  I was surprised that I actually thought it was good, and I didn't just eat it because it's healthy.  My young children will eat it too- they don't love it, but they'll eat it.  

I followed other reviewers advice to use 2 1/2 cups of broth (not water) and 1 cup of lentils.  I also diced bell pepper with the onion and added diced carrots during the last 20 minutes of cooking.  It would be easy to hide other finely chopped veggies in this meal.

Enjoyed this dish thoroughly. Highly recommended. I didn't add any salt. I allowed the natural flavor from the onions and garlic to take over! Yummy

This was my first time using lentils and I really enjoyed it.  I'm on vacation and had no cumin or lively spices so this might be 5 stars if I had the right spices. As some others suggested I threw in what I had in fridge; 1 celery stalk, 1 carrot, and some squash. I soaked the lentils in a pot of water while we were gone and used fresh spinach.  I served it over rice and it was quite filling. My husband said it needed more salt, but I don't trust his opinion in that area.  I look forward to trying this again with more spices.

Pretty good.  As other reviewers suggested, I doubled the lentils and cooked in broth and added carrots and used fresh spinach.  I think this would be fantastic with cashews added in, it's really a very versatile dish.

This recipe was delightful! I have never cooked or eaten lentils before and found them to be easy to make and tasty. I used canned spinach instead of frozen simply because that's what I had in the pantry. I also substituted beef broth for water, left out the salt, added a can of fire roasted tomatoes and a dash of chipotle chili powder. It was filling and less than 300 calories.

Delicious and a big hit with my husband and son! I used 1 cup of brown lentils with 2.5 cups of chicken broth. I added some chopped carrot after 20 minutes of simmering and stirred in the salt, black pepper, cumin, some cayenne pepper, and the crushed garlic just before putting fresh spinach on top of the lentils to steam for the last five minutes. After the spinach was wilted I stirred it in and added about 1/4 cup of half-and-half to finish. I served this over brown basmati rice. Will definitely be making this again!

I'm sure the recipe was a good one, but I didn't like it. I'm new to lentils and looking for ways to make it. Love spinach and other ingredients, but just couldn't do it. I might try again, but not likely.

Outstanding! very easy to make. Made some quirky additions. The first bowl I prepared just like in the receipe and I ate it over sweet potato. The yam gave it an additional sweetness that was incredible. The next bowl (lol) I added parmeasn and feta cheese (cause cheese makes everything better!) and it was even better then the first bowl. Definitly a regular meal at my house!

It was quite good, made it with bullion and fresh spinach (not baby)--the lentils took much less than 35 mins to cook and become soft.

This was very good.  My husband even liked it.  I did use vegetable broth instead of water and probably doubled the spices.  I diced and threw in half a red pepper as well.  I also needed to add an extra cup of broth at the end to make it more smooth and creamy.

Great recipe overall! I customized this recipe the second time I made it, I added sliced hot dog and a scoop of white steamed rice and served it in a bowl.

This was good!  I added 1cup lentils and 3 cups chicken broth (instead of water).  Next time I may add more lentils.  With the amount of onions and spinach, the proportion was off for me.  Thanks for a great dish!  I also sprinkled feta on top which was an amazing addition to the dish.  I served this with Indian Saffron Rice from this site.

Loved this recipe. For a quick spin, I used 2 teaspoon veggie bouillon, added 1/2 cup quinoa & 1 additional cup water when I added the lentils, and 1 finely chopped cooked chicken breast,when I added the spinach. One-pot meal at its finest.

Seriously delicious!  Used fresh spinach instead of frozen, and added chicken boullion granules to the water, otherwise followed recipe to the letter. Added some Frank's Hot sauce right before eating!

Great basic recipe.  I used vegetable broth instead of water and added a can of diced tomatoes before adding the spinach.  Also a little more cumin then called for.  Served over rice makes a filling and delicious meal.

This was great.  Changed it up a little. Put 1 1/2 cups lentil, one big chopped onion, can of fire roasted tom., 32 oz. chicken broth, 2 links of chicken andouille sausage (sp?) (from Costco), the cumin, salt, pepper, smoked paprika, a little nutmeg, a little red pepper and a packet of splenda.  I think this comes out to about 5 weight watcher points + for @ 1 1/2 cup.

This is amazing! My alterations were minor. I upped the spices, added more vegetable broth at the end so that it became a soup (instead of using water at all), and added mushrooms. Perfect vegetarian soup!

I am doing a new diet where i could only eat fruits and vegetables for the first 10 days. So my options are limited. However i found this and my bf and I (both Meat Lovers) love this.  Thank you bobawood. 
Oh yeah, instead of the chicken broth i added half a chicken bouillon cube and frozen chopped spinach. I also doubled it to make leftovers for  lunch the next day.

Really, really delicious! I made a few tweaks, based on what I had handy, but overall I stayed true to the recipe and was very pleased with the final result. I used a large red onion as a sub for the two whites, used one cup of veg broth and one cup of water instead of two cups of water, cut out the salt (because of the broth) and dumped fresh spinach on top of everything during the last 5 minutes.

This is a great tasting and healthy recipe. I used fresh spinach and canned lentils that I had on hand, which reduced the cooking time significantly. I also added about 1 teaspoon of garam masala, a couple more garlic cloves, a half can of diced tomatoes, and a few glugs of chicken broth. Thanks for sharing!

This was pretty tasty, added fresh spinach and carrots. Something quick and easy to make. I doubled the recipe and had WAY too much water though, had to let it boil down quite a bit. I would add 3 cups of water only if doubling the recipe.

It's a good recipe. I didn't use as much garlic, but I might next time. I did add about 2/3 cup of white cap sliced mushrooms. It gave it an earthy flavor, which I personally like. It's a good healthy soup as long as you dont add too much salt as my mother was inclined to do. Next time I will subsitute the water for vegetable broth. I bet chicken broth would probably do ok to, for a saltier flavor.

Good.  This takes a while and isn't a good option for us during the week, but it was nice to have something healthy and relatively easy to throw together.  I doubled the lentils, so now I have leftovers for lunch tomorrow!

I made a few modifications to this recipe and the final product was AMAZINGLY DELICIOUS! I used 1/3 of a large white onion, 1 cup of lentils and 2.5 cups of vegetable broth and omitted the salt. I added a handful of chopped cilantro while the lentils were simmering, and added about 6 oz of fresh spinach and a chopped tomato near the end. I also added about 1/2 tbsp cumin powder. I might try it next time with a bit of turmeric and some chili powder. The final dish tasted great!

It's fine as is, but like most folks, I generally have to tamper.  I feel that the recipe is improved by the addtion of 1 tbsp. finely minced ginger and 1-2 diced jalapenos.  Or one serrano chile for the more adventurous.  The choice of fresh, canned, or frozen spinach impacts distinctly on this recipe.  Honorable people can disagree on which tastes best, so choose your ingredients accordingly.  Brand me a heretic, but I actually prefer canned spinach!

I was looking for a recipe for my frozen spinach and came upon this one.
Since I was in the mood for curry and we don't have a microwave, I only followed the recipe until step 3.  
Instead of putting the spinach into the microwave, I just added it to the lentil mix and then added curry paste instead of cumin and pepper.
DEElicious!!  Full-on taste!  Good enough to eat on its own!

This was really good. I didn't find it bland at all. I did add curry, turkey kiebalsa,fresh spinach and used chicken broth instead of water. It was very filling and just tasted healthy. I will make this again.

Eek.  This recipe was so bland.  I followed it exactly and actually had to boil the lentils longer because they were so tough still.  It would be better to cook the lentils first separately and then combine everything.  The curry was a great and necessary spice, and helped a tiny bit, but I was embarassed that I made such an awful dish for my boyfriend (who politely poured BBQ sauce on it and scarfed it down).

this was ok. I doubled the lentils and added more water.  It was pretty bland.  Edible but bland.  I probably won't make this again.

Very good - used fresh chopped spinach 5 min before lentils finished, added fresh chopped tomatoes a few minutes before serving.  Took a while for the water to cook down - was too impatient!  Forgot the cumin, but was still good.  Served with salmon.

I loved this! I followed every step exactly, except that I only used 1 large white onion...I served over rice with steamed baby carrots on the side. Delish! Will definitely be making this again! Thanks for sharing...

I will definitely make this again. I was very pleased, but I thought it could have a little bit more flavor. I might see if I can come up with more and/or different spices. I will also add more vegetables as recommended and make a meal with this.

To the creator, thank you.We tried this with the comments added by the other user (with the carrots and the chicken broth). It was very delicious and filling, though I would cut back on the salt if you use the chicken broth. Highly recommend this dish for a cool autumn day.

Not bad...I found it quite bland. Definitely needs more flavour. I might try adding a can of crushed tomatoes next time.

This was great and was very easy! I used Garam Masala instead of just plain cumin to add a little sweetness to it, and had it with some basmati rice. Overall with the rice it was two very full meals.

I absolutely loved this recipe.  It was a lot of fun to make (I was on the phone the entire time, teasing a good friend about the smells), and kept very well.  It tastes so fresh and nutritious!

Excellent-- I will serve this often on Fridays in Lent as a meatless alternative. I served it over wild and brown rice.

My husband and I LOVED this recipe. I served it with a broiled salmon filet and a glass of Pinot Noir. The only change I made was to cut the amount of spinach in half. It seemed like too much spinach and not enough lentils. I am looking forward to having the leftovers for lunch and might double the recipe next time.

I enjoyed this but would add more spice next time - I followed the recipe exactly and think it needs more cumin or some cayenne pepper...not sure what.  Served it topped with a baked salmon fillet, great meal.

Husband loved it (especially on a baked potato).  I thought it was gross.  I might try it again with fresh spinach (I had used frozen).

I suppose it's just not to my taste, but I did not enjoy this recipe at all.  I thought I would like the combination of flavors, but it really turned me off.

Quite tasty! I had to add more water part way through the 35 min. simmer as it had dried up prematurely!  But, easy to make and VERY GOOD on the baked potato!

I made this for Mum and myself, and we both loved it. I added some ground nutmeg, maybe a teaspoon or so. The day I made it, we just had it by itself, and the next day we had the leftovers with couscous, fried onion and fried aubergine. Next time I make it I'll double the lentils (I love spinach, but everything in moderation ;-)) and garlic, and serve with couscous. The spinach really seems to absorb the seasonings, so do add loads and loads of pepper!

I really enjoyed this recipe. I had never eaten lentils before. Yummy! And the spinach turned the rice green which was fun as well! I added a dallop of butter on top and enjoyed the recipe very much!

Pretty good.  This has a little bit more spinach than to my liking, but nice flavor - I served with cornbread.
