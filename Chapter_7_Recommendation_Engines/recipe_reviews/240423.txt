I didn’t use the cream of chicken soup. Trying to keep it healthy, I used a3 Tblsp of butter instead and cooked the farro in chicken broth.  I al so added some broth to the kale as it was wilting.  Other than that great recipe.

I just made this tonight, and the whole family LOVED it. I substituted brown rice for farro, because it’s what I had. No changes otherwise, and this recipe is definitely being added to our dinner rotation!

Made it with all fresh ingredients except for the cream of chicken and instead of chicken, added tofu.  Also added onions, dill, oregano, dash of cumin, and a bit of thyme. Delicious.
