I substituted broccoli, cauliflower, and carrots for the sweet peas, because the people I was serving it to didn't care for the sweet peas.  They loved it, great recipe.

Giving this 5 stars because I did follow the dressing directions, completely, and it's GREAT! However, I did add some chopped sweet pickle, red pepper and minced onion along with the peas.  Served it over fresh spinach leaves and sliced tomatoes.

We enjoyed this salad.  I cut the mayo to 1/4 cup and used fat free yogurt in place of the sour cream and it was still very good.

Excellent recipe!  Made this for Mother's Day and my mother wants the recipe.  I added more peas than called for because I love peas!

I used Fat Free sour cream and may (which was great!) and I added 1 lb cooked shrimp (not mini, but smaller in size) to make it more substantial.  It was realllllly good!

I liked the sauce fine, but in general, I do not care for frozen peas.  I think that I might try it with my favorite can peas.

I liked it OK,  but it was a little much on the dill.  I added some small chunks of sharp cheddar cheese and liked it better that way.

I liked the spicyness that the horseradish added. I added salt, chopped onion and chedder-chesse cubes. I also left out the dill because I didn't have any.

This is one heck of an easy and tasty recipe. I didn't measure everything precisely and used dried dill rather than fresh at a ratio of 3:1, meaning that I had to estimate what 1/3 of 1/4 of a cup looked like. I just shook the dried dill into the 1/4 measuring cup until I thought it looked 1/3 full. I shook maybe a half tablespoon of sugar into it too to give it a little sweetness. Tasted excellent. I couldn't wait so I ate about half of the batch by myself. Oops. :)

My wife rated this A+ which she never does.  OK, some prep remarks.  I used frozen peas and put them in a colander under cold water for 3-4 minutes.  Then placed them in a bowl with paper towels to wick away the moisture fro 10 minutes.  Mixed the sauce and mixed sauce and peas together.  I used dried dill for the sauce and garnished the completed peas with home grown dill; did not want to use up all of our garden dill.  VERY easy recipe, fun to put together and works with any basic meal: had meatloaf and mashed potatoes along side.

A lot of flexibility here to add your own ingredients and put this on a lot of different things, from veggies to fish, or as a dip.

I made the recipe exactly as written and the combination of horseradish and dill was very odd, not tasty at all.

Growing up, I ate and loved my mom's pea salad so I had to try this spin on it.  It was a little lacking as written, but has a lot of potential.  It may be what I'm used to, but this screamed out a need for cubed sharp cheddar and a couple of hard boiled eggs.  There was too much dressing without it and the salad needed more than just peas.  I bought one of those small .25 oz  containers of fresh dill and it didn't yield enough so I had to supplement with dried.  This requires at least .5 oz!  Next time I will increase the horseradish.

Underwhelmed by this... only additions I made was to add some diced red pepper and red onion I had on-hand to give a little crunch... I love peas and the dressing is great - I did not use all of the dressing on the peas or it would have been swimming in it (instead I used the dressing on lentil burgers - great combo!)... When mixed together though they both just lost their flavor... I don't think I would make this again.
