I exchanged shredded cheese for the bacon, but everything else was the same as far as salad ingredients. It was beautiful on the table. Served with fresh bread (from my bread machine). Very impressive, and served 4, with leftovers for another 3! Making it again for a picnic so we have something for the healthier eaters (it's a community picnic where almost everyone brings fatty foods). This dish is a show stopper!

I made adjustments, but still gave the recipe 5 stars because it's a great recipe as a single entree.  I replaced the green beans with asparagus, seared the salmon instead of grilling, used more salmon because my family loves protein and the salad was the main dish,  added avocado, served the slide with cilantro lime dressing since some do not like mayonnaise.  I served the dinner with bread and a basil butter from Allrecipes.com.

I made it exactly as written and it is fabulous!  I layered the ingredients in 4 mason jars to take for lunch.  The salad stayed fresh and all my coworkers ooh’d and ahh’d at how great it looked in the refrigerator!

Was pretty good, will make it again, but will leave out the green beans and use less dill and more garlic in the dressing.
