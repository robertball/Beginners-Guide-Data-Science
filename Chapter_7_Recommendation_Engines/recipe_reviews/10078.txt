This is a great recipe. I had leftover ricotta cheese from the Christmas holiday and was looking for a recipe to use up the cheese. WOW. What a good cookie. Don't forget to add the baking soda --- this is left out of the directions. Thank you Carmen

These are the absolute favourite cookie in our house. I only use fresh made ricotta and sometimes add pecans or walnuts for a change. They are quick and easy and don't last long!!

I'm sorry I wasn't that crazy about this cookie. Didn't like how they were so soft the next day and there really wasn't enough fruit and nuts in it.

I modified this and used butter flavored shortening plus I used only chocolate chips instead of fruit and nuts. Still tasted good kinda like a muffin top.

These were nice cookies. I hadn't use ricotta in my baking before so I was skeptical but am pleased with the results. I added in more walnuts to use up what I had (about 3/4c) and skipped the pecan and in future I would also increase the fruit and make sure it is more finely chopped - I found that compared to the number and size of the cookies there wasn't enough fruit to go around with some cookies getting none and others getting a big clump. Will make again.

I made this cookie with leftover Ricotta Cheese. Very soft and chewy. I made a few changes. I used margarine instead of butter used dried cranberries instead of candied fruit and used pecans in the recipe along with on top. I also dusted them with powdered sugar when they were cool.
