I don't know if this is a twist on french toast as the submitter states or a another twist on classic peanut butter and jelly - either way it's pretty good.  I just love peanut butter and if there's a different way to eat it, I'll try it.  I used whole grain bread though this was delicious.

Yum!  This was so easy and a nice change from regular french toast.  I'm on a health kick, so I liked the inclusion of peanut butter for protein, and the jam in the center allows me to eliminate all that sugar from topping it with maple syrup.  I used whole wheat bread, and it turned out very moist.  This is quick enough to whip up even on school mornings.  I only got the recipe last week and I've served it twice already!

Excellent for those cravings you get when you're pregnant, but no one else seemed to like it.

This recipe makes you wonder how you never thought to make this before.  My son is the biggest peanut butter and jelly sandwich fan ever, and I knew that this recipe would be perfect for him.  He loved it and requests it often.  I made a couple with strawberry jam, and a couple with blackberry jam. Both were great.  This is a great breakfast for the kids before school.

This is one of our favorite breakfasts. I like to use whole grain or whole wheat bread and I don't use sugar in my egg wash. I will use vanilla and a little orange juice, though. My kids like this best with peanut butter and syrup instead of peanut butter and jam.

Peanut Butter Jammies ROCK!!!!!!   This was a very tasty and different breakfast.  This is a quick and filling meal. I put too much jam on mine and made it too heavy to flip but, it was still great!  There are so many things you can do to this to make it even better, I added honey and cinnamon to mine and next time I think I'll try it with Marshmallow Creme! Thanks Rayna!

My daughter and I loved these.  I used blackberry preserves on mine & my daughter chose grape jelly.  Both were delightful - we'll make these again!

This was good! I wanted something 'different' for breakfast and this fit the bill perfectly. I just ate mine plain, but I think it would be great with a dusting of powdered sugar. Also, I think next time I may add a little cinnamon to the egg mixture for more of a kick. All in all, a nice change that I will definately make again! Thanks for sharing. :)

Wasn’t a fan of this. The jam made it too soggy. The peanut butter was great though! My fiancé took one bite and spit it out because it just wasn’t right.. It needs something else. But we both agreed the jam wasn’t good with it.
