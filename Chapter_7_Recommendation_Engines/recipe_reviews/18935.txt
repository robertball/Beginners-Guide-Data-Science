I made this punch recipe for a baby shower.  Everyone loved it!  I mixed everything but the ginger ale together and froze it a few days before the shower. The day of the shower, I took the punch from the freezer about an hour before serving to let it thaw a little. Put it in my punch bowl and added the ginger ale.  It made a delicious slushy punch.  I will definately use this recipe again in the future.  Thanks for sharing!!

This is a great recipe!  I've made it twice now, with rave reviews both times.  It makes a LOT, so I've only made a half batch at a time.  I've used cherry flavored drink mix packets, and with the pineapple juice, the punch tastes like a liquid version of the 'Big Stick' popsicle sticks I used have as a child.  The first time I made it, I froze it (before adding the ginger ale) and took it out about 2 hours before my party.  Unfortunately, that was not nearly enough time, and the punch was still frozen.  So, my husband spent a while with an ice pick, chipping away at the frozen ice punch block.  The end result was a very nice slushee punch, which everyone enjoyed, but  I highly recommend taking it out at least 7 hours before your party.  That's what I did this last time I made the punch, and the result was perfect.   2/11/05 I'm amending my review.  I made this today for a baby shower (half recipe), and as another reviewer had suggested, I put only 1 cup sugar, 1 quart water, and 2 liters of ginger ale.  It turned out perfect!  That's how I am going to make it from now on.  Yummy...

Very easy and inexpensive.  We used this at a wedding last weekend.  Everyone loved it.  I have used more complicated recipes in the past, but will use this from now on.  I believe that you could experiment with different flavors of drink mixes in order to change the color of the punch.

Loved this punch! Made 1/2 recipe(w/ minor alters) & it filled 2 punch bowls full!  2 koolaid, 1 can pineapple, 1 1/4 c. sugar, 1 qt(4 cups) water, 2 liters ale. Mix sugar, koolaid & h2o then add juice.  Pour into ziplocs & freeze flat stacked in cake pan. 4 + hrs = slush. I "picked" ice to perfection right B4 party. Rave reviews!! Thanks

I made this punch for 2 baby showers, and it was a big hit both times.  I used cherry kool-aid instead of strawberry, and added a bit more water to cut the sweetness a little.  I followed some other reviews and froze the punch in multiple zip-loc bags, which made less thawing time.

This punch was absolutely wonderful!  My husband, who is not a punch fan, could NOT stop drinking it.  I took others advice and added a bit more ginger ale and a little less water.  It was great.  I will definitely make again!  I also added fresh strawberries to float in it and made an ice ring with frozen strawberries...kept it cold all day!

Absolutely Wonderful and Easy to Make!!! I made this for my sons 3rd Birthday Party.  We had 20 people here and I made the 50 serving punch.  It was all gone except for 2 glass fulls.  Everyone raved about how delicious it was and it is so simple to make!!! I will make this for all my functions from now on.

I used green lemon-lime koolaid instead for halloween, and it tasted really good.  It was so easy to make! I even threw in a few plastic spiders and snakes when I froze it and I placed a glow stick under the punch bowl that night for an eerie glow!

This is WONDERFUL! I received so many compliments on it and the punch literally disappeared in no time!  It was really easy to make then put in the freezer overnight.  The next day, I added the ginger ale as it thawed out so it was slushy by party time.  This has become a permanent recipe for me!

Used Fruit Punch flavor drink mix.  Made the punch for a Valentine's Birthday Party for young children.  Made ice hearts from heart shaped cake tin.  The kids and adults loved it and it was SO easy!

Excellent punch recipe!  I needed something quick and easy for a graduation gathering and figured I would have to settle for something less tasty for it to be less time consuming.  NOT with this recipe!  Many rave reviews and so simple.  This will go in my permanent recipe file!

This punch was great!!! I served it at a surprise party and everyone loved it.  It makes a ton so if you are only serving a limited number of guests I suggest modifying the serving size.

Made this punch the other night with a group of
ladies for a home show presentation. Everyone
loved it and commented on how delicious it was.
I used Blue Moon Berry Koolaid which gave it an
aqua-green color after adding the pineapple juice.
I used half the original recipe as there were only
about 12 people to serve, but many had several
helpings, and there was still a lot left over.
Glad I found this recipe.  Thanks.

This was an easy and tasty recipe!  I needed a non-alcoholic punch recipe and found this one on line. I got rave reviews from the crowd!  I doubled the recipe and froze it overnight, and it turned out fabulous!  This recipe is a keeper.

I made this as paort of my Thanksgiving menu. I wasn't too sure of it because my husband isn't a big fan of pineapples. I gave him a small tester glass of a batch I made and he drank the entire batch I made that night. I will be using this recipe again for my son's 2nd birthday party and maybe even Christmas. Definitely a keeper!

This punch was awesome. I had a very small birthday party for my four year old. we only had ten people I accidently made the fifty serving recipe but it did not matter that punch was so addictive no one touched the sodas I bought they just kept getting more punch. the only thing is it takes more than an hour to defrost i reccomend taking it out hours before the party.

I made this for a small semi-formal school banquet for about 40 students and faculty.  This was the perfect punch recipe for such an occasion as the ingredients we cost-friendly and there was plenty enough to go around, even for seconds.  I used strawberry Koolaid for the flavor.  It was delicious and everyone loved it.  It suited the occasion perfectly.  Thanks.. It's a Keeper!

This was a huge hit!  I served this punch at a baby shower and everyone commented on how much they enjoyed the flavor.  I did cut the recipe in half and altered it a bit.  I only added 1 cup of sugar vs. 1.5 cups, 4 cups of water, and an entire 2 liter of ginger ale to cut down the sweetness. Thanks for the great recipe!!!!

This was a huge hit! I was admittedly surprised. We only made half at a time though, as the we didn't have a container big enough for all of it at once.

I used this for a baby shower.  I halved the recipe and it filled up my punch bowl.  I used a little less sugar as suggested by others, but I think next time I will add the recipes recommendation for sugar.  It was good but needed a tad more sugar to offset the tartness of the pineapple juice.  Several people at the shower asked me about the recipe.  

Thank you Donna for a great recipe!

Easy and delicious!  For a baby shower I used blue drink mix to have a "pond" for tiny ducks to swim in...I forgot blue and yellow (pineapple juice) make green!  Still tasted great!!  This recipe is a keeper for me.

this was FABULOUS! i was in charge of my sorority sister's reception, and we decided to make this punch... we had to make two grocery store runs in the middle of the reception because people liked it so much! therefore, i recommend making more servings than you think - it disappears fast!

I had a baby shower at my house and I had a 7 year old help me.  Not only did she 
have fun making it everybody LOVED it.  I used it again at a bridal shower and froze it
a bit (to make it like a slush), now half my family has the recipe.

Ended up having to use fruit punch because I couldn't find strawberry.  This is a nice punch recipe and I'll make it again.  I made it for a baby shower and everyone commented on how good it was.  Only thing is that this recipe makes A LOT!!  I halfed it and we still had a ton left over.  If this is the only thing you are serving at your party it will be fine - but we had other beverages and had a lot left over.

Absolutely wonderful.  I didn't change one thing, and it's SO GOOD!  I think next time instead of using an ice ring, I'll do a sherbert ring to make it more of the traditional punch that I'm used to.  Thanks so much, Donna.  You saved me for my party today, and this punch recipe will be the one I use from now on!!

Easy is right! (I've also made this spiked punch with strawberry flavored vodka - yum!!!!) Make it following exact recipe and then try changes if you like later. I found that freezing the pineapple juice and fruit punch liquid in gallon sized freezer bags made it easy for me to travel with the punch to parties. I just put the filled bags in a foil pan and it's easy to place in freezer and take out and travel. If you freeze you will probably want to take it out of freezer at least 6 hours before party so that it wont be an ice block and will mix well with the soda. I've used 7up and ginger ale. I like this punch with the tropical fruit punch kool aid the best.

I made this at my son's 2nd birthday party and everyone loved it!  They said it tasted very 'Mai-Tai'ish.  I only had 10 people over so I made half the recipe.  I didn't serve it as a slush, but it was still very good.  I also cut the sugar by 1/3.  DELICIOUS!

I made this punch for an open house this weekend and it was a hit. Very easy to do, we kept everything chilled in the fridge and just made up as we needed. Just the right amount of sweetness from the pineapple juice but not overly sweet at all.

This punch is DELICIOUS! There wasn't a drop left and everyone asked for the recipe.  I will make this again!  I did use cherry kool-aid instead of strawberry and I halved the recipe.  Super yummy!

Easy and soooo delicious! I followed the advice of others and prepared everything but the ginger ale the night before and froze it. I took it out of the freezer and transferred it to the punch bowl three hours ahead of time, and added the ginger ale at the end. It made a great slushy punch everyone loved. The next time I tried it, I was looking for something more adult and added some coconut rum with the ginger ale. YOWZA! It was almost a little too good! ;)

I made this recipe for a baby shower and it got good reviews.  I used fruit punch rather than strawberry, cut the recipe in half, and used diet ginger-ale to cut some of the sweetness.  I ended up using double the amount of ginger ale for half the recipe. This recipe is versatile because you can experiment with different flavors.  I will probably make again.

A decent punch for a large crowd. I bought a package of frozen whole strawberries that I added and replaced half of the water with crushed ice.  I also spiked the punch with some rum to give it a more grown up taste. Next time, I'm going to use half strawberry and half raspberry for the powdered drink part to see if I can round out the taste a bit.

This is a great punch that makes LOTS! I halved the recipe and 3 Very full juice jugs(I don't have a punch bowl). It is a very sweet punch so when I halved it I only put in 1 cup of sugar instead of 1.5 but I did use 2L of gingerale instead on 1L. Great for a large crowd.

I never expected a punch that used powdered flavoring to be this good, but this punch was outstanding! We used some orange and pinapple mix in addition to just pinapple concentrate and it worked wonderfully.

Very good, but a little too sweet to drink too much of it.  Also, this definitely makes A LOT of punch.  For small crowds cut in half.

This punch was very easy and tasty.  I think when I make it next time, I'll reduce the water and increase the ginger ale.  It wasn't as "fizzy" as I'd like and this modification will solve the problem, I think.

I made this recipe for my Cookie Swap and it was a huge hit! My only regret is that I reduced the recipe to half because I thought 50 servings would be too much for 13 ladies. I was wrong- next time I will make the full recipe. Very good and I will be making again!

I made this punch for a Bridal shower and it was loved by all.  I used one of the suggestions to add less water and more ginger ale and it was wonderful.  I will make again!

Not great but not awful either. I made 1/2 of the recipe except added an entire 2 liter of gingerale. I think a different flavor of koolaid would have been better. The taste of pineapple was kind of strong to me. I added a tub of rainbow sherbert which seemed to reduce the pineapple flavor a little. I remember as a child having a similar punch that used orange koolaid that I really liked

So easy and loved by my coworkers and boss; in fact, it's the punch recipe my boss REQUESTS. (Unfortunately, that means the punch is always my responsibility!..)

For smaller functions it's easy to halve the recipe, but no matter what, DEFINITELY cut back on the sugar. Even using 1/8th of what's called for can be on the sweet side.

As another reviewer mentioned, if you freeze the mixture (everything but the ginger ale), the punch gets a slight slushy texture and stays cold longer without adding ice. (But, perhaps additional ice cuts back on the sweetness?)

In my area strawberry drink powder (aka Kool-Aid) is hard to find, so I use a tropical fruit mix instead.

Yummy! Seemed like it would be too watery, so Used half the water, and used the soda for the other half. Used frozen strawberries as ice cubes and was a big hit. Looked pretty too.

I made this last year for our halloween party and am making it again this year.  My tips:  Mix the kool-aid, sugar and water first then add other juices.  This way the sugar dissolves better.  Last year, I made the mistake of mixing it in the plastic cauldron I bought and the sugar went right down into the holes of the legs, so it wasn't sweet enough.  This year I think it is going to be perfect!

This is a great recipe...very affordable too...important if you need to serve a lot of people. I froze the mixture a bit and served it slushy at a Halloween Party. The kids loved it and several adults wanted the recipe.  Thanks for the recipe...definitely a keeper!!

This was a wonderful punch recipe and we had hoped for leftovers but it was gone long before the party was over. It worked well with my daughter's strawberry shortcake themed 1st b-day party.

Made this for a friend's wedding, about 100 people. It was easy, inexpensive and delicious. I had to transport it, so followed Phyllis' suggestion to freeze most of it ahead of time. I divided and put the punch mixture into Ziploc freezer bags and froze. Then, when it was time to serve, I left the bags out to defrost for a bit, dumped the semi-defrosted mixture in the punch bowl and poured the ginger ale over. Slushy yumminess! A huge hit with the happy couple and guests.

I made this punch last night for our Christmas Eve party. Some of our company showed up early, so, in a rush, I made the punch and forgot to put the water in it! :-o Everybody LOVED it. There was NONE left at the end of the night. It was very yummy, the kids were extremely hyper from all the sugar, so I would call it a success! :) Will definitley make again, and maybe I'll add some water next time!

This just tasted like fruit punch and it didn't have enough carbonation. I made it for a fourth grade graduation and it made a lot, but I'm going back to sherbet and ginger ale next year.

This was such an easy recipe to follow and use.  I upped the quantities to serve over 300 kids at their 8th grade dance, and they loved it.  I made the punch up ahead of time, minus the ginger ale.  Then, I poured equal portions of punch and ginger ale in the punch dispenser when we were ready to serve it.  We also had water available for the kids, which they drank too. 
These teenagers loved this punch so much that they drained my almost 10 gallons of punch - draining my punch bowl dry each time.  
What a hit! 
Note - we ended up using Fruit Punch Koolade, because we couldn't find any strawberry.  Still was a success!!!

Very good. I made mine and bagged it in ziplocs which didn't leak. I tried it with lemon lime soda and ginger ale, we definitely prefer the lemon lime soda.

This got rave reviews from a baby shower. I used less sugar then the recipe calls for, only a cup and a half of pure cane sugar and it was plenty sweet enough! This is definitely a keeper!!!

I made this for a small New Year’s Eve party and it was a huge hit.  I didn’t need quite the full recipe, so I used 3 pkgs strawberry Kool-Aid, (1) 46 oz can pineapple juice, a little over 2 liters of diet ginger ale, and approx 1 3/4 cup sugar.  Added just a little water, didn’t measure it.  It was refreshing and delicious.

This is one of My Grandmother"s punch recipes she use to make . And my Favorite! The only difference was she would Half the batch to freeze a ring of the punch then add it. And then the Ginger ale right before serving.

I don't much care for fruit punch, but made this for a beverage at a Taco Bar buffet. It was delicious. Believe it or not, I made it exactly following the recipe!. Everyone who tried it liked it. This makes a LOT of punch. I will make this again.

I've made this a few times.  It's always a hit during the holiday season.  As a few others noted, I recommend cutting back on the sugar some unless you want it to be super sweet.

My family really enjoyed this punch. I did change some things to make it more diabetic friendly and I also halved it. I used 2 packets of sugar free strawberry drink mix, 1 liter diet ginger ale, 1 qt water and 1 can pineapple juice to make 1 gallon. Very good, even with it being sugar free, it didn't taste like a diet drink.

I was not very impressed by this punch. I followed exactly (other than using less sugar as other reviewers suggested) and I still thought it was very sweet. Believe me, I've got a sweet tooth! Made it for a party with all ages in attendance, and it was the least used drink available. Don't think I'll be making this one again.

With a few twists this punch was a huge success!!! I couldn't find the Kool-Aid that it called for so I used kiwi-strawberry instead.  Also, since it was a hot day we added frozen berries and mango to help keep it cold.  Everyone loved it.

This was really tasty. just remember the solid ingredients settle at the bottom of the container if you don't drink it quickly enough so you will have to keep stirring.

Love this recipe! I'm in the Red Hat Society, as the Queen of the Chapter, I made this our "signature" punch ... except it's so easy, it's embarrassing to "give out the recipe", they all thought it was this complicated recipe. I don't freeze like other suggested, I keep chilled and assemble before Red Hat sisters arrive adding crushed ice. Been making for last 3 yrs at home events. Overtime, I have reduced sugar to 2c - 2-1/2c to help the ladies watching their sugar, and I use diet ginger ale.

I halved this recipe and it was perfect for my baby shower of 18. Like other reviewers said, mix everything but the ginger ale the night before and freeze it, then take it out about 5-7 hours before the event to thaw then add the ginger ale to serve.

Compaired to the recipe for punch I had tried at the same time this was the the second best. It tasted pretty good, but was still inferior to the orange dream recipe in flavor and ease.

I made this for a high school function.  Now I'm ask me to make it for every occasion.  I'm not a punch drinker... but this is really good!

I made this punch for my nieces themed Christmas birthday party.  It was a hit with the young ones and the adults. I received requests immediately after for the recipe.   I've used ginger ale for one party and 7-up at another.  Both taste just great!
