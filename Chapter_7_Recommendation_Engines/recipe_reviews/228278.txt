I made this using a lot less water, only 2 cups and didn't add ice, just refrigerated after making it. This filled up a blender. Start with 2-3 cups of water then add to taste. Very refreshing!

Had some very ripe cantaloupe and thought I would try this drink.  Very refreshing.  Will definitely be sipping on this in the warm weather.

I found this very refreshing! I did use about 4-5 cups of water, and that was plenty. Hubs added some liquor to his, and he enjoyed it that way as well!

I also used a lot less water, only two cups. I also used about half the can of milk. It was too sweet and took away from the  cantelope taste. I made into two batches.
