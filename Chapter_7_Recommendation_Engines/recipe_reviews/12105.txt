This was okay but I wouldn't rate it as worth making again. The flavor was quite nice but everyone agreed that all the marshmallows should be melted - the texture of the whole ones didn't fit the pie. Otherwise it was a fairly nice treat.

The pie tasted good but it looked like a reindeer threw up.

Based on the other review I didn't add the extra marshmallows in at the second step. The texture of the pie was nice and creamy and tasted just like Christmas! It made for a simple and yjmmy holiday dessert.
