I used buttermilk and I opted out of using blueberries in the actual waffle recipe only because I didn't want to clean up the mess of my waffle maker. I used Trop 50 orange juice in the sauce. Both the waffles and the sauce were outstanding.....my boys ate themselves silly and said this is my best waffle recipe EVER. The waffles turned out crispy on the outside and tender on the inside--perfect!

The sauce was great, but the waffles were mediocre. I did add 1/2 cup of sugar and 1 tsp cinnamon. That made a big difference. It sweetened the waffles just a little bit (enough to add a little more flavor).

I have made about 5 waffle recipes recently, searching for the perfect one for my new highly-rated waffle iron. I needed waffles that freeze well because I like to make a big batch and pull one out of the freezer everyone morning. I'm happy to say my search is over. I made this with chocolate chips and no sauce, but I'm sure it's great with the blueberries, as called for. Great hot and fresh, and great from frozen, too. Thanks, Wendy L!

The waffles were a 2 star but the sauce was a definate 4.5! I can't tell what made the waffles so mediocre. Maybe some vanilla and a bit of sugar would help? But the sauce was definately awesome. I also used frozen organic blueberries since the fresh ones are out of season. I will probably find an alternate waffle recipe but still use the sauce.

The waffles earned 1 star, but the sauce was outstanding.  My 19 month old loves blueberries and was eating the sauce by the spoonfulls.  Will definatly be making the sauce again, but will serve will different waffles or pancakes.

I didn't make the blueberry sauce as I felt like having syrup that day, but this recipe was VERY bland and dull.  Not enjoyable at all.  They also did not stay crispy once out of the waffle maker.  Sorry, not a keeper in my books.

The waffle has such a light and fluffy texture.  I made the batter the night before and stored in fridge so I didn't have to wait in the morning.  

The sauce is just perfect.  So thick and full of flavors.  Leftover sauce went well on yogurt as well.

This waffle recipe really has a lot of potential. After reading a lot of the reviews I added 1T of sugar to the batter. I did not want bland tasting waffles. I used buttermilk and I beat the heck out of the egg whites until it was foamy, frothy and stiff, about 2 minutes. I added the egg whites to the batter and then the fresh blueberries last. I folded the blueberries gently into the batter. I scooped portions of the batter onto my waffle grill and cooked until it was golden brown. I ended up with 12 waffles. The waffle is pretty with the blueberries cooked right in. Some were oozing with its purple berry juices right out of the waffles- nice. The waffles itself tastes good with the addition of the sugar.  However, I strongly feel that the star of this recipe is the blueberry sauce! It is perfectly sweet, with the right touch of honey and fresh blueberries. I love the addition of the fresh orange juice. The sauce is easy to prepare with a thick consistency. It is a smooth, beautiful purple blueish color. Next time I may need to double the amount of sauce because it was just enough for 4 waffles. The waffles with blueberry sauce makes for a really nice presentation. Based on the original recipe I give it a 3 stars rating while my family's feedback is a 5 stars. With the addition of the 1T sugar plus the delicious blueberry sauce everyone raved about, I feel it is more of a 4 star rating. I would make this again with my adjustments and even use the sauce for other recipes.

I did not have blueberries so I used cranberries.  This is a very good recipe.  Our waffle iron hasn't been out of the cupboard for over ten years.  It was good to use it again.  I can't wait to try the blueberry syrup and to make the batter with blueberries.  I will make a special trip to the store next time if I don't have blueberries on hand.

I have made this recipe twice now, once with the sauce and once without. My family loved them both ways.  I did increase the blueberries in the waffles to 1 cup.  Thanks for the wonderful recipe.

I'm only rating the sauce. I had a friend request blueberry cheesecake for her birthday and wanted to make a New York style cheesecake with a blueberry sauce that could be poured over the individual pieces rather than a traditional gloppy blueberry topping. Because it was going over a not-too-sweet cheesecake I added a tablespoon of sugar to the recipe to make it more of a dessert sauce. I used frozen Wyman's wild blueberries. It worked perfectly. I will definately make this again. Thank you!......Okay, I've made this numerous times and it is definitely my favorite cheesecake topping- I actually made a double recipe three times in four days! ( well, my doctor actually told me to eat cheesecake at my last visit-seriously)...every time I have made it with wild blueberries, EXCEPT this last time. Woah- what a difference. The regular blueberries were practically tasteless compared to the others. It will be wild or nothing from now on! Oh- and I always use fresh squeezed orange juice- no comparison there either. The best ingredients combined with an awesome recipe equals an addictive sauce. One of these days I have got to get around to trying the waffles:)

Used good ol' Bisquick for my waffles, but wanted to try the blueberry sauce-It was good, but not very blueberry-y.  We mostly tasted orange juice...

I made the blueberry sauce to go with the "Wild Rice Pecan Waffles" from this site. I added blueberries to the waffles as well. These two recipes are awesome. I highly recommend trying this combo. Thanks swizlesticks for an awesome blueberry sauce! I can't rate the waffles obviously so am rating it purely for the sauce.

Only made the sauce.  Very good.  Used on bob's red mill gluten free pancakes with blueberries mixed in the batter.  Might reduce OJ slightly.  Just a personal preference.

YUM. This review is only for the blueberry sauce- I didn't make the waffles. Anyways. It's good! It's easy! Make it! Next time I'll double the recipe since I was very, very sad when the sauce was all gone.

I too only made the sauce because I had planned on making blueberry pancakes-WOW the sauce is amazing, I didn't change a thing.  My husband loved the sauce on his pancakes, and we didn't use any maple syrup.  I have printed the recipe out, and will be sure to try the waffles  next time!  Thank you Wendy for sharing your recipeQ

I just made this for Sunday brunch and it came out wonderfully!  The batter recipe was very quick and simple and it cooked up really well in my Belgian waffle maker (I was pleasantly surprised, since the recipe that came with the waffle maker is complicated, takes over an hour to be ready and the resulting waffles were mediocre).  The blueberry sauce was quite easy and quick to make as well.  I served the waffles with whipped cream and powdered sugar.  Great recipe!

I have made the waffles twice now. Yum!  For the sauce I used  a bag of mixed (blue,black,straw and raspberry) berries. I didn't have  orange juice so I used a "tropical" orange drink.  My 8 year old initially refused to try the sauce.  Now I have been instructed to never buy syrup again.

For the people who said their waffles are getting soggy. Do not remove them until the waffles stop steaming & You must put them on a baking rack as soon as you remove them from the Waffle Maker. (I use our grated Pizza Pan works GREAT! Hope that helps. :)

I was looking for a quick blueberry syrup recipe since I was out of syrup for Saturday waffles.  This recipe was very good and super fast and easy! My 6 year old son really loved it and ate more than usual. I used frozen blueberries. Only four stars because, for me, the OJ flavor was a little overpowering ... next time I'll probably dilute the OJ with water. Definitely a keeper.

I haven't tried the sauce but I tried the waffles. I must admit I was skeptical at first. I have been making waffles for years but never with blueberries. I did a few things differently. Iused 4 eggs. I seperated my yolk from the milk and blended the yolk until lemon coloured then added the ingredients. 1TB of Vanilla. I blended the egg whites until stiff peaks. I also added 2/3 C of buttermilk and 1 1/4C of regular milk. The texture seemed wierd when everything is mixed  but as you let it sit it does work out in the end. I was impressed with the waffles and I will use this again!

Superb!  Very easy and quick to make.  I didn't wait the 30 minutes either for the batter and it turned out fine.  However, I would put in a whole cup of blueberries to the batter if not more (but I really like the blueberry flavor).

I made the sauce and while I think it was quite tasty, it was incredibly and maybe overwhelmingly sweet slathered across waffles (and we eat pure maple syrup so that is saying something). I will make this again but as a fruit compote that is served with crackers and cream cheese, or bagels or alongside pound cake. We thought it was delicious but the amount needed for a big waffle made it overpowering.

I am going to try this with my cooking class. I'll tried it because I am doing cooking classes on native American Traditional Foods, and blueberries is one of them. Thanks for this wonderful recipe! I'll be back to give my rating on taste.

I didn't make the waffles, just the sauce. The sauce was excellent. I used cran-grape juice though because that was all I had and I used a blackberry/blueberry mixture because that was what I had also. I like how this doesn't use refined sugar but still tastes great!

the waffles themselves (without blueberries) tasted great.  i prefer without, or maybe dice the bluberries before mixing with the batter.  for the sauce i used maple syrup because we didnt have honey and it still had a rich flavor and consistency.  same deal with the bluberries, though.  my kids liked it but wouldnt eat the whole berries.

This is the best waffle recipe I have ever made from scratch.  The bluberry sauce was perfect, not too sweet.  I can be used for pancakes, icecream, etc as well.

Have done the opposite of many others, I have only made ther waffles, and not the sauce..  Very tasty!  Much better than frozen imitation blueberry waffles!  I do use frozen blueberries, rinsed and patted dry.

Based on the reviews here I added a touch of sugar and vanilla to the batter.  I added some blueberries to the batter as well.  Topping each waffle with sliced banana and the blueberry sauce to serve, this was amazing.  I will also be making the sauce to spoon over slices of my cheesecake for Thanksgiving dessert!!!

The only thing I added was a splash of vanilla.  With the blueberries inside I thought they were delicious, even though I was concerned they'd be lacking flavor without some sugar- I will likely not add any because they were great!  I like how crisp they are on the outside- I have found it hard to find a recipe that comes out crisp with a tender inside.  Definitely saving this recipe!  1 and 3 year old loved them

I added a Tbsp. of white sugar to the waffle batter, substituted 1Tbsp of butter with Coconut oil and chopped the frozen blueberries... the waffles were perfect! The syrup was so amazing and simple! I think I may try to substitute ALL the butter for coconut oil, and use honey instead of white sugar next time, to make an even healthier meal!

These were just okay.  Judging from the batter, I thought these were going to be light and fluffy with a slight crunch on the outside.  But they had no color, no crispness.  They were, for lack of a better description, limp, with very little flavor.  I think they would be better with some sugar.  The sauce, is amazing.  I would make the sauce again, with the great citrus flavor, to go on other waffles.

Note: Rating is for sauce only! This is a wonderfully easy sauce. I usually add way more blueberries and use whatever citrusy juice on hand - typically country time lemonade. After reading the waffle reviews, I stick to Bisquick.

I uses Huckelberries! Just for the sauce, then put the hot sauce over vanilla ice cream, perfect after a long day of picking wild huckelberries.

I skipped the waffles and went straight for the sauce - my berry syrup had hardened/crystallized, and I needed something for pancakes. It was awesome! I didn't even have the orange juice and used water in it's place - while I think the juice would have added depth and improved the flavor, it was delicious even without. I really love how honey and not white sugar is the sweetener. Will absolutely use this recipe again, thank you for sharing!

The waffles were just ok and the sauce was just ok. I put the waffles in a warm oven to keep them warm while I finished making them and they turned mushy. For the amount of time it takes to make all this you could find a much better recipe.

I made the blueberry sauce to go with fruit. I used confectioners sugar instead of the cornstarch and honey. It thickened up the mixture and I did not have to boil it. I placed everything in the food processer and blended it together. It was spectacular!!!! I served it in the bottom of a pineapple along with "Fruity Fun Skewers" from this website!

This was difficult to rate because it is actually two recipes. I don't have a waffle maker so I didn't make the waffles. Instead I am rating only the sauce. WOW! This is one of those recipes that you get so excited to find (if you are a cooking geek like myself). What a healthy alternative to syrup on your pancakes. I tried it on ice cream and once again the taste was outstanding. I don't care to eat just plain blueberries, but they are so good for you that I wanted to find a way to fit them into my diet. I actually make this recipe once or twice a week now and spread it over my regular oatmeal in the morning. If you have high blood pressure this is a great substitution for the packets of flavored oatmeal. I went from 340 mg of sodium in two packets of Quaker Apple and Cinnamon Instant Oatmeal to 4mg by making regular oatmeal and adding this great sauce for amazing flavor. Thank you so much for sharing this recipe with us.

These are pretty good.  Add 1 tsp. vanilla.  Also add 1 tsp. cinnamon if not using blueberries.

Make sure not to overdo the orange juice in the sauce.  Do not add zest.

Very good waffle recipe! I did read the reviews first and made the following changes to make it a little loweer in fat/cals: Used fat free milk, 1/4 cup applesauce for the butter and I also added 1/2 cup splenda because posters had said it wasn't sweet enough. This made a waffle so fluffy, light, and just the right amount of sweetness. The sauce was really good too, I didn't have any orange juice but was needing to use up more blueberries so I just made it with apple juice. Very tasty! This recipe makes an awful lot of waffles, I'm freezing some, I hope they will toast up well.

5 stars...for what they are, these are great.  Light and fluffy and not too hard to do at all.  Batter sat for more like 40 minutes.  Made about 7 waffles.  It was fine without sugar - no one noticed.  The sauce was not such a hit; though I liked it, others found it odd.  The only "problem" was that some blueberries blew up in the waffle iron and made a mess of burnt stuff.  Give these a try!

Wonderful syrup recipe!  I didn't make the waffles this time but served the syrup over homemade blueberry pancakes.  My husband and I are trying to eat a bit healthier and are so glad to have found a replacement to Aunt Jemima's (which has more sugar than I realized).  I used frozen berries and a bit less honey than recommended.  I also did not have OJ on hand and used a tropical berry juice.  Not bad at all but look forward to trying the original recipe.  This syrup will from now on be part of our Sunday post-church brunch!

I have had trouble finding a reliable recipe for homemade waffles...until now. This recipe is easy to make, delicious, and nutritious compared to conventional waffles. The batter needs a little sweetening - I added about 2 Tb sugar with good results. The sauce is head and shoulders above any commercially prepared syrup or preserves you can buy. I used naked juice (blueberry/pomegranate) instead of OJ, and huckleberry honey. Fantastic! Cook about 5-6 minutes on standard non-stick waffle iron. I did not wait the whole 30 minutes...too hungry; it was great even after 10-15 minutes wait. Try this one and you will not be disappointed!

Very Good.  I only made the waffles.  Being a Blueberry fan I found that I needed to almost double the blueberries.  Probably had I made the sauce I would have not needed to add more berries.

I love blueberry sand finding different ways to use them and this was by far the best.  I would only add a pinch of sugar, since the blueberry themselves are so sweet.

Delicious. Not sure what all the comments about bland waffles is about. I am rating the waffles only; I used the blueberry breakfast sauce recipe for the syrup. I used white-whole wheat flour and a bit more milk (another 1/3 C?). Also used 1 C blueberries. The batter made six waffles.

This review is for the sauce only, I did not make the waffles.  Instead I added blueberries to a buttermilk pancake mix (I'm lazy) and made the sauce to go on top. The whole thing took me no more than 10 minutes, now that's my kind of breakfast!  My husband and 20 month old loved it.  I would add a tich of sugar next time as my blueberries could have been sweeter, but it was great as is.  This would also be great over ice cream.  I've been thinking about it ever since!  Delish.

These waffles were REALLY good.  I didn't measure the blueberries, just added a big handful, and this made this excellent!  There were way more than enough for 3 people, so I stuck the rest in a ziploc bag to munch on during class, they're a really good slightly sweet snack!  The sauce was also super yummy!

These are fantastic!!! The only thing i changed was that i added 1/4 cup of sugar to the batter since i read the reviews saying it was not sweet enough. These made them the perfect sweetness! The waffles had a lightly and fluffy texture and the blueberry sauce was amazing quick to whip up and tasted awesome! They were a big hit with my boyfriend! i will definatly make these again! My only suggestion is to double the sauce because the recipe doesn't make quite enough to support the amount of waffles!

UPDATE: I also made this sauce to go with Whole Grain Waffles from this site. The only thing i changed was that i used mixed berries (strawberries, blackberries, raspberrys and blueberries) to make the sauce instead of just blueberries. It was SO good!

This is a great recipe to start from. It is not sweet at all and lends itself to some creativity! I usually add cinnamon, vanilla or almond extract and Splenda/brown sugar/white sugar. Last week I substituted applesauce for the butter, EggBeaters for the eggs, skim milk for regular milk and 1 cup of whole wheat flour for 1 cup of regular flour. They were fantastic and my boyfriend couldn't tell the difference! He adds syrup anyway, so I tend to cut out the sugar. Yummy recipe that you can make your own!

Fantastic Recipe!  I added 1/4 cup sugar to the batter mix (my family has a sweet tooth!), used 1 cup blueberries instead of 2/3 cup and only used 2 egg yolks instead of 3.  SO TASTY!  I made the sauce as stated and it was perfect.  I dusted the tops with powdered sugar and my husband said it looked like from a restaurant.  :)  I will definitely be making this again!  Great recipe for company too.

I was very pleased with this blueberry syrup.  It is a light, healthy alternative to the usual syrups.  I made a double batch to have on hand for topping for ice cream or pound cake.  Thanks for a great recipe.

This was a good recipe, and if you love blueberries you should love this recipe.  For personal preferences I will add some sugar to the batter so that the waffles taste slightly sweet.

I didn't make the waffles in this recipe, but I make the blueberry sauce ALL THE TIME. It's so quick and easy and has more vitamins than the ordinary syrup. I probably could make the same sauce with raspberries, too, but I haven't done that yet.

I totally enjoyed the blueberry sauce. I find that I don't eat waffles and pancakes because the syrup is too sweet and there are too many calories. This sauce is easy and delicious. It has become a fave breakfast for me. I even like it with plain toast.

I always use 1T sugar in waffle recipe.  This time to make it healthier I ground about 1/4 c walnuts in food processor until very finely ground.  Then I substituted that amount for some of the flour.  It was  so delicious and walnuts are healthy.

Loved this recipe! Our family has eliminated added sugar from our diet so this waffle recipe was perfect. I used less honey in the blueberry syrup and it was sweet enough. There are none left! Thanks for a great recipe.

We picked and froze fresh blueberries last weekend.  I followed this recipe exactly and my boyfriend and I both really enjoyed it!  The sauce was great and the waffles did not leave much of a mess, even with the blueberries.  The waffles aren't very sweet, they are fluffy and with the sauce and a little bit of powdered sugar sprinkled over the top, these were delicious!

Waffles are great.  I did add 2 tablespoons sugar and 1 tsp. of vanilla extract and 1/4 tsp. of salt instead of the 1/2 tsp.  Sauce was perfect.  Thanks for 2 great recipes.

I am rating this recipe based on the blueberry sauce alone--I used a different recipe for my waffles.  The sauce was surprisingly quick and easy to make, and tasted good too!  If I had gotten something like that at an IHOP or other breakfast restaurant, I would be thrilled!

Only tried the blueberry sauce, and it was awesome, my daughter loved it.  reduced recipe for sauce to 2 servings, as a result, I needed 2 tsp more of orange juice. would make again. Will try the waffle recipe next time. Thanks for the recipe SWIZZLESTICKS.

Simple to make and VERY delicious. I will use this to top my pancakes, waffles and crepes. May even be great over vanilla ice cream!

I didn't like this sauce much.  I thought the honey taste came through too much.  Not the best berry sauce I've made.

The sauce is definitely five stars- yum!  I skipped the waffle recipe based on other reader comments.

I only made the sauce and we ate it with our Chocolate Malt Belgium Waffle recipe.  Instead of blueberries, I used raspberries. I followed it as it read. My 4 yr.old, picky guy, ripped off a piece of waffle and scooped up the sauce.  If he had it his way, he would've just ate the sauce by itself. Thanks a bunch, Wendy L

I didn't make the sauce, only the waffles, which were not very sweet.  I guess that's what the blueberry sauce is for.  But, anyway, with plenty of syrup on top, they were still good.  And they were great next day in the toaster.  Crispy!

This is for the sauce. I didnt like the overall taste of the blueberry sauce. It seemed to be missing something.

I was just looking for blueberry syrup for the cheesecake I bought and found this recipe. Excellent! Been making this for a few times already. Hubby never got tired of it!

We have been using the blueberry sauce recipe in our family for generations... It's the best. We add a tsp of almond extract to the sauce though, it really enhances the flavor of the blueberrys. I can't wait to try the waffle recipe.

These were delicious; very good. I'm a healthy eater and I'm always looking for recipes that either are or can be made healthy, this recipe is both. It's healthy on it's own by containing yummy blueberries and to make it healthier, I exchanged a bit of the white flour for whole wheat flour, used low-fat margerine, and for the egg yolks I used better'n egg product(just enough to replace the yolks) and still kept the egg whites. After reading the previous reviews I too also added more blueberries to the batter. I highly recommend this recipe, it's definitely one of the best waffle recipe's I've tried.
