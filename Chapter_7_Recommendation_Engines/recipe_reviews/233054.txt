This was excellent! The only thing I did not care for was the thyme. I will use parsley next time instead or just leave it out altogether. I had a blend of peas and carrots in the freezer and so that is what I used. Carrots work nicely in this as well. This would pair nicely with many things and is a definite keeper!

I made this tonight for dinner. Straight by the recipe. I thought it was good but my guests didn't go back for seconds.
