When I first made this I thought there was too much flour, I had to add more liquid to the batter before baking. The second time, I kept the flour the same but added an extra egg, Bingo! So add **TWO EGGS** I halved the baking soda and salt this time too, as there was too much soda and the muffins sank. This time the leavening was perfect. I used the zest of a lemon, and added the juice to a measuring cup and dispersed enough milk to make 3/4's of a cup. I fit all the batter into 12 large muffin cups instead of 15. The result is a glorious lemon poppy seed muffin!

Instead of wet buttermilk, I used 3 tablespoons of dry buttermilk powder and 3/4 cup lemon juice.

Baked as 24 medium muffins for 15 minutes.

Glaze with 1/4 cup confectioners sugar and splash of lemon juice in 2 cup Pyrex for easy pouring.

I made it. I use full fat everything (yogurt and buttermilk) and they were a hit! I will make them again.

Used 2 eggs. Delicious delicate crumb. Small muffin top mound. Next time I would sprinkle with large-crystal sugar before baking.

This is an amazing muffin recipe. I have made it once with poppy seeds and once without- just used fruit (mango) and made some plain for kids that don't like mango. This recipe is moist, light but not flaky. It's healthy and so delicious. The only changes I made were: 1) putting in 1/2 the sugar. (I always do that when I'm baking. They are still sweet and delicious.) 2) One of the two times I made these I put in some flax seed meal to make them healthier and I used almond meal instead of 1/4 of the flour.

I followed the recipe as written, but didn't have poppy seeds so I used a couple handfuls of dried cranberries.  I made 12 muffins (filled to the top) and had some batter left over, which of course I ate!  My muffins were done in 15 minutes.  They are delicious.  I used paper liners sprayed with cooking spray and the muffins did stick a little to the paper.  Maybe I should have just greased the muffin tin.

I liked this muffin.  I did use 2 eggs and less baking soda and baking powder (  1  1/2 tsp baking powder and 1/2 tsp baking soda,) as suggested by another review from WCM.  I think lemon would add so much to this recipe. Make sure to check muffins  at 15 min. My muffins were baked at 15 min. Next time, I will add some lemon zest as suggested by the author. Also, some lemon extract and lemon juice as suggested by  the review from WCM.
