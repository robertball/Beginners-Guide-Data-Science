I won't say this recipe is quick because flan takes patience, but it is definately worth the wait. This appears to be the same recipe which my aunt once gave to me (she is Mexican), so it was fairly easy for me. Two things I do differently are I cook it all in one 10-inch glass pie pan, and after the sugar is carmelized, I add just a touch of Kahluha to it....its the best!

Reducing the cream cheese to 4 oz resulted in a more balanced flavor -- closer to traditional flan and further away from cheesecake flavor.  It has excellent texture.  Postively wonderful!

Instead of baking in separate ramekins, can I bake in 10" cake pan?

Awesome!  We made it for a dinner party in individual ramekins and it disappeared.  We found that if you soak the pan in about an inch of hot water, the flan will flop out easily.  The caramel sauce is the best part!

Recipe is great...but for an even creamier consistancy..reduce eggs to 3...and reduce cream cheese...results...wonderfully creamy, not jiggly flan

Absolutely wonderful!  I lightened the recipe up as much as I was able, with raves from my calorie-conscious guests.  I used fat-free evaporated milk, fat-free cream cheese, just 1/4 cup butter (instead of 1/2 cup), and 3 whole eggs with 2-eggs' equivalent of liquid egg substitute.  I will use this flan recipe again and again.

This recipe was perfect! I've made flans before and this one was by far the best one yet! The hubby and kids loved it and asked for more! I'll have to make this for next weeks Thanksgiving dinner. Thank you for sharing this delicious recipe!

Very tasty, not jiggly like snot!The carmelized sugar is tricky I burnt the first batch and it was impossible to get off of the pan.

I had never made flan before and this recipe was super easy!  
I doubled the recipe for Cinco de Mayo and it came out perfectly.
It was a definite hit!

I make this every holiday whether it is for our tradtional Puerto Rican holiday meals or with my American boyfriends' family everyone loves it! I also make it whenever I visit someone, and for pot lucks at work. Everyone loves this dessert, it is usually gone within the first hour that it is out. Excellent!!! The best authentic spanish dessert.

I am American, living in Mexico and have already made this flan recipe for many Mexicans and....they ALL LOVE IT!  What more do I need to say?                 And it's really not so hard after you make it a couple of times.

This was AMAZING!  I brought it to a fiesta potluck and cooked it in a regular 9x13 cake pan.  It still turned out great!  The only disappointment was that I only got one piece...it goes really fast!
