I always try a recipe as written before I start making changes, This is the first time I made a change at the beginning and in my opinion it was very small and I  doubt changed the overall end taste. The change was, I used fresh spinach in place of the frozen and I chopped and wilted it prior to adding. This recipe is incredibly bland, my husband  likes nearly all food and his remark was "the salad was good". Perhaps I should have waited till there was more than one review.

It was really good.  I added a bit of basil.
