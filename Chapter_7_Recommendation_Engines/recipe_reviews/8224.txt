I agree with the other reviewer. I had a horrible experience with this cake. It did not rise at all and was way too dense. I even tried it twice to no avail. Don't waste your time on this one!!!!

This cake turned out horribly. The batter was very
thick. When baked, it didn't rise, it was heavy and had to be thrown out.  The frosting was tasty though.
