I would rate these as a 5-star, except I made some modifications! 

First, I used 1/2 cup almond flour and 1 cup wheat flour. Second, I added 2 eggs, as the batter just seemed too dry (very likely a result of the added almond flour). Third, I added a couple pieces of crystallized ginger. Fourth, I added a dash of cinnamon. I then drizzled white chocolate over the top. 

They came out very tasty and not too sweet. I will probably continue fudging with the recipe to reduce the wheat flour and sugar!

I have made it twice and both times it was bad. It is very sugary, and 4 teaspoons of vanilla?  Maybe more flour?

This is a classic tasting bar that doesn't need refrigeration like a cranberry bliss bar.  For a holiday cookie exchange, I drizzled them with leftover white chocolate to make them more decorative.  Thanks!

These are so good.  I added the zest of half an orange to the batter and then iced them with cream cheese frosting made with orange juice and zest and topped them with more white chocolate and dried cranberries.  They turned out great.

These are great with major modifications. I reduced sugar to one cup, doubled the amount of flour and egg, reduced the amount of vanilla to 2 tsp, and add 2 tsp of orange extract, and added 1/4 more tsp  of baking powder. if you follow the recipe exactly without modification, it comes out way too sugary.

These were very good, I reduced to 1 cup brown sugar and 3 packets of splenda. I used 1/2 cup of cranberries, with an 1/8 cup of water from cranberries and 1/4 cup vanilla chips.

Used gluten free all purpose flour, and chopped the white chocolate chips to a finer consistency. Was perfectly sweet without any additional topping I thought. Will definitely make again.

This is a very tasty bar. I use dried tart cherries instead of the cranberries and I used 2 tsps. each vanilla and almond extracts. I also took poppiesinjuly's suggestion and frosted with cream cheese icing. I cut them into large squares and then cut each square again to make triangles. These taste like the bars sold at Starbucks.

Fyi: I substituted coconut oil for the butter because I was low on butter, but followed the recipe exactly for everything else and these are delicious! I will probably cut back on the cranberries and chips next time, other than that they are perfect!
