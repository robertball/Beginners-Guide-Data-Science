One of our favorite breakfasts. This is also good with Nutella and crunchy peanut butter with bananas. Great Sunday morning treat. EDITED: To clarify, I do NOT add the chocolate syrup. Peanut butter and jelly is plenty on this "pizza" for us.

Great snack!  I used a whole grain English muffin and low sugar strawberry jam. I waited until the peanut butter was nice and "melty".  I opted not to use the coconut or syrup as I thought it was overkill.

Not bad I didn't care for the chocolate. The picture doesn't look that appetizing!! I didn't have bananas, so I just served strawberries on the side. My youngest daughter liked this and ate one slice while I ate the other.
