I made this with organic ground turkey meat.  My family enjoyed it and I would definitely make it again.

Super tasty!  I halved the recipe, and it was plenty of food for six of us with leftovers.  I used 7 dry individual cup a soup chicken soup packs since I couldn't find the Lipton pack, and it was super moist and flavorful.  I used almost a whole 15 ounce can of tomato sauce, too.  Everyone loved it!

I am not comfortable with the reliability of this recipe.   I followed it exactly with  one exception: I used only 4.2 pounds of meat--although I did use parchment on the bottom  of the skillet.   Even with the reduced amount of meat, in a standard 12" iron skillet the center of my loaf was a full inch above the sides of the pan.  I cannot imagine how big the skillet in the picture must be for the loaf to turn out that far below the edges of the pan.  A skillet that size ain't fitting in my oven.  Even with only 4.2 pounds of meat, 1/4 of the loaf comfortably fed our family of five.  Unless you are feeding a small army or a scout troop, keep that in mind when it comes to quantity.   The flavor was great, although I also take issue with the cooking time.  Even given the huge size of the loaf, it was simply too long--I would estimate by almost 45 minutes.  I had to cover the top with foil to prevent over-browning, and the bottom came out with a very thin and crispy--almost burned--crust.  So the flavor was was great, but I would not follow this recipe too strictly, unless you want to freeze half of it for another 2 meals (again, for a family of 5).

Excellent and clearly makes plenty. Like the crispy edges by using the skillet! It was a lot of measuring so I winged it on a few but got all the major stuff. Turned out great...I didn't realize the time it could take to cook and used convection, which was great.
