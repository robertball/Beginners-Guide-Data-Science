Delicious! The flavors are beautifully balanced. I chose to bake the fish uncovered so the soy and honey made a glaze. We all enjoyed it and will have it again. Best of all there is no leftover fishy odor. Thank you Christina

My wife hates fish! Mad all day knowing what I was to make. Well she had seconds! That doesn't sound like a lot but I've been trying for 26 years!
