I changed the cooking order. Browned the bacon in the soup pot (Only one pound). Removed bacon and added a couple Tablespoons of butter. Cooked the onion and leeks till soft, added the carrots, 2 chopped celery stalks and cooked for about ten minutes. Added about a third of a cup of flour to make a roux, let cook for about a minute, stirring constantly. Added the chicken broth, and ham. Brought to a simmer. Added about a 1 1/2 tsp dried crushed rosemary and about 1 1/2 tsp dried thyme. Let simmer for about 15 minutes while I diced the potatoes. Added potatoes and let simmer for about  1/2 hour. Used a potato masher in the pot to mash some of the potatoes to bring it to the consistency I was looking for. Added one cup of cream. Served garnished with chopped scallions and cheddar cheese, fresh ground pepper, along with hot sourdough bread and a nice red wine. 
This was fabulous!! Such a big pot, great for planned overs!! Timing note: Preparation took me an hour and a half. Lots of peeling and chopping, but it was well worth it. I did add another 2 Cups of Chicken broth towards the end. I think next time I might add a cup or 2 of frozen peas towards the end of the cooking time for a little color.

This was great!  I was browsing for a recipe for my leftover Christmas ham, and I just happened to have all the other ingredients on hand (even a leek!)  The only thing I modified (besides using a little less of most of the veggies and bacon than the recipe called for, but only because I didn't have on hand as much as the recipe called for) was to follow the other's advice for cutting down on the rosemary.  I use crushed rosemary, and two teaspoons was plenty...still had the flavor, but it wasn't overpowering at all.  I had enough to feed five of us tonight, and froze the other half for another cold night when I don't have time to cook.  This is a keeper!

This recipe called for way too much rosemary.  When I made it, I halfed it and it still tasted too strong.  The rest of the ingredients went fine together.  Maybe using a 1/4 of the amount of rosemary would make it more desireable.

This is one tasty chowder! I used 1% milk and thickened to my liking with potato flakes after being refrigerated for 1 day so that I could skim the excess hardened fat. I added some dried parsley just to add a touch of green to the dish. This tastes so good after the flavors fully meld after a day or so that it will be a great meal to make on the weekend and enjoy on a busy work night!

This recipe is awesome!  Easy to make, aromatic, flavorful, and better the second day than the first!  I shredded the carrots instead of dicing them, and they really added color all through the dish.  Only thing missing was some fresh ground pepper, which was easy to fix.  I will certainly be making this again, it was a hit with my whole family.  Sprinkle a little bacon and chredded cheddar on top, and YUM!

This was a fabulous recipe, and I was able to use my beautiful new red Le Creuset dutch oven too that I received for Christmas! Leftover Christmas ham was perfect, I used a honey baked ham instead of the country ham, and added leftover mashed potatoes with the heavy cream for more of a creamy kick.  My boyfriend and I will be freezing the bulk of it to enjoy in the coming months.  Wonderful recipe, and a fabulous way to use those Christmas leftovers.

Best soup I have ever made!  I wouldn't change a thing.  If you like full flavor, then this soup is for you...  I did freeze some of it because it does make a lot.  It turned out just as good after it was frozen.

Delicious, delicious, delicious.
Ok, so I'm giving it 5 stars even with a change. However, the only change I made was to the rosemary. I used fresh, about 2 tsp, and it was great. I enjoy the taste and smell of rosemary. Some don't like it too strong. Use some of your sense and use to the strength you prefer. I might even use more next time.
This recipe makes enough to freeze some or to serve to a large party.
This chowder was so very delicious and rich, not a light soup. I will use this recipe over and over. I thought it had a nice velvety thickness, though it was a little thinner than chowder. If I wanted to thicken I'd try mashed potatoes or a little flour. 
It's great the next day, the leeks/onions seem like a lot but they work beautifully.
I also used my homemade turkey stock as a base. I'm passing this one along.

This is a very tasty and hardy soup!  The smokiness of the bacon and ham was complemented well by the rosemary.  I was concerned that the amount of leek and onions may be overpowering, but they balanced the soup nicely with their sweetness.  Excellent use of leftover ham.  Thanks for sharing!

I would have given a higher review if there was no Rosemary in here.  It was waaaaay too much!  Tasted like perfume and I was diappointed because I had worked so hard on this soup.  I'd say try it but omit the Rosemary or use very little.  I also added frozen corn.

This was really good I didn't use bacon & didn't have leeks but used some cabbage and lots of fresh herbs (thyme, dill, rosemary, parsley) very good.  Worked great for the hambone from Easter.

This is soooo good!!! The only problem I had with it-and the reason for 4 stars instead of 5-is that it is super salty. I don't know what to do about it. Low sodium everything maybe? I added extra cream and that helped a little, but made it more soupy. I like the idea of blending some of it and pouring it back in. I think some Velveeta would probably be good in it also. Just to note, I couldn't get leeks, didn't use carrots since the man doesn't like them, and I didn't have rosemary. It had great flavor, very filling, and the kids ate it up. I already know my husband will love it since it has quite a bit of meat. I'm looking forward to seeing what it tastes like tomorrow. Give this a try, it's definitely worth it!

Best soup I ever made! This rich and creamy soup was really outstanding, but I made two major changes to the recipe only because I didn't have the bacon and cream: I used whole milk and cornstarch as thickener in place of the heavy cream and used only one pan to prepare the chowder. Also, I began by sauteing diced turkey bacon instead of regular bacon, removing it from the pan and adding the country ham and sauteing it briefly in order to release some of the fat and juices into the pan. I then removed the ham, added a couple of tbsps. of butter and a little grapeseed oil to keep the butter from burning and sauteed the onions well, then added the leeks and garlic (didn't have the green onions on hand). Adding some of the broth next allows you to deglaze the pan and scrape up the yummy bits that have collected on the bottom of the pan and helps to create the savoriness that makes this soup a standout! I'm sure the original recipe is terrific, as well:)

I made this on Tuesday night and we ate it tonight.  Very good!  I only used 1 T Rosemary and I added 1 T Thyme. Put 1/2 of the Chowder in a large bowl and used my immersion blender on it, then added back to the pot.  Loved the way it had chunks and thickness.  Didn't add the bacon until closer to serving, added 1 1/2 c. shredded cheddar cheese and diced green onions when I added the cream.  As others have done I shredded the carrots and cooked with the onions, kale and garlic.  My husband and I loved this.  Will freeze the rest.  Made a huge pot.

This will be my go to recipe when I need to make something with my leftover Easter ham!  As I was making this I kept thinking that there would be too much bacon,onion rosemary and leeks, so I did make changes and used 1 lb bacon, 1 lg. onion, 2 leeks, about 1 tsp minced fresh rosemary and I put my ham bone into Low sodium broth for about an hour for additional flavor.  It probably would have been wonderful if I hadn't made any changes, although the rosemary is obviously an error.  I found that with all the wonderful flavors going on, there was never a need to salt this!

Pros:
+Good texture
+Easy to modify based on personal preference
+Simple to make
+Makes a large batch and saves well

Cons:
-Way too much rosemary. I have to assume the author meant tsp, not Tbsp. 
-Ratio of ingredients seemed off
-Hard to make in a standard 8 qt pan, almost needed a bigger pot
-Expensive

I made some adjustments to the recipe for the second go-around.

-Decreased ham to 3 C
-Increased potato to ~3.5 lb
-Decreased rosemary to 2 tsp
-Increased garlic to 6 cloves
-Decreased bacon to 1.5 lb
-Instead of dicing carrots, used 1 lb bag of frozen peas & carrots, and .5 lb of frozen corn
-Substituted half & half for heavy cream
-Added pepper to taste

Making these changes resulted in a chowder more to my family's liking, plus making it less expensive.

Didn't have any rosemary, so I couldnt use too much.  Added a tsp of dried mustard to the broth and a bit of dill weed when I added the cream.  My family loved this!!  Thanks for sharing.

Good with the omission of the rosemary.  Also added mushrooms and red pepper, did not add leeks and green onion, just used yellow onion.  Simmered with a bay leaf, parsley, sage, coriander and thyme.

Like some of the previous cooks, I drastically cut back on the rosemary. Basically, one tablespoon is already more than enough! I used sweet potatoes instead of white and since my ham wasn't too salty, I added some of my Alaska Pure Sea Salt, Alder smoked flavor for an added kick. Overall, good change from the same 'ol chowder recipe. I will make this again.

This was really good albeit a bit salty.  Did not use country ham but leftover baked ham.  Didn't have the leeks and green onions but it was still delicious although a bit salty.  Next time I'd like to follow the recipe exactly but use low sodium chicken broth.

I loved it!  My picky eater girls (ages 2 and 5) ate it.  My 5 year old said she liked it a little bit.. which is a pretty good rating considering she finished her whole bowl!  I think it would have been better with a little less Rosemary.

This recipes is absolutely amazing!! I did make a few changes and substitutions.  I didn't use nearly as much rosemary, probably cut back to 1 TBS.  As another user suggested I used potato flakes to thicken some.  I didn't have leeks or green onions and just doubled the amount regular onions.  I used chicken bouillon instead of ham stock, although the next time i bake a ham I will make this recipe again.  I asked the deli for a 2 lb chunk of domestic ham and i cubed it myself.  I only used 1 lb of bacon and added a little extra drippings. I didn't have heavy cream so i used evaporated milk instead. Goes great with rye bread and taste better the next day.

I didn't have rosemary or leeks so left those ingredients out. This soup is very good with lots of flavor and the texture is very nice. Just a warning to those who might wish to thicken up the soup with potato flakes or mashed potatoes: this will change the velvety smooth, creamy texture to a coarse, grainy texture. I tried it and regretted it from the moment it hit my tongue.

I switched this recipe up for a great taste. I used 2 cups of ham, 1 box of precooked bacon, 1 large onion, 2 diced green onions, 4 large oven baked potatoes, 1/4 tsp oregano, pepper, garlic and 1 1/2 tsp salt. I omitted the rosemary and leeks. These changes greatly reduced the cooking time and enhanced the flavor immensely.

We all liked it. I thought the recipe was too heavy on the Rosemary, so I only added half (which was plenty).  Perhaps it is supposed to be measured in tsps, not Tbsp (4 Tbsp is equal to 1/4 c)?  I omitted the onion, thinking that leeks and green onions would be enough.  I substituted Half & Half for the heavy cream.

Just made this tonight but with some changes.I didn't have the garlic, leeks or rosemary,but it didn't need it.It was extremely tasty! I also used Turkey stock because that's all I had.I also only used one pound of bacon and one large onion. I added corn also and like one of the other reviewers suggested,I thickened it up with instant potato flakes. It made a HUGE pot and came out delicious!

Yum!! I didn't use rosemary because I was out, but put a little sage in instead. Also, I think this was super tasty day one! The recipe makes a TON, but that just means theres more to be had another night when we're eating out of the freezer! Thanks!

This was a very good base recipe. I took the advise of many reviewers and used 1/2 the rosemary and added about 1 tbl garlic. To make it a little healthier I omitted the bacon, used 1% milk and added fresh spinach. Thanks for sharing the recipe.

Wonderful.  Use advise from others and used perhaps only 1 t of Rosemary, and only 1 lb Bacon.  2 lbs Bacon scared me. Also added in some left over Mased Potatoes to thicken up. Feed to 5 People who all enjoyed very much!

This was pretty good. I didnt have the leek so it was omitted. I also only used 1 and half large onions and omitted the green onions.  As others, there was way too much rosemary for my liking so I only used 2 tablespoons and that was almost too much. I also added a teaspoon of black pepper, 2 celery stalks, an extra cup of ham and another couple potatoes.  All in all though this is a very flavourful recipe.  With some minor adjustments to suit the tastes of my family it is perfect.

This soup was excellent!  We left out the ham and used about a cup of chopped smoked bacon and it was plenty of meat.  We also added a can of corn.  It might be better the next day, but we wouldn't know because our family of 5 ate it all at once!

I loved this soup as did my family including the kids.  I did not read the recipe carefully before shopping and only bought one pound of bacon by accident.  It still turned out great and I think 2 pounds would be too much as it turns out.  The only other change was that I did not use 4 tablespoons of rosemary because it smelled so strong with just two tablespoons that I opted not to use the rest.  I actually strained the rosemary out after a few minutes...it left a light flavor without being too overpowering.  I followed the rest of the recipe exactly and it turned out wonderfully.  I will make this again.

WOW!  This soup is amazing!  So incredibly flavorful!  I don't know how much rosemary I used, just poured some into my palm and rubbed it into the pot.  I made half the recipe and had enough to freeze for next time.  My finicky 3yo even ate it!  

Next time I think I will microwave the bacon and sautee the onion/leek/garlic in a little butter to better control the fat.

It was a bit on the salty side, might go with a low sodium stock next time.

Although, if I didn't want to make any changes I wouldn't this was amazing as is.

Very Yummy!

I didn't add ANY rosemary and I used only 1/2 lb of bacon and it was still very delicious.  I also mashed a few potatoes for thickness.  :-)

This makes a LOT of chowder, that usually works for my large family, but I cut this back (and still had leftovers). I took others' suggestions and cut the total rosemary in half.  We also left out 1/2 the bacon, 1 onion, 1/2 the carrots and all the green onion.  I added black pepper and a little paprika then served with cheese sprinkled on top.  My kids didn't wat it at all and my husband thought the leeks too over powering (he'd give it a two), but I thought it had great flavor overall (I'd give it a four).  Even better served over crumbled corn bread.

This was simply amazing. I believed I followed the recipe to a T.  Served this in the evening with crescent rolls after a Thanksgiving day meal. The only thing I wish I would've done is fry the bacon longer so it could've kept some crisp. So creamy and tasty!

Loved this recipe!  I was surprised at how awesome it tasted, considering there’s not that many ingredients.  I only used 1 lb. of bacon, and 2 leeks, and it came out perfect.  I also had to add water to mine after adding all the ingredients together...because of how thick it was.  But it turned out great!

I absolutely love it, and will definitely make it again with one change. The amount of rosemary it calls for is way too overwhelming. I use about a third of what is called for, and it’s perfect.

Due to many food intolerances I made this soup using sweet potatoes. I cut the rosemary to one tsp. and used heavy coconut milk for the cream. I loved it.

Delicious, with lots left over for hot winter lunches! Great way to use leftover Christmas ham. I did add a roux and more broth, as other reviewers suggested. I also reduced the potatoes and substituted sweet potato to make it more healthy. I think the sweet potato made it more tasty!

Wonderful recipe! My husband and I like really thick and creamy soups so I made a roux. (In small sauce pan, melt one stick of butter over low/medium heat. Once bubbly slowly add 3/4 cup of flour. I then slowly added 2 cups of heavy whipping cream. Continue mixing until roux thickens. Add the mixture to the pot of soup). Will be making this again!

The one addition that put this recipe over the top was velveeta cheese. Just a great flavour in the soup. Other than that this is always gobbled up by my family. Thanks for a great recipe.

My fiancé and I absolutely love this soup! My changes: Add in 1.5 cups celery, sage, thyme, salt, pepper. Subtract the leeks and the green onion. The yellow onion was plenty of onion for us. I used 12oz. of thick cut boar's head bacon instead of 2 pounds and I felt like it was plenty. I also used maybe a quarter of the bacon grease. I used about 2 TBSPs of rosemary and didn't find it overpowering at all. I also used roughly peeled yellow potatoes instead of russets. My stock was made using a hambone from Christmas and it was so savory! Highly recommended. Pretty much anything can be done to taste in this recipe. Will make again!

This came out excellent . I was concerned with it being salty so I used unsalted chicken broth . I also halved the rosemary and use only a 1/2 lb of bacon and only a fraction of the bacon grease . I did add 2 tbs butter with a smattering of the grease to sauté the leeks garlic and green onions . I also added diced celery . I had to thicken it with flour at the end but it came out perfect ! Makes enough to feed a family of 6! We are 3 so I froze half for another meal !
Will for sure make this again !

I made this recipe recently, and I thought it turned out great! My aunt gave me the hambone and a lot of ham from our Easter lunch. I took the hambone and I made a broth. I started this chowder by heating the Dutch oven with some of the fat from the broth. I added chopped onions, garlic, carrots, celery, cabbage, potatoes, and started adding back in some of the broth I prepared. After reading some of the reviews about Rosemary, I decided to just use the spices I have on hand. I used dill, parsley, a little bit of Cayanne pepper, a little bit of Tumerick, and more garlic powder. I'd like to add wine to soups, so I added some riesling. I didn't have cream on hand, but I did have a container of whipped cream cheese, so I use that. Because I had so much ham to use up, I used a lot of ham and didn't use bacon. I garnished with green onion on top. So good!!!

great chowder!  However, i did make a few changes for my family who tends to complain about onions.  I used two med onions, two green onions and stuck to the three leeks.  Otherwise, i pretty much stuck to recipe but did sub half and half for heavy cream and only 1 pound of bacon( to cut back on fat) and used less than one tablespoon of rosemary since other reviewers commented on how it overwhelmed the dish.   I served with buttermilk biscuits and had plenty leftover for lunch the next day.

The recipe is amazing. I've made it multiple times. My issue is with the directions. It's huge! 15 servings. I don't even own a pot big enough to make this full recipe in!  So I have to do a bit of changing to rebalance it to what I think a standard size recipe is. I like having it for 2-3 days, but at 15 servings we would have to eat it for a week.

This was absolutely one of the best soups I've ever tasted! It was so good and I loved it so much that my picky three year old even tried it. She loved it and had two helpings!!!! I'll be making this again!!! Of and we cut back on the rosemary because we have four kids and they equally have sensitive pallets.

I added some celery since I had some to use up.  I didn't have any green onions so I just used white onions and leeks.  I took the advice of other reviewers and added half the amount of rosemary.  I also added some thyme and a touch of nutmeg when I stirred in the cream.

Left out the leeks (grocery store was out), used bacon bits, sauteed the onions, garlic & carrots first, then added everything else. Half recipe - used ONE tbsp rosemary

We are only a family of 5 so I cut the recipe in 1/2. I made this soup starting with step 2 then 1 & 3. Like most of the other reviewers I only used a little bit of rosemary (1/2 tsp).  I don't think it added anything and honestly don't think it even needs it.  I used more potatoes and chicken broth than it called for and gave it a light mash with the potato masher to thicken it up. The soup was amazing everyone had seconds and I should've made the whole recipe. 
:-) I will absolutely make this one again, great way to change up leftover ham!

Wayyyy too much Rosemary called for in this recipe. It's all you could taste. I added two tablespoons to the broth at the beginning and then left out the other two. I'm going to assume this is a typo and was suppose to say 4 teaspoons.

Same situation, left overs. Made my own stock from bones and scraps, then followed recipe. Wow, so savory and delicious.  Froze the leftovers for cold snowy days. Yummy. Making a new batch from our Easter ham as I'm writing this review.  You've got to at least try it. Glad I did.

This was so good!  I was looking for a recipe that would use ham stock as I had recently made some from a ham bone...I am so glad I picked this one.  Based on other reviewers I reduced the amount of rosemary I used (I cut the entire recipe in half and then only used 1 tsp. of rosemary).  Also I mixed it up early in the day and let it simmer on the woodstove all day, added the cream just before serving.  Delicious!!  Very creamy and the flavors came together nicely after simmering all day.  I also found it thickened from cooking all day and I didn't find it to be too thin of a soup.  Hubby loved it too and I will definitely be making again.  (I did find it quite salty but that was the fault of my ham...if you want less salt I suggest using low sodium bacon and ham.)

We checked out the reviews and settled on JCP's from 2/16/13.  It was awesome.   Total depth of flavors.   Can't imagine how awesome it'll taste tomorrow after the flavors meld.  A++

This was fantastic!  Best leftover ham soup I have had.  I followed JCP's review on this recipes and used his cooking order, cut back Rosemary to 1.5 TBP and add 1TBP of thyme.  Used less cream, about a cup.   On day two I let it cook down a little to get a little thicker.  Both days the soup had great flavor so you will enjoy it.   A whole family favoarite, tasted like something out of a high end restaurant.

I used some leftover mashed potatoes as well as cubed potatoes.  I also had some leftover cauliflower that I added to this recipe.  It was delicious! I am not a big fan of rosemary so I omitted it and just used salt and pepper to flavor.

Oh wow, this was amazing! Was a great way to use left over ham and various other veggies that I had in the fridge - specifically my leeks! I may use red potatoes or Yukon golds next time but that's about the only switch I would make. I'm freezing half of it as well and setting in serving sizes so I can take it to work for a healthier warm up versus normal canned soups. Definitely adding to my rotation of recipes....labor intensive at first but very worth it! Thanks for the share!

Tasty, but rosemary was too strong (I should have read other reviews beforehand). However, my main issue with it was how thin it was. I had to add quite a bit of flour to thicken it up. I sprinkled in some pepper and added some chopped string beans for more texture.

WOW that's a lot of rosemary!!!  That MUST be a typo.  I used 1/2 Tbsp and it is plenty!  As an aside, I make a similar soup without the carrots (and rosemary), and it's just as good with or without.

Love this recipe.  I left out the potatoes to control the starch.  Also a little red pepper flakes.  When I need it thicken I also use potato flakes.  Plan on trying this with cabbage as well.

A lot of work chopping but a very good recipe. A full meal when served with garlic/parmesan bread or pita bread and hummus.  I only used about 1/2 lb of bacon and that was plenty.  I chopped the carrots very finely and mashed the potatoes.  I don't like big chunks of potatoes in a soup. The mashed potatoes made it even creamier which was great.

This is a wonderful recipe and is the best thing for left-over baked ham. BUT, the estimates for preparation/cooking time are just wrong. It says 40 minutes prep time. Maybe that would be the case if I already had all the veggie, ham and bacon chopped and diced. But both times I've made it it has taken me at least 1.75 hours to get to the point where I have a pot of soup simmering on the stove top.

I made this exactly as stated but reduced the rosemary as other posts suggested. There was a lot of prep for this soup and the results were disappointing. It was just okay. Two pounds of bacon are too much. Really felt like this was a waste of time.

I am a vegetarian, but made this for my family.  They said it was good, but had way too much rosemary.  I will trying only 2T next time.  I'm hoping it will not be so overpowering tomorrow.  I did crush my rosemary a bit first.  I did not have bacon, but had bacon grease stored, so I cooked the veggies in that and coconut oil, which actually saved time, but I didn't have bacon.  I used leftover ham from Christmas and ham stock I had made from the ham bones.  I will make this again, and lessen the rosemary.

I made this today with leftover Christmas ham.  It was delicious.  I didn't have leeks and I used about 1 cup of half and half instead of the heavy cream and only about 1T of rosemary. If you are looking for a way to use up leftover ham, try this recipe. You won't be disappointed.

Very good recipe!  Loved it! Like others cut down on the Rosemary to 1 tsp and threw in a little dried parsley.  Also, used half and half instead of heavy cream.  Will definitely make again!

This is a very rich soup.  If you like bacon and ham (which I do), it should be fine.  Don't plan on gobbling down bowl after bowl though, as it's a bit salty and the flavor is extremely strong.  Would be great served at a wedding or some sort of formal dinner where your portion size is extremely limited.

I used a home made ham stock, which may have added to the flavor profile.

I only used 1 tsp dried rosemary and it was perfect. Not overwhelming in the least. Only used 1 pound of bacon and 2% milk instead of heavy cream to cut back on the fat. It was still absolutely delicious!!

This was really good, but mine turned out WAY too salty for our taste.  Next  time, I will put in 1/2 the bacon and also try to find low/no sodium chicken broth (if they have that in Germany) to cut down on the salt.  But this was a great alternative to clam chowder that the kids are more likely to eat.

Yum! I only used 1 pound of bacon, and added corn. Loved the texture and taste. Everyone had seconds. I served it with salad and cornbread.

This was delicious! Made a few changes by using only half of the rosemary and substituting fresh for dry, as well as adding some fresh thyme. We couldn't find a leek, but it was good anyway. Used half and half instead of cream so it wasn't too heavy.

I left out the rosemary and added 1/2 cup of cheddar cheese to thicken it up and give it a nice rich flavor. I also added 1 tblspoon of chives! Family loved it served with fresh italian bread.

We were pleasantly surprised by how nicely all the flavors complimented each other in this recipe.  My husband said, "This is the best soup in the world".  I did as the previous reviewers suggested and cut the rosemary by a little more than half, and I also sauteed the leeks with the onion mixture for about 15 minutes before adding to the pot.  Outstanding flavor!

I made this recipe last night and first of all I would not call it a chowder at all, it's more like a soup, a little thicker than chicken noodle soup. I tried to thicken it up with cornstarch but it was still very thin. I didn't use near as many veggies as the recipe called for either, thats A LOT of ingredients for only 8 cups of chicken stock! The taste was excellent though. Next time I make it, I'm going to reduce the amount of chicken stock and use milk instead to turn it into a "chowder." Oh and I also only used 2 tsp of rosemary as suggested by other reviewers, this was the perfect amount in my opinion.

I had Christmas leftovers and tried this recipe to get rid of them. Everyone raved about it and wanted the recipe. I have made it over and over again since then. My adjustments: as said, cut way back on rosemary and add pepper. Also, one key thing I did was used lots of homemade mashed potatoes (boiled, mashed, buttered) instead of chuncks. It was creamy and very good texture. I have tried adding green beans, using turkey bacon, using non dairy coffee creamer instad of cream.. you name it! No matter what, it is always a hit. Key note: it is better the longer it sits. I make it and let it sit in the fridge overnight. I just used it for gravy over biscuits this morning. So many options.

way too much rosemary.  I didn't see the rosemary comments since my husband printed the recipe out for me.  I love spices but I was wondering if it should have said 2 tsp. not tablsp.

AS with most recipes I use, I always modify them to my tastes.  I loved this recipe!! It provided a great base to dabble with.  Many other reviewers complained about the amount of rosemary in this recipe. You need to know yourself and know your tastes. If you do not like a lot of rosemary, then put a little in the pot.  I only used 2 tsp and that was the perfect amount!! I also puréed some of the chowder to thicken it!! Lovely!!!

This was super tasty but only use about 1 tsp of rosemary. I left out the leeks and the green onions (didn't have any) and I added some potato flakes after the cream to thicken the broth out a bit. All in All, a great recipe!

Great chowder!  I added one thing to the recipe.  I added a spicy hot dog (sliced) that I had bought at Sprouts.  My kids said they were too spicy to eat but they added a nice overall spicy flavor to the recipe.  We like our spice in Texas!!

This was GREAT! I thought it was a lot of rosemary, but it gave the soup such a great flavor. I used milk instead of cream to cut the fat, and it was just as good. Will make again whenever I have leftover ham!

Great recipe for after the holidays. Got tired of making beans all the time with the ham bone. Still put the ham bone in the crock pot with some veggies to make the ham both. Then used the left over mashed potatoes instead of the cubed potatoes. Great way to clear out the refrig and make a great cowder.
