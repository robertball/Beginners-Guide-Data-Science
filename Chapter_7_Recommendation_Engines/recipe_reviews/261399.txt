I made this for Christmas dinner for a couple of guests that are vegetarians.  They said it was the best squash recipe they ever tried.  I followed the recipe exactly (except I microwave the shells) and sealed it up and froze it.  I put it in the fridge the day before I baked it for dinner.  Stood up very well to freezing!
