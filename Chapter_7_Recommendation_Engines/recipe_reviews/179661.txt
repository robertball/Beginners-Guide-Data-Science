I used three tablespoons of wasabi powder and couldn't taste it at all.

Houston, we have a problem!  I really thank the previous reviewers because I wanted a wasabi flavor, so I used 3 Tb of wasabi powder, replaced the 1 Tb of water with 2 Tb of soy sauce and even added 6 drops Tabasco.  No wasabi flavor, very little other flavor.  The nuts came out crispy and nice, but that's it.  I think the baking just bakes out the wasabi flavor.  So, how does one get wasabi to stick to almonds without (a) having to bake the flavor away or (b) leaving an oily sticky green mess on the nuts to get all over people's fingers?  I dk, but I'm determined to find a solution!  Thanks again for helpful warnings.

I rather enjoyed the outcome of this recipe.  However the wasabi powder I used was horrible and was not spicy at all.  Need to figure out how to use wasabi paste.

I used 2 Tablespoons of wasabi powder per the recipe, but it barely had any wasabi flavor.

Made these twice now. The first time I thought the flavor was seriously lacking of wasabi. I figured it was maybe that my wasabi powder was old. The next time was with new wasabi, and still the same problem.  I think the problem is, that baking mellows the wasabi  too much. I do like how they come out nice and crisp and salty but bummed there is no wasabi flavor.

This recipe doesn't work. I have tried it three times using various amounts of water, wasabi powder and wasabi paste and the wasabi flavor came out very bland each time. Something does happen when it is baked that takes the zing out of the wasabi. Please correct this recipe or take it out of the database.

Didn't think to much about this one.  The kosher salt overpowered it all.  I thought the wasabi would be stronger, but maybe my powder was getting to be to old.

I tried this 3 ways - first as is. Second I let air dry. Third I tried using the dehydrator instead of the oven so as not to "kill" the heat of the wasabi in the conventional oven.  I am saddened by the waste of ingredients and do NOT recommend this recipe as it simply does not work.

They turned out absolutely pure salt. I did exactly as it said, and they turned out salt covered salt. No wasabi flavor at all.
