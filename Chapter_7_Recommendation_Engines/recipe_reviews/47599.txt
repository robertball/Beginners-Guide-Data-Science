My German mother and grandmother made schnitzel just like this, but you must try it with a squeaze of lemon, as some of the other reviewers have noted. It's a wonderful flavor (even though you might only think of squeazing lemon over fish - trust me, it's great). Consider serving it with cranberry sauce. In germany they have something like this, with small berries, but I haven't seen it here. Cranberry is close though.

Very European, my dh is from Prague and this is a staple in our diet.  To save on costs, I always purchase an entire pork loin roast, cut it in 3 portions and use for different meals.  Veal is expensive.  Take a piece of pork loin, slice and pound.  It's just as good as veal.  Also, if your taste is too bland (as others stated), make sure you take the pounded meat, dredge it in flour that is salted and peppered, dip in egg/milk misture (I salt/pepper it a bit too), and then dip in salted bread crumb mixture.  Face it, a lot of the seasoning gets lost in the frying.  Salting flour helps a ton and keep seasoning near the meat!  We serve with authentic german potato salad, and bread on the side. I'm american and this reminds me of our breaded tenderloin, so I like to have it on bread with cheese and ketchup (but don't tell anybody!)

This recipe has been in our family for decades and I too found it messy to prepare but worth the trouble and make it regularly with both veal and chicken.  Recently, I have started clarifying butter (up to 8 blocks at a time), storing in tupperware boxes in fridge and using it for frying with the addition of a little olive oil .  It remains clear and unburnt till the end of frying not matter how big the quantity is.  Frying time is no longer as dreaded and no clean up of black crusty bits in between batches.

Being from Germany, this is the way my family made Schnitzel all the time.  I prefer to double dip the meat with the coating.  If you also don't want to spend a lot for veal, you can use boneless pork chops and just pound them thin.  Great recipe!!

Soooo good!  I used Panko (Japanese Bread Crumbs) for a more crispy coating and it was wonderful.  I also followed other's advice by squeezing lemon juice over the top before serving.  Wow, that is just the thing that really sets the recipe apart from some similar American foods!  Forget the gravy on this one and pass around the LEMON!  Thanks for this tasty recipe.

This recipe produces a classic Wiener Schnitzel , i.e. a ( preferably ) veal cutlet in the encrusted Viennese manner . Follow this recipe and you will have a delicious meal .If you are having a meal in a fine Italian restaurant , e.g. il Mulino or il Nido in New York City , you may notice "cotoletta alla milanese" ( " cutlet according to Milan style " )on the menu .That is the Italian counterpart of the Austrian recipe for Wiener Schnitzel. There continues to be a dispute over which country was the originator of this delicious dish . Of course , the Italian recipe invariably calls for quality veal - it would be totally unacceptable in a fine restaurant to use other than veal . Be it "Wiener Schnitzel" or be it "cotoletta alla milanese" , the result in English is a delicious breaded veal cutlet. Gutes Essen ! Buon Appetito !

I used thinly sliced pork loin and pounded it to allow for faster cooking.  This is a great recipe--we lived in Germany for a year and Schnitzel was probably our favorite dish.  This turned out as well as our favorite restaurant there!  A few things that have helped me as I have tried to get the frying thing right: I lightly season the meat, the flour, the eggs, and the breadcrumbs (don't over salt any of them!) so the flavor wont come off in the oil; I also put each coated slice on a wire cooling rack and allow to sit for about 30 minutes (or sit in the fridge for awhile) to avoid having the crumb coating fall off in the oil; finally, after I pull them out of the oil I put them on a [different] wire cooling rack to ensure that they stay nice and crispy and don't get soggy.  I was very happy with the result. Delicious!

Delicious!!  I served it with homemade mushroom gravy, spaetzel, green beans, and topped it off with homemade cream puffs for dessert.  Tasted just like the wiener schnitzel served at Schmidt's German restaurant in Columbus, OH.  We all loved it.  I would say the prep and cook time was a little closer to an hour.

This is the exact same recipe I have been making for years.  When I first met the woman who is now my wife, I made this for her, and she loved it.  Now she makes it for me.  It's one of our all time favorites.  We squeeze a little fresh lemon juice over the top once plated.

Only one thing missing to make this really authentic (lived in Germany for years) and that's to soak the meat in lemon juice for 15 minutes before breading. Makes a world of difference.

Simple salt and pepper and a dash of lemon for seasoning is what I did.  I served this with lingonberries and potato salad.  My husband is German and this is probably one of the only meals I can do without having to decipher a recipe from a German cookbook.

Very tasty and quick to prepare.  Needed a little longer than 5mins on each side though.  Also a little messy.  Be careful, breadcrumbs tend to stick to pan!  Cooked it in honour of the Austrian Grand Prix.

I also am German, first generation to be born in the USA. My mom always made this when we were growing up. This is an authentic, classic recipe. Just wanted to say that what my mom always did first, was to get a kitchen mallet and pound her meat on both sides until it was paper thin. That's a step I always add. The only other changes I made were to add paprika to-taste, seasoning salt to-taste, and freshly cracked black pepper to the flour mixture first before dredging. And last, when she was frying the schnitzels, my mom always had extra beaten eggs and she would pour them in the pan when frying the schnitzels. The eggs never covered the schnitzel, but became attached and actually framed them. As kids, we loved having the scrambled eggs with the schnitzel. And I still love it now. Great recipe!

My husband really liked this, I used Italian seasoned breadcrumbs.  I floured the  pork cutlets and then put them in the fridge, and it really did help keep the crumbs stuck in place while cooking.  I will make this again.  I also squeezed lemon prior to serving.

My husband has been asking for wiener schitzel ever since we got back from a trip to Germany last year. This recipe was a huge hit and very authentic from what we had had in Europe. I used pork chops since that was what I had at home; I sauteed sliced mushrooms and onions in butter and melted pepperjack cheese and placed it on top. Delicious!

These came out great.  I followed the recipe as noted.  However, I bought veal strips that were already pretty thin, so I didn't need to cut them or pound them thin or anything.  Enjoyed the flavor and texture.

This recipe is just like my Oma made.  I have cut down on the mess of prep by putting my oil on a jelly roll pan and laying the cutlets in the oil and baking in the oven rather than frying on the stove.  It has worked much better for me that way and is way less time comsuming and all ready at the same time.  I use fresh lemon wedges to serve. -Udittri

Definitely a keeper!!  I didn't have veal but used sliced pork loin pounded thin instead.  I was out of oil so used butter for frying which I'm sure gave it a richer flavor.  I also served the meat with a wedge of lemon to sprinkle on top ... as I'd originally been taught years ago.  (Try it you might like it.)

This is pretty good; however, I like to use flavored bread crumbs, for a little bit more taste.  The lemon juice is definitely important, I don't think I ever saw it served in a Viennese restaurant without it.  Also, someone complained that the remaining breadcrumbs were wasted.  In Vienna, they often mix the remaining egg with the leftover breadcrumbs and make little "hushpuppies" out of it, to be fried in the same oil as the schnitzels (of course, they don't call them hushpuppies in Vienna).  My kids love this, it makes a tasty little extra.  Someone mentioned spaetzle to go with the schnitzel, but the authentic way is always potatoes, preferably Austrian potato salad (with a vinaigrette dressing and onions).  Don't believe the song from "Sound of Music" - Wiener Schnitzel is not to be served with noodles!

Great recipe! We used crisco vegetable oil and make sure that the veal was "swimming" in it.  It seemed to work well and actually did not absorb that much of the oil!  Make sure to tenderize it by pounding it to 1/4 of an inch.  Not as good as the Schnitzel I had in Austria but it was close!

OMG. This is delicious! Sooo much better than the schnitzel we get at our German Pavillion!!
I used pork cutlottes and made these slight adjustments:
-salt& peppered the cutlottes
-peppered the flour
-added more salt (.5 tsp) and pepper (1tsp) and 2 dashes of seasoning salt, 2 dashes of garlic powder & 1 dash of onion powder & added a shake of dried parsley. 
-added more oil as needed when frying.

It ended up soooo tasty & not bland at all!

You can also use pork instead of veal, and try frying it in butter-flavored Crisco. Yummy buttery taste, no burned butter.

Yummy!  I have been making my husband a different international meal a month since January.  I built tonight's menu around shnitzel which I had many times when I was in Germany.  This did not disappoint.  He loved it and so did I.  I did use pork.  Had the butcher slice a pork loin roast finger thick.  It was tender and delicious.  Spritzed it with lemon as recommended.  Rounded out the meal with Spaetzle, German Green Beans and an Apple Streudle.  All recipes found here this site.

As a European, Wiener schnitzel is a staple in our house. We buy the meat at the German butcher shop, always fresh and prepared for a schnitzel. Mashed potatoes is the favorite side dish with the meat and sometimes sauteed red cabbage or Hungarian cucumber salad. However, using ketchup with this delicious dish is a "cardinal sin" in this household.

Timeless and classic. Extremely simple to make. I baked these guys instead of frying, only because its healthier and has more flavor, personally speaking. Frying is a waste of oil, for the ones who are interested in saving money.

I made the Schnitzel a couple of days ago and my hubby loved it.  I did make a couple of small changes:  I made it  with 2 eggs as that was sufficient for 6 pieces I found, a slice of lemon on top and as vegetable I served red cabbage and roasted potatoes.  I did not use ketchup but had mustard and mayo ready.  I was out of vegetable oil so I used peanut oil and I am glad I did as it added a great flavour to this wonderful recipe.  (the left overs were gone in a hurry as the schnitzel is also great cold).  Overall a great recipe that I will use again and again.    A big thank you Carolin.

My grocer didn't carry veal, so I used some nice pork loins.  Pounded them out nice and thin and they came out excellent.  Almost as good as the best I ever had in Germany. Son and his girlfriend gave them an A+.  Part of that, no doubt to my incredible skillls as a chef.

A great quick dinner. Veal is hard to find sometimes, so I use pork too. I also like it using crushed saltines instead of bread crumbs, it comes out really crispy that way.

This was great.  We had 2 skillets going at once, and i used very thin cutlets of veal.  It did not take long at all for them to brown in the oil, surley less than a minute on each side.  After prepared,we squeezed lemon juice on it.  The lemon juice made it incredible!  Must have 2 people making it , one to coat veal, and one to watch it in skillet so it doesn't burn!!

My family loved this! But I think next time I'll double coat it, the breading didn't comb out perfectly.  Serve with cranberry sauce and a squeeze in the traditional German way.

Hubby and I went to Munich during Oktoberfest and I ordered Wiener Schnitzel made with turkey. (I don't eat veal, beef or pork.) It was awesome. Just buy thinly sliced raw turkey breast meat and follow this recipe. It is wonderful!!!

I made this after a visit to Munich. It was as good as some I ate there. I brought back some preiselbeerens from Munich as this is a common accompaniment. Preiselbeerens are wild cranberries.Some one told me that lingonberries
are the same thing and that they sell them at Ikea. Try them they are a wonderfull addition to this recipe!

Best meat I've ever cooked at my house! I used boneless pork chops in place of the veal. I salt & peppered the flour, egg/oil, and breadcrumbs that I dredged the meat in. It was very moist & flavorful. Not dry and bland like I thought it would be. Served with Hot German Potato Salad III from this site. Wonderful :)

4 stars!!! Pass on the lard, with this cost, use a liquid oil (sticks better) gravy is good w/mushrooms for jaeger schnitzel-squeeze little bit of lemon while frying.  Green salad goes great (bit of lemon w/oil, parsley & radishes.  Add small amount of water, salt, pepper, this was great thanx

This was delicious! My family used to eat schnitzel all the time when we lived in Switzerland. This tastes like what you find in a real German restaurant. I took the advice of other reviewers and added salt/pepper to the flour. I only had 1 cup of regular bread crumbs, so I added another cup of italian bread crumbs. 2 cups of crumbs was more than enough for the 5 pieces of veal that I had. Fresh squeezed lemon is also a must for this dish! Thanks for the recipe!

I coated the pork once and then let sit in fridge for about 30 mins before cooking. I also used Panko breading, and LOVED it. Very good.

So easy to prepare and sooooooo tasty! A dollop or "glop" of sour cream and a side of potato pancakes makes this a treat during the cold winter months.

This is a basic recipe for Wiener Schnitzel, but I have never seen it served with ketchup before. I'm not from Germany, but in Sweden we always serve them with Caprice and Anschovies file's on top.
The Anchovies should be placed on the schnitzel when it's still warm so that the Anchovies melt a little bit.
The Anchovies together with carprice makes the Schnitzel very tasty!

a little to bland., needs a lift.
I make mine with crushed Ritz Crackers,a
little pepper on the meat and fried in buttery Crisco.
It is the custom to squeeze lemon on the meat when serving.  Really adds to the taste.  
Then it's  a 5 ***** !
I like the idea of serving  green beans and finger potatoe dumplings with it.
I have also used chicken breasts...GREAT !

I used pounded, boneless pork chops.  Super easy, super quick and super good!  We put the schnitzel on good hamburger buns and ate as a quick sandwich.  I will be making this  often, good and tender.

I used lemon pepper seasoning in the flour, salt and pepper in the bread crumbs. A bit of milk added to the egg wash. It all turned out perfectly. Part of my husband's favorite meal.

This is how my Austrian Grandma would make them and the way i now do too all the time. No ketchup though! A squeeze of lemon is much better and served with a green bean salad/red cabbage and potatoes fried up with onion and chives.

I grew up in Vienna Austria  - schnitzel is our Christmas dinner staple.
Veal is traditional but I use pork (pounded thin).   Before dredging in flour, important to season with salt, pepper and garlic powder.   When frying, use a combination of butter and oil but watch your temperature as the butter will burn, but definately adds to the flavour.  Tradition is to serve with lemon wedges squeezed onto the crispy schnitzel.   Various options for leftovers too - reheat in oven (never microwave) Truly our favourite!!! BBKWJ

Without a doubt, worthy of 5 stars.  And take the advice of others and use some lemon.  I didn't have any fresh lemon so I used Lemon/Pepper spice.  Awesome!  The dw says it is a keeper.  I used some boneless pork chops that I pounded out to the appropriate thickness.  Great recipe to put in the rotation!

Very good. I used pork chops instead of veal, because we are not big veal fans. I pounded the pork chops very very thin and this came out great. I also only fried to just turn the outside brown and put them all in a dish and baked the rest of the way. We will definitely make again. Served with sauted onions and mushrooms on top.

This was the first time that I have tried to make wiener schnitzel and it tasted like any German restaurant that I have been to. I used panko for the first time to replace the bread crumbs, and it turned out fantastic! I will definitely make this again.

I love it, but may i suggest adding a sauce, maybe your own sauce, even campbells is good. Or a gravy. But other than that its very unique, like a mix of pork and fish.

Great, easy recipe!  Even my picky little girls liked this one!  I followed the recipe exactly and it was perfect.  The grocery store gave me a scallopine cut and it the perfect thickness so I will request that again.

Very tasty, not to mention easy and fairly quick. Veal can be a little pricey, but this is an easy one to whip up whenever you happen to find some on sale.

This was PERFECT! My husband and I are living in Germany now, and whenever we go out he always orders the Schnitzel. He also drizzles lemon juice like many other have suggested. Now i can make it for him at home! Thank you so much!

I don't use flour--it is very tasty and crisper with just bread crumbs!  also, the first side of the schnitzel cooks slower (around 2-3 minutes) on medium heat (the oil should sizzle when you put the meat in).  However, when you flip the schnitzel it cooks much faster!  so reduce the heat before you flip so it can cook a good 1-2 minutes.  i use plain bread crumbs and put all my seasoning in to the egg (garlic powder, onion powder, herbes de provence/or italian seasoning, salt, pepper).  delicious!!

I used pork instead of veal, and decreased the cooking time because the pork was thinner than what the recipe called for.  I was raised half in Germany, and half in the U.S., so I know from first hand experience, that this is as close as it comes to an authentic German schnitzel! Yum!  Thanks for the great recipe!

My family made a similar recipe when I was growing up because my father had discovered it while stationed in Austria when he was in the army.  Our variation is:  after the cutlets are cooked, remove from pan, add butter to the drippings then squeeze lemon into the pan to sizzle and cook for a minute or so (it takes the bite out of the lemon).  Pour some of the lemon butter sauce over the schnitzel and reserve the rest to drizzle on brocolli or potato sides.  I made it with turkey cutlets already sliced to a nice thickness straight from the grocery store.

This tasted just like the original Wiener Schnitzel I have enjoyed so many times during my childhood vacations in Austria! I followed the instructions exactly, using bread crumbs from a package my aunt brought home from her vacation in Austria, and the schnitzels turned out golden brown and crisp. A bit of lemon juice sprinkled over the schnitzels finished the recipe.

Starting at the grocery store with a "let's have a German dinner", we feasted well with this recipe.  Veal was $10+ per pound, but thin sliced chicken breast was less than half that -- so we made "puten schnitzel".  (Most restaurants we visited in Germany had veal, aka wiener, and turkey, aka puten, options... our chicken worked great) I picked this recipe as it fried, but didn't DEEP fry the meat.  For 6 generous sized portions, I managed on 2 eggs and 2-3 cups of bread crumbs.  Watch the pan's heat, though, as it's a quick change from well cooked to overly dark.  We served this with speatzle, cucumber salat, German potato salat, and store bought pretzel bread. Wunderbar!  My high schooler took a piece of meat on pretzel bread with mustard for lunch today -- and wants it again tomorrow. Guten appetit!

Thank you for this recipe. I love German food... :)
To jazz it up I added dried parsley, 1/2 tsp crushed chilis, and 1/4 cup grated parm cheese to the bread crumbs. Not exactly authentic, but if you don't tell anyone they will comment on how moist the veal is, and how crispy the coating!

I remember thinking as I was eating my first Weiner Schnitzel in Cologne, Germany that, gosh, we have this back home, but we use a little older meat and call it Chicken-Fried-Steak! The quality of the meat is about half the deal (Tony's in Houston uses pounded Sirloin), the rest is the seasoning. Lemon works great for veal or pork or chicken but, with beef, stick with bacon-dripping cream gravy! Funny what happens when Old World favorites meet the realities and ingredients of the New World.

I got a different version of this recipe from my foreign exchange brother  when he came to live with us. The variation uses beef pounded into very very thin patties and a seasoning that i believe has garlic powder, salt, parsley and some other seasonings. Anyways, i really love this dish, it's so delicious, and we  fried up like 4 dozen patties one time for a party. Everyone loved it.

I used chicken instead of veal. I found it to be a bit bland w/ just salt and pepper, but I do love a thin breast in a crunchy coating like this.  This recipe definately has potential w/ a little spicing up.  It was a good basic fried chicken cutlet recipe.

Easy and tasty. I made this with pork loin, cut thin and pounded thinner. Had some bacon fat in the fridge and used that to cook in. Not the healthy option, I know, but man, it was good! Served with boiled potatoes and green beans.

This recipe is the closest I've found to the real thing. I used pork cutlets instead of veal, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. The cutlets turned out really crispy and light, and the leftovers were amazing the next day even after reheating in he the  microwave! Can't wait to make these again...

I used a 2 lb pork loin, sliced 1/4 in. thick then pounded very thin. Made a station with large paper plates for easy clean-up with flour, eggs, and bread crumbs. I seasoned the meat and flour with s&p. I let them sit an hour in the fridge which helped the flour mixture adhere, then fried in oil with an added T of butter only a couple min. per side since mine were so thin. Drizzled with lemon juice then kept first batches in a 200 degree oven on a wire rack while remaining batches cooked. Served with applesauce and lemon wedges...delicious!

Nitpicky issues prevent 5 stars: You would never see this made "as thick as your finger" without pounding thinner.  Also, as suggested by others, always season flour when dredging and don't forget the lemon wedge on the plate.

Great recipe. When I was stationed in Germany I would eat this on a roll a few times a week. What they used was pork tenderloin pounded thin, floured, dipped into egg then breadcrumbs. The they would deep fry it and serve it on a roll with German mustard (seinf) and pomfrites. I made mine this way and it was excellent but I couldn't get the real German mustard so I used Dijon. And I washed it down with a German October fest beer from Germany.

Pretty good schnitzel but I have had better. I made it along with home-made deep fried mashed potatoes, home-made mushroom sauce and tossed salad. This was a favorite meal I had in a restaurant in Germany over the summer that I tried to recreate. I would make it again, but like I said, I have had better.

It was ok, but not for us.  I think you need a really skinny piece of meat to make this recipe work.  I may try it again later, but was quite disappointed as the meat never cooked all the way through.

Schnitzel is about as Austrian as you can get!  Lived in Vienna for many years, and most folks made this with very thin pork cutlets, which have been pounded even thinner.  In Austria, this is served with "gemischten Salat" - mixed salad, e.g., potato, cucumber, green.  Definitely not with French fries and ketchup!

I used pork instead of veal as many other people did.  I should say my husband did, he made it.  I served German potato salad and applesauce with it.  Next time will try some lemon on it as suggested by others.  Also will make or buy some dark German bread to go with the meal.  Good recipe.

After living in Germany for 3 years I thought this was a pretty good schnitzel recipe.  When I made this schnitzel I was trying to avoid having to go to the store, so I pounded some boneless pork chops that were in the freezer to about 1/4 inch thick.  I was a little annoyed because the breading was a little soggy, but I probably messed something up.  My family loved it and requested I make it again, and that's always a good sign.  We'll definitely have this again, but I think I'll try it with veal next time.

Used pork sirloin instead of veal. Very good recipe; simple and authentic. Keep in mind that cooking times may vary depending on the thickness of the meat.

I used 2 lbs. of boneless pork steaks, pounded very thin. I then prepared just as the recipe described, but ended up using a little less flour and only half of the bread crumbs specified. Next time I make this I am planning to maranade the pork in Italian dressing or some other concoction for a few hours first.
Make this dish, you will be glad you did.

My whole family LOVED this!  Tasted just like the weiner schnitzel we ate in Austria a few years ago.  When the meat was done cooking, I threw some cooked green beans in the pan and added a bit of butter and chopped pecans.  Excellent!  My kids have never eaten so many green beans.  Thanks!

Very quick and easy. Taste was ok but thought it could use a little more flavoring in the coating - and that is even after I used italian bread crumbs.

I didn't care for this recipe.I felt like the bread crumbs could have used more seasoning. My husband, who is very picky, loved it (so I am giving it four stars). The addition of lemon juice did improve the taste.

PERFECT German schnitzel!  My husband and I are German and we absolutely love this recipe. It is just as good as any schnitzel I have had in Germany - if not better.

I'm sure if I had lived in Germany at some point in my life, this recipe would have some sort of sentimental value and somehow hit the spot... but it really didn't do much for me. It was pretty good as far a flavor, but the crust was really easy to flake off in the pan if you flipped the meat so many times and also it was kind of messy to dip all the pieces into flour, egg, and bread crumbs. Overall okay, but not worth the hassle for the result that is produced.

You can make this dish even more delicious if you put the ground pepper directly over the meat. Another trick is to use butter instead of oil. Try it, it tastes so much different!!!

I should make this exactly but I can’t condone the modern raising of veal so I used pork butt steaks. The trick is the coating , let it stand/dry on a rack for 30-45 minutes before frying . Nice and crispy.

This was a very tasty dish. I usually don't make changes to recipes but this one I did. My European mother who was an excellent cook made this all the time and she did two things that are not listed here. I added a bit of dried thyme to the egg mixture and this brings out a nice flavour in the coating. When all was done on the plate, I squeezed half a lemon over the meat which really makes for a nice finish. Will definitely make this again. Thank you for a great recipe.

I made this last night, but I used pork cutlets. I pounded them out until they were nice and thin. I seasoned my plain breadcrumbs with garlic powder, onion powder, sea salt, and black pepper. I also put just a little season salt in my flour. They came out perfectly! The schnitzel was nice and crispy. I only eat my schnitzel with lemon juice and salt. I lived in Frankfurt for 3 years and  Heidelberg for 3 as well. Schnitzel was definitely a staple in our diet over there. I served cucumber salad and fried potatoes with it last night. My family of five loved it.

Very easy if you have basic skills in the kitchen just be careful with the hot oil, don’t let it get too hot and gauge your time per side relative to how hot your oil is.  Don’t over cook.
I also like to gently flatten the veal with a flat hammer and get it to a very thin piece.  It takes no time to cook even with the breading.  Delicious.

I used pork loin and didn’t slice it thin enough for our tastes, but still a delicious recipe! Next time I’ll slice the meat thinner before I pound it, and use FINE bread crumbs. As I fried them, I held them in the over on a rack at 200 degrees. Hubby was missing the Jaeger sauce, but said it was still good. With whole pork loin on sale here for $1.48/lb, I’ll certainly be making this again!

I took the advice of the "double-dippers", and the lady that advised soaking the cutlets in lemon juice.  I think without that extra step of lemon juice, adding a squeeze of lemon wouldn't have even made them so good.  The flavor was spot-on to my favorite corner restaurant in Germany.  But, we had a huge problem having the coating staying on the cutlet.  Funny, and it made for messy eating, but the taste was spot on!  I will research this and definitely make them again!

We're on a budget, so I made mine with boneless pork chops instead of veal. I found them a little bland, but not bad. Definitely needed a healthy squeeze of lemon at the table to brighten it up a bit.

Both my parents were born in the Czech republic. Growing up this was a common meal in my house. Usually served with potatoes or cold potatoes salad and red cabbage.  I used seasoned breadcrumbs as that's what I had and made with chicken breast (flattened). What I LOVE is that this tastes better cold the next day too! My chicken took 3 minutes on each side on medium heat. (You can also have a pan ready in the oven at 425 to cook for 3-5  minutes if needed).

I make this regularly.  I pound the veal down to about 1/4 inch to tenderize it a bit.  Also, "Serve with ketchup and french fries"?  Since Carolin claims to be aus Deutschland, she must know that a mushroom sauce (for Jaeger Schnitzel) and Spaetzle are the proper accompaniments.

This is a good standard recipe. Substituting the frying oil with clarified butter makes this already delicious comfort food amazing. Serve with lemon or a simple gravy. To avoid a mess on your hands when cooking, try to just use one hand to transfer between plates. That will keep you from having to run to the sink after each portion to scrape the goop off your hands.

I like to squeeze lemon juice on it before I eat. This is pretty much like the schnitzel I would eat when I lived in Germany. They have the best food. I also like to have German potatoes with it and maybe a little slaw.

I recently tried veal schnitzel in Salzburg, Austria, and out of the 6 countries we went to…that was hands down the BEST meal we had on our honeymoon! For our anniversary, I decided to try to make it again (along with a German dessert- dampfnudel, you must look that one up on Allrecipes- fabulous!). 
I followed the directions precisely, the only thing I did differently was tenderizing the veal just slightly. I bought thin cut veal, so it was already quite thin, but I pounded it out just a little to make it even. I have never cooked wiener schnitzel or veal in my life, so I was very nervous about cooking the meat all the way through and getting a nice crispy crust- it came out utterly perfect. The ONLY thing I would change, would be adding butter to the oil in the pan. My husband commented that looking back on our meal in Austria, the only difference he could taste was maybe a more buttery flavor, otherwise it was fantastic. Make SURE you have it with a squeeze of lemon, it wouldn’t be the same without! Overall, we were in heaven! Thank you so much for sharing this recipe, it is certainly a keeper.

Simple recipe. Ingredients always on hand. Good recipe. Pounding the meat is one way, also try using a sharp knife and cut through the middle of a thick chicken breast, (filet). Not nessessary to pound it then.
Actually, this is how I have always made my chicken, and pork. My husband and I have gone to Germany several times over the years and the Weiner schnitzel, or Jaegerschnitzel, or just simple schnitzel was always one of our favorites, and often times I had it 3xs a week at various restaurants! Never disappointed. Lemon squeezed on top was the best!

Made this as a "throw it together" recipe with stuff in our kitchen. Used pork tenderloin sliced and pounded thin, and instead of bread crumbs I used some ritz crackers. Ultimately I liked the recipe, but I had to add a ton of lemon juice to make it better. It was very bland on its own. Also it took a long time for our pork tenderloin to fry up in the pan, maybe like 10 minutes per side, and we ended up burning them because of it (even using varying heat settings). So I don't recommend using pork tenderloin for this one, better off using some other cut of meat. But that is my own fault - I was just throwing together a meal from what we had lying around! Either way, definitely throw in some lemon. We had wiener schnitzel in Berlin last year with lemon on the side, it was divine, and now I can't imagine eating schnitzel without lemon.

I added about an 1\8 tsp each of garlic powder, celery seed and onion powder to the breading. It was great.

Oh the groans of culinary ecstasy were resounding within the walls of our home tonight!!  Wiener Schnitzel is my husband's most favorite dinner.  It brings back memories of his German grandmother making it for the family.  

This was really, really good.  I was heavy handed with the salt and pepper which I think the recipe called to be added in with the egg/oil mixture.  My family loved it (especially my husband).  My son, thinking ahead, asked if I would make this for his birthday in 2 months!

The first time i have ever made or ate this dish and it was LOVED by all. First I used Pork tenderloin instead of veal. Also, I added seasoning salt and pepper to the flour, Tabasco sauce to the egg mixture, and seasoning salt to the bread crumbs. Hubby said he would love to try them with gravy next time, and I think I will oblige him! I served the schnitzel with Mashed potatoes and 'Grandma Jeannette's German Red cabbage' (recipe on the site!) the tastes meshed so well! Don't forget the squeeze of fresh lemon, it really added to the flavor!

We serve this with brown gravy and spaetzle  and red cabbage - both recipes from this site -  or sliced raw kohlrabi if we want something a little lighter, and its a favorite for special occasions

This worked really well and the breading stayed on which is always my biggest goal with breaded meats.  I think that if I made my own bread crumbs instead of using canned and maybe used lard or a butter/shortening blend it would taste very authentic.  It did make me crave the lemon slice that is served on it in my region of Germany.  I will use this recipe again. I seasoned the meat and used thin cut pork chops.

I used cube steaks and seasoned my 1/2 cup of flour with 2 tsp salt and 1/2 tsp pepper. Once my steaks were coated with the bread crumbs I let them sit for about 10 minutes for the breading to set then cooked them. When they were cooked, I sprinkled with lemon juice and served them with a fried egg on top. We loved it! Served with German potato salad and grilled okra.

What a wonderful recipe!  Easy to make and very delicious.  I used pork instead of veal and my cooking time was different because of the thickness of the meat.

I made this with pork loin schnitzel I found at the meat counter. I added seasoning salt to the bread crumbs and mmmmmmm. My entire family loved this recipe. We ate it one night with lemon served with veggies and potatoes. A few days later I made it again but put it on Kaiser buns with Havarti cheese and a spicy mustard. Hit number 2 with the entire family--and that NEVER happens!

Very good. I didn't use veal. Instead I used pork and beat the crude out of it and used meat tenderizer to ensure my 10 month old could easily chew it.

This was very yummy.  I did use Pork Cube Steak.  My husband loved it!  I did make some brown gravy for the top.  I would have loved some warm german potato salad but instead just did mashed potatoes and peas.

These were fantastic, however, I think 4 cups of bread crumbs is way too much.  I probably used only 2 1/2, and ended up having to throw the rest away.  Yummy, though.

Even the little ones enjoyed this meal.  I made it with German Potato Salad for a quasi-traditional meal and my husband said the meal was just like his mother used to make.  Quite a compliment.

This was very good.  Added some lemons to squeeze over the meat to duplicate our local German Resturant.

So, so, so simple BUT OOOH SOOOO wonderful!  I now use this recipe for chicken (the kid's favorite) and cube steaks.  A definite keeper!

I don't eat (much) beef, so I tried this with ground turkey, and it tasted very good as well - especially with ground-up dry herb stuffing used in a pinch for breadcrumbs. I'm not much for western European food (I prefer spicier stuff such as Thai or Arabic cooking, most of the time), but this came out quite good, and the recipe's English was clear and comprehensible (never fear!)
