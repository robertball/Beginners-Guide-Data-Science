I love your idea of using lemon zest and double coating the asparagus! Might I suggest placing the seasonings in the flour instead of the buttermilk because most of the seasoning will simply drip off before being rolled in the flour otherwise. If it's in the flour it will stick.

I accidentally left the lemon zest out of the first batch, but it was still great. I advise putting the seasonings in the buttermilk because I had to change out the flour about three times. It got really gooey after the first few spears.

This makes great finger food, appetizers, snacks. My son who does not like asparagus could not get enough of them! WARNING!!! THESE ARE ADDICTIVE!!! 
It makes a great alternative to such a usually misunderstood vegetable.

Did  make a couple of changes to work better for me.  Season your flour and use a second dipping station with Panko seasoning. The first dip  you get it wet enough to  coat in flour  dip again  and roll in the panko then fry. Talk about tender and crunchy they were great.But it did take some time to dip and roll one at a time but the smiles were worth it !!!!
