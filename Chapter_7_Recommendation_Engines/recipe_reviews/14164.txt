I just found this recipe last weekend and I've already made it twice. It's also great filling for pita sandwiches...spinch included. I added a little red onion for a kick but this has a wonderful and bright flavor of it's own.

This is such a nice change from your regular tuna salad. I absolutely love it. The only changes I made was not adding cashews (don't like them) and instead of adding all the mayo, I just use half a tbsp of mayo and the rest I use hot mustard. I also freeze ginger root and then grate some onto it. Frozen ginger grates into a wonderful powder.
I will be making this recipe all the time now. Thanks Edie!

A marvelous combination of flavors that make a luncheon or hot summer evening supper very special. I made this recipe three times. The ginger was a bit overpowering in the recipe as given here. I then used mandarin oranges and mixed in some of the juice to offset the ginger (but did not reduce the ginger). Third time, I added seedless white and red grape halves without any mandarin orange juice. Guests were impressed!

When i make this again I will do as the other reader. Less Ginger. It made it a lttle bitter. Needed salt too. I blame it mostly on the orange I used, wasn't in season and not sweet enough. I will try it again though.

This is delicious! I increased the lemon juice & reduced the ginger to 3/4 tsp. No salt & pepper needed. Yum!

This took me two minutes to make and it was delicious! Usually I just make my tuna salad with lime juice and olive oil so it was a great change. I grated fresh ginger - a great ingredient to help fight off a cold!

I really enjoyed this tuna salad. I take my lunch to work and this ginger/citrus blend was lovely in a container with baby spinach. It is in my lunch rotation from this point on, as it is tasty, healthy, and affordable.

I thought that this recipe was disgusting.The ginger was too overpowering even with it being halfed and it was way too dry for my liking. I even added more mayo to try to moisten it up and take away a bit from the ginger taste and it didn't help at all.
 I won't be trying this again. Disappointing as I had high hopes for it.

This recipe was very tasty. I used the mandarin oranges, added extra cashews (to my liking), and used half of the called for ginger, per the recommendations of the other reviewers.  I wasn't sure if I'd like this, but I was impressed.

This is a great tuna salad for those not fond of tuna to begin with. The orange and ginger pulls the fishyness right out. The cashews give a it nice tooth as well. I serve it with any green or cracker.

Tasty twist on the everyday tuna, I used a little less ginger and I used manderin oranges since they are easy to peel and already bite sized and I had no cashews so I substituded sliced almonds :).

I added a few cherry tomatoes. I also used fresh grated ginger. I thought it was delicious. A very nice change to typical tuna. I ate it on Hawaiian Bread today for lunch after making it last night and it was excellent. It will definitely be a regular recipe in my house. I can't wait to share it.

This is one of the better tuna salad recipes on this site.  It had lots of flavor and I didn't even add any salt.  I did use two tbs mayonnaise instead 1.5 and I cut the orange in half.  I also used lettuce instead of spinach.

Liked it, but not my absolute favorite.  Only change I made was using canned mandarin oranges.  Might try again with solid white tuna... May help with the presentation.

Loved!! Didn’t use as much ginger. I added in mandarin oranges fruit cup drained, instead of fresh oranges. Served in a whole wheat pita with more spinach and a squeeze of lemon on top. Sooo good!

Maybe if we had had oil packed tuna on, we would have liked this much more (I always buy oil packed, and my husband always buys the water packed, but he rarely eats the tuna he buys, leaving it for me... when I don't care for it nearly as well as the oil packed....). That said, we felt like the flavor of the tuna in this salad fought everything in the salad that was really special. I mean, when we first tasted the tuna salad, it was really great, but then the taste of the tuna would overpower the pleasantness, which was unpleasant even though I *like* tuna.  I've been wondering if substituting apples and celery might work better. I mean, this was nice enough on some brioche that we needed to use up to avoid freezer burn. But I tried a little on some various crackers we had on hand, and none of them worked *for me*.  While we enjoyed trying something different, and the bursts of orange were enjoyable, this did not sell us.  It seems like a fabulous recipe for chicken - and we might eat it that way...., and it really, really was okay in a pinch.  We just won't have it again.

Well, it's definitely not your traditional tuna salad.  Flavor is good, with cutting ginger to 1/2t.  Keep in mind that the cashews will get soggy if you don't eat this right away. Not 100% sold on the oranges with tuna, but I think this recipe would be really good with chicken.
