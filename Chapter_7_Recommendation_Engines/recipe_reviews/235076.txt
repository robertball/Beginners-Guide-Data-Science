First, I have to say that I like how this soup breaks down nutritionally (at least for those not following a low carb diet).  As I suspected, the soup turned orange from the carrot (almost looks like butternut squash), but it adds great flavor.  Cauliflower doesn't really have a lot of flavor, but this soup is anything but bland.  I used my immersion blender, and the soup was very thick, so I did have to thin out with a little chicken broth and water.  You'll have to adjust the consistency to your preference which is certainly not meant as a negative.  Thanks, newmommy, for a nice new soup recipe.

I sauted the onions and the carrots in a little olive oil for about 5 min on low. I added the chopped potatoes and chopped cauliflower and sauted them for a few min with the onions and carrots. Then added the rest of the ingredients. Excellent and very flavorful.  I will definitely make this again!

I added some fresh dill and a pinch of cumin (a similar recipe on AR called for those) and it was delicious. I had the choice between yellow, purple, and orange carrots and I chose the purple one thinking it would come out purple tinted, but of course it didn't. should have used orange, lol. anyway, great recipe.

This is simple and foolproof. Comfort food indeed!  I had close to 2 cups of mashed potatoes leftover from dinner the night before, so I blended them in at the last instead of cooking potatoes in the broth. It was delicious and none leftover.

This recipe is easy to make nutritious.  That being said, will not make again as it is VERY bland and lacks much flavor,

I loved the soup. Omitted the carrot as I didn't have any but didn't effect the soup at all. Still turned out good.

I added some Italian herbs for some extra flavour, then pureed it in a blender and did not add the milk. It made a nice bisque, fast and easy to make. Serve with crackers and cheese.

Was pretty good, did need a lot of salt for my taste, but was inexpensive and have plenty leftover :)
