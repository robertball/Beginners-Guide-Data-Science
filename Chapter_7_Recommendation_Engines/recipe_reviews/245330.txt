They look adorable, but are extremely time consuming and messy. I am not a huge fan of the flavour either. Cream cheese and Oreo cookies is not all that pleasant. They took much more chocolate to coat than the recipe calls for and were not a clean ball as illustrated. The White chocolate gets muddied with the cookie balls, so I had to melt the chocolate in small batches. In the end I didn't even bother to decorate them because it was just too long a process. A disappointing endeavour. UPDATE: January 2016-my son decided he loved these so I made another attempt. Using suggestions by others I stuck a toothpick in each ball which I formed after rubbing my hands in veg oil so the muck didn't stick. Then I dipped them in the White chocolate and there was minimal transfer and they actually didn't look too bad. Keeping the balls well chilled helped and I set the chocolate in a hot water bath to keep it liquid. He loves the flavour, so he got the whole batch to share with his work friends.

I agree with other reviewers that these were difficult to coat. They are quite time consuming but here are a few changes I made to make the decorating easier. I froze them a bit longer and only took half out of the freezer at a time. I also kept the chocolate in smaller batches to keep it "clean". Finally, I used a toothpick in the ball to use for dipping. It's easy enough to fix that small spot with either more frosting or decoration than if you are using your hands to dip these.

So easy and fun to do. I made two batches. One with Andys peppermint chocolate to dip them in and one following the directions. Both are scrumptious! Thank you for the recipe.

I have been making these for years and they are a HUGE hit with everyone.  I have made them for Easter with pastel colors in the chocolate, Halloween with orange and black, for Christmas I have not done the "snowman" idea but have used red and green chocolate as well as sprinkles on the white chocolate before it sets.  You get a lot of balls out of this recipe because you don't want to make them too big as they are very rich.

Made this for Christmas dessert.  The family ranted and raved over it!  We couldn't stop eating them although very very rich.  The key is to pulverize the oreos to a dust like consistency.  This is what makes the dessert creamy.  No one was able to guess what the ingredients were.  They were amazed when I told them how simple they are to make.

Easy to make....Not!!!!!! Sorry, be these were an absolute nightmare on Christmas Eve! I do not own a food processor, so crushed the Oreos with a pestle. Then the remaining pellets by hand. That took time. I oiled my hands, so forming the dough with the mixture w/softened cream cheese was fine, but time consuming. I must not have an ounce of patience!! Then comes the nightmare. I used white baking chocolate like the recipe says. I did not have a Pyrex bowl, so used a small measuring cup and heated small batches of chocolate. The chocolate seemed to take an eternity to melt. Then applying the chocolate to the frozen balls was nuts!! Tried two forks, a toothpick, a spoon. It is all in the timing. This is a very messy recipe & might be okay, once you figure out what works best and the timing. The chocolate turns to glue quickly. You have to work really fast. Maybe Almond Bark would work better. I knew going into this it might be a fiasco, but never dreamed it would be this bad. “Ain’t nobody got time for this!!” Or if you do, you are a Saint. This recipe was exhausting. I was looking for something “no bake,” because my oven is broken. Next time I will do something with Jello.

I’ve been making these for years!  I sometimes do different variations with other flavors of Oreos. They are always a hit. They are simple to make. My 3 year old granddaughter can even do this with help! 
They are a bit time consuming but if you like to bake it’s no big deal. I read some of the not so great reviews and I’m convinced those people either can’t bake or don’t enjoy it. These are delicious! In my opinion anyone who doesn’t like them has no palate.

I've made these a few times.  For those who are having trouble rolling into balls, moist hands make for easier rolling.  Dipping them in the chocolate when they are frozen is an easy method for coating them, but be careful of you coating temp so it doesn't get too cold as you go.  Otherwise they are yummy and very easy to make

Freezing the dough means that when you put it into the white chocolate, the chocolate is cooled. So instead, only use one bar of chocolate at a time, and reheat it a bit after each batch of dough balls that you put in. That will keep it from getting too cookies and cream-ish (so the choc stays white and the dough doesn't break up) and the choc makes it all the way through your dough balls.

Concept is good, but implementing is another story. They do taste better after sitting for a day. What makes this a 2 star is the dipping. We tried with almond bark & with white baking chocolate chips.  Both were a pain to do. As for the cookie & cream cheese mixture, that is fine. Don't know if we'll make again or not.

While the basic directions are easy, my cookies didn't look like the picture.  First, it's difficult to roll the balls into perfect little circles; some of the cookie/cream cheese came off in the white chocolate mixture, so many of my little snowmen looked like they'd rolled around in the dirt.  And finally, they were way too sweet for my taste.

I will not make this again.  I thought it would be easy as stated but this dessert was a hot mess.  The chocolate got muddy from the cookie balls & it was very hard to get these balls coated.  I made two pans of balls & was only able to coat one pan of cookies & not all of those were coated before the chocolate seemed to get hard. I was so disappointed since I wanted to take these to a party. I have to agree with the comment Beth made.

I received a dozen of these in our cookie exchange - my family loved them so much these did not get shared with others as all were eaten by us!  Delicious - tastes like a truffle.  My kids demanded that I get the recipe because they loved these so much, and dear hubby loved them too. I don't even like oreo cookies, but I thought these tasted wonderful.
