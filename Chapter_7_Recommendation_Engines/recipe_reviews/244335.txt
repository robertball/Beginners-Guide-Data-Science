So easy to make. You can use leftover pork roast or any protein. I used cheddar soup since a previous comment said it was too salty with broccoli cheddar soup.

This warrants a five for the simplicity, but it's  rather salty, and this is because the broccoli cheese soup is not diluted. I'm not sure I'll make it again without changing it. This was certainly better than the Dixie Pork stir fry (another recipe from Smithfield).
