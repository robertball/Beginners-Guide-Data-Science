I made this last night. It wasn't bad. It tasted pretty much like lasagna. It was easier than lasagna is though so I will probably use this recipe again. 3 out of 4 kids ate it up so that is always good. Served it with a salad and bread.

This couldn't be simpler and worked like a charm, the very first time.  I used Penne noodles and farm fresh beef.  This was so good and my kids loved it!  I saved 1/3 of the leftovers for tomorrow and the rest I froze for later.  Will post again to see how it thawed.

I have made this a couple times. My two boys love it and ask for it all the time. I added Johnsonville Beef Brats. Cut them to bite size. Also we added more cheese. Add a saled and rolls and you might have leftovers. Great the next day at work
