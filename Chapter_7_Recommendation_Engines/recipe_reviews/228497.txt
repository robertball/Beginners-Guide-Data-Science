I enjoyed this recipe- made a few changes to accommodate what I had in my kitchen- cottage cheese instead of ricotta, frozen spinach instead of fresh, add chili pepper for a kick and a small bit of cooked Italian sausage to the jar of pasta sauce- So flavorful!

This was good with a couple of modifications.  I questioned the use of thyme so I added a small amount to the filling in a separate container and tasted it.  Didn't seem to work for me so I used basil instead and it made the dish great.  I did add some extra cheese but followed everything else as written.

I made this recipe without the mushrooms and used fresh made alfredo sauce instead of traditional tomato sauce.  It turned out great!  My daughter (6) got a kick out of helping me fill the giant shells.

Made this but used meat in my sauce. Added Italian sausage and ground chuck mix to tomato sauce. I also added 1/2 cup of meat to ricotta mix... Awesome modifications to make a hearty Sunday dinner!

With the spices we added an easy 5 stars.  Added fresh garlic and onion--I sauteed them for a minute and then added the carrot, mushies and spinach.  Everyone loved it.  Thanks!

Awesome taste!  Can substitute ricotta cheese for 2 % cottage cheese and then drain the cottage cheese...excellent flavour.  We like substituting nutmeg for the thyme.

I really enjoyed this recipe.  It was quick and easy to make.  I replaced the ricotta cheese with cottage cheese and it was delicious.  We will certainly make it again.

The recipe is very easy to follow. I doubled the mushrooms though, and used chopped frozen spinach - just thaw it, drain it, and add it to the mushrooms after they're mostly cooked, and let the spinach get hot. I did sub a goodly pinch of  dried rosemary leaves plus basil and oregano to taste, rather than the thyme. Turned out scrumptious. Thanks for sharing!

Great recipe. I've made this dish many times over the past few yrs. I like to add  a little fresh basil, Some cinnamon, and  crushed red pepper flakes to the filling.

The filling base is fantastic but I learned that Thyme is not my thing. I'll omit that altogether next time but overall a delicious and easy dish.

I loved this recipe.  I substituted the garlic cloves with  puree, and instead of using thyme, I used oregano.  I'll definitely be cooking this one again.
