This was a BIG hit when my in laws came for Sunday dinner. My sister in law is a vegetarian so I always try to make something to accomaodate all. This was perfect with meatballs on the side for meat lovers and garlic bread. I just made a few changes. I omitted the nutmeg and basil and opted instead for a lil Italian seasoning. I used fresh broccoli instead. I steamed it for 5 minutes in the microwave, chopped into tiny pieces, and tossed it with a pinch of garlic powder before adding it to the ricotta mixture. This dish was very tasty and very easy to make. It made a beautiful presentation. My husband has asked for it again and my daughter, who is almost 1, loved it as well.  I'll be making this for my daughters first birthday party since it's perfect to assemble ahead of time and just heat on the big day. A definite keeper.

This is a good, easy dish to prepare.  I've made it once just like the recipe and another time with a little less broccoli and some ground beef.  Both turned out great!

We have updated this recipe to fix the amount of nutmeg listed in the ingredients. It should not have been 2 teaspoons, but rather 1/4 teaspoon. We apologize for the inconvenience.

This was a big hit with the three pickiest eaters on the planet. I have added it to my recipe box and will definitely make it again. The addition of the green onions gave it a needed kick (plus my kids couldn't see the pale green onions mixed in with the white cheese, so there was no "Yuck! What's this?")

Very good and fairly easy.  I had to use chopped spinach, since that's all I had.  Tossed about 1/2 cup crumbled feta cheese into the filling to use it up.  Put just a pinch of red pepper flake in filling to spice it up.  Great meatless dish - will make again!

I've made a variation of this recipe many times.  It can be varied to your liking.  I use spinach instead of brocolli.  To the ricotta I add a four blend cheese you can buy.  Mozzarella, Provolone, Asiago and Romano.  It is the provolone that livens the flavor.  I suggest sauteing the onions and or garlic in olive oil and adding it to sauce along with the seasonings. (basil)If using ground beef, saute first and drain off the excess fat.
Nutmeg is OK to add to the cheese mixture but only a dash.
One ingredient I've used to stiffen the cheese is Tofu.  It does not alter the flavor but keeps the cheese firm.

I made these for supper club.  I used cream cheese instead of ricotta cheese because the alfredo version called for that and I wanted to keep things simple.  I also added a little chopped, cooked chicken to the filling.  It was delicious.  Very good reheated as well.

I wasn't overly impressed with this recipe.  It sounded wonderful though.  I think I would have liked spinach instead of the broccoli.  I will make again but will try it with spinach and see how that goes.  I just thought this recipe was "just ok."

Really good.  Easy to make, and tastes great.  Kids like the spiral shapes.  Will make this again.

This is one of my favorite vegetarian dishes ever!  The only changes I make is to use fresh spinach instead of broccoli, fresh basil instead of dried, and I omit the nutmeg (not a big fan of nutmeg).  I have made this for the pickiest of kids and they cleaned their plates!  I have a small family of 3, so I always freeze about half of the spirals in a ziplock bag.  Then, when I get ready to make it again, I just thaw the spirals out, put them in the pan, pour the spaghetti sauce over it, top it with cheese, and bake.  Tastes just as good the second time!  Wonderful!

My mom and I make this a lot, but we decided to follow someone else's recipe. I find that the filling was a little bland, so we're going to stick with out version.

I recently started eating healthy and was happy to try out this low calorie version of a classic. I took the suggestion of others and used a 16 oz bag of spinach instead of Broccolli and omitted the green onions and nutmeg. I didn't like this dish to me it need way less spinach (I only used 16 oz vs 20) more cheese and more sauce. The spinach just took over the dish and the sauce barely covered the noodles, in addition I found the taste to be bland and lacked something. I think I'll stick with a cheese or meat version from now on.

This dish was a hit!  I uses whole wheat lasagna noodles and pre-cooked them.  Also, I didn't "spiral" up the dish, instead I layered the items to make a more traditional lasagna. Everyone loved it!

These were fun and convenient to make, but a little bland.  Next time, I will put a thin layer of the tomato sauce on top of the cheese mixture before rolling-up.

Personally, I thought this was alright, but I ended up making it for my entire family and they all thought it was just fantastic (short of my husband). I thought that it would have been better with alfredo sauce, but I was surprised at how good it turned out with the spaghetti sauce. Although this is a vegetarian recipe, I think maybe enough ground beef to counter-act the strong broccoli flavor would be great, as well. Overall, it was good enough to make again.

Did not like this one at all. The green onions were way too much flavor for me, and I only used half the amount. Might be better just leaving them out all together. I think I'll stick you a more meaty lasagna.

Incredible recipe! I used it as a guide and kinda ran with it.  I did a few things different, try my variation if you're a meat lover! -Instead of the broccoli, I subbed in a pound of ground beef. I put 3/4 of it in the cheese mixture and the rest in the sauce. -I took out the nutmeg, and also added 1 tsp of oregano, 1 tsp of parsley, and 1 tsp of minced garlic. -I sprinkled about a tablespoon of romano cheese on top of the noodle after I spread the cheese mixture on it.  The only thing I didn't like about the recipe is there was only enough cheese mixture for 8 noodles for me, not 10 like it was supposed to make. Perhaps it's because I didn't use the broccoli? Either way, my family ate this like they haven't eaten in days. All of it was gone within 20 minutes!

A little bland, not quite enough flavor for us.  I liked all the veggies but next time will definitely use some garlic and some italian seasonings.  Other than that it was good.

These were good.  Not as cheesy as lasagna but good.  I used fat free ricotta and light  mozzarella cheese.  In half I chopped up some Italian meatballs and added that.  I did spread the mix to thin and ended up with about 15 spirals instead of 10.  I had fun with the presentation of this dish.

These were pretty good but I think I prefer the real deal.  They took a good bit of effort and were nice for something a bit different.

Subbed cottage cheese for ricotta and added some seasonings.  Cooked it covered with a pile of meatballs in the corner for the meat eaters.  There is some nuisance value to rolling it up, but overall a very good recipe.  My whole family loved it.  Thank you.

Really good recipe. I didn't have nutmeg so I added some tarragon and some red pepper flakes. Really amazing recipe. Great taste and no meat. I think I really like the idea of spiraling the noodles rather than layering it seems easier to accomplish.   It's just us 2 so I tried to bake half now in a 10x10 pan and freeze the other half, but kind of flubbed on halving the recipe. (FYI 6 spirals fit nicely into a 10x10 dish) So we have 2 normal spirals, and 2 kinda of.. meh spirals to cook up in a few nights. I think after a couple of tries we will get the hang of it.  Random tip of the day: I read my chicken scratch wrong in the store and read 13 oz jar spaghetti sauce, when (after further review) had written 1 32 oz jar... long story short 14 oz jars are perfect to use when making a batch to bake half now, and freeze half for later without fear of the sauce going bad. :)

These were good!  We did, however, make a few changes.  We used a 16oz package of broccoli, and istead of ricotta cheese, we used cottage cheese.  Also, we were able to make 12 spirals which baked for a little over 40 minutes.  DO NOT USE 2 TEASPOONS OF NUTMEG, we used 1/2 teaspoon and you could still taste it just fine.  Don't forget... a little extra cheese is never bad!

Excellent and very easy to make. I don't use the broccoli or nutmeg, but it comes out great. Make all the time and recently made for a party - completely disappeared, and the guests raved!

This was SO tasty! I used spinach instead of broccoli, because that's what I like, and no nutmeg based on others' reviews. Also, I added some morningstar veggie sausage cut into pieces (I think I used about 6 sausages). My fiance (who hates to cook) had way too much fun rolling these up.

This was very good. The first time I used about 1/2 t of nutmeg, 1 t of basil, & added 1 t parsley, & left out the green onions. I also added about 1/4 c romano to the filling and some salt and pepper. The 2nd time, I omitted broccoi & used 10 oz. of chopped spinach and about 3/4 lb. of browned hot italian sausage crumbled. My son said it was too much spinach so I would probably used 1/2 pkg next time.

This recipe was great! Very filling and there were no burnt edges like there sometimes are when baking a normal lasagna! 
I left out the nutmeg because of what previous reviewers said, and I used 10 oz broccoli and 10 oz frozen spinach. I loved it with the spinach! Next time I think I might use only spinach in this! Great recipe!!!

This recipe is BRILLIANT and so satisfying. Couldn't be easier to make -- I made it on a weeknight after work and still caught the end of the evening news. I followed the recipe exactly except we used spinach and artichokes instead of broccoli. I didn't miss the meat at all and love the portion control you get from the spiral approach. None of the issues of layers of lasagne falling apart as you serve it. By the way, YES, you need the nutmeg!  I was skeptical but it "finished" the flavors nicely. The best part -- this is a very approachable dish for all sorts of eaters.  My vegetarian daughter and my picky son were both impressed.  Thank you, Susan, for sharing!

Very enjoyable meal!  I assembled mine this morning before heading off to work.  Once home at the end of the day I did increase the baking time to one hour (due to the fact that it was going straight from the fridge to the oven).  Just the right amount of baking time, it came out hot and delicious.   I will definately be making this again soon and I highly recommend it!

I thought this was much easier to make than traditional lasagna and looked better.  I made a couple of modifications: I used spinach instead of brocolli (I only used 5 oz of spinach and thought it was enough).  I also didn't use the nutmeg, instead I used italian seasoning and garlic salt.  This made 6 spirals for me, maybe I didn't put a full 1/2 cup in each but I thought there was enough stuffing in them.  Will definitely make these again in a bigger batch so I can freeze some as well.

Sorry, couldn't be more bland.  Another reviewer suggested adding other veggies, I would concur.  But for the work involved over flat veggie lasagna, I don't think the spiral look is worth the effort. Maybe for a buffet, but honestly I'm just grabbing at straws. Of all the recipes I have tried from this site, this one truly was disappointing

These were really good! I used frozen spinach instead of broccoli and it turned out GREAT! I didn't like the rosemary in my Italian Seasoning blend, so I may try to find another to use next time, but the recipe was awesome! A good switch from regular lasagna.

This is a new favorite of the whole family.  I doubled the recipe and took it to a family potluck reunion.  Everyone loved it including the kids.

The broccoli is wonderful.  I've also made it with thawed frozen spinach (squeeze the water out before adding to the other ingredients) That was excellent also.
I did add some minced garlic.

Fabulous! I scaled it down to two servings, since it was just me eating this. It smelled delightful cooking, and although I was skeptical about the broccoli, the taste was amazing. I wish I had made this sooner, it is just wonderful. I plan on making this again real soon, thank you!

The concept of this recipe is what really drew me to it. I liked the mix of the nutmeg and basil. However, it was WAY TOO MUCH broccoli. My husband and I both like broccoli, but felt it was too much. Next time I think I'll use 1/2 the broccoli and use a little browned meat instead to keep the spirals thick and tasty.

The only two mods I make on a regular basis is that I use frozen spinach (thawed & drained) instead of broccoli and I leave out the scallions. Other than that, this recipe is a keeper in my family.

I found this to be quite bland even after I added some spices and put some sauce inside the spirals. But it was ok and if I add more spices I could see making this regularly.

Definitely a keeper.  I love that I can take the base recipe and then add to it - subbing different veggies or meat, that sort of thing.  This was so much easier to make than regular lasagna, and much easier to serve as well.

My husband & I really liked the dish..but I did make some changes..I fried less than 1/2 lb of hamburger seasoned with garlic powder, black pepper and "instant gourmet seasoning" from Fresh Market, then added a can of fire roasted diced tomatoes. I skipped the nutmeg completely. After I had the rolls in my baking dish, I topped them with the meat mixture then topped it with a spicy tomato basil pasta sauceand I added extra mozz. cheese just before pulling it out of the oven.

I had a few lasagna noodles left in my cupboard but not enough to make a whole recipe for lasagna so I thought this recipe was a great idea!!  I didn't have any ricotta on hand so I used cream cheese instead.  I didn't bother to measure any of the ingredients since I was just making this recipe for myself.  I also added in some grated carrot, added mozzarella on top and a bit of sauce to the filling, and removed the nutmeg since I thought I had changed the recipe enough.  Anyway, I thought this recipe was a great idea and it tasted great too!! I gave it 4 stars just because something has to be utterly amazing for me to give it 5.  Anyway, I would definitely recommend trying out this recipe with a nice salad on the side. Excellent!

This is a very good recipe.  Only I used about 2 cups of fresh broccoli florets, 1/8 tsp of cinnamon instead of nutmeg and 24 oz of roasted garlic pasta sauce.  Other than that it was phenomenal!!!

This was a huge hit with my family.  My husband is a very picky eatter and he could not say enough how much he loved this.  I omitted the paprika.    We will be making this again.  I would like to try this with other vegetables.

I made this for my boyfriend because we are trying to eat less meat, but it was admittedly lacking some flavor.  We used italian seasoning, but it needed something.  Next time I think we will put sauce in the spirals instead of just on top.

I thought this recipe was only so-so.  Made it as printed except used 2 tsp italian seasoning (hubby not crazy about basil).  Thought the kids would like it because they both love broccoli.  I was wrong, they didn't like it at all.  I do like the idea of the spirals and I think I will try it again with just the cheese mixture and top with spaghetti/meat sauce, and put extra mozz cheese on top. Or else try a manicotti mixture to roll up in the noodles, would be much easier than stuffing the manicotti noodles.

Wonderful idea! The rolled up noodles made it far less messy to serve. The second time I made it I omitted the nutmeg. The taste did not belong.

I substituted spinach for the broccoli and added grated cooked carrots as well.

A great way to sneak in some vegetables.

way better when you use alfredo sauce instead of the spagetti. I thought alfredo sauce would taste good on this recipe so I looked for a recipe on here and came up with "famous restaurant alfredo sauce". I made two recipes. One with spag. sauce and one with the alfredo. The alfredo one was outstanding, it did taste like it came from a restaurant!!  I would use 1/2 cup cream cheese instead of the 3/4 cup. Very rich sauce but so excellent. The whole dish was eaten and hardly any of the spag. sauce one. Didn't compare. Make sure you constantly stir cream cheese when cooking or will get lumpy, or put in processor first, cream chees takes long to melt. I used fat free half and half instead of reg. also i put fresh garlic on top of my own plate. SOOOOOO sooooo  excellent. Husband couldn't believe it. Also I didn't make the roll-ups. The noodles were all broken when i opened the box so i just made it like it was a lasagna, layering the sauce, broken pieces of noodles,broccoli and riccota, ending with noodles and sauce. good luck must try

I have to give this four stars because my hubby really liked it, but I really didn't. I'm going to make a few changes and give it another chance. First of all, I would like to have the broccoli cooked a little more (personal preference). I substituted cottage cheese for the ricotta since I don't really like ricotta and it didn't seem to have much flavor. My biggest problem was that I set the spirals on their side in the pan, rather than seam down (duh). So, the sauce didn't cover them very well. But, the hubby like them, and that's all that matters - right? :-)

I'm giving it a three because only one ingredient needs to be altered, it's the nutmeg.  Substituting garlic next time because it is an italian recipe.  In this recipe's defense my husband loves them.  They are super easy to make and assemble.  Will make again.

This was great and it was easy!!!  Big factor for me.  Used spinach vs. broccoli as I always think of nutmeg with spinach.  Added some garlic salt and forgot the green onions as I was talking on the phone while cooking. I would use this filling and variations of it in other dishes as well.  Use a good pasta sauce with a lot of basil,onion, garlic, and rich tomato flavor.  More exotic will take away from the spinach cheese and nutmeg.

Not only were these a pain to put together, but they didn't really have that great of a taste either. I won't be making these again. I would rather just stick with a regular lasagna. ((No one would eat this so it wasa waste of time and money! Sorry))

I thought this was very good..I used (1) 10 ounce box frozen chopped spinach (thawed and drained) vice the brocolli...I cooked ground beef with some fresh garlic and added to the sauce and topped with more mozerella cheese last 10 mins of baking....I seen on 1 review they said they omitted the paprika, it was not even listed in recipe....

Very yummy! Even my two year old loved it! I added some fresh garlic, a little bit of rosemary, and some italian seasoning. The first time I made it, it was a tad bit bland. So I just tweaked the recipe a bit to my family's liking. We love flavor and good seasoning!

This was fun & pretty easy to make compared to traditional lasagna. I really was attracted to the spiral idea. I used spinach & mushrooms instead of broccoli and added a bit of pepper to the cheese mix for a little zing. Husband loved it! Enough for leftovers and going to try and freeze some for a quick meal in the future.

Delicious, healthy, and so simple! This was a great dish and everyone loved it. I forgot to buy green onions so I used about 1/2-1 tbs of crushed red pepper flakes, which still gave it a nice "kick".

I cut the recipe in half and it was just enough for me and my husband so in my opinion the servings are a tad off.
This was a nice change of pace from manicotti or stuffed shells. I think I'd prefer it with spinach, but it's a nice way to sneak some broccoli in though.
I would definitely choose to make stuffed shells over this reicpe, but like I said, it is a creative change of pace.

Very good but the green onions were a little too strong and dominated the flavor.  Next time we will use yellow or Vidalia onions so the onion flavor is more of an accent than the main ingredient.

This recipe was delicious. I left the vegetables out of the cheese mixture so that my husband would eat it! Next time I will try the recipe "as is", but it also worked with just the ricotta / mozzarella cheeses on the inside.

This recipe was a hit at my house! Two picky eaters gave it "thumbs up", dropped off some leftovers with my parents and my mom called today to ask for the recipe. A delicious take on regular lasagna, thanks for sharing.

This dish was easy and super delicious! I cut the amount of nutmeg way back, because 2 teaspoons seemed excessive, and added 2 big cloves of crushed garlic to the filling and it was so YUMMY! I never have luck with making lasagna (I always run out of the layers at different times) so this might just be MY lasagna recipe from now on!

I really enjoyed these.  Based on previous reviews, I only added a dash of nutmeg and I couldn't even taste it.  I also subbed 16 oz of chopped frozen spinach (thawed and drained) for the broccoli.  I thought it was a little heavy on the spinach, but since I really like spinach it didn't bother me too much.  I think I will cut back, though, in the future.  Thanks for the fun recipe!

I loved the idea of this recipe. It is so easy to make and delicious. The one thing I would change is the nutmeg. I associate nutmeg with baking and the tast of it was funny in a pasta dish.

I prepared the receipe as was and both my husband and I agreed that the broccoli should have been cooked prior to adding to the cheese as not doing it made the roll crispy.

What a fabulous way to make lasagna!  My husband is not a brocoli fan, so I used spinash on my first go.  The second time I made it with beef.  I cooked lean ground meat in a medium pan, drained the fat, and added the tomato sauce.  I let that simmer while I cooked the noodles & put together the rolls.  When the roles were done, I spread the meat sauce over the top and added a bit more cheese.  The best part about this recipe is how easy it is to mind portions.  Have 3 rolls instead of a 4*4 piece of lasagna.

This turned out alright but pretty bland. I added hamburger (next time will try sausage) and used spinach instead of broccoli.  Next time will try without the nutmeg or spinach and will add some garlic seasoning.

This is the first time I have made a lasagna recipe in which I cooked the noodles, (I have been lazy, and made microwave lasagna instead.)  I found making the recipe fun, but I questioned putting in the nutmeg, but decided to follow the recipe to the "T" for the first time.  Unfortunately, I wish I had left it out.  Other than that, I did enjoy it, overall!  This won't keep me from trying it again, with a few adjustments!

I used spinach and artichokes instead of broccoli and it was very good.  I also used low fat ricotta, and I think it would've been creamier (and tasted a little better) if I'd used the real thing.  Next time I will add a little meat of some kind and some red pepper flakes to spice it up.  Good basic recipe and easy to make.

The nutmeg gave it a different taste. I think I would make the recipe  again but leave out the nutmeg.

I normally HATE making lasagna because my ingredients run out at different times with the layering technique, but this worked out so great!  Super easy.  The spirals made excellent portions too.
I substituted spinach for the broccoli.  My (meat lover)husband and I agree that this is a keeper
