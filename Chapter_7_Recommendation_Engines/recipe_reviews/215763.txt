Easy to make, I can't personally comment on the taste as I am not a fan of mincemeat although it was loved by my men.  I used Robinson's mincemeat that I purchased from Worldmarket and shredded the apples rather than chopped.  Looked and smelt like the typical christmas pies we had back at home.

The men in my family really loved this pie, I served it warm with vanilla ice cream. Next time I will use a cooking apple rather then the Fugi I had on hand. I added about one tablespoon of flour to thicken the apple mixture after cooking it.

We liked this pie a lot. The apple cuts down on the intensity of the mincemeat.
