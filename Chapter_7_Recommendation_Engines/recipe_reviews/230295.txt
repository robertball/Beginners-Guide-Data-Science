Use only unsalted butter or margarine - not using the right butter could add a more salty taste to your dough. Also use salt with a fine grain, not any sea salt or anything that wouldn't blend in well. Mine have never tasted salty before. But unless you tweak the recipe, be sure to note these are a bit more airy and less sweet than today's normal sugar cookies. Some people won't like these, but hey - there's people out there who don't like chocolate, either.

Use only unsalted butter or margarine - that could add a salty taste to your cookies if you go for the smaller amount of sugar. Also, use salt with a fine grain, not sea salt or anything larger that won't blend in the dough. Mine have never tasted salty before, so I'm not sure how that taste would happen. But unless you tweak the recipe, these aren't overly sweet cookies like other basic recipes.

Really good recipe, easy to follow, but I suggest leaving out the extra salt! I made my own self rising flour.

I followed the directions and they taste salty.  I kept thinking I did something wrong, but I know I didn't.  I truly do not prefer sweet sugar cookies, I prefer tea cakes over sugary cookies.  The only reason I gave 2 stars is because they baked pretty. I am sorry for a bad review, but I don't want someone else to make these not knowing to add more sugar.  If you make these, add the 2 cups of sugar as in the author's suggestions.

Made it with just the one cup sugar and frosted with buttercream.  The cookies aren't too sweet for lots of frosting.  Whole family loved them for our cookie-decorating party, and they even kept well for at least a couple days. **I do agree that as written they seem too salty.** I didn't take off a star, in case the author has a less-salty self-rising flour (I used a recipe), but both times I made them, we wished I had used significantly less salt. Even the second time, when I doubled the sugar as in the author note.

Easiest and yummy recipe for sugar cookies.  Made them several times and hubby loves them! It you like them sweet, I suggest adding more sugar, but I have been following the recipe and decorating with icing on top, so the sweetness perfect! This is one of my go to cookie recipes.

This recipe needs to be revised. Do not use regular butter, and only use unsalted. If you do not, you just created salt lick for goats. I had to toss out every cookie I made.

These are excellent sugar cookies and are my favorite, but I suggest you leave out all the salt. Salted butter is alright, but unsalted is better. I also like adding a little extra sugar!
