These were great! I used all whole wheat flour. They were surprisingly sweet enough. I had enough to make a dozen muffins. If you are on Weight Watchers, making them this way gives 2 points a muffin.

Definitely needs some adjusting. I doubled the milk and added an egg and 1/2 C. sugar. Then put in tons of FRESH blueberries, strawberries, and canned peaches. They were truly great. Made a dozen.

These were really good.  I used 2 cups of wheat flour and it came out great.

I may have done something wrong, but this recipe did not seem to have near enough liquid.  I ended up adding more milk and an egg!  The finished product had a very nice taste, with plenty of natural sweetness.  I wanted a whole grain recipe for my toddler that contained fruit and no added sugar.

This recipe was great with the following changes:
I increased the applesauce to 1 Cup after reading others reviews and used a full cup of frozen blueberries.  I always mix the blueberries with the dry ingredients first so they do not clump together and then add the liquid ingredients. The batter is thick so make sure to mix well before putting in muffin cups. The result was 12 delicious, healthy and moist muffins. Thanks for the recipe!

I made a few alterations, but after the alterations, these were THE BEST eggless muffins I've made and among the best muffins of any kind.  Instead of applesauce, I used mashed banana.  I also added 1/4 cup rice syrup and only 2 Tbsp milk, though I think it would be OK without the syrup. You could also use honey.  I used frozen blueberries.  I'm so happy to have finally found a good eggless muffin that doesn't use egg replacer.

I liked the idea of using applesause & wheat flour.  I tried the original recipe as is, and it was WAY to dry.  I ended up adding an egg, some more milk, and some sugar.  They turned out very nice with the modification.  I will not make this again.  In search of another good healthy blueberry muffin receipe

Blah, very bland muffins. I like breakfast muffins with little sugar but these had little taste. I had to add 1/4 cup of milk and 1/4 cup of applesauce, otherwise it was too stiff. I even threw in 1/8 cup of sugar just to sweeten it up a tad. I used frozen mixed berries instead of dried blueberries. I would use this recipe again as a base but would add cinnamon or something to add SOME flavor to it.

For the sake of the recipe, I made it the way it is entered.  Not good.  They are dry; more like an unsweetened scone or whole wheat biscut.

Very disappointed in this recipe. I kept wondering what I did wrong when I  looked at the batter before I baked them.  I made them with my daughter and she was very excited to bake them and believed that they would be fine. After carefully rereading, and making sure we had included everything, I add more milk to give it some additional moisture. After baking them, I thought they were not very good. Other family members ate them and said that although not the best, they were okay.  Blueberries are blueberries.  I won't every make these again, but at least I didn't have to throw them away.  They don't have enough liquid to start with but I don't know what else I would do to make them more eatable.

I tried these muffins and no offense, the only tasty thing about them were the blueberries and the weren't dried blueberries. I will never make them again! What a waste of ingredients!

Great basic muffin recipe that needed a little something. I, too, found this recipe dry. I added a 1/2 c honey 1/2 more applesauce and cinnamon for flavor. I also added about a cup of frozen blueberries. All that, and not over baking made them delicious and moist! Not sure they would have turned out and I know they wouldn't have been sweet enough for my buds. :O)

I pondered this recipe for a while before I decided to make it.  I did make some changes to accomodate some of the concerns the reviewers had.  I also was a bit skeptical--no eggs?  I didn't think this was a vegan recipe, so I added an egg and 1/2 c of sugar.  I subbed craisins for the blueberries, and I think they turned out relatively well.  They aren't very sweet, even with the sugar, but I think they are relatively tasty.  Thanks.

Very good recipe. We have egg and milk allergies in my family, and this recipe easily accommodates us because it's eggless and uses oil rather than butter. I used apple juice in place of the milk. I did add about 1/2 cup sugar because my goal wasn't necessarily a really healthy muffin, but I may try to taper that down next time and see how low I can get it. I also used all fresh ground whole wheat flour because that was what I had on hand.  My kids loved these muffins. My older ones remember blueberry muffins from the days before their egg-allergic little brother was born, and they're really glad I finally found a good recipe.

I wanted to try this recipe because it was the only one I could find that used dried blueberries, and that's all I had in the house. After reading what everyone else wrote about the muffins being too dry and not sweet enough, I did add 2 TBS honey, one egg, and 1/2 c extra milk. Without the added milk, the batter was really thick, and I wasn't sure they would bake right. After the added ingredients, these muffins turned out really good.

These were not bad at all but I did make some changes as did others. I needed a muffin recipe because I was out of eggs this morning, so I was determined to make it work. :) I did double the milk, I used 1 cup of sweetened homemade applesauce, added 1/2 cup packed brown sugar, 1/2 cup of chocolate chips instead of blueberries, simply because I did not have blueberries, and 3/4 tsp. of cinnamon. I had some sliced almonds so I sprinkled the tops with those before baking. They were a wonderful muffin considering it does not have eggs and making those few adjustments.

These needed more moisture. so I added more apple sauce and more milk. A bit if sugar would be good too. I used the motts blueberry/apple-apple sauce. The sweetness comes from around the blueberries, so putting more in is not a bad idea. I WON't be making these again

This recipe needs a lot of help!! The version I made would get a 5 star rating but if I had to rate this recipe unaltered I would give it a 3. Here are the ingredients I used. 2 cups all-purpose flour, 1/4 sugar, 3 tsp baking powder, 1/2 tsp salt, 1 cup applesauce, 1/2 cup milk, 1/4 cup oil, 1 cup frozen red raspberries. I mixed the raspberries in with the dry ingredients to keep them from sticking together in the wet batter. These muffins are so moist and puffed up nicely. This recipe made 12 muffins.

These were okay.  They have a very "healthy" taste to them.  I would add more sugar next time.  I used fresh blueberries and they were the ONLY thing that gave these any type of sweetness.

A little bland, but not bad. I made it into a loaf and treating it more like a fruit bread than muffins. I'd suggest adding some sort of sugar if you want it a bit sweeter. I sprinkled a little brown sugar over the top, and it's pretty good for me.

I am not the biggest sugar fan -- but these muffins needed some sweetening.  I ended up throwing most of them out!

These are not good and they are not sweet. Maybe a half cup of honey would help.

I added a tablespoon of dried lemon zest, a 1/2 C sugar, 2 T honey, 1 T vanilla extract, and 1 t almond extract. I also used thawed frozen blueberries, and I put it in my kitchen-Aid mixer with the dough hook on speed 4, which really helped with bursting the fruit to increase moisture. I also tampered with the ration of whole wheat to regular flour, and I used Hungarian unbleached flour. I had to lengthen my bake time to 35 minutes. I decided to try this recipe because I am out of eggs right now, and I would have to say that these are a bit more crumbly than with an egg in the mix. My 7 year old taste tester and I think it could use more salt, or some butter. not bad though.

I only use whole wheat for cooking and baking and saw right off that I would alter the ingredients, especially the liquids, but thought that it made a great "base" with which to start. I didn't use any milk or sugar or eggs. Ingredients I added and/or added as substitutions were Trop 50 juice (reduced sugar kind), vanilla, cinnamon and raisins. I altered amounts of most everything and it resulted in everyone being happy with them. Moist, light (for whole wheat), tasty and without the whole wheat flavor some people don't like. 

I haven't listed the alterations since they really made it a new recipe, but as I said, it's a good whole wheat base to fiddle with if you're familiar with whole wheat and baking.
