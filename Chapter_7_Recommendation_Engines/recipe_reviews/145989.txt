This was really good. i was a little scared of the mint at first, I was not sure the flav. combo would work, but wanted to make it as written to give it a fair review. I have to say i loved the mint in the mix, it was delish. the only thing i found was that we used the metal skewers for some and because we could not find all of them, we cooked some of the strips in foil on grill. Once the salmon was cooked, it was nice and flakey and hard to remove form skewers without crumbling. next time i will just use the foil. thanks for a great recipe

Pretty good, however we didn't enjoy the mint. Next time I'll make it without the mint and use more dill.
