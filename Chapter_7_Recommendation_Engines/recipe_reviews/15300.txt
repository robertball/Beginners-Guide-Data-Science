This is a delicious, crisp, buttery, chocolately cookie!  I used salted butter because that is what I had.  I didn't have any nuts, so I didn't use them either.  Despite these changes the cookies were still wonderful! The cookies looked raw after baking them 25 minutes, but I took them out anyway and put them on the cooling rack.  After about 15 minutes, they were crisp and still warm. My husband brought some to his friends at work and they loved them! I plan on doubling the recipe next time :)

Wow!! But, I made some changes, added 1 tsp vanilla, and used 1/2 white and 1/2 brown sugar, doubling the recipe. Also, I used chopped pecans and crushed Heathbar....and Oh my God. I cannot wait to serve them up on Thanksgiving, hubby and I tasted, and they are buttery, scrumptious little bite of heaven!

This cookie is a delicious, decadent treat.  Besides being a cookie that freezes well, it mails well too!  Because I frequently makes "care packages" to send to friends who are all over the world, finding a mailable cookie recipe is a definite plus!  I will make these cookies often.

Oh, my goodness. Where have these cookies been all my life? So light, buttery and flaky like shortbread should be, and then there are the chocolate chips! Heaven. One thing I can say is that, with the butter and sugar I beat it very, very well to make sure I got a nice, fluffy cookie. A lot of choc chip cookie recipes will say to cream the butter and sugar but I beat the butter and sugar together within an inch of it's life. I also used salted butter and it was fine. I gave mine 15 minutes in the oven. The cookies are going to look like they aren't done when they first come out of the oven--they're fine! Just let them sit for a few minutes. Enjoy!

Wonderful recipe!  These were so delicious, just what I was looking for for my holiday baking. Thanks for sharing this great recipe Tina.  I am going to share it with my friends who love shortbread cookies as well! I do want to add, I have a problem with others who critize the recipe saying they don't taste like chocolate chip cookies.  These are shortbread cookies with chocolate chips.  They won't taste like your typical chocolate chip cookie, they will taste like a shortbread cookie with a bite of chocolate chip and walnut.  A suggestion for those whose cookies turned out to have butter running out of them when baking, softened butter and not melted butter should be used when baking cookies, that may have been the problem.

These cookies are great shortbread cookies!  They taste even better then the chocolate chip shortbread cookies I have bought at the store.  I don't like nuts so I left those out.  These are NOT regular chocolate chip cookies.  They are shortbread, which means they will taste different.  Some of the other reviews said there was something missing.  There is only something missing if you don't like shortbread.  These are perfect and I will definitely be making them again.  So easy too!

AWESOME COOKIES
I did try a few changes by going 1/4 cup white sugar and 1/4 cup icing sugar instead of 1/2 white.I also cut back the choco chips to 1/2 cup and added 1/4 cup choco sprinkle. Both variations were excellent. Make sure you keep to the 300 degrees F and just keep checking them until they are golden. Would recommend to anyone.

These are really great shortbread cookies. I have made them at least 3 times. This year, I am adding them to the Christmas cookie tray. I leave out the nuts and use mini chocolate chips. It yields 34 cookies with a standard cookie scoop. At that size they take the full 20 minutes exactly. It is an easy yet tasty cookie. Thank you, Tina.

This has quickly become a family favorite! I just made them for a second time yesterday, and these are the changes I made that helped them turn out perfect! 1) Upped the oven eat to 350F. 2) Reduced butter to 3/4 cup. 3) 1/4 cup brown sugar, 1/4 cup white sugar. 4) Reduced to 1/2 cup chocolate chips. 5) Added 1 tsp vanilla 5) Baked for 20 min, cooled for 15 min. Remember to flatten the cookies before baking them. When they first come out of the oven, they taste cakey and bland. So wait for them to harden! Believe me, they taste a whole world better. So buttery and crisp and salty/sweet -- delicious with milk or coffee! And not too sweet like regular soft chocolate chip cookies. Remember to flatten them before they go in the oven -- they only expand a little. They are big, neat, scone-looking cookies. This yielded exactly 12 medium-sized cookies for me.

These are really great, especially for my little guy with dairy allergies.  I just made sure I bought vegan chocolate chips and was so happy.   These stayed tender and were greedily eaten by the entire family.  I subbed Nucaco margarine for the butter and it's works just great.

So good! I used mini semi-sweet chips instead of the larger ones, and ground walnuts. They are excellent! These aren't like toll-house choc chip cookies... but I think the shortbread "element" makes them amazing. I have looked at this recipe for quite some time, and I am so glad I finally made them!

Fabulous melt in your mouth cookies.  I suggest using mini chocolate chips and finely chopped pecans.  I baked these at 275 for 60 minutes and they came out perfect.

Made these according to recipe but when I went to shape them they just kept falling apart. Did I screw up somewhere? The crumbs were AMAZING how ever! Planning on turning it into a pie crust :)

WOW is the ratio WAY OFF, I doubled the recipe and ended up with 80 tbsp size cookies, but all is good because these are very yummy, buttery and chocolaty. I followed the recipe pretty close, I didn't have any chocolate chips so I just used chopped up Easter bunny and it was nice. Next time I think I'll add a tsp of vanilla or almond extract to add just a little more flavor but other then that very good and will make again.

Used mini semisweet chocolate chips and otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  I made the cookies very small since it was for a potluck and that was the perfect size because the cookies are rich.  They melt in your mouth and are great to serve with coffee or tea.  I would not recommend using margarine with this recipe because butter is essential for the texture and delicate taste of these cookies.  I will definitely make this recipe again.

These are shortbread cookies, folks. If you want a classic chocolate chip cookie, then find a chocolate chip cookie recipe. These are really tasty! I added a bit of vanilla and baked them at 350. Also, I stuck a few chocolate chips on top instead of mixing them into the dough. Very very good shortbread cookie!!!

These cookies are realy good, I divided the dough and added almond extract to one half and left the other half as is.  They both taste just as good.  The ones without the extract might be a little drier but not terribly.  I will definitely make these again.

i gave these 4 stars and considered if i should even rate them since i messed the step up trying to do thi all in one bowl. ended up with the baking powder in with the butter then i added the flour then it was too dry so i added an egg and then the chocolate chips. the end result was nice. i made these late one night as a snack and they did just the trick. they didnt flatten out like i see in the photos but im so sure thats my fault.totally easy recipe even if you read it wrong.

Oh Good Lord these are good!! I"ll eat as many cookies as I can crank out, so I halfed the recipe and only made one dozen. Followed the recipe exactly except I took another reviewer's advice and added a teaspoon of vanilla and realized after baking that I had accidentally forgot to put in the chocolate chips, but I'm not missing it at all! Good recipe for a beginning baker with minimal ingredients and a huge payoff! Happy Baking!

Delicious and easy to make.  I made these for a fund raising bake sale and they were the first to sell out.

These are so yummy! Catch them right before they begin browning and let them cool before eating. I could eat the whole batch they are that good. Of course I love shortbread too!

I wanted to make some chocolate chip cookies, but didn't have any brown sugar and then I found this recipe! These are some amazing little cookies! I used salted butter and they tasted great still, but I next time I'm actually going to leave out the chocolate chips. These cookies are so much like shortbread and so buttery that the chocolate chips took away from that for me. However, these chocolate dipped instead would be amazing.

Family loved this.  I also made these using  brown sugar for half of the sugar and I added vanilla-about 1 tsp. and I flatten the cookies with a glass bottom that was sprayed with Pam and dipped in sugar. Also tried sliced almonds instead walnuts.  The recipe is excellent with the changes or as originally written.  I did  bake them at 325 for 17 minutes or you will be in the kitchen all day.

As a long time shortbread lover and a first time shortbread baker, I have to tell you this recipe is great!  I doubled the recipe and I'm glad I did.
I didn't think they were turning out very well because they took so long to bake and were not browning at all. I turned up the heat to 350 degrees F and cooked 25 minutes.
I am a purist, I made these plain without the chocolate chips and just sifted powdered sugar over the top after they were cool.
I took these to a Christmas get together with friends and they were a hit!
Thank you very much for the recipe.

Well, I just made a very delicious mistake.  As all of the previous chocolate chip cookies I've made have had 2 cups of choc chips in them, I added 2 cups to this recipe.  Wow - it's like a chocolate explosion!  Will definately make again, with the mistake.

My god. These cookies are a revelation to me. These are the very first cookies that I've made from scratch that were easy and came out perfectly.  I'm really not much of a baker, but I just got a convection oven in my apartment and wanted to try it out.  For those interested, the best temp and time I've found for the convection setting was 275 for 13 minutes.  Do yourself a favor and make these delicious little cookies!

Wonderful flavor and very flaky.  It needed to cool down just a little before moving them onto a wired rack, otherwise they break in a process of scooping up with a spatula.

These cookies were VERY buttery.  If that's what you are looking for, then you will really like them.  Also, they do not spread at all, so make sure to flatten them out a bit.

I can't say this is the best, it was good but not great.. When I first baked it the bottom was burnt and the middle wasn't cooked properly. I added more butter the second time, used 1/4 cup icing sugar, 1/4 cup white sugar and changed it to 120 degrees Celsius to bake for around 20 minutes.

Good recipe. I added 3/4 tsp of vanilla. I think I may try it with less or no chocolate chips, next time.

These were great even after I mis-read the recipe! I used baking soda instead of baking powder and they turned out great too. I also used a little more flour and less butter because I find them too oily.

Great little shortbread cookie. I added some vanilla and chocolate candies instead of chocolate chips. I also used pecans. Everyone loved them.

I used to eat a cookie just like this all the time at BYU (except they use M&Ms). It was my absolute favorite cookie, and I ate WAY too many of them. I looked for that recipe EVERYWHERE for a long time and then finally gave up. Something looked familiar about this recipe, so I tried it, and it's the BYU cookie! I'm so excited! I'm gonna get so fat! Oh, and I followed the recipe exactly, except no nuts and milk chocolate instead of semi-sweet. Semi-sweet wouldn't taste as good, in my opinion. This cookie needs the sweet chocolate. My oven is really accurate, and it took 20 minutes every time and they got done but not brown at all (which is good). I made sure I whipped the butter and sugar for a long time to get it really fluffy. That's important. I'm trying this with M&Ms next! Thank you for this recipe!!!!

This is a great base recipe for a shortbread/butter cookie. In my quest for the perfect chocolate chip cookie, I put my own take on it and have come up with an AWESOME cookie (at least I think so).  I added 2 t. of vanilla and an egg yolk to the butter mixture.  I used 4 T. of brown sugar and 6 T. of white sugar (so 2 T. more sugar than original recipe).  They were sooo good that I made them again--and added 1/4 C. of toffee bits--OVER THE TOP!!

Thanks for sharing this quick, easy, & yummy recipe Tina! My cookies turned out pretty good for my first attempt, but were a little too crumbly for handling.  They did have a great taste and went really well "ala mode" :) I baked for 18 minutes and made half as recipe recommended and the other half rolled in granulated sugar before baking, which gave a nice crunchy sugar coating.

These are very nice cookies. Very crisp, light and buttery. There was something missing, but I can't quite pinpoint what it is. I have a major sweet tooth, so it could be that I would prefer them a little sweeter. I didn't add the nuts, instead added a full 1 cup chocolate chips. I also added 1/2 tsp. vanilla.

Just tried these tonight and they were delicious!  Did add 1/2 tsp almond and 1/2 tsp vanilla and added pecans instead of almonds.  Despite my changes the dough was yummy and lends itself to creativity!  Will make lots more for the holidays.

These are so  simple and quick to make - my 3 year old loved helping. The entire batch was gone the same day! Used salted butter, because that is what I had on hand and omitted the nuts - absolutely delicious!! Making a double batch now!

I've been making this recipe for years, it's absolutely delicious! The only changes I make are use mini chocolate chips as regular size are too big in relation to the size of the cookie. I also sometimes add half chocolate chips and half score toffee bites which make these even better!

These are shortbread cookies, not sweet & gooey chocolate chip cookies! That said, we LOVE them! I used whole-wheat flour (skipped the sifting), smart balance 50/50 butter blend, and natural sugar. Added some extra chocolate chips to make up for the walnuts that I omitted. The cookies take about 22 minutes in my oven. YUM! EASY!

The best way to explain this cookie is like the cookies that you can buy at the store called "Sandies"(Keebler). This is exactly what this cookie is, minus the Pecans.. although that would probably make a great addition. I only did 3/4 of butter and 1/4 white sugar & 1/4 Brown sugar (took that idea from someone else) I think it made it taste waaaay better and ADD VANILLIA it makes a HUGE difference, I made 2 batches one with and one with out. Someone else said this is not a traditional chocolate-ship cookie, its not its very different. But it is good and helped my craving of choco-chip cookies. (I made it because I didnt have any baking 'soda' and wanted choco-chip cookies)

OH MY! If you love butter, this is the one for you. I read the other reviews and went ahead and split the sugar between the white and brown and added a dash of vanilla and these could not be more perfect. Completely different from the traditional chocolate chip cookie, but still just as heart warming.

I have been making these for quite some time and people just go crazy for them. There is a slight disagreement amongst my friends and family as to whether they are best pulled out of the oven before the edges brown or whether they are tastier a little more "well done" so I split the batch into two and do half "over", half "under" to satisfy everyone!

Save your hand held mixer from certain death and use your kitchenaid for his one. This is a very thick dough! I followed the recipe exactly and found myself double checking that I didn't miss something. They were not sweet enough and were extremly flaky- almost to a fault. They DID look exactly like the picture though. Just "ok".

Although the cookies baked with a great texture.  Almost no one who tried my cookies liked them.  I baked them for two different school events.  With so many people disliking them and comments like "Are you sure you didn't miss an ingredient?" I will never bake these cookies again.  I didn't include nuts in mine so that might make difference.

I have used this recipe for three years. You can't mess it up. I add peanut butter chips with the chocolate, those swirled chips. I think using butter is important. Never substituted margarine.
My 3 year old son and I just made a batch and will leave a few out for Santa on Christmas eve ;)

These cookies are delicious!!  The only change I made was adding pecans instead of walnuts.  I'd also recommend chilling the rolled dough on the cookie sheets before putting them in the oven.  I didn't do that and the butter in the dough got a little to soft, so the cookies spread a little more than I wanted them to.  I made another batch and refrigerated the dough for about 20 minutes before baking, and the results were much better.  I dusted them with confectioners sugar once cooled.  They are (were) excellent cookies.  Very rich.  Next time I will use mini chocolate chips instead.

I only gave this cookie four stars because I had to do a few modifications to make it good. I turned the oven up to 325 degrees, added some vanilla extract, and added some brown sugar. I also dropped these cookies on the cookie sheet a lot smaller than recommended. See my pic! I noticed the heart shaped cookie after I was taking these from the oven to cool!

Using a cookie scoop, then flattening each cookie slightly, these produce beautifully uniform cookies.  I, too, used mini chocolate chips, as well as a splash of vanilla extract, as I just thought it needed it.  I used hazelnuts in lieu of walnuts.  A bit "fancier" than chocolate chip cookies.  Afterall, it's shortbread!

This recipe is outrageously awesome!  I made the following changes to the recipe.  Instead of using walnuts I used chopped toasted hazelnuts.  I also increased the temperature on the oven to 325 degrees and baked for 18-20 minutes until lightly browned.  After the cookies cooled, I dipped half of the cookie in melted bittersweet chocolate.  Melt one package of bittersweet chocolate chips with 2 Tbsp. shortening then dip half of the cookie in the melted chocolate.  Put on wire cookie sheet or parchment paper to allow the chocolate to dry.  Yummy!!

TERRIFIC!!! I followed the recipe exactly except the walnuts. My husband ate 5 of them before the second batch was done! I put the bowl in the freezer for about 20 minutes so the dough would firm up and that did the trick. Also flattened them as the recipe said using a sugared glass bottom. Will definately be using this a LOT!

Wow, I love allrecipies! I also love this recipie. Shortbread and chocolate chips are made for each other. I used 2Tbs brown sugar and then I filled the rest of the half cup with white. I also added some vanilla and some extra chocolate chips. The cookies were done in a litte under 20 min to perfection.

This is best plain with no nuts or chocolate chips.  We all think so.    It's light and really melts in your mouth.  This one is better than the Shortbread Cookies II also from this site so try it, plain.

Just baked these. They are as amazing as most reviews say, very rich and delicate. I added a T of orange zest because I love chocolate and orange together. The only reason I gave them 4 stars instead of 5 is that I think the baking time is off. If you chill this dough (and you should as it is very soft and buttery), you need to bake at least 25 minutes @ 300. I'd even go 30 next time, as at 25 they still were very pale.

Excellent recipe.  After reading several reviews I made the recipe, the  only change I made  was  to add a little vanilla extract.  Honestly, it probably didn’t need the addition.  I beat the butter and sugar until very very fluffy, or as another reviewer put it,  “beat within an inch of its life”.
I found the dough to be a bit crumbly but it comes together nicely when you mix in the chips by hand as well as forming the balls by hand.  The warmth of your hands helps the butter meld in with the dry ingredients. 
Just as an experiment,  I left 1/3 of the dough plain, added finely chopped pecans  to 1/3,  and mini-chocolate chips the the other 1/3.  Then I baked them as directed. 
At first I thought they were awful and I planned to toss them all out. I waited until the next day and boy am I glad I did!  The flavors had a chance to blend overnight and they are incredible!  Addictive too and not overly sweet. In fact, the pecan ones remind me of the Keebler brand pecan sandies. 
It didn’t make a huge batch, maybe 2 dozen 1-1/2 cookies..  Thats probably a good thing too, as I’ve eaten all but one of them myself!  
This is a definite keeper!  Thanks for the post  ??

After making it, I didn’t think it tasted very good.  The following day, I thought it tasted much better.  I had a co-worker try it and she thought it was really good.  The next time I make it, I will try using regular chocolate chips instead of the semi-sweet ones.  Overall, it’s a good recipe.

I don't want to down rate these cookies because I feel like I did something wrong.  I did cream the sugar and butter together in my Kitchenaid and then also a the lowest setting mixed in the dry ingredients.  Took them out at 15 minutes, let them cool, but they still seemed a bit raw in the middle.  Taste a little flour like.  So we tried putting them in, ended up being 5 more minutes?  I tasted another one and I still feel they are taste a little flour like, doughy in the middle.  :/  I wonder if the butter being too soft had anything to do with it.  If anyone can tell what I did, please let me know.
Update: I said the heck with it and put them back in the oven, they finally seem right, but it took another 5 to 10 minutes and I waited till they were actually browned on the edges.

Easiest cookie that I have ever made. Not too sweet and the dark chocolate chips taste wonderful in this cookie. Thanks for this wonderful recipe. Remember to keep the cookies in the oven until they turn light brown and they are set, it might take a little longer then the recipe specified.

Wow, these are really great.  I split the dough in half and mixed half with mini chocolate chips and half with dried cranberries.  I also dipped the chocolate chip ones in chocolate and drizzled some icing on the cranberry ones.

For me 20-21 minutes did the trick.

Although the recipe was simple and easy to follow, the dough was way too dry and hard to form into balls. Once baked, the cookies did have a great taste, but were too dry and crumbly.

These cookies were really! crumbly... they did stay together if packed really tight. However, they weren't dense once you bit into them. I will stick to regular shortbread bars. This recipe is also very sweet. I won't be making these again.

I really loved this recipe.  It was easy to follow and all the reviews were helpful.  I took out the walnuts because I do Not like nuts.  Though if I were going to add a nut I think I would add in sliced almonds and the add a hint of almond extract.  I only added 2 tsps of vanilla extract and 2 more tbs of sugar.  They were soft and crispy at the same time.  Next time I'm adding in almond extract instead of vanilla.  Love.

I left out the walnuts, added a tablespoon of tangerine zest and used cut dark chocolate. Holy deliciousness. And I agree with previous reviews when they say the cookies will not look cooked through when they are done. I cooked my for 22 minutes and they turned out wonderful. Will definitely be making again.

Yummy!  I followed the recipe exactly except I only used a dash of salt, and I live at elevation and ended up cooking them for a solid 30 minutes. :)

I omitted the walnuts, added 1 tsp vanilla and used mini chocolate chips, these were a little underbaked for me, next time will try 325 degrees, my sons liked them and it was a nice change from regular chocolate chip cookies, used my #50 scoop which made 27 cookies.

This was a bad recipe. i think the recipe should read 1/2 cup of icing sugar instead of white sugar. My cookies spread out and were too sweet. I think this this recipe needs to be adjusted.

I made these yesterday, and they turned out great! I ended up with just over two dozen. They took about 17-20 minutes to bake to perfection:) I didn't have walnuts, so I added about half a cup of toffee bits instead, and ended up with delicious, buttery skor flavored shortbread!

Fabulous!  Omitted walnuts due to allergies but otherwise followed recipe exactly.  I was surprised my kids like shortbread because it isn't very sweet but I made 2 dozen cookies yesterday and they are almost gone.  I used mini chocolate chips and it is just enough sweetness.  Thanks for the recipe, I am sure it will be requested over and over.

One of the cookies we made for Christmas. Absolutely easy and delicious. The only changes I made was omitting the walnuts (allergies) and using mini chocolate chips instead of regular sized ones. These were the best shortbread I've ever made and require no cornstarch or icing sugar (which most stores were out of come Dec. 23rd!).

Very good! I used salted butter and mini chocolate chips. I've made this twice now, and the first time was in winter or early spring and the dough at that time was crumbly. This time it was summer, and I let the butter out a few minutes ahead of time and it was not at all crumbly. I form the dough into a log and cut it so it looks more like a shortbread cookie and not a regular chocolate chip cookie (so those eating it are ready for it to be a little drier and richer.) I sliced it pretty thin and baked it at 315 for about 20 minutes. The husband and kids love it too.

Amazing! These cookies are so easy to make but they taste like a cookie you would buy at a specialty store, decatant. I used salted butter because that's what I had on hand and used just a pinch of salt. I also used mini semi-sweet chocolate chips plus the chopped pecans. I spooned about a TBS size dough, flattened slightly and smoothed the edges. Baked at 300 for 18 minutes, just light brown around edges. Perfect crisp, buttery, melt-in-your-mouth shortbread cookie. Thanks Tinafox, these are going in my Christmas cookie box for sure!

This is a nice, light, crisp buttery cookie.  I've had this recipe saved for a long time, glad I finally got around to making make.  The cookies do have a wonderful shortbread taste to them.  The only thing I will do differently the next time is use mini chocolate chips.  The cookie is so light in texture and regular chocolate chips are heavy that the cookie sometimes broke when we took a bite.  Thanks TINAFOX for sharing your recipe.  This is a keeper and anyone who enjoys shortbread cookies should try this recipe.

It was good! Quick, easy, and satisfied my sweet-toothed family. The cookies were a bit flat because my husbnd didn't flatten it "slightly". Also used mini chips as others suggested.

Made these yesterday with my daughter so I wasn't allowed to add nuts but they were very very good.  The nuts would make them even better!  I had never had shortbread cookies with chocolate chips, but they were great. I used salted butter (because that's what I had) and added the salt, and they were a little too salty so watch the salt! A must try!

Very good.  I did add 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract per recommendations.  I omitted the nuts because my daughter can't have them.  Nice and buttery.  I would definitely suggest you leave them on the cookie sheet to cool a few minutes before transferring to a cooling rack.  Otherwise they fall apart and break.

I omitted the nuts and used a mixture of butter and butter-flavored shortening for the cookies.  The cookies hardly spread at all on the baking sheet.  My main problem with this recipe is the baking time: I left the cookies in the oven for 45 minutes and the edges still wouldn't brown.  The texture is crumbly and the cookies melt in your mouth.  This is a good recipe, but the baking time needs to be adjusted.

I followed the recipe exactly and the cookies looked great when they were done but looks could not compensate for the texture or flavorl. They were extremely dry and the blan taste of the cookie didn't complement the flavor of the chocolate chips. I would not recommend this recipe.

BEST CHOCOLATE CHIP COOKIE EVER! Just how I like them. Dense, sweet, and crumbly. I have been searching for a recipe that duplicates these huge chocolate chip cookies they use to sell in high school. I will be making these over and over again. I didn't add walnuts and I used mini chocolate chips. I drizzled white chocolate and sprinkles on top. I also used 1/4 cup each white sugar and brown sugar.

I'm really glad I found this recipe; I think it will be a great staple in my cookie repertoire. I doubled it and added 1 tsp vanilla. Very dry and crumbly batter; I gave up using a spoon and just dug in with my hands! Baked for 22 minutes, but will prob leave in oven longer next time. I also used mini-morsels bc that's what I had one hand. I am excited to try other additives, like Heath toffee bits and butterscotch chips. Great recipe!!

Whats not to love about shortbread and chocolate!  Very easy recipe and they baked up perfectly.  I added a little vanilla.  Next time I'll try the mini chips and cut them back a bit because the shortbread is soo good I don't think it needs all the chocolate.

I've tried several cookie recipes and i really iked this one, not as buttery as a real meant to be cookie... I replaced the butter with vegan butter and the white sugar with brown sugar, so that even my vegan bf could eat it. They were gorgerous, baked the whole batch and only about 3 got to cool off. Kudos to Tina.

These cookies just melt in your mouth. I left out the walnuts. I was a bit worried when making them as the mixture never came together properly. It did when I started rolling it into balls though and they really firm up in the oven. Thanks for the recipe Tina

Really nice for my shortbread craving. I used salted butter and omitted salt; used milk chocolate chips (on hand) and cooked for 22 minutes at designated temp. Will definitely use this recipe again. Maybe butterscotch chips next time!

These are my favorite cookie- minus the walnuts. I double the recipe and shape all the dough into balls, then freeze half before baking. It's great to have them on hand for when guests come. I melt some chocolate and drizzle over cookies for a fancier appearance.

The best shortbread cookie!! I've been making these for 3 years now and we love them.  This year I've made three batches - one with chocolate chips, one with white chocolate chips and another with chocolate raspberry chips - they are all DELICIOUS.  Try dusting them with powdered sugar for a different look...these will be a treat for anyone who likes shortbread cookies!

These aren't really what I expected, I am not sure what I expected, but these were fantastic!  Very rich.  Crisp.  Not like your normal chocolate chip cookie, but definetly worth trying.  And I LOVE how few ingredients it takes, very easy.  The other thing I love about this recipe is the dough is delicious, taste just like normal cookie dough, but because it doesn't have eggs in it, I can let my kids eat the dough, without worrying about raw eggs.  Fantastic

These cookies are soo good! They remind me of sandie cookies or something. They crumble a bit, just be careful when removing from pan. They are very soft and moist.

I made these last night since I'm doing a cookie exchange and have to make about 15 dozen cookies.  The recipe was very easy and the dough was easy to work with.  I made half the batch regular and the other half I added toppings to it from another recipe.  I didn't love the cookies but they were good and I'd probably make them again at another time.

Mmmm mmmm good. I made 1/2 of this batch and wish I made more! I only had margarine so I subbed 1/2 margarine 1/2 shortening. I  didn't have coconut extract so I put in 2 tablespoons shredded coconut, and I didn't have mini morsels so I used regular size. I can't wait to make these for Christmas. I know a lot of shortbread cookie lovers. So good.

I got rave reviews from my co-workers.  I made them especially for a colleague who is allergic to eggs, and he loved them!  The only problem I had with the recipe is that the dough was too dry with just the listed ingredients.  I added some milk to the dough, and it was much easier to work with.  This is probably just something that I did wrong, though.  Either way, the taste was wonderful.  Not too sweet, and very soft and buttery.  I will definately make these again!

Super cookie, and easy to make a batch. I spread chocolate frosting on the tops after cooling, and my neighbors went crazy for them! This recipe is a true keeper - and - a one you will get requests for over and over! Give it a try...you won't be sorry!  Enjoy and enjoy....

My first time making cookies in my entire life! They came out really good. At first I was worried because the dough didn't seem hard and it was kind of .. crumbly? But I realized you have to press the dough hard so that it comes together. And when I made the cookies I didn't press down on the cookies enough so they came out fat, lol. But they're really yummy :]

A good cookie- but I prefer a true shortbread cookie without the chocolate chips.  Try a recipe with just butter, flour and sugar...like a Scottish Shortbread recipe.  They are delicious.

Oh yummy! I love shortbread cookies and I love chocolate I wasn't suprised that I like these as much as I do. I made them with salted butter, omitted the salt, and used milk chocolate chips. I baked them for exactly 15 minutes and they turned out beautifully. Thanks Tina!

I was online looking for a recipe for chocolate chip cookies without brown sugar because I didn't have any in my house. A friend turned me on to this site and I found Tina's recipe. Absolutely fabulous!!! My coworkers want the recipe too. It made my house smell like Christmas shortbread cookies. Thanks, Tina!!!!

I don't think I'll ever make ordinary chocolate chip cookies again! These LITERALLY melt in your mouth. They're amazing, and so easy to make. I only had salted margarine, which was fine, but next time I'll skip the addition of salt and increase the sugar by a bit. I doubled the recipe and dropped one batch onto parchment paper, froze, and stored them in a freezer bag to bake a few whenever I want.

I thought these cookies were really dry and crumbly.  I brought these cookies to a family party along with another type of cookie, and the other ones were all gone way before these were.  I guess I prefer plain old chocolate chip cookies to the shortbread type.

The recipe: This was super easy to put together. It was a soft dough that was easy to roll into balls. I baked on baking stones, so I added an additional 3 minutes to the 20 suggested, and it was perfect. To the recipe, I added 1 tsp real vanilla and substituted brown sugar for half the white.

The cookie: The texture was a little too soft for a shortbread. I expected a bit more tender crumble in the bite and a bit more melt-in-your-mouth in the chew. The dough seemed to be a little too soft and moist. Usually, a shortbread dough is a bit more dry. The taste was good although somewhat bland and flat. Next time, I might play with ingredient ratios, use only white sugar, and add even more vanilla to the dough. I'd like to see if pecans, instead of walnuts, might impart more richness, and perhaps the addition of toffee bits might give more depth to the flavor.

If you flatten slightly they turn out crumbly, I used a scoop and did not flatten and they came out pretty good.  Recipe only makes 3 dozen so will double next time.  Husband likes them therefore 4 instead of 3 stars for the falling apart factor.

Incredible flavor - chocolate chips & walnuts are a great addition to this recipe. However, I was unable to form actual cookies/balls. For some reason they would not hols together so I just pressed them into a 9x9 pan and they came out fine.

I baked this New Years eve , boy, was it the BEST shortbread recipe I have ever made, and sooooooo simple too.

I didn't bake traditional cookie style, as indicated in the recipe. I placed the entire dough in a round spring pan, and voila! I did add  pure almond  extract, and because I baked it pie-like, the baking time was longer. But all worth it!  Heat the finish product at 10-15 seconds, and add a scoope or 3 of vanilla ice cream.....HOLY MACKINAW....heaven in my mouth!

See picture attached. This will be my go-too shortbread recipe!

This is almost the exact 70 plus-year-old cookie recipe I have from my mother. We replaced the chocolate with as many nuts.
I love chocolate but not with this cookie, try without.                          The only diff was 1 t. of vanilla and 1 t. of water. The water helps spread the cookie.
Mix butter and sugar for at least 15 minutes.                                                                                               If you make with just the nuts, roll in powdered sugar after cooling.

So easy to make and use as a base for all kinds of cookies.  I left out the choc chips and split the dough in half.
Put choc chips in one half and rolled the other half into balls, placing both on a cookie sheet. 
Using a glass with a buttered flat bottom, I dipped the glass in a plate full of red and green sugar sprinkles and flattened the plain cookies with that. Used regular sugar for flattening the choc chip ones.
Everyone loved them!  Gone in a half hour.

Excellent.  I followed the recipe to the letter the first time and they were beyond fantastic.  The second time I substituted a scant half cup each halved maraschino cherries and halved macadamia nuts for the walnuts.  I can't say which version I liked better.

If you love shortbread cookies, you will LOVE the rich, buttery, sandy texture of this cookie! Melts in your mouth. I did half the batch with milk chocolate chips and half with Heath Milk Chocolate toffee bits and both were delicious. I added 1/2 tsp vanilla. I wanted them to be smaller tea cookies so I dropped them by the teaspoonful and this made 48 perfect little cookies.

I made these cookies today and loved them they are really good!!! I tweaked it just a little bit I used 1/4 baking soda instead of baking powder and added 1 TBS of vanilla extract and 3/4 white sugar instead of just half a cup and it came out really good my family loved them! Thank you for this awesome recipe =)

Loved it!  Used 1/2 cup peanut butter chips and 1/2 cup chocolate chips instead, also used salted butter and skipped adding the salt.  No nuts either as didn't have any.  Baked 20 mins and let sit 15 mins and they are so delicious!!!  Making these again!

This is THE BEST shortbread cookie recipe I’ve ever used! First time made with chocolate chips, just made again without. This time I used the zest of 1 lemon in with the butter and sugar before adding flour mixture. Perfect!

The Best.  I had no nuts so I just eliminated them. These taste like a trip to the bakery of your youth.....the butter cookies they mastered.....so good.

I wish I could leave 0 stars. These need something else. I’m not a good enough cook to know what exactly that is but these cookies turned out powdery and were absolutely disgusting. Please don’t trust the recipe!!

i’ve made these cookies before and they’ve turned into my favorite cookie recipe ever! they were pretty crumbly, whenever i picked them up too hard they fell into pieces, but that may have been my fault since i’ve made them before and that’s never happened. that are so buttery and sweet, and there is the perfect amount of chocolate chips, i love these cookies!

Crumbly but holds together well. Buttery but not overly greasy. Wonderful shortbread chocolate chip cookie recipe!
I made some slight adjustments to the recipe to fit what I had and what I know works for me. I doubled the recipe using salted butter instead of unsalted butter and salt (as that's what I had left in my fridge and I wanted to use it up). I softened the butter to room temperature before creaming it with the sugar. I used half white sugar and half brown sugar to give the cookies a richer taste. I also added in 1 tsp of vanilla extract.

These cookies do spread but not a whole lot, so I flattened them a bit before putting them into the oven.  I baked them at 300C for 15 minutes but I could have probably gotten away with 10-12 especially if I wanted softer cookies.

These are very simple, very tasty little cookies. I may try making them next time with powdered sugar rather than granulated, as it makes a smoother shortbread, but otherwise I really liked this recipe.
A thought to Karen.U -- was the problem too much salt? If you use salted butter these cookies WILL end up too salty! Stick with unsalted butter or change the amount of added salt accordingly.

I have made these SO many times and still LOVE them!  These have become my go-to, that's for sure.  I can taste the difference between butter and margarine, but it doesn't seem to make a difference in the bake.  I do notice more spread if I use a mixer all through the recipe, so I try to use a mixer only for the butter-sugar creaming and hand mix (this is where that wooden spoon you can't seem to get rid of comes in handy!) the rest.  I also like to let the dough rest in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour before baking.  It lets the butter set and prevents overspreading during baking--saving flake.  If you're making a double batch, go ahead and measure out the 1 1/2 cups of choc instead of using the whole bag.  This is another instance of 'less is more.'

I know these are supposed to be different from Toll House  cookies, but the texture was extremely crumbly. Tasted OK but way too fragile to put out for guests. Maybe good ice cream topping.

Made these exactly as the recipe states and they come out delicious every single time!  Only downfall is that the recipe doesn't make very many cookies and they get eaten very quickly!   I roll mine into small balls and flatten before baking.  Turn out amazing!!

Easy! I think I would just put the chocolate chips on top next time. This will let people know these are not chocolate chip cookies.  Room temp butter is the key to keep them from being too flat.

Great delicate shortbread cookie. Used half the sugar as we watch how much we take in. I added a little almond extract just because i love it. Put chocolate chips in only a few of them and some pistachios. Walnuts tasted great too.

If there were 50 stars, I would have given these cookies all 50 of them!  I will always make these now. I split the cookies with original recipe, then with only the walnuts in them. ( only a personal taste.)

These were great and super easy to make! I used one stick of salted butter and one unsalted because that's what I had on hand, so I omitted the salt. I also added some of that good Mexican vanilla. Very tasty, I think they would even stand alone well as shortbread cookies. Next time I might try with some almond extract as well.

Incredibly easy and delicious!  Made per instructions first time with added 1/2 tsp of vanilla-wonderful! 2nd batch tried the 1/4 cup brown and white sugar with 1/2 tsp almond extract- also increased oven to 350—mind blowing!  Love the recipe Tina!! This will become a staple.

This shortbread cookie is a staple on my Christmas baking list. Chocolate and shortbread are made for each other! It's always the first cookie everyone seems to reach for! Sometimes I finely add chopped walnuts or pecans to it as well.

These were so yummy!  They were so good I made them three times in one week.  I didn't use walnuts and found that using mini chips worked best.

It was really, really delicious. To all of you out there who have noticed that it is really after you put on the dry ingredients, push the butter (or margarine) over the dry ingredients. It was super buttery. Loved it otherwise. I also substituted the butter for margarine. Still tasted delicious. Thank you, Tina!! Thank you so much.

Good flavor, but they were pretty oily after baking.  Maybe I need to wait until they cool to test them :-)

I made these cookies exactly as written and they turned out perfectly.  They took about 14 minutes in my oven.  I waited until I could see just a touch of golden brown around the edges.  This is a delicious shortbread cookie with the great addition of chocolate chips.  I think using the mini chips is a must!  While you can chill the dough slightly, you can't chill it much because the high butter content would make the dough too hard to roll into balls.  And using butter is also a must! I am guessing the reviews that say their dough spread or the cookie was greasy, may have used margarine.  I found this recipe to be delicious.  A keeper for sure.

Amazing!  I doubled the batch,  split in in half and used mini chocolate chips and walnuts in one half and pecans in the other.  The only variance from the recipe was to add 1 tsp vanilla (per batch).

I liked the cookies, and they were great, super tasty. The sweetness was perfect. I did not cream the butter properly, so I had to moisten the batter with water from my kettle before adding the chips and omitting the nuts. I also added vanilla extract. I will for sure make this again and maybe be more adventurous!

Best choc chip cookie recipe ever!!

Absolutely delicious, crumbly and buttery!
 
After reading a couple of reviews that complained about the cookies being too crumbly, I made my first batch cautiously on Christmas eve with no modifications. The cookies came out very crumbly but they were still a big hit.

For the 2nd and 3rd batches, I doubled the recipe then added ONE egg, Vanilla extract, substituted 1/3 of the flour with Almond flour, and replaced the walnuts with flaked almonds.
The result was an incredible, delicate-tasting cookie! 
I believe I have just found my go-to Chocolate Chip Cookie recipe!
p.s. The taste and texture definitely do improve when made a day ahead of serving.

I liked the cookie. The texture was a little hard. It raised high and stayed up, but was missing something from a regular 
cho. chip cookie. I loved that it had volume, but even my co tasters thought it was only OK. I will try the recipe on the bag and compare tastes.

Delicious crumbly buttery shortbread cookies! Modifications: I added 1/2 tsp of vanilla extract and skipped the walnuts. Baked for 25 minutes for the first batch and 30 minutes for the second, both at 300 degrees. Used a fruit baller and yielded about 20 cookies. So yummy and easy. This was a trial run and got the final approval to be Santa’s cookies. My 4yo enjoyed helping and devoured them as well.

Made a half batch and came out great! I simply mixed by hand and was too lazy to sift dry ingredients. Used a cookie scoop for size consistency (made 14) and flatted slightly with a spoon. Baked 15 minutes and let cool a few before removing to a rack. This type of cookie should still be pale when done. It's cooked but will look raw. At 25 minutes mine were very pale with a tiny teensie bit of gold on a few edges.  Let it sit and rest before moving. Love shortbread and this is a nice option.  Will make a good base. Next time I'm thinking almonds and lemon zest instead of walnuts and chocolate!

I loved making them. Not good at following directions I sifted the sugar together with the dry ingredients and mixed everything together until smooth i took some chocolate chips, and some walnuts and mixed them in, got a funny looking cookie but decadent and delicious. I just made them again followed recipe and I now have a new favourite, thank you Tina, these are fun to make and delicious to eat

These had good flavor but are extremely delicate and break easily. I had trouble arranging them on a cookie plate because they had to be completely flat or they crumbled.  I used 1/2 walnut sized drops onto the cookie sheet (which I lined with parchment) and only got 3 dozen. I will make again. Keep leftovers on plate in fridge to help keep them firm.

Way better than some famous bakery cookies. My husband bought me some shortbread cookies that were $$$. As I ate them, I realized that I could probably make them myself. Thanks to your recipe, I did, and they were way better. I realize that your recipe can be used as a base for other types by adding other ingredients. Yummy! Thank you for sharing.

Slight tweak to these and they came out excellent.  Doubled the recipe and Instead of using 1.5 cups of chocolate chips...I added 3/4 cup of white yogurt chips and 3/4 cup of dried (dehydrated) blueberries.   Excellent for those who want a different flavored shortbread cookie.

I doubled the recipe, added vanilla and took out the walnuts.  It made 7 dozen cookies for me.  Made the mistake of putting three trays in the oven at once and bottom rack cooked all too fast.  Took them out at 12 minutes and the bottoms were a bit burnt, yet still edible LOL.  The top too racks did not brown in 20 minutes, but took them out and cooled them. They looked pretty all white (like a shortbread!) Tastes great!

Cookies are good. Although cooking them for 15 minutes burned the bottom.  The second batch I made, I only left them for 10 minutes and much better. Softer and not burnt at the bottom.

So good. Just like the Angel Cookies you love from the grocery store, but better!  Taste like butter, not shortening. Left out the nuts. And used mini choc. chips. These are small cookies so need small chips. Had to use hands to mix because dough is very short. That's why they taste so good!

I put a bit fewer chocolate chips than the recipe called for, and it was still totally awesome.

Also, I put in the salt before realizing that all the butter I had was salted, but they turned out completely fine. If you only have salted butter, you'll probably want to omit the salt, but the cookies will be fabulous even with salted butter.

Fantastic recipe! It's my new go-to!
It's great as is! Or omit the chocolate chips and add a quarter tsp of flavor extract (lemon, orange) and zest and then top with a citrus glaze (juice and powdered sugar) after they cool or make a small indent and add a drop of jam before baking. So versatile!

The flavor is delicious!  The only problem i found is that they bled a little bit around the edges. Was I supposed to chill it before baking? They also seemed to spread a little more than other shortbreads?

These are excellent; not too sweet.  And so quick & easy to make.  I omitted the nuts due to an allergy and replaced them with extra chocolate chips. I'll definitely make more for Christmas holiday.

I added a tsp of vanilla and forgot the walnuts. These were very good--my only complaint would be too many chocolate chips. I'm going to cut it down to at least 1/2 cup next time.

This is the second time I've made these.  Would give 4.5 stars, since I changed it up a bit. The first time, I made them as written. Lot's of complaints about chocolate chips.  This time, I added a tsp of vanilla and went with pecans, no chocolate.  They were a home run.  Thanks for a great shortbread recipe and baking technique.  I will use this again for shortbread cookies.

These are possibly the best cookie s I have ever had.  Loved them.  I did use salted butter, and I had half a bag of Butterfinger Baking Bits.  I added  1/2 cup of the Butterfinger Bits and 1/2 cup chopped walnuts and 1/2 cup chocolate chips to the dough. Thanks so much for such a great cookie.

Loved these!  As others have said, they are NOT a chocolate chip cookie but a shortbread cookie BUT they WERE every bit as good as my chocolate chip recipe (and that is a good thing).  I made them as directed except used pecans instead of walnuts because it is what I had on hand.  Took 22 minutes to get done in my oven.  Will definitely be making again!

Of course no nuts. Daughter highly allergic. Also it was to flaky was not forming. I added 2/3 cup of apple sauce cause daughter is allergic to eggs. We also added another 1/3 cup of chocolate chips. They are delicious and kids love it.

If you love shortbread, you will love these!  Make sure the dough is really mixed up well, or you will have a couple of awkwardly flat cookies like me.  These taste delicious and practically melt in your mouth!

These were great, even with modifications I had to make. I have no clue what people were talking about regarding either size or doneness. Maybe they aren't used to shortbread? I had to use 2/3 whole wheat flour (ran out of A.P.) plus I omitted nuts and these were great.

This is seriously one of  my go to recipes. I love short bread and I love chocolate! So combine the two and it's perfect.  Remember the dough is a bit dry, but it's supposed to be that way. The only thing I change is that I use dark chocolate chips instead of semi-sweet because I like them better. Other than that this recipe is perfect.

I found this recipe over the holidays and have made it a few times already.  This is now my favorite cookie recipe.  I  mixed in regular sized dark chocolate chips and mini chocolate chips. Used pecans because hubby prefers them.  I definitely recommend.  I followed some recommendations and used half brown and half regular sugar and 1 tsp of vanilla.  This is a keeper. Enjoy!

I made these cookies without the walnuts and think they are good, however, I think they could be promoted to a great rating with a couple simple changes.  
First, although I am not a salt fiend, I do like salt and find it essential on certain foods like: steamed veggies, popcorn, celery, and enjoy the addition of sea-salt on many items now sold today like chocolate.  If you are like me, and struggle to thoroughly enjoy something that is under-salted, then you will want to use salted butter in this recipe.
Second, I chose this recipe because I am a big fan of both shortbread AND chocolate.  I followed the recipe and only used the 3/4 cup choc-chips and found it a bit on the skimpy side.  When I bake, I want to be satisfied with each bite of whatever goody I am baking at the time, and the ratio fell short on the chocolate side.  I would recommend 1 cup of choc-chips and then fine-tuning quantity according to personal preference.
Third, I think chilling the batter for at least 30 minutes would make forming the cookies a breeze.  At room temp, it was just too sticky and not stiff enough to handle easily.  I also think that with a melon baller, one could produce the perfect size little cookie.  Mine all came out a tad large, which is exactly how I prefer my chocolate-chip cookies to be, but these babies are so rich do to high butter content, that I think a smaller size would suit them better.  And I also think visually, they would make a bigger statement as petite, two-bite cookie

This recipe is delicious, this short bread is so buttery it practically melts in your mouth. The changes I did the second time I made them was to add 1/2 tsp of vanilla, I used pecans, used golden yellow sugar, and used butterfinger baking bits instead of chocolate chips. These cookies are to die for.

These cookies reminded me of my childhood when the schools would sell them al la carte... tastes pretty close to the same. Either way they were EXCELLENT! Buttery with a spendid crunch!! My kids loved them as well and so did the many others we handed them out to For christmas! This cookie will be made year round...

I've been making this shortbread recipe for years (at least 5) and it has never failed me.  Other shortbread recipes fall flat..they are either too greasy, too dry, too dense...but this one is perfect.  I would recommend the shortest bake time (15 mins) bc the cookies will continue cooking after you take them out.  Nothing worse than a hard, overcooked, burnt shortbread!  You can make this recipe your own by adding nuts, chocolate chips (mint is a favorite) or even food coloring.  Check out my pics to see how versatile it is.  This recipe is tops!

I made these and followed the exact recipe. These cookies turned out extremely thin and crumbly. When I went to take them off of the cookie sheet, they all broke. The crumbs tasted OK but I will not make again.

Everybody I shared these cookies with had to eat more than one because they loved them so much. The only downside is they must be eaten fresh. They get hard by Day 2.

I love this recipe. It is my to go shortbread recipe. Some changes I made was using roughly chopped 60% chocolate and cranberries. I also used one tablespoon of almond extract.

I followed recipe. Beating the butter and then creaming sugar is very important here as others have mentioned. I did use softened butter. I added the almond extract,smelled so wonderful! I added the flour/baking powder/salt (whisked together before adding) in three portions. Then added the chocolate and cranberry mixture.

I chilled the dough overnight. It rolled out very well and I was able to make cute little flower shapes with them. Took 15 minutes to bake, and rested them for about 5 minutes until firm. 

Nice firm and bite size cookies. I think adding the cranberries gives it a brighter cleaner taste. I am not fond of texture of nuts unless finely ground. Will bake these again!

Perfect cookies!!!!!
Better than grandmas!!!
Will add these to the rotation, very impressed. 
I didn't have any walnuts so I added a tiny bit of almond extract, being clear it didn't taint the white color.
I also used milk chocolate chips instead and again it was bang on amazing
in future I will make a batch to roll and freeze. The slice and go would give a shape more like the cookies in the photo.

I just made these cookies for a cookie exchange. I used pecans and added craisins. I loved them. Hubby not so sure, but he doesn't like nuts in his cookies and craisins are a big no for him. I also put a light dusting of powdered sugar on top. These were very easy and I will make them again. I think they would be good with a cup of coffee or tea. Yum....

This turned out great and it was easy and quick to put together. I recommend for beginner bakers or for your first time baking shortbread. This was my first time and I wanted to make something festive for the night we decorated the Christmas tree. This took less time than my go-to cookie recipe and the results were impressive.

I started by creaming the butter and sugar well in my mixer, then adding the baking powder, salt, and sugar and mixing well again. Then I added all the flour and mixed until incorporated. Then I added the chocolate chips (I used mini) and walnuts and gave it a quick mix. I used my hands to shape the cookie dough together and to get any rogue chocolate chips or walnuts to incorporate in. Then I followed instructions to rolling walnut sized balls and pressed down with two fingers in both directions to flatten slightly. I baked for 15 minutes and let cool on cooling rack.

They turned out great- cooked perfectly, really nice shortbread taste, nice looking. Perfect for holiday baking when you want to impress but want it to come together quickly and without complication.

I made a few adjustments based on other comments.  I used 1/4 c. brown sugar and 1/4 c. white sugar.  I also added 1 tsp. vanilla extract in with the butter and sugars.  I used salted butter so I used only a pinch of salt.  I used a heaping half cup of mini chocolate chips rather than 3/4 cups.  I think these cookies are wonderful!

These are totally delish!  I didn't put in the nuts because I didn't have any, but otherwise I made it as is.  The recipe made 29 cookies, and baked for 19 minutes each.  This recipe is so simple and easy, it is awesome!  I will say, the family loved the cookie better the next day.  YUMMY!

They were amazing!!!!! I added 1/4 more white sugar and 1/4 more semi sweet chocolate chips, also I added 1 tsp of vanilla. I love the cookies, my mom likes the cookies, my dad likes my dad likes them, and so do my sisters. That means I must have done pretty good making them. The cookies are really good everyone in my family likes them. :) ;)

Family loves these cookies!  Light, buttery, flaky.  Used whole wheat flour, omitted walnuts, used salted butter, added vanilla extract.  Could easily add other ingredients

Like other, I baked these at 350F since previous batches were softer. Baked at the higher temperature, the results were more classically shortbread texture and golden brown. and added 1 tsp vanilla extract. Measured out by heaping teaspoons which gave me 2 1/2 dozen.

Hands down the best shortbread cookie recipe I have ever had.  Even my 13 yr old son said it was amazing!  I used salted butter since it was all I had on hand and it came out just fine.  I also used mini semi-sweet chocolate chips.  Thanks for the recipe!

I just tried this recipe last night and I think it's great. If a person is not familiar with shortbread cookies, they may not like this. But I felt this recipe captured the essence of goodness. The beauty about shortbread is that they are not super sweet and they are meant to be buttery and thick.  I did do some minor tweeking to this recipe though--I added a tablespoon extra of flour. Also, next time around I think I will try the 1/4 cup of confectioner's sugar and 1/4 cup of granulated.  I left out the nuts (because I didn't have any on hand) and I drizzled half of the finished product with melted chocolate. The other half I sprinkled with granulated sugar before baking. They were a hit! So thanks for sharing this recipe, Tina--It was great.

Delicious!  Did not add nuts, used small chocolate chips, and used a buttered glass bottom dipped in granulated sugar to flatten cookie dough prior to baking.  These are easy to make, yummy shortbread, and disappeared quickly.  Will maybe double the recipe next time.

Turned out flat and greasy. Maybe it's because I live in CO and should have adjusted it for high altitude. All around disappointment.

These are phenomenal!  I always make plain shortbread with coloured sugar on them for Christmas, but decided I'd add to my baking list and try these.  Excellent!  Wonderful texture!  Simple to make.  Definitely making these again!  Thank you tinafox!

These are one of the best crisp light shortbread cookies made.  I make them into a bar cookie, press them into cookie sheet and lightly roll with rolling pin to uniform thickness.  So much easier than trying to form cookies!!!

I tried this recipe because I didn't have any brown sugar to make my regular chocolate chip cookies. I was quite amazed by these although I will warn you, You Need Something To Drink! I did this exactly how it said although I added 1 tsp vanilla to the butter and sugar mixture before I added the dry mixture. I really enjoy these and I will make them again.

I successfully made these cookies two nights ago... SO amazing. They didn't last. Instead of chocolate chips I used an organic 70% dark chocolate cacao bar (i love dark chocolate) and chopped it up. I don't like things that are *too* sweet and my daughter and husband still gobbled it up. Awesome!! I think that even without the chocolate it would still make a perfect cookie!

Really good cookie recipe.  I did add a little vanilla just because I love vanilla, but I think it would be just as good without.  Really buttery and flaky.

Oh my goodness these are fantastic, this recipe is a keeper. I have a son in the Air Force & I will be sending him some soon! I doubled the recipe & they are all gone!  The changes I made came from another reviewers suggestions (thank you):  I added 1 tsp vanilla extract, instead of white sugar I used 1/2 organic evap cane sugar & 1/2 organic Sucanat, I used salted butter, I finely chopped pecans & regular sized organic chips, I also cooked the cookies in mini muffin papers

These are awesome! addictive! I followed the recipe for the most part, the only change was to use 3/4c whole wheat flour and the rest 1c was a/p flour - you'd never even know there was whole wheat flour in these!! Everything else I did exactly as the recipe says - yum!! Will make these again!!

This cookie was very good.  I liked it but my hubby and kiddos LOVED it!   I did add vanilla and 18 minutes seemed to be a good time for me.  I wanted them to get a more brown but the light brown was just right!  I didn't add nuts (didn't have any) but added a few more chocolate chips.

Very good and easy.  I took a chance and used margarine instead of butter. I didn't stir the chocolate chips in but rather let my kids "decorate" them before I put them in the oven. Very easy shortbread recipe, and I will be keeping it for the christmas season.  I am excited about trying it with different flavors, nuts, etc.

Scrumptious. These are similar in texture to Trader Joe's Way More Chocolate Chip Cookies, but MUCH, MUCH better!! The batter turned out a bit dry & crumbly--had to just form with my hands. Went so far as to wonder if I missed something, like an egg, but no eggs listed. They baked beautifully in 20 minutes but needed to cool because they are a little bit crumbly--just like a shortbread should be. This is my husband's new favorite cookie. I did add 1 teas Vanilla and that is the only improvement I'd make.

There are way, way too many chocolate chips called for in this recipe.  The cookie was good, but it was too rich.  Almost made it hard to tell if the shortbread was any good.  I would make them again once I have a good shortbread base, with far fewer chips.

A very good shortbread cookie.  The only thing I did different was to use margarine instead of butter since that's what I had on hand.  I was so scared that the margarine would ruin it, but they actually turned out well.  Just a little softer than shortbread.  Oh, and I added a bit of vanilla. Overall, the batter handled very nicely, they baked up beautifully and the flavor was delicious.  Definitely a keeper since a nice, simple cookie is sometimes a welcome break.  Thanks for sharing, Tina.

Mmm this was good. I got less than 2 doz but my cookies must be bigger...The changes I made were: used 1/2 tsp vanilla, chopped pecans instead of walnuts, no chocolate, baked at 325 for about 25 min. MMM delish! Next time maybe I'll try the chocolate or maybe orange peel or lemon. Lots of possibilities!

Great cookies! The dough is very, very crumbly when mixed, don't worry it works out fine! I smooshed it into the tablespoon I was mixing with and then slid it off as a nice oval. I chopped up some baker's chocolate for this go, but I think they would be better served by some 70 or 80% next time since they are not sweet at all with such bitter chocolate. Still delicious with some milk though!

I don't know if I did something wrong, but these came out a little too oily for my taste...maybe I will use less butter next time.

I'm giving these 4 stars because they were very easy and the taste was good, I just thought there was too much oil.  My son loved them!

mmm, these are so yummy and instead of using just plain flour I substituted 1/2 cup of almond meal sifted into the flour and used butterscotch chips with a little bit of vanilla extract, delicious!

YUMMMMM!!!!! I love these cookies! I took out the choc. chips, and the walnuts and did chopped pecans. Only b/c I'd just made some regular choc. chip walnut cookies and wanted somehting different. And I had to adjust my temp to 325 b/c the 300 wasn't getting us anywhere after 30 minutes had gone by.

This was my first attempt at a shortbread cookie and it went very well. Just make sure you add the dry ingredients alittle at a time. They came out wonderful and hubby ate them all. My only issue, took wayy to long to bake, the whole house was smelling good within the first few minutes of baking.

Oh my goodness these are delicious!  I made these tonight on a whim, and I'm very glad I did.  When I tasted the batter, it didn't taste like anything special, so I added a bit of vanilla extract.  They still didn't taste like anything exciting.  The final product, however, is amazing.  They are very buttery and scrumptious.  I can'imagine these not satisfying a crowd!

I discovered this recipe out of necessity...I was going to make chocolate chip cookies and I was out of eggs.  I plugged in what I had into the recipe settings and this one came up.

I didn't have any of the problems of previous posters. Next time I'll be more careful in smoothing out the tops of the cookies for a better appearance.  I'd also like to make them with brown sugar, instead of white and see if it changes the flavor.

This is a very tasty variation of the flat, uniformed shortbread cookies that I love but am too lazy to make! These were very easy and delicious.

These are so great!  I've taken them and served them at many parties and always get compliments.  I use milk chocolate chips to make them even more rich and omit the walnuts because we have nut alergies in our family.  They never fail!

This did not have quite enough flavor for me.  I am going to try adding some extra nuts, minced in the food processor.  I think a little vanilla or brown sugar would expand the depth of the flavor.

Best shortbread cookies ever!!!  I sell mixed trays at Christmas, and did some sample platters this past weekend and got great reviews for the shortbread cookies!  Melt in your mouth and so simple to make.  I add my own things to the recipe, I don't add the chocolate chips or nuts.  However, after the cookies are baked and cooled, I melt the chocolate chips and drizzle them over the cookies.  Looks great and tastes even better!!

If you like shortbread, give these a try! They are not the traditional choc. chip cookie, and my husband didn't like them as much. I thought they were good, and easy to make. I will probably add them to my cookie trays at Christmas.

I'm moving across the country and needed to clear out my pantry so I made this recipe on a whim. I didn't have enough sugar so I used whatever I had: white sugar, splenda (from leftover packets I used for tea), and those natural sugar packets (or whatever they're called) that they have at Starbucks (again, leftover from numerous coffee purchases). The rest of the recipe I left as is (except for a bit more chocolate chips b/c I was trying to use up the rest of the bag). Can I just say my boyfriend would NOT stop ranting and raving about them! He even put up an away message for days that read "Sara's cookies rock my word" - haha. WONDERFUL COOKIES!

I made these for some clients at Christmas time and everyone loved them.  They are a nice change from plain old chocolate chip cookies.  The best part, I can make the dough and freeze it, big time saver!

Somewhat bland and the chocolate chips and shortbread didn't mix well to me.  My coworkers really liked them though- left home without leftovers.  I won't make these again though, for myself.  There are far more tasty cookies.  They were pretty easy to make, and made about 28.

I gave this recipe 5 stars because it is different, easy and delicious. I used mini semisweet chocolate chips.  These cookies are buttery and rich--perfect with a glass of milk or a cup of tea.  Will definitely make again.

This cookie was a little on the bland side.  I love shortbread cookies and I love chocolate chip cookies but I don't think this is a good substitution for both.  Good texture, melts in your mouth after it crumbles.

Love them! I make them every Sunday for school lunches the following week and usually have to make more by Tuesday. I use margarine and no nuts though. But it doesnt seem to make them taste much different. Really easy recipe too which I like. Thanks for sharing this Tina!

Easy AND tasty!  What could be better?
I skipped the nuts, as I don't like them, and used salted butter and omitted the extra salt.  Very good.

Not bad at all.  Not a huge fan of shortbread cookies, but the addition of chocolate chips was nice.  I think I prefer traditional chocolate chip cookies to these, but these are a breeze to whip up.  My son seemed to like them a lot, so I may make these again.

The taste of the cookie itself was good.  HOWEVER, there was melted butter literally oozing out of the cookies while they were baking and running to the side of the cookie sheet.  I also added vanilla for a little extra flavor.  I will definitely change the butter amount next time!

Sorry!  These cookies were not good at all (greasy and very bland).   I made a double batch for a baby shower at work and after tasting them, I decided not to bring them in.  They were just not what I expected from a chocolate chip cookie.  I guess I'm used to the taste of toll house cookies.

Delicious! True to their name, they actually taste like shortbread! I baked for 23 moins.

I love these cookies.  They're rich and the chocolate just makes the shortbread even yummier(I didn't use nuts).  My mother in law didn't like them, but then I made them using toffee chips instead of chocolate, and she said they were to die for (although I didn't like them without the chocolate!).
