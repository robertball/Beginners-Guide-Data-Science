Made these for my family tonight. Added seasoning to the meat and for my kids served it with ketchup on side. Extremely easy and satisfying. I did change one thing more. I wrapped the wontons then brushed them with oil. baked in the oven for 5-8 minutes on 400F less grease and less hands on time for my family off 7.

It was hard to taste the meat and cheese on the inside. I would try to add some seasoning to the meat next time.

This is the perfect appetizer for the football season. Theyâ€™re very easy to make and delicious.   I substituted Johnsonville sausage for the hamburger and they were a huge hit.  I recommend assembling them all at once before frying, because they fry up very quickly.

Quick and easy, and easy to adjust the filling based on how you like your cheeseburger.

I read the reviews and decided to bake as a reviewer suggested, it seemed healthier. It tasted so great, I experimented with other shredded cheese. I loved them all.

Though seasoning was not included in this recipe, I did add my own burger seasons to our taste. I also like to add minced onion. Ranch on the side and these are very good. The kids love them

I make these for parties.... I put cream cheese in the burger and also dice up dill pickles to put in them.... makes them creamy!  I also sometimes put a little dab of ketchup and mustard in before deep frying!
