In the South, this is also a variation on "pig candy." My friends & I prefer the savory version, also called "Bow Ties": wrap the bacon around Club-style crackers & sprinkle w/ Parmesan cheese. As the bacon cooks, it shrinks, & the cracker resembles a bow tie. Depending on your bacon (quality/thickness), they could possibly bake up to 2 hrs, even. These keep incredibly well for several days in an airtight container.

Wow - this one surprised me. I took earlier advice and lined CLUB rectangular crackers (better fit for bacon) on a cookie cooling rack over a baking sheet lined with parchment, just in case of the bacon grease factor. Only made about 30 of them, and that said, used about 8 slices applewood smoked bacon, cut into fourths, and they fit well on the cracker. Did a light dash of cayenne for some heat, then sprinkled with brown sugar, and cooked for an hour. I think you could up the heat a little on your oven (275?), or just broil them at the end to caramelize the brown sugar a little more. The crackers weren't soggy, and they were quite good and easy to make, with hardly any mess or grease on the pan. I think the choice of lean bacon is key to this one. Smokey, sweet, crunchy and little heat from the cayenne. I'll definitely do this one again. Note - for me, they tasted better warm than cold, but they reheat well and quickly.

Have made these many times and found out from the beginning it does not take ANYWHERE near the whole pound of brown sugar. For the last batch I used the new oval crackers with a "rim".  Worked GREAT.  I also add a bit of cayenne and black pepper to the brown sugar before "lightly" sprinkling over bacon....now you have sweet, salty, smoky AND spicy!!!!  Have also mixed some Penzey's Fox Point seasoning with the sugar before baking.  Superb.

Served these at a party and everyone went GAGA over them!  I don't think anybody had less than thirds!  I'm glad I made 3 batches!!!  We used Club crackers because of the good fit with the bacon slices.  Fabulous with light brown sugar & thick sliced bacon!  Extremely easy & makes a grand impression!!!

Everyone went CRAZY over these at my party.  One tip for people who like bacon as lean as possible--don't "wrap" the bacon around the cracker; the bacon on the bottom will still be a litte fatty.  Just lay the bacon on top, as in the original recipe.  And SPRINKLE just a little brown sugar.  Too much, and it won't melt.  These are SOOOO good.

I have made these before, but was just reminded of them by a friend.  My original recipe called for a rectangular cracker, such as a waverly,  It's easier to wrap the bacon.  The other great thing about my original recipe was that you could make these up to 3 days ahead of time and store them in an airtight container at room temperature.  You can serve them right from the tin or heat them up a bit in a low oven right before serving.  It's a great make ahead treat!!

These are ok.  I liked the simplicity, but I didn't really like the sweet/salty combination.  Some family members liked them, so I will try it again.  Here are some things I will try next time.  I will add some chili powder to the brown sugar to add some spice.  I will also cook the crackers on a cooling rack placed in a cookie sheet so the crackers won't soak up so much fat from the bacon.  I might also try another reviewer's suggestion and do a few with parmesan instead of sugar.

This was one of the most mediocre recipes I've encountered on this site. It wasn't bad, it just tasted like cooked bacon on a cracker. 

Don't expect some mysterious transformation to an epicurean delight. Bacon cooked on a cracker with a little brown sugar will always taste like bacon cooked on a cracker with brown sugar. No excitement at all.

Wasn't expecting much out of this recipe because there wasn't that much going into it but boy were we surprised! Delicious. I definitely will be making again. Used thick sliced maple flavored bacon and Townhouse crackers. Baked at 350 since I had another dish in the oven.

What's not to like, salty and sweet all in one!? Only the fat and sugar content! Round crackers should be replaced with oval or rectangular to better accomodate the bacon.

I don't know how you could go wrong with bacon and brown sugar in any combination. I saw this recipe and just had to try it... as others said, there's NO way you need an entire pound of brown sugar - I topped mine with a generous teaspoon on each.  I made a batch with a touch of cayenne and one without, and the unanimous decision was that the cayenne crackers won out.  I used just a touch, so it was more of an aftertaste, very subtle.  Would try jazzing this up a bit next time using some gourmet crackers and applewood smoked bacon - but even so, they were gone before they even cooled!  Will definitely make these again. ***Edit:  After the first batch, these have since been known by my friends as "bacon delights" and is easily the most requested item at parties.  Sad, really, considering all the other goodies I make.  In fact, I have people show up now with a pound of bacon and a box of crackers just so I have no excuse to not make them!  I have found that cooking them on a rack inside the cookie sheet works best, they are far less greasy than cooking directly on the cookie sheet.  Warning, though...once you make these you'll be making them for life.

OMG!!!!!  I would not change a thing! I used Townhouse Crackers since they are oval to match easier with the bacon. My 2 1/2 yr old was two fisting!!!  So easy....just make sure you remove from sheet before they cool or the sugar will harden to the bottom and the cracker will stick.  Extremely addicting :)

Wow!! Easy & GOOD!! Made these for a Halloween party last night. They were awesome & a hit. Used club crackers, cut the bacon in fourths, just sprinkled with very little brown sugar & baked at 350 for 35-40 minutes. Just kept a eye on them. Nicked name these "Pigs on Crack!" Lol!

I have made these for years and just realized that I don't think I've ever reviewed the recipe.  Quite simply, these things can ruin your life.  They are so easy and so yummy, and so small that you can eat them and eat them and eat them -- and find it hard to stop!  I've never made them that I haven't had people clamoring for the recipe.  I always use Townhouse Reduced-fat crackers (the bacon adds enough fat to go around) because the oblong shape works well.  I also try to cut off the parts of the bacon that are pure fat -- in other words, I like to see as much pink as white in the pieces of bacon I use.  I always give them a good, bubbly broil at the end of cooking and transfer each cracker to a cooling rack ASAP, as they will stick to the pan in no time. I've even given them a light dusting of cayenne pepper before cooking for an added kick, but they're great either way. Always a hit!

I posted these on a recipe request for someone yesterday, and having not made them before, and knowing I had all ingredients at home, I decided to give them a shot.  I used Town House crackers, and topped w/ about 1/8th piece of bacon, then sprinkled VERY little sugar on each piece (maybe 1/2 tsp), and topped w/ a small dash of cayenne pepper.  I baked them on a cooling rack, on top of a pan, so they wouldn't be overly greasy.  They were great right out of the oven!  They got a little "soggy" by this morning, when my son insisted he have one for breakfast, but they are a perfect little appy or snack, and so easy!

Ok, if you looked at this recipe, you like bacon.  So don't complain about fat!  These are yummy.  They are best with a Waverly-type cracker, baked on a rack.  I also used some freshly cracked pepper on mine, but you can also used Cajun seasoning or substitute Parm for the brown sugar.  Addicting.

I found that the crackers were just as good after several days and then popped back into the oven.  This will be an easy favorite.  Good for last minute get togethers.

I dig 'em.  I made these as a last minute "Plan B" when my "Bacon Bowls" just weren't working and I had bacon, Ritz, and brown sugar on hand.  I added a bit of cayenne pepper for a little heat to the brown sugar (of which you will need a few tablespoons, not a pound) and really liked the addition.  I got a little impatient towards the end and simply broiled for a minute to get the last crisp.  These may just be a appetizer staple since they're so easy to make.  THANKS, Gayle!

Very good. Will grease pan next time since any overflow from the brown sugar will cause them to stick to the pan.  A great party snack.

This sounded amazing and it did not disappoint.  I found that if you planned a little extra time to leave them in the oven until your bacon is just the correct crispiness for you liking that you end up with a perfectly candied piece of bacon.  I would also cut the bacon to the size of the cracker you are using and not necessarily in thirds, I was able to cut my bacon strips into 5 pieces and it worked great.  I made a lot of these for a party and there were not many left by the end of the night.

I decided to make this recipe based on all the great reviews. But, as someone said here, it's just a cracker with a piece of bacon and something sweet. I though flavors would blend and taste like a cheaper version of candied bacon, but... it just tastes like cracker and bacon. I thought this was a waste of calories.

Totally did not expect the wonderful taste of the cracker after the bacon and Brown Sugar had melded in the oven. Oh my. I ate one before I took them to a party, and then I ate another, and it was all I could do to stay home and eat 'em all! Really enjoyed how the bacon and brown sugar worked together on the cracker, and I used about a half a teaspoon of the brown sugar on each piece of bacon. If you love bacon and snacks, you've gotta try this! Thanks, Gayle.

Just as DawnieB mentioned, I use the Club crackers and cut my bacon slices in half so one piece wraps all the way around the long end of the cracker, lay them with the ends of bacon piece on the bottom, then sprinkle Parmesan cheese generously over top all of them on the cookie sheet.  Don't remember them taking an hour.  I just keep an eye on them and when the bacon is done, I remove them from the cookie sheet so they don't get soggie in the little bit of bacon drippings.  Yummo!

Maybe I used too much bacon, but the cracker absorbed the grease, and turned into a pillow of fat.  I like bacon, but want the fat cooked out of it.  It was just too greasy for my taste.

These were delicious and very simple to make. I strongly advise baking them on a cooling rack placed inside the cookie sheet to keep the crackers from soaking up all the grease. I used my 1/2 teaspoon measuring spoon and put one scoop (not bothering to level it) in the center of each piece of bacon. This was the perfect amount for me although I didn't use anywhere near an entire pound. I will definitely make this again.

Update:  Dash of Cayenne Pepper on top of the brown sugar really adds to this recipe! 
Made this for an appetizer party.  They were the first to go.  I had to limit folks to just 3 in order for others to get a taste!  They stood by the dish and just threw them in like popcorn.  I made them several times since then.  Thick sliced bacon makes them chewier.  Applewood Black Pepper bacon gives them a nice twist.  I must say, that "el-cheapo" bacon and ritz are just fine.  :)  They are affectionatly known as "heart attack crackers" in my group of friends, but they disappear in minutes.  Taking them to a poker party tonight.  Since my boyfriend shows up later from work I have to hide a few for him!

Love these & make often. I add a teaspoon of chili powder (give or take) per cup of brown sugar to give it a little spark. Try various crackers. Do use parchment paper otherwise these will stick if you don't get them out fast. Great appetizers to serve but you will need a lot of them, they go fast.

These were a huge hit with friends and family. Everyone kept going back for more and I didn't have any to bring back home for myself.  I tried these a second time with turkey bacon and everyone agreed it was better.  Not to mention a bit healthier.

I should have listened to the other reviewers and reduced the amount of sugar. They were so sweet that the bacon was overpowered. I will try them again though, and not use so much. Also, plan on baking them for about 70 minutes for a good crisp. Very unique appetizer!

I adore these.  Perfection.  I did use club crackers, and added a teensy pinch of cayenne to the sugar sprinkle.  Got rave reviews & NO leftovers at a pot-luck.

Yum. These are really good. I burnt the first batch by trying to speed up the cooking. Followed the directions on the second batch and they came out great. I'm still playng around with the amount of brown sugar I want on them and I did use the Club, rectangular shaped, butter crackers. Thanks for the recipe!

I love these! I used oval crackers, as suggested. I also used turkey bacon, for health reasons. I used less brown sugar than it called for as I just sprinkled on what looked right. I cooked them for less time--probably 40 minutes, as turkey bacon doesn't take as long as regular bacon. It also didn't really render any grease, which was good. I think for next time I will take another reviewer's suggestion to add a bit of cayenne pepper to give it a spicy note! These are great, if you like crackers, bacon, and sugar--which we do!

These were wonderful.  Made them for a Christmas gathering.  No one could stop eating them.  Good thing I made a bunch!  I did turn the heat up to 350 for about 10 more minutes just to make them crispy.  They were perfect.  I used Ritz crackers and just folded the bacon pieces to fit.  I used plenty of the brown sugar.  I also lined my baking pan with foil for quick clean up.  I even made several for myself one evening while my husband had a board meeting.  It was a great supper :)

My husband and I love these.  I usually precook the bacon and drain it to cut down on grease.  I think I'm going to have to try turkey bacon as well.  Personally, I prefer the Ritz-type crackers to the rectangular ones.  These are wonderful and easy!!

These crackers were fabulous!  Easy to make and full of flavor. :-)  We served them at a party and they were gone quickly.  I used 1/4 of a strip of bacon per Club cracker (rectangular), which worked out well.

Made these for an ornament party I had last night. At first, I thought, these just look like a cracker with bacon on them. After I ate one or two they grew on me. Bacon got really crisp and brown sugar added a nice sweetness to it. Be careful because some of mine got a tad too burnt on bottom. Did not get asked for the recipe, though. That's usually my rule of thumb whether I make something again. Easy and good, though.

I LOVED this recipe.  They are easy, very addicting, and you can't eat just one!  I also added cheese to 1/2 the crackers a few min before they were done.  I will definatley make these again!  I recommend them for something like a SuperBowl party, or maybe for sitting down and watrching a movie.  (Or just to eat!)

I made these for a party and they were gone in about 3 minutes!  People just stood over the plates and ate them till they were gone.  I used rectangular crackers and center cut bacon.  I sprinkled with cayenne, which is a must, I agree with previous reviewers.  The ones that came out the best were the ones where the raw bacon piece was slightly bigger than the cracker.  After baking it covered the cracker perfectly from end to end.  This is my new go-to finger food party recipe!

Took these to a church function and they disappeared so fast I was shocked.  One guy said they're like bacon candy.  I made a couple of adjustments the second time I made them.  Only put a small piece of bacon on each cracker (just enough to cover the cracker) and did half with parmesan cheese and half with brown sugar.  We loved both flavors.  Thanks for an excellent recipe.

Sorry, but we were not big fans of this appetizer.  The buttery cracker got very soggy from all the bacon.  (And I even put them on a wire rack while cooking, hoping that some of the bacon fat would drip down.)  We'll eat anything with bacon, but these were just not our favorites.  Based on all the 5 star reviews, we are currently the exception with not liking them.

I made these for a appetizer at our Easter get together today and everybody loved them.
What isn't good with bacon on it!

I made these on my husband's birthday, which happened to land on an NFL Sunday game day, as a "Pigskin Snack." Boy, did he love them! I used the tip about laying the prepped crackers on a cookie cooling rack and then stood the rack on top of a cooking sheet. The crackers came out crisp and delicious. I also baked them at 275 for about 40 minutes. They came out perfect. Great snack for football!

I first tasted these at our coffee hour after Sunday service at my church. They are wonderful! They are the first thing to go during our coffee hour when the ladies bring them in.

I had these at a cocktail party and we all went nuts.  Searched until I found the recipe.  I've tried both good, freshly grated cheese and the cheaper cheese and actually the cheaper (green container) works better since it melts more easily.  And- Club Crackers are the best.  try them, you won't be sorry

This is an awesome recipe, super easy, I cooked at a little higher temp to crisp the bacon a bit quicker, I think I went up 25 degrees :D  Great for a party!!

These were a nice surprise. Very interesting. I couldn't stop eatting them! One thing I will say is Do NOT let them cool on the pan! They will stick and crumble into pieces when you try to take them off!

My variation:   Club crackers sprinkled generously with parmesan, wrap in bacon. Bake 1 hour at 250 on rack placed on baking sheet so bacon drippings can fall.   These are so good. I serve them as appetizers at parties.

I could eat and entire recipe of this. They were awesome. I used the type of crackers made for toppings (they have a little sort of lip around the edge) and baked them on a cooling rack on the cookie sheet and they turned out great. I took them to a party and they were probably the highlight of the evening.

No suprise that I burnt the first batch I made!  Second time around turned out GREAT!  Used Keebler TopEms and followed the recipe directions.  Only took about 40 minutes in my toaster oven.

Savory and Sweet.  WE all liked it.  I used the "Club" crackers instead, because  I like them better and I thought the bacon would fit better.

My mom used to make these when I was little except she used captains wafers and wrapped it around each one. They were so good. I do remember that they were a little greasy but I didn't care and still wouldn't because they are soo good!

Made this for a Super Bowl party and they were the hit of the party! EVERYONE asked for the recipe, and loved that it was soooo easy yet so delicious. I used pita crackers because that was what I had on hand but that made them all the better because they had great crunch and less fat.

I made this according to the directions and I really liked them. What was initially ok became addictive.  I would def try the advice to use longer crackers that fit better. As is they didn't look impressive. Or actually next time I would try and wrap it around like the bowtie reviews.  Nice taste.

What a pleasant little surprise these crackers are!  I only had fat free saltines and 40% reduced fat bacon and it worked out perfectly.  I thought the crackers might get soft but they were cooked to perfection.  Thanks for this great little recipe Gayle, I'm sure I'll make them often!

Just ok.  Too much grease soaked into the cracker, even when baked on a cooling rack. For that much fat and colories, I'd rather have something else.

This was okay.  Maybe a little too much grease for my taste.  I might try it again but msybe add some sliced apples and cheddar after the bacon has crisped up.

I burned it ...even though I was warned in the comments.  The one I did taste that wasn't burned had good flavor but was a bit too dry.  I may try this again but not sure I want to watch something so closely when I am entertaining.

Wow, these could be dangerous!  I used Town House crackers and center cut bacon.  I had some chipotle chili powder, so I gave the bacon a little sprinkle before adding the brown sugar.   I did kick the oven up to 325 the last 15 minutes because the sugar didn't seem to be melting.  Then I gave them just a minute under the broiler.  I took them to a Christmas party and got rave reviews.

I expected the brown sugar to melt and maybe carmelize a bit -- my brown sugar didn't do that at all.  I baked at 250 degrees for 1 hour, then added about 15 more minutes, because they didn't look browned and crisp.  The bacon is done, but the brown sugar is clumped on top, pretty much looking like I just sprinkled it on.  They taste okay, but not what I was expecting.

Thanks anyway!

Wow!  I found this recipe because I was in charge of appetizers at a "Progressive Dinner."  I thought it would be an interesting addition to the assortment.  I cannot believe how crazy they all went over it.  These are so easy to make and sure to please!
