This is the same recipe given to me 30 years ago by a friend, and I will vouch for the fact that it's really, really good!  I always mix it up in a blender rather than using a cocktail shaker.

Yuuum! Although I made some changes due to diet and ingredient availability, it turned out great and this is a recipe I will definitely make again in the future. The changes I made were: subbing some no-sugar-added-cranberry juice for lemon and lime, and swapping sugar out for 1/2 tsp stevia, swapping gin for vodka, and also swapping half & half with heavy cream. I also used a blender and added the ice and soda at the end to prevent it from getting slushy and going flat.

One of my all time faves.  I don't add the egg white because I think it's yucky, I just shake it for longer and I still get the foam.
