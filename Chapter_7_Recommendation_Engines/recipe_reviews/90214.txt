I LOVE THESE MUFFINS!  They've fast become my favorite snack and breakfast.  I wanted to get 12 muffins instead of 8, so I increased the cornmeal to 1 cup, substituted buttermilk for the soy milk, 2 whole eggs, and increased the vegetable oil to 1 cup - still a tad dry, but I like them that way.  I used fresh fennel - about 2 Tbl - from the Farmer's Market (why I tried this recipe in the first place), and added fresh rosemary and basil - 1 Tbl. each - plus the dried thyme.  I think you could use any herbs you wanted or had on hand.  I also used whole wheat flour for all-purpose and local raw honey for the sugar.  These muffins just get better and better every day and are good cold, warm, on their own or with a meal.

These are good when made by substituting whole wheat flour for the all purpose flour and honey for the sugar! They are best when cold, when the flavors of the thyme and fennel really come through!

This is an interesting corn muffin.  It's different...not one I'd probably make again, but only because it just didn't "wow" me.  If I were a regular chili maker, this might be my muffin of choice.

I can't decide if I like these or not. When I first tasted one, I thought they were weird - not horrible, just a really strange flavor. Then I had one with some chicken soup for lunch, and I thought it was pretty good. I'll probably have a couple more with soup over the weekend, but I very much doubt I'd make them again. Thanks anyway!

very unique and delicious! My family loved it! Even my husband who hates fennel asked for seconds!

This was ok but not something I'd repeat.  Maybe I just don't like fennel that much!  I followed the recipe as written except used regular milk instead of soy and 1/4 cup oil instead of 1/2.

These are okay but to  me a little dry and more of a "just" muffin instead of a corn muffin...not enough cornmeal. Used buttermilk instead of soy, 2 whole eggs and butter instead of vegetable oil. I'll have to experiment with this one...REALLY!

By themselves the muffins are a little dry and an odd flavor, definitely not sweet at all. But with a soup or stew they're perfect! I followed the recipe except I only used 1 Tbs of fennel seed, and I didn't take the time to crush them (I should do that next time, it would probably help the flavor). Also this made 12 muffins for me, not 8. I served them with a pork and black bean stew which was perfect for dipping and eating.
