The best Cholay/Chana Masala recipie... as long as a couple of adjustments are made.

1. One can of chickpeas per batch
2. Use a strong robust black tea (Find a local Indian store and ask the clerk what their best tea is. For me it was Red Label orange pekoe)
3. Use a good amount of tea (about 1/8 cup per batch)
4. Don't split the beans in half, just dump the whole can in your tea-water
5. Boil down the tea water to about half, and throw everything else into this pot. (it helps to start the tea-water/chickpea process in a medium-large saucepan)

One interesting variation is to add about 1/2c plain yogurt towards the end, this will add a little tangy, and give you more gravy to mix with your rice.

Excellent recipe.  It took me two tries to get it just right though.  I adjusted some items the second time I made it as follows.  First, I reduced the amount of Chickpeas to one can while keeping the other amounts the same.  I personally like this ratio better, and it left lots of extra gravy for rice or naan. Next, I used a high quality, rich black tea to heat the chickpeas.  Third, it definitely needs the salt added.  Don't underestimate this.  Last I added a fair amount of cayenne to make it nice and spicy (again my preference).

Bland.  I even tried adding more spices at the end, and again when
reheating, and that helped a little but not enough.  Perhaps it's that
most of the spices only get added to the onions; the tomatoes get them
indirectly and the chickpeas only get added to the spiced mixture near the
very end.  It's probably that, combined with the tomatoes mellowing out
the dish too much.
 The "Chickpea Curry" recipe on this site is better (and easier).

It's actually a fairly easy recipe that doesn't take nearly as much preparation time as suggested, especially if you use canned tomatoes.  

In addition, while it is mild in flavor this is a recipe that is easy to alter to your own taste.  

For a thicker, more curry-like and spicier sauce, just add some sour cream/nonfat plain yogurt, curry, and red pepper to taste. (Probably heavy cream could be used too.)  Extra tumeric will give it that yellow color.

Highly recommended, especially if you like garbonzo/chickpeas. 

Use it as a base or  enjoy experimenting.  Either way, it is delicious.

I tasted it while it was still in the pan (during that last five minutes of cooking) and I was pretty disappointed in the flavor.  So then I added another round of spices, including cayenne pepper, 1/4 tsp. garam masala, 1/8 tsp. curry powder, and 1/8 tsp. garlic salt.  I let it cook for another ten minutes so that all the chickpeas were soft.  I served it on top of brown rice and it is delicious.  Instead of a tea bag I used some loose Indian-spiced rooibos.  I would definitely make this again, I will just be sure to double the spices.

The way to make this taste it came from an Indian restuarant is to add a small can of tomato paste near the end of cooking.  Much Improved!

Good start but a tad bland for may taste.  Perhaps some curry paste or doubling the spice quantities.  As others have mentioned, this is a rather involved recipe that requires numerous bowls, pans and pots.  If you don't have a dishwasher or teenage kids, pass on this recipe.

This was a great starting point for a delicious pot of cholay.  All I did was add another round of spices, along with some amchar (mango powder) and some channa masala powder.  I also take out about a third of the final product, mash it up a little, and add it back in.  Thanks for the recipe!

DELICIOUS & nutritious dinner time favourite! Not too complicated, and excellent flavour. I served it this time with plain couscous and "Absolutely Perfect Palak Paneer" from this site. Even better the next day, served alone with whole wheat pita! BIG hit with both my husband & I, and will become a regular for us vegetarians. One comment -- it's pretty salty, so no need to add salt to taste.

Maybe I did something wrong, though I can't figure out what...even with all the spices, I found it really bland.  Added some Chana Masala, though, and everything was yummy...

There are some tremendously good flavours in the second onion mixture, but the first, unspiced mixture and the chickpeas unfortunately dilute that flavour unacceptably when it's all mixed together. Next time I'll season the chickpeas as i boil them (I used dried), and I'll double the seasonings overall, plus add some more tomatoes. This recipe does need salt (added 1 tsp)! Cinnamon and cloves help too. Worth trying again with tweaks.

We really liked this recipe.  My son is a vegan and he raved about it.  I fixed brown basmati rice to accompany it and it was very filling and flavorful.  I balked at the amount of cayenne, but put it in anyway (I do like spice!)  It wasn't too spicy at all-just right.

Easy to make!  Very tasty!  I used a spiced tea  for this.  I omitted the cilantro because I had none on hand, but can imagine the flavor would have made it better!  Served over cooked millet, this was great!

Very good!  My wife & I both really enjoyed this.  Because we were having rice with it, I only used half of the chickpeas to lower the carbs, but I would definitely make this again.

Let me start off with this: every recipe I approach, I always add the seasonings (salt & pepper, powders, etc.) to my own taste so I generally don't ever cook something that comes out bland. I believe you have leeway with this part of any recipe. I have made this recipe a number of times and have altered it to a technique I am comfortable with. It comes out out really flavourful and delicious. I was actually surprised at how good it came out. It really had authentic flavour and a bit of heat. One of the things I changed is that I cook all the Chickpeas at one time instead of separating them. I didn't understand the need to do it this way and the chickpeas that didn't cook as long were "crunchier" than the others and I do not like crunchy chickpeas. I also only use one can of chickpeas but I do add diced potatoes because I wanted some diversity in the dish. Only having chickpeas is a bit monotonous to me. Sometimes I might throw in a bit of chopped Kale at the end to add some colour and another texture. I serve it on top of Jasmine Rice which is my favourite rice. Our family loves this dish.

This has the potential to be a great dish but it definitely needs more spices (garam masala and turmeric are NOT optional) and less garbanzo beans. Will certainly make again because this tastes quite authentic to me.

I am not sure what I did wrong. The smell is fantastic but the flavour is rather bland. I followed very closely to the recipe. I would like to try this again but this time with higher amounts of the spices. That might help to give it more flavour.

I really liked this recipe and I also liked the suggestions for change.  I used the can of tomato paste added toward the end, as suggested by one person and about a half a cup of plain yogurt, suggested by another, and I only used one can of garbanzo beans  It really bulked up what looked at first to be a small meal.  One thing I would say: if you do choose to bulk it up this way, I would add the two cans of garbanzos as one can is not enough for the bulked up version.  Thank you for a tasty recipe and all the helpful suggestions!

This was delicious!  For Indian food, it was relatively simple, too.  I basically skipped step 2, putting everything together in step 3.  This way the spices got more into everything insted of just part of it.

I agree with the suggestions to lower the chickpea-to-vegetables ratio, next time I will use the whole amount of onions suggested and even more tomatoes.

Thanks for the recipe, I will definitely make this again.

This recipe is delicious.  The only reason I did not give it 5* is because I wanted to know if I used fresh garbanzo beans how much to use to equal the two 15 oz. cans.  I will make this again for sure -

The only reason I am not giving this recipe five stars is that the recipe is very complicated.  However, the effort was well worth it.  This is a delicious nutritious Indian dish and I will definitely make it again!  I served it over rice for dinner and had leftovers in whole wheat pita for lunch the next day.

We were very disappointed with this one. I really shouldn't give this any stars since we couldn't even finish our plates and had to throw out the leftovers. Couldn't find a way to salvage it.

I used a can of stewed tomatos and some tomato paste instead of the fresh tomatos.  I also added a bag of frozen onions and peppers.  I thought this recipe was pretty good and very easy/economical.  I served it with brown rice.

This was positively delicious.  It tasted like I bought it from a good Indian restaurant.  I served it over Basmati rice and it was perfect.

This was really good!  I didn't have the garam masala, and I think it would have been even better with that.  I did not use the tea bag (we don't drink tea), and my husband wanted some chicken in his--otherwise we followed the recipe and it was great!

I followed the recipe but it tasted bland. It's missing something. Definitely needs more spices and herbs. But my Dad likes it.

This was wonderful....I did not use more than one pot to make it all. I boiled my chickpeas for a few minutes rather than just heating them up, and I also didn't reserve any.  Served over basmati rice.  I will make this again and again.  Thanks for the post Shammi!

Complicated but tasty.  My canned chickpeas were not as soft as needed, you can't just pour them in and call it quits.  I recently had an Indian gal in my neighborhood bring this dish to a potluck and hers was better than mine...I thin it mainly had to do with the texture of the chickpeas and how much flavor they take on.

The spices and seasonings were great.  I think the can of chickpeas I bought was not too good...they were a lot harder than I would have liked.

Very good.  I substituted Petite Diced canned Tomatoes (one can)for the fresh tomatoes, since it's past the good tomato season; and curry powder for the coriander and cumin only because I feel it's a little more authentic that way.  Served it on rice.  Tasted like we have at Indian restaurants!

I cut the amounts in half, as I wanted to make this quite spicy, and hubs - he's not a fan of spice.  I heated my spices , sautéed them with onions and a bit of garlic, and then put all ingredients into my slow cooker to let it really all meld.  It smelled sooooo good while cooking.

I didn't have curry seeds so used my curry powder (Jafna brand) and the flavor was great! I didn't like having to use three pans to make this and am thinking there should be an easier way but am happy with the flavor. Served with naan bread. Very good!

Just tried it, and saved it to my recipe box. I added more spices/and the amchor powder for that tart flavor, and also added curry to it. I made mine a little bit spicier.

These do take a little effort but  worth it. I made this for an  "middle eastern" dinner we had one evening. Tandori chicken, naan, and basti rice (all on the site) It was well worth the planning and just as good as the local restaurant we go to. Will make again.

This is my go-to recipe for a quick veggie curry. I usually up the spices quite a bit, or sometimes I just use a small can of chickpeas and the same amount of spices and sauce. Really delicious and easy.

Requires 3 pots/skillets to make this one dish!! Good flavor, but has quite a lot of onion.  Next time I think I'll omit the sliced onion.
