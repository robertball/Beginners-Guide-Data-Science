This recipe had me at hello - The name is very clever. THe blueberries, however, seemed to overwhelm the taste of the cherries and the oranges.  This is fine if you are extending a recipe - but I was hoping for one where you could taste all the flavors.  I added more cherries, 1 TBSP fresh ginger (thinking Asian, as suggested by the Mandarin), and some orange zest. I never would have thought of the pairings on my own, so think Chef RachtheBach is talented.
