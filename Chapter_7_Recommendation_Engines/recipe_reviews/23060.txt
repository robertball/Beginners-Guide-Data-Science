I'm an avid hunter and have been making a version of this recipe for years. I like to lightly dust  venison backstraps medallions (1/4" thick) in flour, then follow the recipe as is. I also do add a touch of dry sherry during the browning process to really give it a kick. Delicious and heathly meal. Enjoy!

I'm always looking for something new for all that deer meat my husband brings home...this was very good.  I served it over mini penne pasta. The only thing I might do differently is used reduced sodium soup.

With a few changes this recipe is wonderful! I used 'golden mushroom soup' instead of other (it makes a big difference), two heaping spoonfuls of sour cream 30 min before serving instead of other, and a can of sliced mushrooms all in the crock pot. Kept other stuff the same. Excellent over wide egg noodles!

Neither my husband or I liked this recipe.  It did nothing for the venison taste plus the cream of mushroom taste was very overwhelming.

I too have made a similar recipe for years. It's a great hit with everyone I have served it to. (Even those that insist they DON'T LIKE VENISON!) I serve mine over baked potatoes, after cooking all day in the slow cooker, the meat is so tender it practically falls apart. Awesome recipe!!

Love using our venison anyway I can.  I also added a bunch of mushrooms, sauteing them with the onions and fresh garlic first.  Then browned the meat (dusted with flour and paprika).  Put all of that with the soup and about a 1/4 cup of sherry in the crockpot.  Finished it with 1/4 cup sour cream just before serving.  Voila! It was soooo tender.

I made this recipe because we were all out of food (except for venison) and snowed in...I was skeptical about venison stroganoff simply because my husband is bery picky when it comes to venison. I have only found 3 different ways he actually likes it prepared. Now I am up to 4 thanks to this recipe! He LOVED it. Now I know more than 3 recipes, that freezer filled with venison won't go to waste! Oh and the kids ate it up as well....my son was surprised that it was venison! Take that picky eaters!!!

Husband and son thought this dinner was wonderful.  I browned the meat and onions on the stovetop and then put the mixture in the crock-pot.  Since we are not mushroom people, I only added 1 can of COM soup and added 1 can of CO Celery soup.  Worked wonderfully (so I'm told), as I don't care for venison.  I served over hot white rice as that is how my family likes stroganoff along with steamed broccoli.  Cathy they loved this recipe and asked that I make it again sometime.  Thanks for sharing.

This was good, albiet very rich.  I like another reviewer's suggestion of adding sherry during browning and I may try this next time (simmering the venison in the sherry for a little while). This may help the meat to soften up (ours was a little tough) and lose some of the gaminess that really came through in this dish.

Tom loved this.  I added some sliced mushrooms to the chopped onions and sauted in olive oil and then set aside.  I floured the meat, sauted it in oil and added seasoning while it was frying.  Tom bought creamy portabello soup and when it was added to the pan with the rest of the ingredients, the flour thickened it up nicely.  Added a little sour cream and voila!

Very good recipe.  I'm not crazy about deer, but my husband loves it and we always have some in the freezer.  This receipe was so easy. I didn't even bother with sauteing the onions or browning the meet.  I put it all in the slower cooker and went from there.  We told the kids it was beef and they couldn't tell the difference.  I didn't have egg noodles and used white rice instead.  It worked out perfectly.  I will definately make this again.

This is a wonderful change for venison. I am always looking for good venison recipes and this is definately a keeper. I wasn't sure if the meat would be tender enough so I cooked and extra ten minutes and it was extremely tender. I do think 2 cans of soup is a bit much so I will use 1 next time. Otherwise this is terrific!

I let the deer soak in milk for about an hour before cooking.  I used minced garlic (about 1 1/2 Tblsp).  A few shakes of paprika, and sherry (to cover skillet) when I began sauteeing the onions.  I added additional sherry when I put the meat in the skillet. It was delicious!!!

I would make this recipe again but with modifications.  I would not use any onion made onion powder and I would add milk to the soup to thin it a little.

Great, easy recipe. Made this with canned dear meat so the whole thing took about 15 minutes total. Didn't have sour cream or egg noodles - served it over rice instead and it was still delicious.

I received a rear roast of venison a family friend brought down in Wis.  I made this recipe because I LOVE stroganoff & I had a surplus of cream of mush. soup & portabella shrooms Y-U-U-U-M.  The ONLY difference is I did not drain the broth made from browning...I used fresh minced garlic and yummy vidalia onion.  THANK YOU!  I got rave reviews from my boyfriend and his friend!  I will definately be using this recipe again and again!

made this the way the recipe said the first time and I don't think I will do that again. All in all it was good and even my picky eater ate it but it needs something a little more. I  I think that I will use only one can of soup and try roasted garlic and mushroom soup instead.  I will also add a can of peas & mushrooms each.  I will also try it in the crock pot instead of on the stove as the meat came out really tough.

I have been making this same dish, thought mine was the only one, only I add Laury's Seasoning Salt to my venison while I am cooking it and sliced or canned mushrooms.  Since I am lactose intolerant I don't add the sour cream!  This is also really good with hamburger if you do not like venison!

This was my first time cooking Venison.  My husband's golf buddy brought him some from his hunting expedition.  I was very reluctant about cooking it because I heard that after preparing the meat would taste "gamey".  I looked around online and found out that soaking the meat at least 8 hours ahead of time would help get rid of the gamey taste.  I let the meat soak in milk in the fridge the night before.  I followed the recipe and everything turned out great!  Me being me, I just added a bit more seasonings.  Everybody loved it and can't wait for me to cook it again. Thanks for submitting!

I liked it. I used low fat sour cream and soup so it wasn't the full flavor, but I still liked it. My husband didn't like the sauce though. Keep in mind, he's hard to please.

I made this in my crockpot and the meat was so tender it fell apart. I changed it a little bit. I used elk meat and used 1 can of cream of mushroom soup and 1 can of beefy mushroom. I also used only 1/4 cup of sour cream. My family really loved it and I’ll definitely be making it again.

Great recipe! Easy and tastes delicious. Way too many noodles though for my liking. I used half and used the other half for something else.

I do not care for the taste of venison at all.  I have found if you brine the meat a few days in advance,  it tastes more like beef,   and less like venison.

I wasn't all that impressed with this but was partly my fault.  The venison was cooked perfectly and then I let it cook a few minutes longer and it got pretty tough.  I thought the sauce was pretty bland so I cooked in a little red wine, Worstershire and then even a little Chulula for a kick.

My husband loved this!  I unfortunately could not eat it as I had to be on a totally fat free diet and did not have fat free soup or sour cream in the house.  I'm looking forward to trying it myself in the future!

Delicious even with rigitoni noodles instead of egg noodles.  The cooking process does not tenderize the meat, so a tender cut of venison is a must.  Our whole family liked it (ages 1 to 60's).

This is the easiest and most delicious stroganoff I’ve ever made. If you don’t like venison then use beef. Only thing I did differently was used a little cooking sherry. That’s it.

This was a good meal. The 4 stars is only because I feel the amount of sour cream recommended, was a bit too much. I changed things up a bit by using minced garlic, sautéed with the onions. I then put a cup of beef bullion in the sauté and put the venison in to simmer until tender and drained off most of it to follow the remaining directions.

This was good. I really don't understand why people would want to put flour on the venison before frying. It is not needed. The venison was tender and the sauce was good. The kids (3 and 5) even ate it.  My husband really enjoyed it.

this is one of my fav's for normal meal making. However i cant always afford venison so i have made it with hamburger or tuna so it is a nice way to switch it up a bit. Though I'm also allergic to onions  so i just skip it.  but overall this is absolutely amazing to cook over and over again on just about any pasta.

I changed the recipe a little. First, I marinated the venison overnight in a zip lock bag with salt, pepper, garlic,  and some fajita spice in a small amount of olive oil.  I followed the rest of the recipe except I browned meat in my slow cooker/pressure cooker and then slow cooked it for 6 1/2 Hours.  Final step, I butter coated my noodles before serving. 
Meat was tasty but a little dry. In the future, I'll shorten slow cooker time to 4 hours.
Fast and excellent recipe.
Loved it.

I made this, turned out amazing, now I don't have access to venison, so I did use beef. With the soup, I added two cups of milk and I used one can of cream of mushroom and one can of cream of chicken because some comments on here said the mushroom soup took away the taste a bit, I also made jasmine rice with this which made it much more filling.

Instead of using the cubes, I used the burger. I also added about 1/2 cup of milk to help make it a little more "creamy".   Made HUGE bowl there was barely any left over.

For those of you who want less of venison flavour, maybe adding a bit of soy sauce would help. I added white wine stalk, onion,mushrooms, celery, soy sauce to mine if anyone is looking for more stuff to add--it's really great. This recipe is awesome too very basic and very good!

Easy and tastes great!  (If you use home-canned venison,  as I did, you will need to rinse it first and skip the added salt.  Otherwise it will be too salty.)

Great recipe, simple and quick. As an avid hunter we always have wild game available. This stroganoff was a great compliment to venison. We will make it again the only thing we will change iswe like things a little spicier so we will add something to give it some heat..

Everyone enjoyed this meal. I cooked the onion and venison as directed, but then put the venison, onion, mushroom soup, garlic powder and pepper into a crock pot and slow cooked it for a couple hours. That really helped to blend the flavors nicely. I skipped the sour cream but instead added a can of condensed milk as it slow cooked. The result was a very thick and tasty stroganoff. Slow cooking with the milk added allowed the lactic acid in the milk to help tenderize and tame the venison.

Delicious recipe for deer! Added 4 minced garlic cloves to the pan when the meat was nearly cooked, as we are fans of the garlic/wild game taste. The only thing is that I found it way too thick after adding the mushroom soup. I ended up adding a cup of milk just to make it into a thick sauce, so it was a consistency where I could stir it. Also, with the salt in the soup, it was the perfect amount. I added none to the meat before cooking.

This was a hit with my family and so easy to make.  I substituted the noodles for brown rice and it was delicious!

This recipe is WONDERFUL! It is a great way to use venison.  I am married to a serious hunter. So, needless to say, I am always in need of different and delicious recipes.  This one is a huge hit.

Easy prep, enjoyed the meal but I added sherry to it about a half a cup and it made it more flavorful and very delicious. My venison adverted family enjoyed every bit of it and I was complemented.. A keeper for my hunting buddies too.

Delicious!  I added  You only need 1 can of soup and 1/2 the sour cream plus I added a  1/2 cup milk to the soup so it wasn't too thick, other than that I followed the recipe and it came out wonderful!  Everyone enjoyed it!  If you double the meat, than don't adjust the soup or sour cream.

I made this last night and added mushrooms and also used the roasted garlic mushroom soup.  It was delicious.  My husband says it is his new favorite meal.  Definitely will make again.

Used Beefy Mushroom soup & Golden mushroom soup. Also added fresh mushrooms to the steak & put it all in the Crockpot. Added 1/2 can of tomato paste, along with the sour cream before serving. Really delicious & very tender.

It wasn't as thick as I thought it would be.  Less cream or add corn starch to make it stick to the noodles and meat.  All in all delicious though.

It was terrible. We ate it with white rice which was the saving grace of the meal.  We both eat venison all the time, I like it better than beef.  So I was sceptical of a cook time of 30 minutes, as well I should have been.  I will stick to slow cooking for venison from now on.

i didn't  have 2 cans of cream of mushroom so i used 1 each cream of mushroom and one of cream of celery. also thought mixture was thick and wasn't sure if i should add water so i added a can of h2o also. the end result was still excellent, and will definitely be used again with what ever meat is on hand.

I made this for my family and everyone absolutely loved it! My picky dad gave it 10 stars! Instead of using canned mushroom soup, i made my own using the Cream of Mushroom Soup I recipe from this site and used 21 oz of it. I will definitely be making this again!

Here are the changes I made:  I used t 8 oz packages of seitan that I had simmered in 3 cups of water and 4 teaspoons of vegetarian beef flavored granules instead of the venison.  I sliced 6 largish mushrooms I had in the fridge and added 2 4 oz czns (drained) of mushroom ends and pieces.  I also added about 8 oz of water and a couple of ounces of dry vermouth.  I also used whole wheat noodles.  My vegetarian family just loved this, and I will definitely make it again, as there are very few good seitan recipes.

Could use more simmer cooking time and the onions listed took all taste from the venison.  Other than that, it tasted good and the guests liked it.

Very rich. I substituted a vegitarian grain fake meat which lowered the fat content. My husband said it tasted like something I already made without the recipie. This would also work beef or elk meat.
