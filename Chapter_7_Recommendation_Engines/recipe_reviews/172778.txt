This was a tasty recipe and one that I'll definitely make again. Go easy on the lime--1 probably would have been more than enough! Also, be warned that the mint leaves will turn the soda a brownish-pink color. If it bothers you, try adding a drop of red food coloring.

Great tasting.  I did use 1 lime and 1-1/2 tablespoons of lime juice; doubled the amount of strawberries.  The drink had a great strawberry flavor with just a touch of enough lime.  Will definitely make again for a hot summer night in Florida.

Yum - and limey! I don't know what a 'real' strawberry Mojito is supposed to taste like, but this stuff is good. I strained mine through a fine seive to get out the pulverized bits and did take the previous reviewers suggestion of a teeny bit of red food coloring. I forgot to sugar my glass, but it looked pretty with some sliced strawberries and mint leaves floating in it and was plenty sweet. Thanks for the recipe!

I followed others' suggestions of only adding one lime -- next time I will add both as the recipe says.  I could hardly taste the lime.  I did go easy on the sugar, because I tend to like my drinks unsweetened.  I found that the strawberry flavor was sort of lost in there, so I would definitely double up on those next time.  After mashing everything together, I poured the soda into the pitcher and let it sit in the fridge for several hours (I did stir it occasionally).  I did wish the strawberry flavor was more intense, but overall, yummy, refreshing summer drink!  Everyone wanted seconds!

This okay, I recommend only using one lime and going easy on the sugar. Also next time I won't leave the limes in the soda, after a half hour or so it started tasting of lime peel. Thanks for the recepie!

I hate to give this recipe such a bad rating, but I must. This was NOT a good recipe. I would have to recommend people to try a different one. It had a limey tang that left my mouth bitter. After adding about another two cups of sugar, I added apple juice. It tasted a better, but it still left a soury-bitter taste in my mouth. It also had absolutely no mint, though I used mint leaves from our backyard and didn't know how much "1/2 a bunch" was. I hate to give it a such a bad review, but I was very upset after slaving over it for half an hour and getting what I got.

the first time I made this it wasn't very good it was too sweet and it took forever using a muddler so the next time I made it I coarsely blended the lime juice, strawberries and mint then added half the sugar and carbonated water and it was delicious

Can't wait to have this on a hot summer day. I'm not a mint fan so I left that out.  I used 2 1/2 cups soda water and used 1/2 cup splenda and 1/2 cup tap water to make a simple syrup. Absolutely yummy!!!

This is great for summer get togethers. We didn't add quite as much sugar just because the strawberry and mint actually gives it a nice flavor all on its own. Otherwise we didn't change the recipe.
