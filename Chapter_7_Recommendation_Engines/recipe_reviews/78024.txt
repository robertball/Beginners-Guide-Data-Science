Absolutely yummy!!  It is a perfect salad for a light summer meal.  We made it with turkey burgers and iced tea.  I followed the recipe exactly and it is really good.  Next time I might try adding some dried cranberries.  Thanks so much ~ we love it!!!!

Very different from the ordinary. My company emptied the entire bowl. I added dried cranberries and added 2 teas. agave nectar to the dressing. Wonderful......

I was so glad to find this recipe here.  I've had it for years  (probably got it from a USA Weekend supplement to my newspaper), but lost my recipe card.  This makes a very pretty, very healthy, very tasty salad!  Great for summer potlucks.

This was really delicious and different. Don't add the walnuts until just before serving, and make sure to toast them. \it makes a big differnce in the taste. Thanks!

Wow! This is totally delicious. Toasting the walnuts gives it great flavor. I used great northern beans instead of cannelini because they were cheaper. :) Having it for dinner tonight and I think I'm going to have to sneak in another serving.

So good! We used a good quality balsamic the second time and it made all the difference. So fast and easy with wonderful results.

This has every element of the best kind of recipe: it's inexpensive, very healthy, tasty, quick, and makes lots!  I first clipped this recipe years ago out of a newspaper.  It fell apart when I went to make it last week, so I came to allrecipes and here it was.  It's just great.

It's an odd combination of tastes. I'm not sure that it's something my family favors.

The flavor is great - so it got 4 stars. But it is SO HEALTHY too, it got the extra point. We will be eating this regularly. Thanks for a great recipe.

Lovely and simple salad. A balanced dish considering the fruit, vegetables and beans included. I would adhere to the amount of cabbage cited. I used too much and lost some of the flavor.

I too found this recipe years ago in Parade magazine, and lost it. Great to find here. My family loves it, and over the years I have done different things. We've had it twice this month -- dead of winter in NJ -- and it's actually fabulous for the winter too. I used real clementines instead of canned mandarins, and have used black beans when I didn't have whites on hand. It is still delicious  & so dang healthy!

I decided to try this recipe for a 4th of July event because I had all the ingredients.   I followed it verbatim except I doubled the recipe.  I tasted it before I took it, but it was too late.  It tasted like  mush.  I had used my processor to sherd the cabbage, so it was tiny bits.  Maybe if I had shredded the cabbage by hand with a knife.

I make this for the Holidays.....so good for you (vegetables and fiber). The only change I made was to use White Balsamic Vinegar instead of the dark.

I used all the dressing.  I should have used to taste.
