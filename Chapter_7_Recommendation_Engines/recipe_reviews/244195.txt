I guess I expected more from this with the chorizo.  It was fair.  I had to use an extra egg since it was pretty dense while mixing.  Maybe there are too many bread crumbs and they tone down the flavor?  Don't know.

This was absolutely delicious.  A real change from "regular" meatloaf.  I followed the recipe exactly and used Johnsonville Chorizo.  This is a fairly firm chorizo so I broke it up and swirled it in my food processor for a few seconds.  Mixed other ingredients in and baked.  Wow this was great.  Will definitely make again.  Thanks so much for the recipe

My family said this is the best meat loaf they ever had.  
“‘Nough said”.
