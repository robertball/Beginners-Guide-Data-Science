I made this bread to go with my cajun-themed Valentine's Day dinner.  As an amateur bread-maker, I found the assembly directions were easy to follow and the bread tasted great.  I made this in my KA and added an extra 1/2 cup of flour and a tsp or so of the Creole Seasoning Blend from this site (to marry the flavors of the meal).  This bread made a great centerpiece for our table ... while it lasted!  I can't wait to try it with other animal shapes.

I made this last weekend to go with my zoo themed meal.  It tasted great and it made it so simple to have my bread machine do the mixing.  Next time I will try to get my dough a bit stickier, I think.  The parts didn't quite grow together and the eyes fell off, but I think with practice it will turn out better.  I just stuck it together with toothpicks  and it looked fine.  :)  I've never even made a regular Italian bread before, so I'm happy to have this recipe for a simple loaf.
