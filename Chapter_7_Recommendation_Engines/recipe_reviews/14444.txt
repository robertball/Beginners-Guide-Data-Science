I added the picture.  My recipe has carrots, which were cooked with the turnips, and I didn't peel the apples.  The first time I made it as written, but it was just so bland looking, but it wasn't bland.  Quite delicious.  I did cut the sugar by half.

I needed a recipe for turnips and this turned out great.  My husband liked it and didn't even know it had turnips in it until I told him.  I added less than half the sugar that the recipe called for and it was still surprising sweet and tangy!

I thought turnips were just for stews.  Then they showed up in my farm share and in 90 degree weather, I just wasn't in a stew mood!  This attracted me for its uniqueness.  It was amazingly delicious!  The family loved it .  I mentioned it to coworkers, so then had to bring them some to taste--it was inhaled!  Can't wait for a potluck so I can make this and surprise everyone!

I made this with Splenda instead of sugar and with half the oil. It was delicious.

This was surprisingly good!  You'll never believe it has turnips when you taste it...so it's a great
way to get rid of summer turnips.  :)

I've never had turnips before and got 2 from a co-op. I wanted a summer friendly dish. Not sure what size the turnips should be but I had a med, & large one and it seemed to be the right amount for the recipe. I added 2 more slices of pineapple & reduced the sugar.  I thought it was a unique, good salad for the summer.

This is a great use of turnips. I used 1/2 the sugar and added 3 tablespoon of greek yogurt and a 1/4 teaspoon of red pepper flakes.

I have never been a fan of turnips but had some I wanted to use.  This recipe was delicious and has turned me into a fan of turnips.  Will definitely make this again.  I did add carrots with the turnips as I cooked them. We do not like soft, mushy vegetables so only cooked them about 10-15 minutes.  Thank you for this recipe.

This is very tasty recipe (I also had too many turnips from my farm share and needed to find something to do with them). However next time I think I would use less oil and add a little white vinegar to up the tangy factor. I also followed others advice to cut the sugar in half and I agree with that. I'll experiment and make this again!

I made this exactly as directed and took it to a Church dinner. I came home with an empty bowl. I love this recipe. Thank You Cathy.
