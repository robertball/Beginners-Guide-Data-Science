Way less salt and pepper, no cayenne
Italian breadcrumbs, (I had no dried thyme)
No bacon, simply as we'd had bacon for breakfast same day
Pan fried.
Moist, tasty, and different.  
Will make again.

Boy, what a hit!  So easy to make but so flavorful.  I came home from work with nothing to eat.  I had bought some hamburger meat a day or two ago and I thought I would do something different with it than "just a burger".  Of course, when I found Chef John's  recipe, I knew it would be good!  I was able to put it together quickly and served it to my wife (who is not a meatloaf fan) and son.  It was a smash hit.  Thanks for making me look good.

What an excellent burger recipe.  Very tasty and definitely different than the standard burger.  Everyone enjoyed it.

Made this for a cookout that was cancelled so I froze them. I'm not a fan of burgers cooked inside in a skillet but I did just that and LOVED them!  WOW!  Love the great flavor!  This is now my go-to recipe for burgers!  Thanks Chef John!

Like many recipes this one can be tweaked successfully. Today I’m making it with ground elk instead of beef. It’s my go-to burger recipe.

I have not made this yet but I totally loved the video for this recipe and will give this a try  as my experiment trying to do something similar failed. My experiment tasted good though and I just chopped it all up and called it meatloaf sloppy joes haha
I was actually looking for a recipe to help me figure out how to make meatloaf burgers that weren't so moist that it wouldn't hold together and I'm guess maybe not as much moisture as there would be in an actual meatloaf. My oven doesn't work atm so I was experimenting with trying to make the mix into burgers and frying them, but it was so moist that they broke apart so yeah I failed.

Also used jalapeno ketchup for extra heat.....guess I will have to try again because it was just a pretty ordinary burger to me.

Just made this recipe. Oh my lord it's amazing!! The sweet maple bacon and jalapeño ketchup I used gave it the perfect flavor. A must try!
