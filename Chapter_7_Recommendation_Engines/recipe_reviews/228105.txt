I had a small piece of a Smithfield ham slice in the fridge, so I scaled down the recipe and made some for lunch today using my little chopper attachment that came with my immersion blender.  Be careful when you're scooping out the center of the cuke because it's pretty easy to go right through it.  Good idea though, you could fill them with any number of things, and both yellow squash and zucchini would work, too.  This is bit like curried ham salad (the curry flavor does not dominate), and the flavor was unexpected.  Nice finger food with good presentation.

4 stars for the great idea.  But I used the recipe on this site for "Ham Salad Spread" that includes finely diced celery, sweet pickle relish and chopped hardboiled eggs.

Used leftover Costco ham that had been braised in a sweet orange sauce. To save time, I just cut the cucumber in slices and put a scoop of the filling on top. So good and so simple and quick!

Tihis is soooo good! I added more mustard and less mayo so it wasnt as sweet. Served with cucumbers and crackers.
