Essentially this recipe is a classic.Tasty summertime salad or side dish - EXCEPT for the MAYONNAISE. Too heavy. Try  it with a vinaigrette.

I agree with Mike. The mayo seemed bland.  A vinaigrette would have given the beet salad more pazazze. I added 1 Tbsp. each of fresh Lime juice & Lemon juice. I may add a bit more or some vinegar. I think the beets taste best just cooked and sliced.
