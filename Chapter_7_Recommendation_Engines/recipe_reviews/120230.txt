I give them a five star because I used skim milk instead of buttermilk and at first the batter was very thin, but the pancakes turned out so fluffy! If they are fluffy with skim milk imagine what they'd be with buttermilk or whole milk. I added mashed banana to the batter and it was good, but I think I'll just have it was cut up banana on top. This is a keeper.

Hearty. I added a small amount of brown sugar, a few dashes of cinnamon and a teaspoon of ground flaxseed.

I found this recipe here when I couldn't
find my recipe for Oatmeal Pancakes.

This recipe was...tasty but it seemed like there was something missing. It made seven medium pancakes which was just enough for my husband and two sons. The buttermilk was a nice touch (I soured whole milk with vinegar, as buttermilk is a little pricey for a one time use.) and I added a teaspoon of 
pumpkin pie spice and a 1/4 tsp. of salt.
My husband mentioned that it would be
more like apple cinnamon oatmeal with
chopped apples, so I plan on adding 
some next time that have been tossed
with a sugar/cinnamon mixture. I plan
on working with this a couple more times
to suit my family's tastes. Good base
recipe.

If I could rate this recipe higher, I would !  They were so tasty!  My DH and I made these for breakfast for our family this morning and the end result was so good.  We doubled the recipe and it made 11 pancakes (using 1/3 cup as a measuring tool).  The only thing we changes was to use whole milk instead of buttermilk (we didn't have any on hand); we used 2 Tbsp of sugar and about 1/2 tsp salt. My DH suggested that next time we should use brown sugar for added flavour, and I agree.  I also think that a bit of cinnamon would go a long way in this recipe.  For an added twist, I expect that I will also add some mashed banana or raisins at some point when I make these again as I expect they will become a regular occurrence in our house.  Thanks for a great recipe!

These pancakes were really delightful. I used wheat flour instead of all-purpose, and they still turned out great. We ate them with butter and preserves - yum. My husband (who doesn't really like pancakes) asked me to make these again before we were even finished with the meal :D *After many months of enjoying these, I think the best feature is how tasty they are without being sweet, which is my husband's complaint with most other pancakes...

With Diabetes in the household and a gastric bypass - I'm looking for complex carb turnarounds of solid favorites.  

Like others, I used a stone ground whole wheat flour, 1/4 teaspoon salt - and more sugar -- except that we are a splenda household these days - so I substituted straight splenda for the white sugar (2 Tablespoons) and 1 1/2 teaspoons of the splenda brown sugar blend. (equivelent of 1 Tablespoon of regular br. sugar)  I also added a half dead banana that was in need of a purpose.  With the addition of the banana - I quickly discovered that it needed a serious boost in leavening -- and added a half teaspoon of baking powder as well as the soda already in the recipe.  We like our pancakes light and fluffy.  This did the trick.  Topped with some sugar free syrup - and Log Cabin seems to have the best flavor - it was a healthy makeover.  Also, I recommend to everyone - keep buttermilk in the house.  When it's called for, even sour milk doesn't quite give the recipe the same kick.

Mmmmmmm...Delicious. I must say though that I did change a couple things. Only had old-fashioned oats, vegetable oil instead of butter, added a pinch of cinnamon, little extra baking powder, little brown sugar, and about 2 tbls. sour cream to skim milk since we had no buttermilk. Very yummy with blueberries. Thank you for a healthier alternative to regular pancakes.

This gets 4 stars with the changes that I made. The changes I made were: used whole wheat flour instead of all-purpose, added cinnamon, added walnuts and added about a 1/4 tsp of salt. This was a very nutty, hearty, and delicious pancake but don't forget to add the salt to help bring out all the flavors otherwise it will be a very plain and boring pancake.

Very tasty, light, and a nice, basic recipe (no food-processing the oats, no seperating the eggs, etc) Perfect for the two of us.

These pancakes are delicious AND filling! I doubled the recipe and added 3/4 cup mini chocolate chips and a teaspoon of vanilla extract. No more boxed pancake mix for us! My 9 year old son asked if I would make this recipe again!

I wanted to like this recipe, but it turned out horribly. I started out with the batter made exactly as written and after the first two paper thin pancakes I added another 1/2 cup flour and a 1/2 tsp. baking powder to come up with something resembling pancake batter. They didn't taste bad, but they definitely looked more like crepes than pancakes. Thanks anyway.

Winning taste & texture!  I actually use blackstrap molasses in place of sugar, and a mixture of butter & coconut oil for the 3 T's of butter.  Also, if you get in a jam and don't have buttermilk, just put 1 T of vinegar (plain or apple cider) in a cup measure & fill to the top with regular milk; let sit while you put together rest of ingredients, then add to make batter.  This "sours" the milk.  Works like a charm.  Thanks!

These were very good.  I made these for just my daughter and me.  If my husband was eating, I would have had to double the recipe.  They had such good flavor and I like that there is more oatmeal than flour - gives it some nutritional value.  I added some sliced bananas onto the tops of the pancakes in the pan before I flipped them and that made them nice and sweet.

I love the pancakes - although, I had to make a few alterations.  I didn't have buttermilk, so I used 2% milk. I didn't have any baking soda, so I used baking powder and added some salt.  The pancakes still came out fluffy and had a good taste.  I also added 2 mashed bananas and some cinnamon.  I will try it again but this time I will add the buttermilk, to see if it will be better.  

I do recommend that people make this it is really good.

These were alright.  The only changes I made were 1) used whole wheat and 2) instead of using buttermilk I added 1 tbs vinegar to about 1 C. skim milk.  The batter was reaaallly runny (maybe my fault for using skim) & the pancakes just sort of tasted eggy & bland.  However, I appreciate the healthy alternative.

Exactly what I was craving when I thought of oatmeal pancakes. I added a tab of sugar and a tab of brown sugar, used whole wheat flour, and added a few shakes of cinnamon and salt just to boost the flavor a bit. Good over all!

Good.  Needs a dash of salt.  Also, the batter should sit a bit or the oatmeal has too much crunch.

These were very good!  I was looking for a whole grain base recipe to make yogurt pancakes, so I substituted yogurt for the buttermilk.  I also added a bit of brown sugar instead of white and let the mixture sit for 10 min or so before cooking to let the baking soda react with the yogurt.  Thanks!

These pancakes taste like an "old fashioned" pancake.  I didn't have quick oats, so I used regular, and I didn't have buttermilk, so I soured some whole milk. I used smart balance oil instead of butter. I also added a little cinnamon and vanilla like some of the other users suggested.  Good heart healthy recipe.

These were really good.  My husband and I truly enjoyed them.  I did not have all purpose flour, so I substituted bread flour.  I used nonfat buttermilk and increased the sugar to 1 1/2 tsp.  The more I ate them, the better they tasted.  They were very hearty and yummy.  I tried plain and with molasses and brown sugar syrup.  I ate the majority without any syrup, but the brown sugar syrup was very nice with these pancakes.

I am soooo impressed with these pancakes, they are delicious! I find that with most other oatmeal pancake recipes the batter becomes far too thick and difficult to form into thin pancakes. This recipe however was perfect; the batter was the perfect consistency and the pancakes turned out great. I tried substituting half the liquid with 7-up as I saw on a cooking show and it helped make them wonderfully fluffy! I will most definitely be making these again!

We really enjoyed these! If you don't have buttermilk, you can use 1 T. vinegar in a 1 cup measuring cup, then pour milk to make a complete cup. Let stand for 5 minutes.  These were hearty and very tasty. We loved the oat taste! We did add 1/4 t. salt and about 2 T. brown sugar and poured by the 1/4 cup. Great recipe!

I was looking for a recipe to use up some leftover buttermilk and I came across this recipe.  I was a little short on the amount of buttermilk I had but I just added some 2% milk to the buttermilk to make up the difference.  I was also a little short on the amount of quick cooking oats to I added some regular oats.  Even though I had to make these changes the pancakes were delicous.  I will be making this recipe over and over again.

This was exactly what I was looking to make. I used whole milk instead of buttermilk and added a smidge more flour. Let the mixture stand for a bit maybe 10 minutes before baking to let oats soak up mixture then added chocolate chips right before I cooked them. They were perfect! Topped with a little peanut butter and syrup! Daughter ate it all up!

Loved this!! I used Unsweetened Vanilla Almond Milk instead of regular milk, whole wheat flour, a mashed banana and added cinnamon as per the other reviewers on here. I topped them with a coconut peanut butter (North Shore Goodies...yum) and fresh mango and blueberries. These tasted so healthy and were absolutely delicious. Next time I think I'll leave out the egg and add a little more baking soda, they almost fit the whole foods diet we're trying out. Definitely a new favorite.

I thought they were good, but my husband did not like them at all. My kids (toddler and preschooler) did not like them much either. The only thing I deviated from the recipe on was using regular milk instead of buttermilk.

We found it was better to let the batter sit so the oats could soak up the moisture. The batter was a little thin because we used skim milk. Recipe was really good with bananas and chocolate chips.

These turned out great! I doubled the recipe and made it with water as we are milk intolerant in our house. My son said "these are great mom! They're better than regular pancakes! Can you make them every time?" So I guess that means they are a hit. My hubby wasn't as convinced but he enjoyed them :)

The batter was not thick enough, had to add more flour.  Also needs a bit of salt.  I really did like the oatmeal in this, so I'll try again using less milk and adding some standard pancake add-ins (blueberry, walnut, vanilla etc)

Meh. I followed the recipe exactly save for adding cinnamon and the batter was soup. I had to add an extra quarter cup of flour to get it to the proper consistency to actually cook which made them bland.  I will not be remaking these.

My substitutions are the only reason I don't rate this 5 stars - I just don't think it's fair to rate something a 5 if you've made significant enough changes. That said, this was an excellent base recipe! My subs: whole wheat flour instead of all-purpose, added a tad more sugar, added about 1/2 tsp brown sugar, used almond milk in place of buttermilk. Also ended up using 1/2 quick oats and 1/2 old-fashioned oats because I didn't have enough quick, and I messed with the proportions just a bit because I needed 3 servings, but I didn't increase by much and we had plenty! They were absolutely delicious!

I tried this recipe and it really does make delicious, nutritious pancakes. Instead of regular milk, I substituted with almond milk, and I used 2 Tablespoons of Best Life buttery spread instead of 3 T of butter. I calculated the calories and found that if you divide this recipe into 10 small-medium pancakes, each pancake will be about 75 calories.

I was a little skeptical in the beginning but I loved these pancakes! I've been trying to eat more oatmeal and this is a fun and tasty way to do it. The only modifications I made were out of necessity due to the bareness of my kitchen right now so I'm not going to mention them. Besides, I have faith that the recipe would be great as written. These pancakes taste nutty and have texture and are just delightful. They are filling tho so a small recipe goes a long way. I love it! Thank you so much!

These were good but missing just a little something.  I soaked the oats in the buttermilk for almost an hour to soften the oats and also added ½ teaspoon of vanilla.  I think it could have used a pinch of salt, a little cinnamon, and perhaps brown sugar to make it great.  However, it was a good and healthy pancake.

We, too, added a dash of salt and replaced sugar with brown sugar, increasing to 1 Tbsp.
Excellent, tasty, slightly chewy with the oats.  Yum!

I love oatmeal and pancakes and was pleased to read about how oatmeal pancakes were a healthy combination of the two. Other recipes call for a food processor to grind the oatmeal into a flour, and this one proves you don't need that to produce delicious, fluffy pancakes! Simple recipes, great results.

Used 1 percent milk instead of buttermilk. Added cinnamon, vanilla & ground flax seed. I thought the pancakes were very dense! I love pancakes and I love oatmeal but I'm not sold on the combination! The center definitely had an oatmeal texture, nothing like a pancake center!

3 stars for this one. I may have to make these again and adjust the rating, because I have a feeling I left out the flour! Phone kept ringing, reviews speak of watery batter, and I just couldn't remember if I put it in.  They didn't fluff quite like I expected, though I added 2 Tblsp flour to the last half of batter, and they looked better.  They shouldn't have such ragged edges, so maybe next time will be better. *************************************Okay -- husband and son like them, so I'm moving it to 4 stars.

Easy and the best, I just added a little vanilla and cinnamon. No more searching for the perfect pancake!

Fabulous!  Everyone is correct is saying that adding a bit of cinnamon makes all the difference.  My husband loved these, they are not too sweet.  Easy, quick, and going to be one of my go-to recipes from now on.

I really like these... very easy to make... I used 1% milk, 1 mashed banana, sunflower oil instead of melted butter, and 1 packet vanilla sugar. And served with pure maple syrup !  Yummy !

Excellent and easy - I added some cinnamon and chopped banana and used whole wheat flour. My husband didn't even know they were good for you and loved them with peanut butter!

This recipe was okay.  It was a bit weird to me to have lumpy oats in my pancakes.  It would be better if the oats were ground up, perhaps.  I also thought the batter was a bit thin.  I prefer thick, fluffy pancakes rather than thin ones.  I definitely think that the recipe Oatmeal Pancakes II is WAY better if you want oats in your pancakes.  Oh, but one good thing I'll say about this recipes is that it is VERY easy to make.

This has become our Sunday morning staple!  This is delicious as listed, but since we eat them so often we make several modifications to make it healthier, saving the full-fledged version for special occasions.

*Replace white flour with whole wheat.

*Switch out buttermilk with 1/2 the amount of skim milk and the other 1/2 applesauce.

*Add cinnamon and vanilla.

It's great on its own or with fruit.  Our favorite variations are blueberry or peanut butter-banana.

I love oatmeal pancakes and like trying new recipes all the time but this one made thin runny pancakes. They were tasty but it seemed like it was too much milk but it might have been my oats, I used rolled oats instead of quick-cooking. I think I'll just stick to the 'Oatmeal Pancakes II' recipe on this site, I like that one much more.

I double the recipe and it generally yields 15 - 16 delicious cakes. These are some of the tastiest pancakes I have ever had. Our kids also love them. Our daughter has never liked oatmeal pancakes and she says these are the best!

Had a taste for pancakes this morning, but not just regular pancakes. I liked the simplicity of this recipe and felt like I can adjust it to what I had.  So I ended up with a gluten free & dairy free version of this. It was delicious and perfect - I used a gluten-free all purpose flour by pamela's product, used almond milk instead and added 1/4 tsp of salt & a tsp of cinnamon.  Kept all the other measurements as is.  I can't even imagine how delish it would taste with butter milk.  Can't wait to make it again and add mashed bananas to it or some fresh fruits.  Good basic recipe.

Loved this recipe.  I used skim instead of whole and topped it off with strawberries and bananas.  My fiance didn't realize it wasn't regular pancakes.

I thought these pancakes were pretty bland when I tasted the first one. I looked back at the recipe and realized it didn't call for any salt, so I added some salt and some extra sugar at the last minute, and they turned out all right.

My kids loved these which in and of itself makes it a 5 star recipe.  I chose this recipe because of the short list of ingredient required, added blueberries and they were great.  Perfect for feeding the kids a homecooked breakfast on a school day.

Quick, easy and delicious.  Those three alone give it 3 stars at least in my book and then an extra star because I would definitely make this again.  I used old-fashioned rolled oats (because that's what I use to make oatmeal) and just let the batter sit for 10-15 minutes or so after I mixed with the wet ingredients so the oats could soak up the milk.  I added chocolate chips to the recipe because I didn't have any syrup on hand and can't eat pancakes without something sweet or savory but they would do just fine without chocolate chips.  Next time, I may add some fruit like bananas or blueberries.

Just the recipe I was looking for- I had oatmeal pancakes at a cafe near by and they were delicious- the texture of these pancakes exactly resembles what I had there. I did not have buttermilk on hand- I mixed 2% with 1.5 tablespoons of cider vinegar and added a bit extra flour to thicken it up- if you use whole milk- you probably won't need to add extra flour - the thinner milks make for a thinner "buttermilk" if you are adding acids. Additionally- I used 2 tbls of grape seed oil in place of the butter.

My family and I really liked this recipe, served with applesauce or maple syrup. I didn't have the time to get buttermilk, so mixed light sour cream with milk, and they still worked out. Hearty, tasty, and healthier than white-flour or boxed mix pancakes!

Very filling.  I used whole wheat flour, and only two tablespoons of butter (all I had left).  This recipe could definitely benefit from some salt, as it is just a touch bland, and a little cinnamon never hurt any pancake.  A good place to start, though.

My only change was using Old Fashioned Quaker oats (it's all I buy).  These are excellent! Taste, texture, everything. I have no complaints nor would I make any changes. This is my new go to pancake recipe! Yum!

This recipe was a total surprise to me. I followed the directions and thought the mixture would be a total flop, as it appeared to be thick and on the dry side.  However, the results were delicious. The pancakes themselves were very tasty and satisfying. With a dab of honey on top, I would rate these as one of my current favorites. I have not made anything with buttermilk in a while. I will make them again... and possibly again.

I used 1% Lactaid milk in place of the buttermilk, and margarine in place of the butter.  I also changed the sugar to 1 tablespoon and used brown sugar as suggested here by other commenters.  Wonderful, and so hearty!  They aren't too fluffy, either, which is a pet peeve of mine when it comes to pancakes.

I love these. My new favorite way to make pancakes. Very tasty and feels like more of a breakfast than just regular pancakes.  I add about a tablespoon of brown sugar for a little sweetness.  They do take a little longer to cook than regular pancakes so test one before you pull them off the griddle.

These were really disappointing.  First off, that was WAY too much buttermilk.  I had to add more flour.  They were bland and had no taste.  I will not make these again.

These pancakes were very very good! I did add 1/4 cup of ground flax seed for more fiber and 1 tsp. of cinnamon and 1/4 cup of brown sugar (omitted the white sugar). I tripled the recipe because I fed 4 people and my youngest som loves pancakes for leftovers.

Great way to get the little ones to eat some oatmeal!  I thought it had too much milk - next time will cut it down to at least 3/4 or maybe 2/3 cup, or 1/2 cup with another egg - to give them some more protein.  Added some cinnamon and used about 1/8 cup sugar/Splenda mix, so they would not need so much syrup.  Thanks for a wonderful idea for a nutritious breakfast.

Amazing - I wouldn't change a thing. I'm from the south and these are exactly the same as our favorite restaurant if not better! Everyone should try this recipe! Just be sure to give them a good coating of the breading!

These pancakes had a nice light and fluffy texture.  I like recipes that use buttermilk.  The oats were a nice touch too.  I used a little less butter.  Easy to make!

I made these pancakes substituting one pack of the Weight Control instant oatmeal in maple & brown sugar, eliminated the sugar, used 2% milk, and reduced to just two tablespoons of melted butter.  The batter was thin at first but thickened nicely after resting for about 10 minutes.  The pancakes were delicious!  Moist, fluffy, and with a wonderful oatmeal flavor.  Next time I think I will add 1/4 tsp of salt to balance the flavors, but overall this recipe's a keeper.

Perfect!  My kids did not even notice the oatmeal. This is a good way to help keep your heart healthy.
