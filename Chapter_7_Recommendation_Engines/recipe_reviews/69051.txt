The most delicious, moist gingerbread ever. Just know that I think the author meant 3 eggs instead of 3 Tbs. of eggs.  Excellent recipe.

My husband and I LOVE this recipe and it shrinks/grows well.  I have made it in 1, 2, 4, 6 and 8 loaf batches, and every time it is delicious.  I have subbed honey for molasses in the past and it worked well.  I have also added MORE spice than the recipe calls for and that really bumped it up.
Adding 2x the spice called for, a little nutmeg, and serving with mulled wine or hot apple cider did my guests in at a recent "Christmas in July" party.  Oh yeah, I used pastry flour and that was pretty cool too.
Well done JAWANDMEE!

This was a very easy quick bread to make. I used a variety of pears and put a mixture of brown sugar and raw sugar on top of the bread. I also made mini loafs which are nice to give to the neighbors. They also freeze well. I will certainly make these again.

Best bread ever!!!!!  I love not having to wait for the pears to ripen.  Wonderful flavor.  I made a few changes-applesauce for oil, used 3 eggs, diced pears instead of slicing them, added pecans and baked in mini loaf pans.  Hard to keep around once baked.

I halved the recipe and used canned pears, which I finely diced. I will cut back a little on the ginger next time and definitely cut the salt by half. I prefer other pear bread recipes that don't mask the pear flavor, but this bread is moist and delicious, very much like a spicy gingerbread. Would make an excellent giveaway bread for the holidays.

This bread was easy to make and very moist and tasty.  My 10 year old followed the recipe and she added some golden raisins and walnuts (she has to make everything her own).  The loaves turned out beautifully.

Loved it!  The only thing I did diffent was run the pears through the blender so my kids wouldn't complain about "chunks" in their bread.  They loved it!

Finally a pear bread where I don't have to watch the pears rippen (so difficult to find them just when you want them).   If I am out of molasses I substitute corn syrup which works fine. Thanks for a great addition to my files

This was just ok. I be was expecting it to be a lot more flavorful but it was rather plain tasting without much pear or spice flavor to it. I even added more pear than what was called for, maybe use pear liquor or more spices?

Easier to make than expected! Used mostly organic ingredients which adds more flavor & taste. I was out of brown sugar & used granulated maple sprinkles; 4 small eggs instead of 3 (large) eggs; and spelt flour instead of all-purpose. I baked the 2 small loaves about 40 minutes; the large loaf 1 hr +. Reminds me of bread pudding. This is one of the best online recipes ever and will be a family fave!

the flavor was good but mine just didn't cook for some reason. I cooked it 70 minutes and it was still wet in the middle.

Good recipe! Nice change from traditional banana nut and zucchini breads. Great for the latter holidays! This recipe is very forgiving...and I followed a lot of other suggestions. I used honey instead of molasses (someone said they did), I ran out of brown sugar in the middle of baking and had to use some white sugar to make up the rest, used applesauce instead of oil (someone else also did), AND used 1 cup of whole wheat flour with 2 cups of all purpose. It really turned out great. The recipe is a touch sweet for me personally, but this bread definitely has plenty of spice to it. Will make again for the holidays!

This bread is delicious. The spices made it smell so good while baking, it was the perfect thing for a cool fall day. I made up some honey butter to spread on it, and it was just perfect.

Delicious recipe; I made mini loaves and baked for approx 30 min.  Also added walnuts pressed into the top--will incorporate next time.  Used half whole wheat flour.  Diced pears for more immersion of fruit within the bread.

This is a perfect way to show off your fall pears!  It is a very moist and flavorful bread.  I diced my pears to 1/2" cubes after coring and peeling them to insure even distribution in the bread.  I then dredged them first in the combined dry ingredients before stirring into the wet ingredients mixture.  I finished the recipe as directed.  They took 60 minutes to cook and are a hit with our family and friends.  With such a moist "plummy" bread, I chose to wrap it in foil and store in my refrigerator.  I serve it cut into 2" slices topped with fresh whipped cream. You can choose to heat the slices in the microwave before topping with either vanilla ice cream or fresh whipped cream.

Bake muffins for 30-35 minutes.

Thanks for giving my bread such rave reviews! I'm glad others like it as much as I do. Yes, it is supposed to read 3 whole eggs, not 3 tablespoons of eggs. I wonder if that can be changed on the recipe. Happy baking!

Delicious!  Moist!  Spicy!  Everything a sweet bread should be.  My grocery store didn't have D'Anjou pears that particular day so I used Bosc pears.  Like most quick breads, this one freezes well.

I make this every year. I puree my 4 large pears and then add a few chunks of pear to the batter. It is wonderful. I use home canned pears and it is so good. People ask for the recipe all the time.

These were okay as muffins... not quite as moist as I like. Maybe it would be better if the pears were grated instead of diced?

I only had two pears so I added a grated apple to fill the void and it turned out just fine. Moist and delicious!

Super delicious.  People ask for this recipe.  Freezes well, too.  Would be nice to have on hand for a gift or unexpected company.

Really great recipe - definitely works as a dessert offering, too.  I served it at a dinner party with Hagen Daaz vanilla, and people loved it.  I also subbed GF flour, and the recipe worked beautifully.  I always recommend using the freshest spices you can and the best quality.  I ground allspice and clove fresh for this, and there's no doubt it made a difference.

Eating this bread is like eating candy!  It tastes delicious even though I substituted half the all-purpose flour with whole wheat flour.  Such a good breakfast loaf.

Wonderfully moist & tender.  The molasses is not overbearing & the spices are perfect.  This is a fantastic recipe, I wouldn't change a thing.  This will go on my comfort food list!
