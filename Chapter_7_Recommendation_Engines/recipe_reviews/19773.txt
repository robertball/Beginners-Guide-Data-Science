Very, Very Tasty!!  I'm surprised that no one else has rated or reviewed this recipe yet.
Instead of grating the zucchini which would produce a soggy glob, I used the multi-holed shredder side of my 4 sided grater--worked perfectly.  I then followed the ingredients and directions as given.  I packed it tightly into a 1 pint wide mouth mason jar--with only a slight bit not fitting--and then refrigerated it overnight.  Today, for lunch, I grilled a burger and used some of the relish on it.  Absolutely delicious.  I am already thinking of other ways that I can incorporate this great flavor and texture into other dishes.  Thanks much, Sara, for publishing this recipe.

I made this relish yesterday, and tasted it today. I am not familiar with canning or making my own relish, having never done it before, so I gave this the benefit of the doubt by giving it two stars. This was not good at all, it just tasted like lime juice with a bit of cilantro. Will not make it again.

I made this yesterday but I let the zucchini rest prior to makeing to rid it of most of the water.  I kicked it up a notch bu adding red and green peppers diced along with thinly sliced red onion.  It added colour as well as enhanced the taste.  I sampled this AM to ensure it was OK to serve for a BBQ this evening and for me it is a go Hopefully all will enjoy.  Don't be afraid the enhance recipes It is amazing what you come up with

I made this yesterday.  I expected it to be crunchy and tangy, but it was soft and mushy. Sorry, but I didn't like it, although I love limes and zucchini. I gave it two stars for the ones who do like it and the ones who may want to try it.

Quick & easy, but I may have added too much cilantro-it was quite strong the first day.  Also, the zucchini tends to get softer/mushier as time goes on.  But very tasty, and an alternative way to use your zucchini!

The taste is a little bland and it does get mushy after awhile.  I probably will not make this recipe again.

I make this every Summer with cookouts, I add a bit of sweet onion and a bit of crushed garlic.  It is a great added item on the table for hot dogs and burgers, Have fun!

So I made some changes, of course.  More of this, less of that...
Put it in the fridge for a week. Popped the top tonight to go with BBQ ham steak, drool.
