This was very bland to us.  I ended up pouring it into my slow cooker adding a can of Italian tomatoes, tomato paste, chicken bouillon, a couple of teaspoons of Italian seasoning, pinch of brown sugar, more garlic and about 1 1/2 cups of pasta I had on hand.  This recipe is a good place to start but really needed so much tweaking that it became a whole different recipe.  I am glad I started this meal early in the day as my plans were to cook it, put in the frig until dinner time because tomato based soups normally taste better the longer the flavors mingle but as it turned out the slow cooker worked well after all the additions.  Didn't add the pasta until the last 15 minutes and put cheese in the bottom of the bowl before laddling the soup.

This was a very easy and quick meal.  I added 6 oz of tortellini, 1 small can of roasted garlic tomato sauce and half a bag of baby spinach at the end of the cooking time.  I did think that it needed a little more depth of flavor, so I would add more garlic and maybe some tomato paste, and see if that did the trick.

This recipe is fantastic - very unique - great flavor! I adjusted it just a bit by adding 2 small cans of tomato paste to thicken the mixture and I also added an extra clove of garlic and extra fresh basil before simmering. I served it over cheese tortillini (which was a suggestion from another review) but any other small shaped pasta will do.  This will definitely be a favorite for my family!

This does taste a lot like lasagna, with a mild flavor.  The feta is very important.  It went over well at my house.  I made this during the winter, froze individual servings and pulled them out for lunch.  The soup was delicious and I always looked forward to it.

This soup is very hearty and delicious!  The only thing I would do different would be add a little more salt and maybe some extra garlic.  More feta could never hurt either!  Great soup for a cold day!

I forget how I changed the seasonings. I tend to get carried away. It makes a great sauce if you have any leftover.

This was really good.  I added everything in a crock pot and cooked it all day so that it would ready when I got home from work.  I added a can of tomatoe paste.  I think it needs something else.  It just didn't have that WOW factor.  I will make it again but I will experiment until I come up with the missing ingrediant.  I think maccaroni noodles will be good.  I also think beef broth.

I thought this recipe was just ok.  I added some noodles to it to try to make it more substantial, but it turned out to be more a pasta dish than soup...

This recipe is very easy to make.  I followed the recipe exactly this first time I made it, and I wasn't all that impressed with the taste.  Perhaps it would be better after playing around with the recipe.

Great soup!  Very tasty and filling!  All I added was a can of tomato paste and some elbow macaroni.  Definitely needed a pasta of some kind.  A hit with the kids.

We decided to have an Italian potluck yesterday at my sister's before taking the kids to our annual trip of watching a million Christmas lights in the forest.    Let me tell you, this is one of the best soups I have ever had (I am a huge soup fan).  They added tortellini to theirs.  The colors and flavors were fantastic.  We all said it was like getting restaurant quality soup at home.  They were worried about the 5 cups of water, but the feta sure made the difference.  Awesome recipe!  I can't wait to eat the leftovers today and make it myself!

Easy, quick and delicious.  Could also use as a base for many combinations of meats, vegetables and pastas.

We made this for dinner tonight and it was really good and so easy to make!  We used baby portabella mushrooms and included brown rice.  We also added Italian seasoning as well as Cajun seasoning and hot sauce.  We prefer our food spicy!

After reading that this recipe needed some tweaking flavor-wise I went ahead and subbed Johnsonville Mild Italian Sausage for the ground beef.  I also added a handful of mozzarella in addition to the feta, onion and garlic powders, and a little italian seasoning.  The sausage definitely kicked it up a notch, what a great soup!

It was okay, but nothing spectacular.
