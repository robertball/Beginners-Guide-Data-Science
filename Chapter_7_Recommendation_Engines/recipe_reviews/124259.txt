This dish is of the utmost pasta salad dishes. Tasty, and deliciously divine. Sensational flavors and fluids. Awakens my senses and relaxes my mind. If you didn't like pasta salad before, your not a voice in the dark. Try this mouth-gasmic dish. You will never eat potato salad again.

This has become one of my favorite salads by now. Instead of using just mayo and sour cream i started using ranch as well. The three combined definitely taste amazing.
Also, since I don't like zucchini that much, I sometimes substitute it with cucumber or do half of each, which gives it an even fresher taste.
yummy

What a crisp fresh salad!  I omitted the onions since I hate raw onions, I added some roasted red pepper and some ranch seasoning, and I mean good!  My 6 year old would not eat vegetables for anything. I peeled the zucchini and he thought they were potatoes!  He ate every last piece. Defeniately making again!

This is not an extraordinary pasta salad, but it's a decent, basic pasta salad, flexible for adding, omitting or changing to please different taste buds, to use favorite ingredients or to make use of those on hand.  Simple ingredients make for a safe crowd-pleaser - there's nothing here for people to turn their noses up at.  I added celery (Hubs would have missed it had I not) and some halved cherry tomatoes for color and interest.  I just added all else to taste rather than strictly measuring.  Knowing how pasta absorbs moisture,  I added a good glug of heavy cream to ensure it stayed creamy.

This is a simple, fresh pasta salad - just what I was looking for. I made it for a family birthday event where my sister-in-law - who claims not to like pasta salad - had three helpings. Thanks for this recipe.

This was wonderful!  I like a lot of veggies, so I used 2 zucchini, and also added a chopped red bell pepper.  Instead of onion, I used green onion - just a personal preference.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was very good - I cut back on the dill and added about a tsp. of dry ranch dressing mix.  I like the combination of mayonnaise (I used a canola oil based one) and sour cream - I've done that in potato salads, but never in pasta salads until now and it's a nice touch.  I also added some thawed frozen peas and chopped cucumber.   Colorful and delicious, this one was a real winner.

This was really easy to make and very tasty.  I only used 1 teaspoon of dill but that is just me.  I'd made it for a Stella and Dot party and a few people asked for the receipe. :O)

My sister-in-law made this for Easter.  She used bow-tie pasta instead of spiral.  It was really good.  I think the whole family enjoyed it.

This a GREAT recipe. The only thing I do different is use tri-colored veggie pasta. I also add cubed all natural cheddar cheese and this slices of salami! ENJOY!!!!

Very easy and good. Not over the top, but definitely a picnic standard. Although I thought it sounded like a lot of olives, don't skimp. They add a nice saltiness.

This was pretty yummy!  I was looking for a pasta salad that was different from the typical italian dressing base.  I did not add the olives (personal tastes) but I did add a bit of cubed salami and cheese.  I also cut back on the dill and added a few chopped green onions.  We will be making this again.

Super good and a big hit. Fortunalty I ate some after I made it since it was completely gone by the time I made it to the luncheon. Since I had a nice cucumber and capers I tossed those in too. I will make this again.

I loved this! It was so quick and easy to make. I used Ranch salad dressing, and broccoli but left out the garlic. It was even better the second day.

Amazing.... I was looking for a pasta salad to take camping and I am glad I chose this one. I did tweak it a bit. I used half Miracle Whip and half Mayo used a ton of olives but it came out great. Thanks for a super recipe.

I was looking for a pasta salad to prepare ahead of time to take on a weekend camping trip. This was exactly what I was hoping to find. Easy, absolutely delicious and it held up perfectly in a cooler with ice. I just pulled it out at every meal and it was a wonderful sidedish. I will make it over and over again. Thanks Vicki!

My family and I really liked this pasta salad.  With the dill and sour cream, it's a different type than we normally make and it was a really nice change.  I will be making it again this summer for sure!

Delicious!  Instead of 2 cups of pasta I cooked the whole 1 pound box.  I did NOT make more dressing as it was enough to make a pasta salad wet but not too wet.
