This sauce is more creamy than zesty but still good. I didn't add salt because I used salted butter however I did followe the method as written. It is a bit runny. I suggest seeding the tomatoes first. I ended up cooking on the stove top after an hour in the oven. Thank you chefsquig for your recipe.

I used frozen Roma tomatoes from the garden. Easy, tasty but runny so Iâ€™m now finishing on stove top. May add tomato paste? And a little honey?

WAY too much salt! I had to add a can of tomato paste and a can of tomato sauce just to tone down the saltiness.
