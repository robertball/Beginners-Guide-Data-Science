I give this recipe a 5-star by experience.... I have made these treats for years..... but let me give you a tip or 2 to make it easier:
1. Use chocolate WAFERS, not Kisses.  Wafers are chocolate discs, sold in a bag specifically for making candy - no need to unwrap!  You can buy them from craft stores like AC Moore (in many different colors!) or from grocery stores that sell bulk foods.
2. Spread out the pretzels, a wafer balanced on top of each one, on a cookie sheet so they are not touching - no need for aluminum foil.
3. I put mine in a 250 oven for 10 minutes.... a little longer & cooler than written here, but it's really important to make the chocolate SOFT, but NOT melted!
4. Press the M&M down enough to make the softened choc. wafter hug the pretzel... then let it cool COMPLETELY!  (If it doesn't, the chocolate will fall off when you move it.) I like to make several cookie trays full right before bed, then leave them sit out on the counter overnight & put away in the am.
*They are wonderful holiday treats!  I have made red & green ones at Christmas, ones in school colors for a graduation party, and at Easter: use pretzel snaps (looks like a basket weave), green wafers (like Easter grass), & egg-shaped M&M's on top.  ALWAYS A HIT!!

I let my 5 year old make these, I just helped with the oven.  He was so proud of himself!  I love these simple recipes that the kids think are so much fun and the end product is a tasty treat.

easy to make, but mine took more like 4 minutes, with checking every minute.  I then pushed m&m's immediately as they start cooling.

Hershey kisses do not soften because they changed their chocolate ingredients. I used the Hershey creams and it worked much better. Also, if you are lucky, you can find butter pretzels that are in the shape of trees.

I do these only I use Rollos instead of kisses and a pecan instead of m&m. They taste just like a turtle.

I've made these a couple of times now, and they are always a hit!  Sweet and salty all in one bite - who wouldn't love that?  Couple of tips . . . 1)These melt FAST!  Don't walk away from the oven.  Keep a close eye on them.  Mine took about 1-1/2 minutes . .. I removed, and you really need to let them sit for a minute before trying to place the M&M.  2)This recipe DOES NOT work with the "filled" kisses (cherry flavored, caramel, mint, etc).  I tried it, it doesn't work.  The filling just gushes out and makes a huge mess.  ONLY use regular Hershey kisses, or the PLAIN HUGS.  3) I recommend using Reynolds non-stick foil or a silicone baking mat.  Removal is a breeze with both of these, as long as you make sure they are set before removing.  4) To speed setting, place cookie sheet in the frig for a few minutes, but if you leave them refrigerated, the chocolate will turn white.  

Thanks for sharing this fast, easy, creative recipe!

I made these using square pretzels for my friends' 80's party - it was the ideal combination of brightly-colored M&Ms and geometric shapes to be 80s-esque, and quick prep time. I should have taken a pic before I left my house, because they were gobbled up too quickly after I got to the party!

Epic fail. Tried aluminum foil, parchment, adjusted heat lower, higher heat the chocolate wouldn't melt and crumbled when pushing the m&m in.

Yummy, exactly what I expected.  A little of a pain in the butt. Oven time should've been a tad longer I think in my oven.  Didn't set up in 30 minutes either, refrigerated them.

Thanks for the recipe.  I've been making them for years but we never knew what to call them.  We called them pretzel kisses but I like smoochies better!! I prefer to make these with the fat type of mini pretzels, regular shape of pretzels.  They don't look as pretty but the middles tend to pop out on the round pretzels.  You can also make these with rolo candies and squish a pecan on the top for a turtle type.

I bought regular kisses and mint kisses and the mint turned out MUCH better. The plain kisses did NOT melt well and did not have much taste. However, the mint was a perfect taste. I got these at Christmas time so I'm not sure if the mint kisses are sold year around.

I ruined a whole bag of kisses -Left in oven for too long, even after just a couple of minutes.  After reading older reviews and some research online, I realized: a. Oven temp for my oven too high and b. Hershey kisses are not meant to soften or melt so well in this method.  I was able to salvage a batch by using little cubes of homemade fudge instead of kisses, and lowering the oven temp to 225.  Chocolate softened (not melted) in just 3-4 minutes.  Pushed the m & m's in immediately, then chilled the batch in the fridge for a couple of hours.  I also used regular-shaped mini pretzels, so they looked like little reindeer.  Tasted good, but still a disappointment with all the tweaking and waste.

Be careful with oven temps and times! Only took all of 2 minutes at 275 for me. Put them in the fridge to set, as per another reviewer. Might try the chocolate wafers next time for different colors. These are a definite hit!

Made this recipe for a fund raiser at work and it was a huge hit. So I then decided to get a little creative and alternated the Hershey Kisses with Hugs.  Sent those off to my daughter away at college and the girls on her floor ate all 200 within 20 minutes of opening the package.  Just tried making a batch with Kraft Caramels and a pecan half.  Works just as well; only you need to add an extra 45 seconds to the oven time.  Melts much better if you use the Wilton Cany melts as opposed to the Hershey Kisses.

So easy and big crowd pleasers! I set temp to 200 so I had more time to pull them out. It took about 6 minutes. Once the tips of the Hershey’s kisses start to sink, then you know they’re ready to come out.

These were so quick and easy to make! After they were made, I put them in the freezer to set, and they were ready in 5 minutes.  I used Utz wheels round pretzels, and I topped them with several combinations. I used Hershey's milk chocolate kisses with candied cherries, Hershey's candy cane flavored kisses with M&M chocolate candies, and Rolos chocolate covered caramels with pecan halves. These turned out so pretty and delicious!

I made these for our Easter celebration and they turned out great.   I had Hersey kisses in the house so used them but I presses a candy coated chocolate egg on top and they looked really cute and tasted delicious.  Will definitely make again for any occasion.

Didn't push up down as much as I had hoped (the m & ms started becoming enclosed in the kiss), but lots of fun with the kids.

I make these quite often. I do not use kisses, I use rolo's. You can get them unwrapped. I also use the square waffle pretzels. The rolo's give that extra flavor with the yummy caramel!

The Smoochies were good but a little heavy on the chocolate. If you are a chocolate lover they'd be a good, easy to share indulgence.
I tried them again with pecans on top instead of the M&Ms and Rolos for the foil-wrapped chocolates. The result was salty, sweet, nutty, gooey and crunchy.

Instead of using kisses that have to be individually unwrapped, we used mini reeses peanut butter cups and mini rolos.  We put them in the microwave for 20 seconds. Making more today!!

These treats take a bit to set up but are worth it!  When I make them, I use the "waffle" type pretzels and I use Rolos instead of Hershey Kisses.  When the Rolos are shiny, I pull the tray out, carefully lay an M & M in the center, and gently push down.  I put the tray in the fridge for a bit to let them  harden, then viola!  I pop them off the tray and into a baggie!  They never last as they are so easy to just pop into your mouth.  A wonderful holiday treat with green and red M & M's.

What can be better than chocolate and pretzel?  Caramel, chocolate and pretzel.   I make a variety, some with Rolos instead of kisses, they melt faster so be careful!  You can also used nuts on the top instead of M&M's, the one with Rolos is like a turtle if you use a walnut on the top!   Yummy!

There are two things that I found most challenging about this recipe:  1)  peeling all the Hershey's Kisses; and 2) not eating all the M&Ms while the pretzels were in the oven!  :)  :)  :)  I set my oven to 200 degrees and the Kisses were just melty enough to add the M&Ms after about 4 - 5 minutes.  I did not use foil or parchment paper; everything went straight onto the baking sheet.  I placed the baking sheet, Pretzel Smoochies and all, directly in the fridge for 20 minutes before adding them to the goodie bags for my Bible Study group tonight.  :)

Such a big hit for a treat/snack item.  Very simple.  However I used Candy welt wafers for the chocolate.  They are already round and melt nicely.  Since I used the wafers I was able to make different flavored ones.  Peppermint for Christmas, orange creme, white chocolate....  Then I used the holiday M&Ms to match the event i was bringing them to.

I tried this recipe and used dark chocolate because our family likes it better and it would cut down the sweetness. I found out by trial and error that it does not melt the same way (or at all) so it was a flop! I took off the dark chocolate and will go to the grocery store tomorrow to get the milk chocolates and see if that works.

Not sure why I had such trouble with these...my kisses wouldn't melt!  I ended up sticking all the kisses in a double boiler with some milk and dropped the chocolate into each pretzel... that worked, but what a pain in the butt!!  They are super yummy though!

2 min at 350 seemed perfect.  Less time, and the m&m would not sink into the chocolate.  Longer, and the chocolate dried out and cracked.

These are incredible! My sister in law makes them every year and they don't last long. I made them once, but got annoyed at unwrapping all the hershey kisses. She can keep making them -- I'll eat them!
