Another update April 09  Do NOT use RealLime for this!  I just did a substitute because I didn't have real limes....even though RealLime is 100% lime juice, I just don't think it gives the "umph"....kind of a "washed" lime flavor once mixed in no matter how much I added.  REAL LIMES!  Squeeze them....LOVE them! *********************************** Updated March 09 for RASPBERRIES!! :)  After nearly a YEAR of being a HUGE fan of this, I finally attempted this was raspberries!   Everything still applies as I noted below, BUT I would add more lime juice when using raspberries (at least with frozen raspberries) as raspberries seem to have more of a potent flavor to it...it tended to drown out the lime...so another lime would work well.  I was JUST short of a full lime so I added a few strawberry slices (fresh) to tone it down.  Hmm..maybe tequila next time?? HAHAHAHA!  :)    Man, this recipe ROCKS my world!  *******************************************  WOW!!!!!!!!!!!  I registered for an account here so I could review this recipe!! LOL!  This ROCKS!  The neat thing about it is that there is an equal blend of strawberry and lime (you can taste BOTH in it...neither really overpower the other (at least I don't think).    About the ice issue...I think it also really depends on how you want the consistency.  Do you want it more FROZEN?  Do you want it more of a drink/liquid?  I added more ice (quite a bit more, but I also used fresh strawberries).  I would probably recommend that if yo

I followed the recipe to a T, except I used whole frozen strawberries (I'd have to thaw them to be able to slice them) and used 6 small ice cubes. It wasn't sweet enough with 1/4 a cup of sugar, so I stirred in a bit of honey into each cup before serving, and it turned out great. Without the honey, the limeade was missing some flavor.

Perfectly tart and sweet at the same time. I did not add the ice since the berries were frozen.  Kids loved it, especially the foamy part at the top.  Very refreshing summer drink!

Instead of using lime juice i used lemon juice and a limeade concentrate. I added mountain dew and sierra mist to it and the juice was soooo delicious.

I dont know why you would use water with this. I used 2 cups of sprite and also added some fresh cut lime squeezed and dropped in the drink.

This had great flavor after it melted down a bit.  Next time I will use fresh strawberries instead of frozen because the frozen berries made it too much like a smoothie.

I used fresh lime juice and Truvia instead of white sugar (the conversion chart told me six packets of Truvia was equal to 1/4 cup white sugar). This is absolutely delicious.

I doubled the sugar and increased the lime juice by 2 Tbl.  Also I put ice cubes up to the one cup line then filled with water to the 1 cup line.  For the 2nd cup I used cold water.  After these changes this was awesome!  The 5 stars reflect how it was after the changes.

This is a hit with everyone I live with. I know its winter but when I saw this I wanted to try it. Used orange juice in place of lime since I didn't have any. It tastes great and the guys keep asking for more!!

This recipe came out the consistency of a smoothie for me.  After it melted a bit it was better.  It was too strong before.  My kids are asking for it again.

Needed to use up limes and strawberries so this recipe was perfect! Squeezed real limes for the juice.  Used a pound of fresh strawberries.  Used about 2 cups of ice cubes.  I would have added more sugar if I wasn't on a diet, but it was still super delicious!

I rated this recipe on the changes I made to it.  I think limeade's are subjective to each person's tastes.  I used one cup of water, two cups of ice, 2 T. honey and an additional 2 T. of lime juice.  I like mine pretty tart.  Would also be great as an "adult" drink with your favorite liquor in it.

I use erythritol instead of sugar for a 'low glycemic' drink. Be aware, though, that erythritol is only 70% as sweet as sugar, so it takes a little more.

Was not real impressed with this recipe. My 5 year old really wanted strawberry limeade. I found this and made it. She didn't hardly drink any of it. Not sure why, but when I tasted it, I guess I was expecting a little more out of it.

Really good, but I suggest adding more ice cubes in the blender.  It makes a big difference.  You can also experiment with whatever you have around the house that you like: coconut milk, pineapple juice, orange juice, etc. It's all good!

Not bad.  I used fresh strawberries (went with two cups) and added more ice.  Maybe slightly too much lime flavor if you are more of a strawberry fan like myself.

Super tasty. Just the right amount of tart too. 1/2 cup of lime juice took exactly 4 limes for us.

An excellent recipe!  I used Splenda instead of sugar, and it still turned out great.  A very refreshing drink

This was just OK as is. Too much lime. Too tart. I added Malibu rum and that improved it considerably.

Such a refreshing drink. Sweet and tart at the same time. I used the juice of a real lime but subbed stevia for the sugar. Delicious! Would be a great mocktail for a party as well.

5.16.16   Used fresh strawberries, so I did add a little more of the crushed ice (we like drinks like this slushy), and cut back on the sugar (personal taste preference).  Good thirst quencher!

Really good!  We used lemon juice instead of lime, and needed to add a little more than in the recipe, but after that it was delicious.

I wasn't all that impressed by this. I'm not a huge fan of lime juice, and probably would have liked the lemon juice equivalent a lot better. I made it exactly as written, except that I used whole frozen strawberries (I've never seen sliced ones sold). The mixture separates kind of weirdly after a while, so I re-blended it a little before pouring subsequent glasses. It was worth a try, and I'm sure some people love it, but I'll move on to something else now.

i thought this was REAL yummy :)  we had some limes we had just picked off our tree...i don't know if storebought limes would make a difference or anything...the only change i made...and it was simply because the kids wanted more of a smoothie...i did 1 cup of icewater and about a cup and a half or so of ice...made it more slushy...but either way...the flavor was really good...i keep wanting to make more but we don't have anymore ripe limes on the tree :(

This is a very simple recipe for a quick summer refreshment.  My husband enjoys more smoothie type of beverages so I added more ice to thicken it up a bit.  Otherwise, I would enjoy it more as a drink.  Thanks!

This is very good. The limes I found were very hard to squeeze so I ended up using lime juice from the fridge. Which might have taken some flavor away. You can also add tequila and forgo the water and make strawberry margaritas.

Everyone loved this recipe, old, young and in between!  I found it a little tart at 1/4 cup of sugar but just add about 2 more tablespoons to that and woo! Very tasty and perfect for a summer day. Not too thick not too thin perfect mix. Yummy!
