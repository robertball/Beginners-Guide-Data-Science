Very nice. I had some eggnog that was getting over the hill and wanted to use it up. This looked like a wonderfully different and elegant recipe. I added 1/4 tsp. ground nutmeg to help bring out the eggnog flavor (and because I love nutmeg). I ended up adding more eggnog to make the dough stick together. I made an eggnog-rum glaze to drizzle on top: I combined 1 1/2 Tbsp. melted butter, 1 tsp. corn syrup, 1/2 tsp. rum flavoring, 3/4 cup confectioners' sugar and 2 Tbsp. eggnog (add more or less eggnog to get the correct drizzling consistency). I then just put the glaze in a baggie, snipped off the corner and drizzled in a zig-zag pattern, letting the glaze run over the edges of the scones. Delish! Especially served warm with a nice cup of tea.

These are delicious scones.  I like the slight crunch that the cornmeal gives them.  I baked it as one large round scone rather than cutting into smaller scones and just increased the baking time slightly.  The eggnog flavour is very subtle, so if you are looking for the eggnog flavour you might want to add some nutmeg.

This is a fast and delicious recipe that Hubby and I just love!  Sometimes I substitute currants, sometimes use plain milk instead of egg nog, but they're always yummy!

Very easy recipe, tasted really good. The eggnog taste is subtle not in your face. The round ones looked a little to perfect thought (like inexpensive canned biscuits) , so I cut the second batch into triangles, they looked much better that way. Im giving them as holiday gifts to friends.

Yum! I made these with the listed ingredients and they were great. Instead of making round scones, I cut the patted out round into 8 wedges (personal preference for wedge shaped scones!). After reading comments about the eggnog flavor being very subtle, I also brushed them with a little eggnog and sprinkled them lightly with sugar and freshly-grated nutmeg before baking ... that little extra glaze adds a lot!

Delicious! I had some eggnog to use up, so off to Allrecipes I went (thank you AR for your "search by ingredient" feature!) and found this gem. Like other reviewers, I added a splash or two more eggnog to get the dough to be not too crumbly. My husband made a glaze with orange juice, triple sec, orange extract, and powdered sugar... with the glaze, these scones are even more amazing. I'll definitely be making them again.

These were a huge hit at a brunch I hosted. I kept them warm by using a warming plate, and the next time I might take one viewers suggestion and add a few eggnog spices for that extra flavor. Thanks!

I halved the recipe and used corn muffin mix, rather than just cornmeal.  These were simple to make (once I got past rubbing in the butter.  I'm a bit of a novice at pastries.) and turned out wonderfully.  The flavor is light, they're not too dry and certainly not tough.  Will make again.  Thank you for sharing.

I used maraschino cherries instead of craisins.  These were easy to make.  They had a great eggnog taste.

We really liked these scones.  The flavor from the eggnog was not overpowering, but you definitely got enough of the flavor to put you in the holiday mood.  The cornmeal also adds an interesting flavor and texture that we liked a lot.  This makes a great holiday breakfast treat.

Great, simple, tasty recipe! I used fresh cranberries instead of dried; they add a nice bite. Just coarsely chop 1 cup of cranberries in the food processor and substitute for Craisins. I also added an extra splash of eggnog and some nutmeg. Yum!

These exceeded my expectations.  I made a few adjustments and they came out really good. Replaced butter with applesauce Used whole wheat flour Used Soymilk eggnog, a little bit more than 2/3 cup until all flour was no longer dry.  They were nice and fluffy and soft.

I love these scones! I did have to add a little bit more eggnog than the recipe called for, just enough to get the dough at the right consistency. I also added a 1/4 tsp of nutmeg to bring out the eggnog flavor a little more. I did find a recipe for a great eggnog rum glaze that puts these over the top. 

1 1/5 tsp melted butter
1 tsp corn syrup
1/2 tsp rum flavoring
3/4 cup powdered sugar
2 TBS eggnog (or more to get the desired consistency)

The best scone recipe I've tried! In my dry climate I had to add about another 1/8 tbsp of egg nog to the dough because it was so dry. I'm definitely going to save this one for Christmas!

I didn't have eggnog but used sour cream that I had on hand and they came out very nicely.  Initially a little sticky but they shaped up well as I kneaded them a few times on a floured board, and they were easy to transfer to the baking sheet.  I liked this recipe very much.

I hate it when someone rates a recipe but doesn't follow the recipe and makes a ton of changes.

That said I followed the recipe, to the letter, on Thanksgiving morning since I was up early anyway getting everything ready to cook that day.   As visiting family woke up and came to the kitchen they were greeted by these freshly baked scones.

Everyone from 12 to 60 loved these scones.  There was just enough cornmeal to give it a slightly different texture and the eggnog gave it just a subtle hint of flavor.  A perfect blend of textures and flavors.  This will be a holiday tradition that will continue!

As a side note, while I'm the 'main' cook for the family I almost never do baked good other than an occasional batch of muffins.  This recipe is dead on easy to follow for a non-baker!

Quite possibly the best "classical" scone I've ever made.  I do not usually like bready foods but I am always making scones for my children.  Usually I add tons of vanilla and spices or fruit or chocolate or something to flavor them.  We didn't have cranberries so I skipped it.  We didn't have eggnog so I used coconut milk instead.  They were a bit dry so I added enough cream to mix.  Threw on a cutting board and shaped into a circle. Cut 8 triangles.  Brushed with cream and sprinkled with organic sugar (which disappeared but that was even better!)  Quick and easy.  My children INHALED them!!!  And I'm finding it difficult to save the last one for my son's breakfast.  Maybe I'll just have to make more tomorrow?

I made these this last week...the night my second daughter was born!  :)  
I didn't have eggnog so I substituted milk with a bit of nutmeg and vanilla extract added to it.  I thought the scones were slightly dry but they still tasted very good.  I used blueberry infused dried cranberries!  Yum!

These were fine. No one else really liked them. I was trying to use up Christmas eggnog. I probably wont make them again. Cornmeal kind of made them grainy. You could tell cornmeal was in there.

Delicious scones!  I almost added more sugar but am glad I didn't because the eggnog takes care of that.  I love how all the flavors blend together.  I formed my dough into a fairly thick circle and then cut these into triangles.  It made about 9.  Just great!

YUM!!!! I was worried about it while making them but they turned out GREAT!!! When it says to cut in chilled butter, I found it easier to warm the butter a bit and then almost knead it in until there were coarse crumbs. I am so impressed, it's hard not to eat the whole batch. They're wonderful!

These scones are pretty good.  Not too sweet and the cornmeal gives a nice texture.  I couldnt tell they had eggnog in them, but they made a nice addition to the egg casserole I made for breakfast.  I might add a little more eggnog next time.

These are great! Very easy,  didn't make a mess on the counter at all :)  I added cinnamon and nutmeg for more of a Christmasy eggnog flavour,  also added white chocolate chips. I did mine in a square pan and cut into slices before baking. 17-20 mins at 375deg. My coworkers,  husband and family all loved them and asked for more!

These tasted okay but, for some reason, mine didn't rise at all. I followed the recipe exact so not sure what went wrong. More like cookies.

These were great and fun to make with the kids. We used a star cookie cutter since we made them for Christmas and also added an orange glaze...yum!

I served these on Dec 27 for a baby shower brunch. I used large star cookie cutters as the theme of the shower was Welcome our new little Star ! Rave reviews from all the guests.

Family that doesn't usually care for scones actually liked these.  Added an extra 1/4 cup eggnog as the dough seemed a little dry.  Just rolled out dough once into a circle and cut triangles from it.  May become a Christmas morning tradition.

Our new favorite! As others suggested, I added more eggnog, patted dough into a 1/2" square and cut them  into traditional scone triangles, brushed them with eggnog and sprinkled with sugar. Delish! It will be hard to share these!

I was in charge of morning after thanksgiving breakfast. These were a big hit. Served with leftover cranberry relish. When putting together, I added extra eggnog. Just wasn't enough as written in recipe.

Made exactly as written, never made scones before, and so impressed with myself!!!!  Wonderful!  I did have to bake it in one large disk, so took about 15 additional minutes, and frosted with another reviewers suggestion of orange glaze!  Perfection!!

I was pleased with this recipe; I changed it up a bit for my tastes. I used White Whole Wheat flour, and then used 1/6 cup of half stevia, half sugar. For the eggnog, I replaced it with Silk Nog.

I like the crunch of the cornmeal on these scones. Eggnog flavor is too subtle. I added some nutmeg but some rum extract would help up the flavor.

The scones are great!  But would recommend that for smaller scones, divide the dough in half and oat into an 8” circle, cut into 8 pieces and bake per the directions.  I top with turbinado sugar.

I agree with other reviewers: the eggnog flavor was very light. I dusted a tiny bit on top before baking and next time I’ll add a full teaspoon straight in to bring out the eggnog flavor. I also used a vegan eggnog I had purchased for my daughter who is DF. I used a DF “butter” (Earth Balance) and a GF flour blend (Bob’s in the blue bag), making these GF, DF and egg-free!

I made this recipe New Year's morning and I hope my New Year is like these scones: delicious, not complicated, and fun to make! Seriously, the eggnog makes these scones extra tasty! I looked at the photos of others and saw that they glazed them so I did too. A definite repeat recipe! Happy New Year's!

I was surprised by how good these were, though I prefer a scone with a more cakelike texture. They were still easy to make and delicious.  I made a glaze with egg nog, milk, nutmeg and powdered sugar to top them off while they were still hot out of the oven.

While making these, I found the dry mix was too much for the limited liquid, so I had to improvise and add a little more eggnog and butter. I think they turned out pretty good. I made several different sizes with cookie cutters. Flavorful!

I am not a baker, so when I choose a recipe, I read through the reviews to decide whether or not to make a recipe. I did not bake the recipe exactly as written based on the overwhelming number of people who made some (consistant) suggestions/changes. The recipe flavor is great! I was concerned about the cornmeal, but actually enjoyed it in the recipe as it added a bit of texture but was not overpowering in flavor. But because I did cook the recipe and made the changes, I can only give this recipe a 4-star review. If I had not made the suggested changes, I think these scones would have been very dry and lacked the eggnog flavor that makes this recipe worth trying. Now for my notes:
1. I added 1/4 tsp of ground nutmeg to the dry ingredients.  2. Because the dough was so dry and crumbly, I added in total an additional 1/4 cup of eggnog to the dough to make it "sticky" as instructed in the second instruction.
3. I baked the scones as triangles on a baking sheet lined with a silpat. I made a square and then cut the square into 8 triangles. This did two things, it gave me nice traditional scone shapes AND I didn't overwork the dough forming the leftovers into another disk to cut additional rounds. (One and done.)
4. Before placing into the oven, I brushed the tops of the scones with eggnog which gave the scones a nice sheen when removed from the oven.
5. I made the suggested rum eggnog glaze and drizzled over the top which helped to punch the eggnog flavor over the top that several

These were delicious! I also chose to cut the scones into 8 wedges,  added a little nutmeg to the batter, and made an eggnog glaze to drizzle over top. The texture was wonderful, and they reheated really nicely in the oven the next day (about 6 minutes on 365)

There is not enough liquid in this recipe to make the dough sticky like it should be. Also, using a 2-inch diameter biscuit cutter gives you very small scones.

I love the cornmeal in there. I needed more eggnog to keep the dough together, though. I also added some nutmeg to the glaze I made for the top. Sometimes I use fresh cranberries, loosely diced.

I made these for Christmas morning. They were so good! Following some reviews that I read I added a bit of ground nutmeg to the batter and made the glaze recipe I found in one review. I didn't cut them into individual biscuit shapes, but just patted the dough into a square on parchment paper, baked it a bit longer (~10 mins), then cut into wedges. Family loved them!

What did I do wrong? They were flat. Impossible to cut without crumbling and the cornmeal made the consistency nothing like a scone.

will definitely make again. added 1 cup of egg nog as the dough was too dry. turned out perfectly. rolled into a circle and cut into wedges instead. Backed a few minutes longer as the wedge shapes were a little thicker. Subtle nutmeg flavor is just right.

Delicious! No tweaks necessary. Great scone texture with a little sweetness from the eggnog. Even though I don't like to drink eggnog this was excellent!

Easy and fun to make! Great texture but not enough eggnog flavor so I plan to use eggnog in powdered sugar icing  when cool. Would definitely make again. I did cut into triangles , not rounds.

These were very tasty and easy. I left out the cranberries and I added a bit of rum extract and nutmeg. I also made a glaze with eggnog and powdered sugar and a dash of rum extract and drizzled the tops.

I followed the directions as written this first time. Not crazy about the corn meal. I didn't like the texture. Overall, the recipe was good. Flavor was excellent. I'll make it again but omit the cornmeal.

These are without a doubt the VERY BEST  scones I have had--EVER!  
scones are not one of my favorite things because they are usuaally dry, crumbly, and lack flavor.  These are moist, very flavorful, and the texture is wonderful.  I am finishing them up two days after making them, and they are still wonderful.  You would not know know that there is eggnog or cornmeal in them; those ingredients only increase the overall flavor and texture.  I like my scones sweet, so I added a Tblsp of sugar, and put a powdered sugar glaze on top.  YUM!  I also used dried fruit that was a combination of fruits.  I bet ANY dried fruit would be good.  TRY THIS!  It is simply wonderful.  Thank you Jowolf!

I think these are very mediocre scones. They are dry and tasteless to me. I've made a lot of scones and these don't rank anywhere near the top of the list. The recipe is already in the garbage. I'm going to try and put a flavorful glaze on top to see if they are even edible

Made these with a little added nutmeg like people had suggested with some orange zest.  Made the frosting out of powdered sugar,orange liqueur to give an orange pop to the cranberries and nutmeg. They were really good. Thanks for sharing because I had never made scones by scratch before. This is so holiday tasting.

I'm just not sure.  Based on flavor and ease of making, I'm going with 4 stars.  I couldn't go five though because that crunchy corn meal is going to take some getting used to.  Maybe by the time I eat the other 7 scones......yes, they are THAT tasty!

I'd been looking for a good scone recipe with cornmeal, as I love the texture cornmeal gives.  When I saw that this recipe had eggnog, I was ecstatic, but when I went to the grocery stores, I could not find eggnog!  Now that the holiday season is here, eggnog is in abundance and I made these scones and they are everything I was looking for.  Since there was no mention of a glaze in the recipe, I mixed some eggnog and powdered sugar together to give them a nice finish.

These turned out pretty good, but a bit tasteless (I still enjoyed them and everyone else as well). I think the recipe needs to be edited though, because, as some other people here have mentioned, you definitely need more eggnog/milk/whatever you use. I had to add more milk. I think there are too much of the dry ingredients and too little of the liquid. You may also need to add some flavour: nutmeg, vanilla, cinnamon, whatever, or the taste will be pretty bland and boring.

I made these for a festive event for our women's group at church & they loved them! Thank you for sharing this recipe, I'll definitely be making these again over Christmas. I made the glaze that someone else posted on here and really made them special :)

I made this recipe today.  I did find my mixture was a little too dry so next time I will add a little more eggnog.  Taste was great.
