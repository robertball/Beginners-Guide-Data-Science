This was a very good base recipe.  I didn't add sour cream, and I only had sugar free strawberry and surar free orange jello.  I used them both and they tasted great!  I also used a can of crushed pinapple and substituted some of the cold water with the pineapple juice I drain from the can.  It was the favorite side this thanksgiving.  Everyone loved it including my two yr old son.  There were no leftovers.

Fantastic recipe!!  I changed a few things though.  I omitted the carrots and pecans.  I used cranberry and raspberry gelatin.  Other than that this was a huge hit at my Thanksgiving.  It has the PERFECT amount of sweetness and tartness.  Even my 80 year old grandmother that only likes canned cranberry sauce gobbled this right up.

This salad was so yummy!  It is so crunchy, and sweet, and tart all at the same time.  The fresh cranberries really make this dish!  I tried chopping up my cranberries in my blender, and that was a miserable failure, so I resorted to using my hand-food processer, and that worked great!  I used Strawberry Jello instead of raspberry, and it was perfect.
This recipe makes a LOT of salad.. I had a huge amount left over in the fridge (we have a small family), but I kept munching on it all week.. it stays fresh for a long time!  I will definitely make this again.

This salad was wonderful! Not to sweet with lots of cranberry and orange flavor. I did omit the carrot, though.

This is a wonderful recipe. It's deliciously sweet and a bit crunchy with lots of yummy fruit.  One important note, it says refrigerate "until chilled," which I tried, refrigerating it for about two hours. When it was time to bring it to my potluck, it was not at all solidified so I had to grab a can of cranberries to bring instead!  It really needs about FOUR hours of chilling to solidify, especially with all the stuff in it. Just important to know in order to plan ahead.

I made exactly per the recipe, except left the nuts out.  Very good and a wonderful change from "Straight up" cranberry sauce.  I will probably add another orange next time.

I've used this recipe for more than 10 years and it's the best I've found!  No need to add anything. You can feel good about the all the good things in it, and even the kids love this one!

I have been making this salad for 2 years at Thanksgiving and everyone loves, loves it. Mine never sets up like a jello salad (not sure if it is suppose to) so I put it in a cake dish and that works fine. I do cut back on the sugar I usually end up adding 1 1/2 cups or to taste, and I use the juice from the canned pineapple for some of the liquid and add water to make up the difference. It's a winner!!!!

I just made the Cranberry Salad III, it was a very familiar take on my mother’s cranberry salad. I wish she was still here to give me her recipe. As I said it was very familiar, mom didn’t add carrots, but would add finely chop celery, which is what I did.  I’m not sure if my mom added the extra sugar, so it was omitted. I took a taste, and all the old memories came flooding back to me, it was just like mom’s. Delicious! Love you mom!
