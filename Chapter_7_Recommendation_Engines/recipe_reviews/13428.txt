I did add some fresh minced garlic. Because I did not have diced tomatoes with green peppers, I used one can diced tomatoes and one half 4 ounce can diced mild green chilies. For me, I think there was a little too much chicken broth. Next time, I'd cut it from half and go from there. Good idea, though. I think it would be a good base for tortilla or taco soup.

This is a phenomenal recipe.  I don't usually have recipes where I can open cans and dump, but you can get this ready in thirty minutes and the kids love it.  Perfect for a football game.  I like to use diced tomatoes with Jalepeno instead of the stewed tomatoes if you can find them.  I also add a can of Trappey's Navy beans with Jalepeno and 1/2 bag of frozen shoepeg corn.

We used the whole can of tomato soup.  I added fresh garlic and some extra green chilis.  But it was delicious.  My husband says we will have to put this on the list of regulars!

I have been making this for a couple years now, and decided I needed to review it. I don't know why it hasn't gotten more reviews. It is simple to make with easily found ingredients and tastes great with some crushed tortilla chips and cheese sprinkled on top. Great as a first course for a Mexican meal. Don't omit the hot sauce - it gives it a terrific, flavorful kick.

This soup had a lot of flavor!  It also took little prep time.  I threw all my ingredients in the crock pot and let it cook over night.  I used the whol can of tomato soup as other reviewers suggested (this gave it a very tomato-ey taste).  I also added some italian seasoning, chili powder, oregano, and onion powder to give it more flavor.  The servings were very large, making this more of an entree than a side dish.

It was good, but nothing too exciting.  I also added diced celery.  I ended up adding two cans of condensed tomato soup since I didn't think it had enough tomato taste.  It was quick and easy and filling.  Good served with panini sandwiches.

This soup is wonderful, especially on a cold snowy day. I used low fat/sodium versions of the broth, tomato soup, chips, cheese and sour cream. It was still very tasty. I wound up using the whole can of tomato soup rather than discarding it. This recipe is a keeper!

One confusing thing about this recipe.  In the ingredients, it calls for 1 can of tomato soup, but in the instructions, it says "...1/2 can condensed cream of tomato soup."  I wasn't going to throw away half a can of soup, so I added it all.  I only had 3 cups of chicken stock left, so that's what I used.  PLEASE consider the "1 tsp of hot pepper sauce" optional.  We're probably middle of the road on spiciness, and the can of Rotel Diced Tomatoes & Green Chilies made this plenty spicy enough for us.  Could be because I was 1 cup short on the chix broth, so the soup was more concentrated, but just taste before adding the hot sauce.  We didn't ladle our soup over broken tortilla chips in the bowl, but served them on the side.  We like this and will make again, and for anybody watching his/her diet, this breaks down pretty well nutritionally.

I'd give it three stars for taste, but it does make a fast spicy lunch.

I had ½ a can of tomato soup I was looking to use, so I tried this recipe for only 3 servings. I also only had diced tomatoes (without the chilis) so added ½ a chili pepper  when cooking the bell pepper and onion.

This is a tasty soup that I will be making again; a real different slant on the usual tomato soups that I’m used to.

Soup had great flavor, but I thought it too thin. Did use whole can of tom soup otherwise stuck to recipe. Next time will use less broth.

Delicious! I put the whole can of tomato soup in.  Would have been too hot for us otherwise.
