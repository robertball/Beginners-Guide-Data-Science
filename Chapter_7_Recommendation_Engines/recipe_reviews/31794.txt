My Mother-in-law taught me how to Loobia Polow they way her Iranian mother-in-law taught her in Iran!  She does not put jalapeno or curry powder in it.  She does add to it turmeric and a little cinnamon to the meat while it is cooking.  My 4-year-old loves this so much that I can get him to clean up his room in five minutes flat if I bribe him with “Stumboli Kaplow” (how he says the name of this dish!)!!

A way to avoid the fried rice on the bottom is to put thin slices of potato on the bottom.  The potatoes come out crispy and are a nice extra with this dish.  My mother always did this and we all fought over the potatoes.

Sorry but as a persian this seems more like a arab, indian with a hint of mexican recipe than anything else. ground beef=wrong curry=wrong jalapeno=wrong and did i hear you say BROTH?  although it may be good for the untrained persian  the real deal recipe is so comforting that you can eat it over and over and over!


Stew meat, beef - 
Fry meat in 2 tbl of oil until browned(season with salt and pepper (turmeric as well). (Drain excess oil)

Return meat to pan, add one can of tomato sauce. You can caramelize 1 onion in another pan and add to meat. Simmer on medium/low until tender. Add water if needed as it simmers to keep it from drying up.
Last 5 minutes, add 2 cans of green beans. (drained)

Rice -
Boil rice, up to 5 minutes. (do not cook rice all the way. Semi crunchy still)
Remove and rinse.

Add 4 tbl oil and 2 tbl of butter in a pot large enough for rice and meat until butter melts..(med/high)

Add 1/3 of rice. 1/3 of sauce, ever so lightly combine, rolling it. Repeat 2 more times.

Cook on med/high for 7-10min uncovered. Cover with lid (wrap lid with kitchen towel or few sheets of paper towels.

Cook for additional 40 min. ( this will crisp the bottom of the rice. (Ta dihg)

Get a large enough plate, place on top of pan and flip it. This will look like an upside cake.

Serve with plain yogurt mixed with chopped cucumbers and some garlic and or dill weed.

Serve it up!

Although I enjoyed this dish, I still prefer the traditional way that my mother makes it and that is with turmeric and not curry. Try it and see what you prefer!

This is a great recipe for an easy and delicious Persian meal. My only suggestions for making this more authentic and closer to the original recipe: Skip the jalapeno peppers, replace the curry with turmeric, and add saffron too.

Excellent winter warmer and family staple meal!
I'm a lazy cook: here's how I tweaked it to be even easier!
Instead of jalapenos I used 1/2 fresh green beans and 1/2 chopped bell pepper (red is yummy).
Lazy cook alert! Instead of using a pot on the stove, whack the mixture (after rice has barely absorbed the liquid) into your electric RICE COOKER, hit the start button and leave it alone! If your cooker is non-stick like mine, the 'rice cake' will pop out in perfect shape when you're ready for dinner!
An excellent one-pot meal!

I love rice and this was a delicious treat!  I left out teh meat but used everthing else. The curry and jalapenos are what gives this dish a real kick in the butt!  Thanks

This was a lot of fun to make and really delicious.  Like everyone here, I made some adjustments:  first I used half the rice, beans and meat.  Then, I doubled the amount of onion, added 4 cloves of minced garlic, and used for spices 1 T turmeric, 1 t cinnamon, 1 t curry powder, 1 t cumin seed, 1/2 t cayenne.  I also used Morningstar Farms burger crumbles and brown basmati rice and used 2 cups of broth, and because of the longer rice cooking stage, :40, skipped the first cooking of the beans by just tossing the rice in with the beans.  This nicely filled, and nicely stuck to, my Calphalon everyday pan, but the crust was easy to scrape out and put on top of the rice, and tasted just as good.  The crust was declared a delicacy!  This dish wins!

This is a great recipe. I substituted turmeric for the curry and used red pepper flakes instead of the pepper for spice and added garlic with the onion. This recipe makes A LOT of food, which is good because it goes fast. Edit: Don't skip the tadiq (the fried rice at the bottom). That's what we Persians fight over!

This makes SO much food - filled an entire 5 quart dutch oven.

Rice was black on bottom about 25 minutes in so I served up. Quite spicy without much flavour. Saved it by adding some natural yoghurt. Will not make this again!!

It tasted great! It was a bit watery though in the end. I would cut down on the chicken broth.

Made a few mistakes my first time making it, and didn't realize it would make so much, but my 1.5 year old loved it and that makes it a hit in our house. I think I will also try some of the alternative spice suggestions on future tries. Overall, it was very good though.

This is completely different than the lubia polo I make. I fry bits of stew meat in oil with onion and garlic, then add tomato sauce, salt/pepper and tumeric and/or saffron. It is much better with saffron that has been ground up fine and stirred into melted butter then added. I do blanch the beans to keep them bright,and I like them crisp so add them at the end of the sauce. I do not use broth, I just use basmati rice (cooked in a well oiled large pot "al dente" - not quite cooked so the rice stays firm and separated). You put the sauce on top of the rice and continue cooking on low for a while then 15 minutes before serving stir it all together and serve. I like my rice very tomatoe-y so add more sauce, which is not authentic but there you have it.

This was good! I skipped the rice-crisping because I don't have the right kind of pot. I also cut the rice down to 2 cups and adjusted the liquid accordingly. I took the advice of another reviewer and omitted the jalepeno, and for the spices I did 1 tbsp. turmeric, 1 tsp. cumin, 1 tsp. curry, 1 tsp. cinnamon and 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper. Overall, it wasn't the greatest thing I've ever made, but it was pretty good!

I didn't use the jalapeno while cooking, but did add to my own plate, to make kid friendly.  I guess that worked because my picky son actually ate his with no complaints.  I also cut back on the amount of rice/broth.  This was a great way to use up the abundence of green beans in my garden.    It makes a lot, so I'll be taking some for lunch.  I will make this again for sure.  Thanks so much for the post Trina!

I can only give a 4 because of my own customizations (due to lack of certain ingredients and the fact that it would be served also to a 2-, 5- and 7-year-old). The base was great and I look forward to making it again for myself with the jalapeno! 
Just one thing to mention: didn't need the full 35 minutes at the end, only about 15 and it was nice and crispy as desired. 
Good luck and eet smakelijk!

A great one pot dish. I had cut back on the curry, added turmeric, and seeded the jalapeño (needed to be kid-friendly). Since I had at least 1.5 cups of leftover white rice, I only added somewhere around 1 cup of broth. After turning off the heat, I let everything rest for a while so the rice can absorb the broth.

Wow, my husband and I loved this dish!  It was a lot of food, but we finished it off in a couple days.  We loved the 'tah digh,' too.  I will definitely make this for company sometime.  Thanks for sharing!

My Dad is Iranian and this was one of my favorite dishes when I was little but I haven't had it in years because my husband it a typical American man and he doesn't really like to go out of his comfort box. I didn't use the jalapenos or the onions because I made this for my 2 year old daughter and my hubby is allergic to onions.  I used turmeric (that's what my fam. used when I was little) instead of curry but the rest I followed just as the directions stated and it turned out perfectly.  My husband and my daughter (both very picky) loved it, we will definitely be using again!

"Yum" says my 1/2 Persian husband - "Make that one again".  I followed the recipe exactly.  We make plenty of persian rice in this house and this was a nice variation on the old standard.  We did burn the crust (what a shame) but with practice we will make perfect.  Can't wait to make this for the rest of the persian side of the family - they will be so proud of me.  This is a standard recipe served in all persian restaurants so we thank you for posting it!

Excellent! I used two cans of green beans (since I didn't have any fresh) and cut out the 15 minutes to cook the beans.  I also cut down the curry to 1 tablespoon and left out the jalapenos so it wouldn't be too spicy for my kids.  They LOVE this recipe!!

I really like the idea of frest green beans.  I couln't find basamatti rice at my grocer, so I used a package of yellow saffron rice.  I also used sausage with the hamburger to flavor it up.  Also, didn't have any curry, so I used some garlic powder and salt instead.  Tasted great!

My bf mom, who is Persian taught me how to make this and she doesn't put any curry or jalepeno in it, just Tumeric.   But I use this recipe as a base for remembering because it is my favorite persian dish and I make it all the time. This is a terrific recipe.

If I could give this 4 1/2 stars I would.  We loved it!! I even managed to get it out of the pot onto a plate in a mound shape, but it was a bit too crispy. Leftovers freeze really well too!

It didn't hold the shape when I turned the pot over, but it was EXCELLENT, nonetheless.  I will make this again and use less water for the rice to make it firmer.

The thought of Middle Eastern food was quite appealing to my husband and I, but although it was somewhat spicy we felt it was still missing something.
