This is a great recipe.  Most banana cupcake recipes I've tried are a little dense and muffin/bread like.  This one is fluffy, soft and very tasty.  I have to admit that I was slightly skeptical about using the full 2 tsp of baking soda (it seemed a little much for the amounts of the other ingredients) but I did use the full 2 tsp and even though the batter tasted a little soda-y, the final product did not.  It was perfect.  I did make a couple of minor changes in that I did not use the pecans at all and I baked these at 325 degrees instead of 300.  I got 18 regular sized cupcakes out of this recipe.

This recipe came out so fluffy! Best version of banana bread I've ever had, and I've tried a LOT.  i would've given it five stars except that I modified it quite a bit.  Instead of three bananas I only used two and added a box of banana pudding mix.  Since the pudding was drier than a banana would be I took out about a quarter cup of flour. I also added a tablespoon of vanilla and instead of buttermilk I used Mexican crema.  I love experimenting and this time I think it really paid off!

These cupcakes were amazing!!  They were so moist and the flavor was beyond great!   I followed the recipe exactly an made cream cheese icing for them.   I took these to a potluck "dessert night" and they were a hit...definitely the best dessert there.  Thanks for sharing :)

These were absolutely delicious!  There is a very slight taste of banana which didn't overpower the muffin.  That's a plus in my house to disguise fruit fom my daughter.  The only change I made was I used applesauce in place of the oil, I ground the nuts so they blended into the muffin and I added about 2 tableoons of fax seed and 1 teaspoon of vanilla.  Oh and about 3/4 cup of mini chocolate chips!  Yummy.  I made a batch yesterday and there are only 3 left.  About to make a second batch now.  Will be making these alot!  Thanks for a great recipe!

YUMMY! I was looking for a fluffy BB cupcake recipe and this one was super simple. I didn't have buttermilk and didn't want to wait for a store run so I used almond milk. I also added a little vanilla which was recommended from one of the reviews and 3/4 c sugar instead of the full cup, which was also recommended. The batter made 12 cupcakes and 6 doughnuts. If I can stop eating them right out of the oven I will add cream cheese frosting. I also like that this recipe isn't too overpowering with banana flavor. Happy baking!

These came out great. I substituted apple sauce for the vegetable oil and skipped the buttermilk. I added two teaspoons of vanilla to the recipe. I cooked these at 325F for about 20 minutes. I used chocolate frosting on these cupcakes.

I love how this makes a nice light cupcake rather than a denser version such as banana bread. I followed the recipe except that I used just under a full cup of sugar and I didn't want to buy buttermilk for only 3 tbsp since I don't bake often. I looked up a buttermilk substitute and found I could use 1 tbsp white vinegar or lemon juice in a measuring cup and then fill with milk to the 1 cup mark, let stand for 5 minutes and then used 3 tbsp of that. Turned out beautifully! I also chose not to use pecans. These took 17 minutes in the oven at the stated temperature and yielded 3 1/2 dozen (42) mini cupcakes. I also added a cream cheese frosting and a bit of blue and green decoration. Perfect for the little people and moms I was feeding at my son's 1st birthday playdate and we have lots to share with the neighbours!

What a wonderful recipe for those left over ripe bananas!  I agree with other reviews that these were fluffy and light.  I forgot to mix pecans in with batter so I ended up putting them on top and skipped the confectioner sugar.  I like  that these need no frosting.  I did not have buttermilk and so I just substituted 2% milk and reduced sugar to 3/4 cup.  We love this recipe!

This is defiantly the thing to do with over ripe bananas! So good and so moist family gobbled it up way faster than they do banana bread. We did add a vanilla glaze to sweeten it up for dessert. Thanks for sharing.

Followed the directions and ingredients EXACTLY. The cupcakes came out perfect! Very light for a banana cupcake, and also nice and moist with a wonderful sugary banana flavor. Tastes like a cupcake, not a muffin. I own a cupcake business and this is my go to banana recipe. I might up the heat to 325 degrees next time and see if they turn out the same. These cupcakes taste awesome paired with a chocolate peanut butter frosting!

I can't believe how good this was. And I mixed it by hand. With a dinner spoon. While babysitting my toddler. I added two tsps. vanilla and 1 tsp. salt for extra flavour. I added choc chips instead of pecans 'cos baby has a nut allergy and then I topped with choc frosting. That was overkill and I'll omit the chips the next time. What amazed me was the texture: light and fluffy, more like a creamed sugar and butter cake batter and less muffiny. Thank you. I look forward to experimenting with this.

Super good to use up those ripe bananas! I made it a touch healthier by subbing 1/2 of the oil for applesauce and using yogurt instead of buttermilk.  Great for the kids' lunchboxes!

I just made these banana cupcakes. I love how they turned out. The amazing aroma permeated the entire house. And the taste it absolutely wonderful. I'm sooo glad I found this recipe. I had a bunch of bananas that were getting too ripe.  I also added a pinch of salt, three tablespoons of chia seeds and a teaspoon of vanilla extract. I will definitely make this again.

I made these cupcakes last week but followed a reviewer's suggestion and added a box of instant banana cream pudding. It was the absolute best banana cupcake recipe I've ever had. So moist that my husband was eating them without icing. I made mini cupcakes instead of regular. Everyone raved about them. Thanks so much for this recipe.

These were delicious! Moist and tasty! My only little changes were that I use half brown sugar/half regular sugar, I put a dash of vanilla, omitted the nuts and sprinkled some chocolate chips on top before baking them. I will definitely be making these again

I'm basing my review on the taste of the batter since the cupcakes are in the oven while I'm typing this review.    The only change I made was to add another banana because I had 4 that were ripe and needed to be used.    Also, I use powdered buttermilk that you can find in grocery store in with alternative milks.   I find with that product I'm throwing away a lot less buttermilk when I need some for a recipe since you mix it up as needed.   I did find that I got 22 cupcakes out of the recipe using my 3 TBS cupcake scoop.   Hubby will be the final taste taster as he loves banana cupcakes/cake.

I followed the directions exactly. Sorry, there was nothing fluffy about these muffins. The taste was good and they were certainly moist, but quite heavy. Possibly a higher temp would have helped.

Delicious little things! I made them twice to test the recipe; the second time I made some changes that I quite liked. You can definitely make the recipe as is, but  for starters, I left out the nuts. To the second batch I also added 1tsp vanilla extract, a pinch of salt, and one extra Tbsp buttermilk, only because 1/4C was simpler to measure than 3Tbsp. And YUM. Loved them with some fudgy buttercream on top!

I made these gluten free using a homemade gluten free cake flour blend. The texture was phenomenal, super moist, delicate, and not dense at all! With that being said, the recipe is in desperate need of some vanilla and salt, and I believe that would be the case, even with regular flour. They had a banana flavor, but were disappointingly bland. The texture was so great, though, that I plan on remaking these, with salt and vanilla added.

Awesome recipe!  I did not change a thing, but I added my own cream cheese frosting. I have made these for my son's first and second birthday parties and both babies and adults love! I did find that the recipe makes closer to 16 cupcakes, and may even be stretched to get a couple more; since I was making them for babies and wanted to frost, I made them slightly smaller. This recipe is filed under my absolute favorites. :)

Very fluffy and moist. Not dense like a lot of banana bread recipes. I used muffin bakers with silicone covers that leave a well in the top of each muffin and after they cooled I filled the well with banana pudding and chopped bananas. My husband was in heaven. This is our new favorite banana muffin recipe. Thanks!!

Just made these yesterday.  They were amazing!  I followed the recipe exactly.  So moist and fluffy...not dense like banana bread/muffins.  Thanks for sharing this recipe! (I also made the cream cheese frosting and was able to pipe it onto the cupcakes.)

Very good cupcake!  I used Ghirardelli cocoa recipe for chocolate butter cream frosting and the combo was great. (6 oz butter, 1/2 c. cocoa, 2 2/3 c. powdered sugar, 1/2 tsp vanilla, 1/3 c. milk)

Great cupcake recipe! I didn't have any buttermilk so I used sour milk - 1 tsp vinegar plus 3 tbsp milk. Stir to mix and leave on counter to thicken slightly.  I added a splash of vanilla to cake batter because I love vanilla!
Family loved them so I will definitely make these again!!!

Was easy, simple to follow but boy was it bland. Nice banana flavor but aside from that no other spice to complement the banana. Moist and fluffy definitely sweet enough with 3/4 cup packed brown sugar and used sour cream when I didn't have buttermilk.

The cupcakes turned out wonderful!!  They were light and fluffy! Great flavor too.  I followed the recipe exactly as written except that I didn't have buttermilk and substituted heavy cream(just because it was in my refrigerator).  I made cream cheese frosting and iced some and left some plain.  They all went.  I will make them again.

I had to do a bit of substituting and adjusting to make up for ingredients I didn't have on hand, and this recipe proved itself to not ony ve very wonderful, but also very flexible and forgiving. I used a mix of melted butter and olive oil instead of vegetable oil, and you'd never know  that I used only 1 large (ripe) banana instead of 3, as the banana flavor was perfect.

These are great, I even had some blueberries lying around and switched out the bananas, just added a little more sugar to balance out the tartness.  I’m going to try strawberry next.  There were none left, people took them home.  These are not super sweet, (I used cream cheese frosting).

I just baked the cupcakes today.Because my bananas were very ripe,I lessened the sugar to 3/4 cup. these are the other changes I made based on the other reviews. I did not have buttermilk, so I used almond milk instead, I used 1/3 c. apple sauce and added some shortening to make it a total of 3/4 cup.I baked at 325 for 25 minutes.It came out for very good, soft and fluffy.

These cakes came out really soft and fluffy.  They were quick and easy to make.  I thought the sugar seemed a lot but they didnt turn out too sweet.  The only change I made was substuting the buttermilk with evaporated milk because that is what I had and it turned out great.  I will definitely try this again using some of the tips given in the other reviews.

This is really a good recipe. Fluffy and moist and incredibly delicious. I was a bit worried as normally when making recipes from scratch I flop most times. But this recipe defies the odds. Only thing I added was some vanilla extract and they were very yummy!!!

These are delicious! I added dark chocolate chocolate chips and a teaspoon of vanilla, and they came out great! They are somewhere in between a muffin and a cupcake. I also did like the recipe said and put the powdered sugar on top. Delicious!

I really wanted to make these healthier.. But then it would be a muffin right? I followed as directed. The end result was fluffy and moist. However they were way to sweet. I left out the pecans and didn't bother with the dusting of sugar. I topped with a cream cheese icing. Also added vanilla about 1 tablespoon and 1/2 teaspoon salt.

This recipe is fantastic and delivers exactly what it promises! I have baked this several times using the recipe as is (without the pecan nuts) and several times with my own modifications and everyone loves them each time!

So easy and yummy. Didn't have buttermilk so used regular milk with lemon juice (just googled ratio up). Did not add nuts and used " fluffy peanut butter frosting" on top (http://allrecipes.com/recipe/84429/fluffy-peanut-butter-frosting/#recipe-toolbar). Turned out perfect

I wanted something light with a banana flavor, but these were more like banana bread than cupcakes. A good recipe for breakfast muffins, but not if you want cupcakes.

Thanks a lot for the recipe.  With three kids at home craving for something sweet these cupcakes have become our household staple. Also we make a modified version with a piece of chocolate inside.

These cupcakes were a complete hit.  They did not survive the night.  I did make a couple of changes based on previous reviews.  Reduced bananas and only used two.  Also reduced flour to 1 1/2 cups plus a box of banana cream instant pudding mix.  Also reduced sugar and only used 3/4 cup and it was just right.  Last modification was increased buttermilk to 5 Tbs.  Turned out light and fluffy.

I wanted a cupcake texture and this fit the bill.  The banana taste was very subtle -- a pro or con, depending on what you're looking for. I did not add nuts (to me, that puts  it into "muffin mode"). Am knocking off a star as the cooking temp and time seemed way off.  I ended up having to put these up to 350F after  waiting 25 mins at 300F  to bake -- they never rose  much. Lastly, because the banana taste is so subtle, a lemon frosting is a good contrast to enhance the flavor. (I think by themselves, too plain?) Enjoyed by all... Whoops!I did add 1/2 tsp vanilla extract and will do again. Followed recipe in all other ways....

Everyone that had one said they enjoyed it....I just don't know I'm a bit of a perfectionest and I would of liked them to be more fluffy, light and moist...probably my fault as I tend to overmix also, I added semi sweet choc., chips....probably will make them again.
T y for the recipe.

I added 6 oz. of apple sauce because the batter seemed too thick. It's possible I didn't have enough banana, I only had 2 large ones. (The recipe doesn't say what size )  I also didn't have any oil, so I used melted butter. They came out very moist , fluffy, and delicious!

If I could give this recipe more stars I would.  We love this recipe!  It has replaced my banana bread recipe.  This is light,  fluffy &  moist.  I dont use the icing and just sprinkle a few mini chips on top for the kids.  Absolutely love it. Thanks for sharing.

OMG, absolutely love this recipe. ... I forgot to beat the eggs first, but CHANGED NOTHING. these are amazing.  They smelled so good I couldn't wait to ice them. I used chocolate buttercream and they are so good. I have been looking for a banana cupcake recipe for ever. Thank you so much . These are as moist and fluffy as you said they would be. I will always use this recipe.

These were awesome. Made them for a play date with my kids and they were a big hit. The only modification I did was I made "buttermilk" with some vanilla Almond milk and a tablespoon of white vinegar and only used 3/4 cup of sugar and added 1 tablespoon of cinnamon and vanilla extract. I made a vanilla buttercream to go on top. Definitely making these again soon.

So good I surprised myself! I had an extra banana so I used it too but otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly. I filled the 12 cups 1/2 to 2/3 full and had enough batter left to make an 8" round cake which I baked for the same length of time. I topped them with vanilla buttercream and gave the cupcakes to friends who loved them. I will make this cake lots - delicious - and such a light, airy texture compared to a loaf.

These turned out amazing!  I made them for my husband's birthday (he doesn't like cake exactly and had asked for banana walnut bread).  The only things I changed were that I used walnuts instead of pecans and I added a cup of chocolate chips.  Also, for those who have the cultured buttermilk powder instead of the buttermilk, it's .75 tbsp. buttermilk powder and 3 tbsp water.  I had to look that up.

Pretty amazing cupcake recipe. I don't think I've ever made cupcakes this fluffy and light, and I've made a looooot of cupcakes.

I had to make a few changes based on what I had in my kitchen. I used 3tbps vanilla soymilk + just a bit of vinegar to replace the buttermilk, and I used 1 cup cake 1 cup all-purpose flour combo. I also threw in some leftover walnuts. 

This recipe is a keeper :) and I bet they'd be really really awesome with Nutella or cream cheese frosting!

This was a big hit with my students.  There were none leftover. I was able to make 12 regular size cupcakes and 24 mini cupcakes. I also made maple icing.  It was well received.

Awesome, the most delicious banana cupcakes I've made. I have an old recipe from my Mom and sometimes they would be good and others not so much.  This was great first time and every other since.  Definetly my go to from now on. Made a caramel creme frosting for them that was great together.

I used 6 tablespoons of evaporated milk plus 1/2 tsp. vinegar.(rested for 10 minutes)I also added 1 tsp. vanilla. These were great muffins. I had to put the little extra batter,the 13th and 14th muffin amount, ( ony had a 12 muffin pan) into a small pyrex dish and this cooked okay too.

Wonderful recipe!   did add some cinnamon and a little nutmeg because i like a little spice flavor in my banana bread/cake.  made them twice, once with cream cheese frosting (for a birthday party) and once without any frosting (more muffiny)  better as a treat for the grandkids with out the extra sugar of the frosting. Very light & moist, the banana taste will vary as to the size and age of the bananas you use, older (mushier) bananas work best. AND quick to make (helpful if your watching two babies & only have a few min. while they are napping - the 3 yr. old likes to help by mashing the bananas).  Thanks so Mari for posting this great recipe :)

I made these as written but doubled the recipe to make more. Doubled I got 36 full size cupcakes. They are moist and light like a cake. Mine did not fall. I was looking for a banana cake cupcake similar to the double banana cake recipe from bon appetite and this was great. I'm frosting them with a peanut and chocolate frosting both from this website. Thanks for a great and easy recipe

This recipe is great! So soft and light. I would probably put more banana to add more of the flavour (my preference). Also, I tried putting shredded coconut just to experiment and turned out nice too. Thank you for sharing this yummy recipe!! Next time I might try putting vanilla extract just as how other posters are recommending. :)

Hands down the best cupcakes I have ever had!  My mother, daughter and I love baking homemade cupcakes and icing.  We try a different flavor each time and these are the all around winner.  The are light, moist and have a great banana flavor.  We added chocolate chips and walnuts and frosted with a white chocolate buttercream frosting.  Delicious!

Cut the recipe in half for just my husband and I, and it was great. They were light and fluffy and not dense like muffins. I made a light glaze to put on top of them and it gave them just enough sweetness. Easy and tasty late night snack when you want something sweet without a lot of hassle. 

Only change I made was to reduce the oil, for half a recipe from 6T to 4T and used two small bananas, as that is all we had and used 1/2 brown and white sugar for extra flavor.

The flavour on this recipe was very pleasing. I am at a higher altitude, so if you are too, I would recommend swapping out the buttermilk for an equal amount of sour cream. At 300o these did not rise, so I made another batch at 325o for 18 minutes. They were a little better. I used chocolate fudge frosting. Delicious!

I just made this today and it is soooo good! I tweaked it a little bit. Instead of pecans, I used chocolate chips! Delicious! Thanks for sharing this! I love it!

Great recipe! 
I put white chocolate chunks in it, and of course because of that I had to add salt;  but this is a very versatile way of making cool stuff with soft fruit ( works for papaya- macadamia muffins too; right now, I have an experimental batch of pumpkin spice pecan cupcakes in the oven) . 
Thank you for posting this!

These were DE-LISH!  I used mini chocolate chips, instead of nuts, and frosted with Sour Cream Chocolate Frosting from this site.  Mmmmm.  Maybe a wee bit too chocolately with the thick frosting, if there could be such a thing.  Maybe a light chocolate glaze or ganache instead of a pile of frosting?  Then again, a certain time of the month a person might take hostages for these, frosted in chocolate!

This recipe is absolutely delicious!!! So moist. I just replaced the flour with whole wheat flour, and applesauce in place of the eggs for allergy reasons! I could not believe the great sweet taste! Great recipe!

This recipe is truly amazing. I've wanted a good recipe for banana cake, as sometimes you get tired of only using ripe bananas in muffins. I am going to top these with a homemade caramel frosting. Thank you for such a great recipe - great taste, great tender texture, just the right amount of sweetness and good banana flavor without being heavy.

Made these for a bake sale and managed to taste test one before I took them.  Wow, very nice! Not too sweet,  so if you wanted to add frosting (I recommend cream cheese frosting) they would still be delicious! Will definitely be making these again.

My granddaughter and I made these together and they were delicious.  Very moist.  She even added both eggs at the same time and they turned out fine.  We followed the recipe exactly except that we used cream cheese frosting.  Definitely a keeper.  Grandma R
