Made this last night; would say more like 3 and 1/2 stars but that's not an option. My husband really liked it but I thought it was a little bland. I used chicken broth instead of water and next time I'm thinking I'll add big onion slices with the green pepper...it was so tender but just felt it needed something to tip the scales so to speak. It was super easy and like I said...very tender.

This is a good italian beef recipe, the meat was very tender!  I froze part of it and ate it later and it was still good.  I even mixed it with some egg noodles to make beef and noodles to use up the left overs and it was delish!  Thanks!

Made this recipe with vension. Also added more green pepper and a can of beef broth. Served on a firmer bun with cheese. Even better the next day. Husband loved it. Could not tell it was vension at all.

I think this is a keeper, a nice flavor and meat that just pulls apart and is juicy. So easy to prepare and cook.

I followed the recipe except that I did not have any anise or sesame seeds.  So I added some Penzey's brand Italian seasoning and that gave it a really nice flavor.  The beef was even better reheated the next day.
