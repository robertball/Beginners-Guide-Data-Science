This is quite delicious. We're always happy to find a soup without meat because it is an appetizer for us. It's not too spicy for the kids and just spicy enough to keep you warm. I'll add a bit more quinoa the next time. Thank you for the recipe.

This soup is really good. I used white beans, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. Will be making this again and again.

I personally didn’t love the quinoa in this recipe.  The nutty flavor If the quinoa didn’t do it for me.  I would make this again as a vegetable soup though.

So good!  I followed the recipe exactly as written except I added about a third of a yellow bell pepper with the onions and a can of chickpeas (rinsed and drained) at the end.

Very tasty and hearty.  Did use 1/2 crushed red pepper and was spicy enough for me.

We love this soup!  Just the right amount of spice, although I don’t measure anything. If it gets too spicy for anyone they can stir in a dollop of sour cream. I love that I can sub out the chicken broth and use vegetable broth if I’m making it for my sister who is vegetarian?.
