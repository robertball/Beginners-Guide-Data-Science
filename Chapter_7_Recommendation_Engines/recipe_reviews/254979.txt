Tasty & easy, but 1 slice does NOT a serving make.  Very deceiving  portion size, since most folks would probably have 2 slices, so I doubt that 1 lrg. eggplant will yield 24 slices.  Nevertheless, it as very tasty.  I served it over spaghetti.  I always bake my eggplant slices instead of doing them in a frying pan, b/c they absorb cooking oil like a sponge, and that just adds to the calories & fat.

This is a very nice change from the usual parmigiana. I didn't fry the eggplant though. I baked them. Thank you for the recipe.
