LOVED THESE! I do have to say that you do not need 1 cup of flour or 1 cup of breadcrumbs. I used 1/3-1/2 cup of each and that was plenty. I used a mix of seasoned panko and regular seasoned breadcrumbs, which gave these an incredibly crunchy coating that I loved. As far as the sauce goes...2 Tbsps. of garlic powder to 3 Tbsps. of sour cream is too much, IMO, so I used the garlic powder to taste. Sprinkle the 'fries' with some salt, and you're good to go! A great, healthy alternative, that I will definitely be making again and again~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

I just saw this recipe less than an hour ago, and decided I had to try them now.  So I am eating them, and stopped just long enough to say, these are SO yummy good!!  My husband is loving them too, so I'd better write fast. :)  These are nice and crunchy outside, and very creamy inside.  I had everything in the house except for grated Parmesan, but I did have some shredded.  What I did was mix a handful of the shredded parm into the breadcrumbs.  They came ot delicious.  Will have these again Super Bowl Sunday for sure, and probably before that!  Thank you for the recipe. :)

I think the dip is very good as well.  I made it exactly as written, but sprinkled with cayenne pepper to serve.  Will make it again next time and also one of chunky red salsa and sour cream for different tastes.   Really great snack!

The fries were ok, but bland. The texture was very nice! They need some seasoning, or salt... anything. The freshly grated parmesan was the biggest redeeming factor, and should probably be added to the crumbs rather than sprinkled on top. 

The salsa s FAR too heavy on the garlic.

Took this to our family Easter party today and got rave reviews. The garlic in the dip can be a bit overpowering - my fiancé didn't care for the dip. Next time I will probably add half the amount of garlic powder. Overall, this was a unique, delicious and easy recipe!

I love avocado, thought I would love this, but wasn’t worth all the work.  I’d rather just dip raw avocado into the sauce.

My family and I really enjoyed this!  I did cut back on the garlic powder as recommended by other reviewers (I used about half).  I felt like the flavor of the tomatillo salsa was a little lost in the sour cream, so when I make it again, I think I will serve it with a variety of dipping sauces.  Sour Cream/Garlic dip, Sriracha Sauce (by itself), and tomatillo salsa (by itself). Overall, really different and SO yummy!
