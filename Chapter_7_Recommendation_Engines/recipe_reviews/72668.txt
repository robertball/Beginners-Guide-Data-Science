This is an easy salad, and I have had nothing but rave reviews everytime I have made it.  I leave out the apples as a personal preference.

I needed a salad for church dinner.   I almost had everything for this one.  I used spring mix/spinach, instead of dried crandberries, used dried blueberries, used diced granny smith instead of dried apples and slivered almonds..had light raspberry vinagrette..it was a hit!! Thanks so much! will make again... may try pecans...

This was OK but not anything I will try again. I cut up one fresh Golden Delicious apple instead of using the dried. Simple to prepare however.

Nice salad.  I liked the flavors.  I really didn't want to use raspberry vinaigrette, so I used a honey dressing I found elsewhere on the site.  It didn't really seem to need a strong flavored dressing; there are a lot of flavors in this salad.  Not competing, though; they go well together.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was really good. I didn't care much for the pine nuts though, so the next time I'll use something else. I used fresh apple since i didn't have the dried bits. Additional cheeses would be good too as well as some blueberries. Thanks for a great lunch.

Wonderful combination of ingredients in this salad.  First time I have ever used pine nuts.  This will make a great summer salad.  You could add grilled chicken or steak and make it a meal.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.

Really great salad and fairly simple to put together.  I left out the pine nuts by choice and then at the last minute I realized we didn't have an apple.  Even without those two ingredients it was great.  Probably will make it the same way next time.

Very good.  Perfect way to marry fruit and  lettuce based salad.  Pine nuts, cheese and strawberries compliment each other very well.

Delicious and so refreshing!! Couldn't be easier.  One change I made was to sub toasted walnuts for the pinenuts- they are just too expensive.  I truly don't believe that detracted from the flavors at all-just wonderful!  The hit of my Easter dinner!!

A very unique salad. I love fruit, I love feta so this was a great combination of flavors. I think the next time around I will do spinach lettuce instead. The only alterations I made is I used fresh apples instead of dried apples. It was a wonderful salad. It was the first time I had ever tried pine nuts too. They are very expensive so even almonds would make a great choice instead

Like others, I substituted fresh apple for dried, cashews for the pine nuts, and omitted the dried cranberries.  This is one of those recipes that you can add your favoties in terms of cheese, nuts, and fruit and it'll probably turn out every time.  Delish!

This was a wonderful tasting salad, and it looked beautiful as well! I made substitutions because they were all I had - leaf lettuce, a raw apple, and FF Feta.  I used Ken's FF Raspberry Pecan Dressing. I will definitely make this again.

I love the flavor combination. I also like to use goat cheese instead of feta sometimes. Any nuts will do.

Everyone raves about this salad! They think I'm such a creative cook, but I always give AllRecipes.com the credit!  I make it for family gatherings and covered dish dinners at church.  I've even had requests to bring it to up-coming dinners!  Thanks, AllRecipes.com for giving me a reputation of being a good cook because almost everything I make comes from your recipes!
