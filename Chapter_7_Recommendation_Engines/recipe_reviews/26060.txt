Hello fellow reviewers.  I'm not an experienced dump cake maker or eater, BUT, the 20 or 30 that I've had from pumpkin to berry have all been the same hence the word DUMP in the recipe title.  That's what makes this recipe such a wonderful thing.  You mix your ingrediants, put them in a dish, and then DUMP the cake part on top.  For the 1 star raters, if you MUST have a bottom to this DUMP cake and serve it on a plate, put some of the cake batter on the bottom of your dish.

Notes: Added extra cinnamon along with some nutmeg.  After all the wet ingredients are mixed and dumped into pan, use the same bowl without cleaning it out. Add vanilla cake mix and melted butter together. Mix till crumbs form and add chopped nuts.  Sprinkle all over cake. The crumb topping insures everything is adequately buttery and there is no pooling of butter.  Awesome. New recipe for T-day:)
Just made this for a second time and realized I only used a 15 oz. can of pumpkin the first time!!! It still was delicious and am making the same way this time too.

I make this often, and always get great results!  If I take it to work, it is gone by lunch!  For a shortcut, I use Pumpkin Pie Spice and I just slice 1/2 cup butter over the top with the pecans!  Comes out great every time! pp

my co-workers certainly enjoyed this concoction, but to call it a cake is missleading.  it's pumpkin pie filling with a crumb-cake topping.  that's it.  it doesn't turn into a cake in the oven (why did i think it would?) so if you want a twist on pumpkin pie, this is it.

This was one of the best dump cakes I have ever eaten, even my non-pumpkin liking husband loved it! 
I'm a diabetic so I played with the recipe a bit. I used 1/4 cup white sugar and 1/4 cup SPLENDA, 1/4 cup brown sugar and 1/4 cup SUGAR TWIN brown sugar replacement. I also used PET fat free canned milk and instead of using butter on the top I sprayed it with I CAN'T BELIEVE IT'S NOT BUTTER spray. It turned out fantastic.

This was very tasty, and smelled great while it was cooking.  Be sure to let it cool completely or you will have Pumpkin Dump Pudding!  Still tastes awesome though, nice change from pumpkin pie.  Top this with some whipped cream.

This was a wonderful fall dessert!  My co-workers raved about it.  Best served with Cool Whip.  Next time I will combine the dry cake mix and melted butter in a small bowl and crumble the mixture on top.  I had some dry cake portions on my first attempt that I didn't care for.

This was awsome!! Took it to a football party, and came home with an empty pan.  Here are the adjustments I made after reading other reviews. Used pumpkin pie filling to eliminate some steps with the spices.  Used more butter (about 1 cup melted) combined the dry cake mix with about 1/2 the melted butter to distribute evenly, then drizzled the rest over the top.  There weren't any dry bits after baking! Served with Cool Whip.

I make this recipe a lot.  In fact, if there is a pot luck of any sort in the fall or winter at my church, everyone pretty much expects me to bring it.  The only thing I do differently is that I use the pumpkin pie mix instead of the puree and cook it according to the recipe on the can.  For me, it saves time and money since I don't keep a lot of spices at my house.  This is also a great thing to make with kids since it just involves dumping and stirring.

Wow!  My husband wanted an alternative to traditional pumpkin pie.  He wanted something sweeter and without the crust, but loves the flavor.  I saw this and since we love cherry dump cake, I thought we'd try it.  It is very good, just what we were looking for, and so easy to make!  It smells and tastes great.  Great for Thanksgiving or Christmas parties for large groups.

Loved this dump cake.  I took advice from previous reviews and mixed the cake with the melted butter and gently pressed it into the pumpkin mix before baking.  50 minutes was perfect.  My bible study group devoured it.  Served it with homemade whip cream.  Plan on making for Thanksgiving also!  Like it better than pumpkin pie.

I just made this recipe and am so pleased with the results. I'm a big fan of dump cakes because they're so easy and pack so much flavor and texture. This is one that goes in the family favorite recipe book.

This is a time saver if you want pumpkin pie, but don't have time to make a crust. The crunchy topping is a nice change. Will make again.

This version of dump cake was great. I've tried the cherry pie filling/pineapple version before and it is way too sweet for me. However this one is just right.  I did make an interesting substitution though.  I was out of canned pumpkin, so used a 40 oz can of sweet potatoes, drained.  I just added the chunks of sweet potatoes to all the other ingredients and used an electric mixer to mash the sweet potatoes and mix everything at the same time.  I took it to a potluck dinner and got great reviews.  Thanks for the recipe!

About this cake...The bottom layer has the exact texture of pumpkin pie.  The top layer turns into a sort of crust. 

But this is important...You need to drizzle butter over almost every speck of cake powder or you will end up with areas of unbaked cake mix.  I suggest you melt 1 and a half cups of butter instead of the called for 1 cup.

Last night when I made this I almost came back with a negative review because I didn't like the way it tasted warm.  Today, after it had sat in the refridgerator all night I have a totally different opinion.  It is much better cold!

It was real good.  Not as easy to throw together as other dump cakes I have made in the past.  But worth the little extra effort.  Kinda tastes like a pumpkin pie with a crunch crust and the pecans add a pecan pie touch to it.  Served it with whipped topping.  Will make it again.  I am going to try to freeze some of it as it is just the two of us.  Mine looked just like the photo here.

This was delish!!! Super simple and perfect for a crowd.  I did omit the pecans, due to allergies, but otherwise followed the recipe perfectly.  Served with a side of whipped topping...yummy!  My only comment would be with the name....I told my guests that it was PUMPKIN CRISP, which they ooh-ed and aah-ed over.  When I told them the "real" name, they all agreed the Pumpkin Crisp suited it better.

DELICIOUS!  I don't know how anyone could give this a poor review, if you know what a "dump cake" is and that this  definitly is more like a pumpkin pie, without a crust, but with a delectable buttery topping!!  I used a can of Pumpkin Pie Filling (instead of using all the spices with a can of unsweetened pumpkin), 2 eggs and Fat Free Evaporated Milk for the filling, then 1 1/2 sticks butter on top of the spice cake (which I think MADE the recipe)!  It was a hit...if you like pumpkin pie, you WILL like this!!

BEWARE!! THIS IS NOT A CAKE. IT IS PUMPKIN PLOP!! IT IS QUICK AND EASY TO PREPARE AND TASTES OK BUT NOT GREAT. PREPARE TO SERVE IN A BOWL AND EAT WITH A SPOON.IF YOU WANT A REAL PUMPKIN CAKE RECIPE, CONTINUE YOUR SEARCH.

The whole family liked this, even DH who is not a pumpkin fan. Rather than melting the butter, I sliced it very thin and covered the nuts and cake mix. Tastes best cold with a dollop of sweetened whipped cream. A keeper! The people who rate this only 1-2 stars do not 'get' what a 'dump cake' is supposed to be. This recipe is a perfect example!

I followed this recipe to the letter, but after baking the cake mix was still dry under the butter that was drizzled over the entire top.  So, thinking I did something wrong, I made it again and had the same problem.  I have no idea why and would appreciate any help with it. Thanks.

I made it for a get together and everyone loved it. I did not have ginger, so I used 1 1/2 tsp of pumpkin pie spice and 1/4 tsp. cloves. I used butter cake mix and added pumpkin pie spice,  which i mixed with 1 1/2 sticks of melted butter, because i thought i read somebody said to use more butter. Not a good idea. Cake mix and butter became like cookie dough. (I added minced pecans) NOW- what do I do? I patted it together and covered all the pumpkin in the pan, which looked like a crust on top. Even with the mishap it turned out delicious.
EVERY ONE LOVED IT!

My school age kids loved it and that is high praise. I did have to substitute a white cake for the spice cake, because that is what was in the pantry. I sprinkled some pumpkin pie spice over the cake mix for the spice effect. I also omitted the pecans because the troop I fed doesn't like nuts. It was delicious. I'm making it for friends today and am going to follow the recipe exactly, but it's good to know that I can substitute and still get good results.

If you like pumpkin pie you will love this!  I made it exactly as written and it turned out very good.  Leftovers still good 2 days later.  Definitely use a spice cake mix.  I wonder how a graham cracker crust would be on the bottom but not sure I want to fool around with such a great recipe.

my new favorite. It takes a little more work than a fruit dump cake, but SOOOO worth it. Better than Pumpkin Pie, by far! The spice mix on top is an awesome twist. I added more butter to the cake mix to make it a little more crumbly instead of having dry spots on top.

I don't know what went wrong with this one. I ended up with a baking dish full of mushy pumpkin mix and a layer of uncooked dry cake mix. I checked the oven temp and it was correct. This was one dump cake I really had to dump!

Every just loved this, even people who do not like pumpkin.  Easy to make.  I used 4 teasp. pumpkin pie spices, yellow cake mix and increased the melted butter to 1 cup to cover entire cake.  I was asked to make it for Christmas!

The pumpkin flavor and spices did not come through very well.  The bottom was too mushy and the top part of cake mix did not cook evenly despite the butter being evenly sprinkled over it.  I set the oven at 350 degrees and baked for 55 minutes.  The cake came out very dark and almost burnt.  50 minutes is more than enough time at 350 degrees. I was not happy with the results and probably will not bake this again.

This wasn't like a cake at all, more like a really inferior upside-down pie, which I suspected when I saw the amount of pumpkin called for.  Next time I'll put my pumpkin to better use, either by making a real pie or my absolute all-time favorite pumpkin recipe, Maida Heatter's pumpkin gingerbread.  Now THAT'S a good recipe!!

This recipe is AWESOME.  I don't have any young children so didn't complete the "kid friendly rating".  The adult members of my family love this cake and I'm taking it to a pot luck dinner tonight.

I saw the recommendation to mix the spice cake mix and melted butter together (after I first baked this).  Great suggestion as I see dry cake mix showing on the top of my cake :(

This cake was very easy to prepare and smelled wonderful while cooking.I let the cake cool for about twenty minutes and then served it slightly warm with vanilla ice cream.  The crunchy, nutty topping really made this dish a hit with my family! This was a great twist on the old traditional pumpkin pie:)

This cake is better than Pumpkin Pie according to my family! I made it for our Thanksgiving dinner and now I have been asked to make it once again for our Christmas dinner. Only this time I am going to try a Carrot Cake mix instead of Spice Cake and see if makes a difference to it.
 This recipe is a sure test also to see if your oven is level!lol Mine wasn't but it was enjoyed by all.
 If you like your deserts a little warm this one is great to warm up in the microwave to eat the leftovers. Its great with a little whip cream on top and a spoon of Vanilla Ice Cream too!

I thought this would be a real winner based off the reviews and it wasn't at all. I even made two pans of it and brought it to a Halloween party. Only two people ate it. I thought it was ok but nothing special. It didn't look or sound too appealing. I ended up throwing a lot of it away. I guess I'll stick to real pumpkin pie next time.

I used white cake mix instead of the spiced cake and it still tasted great.  It tasted more like a coffee cake than a pumpkin pie.  The topping was delicious!

Serve it cold from fridge and it will firm up.
My Hawaiian cousins use yellow cake mix instead and flip it upside down onto a platter so the filling is on top. Then they mix softened  8 oz cream cheese with a tub of Cool Whip and smooth it over the top. It's  an island speciality,  called Pumpkin Crunch  Cake. Like extra delish dump cake with a fancy presentation.

We loved this recipe!  I've made dump cakes before and this pumpkin one is a nice change for pumpkin pie lovers.  I used a yellow cake mix because that is what I had on hand and used closer to 1 cup of butter to dizzle over the top.  As it is baking, if you see a little dry patch of cake mix on the top, put a tiny sliver of butter on the spot and it will blend in.  This is absolutely yummy with bit of whip cream.  A great holiday recipe that I will make again.

I followed the recipe verbatim. I could tell about half way through baking that the mix was not mixing with the pumpkin so I took it out and hand mixed it a bit, thus I ended up with an edible cake. 

Had I not, I would have ended up with pumpkin plop on the bottom and dry cake mix on the top. Oh, with burnt pecans... not sure how others get it to cook right with out mixing even a little..

Its like a crustless pumpkin pie with a topping. The flavor still needs more. But that's just me I'm not a big pumpkin fan anyhow.

Great flavor.  I had to cook this much longer than suggested though and had to add more butter to the top powdery layer towards the end to get it to cook evenly.

There was too much pumpkin filling, and the texture was not as firm as I'd like (even though I let it cool completely). Not really a cake - more like a pudding. The melted butter didn't spread evenly, leaving dry spots of cake mix. And the pecans BURNED, tasting bad and making the cake unattractive.  If you plan to make this, add the pecans during the last few minutes of baking, or as a garnish after cake cools.

This was excellent!!!  I will it make over and over.  I was worried that there wasn't enough butter on the top, so I melted another stick of butter over the top.  I bet it would have turned out fine according to the original recipe, but we loved the extra butter.  
MY TIPS FOR THIS RECIPE:  Better texture when allowed to cool (it solidfies more).  Once its cool, it cuts easily into nice squares.  If you try to serve it too hot, just like a pumpkin pie, it will be too wet.  If your top has browned too fast, try using an oven thermometer to make sure you oven is heating properly.  I don't think the negative reviews were fair at all, but everyone is entitled to their opinion.  Here's mine.. MMMMM!!!

Excellant!!  Friends and family really liked it and it was so easy. I did change the 1/2 cup of butter to 1-1/2 sticks as the cake didn't seem to have enough moisture.

My husband and I thought this was better than pumpkin pie will make over and over again. Just make sure you wet the dry cake mix on top with butter.

I have made this recipe twice for my Beta Sigma Phi chapter and it's been a hit every time.  I serve it with cinnamon ice cream.  I bring the leftover to work and it disappears quickly.  Very easy, very good if you like pumpkin pie.  I haven't had anyone who hasn't liked it.

I took this delicious pumpkin treat to a home fellowship potluck last night. It was loved! There were no kiddos there, but I'm voting, if they like pumpkin pie, they'll adore this! Ditto on the evenly sprinkled butter. I had a couple of dry spots, but it was still very yummy. Thanks so much!

This is one of the best pumpkin cakes around. I do not add the butter and cake mix to the top, I just mix everything a together all at once, pour it in a pan and then bake it. This year its our birthday cake.  This year I baked it in a bundt pan in our toaster oven, hopefully all goes well.

I’ve made this 4 times now and each time it’s fantastic. The only thing different I do is leave out the butter and pour diet soda on top of the cake mix instead. This makes the cake-mix super moist and removes the calories from butter. 

I’m shocked people give this a negative review. It’s really a fantastic replacement for pumpkin pie.

This is delicious, and the best part it is easy. I did mix the cake mix and butter together before spreading it on top of the pumpkin mixture, and it turned out perfect!

I made this for a dinner party that we were having and it was a big hit! Very moist and SOO easy to make.  It reminded me of a pumpkin pie without the crust and the spice cake and pecan part was delicious! Thanks for sharing this.

Exact same recipe as my grandmother's. I used pumpkin pie spice instead of the spices. My nephew said it tastes like chai latte. There is non left.

This is really good.  I didn't have a spice cake mix so I used a carrot cake mix instead and added about 1-1 1/2 tsp of pumpkin pie spice to it.  Turned out really good.  It tastes like a pumpkin pie (it sort of has that consistency on the bottom, too) with a crunchy topping.  I will make this recipe again.

I used Walnuts instead of Pecans, only because that is what I had.  Still worked out great.  I added more spices since I didn't have spice cake on hand.  I used yellow cake mix instead.  Tasted great.

I've tried several pumpkin dump cakes and most are more "cake-like."  From the recipe and reviews, this sounded to be more "custard-like" and it was.  LOVED IT!  I don't like nuts so I omitted them, added some more of the spices and nutmeg, too, and I did what others suggested, mixing the melted butter with the cake mix first and it was great!  I would definitely consider making this in lieu of a pumpkin pie.

I use this recipe often.   I very rarely use canned pumpkin.  I use fresh pumpkin or frozen from the garden.  I have the pumpkin puree bagged in 2 and 3 cup amounts and normally do this recipe with 3 cups fresh pumpkin.    I normally toss the cake mix on top, then drizzle the butter, then use butter spray to spritz the crumbs that didn't get any drizzled butter.  Today tried the method of just mixing the butter with the cake mix and love it!   Little different appearance, but taste is great.  After the first function I went to taking this recipe, I don't get to make much of anything else, its begged for!    I use the same bowl for all the mixing, heck with extra dishes!

I had to used canned pie filling pumpkin because that was all there was at the store.  I think that came with sugar, so the added sugar from the recipe made the dessert too sweet for me.  I will try again when plain pumpkin is available.

This recipe is great.  It is super simple and taste great.  I am still craving it even after my husband and I finished the 9x13 inch cake/pie. If you are going to family's house for Thanksgiving and are responsible for desert take this one, everyone will enjoy.  P.S. Don't change the recipe, it is delicious just the way it is.  Thanks for sharing Carolyn!

Was going through my recipe box and found I never rated this one. GREAT RECIPE! I used a white cake mix because I didn't have spice and it was just lovely. It was very sweet (not too sweet) and looked great. I've made it about a half dozen times. Love this recipe.

This is a great alternative to traditional pumpkin pie.  Be sure to let it cool completely, though, it is much more flavorful that way.  I will definitely make this for the holidays this year!

I loved it! I used a cinnamon swirl cake instead of the spice cake mix and it turned out great! Right before taking it out of the oven, I put some marshmallows on top and let them get golden. I like this dump cake better than pumpkin pie!

Just has this tonight and it was SOOOO good.  My family is a huge fan of pineapple cherry dump cake and I plan to surprise them at Thanksgiving with this new twist on a great cake.  The one I had used yellow cake, but might try chocolate as one reviewer did and also the original spice cake version.  Oh, my goodness, I'm going for seconds right now!!

I have made this cake several times for pot lucks because it goes over so well.  Everyone loves it.  I have been playing with sugar alternatives since I need to watch that now.  Thank you for the great recipe.

I made this cake about a month ago but forgot to rate it at that time. The only problem I had was finding the spice cake mix. I used the recipe exactly as written. Very Good! Thanks for the recipe.

My new 'Pumpkin Pie' for the holidays.  Nobody likes pie crust, even if I make it from scratch, so this fits the bill.  Hubby was especially happy and pumpkin pie is his favorite.

it was ok, but the pumpkin filling could stand a little doctoring. i feel that if you cut the amount of filling by 1/3 or 1/2 it would be quite good. also, i suggest, instead of pouring melted butter, which invariably results in uneven distribution because of the nooks and crannies of the dry mix crumbles, that you simply slice up the butter and lay them over the top evenly. this seems to work better for me.

Discovered that I had Pumpkin Pie Mix instead of Pumpkin Puree, so changed the recipe to accommodate as follows:  2/3 c  evaporated milk, 1/2 the amounts of ginger, cinnamon,  cloves and salt and NO sugars. Increased the nuts to 3/4 c and increased the butter to 3/4 c. I lightly mixed 1/2 the cake mix with the pumpkin mixture once it was in the pan and then sprinkled the rest on top and drizzled the butter over it. My husband said it was the best pumpkin dessert he's ever had. I'll be continuing to make it this way.

This was very flavorful. It is more like an upside down pumpkin pie. Mine was not cake consistency at all. When you cut into it the pumpkin is on the bottom. But again it is good. I don't trust the word "dump" in food anyways. Would only make again if someone requests it.

Terrific! My family loves this. You do have to be careful that the package cake is covered with the melted butter so that some of the "powder" doesn't show after being baked. It's delicious anyway if you see a tiny bit of that.
I've been making different kinds of dump cakes for years. They're easy and great.

I'd actually call this a pumpkin PIE dump cake...the combination of cake/pie is incredible.  My husband told me to scrap the pumpkin pie for Thanksgiving and go with this instead.  He absolutely loved it...with vanilla ice cream on top! WIN!!!  Will definitely be a fall favorite.

I made one substitution.  I used half & half instead of evaporated milk because that is what I had.  I like dump cakes even though they really aren’t very cake like.  I think they’re more like a crisp than a cake.  Anyway i thought it was very tasty, especially warm.

I made this for a large group. The consensus was it's like pumpkin pie without the crust, more of a crumb topping. I omitted the nuts due to a allergy. Served with whipped cream. Next time, I will buy ice cream which was requested by several people. I will definitely make it again. It's a easy dessert to prepare.

Added extra spice to suit our family.  Took advice from reviews, and Melt butter with dry ingredients for a much nicer topping, and no dried cake mix on top as in past attempts

Took another Cooks advice and cut the butter in with a cheese grater holding the Frozen stick of butter and grating it right into the cake mix . This much more evenly spread the butter. Cooked for about 40 minutes and then put melted butter on exposed cake mix areas. Made a lovely delicious crust.

This is delicious. The only change I make is to use a full cup of melted butter. Because, butter! It crisps up the topping and makes it extra decadent. I also call this recipe Pumpkin Crumble Delight when I serve it, because who wants to eat something with the word ‘dump’ in it?

I like this recipe, but at least above 6500 feet, you need to treat the the cake like a pumpkin pie. Bake for 25 minutes at 425 Degrees and then turn down to 375, for remainder of the time.

I made ths according to the recipe, however, did decrease a little of the sugar.  My friends loved it!  The men wanted the recipe - so I know it was well received.  I would make this again.  It's a great Fall dish.

I made it  and have re read the recipe 5 times.  I made it exactly by  the recipe but the cake mix just sat on top just as it came out of the box.

This is perfect exactly the way it is presented. 
I did not use nuts and I would use a bit more butter.
Keeps wonderfully in fridge if you have any left.

Perfect.  I did a trial run a week before Thanksgiving.  Loved it.  Family wants this instead of pumpkin pie.  So much easier. I did cut my butter into the cake mix to insure  even coverage. I wonder if the reviewers that had a problem with this setting up, used only 1 can of pumpkin instead 2 cans of pumpkin. The recipe calls for 29 oz. or they may have used the pie filling instead of puree..

The pumpkin layer needed nutmeg and more sugar. Still, with a fork dip of whipped cream with each bite, it was fine.

omg I loved this! I went a little heavy on all of the spices and it gave it a little boost on the flavor. I also used Truvia instead of the white sugar (3.5 tablespoons). Maybe that's why, but mine didn't seem to get cooked all the way to the bottom of the pumpkin mixture - the very bottom 1/4 inch layer is more like pumpkin pie texture than cake, like in the picture. But you know what? It's still awesome!

Very good!  The only thing I added to the pumpkin mix was 1/4 tsp nutmeg.  The cake on top was a little thick, I had to use about 1/2 stick butter more than called for to cover the dry spots.  The filling was good, but could have used a little more flavor.  the Topping was AMAZING and made the dump cake.  Took this to a party and got alot of compliments on it, thank you for sharing!

This was really good!  I had tried something like this a couple years ago at a work pot-luck, but never got the recipe from that coworker.  After looking at several recipes, I thought this one might be it, and it was close enough!  The only thing I changed- I used a yellow cake mix instead of the spice cake.  It turned out great!  I'll be making it again (my husband has already requested it).

Yum yum yum!!  This is a great recipe, and immediately made it to my husband's favorite list.  I agree with previous posts--cut the spices and use a large can of pumpkin pie mix in place of the pureed pumpkin and spices.  It makes it even easier!  (BUT, the recipe is absolutely PERFECT the way it is!)

3 stars might be a little harsh on this recipe.  Brought this to a family gathering and everyone said they really liked it; however, I was a bit disappointed.  Although I am probably unfairly comparing it to another recipe that has a pumpkin mixure as the filling and a spice cake as a topping.  The other recipe that I have tried uses sweetened condensed milk and cream cheese.  It is far superior.. but with all the extra fat and calories why would it not be. I just thought this recipe was good, but not great.

Ok, I gave this recipe four stars because it was very good, but I have to say that it was not exactly what I expected.  This is not "cake-like" at all.  The bottom layer has the flavor and texture of pumpkin pie, and the top layer has a crunchy texture.  I actually liked this recipe very much, but I wish I hadn't told me guests it was a cake.  The texture/flavor combinations reminded me of sweet potato casserole, only with pumpkin instead of sweet potatoes.

The first time I made this, it was for a meeting and people loved it!  I used a plain yellow cake in place of a spice cake and added a little extra spice in the pumpkin mixture.  People still talk about it, and one friend even sent it to her grandmother, the master cook!

Very easy. If you want to make it healthier, use 5-6 oz. whole raw milk instead of the condensed and add an extra egg. And of course use raw sugar or honey in 1/2 the amount of sugar that is called for. That worked great and it was a crowd pleaser.

Great and easy dessert. I used a pineapple cake mix instead of spice, and I decreased the spices listed and added a little cardamon, which brightened it up a little. Yummy. Was asked for the recipe by guests.

This was very good and very easy.  I used yellow cake instead of spice since that's what I had on hand.  Overall, a good recipe to have on hand when you don't have a lot of prep time.

Since I don't care for spice cake I used a Chocolet fudge cake instead and it was wonderful.

I improvised and used a white cake instead of a spice cake.  I also used butter that was salted .
all other instructions I followed correctly. This cake was sweet and salty. I did not like at all. I'm sure it is teriffic with the spice cake and unsalted butter!

Yum!  My husband I really liked this recipe.  I took the rest of the pan to work and it quickly disappeared. My co-workers weren't very fond of the name so we decided to call it 'Crustless Pumpkin Struessel Pie'.  I think it would also make a great pie with the crust.  I'll have to try that next time...
