I was afraid this pie would taste like "cool whip", so I added a brick of cream cheese.  Use room temp cream cheese, whip it until it is creamy.  Slowly add the sweet condensed milk and whip until completely smooth.  Then continue with the recipe.  I will definitely use two bricks of cream cheese and use a 12 oz container of cool whip instead of the 16 oz.  Cutting down on the cool whip and adding the cream cheese will give it a more "homemade - less plasticy" flavor.  I would also suggest adding the lemon zest of the lemon. UPDATE: Although I thought this deserved 3 stars, I did take two of these pies to a party and EVERYBODY LOVED them.  I used the no roll crust recipe from this site and people thought is was a special macademia nut crust!

Great recipe! Could not believe how simple it was to make and how good it was. My husband and daughter are fans of it also. I made mine in a casserole dish instead of the 2 pie shells. I used the homemade graham cracker crust recipe from this site for the bottom layer. I also left out the lemon because my husband is not a big fan of sour things. I will definitely make this again. Also I did not freeze it. It never made it past the fridge and was great each day until it was all gone.

Instead of making 2 pies, I made a graham cracker crust in the bottom of a 9x13 and placed the filling on top. I also sprinkled toasted coconut on top. These bars were a hit and the coconut added to both the looks and taste!

This was a HUGE hit at Christmas last year. I made it with a graham cracker crust and added 1/2 cup of chopped walnut to the listed ingredients...delicious! Everyone wanted the recipe, but I told them it was a family secret recipe.  lol

Quick, easy recipe.  I used grated lemon peel and beat 8 oz cream cheese with the sw. condensed milk as others suggested before adding the whipped topping and it was delicious.  I used the "Easy Pie Crust" recipe on this site and it made a wonderful hot weather dessert.

This pie is SOOOO good and really easy to make, although it doesn't taste like it is this simple!! I made it the first time exactly as stated in the recipe and I have since made it three or four times after that and it is always fast and GOOD!

This recipe is so easy and tasty! It takes longer to shop for the ingredients than to make the pie! I love sweetened condensed milk in anything! The lemon juice is a nice counter point to the sweetness of the pie. Graham cracker crust is my favorite!

Made this as a dessert for Father's Day.  My husband and kids love, love it!  We will definitely make it in the future.  I made the first one with just pineapple.  The second one I made with pineapple and diced up mandarin oranges.  Yum, yum.

Really a tasty pie. I was pleasantly surprised. I topped the edge with pineapple chunks and the center with toasted coconut & sliced almonds. I made the crust out of crushed coconut cookies.
