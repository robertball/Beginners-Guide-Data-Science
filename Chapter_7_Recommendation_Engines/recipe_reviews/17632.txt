This isn't welsh rarebit, or at least nothing like the welsh rarebit I so loved as a child in Wales.

This is really a yummy munch.  It's great with a dash of Tabasco sauce.  My husband loves this while watching wrestling.

This is a recipe for what I grew up calling a "Blushing Bunny" made by my very English grandmother, from her nursery days! Very good, but for a true rarebit/rabbit, leave out the tomato soup. Four stars, since the name is rather misleading.

This is no a welsh rarebit.  It is a tomato rarebit.  Big difference

Yep, 5 stars.   Its the total nostalgia factor.   This is the very recipe we ate as children in the 60's.  Our favorite warm up lunch after a hard morning of sledding, hot and steamy served over saltines.  Takes me right back to mom's kitchen.  We may have used a little more cheese, and knowing my mom it was "rat cheese"  super strong aged cheddar. 
Thanks for sharing this

Just okay.  It doesn't look very appealing (kind of like pumpkin pie before it sets). The taste is alright but not fantastic.  I probably won't make this again.

This had good flavor, although not really sure what this is.  I had to look up some other recipes to see how to eat it.  Some said to serve over toast, others said to eat with crackers, like a dip.  We chose to eat with crackers.

I usually bump up the milk and cheese to make it creamier and cheesier.
