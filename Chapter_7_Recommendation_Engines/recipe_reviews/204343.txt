If you're watching your carb intake, this is a good recipe to substitute cauliflower for the potatoes. I actually prefer this soup with the cauliflower over the potatoes. To cut the fat/calories, using half (or more) the amount fat free evaporated milk and replacing the other half (or more) with organic chicken broth is really good, too. I do saute a couple cloves of minced garlic in with the onion and I'll shake in a little red pepper flake.

Made as is, this is delicious. I didn't cook my potatoes ahead of time, I just threw them in with the sausage and the corn to simmer. I also used skim milk, and it thickened up nicely. Aside from the entire stick of butter or margarine and the entire pound of sausage, this is a pretty healthy meal, you know, not counting these two variables...lol. Next time I'll omit the salt, as the sausage makes it salty enough, and I'll try a reduced fat smoked sausage. With all that said, this is one cheap, delicious meal.

DELICIFABULOSITY!  I made this yesterday, and it is now number 1 favorite of my family.  I can't believe how much flavor it has, and am glad I doubled it.  Being that New Orleans leads the title, I had to add a pinch of crushed red pepper, a dash of cayenne, and a heaping tsp. of Creole seasoning, Tony Chachere's original since my husband brought it home from New Orleans recently.  I read reviews and also added 4 cloves of garlic since I doubled, and a 12 ounce bag of jumbo cooked, peeled and deveined shrimp.  I threw in uncooked unpeeled potatoes and the frozen shrimp and frozen corn and simmered it for 30 minutes and it was just perfect.  This one's a keeper!

Mmmm... I'm eating my second bowl as I type.  It's so delicious.  Like the prior poster, I added the potatoes, uncooked, in with the sausage and corn. I also added 2 cloves of minced garlic with the onion, and I omitted the salt. Yummy!

This was delicious.  I did change it up a bit because it was kind of bland. As suggested by prior reviews I added quite a bit of Tony's.  Also I fried the sausage in a pan and used the fat to sautee the onions and make the rue.  This eliminated the need for so much butter.  I also used more potatoes to make it more filling.  Served with warm French bread...it was ummy yummy!!!!

Delicious, I did add my own changes, used canned milk with a little added water, I short on milk, it worked great, frozen sweet white corn, cooked the potatoes as suggested with the Bisque.  My husband said he liked it a lot.  I used red pepper and we also enjoyed a little hot sauce.

I have never written a review on any of the recipes I have gotten from this sight and I use one alteast everyday. I have to say something about this dish. This recipe was fantastic!! I added 2 cloves of chopped garlic and omitted the potato(only because I didnt have any). I also added 1 tsp of cajun seasoning, other than that I followed the recipe. I could have eaten the entire pot myself. My 12 year old extremely picky daughter liked it also. I will most definately make this again and pass the recipe along to others.

Very yummy. I fed my family this and they loved it. Especially on this snowy night. This meal was made on a budget and good. I used the suggestion to cook the sausage and use the fat from that to make the rue. We will be making this meal again very soon. Thank you.

This is a great recipe.  I did as others suggested and used frozen corn instead of canned corn.  I also used 3/4 tsp of Tony Chachere's Creole Seasoning rather than the salt.  I cooked it the first time for a company luncheon and there wasn't a drop left.  Huge success.

Made this last night and it will be a keeper! To reduce fat and calories I used light butter and turkey sausage. I threw the cubed potatoes in raw (peeling left on) and used a 12 oz. bag of frozen sweet corn.  It was a little lacking in flavor (probably because I used the turkey sausage instead of smoked sausage) so I added some Tiger Seasoning and fresh ground black pepper. Simmered for about 30 minues and it was perfect on a cool Fall evening!

Hubby took the leftovers to work and was very happy, said it was the best he's ever had. He crumbled corn bread in it to thicken it up after reheating in a microwave. I will make this again and again. Easy and quick to make.

Because many reviewers thought this was bland, I added about a teaspoon of Cajun seasoning, and 1/4 tsp. of smoked paprika to enhance the smoky flavor of the sausage.  We thought it was a very good soup that way.

We were amazed at how delicious this is!  And very economical!  I just ate some of the leftovers, and they were even better.  My 10 year old hates soup (yet eats anything else under the sun) went back for 2nds.  Yum!

Rating three because without changes this was vary bland even with using conecuh brand sausage that has a wonderful flavor. Followed recipe until end, tasted final product and had to do what other reviewers mentioned, added tony's and other seasonings to give it more flavor.

My husband loves anything with smoked sausage in it, so this was a hit.  I used fresh corn shucked off the cob which added sweetness.  We also added 3/4t of Cajun seasoning instead of the salt.  Frying up the sausage pieces would have been a nice touch too.

We loved this recipe!  I used venison sausage in place of the Hillshire Farms sausage and the flavor was amazing!  Also added a tsp. of Tony Chachere's cajun seasoning for extra flavor.  My family went back for seconds!

OMG!!! This is the best.  I am living with a poor man's kitchen so I had to improvise.  I used a combination of green and white chopped onions, Green Giant Corn Nibbletts with Butter Sauce (frozen), Spicy Smoked Sausage Links, and New Potatoes.  Other than that I followed the recipe exactly as written.  The results were really good.  However I think I will saute the sausage first and add more corn.

After creating the sauce as the directions state, I put it all in the slow cooker (on High) for 4 hours. I also added a little garlic as others suggested. At the end, I wanted to add some vegetables so I added a few green beans to the mix. Before serving, I added cheddar cheese and hand mixed in.

You can't go wrong! We loved it and plan to add it to our slow cooker recipes!

This was really good.  It had great flavor and was hearty.  I added the sausage (used turkey sausage) in with the onion after it had already softened.  I used 1% milk and 2 cups of frozen corn.  The whole fam liked this one.  I will probably make it again.

New family favorite! I browned the smoked sausage in the pan then removed it to melt the butter and cook the onions. Just to add that extra depth of flavor. This recipe was so delicious and it is easy to change up some. Use different sausages (andouille would be awesome!), add garlic, cajun seasoning, etc. whatever your family likes. Serve with a good sweet cornbread. YUMMY!

I thought it would have been thicker, next time I would add more potatos.  We used the turkey smoked sausage and it was fine.

I made this as written the first time and it was good. This last time I made it I used half chicken broth and milk. I added chopped celery and carrots to bump up the veggies and added a clove of minced garlic when sauteing the veggies. We liked the additions. I will be making this again.

Very good, except one thing... how you gonna use "New Orleans" in the title without some cajun kick?  I deleted the salt and subbed in a few hearty shakes of Tony Chachere's creole seasoning and a few shakes of cajun spice... I sauteed the sliced sausage along with the onions, and I used canned potatoes for ease.  This came together so quickly and tasted so great that I am sure I will make this many many times!  Oh yeah, and you can skip totally skip the cheddar cheese on top... I tried it both ways and it was just as good without it!

I think this has a lot of potential. I followed the reviews and added more chicken broth. It was still a little bland and had a there was a strong flour taste. I will try again with more chicken broth and additional seasonings to cut the flour. Great idea.

Update to my original review.  As written, the recipe is indeed very bland, but an excellent base to work with.  This is what I did when I revisited it and my family raved about it- I cut the butter to 2 tblsp and cooked my sausage with the onions and added fresh chopped garlic.  I also added finely shredded carrots to the mix before adding the flour.  Replaced 1cup of milk with chicken broth. Omitted the salt and pepper, seasoned with dried oregano, thyme and basil. and a good healthy shake of Cajun seasoning.  Did not precook the potatoes, added them at the same time I added the corn and simmered till it was tenders.  Mixed in about a cup of cheddar cheese and served!

No self-respecting NOLA food lover would ever start out a recipe with just onions in butter - ya gotta start with a trinity (onions, green peppers and celery). Since so many others mentioned how bland the base was I used half Hillshire sausage and half andouille. Still bland so lots of Tony Chachere, black and red pepper was added. I used 2 cups of half and half and 1 cup each of water and chicken broth. We'll have this again - thanks for the recipe.

This recipe was awesome. I used Johnsonville jalapeno and cheese smoked sausage. We also added creole seasoning and used half chicken broth instead of milk. I followed others by browning sliced sausage and cut the amount of butter in half. Thickened up well and had a spicy kick to it! Superb!

Wow this was good! I made a couple changes...I made a blonde roux with flour and oil first and omitted the butter. I also used half of the milk and used 2 cups of chicken broth in its place. And most importantly...I added lots of cajun spice seasoning and cayenne pepper...it would be very bland without. I give this recipe a 5++ when you add the seasonings! Yum!

This is a delicious dish.  I changed it up a little bit by rendering some bacon (about 4 strips) first....frying it until very crisp.....I removed the crisp bacon (and reserved it) and then followed the recipe as it said....instead of sprinkling parsley or cheddar cheese on the finished product I opted to sprinkle the leftover crispy bacon pieces......DELICIOUS

Made it yesterday, gone today. I made it with what I had on hand. Leftover shrimp kabobs(shrimp,onions&zucchini). Grilled corn on the cob. Sauted a large onion in butter with fresh garlic and 2 stalks of celery. 2 cups cubed red skin potatoes, raw. 4 cups skim milk. 1 package smoked sausage, fried whole in a little evoo. Just so it gets a little brown mark on it, then sliced. Crushed red pepper flakes to taste. Salt, pepper and a little Emeril "bam", always on hand.After everything was together, added 1 can cream of corn and 1/2 bag frozen corn and leftovers. Brought to a slow roll and let it cooked for a couple of hours low and slow. Really was a delicious bowl of chowder. I will make it again for a up coming house party. I'll see how it goes over. But not a waste of time to do.  Excellent base recipe to use and create your own.

My family loves this recipe.  We eat it all the time.  I doubled everything in the recipe but the meat which I slice then quarter.  I also omit the salt and pepper and instead use a cajun seasoning.  Also for the corn I use one can cream style and one can regular.  this is a soup that tastes better the second day so you could make it ahead of time too.

Ok, for the record I really hate to read recipes that have been changed so much that it's a different recipe. So having said that.. I guess I'm a bigot! I had taken out chicken for dinner and needed to cook it. So I boiled the seasoned chicken and deboned. I cooked the potatoes in the broth. Then followed the recipe. However, I can't drink milk so I used the chicken broth instead of milk. I took the advice of other reviews and added Tony's Catchere's Cajun seasonings for the salt and pepper. Like other had written this was excellent! The color was foggy much like Fog Water Stew. My family really enjoyed it. Thanks for the recipe Hillshire Farms.

As written, this recipe just didn't taste "new orleans-y" to me.  I made the recipe as written, except, like others, I added the potatoes with the corn and sausage.  I tasted it, thought it was pretty bland, and then added some cajun seasoning.  I think using andouille sausage would pep this recipe up a bit.

I don’t like spicy food so I’m not sure why I even tried this recipe but it was sooo yummy – and my husband loved it!  I used the Tony Chachere’s Creole Seasoning that a reviewer suggested and it was wonderful.  Next time I will try it with shrimp as another reviewer suggested.  I do recommend that you have all of your ingredients ready and waiting because you will be doing a lot of stirring – but so worth it!!!

Family loved this-- I used sweet potatoes because that's all I had and I will definitely use them again.  I peeled and cubed them, then nuked them for about 5 minutes in water, just to make sure they would cook all the way.  The soup ended up simmering about 20 minutes.  I'm going to send it to all of my mom friends!

It was good for a Cajun style dish. The sausage and corn combo together was nice. I feel there needed to be more flavor for the most part. Maybe added a bit more seasonings. Cheese on top was great especially when melted on top the diced potatoes.

Phenomenal! I added a pinch of paprika and cayenne, after all it is "New Orleans"! It is very flavorable and was a big hit. I did skip the potatoes simply because I didn't have any but they were not necessary. I also used a hilshire "cheddar wurst" smoked sausage.

Next time, we'll brown the sausage to add some crispiness.  We added red pepper flakes, paprika, garlic powder, and cayenne pepper for some spice and flavor.

This soup is very tasty although I found it needed A LOT of seasoning. In my case, I added garlic, thyme and extra salt and pepper. I used half and half and chicken stock for the base. Also added diced carrots for a little color. Super easy and very good!

Yummy!  I used frozen corn and fat free half and half, and didn't cook the potatoes first, as I had plenty of time.  Getting ready to eat the leftovers for lunch, but might have to make a double batch the next time ... wasn't much left!  Probably ought to use a turkey or low fat smoked sausage the next time, just to get rid of a little of the "guilt" factor.   A little green pepper might be nice for a little extra color and flavor.  I love making soup, and will be making this one again soon!

Probably the best bisque I've ever had. Made no changes to the recipe. Served with shredded cheddar cheese. Had a green salad and toasted garlic bread on the side.

Great recipe as is, but made just a few adjustments for our family's taste. Added 3 cloves of minced garlic with the onion. Instead of using all milk, used 2 cups chicken broth and 2 cups milk. Also added some fresh thyme, which really added to the flavor on the broth. Very quick and easy.

I made this with Mexican chorizo sausage, and wow, was it good! I browned the sausage with onion and a couple cloves of minced garlic as another cook suggested; used the fat from that to make the roux,and omitted the salt and pepper. Getting into mthe "southwestern" feeling, I also added a can of black beans. It was a big hit, even with my  son who doesn't care for any form of sausage. And while I was loooking forward to bringing some to work for lunch, there weren't any leftovers. Have to double the recipe next time!

This is one of those recipes you can play with and really cut back the calories while maintaining a good dish.  I used the Hillshire 50% less fat sausage.  Also only 2 Tb. of Butter, and 3 TB. of flour.  Replaced 12 oz. of the milk with chicken broth, and used low fat milk.  Still delicious and much lower in calories.  Good quick meal.  Thanks

This bisque overall sounded strange to me, but we tried it anyway. It was really good, but actually better the next day after the flavors had longer to meld. I think in the future I'll make it the night before, then put into containers for lunches for a few days.

We didn't like the salty, smoky sausage flavor mixed with the sweet milk. I'm all for trying different combination's, (and it didn't seem odd at all at the time!) but this one just fell flat.

Pretty good recipe.  I used turkey kielbasa instead of pork, 1% milk, and light butter to lighten it up a bit.  I'll probably make this again.  My husband didn't really care for it, but he usually doesn't much care for creamy soups.

This was absolutely delicious. I let the potatoes cook in the broth and left the sausages whole until the soup thickened up. They stay juicier this way! I will definitely make again.

Fantastic recipe!  Absolutely delicious and my husband even liked it too.  I sauteed diced celery along with the onions for a touch of different flavor and also color.  A refreshing change from the standard corn chowder.  I also like that it is super thick and creamy without having to use cream.

When I see "New Orleans" I usually think of spicy which this is not--and I like that.  I followed recipe per what I had on hand.  After cubing sausage I did heat it up in separate pan while butter/onion were sauteeing-and added it to recipe when called for. (I think this helps bring out the flavor of sausaage, and eliminate much of the grease from the sausage too).  The only addition I made was 2 small cloves of garlic, but that's because I add garlic to most recipes. I also did not have raw potatoes on hand so I substituted canned potatoes and cubed them.  This is a filling, stick to the bones kind of recipe for chilly days.  I think it was good, but if you like a lot of seasoning, you may want to add something more to it.  I will make this again, as my 3 yr old son who doesn't like his food touching is even eating it up.

Delicious, fast and easy - loved it! Important hint: Brown the cubed sausage at med-high heat for a few minutes, turning often to brown all sides. This really brings out the sweet-smoky flavor. Taking others' suggestions, I added a clove of minced garlic when sauteing the onions, and didn't pre-cook the potatoes - just threw everything in the pot when adding the milk. I didn't have canned corn, so used frozen. So much more flavorful than chicken corn chowder. Served with crusty bread - nothing else needed for a yummy and fast weeknight dinner!

I love this (haven't brought myself to share it w/hubby yet : ) - used turkey kielbasa, 1 bunch of scallions, frozen corn, chopped carrots, generous dashes of creole seasoning, and omitted potatoes. Strangely, I think sprinkling the cheese on just before eating really makes this dish. Inexpensive to make, easy and ultimate comfort food!

It wasn't phenomenal. It wasn't bad. I've had much better corn chowders/bisques before- but I've never made one. Compared to those, this was ok. However, it was very very easy to make and it tasted pretty good - so I gave it 3 stars.

This was awesome.  I had no leftovers.  I did just a few things different.  I cooked the sausage with the onions to brown it a bit and then I used canned diced potatoes to save time.  Can't wait to make this again.  I will probably double it to have leftovers.

Fantastic!  I couldn't believe the way it thickened up - even when I used skim milk!  I added a little bit of creole seasoning as other people seemed to think it was bland.  I don't know that it really needed any extra seasoning for me.  I used turkey sausage, sliced and then halved.  The smoky flavor came through giving it plenty of flavor.  Like other reviewers, I cooked the potatoes along with the onion and sausage.  It came together quickly and disappeared in no time as well!

My family loved this soup - so much so that I only got one bowl!  I used what I had on hand: a combination of fat free evaporated milk, chicken broth, and skim milk (probably about 6 cups total), 1 can each creamed corn and whole kernel corn, about 4 cups of potatoes (simmered in the broth to cook), 16 oz. smoked turkey sausage and 8 oz. spicy andouille sausage.  I took the advice of others and added a couple shakes of red pepper flakes and 1 t cajun seasoning....and lots of garlic. I omitted the salt and cheese. Next time I'm going to add cauliflower as suggested by another reviewer.  I'm so glad I found this great recipe to add to our Fall/Winter soup rotation - thanks!

I personally loved this soup but had a hard time getting the kids to eat it. The only thing that I might add next time would be a chicken stock cube for extra "meat" notes--as other said it definitely needed some kick with Creole seasoning, but otherwise an easy and tasty dish!

Delicious meal without too much fuss! I've made this quite a few times now, and following a couple previous reviewers' suggestions, I always brown my sausage first, use a can of creamed corn, and add my cubed potatoes raw. I do add some garlic powder and a healthy dash or two of nutmeg. Leftovers are great too; the flavors blend nicely and it reheats beautifully! This is a regular in the fall/winter rotation. Absolutely love it! Served with some garlic bread or crescent rolls, this one's a keeper!

This was great, especially with some hot sauce. However, I'm not sure what makes it "New Orleans." It seems almost like a northern Minnesota type of meal. Either way, its good.

An interesting compilation of flavors.  Not exactly to my taste and a bit on the heavy side.  I' m glad I tried this but probably won't make again.

This was so creamy and delicious. I did have to add a little more salt and pepper. It was very easy to make and very enjoyable. I served this with Crusty French Bread. Yum!

As is, it's very good, though a little bland.  Second time I added Lawry's seasoned salt to taste, used frozen corn and browned the meat with the onions, then threw in some shrimp.  There's no need to cook the potatoes first.  This is a terrific recipe in that it's good, and easy to make after work.

I am so mad at myself! I read through a ton of reviews and had it all planned out in my head..."add creole seasoning...add creole seasoning"!  And what did I forget?... yup, you guessed it.  Regardless of that, my husband really liked this bisque (he also had fun saying "bisque" - think rich, snooty, clenched teeth accent)!  I think next time I will cook the sausage with the onions and garlic and omit the butter...it really just sat on top of the soup, which then ended up too greasy.  Oh, I also substituted a can of chicken broth for a cup of milk (I ran out!)  Will definitely make again...this time with the creole seasoning!

This was absolutely AMAZING.  I added Tony Chacheres, but besides that, kept everything the same.  Oh my goodness.... melt in your mouth deliciousness.  I served it with a side of cornbread.  This is going to become a regular on my winter meal rotations. :)

This recipe is great, however, I did make some changes.  I ended up using Butterball Turkey Sausage instead of regular smoked sausage.  I didn't use salt, but I did add pepper, basil, garlic & chilli powder.  Instead of canned, like others suggested, I used frozen corn.  Also, for the potatoes, I cut up red potatoes with the skin still on.  This turned out AMAZING!  There were absolutely no leftovers!  Adding the shredded cheddar to your bowl is also a plus.

Easy, but bland.  The only real flavor comes from the sausage, and it's not very strong.  I used the sausage as instructed, and will choose a more flavorful variety next time, and brown it with the onions first.  I used frozen hash browns rather than whole potatoes, and frozen mixed veggies rather than just corn, for some more color.

Ok, I almost omitted a star because of how unhealthy this soup is, but thought that wouldn't be fair because it really was tasty and soooooo easy. My husband LOVED this recipe, but unfortunately he'll probably have to wait a long time before I make it again - this is definitely a special occasion dish, or something to eat after a 10 mile hike!

Neither my husband or I cared for the sausage in the soup, the consistency and taste was not very good.  I think if I would have fried it with the onions it might have turned out better.  I did not cook the potaotes ahead of time, I added them with the sausage and corn.  Other than the sausage, the soup had a good flavor.

This bisque is so simple and delicious. I didn't have any onions so I used onion powder, next time I will definitely use an onion. I fried up the sausages first with some minced garlic and I threw in some paprika, cajun seasoning, and lots of crushed red pepper (if I didn't, I don't see what makes this New Orleans-y). Since I used cajun seasoning I omitted the salt and pepper. Also, since I fried up the sausages first and threw everything in that pot, I didn't have to use that much butter. I used more potatoes than what was called for and I used a 16oz frozen bag of corn. I only used the 4 cups of milk (skim) called for even though I added more potatoes and corn. I had to add an extra tablespoon (heaping) of flour to help it thicken up and I let the soup simmer for about half an hour (to thicken up). I didn't use any cheese or parsley, I didn't think it needed it. This is super easy and tasty and will probably be a regular in my house!

This turned out great. I read through some reviews and made a few changes. I cooked some minced garlic in with the onion.  After adding the milk and bringing it to a boil, I added my potatoes (uncooked), frozen corn, sausage and frozen, cooked, peeled shrimp. It turned out great and was a wonderful dinner (paired with cornbread from this site) for a cold, rainy evening.

This was incredibly delicious (and easy)!  We made it exactly as described, but added 1 or 2 minced cloves of fresh garlic.  We used Yukon Gold potatoes and 1% milk.  Not exactly low in fat, but so yummy that it just doesn't matter.   Would definitely make again!

This was a delicious and filling soup.  I even used skim milk and thought it came out nice and creamy.  The only change I made was to use kielbasa instead of regular smoked sausage.

delicious and easy to make.  I followed a earlier review of putting the non-cooked potatoes in at the end and letting them simmer for 20+ minutes.  Yum. A perfect meal for a cold wintery night!

We really liked this recipe. We doctored it a little bit and added some sauteed garlic with the onion, and I browned the sausage first before adding it. Also added 1 can of creamed corn in addition to the whole kernel corn, and would definitely do it again. Gave it a nice flavor and very creamy texture. When we make it again, I'll add sauteed carrots and celery and more sausage. We sprinkled Old Bay seasoning on some of the bowls, and it was a nice addition. Also didn't cook the potatoes beforehand, and it turned out fine. Great creamy, hearty mild soup - perfect for cold weather.

Oh, I made this today and it's great! The only thing I changed is I up the seasoning and I added garlic powder and some Tony Chachere's. Neither one of them can hurt anything, can only add. I made this for lunch and I'm hearing comments that it's even better for supper!

This dish is very good!  I made it just like the recipe calls but added just a touch of garlic ! It is very thick and stick to the ribs good!  Make sure and add the shredded cheese before serving, it's a nice touch .

I made a few changes of course, fried the sausage and onion in with butter, then added the rest of the ingredients.  I also used 5 red potatoes chopped unpeeled (I stuck them in microwave for 5 min.) I also added some cajun seasoning and lemon juice and shredded cheese.  Very yummy

Very good, I kicked it up a notch with some green pepper, celery, ancho chili powder, tabasco and garlic powder. I did use Turkey smoked sausage and frozen sweet corn. It was excellent, I WILL be making this again.

This was actually bland as written.  To liven it up a bit, I added 2 cloves of garlic, red pepper flakes and a can of diced green chiles.  I also used spicy Andouille sausage.  With my changes this was an excellent, very creamy and satisfying chowder.

This was very good, and easy to make.  My husband can't eat potatoes due to a potassium retention issue so I substituted two cups of cooked rice for the potatoes.  It was good, but it made it a bit more like a casserole.  I fried the sausage a bit before adding it to the soup. Next time I think I would cook it a bit more, but that's just personal preference.  I also added some red pepper flakes for a bit more of a kick.

Well I TRIED to make this as is but after I started realized I didn't have corn. so I threw in some peas. STILL GOOD! I would like to try it with corn though. My family all gave this a 10 and even my four year old wanted MORE. I will defininately make this again. One thing I really love is that it is cheap to make and with stuff you most likely always have around the house.

This is a nice hearty soup great for a cold winter night.  I didn't, cook the potatoes separate but added them when I added the corn and sausage..  Other than that I followed the recipe and ended up with a great tasting soup.  This is a keeper.

I have made this recipe several times! It is sooo good and everyone in our family loves it (including a picky 5 year old!) It is different then our every deal meal. The only thing I do different is add a little garlic salt instead of regular salt. Very delicious!

FANTASTIC soup and easy to do!  Couple changes I did, I used about 3 cups potatoes because the 2 I had were large, why not throw it all in?  I also added the potatoes in raw, when I added the corn and sausage, and then let simmer for 20 mins.  Used skim milk and thickened up just fine.  Added few shakes of creole spice and red pepper flakes for a kick.  Will make again for sure, hubby says dont change a thing!  To us, it didnt even need parsley or cheese on top.

WOW!  So delish and easy!  
Not sure why 'New Orleans' is in the name because there is really nothing 'New Orleans' about it.  And I mean NOT in a bad way.  
Only slight tweeks.....cooked the sausage with the onions and garlic.  And I used a full bag of frozen corn.  
It was an easy and filling soup on a cold winter's night.  And is will be part of my winter dinner rotation.

This is very good. I did alter the recipe to use what I had on hand though. I used smoked turkey keilbasa (hillshire farm) and 2 cans of evaporated milk and a can of chicken broth. Also added a little cayenne pepper and curry powder to the roue. Very good!!

Wonderful bisque, I made the recipe exact, and at the end of cooking added kale and cooked chicken breasts that I cut up. When you cut up your potatoes you'll probally want to make sure the skins are off. (If not they will slide off the potatoes at the end of cooking and linger in your soup)

This soup is rather bland.  But the basics are good as it makes up a nice thick chowder. Needs 2 cans of corn.  Also perhaps increase the amount of onion or add garlic and some cayenne? However, refrigerating it overnight does make it more flavorful.

This was very good and filling! Such a simple dish to make after work. Serve with a salad and it's pure perfection! I followed it to the T except added a little extra garlic and added and small handfull of fresh parsley to the dish instead of just for a garnish.

This was fantastic!  I used turkey sausage, substituted Smart Balance in place of butter, frozen corn and 1% milk.  Also added red pepper flakes and Tony's as others have.  Excellant, thanks for sharing the recipe.

Great recipe, definitely needs the garlic though.  I used fresh brats and just cooked them up ahead of time, still a gret taste.  Will definitely make this recipe again!!!

FABULOSO ZUPPA! and mine came out thick.  I don't measure much, so take that however you wish because you're working with flour and butter.  One of the first things to take notice of is that this one calls for ALREADY cooked potatoes.  I learned that the hard way... ~ Anyhoo... ~  I used half milk, half half-n-half.  Land-O-Lakes makes a fat free half n half.  I didn't use it this time.   If you're looking for comfort, or need to feed a teen high school football kid, or love thick soup, and I mean THICK, make this.  It's hearty. It's full of bad carbs for fat folks, but it is such a treat, and great soup for that husband or man of your's that can and needs to eat something hearty and warm, at lunchtime.  Go easy on the salt.  I added some chix "better than boullion"... and my butter was already salted, so you really don't have to add alot of that.   This is fabulous, really, if you are in the mood for yumminess, naughty-ness, and comfort.  You're fibbin' if you say you have never indulged in such... ;-)

My family loved this (even my picky eaters)!  I used hot italian sausage, because that's what I had on hand, used half milk and half chicken broth and cooked the potatoes along with everything else.  Turned out great!  THis is a keeper.

Simply delicious! I do use skim milk, turkey sausage, and light butter to lower calories. Also, I brown the sausage in a skillet with onion & garlic. Then add it to a big pot with raw potatoes & the milk. Then using the same skillet, mix the butter & flour, then add that to the pot. No need to cook the potatoes ahead of time. And, adding Creole seasoning is a must!!

Made this and it was super easy and yummy, I have two small boys who loved it. Only thing I would change for next time would be to parboil the potatoes a bit before adding them.

I loved this, DH thought it was missing something. I followed the recipe and added garlic. I used ww flour. I cooked the potatoes in 1tbsp butter over medium heat while preparing the rest of the recipe, and added them after the 10min simmer - worked out well.  We did top with low fat cheddar, it was perfect on this!

although this soup tastes great, the presentation/appearance is odd.  I used a smoked turkey sausage and cut it into "cubes" as the recipe suggests...  suffice to say my friends referred to is as "hot dog soup" and "hot dog gruel."  aside from that, the flavors were really good.  I did not cook the potatoes ahead of time, and that was fine.  also, to keep it from getting too thin, the key is to add the milk VERY SLOWLY, only a bit at a time.  in the future I'll probably make this again but use crab or shrimp (maybe even shredded chicken?) rather than the sausage.

This got rave reviews in my house. My littlest one had seconds :) I peeled and chopped the potatoes into @ 1in cubes. I sauteed them in butter, garlic, salt and pepper. I added a lil white wine in the end. I also used half chicken broth and half milk. Added the parsley while it cooked, topped with a lil cheese. It was great. Will make again and again.

This was delicious!  I made it exactly as described.  My husband loved it too - he thought it would be even better with the sausage diced in small cubes - will make often - I had the Herb Biscuits from this site with it - yummy!  I will try it next with cubed ham - thanks for sharing!!

This was wonderful!  I did add a dash of Cayenne but besides that I stuck to the recipe.  My husband actually asked for it the next day for dinner and he won the rock-paper-scissors for the lunch sized serving the next day.  If you had ANY idea just how much he dislikes leftovers you would understand just what this means.  LOL  This one's a keeper!

Excellent dish for a cool Fall evening.  I cooked extra potatoes with my dinner the day before to save on prep time. I replaced the salt with a dash or two of Tony Cachera's Creole seasoning and fresh ground pepper, added fresh garlic with the onions and browned the meat before adding.  I also replaced half of the milk with chicken stock. I sprinkled sharp cheddar and parsley on top before serving and served Cheddar/Garlic Biscuits with it.  VERY hearty meal!

This soup was very good! I did make a few changes...Instead of the 4 cups of milk i used 3 cups of chicken stock and added 1 cup of heavy cream at the end. I also added a little bit of dried thyme and oregano It turned our PERFECT! Next time i will try fresh corn instead if canned and also add a few carrots. I accompanied this soup with herb muffins. Great meal

What a simple, yet tasty meal!  Use 2c. frozen diced potatoes, sautéing them with the onion and 1/2c. butter in the first step in order to make this a one-pot meal.  There won't be chunks of potato, rather thicker, creamier chowder.

Very good & easy.  I sauted 1/3 lb bacon, 1 onion, celery, carrot and garlic for a long time.  Added the sausage and corn for a minute, then moved all of it to a pot.  In the frying pan, I put the butter and flour with seasonings, browned it and then added the milk.  Put it all in the pot with the potatoes, boiled a bit. Mmmmm good!

My son hated it (but hates soup), my husband said he didnt' like the potatoes, I thought it wasn't too bad, and would have given it a 4 myself. I made it as written. Easy to make, but looks like I won't make it again.

Fabulous and easy to make. I added one can of creamed corn for thickness and then a whole package of frozen corn. I did not add cheese since it was great as it was. Used 3 cups 1% milk and 1 cup fat free half and half. Was rich and creamy. Everyone raved about it.

Excellent soup!  I did make several slight changes though.  Added celery, red pepper flakes and a pinch or two of dill with the potatoes.  I used raw potatoes and they cooked fine in the soup.  Also added a little chicken broth to thin as mine was very thick.  Great with homemade bread!

Very good, I made it with the ingredients I had on hand.  I used venison sausage and frozen homemade creamstyle corn.  They only change I made was to cook the potatoes and onion in 2 cups broth and added then added 1 cup cream and 1 cup milk to equal all the the liquid.

Delicious!!  This was so easy and my whole family enjoyed it.  I followed the recipe but I did use turkey smoked sausage and super skim milk to make it healthier.  There were no leftovers.  I will definitely make this again.

My whole family loved this...even the kids. I didn't have all the ingredients, but my substitutions worked out great.   I didn't have an onion so I used minced dried onion, I personally would prefer the fresh onion, but it worked in a bind.   I only had a little frozen corn and one can of creamed corn. The creamed corn helped thicken the soup and gave a little sweeter flavor too.   Instead of cubed potatoes, I threw in my leftover "Roasted Root Vegetables with Apple Juice."   I also added garlic as other cooks suggested and I would have definitely added the can of green chilies if my son was a spicy-lover like the rest of us. Instead, we just sprinkled lots of Penzey's Black and Red pepper on our own bowl to give it some heat.

I really enjoyed this and it was easy to prepare.  As suggested by others, I added minced garlic (about 1 TBSP.) and used Creole Seasoning (3/4 tsp.) instead of salt.  I used turkey sausage and thought it was just fine!

I found this recipe about a month ago and have made it several times. It has become our new favorite dish. I double the recipe and add about a 1/4 teaspoon of red pepper flakes. We love this dish.

I made this more "New Orleans" by using andouille sausage, minced garlic, and adding in one tablespoon of all purpose Cajun seasoning. I also used 2 cups chicken stock and 2 cups whole milk instead of 4 cups of milk. I used frozen corn and cooked my Yukon Gold potatoes in the soup as I didn't plan on cooking them earlier. The result was creamy, spicy and full of flavor. I will definitely make this again!

What to do with smoked sausage??  So boring usually, but not this time.  I used turkey smoked sausage that I sauteed first to get some color on it.  I used frozen corn and 1 cup of brown Minute Rice (cooked and added at the last minute). I also added Tony Chaccarra's and red pepper flakes.  This was so yummy and satisfying on a cold Texas day!

Scrumptious! As per the previous reviewers, I added garlic, crushed red pepper flakes, and Tony Chachere's creole seasoning. I also omitted the salt from the recipe. My husband and I loved this. He's already mentioned us having it again soon. If you haven't tried this one yet, I recommend that you do.

I fixed this the other day, loved it. I will be making this again. I did as some of the others did. I didn't cook my potatoes first. I also added some cooked shrimp and I didn't use can corn.  I used 2 cups of frozen corn instead.

This recipe is a keeper.  Given, how I hate when people change a recipe and then rate it down, I think this recipe is good as is or with changes.  I read the other reviews and decided to spice it up with some Tony Chachere's seasoning, a little cayenne and crushed red pepper, minced garlic and a few shrimp. I also did not precook the potatoes.  It was a huge hit with my family.  Even my teenage daughters liked it.  I will definitely make this again.

I made this, and Good God, it’s amazing!! With that said,  I did make a few minor modifications (because I’m like that, and I can’t help myself). Mostly following the recipe, I used Andouille Smoked Sausage, added a teaspoon of Old Bay, cooked the sausage with the roux, and sprinkled a little more flour to absorb the extra grease created from adding the sausage early. I also added the potatoes in raw and let them cook from there. Super Yummy!

So easy & we liked it a lot!  I made changes though.Things I did differently.  First, cooked  three ears of  fresh corn, would skip this next time & just slice off  the kernels & toss them in the mix. Then sauted the chopped onion & sausage slices together in heavy Dutch oven.  Added about half a can of vegetable broth and the chopped potatoes. Didn't pre cook those, they softened just fine over the course of simmer time.  In a separate smaller pan I mixed up the melted butter flour & milk. Was afraid of flour lumps if I attempted this with all the other stuff already in the Le Creuset. Added that into the main pot  once I had a good consistency.  I used about half the milk & added vegetable broth as needed. A few heavy handed dashes of Old Bay seasoning just for extra flavor. A keeper for sure, no left overs.

No idea why this is called a "bisque" or has the name of the city of New Orleans attached to it.  This is more of a "corn chowder."  Used two cans of "diced" potatoes, and added at the last minute.  It's a quick recipe.  I cut the Hillshire Farms sausage into 1/4" "medallions," then quartered those so that each piece would be about the same size as the potatoes out of the can.   I'm always looking for different ways to cook Hillshire Farms Smoked Sausage, and this recipe is a keeper!  Will definitely make this again!  Might try  roasted kernal corn next time.

I made it with brats, so I cooked them first. I added the potatoes raw like others said, and a few extra spices including garlic cloves and Tony’s. It was difficult to cook the potatoes in the sauce because it wanted to stick pretty bad. Stand over it and stir frequently! Tastes good. I will probably make it again.

This is a great recipe, as written or modified (I have done both). My current favorite version is: half the sausage; double the corn (frozen, not canned); sauté garlic, carrots, and celery along with the onions; skip the salt and add extra pepper; cook the potatoes in chicken broth and replace half the milk with that broth (if it doesn’t seem bisquey enough with the broth, a dash of cream will fix that right up, and you still get the flavor and potatoey thickness from the broth); add plenty of chopped scallions at the very end.

so good!  I did add garlic like previous reviews.  I used turnips like I do with all recipes with potatoes.  Turned out amazing. One of my new favorites.

Added cauliflower, wish I cut up my potatoes into smaller pieces, and I added a can of creamed corn (love corn!) skipped the cheese, didn't miss it. Love the soup!

I added shrimp on the top. I also added way too much flour so I added more milk which still was great

Amazing! Made it in the slow cooker. Sauté the onions with 3 cloves of garlic. Add a little cayenne for an authentic New Orleans  zing. Leave everything else alone. This is our favorite soup. Trust me. Make this.

Following changes: added buttermilk instead of milk. Less flour, 1 tsp. Added red peppers chopped to onion. Added 1 chopped tomatillo.  Cooked potatoes in microwave first. browned sausages first. Dash of hot sauce at the end.  DELICIOUS!

Very good and quick to make.  Like other reviewers, I sauteed the onion with the smoked sausage rather than in oil and I also used frozen super sweet corn.  This was especially quick to make since I used previously cooked leftover potatoes!  I served it with cornbread and raw veggies.  I will make this recipe again.

Absolutely will make this again.  The only changes I made were adding the creole seasoning, per the recommendations of others, and using Baja roasted corn - because it was what I had on hand.
Incredible results.

Very good, I replaced the salt with 1 tsp Cajun seasoning and peppered it up a bit, otherwise followed the recipe.  My wife and I enjoyed it very much.  It seems an easy recipe to play with, replacing the sausage with Andouille, shrimp or crab meat.

Pretty much followed  the recipe and thought it was awesome.  I used Johnsonville sweet Italian sausage as that is what I had on hand.  My husband suggested I save this recipe.  We felt it was one we could easily  adapt for whatever we may have on hand.

Boiled potatoes in fresh chicken broth(about 2 inches over the potatoes). Melted butter and put sliced  kielbasa sausage and chopped onions and minced garlic, till sausage a little brown. Added to potatoes. Add to potatoes; little small diced jalapeño, can drained and washed navy beans, frozen corn kernels, parsley, salt, pepper, and Tony Chacherees. I used no flour because the starch in the potatoes and corn made the consistency I prefer. Add the amount of seasonings you prefer. Can always add more but not take away. Enjoy!

I cut down on fat and carbs and did what another reviewer said. I replaced half the milk with chicken broth, cauliflower instead of potatoes (I love cauliflower!!!) and smoked chicken sausage. It's excellent!

I made it up exactly as the recipe calls for, and it is quite good.  After reading other reviews (I hadn't yet) I may go ahead and toss in a bit of Creole seasoning, just to make it authentic.

We have made this recipe several times. We love it!! I add an extra can of corn because I like those sweet crisp bites, I also add some garlic powder like others have suggested. I brown my onion and sausage together and cook the potatoes in the milk instead of cooking everything separately. Thank you for sharing this recipe!! It's definitely a keeper!

So delicious. Added garlic powder, and didn't cook the potatoes before adding them in (but cut them very small). Next time I might cook the potatoes partially before adding to the soup so that the soup doesn't have to cook as long. Also added a small amount of green bell pepper.

I usually don't go for recipes made by the big food companies, but this was great. You can add any good stewing veggies. Great on a fall night.

I used red potatoes, 1% milk, and only half of an onion because that's what I had on hand.  I also added some chopped carrots with the onion as it cooked and added some garlic powder as well as more salt than recipe calls for.  Will make again for sure since we almost always have the ingredients on hand.

Sauteed the sausage and onion before making the roux, and added a little cajun seasoning.  Used a pound of frozen corn instead of canned and cooked the potatos, corn, and sausage in the milk until the potatos were done.  Added a little water to thin it out.  Very good and filling.

This is the absolute best soup. Make it as is - perfection. You can also throw in some vegetable broth to extend it a bit. Don't cook the potatoes ahead of time! Just throw them in. They'll cook just fine and saves time. Also make with crunchy French bread. Yum! One of my all-time favs.

It was ok but I made the mistake of making it with sweet corn instead of just regular corn. Cooked the potatoes in there with the rest of the ingredients and used frozen instead of canned corn and it turned out fine. Just has to cook a lil bit longer. The kids did not like it.

This was such an easy recipe to follow and turned out pretty well.  It was quick to make as well.  I used smoked sausage with no casing (my kids and I don't care for the casing) and used a half olive oil and a half butter as well as almond milk in stead of regular milk because that's what I had.  I was afraid that the flavor was going to be off because of the almond milk but it tasted pretty good, thanks to the smoked sausage.  We all liked it.  I did not serve it with cheddar cheese or parsley but it tasted good anyway.

Very filling, easy, quick and yummy. I put about 2 tsp bacon grease in with the butter for the roux.  Much more "Southern" flavor. Next time I might try more seasonings and perhaps some garlic.

This recipe is a good base, but it's screaming for some more cajun treatment:  I added some kidney beans, hot pepper, paprika, and oregano.  Also, if I make this again, I think I'll pre-boil the potatoes as the soup starts to burn while you're waiting for them to cook through.  Make those changes and you'll have yourself a killer 5-star recipe!

This is so tasty that I definitely have to make this weekly. The best part is that it is very easy. Would definitely recommend it.

Love it!!! Though I cooked the potatoes with the onions. It didn't turn out too bad, but I understand why people would prefer having cooked potatoes before hand.

Made this last night and it was a big hit. I added garlic, Cajun Seasoning, and shrimp. Served with French Bread. Next time I'll add crab meat. My picky son loved it. Very easy to make.

I just made this last night and it was a perfect complement to the cold weather outside.  I altered the recipe slightly with 2 cups of Almond Milk and 2 cups of Soymilk - it came out rather nice and creamy.  I doubled the corn and used one can of cream corn.  I also added some of Hillshire Farm Andouille Sausage which gave it a perfect little 'kick' and kept the heat centralized in the back of my throat.  Delicious!

This was very good but with the help of other viewers, I've made changes myself. For sausage I used cheddar sausage and I would recommend more spices for flavor so I used garlic and roasted peppers and garlic. This meal was some yummy and tasty!!

Absolutely delicious. I made this earlier tonight and was surprised how easy and affordable it was. I omitted the salt but did add garlic and baby carrots.  I also used some red pepper.  I topped each serving with a sprinkle of extra sharp cheddar for the final touch.  Later on I caught my mom in the pot, she said she couldn't believe how good it was.  Next time I'm going to try some creole seasoning as some of the others suggested.    This will definitely be in my repertoire!

I have been using Allrecipes.com for years and never left a review before now.  This soup is outstanding!  I followed the advice of others and used frozen corn.  I also used yukon gold potatoes cut in coins and 1 TB of Tony Chachere's seasoning.  It is a super easy recipe that warms you up.

Excellent!  I had to change this up a little bit because I cannot eat any dairy.  I used one bottle of chicken stock, which was almost 4 cups, then I added 2 cups of almond milk.  I also didn't use any butter.  I sautated the onions in a little olive oil, then cut up the sausage and cooked it with the onions.  I used 4 potatoes, a bag of frozen corn, added a little garlic and some blackening seasoning.  Turned out great! The husband and two year old also loved it!

I've made this twice now.  The first time by the book which was very good. The second time I added Tony  Chachere's  more spice seasoning and to speed things up I used frozen cubed hash browns - this turned out even better in my book and hubby is already talking about making it again.

I love this recipe, but I do a couple things extra to it. I typically pan fry the smoked sausage first, just to bring out the flavor of it more. I also add in cajun seasoning and just a bit of brown sugar. It adds spice with just the faintest bit of sweetness, which all works together very well. Without those things, the bisque can be relatively bland.

I have four kids and all ate it!!  I drained a 15 oz. can of diced potatoes instead of peeling and cutting 2cups worth.  I also add the parsley and shredded cheddar (about 1/2 cup) during the last 10 minutes to simmer.  Awesome!!

This was very good.  My husband who is a meat and potatoes guy really enjoyed it as well.  I did go with some of the other reviews and browned the sausage, then cooked the onions and used less fat.  I also added shrimp and creole seasoning to taste.   Yummy-thanks for sharing.

Really good. My hubby really liked this one....I used 4 c. of fat free/low sodium broth and then added 1 1/2 c. of fat free 1/2 and 1/2 instead of using all milk. I also used turkey kielbasa and added some of Emeril's Essence to jazz it up. Thanks!

This soup ROCKED!!! Loved it. Changed a few things, but really appreciate the basic recipe- so, so good! Thank you! (: What I did- for the sausage I used 8 oz smoked turkey sausage and 8oz andouille sausage. For the milk, I used 1 can 2% evaporated milk, plus enough regular 2% milk to make 4 cups, added dried parsley to the soup while it was cooking (I did not have any fresh parsley on hand) and the last change was I added a heaping tbsp of pork soup base to round out the flavor. Served plain with no toppings, just crusty rolls and a nice salad. It was delicious!

The portions are too small to serve 8 people a main course meal. A little on the bland side. I added 3 teaspoons Tony's creole seasoning, garlic and a can of cream corn to try and give it more corn flavor. It was better after those additions. I used Turkey Kielbasa  and fat free milk to try and save some calories.

Delicious!  Long fan of New Orleans cuisine.  I did not precook the potatoes.  Added them after the onions were sauteed.  Omitted the salt and replaced with Tony's Cajun Seasoning...and also added a 1/2 tsp of cayenne.  Perfectly seasoned if you like it a little more spice!  Will definitely be making this again.  Next time will try to lighten it up by using less butter and maybe some skim.

I took some suggestions and altered the recipe a bit. I added green and red peppers with the onion and sauteed them together. It gave it a really nice flavor. You could probably add celery and carrots too if you like. I heated up the sausage in a separate skillet before adding it to the bisque. I also used frozen yellow corn. Instead of 4 cups of milk I used 2 cups of half and half and 2 cups of chicken broth. When it was all finished I added the parsley and Colby Jack cheese for those who want a little extra punch to it. I also did my own spices. I added some cayenne, garlic powder, black pepper, paprika, a pinch of  seasoned salt, and celery seed. Celery salt would be good too or if you don't have many spices old bay or creole sounds good too. I sprinkled the spices and thought I was being modest with them but ended up adding too much for my taste. I don't like really hot or spicy foods, I just like it mild. Hubby enjoyed it though but next time I'll be more mindful about how much of these spices I'm adding. Overall great recipe. I may add sour cream and bacon next time instead of sausage. It's a pretty easy recipe to play with to suit your taste.

I used frozen corn and 3 cups of potatoes.  Pretty good but was missing something.  I used some Franks Red Hot in it for some more flavor but just couldn't get the seasoning right.

Rave reviews from the family. I used chicken broth to cook my diced potatoes and also used 1/2 chicken broth and 1/2 milk in the recipe. I used a couple of left over grilled Johnsonville brats which I diced that I had in the freezer for the sausage in it. You could use about any kind of meat in this.  I also added 1/2 tsp of garlic powder in it as it was a little blah and frozen corn, not canned. Husband said, "This is really good" and he usually does not comment of the food. My daughter ate 3 bowls of it so she enjoyed it. It will be a regular for our family.

good stuff!  I used one can chicken broth and then enough milk to make the 4 cups of liquid and it is still plenty thick.  Could have used 2 cans of corn or one bag of frozen corn.  2 cups of diced potatoes is 2-3 medium potatoes.  Redskins would have been nice.  I peeled and boiled the potatoes before chopping up the meat and starting the soup, so they were done and ready to go in on time.

This is a good hardy soup.  As is it is a four star recipe because it is good but there is nothing that really makes the recipe stand out.  With the addition of scallions, bacon, or other things this soup could be five stars.  It does need more seasoning than just the salt and pepper though.

Absolutely amazing! Anyone who has any reservations should just go for it! I followed some others advice and sauteed the sausage (used turkey) and onions together. I also added garlic and cajun/creole seasoning for more flavor. What a great meal with cornbread! Even my hubby who doesn't like chowders loved it. DELICIOUS!

I enjoyed the base of this but had to doctor it up to really be tasty.  I added onion powder, garlic salt, crushed red pepper flakes, and two cloves of garlic.  All the additions were done to taste during the cooking process.  With these additions it was a very good meal.

Good base recipe to start with.  After reading other review suggestions, I browned the sausage with onions and garlic first.  I added fresh, raw potatoes with 1 can of chicken broth and 2 cups of milk.  I also added garlic powder, cayenne pepper, pepper flakes, old bay seasoning, black pepper and salt, parsley, celery, chives, and cheese right before serving.  My fiance and neighbor both loved it.

Made it as written. This was just OK, but my family didn't really care for it. It is very similar to another recipe here, Delicious Ham & Potato Soup, which is much better and just as easy to make.

If you love it hot, make that jalepeno cheddar smoked sausage (not a Hillshire Farms flavor at my store), cut up a medium green chili and add it to the onions, and shake in some red pepper flakes.  It's pretty hot, but yum!

This was very good. I added garlic, cayenne pepper and Cajun seasoning. I doubled the recipe but subbed 2 cups fat free evaporated milk, 2 cups 1% milk & 4 cups of low sodium chicken stock. I also did not precook the potatoes and it thickened up nicely. I threw in 1lb of snow crab claws (because the bag was on sale for $2) and topped each bowl off with a tablespoon of lump crab meat. Will be a keeper.

I think when I make this I will use frozen creamed corn. brown the sausage first as one reviewer said. add some garlic from another review. and I would like to mention that 1/4 cup of butter is 1/2 stick and that flour and butter cooked together is  a roux. thank you.

This was okay. Had to add a LOT of Cajun seasoning and some Cayenne pepper. Used garlic, frozen corn and canned cream corn as previously suggested, as well as spicy smoked sausage and more potatoes. It is easy, but definitely bland if not spiced up.

I followed the suggestions on the comments here and I thought this turned out great! It was a cinch to make and was so tasty. I'll definitely be making this again in the near future.   I've got leftovers planned for lunch and I too can't wait to eat them!  Great recipe.

Yummy for sure.  I followed the recipe exactly as stated, except for the parsley at the end.  It was very tasty and easy to make.   I "think" the next time  I may try a spicey sausage for a little kick.  i used Hillshire Farms Smoked Turkey Kielbasa (or sausage) but would like to try something like andouille sausage, maybe add a bit of shredded cheese into the pot before serving too and top it with cheese as well.

Delicious, quick and easy. I had all the ingredients on hand, so I thought I'd give this recipe a try. The only changes I made were: I used frozen corn, I added 1 tsp. red pepper flakes (which gave it a  nice kick), and I threw the potatoes in raw with the sausage and corn and cooked it for 15 minutes. I'm sure I'll be making this again.

My husband & I LOVED this.  (He saved enough leftovers to take to work for lunch the next day.)  I added a little cajun spice instead of the salt/pepper and had cornbread and a big salad on the side.  I forgot to cook the potatoes in advance, but a couple minutes in the microwave softened them up a little.  Turkey smoked sausage helped cut down on the fat.  Definitely a new favorite of ours.

My kids begged me to go to In N Out Burger tonight and I told them no.  I said that I was making soup.  They said, "Awww," with a big collective whine, but when they tasted this dish, they all begged for more.  They said it was fantastic!

My entire family LOVED this!  I added extra potatoes - probably 3 cups or so.  I used Tastefully Simple Onion Onion in replace of the chopped onion.  Besides that, I followed it exactly.  It was sooo good!  The only other change I would make next time would be to brown the sausage before adding it.  That would add a little more color and a little more flavor.  This is definitely going to be made again at my house! UPDATE: I have made this SEVERAL more times. I now make it with turkey smoked sausage and skim milk. Tastes just as good! Don't hesitate to try it! My family asks for "sausage soup" all the time!

This is really good and inexpensive! Easy to make too! I used turkey smoke sausage and added Tony's cajun seasoning, and omitted the salt & pepper.

I made this last night it was really good. I followed the others and added the potatoes with the sausage and corn. But it took a while to get the potatoes soft how I like them. Other than that a great soup. Thanks for the recipe.

I feel like I stumbled across a hidden treasure.....YUMMIE! Very easy, very good. Used skim milk and low fat sausage - just as good as "normal". Worth doubling it!

This was wonderful! I followed the recipe as is except put the potatoes in early as other reviewers suggested. It was delicious and re-heated the next day really well. I would definitely make this again.

Yummy!  Just made this and boy is it good. The kids and husband will be home soon to try it out.  There's a chill in the air and this should warm us up.

Yummy!!  Really good and very easy to put together.  Added 2 cloves of minced garlic and didn't precook the potatoes.  Added about 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper but husband added more.  Will definitely make again!

Big hit but the size was too big.
