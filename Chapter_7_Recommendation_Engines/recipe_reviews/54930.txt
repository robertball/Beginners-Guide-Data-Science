I make this awesome stuffing every year for Thanksgiving.  However, the last few years, I've used 2 packets of Uncle Ben's microwave wild rice instead of the uncooked wild rice.  It tastes exactly the same and shaves 45 minutes off the cooking time!

I brought this stuffing along with a roast turkey to a potluck tonight and got many compliments on it. Every lady there asked me for the recipe, and several of the men too! Some commented that they didn't really like stuffing, but this stuffing was delicious! 

This recipe is a keeper! It goes together very easily too. Thanks!

P.S. The recipe as posted doesn't delineate a quanitity or preparation on the almonds. I used a small bag of slivered ones, and it seemed to be the right amount.

I didn't have broccoli and used more mushrooms instead.  I used ~twice the broth then stated and it was good.  Definitely a keeper.  Will add other veggies like carrots or celery next time.  YUM!

A new family favorite stuffing! My grandparents loved it, and I think we will be making this for now on instead of the traditional stuffing. I really enjoyed the wild rice, broccoli, and mushrooms, as it enhanced the stuffing. I used 1 1/2 cans of chicken broth or so. I added about 1/4 cup of thinly sliced celery. I sprinkled almonds on top. I used only 1/4 cup ( 4 Tb) of margarine. Very tasty and very filling!

This stuffing is a new holiday tradition in our home!  Being vegetarian, I substituted the chicken broth for a high sodium vegetable broth and sprinkled some sea salt on the top before baking.  It was amazing!!  I blanched the broccoli too, which I think helped the leftovers remaining quite tender, not mushy. Enjoy this awesome stuffing!!  :D

This recipe was AWESOME!  This is the ONLY stuffing I ever kept for leftovers...  I think those who ended up with soggy stuffing probably only used a 6 oz box of stuffing, not 16 oz, which is what I almost did.  Thanks for the great addition to our holidays!

I made this for my daughter, who is vegetarian, for Thanksgiving dinner.  I used vegetable broth instead of chicken and she loved it! As a matter of fact, this stuffing disappeared before the traditional stuffing I have made for years.  Everyone loved it.   I paired it with vegan gravy--which she also loved- over tofu.  She was in vegan heaven.

I scaled down serving size, but otherwise followed recipe as written.  The only addition was that I added chicken breast tenders to bottom of dish, topped it with the stuffing and then baked it.  Very tasty.  Some of the stuffing was too dry for me so I'll probably add 2-3 more ounces of liquid next time.  The broccoli works really well in this dish. I don't think I'd choose this recipe for my holiday table, but I will definitely make again for family dinners.

This was very good.  I only had a 6oz box of stuffing so I chopped up a leftover half loaf of french bread, added a tsp or so of sage and sauteed some celery along with the onion and mushrooms.  I browned some chicken breast in the same pan after sauteeing the vegetables and placed those in the 9X13 and topped with stuffing. Great comfort food on a cold and rainy night.

This was a very tasty recipe.  I liked the blend of ingredients, however, I think it was too dry.  I actually added a cup more of chicken broth to make it more moist.

This stuffing was very good! My only suggestion is to use a little more chicken broth. Some of the stuffing was still crunchy. Other than that it was great. I used a rice blend with Texmati, Red and Wild rice which was nice.

This is very good, we really liked it.  I doubled the amount of wild rice. I used a 32 oz. carton of chicken broth (this was the amount called for on the Trader Joe's stuffing box), and the stuffing would have been very moist if it came off the stovetop that way, but once it baked for awhile it was perfect. I also threw in a handful of shredded carrots for extra color. I cooked the broccoli and carrots in with the onions and mushrooms, I saw no need to dirty up an extra pan.  My husband also liked this and would like to have it again.

Family loved this as they like packaged stuffing mix. I am not such a fan of the packaged mix so will give it a try with my homemade stuffing. Really like the addition of wild rice and mushrooms!

i made the basic moist stuffing recipe ala Betty Crocker, adding mushrooms to the celery/onion in butter saute. added Uncle Ben's pouch rice, cooked brocc and almonds.  threw in a beaten egg, too.  Baked, covered for 30 min, then uncovered another 15 minutes. Holy moly, hardy and delicious.  Thank You for some nice additions!

Sheer awesomeness! I cooked this dish w/ 2 Cornish hens. Such a delight! I recommend that you begin cooking the hens while you're preparing the rice to save time and ensure neither dish is under- or overcooked. 

i will admit that I panicked a bit when I realized I got home from the grocer w/ a 6 oz. box of Stove Top (vs. 16 oz. as provided in the recipe). But what I purchased was sufficient and is the standard size so I'm wondering if what's in the recipe is a typo.

This recipe was Awesome.  Nothing bland about it, it was full of flavor and really could be used as a vegetarian main dish if you switched out the chicken broth.  Loved it.

This was really good.  My husband loved this and so did the kids.  The only thing I didn't add was broccoli because I had none and sisn't want oto go to the store.

Made this for a family get-together and it was the star of the show - everybody loved it - even my picky brother!!! I did add extra chicken broth as it seemed to be a little dry when I checked it while it was baking!

This was ok.  I made as directed, and enjoyed it.  Not sure of the significance of the rice was in the dish, as it was barely noticeable with the bread stuffing that was added.  The only seasoning came from the herbed stuffing pre packaged mix, maybe I was wanting something more?  Was good, but nothing out of the ordinary too me.

This was very tasty and the colour, with the broccoli added, was great!  Definitely will be made again at my home!

This was a huge success!!!  I also took the advice of others for simplification and used 2 boxes of Uncle Ben's wild rice.  I may not wait until next Thanksgiving to make this again!!!!

Made a hit at the Christmas potluck. Only a couple of scoops left over for me to enjoy at home. Great for a quick dish, but next time I will not use the pre made boxed stuffing as the bread pieces were too small.

Delicious!  Everybody loved it.  I cooked it inside the turkey last year, but will bake it separately this year.

This made a lovely stuffing, though I have learnt from making this recipe that I definitely prefer my stuffing inside a bird. I cooked this on top of some chicken tenders as one reviewer suggested and I was not a fan. I appreciated the flavour of the stuffing though hence still giving the original recipe 4 stars, but in future I'll definitely cook it in a bird rather than separately.

Delicious ... will definitely make this again.  
I do think I may increase the amount of rice and the amount of broth next time around.

This wasn't bad tasting, but it wasn't a good stuffing. Way too dry even after I more than doubled the liquid. Needs some spices or herbs too.

Very easy recipe and delicious, too. I added more chicken broth because I like a moister stuffing. So, be sure to have extra cans on hand to accomodate your taste.

Loved this dish!!! This is the only Stuffing I will make from now on. I diced the mushrooms instead of sliced to please my four year old. Everything else I did according to the directions.

My family raved about this recipe at Thanksgiving dinner!  It was very yummy fresh and as leftovers.  I took the advice of a previous reviewer and added a second can of chicken broth.  The stuffing was very moist but not soggy.  I also used long grain and wild rice, as I could not find plain wild rice in the grocery store.

This recipe was a great hit with my in-laws! We really enjoyed it! I love the combination of ingredients and it is a very colorful dish. I will fix again during this holiday season.
