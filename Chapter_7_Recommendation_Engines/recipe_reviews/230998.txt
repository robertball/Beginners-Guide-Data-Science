It was fantastic - I highly recommend the recipe.  I added pickled peppers instead of fresh ones because that's what I had on hand however I could not have been happier with the dish.  We usually have about 1/2 a pan of cornbread left over that we have to throw away but not this time.  Every single slice was eaten!

I made this tonight. It turned out great. I made one change and omitted 1/2 cup of the butter. It didn't need it.  Next time I would use serrano chiles for more heat. I only used half the bacon but would use more next time. Hubby loved it!

This turned out wonderful.  Savory not too sweet.  Would be great with a pat of butter.  Only thing I did different was to cook in a 13x9 pan....I basted it with margarine and preheated it in the oven.  I also mixed the bacon into the batter instead of just on top.  Mild spice without the jalapeno seeds.

I made it today using the 9x13 dish, I added some of the bacon grease to the dish and kept it in the oven until i was ready to add the batter.  I also did not use the butter in the recipe, if i want it i will spread it on top when it's done :)  Everything cooked evenly and came out perfect!  It was DELICIOUS! thank you for sharing, I will definitely make again !

I love this recipe!  My family likes hoecakes so I put the batter in my cast iron thin cornbread skillet in batches like pancakes, otherwise everything else is the same.  I love it crusty and this really does the trick.

I thought it was very good, but will add 1/3 cup sugar next time and drain some of the bacon grease out of the pan before I put the batter in the cast iron skillet. pprekop

This was a pretty good recipe, but I think it needs more jalapenos next time. I really could not get much flavor from them. However, it was really fun to pour the batter into the sizzling hot skillet with all of the bacon fat!

I am not a fan of cornbread typically.  This was pretty good.  My only negative comment would be that the bacon was too overpowering & that was the main taste of the bread.  Could use some more jalapeno flavor & heat & then it would be perfect!

This came out really good. The best reviews I’ve ever had at a Friendsgiving. I used pepper jack instead of cheddar because it’s what I had, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.

I added the bacon to the batter.  It was good cornbread but I’ll change a couple things when I make it next time.    I’ll add honey and more cornmeal.

Very good recipe. The bread is more cake-like; the baking powder provides a great rise to the bread. I only had two jalapenos, but don't get too worried about it being too spicy. Caveman that I am, I used more bacon and more cheese (I used pepper jack). My oven runs a bit hot, but I still had to keep it in for the entire cooking time, so check to make sure your bread is totally done. I used my broiler for about 90 minutes to brown the top. Went perfectly with my homemade chili!

Great recipe. I made it as is but didn't have any jalapeños but added scallions. Also, I had a lot of bacon grease so I drained most of it. I cooked it in a large cast iron skillet but I had a lot of extra batter so made 6 large muffins with the rest of the batter. It was super tasty but it had more of a fluffy texture not the dense texture most cornbreads have. I might try 2 cups each of the corn meal & flour next time to see how that comes out.

I made the following changes:  1/2 cup of olive oil instead of butter; chopped red chilies which I had on hand; 2T more sugar; inadvertent change was that all my eggs were double-yolkers!  This recipe is superb and won bravos from everyone at last Sunday's chili dinner.  Will make again (I love it when people think I'm such a fabulous cook!)  Thanks for the recipe and the site, which is new to me (I live in France).

Very good!  Nice balance of flavors.  Used an iron skillet and was nice and crispy, while staying moist and delicious inside.

This was gorgeous! Great balance of heat from the jalapenos and smoothness from the cheddar. I almost reduced the butter but it really came through in the flavour. Served this with homemade baked beans and it was perfect.
