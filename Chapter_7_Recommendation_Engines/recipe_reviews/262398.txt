I made this but I first mixed the za'atar, salt, pepper, and added two tsp of garlic powder in a bowl. Then I add two to three tbsp of oil to the mix and coated bone-in chicken thighs that I took the skin and fat off and went straight to baking. I really liked the taste. I had it with quinoa cooked in bouillon with onions, fresh spinach, feta, and then broccoli on the side.

OMG this is good! I made my own za'atar spice (TOTALLY worth the effort). Exotic flavors linger on the tongue while you  savor impossible aromas. Decidedly worth repeating again.

Simple to make and delicious!  Za'atar makes this easy dish exotic.  I served it with spaghetti squash and salad.

I followed the recipe for the chicken exactly, but since I had a little room left in my skillet, I tossed in some frozen potato, onion & red pepper chunks, put some za'atar and drippings on them as well, popped it all in the oven and cooked for 20 mins.
OMG this is good!
The chicken came out super moist and full of flavor. The veggies had a nice  crispy edge and the potatoes were soft in the middle.
The flavor is crazy good! 
And the dressing is quite tasty too. 

If you don't have za'atar on hand or in local stores, you can pick it up at Amazon or you can look online and make your own, but real za'atar has hyssop and sumac - so look for those ingredients to get the full flavor. and benefits of za'atar.  

Great, easy-enough recipe to make weekly or for a quick hot lunch.
Thanks for the recipe.

This is a great recipe. Simple, and quite tasty. I was first introduced to za-atar when I met my wife and her Lebanese family. We would go to the local bakery and buy fresh pita bread with za-atar on it. It was love at first bite. I made it exactly according to the recipe adding a bit more za-atar than the recipe called for. It was amazing and is going in my recipe collection. Thank you!

Easy, dinner on the table in a half hour. Served it with baked acorn squash. I still have a bag of sumac from my farm, so used it to make a fresh batch of za'atar.

My husband is a very picky eater and he doesn't even care for baked chicken.  I made him try it and to my surprise he loved it!!!  This recipe is a keeper!

Easy prep and very tasty chicken.  I make my own Za'atar so it's always fresh.  Served with steamed broccoli and roasted butternut squash.   Awesome dinner!!

Made it per recipe and enjoyed it very much. Super easy to make and packed with flavor. I will probably experiment and maybe add garlic next time but really good. I purchased a za'atar spice mix at Walmart.

No changes.  Made it as directed and it was delicious.  We need to get more zatar spice.
