My microwave wattage must be higher than the recipe's, and I'm wondering if the cashews should have been raw?  What I could salvage of my first batch was very tasty, but a lot of it was burned.  I'm not blaming the recipe though, I'm blaming the tool.  Will try this one again.

I have also been making this for years .  I have burned a few batches when getting a new microwave.  My 1100 w microwave requires me to cut time to 2 minutes after adding nuts and 1 minute 30 seconds  after adding butter.  I also make using almonds.

Didn't change a thing and it was awesome! Have to be quick getting it out of the bowl before it starts to harden. I had someone hold the bowl while I poured/scooped it out the 2nd time I made it to get it all out quickly. Delicious! Will make again.

I also over the brittle but next time I will also use raw cashews or reduce the time once I add the cashews. 

I’ll definitely try it again. Maybe I’ll try it with maple syrup and raw pecans as well

Loved it! I used butter substitute, monk sugar and maple flavored syrup instead of the butter, sugar and corn syrup. I also used raw cashews. The only thing I would change for next time is that I would use a smaller pan than the cookie sheet to make the brittle thicker. Yummy!

Super easy to make. After reading the other reviews, I adjusted my cook time so it did not burn. My husband loved it!

Delish! I save the butter to add when I add the vanilla to the brittle and instead use cooking spray on a foil covered pan.  Like others, I shorten the time due to what I think is a higher powered microwave.  I shorten the first time by 30 seconds, and cut a minute off each of the remaining times. The hubby loves it!

My hubby loves all things brittle so I surprised him with this recipe today. Followed exact directions he said it was awesome.
