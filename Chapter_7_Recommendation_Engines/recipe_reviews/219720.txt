My Polish Mom used to make this for my Greek Dad - only she was of a creative turn and couldn't just follow a recipe. She would make it into individual crispy phyllo triangles and for years I thought that was what it should look like! Imagine my surprise at seeing a 'deep dish' version in a restaurant! Love both versions now:)

I made this recipe as is except I used dried dill.  I found it rather bland.  One child described it as "awful."  The other child picked at it and ate a bit.  My husband liked it.  Perhaps fresh dill is key

Made it as it said.  Way too much spinach, and too few phyllo sheets.

Yumtatsic! My whole family liked it including my picky two year old and extremely picky teens. I do think the fresh dill is key.

1-10-12:  This was pretty good even though in trying to thaw the dough, I immersed it in water and got it waterlogged.

I will make it again. I was intimidated by the phylo and idea of making this dish but then I read the recipe, shopped for ingredients, and it was easier than I thought.  My aldi was out of frozen spinach so I recommend buying 2 bags if you cook fresh spinach down with garlic and onion. I made it work with one bag. Dry parsley and dill worked fine. Feta works well as the only cheese. This isn't lasagna after all so don't skimp. It came out better than the Target appetizers I bought. You really only need about a half package of phyllo unless you make 2 pans then double the filling recipe.
