Talk about festive!  This is such a cute idea and it was a great not-so-sweet dessert.

This was my 1st time making any kind of pumpkin from scratch and not out of a can, let alone mini pumpkins. This had a very nice taste, but Probably because I'm a pumpkin novce, it tok me a long time to prepatre these. I used a whole lot more applesauce and spices for my 3 pumpkins. I ended up finishing these in the microwave due to time restrictions. Almost everyone liked the taste, but not the stringiness of the pumpkin. Dont know if that's the nature of the pumpkin or my baking. Whatever, I was asked to not make again. No more mini pumkins, may just go back to the canned stuff.

And to think that for years I threw these little pumpkins away after using them for decorations.  This recipe is so easy and so tasty!  I shared this with a single friend and she loved it...adjusting the recipe for one pumpkin was the perfect serving for one person!

Definitely a great way to serve pumpkin. Kids and adults enjoy it. I used kuri pumpkin which has a smokey, chestnut flavour and felt this made a difference with taste but also texture as it doesn't have the stringy pulp like a sugar pumpkin. Top with some whipped cream and enjoy!! Not to mention how the whole house smells like Fall all of a sudden. :-) Thank you for the recipe.

Agreed with Pearl about the stringiness of the pumpkin:  MIGHT TRY THIS:  BAKE PARTIALLY, AND THEN...... work as for twice baked potatoes?  Pull out the pulp, at least some of it, and then put that in a blender with some applesauce and spices, then refill the shells????  Just a thought... might not be well worth the trouble.....

I didn't add the pepper due to an allergy.  I also used unsweetened all natural applesauce so add a little local honey for some sweetness.  I was a perfect fall afternoon snack.
