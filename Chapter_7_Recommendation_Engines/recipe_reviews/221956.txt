great recipe. I used chanterelles because I didn't have any porcinis, and the dry white wine as suggested by the author. I strained out the mushrooms after the gravy was done since they were really chewy, but they contributed a lovely flavor to the gravy, giving it a rich earthiness which everyone at Thanksgiving loved. Thanks for the recipe!

Gravy with NO MSG!!!  This makes me so happy because store bought broth or buillon contains MSG, but this recipe is super yummy and doesn't call for any of the bad stuff.  I cut up the heart of the turkey.  Also, if you're short on turkey necks, a chicken thigh and leg are a great substitute.

Started this gravy yesterday and finished it today. After whisking in the turkey stock and started reducing I had a taste and it was quite rich and buttery. After adding some chicken stock and reducing it was very tasty with a nice sweetness to it. We couldn't find porcini mushrooms so we substituted shitake instead. Otherwise followed the recipe as read. We'll see what the family thinks tomorrow at dinner

Started this on the Sunday before Thanksgiving and it was fun to make and smelt so good simmering all day.  We had some wine that we brought back from Madeira so I used that instead of the Marsala.  That was the only change and the gravy came out just delicious and there was no last minute pressure to produce the perfect gravy. Another winner from Chef John!

This was awesome! I substituted shitake for porcini and it was great! I also made another variation of this for our vegetarian family members- made with everything except the turkey necks.
It was more of a mushroom gravy! Also- after making the gravy, I took all of the left over broth makings and put it in a crock pot over night with 2 more courts of water and more marsala and salt.
In the morning I had more broth and used that to pour over the cooked turkey after we cut it up and we stored it in the crock pot for serving. It worked great! Thank you!!

Thank you Chef John, this was a great start to a gravy. I like the added mushrooms, wine, and bay leaf I dont normally add. The dried porcini mushrooms were a little pricey so I used a handful of crimini mushrooms, which I sauteed with the onion and carrot. I made about 1/3 of the recipe as I only had 1 turkey neck. I used a sweet red Reisling in place of the Marsala as it was what I had. I liked the idea of sauteeing the neck bone before boiling. I let the bone and vegetables simmer for about 45 minutes, or so, as I was making much less. For the water I used a 24 oz bottle of chicken broth for 1/3 of the recipe. My addition was a cup or two of fat skimmed broth from my turkey. I made a roux with about 3-4 tblsp each of butter and flour (the full recipe amount) slowly whisking in the strained broth. I didnt bother with the small amount of cream. The gravy was plenty rich with the extra butter. Ty, and Happy Thanksgiving everyone!

This is a keeper recipe! I will be freezing this and using on Thanksgiving. So love the Marsala wine in this recipe. I only omitted the onions because I have family that is 'onion free'.

I have been making the same food network giblet gravy recipe for 12 years. This year I was up for a change and made this. Amazing! Very flavorful and the Marsala gives it a rich taste. The only thing I did different was double up on the Marsala.
