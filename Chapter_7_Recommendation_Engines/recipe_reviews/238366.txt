I had to use 2 (what I consider regular size) cucumbers to handle all the dressing the recipe makes, and I used the whole stalk of celery. I didn't have yogurt, so I used all sour cream. I also didn't have a lime, so I used a lemon. It was a good, light tasting salad. I will try it again with lime. *Update- I served this to my sister, and she loved it. I also tried it again with lime, and I liked it both ways.

We LOVED this! I used baby cukes (maybe 4), extra sour cream in place of the yogurt b/c I had none on hand and omitted the celery (personal preference). I can't believe it, but I totally forgot the vinegar in this, lol, but it was wonderful w/o it and stayed more on thick side rather than liquid-y, which we loved. I will def be making this again (the same way I did today)~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

I grow my own cucumbers and make my own goat milk yogurt, so this recipe suited what I had on hand.  The only change I made was using  all drained yogurt instead of adding the sour cream.  Everything else was the same.  I have made this twice, doubling and tripling the the recipe, and we ate every bit  It is a delicious way to use my bumper crop and holds in the refrigerator for several days.

Loved it! I didn't soak the cukes first, due to timing and still turned out wonderful!

I rate this between 4~5. One, I didnt have celery so I had to leave it out. However, I cant imagine only using a 1/2 a cucumber. I also really don't care for a lot of dressing, so I used 1 medium cucumber and halved the dressing. I used a garden cucumber and peeled and de-seeded it. I cut the onion and cucumber between 1/8~1/4 inch slices, as it really didnt say. I used non fat yogurt, reduced fat sour cream, but regular mayo, which was what I had. Made as written, here, I got 3 servings at approximately 78 calories each. Overall, it was a little more vinegary, or tart, than I like. For the lime juice I used 1 1/2 tsp. when I halved it. I might test a little less white vinegar, though, next time. However, I liked the dill flavor and that the dressing was not real thick. I would still make this again. Note: Second time making, and still halving the dressing, I only did 1 Tblsp of white vinegar instead of 2 and that worked perfect. May even add another half a cucumber due to extra dressing.

Gorgeous to serve - delicious to eat. Great basic recipe! Even better with a few additions: I added more cucumbers plus grape tomatoes, quartered. So colorful! Garbanzo beans made the dish more substantial and gave it additional texture that took it to the next level. I had no lime so used lemon & loved it. Besides the dill weed, I seasoned with a bit of basil, summer savory, & Beau monde. Delectable flavor. Next time I may add some feta cheese. Thanks a million for this one! Definite winner!

I used sour cream in place of the yogurt.  I used a whole cucumber and put in two teaspoons of dill.  We loved it!  It's definitely a repeat recipe.

Very tasty salad, thank you. I always buy Persian cucumbers, as we like them much better than "regular" ones (tender skin & meatier flesh). Since they're a lot smaller and thinner, I used 4. I only made two minor changes - omitted sour cream and just doubled the yogurt (Greek), and used 2 packets of Splenda instead of sugar because I'm cutting carbs. I doubt this made any difference in taste at all in this recipe.

This salad is awesome! I used rice vinegar, and Pampered Chef Dill Mix. I did not use yogurt as I didn't have any.

I didn't make any changes but the next time I make it, I will add more lime juice. We could hardly taste the lime.

4 stars because way too much dressing; you can at least double the cucumber.  Great flavor though.  I added extra dill and Will definitely make again!  The mayo makes it thicker but also tastes great without for less fat/calories.

It was okay. A bit bland and too runny for our liking. I wouldn't make it again.

Great !!! I made an even healthier version using 3/4 cup of Greek yogurt instead of sour cream and plain yogurt. It came out creamy and delicious

I cut back on vinegar, and used only sour cream and mayo. It seemed a bit mild for my taste, but it was good. A great dish for a potluck get together.

This went very well with a simple Indian curry I made with rice and vegetables (sauce from a jar). I also forgot the dill... but the salad still turned out alright!

Way too much vinegar. It invades the palette and you can barely taste anything else.

Delicious! I doubled the recipe using 2 cucumbers. Wasn't sure if I should seed the cukes or not, recipe didn't specify , picture looked like they were but I didn't, if it gets to watery I will do that next time. I think if you didn't have plain yogurt and used extra sour cream it would be fine, they are so close in flavor. Next time I think I will use seasoned rice vinegar instead of the apple cider vinegar.

very good! used yogurt in place of sour cream and fat free Waldens mayo.  Used 1/4 cup of yogurt and it still made a lot of dressing... and I forgot the vinegar
