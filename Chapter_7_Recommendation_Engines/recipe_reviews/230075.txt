Outstanding and so simple with two of my favorite combos, sweet potatoe and kale.  I switched the chorizo for Linguica (a portuguese sausage used in our natve Cape Verdean dishes- not as spicy as chorizo).  Also, if your sensitive to sodium I found with using low sodium chicken stock and reccomended salt was more than enough to season recipe.  Will be definatley be a keeper in the family  recipe box.

Very tasty if you like spice!  If not, I suggest reducing the paprika just a bit and using a mild sausage.  To make this soup a bit thicker, I added rice and lentil beans.  Worked great!

Delicious!  I switched the chorizo for some all natural chicken sausage for a low fat version.  I did not have the saffron but it still turned out great!

We live in a small town with one store, so I had to change a few things but this is a definite keeper!!!!  No Kale - used fresh spinach (which I will continue to do), no Saffron - I used an extra 1/2 tsp of Tumaric, no Chorizo - I used Italian sausage.  Otherwise, I followed it to the nth degree. It has room for more veggies, so I think I will try more carrots, sweet potato and spinach next time.  The seasoning was wonderful...  I didn't need to add salt at all.  Thanks for such a wonderful recipe!

My boyfriend loved this! Definitely a keeper. Made this with boiled chicken instead since we don't eat pork. Didn't have Saffron or Harissa, so skipped those. I used the chicken broth that I boiled the chicken in. I quickly added red pepper and seasoning salt at the last minute, before I served it to him, because it needed a kick (he likes spicy). Thank you for a great recipe.

yummo! Really good with complex flavours.. didn't have sausage so used chicken breast. I also was making for two, but used half of the veggies, spices and liquid specified for 8, there was a little too much but I will have the leftovers today for lunch! I substituted some of the chicken stock with half a can of tomatoes and didn't have any saffron so skipped that. Really needs the lemon, I wasn't sure about the taste until I added that at the end. Will definitely try with harissa next time. My husband liked it too, 'delicious' he said! Thanks for a great recipe!

This recipe is a definite keeper!!  My husband and I loved all the flavors.  I did omit the Harissa but other than that, followed the recipe to the letter.  I have made this twice within the last month and it will stay in my meal rotation!!

Love this soup! I used jalepeno chicken sausage instead of chorizo. I've experimented with adding some different dried chiles to the spice mix including a tsp of ethiopian berbere or Chile Arbol (the chile base of harissa). Both are delicious and spicy additions to the flavor. I also like to double the amount of kale and use a combo of yams & sweet potatoes. The soup is really fun to experiment with!

This was so good!  I did omit the saffron, because I don't enjoy saffron.  I was surprised by how great this was!  I don't usually cook with these flavors, and the end result was perfect.

I made it with lean mild turkey sausage because that's all I had on hand and it was phenomenal.  I can only imagine how tasty it would be with chorizo.  This recipe's a keeper!

Made with vegetable stock and no chorizo for vegan version.  Used a hot & spicy salt, which gave additional heat instead of harissa (didn't have any).  Added fine lemon zest before juicing the lemon at the end.  Used suggestion of others and added larger portions of sweet potato (doubled) and kale (6 cups instead of 4).  Will make again!

This soup is delicious!! I left out the lemon juice at the end, because the flavour from the put was just amazing and I didn't want to change it. I'll be making this monthly - guaranteed!

Amazing!  I have made this stew many times. The first time I used italian spicy sausages and it was a great mix of flavors.  Every other time I use the chorizo and my husband and I love it. He says both is good but the original recipe is better.

I made this as the recipe was written- to the letter. 

I am a lover of spice, and this was all heat without flavor. The little flavor it did offer was: salty. 

We are a family of five and not a single person ate this meal. 

I used pork Chorizo, perhaps that was the reason? No idea.

Pretty good! I had to adjust the spices, and will probably leave out the saffron the next time as I feel like it overpowers the rest of the amazing flavors.  I also added Sriracha, and used a curry blend instead of turmeric.  Shredded carrots work great and add nicely to the consistency.  I also left out one of the teaspoons of salt and would probably use low-sodium broth the next time I make this.  The spices and lemon juice add a ton of flavor without needing excess salt.

This was so delicious! Sweet and spicy and perfect for winter. Im trying to eat paleo as much as possible while pregnant with my first baby and this really hit the spot! Even my husband liked it and he is still a tad skeptical about the whole "paleo" idea. Thank you so much for sharing this!

My boyfriend loved this soup so much that he didn't want to share it with friends!  The only change I made to it was I used about a tablespoon of sriracha instead of harissa.  And I found from making this recipe twice that the flavors blend better if you get fresh chorizo and take the casing off.  It's a pretty noticeable improvement.  

This is a winner!

This recipe is delicious! We used ground chicken chorizo and added diced chicken breast as well. This recipe is a perfect soup for winter, and is perfect for our paleo lifestyle!

This is a must with a glass of red wine. We paired it with Campo Viejo Rioja, Tempranillo. Absolutely amazing!

This is a pretty tasty recipe. Prep time can be spread out through the cooking process. So the 40min isn't really that much.

Soo yummy! Was a little scared to try Kale, but glad I did! A bit spicy so we used a dollop of Sour Cream.
