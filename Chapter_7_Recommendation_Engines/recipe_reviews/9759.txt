My fianc√© and his friends love this recipe for cream-cheese brownies. Every time they come over, they always ask for it!
I don't put in the Walnuts, and I don't marble the brownies either: I put one layer of chocolate, then one layer of cream cheese topped off with the rest of the chocolate. I thne sprinkle chocolate chips over the top before baking. 
If you use dark chocolate, you will want to add a bit more sugar to the recipe or else it will not be as sweet. 
Enjoy!

I used baking cocoa with oil instead of melted chocolate, and only one egg instead of two in the chocolate batter.-- although the batter was really thick, the end product was delicious!

okay -- I am usually really good at sorting what the problem is when something goes wrong (with baking anyway). the taste of the brownies was good but the consistency was off... I even baked it longer and it did not cook very well. I have not had this problem before so I am stumped /:

Sooooo good! I always add extra vanilla to all my recipes, but these are worth all the work!

These weren't bad but a bit sweet for me even though I used semi-sweet chocolate instead of the German. I'll cut down on the sugar if I make them again and maybe increase the cream cheese.

I substituted orange juice and orange zest in the brownie mix. I also used orange juice in the cream cheese layer instead of vanilla. They were delicious!
