YUM:) and soo easy! I really think any kind of juice would work. My daughter likes it with grape juice and my step daughter likes it with sunny d! My sd is 7 and a rather picky eater (she thinks popsicles and candy are food groups) so we like to make smoothies/milkshakes for her and I LOVE this recipe because it only takes 2 ings, is ready in no time and is easy to customize to each person's tastes :)

Very good.  But it's not really like a shake cause of the high juice to ice cream ratio -- more of a, I don't know, just frostie sort of thing.  But whatever.  Even though it was good, I will say however that I didn't really notice the pineapple-banana part of the juice like I would if I just drank the juice.  It really tasted much like when I just scoop the ice cream (or more likely frozen yogurt) into a glass and pour orange juice over it... which is faster and doesn't dirty the blender.

I added canned pineapple to the ice cream, orange juice, and a few ice cubes to lighten it up a bit.  The taste reminded me a little of those yummy orange creamsicles.

Great taste, but seemed more like a smoothie than a shake.

Can't get much easier...2 ingredients and a blender, and you have a refreshing summertime drink.  I actually used a pineapple-orange-mango juice blend, and I think it would work well with any tropical juice combination.  We all enjoyed this one!
