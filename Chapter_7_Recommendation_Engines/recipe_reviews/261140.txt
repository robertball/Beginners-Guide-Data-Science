I made this today following the recipe exactly.  It's good for what it is -  gravy to use when you don't have the real thing.  Would be acceptable with, say, meatloaf.  Two things stand out for me: it took longer than 5 minutes to brown the flour and butter; getting it brown is crucial to the end colour of the gravy.  Secondly, next time I'd just add a drop or two at a time of the Worcestershire sauce at a time, tasting as I go - the taste of it was too strong for me in the end product.

I made a half recipe and double date the mustard and garlic. It was delicious.

It was very bland and seemed like something was missing. The ketchup was very overpowering. If I make  it again I will use about half of it.  I also added  some onion powder and brown sugar for a little sweetness.
