OK Everyone, I made this last night and it is a keeper !!! Very very good!!! I also did a few changes I used onions and green onions (tops only ). I added some red bell pepper, I used beef and sweet italian sausage. I was a little leary about the rosemary in this sauce, but what ever you do do not leave it out.(oh my god wonderful). Also use fresh rosemary, I used more garlic than call for ofcourse!!. I added basil and Italian seasoning to the meat mixture while cooking. After I added the sauce I added some red wine (a must). Also I added a teaspoon of sugar. Now I also used ricotta instead of cottage cheese, I used a Italian penne pasta (Imported kind found in supermarket). I was also not to sure about the sour cream I do not like it at all, but I used it. Also do not leave it out made a big difference. I layered mine and baked covered for 35 min then uncovered for 10 min more. I served with garlic bread and a soft white wine. HEAVEN!!!.

Good stuff! This is a really strong recipe at its core. I would just modify some of the basic elements...especially step no. 4. Here are the recommendtions I would make to give this recipe a five star rating:
1. Mix the sour cream, cottage cheese, mozzarella and parmesan together in a bowl. 2. Mix the pasta into the meat sauce. After spraying the casserole dish with non-stick spray, layer half the pasta/meat sauce in the dish. Spread the cheese mix on top of the bottom layer. Layer the rest of the pasta/meat sauce on top. Finish the casserole by placing the six slices of Provolone cheese and then bake. Twenty minutes at 350 was perfect. 

Other changes I made: I used 28 ounces of home made tomato sauce. The recipe was not specific enough for me - it said, "1 1/2 (26 ounce) jars spaghetti sauce" ...So is that 26 ounces total? Or is it 39 ounces? Another change I made is I used a pound of ground beef since I did not have the pork sauage on hand. I think the sausage would make it even better. Anyway, this recipe will fullfil a lasagna craving with half the effort.

Added some extra spices to the meat mixture--minced garlic. basil, oregeno,salt and pepper.  Used ricotta instead of cottage cheese.  Used 8 oz. of sour cream and 15 oz. of ricotta.  Mixed everything together in a large pot, except for the provolone cheese.  Put a small layer of sauce in the bottom of the pan, threw in half the ziti mixture, then the provolone, then the rest of the ziti. I have been making lasagna for years, and think from now on I will use this recipe....much easier to prepare.  Was a bit leary of the sour cream, but texture was wonderful.  My Italian husband said this was the best ziti he's ever had.  My sons went NUTS over this.  Thanks.

Mine turned out DELICIOUS.  This was a great basic recipe.  I made several additions/changes:
I used ground beef and ground sweet Italian turkey sausage, removed from the casings.  To the beef mixture, I added a pinch of dried rosemary, dried oregano, dried basil, and some red pepper flakes.  For the cheese mixture, I didn't have sour cream, so I used softened 8 oz. cream cheese mixed with 8 oz. of ricotta cheese, mixed with 3/4 cup shredded parmesan cheese.  After the sauce mix was done, I added about half of it to the cooked ziti, which I stopped boiling one minute before al dente.  Barilla's ziti, which I used, is 10 mins to al dente, but I cooked it for 9 mins.  It was perfect for the baked dish.  Okay, so with half the sauce and beef mixed in with the pasta, I layered the pasta with sauce mix in a 9 x 13 pan, then placed the layer of provolone cheese on top of that.  I then spread the cream cheese/ricotta mix on top of the provolone slices, then the rest of the pasta and sauce mix.  After that, I poured the rest of the marinara/beef mix on it evenly.  I had a bit of the cream cheese/ricotta mix left, so I dotted it on top of the last layer of sauce, then finished with a layer of mozzarella. I baked it at 400 F for 20 minutes, until the mozzarella was brown.  It was a tasty meal.  I think I prefer it over lasagna.  My fiancé loved it, and ate two huge helpings.  I only had one serving because my thighs are huge enough.

As a lasagna lover, I love this dish.  Easier to make but tastes the same.  Also substituted cottage cheese for the more traditional ricotta.  Sprinkle on some oregano instead of rosemary for true Italian flavor.  
Note that the recipe puts ALL of each type of cheese on a certain layer, they are 
not repeated on subsequent layers (i.e., use all your ricotta/provolone on the first layer!)

WONDERFUL!! I was skeptical, cottage cheese?? Okay, I cut the recipe to serve 4. ATE the entire pan myself!! REMADE it for 8 so that the family could try. They loved it! So, I just finished eating the last morsel as I searched for new things to cook. Finding this site was a diaster I am getting nothing done but filling the freezer and running to the grocery store! LOVED IT.. thanks..

Wow, this is good!  I played with it a bit to make it a little more healthy and can't believe how good it turned out!  I subsituted the beef and pork with ground turkey and hot turkey sausage, casings removed.  I also used non-fat cottage cheese and sour cream.  The only thing I'd do differently next time is I'd cut down on the amount of mozarella and provolone cheese - a little too much for my liking.  All in all this got rave reviews from everyone who ate it...A+

This turned out well. I used less ground beef and more sausage... went with a Spicy Italian. Browned the onion with the meat and the garlic, used 2 jars Barilla's Boscaiola Sauce (Mushroom and Garlic) and added 1 and 1/2 tsp. dried rosemary to the sauce. Mixed the sour cream (1/2 cup) with the ricotta (15 oz.) and the mozzarella (8 oz.) and parm along with 1 tsp. dried basil and a bit of S & P. I also added an egg to the cheese mixture. Layered some SAUCE FIRST, 1/2 pasta mixed with cheese, 1/2 provalone, more sauce, and repeated, topped with alot more sauce. You might need to open an extra jar. I needed a bit more, but I did use extra cheese.
Great pot luck dish. I have used Barilla's Arrabiata Sauce in this as well, and it's really good, too. Tastes even better leftover. Thanks, Seth!

I doubled the recipe but did not necessarily double all of the ingredients. Definitely altered it a bit. I used about 1 1/2lb of ground sirloin which I mixed with garlic, rosemary, basil, oregano and fresh parsley. Also par boiled 1lb of mild Italian sausage and then cut each link in half and then quarters which I then added to the sirloin mixture. I also used ricotta cheese instead of cottage cheese. Mixed the ricotta (15 oz) with about 8 oz of sour cream and 10oz of frozen chopped spinach (make sure it is thawed and all the water squeezed out). Very yummy! I did not use all of the cheese it calls for, mostly mozzarella but cut down on the amount of provolone. Did not layer just threw everything into a roaster (much better and easier to mix) and mixed all together. I did put about 1 inch of water on the bottom of roaster along with spraying Pam so there was no sticking. Since I am 100% Italian I made my own sauce and really used a ton of it (probably equivalent to 3 jars of store bought). Sprinkled mozzarella cheese on top. Since I doubled I had to bake longer, about 50 minutes. Finishing touch was freshly grated parmesan cheese. Wow! What a hit. Everyone had seconds. Definitely will make again and again!

I do not believe this can be "the best" when you have to buy pre-made spaghetti sauce. It will be different for everyone depending on the type of sauce used. I would prefer the sauce included in the recipe, but I will make my own.

I prepared this recipe two different ways; the first was similar to the original.  I replaced cottage cheese with Ricotta, used 2 jars of sauce, and mixed some of the sauce on the all of the noodles before putting in pan; the dish stayed very moist.  For the second I replaced the beef/sausage with chicken (3 breasts cut up), used 2 jars or Alfredo, mixed spinach into the ricotta/sour cream mixture, and omitted the Provolone.  Mixed all the noodles into the Alfredo, layered the spinach mixture in the middle of two layers of noodles and sprinkled an Italian cheese mixture on top.  I used a little more garlic then called for a variety of Italian spices (Rosemary, basil, garlic, red bell pepper, spinach and herb, and even a little Southwestern Spice for a little more zip ~ don't be afraid).  Enjoy!

My husband and daughter loved this dish.(She ate two helpings, and she watches her weight! It is Easy and good. The cheeses and sour cream soften the acidity often found in tomato saucey Italian dishes. I used a combination package of mozzarella and provelone "Pizza" cheese in the dairy case at the supermarket. I also mixed the cottage cheese and sour cream together.(Good way to use up those leftover dabs of sour cream and cottage cheese). Couldn't find fresh rosemary so used dried.

Rosemary really makes this recipe; don't bother with it if you're going to omit it. Fresh rosemary is soft & gets softer when sauteed with the onion so it works well in soft pasta; no worries over the pine needle effect of dried rosemary. Sour cream is also something not to be dispensed with in this recipe. Here's how I made mine: chopped onion and sauteed with rosemary, Italian seasoning, garlic powder (out of fresh garlic)& black pepper; set aside. Then Sauteed 1lb each ground beef & sausage with seasonings listed above & added two jars of sauce --no idea how you could do with less sauce. I cooked the ziti, strained, then poured back into the warm pot. Mixed sour cream, ricotta and parmesan cheese together in a bowl (I used 8oz = half a large tub of fat-free Breakstones sour cream, and 16 oz = half a large 2lb tub of part skim ricotta cheese). I then mixed the ricotta/parm/sour cream mixture into ziti in the warm pot & added onions and rosemary with it; just incorporates better this way. I layered the bottom of the pan with meat sauce, then ziti, then used a whole package of Sargento provolone round slices, plus two more from a second package, to completely cover the ziti layer. Then added more sauce, then remaining ziti, then more sauce, then covered the top with a whole 2-cup bag of mozzarella cheese. Baked for 45 minutes at 350 with a cookie sheet under a deep casserole; no idea how a 9 x13 would work here. This has such great & unique flavor. It's a keeper.

Tastes like lasagne, but much less work. I made it for a sports party (mostly men) and it got rave reviews. I substituted ricotta for cottage cheese and added basil and oregano to the rosemary.  I also had extra sauce on the side for those who wanted it and most people used it.

Am somewhat embarrassed to admit that the family lost all civility over this dish, it was amazing...we were pigs, all decorum lost. Usually a dish like this lasts us several days....there was barely enough left for leftovers the next day. Son and hubster did "rock/paper/scissors" for the last serving. Seriously. I only had Italian turkey sausage on hand, but the way we acted, i don't see where that made much of a diff....the only alteration i made, due to personal family preferences, was to add some peperoncino (sp?) flakes for some "palette zing." We like zingy food so i had to add that.  THANKS SETHALLEN this is truly a winner in this family!  ;O)

Love, love, love this recipe.  It's very easy and got two thumbs up from my hubby and 6 yr old daughter.  The only change I made was adding 1/4 cup red wine and it turned out amazing!! Thank you so  much for submitting this great recipe.

YUM!  Had ground beef to use up, so a full pound went into this; no sausage.  I'm sure it'd be that much better with it.  Just dice the onions and throw them in to brown with the meat (no need for the extra oil), then add the garlic just a minute or two before the meat is done. Used 15 oz ricotta, blended with a couple of shakes of grated parmesan, salt/pepper and a splash of milk to moisten  in place of the cottage cheese and used enuf lite sour cream to make a thin layer -- wound up being closer to a full cup I'd guess.  Used 2 full jars of sauce -- used extra mozzarella and plenty of fresh parm on top.  OMG -- soooo good!  All with items normally on hand...Way to go Seth!

I made this dish in my customary lasagna pan.  My husband came home and peeked under the foil, expecting lasagna, but being a good Sopranos fan he recognized baked ziti and got the cutest grin.  "Is this what I think it is??"  I used sliced Italian sausage instead of ground, and ricotta instead of cottage cheese.  It's terrific!

This was truly fantastic.  I left out the sausage because I didn't have any, I did one half sour cream and one half ricotta instead of all sour cream.  I kept the rest of the recipe the same and it was the best ziti I've ever had.  It was amazing!  I know some of you are probably wondering about the sour cream and are hesitant to use it...as was I, but it is not to be skipped.  Added a great creaminess that you just don't get from ricotta alone.  Try it, you will LOVE this recipe.

A Soprano worthy recipe.  Made it for the first episode of season six. 

As I am on weight watchers I used low fat sour cream and mozza.  Provolone was needed for flavour.  I also used (low fat) ricotta.  I used low fat beef and italian turkey sausage.

Dear hubby is not on weight watchers, but never noticed my "renos" and raved how I had "just whipped this up" had more helpings than I will post.

this is my go to recipe for ziti. I have replaced my lasagna with it since it's so much easier to make and taste delicious.  I usually add more Italian seasonings, but I do that to all my Italian recipes.  I prefer ricotta when I can get it.  I also use gluten free pasta since I am gluten intolerant and it holds up well in this recipe, even as left overs.

Awesome--make sure you get the sauce over all of the noodles before placing it in the oven--if not you get crunch edges on the pasta.

This was really good, but made a few changes. Used ricotta instead of cottage cheese and mixed it in a bowl with sour cream and parsley before layering. I used 2 cups ricotta and 1 cup sour cream. I also added oregano and basil to the onion mixture and a little bit of oregeno to the hamburger/sausage while browning. I used a full pound each of lean ground beef and Jimmy Dean hot sausage. Cooked 30 mins. with foil cover and 15 mins. with cover off. Great recipe~

This is DELICIOUS!  I grew up eating homemade Italian food so I was a little skeptical of eating baked ziti made with sour cream and cottage cheese but it's delicious and so easy to put together.  I did use my own homemade meat sauce and substituted an equal amount of mozzarella for the provolone layer because I don't like provolone cheese.  I will always use this recipe to make baked ziti from now on.

This is a good baked ziti recipe. My family enjoys it very much. I substitute the provolone cheese with Swiss sometimes. It is still just as good.

My family LOVE LOVE LOVED, this recipe!!! I actually doubled the sauce so that I could feeze half of it to use for another meal later. Instead of ground beef and pork sausage I used ground turkey and turkey italian sausage (sweet). I also used part skim ricotta instead of cottage cheese.  Other than that I cooked it just as suggested and it was SO TASTY!! It was very easy to make and I will definitely be making this again!

I took a shortcut and mixed the meat sauce with the pasta, and switched out the cottage cheese for ricotta which I mixed with the sour cream.  This was great, and for once my husband and I BOTH cleaned our plate!

Verry good.  I really liked the sauce when it was mixed with the sour cream and cheese.  I was worried there might be too much cheese but it was perfect.  Excellent receipe!

Followed it exactly - except used dried rosemary (out at the market) and cut the cottage cheese and sour cream in 1/2.  Added a 1/4 c. good red wine to meat sauce.  EXCELLENT!  My mother is a Ziti fanatic and she said it was hands down, best ever.  Will be making this with my son 4 days after trying it the first time!  Tradition....

A great recipe to throw together & incredibly easy to make as well. I only use ground beef in mine, but that is my personal preference. I also substitute ricotta cheese for the cottage cheese.

This recipe was so good, even my mom asked for it!  Made it twice, once with layers and once without, didn't notice any difference.  If anything, it was easier to make without layers and tasted just as good.

The rosemary makes the dish particularly fragrant and delicious. I used only sour cream (low fat), as I had no cottage cheese and used Smart Balance mozzerella. Don't care for the dominating flavor of sausage so went with mostly ground beef + about 3 oz spicey italian sausage.  It was really good, but my boyfriend only gave it 4 stars and said it needed something to get it into the 5 star arena. I think next time I'll go a little cheesier, and maybe throw in some Italian seasoning. I suspect using a really quality tomato sauce, would make it out of this world.

Great easy recipe.  I used ricotta instead of the cottage cheese and used mini penne in place of the ziti.  I also used all ground beef and used Italian sausage flavored spaghetti sauce.  I probably made more sauce than the recipe called for so it wouldn't be dry.  Flavor was outstanding.

This is the best Ziti recipe.  I added crimini mushrooms and lots of fresh basil to the sauce before adding it to the meat.  For the meat, I used sweet Italian turkey sausage and lean ground beef.  Instead of pre-made jar sauce, I made my own with a 14oz can of diced tomatoes, a 14oz can of crushed tomatoes, and some tomato paste.

Excellent!! I must admit that when I first read the list of ingredients, my first thought was that the cottage cheese and sour cream were a bit odd to have in a baked ziti recipe, but all I can say is WOW!!  Definately a keeper!!!!!!

Delicious!!! My husband and toddler loved as well.  The only thing I changed was replacing ricotta for the cottage cheese.  I also was generous with the minced fresh rosemary.  According to my dh the defining ingredient is the rosemary.  Thanks Seth!! This one is making it into our rotation!

I've made this twice now and have been asked for the recipe both times.  This will be a sure hit in my recipe file.  I used half beef and half italian sausage, ricotta cheese instead of cottage and on one occasion didn't have provolone so used monterrey jack.  turned out just as good. also used sweet onions and cooked them slowly so the flavor comes out.  sooo good!  thanks.

This was awesome.  Being a vegetarian, I omitted the sausage and hamburger and
it was wonderful.  I made minor additions (chives and asiago cheese) and used more
cheese than the recipe called for, but I love cheese.  My husband loved it as well
and we decided that this one is definitely a keeper.  Thanks for sharing!

I made this for a group of hungry teens.  I doubled the recipe and was able to feed 18 teens and most of them were able to have a second helping.  This recipe makes a lot as is.  This was exactly what I needed.  Everyone loved it.

This was delicious! The herbs and sausage additions really made the dish. I didn't have the sliced provolone, sour cream, and cottage cheese, so I used a bit of ricotta and Italian shredded cheese on top. I made a pan for our neighbors, too, and they loved it!

Absolutely delicious!  I doubled the meats and ricotta because everyone in my household LOVES them both in abundance.  I also followed the suggestions of others to cover with foil for the first 20 minutes, then uncover for the last 10. This is sure to become a regular in my home!

I chose this recipe because I had cottage cheese to use up and also had some fresh rosemary.  This ziti recipe did not disappoint - the family loved this for dinner tonight.

Excellent!  Recommendations:  Use Italian sausage instead of the ground pork.  Use 80/20 ground round insted of regular ground beef.  Swap out the sliced onions for 3T dried onion flakes and add them to the cooked meat & sauce.  Pour off all excess fat from the meat.  Blot with top with paper toweling if necessary.  After meat is cooked and sauce is added, stir in 1/4 c. chopped fresh flat leaf parsley and set aside.  Combine the cheeses and sour cream (reserve 1/4 cup for topping).  Fold cheese/sour cream into the pasta.  Spoon in the pasta/cheeese mixture into a generously sprayed or buttered baking dish.  Spoon meat/sauce mixture over pasta and gently spread to edges.  Dot with teaspoonfuls of reserved cheese/sour cream.  Bake at 30 till bubbly OR microwave on 50% power for 10-12 minutes till bubbly.  Enjoy!  This is my go to recipe for pasta bakes or lasagna!

WOW, the best!  Like other reviewers, I thought the addition of sour cream sounded odd.  However, other reviews also said, DON’T leave it out.  Reluctantly I added it.  Don’t know if this is what made this particular recipe better than others, but from now on; my ziti will always be made with sour cream.  I didn’t have pork, so I doubled the ground beef and used ricotta instead of cottage cheese.  I mixed all the ingredients together with the exception of the provolone and parmesan cheeses.  Poured the mixture into a Pyrex dish and topped with the provolone and parmesan.  Baked covered for 15 minutes and uncovered for another 20 minutes.   After dinner, my husband stated that he’d be having the leftovers for lunch!  I’ve been trying for years to find a ziti recipe that he really likes, success!   Thanks SETHALLEN for this simple and lovely recipe!

We just finished dinner - and wow!  I made it (almost) just as written and it was delicious.  I'm not sure why so many people are subbing ricotta for the cottage cheese.  It tastes great with the cottage cheese, and frankly, ricotta is so much more expensive!  I also mixed the cheeses together and stirred the mixture into the pasta, and then just layered twice with the sauce in between and on top.  Next time I want to try adding the chopped spinach as another reviewer suggested - that's always a good combination.

I have made this several times for either personal consumption or for Sunday Football parties and nothing gets left behind. The only changes I make, I add some extra spices to the meat sauce. Such as garlic powder, onion salt and Italian seasoning.

i made this for my boyfriend's birthday. after tasting it, he said it was even better than lasagna, and lasagna is his favorite dish. the only changes i made were adding some italian seasoning to the meat mixture, mixing the sauce with the noodles, and adding a little more parmesan than called for on top. delicious!!!

Loved this dish, made a few additions/changes.  I added mushrooms & zucchini in with the onion and cooked it all thoroughly.  And instead of just rosemary, I used an italian seasoning blend that had basil, oregano, etc.  It doesn't say to do so, but I mixed all the cheese ingredients together (except for the sliced provolone) and made that my single "middle layer".  So the bottom layer was half the noodles/meat mixture, then the middle cheese layer, then the other half of the noodles/meat on top.  Topped off the dish with the sliced provolone.  Yum!  Oh, and unless you've got a full family to feed, you'll have leftovers for awhile...this dish will feed a small army!

This was a big hit at my son's birthday party.  I used 2 jars of sauce and 1 lb each of the hamburger and sweet italian sausage.  I also added a little extra cottage cheese.  I will definately make this again, but probably scale it down for a family of 4!

This is a great recipe for large groups.  I've made it several times already while changing an ingredient or two each time.  Try replacing the cottage cheese with ricotta, and sweet Italian sausage or ground turkey for the ground beef.  If using ground turkey, added salt, pepper, garlic, basil, & oregano.  To help decrease the calories and fat even further, I used low-fat ingredients (cheeses, etc) and it still tasted great.  I also tried different jarred spaghetti sauces and the best one was Paul Newman's Sookarooni.  My 2 picky boys even enjoy this meal, which is a testimony in itself!

I've made this several times, and it is wonderful!  I added some oregano, basil, crushed red pepper, extra garlic, 2 whole jars of Mid's sauce, and extra cheeses...using ricotta.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Hands down the best baked ziti recipe I've ever had!!  I used a shredded mix of mozzarella and provolone cheese and substituted ricotta (just because I prefer it over cottage cheese) and added a little basil while sauteeing the onions.  Everyone devoured this! (And they're picky eaters, believe me) I think the sauce would do good just served over spaghetti too, if you like...it's that good. :):):) Thanks for sharing!

This ziti didn't know my socks off but it was really, really tasty. We will definitely make it again.  The flavor was really good.  The rosemary is a great addition to the seasoning. We used ground turkey and turkey sausage.  And since I didn't realize that I didn't have ziti in the pantry until it was time to cook, I used penne instead... which turned out fine.  It reminded me a lot of a lasagna.  I added Italian seasoning since turkey is harder to season than beef.  I also used 2 jars of sauce which worked out really well since my husband likes his pasta saucy.  This would be great for potluck or party.. it makes a HUGE portion.  I have a feeling we will be eating this for lunch for the next 3-4 days!  thanks Seth!

Excellent!  I was skeptical with all the hype in the ratings, but it definitely lived up to it.  Next time I will use dry rosemary- it wasn't worth buying a bunch of it for only a teaspoon. I also used part-skim dairy where I could.

I had high hopes for this dish because of all the glowing reviews, but it was even better than I expected! It didn't look like it was all going to fit in the 9x13 dish, but it did; I thought it would last a week with us eating at it, but it didn't! My boyfriend and I ended up having half of it just by ourselves the day we made it, it was so good we didn't want to eat anything else, and then my friend and her boyfriend came over and ate the rest! So we have to make it again today. No regrets though, it's a beautifully simple recipe.

I did make some minor changes. I used all ground beef since we didn't have any ground sausage, and I used a very fennel-heavy pasta sauce from Trader Joe's. I used dried rosemary instead of fresh, and it didn't have enough kick so I added some Creole Seasoning, basil, and tarragon, which made it *perfect*. We made a very complicated Spaghetti Bolognese recipe from AllRecipes.com a few days ago (involved about 40 minutes prep and 1.5 hours simmering!), but the meat mixture from this, with just a few minutes prep, is way better.

This recipe was SOOO good!  It was a huge hit at my dinner party.  I used ground turkey and spicy pork sausage and it turned out great.  I would suggest using the spicy sausage or adding some more spices bc otherwise it turns out a bit bland.

I did like this dish but I added over twice the amount of cheese and cottage cheese. Nothing wrong with cottage cheese.  I know many who use it instead of ricotta but the fresh rosemary is very awkward in this dish. Will not add it again. Instead add fresh oregano!

Wow!  This recipe is really tasty.  I didn't have Rosemary so I didn't use it but I stayed true to recipe the rest of the way.  My entire family really enjoyed this dish.  The best part was it wasn't too rich.  This is a keeper!

This is incredible!  I combined the sour cream, cottage cheese and Parmesan and use my own spaghetti sauce. I covered with foil I had sprayed with Pam. Cooked for one hour removed foil and cooked for twenty additional minutes. Remove from oven and let stand for at least ten minutes before serving.

We make this routinely to feed large crowds, i.e. teenagers (24+), company, or family event, and we get great feedback.
Improvements: replace cottage cheese with Philadelphia cream cheese.
If you like a bit more seasoning, put in 2 teaspoons (instead of 1) of fresh rosemary and fresh oregano along with some basil, garlic and black pepper.
For large groups, this scales up easily, but allow extra cook time!  We make a double recipe in a 11”x17” pan and leave the final layer of cheese off the top and cover it with foil and cook it for 30 minutes and then take the foil off, sprinkle with cheese and cook it for another 30 minutes.  Consider making separate dishes with no dairy for those who are lactose intolerant or no meat for vegetarians, but smaller pans won’t need the whole hour of cook time.  If you store it in the refrigerator before cooking it, add another 15-30 minutes of cook time depending on pan size.

Made this recipe and it turned out fantastic!  I opted to use all ground pork sausage and it was super tasty my kids couldn't get enough of it!  There was enough for them to eat it three days in a row and they cheered every time I served it. Like another reviewer I also opted to use ricotta instead of cottage cheese and oregano instead of rosemary, and just to add some greens to the recipe I also added some frozen spinach and a grated zucchini to the sauce mixture as it cooked. Definitely give this recipe a try to please the pasta lovers in your family!

My husband and I loved this recipe. I chose this one out of the other highly-ranked baked zitis because I was curious about the rosemary. like many reviewers, I love lasagna but don't love spending 3-4 hours making it, having the stay at home the whole time to make sure the house doesn't catch on fire. this satisfies a lasagna craving with half the time, effort, and clean-up. I did make a few changes like most people but mostly because of practical reasons, but I tried hard to stay true to the recipe. I didn't have easy access to provolone and the alternative was too expensive, so I just used more Parmesan. I didn't use cottage cheese because I didn't like the preservatives and additives in it. I only used beef -- no pork sausage. and I didn't bother chopping the rosemary, just stripped the leaves from the stalks and threw them in. speaking of, the rosemary was AWESOME in this dish, so while you might be temped to skip it, DON'T. I probably used more rosemary than the recipe stated, but I'll probably add even more next time I make this. YUM. Might add in some basil too because I have it growing in a pot, as long as basil and rosemary go good together. I also cooked it for only 20 minutes. On top of all that,for two people, this'll last us a few days, which justifies the money spent on the cheese, meat, and herbs. Admittedly I would also like a spaghetti sauce recipe included, but then the time and effort would raise to that of cooking lasagne.

Super yummy and the whole family enjoyed it...tell you the truth ..I was to get trying to get rid of the majority of a 16 oz container of fat free cottage cheese and this was perfect camouflage! We used fat free sour cream as well...but definately leave in the sausage for flavor!

This is a family favorite. Kids loved this!  Couldn't fit second layer of sauce, so saved it for next time in freezer.  Used small curd cottage cheese which was easy to spread and resembled ricotta.  This will be on the menu every week!

This tasted great!  The only substitution I made was to use Italian sausage instead of pork sausage for a little more taste/spice.  Definitely a keeper!

This recipe was delicious.  I had ricotta cheese on hand and used it in place of the sour cream and cottage cheese.  I will cut down on the rosemary next time I make it, and I will definitely make it again.  The family loved it.

Our church was hosting a dinner after the funeral of one of our members.  One of the ladies organizing it asked me to bring baked ziti.  I'd never made it before and came to my trusty Allrecipes.  I chose this one and just had one of the ladies tell me she loved it.  Thank you for a great recipe! I did make some minor changes after reading some reviews.  I used *all* Italian sausage, tossed the meat in w/ the sauce and then tossed the pasta w/ *that* to make sure the sauce got into the tubes. I also mixed the sour cream and ricotta together and layered, pasta, ricotta/s.cream mix (sprinkled that layer w/ basil and oregano and a little garlic powder) put the provolone down and then finished w/ the rest of the pasta/sauce/meat mix and topped w/ mozzarella and parm. cheese.

Made this again tonight and I love the versatility of this recipe.  You can switch up the cheese and meat and still have a great dish.  I use ricotta instead of cottage. And I added shredded cheddar because I didn't have provolone. Mixed it all up together and walla!

This recipe was very easy and tasty. I did use another viewer's suggestion and added my own version by mixing sour cream & ricotta cheese with some parmesean cheese and spread over the layers of noodles with the mozerella and provolone. Stop with sause after each layer and top with more mozorella and parmasean before baking.

I love this because it makes a very large portion! Next time, I will divide this into two 9x9 dishes and freeze one to avoid so many leftovers. Would be excellent for company.

Made for first time and it was delicious. The noodles were a little dry on bottom. We rate recipes 1-10. This is a 91/2. I made with changes of griller3 reviewer and it was very good. Thanks to all the reviewers, as I always go to their remarks before trying any recipe. I also did not have the red wine as she suggested.......still delicious with changes.

This is the best ziti I have made...and i ve made alot of ziti! I think the key was the mix of sour cream and cottage cheese! I left out the onion due to personal preference, but added onion powder. I scaled the reciepe down and it was still too much so be careful!

The recipe is pretty good.  I did not have fresh rosemary on hand so I used dried.  I thought the sauce was really meaty--my husband loved it but I am not a big meat eater.  I would have liked more sauce and less meat.  I made mine in two 8x8 pans and gave one to a friend who just had a baby.  It worked well and I think they were satisified.  Thanks for the recipe.

My fiance loved it.  He said the addition of pork was what really made it stand out.  Unfortunately, I didn't have any ground beef, so it was just pork.  I used 4 cups of sauce (32 ounce).  It was alright, but there could have been more sauce.

Had the adult children over for dinner last night and made this ... everyone LOVED it.  Served it with "Classic Tossed Salad" from this site and garlic bread.  Awesome meal.  One note:  the jar of spaghetti sauce is no longer 26 oz. .... it is 23.5 oz.  You will need to make the adjustment to get the amount called for in the recipe.  With a lb. of pasta, you need the 39 oz. of sauce or it will be too dry.

My husband could not get enough of this! I didn't even get a crack at the leftovers, The provolone really gave it a great flavor as well as helped to hold it together when served. I will start using that in my lasagne from now on!

We liked this one!  I followed the recipe with the exception of using all hot Italian turkey sausage instead of the beef and pork sausage.  We saved a few calories that way and still enjoyed this very much.  I also deviated by putting some Italian seasoning in the meat sauce and a few crushed red peppers for a little kick.  I made half the recipe and put it in an 8x8” baking pan - it fit very nicely.  We froze the leftovers for a couple of easy meals to have later on.

Wonderful just as is.  Just make sure you use a large enough baking dish and bake until bubbly throughout.  The rosemary makes this dish special.

Added 1/2 lb of italian sausage with 1 lb of ground beef cooked with an onion and then added to sauce.  Simple and delicious. Made for Christmas- very little left.

We tested out this recipe & decided we loved it.  So we made it in our mobile volunteer kitchen for our volunteer construction group of 250 people.  It was a hit with all.  Towards the end of assembling the pans of ziti we ran out of meat sauce so we used up the cheeses & the cottage/sour cream mix to assemble one last pan.  It made the most amazing macaroni & cheese any of us in the kitchen had ever had.  Thank you so much for sharing this great recipe.

Tasty!  Next time, I’ll use ricotta cheese though since I prefer that over sour cream/cottage cheese.  I’ll also add an additional 8-12 or so oz. of sauce as I felt that it was a bit lacking.  I used lean ground beef and 2 mild Italian link sausages with the casings removed, and seasoned the meat liberally with garlic powder, oregano, Italian seasoning, onion powder, and salt and pepper.  I also threw in some pre-minced garlic with the meat rather than use fresh (easier!), and added approx 1/2 c. red wine to the sauce/meat mixture.  Also, I mixed the sauce and meat with the cooked noodles (stopped cooking noodles two minutes before they were done since they’d cook more in the oven).  My layers were as follows: 1/2 of the meat and sauce and noodles mixture, then the sour cream/cottage cheese/Parmesan cheese/mozzarella cheese all mixed together as the next layer, followed by the other 1/2 of the meat and sauce and noodles mixture, followed by Provolone cheese on top.  The Provolone came out a little over-done, so next time, I’ll either cover the dish or add the Provolone during the last 10 minutes.

This was very good.  Add more cottage cheese and sour cream than recipe called for and it came out very creamy.

Loved this!  My parents were visiting and they loved it too - my mom got a copy of the recipe to make at my brothers.  1 change - I did not use the rosemary - the first time I made it my family thought it was too strong of a flavor.

OMG! This was fantastic! I made a few minor changes... first, I used a homemade pasta sauce instead of a jar ("Best Marinara Sauce Yet"- yummy! also from this site), and I added a little fresh oregano and fresh basil to the meat mixture. My boyfriend flipped over this meal!

My husband and I both agreed that this is the best baked ziti we've ever had.  As a previous reviewer suggested, I used sweet Italian sausage as my pork sausage.  I also used 12 slices of provolone cheese (6 per layer) and an 8 oz. (2 c.) package of shredded mozzarella.  To simplify the preparation, I sauteed the chopped onion and minced garlic with the beef and sausage as it cooked, and added the minced fresh rosemary with a little salt, pepper, and basil at the end with the sauce.  The fresh rosemary gives the taste an added boost; I'm very glad I used it!  I also simplified assembly by mixing the cottage cheese and sour cream, and added some Parmesan cheese, salt, pepper, basil, garlic powder, and parsley to this mixture to give it a little more flavor, although I'm sure it's good as written too.  Thanks for a great ziti recipe!

I loved this recipe!!  I especially love the combination of italian sausage and ground beef together.  NExt time I will probably mix the meat and sauce together with the cheeses instead of layering it in the dish.  Otherwise I will definitely be making this again!

Our family has become known for this ziti recipe - we are always asked to bring it and take it every year to the outer banks for vacation.  I am always asked for the recipe and am more than happy to point them to this site.  I've made various changes over the years but regardless of what I do, it's always delicious!  This is most definitely THE BEST Baked Ziti recipe - HANDS DOWN.  Yummmmmmmmmm!

Made so many times.  Always excellent.  I use skim ricotta with an egg and parsley mixed in instead of cottage cheese.  FF sour cream and skim cheeses work.  Drain meat and pasta well.

Wow! The sour cream really tops this ziti off perfectly!  I used reduced fat sour cream, 1% cottage cheese and part skim mozzarella,ground turkey and turkey sausage (casings removed) to cut back the fat a little.  I also did not use rosemary because my grocery store was out of fresh, but I did use extra garlic and it still turned out wonderful!  Next time I will try the fresh rosemary as well as adding oregano and basil as many others suggested.  Guess my point is don't be afraid to try this if you don't have the rosemary, although I'm sure it makes it more wonderful, It's still so worth it without!

WOW!! I took the advice of some of the reviewers and subbed the ricotta instead of cottage cheese and kept the sour cream in even though i hate it by it self.(couldnt even tell it was there) I subbed oregano for the rosemary also. I made this for the superbowl halftime and it was gone in 10 min! I had to push through everyone just so i could taste my own cooking before it was all gone! It was heaven...thanks!

My Italian husband gave it a thumbs up!  I used ricotta cheese instead of cottage.  Only thing is I will make more sauce for it next time.  The sour cream was the "secret ingredient" that makes this dish special.  Very good!

I would like to say I tasted this after I made this but I couldn`t,I`m on W.W.`s and just by the smell I would have eaten the whole thing with all kidding aside.I made this for a Little League function and people raved about this.I did use the ricotta cheese and cut sausage into slices with the casing on and they turned into small balls which were great.Would I make this again,you`re darned right I will and maybe this time I could sneak a taste.And by the way I made this in a roaster and it came out perfect.i also doubled the recipe.

This recipe was excellent.  I spiced it up a little bit by using 15oz/ricotta and 8oz of sour cream instead of cottage cheese.  I added some italian seasoning to the ricotta/sour cream mixture. I also added TONS of fresh garlic to the meat mixture.  I also still used the provolone... YUMMY! the best baked ziti I've ever made!

Excellent! I added extra garlic and used Ricotta instead of cottage cheese as some other reviewers suggested. I mixed the ricotta and sour cream together and added some garlic and herbs to the mixture. My only complaint was the bottom layer of pasta never got any sauce, it was dry. Next time I will start with a layer of sauce on the bottom. Thanks for the great recipe!

This was my first time making baked ziti and it turned out awesome! I took it to a party at work and it was gone fast (I even doubled the recipe!). I didn't have fresh rosemary so I added ground italian spices. I think next time I will add some mozzerella cheese in the layers with the provelone to make it more cheesy. I also used ground italian sausage instead of plain pork sausage. It gave it a nice little kick. I will definitely make this one over and over!! Thanks Seth!

This was, by far, the best baked ziti I have ever made.  Of course I used homemade marinara sauce to make it, so that may have played a part.  But the texture of the ziti was great -- cheesy and gooey all the way through.  And the rosemary really added a great touch.
Thanks for the recipe, it's a definite keeper.

Oh, btw, this makes a LOT.  My husband and I barely made a dent in the pan.  The good news is that I froze the leftovers in individual containers and we have enough for about 5 more dinners!

Oh, and I did use ricotta instead of cottage cheese.

Good, and easy. I think it has enough sauce, but too much meat. Cut down on the meat and try it. Thats what I did. MMMM But I am adding more cheese next time. I like me some cheese!

Another great recipe.  I was so looking for a lasagna type casserole and boy did I find it!  Don't be afraid of the sour cream, it makes the dish.  The only change I did was I mixed the sour cream and cottage cheese together, and I did use 1 cup each.  I also used both jars of sauce becuase of some of the other reviewers saying it was dry.  I didn't add rosemary, I didn't have any.  Other than that I made it as it was written.  Hubby was loving life, he suggested I make this again and again!  Thanks a wonderful comfort food recipe.

Don't skip the sausage, it must give it flavor, for as I only used ground meat.  I didn't have provolone but did everything else excacly.  It is hard to layer sour cream on hot noodles so I mixed the SC and Riccota together then layered the meat and cheese.  It was ok.

I followed the recipe exactly and served this for dinner to 4 children and my husband. Three out of four children did not like it. Myself, my husband and my toddler liked it, but it was way to rich for our blood. I could never eat nor serve this again. Sometimes less is more. Sorry.

This was great!  Instead of cottage cheese, I used ricotta cheese...Which I first mixed with an egg, some basil, and salt and pepper.  Very tasty.

Simply put, this dish is awesome.  I  used turkey italian sausage and substituted the cottage cheese for lowfat ricotta.  My family & guests loved it. This one's a keeper!!

This recipe is the best!  Tastes just like it came from an Italian restaurant, and is just as good when reheated. The only change I made was to use ricotta cheese instead of the cottage cheese. YUM!!!!

My husband LOVED this.  I made a few modifications.  I omitted the ground beef and used just over a pound of hot Italian sausage - we like the spicier flavor.  I also added sliced mushrooms to the sauce.  Also, I subsituted Ricotta for the cottage cheese...and used more mozzarella than called for (I always do!)  This is now our favorite Baked Ziti dish.

My husband is a Baked Ziti freak - and this recipe is by far his favorite...and mine too!  I follow the suggestions of others and add basil, oregano and a little more garlic (you can never have too much garlic!) and also substituted ricotta for cottage cheese as we like that texture better.  Delicious!!!  I make three at a time and freeze two.

This is how baked ziti should taste - I get rave reviews every time I make this!  Do take the time to chop the fresh herbs - it makes all the difference.

My husband loved this.  Because I am watching my calories, I could only have a small serving, but I enjoyed every bite.  I didn't have any ground beef so I used a pound of Owens Italian Sausage.  I also added some extra cheese as the provolone and mozarella cheeses came in packages each 2 oz. larger than the recipe required.  I love cheese so I used the extra cheese from the packages.  The provolone helped make this recipe.  I also added extra fresh grated parmesan on top.  This recipe would work well as a lazagne, substituting lazagne noodles for the ziti.

We couldn't stop eating this!  I used the advice of another reviewer and used half ground turkey and half turkey sausage and it really lightened up the recipe.  I also used the six cheese italian shredded cheese blend (one and a half bags) in place of the mozzarella, provolone and parmesan.  It made for an easy weeknight dish.  I was skeptical of the sour cream and cottage cheese, but you would never know bc it was delicious.

This was a great dinner.  It made so much I had lunch for a week for me and my boyfriend.  I really like the combo of ground beef and sausage, I will use a hotter sausage next time for more kick.

This was good and I will make it again someday, taking in the suggestions of some of the reviewers:  I would mix the sour cream and cottage cheese together and spread them to save time and make it easier to distribute both evenly.  I used Classico's mushroom and olives sauce so it had mushrooms but if the sauce didn't, I would definitely add mushrooms.  I would try ricotta rather than cottage cheese just to see if it would bring it up to a 5-star rather than a 4-star recipe for me.  The fact that I used non-fat mozzarella may have something to do with it too.  I will use regular or low-fat next time.  

Good, hearty dish -- tastes like lasagna but easier to make.  Barely fit in the 9x13 pan!

I have used this recipe several times, and every eater has been very impressed.  It's fast and easy.  I went overboard on the cheese last time though and it came out too greasy, so be careful.  I really like the rosemary.  A hit with all my friends, there is so much I send them home with leftovers!

I WAS A LITTLE SKEPTICAL ON THE SOUR CREAM AND COTTAGE CHEESE PART OF THIS RECIPE UNTIL TASTING THE END RESULTS.  IT WAS EXCELLENT.  MY HUSBAND IS A VERY PICKY EATER AND WON'T EAT ANYTHING WITH SOUR CREAM IN IT.  HE RAVED ABOUT IT AND NEVER QUESTIONED THE INGREDIENTS, MY 5 YEAR OLD SON ALSO LOVED IT.  I WILL DEFINITELY MAKE THIS AGAIN AND AGAIN.

My picky son loved this, so this recipe is a real winner! It tastes like lasagna, but is much easier to make. The rosemary gives it an interesting flavor, but the next time I make it I will add more spices. This recipe makes enough for 2 meals- I'm freezing the leftovers for another day.

i really liked this recipe.  i didn't use the ground beef (cause i don't eat beef) and doubled the pork instead.  i love cottage cheese but could barely detect the presense of it.  this recipe makes a ton!!  i would make this again if someone asked me to make it, but on my own, i could make something that would taste just as good w/o this recipe.

This baked ziti was great!  I used 2 whole jars of sauce and a little more cheese than the recipe called for, but that's just personal preference.  This was just as good reheated...good thing too since it made so much.  Great recipe!

This is wonderful!  My guests raved about it.  I prefer this to lasagne any day. I did, however, use homemade spaghetti sauce rather than the stuff in the jar and substituted ground Italian sausage instead of pork sausage.  This recipe is definitely a keeper!

I liked this dish, but for the amount of meat I thought it had way too much sauce.  I will either add more meat and cheese next time or scale back on the sauce.

I liked it. The only thing I'd change is I'd remove the sour cream. It didn't actually melt and so there were chunks of sour cream (and I HATE sour cream). So it kinda made it gross for me. But I'd make it again without. 

OH! And I pre-made my own sauce. There's NO way I'd use jarred sauce

It was delicious! I used ground turkey and turkey sausage. I mixed sour cream, low fat cottage cheese, parm and mozzarella together for the middle layer. I also placed 7 slices of provolone on top and sprinkled with a little mozzarella. I placed in oven for 20 minutes. Thanks for recipe!

I have made this several times for family, friends and coworkers. Everyone loves it.  I usually use Ragu Sundried Tomato & Sweet Basil.  I mix the cottage cheese and sour cream together with about 1/2 tsp of italian seasoning before layering.

This was great. No one would ever guess that the cottage cheese and sour cream was not ricotta. Only change I made was tossing the meat sauce and pasta together. First time I made it l didn't and not much sauce made it to the bottom layer.

I make this all the time and it's really quite tasty.  I've made it as written and it's good, however over the years I've came up with my own recipe.  First, I use high-protein pasta as not only is it healthier, it holds up better in baked pasta dishes I've found.  I also use an 11x15 casserole dish - this makes a LOT of food.  Third, I use  6 cups of sauce  (I use my own) and use 20oz hot Italian turkey sausage (which I take out of the casings and crumble).  Like others have mentioned, I prefer to mix (1 cup) sour cream and (1 cup) cottage cheese and the mozzarella in a bowl and mix the pasta into the sauce (under cook the pasta by 2 minutes).  

Layer pasta/cheese/pasta and top with grated parm and provolone & bake for 20-30 mins at 350.  A little work but it makes a ton and is quite tasty!

I made it just as written except I combined the sour cream and cottage cheese before layering it on. Delicious.

I have been told by Italian friends that this dish is about as good as it gets.  They were surprised that it had cottage cheese instead of ricotta.  Second time I made it I used one cup of the sour cream instead of 3/4.  This made it more moist.  The sausage is a must for this recipe.  I used mild Italian sausage.  Easy to make.  Don't over bake.

We were all somewhat underwhelmed by it.  I followed the recipe to a "T" aside from replacing ziti with penne (because it is what I had on hand).  Don't get me wrong ... it wasn't horrible or anything ... just didn't live up to my expectations.  Won't make it again.  Kinda blah and boring and I used so much cheese!  Oh well ... on to the next.

...it turned out GREAT!  Prepared as directed, (doubled the recipe) and baked it outdoors in a large Dutch oven. It was a huge hit at the BBQ, and gone in minutes!  We will definitely be doing this one again!

It was delicious!  Italian is the favorite in our home so my modifications were reducing the amount of fresh, chopped Rosemary to half a tsp, adding a TBSP (+-) of Basil, around half a TBSP Oregano and Parsley, all fresh.  Used 28 oz Dei Fratelli sauce with a splash of Cabernet Sauvignon instead of jar spaghetti sauce. Substituted Ricotta instead of cottage cheese and a generous blend of finely grated Mozzarella, Parmesan, Provolone, Fontina, Asiago & Romano versus only 2 TBSP of fresh Parmesan.  And an additional dusting of freshly grated Romano on each layer. It was a hit.

Made this last night.  Very easy recipe and turned out great!  Do not leave out the rosemary!  I made my own basic tomato sauce instead of using jar - will likely make a little more than is called for.  Next time I will mix the sour cream, cottage cheese, and cheeses together.  Overall, everyone loved this!  Will be a go to for us

Great easy recipe.  I did not use any cottage cheese but the dish turned out delicious anyway.  I served this dish  with a light salad and garlic bread.

Would spice this up with a bit of garlic salt, basil, and oregano and leave out the sour cream. That does not belong in an Italian ziti recipe I think. I did not use the sausage either, but doubled the beef.  Still quite tasty! Cooked the pasta a bit less and let it spend 35 minutes in the oven, 25 minutes covered with tin foil. It tastes basically like a meat lasagna...used gluten free noodles for my gluten free friends! Worth a go!

Yum.  I gave this 4 stars because we didn't like it baked like instructed.  I just mixed the ingredients and melted the cheese this way and ate it.  Yum.  Freezes well too.

Tried it out tonight and loved it!! Made a few adjustments like adding about half a cup of cheddar cheese and decided to brown the pork and beef with salt,black pepper and just a teaspoon of Durban oriental masala. But nonetheless, it's a delicious dish

I made this for a church potluck. I used 1 red onion and 1 bell pepper. I also increased the garlic, just a tad more. I used ricotta cheese instead of the sour cream/cottage cheese mix. Instead of riti I used rigatoni because it has ridges. Turned out awesome! I will use this recipe for the next potluck as well. Oh and I used ground pork instead of the sausage because the sausage tends to be a little bit too spicy for some of the more sensitive folks.

I made this for my parents, who don't like spicy foods so I chose a very mild spaghetti sauce. It was still very good. Next time I'll kick it up a notch with a more robust sauce.

Great basic baked ziti recipe to use if you don't have ricotta cheese. (I do prefer ricotta cheese in it) You can substitute many of the ingredients. I used penne instead of ziti pasta, didn't have cottage cheese so I doubled the sour cream and only used ground beef since I didn't have pork. As others recommended, I added some chopped red pepper, a little red wine and some honey to the meat mixture. I only used mozzarella and parmesan cheese since I didn't have the provolone. Baked as stated (spray dish first with pam spray) My husband loved it...and he is a pasta lover. Great recipe!

Very, very good!! I must say I made this several times and it only gets better and better every time. I have made it with both ground, pork, and ground turkey. I am trying to eat healthier so I used, light ricotta, reduced fat provolone, light sour cream, 150 calorie penne, and seasoned ground turkey. My boyfriend who absolutely won't eat anything "healthy" loved it and went back for more. Even with the substitutions it is still a wonferful dish. I am happy to have found such a versatile dish to add to my repertoire. Delishy :)

Now this is a bit of a change but I used cream of mushroom soup in place of tomato sauce...I added just a hint of Worcheshire sauce to the cream of mushroom soup "undiluted" and mixed it with the pasta before layering...just wonderful!

I have made this several times. It's wonderful. Nobody can resist seconds. I make it with a full pound of hot Italian sausage and skip the ground beef, and use a very loose, chunky marinara sauce. Just wonderful.

Yummy!  This was excellent.  The best I ever had.  The only thing I did different was I used the whole carton of cottage cheese, more mozzarella cheese, and more parm cheese on top.  Other than that, I followed the recipe to a T.  Oh and I also used whole wheat pasta because I had some in the pantry.  This was excellent!!!  Yum and thanks much for the recipe!!

Very good!!! My husband loves homemade lasagne and he liked this better! I also add cottage cheese to my lasagne, so this recipe is similar, just easier! Will definitely have this again!!

Huge hit! Original portions yielded 2 helpings each for my boyfriend and I, our lunch the next day AND an entire separate pan for my parents (saved Mom cooking one night). I used 1lb of ground pork and flavored it with Penzey's DELICIOUS Italian Sausage Seasoning. Definitely a fan of the cottage cheese/sour cream mixture and the fresh rosemary. I also chopped 6-8 big leaves of fresh basil and added it to the warm onion mixture (after removing it from the pan), gave it that extra fresh herb flavor. This recipe is much simpler AND tastier than lasagna. It will be our new substitute!

Loved this recipe!  I added ricotta cheese, about a half cup. It was so creamy and delicious.  This is my new go to for baked ziti. I also subbed thyme for rosemary.

Fantastic and reasonably easy recipe.  I'll definitely make this again.  The only thing I would change/add would be to make the top layer a nice full layer of provolone - that's how I'm used to seeing it in NYC.  I used Paul Newman's Sweet Vidalia pasta sauce.  The cooking time says 20-30 minutes and I recommend keeping it in the full 30 min unless your cheese looks like it's overcooking.

Used Ricotta instead of Cottage (I just happened to have it on hand) added 1/3 c. Balsamic Vinegar, garlic and basil to the sauce. Also used Penne instead of Ziti. YUMMY!

My family loved this.  Loved all the garlic.  We've tried a lot of pasta recipes, and this is one of the tops.  I doubled this recipe to talk one to a friend who just lost her Mom.  I did seem to have a lot left over.  I actually made another to freeze with what was left.  I didn't have any sour cream/cottage cheese left, so I just mixed some cottage cheese, the pasta, and sauce together, and stuck it in the freezer.  I can kick it up with mozarella when I bake it.

This is quite good. It's a little awkward trying to layer, but if you aren't a perfectionist, just plopping it on there gets the job done. I didn't find this dry at all, though I do think maybe the soft cheese mixture could stand to be seasoned. Do use both sour cream and cottage cheese as they both add a unique sour tang -- if you're going to switch to ricotta, just make lasagna.

Whole family loved it!  Simplified by mixing together the pasta with meat sauce separate and the last 4 ingredients together separate.  In pan, layered 1/2 pasta mixture then all of cheese mixture then rest of pasta.  Baked then toward the end added Provolone slices on top and baked a little longer.

Very good. I was a little concerned with the sour cream as my hubby can't stand the stuff but it gave it a great texture and added another layer of flavor. I didn't really measure the sour cream, cottage cheese mix. Used penne pasta instead of ziti. Thanks for the recipe!

Very yummy! I did modify it  just a bit.  I thought the measurements were a tad off (3/4 c. of sour cream and cottage cheese each? 6 oz. of provolone and mozzarella each?) For easy measuring sake, I used the entire package of cheeses.  They come in 8 oz. packages, anyway.  And 1 c. is much easier to measure than 3/4 c.  I mean, who doesn't like more cheese? I also used a whole pound of Italian sausage along with the 1/2 lb. of ground beef.  Otherwise, I followed everything the same.  And it turned out fantastic.  Add some salad and garlic bread and you've got a wonderful meal for anytime!

I give this 4.5stars! I listened to the suggestions with regards to cooking time. I baked at 350 for 35min and the 375 for 12 min. I also added oregano and basil to the onion mixture for more flavor. It was a hit! The only thing I might add is a little more sauce because after baking the meat/sauce was very light. All and all great easy recipe for a large group!

Absolutely loved this dish. I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of the rosemary. We aren't big on rosemary. My Mom who is very pick ate two helpings and sang my praises on Facebook about it.

I just made this dish last night and never thought to add sour cream but it turned out quite tasty.  My family ate it and took home leftovers.  Though I did not layer it, I mixed it all in one bowl and added an extra sauce layer on top.

This ziti was so easy and so good. I was somewhat skeptical how it would turn out because of the lack of seasoning other than the rosemary but it was very good. I still may add some basil next time I make it though. It took every bit of my 9" x 13" pyrex dish so I stuck a cookie sheet underneath while it baked just to be sure I didn't make a mess of my oven. I used low fat cottage cheese and low fat sour cream and you couldn't taste the difference at all, which is key to me when using low fat ingredients. Definitely making this one again!

I loved it! It taste very similar to lasagna without all of the hassle of the lasagna noodles. I mixed the sour cream and cheese together in a bowl for easier spread, then added oregano and basil. I used italian sausage instead of ground pork sausage, but next time I am just going to stick with hamburger! My husband love it! I will definately be making this again!

Definitely a family favorite!!!  :o)  I made it the original way the first few times I made it.  This time, however,  I added sliced portabella mushrooms and fresh spinach to the onion mixture.  YUMMY!!

Turned out good even though I didn't have provolone cheese and forgot the Parmesan. Used homemade marinara as I didn't have jarred.

Very good!  Even better the next day.  I used one pound of ground beef instead of the mixture with the sausage, and I think I missed the spice a little.  But it was still delicious.

This was great.  I did what other reviewers suggested, adding the cheeses all together and I accidentally forgot to add the mozzarella to the mixture (but did add it to the top).  Well let me tell you, I think I would make that mistake again!  It made the left overs AMAZING!  It was so creamy and outstanding, even after 2 days.    My husband licked his bowl each time we ate it!!!

I had to make a few simple changes because of what I had on hand. Couldn't find ziti, so used penne. Used an Italian cheese blend because I forgot the provolone. I didn't bother to cook the onion, ect. separately, just tossed the ingredients in when cooking the meat. Lastly I halved the recipe. Very good.

I'm always looking for a baked ziti recipe that is not dry and this fits the bill.  It's very flavorful too.  I did add some Italian seasoning, romano cheese and cut up some red peppers (because I had them in the house) and also used my own sauce.  It was really delicious!

I wanted a baked pasta for dinner and decided to give this a try.  It was my very first time and I did pretty well.  I added some mushrooms because I love them; other than that I followed to the letter and it was excellent.

This has become our family's regular Ziti.  We love it.  We also frequently follow the changes listed by one reviewer where she substituted 3 chicken breasts for the meat, Alfredo sauce for the tomato sauce and added spinach.  I've given away the "white ziti" recipe several times.

I have made this for years and never knew what it was called!  We always called it "mock lasagna."  The only difference is I usually use a mixture of ricotta and cottage cheeses, and I mix all the cheeses except the provolone together with italian seasoning and an egg or two, using the provolone last as in the recipe.  Also I have never used sour cream but I will the next time I make this.  btw, I have found it really does make a difference to not mix the pasta with the sauce when you are layering this.  The sauce will cook the pasta and you end up with soggy pasta when it's done.

How amazing!Now, I didn't have sour cream on hand so I left that out...either way don't leave anything out of this..I did extra garlic and extra fresh Rosemary(2 tbsp chopped- i love)...I sauteed this in with the meats and sauce, simmered(low) for an hour as well. This was the easiest to make andmy husband said it was the best!

This is the BEST pasta dish I have EVER made! I followed it to the tee, except I substituted the 1/2 lb. of sausage for just a full pound of beef instead. It was so delicious. It had just the right amount of cheese and just the right amount of sauce. Perfect!!!! A++

Had to give this one 5 not only because it's good, but because it's easy and even inexpensive. If you want to watch the grease content, just brown the beef a bit longer (gets more grease out) and use reduced fat sour along with the cottage. I did these things plus dashed a bit more rosemary than called for - and just like that you have a great freakin' meal. With my (somewhat) healthier mods, I can't tell the difference between it and the first time I made it with full-fat ingredients.   /cottage cheese is even better than using ricotta or similar textured cheese, in my opinion. In fact, the cottage and sour cream are what "make" this dish!

Hands down, the best Ziti recipe I have ever made or eaten!!  I have been making this recipe for years and kept meaning to add to the reviews.  I use fat free sour cream and fat free ricotta cheese(instead of the cottage cheese).  I have also used my own sauce for this recipe and found it to turn out equally delicious.  The sour cream, ricotta (or cottage) cheese and provolone combination I think is what makes the difference, compared to other recipes.  Definitely a family favorite.

EVERYONE LOVED this!  I had a large group that wiped the pan out!!  I used two full jars of spaghetti sauce as other reviewers mentioned it being dry and I'm glad I did.  I used ricotta instead of cottage and I tossed the cooked noodles in the sour cream to keep them moist.  Also, I made this ahead of time and froze it for the busy day so as to not spend my "fun" day in the kitchen.  In that case, I simply assembled the dish, froze, thawed, and baked as directed just before the meal was to be served. Worked like a charm!

This was pretty good, but I am Italian and I think I will stick with Ricotta cheese next time, Baked Ziti II looks more like my appeal, much more cheese.  Although I do like the meat sauce it made.

The sour cream was a nice touch. I added extra sauce and made sure to layer the sauce next to the ziti, and covered while cooking, but it still turned out a little dry.

Very good.  As others suggested, I think I should have mixed the cheeses with the sour cream/cottage cheese to allow for easier spreading but aside from that, it was excellent.  Oh, and I did need to bake it for 30 full minutes to get the inside hot.  Will definitely be making this again.

I really enjoyed this recipe. I made the sauce from scratch, of course, using "World's best pasta sauce" from the site, and substituted ricotta for the cottage cheese. I also followed another reviewer's suggestion of mixing the cheeses and sour cream, because my ricotta was less than spreadable. The dish came out with a golden brown blanket of provalone and poured out an appetizing aroma. I found the dish paired well with a Heineken to offset the richness of the cheeses, and Sour Cream and Onion Lays on the side really made this dish unforgettable. Don't miss this one if you like Italian!

Finally!  A pasta dish that my whole family will eat, even my picky 4 year old.  The only thing I altered on this was I substituted the rosemary with Italian seasoning.  I made it with the rosemary first and thought it was too overpowering.  This recipe makes a lot!  I'm premaking this and freezing it for when I have company over the holidays.

This recipie was the first that I ever looked up on this site. I heard baked ziti referenced a few times on TV so I though I would try it. WOW. This is a great recipie. Honestly, I have tweaked it every way, and used original and its always good. My Husband always says "this is the best ziti ever." All based on this recipie. Thanks for sharing.

Pretty generic ziti.  I did use ricotta instead of cottage cheese and 16oz of an italian cheese blend in place of the provolone and mozzarella.  I sauteed the onion and garlic with 1/2 a green pepper, then added the meat following by the simmering part with 2 jars of a tomato & basil sauce. I did add some italian seasoning, red pepper and cumin to the simmering mix.  I then beat an egg and added the cheeses & sour cream all together.  Once the meat sauce and pasta was done, I then just mixed it all together and tossed it into a casserole.  I topped the casserole with freshly grated parmesan and baked it as called for in the recipe.  Oh and I used whole wheat rotini.  Definitely comfort food, although I think I like the recipe on this site for Ziti III better.

This was great!  Entire family loved it.  Made it as recipe stated but took the advice of subbing ricotta for the cottage cheese and used only ground beef which I did season a bit.  Served with extra sauce on the side...Rich, creamy and delicious!  ...tasted even better the next day!!

This recipe is so wonderful.  I make it any time I am having a large group of people over and they always ask for the recipe.  I normally stick pretty close to the original recipe.  I use tomato sauce that has olive oil and garlic in it and I think that is when it always comes out tassting the best.

The ziti was OK. Made this for New Year's Eve dinner (my bf and I stayed in this year), and am just now getting around to reviewing it!  Thank goodness I take good notes. : )  The dish was bland. I was expecting more flavor (the ingredients suggested a rich dish).  We didn't taste the fresh rosemary, so I am not sure it was worth the extra $'s, especially since I had dried on hand.  Perhaps a different noodle (i.e mostaccioli) would suit my palate.  The ziti seemed overwhelming (noodle taste overpowered every bite). I also didn't taste the sausage - I could have prepared with all beef and it would have tasted the same (and been cheaper). Left-overs were bland and didn't reheat well (cheese had a wierd consistency), which is too bad since I had oodles of leftovers, even after halving the recipe.  I might try this again, with modifications, but not anytime soon.  Thanks anyways.

This is really good. I keep kosher so the meat and sausage were out. To keep the pasta ratio the same, I used two cups of cottage cheese and one of sour cream. I also recommend adding a quarter cup of red wine, and 1 tsp. each of basil and oregano to the sauce. Put a bit of sauce on bottom before you start layering.

This recipe was absolutely wonderful!
Do not omit the ground pork sausage it really adds a nice taste/flavor. I didn't use rosemary (oregano instead), and I didn't use cottage cheese (I used ricotta). EVERYONE LOVED IT! And I mean EVERYONE. Lol. Great recipe, thank you for posting it.

I have made recipe several times.  It is really good, and creamy.  Like others have said the sour cream seems weird, but don't skip it, it makes it so good!  The thing about this recipe is that you can use lowfat sour cream and motzerella and cut down on a bit of the fat, you can even use turkey burger or drain and rinse you hamburger to cut down on fat that way too.  A great meal!

Thank you, this is very good!  I used radiatore instead of ziti. I also combined the sour cream and ricotta (in place of cottage cheese) in a mixing bowl and tossed this with the noodles before layering in the pan with the tomato-meat sauce and cheeses. It gave it a creamy macaroni and cheese experience in between the layers of tomato sauce.  YUM!

I think this is really good! Kind of expenisive with all the different cheeses, but worth it once in awhile.  I used ricotta instead of cottage cheese.  The sauce you pick will really make a difference too. I will be making again.

Delicious!  We all loved this!  It does have a pretty strong rosemary flavor.  Next time, I will probably reduce rosemary to half and add basil and oregano.  It makes a ton!  I baked all of it and then froze about half of it.

Deliciously rich and one of those meals you make once or twice a year.  I used my own sauce and Shop Rite brand sausage b/c I like it the best.  A real comfort food that is not your traditional baked ziti.  Thanks for sharing!

Brought to a family gathering and it was a hit! I used all of the additional ingredients and substitutes listed by Dec.8,2003 reviewer which included substituting the ricotta for the cottage cheese and adding the basil and oregano. Keep in mind, if you double the recipe from 12 to 24 you need 2 9x13 baking pans!!!! Duh, I followed the instructions to the letter which didn't list more than 1 pan!!!! Also, if you are preparing for a party of 24 guests, ONE pan serving 12 is more than enough!!!!

This is really good.  I made the recipe as directed except I used hot italian sausage because I like the spice.  This makes a lot so I prepared one 8 x 8 pan to eat and the other to freeze for another day.  Also, I layered  it differently, I started with the meat sauce, then 1/2 of the noodles, then I mixed the sour cream and the cottage cheese together and put all of that on top of the noodles, then cheese, then more meat sauce, noodles and top with cheese.  This is comfort food at it's best and worth the extra hour in the gym to wear it off.

People who ate this dish loved it! A favorite I will keep around, especially good if there is not time or inclination for lasagna, but you are craving something cheesy and melty and tomato-y. 
Not good for you health-wise! Very good for you comfort-wise!

I love this! It was the first meal I ever made and it turned out so good.  I took the advice from other people and threw in basil and oregano in the onion mixture.  I loved the smell of Rosemary in the onion mixture so much that I decided to add it to the top of the baked ziti before it went in the oven. SO good!  I also chopped the onions into very little pieces and I couldn't even feel them when I ate it!  This is  a good thing because I hate the taste of onions and so does my sister!  I saw that some users let it bake for 40-45 minutes.  I mistakenly did the same and the top was a little burned--especially the corners. Not charcoal burned or anything like that, just the pasta was a little hard and the top of the baked ziti looked fried.  Still, it was very good. And once we got through that top layer, it tasted like perfection.  It's relatively easy to make.  It only took me a while longer because it was my first time.  Anyway, next time I'll only bake for the 35 minutes.  I modified the recipe to serve 6 and it was still a lot.  I also used all fat-free or skim cheeses/skim milk because I'm on a diet.  It still tasted really good. I doubt you can tell the difference.  Also, for those of you making the first time: use all the cottage/cream/provolone cheeses in your first layer! I made the mistake of assuming it was a "repeat each layer" thing and I didn't realize it until later.  So, I dug up the top layer of the meat sauce and pasta to stuff the leftover cheeses below.  S

This recipe was amazing. Next time I think I'll use more provalone cheese, though. One of my boyfriend's favorite dinners.

This came out really good!  I used 1/2 ground chuck and a 1/2 pound hot italian sausage.  I cooked these together and put the meat in a separate bowl and then cooked the onion and garlic in the skillet with the "drippings" from the meat.  There wasn't much fat at all from the meat but I thought the flavor would help the onions/garlic in olive oil.  I mixed the meat back in and then the sauce and let that simmer while I cooked the pasta.  I did what some other reviewers suggested and mixed the meat sauce in with the pasta.  To help with added flavor, I bought two jars of sauce that were basil and garlic flavored, added a little oregano and parsley and a pinch of salt.  I also mixed the sour cream and cottage chese together and layered the dish as stated otherwise.  Turned out really great though and lots of flavor!

AWESOME!  I made things a little easier to assemble, I just mixed it all together and poured half into a 9 x13 dish, then I layered on the provolone, then poured in the rest of the mixture, LOVED IT!

This is by far the best Baked Ziti I have ever eaten.  If you are looking for a really good recipe for Baked Ziti you just found it so stop looking!  Anytime I make this for a dinner party people are getting seconds and even triple helpings.  I never have any leftover.  It is the best and if I could give it a million stars I would! :)

One of my favs! Absolutely delicious and easy to make. I substitute the sour cream and cottage cheese for ricotta (about 2 c). Makes a huge difference! I also use the entire 2 jars of spaghetti sauce so it doesn't get dry. I followed the suggestion of others: mix the sauce and pasta and put half of it in a dish. throw on the cheeses and then layer the rest of the pasta mixture topped off with the rest of the cheese. I also add more mozzerella. Makes quite a bit but we don't mind the leftovers!

I didn't think you could make good ziti from jarred sauce, but this recipe is excellent.  My (italian) best friend requests this all the time.  His mother even asked for the recipe, but I don't want to give away my ragu secret!! LOL
Quick and Easy.

YUM! I had a last minute dinner party last night and needed something quick. Although my husband was less than excited for me to cook baked ziti, he became a quick convert when he took his first bite. I cooked the recipe as is, with the cottage and sour cream. Husband had three servings! Everyone LOVED it. My 8 year old who doesn't eat "sauce" even asked for her own bowl. I served the ziti with warm sourdough bread, a zesty Italian salad, and homemade ice cream sundays, with the whip, fudge, cherries and all. A few bottles of red wine and we had one happy dinner party. I used all organic ingredients down to the sundays and it was all decadent. Thanks for a great baked ziti recipe. It will now move into our family favorite binder. HOMECHEF4

Spectacular! The only thing I did differently was that I used cellentani noodles instead of ziti and I used ground turkey instead of the beef & sausage. I also used a little more mozzarella because we like things CHEESY at our house! It was soooo yummy! I'm making it again for company tonight!

This recipe was OUTSTANDING!  I will definitely make it again.  I took someone else's advice to add red wine... GREAT IDEA... it makes a difference!
The only problem is I used a garlic and onion tomato sauce and still added the regular garlic and onions... it was a little much, but was still good.  I'd recommend getting original tomato sauce as there are other ingredients that spice it up!

I made this last night for dinner and it was wonderful. I modified a couple of things. I cooked 12oz. of sliced mushrooms with the onions (I can't do an Italian dish like this without mushrooms!). I also used ricotta in place of cottage cheese. I didn't have any sausage, but it was excellent with just ground sirloin. I mixed the mozzarella, ricotta and sour cream together in a bowl, added a little Italian seasoning and tossed it all with the baked pasta. I layered the pasta mixture, 6 slices of Provolone, meat: repeat. Topped with the grated Parm. My kids loved it too.

Very good!  I left out the sausage and just used ground beef, and I also did not use cottage cheese.  The ziti was still excellent, and without a doubt, you HAVE to use rosemary!!!!

Very good recipe.  I made it last night and got some great responses.  I did add an egg to the cottage cheese/sour cream mixture, and added a little grated parmesan. I also used all ground beef, no sausage.  Next time I'll use a little more sauce.  But other than that, it was good, and pretty easy - I'll definitely make it again.

I would have given this 10 stars if I could!  I only made some minor modifications. I used all sausage just because we like it so much.  We're not fans of rosemary so I replaced it with 1 tablespoon of fresh chopped basil.  I did use ricotta because it just goes so well in italian dishes and I mixed the ricotta, sour cream, parmesan & shredded mozerella together and layered that with the noodles, sauce and then provolone.  I will make this again and again for years to come.  THANK YOU!

This is a stand by recipe in our house.  Easy to make.  Yummy and great for left overs.  I even make it with nonfat cottage cheese, sourcream and light provolone and mozzarella and turkey sausage and it tastes just as great as with the original ingreds.

This was soooo good!  If you like lasagna, you'll love this.  It's easier to make and more creamy (thanks to the cheeses).  The only things we did differently are that we just used ground turkey instead of sausage & ground beef, and we didn't have any plain fresh rosemary so we used dried italian seasoning with rosemary in it.  This will definitely be put in our rotation!

Pretty good but didn't knock my socks off.  I too used ricotta instead of cottage cheese.  Makes good leftovers and I think it's even better the next day.

This recipe was so easy and amazing! Made it for a Sopranos party and everyone loved (and devoured) it. So cheesy and delicious. I took some other people's suggestions and used ricotta cheese instead of cottage cheese, other than that followed the recipe step by step. Very good leftovers as well!

I made it exactly like the recipe said to and it turned out very good.  Next time I will try it with ricotta to compare.**** I just made it a second time and replaced the cottage cheese with ricotta....YUMMY.  I also used fat free sour cream and part skim mozerella.

Very good!!!  I exchanged the cottage cheese for ricotta but stuck with everything else.  It was a huge hit at the house with my husband and kids.  I even had quite a bit left over and brought it into work.  Everyone loved it!!

I made this for a potluck and it was a huge hit! The changes I made to the recipe were that I mixed the bottom layer of noodles with a lot of sauce so that it wouldn't be dry (I ended up using 2 jars of sauce as well). I cut out the meat, and that wasn't problem at all. Don't skip the rosemary, though - it makes it taste so good! Yum, this was a great recipe, thanks!

I used 1.5 lbs of ground italian sausage (it was easier than using 1/2 a package of each).  I also didn't have rosemary so I used the same amount of an italian seasoning blend.
This truely is the BEST!  I've had this recipe sitting in my book for a long time and finally made it.  It was awesome!  
I'd give this more stars if I could!

This is so good and easy.  I did as others suggested and added the 2 whole jars of spagetti sauce and it made it very saucy and all the sauce seemed to take away from all the different cheese flavors. Also don't cut back on the cheese that is what makes it so great.  Next time I will follow the recipe exactly.  Will definitely make again!

Made this for the first time tonight and it was good but a little on the dry side quite honestly.  I followed the recipe to the letter.  The basic taste is good but I think I would add more sauce the next time.  The 1/2 jar leftover from the recipe, I heated and offered to my dinner guests to spoon over their helping of ziti.  The slight dryness is my only complaint.  I can only give this a 3.  Sorry.

My husband said this was one of my best meals ever - thanks for a great recipe, Seth!  I made a few minor health-wise modifications:  used non-fat cottage cheese, light sour cream, whole wheat penne, and dried rosemary (because I forgot to pick up the fresh stuff).  this is some great ziti!!!

This recipe turned out nice.  I doubled the recipe and it made a ton!  I made two huge cassaroles, plus had a enough for a small loaf pan!  To cut down on the fat in this recipe, I used a mixture of lite ricotta and cottage cheese and added an egg (like my lasagne recipe) and some italian seasonings.  I diced up 4 chicken breasts and sauteed it in about 1/2 cup of white wine.  I added a couple glugs of balsamic dressing, then added the spaghetti sauce to my chicken.  I also used reduced fat sour cream.  The chicken was so good in this recipe and not as heavy and greasy as the sausage and beef would have been.  This is a great recipe you can make ahead of time and just freeze it.  It freezes and reheats really well.  I like to make this cassarole in a disposable aluminum cassarole pan, that way I can freeze it, thaw it and just stick it in the oven with out tying up one of my good cassarole dishes.

i used italian sausage and ricotta cheese like everyone recommended, but i thought the italian sausage was too overpowering.  however, this was my first time making baked ziti.  i think if i make it a few more times, it will turn out better.  =)

Great recipe Seth! A real hit in my family. My Wife and son really perk up at dinner time when I make this.
I added a few ingredients just because that is the way I am. I can't make a bowl of cereal the same way twice!
Rather than 1 1/2 jars of spagetti sauce sauce, I used 2 jars. Also I added a good sized bell pepper chopped and a 10 oz can of Diced Tomatoes & Green Chilies.
On step 3 of the recipe, I simmered the mixture on low covered for about 1  1/4 hours then uncovered for 45 minutes to allow the mixture to cook down a bit, stirring regularly.
My baking dish is certainly full!
 I followed all else. 
Thank you for this recipe Seth, it's Great!!!

The taste is wonderful.  Next go around I will add more sauce.  It was a little dry.  I used ricotta cheese instead of cottage cheese because I hate it so much.  I also doubled the recipe for a dinner party and everyone loved it.  Will make again but add more sauce.  Thanks!

Wonderful! I made this recipe for my church's potluck supper. It made a huge amount; filled to the brim my big Princess House lasagna pan, which is 16x12 and 3 1/2" deep! I took home an empty pan, and had several requests for the recipe. The only thing I changed was: I added bell pepper with the onion, and I added an extra layer of provolone, along with the mozzarella. Seth, thanks for a great recipe!

This was very good! My husband loved it. My picky 5 year old even liked it. The sour cream and cottage cheese tasted so good! I used penne pasta instead of ziti and next time I think I'll use a full pound of sausage and no ground meat. This one's a keeper!

My husband was out of town the night I served it to my kids (who loved it). I gave it to him the next day for lunch. He emailed me during the day and wrote in all caps "EXCELLENT LASAGNA". BTW, my husband is NOT a pasta fan. Very tasty meat sauce.

This was really yummy!  We did make a few changes - I used rigatoni instead of ziti because thats what I had on hand.  I also substituted fresh basil instead of rosemary and increased it alot more then a teaspoon.  I also added some oregano and mrs dash garlic blend.  I increased the garlic to six cloves as well.  Turned out yummy and will make again!  Thanks Seth!

I loved this recipe!!!  I did not add the meat, but everything else the same!  Was a huge hit!  I loved the sour cream and cottage cheese instead of ricotta!  I used Barilla Campagnole Roasted Garlic and Olive oil.  Thank you so much!

Very good flavor but didn't seem to be enough sauce to cover all the ziti.  I think mixing the ziti with the sauce first, then layer with cheeses would be better.

HAVE NEVER REVIEW A RECEIPE BEFORE, BUT AFTERING TRYING THIS DISH HAD TO TELL EVERYONE HOW GREAT IT IS. HUSBAND LOVED IT!!  MADE IS JUST LIKE THE RECEIPE EXCEPT I DID NOT BOTHER TO TRY AND LAYER IT.  MIXED ALL TOGETHER EXCEPT FOR THE PROVOLONE CHEESE.  PUT HALF OF THE MIXTURE, THEN PROVOLONE AND REMAINING MIXTURE.  I WILL CERTAINLY MAKE THIS AGAIN.  GOOD ENOUGH FOR COMPANY.

Great recipe!  I have to cook a meal for 40-50 people every week and so am always looking for something easy, tasty,cheap and able to feed a crowd.  One of the great things about this site is the "calculator" for scaling recipes up. This fed my crowd well and there were no leftovers!  I added just about another jar of sauce and more of both the mozzerella and parmesan,(personal preference).  It was a hit. Thanks!

My husband and kids inhaled this one! My husband said it was a "10 star recipe" and he doesn't say that very often!  Also, it was quick and easy to make and can be made ahead.  Will definitely make this one again and again!!

Absolutely delicious!  My friends enjoyed it so much they asked for more!  If adding mushrooms, cook it a little before adding to the spaghetti sauce b/c fresh mushrooms let a lot of juice go, which can sometimes alter the taste of the whole dish (in my opinion and experience anyway).  I did use ricotta cheese instead of cottage per previous reviews.  Tastes great with Texas Toast!  Thanks so much for sharing!  I'm a big pasta fan and this is near the top of the list along with lasagna!

This turned out to be phenomenal! I added slices mushrooms and a little Cabernet to the sauce. It was p;erfect! I also used ricotta instead of cottage cheese. I omitted the rosemary, Im not a huge fan of rosemary. Try using garlic salt to taste instead of just salt. Very good recipe!! One of my best meals ever!

This was an extremely tasty ziti dish.  However, I altered the recipe a bit.  I used ricotta instead of cottage cheese and 2 different types of sauce (burgandy marianara and tomato and basil).  With each bite, I tasted a hint of rosemary, and being Italian, I was not used to that.  Therefore, I'm going to try a few of the other ziti recipes on here and compare, but this was excellent!

This is slowly becoming a dish I am famous for! I use Ricotta in place of the cottage cheese, but I think that is just a matter of taste. Also, as a matter of taste I have been asked to make it without the sour cream and it is just as good.  I usually serve it up with homeade bread and a salad...perfect for a large crowd.

My husband devoured this! I used a larger noodle (rigatoni), so I had a hard time fitting it all into the baking dish. I used ricotta instead of cottage cheese and used light sour cream. Would probably benefit from some fresh basil. Will definitely make again.

The Best! I have made this a couple of times and packaged it up and froze it for later meals. The first I made it, I packaged it for 2 because I didn't think my son would like it (he is 2.5 and has never liked anything with tomato in it). He ate my whole serving (every time I baked it). We made it again last night and my daughter ate it for the first time (she is 1). It is a family favorite. Thanks so much for this recipe.

This was good, but we didn't see much of a difference from lasagna.  A little easier perhaps.
UPDATE:  I thought it was VERY good the next day.  The flavors seemed to meld better.

I adore this and make it for family gatherings. I make it  vegetarian by leaving the meat out - for me - and use spiced italian sausage for everyone else. This is one of my favorites!

Great recipe and hubby asked for it to become a regular, and a lot easier than lasagna. Made enough for dinner for 5 (and three very hungry teenagers) with leftovers.  I used 1.5 pounds of hot italian sausage (steamed then fried, cooled and sliced very thin) rather than the ground beef.  Did not have cottage cheese, so mixed mozza with the sour cream, and put more mozza on top.

I halved this recipe with great results.  I didn't cover the dish, but i did ensure that the top layer of noodles were completely smothered in sauce so the noodles wouldn't dry out.  Because we do not eat pork products and i substituted the sausage with cracker barrel beef sausage, the kind you see at the holidays with cheese and crackers.  I sliced off 1/4 pound and ground it in the food processor then fried per recipe instructions. No leftovers, delicious.

Delicious!  The three of us (myself, my husband and our friend) finished half the 9x13 pan.  (Kind of embarassing.)  It's a good thing a travelling salesman interrupted dinner, we may have eaten it all!  I will absolutely make this over and over again.  I like it much better than my lasagne recipe.  MMMM!

Excellent.  Easy.  One modification - I used Italian flavored ground turkey (Turkey Store brand) No one can tell the difference and it cuts down on saturated fat.  Leftovers taste great the next day too.

This recipe was absolutely wonderful!  It was also a big hit with the kids including my 3 year old!  I added a thin layer of mozzarela in the first layer since cheese is everything to our family.  Couldn't stop eating it.

Let me add my voice to the chorus-- THIS WAS GREAT! I loved the idea of doctoring up jarred sauce, rather than making my own on a weeknight, and I added a little sugar to the sauce as well. (We tend to like sweet things here.) I didn't have sausage around, and used only ground beef instead...it certainly didn't seem to detract one bit. I will definitely make this one again. Too bad I couldn't give it 6 stars.

Don't leave out the fresh rosemary! Makes this that much more special. My stepson had 4 servings at dinner then took all the leftovers home.  
Wonderful recipe and great for company since it can be prepared a day ahead, then just popped into the oven.

This was awesome! It made a lot of leftovers for my husband and my brother in law came over  (and he hates pasta) and he was drooling over it. The sour cream added a nice flavour. I used Classico Red wine and fine herbs sauce, added mushrooms, and used rigatoni. I will definitely make this again. I also used the pre-shredded italian cheeses mix from Kraft. Can't wait to eat the leftovers!
Thanks!
A.

This ziti is incredible! I substituted ricotta for the cottage cheese and Lappi Fontina for the provelone - I also used my own recipe for spaghetti sauce. My family is Italian and loved it! It is now a "basic" at our table.

This is very, very delicious.  I was hesitant with the sour cream and cottage cheese (my family hates those things), but I didn't tell them what was in it and everyone loved it.  Be sure to use lots of FRESH rosemary - what a great flavor.

This was wonderful!  I made it last night to serve at our weekly Soprano's party - it was perfect!  I'll bet at least as good as Carmella's Ziti!!  Made a lot - with tossed salad and crusty Italian bread - we were all pleasantly stuffed!  A real keeper!

This is a great recipe, but I used 2 full jars
of Classico sauce (one portobello and one sun-dried tomato)which I ran through the blender to hide the chunks from a picky eater. I also used l/2 lb. ground beef and l/2 lb. Italian sausage,
removed from the skin. It was not too much sauce and my guests quickly accepted the offer to let them take the left-overs.

This was awesome!  I used lean ground beef, turkey italian sausage, fat-free riccotta cheese (instead of cottage cheese) and light sour cream and it came out great.  I made this for a cooking club I'm in and everyone is asking me to make it again soon.  I have picky toddlers, and they won't eat it (or anything else that doesn't look like chicken nuggets), but older children seem to like it.  thanks Seth!!

I thought it would be too much food for just the two of us...until my husband asked for thirds! We absolutely loved this dish.  I used ricotta instead of cottage cheese, and added extra garlic and parmesan.

I made this last night for my family.  They actually ate something new.  I used 1 pound of hamburger and left out the pork sausage( just in case my family wouldn't eat it.) I used the ricotta cheese, instead of cottage (because I bought the wrong thing) and served it with a salad and garlic cheese biscuits, and they ate seconds.  Thank you.  It was wonderful.

This was fantastic!  I found it very easy to prepare, and was thrilled with the results.  I also used ricotta, rather than cottage cheese and we all just loved it.  This will be one recipe that I will make over and over again.

I had my doubt's about this one because of the bought sauce. I used the Bertolli Marinara with wine and it turned out absolutly fantastic! I will definetly use it again and pass it on to friends. Thank You, Donak

Fantastic! I made this exactly as written (well except I didn't measure the cheese I topped it with at the end - just covered the top w/ the shredded cheeses). I made 2 of them, actually - 1 to freeze & 1 to cook the next day :) LOVE

Followed the recipe but added a covering for the first 25 minutes and then took it off for the last 5 minutes.  Thought it could have cooked a little longer but it may have been my oven.

I used 1 pound ground beef and 1/2 pound ground pork. This produced a moist meatloaf (but a little more fat to skim off). I substituted 1 cup of Italian seasoned bread crumbs for the bread slices and used sea salt. The two teaspoons of salt specified in the recipe made the meatloaf way too salty. I'll use one teaspoon next time. Overall, it was moist and nicely seasoned. Wrong recipe. Sorry!

Staple recipe. Can vary it easily with what you have in hand. Love the cottage cheese - not as heavy as ricotta. Have made it several times.

I cut the receipt in half to serve 6. Turned out pretty good except that the cooking time needs to be longer. 30 minutes was not enough time for the flavors to meld. It was better the next day when I heated up the leftovers. I would not use cottage cheese again. Think that ricotta will be better.

This turned out wonderfully. The sour cream had me nervous but it worked. The only change I made was to use ricotta cheese because that’s what I had.

Excellent recipe.  All the taste of lasagna but with less work.  I took this dish to a party and everyone raved.  I followed the recipe exactly except, since I was pressed for time, I left out the onion and used a chunky pasta sauce.  Will definitely make again.

SERVED AT MY DINNER PARTY OF 6 ADULTS , ONE CHILD AND "ZERO" WAS LEFT IN THE PAN.  And a side note, one couple was delayed 30 min so we covered and held oven at 170 degrees, no one knew the difference. Will make again!

This recipe was really good but I would make one change next time... the rosemary was overwhelming. I may omit it all together or at least cut it down.

Made this for our ladies' game night. It was a huge hit. The only thing I changed was to use ricotta instead of the cottage cheese & to add a tsp of fresh ground oregano from my garden. It was very easy & was my first attempt at baked ziti. I prepared the meat sauce mixture the night before & heated again before adding to the dish.

We loved it! I did use Italian sausage as I misread the ingredient list and that's what I bought. Loved the fresh rosemary in it, just enough to taste it but not overpower dish. The instructions didn't state to drain meat after it's been cooked, but likely because it's a no-brainer. Liked this better than the other versions I've tried. I did end up using two jars of sauce.

I followed the recipe exactly without changes, and it's good but not a 5 star recipe for me. I would recommend changing pork sausage for Italian sausage and swap the cottage cheese for ricotta cheese. I understand the jarred sauce helps speed up the process, but the sauce is an area where some of the flavor comes from.

I've been making this ziti for a few years now and it's become a family favorite.  I substituted Ricotta for the cottage cheese and used my homemade sauce. I also add more fresh herbs to the meat while cooking, just a personal preference. The texture is very creamy with the sour cream. This is another winner!

This is so delicious. My friends request it regularly. I love that it freezes well and we can always just pop a square in the oven or microwave whenever we want it. The only things that I do differently is use smoked provolone versus the regular and add some italian spices to the cream mixture.  We also do not eat beef so I use ground turkey as well as ground turkey sausage.

Wonderful core recipe! I mixed the sour cream and cottage cheese and added some pepper to the mixture. I also used brown rice/quinoa ziti pasta I found at my local supermarket. A bit healthier alternative without sacrificing  flavor! Also, we had some fresh smoked sausage on hand, sliced it up, browned in a pan, and it was AMAZING! I'm sure it is also fabulous with the recommended recipe protein. Sweet and smoky ziti was the best comfort combo we could have asked for. We can't wait to make at our next gathering! Yummy! Thank you for sharing ??

This one is good stuff!  Classical home baked comfort food.  I didn't have any sausage, so we just used ground beef, and I used 2 lbs, cuz that's how I like my sauce.  I used 2 full jars of sauce, since there was extra meat.  The rest of the recipe I followed to a tee.  
Very few things I make in this house of 7 please all of us.  This one DID!!

Yes,yes,yes! I will make this again and again.  I did not add salt and this came out plenty salty. Maybe because I added some pepperoni rounds (quartered) and the cheeses. Only used sausage (a pound), and eyeballed  everything else. Used Italian cheese blend and the provolone, and a pretty good dose of parm on top.  Used one quart of sauce and 1/3  C pasta water.  Added onion, garlic, and mushrooms; all fresh and put in w/ the sausage to cook.  Hubs didn't say a word while eating, then asked for seconds!  Makes alot, which we like, so we have leftovers, and some to freeze for down the road. Thanks for the great recipe!!!

Was a little wary about cottage cheese/sour cream provalone combo, but wow! Really good. Took advice of previous reviews and mixed sour cream, cottage cheese in a bowl beforehand to make an easy spread. Also added garlic powder, oregano to mix. Threw in some fresh basil on second layer, then some more to garnish. Looking forward to leftovers as I hear it gets better w age..

Delicious, and a piece of cake to assemble. I'm a sucker for baked pasta dishes, so I was delighted with the way it came out, but more demanding palates may want a touch more seasoning.

Made last night and had to  omit the cottage cheese and sour cream as I was out, used ricotta instead and it was great!  I did add extra garlic and a dash of Italian seasonings to the meat.  The best part was adding fresh Basil from my garden after it was cooked, that totally kicked it up a notch.  My family loves this dish.  *** I never use store bought pork or beef grounded meats, always organic, venison.***

Sautéed onion, garlic, ground meat/pork, season liberally w/Italian seasoning, onion powder, S and P.  Add red sauce.  Reserve the remaining half jar or red sauce for later.  Add cooked pasta and sour cream/cheese mixture.  For sour cream mix, combine the shredded cheeses (reserve a little for later), sour cream and low fat ricotta (instead of cottage cheese).  IMPORTANT: Only need about 1/4 of the amount of sour cream mixture called for or will be wayyyyy too rich.  Add all to greased pan.  Use any combo of cheeses.  Top with reserve sauce and additional shredded cheese.  Can add a layer of sliced meatballs in the middle of the pasta if desired.

Loved this ziti. Made a few changes to fit our diet. Didn't add any meat, used wheat ziti and jar pasta sauce. Doubled the cottage cheese and sour cream and layered sauce, ziti, cheese mixture. Baked for an hour with foil over it. Came out awesome. Thank you for the recipe

I couldn't make it as listed as I could not get past the cottage cheese and sour cream mixture.  Instead I took the advice of another reviewer and used 8 oz. of sour cream and 15 oz. of ricotta. I stirred in some basil into the mixture as well. While it was an incredible success with my boyfriend, I could still pick up on the twang from the sour cream and think next time I will use ricotta exclusively. Otherwise, this was excellent and EASY and I will be making again!

This dish was delicious! Followed the receipt pretty much. Did substitute the cottage cheese with Ricotta and used a little more spaghetti sauce than called for. I used two full jars. It made a lot. Will have leftovers for a few days!
Very filling!!

It's not amazing on flavor. I would make it again for a large crowd.  I even used rosemary and garlic from my own garden.  This is a good recipe for kids.

I quadrupled the recipe for a function and refrigerated it overnight which made heating it up a bit of a chore because of the size..... but it was a huge hit! I used a mix of homemade and jar sauce for ease. I think the layering was most likely unnecessary though so next time I may just top all the goop on in one layer and see what happens. Rosemary was a surprise flavor booster but i didnt add as much because I had to please so many palates,I was scared it would offend.Truly a keeper!!!!

This was amazing!  I gave it 4 stars, b/c I did alter the recipe as follows:
1. Made my own tomato sauce w/ what I had on hand - a 28 oz can crushed tomatoes, 2t onion powder, 1 1/4t garlic powder, 1t sugar, 2t fresh basil, 1/2t dried oregano, 1t fresh rosemary, 1t salt, pepper to taste.
2. Cut back on the cheeses and sour cream - 1/2C each of sour cream and cottage cheese (blended these together before putting on first layer of noodles), omitted provolone, divided 8 oz mozzarella between the two layers, topped with recommended amount of parm.
The rosemary really shines in this dish, and the flavors are wonderful!
Thanks for a great dinner!

This was really good. Like lasagna with a pleasant twist. And easier since you don't have to fiddle with lasagna noodles. I did use a bit more mozzarella than called for, but when it was done I think that was unnecessary. Whole family enjoyed it. Thanks!

I love this recipe!  My kids call it lasagna and I make it more often since it's less time consuming.  I followed some other suggestions and mix the sour cream, cottage cheese and  parmesan together.  I've also used cream cheese when I was out of sour cream (DELICIOUS).  I serve it with homemade french bread and it is gobbled up!

I made this tonight for my family and me, and it was very delicious. Unlike other Ziti recipes on this site, this one includes pork AS WELL AS beef, and also includes cottage cheese. It was very delicious, and worth the prep time. Also, it yields a very large amount, so very practical for entertaining guests, etc.

Enjoyed this a lot.  Only thing I changed was to substitute turkey for beef because the wife can't eat beef.  Will use this again!

This is great! I used homemade spaghetti sauce and gluten free penne, since my dad has celiac. We all really enjoyed it and I'll definitely make it again. Thank you!

I've never like baked ziti before, until now! This recipe is ridiculously perfect! I had all the ingredients except ground beef (I used ground turkey) and I used ricotta. It was awesome.

Vegetarian so meat was omitted. Used one 28 oz and one 26 oz jar with 1/2 cup of wine and seasonings added. Can't imagine using less, was perfect amount. 

Used cottage cheese in the past and was great but needed to use up cream cheese so used 1/2 cup with 1 cup of sour cream. Boyfriend who HATES sour cream loved this.

Used 8 oz of provolone and mozzarella as packaged and again, perfect amount. Not too cheesy.

Baked covered 20 mins, then uncovered 10. Perfect- Will try fresh rosemary next time! thank you.

10 Stars!!!! This was so good.   I think the sour cream really kicked this recipe off.  I used ricotta cheese instead of cottage.  Also added some extra garlic & Worcestershire. This is a keeper.

My family LOVES this - Here are my changes - I use Ricotta in place of the cottage cheese and I use Rigatoni in place of the Ziti pasta. I also use Italian sausage in place of the ground pork sausage. I've also used ground turkey and turkey italian sausage and it was still YUMMY!  Also, just as noted by previous reviewer, most of these cheeses are commonly sold in 8oz. pkg.'s so go ahead & use all the cheese in the pkg., you won't be sorry!!
I always double this and freeze one because it's that good.   Just allow extra cooking time if you cook from frozen state.   Probably takes a good hour from frozen.   I try to pull it from the freezer the night before and let it thaw in the fridge the day I'm going to cook it.

Fab recipe, SETHALLEN! I have historically made notoriously dry ziti and had all but given up till trying this recipe. I was in a hurry, so I skipped the step where you fry the garlic and onion. The only other change I made was skipping burger and just frying hot italian sausage. I did cut the amounts in half and let me tell you, this makes a colossal amount so bear that in mind.

We really enjoyed this.  I ended up using two bottles of high quality (Barilla) spaghetti sauce and adding a little water otherwise it would have been too dry.  I also put it in a 10x15 pan.  I don't know how it would ever fit in a 9x13.  Yummy, definitely a keeper.

I made two 9x13 pans for my son's 18th birthday party. I barely got to try it - there was only one serving left when they were done. It was a hit!! Thanks Seth!!  I used the "best marinara sauce yet" recipe from this site. What a great combo.

This recipe is absolutely delicious.  The only thing I did different is I used my own homemade spaghetti sauce.   I got a "good" from my husband who rates anyone's cooking as: it's OK (don't make it again), it's fine (it's good), it's good (it's great).  I made it for my whole family and everyone loved it.  It's a keeper!!!!

The husband loved this, loved all the cheese!  I used half ground beef w/half italian flavored ground turkey.  Definitely add meat mixture to pasta & place 1/2 in bottom of pan.  Top with provolone cheese.  Then in small bowl mix sour cream, cottage (or ricotta) cheese & parmesan.  Layer over provolone.  Add remaining meat mixture & top with parmesan followed by mozzarella.  Watch so cheese doesn't over cook, cover at beginning if needed.

This was absolutely fabulous! The rosemary MADE the sauce. I substituted Sweet Italian Sausage instead of the pork sausage and I used additional cheese wherever it was called for. My family LOVED this!

I made a few adaptations to this recipe to fit what i had in the fridge.  I used ground turkey, because it's what i had, instead of the italian sausage and beef.  i also used ricotta instead of cottage cheese.  this was truly good.  my fiance loved it too.  it's a keeper in my recipe book.

Basically tastes like lasagna, altho creamier w/the sour cream. I doubled the ground beef because I don't like pork sausage in Italian dishes(I know, I know). I mixed the meat sauce w/the pasta & mixed the cottage cheese, sour cream, & mozz together. Layered:noodles w/sauce, cottage cheese mix, provolone, noodle mix, parm & provolone.

LOVE this recipe. It will be a regular for sure. So moist and delicious. The flavors are fabulous. My only thing was that I very slightly reduced the amount of rosemary that I put in it because it was very very fragrant, and I'm glad I did, because it was just right.

Used ricotta instead of cottage cheese.  Omitted the rosemary.  Made sure the meat sauce simmered for 90 min. before assembling.  Very creamy and moist.  Good flavor.  Much "heavier" that just plain ziti.

I use this recipe everytime. Only suggestions, use 1lb ground italian sausage instead of pork & beef. I also use an italian blend cheese instead of provolone and mozerella. Much better flavor! You will love it!

I like to add more spaghetti sauce than the recipe calls for. If you're a garlic lover like myself... Prego roasted garlic & herb ....

Excellent!  Used rigatoni because I can never find ziti.  Used fat free sour cream and low fat cottage cheese.  Didn't have fresh rosemary so I used 1/2 tsp of dry rosemary.  Had to use all hamburger as no sausage in the house, but will try the 1/2 hamburger 1/2 sausage combo next time.  I also used shredded "pizza" cheese (mozz, provo, etc) just because it's what I had in the fridge.  This was a great recipe - the rosemary added a nice flavor!  Husband LOVED it!

Delicious! So I don't think I could name off all the things I changed or, rather, didn't follow in this recipe...but that's the beauty of it! I used ricotta instead of cottage cheese and I completely forgot to add my italian sausage. I also used the sauce recipe from Linda's Lasagna (on this site) and with all those hiccups this was still amazing...and slightly easier to put together than lasagna.

I made the full recipe and assembled as a previous reviewer recommended (pasta/sauce, sour cream/cottage cheese/mozz, pasta/sauce, extra cheese) in two smaller casserole dishes, froze one and baked the other.  Great tasting and easy to make.  I did use 1 lb ground beef and all 12 oz mozzarella (it's what was in the fridge), but next time I will definitely use the sausage to spice things up.

I thought this was wonderful.  The only reason it's getting 4 stars instead of 5 is because I made some changes to suit my own family. I used 1 pound of ground turkey instead of the beef/sausage (I always do this to reduce our red meat intake...and so far no one in my family has been able to tell it's turkey we're eating instead of beef).  I added beef bouillon to the turkey as it was browning. I used 1 jar of spaghetti sauce and thought that it was just the right amount. I skipped the mozzarella and the Parmesan.  The last change I made wouldn't affect the taste at all...as I just used a large glass baking bowl instead of the 9X13 pan.  I covered the bottom with noodles, added enough sauce to cover the noodles, covered that with enough of the sour cream/cottage cheese mixture, layered the sliced provolone cheese on top of that, and repeated the layers until I got to the top of the bowl.

i also used ricotta cheese instead of cottage. this was very good but needed more seasoning. next time i'll use an italian sausage, something with a little more kick to it. i'll also try to use fresh rosemary and add basil.

I used ricotta instead of cottage cheese like suggested.  This was very good, but I will use more of the provolone and more spaghetti sauce next time.  Very good!

I run a quick service restaurant and whever I make this dish, it almost always sells out.  My customers will question when I will make this again, because they love it.  So do it!  I follow recipe as is.  It is a great blend of flavor and texture.

I made this on Christmas Eve.  It was excellent!  I took the advice of one reviewer who added red wine to the speg. sauce.  Great idea!  It added a unique flavor. I only added a little bit.  Everyone was very impressed!  You will not be disappointed with this recipe.

Easy - nice recipe - wouldn't use cottage cheese again though (like ricotta much better).  Agreed with one review - combine the cheeses, and combine the pasta with sauce (easier to make this way).

I make this about 5-10 times a year.  Everyone is always amazed when I tell them what is in it (sour cream, cottage cheese).  Only thing that I do is cut back on the garlic.  Maybe 1 clove is sufficient for me.  It's typically made for large gatherings, so not everyone wants garlic breath.

By far the best Baked Ziti recipe I have found and will continue to use it! Made it last night for the 2nd time to rave reviews, even my pickiest friends enjoyed it. And as other reviewers have pointed out do not eliminate the rosemary or sour cream, they add depth to the final product. The only change I made was to mix the cottage cheese and sour cream together before adding it to the layers.

Made this lastnight for dinner and it was pretty good.  Did a few things differently though: didn't use sausage, used ricotta instead of cottage cheese, used all shreaded cheese and didnt make layers i just mixed it all together and topped with some more cheese, oh, and added some fresh basil.

This was so good it was sick!  We had company so I took a risk and made this for supper.  I did some variations (i.e. turkey Italian sausage, etc.) per other reviewers' suggestions.  Excellent choice... I think everyone had seconds!  I will be making this again in the near future.

we have been making this recipe for years.  it is sooooo yummy.  it has the right amount of flavors going on.  we always add extra cheese and garlic. it is a must to have fresh rosemary.  my husband loves to make this dish he thinks its a fun one to put together.  we make it ahead of time let rest in fridge till ready to eat.  let set out for about 15 min the pop it in the oven.  it maked a huge batch i mean huge.  perfact for company served with a side salad and homemade bread sticks.  we always have extra and is wayyyyy better the next day. we always send some home with our guest.  my neice and nephew said they dont like dishes like this one, they went back for 3rds!?!?!?  thanks for the keeper.

Made this recipe as called for (with the exception of the sausage...used a different sausage I had on hand), and it was good...everyone had seconds. However, I don't think it was quite as good as my usual lasagna, but a decent alternative. Even my 9 year old who refuses to eat lasagna actually had seconds.

Great recipe! I just lightened it up a bit by using lite sour cream, lite cottage cheese and sweet Italian turkey sausage. I also used whole wheat rotini as I could not find whole wheat ziti. I had no fresh rosemary on hand but did add a Tbsp of Italian seasoning and will add a bit more next time. I've always made my own sauce but was in a pinch and found a really great jarred sauce....Victoria Marinara....they use everything I would use...imported Italian tomatoes, pure Italian olive oil, fresh onions, fresh basil, fresh garlic, sea salt and spices....no high fructose corn syrup, tomato paste, sugar, etc. You get the idea. I thought I would feel guilty not making my own but my husband could not even tell! I will make this again and again!

This is a very good recipe to start with and add your own twists. However the meat needs a little oregano or italian seasoning, and DEFINITELY replace the sour cream and cottage cheese with ricotta.

I made this recipe for my family one night and the only thing I did differently was I left out the rosemary (I didnt have it on hand).  I followed all directions and it turned out absolutely fab!    There are 4 in my family and we all ate it for 2 meals and we thought it was even better the next day(I was surprised because it was really tasty fresh).  My mother in law really really enjoied it.  She asked for the recipe and I came back to the site and printed it and gave it to her.  I wish I could have taken credit, however a recipe this good I felt it very necessary to give credit where it was due.  Great recipe!!!

I made this with a single pound of ground pork sausage, ricotta cheese (in place of the cottage cheese and sour cream) and I ended up using an entire 3 lb jar of pasta sauce. This was phenomenol. Cheesy and gooey with just the right amount of sauce so that it wasn't dry. Was fairly easy to make as well, just a bit time consuming for my tastes, but I loved it, as did my whole family.

I made this just as the recipe said, except I left out the sour cream, b/c my husband won't eat sour cream. I served with green beans & garlic bread, and this was AMAZING!! The sliced Provolone REALLY knocks this recipe out of the PARK! THANKS for sharing this one with us!

Yum! The cottage cheese/sour cream combination is so much tastier than ricotta cheese. I also prefer to use only spicy italian sausage instead of ground beef. Everyone who has tasted this has asked for the recipe.

This recipe is a family favorite!  I've made it many times!  I don't use any sausage in mine and I use 2 lbs. of ground beef.  We like ours a little more meaty!  This is a great meal when we are having company because it will feed about 8 people.

This was really really good! It makes a lot of product so we used a huge aluminum lasagna pan, worked perfectly. We used 6 or 8 provolone slices total. Make sure you cover with foil while baking this! Next time I'll use ground Italian sausage instead of ground beef. Thanks for this!

Absolutely AMAZING! However, I did make some changes. I have tried many recipes for baked ziti and this will be my forever keeper! This is what I did, First I used the sause recipe from World's Best Lasagna from this site (using only 1 Tbsp. sugar and a huge Tbsp. fresh basil). Then, back to the Baked Ziti recipe, I added to my sauce the additional sauteed onions, garlic and FRESH rosemary also adding a tsp. freshly dried mint from my herb garden (The secret to REALLY GREAT sauce!). I mixed the cottage cheese with the sour cream and only used mozzarella cheese (personal preference). I finished by at least doubling the parmesan cheese and WOW! INCREDIBLE! This definitely puts and end to looking for the best Zita recipe! This is it!

Pretty tasty. I used 1/2 tsp dried rosemary because I didn't have fresh rosemary.

Fabulous, kids loved it!  Rosemary is the secret increditent.  It's the "surprise" flavor in every bite.  Love it!

I thought this was good but not fantastic.  I substituted ricotta for cottage cheese as suggested.  I also needed this to be vegetarian so I substituted mushrooms and broccoli for the meat.  Perhaps I was too skimpy on the cheese (I didn't measure precisely).  In any case, it received good reviews from all the diners and made tons!  I was skeptical that this would make enough for 12, but it did.  Probably 8 large portions and 12 regular sized portions.

This was delicious and easy to make. I used only mozarella (the only cheese I had on hand), and used a combo of ground turkey and ground beef. My family thought it came from a restaurant. This is a new addition to our family recipes!!!!

This was a delicious recipe! My husband said it was the best baked ziti he's ever had. I used ricotta rather than cottage cheese and both sliced and shredded mozzarella. I mixed all the cheeses and sour cream together instead of layering individually. Wonderful!

My mom said she will never make a different kind of ziti after trying this!! It is delicious, the only thing I did different was use ricotta instead of cottage cheese. I'm sure the cottage cheese would of been just as good though!!

Great! Tastes fine with less cheese, I used just enough to cover the layers. And I didn't use the pork sausage, I just used another half pound of ground meat.

This was delicious! Sometimes I worry when I try a new baked ziti recipe that it will be dry. This was not dry at all. It was very creamy. The flavor was terrific. This recipe is a keeper for my family.

This is the best ziti pasta I have had. I made this as written and it turned out delicious! Next time I might cover it while baking as another reviewer suggested but it was good as-is. I will not look for another recipe for baked Ziti! Thanks!

Two thumbs way up! It's an easy way to make a classic.  My Fiance' couldn't eat enough of it.  The only thing I changed was putting a full pound of each meat (we're meat lovers), came out wonderfull.  Easily a family fave.

My husband LOVES this recipe! He asks for it about every other week.  It is great how it is, but I think that it can be a little dry after it cooks (my husband thinks it is perfect), so this last time I made it I added a little more sauce than it called for and I thought it was great! We make it all the time!

OMG!! This is wonderful. I made this yesterday for my daughter's cultural Thanksgiving feast. The kids LOVED it. Most went back for seconds and I got many compliments from both kids and parents. The only thing I did different from what the recipe called for is that I did not have fresh rosemary and I did not want to buy it for just this recipe I used dried rosemary. I will be making this again for my family when they are visting for Christmas. Thank you for sharing!

This was really good even though I completely messed up the recipe and forgot the cottage cheese. I cut back significantly on the sour cream but its addition, as well as the provolone really did add a wonderful tast. I had to add more mozarella and would've increased the sausage and decreased the ground beef but that may be personal taste.

Delicious! The only changes I made were that I used Ricotta cheese instead of cottage cheese and I used dried rosemary instead of fresh. I served with a ceasar salad and breadsticks. I'll definitely be making this again!

Pretty good...About 4 1/2 stars for me..  BUT...I did make some changes based on what I had at the house.  I used all ground beef, not sausage (that would be a great addition).  Used penne pasta, added fresh oregano and parsley from the garden.  Subbed Ricotta for the cottage cheese.  Didn't have provolone so didn't have that flavor but added mozzarella to the sour cream mixture as well as on top. All my herbs were fresh and I never picked up on them, especially rosemary, so will add MORE the next time. So, if I had made it with those few things absent, I'm sure it'd be a 5*.  I also cut the recipe in half and it still made a ton!!!

This was tasty.  I'm rating a four... but having personal misgivings about Baked Ziti in general; probably won't make again.  This is the second recipe I've tried.  This one was a little dry; I had to add more sauce.  (Used my own marinara; five cups, still had to add more.)  First I thought baked ziti was a good, easier alternative to lasagna, but now I'm thinking I would - personally - rather make Italian-flavored goulash or baked pasta in marinara without the cheese to cut down on fat and cholesterol.  I know this is entirely a personal preference, but given the prep, cost, and nutritional considerations, I'm not sure that baked ziti in general is for me.

Excellent dish. I followed the recipe as closley as I can (keeping in mind that I hardly measure anything). My only change was that I used whatever spaghetti sauce I had in my cupboard, which happened to be a sauce with lots of flavor + mushrooms. The added texture of the mushrooms in the finished ziti was wonderful. The only thing I might try differently next time is gently mixing everything after layering because I had a lot sour cream spots.

This was delicious! I didn't have sour cream so I used a full 16-oz container of 'creamy' lowfat cottage cheese instead.  Also I used provolone instead of mozzarella both in the middle layer and on top.  I added in some fresh chopped parsley and chunks of leftover meatballs.
Very creamy and delicious.  I had to cook it a bit longer than the instructions said, more like 45 mins.
Deeeeelicious!!!!

This was good.  I layed slice of provolone cheese over the meat and then put the combined cottage cheese, sour cream and parmesan cheese over that.  IT was easy!!!!

YUM!  I have been looking for a great baked ziti recipe and this IS IT!  I made a few very small changes - I used penne instead of ziti (personal preference) and although I love cottage cheese, my 5 year old daughter prefers ricotta so I used that instead.  I topped it with panko bread crumbs and added a bit of veggies (carrots, peppers & celery). My biggest complaint about baked ziti is mushy pasta so I only cooked mine for 5 minutes.  Also, I didn't really layer - I sprayed the dish with cooking spray, put in the pasta and added the sour cream, parm and ricotta. I mixed that together and placed the provolone and fresh mozzerella on top then put the meat sauce over all.  Topped the whole thing with a little panko and baked for 30 minutes.  Far and away the best "ziti" ever.  THANKS!

I have just replaced my mom's baked ziti recipe with this one, it is by far much better than the one I have made for years.  I really liked the idea of using the sour cream and cottage cheese for a change from the usual ricotta.  This is defintely a keeper.

This was a hardy meal it was filling and good but not really my thing. It wasnt so much an italian style baked ziti it didnt have oregano or anything. Also the rosemary tasted really out of place. I wish this recipe was a bit more sweet and tasteful.  It was what I call "interesting". Not worth making again.

WONDERFUL recipe. 
As a veggie household, I crumbled in firm tofu instead of meat, and it was great... My 2 year old loved it.... The only problem was we cook for 12 servings and ate 8 servings ( 2 adults and 2 toddlers) !!!

Very good. I made this dish for a neighbor after having a baby. I doubled it and made it for our family as well. I didn't use sausage as that was a personal preferance. I also made my own meat sauce from this site (Ronnetta's Spaghetti sauce)and just used that with all the other ingredients. I also ommitted the rosemary, again a personal preferance. I followed the rest of the recipe and it was the best ziti I have ever had/ever made before. I made our family batch with rotini b/c that was what I had on hand and it was just as good. My neighbor loved it as well and complimented the sauce over and over. Again I made Ronnetta's Spaghetti Sauce from this site and then layered the noodles, provolone, cottage cheese, sour cream, sauce then noodles, mozzerella, sauce, and parmesan, I also finished it of with a little more mozzerella on top. definitely worth the cost will be my new go to dish for taking to church potlucks, neighbors, etc.

EXCELLENT! Loved it! Used all sausage and no hamburger. Added Italian seasoning to jar spaghetti sauce. Did everything else the same (definitely use the fresh rosemary, it's a wonderful addition)and the family raved about it.

This was awesome.  I pretty much followed the recipe exactly, but I did just use 1 lb sausage rather than half beef to save on ingredients.  Easy and yummy, and great leftovers too!

First time making this recipe and EVERYONE LOVED IT... Used amounts for 12 servings, but with a few variations - 1 cup of sour cream, 1 cup of cottage cheese, and 8 oz each of the provolone and mozzarella. Obviously, we love cheese! Tasted divine!

I mostly followed the recipe - used polish sausage in place of the other sausage (it's what I had).  We had family over for dinner and most everyone (excluding the youngest two) gives this recipe 5 stars.  My niece says, "It was really yummy!  It's my new favorite dinner in the world."  Thanks!

My husband loved this recipe. I followed the advice by mixing everything together instead of separate. I also used a pound of each meat the second time a round. It worked out great and he LOVED it. It makes a ton, so be ready for lots of leftovers.

I made this ziti last night, and we loved it!  I did make some changes with what I had on hand (ie, used all pork-taken out of the casing, no ground beef and I used sour cream and ricotta, not cottage cheese.  Otherwise I followed it the letter, and it was delish! A definite keeper in my house!

I actually took most of this recipe and a couple of other items from another recipe (Baked Ziti I) to make my ziti.  As others, I used ricotta cheese instead of sour cream.  Next time I may use a combination of both.  The ricotta was a tad bland.  I also added red and green bell peppers and and more herbs.  I needed that extra kick.  Without adjustments, I'd give this recipe three stars, but it can definatly be a five with a few extras.

Definitely don't forget to layer like the recipe says, definitely use a 10 X 13 pan, and DEFINITELY use homemade sauce!  This was a great recipe.

Delicious! My kids and I made this recipe together, and it was enjoyed by all. Great as leftovers as well. I even made an extra batch for the employees at my husband's business, and he said they devoured it! This will definitely become a family favorite.

Good baked pasta recipe. Made a few changes- used 8 oz. cream cheese (softened) instead of the sour cream.  Made my own sauce intead of bottled.  Added can of mushrooms.  Used basil and Italian seasoning blend instead of rosemary.

This is a carbon copy to a local Italian eatery here in the city. I have tried many times to match the flavor and look of their dish but was unsuccessful until now! Thank you...10 times over!

I made some changes to suit our tastes - which is why it gets 4 stars.  I scaled this for 6 servings since it's just 2 of us.  I used about 12 oz of pasta for a 9*13 pan and it still seemed like not enough.  Instead of cottage cheese and sour cream (DH hates s. cream for some reason) I used light ricotta and mixed all of the cooked pasta into that with some extra garlic and basil (we love garlic).  I used my own meat sauce that I had frozen leftover from the last time I made a big batch, and it turned out great.  Will definitely make again with my modifications.

I have made this ZITI for family and a group meeting. Both times it got rave reviews.  It is also easier than lasagne to throw together.

My tweaks: Use a good store bought marinara sauce. 
For vegetarians and heart healthy folks: sautee garlic, onion, rosemary together, and to that add well chopped carrots (about 1/3-1/2 cup or more) to add body. Sautee in some olive oil till onion and garlic carmelized. Also use low fat sour cream.

I did both versions for a meeting because a few folks were avowed vegetarians. I doubled the recipe, and simply split the onion/garlic sautee between the meat and vege versions, and added the marinara to both and then put two ziti casseroles together.

Some may say cover to avoid drying, but I kinda like the crusty parts. 

Enjoy!

I really think the sour cream is a nice addition. Gives the dish a slight tanginess. I didn't have provolone so I used sliced cheddar instead. It was still good but I think it would be better with the provolone. Used a full pound of extra lean ground beef. Thanks for sharing this recipe!

Awesome!  I totally screwed up the recipe and it came out great (forgot the sour cream, left out half the provolone by accident, used oregano instead of parseley..I was in a rush!).  My fiance and I loved it, and leftovers are just as good.  The recipe is easy on the wallet too which I love!  Fiance's reaction:  "This is a once-a-week meal!"

Made this for supper, using the ricotta as other reviewers.  It was ok, but it makes enough for about 20 people.  Next time I'll be 1/2'ing the recipe.

I made this last night with Ground Turkey. It was delish...seasoned up the turkey with oregano, garlic powder, steak sauce and some fresh garlic. WOW...used skim ricotta, and some shredded cheese on top. I also used light sour cream. Trying to cut back on the calories but the taste was the same. Served with a green salad and some garlic bread.

This was a huge hit!! I made it for my husband and my in-laws, who are true italians, and everyone raved about it.  I used ricotta cheese instead of cottage cheese, like others suggested, and it tasted great.  I skipped the sausage and used meatball mix(beef, pork,and veal)to eliminate the spicy bite.  The sourcream and rosemary(I used 1/2tsp dried) sounded wierd, but I threw it in anyway and I'm glad that I did!  This recipe is definitely worth your time!

Delicious!  I made my own quick sauce and only used sausage and it was AMAZING!  I stuck with the recipe and kept the  everything layered as suggested even though I was tempted to mix it all together!  I also used ricotta cheese instead of the cottage.  Thank you!

Made this for the season finale of The Sopranos...It was absolutely wonderful!!  We felt like we were eating right out of Carmela Sopranos kitchen.  Oh, I did add some crushed red pepper to the meat mixture for a little more flavor...and used a little more sour cream and cottage cheese than the recipe called for.  Yummy!

I've made this several times now, and it is always a big hit!  The only change I make to the original recipe is that I use all ground beef instead of sausage (just a personal preference).  It's wonderful.  Thank you!

I used 1 lb sausage, 1/2 tsp each dried oregano and basil, 1 tsp. italian seasoning.  Substitued ricotta for cottage cheese and in the ricotta/sour cream mixture added beaten egg and 1/3 c. grated parmesan cheese.  I mixed the meat/sauce with the ziti before putting into pan.  Then at the end since I had no plain meat mixture, I ended up topping with some extra sauce.  We like sauce and 2 (26 oz) jars were not too saucey in my opinion.  The recipe was very tasty!

My husband wanted to marry me all over again when I made this ziti.  It is definitely the best baked ziti I have ever had.  The only change I made from the original recipe was to add more seasoning to the meat (oregano, basil and Adobo).

Delicious and so easy to make.  I added about 2 cloves of garlic and a few pinches of oregano to the sauce and it came out great.

This is a great recipe, I've made it a few times and my family and friends have loved it.  I use Italian seasoning instead of rosemary and use 1 lb of ground beef instead of the pork sausage.

I also used ricotta and as I didn't have sour cream, used strained yogurt (made no difference in taste).
It was wonderful! Even my picky son loves it xx  Oh and used ground pork instead of pork sausage, its a keeper!

Well I made this tonight for the first time.  I used ricotta cheese instead of cottage cheese (I don't like cottage cheese).  I also used mild Italian sausage.  THIS WAS ABSOLUTELY AMAZING RECIPE!!!!!  The whole family loves this now more than my lasagna recipe.  I will definitely put this in my dinner rotation!!

This was pretty good... a little on the bland side.  If you're in the mood for mostly pasta, sauce and cheese, then this is what you're looking for.  If you like more bounce on your tongue, you might want to add some extra seasonings that your family likes.

Seth does not fib.  This recipe IS absolutely the best, I have probably made it about 10 times and I get rave reviews every time.  The rosemary and garlic mixture smells euphoric when it's sauteeing.  Try it with a bottle of Fat  Shiraz.

I used a lot more cheese than the recipe called for.  This recipe made a lot more than was needed for my family of four.  However, I placed the remainder in a casserole dish and froze it for later.  This is a good dish.  I will make it again.

At my fiance's request, I made baked ziti.  This recipe was easy to follow and turned out delicious.  He loved it.  I will definately make it again.  I used more sauce than called for and substituted turkey meat products, and it was wonderful.

This tasted a little too sweet for us, perhaps I changed the recipe too much? I omitted the meat for our vegetarian guests; I used only cottage cheese and no sour cream (as some people recommended); and I didn't have the heart to use so much mozzarella. But I'll try again soon, sticking exactly to the recipe.

It was okay.  Tasted good.  Nothing special.  It seemed very dry.  I may use a little bit less cheese next time.

Really good! I just made my usual speghetti sauce, with the addition of the ground pork (Sun Dried tomatoe sauce, a little hot sauce, a bunch of garlic, red onion, a little black bean with ginger and garlic sauce, ect ect...) I also added some cream cheese, and some Hellmans Mayo to the sour cream mixture. I then topped it off with cheddar and parm. Very tasty! We really liked the addition of rosemary. It went really well with all the flavours. Loved it :)

This is a great recipe.  I used Italian meatballs to substitute for the meat b/c that is what I had on hand. I quartered them and used less onion. My family loved it and I will definitely be making it again. Thanks for the recipe!

Great Ziti!  Next time I will add more of the cheeses and sour cream.  The cottage cheese was good, but next time I will use ricotta instead, just to compare.  My family really liked this dish.  Thanks!

I basically stuck with the instructions, but I did change the pork to sweet sausage, added a bit of tarragon to the meat mixture, and I baked the ziti covered for 20 minutes and uncovered it for the last 10 minutes. It was fantastic and the first time that I have made this and I will continue to make this!!! Thanks for the recipe.

I agree.  I used 2# of italian sausage instead of the pork/beef mixture.  I also sauteed chopped fresh mushrooms with the onions, garlic and basil.  Wonderful!

Great Recipe!  Very tasty and perfect for a large, hungry family.  I substituted ground pork for the sausage.  Instead of sour cream, I increased the cottage cheese.  I used part-skim mozerella and low fat cottage cheese for a more health conscious version.

I used layers of peperonni and used whole grain/ enriched penne pasta.  I also used reduced fat sour cream and 1% cottage cheese.  This IMPROVES with age.  My kids and husband said over and over how good it was!!!  EXCELLENT recipe!!!

We forgot about this in the oven and was overcooked by probably 10-15 minutes and it was still wonderful; just slightly dried out around the edges. Used ricotta cheese based on previous reviews. I also had to use a sligtly larger pan because the recipe yields so much.

This ziti was awesome! The only thing I did different was use ricotta/egg instead of cottage cheese. I added more sauce as well. It made a lot of food, so I froze most of it in individual serving containers. The rosemary is just perfect in this recipe, and the meats and cheese, oh my!!! This is a great dish to freeze, we already had leftovers and it tasted even better after being in the freezer for a few days!

Thank you, what a great recipe. I opted to use ricotta cheese for the cottage cheese. I will definitely make this one many times. Ooooh...leftovers will be wonderful for hubby and myself.

I just made this dish and it was really good.  We had dinner guests and all gave great reviews.  One guest (whose wife is an excellent cook and father-in-law is a professional chef) said that this was the best baked ziti he's ever had.

My family really enjoyed this dish.  I loved the fresh rosemary.  It's simple and very good.  I used the 8 oz. packages instead of the 6 oz. packages and I'm glad I did because the cheese was very good.  This will be repeated.

This was very good - even though I screwed it up!  I only added one can of spaghetti sauce.  Big mistake - big - HUGE mistake.  But, over the next week as I heated it up for lunch, I just added some tomato juice to the batch I was reheating in the microwave, and it was delish!  I definitely am going to try this again, but with the CORRECT amount of sauce.  Thanks, Seth.

This was WONDERFUL!  Soooo yummy, creamy and cheesey and delicious!  I did modify the recipe a bit, no meat, no onions or garlic, and no rosemary.  We did use about a teaspoon of onion salt and garlic powder and I also sprinkled on some Italian herb blend.  Next time I will use one cup of sour cream and one cup of cottage cheese.  I also used 8 oz. of provolone slices (a whole bag), and a whole 2 cup bag of mozzarella cheese.  Thanks for this rich and tastey recipe!

This is a keeper!  I used ricotta rather than cottage cheese.  If you like more sauce, you can use a smaller pasta, or not as much ziti.  I used tubini.

Great "base" recipe for you to tweak to your own tastes.  I prefer to use more sauce and add lots of peppers and onions.  Family really enjoys this one.

Oh my, I will be making this one often!  This is hands down the best baked ziti/pasta lasagna recipe I have ever tried.  So cheesy and so much flavor!  For you Trader Joe's fans, I used whole wheat pasta, extra virgin olive oil, red onion, 1 teaspoon Bell's seasoning (mix of rosemary, oregano, sage, ginger, marjoram, thyme, and pepper...this is from the spice section of the grocery store), 6  cloves of garlic (I always at 2 extra for good measure), 1/2 lb. ground turkey, 1/2 TJs Garlic Sausage (casings removed, crumbled), for sauce I used the Rustica (nice because it has mushrooms and a slow cooked flavor), 6 slices provolone cheese (sandwich slices), I doubled the cottage cheese, and not only did I use a 6 oz. layer of mozzarella in the casserole I also spinkled 2 oz. on top.  I cannot wait to finish the leftovers!!!! THANK YOU FOR THIS RECIPE!

A little bit of a time investment, but a wonderful finish with some to freeze or share.  Flavorful and cheesy!  My kids asked for seconds.

This recipe really had a lot of flavor, and was very tasty. 
I modified the recipe to 6 servings. It was more than enough for my 2 year old and son. I will make this again.

Made this last night and it is fantastic!! Makes enough to feed an army.  Not sure what I did, but my 9x13 was dangerously full...I think I need to split between two pans (freeze one for later?) or put in my big lasagne pan next time. Will be having leftovers tonight..and lunch...and tomorrow's lunch. :)

Supurb taste and complex flavours.  I used two mild Italian sausages for the pork sausages.  Will definitely make this again, no modifications needed.

I have been making this recipes for the past two years. Always a hit! I prefer to use ricotta cheese instead of cottage cheese. This recipe also works well with ground turkey instead of beef.

This was really yummy. The sour cream gives it a nice little touch & once the meat is cooked, it's really easy to assemble.  My boyfriend really loved this dish.

I have made this recipe several times in the past 2 years. It is always a huge hit! I have also done it with ricotta instead of cottage, with equally good responses. I use the plain original Ragu old world style, as my kids don't care for chunky tomato sauce. Serve with a good red table wine, garlic bread, salad.

This was my first attempt at ever making ziti.  Thought it might be worth a try since I read so many great reviews... and my family orders ziti quite often when we go out.  I'm glad to add my two cents -- this was wonderful! Thanks so much for posting this one; it's a real keeper!

Made this recipe for a lunch @ work and then for dinner @ home the same night. Was a huge success in both venues. Very cheesy, great flavor.   Fresh rosemary was not available, used dry. Will make again!  YUMMY!

I used Italian sausage instead of the ground pork, and ricotta instead of cottage.  This was truly a great tasting, very rich and filling casserole.  Hubby raved over this one, and is still eating the leftovers.

this is excellent, no doubt! just be sure you are read "12 servings" because it makes a LOT.  You need a deep 9x13, or just split it and have one to freeze for later. Rosemary really sets it apart from the others like it.  Yummy!

This is the best ziti ever!  My boyfriend compares it to his grandmothers and everyone else who has had it claims it is the best ziti they've ever had.  I use 1 lb hot italian sausage and no beef.

I've made this recipe four times, (and am making it again tonight) - it's always perfect.  I make it without the meat and it's still very hearty.

Super! When I try a new recipe, my husband usually takes a couple of bites than makes something else for himself. You can imagine my surprise when he finnished his plate and got up for seconds.  This is one to have and tastes great.

I didn't rate this right away, although it went over very well when we had guests over.  My husband admitted to me the other day, though, that he had been "thinking about it" and would like to eat it again.  I decided that called for a rating, then.  Served it with a Ceasar salad.  Loved it. In a pinch one kind of meat would work just fine.

This is great.  I substituted ricotta cheese for the sour cream and cottage cheese - it's a bit lighter and a bit closer to what might exist in Italy in baked Ziti.

Seth, thank you for this recipe!  It was great.  I'd never made baked ziti before, but I certainly will again because it was very good and easy (without being toooo easy, like opening a can of Spaghettios) and I got two big casseroles out of it (the other's unbaked in the freezer, think frozen lasagna that you buy at the store and bake at home).  I made some changes: No garlic because I thought I had some but didn't, no provolone because I didn't buy enough, no parmesan because I forgot to put it on the list, all italian pork sausage because didn't want to buy 2 packages of meat, ricotta instead of cottage cheese (low fat ricotta and sour cream) and I made some boo boos while putting it together, too.  I made the layers pasta, mozzarella, sour cream, ricotta, sauce, pasta, mozzarella, sour cream, ricotta, sauce, mozzarella.  Basically, I put on an extra layer of the cheeses.  But it certainly didn't hurt the taste!  The proportions of sauce, meat and pasta were perfect, not too wet, but not dry.  Thanks again!

I've tried half a dozen different ziti recipes over the years, but this is the one we've liked the best.  It's a hearty, flavorful, cheesy dish and my family loved it.  I didn't have any ground beef, so I used all sausage, which probably gave it more flavor.

One of my favorite Italian recipes, my wife loves it.  My only beef is substituting with cottage cheese, which you really can't even taste the difference to much.  Great with some red wine, heavy stuff--but isn't that what ziti is all about!!!

I've made this a few times, and it's always a warm and comforting meal that tastes even better the next day. To save time, I have used the jarred pasta sauce with Italian sausage in it and it is just as good.

This was very good. I will probably stick with Baked Ziti I from this site due mainly to its' simplicity, shorter list of ingredients.

This was very good.  I don't usually serve recipes that I have never tried before to company, but I took a chance because of the rave reviews.  I was glad I did.  It was much easier and less stressful than the usual lasagna I make, so I will definitely serve it again.  I substituted ricotta for the cottage cheese and combined everything except the provolone and mozzarella cheeses together.  I bought sliced mozzarella by mistake and it was fine.  If you cook it from a refrigerated temperature, I would suggest cooking it for 45 minutes, and letting it set for 10 minutes (just long enough for the garlic bread to heat up). I served it for Christmas dinner, and it was a huge hit.

Very good, made it for a family gathering and everyone liked it.  I thought it needed more sauce, and added a few extra pinches of spice.  Also a splash of red wine made a great difference.

This is probably the best baked ziti I have ever had.  And I usually dont like ziti! I might use all sausage next time instead of a beef/sausage combo.  Great stuff.  My boyfriend made it the next night and loved it also.  We used Ragu Traditional Old World Style, which was nice and not too overpowering.

5 stars all the way.  Omitted the rosemary and used one bottle Classico with Italian sausage and one Sweet Basil Marinara.  Did use the whole two bottles.  This is very delicious and I will definitely use this recipe again.  Thank you!

YUM.  I served this with the Italian sausage soup on this site and both went well together.  I used ricotta instead of cottage cheese, and mixed the ricotta and sour cream together before spreading onto the provolone.  I was afraid to use the ricotta b/c my sister and I are not be big fans of ricotta (or cottage cheese), but you couldn't even taste it with the provolone.  The pasta came out a little dry on top, but that was my fault, I didn't save enough sauce for the top like the recipe says.

This turned out sooo yummy! It makes a FULL pan of lasagna-like goodness. I used penne pasta instead of ziti; I'd think any pasta would work just fine. 
Thanks for sharing this recipe!

This recipe was great because it used sliced deli provolone cheese - something I wouldn't have thought of using!  I didn't have any pork sausage on hand, but nonetheless it turned out great.  I did add a few seasonings to the ground beef sauce while it was simmering - basil, parsley, garlic salt, onion powder, and a touch of italian seasoning.  It really made it even more flavorful, as if the sauce was cooking all day.  I tried it with penne pasta instead too and still had great results.  Thanks for the recipe!

I used both sweet Italian sausage and the ground beef. I substituted dried oregano for the rosemary. For some reason, I thought the oregano was too overpowering in the end. (Maybe my tomato sauce had the strong flavor?) Next time I make it, I will only use half as much. I will also add a small can of mushrooms and a chopped green pepper to the meat while it's browning. Overall, quite tasty recipe though with the combination of meats and creamy cheeses! Thanks for sharing.

I HATE sour cream, so I was a bit scared to try this recipe...but in the end, you couldn't taste it one bit.  I also used hot turkey sausage to cut a bit of the fat (along with light sour cream and cottage cheese). I did add oregano and basil along with the rosemary...and of course, way more garlic than called for!! -------- All that said...I wasn't really impressed with the recipe. I didn't think it was bad...but it wasn't spectacular, either.  I probably won't make this again...too much effort, not enough pay off!

This is sooo yummy. I didnt have any ziti so i used rotini but it turned out perfectly. I really liked how when its cut, its comes away from the pan in a clean cut square (i know but i am a little picky about these things especially when serving for company). The flavours are delicious, and the only change i made was to add 3/4 tsp. of sugar to the sauce to cut the acidity. I can't wait to make this again!

This was  good but I was expecting something more unique because of the rosemary and other non traditional ingredients such as sour cream. I used dried rosemary and one pound of sweet Italian sausage rather than the hamburg/sausage mix. Perhaps the sauce I used overpowered the other ingredients, and perhaps fresh rosemary would be better. This was more work than some of my other ziti recipes, but I'm not sure the taste is substantially different.

This was great!  Lots of leftovers though.. I doubled the recipe to cook for 2 friends who had babies, and I had so much left over!!!  You may want to halve the recipe if cooking for a small family.

This one lives up to it's reputation!  I followed the ingredients and directions exactly (well, almost...I did mix the sour cream & cottage cheese together to sread more easily) and it is very good.  I used whatever jar sauce (w/mushrooms) that was on sale and was pleasantly surprised how much better it tasted with the sauteed onions and rosemary.  It does make a ton...and reheats well, too.  Enjoy!  Thanks Seth for sharing!

This was a big hit!  Very cheesy and delicious.  I don't care for cottage cheese, so I substituted ricotta like some other reviewers did.  It took me longer to prepare than the recipe states, but I tend to be a slow cook.

This was an outstanding recipe! It's the only one I'll use from now on. The sauce/meat/pasta combination was percectly proportioned. My husband doesn't like ziti.... but he thought this was great! He had thirds!! Thanks for an awesome recipe. I'm not afraid to make this for my aunt and grandmother who are great cooks. :o)

I made this for the first time with guests... everyone loved it!  I added more cheese also, and made with 1 lb. ground turkey (I will decrease to 1/2 lb. next time).  Delicious!

This is the best Baked Ziti I have ever made. I will ALWAYS use this recipe. Perfect amount of sauce and cheese. My husband and kids loved it. I was very surprised it called for sour cream, but since I made it, I would never make it with out it! Thanks for a great recipe!

Rich, tasty cheezy meaty Ziti! You can't go wrong with this recipe. REPEAT: you can't go wrong with this recipe! Don't bother making a salad, because it makes enough for an army. It's a bit of an artery choker, so I used lowfat sour cream and cottage cheese and it's still great. Also used Italian sausage which I think really sets this recipe apart from the others. It makes a lot of leftovers, which reheat nicely.

I didn't use as much Italian sausage as the recipe called for, since my stomach objects. It was still delicious.

I couldn't find a pound of dry ziti, nor did anybody at the store ever here of it.  But, hey I'm new at this.  I used lasagna pasta and I and my family thought it was wonderful.

This is a really great dish.  I substituted ricotta for the cottage cheese.  I also used no fat ricotta and sour cream.  It didn't seem to affect the taste at all, everyone thought it was delicious.

I thought this recipe was delicious!!  I read the reviews first so I substituted the ricotta for the cottage cheese.  The only problem was it took a lot longer than 30 minutes to prepare and the ingredients were not so readily available.  All in all though, because it tastes so good I think this dish would be especially good for a casual dinner party.

I love baked ziti and was excited to try this recipe. My family likes Italian food, so I figured they would like it. BUT...I didn't think they would go back for 3rds and 4ths! My five year old loved it and has been asking for it everyday since I made it. Wonderful recipe! Thanks!

This has the best qualities of a good lasagna but is much easier to assemble.  My husband and his Soprano-crazy friends loved it!  I used skim milk ricotta instead of cottage cheese, and light sour cream instead of regular.  It reheats very well, too.

Ever since we started watching "The Sopranos" on HBO, my husband has been wanting to try Baked Ziti. I've been searching and searching for a recipe with readily available ingredients, and I really like this one. It's not too difficult, and it makes great leftovers. Will make this again - probably to celebrate the season premiere.

Being 1/2 Italian, I couldn't imagine using sour cream(?) in baked ziti. But I gave in & all I can say is it is delicious! I did use ricotta instead of cottage cheese, personal preference. But this is so EASY & everyone absolutely loves it.!Thanks! Try it you'll like it!!

This was beyond awesome!  The left-overs were even better.  My whole family gobbled it up and this is a recipe that I plan to make over and over again.
