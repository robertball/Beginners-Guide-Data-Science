I am the recipe submitter and there is an important step in the recipe that is missing...You MUST cook, crumble and drain the sausage VERY well before putting it into the crockpot w/ the other ingredients. Also, I use my 1-1/2 quart slow cooker when I make this and that workes out perfectly!  Thanks and I hope you enjoy this recipe as much as we do! :)

I went out and bought chorizo specifically for this dip. I don't keep Ro-Tel on hand--I substituted one can petite diced tomatoes and one 4 oz. can mild green chilies. My husband and kids INHALED this dip. NOTE: This does fit into a small crockpot and if you throw the ingredients in and start it around seven, it's good to go by lunchtime.

I love this recipe-and anything with chorizo in it! I use soy chorizo instead because of the high fat content in the real deal. Tastes every bit as good!

I make a variation of this, but I also add into it some sour cream and taco seasoning. Sometimes instead of sausage I use shredded mexican chicken and chili/mexican beans, turns out awesome :)

Best party dip ever!   Quadrupled this recipe for a recent party and it was completly gone in no time.  I will only use premium chorizo when making this.....comes from a local butcher shop....tried the cheap chorizo from the grocery store and it was nowhere near as good.  I make this EXACTLY as written and would never change a thing.  We've used this as topping on baked potatos and over hot dogs and it was awesome as well.   Next is to use it as filling in an omelette!   Anxious to see how that works out.

My husband usually likes his food spicy, so I was excited when I found this recipe! I made some changes to this recipe. I was able to find velveeta pepper jack cheese so I used that in addition to all the other ingredients! Turned out so great that my husband is wanting me to make again!

Really? Set this up in the am. Hit the glacier and skied all day. Came back at like 4 with some buddies and this thing sent me off on a rock star reputation. It's BEYOND good. And here in whistler, almost everyone is a chef or server so the foodie standard is very high compared to other regions. (Livin in a tourist town,lol)
Do your self a favour and get yourself a bunch of new friends and appreciation for awesomeness! Do it!! Do it now...

We had made 7 lbs of homemade chorizo and I was looking for recipes to try with it.  This one was so good for game day!!  I mixed it up a little based on what I had at home.  Instead of using all Velveeta I threw in a little monterrey jack.  And my dip seemed a little thick so I added a small amount of salsa.  Very good recipe and easy to make. Thank you for sharing.

This dip is so delicious! I just made it for a party with friends and it was gone in 5 minutes and so many people were asking for the recipe. This will be my go-to app recipe now!

This dip was a huge hit at our last football party. My little (1 quart) slow cooker was just right. I accidentally bought pre-cooked chorizo instead of bulk, so I just chopped it into small pieces (casings removed) and tossed it in. Delicious!

made a quad batch of this for new years...we chowed on this all night and had some left over.

not being the wasteful type, I wanted to use it up and figured wtf not, it could be an enchilada filling.

filled a few gordita wrappers, put them in a 9x17 covered in salsa and cheese, and baked for 30 at 350.

freaking yum!

anyways, great recipe!

I made this with spicy chorizo and the dip turned out better than than the 3 I've tried at 3 different Mexican restaurants after I made this. My kids loved it. Can't wait to make again.

The only negative comment about my dip was that it was really thick (not as viscous as a queso dip). All in all, the flavor was wonderful. I took some other tips and used good quality chorizo and made sure I drained it well. I'll most definitely try it again!

This is very easy and very yummy! It tasted great on top of baked potatoes. I think I'd double the chorizo next time.

I could find chorizo so I used italian sausage. Everything else I did the same and it is delicious!
