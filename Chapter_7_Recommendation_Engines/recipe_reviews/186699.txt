I made this in advance for super bowl but my husband and adult children wanted to have it for super that night because it smelt so good and the taste was even greater. I did not alter one thing, I will warn you that it is hot but that was why I wanted to make it in the first place and it didn't let me down.

Living my whole life in Buffalo, this was right up my alley!  We loved it.  I did make a few small changes, used boneless chicken instead of ground, used half of the chili powder, no cumin, and 2/3 cup buffalo sauce.  And I did it in the crockpot.  Great Recipe!

So I thought this chili recipe was great. Although I had hoped it would taste more like buffalo chicken. I made this a second time, playing with the ingredients a little. I used regular chicken breasts and cut them into small pieces. Instead of using olive oil i used cooking spray and only 1 tbsp. butter. I then reduced the amount of cumin and chili powder so that it would not overpower the buffalo taste. Tasted more like what i was expecting from the title. If it is still a little too spicy, add a little bit of ranch to cool it down.

This is a good alternative to beef chili, but needs some work.  I just won best overall at a chili cookoff at work, which surprised me a little.  Next time, I will use shredded chicken as well for a different texture and thicken it a bit.  This was a bit runny.  Plus, it is a little too tomatoey.  I also added more heat by adding diced jalapenos.  I will make it again, but work with it to try to make it taste more like buffalo chicken.

I made the Recipe: 2lbs of boneless skinless chicken breast, cubed 1 med onion chopped 1 red bell pepper chopped 1 cup of frozen corn 2 15 oz cans of dark red kidney beans partially drained 1 28 oz can of diced tomatoes w/juice 2 cans of tomato sauce I believe they are 15oz ea 1 sm. can of tomato paste 1 sm. can of chopped green chiles (w/juice) 1/2 cup of buffalo sauce 1 tbsp Cumin 3 tbsp chili powder 1 tbsp of paprika 2 tbsp of minced fresh garlic 1 tbsp of extra virgin olive oil 2 tbsp of butter  Followed the same cooking instructions but this way its got kick but not too spicy. And I read one review where someone said it was too thin.. there fore I added the tomato paste. Its good and not too thin or thick.. I am so glad I read this recipe. I topped mine with shredded cheddar cheese. It was excellent. Thank you!

Thank you Lisa for a great recipe. Living in the Buffalo, NY area I've been adding Frank's Hot Sauce to my chili in restaurants for years.  I never thought to actually add it to the recipe.  Good call!  I made this recipe as written and I'll make it again the same way.  Be sure to use the Frank's if you can find it.

i fixed this chili because of the high rating. It was good, not outstanding, could have cut down on the hot sauce a bit. but it has to be relatively healthy. will make again, less hot sauce.

I love this chili and have made it many times, always with rave reviews. For the meat, I have mixed it up a bit and have used turkey as well as beef. This would also work well with soy "meat." The only changes I have made are in terms of spiciness. I like my chili spicier than this recipe calls for, so I add a bit more hot sauce and chili pepper and I also get the diced tomatoes that have jalapeno in them. When I eat the chili, I also like to sprinkle cheese and cut onions on the top and top it all with a dollop of sour cream. I also love to put this chili on top of spaghetti. Very versatile!

I am pleasantly suprised by this recipe, although I did modify it quite a bit. As suggested in other reviews I used chicken breast, only 2 tbsp chili powder, 1 tbsp cumin, 1 can of tomato sauce, increased then franks wing sauce to 3/4 cup, added 1/4 cup franks traditional hot sauce and 1/4 tsp celery seed.  I cooked the chicken and sauce in the slow cooker all day, then added the veggies when I got home from work, and cooked on hight for an additional half hour. Served with baked tortilla chips from this side. With the modifications this was VERY Buffalo-y! Mmm!!!

Good recipe- the guys love it, I even had someone request I make it for their wedding!! However- I found this recipe on RachealRay.com I use white kindney, red kindney and butter beans. Also sometimes I put chopped up clelery, something I dont. and I ALWAYS use shredded chicken!! Just get a rosted chicken from your local store, it's so easy and tastes aweme- I have never used ground chicken..

I make this all the time, but I use a whole cup of Franks Red Hot (not the wing sauce - too vinegary), I add black beans, 1 TBSP honey, and top it with crumbled BLUE CHEESE! I get so many compliments every time....its AWESOME! It really tastes like hot wings!

Even though I had to make a couple of substitutions, this was awesome!  I used diced tomatoes instead of crushed, and I only had about half of the chili powder it called for so I just cut back the other spices proportionally and added a little extra RedHot sauce.  Mmm!  My husband sprinkled a little blue cheese on his and said it was amazing :)

This won a recipe contest?  It definitely doesn't need salt added to taste.  Too acidic and salty (possibly due to the Frank's since this had the same effect on another dish I made with allrecipes).  It's still sitting in the fridge and no one wants to eat it.

Used parboiled chicken breast instead of ground and used a bit more hot sauce.  Served over Barilla Plus pasta along with crumbled tortilla chips, shredded cheddar and low fat blue cheese dressing.  Definitely making again!!

I liked it but the hubby didn't care for it....too tomato-y.  I see what he was saying but it didn't bother me as I love tomato soup.  Maybe next time I'll do a can less of tomato sauce and do chicken or beef stock instead.  All the seasoning were perfect though!

This was the most divine chili I have ever had.  The only change I made was I ran out of chili powder so I threw in a little cayenne pepper.  The heat was just right and the flavor was perfect.

My family loves Buffalo Wings so we were excited to try this on a cool, football watching Sunday night!  I halved the recipe and used 4 chicken breasts cut into chunks and cooked exactly as directed.  We felt it needed more "Buffalo" taste.  I used 2/3 of a 17.5 oz. bottle of Buffalo Wing Sauce.  Top with chili cheese corn chips and a little sour cream to cool the heat. Yummy!

Absolutely fabulous. My husband and I are buffalo chicken fans, which is why I made it in the first place.  I was actually expecting it to have a stronger buffalo flavor, making it very distinct from traditional chili.  I'd say it still has a strong tomato flavor for anyone who's worried about how much difference there might be.  But you could add more hot sauce if you wanted to as well.  I also only had about 1/2 the amount of chili powder it called for, but I still thought the spicy "temperature" was just right.  I cooked the chicken and veggies/spices, then mixed it with everything else in my large crock pot and had it on high for two hours while we were at church. (Probably would work better on low - I was going to turn it down before leaving, but forgot...just added a little water when I got home so it wasn't so thick.  I'm definitely going to make this again.

This chili was excellent! I used 1 can of kidney beans and 1 can of refried beans, which thickened it up a bit. I also added a can of diced tomatoes in lieu of some of the sauce. Very good recipe.

I made a double batch of this chili for the super bowl and it was perfect.  Followed the recipe and served it with the cheese, corn chips and sour cream.  Everyone loved it and went back for seconds.  Will use this recipe again.  It's a keeper!

This is a nice version of an old standard!  Using the ground chicken (or even extra lean ground turkey) brings down the fat content, but adding just a little butter adds the flavor back.  The butter and Buffalo wing sauce blends together to give it the "Buffalo Wings" flavor...Very good!

This is awesome chili!  My husband isn't able to eat red meat, and this is perfect for him.  Anyone that loves chili, will love this one too.  I also freeze it in lunch size portions, and it is delicious.

This is a fantastic recipe!  I used chicken breast in this becuase I liked that better than the ground chicken.  I also used closer to a cup of Frank's than a half cup.  It needed a little more Buffalo flavor.

I tried this as written and thought it was really good!  Next time I make it, I'm going to try to let the buffalo flavor come through by cutting down the chili powder/cumin and adding more buffalo sauce.  I also might try shedded chicken instead of ground.  Lastly, it is a little saucy so I may cut back on the tomato sauce.  Overall, very good, healthy, and highly adaptable!  Thanks for sharing!

I used whole chicken breasts and shredded them... it was good but not awesome, hence the 4 stars. I'm not entirely sure what was off, but I think I like buffalo chicken in a sandwich better than in a bowl.

My rating scale (cause number of stars is subjective): 1-Didn't like it, 2-It's okay, 3-Liked it, 4-Loved it, 5-Can't get enough of it. We love this chili!!! I really can't say more... Ended up making a triple batch and freezing.

A good tasty chili, but boy this is HOT. Too hot - if I make it again I will cut the chili powder and hot sauce in half.

I made this for my girlfriend the other week and she loved. I have never seen her eat so fast in my life, believe me she is an incredibly slow eater. The two things I will change for next time is going to be doubling the quantity of chicken and sticking to one kind of bean. Other than that awesome chilli. Thanks

I made this for my fiance, who loves anything and everything with Frank's in it. He loved it! I followed the recipe as written except for increasing the Frank's. I actually probably quadrupled the amount of buffalo sauce (he has some crazy high tolerance for spice)... I just slowly added it until the spice was way too much for me, then I knew it would be perfect for him. He said it had the perfect flavor and that it was 5 stars all the way. Thank you, I'll use this recipe again! :)

Very tasty. Won a chili cookoff with this! Doubled (tripled?) the garlic, used about 3/4 c Franks hot sauce (not the buffalo sauce), shredded chicken breasts, and added a little cream cheese. Slow cooked for 9 hours.

This recipe is a great use of chicken and Frank's® Hot Sauce.  We had a carry-in at school and I contributed this chili.  It was a huge hit.  Since I am not a big fan of red kidney beans I used rinsed black beans, but kept everything else the same.  The longer this soup can meld the better it gets.  That being said, the chili was even better the second day than it was the first day.  It was also a little spicier the second day.  I’ve shared this recipe with many and I know it will have a repeat performance at our house.

This was a nice change of pace.  I opted to turn it into a crock pot recipe by tossing everything into the crock pot, along w/2 BLSL chicken breasts (which I pulled and shredded when they were done).  Mr. LTH is a sissy when it comes to spice, so I decreased the chili powder to 3 T and a little less Frank's.  I love spice and this was still spicy enough for me and Mr. LTH just deemed it "very good".  I subbed diced tomatoes for one of the cans of sauce to give it more texture and left out the celery per personal preference.  Thanks for the recipe, Lisa!

I won a chili cook-off at work with this recipe.  This is really good.  I used a 28 oz. can of crushed tomatoes and less tomato sauce to make it thicker.  I also added black beans and used shredded chicken instead of ground chicken.  Wonderful chili flavor with a nice kick.  If you want to make it hotter or more of a traditional "buffalo" flavor, then add more Frank's and less Chili powder.  However, it's wonderful as written.

Made this last night to try and use up some buffalo wing sauce that I didn't want to let go bad. No one in my family is a big fan of the "buffalo" flavor but I figured I'd go for it anyways. Besides being afraid that it would taste TOO much like buffalo sauce I was also worried (based on other reviews) that it'd be too spicy or taste too much like it's tomato base. None of these concerns were a problem because I can't even describe what this chili tasted like. The only thing I did differently was use 1 1/2 lbs boneless chicken breast cut into cubes instead of ground. Otherwise everything else was there in the amounts described and the result didn't have an overwhelming taste of any of the ingredients...it just was. If that makes any sense. The chili was okay, but I like traditional chili too much to ever make this instead.

Delicious chili.  I made adjustments based on how strict I am with my diet, so I used olive oil in place of butter.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly and it was incredibly good.  I like that it's thick and substantial yet very healthy at the same time, so you're full when you're done but don't feel guilty because it's so healthy.

My guys loved the way this tasted. We all agreed though that the veggies ruined the chili and won't be adding them next time. I also had to add extra buffalo sauce.

Great recipe! As others have noted, adjust the chili power depending on how spicy you like your chili. I up the buffalo sauce to 3/4 cup because I love the taste of that stuff. I also use only a single can of tomato sauce to keep the chili nice and thick.

We loved this. To play it safe, I only used half of the chili powder and cumin. I did use the hot sauce amount called for. Next time I probably will use a little less tomato sauce- it was a little thin for ouir taste. But it tasted great- an ideal dish to bring for a potluck too

I think it's great! I listened to other reviewers and added less heat to start with which worked out perfect. I don't like things too spicy and I have kids eating it. I let it simmer longer at a low heat than what the recipe states as well... yum!

I won two First Place prizes out of four at a chili cook off with this! I beat out culinary professionals, restaurants, and individuals alike! People were coming back for thirds and fourths! Had competitors coming over because they heard how good it was from others! I made mine in a crockpot, and I added more/different stuff than what the recipe calls for. I added mushrooms, red/yellow/orange/green bell peppers, squash and zucchini. I shredded the chicken so everyone would get some in their cup. I made a sweet cornbread to accompany it and to offset any heat. I had ranch, bleu cheese, sour cream, shredded sharp cheddar, and mini celery sticks to be added at the tasters choice. People kept coming up to me asking which restaurant I was representing, and it felt so good to just say "myself"! I could t have been more proud of my chili and myself!

I just tried this and followed the recipe, but I cooked it in a crock pot. It was delicious although I don't think the carrots or celery added much so next time I will leave them out. I topped it with shredded cheese and cool ranch Doritos. It's a great chili recipe.

Used this for a work chili cookoff.  I altered recipe very little, used more Franks buffalo sauce and less chili powder, didn't use any salt or pepper while cooking.

This is very tasty! I tripled the amount of carrots and celery. Used one 15 oz tomato sauce and one 8 oz. Then equalized the liquid by adding an extra amount of buffalo sauce. I also halved the amount of chili powder. Very good!!!!!

Really good - pretty hot for us though, even though I just dashed in less than half a cup of Frank's. The recipe makes a good thick chili sauce.

I wanted to like this recipe but unfortunately, it's nothing special, just a hot chili. I realized too late that the veggies should have been sautéed with the chicken. By following the recipe they never softened because I didn't want to overcook the chicken.

I used this recipe for a chili/soup cook off at work and it came out great.  It was so good, I actually one the cook off!  Here is how I did it:  I put all the sauces and chicken breasts in a slow cooker and cooked all day.  When I got home from work I shredded the chicken and added the vegetables and cooked on high for an hour.  The modifications I made were 2 tbsp chili powder, 1 can tomato sauce, chicken breasts, and 1/2 cup buffalo wing sauce & 1/2 cup buffalo thick sauce.  You can adjust the amount of sauce to your taste.  Came out great!

My husband and I love this, but with some tweaks.  I only use half the chili powder, otherwise it overpowers the buffalo flavor, and I use between a third and half of cumin, because cumin is strong.  I usually use more carrots and celery (nothing wrong with making something more healthy!) and I double the crushed tomatoes and add no tomato sauce.  This is a great recipe to play around with, and like I said, we love it.  Rated it 3 stars due to my changes

This was pretty good chili for a change.  Not too spicy.  The only change i made was to use rotel tomatoes because that is all I had on hand.  Will make again as a healthy chicken chili.

Used only 2 tbl chili powder (all I had left), 1 tbl cumin (since chili powder was reduced), no carrots didn't have any and one can sauce. Used black pre-seasoned chili beans and dark red kidney beans, thought it came out great! Thanks for a great recipe!

AMAZING recipe.  I was going for a buffalo chicken flavor and ended up with the perfect combination of chili flavor and buffalo sauce.

I ended up using about .8 cups of buffalo sauce, only 3 (heaping) tablespoons of chili powder, and replaced half of the crushed tomatoes with diced tomatoes mixed with green chili peppers.

I threw my soup pot in the oven for a couple of hours instead of cooking it on the stove (don't have to stir as much this way).  All the roommates were extremely happy with the results and this will be a repeated recipe.

Very good, but I did make a few changes to make it even easier. I made it in the crock pot and I used boneless chicken breasts. I put them in the crock pot raw, then dumped the rest of the ingredients on top. The chicken will cook with the chili. after about 5 hours I removed the chicken, shredded it and put it back in the pot to simmer a few more hours. I also left out the carrot.

This is the first tomato based chili recipe that I've really liked a lot.  That's a good thing because it makes a ton!  I ended up only using 2 tablespoons of chili powder and 1/4 cup of Frank's Red Hot Sauce.  I suggest only adding that much at first, tasting it, then adding the rest.  It would have been way too spicy for us if I'd used it all.  I suspect my chili powder may have been spicier than most, it's Spice Island brand.  Next time I'm going to try add even more carrots than I did, and leave out the chili powder so I can add more hot sauce so more of the buffalo flavor will come through.

This soup was incredibly interesting and tasty. Firstly, I tripled the hot sauce and added approx. 1tsp. cayenne pepper (I'm a spicy person!)  At first when I tasted it before it had simmered for  few hours I was incredibly skeptical. It tasted ENTIRELY too salty. However, after those few hours that it simmered, I served it topped with shredded cheddar cheese and a dollop of sour cream and it was delectable!  Great recipe!

First - let me say that this is really delicious!  Everyone who tried it loved it.  I had two different recipes I was using and took some ingredients from each recipe. I did not use any butter, used 2 T. olive oil.  I did not use chili powder or ground cumin, just used 1 T. smoked paprika.  Used 1 can chicken stock, used X-tra hot Frank's Buffalo Wing Sauce, 1 can tomato sauce and 1 can Mexican Stewed tomatoes.  This is so easy to make and very tasty. Everything else was the same.   Will definitely make again.

Pretty good chili (if I do say so myself!)!!! Made this a day ahead so that my bf and I could have an already prepared meal the following night. I also wanted to give all of the spices a chance to "blend" overnight - chili tastes much better the day after it is prepared. My bf liked this (I'm shocked - he likes his chili HOT, HOT, HOT!!!) and said that it would be 5 star quality WITHOUT the beans (but he doesn't care for beans). I liked this, but as other reviewer's warned, it does not taste like buffalo wings at all (which I was hoping for...). I even upped the hot wing sauce to 3/4 c. (I wanted to clear out the bottle I had in the fridge). I think the next time I make this, I will add a LOT more wing sauce, maybe even a hotter variety than Frank's. This goes great with crumbled blue cheese on top as a garnish (makes it actually mimic the taste of buffalo wings - try it!). Served with carrot / celery sticks and blue cheese dressing on the side. I can imagine this being perfect for kiddos if you cut back on the spices a bit - and what a great way to "sneak" some veggies into their diet!!! Thanks for sharing :)

Very hearty and tasty way to prepare a healthier chili. It was great but didn't remind me of Buffalo Chicken flavor. I will make it again, but use more Wing sauce and less cumin and chili powder.

This is mighty HOT chili! I love this recipie as I’m always looking for ways to use inexpensive ground chicken. The only changes I made was I used only 1/4 cup of Franks Buffalo Hotsauce and 2 tablespoons of chili. For my family that was hot enough! I served it over baked potatoes and my kids thought it was awsome.

I left out the red beans and added Celery instead of carrots.  I also served it with sour cream and blue cheese crumbles.

New favourite Chilli recipe. Basically followed the recipe,with a few tweaks. We love hot so I added: more Frank's, red pepper flakes, diced tomatoes with chilies, and a little more chilli powder. I thought, as like most of the reviews, it looked a little thin so I added some tomato paste. Still too thin, busted out my favourite thickening agent: a teaspoon ( for about a gallon of chilli) xanthan gum. One teaspoon was all it took to tighten it right up.

I cooked the chicken on the stove top and then put all ingredients in a crock pot. Added blue cheese as a garnish to choose from. It was a hit.

Excellent with the suggested substitutions of diced chicken instead of ground and half as much chili powder.  I also replaced one can of tomato sauce with diced tomatoes.  This made it much less tomato-y, but not enough.  Next time I'll do 2 cans of diced tomatoes and completely omit the tomato sauce.

This is a really good chili!!!  Followed a few suggestions and  cut the spices in half to begin with.  I didn't want it to be too  intense for the kiddos.  I ended up using a 1/2 c of Franks because I too was looking for more of a hot wing flavor, and for personal preference I used black beans instead of white.
This was a hit.  And because my boys were looking for something more along the lines of like a hot wing dip, I melted a little cream cheese into theirs.  Holy cow!!!  Now that was some good stuff!

What an awesome idea!  I really wanted it to taste like buffalo so based on other reviews and what I had on had.  I used 2 lbs boneless chicken breasts coated with hot sauce, garlic powder, and cayenne baked and shredded instead of ground chicken.  I used more carrot, less chili powder, and no cumin.  Added 1 cup of frank's hot sauce (not wing), 1 can of tomato sauce, 1 can of diced tomatoes with roasted garlic simmered that for 30 mins, then added the shredded chicken, and 1 can of cannellini beans.  3 cups water and 2 T tomato paste gave the right thickeness and simmered an additional 30 mins.  Served with blue cheese on top

I really liked this chilli, I'm only giving four stars because I altered the recipe slightly following some of br0kenrage's recommendations, but still used mince. Also, I minimised the chilli powder due to the amount of heat that this recipe would produce. We like spicy, but obviously, compared to some, it seems we are wimps. I adjusted chilli powder all the way down to a half a teaspoon and put 3/4 cup of Frank's in it instead. It's the original Frank's since we don't have the buffalo sauce in Australia. It was a bit tomatoey but still lovely. I might try putting not so much tomato based cans next time and go for a chicken stock or bouillon. Overall, my husband seemed pleased, I enjoyed it and would make again. Thank you for sharing.

Wonderful recipe! I accidentally doubled the Frank's and to tame it down I added an extra can of white beans, diced tomatoes, and a 1/2 cup of cream. The cream made it look a little more like buffalo chicken rather than traditional chili. Next time I'll use a little light sour cream or lowfat milk to lighten it up. The seasonings are perfect! I used ground turkey because our store was out of chicken - the guys will never know. :)

I don't eat beef so I haven't had the chance to eat a lot of chilli, but this is perfect for me. I'm on a diet so I was looking for something easy to do with ground chicken, this is fairly healthy not much salt which is great. Delicious, definitely one of my new favorites!!!

This was very easy to make and really tasty. There are only two of us so I halved the recipe and it still leaves leftovers for the next day. Since I halved it I used 1 can of tri-color kidney beans for efficiency. Otherwise, I left the recipe exactly as written. Thanks for sharing!

Excellent chili.  I double the amount of beans to make the recipe stretch.  Then, add a dollop of blue cheese dressing on the side as an option.  So Good!

I followed the recipe as it was written exactly and thought it was only so-so.  Edible and reasonable but definitely not buffalo flavored and a little boring despite the super-heavy spice content.  Will not make again.  Definitely do not think that you need both the olive oil and the butter to brown the chicken.  One or the other would have been fine.

This was a big hit with my family. It is now my son's favorite chili recipe and mine too. I left out the beans, but other than that I followed all directions and it turned out awesome. It was thick and spicy with just the right amount of heat for my family. Will be making this many more times!

My husband and I loved this recipe.  It's a great change from the "typical" chili recipe.  It's easy to adjust the heat level--just decrease the hot sauce.  We like to eat it like a dip with tortilla chips, especially when it's a day or two old.

I made this recipe with the ingredients as listed (well, half the chili powder, kids don't like it too hot).  What I changed was the cooking method.  I completed step one, let the meat mixture cool and then froze it.  A few days later I thawed the chicken mixture and placed it in a crockpot with the other ingredients.  It cooked all day on low and turned out perfect! Made a great prepare ahead meal!

This was some awesome soup. We used less tomato, way more Frank's Buffalo wing sauce, sprinkled ranch pack on chicken, 2 kidney beans, 1 can black beans, and 1 can cannellini beans and few more veggies. We served with ranch flavored Fritos and topped with shredded cheese, diced celery and onion and sour cream (girls topped with ranch dressing).

I added extra buffalo sauce, but that's all I really changed other than the order I combined the ingredients.  I added the spices together ahead of time and sprinkled it in as I was cooking the chicken and veggies.  I used about half at first and then I added some of the buffalo sauce once the chicken was cooked through and let it cook like that for a few minutes. Then I added the rest of the ingredients and the rest of the spice mix and let it simmer.  It's a great recipe.  I recommend eating it with some blue cheese crumbles on top.  PERFECT!!  I will definitely make this again.

very good, my husband is not a fan of chicken as a replacement to hamburger in chili, but really thought this was tasty.  had a bit of a kick to it, so if you like spicy this is a very good chili.

This is a great recipe, but it is almost exactly Rachael Ray's recipe.  Her's does not have the beans in it,but i always use beans.  I only use 1/4 cup of Tabasco (the REAL pepper sauce) because if i use any more than that people complain it's too hot.

Like some other reviewers, I added some water to make it a little less thick and a whole 12 oz. bottle of wing sauce.  We ate it with crumbled bleu cheese sprinkled on top!! YUMMY!

Good chili recipe! I like mine a little runnier, so I added 1/2 can full of water and a can of tomato juice (not sauce) since it thickens up over night. I also add a can of corn, which I LOVE in my chili. It wasn't as buffalo-y as I thought, but I added twice the buffalo sauce it called for and some Sracha sauce (sp?) for extra eat. I also cut down the amount of chili powder by half per other reviews. All in all, good recipe.

This chili was defintely different and yummy. My husband loved it. I followed the recipe exactly and the only thing i would recommend would to not simmer for an hour. It came out kind of thick.. but it was still pretty good.

We loved it, but did use the whole bottle of sauce(he loves his spicy food!!) and it was great the first day, but it got hotter and hotter. He told me next time I could follow the recipe and he would add more as he needed,LOL!!!

Made this for my husband and stepson(chilihead) nad we all loved it. Not heavy feeling like beef chilies can be. I added 1/2 a red bell pepper. And cut the Franks down to 1/4c. for those of us who like to make our chili as hot as we like. Served it with sour cream,rice,cheddar and cornbread. This is a keeper.

I made this a few weeks ago and loved it. Who would have thought chili with chicken would be good? It was amazing. I doubled the serving size to 20 to fit into a large crock pot. It is a tight squeeze so you may only want to make a serving size of 15 in it. Love the recipe. You must try it to appreciate it

Great recipe.  We aged it a day before serving, it had just the right amount of heat.  It seemed a little dry so we added an additional can kidney bean undrained.  This is definately a repeater.

This was great chili!  I used chipolte chili powder and it came out smoking hot!  Next time I might tone that down a little bit.  I used about a cup of Frank's and a few more shakes on the top at the end.  I also subbed one can of diced toms for one of the cans of tom sauce because of what i had on hand.  Will make this again!  Thanks

I couldn't wait to make this and I was not disappointed!  I upped the Franks Red Hot to one cup and also added a bunch of chopped veggies (onions, green pepper, red pepper).  Next time we have a chili cook off at my office I'm going to make this recipe.  It is delicious!!

This is an amazing alternative chili recipe.  Like some of the others, I had a very pre-conceived notion of how this would taste before I tasted it, and the flavor was not what I was expecting.  That does not mean, however, that this is not a 5 star recipe.  I used 3/4 cup of Frank's Wing Sauce, and I will probably double it the next time I make this chili.  But keep in mind, this IS a CHILI recipe, and should also tast like chili, not just a hot wing.  I thought the submitter came up with a wonderful balance between the traditional taste of chili, and the lingering heat and flavor from a hot wing.  Thanks alot for the submission.

Good, but not as spicy as I thought it would be.  I would make it again, but add more wing sauce for my taste.  Thanks for the recipe.

Slow cooker adaptation: I did step 1 in a large skillet, then threw everything in the crockpot on High for 4 hours. Low for about 7 hours would probably be good too. The volume is large, so if you have a smaller crockpot, you may want to cut back on the serving size. The end product was a bit soupy for my taste, so next time I will thicken it up a bit by reducing the amount of tomato sauce. A keeper!!

Yum, this is really good!  I made it using 1 lb ground turkey and 1 lb rehydrated TVP instead of chicken, and with black and pinto beans instead of kidney beans.  Turned out very thick and hearty.  Thanks!

Thanks for a great recipe Lisa! I found it to be very tasty. It did not remind me of buffalo chicken however.I didn't use Frank's wing sauce but a much hotter type instead. What can I say I love heat!! I believe that ones choice of sauce will change the whole dynamic of the outcome. Also, as I do anytime I make chili, I made it a day ahead of time so that the flavors would have overnight to meld. I will certainly make this again and experiment with different hot sauces.

My husband and I agreed this was just okay.  It has a very strong tomato sauce flavor which overpowers the buffalo sauce flavor.  The spices don't seem to blend just right and between the tomato sauce and the cumin combined, it tastes slightly sweet.  I probably won't make this one again.

This was a good chili but I would not call it buffalo chicken chili.  It did not have a distinctly buffalo flavor to me at all.  It was a good recipe, a healthy alternative to chili with red meat.. I will probably make it again... It has been good as left overs.  Not buffalo though...

DELICIOUS!! I served it up with some garlic bread for the Superbowl, and there's not a drop left. I eased up on the spices a little, but the chili was still pure perfection. I will definitely be making this again.
