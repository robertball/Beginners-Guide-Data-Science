this is a simple, delicious recipe. However, if you have salt in your chicken broth already, i would not add any more salt at all. With the 2tsp of salt PLUS the salt in my chicken broth, the dish was much too salty.  I will not add the 2tsp of salt next time.

This recipe deserves more than five stars for absolute brilliance--I would've never thought to put curry in couscous!  My family was very skeptical as I was making this but we ended up with no leftovers.  As per other reviewers, I added some fresh garlic, cumin, and a bag of frozen veggies.  Will be making again soon.

This is a second review - 

OK - made this again, and even better!  For a double recipe, I took 12 wings and browned them on both sides.  Add a chopped onion, bell pepper, carrots - saute till tender.  Mix 2T curry, 1t turmeric, 1t cumin, 1t garlic, 1t onion powder, 1t oregano, 1/2t red pepper, 1/2t allspice, 1/2t cloves and mix into 2C hot water.  Pour into skillet, cover, and simmer until chicken is done, turning occasionally.  Toss in raisins, 2 cups water and 1 1/2C couscous.  Cook until done!!  WOW!

This couscous has already become a weekly treat in our house! We use more curry and more raisins just because we love it that way.  Made a triple batch of it for a graduation open house and had people just going nuts over it. Thank you, thank you, thank you!

Wonderful side dish!  Very easy to prepar and it's a nice change from potatoes or rice.  I did cut back on the salt a bit and left out the cilantro as my husband isn't a huge fan. Overall, very tasty!

This is my first time cooking couscous, I never bother before because I really thought it was difficult, hehehe, silly me.
But this was easy!!!! and it was really good, besides the cilantro and almonds at the end I also added some chopped green onions and chopped pecans, my boyfriend loved it, I'll be making this more often.

Very delicious. Even my fiance--who hates Indian--ate it.  He was skeptical about the raisins I put in, but it is a nice addition to the flavor.  I add garbanzo beans and peas to bulk it up. Add whatever you want to it :)

This was the easiest, most delicious side I have ever made!  I felt like I was eating at an Indian restaurant!  I mixed chicken in the couscous with some peas, it was amazing.  I really like this dish too because, like at the restaurant, you can make it as mild or as spicy as you want by adding red pepper flakes.

This is delicious! I am standing at my kitchen counter having just finished making this to go with tonight's dinner. I followed the  recipe exactly, with the exception of adding a bit of sauteed mushrooms. i sauteed them in the pan before adding the broth. I did not have fresh cilantro, but had some fresh purred in a tube. i added about a Tblsp to the broth before boiling. If you are hesitant about the raisins, don't be! They add another level of flavor that really makes this dish 5 stars. This will def. be a staple in my house from now on. Thank you for sharing this great and easy recipe!!

I really appreciate you sharing this recipe Janis! This was a hands-down winner with my whole family. The only change I made was to use whole wheat couscous. I've been buying the whole wheat kind, 6 boxes at a time, from Amazon and using it as a healthier alternative to white potatoes and white rice. The problem has been that DH and sons didn't really appreciate the change! :) Anyway, last night's dinner went much better. I'll be making this often! Thank you for a keeper Janis!

I liked this but it had mixed reviews from my family.  I think next time I would use low sodium broth and leave out the salt...I only used 1/2 tsp and it was too much.

This was really good.  I made it ahead of time and served it cold with supper.  It is more spicy when you serve it hot.  I was a little worried about that when I tasted it right after cooking it,  but after it sat for a while it seemed less spicy.  It worked out perfect because I have 2 small children and a father who are not to keen on even mildly spicy things.  I also added cumin chopped apple and red pepper.  I may try adding a little garlic next time as well.  I would cut back on the salt next time or else use low or sodium free broth.  I will definately be cooking this again as even my one year old ate this.  Thanks for the great recipe.

It is a very easy and quick recipe. I did not add the almonds but instead I added some chopped carrots and fresh mint. It is so rich in flavor!

This was a really delicious and moist cous-cous. I would have given it 5 stars, but for the salt. I used reduced sodium broth (although not LOW sodium) and the 2 teaspoons of salt as called for and it was markedly too salty. If you don't like salty food, please omit both teaspoons for this recipe. You can add it but you can't take it away.

This recipe is FAST, EASY, and DELICIOUS! My fiance and I could not stop eating it! I served it with roasted chicken. I cut up the leftover chicken and just mixed it in the couscous for the next-day leftovers. Here are the small modifications I made- I did not have cilantro or almonds so I omitted them. Also omitted the salt since I used regular chicken broth from a box. Then I simply added some frozen peas, a little cumin, and some ground red pepper. DO NOT omit the raisins! You may THINK you don't like raisins, but I DARE you to challenge your taste buds!

This is my first time making couscous and it was beyond simple. The flavor was pretty good and I added a bag of frozen corn the last 5 minutes. Turned out pretty good!

Amazingly simple & delicious! I added diced zucchini. May add rotisserie chicken next time to make it a one dish meal. Will be making this one often.

Best couscous recipe we have tried so far. I was a little nervous about the ratio of couscous and liquid since I used quick cooking couscous. The package instructions call for a 1:1 ratio, but the 1:2 ratio of this recipe turned out perfect. I used golden raisins. The whole family ate it very well.

My family and I loved this couscous recipe! I used chicken broth and put in half of the salt but it was still very salty...I will leave it out completely next time. I added cooked asparagus which gave it a very nice flavor. I will be making this a lot more!

Wow. What an easy way to make couscous tasty. Much to my husband's surprise, the raisins worked. I made the recipe as stated and it was too salty. Next time, I will cut the salt in half.

Delicious!  I did not add salt as I knew the chicken broth would be too salty for our liking but aside from that I followed the recipe exactly and it was delicious!!  Perfect with the Spanish Moroccan Fish recipe I found here on AR.  Thanks for sharing!

Loved this and the family asked for more. I made it as directed except cut way down on the cilantro - my family really doesn't like it. But, it's easily adjusted to what you like and have. Do use the curry and raisins. The almonds give it a nice crunch but do toast them.

i left out the salt- it was salty enough with the chicken stock. i also left out the cilantro and almonds because i didn't have them. i added 1/c shredded coconut, cumin, a small amount of garlic powder, and a touch of cinnamon. the sweet and spicy go wonderful together!

I followed this recipe exactly with two minor changes. First, I microwaved the broth mixture in a microwave safe bowl and added the couscous to it afterward. Second, I omitted the salt since I used bouillon cubes to make the vegetable broth and they are salty.  This recipe came out great! I definitely recommend adding the almonds!

This dish is FANTASTIC and super easy! My boyfriend hates raisins so instead i use dried cranberries. As well, at the end i add 2 T of butter for a little extra moisture. Great recipe, thank you for adding it!!

Wow!  coucous can always be counted upon for being fast and easy, but it can easily be bland.  this one was fabulous, just the right amount of spicy flavor for kids and grown ups.  I did add a clove of minced garlic to the chicken broth.  thanks!

My first stab at making a couscous dish. This was so incredibly simple to make. It took no time at all and was a very good accompaniment to the fried eggplant I was making. I think that next time I may add more curry powder. This is a quick and yummy summer dish too for when it is too hot to be spending too much time over the stove.

I love this recipe!!  But why 4 stars and not 5 you ask - well because 1 tsp of black pepper is just too much for me to handle, and 2 tsp of salt is overkill as well.  My husband has made this 3 times now, and the last two he scaled back the pepper to 1/4 tsp.  He also put far less salt in the second also.   The third time he added a little more salt than attempt number two, and now it's flavorful without being a spice overkill.  We also skip the cilantro (I don't like it).  Hubby also adds the raisins in last as he doesn't like them turning back into grapes.  I also requested last time that he increase the amount of toasted almonds.  The quantity is enough for us to both pig out at dinner, our daughters pick at and whine about their servings, and still have 2 more "pig out" size portions left for me to consume the next day instead of a normal breakfast and lunch - and then I get dirty looks for not leaving him any.  :D

I loved this recipe.  The only change I made was to leave out the cilantro because I don't like it.  My two year old grandgirl had seconds!

truly the easiest thing i have ever made and one of the most delicious. i used spicy curry powder to give it a kick and otherwise kept to the instructions and it was perfect. a box of far east couscous is the 1 and 1/2 cups you need, btw.

This was good, but I should have read the reviews first. It was way, way too salty because the chicken broth I used already had salt added. Beware if you use packaged chicken stock, you may not want to add additional salt.

Easy and tasty, but a little salty as is.  I wouldn't add salt since chicken stock is pretty salty already.

I halved the recipe. I used my own chicken stock that had no salt. I did not add the salt since I need a low salt diet. I also added 1/2 teaspoon of red pepper flakes, 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder, and 1/4 teaspoon ground cumin. This was fantastic ! A bit spicy hot, but I like hot. Thanks for a great recipe.

This was absolutely delicious!  I sauteed 1/2 sweet onion, 1 bell pepper, 2 garlic cloves, and 2 carrots (all chopped) in the EVOO then added that to the broth mixture with 1 tsp cumin extra.  I didn't add the almonds, and I used golden raisins since that's what I had.  Since I used israeli couscous, I had to simmer for a little on low to make sure that the juices were absorbed.  My husband is a huge food critic, and he absolutely loved it!

This is the way I make couscous too and my family loves it.  I often roast some veggies and put them on top of the couscous just before serving.  Also, instead of raisins I use dried cranberries because my son hates raisins ;)

DH and I enjoyed this recipe very much!  I added 2 sauteed onions and left out the almonds.  If anyone is doing WW - I put it through recipe builder and came up with 4 points for 8 servings.

This recipe was wonderful.  My fiance loved it!  I made it without the raisins and almonds, simply because I was out. Even without them it was great, but I look forward to trying it again with all the fixins!

Delicious.  And so Easy.  I used hot curry powder and served it with broiled salmon and spinach.  This would make an excellent, interesting side to a lot of dishes.

Quick. Delicious. Easy.  Those three qualities make this recipe a keeper in my book.  I didn't use any extra salt, and I still thought it was very good.  I was in a bit of a hurry to get this dish prepared, so I forgot to toast the almonds, so it will probably be even better the next time I make it with toasted almonds.  Thanks for the recipe!

I tried this recipe since I had curry and wanted a healthier couscous dish to make, and was fairly happy with the results after following these instructions.

My results may be a tad different cause I didn't have chicken stock so I used broth, and in lieu of cilantro I at first just omitted it. I also didn't have raisins or almonds so as such, my first dish was fairly bland. Not at all the fault of the recipe though, since so many things were missing.

Since I made a huge amount of this bland couscous, I tried to help my next serving the next day by adding something to combat the blandness. Right now I'm eating a bowl of it, with a liberal helping of dehydrated parsley, and I must say even though I'm still missing raisins and almonds, the flavour has been dramatically helped.

Overall I think this is a great way to make couscous, but as a word of warning, make sure you have cilantro or parsley on hand or you're in for a fairly bland meal.

On a side note I also added a can of chick peas when I added the stock/broth to the couscous, because I wanted to eat this sort of as its own meal. I don't think it alters the flavour much though, just makes it more hearty.

Very easy to put together and so yummy.  I did not add the 2 teaspoons of salt and didn't feel it was missed at all.  I used dried cranberries because we were out of raisins and that worked fine but next time I will use raisins.  I think their flavor would compliment the seasonings better.  I stirred in some shredded chicken to make it a bit more hearty.  This is definitely a keeper and provides opportunity for a cook's creativity.

This is a wonderfully easy recipe to make.  I love the curry taste, so next time I will probably add another half tablespoon curry. As one reviewer suggested, I added cooked cubed chicken, peas, and I also added a chopped apple.  Turned out great.  Thank you reviewers and thank you Janis P. for submitting it!!!!

This is amazing as is and my husband loves curry so it was a hit.  I used vegetarian broth and added Quorn chik'n pieces to make it a meal. This would be delicious with cashews, switching mint out for the cilantro, or adding green peas.

This was spicy and good, but missing a little sweetness to me. I added a bit of brown sugar. Next time, since it reminds me of pineapple fried rice, I think I'll use pineapple juice and chunks for the sweetness, and maybe throw in some cashews.

Wow!!!  I was making a coconut breaded chicken for dinner tonight and I needed something to go with it.  I dug through my cabinet and found a box of plain couscous.  I wasn't sure what to do with the couscous so I searched for a recipe that I thought would go with the coconut chicken.  THIS WAS IT!!!!  I didn't follow it exactly since a box of couscous didn't exactly fit the measurements that were listed in the recipe.  Instead I just boiled a can of chicken broth, added olive oil, couscous, a few shakes of curry powder, a few shakes of dried cilantro, some sliced almonds, raisins & a shake or two of black pepper.  It tasted amazing!!!!!!!!!  I will definitely make this again.  Thanks for helping me use up some pantry items too!!!

Loved it! I used a combination of chicken and beef bullion to make the stock, since I didn't have enough chicken bullion. Omitted the salt as suggested.  Added a can of water chestnuts for some crunchies, as well as a hearty dose of frozen mixed vegetables.  It could use some red pepper to give it a kick, but overall -- super easy and fabulous tasting!  Can almost be a meal by itself if enough veggies are added. I served with a side of grilled chicken with Caribbean Jerk seasoning.

Wonderful EASY side dish. I can throw it together in 10 minutes start to finish and it is so tasty. A nice mild curry flavour. My family loved it!

Loved this dish.  One of the most flavorable couscous dishes I've tried.  Will make this again.  I did cut back a tad on the curry.  My curry I buy from the Indian grocery store is hot.  I'm not overly fond of hot!!  I like a little.

I'm eating this as I'm typing it. I love this recipe! Very tasty! I will definitely be making it again!

8/2/12 Update:

I have been making this several times because my family and I love it. I just made some for a birthday potluck at work today and I got rave reviews yet again. I normally make it exactly as it is written. I use McCormick's Curry and a low sodium chicken stock. Delicious and incredibly easy to make.

I was looking for something super quick and easy to make and this was it.  It tasted wonderful.  The only changes I made were to use walnuts instead of almonds, water instead of chicken stock and I added some craisins along with the raisins.  NExt time when I plan on making this, I'll make it the way it was written. GReat spur of the moment recipe that will be a regular in our house.

Wonderful! If you are a fan of couscous and curry this is your meal.  I only changed two things.  I ran out of curry powder and was quite low on olive oil so I used red curry paste and a little butter.  Worked great and the taste is fantastic.  This is a meal I will be making more often. Quick and delicious!

Love this recipe! It’s not hard to make and I do it by hand. The only two things I’d change would be to reduce the sugar to 1/3 cup and use olive oil for the vegetable oil.

Easy is right and delicious! I made this as an accompaniment to Chef John's Turkish Kebabs. Very nice. This is a simple couscous recipe but tastes like it took some time to make. Thank you for a great recipe. Just lovely.

This is a delicious recipe. I used golden raisins and 1 tsp of salt. I used Herb Ox chicken stock which already contains enough salt. The next time I make this dish, I'll skip the added salt altogether.

This was a very nice couscous!  This would've been four stars, but I deducted one for the salt content.  It just needs about half the amount of salt it calls for (and we are salt lovers, so perhaps if you have a sensitivity to salt you should go with less).  Just the right amount of curry.  Do not omit the raisins; they add the perfect touch of sweetness!  I added caramelized onions and it was excellent.  Such a versatile dish; you can add any veggie you like.

Love this recipe. Very easy to add things to if you want to make it more of a full meal, like a can of chickpeas and some mixed frozen vegetables. Also, I feel like the amount of salt should be cut in half, or perhaps just a little more than half of what it calls for. It can be a little salty. I use vegetable broth because we are vegetarian.

I started cooking a different recipe for quinoa and realized i had cousous. So i combined the two.
Sauted small diced onion, 4 chopped cloves of garlic till tender. Then switched and followed this recipe. Put in chicken broth, lots of curry 3-4 teaspoons, raisins, salt and pepper. Got it boiling. Pulled it off the heat and stirred in couscous. Put a lid on it and let it sit. It came out great! The test will be my husbands reaction.

This dish is SO easy and SO delicious!  I served it to my husband with lamb chops for a meal that has him convinced that I'm a great cook, but the credit really goes to this TERRIFIC recipe.  
I added a bit of  leftover Mississippi roast to the leftovers and the synergy was GREAT!

I have been making this for several years now, and with the exception of eliminating the salt, which most reviewers find superfluous, I follow this to the letter. In a pinch, I will use craisins if that's what I happen to have on hand (which are equally as good, if not better than raisins), and I have also substituted parsley for cilantro. Since there are only 2 of us, I usually cut the recipe in half. It's a very flavorful side dish and relatively quick and easy to prepare. In lieu of plastic wrap or foil, I now use silicone lids, which save on waste! ;)

Very good if you like couscous and curry. I used low sodium chicken broth and a pinch of salt and it was just perfect. Super easy. will definitely make this again. I hesitated on using the raisins as I am not a huge fan of them but they really did add a good flavor and texture to the dish.

Really easy and really simple. I didn't have cous cous, so I used quinoa. As others have suggested, I skipped the salt, added one onion and 2 cloves of garlic. Increased the serving size to 8, so I could use up a whole litre of chicken stock. Would suggest adding the cous cous to the pot after boiling and putting a lid on it. It took at least half an hour for my cous cous to cook through using saran wrap. Should be faster if over the stove. Didn't have raisins and used craisins. Double the amount of craisins. Turned out great. Can add poultry seasoning, paprika for more flavour.
1) Saute the onion and garlic in the olive oil
2) Add curry powder and stir around a little
3) Add in chicken stock and wait until boils (use a lid)
4) Once it boils, add in quinoa and craisins. stir.
5) With a lid, simmer on low for about 10mins (until it looks like it's nearly ready, but still liquid-y)
6) Turn off heat and let the quinoa steam with the lid on for about 10mins. Then fluff up with a fork. Ready to eat.

Family liked it a LOT! A keeper for something easy and extra special. 

I agree that salt should be added as the last step since so many of the other ingredients contain salt.

We mixed ours with peas and carrots, and sprinkled with both (garden fresh) parsley and cilantro.

Ate too much!

Wonderful Recipe! I am just learning to cook and this is my first time cooking couscous. It was simple, fast and easy! It came out a bit too salty, probably because the chicken broth I used has salt. Next time, I will not add as much salt.

I always serve lamb roast and a couscous dish on Easter.  This dish went perfectly with the lamb.  I didn't have enough raisins so I subbed craisins and they worked great.  Also used the low sodium chicken broth and only one tsp of salt and I felt it could have used another 1/2 tsp of it.  It was delicious.  Thank you for sharing.

Absolutely delicious!!!  I think next time I won't add the extra salt though, as the broth I used was apparently salty enough.

This recipe is so easy and has the perfect amount of spice!!  I've made couscous many times before, but this was the first time I had used curry powder mixed in broth BEFORE bringing it to a boil.  That seemed to make a big difference- great flavor.  I added carrots, onions, corn, and sweet peas for a colorful and healthy side dish.

Wonderful!  Don't leave out the raisins, they are amazing.  I'm going to probably double them next time.  This is one of those recipes that I'm going to put into regular rotation.

Loved the taste!! Great for leftovers as well! The curry really makes this awesome. I actually added more curry powder than called for also it was mild curry so adding more was not harmful to the other ingredients and was not too over powering.

Yummy!  This was a fun and easy recipe for couscous with a little different twist.  My hubby really enjoyed the curry flavor; he's a fan.  My son even ate it--though he picked out the raisins (whatcha gonna do?), so it's a winner in my book.  I would definitely make this again and it's yummy for leftovers...hot or cold!  Thanks!  Oh--I substitutes Israeli (Pearl) couscous for a little more substance in this dish.

It was awesome! I had whole almonds and forgot to toast them so I just sliced them and threw them on at the end. Cilantro I didn't measure, just rough chopped and added it too - could leave it out in a pinch. 
Great for leftovers too

This was easy and delicious. I omitted the salt, as my chicken broth was store bought and contained salt. I also added some frozen peas, a dash of cinnamon, and a dash of cumin. It had a great flavor. I will definately make this again!

Was easy and tasted great.  I added more than the recommended amount of curry powder for an extra bite.
At first I did not know what cilantro was, soon discovered it's sold as koriander here in Holland

I really liked this except I may have put a bit too much curry powder in it because it had a slight bitter aftertaste that I am not used to with couscous.  I did add some carrots and didn't have any almonds or cilantro so maybe if I had these I wouldn't have had that slight bitter aftertaste.  I didn't realize how much this made and I am going to have a lot of left overs. I also cut down the oil by about half.  This was a great low cal easy recipe for the hot summer months!

I give this a 5 because not only was it delicious, but so easy to make! I followed the recipe as is for the most part except I added less curry powder than called for (just don't like the flavor of too much curry powder). Instead of slivered almonds, I chopped up raw whole almonds. I also garnished with some diced onion and 1 minced jalapeño pepper. So good, I even ate some as a snack with a spoon of plain yogurt. Would definitley make this again.

Fantastic side dish.  I paired this with the Spanish Moroccan Tilapia dis featured on this site.  Very successful substituting the Chicken broth with Veg broth for my Vegi guests.

We enjoyed this very much.  Even my boyfriend who doesn't normally like couscous OR fruit in his dinner liked it.  I did however only use half the curry powder and only a pinch of salt.  I don't think it would have been edible with all the  curry and all that salt.

This was a great way to fix couscous. Husband loved it.  I added a little more curry, other than that followed the recipe exactly. Thanks
