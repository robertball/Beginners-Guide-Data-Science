I'm making this for the second time this evening; it's a lovely presentation, and very delicious. I'll ease up on the garlic this time and use cheeses I have, which are a Parmigiano-Reggiano*, bleu crumbles (as I don't love feta), and slices of Danish Jarlsberg. I'll serve this with cous-cous and likely another simple cooked vegetable such as carrots or a winter squash soup. 

Things I learned when writing this, my first recipe review:

*What is the Difference Between Parmesan and Parmigiano-Reggiano?

A cheese called Parmesan is essentially a cheese that imitates the recipe for Parmigiano-Reggiano, but is made outside of the approved Italian regions.

This was great. I can confidently say this would be delicious as is, but I did make a couple minor changes. We had shiitake mushrooms we had to use up so we threw them in with the brushetta, put it on crusty garlic ciabatta and topped with swiss instead of fontina. I will be making this again as written. Stellar

My local grocer only had one package of caps left and they were small to medium sized. The mixture EASILY could fill 6 caps- especially if you chop the stems and add them back to the topping mix. I shredded the fontina cheese instead of slicing. ALSO, I DID NOT ADD THE FINAL PORTION OF OLIVE OIL! It was an unnecessary addition of fat and the flavor was phenomenal without it. I will definitely make this again as I prefer veggies over grain carbs. This is DELICIOUS!

Great recipe! Thanks so much. I really enjoyed the flavors that go along with this dish. At first I was looking for something to go as a side dish thinking this would not fill me up, but decided if/when I was still hungry, I would just munch on something else after. After eating though, I am stuffed! Thanks again. Will definitely be making this over and over and over.

I drizzled balsamic vinegar in the mushrooms with the olive oil and I'll do that again!  I used provolone cheese because I didn't have fontina cheese and it turned out great!  I made it a second time with smaller Portobello mushrooms this time and used gouda cheese because I needed to use it up and it was really good that way too!

I love this recipe! It is not easy to find low-carb, vegetarian dishes, but I am proud to serve this one to dinner guests. I usually use shredded instead of grated Parmesan and fresh dill instead of arugula. The recipe seems quite flexible, so you can adjust to what you have.

Substituted spinach for arugula and used gouda. Also cut garlic in half and reduced salt. Dish was to rich for our tastes.

This is so good!  Can't wait to make again! I may use fresh basil in place of the arugula next time.

I absolutely loved this! The only alteration I made was the amount of garlic I added. I scaled it back to 3 cloves instead of 4 and am very happy that I did. It was a great ratio of ingredients & everyone loved this dish! I will for sure be making this again!

I know it's called brushetta,but tomatoes aren't really good yet locally,so I made it without. I add a little balsamic vinegar with oil and put on the grill for 7 minutes,then added cheeses and mustard greens as that's what I have this year in the garden. I've made this several times, sometimes with Swiss cheese,today I used bleu cheese and sharp cheddar.This is one of my favorite recipes.

These are fantastic!  Our store did not have any arugula, so I subbed with spinach and topped with Jarlsberg cheese as that's what I had on hand.  I forgot to drizzle the remaining olive oil over the tomato mixture.  It didn't need it.  I will definitely make these again.
