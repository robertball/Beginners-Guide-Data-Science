The name of this really needs to be changed. It may be healthy, and all natural, but three out of the five ingredients are not allowed on the paleo diet.

Very creative recipe, and it's really good.  But it's not Paleo.  Chickpeas and peanuts are legumes, which should be avoided if you're following a Paleo diet.  But who said you can't cheat?  :)

This to me was an interesting recipe. I can tell you easy and simple. However I didn't like the bold taste of the vanilla for such a small amount of cookie dough but understand it's to mask the taste of the chickpeas but I think the peanut better does a good job at that. I'd make again but use less vanilla(1/2 tsp should be way plenty) & a peanut butter "lower" in oil because these are extremely oily. Best tip I can also offer is pulse and blend your cooked chick peas 1st before adding the peanut butter agave nectar & vanilla...the peas are rather chunky and do not break up well with the other ingredients. These can be a quick fix for that cookie dough need. And kept in the frig a few days.

I left out the agave nectar, and I thought it still tasted great. The texture is quite similar to cookie dough. I'd suggest you let it sit overnight before you start snacking on it; the flavors need some time to meld together. The second day and beyond, the garbanzo bean flavor is hardly noticeable at all. I also tried this with almond butter, which is good but gives the dough a stickier consistency. My blender nearly burned itself out as I was making this recipe; perhaps a heavy-duty one will do the job just fine, but from now on I'm using a fork and my hands.

I really loved this recipe but it needed a kick. I added cocoa powder and some more sweetness to it and it was FANTASTIC that way.

I don't use agave.  I've made this with raw honey or with maple syrup.  Excellent and my dog likes it, too (without chocolate).  I use vanilla that's safe for dogs, too.   :D

I'm not a health fanatic by any stretch of the imagination. I'm pregnant, and I was dying for raw cookie dough!! This was AWESOME. I have no agave nectar stuff, but to sweeten the (unsweetened) peanut butter used in the recipe, I swapped it for a mix of  brown and granulated sugar. YUMMY!!!

I am shocked at how this turned out using chick peas! It even smelled like cookie dough! This would be great stirred into ice cream or oatmeal. Very good recipe!

Super easy to make but food processor definitely is the tool you want to use.  They were delicious and very satisfying especially if you like the combo of peanut butter and chocolate :)

I love the texture and subtle but accurate flavor of this edible cookie dough!!! Nailed it, without the guilt! I might add a pinch of salt next time as the salt with sweet combo is one of the aspects I love most about cookie dough.

I really can't believe how easy and delicious this recipe was?? The only thing I change was the nectar I used honey instead

I didn't have peanut butter so I used maple flavored almond butter. I also omitted the agave and added cocoa and some stevia.bFor the chips I used stevia sweetened chocolate chips. Even my picky teenager liked these!
