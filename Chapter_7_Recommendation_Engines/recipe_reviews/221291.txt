LOVED THIS! I have to say that this wasn't the prettiest looking guacamole, lol, but it sure was tasty! Made exactly as written, no changes needed...great blend of flavors and could not have been easier. Will be making this often! Thanks for sharing. :)

So glad I found this.  I didn't feel like going to the store to pick up a mix.  Had all the ingredients so I thought I would try.  No more mix for me...this is wonderful!  I'll be making this one from now on.

So good and so easy! I used fresh minced garlic and added a little salt and it turned out great!
