Absolutely delicious!  I used a can of diced tomatoes with jalapenos instead of using fresh, a can of diced green chiles and yellow onion.  I ended up sautéing ½ a yellow onion and the garlic, and then added the tomatoes, a can of diced green chiles, broth and spices until slightly reduced and thickened.  I then added the black beans until warmed through.  Yum!

YUMM!!!  I loved this recipe, never before thought to melt the cheese between tortillas first (versus using just tortillas).  Love it and love the chipotle chiles, they add extra kick and smokiness.

This was excellent!  My fiancé has been begging me to make huevos rancheros for him, and this came out just like he hoped it would!  I did use store-bought salsa, though, and scrambled my eggs with cumin and cilantro instead of frying them, which gave the dish some extra flavor.  Used chili powder (maybe 1 T?) in the beans instead of the chilies (it was all we had), and they were great.  Thanks for an awesome recipe!

A spicy, hearty way to start the day! Great for the weekends when you have more time to spend on breakfast, although this would be great for dinner too. It's very filling - if you have this for a lazy Sunday breakfast you won't be hungry again until dinner! Plus, you will almost need a nap after breakfast. ;-) I made two changes. 1) I poached the egg to make it a little healthier. 2) I mashed up the bean mix a little bit. My beans were too liquidy, but mashing them fixed the problem. My measurements may have been a little off, because I adjusted the serving size to '1'. I think the egg/bean/salsa layers would be good on on top of hashbrowns too. I might try that next time if I didn't have tortillas on hand.

Quick, easy, and awesome. I never imagined that egg + black beans would taste so good! I used my own canned salsa instead of making the pico de gallo. I've never cooked with chipotles before (though I've eaten dishes with that flavor in restaurants so I knew I liked it) so one canned, finely chopped, came to a bit over a teaspoon. The rest I laid out on waxed paper to freeze (and store later), and I froze the rest of the adobo sauce in a small container. Actually, in retrospect, I might freeze the sauce in ice cube trays, as it seems like a little bit would add nice complexity to sauces.

My husband is from Central America and he loved these. He says it's one of his favorite meals I make. I haven't had the time to try it, but the only thing I can imagine making it better is fresh black beans. Not worth  the extra work to me, but my husband would prefer it so if you're making these for someone of latin descent, you might want to  make theblack beans yourself.

So disappointed! This took a long time to make and was not very good. There needs to be a LOT more cheese than just a half a cup. I didn't understand the point of adding chicken broth to the beans. It made them watery and I ended up straining them again. The salsa was good. This wasn't terrible, but just didn't feel like a cohesive dish. My boyfriend suggests maybe sandwiching the egg between the tortillas? I don't know, I won't be trying this again. Thanks anyways.

Great recipe! It is a little time consuming. I made the salsa and beans at the same time, and then I assemble and cook the eggs as needed. This is my lunch this week! It is so good! New favorite, I think. I had it for lunch and dinner today!

Delicious!! I make this quite often, I use whatever kind of cheese I have on hand. Last time I made it with mashed pinto beans with equally good results as the black beans.

These are SUPER!  Did as someone suggested and put them over hash browns since I had no corn tortillas.  A real winner.

Very good. I used jarred salsa and  should have followed the recipe and used fresh. I would also suggest topping with the hispanic goat cheese (sp?) and placing under broiler for 1-2 minutes for a browned, cripsy finish. Love teh black bean mixture- so much better than refried beans.

Very yummy! We used store-bought salsa instead, and it turned out great.  We melted lots of extra cheese on top.  Next time will serve with sour cream.  Thanks for a great, easy meal!

Great recipe.  Cooked our eggs sunny side up and the runny yolk added just the right flavor and moisture to the dish.  IMO the fresh cilantro adds just the right touch.  A simple keeper.  Thank you!

I used all of the ingredients in the recipe but adjusted them a bit according to personal taste. I'm not a fan of Heuvos Rancheros, but Husband is, and he said this was absolutely the best he's ever had. Because I made it super spicy (two jalapenos and three huge chipotle chiles in adobo sauce), I drizzled a little sour cream over the fried eggs, then sprinkled some fresh cilantro over that. AMAZING! I'll definitely be making this again. Thanks, ZZ!!

Great recipe. Having lived in Mexico for a number of years, this took me back to some of the great breakfasts I had in the Yucatan Peninsula. The most time consuming part of this recipe is making the pico de gallo -- but other than that it is fairly straightforward and simple. I chose to leave out the garlic and it still turned out great.

Seriously the best breakfast meals I've cooked. I had lots of leftovers from shrimp tacos that I incorporated into the dish. The shrimp added to the bean mixture and cilantro/lime sour cream out it over the top.

This was very good. I'd been wanting to try this for a long time and I had an open can of chipolte peppers to use up, so now was the time. The only changes I made was to add half a small onion in the beans and store bought salsa. Yum! I think I'm having this for breakfast tomorrow.

This was really good, but a lot of work -- I ended up using three skillets.  My husband thought it was too spicy for breakfast, but I loved it.  Thanks.

My family really enjoyed these!  The tortillas didn't quite crisp up enough in the oven so that was are only "complaint."  We didn't have chilis or jalapenos, which would have made this recipe perfect!  All in all, a delicious meal!

This recipe is a staple for all meals for us.  You can omit the eggs and just have it as soft tacos and use any cheese you want. Use just enough broth to keep the beans moist.  Nothings better than Black Beans in our house.

Absolutely awesome. The chipoltle chiles in the beans added a nice/unique flavor. I made sure to mash a few of the beans while it was simmering to thicken the texture. Hands down the best huevos rancheros I've ever had. :)

One of our favorites! I used a can of black beans in spicy sauce and omitted the chicken broth. I also left out the jalapeno in the salsa because I have one that doesn't like things too spicy.  I think it would be better with it. It also cools very quickly so I assembled everything and left it in the oven while I fried the eggs. Such a delicious and hearty breakfast!

Great recipe!  Wonderful tip on heating the tortillas with the cheese in between makes the final assembly so easy. I also like to serve with some avocado slices along side. Very filling, one per person is plenty.

Wonderful!!!  I added a few good shakes of chili powder to the salsa, but otherwise didn't change a thing.  My guy who doesn't care for black beans, asked that I make his with re-fried beans.  Told him we were out and he just needed to eat it if he was hungry......two bites into it, he asked me to make him a second one!  Really good and easy recipe.

Super tasty and easy (at least when you cheat and use jarred salsa). Big hit at our house.

This was great. I used pre-made fresh salsa to cut down time. My only other changes were using 2 eggs/plate and I topped each dish with 1/2 sliced avocado, a dollop of sour cream, and freshly chopped cilantro.

Very tasty. Do not forget the lime. Alterations included: used dried cilantro spice instead of fresh, olive oil instead of canola oil, and canned green chiles instead of the chiles in recipe list.

Tastes great! Next time I may pan fry the tortillas before melting the cheese between then for a little crispiness. I should have made my salsa earlier to give more time for flavors to meld together. But it still was a lovely breakfast!

I liked this recipe, but it was a little bland. I would suggest adding more chili in Adobo sauce and a little more jalapeno. I would also put a lot more cheese between the tortillas, or just use one tortilla. More cilantro, both in the pico de gallo and sprinkled on top at serving, would add a lot more flavor.

This makes large servings so I ended up saving half and having it the next morning for breakfast. It really was better the next day. If you nuc it at half power for 2 minutes, it will be warm and the yolk will still be runny. In the future, I would make both the pico de gallo and the bean mixture the day before I was going to use it.

Perfecto!
Every ingredient was needed to bring out the full flavor.  I used a can of diced tomatoes with green Chili's and peppers because I wanted the tomatoes to be softer (blanched). Suggest you strain the juice if you do this. The lemon juice is enough liquid. I used a slotted spoon to plate the sauce over beans just in case . I also simmered black beans with chili until the juice was reduced to a thicker consistency. It holds onto the tortilla better as well. I didn't want to heat up my entire oven so I melted the cheese between the tortillas in a large pan, flipping once. 

I often place my ceramic plates on a low heat burner to get them warm so food stays hot while serving plated dishes. I did that here as well. It kept the tortilla and cheese nice and warm. 
I would recommend serving this dish with a bottle of tobasco sauce on table for extra spice lovers.  I served it with sliced avocado to add add one more flavor that made it perfect. 
I have travelled the world enjoying Huervos Rancheros and now I can make it at home as good as any I have tried abroad. 
Well done my amigo. Gracias!!

We liked this! I only used one tortilla each and sliced boiled eggs rather than fried, but we will make it again. Nice use of fresh tomatoes, peppers, etc.

GREAT EASY. I know from experience this is filling for a Sunday lunch then not hungry for a usual supper. I made as is for a 
supper with some left over potatoe salad and was very enjoyable. No need to change anything.

Great ingredients for a good flavor in this recipe.  Melting the cheese in the oven could easily be replaced by warming in a skillet.   I added chorizo and wished I'd had cilantro and Avocado on hand too.  It turned out really nice.

Delicious. I made very minor changes with technique, and omitted the chipotle due to personal preference. This is so quick, fresh and nutritious. Everyone approved. Thanks for the great recipe!

Loved the beans. Worth it for this part alone. Could be used in lots of dishes.  Not sure why anyone would say this took a long time to make. Look at it. Very quick and simple. Definitely worth a try.

Made recipe as directed, great starting point but we will make several changes next time.  We will not make the salsa, instead we will use green chili which we like more.  Instead of chipotles we will use diced green chilies and we will add sliced avocados to the top as well.

Loved this recipe! Would cook the tortillas longer next time so they're crispier. Also used red chilies in the black beans as I did not have the ones called for in the recipe. Mixed a little cayenne and cumin with the salsa as this is one that we make regularly. Delicious!

I used canned salsa I made a few summers ago.  I also used flour tortillas because that is what we had.  I "fried" the tortillas in a skillet sprayed with coconut oil.  I didn't have chipotle chilies so I used a teaspoon of taco seasoning instead.  Yum!

When I first tried this recipe, I may have overcooked the beans a tad. And I didn't understand the concept because it seemed like the beans just rolled off the tortillas. So the next time I made it I had an epiphany and made the beans the same, but I then threw the mixture into a blender and (after allowing some time to cool), blended the mixture along with a little sour cream and more chicken broth (if needed) to create a thick black bean sauce that I then pour over the egg and tortillas, then put the pico de gallo over the top. I really didn't change any ingredients, but changing the form of some of the components really made it work so much more for my tastes. I get rave reviews on this recipe when I make the black bean sauce, which makes this a five star recipe at that point!

I reduced ingredients by a fourth to make a single serving. In the interest of expediency, I did not do the beginning part of the recipe and instead used Pace in place of the homemade salsa. As a result, I was able to make this in under 15 minutes. Made the black beans while the tortilla was heating up; it really was easy to make and was delish! I'm sure it would have been even better had I made the homemade salsa, but it seemed like too much work for one serving. Will try again!

Pretty tasty.  Spouse suggested more cheese melted on top. I found tortillas a little dry.  Cilantro in salsa is a must.  Think I'd also like it better if diced red onion were substituted for green onions.

I followed this recipe exactly and it was delicious. As others mentioned, the beans were a little runny at first, but because I had to let them sit for about 1/2 hour and then reheat, they absorbed much of the liquid leaving a nice, thick, tasty sauce. Next time I make this dish (and there will be a next time) I will make the beans first and let them sit while preparing the salsa, etc. and reheat just before serving. Great recipe.
