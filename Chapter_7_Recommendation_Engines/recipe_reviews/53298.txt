Absolutely fabulous; loved this recipe, was so sure I would be missing the familiar much lovde tastes of traditional cheese or oil fondue, wich I do so love. But no, this much healthier version dose not disappoint. All the fun and flavor of traditional fondue without all the guilt.I doubled the spices as well as the wine as others had suggested and was not disappointed but I neglected to strain the wine spice mixture before cooking, not a problem until near the end when the wine had cooked down quite a lot and you did come into up close contact with the spices (in your mouth) not good. In the future I maylet the spices simmer with the wine for some time but would try to strain them out befor too long.
   I made this for a friend after a long day at work; she came over for a glass of wine and was so suprised and delighted.
   It was so easy I was almost embarrassed, we had shrimp,scallops,chicken,green pepper, onion and mushrooms to cook.Evreything was good but the shrimp jumped out as the star, plumped up by the wine it would literally burst in your mouth with an unexpected explosion of flavor.I only purched a handful of each at the local supermarket on the way home. The scallops were also tasty not at all rubbery, but next time I will buy the larger size.Next in prefence were probaly the mushrooms also magnifing and compounding the flavors.The chicken was good but did not compare to the seafood. I would recommend this recipe to evreyone.

Nice fondue recipe! I used a Chardonnay that I found for $3.50 (haha) that was great for cooking! I was worried it was going to be a little strong so I added a cup of chicken broth (not the low sodium kind) and omitted the salts. I also added some crushed garlic, a spring of thyme, and some chopped parsley. Versatile recipe. The alcohol is definately strong at first. Let it boil a bit if if you'd rather it cook out a bit. 
I used this with chicken strips, shrimp (they cook fast!), sea scallops, and mushroom. YUM.

this was good. It surprised me it's not something I would normally cook but chicken cooked this way was delish and save the leftover fondu and freeze in ice cube trays to flavor stews or soups. thanks marc

We liked this very much.  We have been dieting and really wanted to do a fondue for dinner--most are so fattening though.  This was light and pretty much guilt free!  I served whole grain bread on the side and dipped that in as well instead of using butter--that was REALlY GOOD!  Make sure you season your meat!  Will be making this one again for sure!

This worked out very well for my family.  Much better than the old oil fondues.  I set the wine on fire to burn off the alcohol,  I have a 9 year old and a 13 year old.

I served on Valentine's day with shrimp, chicken and brussel sprouts.  We drank the same wine with dinner and all flavors were awesome.  Great recipe.

I thought it smelled wonderful, I only gave it 3 stars because I thought it was a lot more work and $$ than using broth.  And I don't think that the seasonings added a lot to the fondue.

This fondue recipe is a keeper!  We used it to cook chicken and shrimp and it was preferred over the vegetable oil that we normally used.  A bonus is that it smells wonderful while simmering in the fondue pot!

I have made this twice for fondue parties and it is a hit!  I find it is best with mushrooms; my non-veggie friends like chicken.  It takes a little longer to cook things than oil fondue, but your extra patience is worth the flavor!

This is an excellent fondue for a main course and much healthier than oil.  I left the spices in and had no problems.  We also added more wine after the first round had cooked down and we were still eating - works just fine.  My favorites for this are scallops, shrimp, mushrooms, zucchini, chicken and potatoes (in that order).  The seafood is amazing!

This a wonderful alternative to traditional peanut oil fondue. I served this at a dinner party with mushrooms, onions, green peppers, shrimp, chicken, and lamb. Although everything was yummy, the onions and lamb stole the show.  One problem that we ran into was that once the food started cooking, the water level in the fondue pot was not high enough (I think this just depends on how deep your pot is), I put a can of chicken broth in the pot and we were back in business. Overall awesome way to fondue! Thanks!

On taste, this was five stars! On quantity, it wasn't enough. Maybe we just have a big fondue pot, but we poured it in, and it wouldn't even cover a piece of food! So we just added another half bottle of wine, and it was fine. I'll definately be doubling this next time.

Oh so very good!  I made this for an at-home date night with my husband using beef and shrimp with the "Beef Fondue with Sauces" recipe from this site, as well as a sweet and spicy chili sauce that came with the fondue pot.  Based on others' suggestions, I made a double batch, which was good, because we were able to keep adding the fondue as it cooked off.  I love that this was so light, so easy and so tasty.  Much better than just hot oil or even a cheese sauce

Really good wine fondue. One batch was not enough and it evaporated quickly. Next time I will at least double the recipe.

I had a wine fondue party and used this broth with chicken, scallops, filet and schrimp.  I will definately do this one again.  I also used some sauces for dipping, but you could skip them if you like subtle flavors.  I also used a chardonnay wine (2 buck chuck) which worked great!

Awsome, would make this again in a heartbeat!  we did shimp and scallops and a variety of fresh veggies (mushrooms, peppers, snap peas scallions).  It got even better as the wine cooked down, more intense flavor.  I did need to double it to get the volume for the fondue pot.  Be sure to use wine you would want to drink.

I doubled the recipe and made it for a group of 6. Everyone enjoyed it!!  It was very tasty and much healthier than an oil fondue.  We had it with chicken, scallops and shrimp.  All 3 tasted great cooked in the wine!!!  Thanks for a great new recipe.

This was great!!! I took it to a fondue party and I got rave reviews! I did let it set for a little more than an hour. I got busy doing other things. I think this only served to help the flavor.

Tried this for a dinner party and it was a huge hit! We thought it was especially delicious with shrimp.  Tip - double the recipe and add extra wine or chicken stock if it's going to be served for a long period of time - the wine alone will evaporate fairly quickly.  Making this again for Christmas Eve!

This is a fantastic recipe! The only problem, which turned out to be quite a big problem, was that it wasn't enough. I had fondue for four people, including shrimp, scallops, broccoli, green peppers, mushrooms, and onions. It wasn't really that much food, but I ended up adding another half bottle of white wine directly into the pot because there wasn't enough broth to cook with. Even that disappeared quickly and we ended up crafting a red wine broth right in the pot for the rest of the food. I would definitely make two bottles worth of the broth and have some extra waiting just in case.

This was a terrific fondue. Used electric fondue dish so the wine sauce (which was delic) evaporated quickly so I added beef and chicken stock to continue the fun (no other changes)...delic and good conversational dinner... used beef fondue with onion-horseradish sauce from Beef fondue with Sauces from this site...this is definitely a keeper!

This was AMAZING.  We started the Valentines evening with a cheese fondue and then followed up with this.  It was delicious!  We served shrimp, scallops, steak, mushrooms, onions, peppers, summer squash, carrots and broccoli.  I loved the scallops and the muchrooms but everything was bursting with flavor and wonderful.  It will be on our regular rotation!

It smelled great while cooking, but it made the chicken way too salty.

I had been searching for a vegetarian fondue recipe for a party and everyone loved this one. It was sooo good!!  The best part is that I already had all the ingredients.

This was absolutely delicious!  We had chicken, shrimp, scallops, carrots and mushrooms (we also tried broccoli, but it did not mix well at ALL).  The carrots and chicken seemed to best absorb the flavor.  If you don't have a fondue pot, just use a crock pot at the highest setting - we did it, and it worked just fine.  I followed the advice of other reviewers and doubled the amount of wine and spices (except the salt - I only used a single portion  of salt and garlic salt, and then plain celery seed (3/4 of the amount of celery salt called for) and a crushed garlic clove).

Best fondue recipe we've ever had!  We had friends over for New Year's Eve and everyone loved it. Beef tenderloin chunks were the best, scallops and shrimp picked up a hit of cinnamon and the chicken was fabulous. We had a swiss cheese one going as well for veggies.  Great meal, low in cals, and our house doesn't smell like oil this morning.  We followed the recipe to a tee.  Thanks for posting!

The only thing i had an issue with was the amount it created.  I would reccomend doubling or trippling the recipie.  I made this for my boyfriend and I for his b-day and ended up adding mojo sauce to it because there was not enough liquid.

Excellent! I used a little more than half a bottle of $4 chardonnay and filled it in with vegetable broth. Didn't have celery salt or coriander, but it was delicious! Shrimp was amazing,mushrooms were great and even beef wasn't bad. Very good way to spend a low cal evening

Excellent!  We used beef tenderloin, chicken and veal.  It was all delicious.  Try it with the sauces from the "beef fondue with sauces" recipe on this site.

Traditionally my family has always fried things when fonduing. When I went to college I wanted a healthier, tastier way to cook with fondue and this is the real deal. Loved it!

A bit strong at the beginning, but mellowed as it cooked. Our fondue pot set the wine on fire twice which made for some entertaining moments. Mushrooms cooked in the wine were wonderful.  We used Chardonnay and cooked scallops, shrimp, pork tenderloin, beef sirloin, chicken breast, broccoli, potatoes and mushrooms. Also made a curry sauce, cocktail sauce and lemon-garlic sauce to go with the meal.

I thought this was great for the seafood but didn't work as well for the veggies.  The veggies soaked up a LOT of the wine flavor and it was overpowering.

This fondue is wonderful!  I doubled the recipe so that my larger fondue pot would have enough in it and it worked great.  We dipped beef tenderloin, shrimp, scallops, green peppers, brocolli, red onion, cauliflower, and mushrooms. I would make this in a heartbeat.  I have never strained something in cheesecloth before but that is super easy.  I also used a very inexpensive ($3) bottle of Pinot Grigio-Chardonney wine. Delicious. I made it for 10 people (we also had a broth fondue) and it was plenty.

Truly excellent, especially with shrimp.  I used ground spices since that was what I had on hand, and didn't take the time to let it sit.  I appreciate carla29's suggestion to save the leftovers.

This was good.  Next time, I will probably double the spices as, like the other reviewer, I didn't feel they added a lot to the recipe.  It was a nice treat to have fondue, though, especially when it was easy as this!

I thought this was an easy recipe. There four of us and we enjoyed it. I did read the comments before so I did double up on everything and I am glad we did as we dried up just at the end of dinner. I used purchased a bottle of woodbridge chardonnay for this recipe.

The idea is nice, but the flavor was weak. We added 2 tbs of salted butter and several cloves of garlic and liked it much better.

This recipe is amazing! The chicken was so flavorful;no dipping sauce needed. I didn't particularly like the shrimp but I'm not a big shrimp fan. 
I needed to double the recipe to have enough broth to cook our food in a 3 quart pot. I used pinot grigio and it was great. Definitely worth spending ding the money on the spices. I've had 2 people ask me for the recipe because they loved it too!

Very delicious, very simple - even the kids enjoyed it!  We will definitely fix this again.  We used a cheap bottle of Chardonnay and added some broth as one of the other reviews suggested.  The next night we stir-fried the (few) leftovers - also tasted great!

We had a fondue party last night for friends and used this for beef, shrimp, and mushrooms and it was delicious! I would not change anything about it. I was a little worried when I brought it to a boil b/c it smelled a little off but tasted delicious!
Thanks so much!

There isn't enough stars for this recipie.  It is easy and tastes so fabulous.  I combine the cooked results with various dipping sauces and it is one of our families fav meals.  It is a very tasty light and healthy broth for shrimp, chicken, steak, and veges.  We are slow eaters so usually suppliment the broth with a little chicken stock as it evaporates off.  A definate keeper just the way it is.  Beats any of the broths we tried at un-named chain fondue restaraunt which were over seasoned for our tastes.

This was a good recipe. When making the recipe I ran into a couple of hiccups.  First: I didn't have a cinnamon stick, so I used about 1 tbsp of ground cinnamon.  Second: I didn't have garlic salt, so I used 1/4 tsp garlic (that was chopped and dried).   My last hiccup was - since I didn't have the proper fondue pot I cooked the chicken in the wine mix on the stove until ready then I strained and served over jasmine rice.

What a waste of a fillet and scallops.  Boiled steak is just not a good idea.  Tangy vegetables not very good either.

This recipe does not make enough for  a standard fondue pot, so beware!  I will say, I was disappointed by how little this made - barely a 1/2 inch deep in my standard fondue pot.  I went through all this work letting it sit for a few hours then boiling it and straining it, only to realize that we couldn't cook anything in it because it wasn't deep enough!  We added extra wine and chicken broth to fill the fondue pot.  

I really liked this though.  We cooked chicken, scallops, shrimp, sirloin, zucchini, mushrooms, and broccoli in it.  I have to say, the unanimous decision for what tasted the best in this broth was the broccoli!  I am not a big broccoli eater, but it really tasted amazing in this broth.  Everything else was good too, but the broccoli was the clear winner (I even had to put more out because we scarfed it down!).

Fantastic change to oil or cheese for fondue. I used a Chardonnay for the wine and brought to a party with friends. We used primarily to cook chicken and vegetables. It does cook down as you are using it so make a double batch and add to the pot as needed. My friends loved it - I've already been told to bring more next year!
