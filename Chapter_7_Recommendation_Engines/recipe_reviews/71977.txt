I'm giving this recipe 4 stars as it is. With these changes I'd say it's 5 stars. I've made this bread 5 times now. It does need more cardamom, 1 tsp works well. I also use less flour, about 2 3/4 cup. And I use 1 tsp of salt. I learned that the hard way. The first few times I made it it would fall in the middle, then I researched bread making and I learned that the salt keeps it from falling in the middle. Now I love making this bread and giving it as gifts, it's really delicious.

This bread is wonderful. I tripled the amount of cardamom and used 1/2 cup less flour than called for. This bread is aromatic, tasty, and perfectly risen. I baked it in the bread machine, and it is a beautiful loaf. It has a nice, crunchy crust.

I made this using my KitchenAid mixer, and found that I'd made a mistake dumping in all the flour called for, it could have used maybe as much as half a cup less. It was way too stiff, and the resulting loaf wasn't as light as I prefer.  I made some deep slashes in the dough before proofing in the pan, and after baking, brushed all over with butter.  It was a very pretty bread, and the flavor was simple; mildly sweet.  But the cardamom didn't show thru like I'd hoped.

Excellent, light, moist texture. I made 12 rolls. On the advice of several reviewers here I doubled the cardamom, and I feel it was a mistake to do so. That much cardamom gave it a medicinal taste. Perhaps it was because the bottle of cardamom was brand new, so it was more potent - don't know for sure. Shame on me - I should have followed the recipe as written the first time, since I believe that subtlety works so much better in bread products than in-your-face spice does. As written, this recipe is most likely just about perfect.

I made 12 rolls and baked them for 22 minutes in a 350 oven. I could have taken them out at 20 minutes. They got a bit too brown. These were crusty on the outside, which is good, but I thought they could use a little bit more salt.

Worked out pretty well. Maybe needed a tad less flour. I added a full tsp cardamom and probably could have even gone stronger. Mildly sweet and good with carrot and leek soup.

I used 2 tsp. freshly ground cardamon seeds  which gave it a nice aromatic but not overwhelming flavor - very good texture and taste.

love the recipe, but would recommend the tangzhong method of keeping the bread fresh and moist.  Tangzhong method is 1/3 cup bread flour cooked in 1 cup water on stovetop stirring until ripples become visible and it thickens just slightly.  refrigerate with plastic wrap covering top directly and use the next day. 1/2 of tangzhong batch per 1.5 lb loaf.  use in bread machine and add with liquids.  note: will need more flour but leave it just a little sticky for a moister bread.  it should also help preserve the bread naturally so that it stays fresher.  many websites on the internet have the tang zhong method of breadmaking.  it was discovered by the Japanese but chinese tea houses use it all of the time.  Try it -- if you want look it up on the internet for more information on this method of asian bread baking.  this method should work with any kind of bread using mostly white bread flour.  would recommend making slightly sticky dough in a bread machine and then shape and bake in regular oven.

Excellent bread. Only change I made was baked for 30 minutes instead of the 40-45 in the recipe as the top was already past a desirable browned point. I might add more cardamom next time if I intend to use it as a "sweet" bread. The way it is, it will be perfect for salads---or French toast, as noted in the recipe.

This bread is outstanding and has a very nice sweet taste without being overpowering.  I increased the cardamom to 2 teaspoons as suggested in other reviews, but the next time I make this bread I will add 3.  In addition, I made the entire bread in my breadmaker, but it stuck to the bottom.  Next time I will spray the bread pan with a non-stick spray; this is the first time that sticking has ever been an issue, but it was not surprising since there is no oil or "fat" to speak of in the recipe.  I'll definitely make again!

A tale of two breads.I posted 2 pics of the two breads. The 1 on the left was made in a Sunbeam,the 1 on the right was made in an Oster.Both were made on the suggested settings,and with 1 1/2 tsp cardamom and 2 3/4 c flour. I accidentally reset the Oster,it went through a 2nd kneading.I think that's why it rose so high.That loaf also had a crisper crust. Both were delicious.I have a food blog that I posted larger pictures on.If you are interested in taking a peek, Kitchen toys make cooking fun.

Holy cow that's some great bread!  I substituted maple syrup for honey, doubled the cardamom (as most reviews recommend), and substituted freshly mushed up pear for applesauce (it's what I had).  Otherwise I did as instructed with preparing the dough in the bread machine then baking in a loaf pan.  Loaf rose well, was fluffy and soft and moist.  Even with the cardamom doubled, it could have used a touch more, though I would be cautious to not overdo it if you're serving it to unsuspecting folks.  Can't wait to give these away as holiday gifts!

Something that people may not be aware of: Ground cardamom loses its flavor quickly, but whole pods retain their flavor for a long time.

If you aren't getting the flavor you were expecting, maybe it's time for a fresh bottle of cardamom??  A little goes a very long way if it's fresh.

This is a  nice semidense loaf. I added extra cardamom but as I use whole cardamom it is hard to say how much. Every thing else is just right! We will be making this all the time. Very good with white chocolate marzipan spread on it.

This is a good recipe with some of the suggested modifications.  First: as to the amount of flour.  If you sift the flour first, then 3 cups are the correct amount.  You should always do this when baking bread unless you are using the euro method of weight which is much more accurate. If you do not have a sifter, King Arthur recommends pinching the bag shut and vigorously shaking it then sprinkling into a cup measure one T at a time. Second: as to the cardamom.  I used a heaping tsp freshly opened and it was certainly not too much. Third:  I used 1 tsp salt as others recommended.  I might try 3/4 next time.  Fourth: Since the recipe calls for no oil, the only source is the egg and the milk so I used whole milk and if I were to use lowfat milk I would put in a T of melted butter.  I used the dough cycle made 12 rolls let them rise 30 minutes coated with an egg wash and baked 20 minutes @350.  I enjoyed them warm with hot chocolate in the Danish tradition. A thin sugar glaze with a couple T lemon juice might be nice to perk them up a bit.  Thanks for a fine recipe.

Very easy way to make a meal special.  Followed directions as written except to increase the salt to 1 tsp.  Some reviewers favored using 2 3/4 c. flour instead of 3.  I initially tried doing that too, but ended up adding the 1/4 c. of flour back in as my dough was pretty sticky.  Made into rolls instead of a loaf.  Will definitely make again.

This is a great recipe. I've tried putting in 1/2 whole wheat and 1/2 white flour and it's also very good, but doesn't rise as  much. I'm going to do as other reviewers suggest and try just letting my machine mix the bread and then cook it in a pan in the oven. I don't think bread machines get the crust right. I've also tried plain white flour versus bread flour and really find no difference in the end result.

This is very good.  I added a little more cardamom than called for--did 1 tsp total, and a bit more salt.  Very delicious.  Baking and rising  times are spot on, too.  Thanks for sharing!

I wish this had turned out for me.  I didn't read the reviews and I wish I had.  It was too dry.  Needs less flour than what was called for.  I also had trouble with it rising.  I didn't warm up the milk and maybe I should have.  It was heavy and dry.   I don't know if I'll try it again with a few modifications or not.

This is good bread - but I don't think the Cardamom flavor is strong at all. Anticipating that, I doubled the amount and still couldn't differentiate it. We liked the bread, but it wasn't quite what I was looking for, and seemed very similar to any other bread recipe.

This was simple and delicious!!  I only baked it for 30 minutes and it was very well done. I also added extra cardamom and used normal applesauce.  It's delicious warm with a little honey!!

This bread has a very good flavor.  Very good texture, however I will set my machine on 1# loaf next time.  It got a little dark on the 1 1/2# setting.  Also, the bread was hard to get out of the pan.  Maybe because of the applesauce instead of oil.  I might try these as rolls next time.

I didn't make this in a bread machine I did it the old fashioned way. I didn't find there was too much flour like others commented and it was perfect for French toast.

This is so delicious! I just followed the suggestions of other reviewers and used 2 1/2 cups flour and 1 1/2 teaspoons cardamom. I love it!

I did not make this in the bread machine but thought it was great. The alterations I made were minimal such as proofing the yeast (adding water and sugar) and double rising it.  Then baking in an oven about 45 minutes at 350.  I also buttered the top about 35 minutes in.  The bread was a bit heavy but delicious. Would definitely make again.

I really like the bread, I have it as toast and also made French toast with it. I did increased the cardamom to 1 tsp and salt to 1 tsp as others recommended and this amount is right. I used 2 cups bread flour and 3/4 cup whole wheat flour, and a little bit of ground flax seed mixed into the 3/4 cup (about 2-3 Tbsp). It fully cooked in the bread machine on light.
