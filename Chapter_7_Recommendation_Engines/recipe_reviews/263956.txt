the chicken was very tender.   I cooked the pasta while the chicken cooked  since we were in a hurry and served it as a side dish.  Very good!

I used boneless chicken thighs and the family loved it, but I did have a problem with the rice mode option on my Instant Pot.  It did not allow me to adjust the timer to be less than a default of 14 minutes.  As a result, the chicken got a little burned on the bottom of the pot. Lost about 1/2 a thigh worth of meat from it being stuck and was a pain to cleanout.  

I made it a 2nd time using my dutch oven and the results were as tasty, but the pasta needed an extra cup of broth.

I used 4 bone-in chicken thighs since that is what I had on hand. This worked just fine. I did have trouble with my pasta at 3 minutes on the rice setting. I let it come back up to pressure and left it for another 3 minutes. I am sure each Instant Pot is different. The flavors were great! I served with some fresh tomatoes on the side and some added them in. It is a very filling meal with a wonderful pesto flavor!
