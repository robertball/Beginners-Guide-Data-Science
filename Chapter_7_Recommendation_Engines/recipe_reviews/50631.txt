These were of course a little bit different texture than store bought because they don't have all the white flour and white sugar, but they are still tasty and so nutritious, it's great that they have so much oatbran, the combination of that and the fruit gives them lots of fibre and vitamins.  I followed the recipe exactly and got a fairly stiff batter which made 16 muffins using the large size muffin liners.
We also made another batch substituting 1-1/8 cups of mashed banana instead of the applesauce (make sure you measure it took 4 large bananas) and we added chocolate chips instead of the blueberries and believe it or not they were even better, I know that the chocolate chips are not as healthy as the blueberries but if the kids like them, they still have lots of fruit and fibre from the oatbran and banana so I feel they are still a pretty nutritious snack.  We will definitely make them again maybe even try almond extract with  fresh cherries and shaved almonds, these muffins make a nice breakfast treat especially good if you are rushed because they can be eaten on the go, just bring along a milk box or a coffee and you're all set.

I used this recipe to make a bread, rather than muffins. I made a few changes: I substituted mashed banana for applesauce, used 2 real eggs instead of substitute, and sprinkled whole oats on top rather than granola. Baked for 50-60 minutes at 200C/395F, it turned out great -- nice and moist. I think next time I might mix in walnuts with the pecans.

I wanted to try these because they seemed pretty low in fat and have a decent amount of fiber, but I was worried about how they would taste. They turned out very moist and have good flavor. I used 1 1/2 cups of applesauce and didn't have blueberries so I substituted dried cranberries. I think blueberries or raspberries would really make these better. Also, I found that 18 minutes was too long to bake, try 15 minutes instead.

Oh my goodness! These are absolutely fantastic - even my picky husband has devoured them!  I doubled the recipe and got 30 muffins, not 24.  I also substituted whole wheat flour, and sprinkled just a little brown sugar on top instead of the granola.  Wow!  Even a few days later, these muffins are just as moist, tasty and melt-in-your-mouth as when they were first baked.  We froze the majority of them to have a quick breakfast on hand.  Just defrost overnight in the fridge, and throw them in your toaster oven or mircrowave in the morning.  Definitely beats skipping breakfast!

I have made this recipe quite a few times but have amended the original slightly, following the advice of previous reviewers. I used no oil and substituted with 1Â½ cups of apple or banana (I have used both), rolled oats instead of oat bran (next time I will use only one cup because they do have an oaty flavour which I would like to reduce slightly), two eggs, wholewheat flour. I added more cinnamon and also a touch of nutmeg and ginger and didn't use any nuts. This time I used frozen raspberries and bluberries and they were lovely! They taste healthy and of course they are not as light as fatty versions, but they taste great!

I have made these muffins twice.  The first time I used unsweetened apple sauce and the second time I used sweetened.  Also, the second time I increased the amount from 1 1/8 cup to 1 1/2 cup.  This made a huge difference.  The second batch was so much better.  They were delicious actually.

I changed the recipe around a bit and they had a great flavor.  Even my pickier friends said they were fabulous!  Instead of oat bran, I used 3/4 cup rolled oats and 3/4 cup wheat flour, and for egg substitute I mashed up half a banana.  I also didn't put anything on top and I took out the nuts.  The texture was a little dense, but they still tasted light.  An excellent vegan recipe!

These were very good - I followed a few suggestions and made the following changes though: half white flour, half whole wheat; two real eggs instead of egg substitute; and added one mashed banana.  I don't have a food scale and had some difficulty figuring out the amount of chopped pecans it called for.  I put in half a cup, and I think it could stand to have even more added.  The two year old and the thirty year old both devoured them though, nice and moist, not too sweet!

I thought these sounded very good, but I decided to make a few changes.  I substituted 1/2 the flour for whole wheat flour and added a little more applesauce.  I used 2 whole eggs instead of egg substitute, added some lemon zest and a little of the juice as well.  I also left off the granola but sprinkled just a touch of brown sugar on top.  Yummy!!

We didn't have the egg substitute so used one egg instead.  Sprinkled a bit of brown sugar on top as we were out of granola and used whole wheat flour instead of white.  We also didn't have any pecans.  These muffins are GREAT! My three boys were disappointed that I had cut the recipe in half and only made 6 .. next time I'll know to make the full 12!

These were really disappointing. I was excited because of the good reviews. I used 2 eggs instead of the egg substitute, whole wheat flour and almonds instead of pecans. So no major changes. The muffins were lacking flavor and I should have known they would be a little dry due to the batter being extremly thick.  I'll continue to make the Blueberry Zuchinni Bread from this website instead, its much better.

I was looking for a healthier alternative, and decided to give this a try.  They turned out moist and flavorful.  I used half cake flour and half whole wheat flour for a little more fiber.  I also used blueberries and blackberries, just because I had some fresh blackberries I wanted to use up.  My blueberries were frozen, so I reserved a couple of tablespoons of flour and tossed them with the berries.  (It keeps them from turning your dough purple and sinking to the bottom.)  I didn't have granola, so I pulsed 1/3 cup pecan halves, 1/3 oats, 1/3 cup brown sugar in the food processor and topped the muffins with it.  Very good and I could feel great about feeding them to the family.

EXCELLENT! I made a few changes to the recipe:  I used: 1 cup oat bran and 1/2 c. rolled oats, a dash of ginger, 1 1/2 tsp. vanilla, 1 egg instead of egg substitute, 1 banana instead of oil, and 2 cups of blueberries. I also just used brown sugar for the topping. Thank you so much for this recipe! I just made it for the first time and cannot wait to make it again! It's at the top of my list!

I omitted the pecans in the batter and instead sprinkled them on top with a little bit of brown sugar (instead of the granola).  I also used 1/2 cup of whole wheat flour, and the rest of white flour.  These turned out delicious - moist and flavorful (not to mention pretty healthy)!  Thanks for a great recipe!

As written I only give this four stars but with a few modifications I think it is a 5 star recipe.  I wasn't crazy about the texture when I used as much oat bran as the recipe called for.  So in place of the flour and oat bran, I use 1 cup each of oat bran, whole wheat flour, and oatmeal.  I also replaced the 1/2 c sugar with 1/3 cup honey and left out the nuts.  For the topping I used oats, chopped almonds, and just a little brown sugar.  

Thank you for a great base recipe that I was able to modify to my own preferences!

This is an excellent recipe! I've made these twice so far, once with fresh blueberries and once with fresh raspberries.  They were great with the blueberries, but if you can get ripe and fresh raspberries -- they are heaven!  My 3 year old loves them too. I make them using 2 eggs instead of the substitute, and sprinkle the top with a little brown sugar and a few nuts instead of granola (I use walnuts instead of pecans because that is what I typically have on hand).  I use some non-stick spray and put them directly into the muffin tin, they come out easily each time, and they also freeze really well!  I look forward to making seasonal versions of this muffin with other fruits and trying them with frozen berries in the winter as well. Easy and healthy and hearty breakfast paired with a container of yogurt!

I've always liked bran muffins, mostly because they're pretty healthy.  But now I found this one!  It has so much texture--love the nuts.  I use walnuts because we have a walnut tree.  I used wheat bran because the store didn't have oat bran.  I used frozen blueberries--so much flavor with them.  I used 1/2 wheat flour once and they tasted the same--just healthier.  They were moist and delicious!  I've had lots of friends asking for the recipe.

Very tasty!  They are moist.  My son said they were too healthy for him to eat - as he shoved a second one in his mouth. LOL!  I will be making again.

I'm always looking for healthier versions of my favorite pastries. This one is a pretty good healthy alternative! Substitutions: used white whole wheat flour instead of AP flour (I found it at Trader Joe's), added 1 1/4 c. of applesauce, and 2 eggs instead of the egg substitute. I didn't add the granola on top, but I thought the muffin was good as is! Great recipe!

These are excellent, especially for a healthy muffin.  Much better than I thought they would be.  I followed the recipe for the most part, using ground flax seed as the egg replacement (2 tbs. flax + 6 tbs. water), whole wheat pastry flour instead of all-purpose and I added 1/2 teaspoon apple pie spice.  The batter was really thick so I splashed on a little almond milk to moisten it up.  Also used muesli as a topping, and finished each muffin with a raisin on top.  They were done at 18 minutes, like the recipe says, and have a wonderfully light yet moist texture with a balanced, mildly sweet taste.  I'll be making these a lot.

These taste a little too healthy for me.  I'd add a bit more sugar and maybe even beat the eggwhites and fold them in to make the batter lighter.  They are OK, but that's all.

I forgot to put the cinnamon in and found that you can taste the bitterness of the baking soda. I thought there seemed like too much when I was making them but the high bran content might need it? Otherwise pretty good. I'm going to try different kinds of applesauce in this. I think I'd like some of the flavored ones with a little more sweetness. I used unsweetened and thought they could be just a tiny bit sweeter to balance the heavy bran and point up the fruit. Blueberries are not very sweet so it seems to need a boost to the flavor. Honey might be a good replacement for the brown sugar to bring a tad more moisture. The heaviness of the bran seems to need a little more oven time and so the outsides get kind of dry in the time it takes to cook the middle properly. I found the 18 minute time to be accurate for two tins of 6 each.

These were excellent.  I made them for friends and family and everyone loved them.  I did not have oat bran, so I followed other reviewers' suggestions and substituted wheat bran.  They were delicious.  I added 1/4 cup chopped walnuts instead of 1/4 ounce, since this amount seemed very small to me.  I'm making them again!

This recipe turned ouy great but I did make a number of changes. First I only used 1 cup of oat bran and I used 2 cups of whole wheat flour instead of 1 1/2 cups of all purpose flour.Next I reduced the baking soda to 1 tsp. and the muffins still puffed up nicely.I reduced the salt to 1/4 tsp. and instead of the oil and apple sauce I increased the conola oil to 1/2 cup and made up the difference by adding 1 cup of no fat yougart. Like a previous commenter I used 2 eggs instead of the egg substitute. Lastly I increased the brown sugar to 1 1/2 cups. I found that 18 minutes was not enough bake time so I added 2 additinoal minutes.  I will definitely make these muffins again. r

These are great just as is, and they are also easy to modify.  I used grated apple instead of applesauce.

These are great - especially since they are so healthy! I subbed 1 TB of flaxseed and 1/2 cup of unsweetened applesauce for the oil and topped them all off with streusel (1/2 C brown sugar, 1/2 C oats, 2 tsp butter, little cinnamon). I didn't have any bran so I soaked a little All Bran cereal in skim milk and mixed it in with the wet ingredients instead of the dry.  My only issue was removing the muffins from the pan. I only used 1 cup of blueberries but they must have sunk while baking and ended up making the bottoms of the muffins too moist to remove from the pan.   That said, they tasted great!

Love this recipe.  It's healthy and still tastes good. The muffins are moist and not too sweet. Substituted 2 eggs for egg subst., mashed bananas for 1/2 the applesauce & used twice the cinammon and vanilla.  They're delicious with or w/o nuts.

This is an AMAZING base recipe. I've tried all kinds of variations (ex: fresh cherries in place of blueberries and almond extract instead of vanilla OR shredded carrot & raisin with rum extract to name a few). Can't thank you enough for posting this keeper!

Tasty but a little dry for my hubby. I substituted 2/3 of the whiete flour with whole wheat so that could account for the dryness. I didn't have quite enough oat-bran so I topped it off with ground flax. Doubled the cinnamon and used 2 whole eggs.  I do like the flavor and will make them again.

I'm not typically a fan of bran muffins, but these were surprisingly moist and delicious. I used blueberries straight out of the freezer and extended the cooking time by about five minutes, and they turned out perfectly!

Changes I made are: 3 cups of a combined whole wheat flour with oat bran, 1 cup of applesauce and 2 bannanas, 1 C strawberries, 1/2 C Splenda brown sugar blend, 1/8 C Splenda White granulated, 1 egg plus 2 egg whites, 2tsp cinnamon and 1 tsp allspice. I's add more spices next time. No granola topping. I went to Calorie King to figure out the calories the way I made them because they have a good size and are dense so I was guessing 300 Cal but discovered they were only 200 CAL and 3.7g of Fiber. I will make these many times using varying the fruit.

Mmmm. Mmmm. Good. Moist, flavorful, and not too dense. As someone suggested, I used two whole eggs instead of egg substitute. Everything else the same. Unlike a lot of muffin recipes, the batter fills the muffins tins to the tops. It is probably a good idea to use muffin liners, as I did not and the blueberry juice went syrupy during cooking and kinda stuck to the edges at the tops. I used a knife to circle around each tin and gently pull out each muffin.

I made these muffins trying to get the most "bang for my buck" in terms of nutrition into my 15-month-old picky eater.  He loved them as did my 34-year-old processed sugar lover husband!  I rate the recipe as stated, but I did make two changes: I replaced 1/2 cup of white flour with 1/2 cup of whole wheat flour and I did not have any cinnamon on hand so put a dash of allspice in.  Fabulously moist and sweet.  I will definitely make these again!

I was loooking for a recipe to use up some All-Bran in my cupboard, and this was a very good, basic Bran Muffin recipe.  I also used up 1/2 cup of a dry fruit mix (golden raisens, cranberries, cherries) instead of the other fruit and nut ingredients I didn't have.  
I loved the texture and taste.  Only reason I gave 4 stars not 5, was because they seemed to dry out in a day when stored in air-tight container, but this may be because of my dry-fruit substitutions.  I would definately try this one again.

After reading all the reviews for the recipe, I went out to buy the ingredients I needed.  I was a little disappointed in the flavor of the muffins. I am addicted to a whole grain blueberry bran muffin from a coffee shop near my house, so I have a taste I am trying to achieve.  I did think this recipe called for maybe a 1/4 cup too many blueberries. I've made different recipes with a cup, and this was half over.  I also used 1 cup of all purpose flour and the remaining half using whole wheat flour, it's possible that combination ruined the flavor? They are not bad but I am not sure why mine didn't turn out the way the other reviewers claimed they would be...

These were great, I served them at a playdate. They were a good healthy snack for the kids. I put in dried  blueberries and a cut up apple and I replaced a half cup of all purpose flour with whole wheat pastry flour. Next time I will add a little more cinnamon and salt. I really like that these are not too sweet.

These muffins have a great texture.  I made them pretty much as is, adding a little of this and that for flavor.  Will be making this again.  Oh yeah I made them with whole wheat flour, no problems.

This has become a favorite recipe.  Makes a surprisingly light muffin with a great crumbly texture and it warms up well in the microwave without becoming plastic-y.  I have changed my version slightly to include 1/4 c. chopped walnuts (for the pecans) and skipped the granola topping.  (And a few extra blueberries doesn't hurt it at all.)

My husband is trying to lower his cholesterol so I was searching for oat bran recipes. I have made this twice. Once I used all banana (trying to use up ripe bananas) instead of applesauce, and the other half banana and half applesauce he likes the combination. Thanks so a great recipe.

I ended up using this recipe so many times, using the base ingredients as the base of my recipe and switching up which fruit I added in.  My favorite was adding craisins and walnuts (and I want to try orange zest with that next time!) and dicing up canned peaches or pears (or even fresh pears or apples) and baking those in too.

These were so great! The best bran muffins I've made yet. I used wheat bran instead of oat bran (since that's all I had in the house) and 2 eggs instead of the egg substitute. I didn't have the nuts or granola so I left those out. And I used half blueberries, half raspberries. I made all of these changes because I was too lazy to go to the grocery store, but I'm sure they would've been great as written too. Oh and I baked them at 350 instead of 400. It made 16 large muffins for me.

This was a good recipe for bran muffins, but lacked some flavor. I substituted two eggs for the egg substitute and put fruit and nut granola on top. Delicious!

This is a great, simple recipe. I didn't have applesauce, so I used about half a can of pumpkin puree instead. The batter was super thick so I added some buttermilk to thin it out. I also didn't have baking powder so I just used baking soda. It was great with frozen blueberries and chopped walnuts, and I left off the granola topping. Great way to get lots of nutrients in my diet, and my husband loves these.

This recipes is ok.  I followed it exactly and I think it turned out as it was supposed to.  The end product tasted dry and bland.  There was no sweetness to it at all.  It was definitely healthy.  I might try reducing the bran and mixing in bananas.

I LOVE this recipe!  These muffins are soo good and soo healthy.  They are the best when they are fresh out of the oven, but they are also good later.  My husband likes to pop them in the microwave for a bit and put a little butter on them.  Delicious!

They're easy and healthy. I did not put any topping on them and used blackberries instead of blueberries. The blackberries were a bit too juicy. 15 min is all they needed.

Pretty good. I used blueberry yogurt instead of the applesauce, and used 1.5 cups. Also used walnuts instead of pecans. Very good, earthy flavor.

I love this recipe!  It's a great recipe to experiment with.  I switched the blueberries for cranberries and nixed the nuts and they were so good.  I've also put in mango instead of the blueberries.  I love the fiber in these--plus they're delicious.  They don't taste as healthy as they really are.

These were delicious!  I used half whole-wheat flour, a little more applesauce than called for, and only 1 egg and mashed a banana for more moisture.  They turned out great!  Next time I'm going to try dried cherries, slivered almonds, and almond extract as another reviewer suggested.

In the words of Rachel Ray, "YUMMO!!" I used 2 real eggs as suggested by another reviewer & I made them in jumbo muffin tins. They are not as heavy as I expected them to be. This is a keeper!

We really enjoyed these muffins!  My kids liked the cakelike ones I made better but I thought these were very yummy.
We used wheat bran instead of oat and skipped the granola topping.

I did not have Oat flour, so put quick cooking oats in the blender to make some. Everything else was used per the recipe. We enjoyed these with butter, and they were sweet enough with the 1/2 C of brown sugar.  This made 18 small/regular muffins, so I froze some.!

I made a half of 6 muffins so I cut the recipe in half; the  muffins were absolutely delicious. Also made some adjustments (for 6 muffins, not 12): 
* 1 egg instead of egg substitute
* 3/4 cup of apple sauce (my first time I used only 1/2 cup; that was too dry) 

but overall great recipe

VERY Disappointed as I felt there was very little flavor.  I reduced the white flour and added  1/2 cup wheat flour to give added flavor to be more healthy, but it didn't help.  Seemed to be very bland.  I also used rolled oats which were supposed to be OK.  Will not use this recipe again.
