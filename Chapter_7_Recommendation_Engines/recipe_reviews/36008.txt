I was disappointed in this drink.  It sounds really refreshing and fruity but it tasted like NiteTime cold medicine to me. The chambord was a $38.00 disappointment.

I used cherry vodka instead of strawberry & raspberry & I increased the Sprite. I didn't float a full jigger of chambord ...just enough to top it off. I'm a martini kind of gal so I poured mine into a chilled martini glass. Thanks for the kiss, Ken...I enjoyed it!  ;o)

Wish I'd read Susan G's review before I tried it.  It tasted worse than cold medicine.  We tried everything & it was finally drinkable after an addition of Bailey's.  Now what do I do with Strawberry & Raspberry vodka?

Good stuff. I prefer to use only raspberry vodka, and club soda instead of Sprite to cut down on the sweetness. Can't ever go wrong with Chambord, in my opinion! :)

This was a tasty one.  We had it for brunch and it was terrific.  I did this recipe as a part of the Western Region's Faceless Frenzy July 2012.

Not horrible, but not that great either.  IF you don't like the flavor of vodka this isn't the drink for you, I added some pineapple juice to balance it out a bit!

This recipe is too sweet. Need something more than a lemon-lime soda to counter act the sweetness. I will not be mixing this drink again.

Very yummy... couldn't find strawberry vodka so used raspberry and pomegranite instead.  Served in a martini glass.  Beware... these go down easy but have an extreme kick!
