I give it 3 or 4 stars as is - as soon as I read it I knew what I would do different.   I was looking for a broth based soup and not a cream soup and this was good!  I chopped half a large onion and minced 4 cloves of garlic and sauted in a large sauce/soup pan.   Added Old Bay to our taste and then added the broth once it got going.   Added rice to broth, then 1/2 bag of shredded carrots, at the end added 1/4 fresh chopped parsley and 2 chopped green onions (great colors in this one) and then added the shrimp and cooked a few minutes more until they were pink ( cut them in bite size pieces - easier to eat with a soup spoon).  I see I omitted the lemon juice - didn't intead to, but I just forgot it.  I will make this again.  Old Bay really gives it more depth of flavor.  Served with hot crusty garlic bread.

This was very good! My hubby really enjoyed it. I added more lemon to it to give more flavor. I also added some carrots and yellow and orange peppers to it. It's been added to the rotation.

I made this soup for my family, and I made it a little too salty, but it was good nonetheless.  I'll use it again.

Not bad, I made quite a few changes though. Heated garlic, ginger, onion and Cajun seasoning in the pan before adding broth. Added broccoli, beans, and shredded carrots for veg, and still felt it needed more flavour. Over all will make it again. Continue adding flavour and veggies. I also think it would be good with vermicelli noodles.

The recipe doesn't include the lemon juice listed in the ingredients.....I assume it goes in with the shrimp and garlic?  Going to try it tonight and add some broccoli and carrots as well!
