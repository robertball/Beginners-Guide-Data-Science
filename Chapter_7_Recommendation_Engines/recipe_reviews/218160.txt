I love peanut butter and bacon sandwiches...so this looked interesting to me.  Really nice combination of flavors, easy to make and something different and unexpected to serve guests.  Not exactly low cal....but, as a party treat, we will splurge every now and then.

I really wanted to love this- I mean, bacon? peanut butter? cheese?  What's not to love?  The combination - is what.  The combination of these came out heavy - it felt a little greasy, a little heavy.  I wanted another flavor in there - something bright to counteract the heavy flavors of the pb and bacon.  I'm not sure what that flavor is - but for us it's a necessary counterpoint to the heaviness of the other flavors.  That being said - it IS bacon - and so, that automatically makes it better than any number of things that Aren't bacon.   :-)
