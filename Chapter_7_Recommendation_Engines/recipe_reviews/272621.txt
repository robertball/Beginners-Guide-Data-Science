It had a good flavor, but I guess I just don't like spaghetti squash.  The squash had the texture of al dente angel hair pasta (which I also don't care for.).  I'm sure it's just a matter of taste on my part.  My friend tried it and liked it.  I sent the rest of it home with her to share with her Mom.  Sorry.
