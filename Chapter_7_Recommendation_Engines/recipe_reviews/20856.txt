I have made this recipe over and over and over, and everyone RAVES about it.  I do add a few extra cloves of garlic and have been known to use hot sauce in it from time to time.  I also have used low fat cream cheese and mayo and it is still excellent.  Thank you!!!

I love this dip best when baked as suggested, and with twice the garlic..mmmm! it's the best!!  I'm addicted to the stuff, and have even taken to making it on the weekends and serving with good quality crackers as part of lunch.  It's extremely quick and easy to prepair, and made without the extra garlic, my kids love it, too!

This was the hit of the party!  I left out the bell peppers and the green onion b/c I didn't have them on hand.  I also split this into two small dishes, so I could put out one at a time.  I put them in the oven for 15 minutes to warm through, and they came out with a beautiful golden top.  Served with crackers, and people couldn't get enough!

I served it cold because I was looking for a recipe to avoid turning on the oven during the summer.  In place of the temperature heat, I added a couple of teaspoons of hot sauce to the recipe to give it a zing and it did the trick.

It was good.  Not too complicated to assemble.  I didn't have any green onions so I just added a few extra dashes of garlic powder.

a really nice dip.  Everyone loved it, and it was gone in no time.  Tastes much better heated.  I added an extra layer of shredded Swiss cheese and also some cracked black pepper to the top.  A colorful dish with a nice mixture of flavors although a greasy and heavy appetizer.

Great recipe!  I added a little more cheese and then added the juice from the jar of artichokes to give it a little more flavor.  Then I added salt and pepper.  I am taking this to a party so I won't, but I believe adding tobasco sauce would be awesome to add a little kick.

I was looking for an artichoke dip recipe without parmesan cheese. I tried this one, but since I didn't have all the ingredients I changed it up a bit. I used monterey jack cheese (instead of swiss) and sweet onion (instead of green) and omitted the red peppers. I also added some salt, pepper and a couple of dashes of tabasco sauce. I heated the dip in the oven at 350 for about 15 min. It turned out pretty good. I would double the garlic and add a few more drops of tabasco next time.

I couldn't find marinated artichokes anywhere in my local grocery store so I used a 14 oz can of whole artichoke hearts.  I halved the yellow bell pepper I had on hand as it was HUGE and I had concerns it would overpower the dish to be 'Uncle Howe's Favorite Bell Pepper with a bit of Artichoke Dip'.  I also sauteed the onion, bell pepper and garlic a bit just to make sure nothing overwhelmed the artichoke taste.  After letting it sit cold in the fridge it tasted too much of mayo, so I tossed it in the oven as the description above states.  SO MUCH BETTER.  I added a dash of nutmeg, pepper AND lemon pepper then I topped it with more Swiss cheese before finishing it in the broiler.  The dish was all but licked clean.

My family LOVES this dip- I like to double the garlic- for an extra zing! Very easy to make.  I made it for a party and had several friends and family ask me for the recipe.  This dish is now at every gathering we have- Thank you!

This recipe is just easiest and the yummiest! I accidentally made it without marinated artichokes, and even that was okay. Definately give this a try!
