My family loved it! It was definitely a restaurant quality dish. I substituted evaporated milk for the cream and added some Parmesan cheese to the sauce during cooking. Fresh tomatoes, fresh basil, and shredded Parmesan garnished the top. We will be making this again.

I tried this last night and it was very good! I did kind of wing it when it came to ingredient amounts. The only thing I may do differently next time is add in a bit of chicken stock to make it a little less rich. I also added way more than the 1/2 cup of cream, just because I was afraid it wouldn't be enough sauce for us and I'm glad I did. There are a lot of possibilities for the recipe. It would be great w/ chopped tomatoes on top.  
Thanks for the recipe!

This was pretty good however it does need twice the sauce. We used bacon instead of pancetta. And it was still good!

I used extra cream as another reviewer suggested.  Also extra garlic was a must!  This is a great base recipe and would be really nice with any combination of other vegetables added if you wanted.  It was so quick and easy to make...I'll make this again. Thanks!

Stunningly delicious.  Truly beyond the ordinary pasta side dish. Smooth, velvety rich, uniquely flavorful and elegant comfort food.  So good it was memorable.  Be sure to save some of the pasta cooking water to moisten the pasta if it absorbs too much of the sauce.  And don't be afraid to add more cream if necessary. Served this with Caper Baked Chicken and Marilyn's Green Beans Italiano, both recipes also from this site.

Excellent; very much restaurant quality, as has been stated.  I doubled the heavy cream and cut the pasta in half, so the sauce to pasta ratio was a little better, and added a bit more Italian seasoning and garlic, but other than that it was by the book. I will definitely be making this again.

Pretty good - I made this because I bought pancetta by accident, thinking it was bacon, and realized when I started cooking it that it wasn't going to go well with scrambled eggs.  I wouldn't say this recipe is outstanding, but it was a good way to help use up pancetta.

Besides using some of the pancetta grease to saute the mushrooms, didn't change a thing.  This is awsome.

A good recipe one can put together without alot of work. When using dried mushroom, reconstitute and then add to the recipe. They will be like fresh when done that way. Would be good enough to serve in a fine restaurant.

This was absolutely delicious!!  My husband had 3 servings and said it could quite possibly be the best thing I've ever made.  My kids loved it too!  I came across this recipe because I had cream and bacon I needed to use up and this was perfect.  I used regular bacon because it's what I had, cooked it in the microwave (crispy) and just crumbled it in when I was mixing it all together at the end.  I doubled the sauce and I think that's a must.  There can't possibly be enough without it unless you use half as much pasta.  I also threw in an extra 1/2 tsp. of basil and added a package of shortcuts chicken to make it a more complete meal.  Some garlic bread on the side and it was a hit!  I'm already looking forward to the leftovers for lunch.

Everything we love (pasta, bacon and mushrooms) in one dish! This was prepared and on the table in under 30 minutes. I used what I had on hand - linguini in place of the penne, bacon for the pancetta and added 1 seeded and chopped Roma tomato at the very end for a little freshness. I also used half baby bella and half white mushrooms. Freshly grated Parmigiano Reggiano put it over the top. My only complaint is that if I had not prepared 1 1/2 times the sauce, it would have been too dry for us. Flavorful comfort food that will prepared often. Thanks for sharing!

I just loved this recipe!  I did add more of the cream to make it more saucier, and it came out GREAT!  I didnt have the Pancetta but used some left over pepper salami, proscuitto left over from a family gathering, and it turned out very very tasty.

A very easy, very flavorful dish! this seriously took like 20 minutes and most of that was waiting for the water to boil. Very pleased with the results, I will be making this again!!! The only suggestion I have is if you are thinking of making it with whole wheat pasta, I wouldn't. We made it with whole wheat penne and the sauce was not think enough to cover the slightly grainy texture. I also threw in a can of drained Italian diced tomatoes, really gave it a nice sweet kick.

This was delicious. There's no such thing as heavy cream up here in Canada, so I used whipping cream. It didn't thicken up though, so I just put a little flour in a bowl and whisked it with some cream and then whisked that into my sauce in the skillet. It thickened up beautifully and turned our perfect! I will definitely be making this again. Thanks for the great recipe! I added a picture of my finished product, check it out. :D

Super awesome! I used 1/2 pkg. bacon, which I just threw in the food processor after cooking b/c I'm lazy. Also added peas and 1/2 red onion, which I highly recommend. Sauteed the sliced onion in with the mushrooms and cooked the peas until water just begins to boil, and added at the very end. Peas are the perfect addition, in my opinion.

This is one of our family's favorite recipes!  We fix it often.  We do prefer a more delicate bow-tie pasta to the penne, and I add a shallot just before the mushrooms and a teaspoon or so of salt to the sauce at the end.

I came across this recipe on September 22.  I've made it three times so far....that's how easy it is and that's how good it is.  My husband and I eat out quite a bit and at some really good Italian restaurants.  This recipe is every bit as good as any of the dishes I've eaten at these restaurants.  I accidentally left the grease from the panchetta in the pan the first time I made it so now I stick to that I also add some chopped sun-dried tomatoes to give it a bit of a kick.  My mouth is watering just thinking about it again.

Made this for my family last night and it was met with ho hum's.  They complained that the sauce wasn't flavorful enough and that there wasn't enough of it.  I substituted regular bacon for the Pancetta and Angel Hair for the Penne.  I also doubled the amount of liquid that the recipe called for and it still wasn't enough.  If I were to make this again, I would probably add some white wine, butter and some salt to the sauce to give it a bit more pep.

This is a good, basic, recipe. I usually ad a cup of light cream and throw in some fresh, chopped coriander right before removing from stove. It gives it a bit of a tang.

I have since made a few substitions: I use regular bacon instead of pancetta, increased the amount of Parmesan, and used our standard 1% milk rather than the heavy cream (yes, I had to add a little thickener to get the sauce to just the right consistency).  I cook the bacon in the oven, just because it's so much easier that way, and then move it to paper towels to drain off that excess oil. 

I sauteed the garlic (maybe there was just a tinge more than a tbs of minced garlic this time :)  ) first, then added in the mushrooms and bacon, cooking the mushrooms until they had softened.  Today was the first time cooking them in that order - I liked it.

And at the end, I put slightly less Italian seasoning than the recipe called for.  The first time I'd made this recipe, I used the full amount, and my husband said that it overpowered the dish.  Since then, I've used maybe slightly more than 1/8 tsp., and it's worked out well.

We love the mixture of flavors and textures!  All in all, a great recipe - thank you!

We really liked the smoky flavors of this dish!  Easy to cook and inexpensive.  I sauteed some smoked sausage in a bit of the bacon grease.  After the mushrooms cooked down, I added some fresh tomatoes with the garlic.  I let the cream warm to a simmer then I added the meat to the sauce.  So yummy!

This is my 11 year old son's favorite (all recipes) meal thus far.  Simple to make - would not hesitiate to serve this for guests. Used a couple of shakes of oregano and basil for the Italian seasoning.  I was a bit concerned at first that I did not a enough sauce for the penne - it was perfect.

Not sure if I missed something but I found it very bland...for all the fat & calories I was disappointed. I used bacon for lack of pancetta. I would recommend adding chopped onion, more garlic, and black pepper for flavor. 1T of butter is plenty if you don't wipe the pan off after the bacon.

Just like the other reviewers said, this is as good as a restaurant dish.  Double the sauce, as others noted, and make plenty...the seconds and thirds for this dish went all around.  Will be making this often!

Very good, fairly easy pasta recipe. Buy the pancetta as it does make a difference. Added the extra cream as advised. Also topped with fresh tomato, basil & parmesan ~ Yum! Will make this again.

Followed the directions exactly as written.  Added back a tbsp of the cooked pancetta when I added the cream.  Really easy and quick dish to serve up.  My wife loves it.

This recipe is fabulous!  Unlike many others who are so bent out of shape when people change recipes, I happen to LOVE reading cooks changes because I know that it's adaptable to doing so!  I read all the reviews and made this with what I had on hand.  Thanks to others, I made this using bacon, added onion with the mushrooms, doubled the sauce and made the sauce using SKIM milk! Yes, 'skim' not cream!  I thickened it with a bit of flour (mixed with milk first to make sure it wasn't lumpy) and added it to the sauce.  I also sprinkled a bit of parmesan cheese into the sauce while cooking.  I'm absolutely sure it's an excellent recipe exactly as written but it was especially good being able to make these changes.  Thanks everyone who took the time to review and leave your comments... for me, that's valuable information!

This is a simple, but elegant recipe. I only made 1 substitution, a can of condensed milk instead of the heavy cream, as another reviewer suggested. I have an abundance of fresh, sliced mushrooms and went searching for a recipe to use them. So glad I came across this one, it's a keeper!

Easy and yummy! I basically doubled everything except the garlic and noodles so that I would have enough sauce for our liking.  I also added some of the Parmesan cheese right into the sauce.  Might add some peas next time or chopped tomatoes to give it more depth.

We all thought it was delicious, my only issue is that it called for a little less cream sauce than we would have liked.  Other than that, terrific, and easy recipe.

This is very good, almost gourmet-like. I like the saltiness from the pancetta. I used angel hair pasta. I also added a small amount of the pasta water to the sauce. Instead of heavy cream, I used what I had on hand, evaporated milk, and it worked fine.

Great recipe.  Great flavor.  Followed the recipe except for butter.  It didn't need the extra butter.  As soon as the pancetta was browned, threw in mushrooms and garlic, and added the cream, tossed in whole wheat pasta and parmesan and it was good to go.

I made this for someone who was visiting from another country.  Unfortunately, I didn't get to taste it myself, however, they did report that it was "very good".  I didn't get the impression that they were just saying that to be kind, it seemed that they really enjoyed this pasta.  So, some day I will make it for myself!  I'm guessing the rating should be...4 1/2 stars.

Had little time and this recipe was quick and easy.  Didn't have pancetta on hand so..I used a pound of bacon instead, used 3 containers of mushrooms and added frozen peas. I poured the sauce over the pasta and crumbled bacon on time.  Very good!

This has excellent flavor, however 1/2 cup of cream was not enough. I used 1 cup. This helped to cut the saltiness from that much pancetta and parmesan and helped the overall flavor of the dish. Very good. Thanks for sharing!

Couldn't find pancetta so substituted 'hot' as in spicy prosciutto. Also followed the advice of other reviewers and doubled the sauce. It was divine.

Simply wonderful. I did make quite a few necessary alterations. First, I used 1- 16 oz. pkg. of farfalle noodles. Then I increased the pancetta to 6 oz. & butter to 1 full stick. Next I used I full pkg. of whole mushrooms sliced & 8oz. of frozen peas. Then I doubled the minced garlic to 2 tbsp. & added 3 Tbsp. diced sun dried tomatoes. I also proceeded to add 1/4 cup sliced green onions and 1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley. Also wise to give a good sprinkling of Italian seasoning & freshly ground black pepper. Now because I increased so many ingredient quantities, it was also necessary to increase the liquid, add 1 - 16 oz. carton of heavy whipping cream. Heat on med. to med high heat until thickened and bubbly. Add cooked & drained noodles and mix well. Sprinkle with 1/4 cup shredded parmesan cheese and stir. Great to accompany with Caesar salad & Italian style bread. Serious Fricken YUM here! Will most likely serve 6 - 8 hearty portions!

Excellent base recipe that can be tweaked to individual taste.  Definitely needs more sauce, like most reviews, we doubled it.  To our taste we added:  1/2 large shallot, 1 large grilled chicken breast, 4 small seeded and chopped tomatoes and about 5 large fresh basil leaves chopped.  Yummy

I liked this dish, but was disappointed that the flavor of the pancetta didn't come through. I think I'll use sausage next time.

This recipe was amazing!  Like everyone else said this needs more liquid...once I added the parmesan it soaked it all up. I loved it though and this recipe will be a constant in my house.  Thanks!!!

My family loved this recipe!  I read some of the other reviews and agree that it needed more liquid.  I did mix the 1/2 & 1/2 with some 1% milk which was fabulous.  I used 2 small cans of sliced drained mushrooms and then threw in some frozen organic spinach to make it a bit more healthy (there was a little more liquid due to the frozen spinach).  I also liked the crispy pancetta that was added (original recipe didn't suggest when to add it back into the recipe so I added it where I thought best!).  Will be making this again soon!  Thank you for a great recipe!!!

This was absolutely wonderful. I used a Gluten-Free penne pasta and less cream/butter and it was delicious.

Delicious! I gave it 4 stars because the quantities are off - waaay too much pasta for the sauce, so I had to not use quite a bit, which means we will have pasta tomorrow also :) But if you use maybe 8oz of pasta and make the sauce as written, you will love it!

This wasn't bad...but not very exciting either.  Added boneless skinless chopped chicken thighs and extra garlic.  It was still bland.  Needs chicken stock to make more sauce and a lot more seasoning. Won't make again...

Wonderful, simple flavor and easy!  Only made a couple "measurement" revisions to original recipe:  I used only 11 ounces of Penne as I like to make sure my pasta is not dry.  I used a good heaping tablespoon of garlic as we like it, and I doubled the amount of Italian seasoning since it was the only other seasoning.  I mixed the Parmesan cheese into the pasta mixture at the end so that it would blend with the sauce.  Delicious!  Everyone, including picky 5-year old, loved it.  Will definitely make again.

I used Italian sausage (because I had it) and this was wonderful. I added more cream (well, half & half) as others had suggested. This is a great basic recipe that lends itself to improvisation! Thanks!

I made this last night and we all loved it. Like others I didn't have pancetta so I used bacon and sour cream instead of heavy cream, and I added a box of chopped spinach. I think the next time I make it I will triple the sauce.
