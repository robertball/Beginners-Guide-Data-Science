This is a pretty good base, but I think what the reviewers are generally looking for is the taste of egg drop soup from a chinese restaurant. To get that flavor, you need to add a few drops of sesame oil.

I had tried another egg drop soup recipe that called for soy sauce and vinegar and I liked this one better.  I did double the eggs and green onions.  It was soooo awesome and a huge hit!

Fast and simple recipe. This soup is tastier than the ones served at Chinese Buffets -- it doesn't have a "yolky" flavor. For improved flavor, you may want to use bouillon broth (instead of canned broth) and add  1 teaspoon soy sauce and 1/4 teaspoon sesame oil. == TIP: to make long, not-so-thin egg laces, make sure the beaten egg is not frothy prior to pouring it in a slow, but steady stream in the boiling broth.

I use pretty much the same recipe only what i do is i will add the white part of the scallions while the soup is cooking and then save the greens to garnish once done, also add a teaspoon of soy sauce to bring the flavor out really well, little pepper goes well too.

Overall this was a good base soup to start with, needed some extra flavoring. We added ginger and green onions to the soup.
Also needed to at least a full 3tbs of cornstarch to make it as thick as my local resturant. Will make this again

I'll give the recipe the benefit of the doubt, because the other reviewers said it was good.  But, as I learned, DO NOT use egg substitute (i.e. better than eggs).  I cannot begin to explain what the broth did.

This was a quick and easy lunch for me, but I don't think it tasted anything like our local chinese restaurant soup. I also used two eggs and some of my own seasonings to jazz it up a bit. I'll make this again for myself, but I wouldn't serve this as part of our family dinner.

I followed the advice of other reviewers and made the following changes: Add ~ 3 drops sesame oil, a splash of soy sauce, and finely chopped white from a green onion at the beginning.  Also, use 2 T of cornstarch instead of 1.  At the end, use two eggs instead of 1.  These changes gave me the consistency I am used to with Egg Drop soup.  I thought it was good and will make again.

I'd tried this recipe before and I wasn't crazy about it.  After reading the reviews I tried it again and added the sesame oil and it was fabulous!  Glad I gave it another chance, this one's a keeper!

This was a good base,but I added a few things to make it taste more like what I'm used to. I added a few drops of sesame oil, 2 eggs, & 2-3 sliced criminis. I fried a small white onion in stir fry oil until very crisp & topped each bowl w/them. Made all the difference!

This is a great base for egg drop soup like restaurants have. To make it a little more, here's what I did differently: 1. Added 1Tbs of soy sauce and a few dashes of ginger (about 1/4-ish tsp.) 2. I also wanted some of the sesame oil flavor in most egg drop soups, but I can never seem to get the ratio right. In order to do this, I actually cooked some chicken cut into matchstick strips and cooked that in a bit of sesame oil, then added that to the soup. I'd say a teaspoon of oil roughly. Also MAKE SURE you add your cornstarch BEFORE eggs, otherwise, the eggs get all puffy instead of stringy like restaurant soup. I'll definitely be making this again. Perfect for our snowy winter evenings :) Even the little one loves it.

Made this yesterday for my sick partner and she absolutely loved it.  I added a bit of white pepper and it needed salt (used a sodium free chicken powder to make the broth).  As the cook, my only recommendation is to make sure you use a wide pot as some of the egg clumped together.  Definitely stir more than one slow turn of the pot.  Very easy and quick to make!

Not only did it separate, but I followed the directions to a T (sans green onion as I'm allergic) but it tasted like chicken broth. I will not be making this again.

I've made this soup without cornstarch and it was good, just like what I've had in restauarnts. I didn't like as much thickened. I also didn't have any chives or green onion on hand so I added some McCormick's No Salt Added Garlic and Herb Seasoning. I added two eggs instead of 1.

Very simple and yummy.  Make sure you use a good brand name chicken both though, I used no name and it wasn't as good as I'm sure a better quality would've been.  Also, I added a touch of sesame oil and some ground ginger to the broth...so good and so easy!

It was a hit with my family.  My husband ad-libbed the original recipe way too much with an abundance of soy sauce and ginger. So, he made another batch for me following the original recipe.  I took a full cup of the original and 1/4 cup of his and mixed them together, which made it very flavorful. Therefore, I suggest adding 1/2 tsp of ground ginger and 1-1/2 tsp of soy sauce.

Excellent!! I took the suggestions of other cooks and added sesame oil, soy sauce & pepper.  I also added an extra egg.  It is key to slightly beat the egg before and add it when the broth is boiling.  Simple & delicious!! Thanks

It was a hit with the family, but when I went to my favorite Chinese place, this recipe didn't even come close. Theirs was much thicker. Next time I'm going to use more egg and drop the green onions.

I really enjoyed this, but I agree with the previous reviewer. I had been looking for something with more of a "restaurant-style" flavor. This was definitely easy and delicious, but it was too "chicken-brothy" as far as taste.

The best Egg Drop I've ever made. And super-super easy! Deep fried some Won Ton Wrapers (sliced into tree strips) and served in the soup.

This soup was DELICIOUS! The only problem I had was that there was not enough cornstarch in the recipe given. I needed to add 1/2 to 1 tablespoon more. Also, it did not taste exactly like the chinese restaurant soup I am familiar with. If you want to have it taste like that, I would highly recommend adding a splash or two of sesame oil.

This was great! My kids loved it! I did however add a few drops of sesame oil and cooked the green onions with the broth. I had to add extra cornstarch. Although it wasn't yellowish like in the resturants, it was still yummy!

This soup was good. I only gave it four stars due to the salt. Next time, I would use low sodium chicken broth. Also, I would add the cornstarch mixed with a little reserved broth after the mixture boiled as mine did not thicken as much as I would've liked. I did use a splash of low sodium soy sauce and some of the green onions (as per another reviewer)while it was cooking and two eggs. Overall, very good and quick to make. Thanks for the recipe.

Very simple and good! My husband who is cooking impaired was able to make this for me while I was sick, and it tasted like it was supposed to! 
 I think the key is using broth of best quality.
 I'm a picky pregnant girl who craves very specific things (like restaurant quality egg drop soup at 3 a.m.) and this recipe passed the test!

This is a great recipe.  Easy and my kids always ask for seconds.  I keep crunchy chinese noodles on hand to add to it, and my family chows it down!!  Add some frozen egg rolls and a stir fry and you have a great chinese dinner.

I decided to attempt a Chinese restaurant style dinner the other night and used this recipe for the soup.  We really enjoyed it and it was so simple to make!  I cut the recipe in half and still used 1 egg.  It was just right for us.

Just adding a side note, the crunchy things that they give you at restaurants to put in this soup are fried wontons.  You can buy them at the grocery store and just cut them into strips and deep fry them or bake them in a pan with cooking spray at 350 for 20 min. 

You can always of course make your own wonton dough from scratch:

Right before the egg drop I went ahead and added approximately two more tablespoons of cornstarch (mixed in a little cold water before adding of course) because the broth was looking thinner than I liked. I also increased the quantity of eggs up to 2. It came out perfect. If you like a thinner soup, stick with the original recipe. If you prefer a thicker soup, increase the cornstarch. I followed user suggestions and added a splash of soy sauce and sesame oil. Restaurant-quality indeed! Very well done.

This recipe is a good base. I added a litte sesame oil and soy sauce. I think that I will use a homemade stock the next time. I think that is the key to good egg drop soup.

This was the first time I have ever made egg drop soup. I loved it and so did my whole family. I did add a can of water, salt, pepper, and some sauteed shrimp, onion, carrots, and bell pepper in evoo. My husband first made this combination at the Chinese buffet and it was a hit. So I decided to make my own combination. you can even add in frozen pees to the soup while it is cooking. But that is only if you want something extra in it. This is a great soup and thank you for sharing it! :-)

Quite a good recipe, but I definitely felt the need to tweak to my family's taste... I added more egg than was called for and added Bragg's to it (a floavor like soy sauce, but better!). My whole family liked this, which surprised me. I will definitely make this again, and continue to change it up!

Not impressed at all. This recipe was so bland and didn't taste anything like my favorite restaurant's egg drop soup.

I can't rate this in comparison with Chinese restaurant-style soup, since I only tried that sort once and was turned WAY off by the fried-egg, yolky flavor.  THIS, however, is a very nicely textured, good soup perfect with hot bread on a cold day.  I only gave the recipe four stars due to the difficulty I have in getting the soup to thicken as it should.  I note the recipe states the chicken broth should be cold when I mix it with the cornstarch, so perhaps that's my problem (I usually don't refrigerate unopened canned broth, only the broth I make myself).  I plan on making this again soon.

Very easy and good.  My husband has never been a fan of egg drop soup but I made him taste it and he ate the rest of the soup!

This recipes was awesome! The soup was delicious! We did add a little more soy sauce than what was recommended as well. We will definitely be making this soup again and again!

It was good...but I added fresh mushrooms, chopped up cabbage, and green onion to the soup.  I think without the veggies, it would have been a lil boring.

This is a fairly good base recipe.  You don't need to do much to it to make it even better.  I used about 2 T cornstarch to get it to the right thickness.  I used 2 cans of LOW SODIUM chicken broth, 2 eggs, 1 dash of white vinegar, 1 dash of soy sauce.  I also threw in the green onions before the broth got hot, and I let them steep in the broth to get a little soft and infuse the broth.  Yum Yum.  Ate with pork egg rolls.

My room-mate loves egg-drop--wonton soup, so I combined this with Holly's wonton soup recipe.  I don't eat pork, so I made it only with shrimp.  It was a little labor-intensive, but totally worth the effort.

Soooo yummy! Added the sesame oil and a bit of soy sauce. I slowly dripped in the eggs (two works perfectly) with my whisk. This is much better than anything you can get at the restaurant and it's soooo easy to make!!!

This was DELICIOUS and so easy to make!  I added 1.5 T cornstarch to thicken it more, a few drops of sesame oil as previously suggested, and some soy sauce (unmeasured).  The result was super yummy, and kids loved it.  I think w/enough pepper (I accidently put in more than called for) it is great for colds!

Eliminate the starch and add a can of cream style corn!  Also, 2 eggs is better.

A friend made this the other day for lunch and it was GREAT!  The sesame oil tip given by another reviewer was just the trick!  The only thing I would change is to use a low sodium broth.

I had boiled chicken breast and had some chicken stock, so I decided to make egg drop soup.  I included 2 eggs and added some frozen/defrosted peas to add some extra taste.   The soup was good, but it was missing something.  I will try again, but include sesame oil, as others have mentioned.

Delicious recipe - I used the sesame oil as well.  I put the egg in after the cornstarch.  Definitely a keeper.  A soothing comfort food and great appetizer.

Delicious!  I added the scallions and the sesame oil( while the broth cooked).  Also added 2 eggs instead of 1.  It's all about what you're use to. My husband loved the two eggs; I thought it was a bit much.  He didn't add soy sauce; I added quite a bit (could eat it alone, I must say).  This is easy - don't stress out about the ingredients.  It will taste great; if not, add some soy sauce!!

Good starter recipe. I added alot to it though--salt, pepper, ginger root and some vinegar to give it a little extra kick. I even added a few drops of tabasco. I also ended up adding a lot more corn starch than the recipe calls for but that might be personal preference since I like a thick egg drop soup.

Really good soup. My 12-year old daughter made this soup as an extra credit project for her 6th grade country report- we had two huge crockpots worth- the kids devoured it, not a drop came home.

This was easy and very comparable to a spice packet that I picked up some time ago.  I was hoping for just a little more flavor, but was still very good.  Thanks for the post.

Great recipe, but a little watery. Added 5  vigorous shakes of table salt and 2 shakes of Jane's Crazy Mixed-up Salt! 
So good! SO good! SO GOOD! Will definatly try again, but I'll add another egg! Yum!

I loved it. It looked and tasted authentic. It was so simple. I did think it was a little rich, so I would use a little water to dillute it next time, but it was really good.

This soup sounded quick and easy, but a little plain.  I added one tablespoon of rice wine vinegar and one tablespoon of soy sauce for an added kick.  It came out great, and it was quick and easy.

This dish is tasty, quick, high in protein, and low in fat.  I would have given it 5 stars, but I agree, it doesn't taste exactly like what I get in a Chinese restaurant.  Still a keeper, especially since I can usually make it with things I always have on hand.

Simple and convenient to make. Not as salty as restaurant- style, which is great. It was not as thick as some that I've eaten from restaurants, as well.

I used the chicken broth you get in a carton instead of the canned broth. I just used the same amount that the recipe called for. I also followed some of the other suggestions in that I used 2 tbsp corn starch, used the white bulb of the onion in the soup as it cooked and used the greens as garnish, pepper, and finally I used 2 eggs instead of one. It came out delicious. I will definitely make it again. Yum.

It's a really good recipe, I enjoy it very much! Although, next time I'm going to add the green onion before the egg to add more of its flavor to the broth and some pepper to give it a little kick. Yeah, I'm gonna do that.
Super delicious.

Instead of canned chicken broth, I used 2 cups of water and a Knorr bouillon cube.  When that came to a boil, I added 2 TB fine noodles and cooked them for 10 min.  Then I dropped the beaten egg into the simmering broth.  No cornstarch.  Tasty.  This way that I make it is comfort food for sore throats in the wintertime.

Made this using a home made vegetable stock without the green onions.  I used 3 eggs instead of 1  turned out pretty well, I definitely see the need for the green onions next time.

Simple to make. Not bad, but not as good as Chinese restaurant soup either. Too thin, and too bland if prepared as is.
  Needs to be jazzed up with additional ingredients (ginger, soy sauce, black sesame oil, extra cornstarch, more green onions) to make it like a restaurant soup.

Tastes very good and is quite simple to make. Used arrowroot (instead of cornstarch) for a clearer base, added salt and pepper for additional flavoring.

A lot of people suggested adding sesame oil and I've had some chicken laying around that needed to be used. So I cooked up the chicken with the oil and added it after the egg and it came out really well!

This was a bit too bland for my taste.  So I added 2T soy sauce, 1tsp seasame oil, 1/4tsp salt, 1/4tps white peoper and I used 2 eggs.  It was so good!

I had no clue how to go about making egg drop soup, so the real value of this recipe, for me, was in the method of making the soup. So thank you for that! :) The contents, however, needed a little boost. I doubled the eggs and added sesame oil, fresh grated ginger & garlic for some extra flavor. I did not have green onions, so I cut up some baby bok choy and used that. Turned out great!

I loved this simple recipe.  Much cheaper than the mix from the store, which was over 3$ last time I looked.  I followed advice I found here, (the best feature of Allrecipes) and used bullion, 2 eggs more corn starch and especially sesame oil.      I wish the experienced cooks had told the secret of adding corn starch to cold water first because I had a lumpy mess, but it all turned out in the end.  Thanks all you recipe raters.

This is super simple and comes together pretty quickly. I used low sodium chicken broth, and it needed just a little bit of salt to make the flavors really sing.

My family didn't like this very much.  We had high hopes after all the reviews.  We took their suggestions & added double gr onions & startch & eggs.  The directions don't say what to cook it on so I had it on medium.  The eggs didn't cook like they should have, the soup looked like the original picture on here so the texture was not how it should have been for this type of soup.  I was the only one who ate, 1/2 of mine in a family of 4 who are not picky.  The texture was too odd & it didn't really taste all that good.

This was delicious!!  I halved the recipe just to make sure it was good.  It's a good thing I did because I ate the whole bowl.  Only  WW pt per serving.  I did add an extra egg white and the sesame oil someone suggested.  Will be making this offen!

My family really like this also. My 2 year old even had some! I was confused with how long to cook the broth and cornstarch. It really didn't thicken up that much, but I didn't mind. I will be making this again!

Maybe I expected too much of this recipe but I was not impressed at all.  Instead of an Asian-style soup, the result was exactly like the chicken broth my mom made me when I was sick...  Very disappointed.  It does make a great broth for when you're sick, though!

This is a good base but I am glad I read the reviews first because I added in some sesame oil and some pepper for taste.  This made it really tasty. I also used two eggs instead of one.  I will definitely make this again.

Very good recipe! I made the revisions noted in the first few reviews (added a tsp of soy sauce, a few drops of sesame oil, and a dash of ginger). I also used one can of broth and a can of water instead of 2 cans of broth. It was much less salty that way. Lastly, I diced some mushrooms and put them in there - they heated through after about 5 minutes. Very yummy.

I've tried a few recipes and this one tasted just like the restaurant. My husband loved it. I put in corn instead of green onions.

This is really good soup! I like my soup a lttle thick, so I added just about a 1/4 teaspoon more corn starch and it was perfect. We will never have another stir-fry night without this soup!!!

This was very good and could even be improved by adding a little soy and chicken. I will do this next time.

Very good. I added chicken to mine. Tastes like what I get at my favorite Chineese resturant.

I've only had egg drop soup one time, from a local take out and it honestly wasn't my favorite.  This recipe rocked over that one!  I had a half bowl, and my husband ate the rest....he loved it!  I too cooked the green onions in the broth and also added a sprinkle of chicken bouillon and an extra egg.  Tasty!  Thanks Patsy.

This was a great recipe.  I forgot the corn starch, and the soup was still delicious.  I used vegetarian leek-based broth.  My husband, who "hates" egg drop soup, loved it!

This was okay.  I put two eggs in and it was too much.  Next time I will stick to one.  I also dipped a fork in the egg and dripped it in the broth.  It looked pretty, but may have cooked too long.

This is the PERFECT recipe. My husband tried other recipes, but he wanted a thicker soup, like at our chinese restaurant. I found this one, and we were SO very happy to find it. The cornstarch is what did it!

This is the absolute best egg drop soup.  I can't believe how easy it was to make and how great the result was.  My mom suggested adding another egg next time I make it.

this is a great recipe!  super quick and easy, and tastes just like it's from a restaurant!  I also added a splash or two of soy sauce to mine, but I do that to any egg drop soup.

My family and I had this and it was WONDERFUL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The only thing I suggest is to put about a Tablespoon of some Siracha sauce (just to give it a kick).
