This was a huge hit with a kids party. I did not use sprinkles but rolled the ball in mini chocolate chips and peanut butter chips. We used Nilla Wafers and graham crackers in the dip.

Oh my!! is this good!!  easy to make too.    Next time I may use a combination of peanut butter chips and chocolate chips to coat the cheese  ball.    Even finely chopped peanuts might be good!  Going to serve this with another  dessert cheese ball.   the chocolate chip cheese ball from this site is  wonderful !  Serving with honey pretzels  mini vanilla wafers.

I made this for our New Yearâ€™s Eve party last night for the kids. It was a huge hit with them and the kids. I will definitely make this one again.

Made this to snack on during the Super Bowl..Instead of using pretzels, I used celery sticks and apple slices. Loved it...I also used crunchy peanut butter. What's not to love about chocolate and peanut butter...I'll definitely be making this again! Thanks for a great recipe..
