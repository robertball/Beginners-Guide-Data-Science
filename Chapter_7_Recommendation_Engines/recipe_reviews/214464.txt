I like the ingredients but I thought it needed a little bit more to it.  So I also added ginger powder, kechup and fresh garlic.  My husband loved it and even my 3 year old ate his.

Excellent, although I added fresh ginger & garlic along with sesame seed oil and cooking wine with a hint of hoison sauce. I also tossed before the last 15 minutes of cooking to insure a good coating of the marinade.   Oh yeah!

Yummy, yummy, yummy.  I made these for superbowl and they were great.  I didn't have 5 pounds of chick. wings so I poured some of the marinade off before baking.  I also added a little rice wine vinegar to marinade.  They were sweet, sticky and delicious.  Thanks for the great recipe.

This worked out perfectly. I baked the wings first and then put the sauce (didn't boil) in a crockpot on low to keep warm for my party - amazing!!! This is the best recipe ever (I remember it from being a kid my mom made it too)

3 stars as is, but I made a bunch of changes and then they were awesome. 2 cups of soy sauce made it WAY too salty!!! and i  use low sodium soy sauce and put less than the full two cups but even so, it was HORRIBLY salty. I basically had to start over and this is how i made it: sautee 4-6 cloves of garlic, fresh ginger, sliced green onions, and 1-2 sliced jalapeno peppers in sesame oil. then add 1/2 c. soy sauce, 1 c. pinapple juice, and about 1/2 c brown sugar. add black pepper, red pepper flakes, white pepper, sracha sauce, and a little honey. at that pnt you can re-evaluate the soy sauce and add more if need be. i tossed my wings in this on the stove and allowed them to cook as the sauce caramelized on top of them. then took them out of the sauce and broiled them for 25 min, tossed them in the sauce on the stove again and let them cook on the stove for another 5 min, and then re-broiled for 10 minutes before serving. my wings were pre-cooked so you may need to broil for longer to cook through, but they cme out amazing

I loved this.  It’s easy to put together with items readily available in your pantry.  The marinade imparts good flavor yet doesn’t overpower the chicken.  I marinated the chicken overnight and finished the wings on the grill.   Great recipe – so simple.  It's great as is but next time I may try a little minced fresh ginger to add some complexity.

I did not use the full amount of the Soy Sauce because I ran out..plus I red many of the reviews and I did not want them to turn out too salty. I also added a few red pepper flakes and a dash or 2 of Worcestershire. This was my 1st time trying this recipe or anything remotely close to it. I am totally satisfied with the outcome. I will be adding this to my menu for a long time to come. Kudos to the adder!

I used to make a similar recipe that called for white sugar, but no precooking of the marinade.  I think the brown sugar adds more flavor - I also added some fresh grated ginger before pouring the marinade over the wings.  These were a big hit with everyone!

The only thing wrong with this recipe, according to my husband, is that I didn't double it! Delicious & easy. We had it with Japanese Zuchini & Onions (from this site) and rice. A perfect meal.

Very good. I added garlic and ginger. The wing were delicious and fell off the bone. You have to be careful with what kind of soy sauce you get. I used a really dark soy sauce and wish I could have used a lighter soy sauce. Either way it was delicious.

Great!  Very easy.  Served them with potstickers and the marinade for the chicken made a great sauce for the potstickers-nice bonus!  Will definitely make again.

Way too much soy sauce!!  Affected both taste and consistency--not sticky.  Cut soy in half or use even less.  Like others, believe ginger would make it better.

I cut this recipe in half because I had about 2-1/2 lb. chicken wings.  After reading other reviews, I substituted minced garlic for the garlic powder and added some fresh grated ginger.  Marinated the wings for 6 hrs, baked as directed and they turned out great.
We had some leftover and they were even better when reheated a few days later.  Also, I used some of the marinade to spice up leftovers from an Asian restaurant - excellent.  Just an all-around tasty sauce.
Thanks, Jeanettebird, for posting this recipe.

Dh had these for dinner and the leftovers for lunch the next day but really wasn't blown away by them.  They were barely colored by the marinade and didn't carmalize in the baking process.  I doubt that I'll make them again.

I love this recipe. I didn't have chicken wings so i used chicken tenders instead and marinated them for well over 9 hours and then baked them in the marinade so the chicken was very flavorful. the only thing i didn't like was that it was on the saltier side and it totally stunk up my kitchen. it smelled horrible but i think that might have been because i used a really cheap brand of soy sauce. i really want to make this with wings next time

Delicious taste -- but, this was the first time that I ever had chicken "thighs" and they pale in comparison to chicken breasts. Loved the taste, however, and will make again WITH breasts.

To be fair, I only marinaded these for 6 hours.  Maybe overnight would have yielded more taste, but Hess were bland.  Next time I will add some ginger, more garlic, and maybe some curry paste

This is a wonderful recipe!  I added a tablespoon of ginger because I love it and it goes well with soy sauce and garlic.  I also used a whole chicken instead of just wings.  It was absolutely delicious.  I had it with fried rice ordered from a local Chinese place.  This marinade can be used for all kinds of chicken cuts to give it a Chinese flavor.  I'll bet you could even use thin cut beef or pork strips.

I add 2 Tbsp of ground ginger, marinate it forever plus 5 minutes, and bake them without the sauce cause I like em crispy.

I made this dish for our at-home Chinese date night.  We loved the way the chicken turned out!  I used 3 whole legs, because that is what I had & didn't use as much soy sauce as it called for...my husband ate two whole servings of the chicken!
I served it with white rice and broccoli/carrot stir fry.  DELICIOUS!!!
It is certainly something we will be eating again. Thank you for this recipe!

Made these just as directed, with the addition of a can of pineapple chunks with the juice, but used the slow cooker.  Served them for my part of our annual Aloha poker run in our little Florida community. 

Not a single wing left over.  Thank you!

Very tasty, and very easy! I made this using light brown sugar, and a little more wings (5.5#, after removing the tips) that I had on hand. Made exactly as directed, and it took me a couple days to eat it all. It reheats well, too. Worth making again.

Made as directed, family loved it! Now I make this at least monthly, but have added a good dose of Sriracha to the mix (about a tablespoon), and finish them on the grill for a little extra crispiness, which my family prefers. Excellent!

Sorry - just did not like like it, much too salty for my taste. The flavor seemed to be missing something but I always follow the recipe exactly the first time I make it. Perhaps it would be better if I had followed some of the other reviewers suggestions. Anyway, thank you Jeannettebird for submitting the recipe.

I marinated the wings for 24 hours and cooked them this evening. They were absolutely delicious. I used Liquid Aminos as opposed to soy sauce and lowered the amount to 1/2 cup.  Also added 1-1/2 Tbsp Garlic Powder - 1-1/2 Tsp Ginger - 1/2 Tsp Crushed Red Pepper - 2 Tbsp Rice Vinegar.
I followed the cooking directions - 45 minutes foil covered - 15 minutes uncovered then finished on the grill over coals. Very tasty.

I lightly battered chicken wings put them in the fryer for a few minutes, took them out, rolled them in the marinade, then put them back in until cooked. Came out tasting JUST like the wings they serve in Chinese  resteraunts. YUMMY!

Like others I added sesame seed oil, ginger, and I also added onion powder, and I thought it was a bit too salty so maybe next time I'll use low-sodium soy sauce, or reduce it to 1 1/2 cups.  Also, I didn't marinate for the recommended 8 hours...maybe about 30 minutes while I prepped my sides and it still came out delicious.

I made this dish for Sunday dinner today. I made a few alterations. First I made the maranade, I added three minced cloves of garlic and fresh ginger and set it to the side. I oven fried the chicken. Once the chicken was done, I dipped them in the sauce and let them cook at 400 for about 7 minutes. Can't wait to make them again!

This recipe is soooo good!  Very simple and delicious!  Made minor changes but for me the changes were important because I do not like my food too salty.  When I prepare Chinese dishes that call for soy, I cut back on the soy a little bit and add white wine and it always turns out fantastic.  For this recipe , I used 1 1/2 cups of the soy and 1/2 cup of white wine.  Per other suggestions on this site I added 2t of Worcestershire sauce and 1t red pepper flakes. The wings were out of this world delicious and practically fell of the bone as we ate them!  Will definitely be making these again!
