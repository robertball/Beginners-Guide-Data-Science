This is a SUPERB recipe!  I made the suggested changes of adding 8Tb OJ and 8Tb butter and orange zest from 1/2 an orange...and instead of using a biscuit cutter, I just flattened the dough to 3/4" instead of a 1/2" and cut into triangles.  I ended up with 8 good sized scones so I increased the baking time by 3-4 minutes.  They were awesome tasting- the zest really brings up the orange taste up a notch.

Yummy!! Like everyone else I had to use way more orange juice (I didn't keep track of how much just kept adding until it seemed right). I also used chocolate chunks and it ended up tasting just the chocolate scones at Starbucks. Now I can save my $1.50 and just make them at home - thanks!!!

Quite good.I didn't add more OJ to the mix, but I did add an additional 2 T of butter. I pack and form mine by hand (no pin, no cutter), so the dough is plenty moist for my liking. Try it this way if you like a more traditional (drier - more bisuit than muffin, but not a cookie) scone. They do a wonderful job of soaking up coffee or tea.

Very flavorful and sweet compared to many scone recipes I've tried. It's great for the sweet tooth, almost more like a chocolate chip bread than a scone. I used 1/2 c. orange juice and I also mixed an egg with the milk, because the dough was quite dry. Also sprinkled coarse sugar on top. Sweet-crazy coworkers loved it - thanks for the recipe!

I absolutely loved these scones! They tasted wonderful. I also added more orange juice (about 8 more tablespoons) because the dough was a little dry. I also added a few more tablespoons of butter. It was very delicious. Thank you Holly!

To me a traditional english scone is a little more flakey than this was. This had a funny texture more like a cake/cookie- I really think the odd texture came from the addition of extra orange juice. The mixture was very dry before adding the extra juice, so perhaps you could add extra butter instead to give it a better texture? It was good enough, but I wouldn't classify it as a scone & I certainly wouldn't serve it to royalty lol. I probably won't make this again

These were amazing!  I substituted a dried fruit mix for the chips and they turned out great! They were gobbled up right away and I've been asked to make more.  Thank you for this wonderfully easy and delicious recipe! (do need to add more oj though)

Like most other reviewers, I found the mixture too dry to hold together.  I used 8 T. butter (salted since it's all I had), 10 T. orange juice, and a little over 1/4  tsp. salt.  I patted the dough into the 9" circle and cut it into 12 triangles.  I had to bake it 22 minutes.  Delicious flavor with just a hint of the orange.  I see this as a very flexible recipe that I can use with cranberries, blueberries, or any other add-in that I can come up with.

Nice recipe. I tried these scones about 5 years ago as the "first" scones I've ever made.  Had difficulty working the dough and it was too dry, and like extra reviewers ended up adding a but more liquid - in my case 2 Tbs of heavy cream.  Everythings better with heavy cream!  At variouse times I've added a bit extra orange juice if I don't have cream.  

I tried the recipe with some of the added suggestions and was not impressed with the texture of the scones after adding more then 2Tbs or so extra liquid.  A Tbs or two makes you able to pat the dough into a round, but it is still crumbly and can be hard to work with; however, this also gives you the wonderful flakey scones that I love.  Adding additional liquid makes the scones easer to work with, less crumbly, but they also end up with the more biscuit like texture, which seems like a waste of all that careful cutting in of the butter.  Both ways are quite edible and I love the flavor.

The final result was fantastic.  However, the liquid measurements are way, way off on this recipe.  I used 4 tbsp orange juice and 3 tbsp milk before it finally came together as a dough.  I used white chocolate chips and added orange zest.  After they were done I drizzled an orange juice/powdered sugar glaze over them and they were irresistible.  I think the basic recipe could be altered to accommodate different fruits or chips just as successfully.

I'm giving five stars for this recipe, because I'm so glad to have found  a version that I could adapt to get what I've wanted for a long time.  My changes: use salted butter, don't add salt, add one egg, juice of one orange (about 5 tablespoons more or less), 2 tablespoons of sour cream; I shaped each scone to about the size of an egg; baking time was the same.  Perfection!

This is my daughter's favorite recipe from this site!  I used the measurements that were given - the only change I made was to use orange juice concentrate and using more of it, enough until moistened, maybe 1/3 of a cup.  This really intensifes the orange flavor.  Also I use my food processor to blend the dry ingredients with the butter.  Great recipe!  Thanks so much for posting!

I needed an "English" recipe for my 5th graders class, but never expected I'd have to keep making these again and again!!!  What a hit.  It's Christmas Eve 2002 and I'm on my 4th batch!!!  Everyone want's more and they also went out in gift baskets.  Add the extra orange juice.  I start with 8 T. and usually add a little more.

Good scones!  I added a little freshly-grated orange peel and more OJ for moisture.  Very good served with orange marmalade.  This could become a favorite!

awesome recipe, I have used it several times and its the perfect tea time recipe :) You can replace the oranje juice with milk too, if you don't have any oranges. I also add some walnuts to spice this recipe up. Great recipe!!!

Very delicious, almost taste like chocolate chip cookies!  I too added two extra tablespoons of orange juice and an extra tsp. of butter.  I have tried lots of scone recipes and these are definitely the best yet! Also, just wanted to point out that this recipe makes four "regular" size scones.  If you want more, double the recipe! :)

These scones turned out just as we were hoping and my kids absolutely loved them.  They have the perfect texture, not too crumbly, not too dense, and the chocolate chips go very nicely with the slight orange flavor.  A favorite with my kids means this will be a repeat.

This is a great recipe and very tasty! I made these when the BF had a friend over. He said "what are scones?" and I told him that they are in between biscuits and cookies. That's very true with this! I added orange zest to the dough. I also cut into triangles- and added enough orange juice to make a dough- as other people. I made a glaze for some of orange juice and powdered sugar. All in all they were very tasty with a nice orange chocolate taste. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is I think it could have been more tender. Not sure how that could have been done- but I like a more tender almost fluffy scone.

Super easy and very tasty without being to dry!  I timed myself from the start.  It took me 12 minutes to put together get in oven, clean up mess then another 11 to 12 minutes for baking time.  Thats it!  Oh try and make sure you put in middle of the oven so thay don't over brown and burn your chips.

Great scones! I add an extra 5 Tb. of juice (for a total of 8), 3 extra Tb. of butter (for a total of a whole stick of butter), and have used multiple kinds of chips, though chocolate definitely works best. The chocolate chips can be big or small, it really doesn't matter, I used chunks in them this morning and they were fabulous! Also, if you don't have orange juice on hand, I have substituted grapefruit juice with no problems, and no change to the taste of the recipe. Oh, and I don't roll the dough, I just make a nice circle about 6" diameter, and then cut it into 8 pieces, like a pizza. Bakes great!

These were GREAT!  Everything one would want from a scone.  I substituted milk for the oj the recipe called for and we really enjoyed them.  I've also made them with cinnamon chips instead of chocolate (divine) and with dates and nuts instead of chocolate chips - they are ALWAYS great!
Thank you SO MUCH for posting this one!

This was fantastic! I followed the recipe exactly, the only thing I had to adjust was the amount of orange juice used. When I added just the 3 TB called for, the mixture was too dry. So I added an additional 8 TB and then it was just the right consistency. Wonderful flavor and texture to these scones. Definitely a keeper!

I'd never made scones before trying this but was eager to try! I followed recipe exactly and realized it was a smidgen too dry. I added a little more OJ until the mix was moist enough to stick together but not enough to make the dough sticky. They were perfect! I made another batch a week later and was just as pleased with them the second time around :)

These scones are delicious!  We added around 6 tbsp of butter and close to 8 tbsp of orange juice.  They are not overly sweet but still very yummy!

This is a wonderful recipie. My husband and I are currently living in Japan and do not have a starbucks near by. So i make these for my husband instead, and shape them into triangles like they do at the coffee shop. I omit the orange juice and replace with vanilla. These are so yummy :)

This recipe is simple and easy to prepare. My family loves waking up on the weekends to the smell of these scones.  I zest the peel of the orange that I squeeze for the orange juice and add that to the dough. I think that dark chocolate chips are a must. I do not roll them out.  Instead I just dollop the dough on the cookie sheet.  I sprinkle them with sugar and bake.
They are absolutely scrumptious!

My husband made these, so I'm not sure what exactly he did to fix the liquid amounts on these, but he said that there was not nearly enough liquid ingredients to stick everything together. I think he had to add a lot more orange juice and butter, but whatever he did turned out great and we gobbled these right up. He also added a little bit of shredded sweetened coconut. Good ingredient ideas, but recipe needs some tinkering.

i also used a full stick (8 tbsp) butter and 8 tbsp (1/2 cup) orange juice. and also zest from about half an orange.  these were really good, i thought. when they came out of the oven, it was delicious!!! try not to overwork the dough too much, i think i did and it ended up making it a little too tough. these are really good for breakfast, so i will probably make them a good deal.

I didn't taste them but my husband did and he couldn't taste the orange juice. I had added 8 tablespoons of oj. He really enjoyed them though! I had made them for my little cousins birthday/tea party and they looked perfect when they came out of the toaster oven! Very cute!

Heavenly. Recommend adding orange zest. A pinch of baking soda doesn't hurt either. Taste best warm but heat up very well in a toaster oven. Intend to tinker w/ lemon juice. YUM.

These scones are really great. The only flaw is that the is not enough OJ to make it form a dough, I added more and they turned out great.

Good recipe for a breakfast scone. I did a double batch and they did not last long at work. The recipe needed more liquid so I added two times the amount of orange juice and two extra tablespoons of butter. This helped quite a bit and with a little butter on the tops really made them great.

I'm not sure why people give so many stars to recipes that suck. The recipe (as written) was terrible. There was no where near enough liquid. My poor 10 year old daughter was trying to make this for a school project. I salvaged it by adding an egg and nearly tripling the orange juice. I used a small canning jar lid to size them and 12 minutes was perfect timing wise. They tasted like chocolate chip biscuits (as expected). I would have given them 5 stars if the recipe was complete.

The scones would have been 4 stars after fixing the recipe, but I, too, had to increase the orange juice to 1/2 cup (or 8 tbs.). There is NO way this would have worked with the crumbs I had at 3 tbs. of orange juice, which knocks the recipe down another star. After this correction, the scones were pretty tasty, but the texture wasn't your traditional scone texture, which isn't surprising considering the liquid is orange juice instead of buttermilk or cream. They were good enough to make 2 batches, but overall not my favorite scone recipe.

I loved this recipe so easy to make! If anything water needs to be added slowly, to form a dough. It will depend where you live, due to the moisture where I live in South Florida. I also made this recipe, for my class project for Food and Beverage Management Class at AIFL in the Culinary Department.

Yum! LOVE them!  I use self-rising flour usually, so I don't add salt or baking powder, and they taste and rise just fine.  I increased the butter to 8 T, and didn't have orange juice so I used milk, and they still taste fabulous.  My children, who have never liked scones before, now squabble over these.

This was a great recipe!  I did not have any OJ so I just used milk (about 3 T) and added dried sweetened cranberries.  Between the cranberries and chocolate, I think I would use less sugar next time.  Maybe about 3 T (about half as much).  I do plan on trying the orange juice soon though.  Yum!

All cooks are jazz musicians or, if you prefer, experimental chemists; they get a good recipe and start improvising. I love this recipe. It works well with the orange juice but also I've used fat-free half and half (almost a half cup, I think) for the liquid. The basic recipe gives you a good scone to which I have added raisins, chips and nuts- all wonderful. I mix the dough with my hands (after it's been moistened enough) and just put rounded blobs of the dough on the cookie sheet. I usually sift all ingredients when I cook but NOT for scones or muffins- one wants the rough quality for them. They bake up very well. Outside they are slightly hard and a bit crispy, inside, dense and fluffy (really, they're both.)  Very good recipe.  Thank you so much for it.

These were just ok for my husband and I.  I did use lemon curd on them and loved it.  Added 8 T of butter and oj, but was still very dry and as a result I over mixed, making scones a bit tough.  Not the best scone I've ever eaten.

Not again. I also had to adjust the recipe and what I got turned out more like a muffin. Sorry, I like them to work as written and as written I had a bowl of flour that just would not hold together.

I gave this 4 stars because I'm going to have to work with it.  The dough was just too dry as written.  Next time, I'm going to try adding more butter to get a flakier texture and a little more liquid to get the dough to hold together as others have suggested. I set it up in my customized recipes so I can track my versions until its where I like it.

Very good when the liquid and butter amounts are adjusted as other reviewers suggested.  I used my food processor: Add the dry ingredients and pulse a few times; add one stick of cold (or frozen) butter, cut into cubes, and pulse several times--until it resembles coarse meal; add the chocolate chips and pulse; then turn the processor on as you slowly add the liquid. Don't overwork it. You're just combining the ingredients.  The dough will look dry and powdery, but open the food processor and see if it will come together when you pinch it with your fingers. If not, add a few more drips of juice.  I didn't use the biscuit cutter. I just formed it into a round and cut it into 8 wedges. Tasted great!

These tasted good but ended up like rubber. I added more milk as some of the other reviews had said to do but still was not impressed. I like more of a biscuit-type scone I quess so I will keep looking for one like that.

I keep coming back to this recipe for some reason, even though it's not what you think a scone would taste like.  I did have to add a few more tablespoons of butter and alot more OJ.  The batter is way too sticky to roll out, so I like to just roll the batter into a ball and cook it more like a cookie.  They come out yummy and plump.  Also, I like to half the batter before adding the chocolate chips and either do raisins and cinnamon or blueberry. Of course I always have to make some with chocolate chips !  Overall, the batter is difficult but the taste makes up for the trouble.

this scone recipe is off the charts for simplicity & deliciousness! minor changes: adding about 1/2 tsp. of orange zest into the flour mixture & later needing to blend in about 2 T. milk ~ just enough to bring the ingredients into a ball. if you like, try patting the dough into an 8" circle, with a sharp knife score the top into 4 or 6 wedges & bake for 18 minutes (or until golden brown). thank you holly!

Upped the butter to 8Tbl. Didn't have OJ but put in 1/2c. 1% milk and 1tsp. orange extract. Didn't have chocolate chips so used Orange Essence Craisins. The smell alone lured my boyfriend to the oven to taste (and burn his tongue) on the first one out! Softer than most scones (I think it was the extract oil?)) but the flavors are paired perfectly! Maybe after a day will be more dense? Don't know much about scones but can't wait to try w/ chocolate chips!

These were great.  I didn't have any milk so when I saw this recipe I was glad to see that it didn't call for any.  I used more orange juice than the recipe called for to make the dough more manageable.  The scones were very rich and flavorful.  They reminded me a little of chocolate oranges.

This was my first crack at scones, and I picked a winner! Like everyone else, I had to add more oj and butter. I added two extra tbsp. of butter and 8 tbsp. total (maybe a little more) of oj. They were absolutely delicious! My boyfriend loves them too! Thanks!

Very easy.  I found the dough to be dry and crumbly so I added more OJ.  I pressed the dough together before turning it out because it was still crumbly after the addition of more OJ, and cut it into wedges like other scones.  It's fairly low-fat, compared to other recipes.  I substituted cinnamon-flavored chips for the chocolate and was pleased with the results.  Next time I think I'll add some milk as well as the OJ.  Overall, I liked it quite a bit.  Yummy!

Great combination of orange and chocolate, however this recipe needs much more liquid and more butter. After following the recipe and adding the orange juice, I did not have a dough but a pile of dry ingredients with a few coarse looking crumbs. I ended up having to add more orange juice, more butter, and also a tablespoon of heavy cream to make it resemble a normal scone dough. I would not suggest using this recipe.

This would have worked out better had I read the reviews before hand, the recipe as stated does not have nearly enough liquid to allow the dry ingredients to come together. Because I was adjusting the amount of liquid so much, the biscuit-style dough ended up being a bit tough. These are almost too sweet, I may also reduce the amount of sugar next time. I will have to make them again because my wife loves them and I may have to hide them if I want any! I used a pastry knife to cut the disk into square pieces, which gives nice browned corners.

I have since tried this using 8 tbsp (1/2 cup) each of butter and water (which works if you don't have orange juice handy), cutting into squares as before. This batch turned out much better and made a lot less mess!

I had high hopes for these scones.  I'd intended to make them for a Valentine themed brunch, but time got away from me and I wasn't able to.  As it turns out, that was a blessing.  I've made several kinds of scones in the past, and I was concerned when I saw that the recipe didn't call for any cream or eggs.  All my other scones were light and almost puffy.  These stayed the same size and seemed dense and flavor-less.
Like other reviewers, I had to add WAY more OJ to get the dough to come together, probably due to the lack of cream and eggs.  I think I ended up using almost 2 cups!  I won't be making these again.  If anyone is looking for a good scone recipe, try the Barefoot Contessa (Ina Garten).  You can't go wrong with hers.

Made these and they were delicious, but when does a recipes become a totally different recipe!  I mean if you have to add  that much more orange juice and butter  to even get the dough to form, aren't you making a whole new recipe..I made these without reading the reviews and when I added the OJ I quickly realized there must be a problem.  I will use this again, but will "rewrite" it so it can be easily followed.

These were incredibly easy to make, although I did have to double the orange juice like many other reviewers mentioned.  Warm out of the oven I did not care for these very much, but the next day I thought they were pretty good!  Thanks for sharing this recipe Marbalet!

I absolutely love scones but I have never dared to make them before.  These turned out perfect once I got the dough moist enough to hold it together, and I even made a batch to give away to friends!

made these to eat during our "Royal Wedding" party...incredibly yummy...I did add more orange juice than it called for, just because I liked it a little softer and more cakey than the traditional scone, but that slight hint of tanginess of the oj combined with the chocolate chips...YUMMY!!

Great recipe!!  I didn't have the OJ on hand so I substituted with 3 tbsp vanilla flavoring along my regular coffee creamer to the mixture little by little (equaled about 1/4 cup) till the texture was right.  My baking time was longer too..closer to 20+ mins.  They came out yum yum delicious!!

I just made these this afternoon and they are excellent! I substituted the chocolate chips for some orange flavored dried cranberries I had on hand from Trader Joe's. They worked perfectly with the orange juice in this recipe. I did as others suggested and added 2 Tbs butter and increased the orange juice to about 7 Tbs. Delicious!

I really dislike baking so if I put the effort into it I don't like to be disappointed with the results. I was very pleased with these yummy scones - not too bland, not too sweet. I did add quite a bit more OJ than the recipe calls for so I could get the dough to a consistency that was workable for me, probably about a third of a cup. the orange flavor was still a bit mild for me. next time I'll also add some orange zest or extract. I'm lazy when it comes to baking so I cut into wedges, which I prefer anyway, rather than doing the whole biscuit cutter thing and baked for 14 minutes. Sprinkled the tops with a bit of sugar after taking them out of the oven and they were DEEE-Lish! I was supposed to take them into work the next day, but I didn't want to share. I lied and said I forgot them on the counter then ate the rest when i got home. I hope none of my co-workers read this.

Yum! Like many other reviewers, I had to add a lot of extra orange juice to get it to moisten up enough. I used one of my daughter's plastic Ikea cups to cut out the biscuit shapes because I didn't have a biscuit cutter (worked perfectly). Otherwise, I made it exactly as written and they turned out heavenly!

These were AMAZING!!! I had my doubts, due to the simplicity of the ingredients, but the scones came out wonderfully! I used a whole stick of butter and 10 tbsp orange juice mixed with 1tbsp vanilla and the scones came out with a great vanillia, gently sweet taste. You can't really taste the OJ, but you can taste the delicate citrus sweetness. All in all, an easy, amazing, delicious recipe!

These were delicious. I never made scones before but had a craving for them! (Don't ask.) I didn't have any orange juice so I juiced an orange and used that. Had to add a bit more water to make it work and then had to bake them about 10 minutes longer. Was that because I added too much water? Also, I made these in the food processor which was amazingly easy. DELICIOUS. I rolled in a circle and scored in 8 pieces. They look like a bakery product and...YUM!

These were very good. I added the extra butter and OJ that other people suggested. I think I probably added too much OJ because they ended up more like cookies than scones. I also used an almond and toffee chocolate bar, chopped into chunks. Delish!

I added more OJ and butter like the other reviews suggested (otherwise I wouldn't have a dough, just a floury mess!) and the texture turned out awesome. But since I used so much more juice, it definitely left a "fruity" note in the scones that I didn't really care for. I might try this again using milk in place of some of the juice, but otherwise, I wouldn't make this again as written.

Wonderful!  I too, would suggest to add more OJ than the recipe calls for.  Keep adding little amounts until the mixture forms a dough.

These were more like a sweetened biscuit. Not what I was expecting. They are not flaky at all.

This was my first time making scones. They were so easy to make and were delicious. I ended up using 8TBL of butter and 5 or 6 TBL of Orange juice as some other reivews suggested. I will definetly make these again.

Since Grandma Johnson's Scones contain both sour cream and butter and seem to be the best reviewed recipe for scones, I decided to add 4-5 tablespoons of sour cream to this recipe.  The verdict: outstandingly chewy, moist but flaky scones!  I think sour cream is the secret ingredient to getting that perfect scone texture.  Because I hate a rock-hard dry scone.  Another reason I wanted to use sour cream is because I had no orange juice on hand, so this allowed me to keep the tang that the OJ would have probably brought.

I've made these a few times, and each time they are really good.  I've had to add a bit more liquid to get the dough to a good consistency.  I found that with the amount listed, it was still extremely powdery.

But they are great otherwise.  I've also made them with white chocolate chips, which were delicious!

There were so many good reviews for these, that I thought I'd try them for company. I made them twice, once following recipe and second time using advice to add more oj. Don't know what I did wrong, but they were terrible both times. It's a scone mix for the company tomorrow.

Very good recipe! I rated it a 4 because you do have to make some alterations - I had to use 8 tbsp of well-chilled butter, and upped the amount of juice from 3 to about 6-7 tablespoons, and also added the zest from the orange I juiced. I also used about 2/3 cup of chocolate chips instead of the 1/2 cup it called for. 1/3 were milk Ghirardelli and 1/3 were the 60% dark Ghirardelli, which are huge chips! I made  them into triangle wedges and my family liked them a lot.

Tried making these with 1 c ap flour and 3/4 c whole wheat flour; added fresh grated orange zest. Used finely chopped dark chocolate instead of chocolate chips. The scones are very good in terms of flavor: perfect balance of sweetness, chocolate and orange. I didn't quite get the texture right.

I probably shouldn't rate this recipe considering I made a completely different variation, but because I followed a majority of the staple recipe and had it turn out great, I though I should comment anyway.

The variation I did was lemon poppy seed scones, replacing the orange juice with lemon juice (next time I will add lemon zest or extract) and the chocolate chips with 2 tablespoons poppy seeds. I rolled it out with just my hands and used the top of a cup since I don't have any cookie cutters. This ended up making 20 bite-sized scones, (the top of the cup was fairly small) and I'm ashamed to say I ate half of them on the spot. It had a nice fluffy inside, not really scone like, but tasted really good. I replaced one of the tablespoons of butter with applesauce to make it healthier (i also used the smart start tub butter, and had no problems, and added a couple extra tablespoons of sugar to counteract the tartness of the lemon. I just cut in the butter with my fingers, and added the lemon juice as I went. I think I used about 5 tablespoons total. I will make many variations of this recipe, as it is both easier and healthier than most of the scone recipes out there. It was a little bit fluffier than other scones, but that was probably due to the adjustments I made. Thank you for this recipe!

Love it! these scones taste great and it was so simple to make. I added a few more TBLS.'s of orange juice and then split the dough in half and added 1/4 c. of choc. chips to one half (HIS) and 1/4 c. of fresh blueberries to the other half (HERS). Seconds after tranferring them onto the cooling rack, my hubby and I enjoyed it with coffee. Yummy! I will make these again for my upcoming All Girls Tea Party. Thank you for sharing.

Yummy scones....great with coffee or tea!  I was out of butter - used margarine and they still came out great!  I made a glaze by mixing powdered sugar and orange juice until it was a nice drizzly consistency and lightly added it on with a fork - make it a bit sweeter - good with or without it!  Also followed the 8T of butter and 8T of juice or milk - I used milk, but for the 8th T I used 2 tsp of milk and 1 of orange extract - perfect orange flavor and perfect consistency...a bit sticky but typical for a scone mixture.  Use a juice glass for a cutter - it actually made 14 little round scones.....they were a hit at brunch!  Thank you!

Not a fan.  The chocolate chips covered up the classic scone taste.  Overall though, very easy to make- no kneeding- and you can definately taste the orange essence as well.  I used 1/3 cup regular sized chocolate chips- If I ever make again, I will use milk chocolate chips instead of semi sweet.

I think these were excellent, and the orange juice gave them lots of flavor.  The only problem I found was that there didn't seem to be enough liquid and I had to add a little more then the recipe called for.

these are really simple and easy to make. I did substitute milk for the OJ. I used 4TBSP of milk and 8 TBSP of butter. I used regular size chips too.
They are so tasty! Thanks for the recipe.

I think you "knead" to use common sense where the liquid is concerned.  I only added 1-2 T of o-juice and it was a tad sticky to pat out.  But the extra juice really punched up the orange flavor, a bit too much in my oppinion.  Next time, and there will be a next time, I will add milk for any extra liquid.  I also used a glass to cut out the scones.  They were light and a little crumbly  Thanks, Holly, for a great recipe!

These are WONDERFUL!  You will need to add more liquid (I just added more OJ). I also added some orange peel, for a little extra zing.  These went very quickly at work.

Read and follow the reviews on this one. It is necessary to add enough extra orange juice to get the dough to a rolling consistency. I altered the recipe for 50 servings, threw in extra orange zest and juice and they were absolutely wonderful.
The orange flavor blends so well with chocolate. Thanks for this one, Holly!

This recipe tastes great, but the liquid stated by it was inaccurate.  I had to use a lot more (over 3x more) than it called for in order to get a workable dough.

These were really good. I was looking for something similar to the consistancy of Starbuck's scones. While I didn't make these as thick as SB's, they were wonderful. I used Brumble & Brown yogurt, about 7 tablespoons, and Craisons. Very good.

I should have read all the reviews. I usually do). My scones came out really dry. I had to scrunch them up into balls to get the "dough" to stick together. I should have known to add milk, but I didn't. That said, the scones tasted very good anyway, kind of like a shortbread cookie.

I put this recipe in my recipe box before it was reviewed so I didn't see the other suggestions about adding more orange juice. We might try these again adding more liquid as suggested. However, made as the recipe is written, they were difficult to make. There wasn't enough liquid so the dough just crumbled. We had to keep mixing and pressing the dough to get it molded and then it still crumbled a good deal while baking. Nice, very sweet flavor, but definitely needed more liquid.

Wonderful scones!  Added the extra butter and juice as others suggested.  Since many were talking of not having enough of the orange flavor...I used the frozen 'condensed' orange juice and only diluted with a little bit of water (1 can I poured into pitcher and added 1 can water..then measured out what I need for scones before I finished making the juice in the pitcher).  Recipe was wonderful.  This was my 2nd recipe I tried and will not need to look further.  Had just a hint of the orange flavor, but not overpowering for the chocolate chips.  My husband and one of my children are VERY picky eaters and the scones were gone before the end of the day.  Made again the next day for friends I picked up at the airport from Scotland and they loved them also.  They said my fancy scones tasted great although I needed to roll dough a little thicker.  Anyone looking for a scone recipe should try this one first, with the added adjustments of butter & juice and to find a way to add a little extra orange flavor like others did or I did.  Thanks to all who left suggestions/ratings.  So helpful when many people do so.  Did I say this recipe was wonderful yet?

I've made these scones at least 4 times and they are wonderful. I use about 8 tablespoons of OJ and also add the zest of one orange for extra orange flavor. I just shape by hand rather use a biscuit cutter...I think they look nicer.

My review is for the recipe as written.  There isn’t enough liquid to form a dough and orange juice doesn’t add much flavor. I suggest doubling the liquid (orange juice and/or heavy cream) and adding orange extract or Grand Marnier. I had to overwork the dough to get it to come together and it affected the texture.

I doubled the orange and put 1/3 cup of both cranberries and chocolate chips. Otherwise the recipe is great.

I like this recipe.  It is simple with few ingredients.  It comes out tasty.  I pretty much follow the recipe as it is and maybe add just a bit more OJ, but I do like my scones crumbly so I try not to over moisten it.  It does help if you use your hands to mix the dough then you wind up needing less OJ or Butter.  I gave it four stars because it is not the absolute best tasting scone I've ever had, just above average.  However, the easy of making it makes it a good recipe for me and you can also add other ingredients if you like such as chopped nuts or fruit.  I also do not go through the whole rolling the dough and the cookie cutter.  I just pat them down on the backing sheet into relatively the same size and thickness as described in the recipe.

This was really a fun, easy recipe for me to use. That being said, I recommend using more orange juice than the recommended amount.  Everything  else seemed to fall into place!

Halved the recipe, substituted dried apricots for chocolate chips. Took others advice and added orange zest and additional orange juice.

As suggested I used 8 tbsp of butter and about 8 tbsp of orange juice. 
instead of chocolate chips I used milk chocolate bar that I cut into small squares and also fresh squeezed my orange juice. I also grated my butter and left in the freezer while prepping the rest of the recipe. Oh my! 
It was the best scone I have ever had! Who knew scones could be even more amazing then the ones I usually get at bakeries.. My husband didin't like scones just till now! He loved it!It was flaky and crispy on the outside and warm and fluffy inside!! The orange juice really did add a magical flavor. Thank you for the recipe!

When I made the modifications suggested above (i.e., used 8 ounces of juice and 8 ounces of butter), the batter/dough become  a bit too moist to handle.  My trusty muffin pan saved the day.  I put the dough into cupcake liners and baked it for about 16 minutes.   The flavor and texture was wonderful!!!!

I gave this recipe 3 stars, because it did not come out in a scone consistency. It was more like a muffin top. This was probably from all the extra oj I used to get it into a batter. The way it came was before adding extra oj was very powdery. I will say though taste wise it was very good!

So yummy. Since I'm gluten intolerant, made these with gluten free flour mix, added some spices, and like others increased butter & OJ (plus a tiny bit of almond milk). Turned out wonderfully, finally, baked goods I can eat! Had them with butter, strawberry jam and coffee for my Sunday breakfast. Will be my go-to recipe since you can change the recipe up so easily - hmm maple walnut, chocolate cherry, cranberry orange, lemon almond, too many choices!

Loved these scones. So simple to make and no off beat ingredients. Did use 6TBSP of O.J. instead of three and 8 TBSP of butter instead of five. Still looked a little dry but did hold together and were not dry in the end.

Used more butter and oj to get the right consistency. I halved the recipe, cut them into triangles and had 6 delicious scones. Used my food processor was very easy. Next time I will top them with cinnamon and sugar and put in more orange zest. I will be making these scones again soon.

Excellent! I did the recommended changes to 5 T. butter and doubling the orange juice and it turned out great! I also didn't have chocolate chips so used coconut instead and will definitely use this recipes again. Thanks!

Very very VERY yummy scone recipe. I put 8 Tb of butter and 8 Tb of orange juice to moisten the recipe up a bit. Also added orange zest of half an orange, just like Trina suggested. I rolled the dough to about 1/2" and cut into triangles. Sprinkled a little sugar on top before putting in the oven. My husband and I LOVE them!

I have made these for years.  Very good!  I also make these by using the juice of one lemon and its zest instead of the OJ.  I think I've come to like the lemon better.  I've also begun to add a few pinches of sugar on top before baking.... YUMMO!!But it's what ever you like.  Thanks for posting!

I am a scone snob and have been using the same recipe for years! After making these for my family last night, I have thrown my old recipe away. These are amazing. Light and flaky but rich and moist at the same time. I added 2 Tbsp more orange juice until I got the consistency I was happy with. Can't wait to make them again!!!

Loved these and I took someone else's advice and used 8TBS of butter and 8 TBS of orange juice as well as the zest of half an orange - so worth it!  YUM.  I'm gonna have a hard time not eating the whole batch right now.

Have made these several times. I use a food processor to mix the dry ingredients, then add the cold butter cubes till they are like small peas. (I always need to use a stick of butter and about 6 tbs of OJ). I add the chips at this point then transfer the mix to a big metal bowl where I add the OJ and stir with a fork until it comes together. I knead by hand a little until it all comes together. I use a small ice cream scoop and put them on parchment lined baking sheet. I pat them down a little with moist hands and sprinkle sanding sugar on top. Bake till golden. They are great.

After months of searching and trying many scone recipes, this one is a keeper!  It's simple and very tasty.  I did have to add quite a bit more orange juice to make the dough easier to work with.  Love these scones!

Of the three types of scones I brought to the Garden Party, these were the highest-rated.  Not sure how much was the texture and how much was the chocolate, but people loved these.

Amazing! I followed the directions exactly and had no problems, although bakers should note that after adding the OJ, you have to use your hands to mix and form the dough. To keep your scones light and flaky, mix quickly and not too much - the heat of your hands melts the butter and makes the dough heavy.

The husband and kids ate these up in just two days and have begged for more. I'm not usually a baker, so I was highly impressed this recipe made be look so accomplished!

These were delicious!  I was expecting more orange flavor, though.  Next time I'll add some orange zest, I think.  I also sprinkled them with sugar and almonds before baking.  I used a pizza cutter to cut them after I patted the dough in a circle to make equal biscuits!  So easy!

Great recipe with some modifications.  I used 8 Tbsp of butter and quite a bit more orange juice than called for, though just enough to bring it together as a dry dough. I also added about 1 Tbsp of orange zest for flavor. The texture was very flaky and the orange flavor was subtle but great.

Love these!!  I don't change a thing.  Though I notice I never get 12 scones out of the batter.  More like 8-9.  I like to add toffee bits to the mixture as well.

LOVE this recipe! I did make 2 changes. I increased the butter to 8 tablespoons. Also, I don't like orange juice so I used cran-strawberry juice instead (1/2 cup). So good! Will definitely make again!

These are very yummy! Like many others have stated you need to increase the amount of orange juice. I used 7-8 tablespoons. Also, I increased the butter to 7 T. I can't wait to try them with dried cranberries!

I have made this recipe many times over the past 5 years.  I've tried a lot of other scone recipes, but we always keep coming back to this one, it is definitely the family favorite.  I've noticed that sometimes I need to add a little extra orange juice, depending on the humidity.  Thank you so much for the recipe, it is a lovely treat for us!

I had to bake breakfast goodies for a group of 25 people every day for a week.  I brought some fantastic yeast cinnamon rolls and a large variety of these scones. The cinnamon rolls lasted several days, but the scones were picked off at the end of every single day.  And people requested the scones again and again. When I made them according to the recipe, I thought they were too dry, so I finally settled on the 8T of butter, and 8T of orange juice that others recommended.  They were sticky, but I just added a dusting of flower to make them easier to handle.  I mixed them by hand originally, but got lazy and began using my food processor, which chopped up the chocolate chips into smaller pieces.  Several people noted they liked the chopped chips version better.  Great for me--they are less work! But this recipe is a real crowd pleaser.

These scones tasted wonderful and their texture was so fluffy and soft! But just like everyone else said, it's gonna need a few more tablespoons of orange juice. I added a teaspoon of milk as well. Don't be worried about the orange taste if you add more. It's not even noticeable. GREAT RECIPE!

Like many others mentioned, I had to add some extra orange juice, but these are awesome!  Super easy to make, as a college student low on cooking equipment I usually just squish the butter in with my hands rather than cutting, I've found this works better than a fork.  My roommates always try to eat them all before I can get any! :)

It's amazing how dry this recipe is. I added extra OJ and milk and it came out okay. Also needed a little extra baking time. I find it hard to believe that anyone can make this recipe as it is stated and have an edible scone. Next time I will use yogurt in the recipe, which is how I usually make scones.

I did change a few things.  I used 1 stick margarine, 1/8 tsp cinnamon, and 5 tablespoons orange juice, and used the bigger chocolate chips.  It turned out lovely. New breakfast item in our house.  My son had to make scones for his culture project on Ireland.  He loved them so much, he came home and and made another batch so he could have some for snack and breakfast.

I went to a restaurant with my daughter and had scones and we loved them, so we decided to try to make them.  This recipe tasted even better than the ones at the restaurant!  My only suggestion to whoever makes this, is to add cinnamon for an even better taste.

I played around with this recipe a bit. I added 1/2 tb of vanilla extract and added 2 additional tbs of oj. I also used 2 tb of apple sauce and 3 tb of butter just to cut down on the fat. I also added 2 tbs of unsweetened cocoa powder and added 1/3 cup splenda baking sugar instead of real sugar. I did this this to save on calories. Even with all the modifications this recipe is still top notch. on of the best out there.

A friend originally gave me this recipe, and I'm glad to have found it here! I've made these many times, and they turn out nicely. I always recieve lots of compliments for these. The only drawback to these is that they sometimes turn out dry. I may experiment with some other scone recipes, but I'll most likely continue with this one. Thank you!

These scones are very yummy! I didn't have any OJ in the house so I substituted it with a mixture of 1/2 cup of milk and 1 egg and poured until it blended into a nice doughy texture. They still turned out fabulous! The mini chocolate chips are a great addition!

I had never baked (or eaten) scones before, so I didn't know what to expect.  I would describe these as incredibly dense, orange-flavored chocolate chip cookies that, for some reason, remind me of Christmas.  Other than cutting in the butter (which took forever), they were easy to make.  I did add more orange juice, as recommended, and also about 1/4 c. of extra chocolate chips.  The only problem I had was figuring out when they were cooked; I had assumed they would turn golden brown, like cookies, but they don't!  I left my first batch in too long and the bottoms burned.  Other than that, I loved the recipe and will definitely make these again.  Thanks!

These scones were delicious! Our guests ate them all right away; I made another batch two days later and those disappeared immediately also. This recipe is a hit! Oh, one change: I didn't have orange juice so I used milk instead, they still came out wonderful.

These were very good, like other reviewers I used 8T orange juice and 8T of butter plus the zest off of about 3/4 of the orange which gave a very nice orange flavor. I used regular size chocolate chips which worked just fine. I rolled the dough out then used a pizza cutter to cut into 8 triangles and then laid the triangles out onto the cookie sheet to bake.  Will make again!

Very tasty scone.  When I've made them I put a few more chocolate chips, my husband is a chocolate nut.  Also, I add a little more OJ than the recipe says, otherwise the dough is too dry and doesn't form well.  Super easy to make and delicious.

Try the Simple Scones recipe from this web site and substitute mini-choc-chips for the raisins.  It's much better and does not require changes to the recipe.  To make this one easier, just cut into wedges and bake in a pie shape.

these are very good--i make them in the more traditional scone shape by rolling out a 9-inch round and cutting it into 12 wedges.

Very good scones. They were a little denser than desired, but that was likely because I didn't read many reviews before making and as such didn't have enough extra orange juice. Instead of cutting the butter in, I had some frozen butter that I grated into the dry ingredients using the larger holes on a box grater. I then stirred in 2/3 cup dark chocolate chips, 1 tsp orange zest, and 1/3 cup OJ. I ended up having to add almost another 1/3 cup water (I ran out of oranges!), so the dough got stirred more than I would have liked. I flattened it to about a 9" circle and cut it into 12 wedges. 13 minutes later, awesome scones. Next time, I'll add a bit more butter and definitely more liquid. Thanks for sharing, Marbalet! :)

I can't bake to save my life and these turned out great! I used 6 Tbsp of butter and probably 4 Tbsp of OJ. Didn't roll them or shape them, just dropped in clumps on the pan.

To be fair, I only used the base recipe and a few hints from others.  I used 8 tbsp butter, 2 oz o.j., 2 or 3 oz half and half, 1 tsp orange zest, 1/3 cup rehydrated dried cranberries & 1/4 cup chopped walnuts (I don't like chocolate & orange together).  I sprinkled them lightly with sugar before baking.  I don't know when I have had a better scone!  Thank you for the inspiration!

Loved these!  Didn't have chocolate chips so I usd frozen blueberries instead (kept frozen).  I added 3 tbsps of butter as per suggeston of other reviews; I also didn't have any OJ, so I used lemon juice instead and had to add three or four extra tblsps of milk as it the recipe was too dry (especially as I dropped onto cookie sheeet rather than roll it out)  I substituted whole wheat flour and sprinkled sugar on top before baking...delicious...will definately use recipe again!

This is the easiest recipe.  It is also the lowest in fat for scones.  If I'm out of OJ, I use milk...I just add a little more sugar.  I've used organic cane sugar in place of regular sugar, I've cut the butter back, and I've used organic flour.  Sprinkling a little sugar on the top also adds a nice touch

Me and my friend made these one morning for my father, and ourselves, to enjoy... since we love scones so much. This was our first attempt at making them, and it was so enjoyable and easy! 

The orange juice didn't leave a very strong taste, but it did make it unique from any other scone I had tasted. 

Overall, easy and tasty!

After trying to find the best scones recipe for Christmas this year, this is it!  Some recipes I've tried have been either too hard or too muffin-like, but this one is just right.  I used dark chocolate chips and lactose-free margarine and they were delicious.  I also brushed a bit of orange juice on the tops of the scones before I baked them.  Thanks so much for this recipe!

I too had to edit the recipe to: 8 TBSP butter, 6 TBSP orange juice + 2 TBSP skim milk (I ran out of orange juice), 1 tsp vanilla, and 1 tsp orange zest.  I also brushed milk on the unbaked scones & sprinkled with sugar.  I rolled dough to 1/2" thick and made 8 scones. These are EXCELLENT and will definitely make again.  The only reason I didn't rate this 5 stars was because I had to edit the liquid & fat.  Other than that, this is definitely a wonderful base recipe.

I add a lot more chocolate--I chop up good quality bittersweet--and add more orange juice. Awesome scones!

these were very good the only reason for the 4 star is the tinkering needed with the liquid. I added more oj to get the right consistancy, and 1/4 tsp of cinnamon, some orange zest, and 60% cacao chips. I will give these as gifts they are so good!

Good recipe but as others have said, the quantities are a bit off.  I used 8 tbsp butter and 6 tbsp milk (didn't think the kids would like it with orange juice, they can be fussy).  Kids absolutely loved them.

Excellent recipe. I had not made scones before but they taste delicious.  Did not have mini chips so used regular.  Also took 6 Tbsp of orange juice and added a tsp of vanilla.

These scones are simply delicious! I made the recipe modifications suggested by other users, and they turned out fabulously. I am new to baking, and this was the first time I ever tried scones, and even I couldn't mess them up. I'm very critical of my own cooking, but couldn't find anything wrong with these, and my boyfriend enjoyed them as well. They also keep surprisingly well when wrapped in foil.

AWESOME! Needed something "old English" for a school project and these were a hit. Wasn't much of a scone fan before, but I will definitely be making these again! Only thing I found was that I needed a teensy bit more orange juice than it said to make it doughy enough to roll out, but it wasn't a big deal.
Thanks for this great recipe!

These scones remind me of the ones from a certain gourmet coffee shop, but they came from my kitchen!  I used shortening because that was what I had on hand, and I also needed extra liquid to make the dough.  I'm thrilled with this recipe.  Thank you for sharing!

These were fantastic!  The first few bites seemed wierd but I became accustomed to the taste (orange and chocolate...).  I used 1 cup of whole wheat flour and 3/4 cup regular flour.  I found that I did have to add 2 tbsp. of liquid onto what the recipe called for.  I tried to form into a ball before adding liquid to find that it didn't stick together at all.  I also used milk chocolate chips, I don't buy semi-sweet.  Wonderful recipe, one that I'll be using for a long time!!

I'm not a baker, but these scones turned out really well.  They had great taste, next time I will use milk chocolate chips.  I also used a glass to cut out the scones as suggested.
Thanks!

These are the best scones I've made yet! I used 8 Tbsp regular margarine and 12 Tbsp of orange juice (freshly squeezed).  I patted the dough to 1/2" thick and scored it into 8 sections right on the cookie sheet.

 Lastly, I made an icing of powdered sugar, orange juice and a bit of corn starch for extra "yum factor."  I lightly drizzled each scone with the mixture by letting it drip from a fork. These rocked! They are my husband's new favorite and they are "pretty" to boot! I highly recommend this recipe.

I made these this AM and think they are great!!!  I DID however make some minor changes.  After reading a lot of the reviews, I did alter the OJ and add some peel.  To make them a little healthier for the 1 3/4 cups flour, combine a mixture of ground flaxseed and kamut flour.  They have a great consistency and a nutty kind a flavor.  I also melted some chocolate chips and piped in on the top.  Yummy!!!  Thanks for the base recipe, the OJ and chocolate are great together!

These were WAY too dry.  I even added 3 extra tablespoons of orang juice, but they were still so cry they crumbled while I was trying to shape them.  The taste was pretty good after they baked, though.

These are delicious and very flexible.  For extra taste, I would try vanilla extract or almond extract, dried cherries, golden raisins... the possibilities are endless!

I too added more butter (8 TBSP. total) and took some advise in another review...used 1/2 c. of 1% milk in place of the oj.  I threw in 1 teaspoon of cherry extract just to experiment. Oh....yummy!  I've also made the recipe with oj, but will add orange zest next time (as others have done) because I didn't taste as much of the orange flavor as I would have liked.  All in all, molto gustoso!  Bravo!

I didn't have any orange juice, but milk worked great! I definetely needed more than 3 tbsps, and I added more but I'm not sure how much. I just added until it looked about right. I also added a few dashes of cinnamon for the heck of it, but I don't think it makes much difference. I hand-shaped them and I think they were in for 15 minutes instead of 12. When I tasted them they weren't too dry, and I was surprised that my first time making scones didn't turn out badly. Thanks!

Light, moist and delicious!  My kids went crazy for them.  I followed others' suggestions and increased the amount of butter to 7 TBSP (actually I used Parkay light margarine and the recipe was still terrific) and I used 8 TBSP of OJ.  We will make these again.

This is a great recipe for chocolate chip scones. I added an extra 1/4 cup of sugar due to an individuals taste. I also brushed the tops of the scones with orange juice & sprinkled them with sugar.
I make about 50 of these scones twice a year for  formal teas we have at a local non profit. They are a hit every time.

I used the guidelines from this recipe but replaced chocolate chips for raisins and  milk instead of juice. I haven't quite got the milk ratio right yet (3 tablespoons is not enough) because they are a bit dry and crumbly. I also did blueberries and milk with just a little lemon juice.

I added more orange juice because the dough was a little bit dry. I also cut them smaller and took them out after 11-12 minutes.

I had to add 10 tablespoons of orange juice and I used a little extra butter with 1 to 1 GF All purpose flour. Very addictive, they disappeared fast.

SO GOOD! You do have to keep adding OJ, though. I added like an extra half cup of OJ. They are especially good warm, because the chocolate chips are ooey and gooey just like when Mom made chocolate chip cookies.

I didn't try making the original recipe as it was entirely too dry to even form a dough for me. I took the advice posted and upped the butter to 8tbsp. and used about 6 tbsp. of orange juice instead. I pressed mine down to make sure they would cook evenly so they were slightly flat but the flavor and texture were amazing!

Added an extra tablespoon of butter and two extra of orange juice and they were perfect!!!!  These were supposed to be brought to brunch.... However, they didn't make it there.

Surprisingly really good! I went ahead and used a whole stick of butter (1/2 cup) and about 5 extra tbsp of OJ by adding about 2 tbsp extra at a time until it formed into a dough.

Wow. This recipe is fantastic. I looked at some other reviews and ultimately decided to go with 8 Tbsp butter and almost 4 Tbsp OJ and zest. (I used half an orange.) I *may* have slipped in some extra chocolate chips too. The mixture was very dry but workable -- I handpacked each scone. I baked them a little longer (maybe 2 min or so) but the end result was amazing. No better compliment to my morning coffee.

I love these and so do my kids. They are so simple and you can actually prep the dry ingredients ahead of time and have them ready to go in in minutes.  I have had to double the amount of juice because I think the dough is to dry and I don't want to over mix them.  I make a double batch and my kids will have them for breakfast several days in a row and still ask for more.

I made the scones. They were very good. The first time I made them I fell in love with them. The second time I made them I miss something up and they were dry and crumbly and didn't turn out well. Now that I have acid reflux I have to find a different recipe because the orange juice bothers me.

Absolutely delicious.  I added the 1/2 cup of butter (8 tbsp) and 1/2 cup of orange juice (8 tbsp) as suggested.  My boys also like a little sugar on top so I brushed some milk on top and sprinkled sugar on.  Huge hit in my house.

Like other reviewers, I needed to add more orange juice to get the batter to bind.  I am not a huge scone connoisseur so I have no idea if these are proper "scones" or not, but they are delicious, so what I AM certain about is that I'll be making them again.

These are definitely one of my favorite scones! The only thing that i would change is the amount of of orange juice it takes to make the dough form. Every time i use over twice as much as what it calls for. But other than that --Delicious!

4.5 stars!!

I cannot give this a full 5 stars because of how much modifying I had to do to the recipe--like other reviewers, I added extra orange juice and butter in order to not end up with a bowl of flour. In total, I added seven tablespoons of butter and 8 tablespoons of orange juice. I was worried about the scones coming out poorly....
But my family loved them! My mom was particularly impressed, and in terms of taste and texture, gave them 5 stars.
All in all, I do recommend this recipe, but only with modifications--otherwise it is just too dry to even form into dough!

I added 7Tbsp butter and 6Tbsp orange juice (total amounts). The trick with getting the scones light and fluffy is mixing / handling the dough AS LITTLE AS POSSIBLE. I used my hands to mix the butter / dry ingredients mixture, and then used a spoon to quickly mix in the orange juice & chocolate chips (stirring only for a total of about 10 seconds). Then right away spooned out onto parchment paper and formed into an (approximately) 2-inch tall round, cut into 8 pieces (pie style), separated the pieces out so they would cook evenly, and baked at 400 for about 14-15 minutes total. MMM! I rated 4 stars only because I had to change the amounts. The flavor was delicious though!

These were a hit at my family get together! Most ate two or more! I did add more orange juice than the recipe called for -- likely double the amount. I found the dough too dry after adding the specified amount of three tablespoons. So I added more o.j., kneaded the dough more, added more o.j., and then kneaded more. I also didn't have a scone pan, so I rolled each piece into a ball and then flattened them on the cookie sheet. They baked beautifully!

As with most reviewers I had to add additional orange juice, but I think I added more than needed, next time I think 6 TBS will be plenty.  It had a nice orange flavor and the texture was pleasant.  I'm going to make them again very soon - this time with dried cranberries.

The recipe was dry so I added about another 3 tablespoons of orange juice. I added the zest of the orange I used for the juice and I added a quarter cup of plain yogurt....I used salted butter and sea-salt course crystals instead of regular salt. Served with blueberries and plain yogurt and then put them in the oven after flattening the dough to about 3/4 inch and cutting into eight wedges. I separated them before baking. This recipe was amazing..everything I like about scones!

I've made this recipe twice, with some changes, and got yummy, great results. The first time, I followed the recipe exactly, except like many other reviewers, added extra orange juice a little at a time until the dough formed a moist ball. Rolled out and baked as directed resulted in a tender, subtly orange scone with pops of chocolate (I used half semi-sweet chips, half dark chocolate chips). The second time I made them, I substituted a 1/2 cup of the flour for cocoa powder to get orange chocolate chocolate chip scones....BOMB!

Taste-wise and texture-wise, these are superb. I used 8 tbs butter and 8 tbs oj, and the dough was perfect. They came out flaky and delicious. My only issue was that they barely rose at all - they do look more like cookies than scones. Next time I may try adding more baking powder.

Recipe requires changes. I had to add a lot of extra orange juice (like many others) and then I finally added some egg white and it finally stuck together.
It tasted good in the end, but wasn't the recipe

I tried this recipe and it is a very good basic scone recipe. She forgot to mention what to do with the sugar so I just put it in the flour mix. It took twice the amount of orange juice she listed to make the dough and I added 6 minutes to the bake time to get the nice holden brown color as well. I used cruising in place of the chocolate chips and I added the zest from the orange, the flavor was delicious! I will use it again with the changes I've made.

What's not to like about flaky-but-heavy scones and chocolate chips?  Don't scrimp; buy quality chocolate chips (I used Ghiradelli).  We loved this recipe and I will bake my own scones from now on.  One tip:  I formed a large round and cut out slices, like a pizza.  Those little edges crisp up a bit, and they're fun to dunk in coffee or tea.

Oh my gosh, I baked this just now and it turned out superb! I can eat it as is! But it turned out twice as superb when I made my home made Lemon Curd. Combine the orange taste with lemon and goodness, you won't stop taking a bite!  For me, this is best with tea GOODNESS! So addicting! Thank you for submitting this recipe!

Wanted a chocolate chip scone. Don't like the orange, so used buttermilk for the liquid. Kept adding until it was a dough that could be cut out. Nice sweetness. I think I would cut small triangles instead of rounds. More scone-like, less biscuit-like. The mini chips are perfect. I would make again for sure!

I am so pleased how these turned out! I never knew how easy it is to make scones. I used 8 TB OJ, a few tablespoons less sugar, extra chocolate chips, dash of cinnamon and dash of nutmeg. 

I didn't need to use extra butter, the dough was crumbly enough with the amount stated in recipe. I can't wait to try this recipe with blueberries next! Try it, you will not regret it.

I used extra butter and orange juice like other reviewers suggested. Used ghiradelli milk chocolate chips and chopped them up and of course used more. Turned out super moist.  Was worried they would be too orange tasting but they weren't at all. Next time I may add a little milk instead of more oj.  Great!!!!

I have always wanted to make scones but felt intimidated. This recipe seemed so easy so I gave it a try. It was easy and yummy too. I only got 9 scones out of the recipe, not sure why, and I ended up using the juice of 2 oranges. Next time I will double the recipe.

I am not sure IF and what my son did wrong with the recipe, but I ended up adding another tbsp. of butter and an extra tbsp. of milk (we used milk instead of OJ).  I absolutely loved the scones.  I really look forward to trying it with some cranberries and white chocolate chips OR even adding pecans to this recipe.  Also, I used a small Pampered Chef rolling pin and pressed the dough into a 9x9 glass dish.  I cut it into quarters, then cut three triangles into each quarter.  I took the triangles out and placed them on a greased cookie sheet.  It was so easy!

These scones were delicious but for one reason: I have baking experience and didn't follow the recipe exactly. 

I had to double (at least) the amount of orange juice. I later read the reviews, and so did everyone else. Many made other adjustments too, such as adding more butter too, but I feel they were fine with about double the oj.

I did like it very much.  My hubby and son thought they were perfectly sweet with a great texture.  HOWEVER - I did do a few things sorta differently due to ingredients and prior scone making experience - 8Tbspn of butter (if salted, reduce the salt in recipe by 1/2) cut into pea size chunks and 'pinched' into the flour mixture by hand.  Then I used semi sweet chocolate chopped coarsely instead of chips and used 4Tbspn of OJ AND 3 TBspn of 1/2 & 1/2 or heavy cream.  Made a large round circle and cut into triangles and separated before baking.  YUM!!!!!!!

I altered this recipe based on the suggestions of a former reviewer, Trina, as she had given this recipe a 5-star rating. She suggested increasing the butter to 8 TBSP., OJ to 8 TBSP., and included the zest of half an orange.  It was awesome.  I enjoy the orange scones from Panera.  This recipe is wonderful and almost identical to Panera's if you leave out the chocolate chips and make the changes I have included.  I also created an orange glaze for the scones.  This scone recipe is a great base for variations of flavors.  One of the best recipes I have accessed from the Internet and was not disappointed in the least!

Great Scones! Like most of the reviews mention, I did have to double the OJ.  I also added orange zest and 1 table spoon of cointreau (keeping with orange theme).

These are fabulous! I've never made scones before and I'm so glad they aren't brick-like. In spite of my worries I decided they were worth a shot and I'm so glad I made them. I added the juice of two small oranges and some zest since the dough was very dry. Since I've never made scones, I didn't know if I was just supposed to work with the dough and that it would still work out, but I simply added more juice. I also added some sliced almonds because I wanted some protein in them. This is a very good recipe. Thank you!

I thought this was excellent! I made it two ways; Raspberry and white chocolate and COFFEE and chocolate chip. I mean, SO GOOD. Also, I did use the 8T butter and 8T OJ. Of course, I didn't use OJ in the coffee ones. I just used 8T of strong coffee, chilled instead. This makes a pretty flakey and slightly moist scone (but not like a muffin). If you like drier/crummy scones maybe "no" on the extra stuff.

Amazing.  I was intimidated at first, since I've never made a scone before.  BUT, this is super easy and delicious.  Followed advice and used 8 tbsp of OJ and 8 tbsp of salted butter (and omitted salt from recipe).  I also made a simple orange glaze (1 cup powdered sugar/1.5 tbsp OJ) and drizzled it on top.  YUM!

turned out really well. Although I did add 1 egg, 1/4 cup walnuts, and 1 tsp. vanilla extract. mine were very cake like, which might have been because of the egg, or not enough cooking time.

I substituted brown sugar for white sugar and it turned out amazing. If the mixture is a bit too dry to form into scones I add a splash of milk. Overall a great recipe!!

I didn't read the reviews before I fixed these, so was shocked at how little liquid was added to the flour mixture when I got to that stage.  I was low on o.j. so I drizzled in fat-free half and half (approx. 1/4 I would guess).  It then made a wonderful dough and the scones came out sweet and delicious.  Next time I will have plenty o.j. on hand to make them even better, I'm sure.  After this adjustment, this recipe is a keeper!

This recipe does not call for enough liquid, I added enough orange juice to suffice. I used orange/mango juice and it was a nice addition to the choc. chips. My family loved these and they are quick and easy to make. We enjoy scones with coffee almost every morning.

2 out of 3 of us thought these are ok but nothing special. Hubby won't eat them. They'd probably be better with fruit and nuts- this from a chocoholic!  Texture was good, was the taste that wasn't the best. There are better recipes on this site... went with 6 T's OJ.

I used a whole stick of butter (8 tbs) which helped tremendously. Also, I didn't have OJ in the house, so I used V8 Fusion Tropical Orange Juice. I also added 1 tsp of vanilla. I flattened the dough out into a square, 1/2 inch thick, and cut it with a pastry scraper into 12 little squares. Turned out yummy! The only reason why I gave it 4 instead of 5 is not based on taste- its because I like my scones with some volume, while these were pretty flat.

These were the best scones I have ever had! I was worried about using the orange juice, so I only used 2 tablespoons and the rest milk, and I did not get a fruity flavor at all. They just turned out flakey and DELICIOUS! Thanks for the recipe :)

Very good recipe, but I, like most others, had to do some minor tweaks to the recipe.  I had to add about 12 tbsp. of butter, 7 tbsp. of orange juice, and I also added 1/2 tbsp. of vanilla extract.  I also added extra chocolate chips because you can never have enough chocolate!  Overall a great recipe that I will definitely be repeating!

Orange juice makes this taste great!  Not floury tasting like some scones.

My friends and I really enjoyed these scones! I added an extra 3T of butter to get the mixture more crumbly (and because I prefer to use the whole stick). I only had 2T left of orange juice, so I used an extra 2T of milk and they were perfect. The dough should seem a little dry- after all, they're scones. The recipe did make 12 scones, but they were pretty small. Were fantastic with some raspberry preserves!

I am giving this 3 stars because I thought it was a little bland and if I were to make this again I would add something else...I am going to play around with some flavors. I also had to add a 1 tblsp more butter and added more milk...I had no orange juice and I don't think I would have liked these if I added it. On another note my 2 1/2 year old liked them. Thank you!

This has become my most complimented scone recipe!  I followed the advice of others and usually end up adding about 7-8 TB of orange juice. They are so easy and turn out delicious! I add some sugar in the raw to the top before baking to jazz it up too.

Add coconut for a different twist!  Everybody loved these scones!  They were a huge hit - even on day 2!  I also used 8 Tablespoons of OJ and 6-7 T of butter.

I added just a couple of teaspoons more of orange juice, and I used *mandarin* orange juice.   I make this often for my Harry Potter fan group and they are gone before I can blink! I always end up wishing I'd made a third batch for myself and my family!  Also, this is a nice project to do with a teen. My (much) younger sister likes making these with me - we're covered in flour before we're through, but it's fun and the results are delicious.  Definitely the best scones I've ever had - a surprisingly sweet, flavorful version of a snack that is sometimes boring and dull.

Very, very good scones.  I increased the butter and oj to 8 TB of each and the dough was perfect.  Added some finely chopped pecans and they were a big hit with the other moms at the playdate!

Great recipe! Made these this morning and already ate half the batch! I heeded the advice of previous reviewers and added a total of 8 tbs of OJ (after panicking when I noticed I wasn't getting any 'dough') and a total of 5 tbs butter. I decreased sugar to 1/4 cup. I added 2 tbs of wheat germ and can probably increase that next time.  It's a great base recipe and I see myself making different variations for sure!  Thanks!

Very good and easy. I used milk instead of orange juice and had to add more than 3 Tbs. I just kept adding until it became doughy.

I give this 4 stars only because of the liquid issue described by other reviewers.  I was short on orange juice, so used a total of 8 tbs. milk.  This moistened up the dough enough, and they turned out DIVINE. I may try making these with some raspberry jam baked into the middle.  Thanks! :-)

These were EXCELLENT!!! I did add 3 more tbs of the frozen butter and 3 tbs more of orange juice and a tsp of vanilla.I rolled them out, didn't need to flour the surface and I cut them into triangles with a sharp knife.Very easy to make. They were a cross between a biscuit/shortbread texture. Everyone loved them!

As it is, I'd give it 4 stars because I can't imagine what it'd be without the rec'd extra butter and OJ but the taste and texture were wonderful! Really crispy/chewy outside and very moist inside. I added sour cream because I ran out of OJ when I still had tons of free flour and had to bake for much longer to get a beautiful golden color.

Very nice, especially the flavor combo. The orange was not strong enough for me, even though I already added an extra tablespoon of OJ because of the texture. So I will add orange zest when I do this again.
   A year later: can I say again how much I love this recipe (now that I add orange zest every time, and  top it with an orange icing)? It's definitely one of my favorite finds on allrecipes, so thank you again for sharing. I've made it so many times that people associate it with me, so I just thought I would pass the credit back to where it is due. Oh, and I've used dried cranberries and white chocolate in place of the semisweet chocolate which is also delicious! The only problem is that all my British friends say this is not actually a scone. Go figure! Haha!

I made these about four months ago for an international night and they turned out pretty good. I'm sure more would have gone if there weren't so many desserts. I too increased the orange juice to 8 tbls (1/2 cup. I kept every other thing the same though. But be careful-mine burned on the bottom, so I recommend parchment paper.

A very nice recipe with just a few small problems. I did have to add more orange juice like many others, and I found that the finished scones still had a slight flour texture and flavor.

I love love love love this recipe. I've used it twice [it's in the oven now, yay].
The texture is perfect, the taste is irresistible, and one good thing is that all of the ingredients are in my kitchen! I don't need to leave my house to buy sour cream. 

The only thing I did was instead of 3 tbs of OJ, I ended up using 6-7 tbs to get the right dough. 

Nevertheless, the best!!!

These delicious scones were so quick easy to make yet they don't taste "simple." I agree with other reviewers who added more than 3 T of orange juice. I didn't measure, but I added at least twice that amount until I got a nice dough. A new favorite recipe!!!

This is so easy to make.  The first time I made them they were a bit too hard, and I like my scones a bit fluffier, but not like a muffin.  I guess somewhere in between.  The revisions I made was used 1 stick of butter, 1/3 cup orange juice, 2 TBLSP of milk, 1 tsp vanilla, and the zest of half an orange.  I always make this when I get cravings!

These were VERY good! The closest thing I have gotton to bakery/Starbucks scones!
As others have said, you have to at least double the amount of OJ to get a good dough..I just kept adding a bit at a time till it was right. 
I think next time I might sprinkle a little sugar on top when they come out for just a tad extra sweetness!

This was my first time to make scones. These are very good and easy. Glad to see others added more liquid than just the 3T orange juice. I kept adding milk as I had used squeezed orange juice and was out of oranges. I also used Splenda instead of sugar. I couldn't tell the difference. I will make these again.

the scones turned out a little  rubbery and not velvety even though I was careful to not overmix - could not even begin to get mix to form a dough without adding 3-4 more tbs of OJ - will give it another try later.

These were good with a few alterations.  I had to use the juice from 4 oranges to get the dough to form.  No biggie - next time I think I'll add some cinnammon.  I also used 8T of butter.

Very tasty!!  I had to add more liquid to make the dough stick together. To bake them, I just pulled out small portions of dough and patted them down on the baking sheet, sort of like making cookies.

delish!!!  I made a batch, ate one and froze the rest.  I microwave one for 35 sec. and enjoy it with a cup of my morning coffee.  I baked mine in a 9 in. circle and scored it.  Next time I will double the recipe so I have extra in the freezer when company comes over.

I made these this afternoon and my boyfriend and I ate them all. I added the zest of half of the orange and used 60% cocoa chips. They were delicious!! Will make again with apple and cinnamon.

I was dubious of orange juice with chocolate chips, but wow, these were wonderful!!  The texture is melt-in-your-mouth, and the orangey tang is unique.  I measured the 3 tablespoons of juice, but then added enough to make a sticky ball.  Fit for royalty indeed!!

My 10 year old daughter and I made this recipe. We used a couple of tips from "steelergirl05" and "Leslie30". We used milk chocolate chips instead of semi-sweet, added 1/2 tsp. of orange zest to the flour mixture, 2 Tbsp. of milk at the same time as adding the orange juice. We also added 1 Tbsp. of pure vanilla extract. When we rolled out the dough we cut it into 8 wedges.
We will definately be making this again. We took a picture and are going to subit it.

This was an okay recipe.  It was a flop the first time I made it due to adding too much liquid per previous reviewers' suggestions.  I ended up with decent results adding only 4 TBSP of liquid, but they still weren't as good as I was expecting.  I'm still searching for that perfect scone recipe...

I listened to the other reviewers and increased the OJ amount to 8 T.  The scones came out perfectly fine, but no one was really thrilled about the flavor.  And they were also a bit too sweet.

Be sure to increase OJ!  I used about 8T.  I also shaped into two rounds and scored before baking - much easier and still delicious.

Great recipe, but the liquid measurement was way off.  I had to add an extra tbsp of OJ and 2 tsp of milk, then the dough came together alright.

These scones are delicious!  I just made them and am enjoying one with tea at this moment.  Easy, quick and perfectly textured!  I only had white chocolate chips, so I chopped them up and added them - yummy!  I'll make them again for sure.  Thanks for the great recipe!

really good scones.  I used regular chocolate chips instead and rolled out until the dough was as thick as the chocolate chips.  I also used 4 tbs of orange juice so the dough could form better.

I thought this recipe was really good but I made it again without the chocolate chips and it tasted even better. My husband really liked it, especially with the lemon curd recipe in this Allrecipes. I also used whole wheat flour for half of the flour called for and increased the orange juice like suggested.  I added some lemon zest too.

Hi! This is the BEST scone recipe! I did as others have suggested and added more butter & more OJ, no specific amount, just until I feel it is the right consistentcy. Instead of using miniature chocolate chips, I took a half cup of regular sized chocolate chips & chopped them up so they were a little chunkier and also there was chocolate shaving mixed into the dough so when they came out of the oven they had a great texture and a bit of style. I also added some toffee bits & they turned out so delicious. I make them fresh every morning for my partner & I.

Mine turned out a little more like cookies than scones; maybe I did something wrong.  But they tasted scrumptious and we gobbled them up pretty quickly!
