Absolutely the best peanut butter fudge I've ever made.  My Mom, who is a fudge expert, thought it was better than her favorite recipe, and that's saying something!  This fudge is very creamy and has a nice peanut butter flavor.  This fudge is easy to make and would make a great recipe for someone who has never made fudge before.  I plan to make this every Christmas.

I gave this recipe 4 stars because it has a great basic flavor. I do not think I would make it the same exact way again. Next time I will use way less sugar and see how that goes. I might even cut it down to 2 cups. The fudge was far too sweet. I'll update this with the results next time I make it. I have decreased sugar in other fudge recipes with positive results, so I doubt this will be a problem. Also, some of the sugar still seemed to be crystallized, although the fudge set perfectly. Anyone know what causes this?

This is yummy and makes up just like the recipe says.  I used regular peanut butter.  I cooked this to "fudge" temperature on a thermometer and it took exactly 5 minutes.

I received this recipe from a friend in 1983. Every time I make it I receive requests for the recipe and great praise. This is truly a "You can't eat just one! kind of a fudge!!

Did not come out great.  Made two batches--first one was tasty but didn't look smooth.  Second batch was crumbly.  Followed the directions and was disappointed.  Read the reviews prior to trying it so I was surprised at the results.  Really don't like this recipe much at all.  Some of the reviews mentioned that they had been using it for years--interesting because Jif Reduced Fat Spread hasn't been on the market for years.???

This was yummy and very easy to make.  The firmness is perfect, and the consistency is very near so.  I detect just a tiny bit of "grainyness".  It is very similar to the PB fudge my dad used to fix.  I wonder if using regular PB instead of reduced fat would make it even more peanut buttery. I've tried the Aunt Teen's choc fudge 3 times and came up with a hard crumbly mess each time, so I'm glad to see that this came out great.  I suspect it may have something to do with adding the marshmallow creme AFTER boiling the mixture.

I followed the recipe, every detail.  It did not turn out as I expected.  When I let the mixture boil for 5 minutes and then took it off to stir in the peanut butter, it started getting chunky and then I stirred in the marshmallow, it got a little better.  Tastes good, just looks bad.

I made this recipe four or five times before I found out the directions are really just wrong. The taste is great but the directions state to "stir constantly" is all wrong. You only stir when bringing to a boil, then stop. Get a digital thermometer and get it to a minimum temp of 234, max 240. Then just take it off the heat and follow the rest of the directions. This will give you that creamy not grainy smooth fudge.

This one is great!  My mom always used this recipe as I was growing up and I was glad to find it on this site.  The fudge has a great flavor and did not come out grainy.  I will definitely make it again!!!

Made this recipe twice.  Both times the butter separated from the fudge and it became hard.  One batch got sugary.  Need to find a new recipe!

This was a huge hit over Christmas time, especially with the kids!  They were begging for more.  I'm not a peanut butter fan and I really enjoyed it.  I used honey roasted creamy peanut butter vs. just the regular flavor and gave it a more sweeter taste.  I will definitely make it again.  Thanks for sharing.

These taste wonderful! If you love smooth creamy peanut butter, you will LOVE them! The only problem I had was they were a bit to soft - I may have measured something wrong, but none the less, the taste was far worth it! Thank You!

Maybe it was because I used full fat, crunchy peanut butter, but this was not great. It was super greasy and never really hardened. It was hard enough to cut up and serve but still mushy. I would definitely have used less butter if I had known how greasy it would turn out.

My grandchildren, as well as myself loved this fudge! I used regular creamy Jif as I didn't have the reduced fat peanut spread. The kids ask me almost on a daily basis when I'm going to make more. Excellent recipe!

This is the best peanut butter fudge recipe I have found but I will give everyone a hint to making better fudge when it comes to a boil stop stirring it that's what causes the sugar to  crystallize. And I use regular Jiff peanut butter

This never comes out right for me.  Other Peanut Butter fudge recipes do, but never this one.  Always comes out chewy and moldable like taffy.  Flavor is great though.

my first time making fudge ever! and it turned out perfect :) I had to ask my husband to take it into work or I'd eat it all and I'm not a fan of peanut butter. So easy to make and didn't even need to use the candy thermometer I'd bought.

I make this fudge every holiday season.  It's the best recipe for peanut butter fudge I've tried.  It's simple to make and fool-proof.  Delicious.

I have looked for many years to find a PB fudge recipe that was relatively simple. Every one loved this and I made no changes. I did not utilize a timer because I have a candy thermometer.  I did however notice the time and 5 minutes is approximately how long it takes. 
Hints: stir constantly,  don't start the timer until the boil is rapid, use a wooden spoon, have the marshmallow cream and PB measured before beginning, never stop stirring and make sure you stir more quickly once it boils. Lining the pan with parchment or wax paper saves your pan from being scratched.

This was my first attempt at making fudge. I was nervous, but there was no need to be. It turned out perfectly! I did alter a few things. Once the sugar mixture was boiling, I did not stir it. Simply let it boil for five minutes. I also cut the sugar back to two cups.

I choose to make with organic components, and used Skippy Natural instead, simply because I couldn't find Jif! Came out pretty tasty, for my first time making it; just wish recipe said how long it needed to cool before enjoying. Otherwise, very happy with recipe simplicity and first time making it; Thanks!

One of the easiest recipes I have found. Boiled it for 7 mins so it was a soft ball stage. Texture and taste were very good.

This is the best peanut butter fudge I or anyone I know has ever had. No professional stores have ever measured up. I do have two small tweaks to make it perfect. One, I use a candy thermometer to make sure I don’t overcook it. Boil until “soft ball” stage (235 Fahrenheit). Remove from heat. Add the rest of the ingredients. We also found we wanted it to be just a bit more peanut buttery. So we use a full 16oz jar of peanut butter. And you can’t substitute other brands!! I’ve tried. It has to be Jif. 

Thank you so much for this awesome recipe!!

Super simple recipe and very tasty. I made five different kinds and far and above with coworkers and family, this was the favorite. I needed to add powdered sugar to help it set, because of the high altitude, so for those in the same situation, have a bag of powdered sugar on hand.

I made it exactly as written. My husband loved the fudge. I thought it was a little too sweet. I WILL make it again with a little less sugar.

Having never made peanut butter fudge, I found this recipe.  I used regular fat creamy Jif peanut butter as that was what I had.  I put it in 13 x 9 baking dish because I wanted to cut into tiny pieces.  It was wonderful!  Melts in your mouth!  A real hit!  I'll make it again next year.

I used regular peanut butter, and it was so delicious, my daughter ate a whole canister of it, and told me to make more.  She took my other canister and passed it around to everyone she saw.  I ate 3 pieces at a time.  I loved it, and I am making more tomorrow.  I'll only use this recipe from now on.  Thank you

This was very easy and makes a lot.  Also I like that it's very peanut buttery!   Lining the pan with Saran Wrap is the way to go!  I did have one issue and I don't know what I did but the sugar wasn't dissolved all the way.  I followed all directions exactly, too. Not that it will stop me from eating it!  Does anyone know if you can substitute powdered sugar instead of white sugar?
