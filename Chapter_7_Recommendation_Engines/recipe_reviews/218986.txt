Hubby is eating these straight out of the fridge!  We have had them on grilled salmon and burgers and will have them on hot dogs and sandwiches too!  We both prefer paper thin rings instead of chopping the onion. There may be a mistake on the recipe, way too much salt and way too little sugar.  I ended up with 1/2 teaspoon salt and 4 Tablespoons sugar.  And DH is eating them straight from the fridge!  I said that again. . . Thank you Bobi

This is a great recipe.  I loved it first time I made it - second time I used Apple Cider vinegar instead of the Red Wine vinegar... WAY better.  Give it a try - you won't regret it!

I really liked these, but next time I'll make a few changes.  I would add less salt and a bit more sugar, maybe two tablespoons.  Also, I tried these without steeping first and then after they'd steeped...I would skip it if you enjoy a crisper onion.  They were tasty and I plan to refrigerate them until burger-nite in a few days.  Thanks!

I made it exactly as in the recipe and it is tangy but a great addition to a spinach salad with a warm bacon vinaigrette. I also got the warm bacon vinaigrette recipe here too. They are great on sandwiches and even as a tipping on a steak or marinated chicken breasts. Love them.

I agree with "Lucky Noodles", there is too much sugar and not enough salt in these.  I used her idea (1/2 tsp. salt and 4 Tbsp. sugar).  I do like a little of the red wine vinegar in them, but as Tamaralynn stated, they actually taste a better with some apple cider vinegar in the brine. With these adaptations, these are fabulous!

I love these. I first had these when my sister made them from a popular magazine, and now we love to eat them on pork bbq, hot dogs, and hamburgers. They make everything taste unique and great! I used a little bit less salt in mine but I think the total amount would've been fine. Thanks for the recipe :)

Had pickled onions at a restaurant in Cleveland on duck sliders and had to find a recipe similar. This one is pretty close. We made them and put them on bbq hamburgers and they were delicious.

After taking it off of the heat I put a lid on it for the 20 minutes. Incase anyone was confused (as I was) on what steep meant in this particular case. Delicious! Definitely a new favorite.

So my husband requested Mexican posole last night, but with a twist.."pickled red onions"..so this is the recipe I decided on...I've never tasted them before so I had no idea what it should taste like..I followed the recipe exactly as stated but with half the salt it called for and more sugar as the other reviews stated...I appreciate reading other reviews...So, it was a big hit!!!! I am not kidding when I say my 2 year old was eating them right out of the container and my husband loved it!!!...THANK YOU BOBI!!!

Really easy to make and the color is beautiful. I did alter the amount of sugar adding 3 tablespoons and lessened the salt to 1 teaspoon because we are all hypertensive. Next time I'll increase the sugar to 4 tablespoons and add a pinch of red pepper flakes. Great on carnitas!

TOO SALTY! I wish I had read reviews before I made this. I love pickled onions, I've made them before but couldn't find my recipe. I tried this and only after I dumped the 1T of salt did I think, "That seemed like a LOT". Too late, I tried to get some of it out but it was just too salty. I did increase the sugar too, thought it might balance it out, but in the end I had to throw this away. I'm disappointed people rate recipes highly and then comment that they made huge changes to the recipe, that rating is deceptive! I trust the star ratings to believe a recipe will be good. This recipe, as it is written, is not good.

Good but too much salt.  Cut salt in half.  I like them spicy so I added some red pepper flakes.

This was so easy and the onions were great.  Had them on a pizza with bbq pork and hatch chiles and they gave a really nice acidic pop.  (My pizza loving boyfriend deemed it the best pizza he has ever had and he eats a lot of pizza.)

It was edible, but I would not make this again. Way too salty. I have only had these in restaurants and I am used to them being a little sweet with an undetectable level of salt.

I found it to be too salty with 1 1/2 Tbls. of salt. I added more sugar, another onion and more vinegar to tone it down but still seemed  too salty. I'll  cut way back on the salt next time.

Tasty and attractive as a burger topping, but my family and I found it too salty. I will be halving the amount of salt, but will definitely make this again!

This makes an excellent topping for tacos. this recipe does come out a bit sour, which some people love, and others want to sweeten up. A nice variation is to use a combination of orange and lime juice on the blanched onion instead of vinegar (with salt and sugar to taste) - or better yet Seville/bitter orange juice, which is what is used for the original version in Yucatan. believe it or not, it is available in bottles at Walmart in Hispanic areas - usually Badia brand.

Used one red onion cut in half and sliced. Used a bottle of red wine vinegar and approximated other ingredients. Added red pepper flakes and tarragon and garlic. Didn’t boil it. Stuck it in a used mayonnaise jar and left it in the refrigerator over night. Turned out fine.

I’m addicted to  Panara’s arugula and steak sandwich which comes smothered in pickled red onions. I decided to try and make some pickled onions so I can add them to burgers and tacos too. I used this recipe but changed the red wine vinegar to apple cider vinegar as other reviewers recommended and because I love ACV. I tasted after a few hours and they were no where near sweet enough so I added a couple heaping tablespoons of sugar. I continued tasting over the next couple of days and while the flavor was better, they were a lot crunchier than I wanted. I found some other recipes where the onions are blanched first, so I’ll try doing that next time.

I made this exactly as written. It is way too salty. I LOVE salt,  in an unhealthy way, but this will make you cough it's so salty. I will try it with half as much next time. The other flavors are great. I gave it four starts because it is definitely worth making, just with less salt.

These are great, but I prefer them with a few changes. I cut the onion into slivers about 1 inch long. Use 1-1/2 tsp salt, not tablespoons and replace red wine vinegar with white wine vinegar.

Oh, my goodness, this could easily become a new addiction!  After reading reviews, I cut the salt in half, upped the sugar to 4 Tbsp, used apple cider vinegar.  Even with half the salt, I still found them a tad too salty, but still amazing!! I can hardly wait to finish this batch, so I can make more.  Thanks for the great recipe.

I expected the flavor to be more along the lines of other pickled vegetables—a nice tangy vinegar flavor with a balanced sweetness, but this was nothing but salty water with a sharp vinegar bite.

Absolutely loved it! I used apple cider vinegar instead of balsamic only because I didn’t have the balsamic.  Easy recipe and very delicious. Use nightly in my salad-gives extra flavor.

For pickled onions, these are great!  So easy to make, and they are definitely "pickled"!!  These will get eaten in my home, no doubt, but I discovered I am looking for SWEET pickled onions.

We love these. I have tried both red wine vinegar and apple cider vinegar and my crew prefers the apple cider vinegar. We toss these on pork street tacos- absolutely delicious! We have some fairly picky eaters, but our son who picks onions out of his food can’t get enough of the street tacos, and doesn’t go lightly on the onions.

Absoluletly a great addition to salads and sandwiches.  Very peasy to make.  I have developed the habit of keeping a mason jar in fridge most of time.  I do keep the recipe scotch taped to the inside of kitchen cabinet until my brain has it memorized.

These were fantastic on the street tacos that I made this weekend.  The only changes that I made were:  1. I split the 1/2 cup of red wine vinegar up and used 1/4 cup of red wine vinegar and 1/4 cup of apple cider vinegar, and 2. I increased the sugar to 1 tablespoon.  With both of these changes, they were absolutely perfect.  My friends and family were eating the onions by themselves and trying to come up with ideas of other foods that they could put them on.

Way too salty. I like vinegar but these were too much. Needs more sugar. Maybe I need sweet pickled onions.

I sliced my onions not chopped. I dissolved Kosher salt and sugar in the vinegar then added the onions and stored in the fridge.  I stirred them 3 times a day. I love pickled onions.

I used rice vinegar instead and I have used this as a condiment in many Asian dishes.

I will them again but leave out the salt, after reading more recipes I found that they didn't call for salt.

Great onions.....I added a few peppercorns, I would recommend cutting back on the salt. Far to salty for my taste.

This is a simple and great recipe!  I made a few minor changes... I used apple cider vinegar instead of the red wine vinegar, and sherry wine vinegar in place of white (I was out of white).  I did cut the salt a little and added about 1.5T of honey.  I also only steeped for about 10-12 min. They are perfect!  Not too soft, not too much pucker.  I'm not an onion person but was making these to pair with a roasted corn relish for tacos, and I could just eat it as is!  Who needs the taco ;)

This is way to much vinegar and not enough sugar. I wouldn't make again.

I first looked for this recipe after enjoying something similar in a restaurant, and this makes the perfect compliment to a shredded bbq chicken/pork sandwich! So simple yet so good! Recipe perfect as-is.

I followed the recipe ingredients exacty, but I made it in the microwave- they were delicious.  I served them with smoked salmon, capers and a mustard sauce on pumpernickel bread! Yum!!
