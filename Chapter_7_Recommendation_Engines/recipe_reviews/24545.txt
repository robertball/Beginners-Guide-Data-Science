This is similar to a family recipe we have, but we use keebler fudge stripe cookies.  Try them for a little variety!  I will try the sandwich cookies to see how they measure up--- from the reviews, it sounds like it's great! 
Another thing you might try (I always do this) is use low-  or non-fat frozen whipped topping.  I mean, this recipe is killer either way, and the recipe doesn't suffer a bit.

This was really good. I liked the mix of textures and sweetness! I only added half the amount of whipped topping and about 1/4 the required amount of cookies and it turned out great. I think if I added anymore cookies it would have been too sweet.

When this salad appears on the table, I'm very afraid that it'll be gone before I can get to it. Thanks to whomever created this one!  Question: why, when a bad review is written, there aren't fewer stars appearing?

My friends love this, it's requested at every party!  I add one jar of well-drained maraschino cherries, and I use broken fudge-striped shortbread cookies instead of the chocolate sandwich cookies.

Similar to one my mother makes.  I like the cookies being put in right before serving so they're still crunchy.

My aunt has been making this exact recipe, without oranges, for as long as I can remember and it is always a hit, especially with the kids! Don't worry if the pudding seems really stiff, it will work out perfectly once you fold in the cool whip.

This is one of my most favorite recipes.  You can also use a combo of mandarin orange and strawberries, or strawberries and bananas.  YUM.
