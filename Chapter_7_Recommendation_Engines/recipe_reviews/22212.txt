I made this as described, however I boiled the sugar mixture for longer.  I know from having worked with past recipes, candy and fudge making, is that to get up to the right temperature to solidify at room temperature you would need to boil for several minutes.  In fact, I let the sugar/honey mixture boil (while mixing) for about 4-5 minutes.  I had no difficulty with these forming bars at all after boiling for longer than it stated in the recipe.  Although I found the recipe to have a rather strong honey taste my husband and children who are honey lovers really enjoyed it.

During a high-fiber diet phase, I went and bought a box of Kashi Heart Healthy something. (i can't remember the name, but it resembles Cheerios) Well, it was bland.. and this recipe helped me get rid of my extra cereal! I found a few ways to make it healthier. Because the cereal was already flavored honey, and because I ran out, I replaced the honey (other than a few tablespoons) with sugar-free syrup (it's so low-calorie!!!) Next batch I make will be with crunchy natural peanut butter (or the reduced-fat natural kind). I used 1/4 cup of the splenda mix (you're supposed to use half the amount) so it turned out fairly low in sugar and carbs, other than the cereal. The cereal made it HIGH FIBER (yay!) and the peanut butter also made it high in fiber and added protein and omega something. So, not only are these yummy, but they are lower-calorie and nutritious! These are one of my new favorite snacks and I will make them again and again.
Oh, also as soon as I made my first batch and was trying to press it into the pan it only filled up so I decided on the spot I wanted another batch. On the second batch, I didn't remove the saucepan from the heat while adding the peanut butter and it made the liquid darker and thicker (not in a good way) so I would recommend not doing that... I didn't have any problems making it into bars, and I think this recipe is great for making gross but healthy cereals edible!

I was looking for a cereal bar recipe that's fast, easy, and tasty (I'm trying to have more homemade stuff and less prepackaged ). These are fantastic, and I don't even like honey!! I used wheatie puffs (think unsweetened Sugar Smacks. yeah, they're pretty bland), and boiled the honey mix for 3-4 minutes. I think I overdid it, though- the bars came out break-a-tooth-crunchy. But I found a solution (yaaay)! I covered a bar with a damp paper towel, and microwaved it for 20-30 seconds. Then I broke it up into bite-sized pieces and OM NOM NOM'd them good! SCRUMTABULOUS.
EDIT: I boiled the honey/sugar mix for one minute (count 60 mississippis), and it was PERFECTLY chewy-- in fact, the bars stayed chewy for 2 weeks. YUM!

My son has type 1 diabetes so I am always looking for whole grain, high protein snacks and desserts. This one is wonderful and so easy! Since the honey/whole grain combo doesn't cause the high sugar spikes that regular sugar does, this is the ideal way to let him have a sweet treat! To further reduce the carbs, I substituted 1/2 cup of Splenda for the white sugar. It turned out great! All of my kids LOVED it!

I changed ALOT of ingredients when making this, just to my own preference. I used cinnamon toast crunch cereal and added a little bit of chocolate. I kept the rest the same, just used diff. cereal. Thank you so much for the idea!!! I make these all the time, and try them with different cereal each time. My 3 year old loves them, and so do I!!!!

I don't know what I am doing wrong but I never end up with bars.  I follow the directions exactly and I just don't manage to get bars out of this.  The last time I made this I used more peanut butter and that didn't work.  Regardless, I still think it tastes great.  I just throw it in a zip lock bag and eat it as snack mix.  The taste is great.  I just wish I could actually get it to form into bars.  I'll keep trying!

this recipe is great.  I alternated it a bit.  I used cheerios and added trail mix instead of just salted peanuts.  Then I made another batch minus the peanut butter and used fruit loops.  outstanding for the kids.

Was hesitant due to some of the sweetness reviews, but this is good!  Double all ingredients except the sugar...use 1/3 c...use 9x13 pan. (I also stirred in a few mini-choc chips when the pb mix cooled a bit.)  Kids loved 'em...hubby raved. Thanks for the recipe!

I just made  this yesterday and LOVED it.  It was so good I have already made it a 2nd time!  I know it is supposed to be for breakfast, but my kids think it is a dessert, and I am not going to tell them any differently!  It was a little thin for my liking, si when I made it a 2nd time,I put it in an 8x8" pan and the thickness looks perfect!  When I did it in a 9x13" pan (tupperware container) it did not quite fill it up, so it was a little thin and didn't stick together well (but it tasted great and set up like a charm).  I think next time I will try it with another cereal, although I have a LOT of Cheerios! (small kid...)

Although I made a few changes this time, I will definitely be making this again and will try it as written.  I have made a very similar recipe that calls for 6 C cereal, 2 C PB, corn syrup instead of honey, uses brown sugar instead of white, and calls for a 12oz bag of chocolate chips.  It is one of my FAVORITE recipes, but is high calorie.  I found this to be a much lower calorie version and just as tasty per my substitutions.  Per reviews, I decided to roughly multiply recipe by 1.5. I ended up using 5 cups cereal (1 C honey nut cheerios & 4 C Alpha Bits).  1/2 C sugar based on reviews.  3/4 C honey.  1 C peanut butter (I used 1 spoonful of chunky and the rest was PB Loco Dark Chocolate Peanut Butter).  I had no problems with the boiling of honey/sugar.  Once it reached a boil, I let it go about 30 seconds and removed from heat.  I spread in 9 x 13 pan and thought the amount was just right and I promptly placed in the fridge to set.  I took out about 30-60 minutes later.  These formed perfectly as bars and tasted just like my FAV recipe I mentioned above, but with the addition of honey flavor.  BUT, by cutting the amount of peanut butter (from my fav version) and omitting an entire bag of chocolate chips and using chocolate PB which has the same calories as reg PB, I saved over half the calories!!  I will be making these again with "normal" peanut butter and trying other flavors of PB as well.  GREAT recipe - thanks!

These are a good way of using up an abundance of cereal.... I need to find something that doesn't have all this sugar in it though.  While very good, they are too sweet for my tastes. I also boiled the mixture for about 4 minutes and they did indeed set up very hard, tough to slice, but still good, almost like a toffee texture.  Next time will experiment with the sugar quantity though....

If making in a 9 x 13 pan, definitely double the recipe.  I customized it this way:  replaced 1/2 the sugar with xylitol sweetener (natural low calorie sweetener), agave instead of honey (use half of what is called for because agave is sweeter).  I replaced 1/2 the cereal with Go Lean Crunch, then added dried fruit and a sprinkle of mini chocolate chips.  Delicious!  For easy spreading, spoon mixture into pan, cover with foil or wax paper and press with hands.

The concept is great, the few ingredients is convenient, and the ability to change up the cereals used makes this versatile. Two things though: this will fit a 9x9 or 8x8 much better than a 9x13. It was so thin in a 9x13 that it didn't bars so much as brittle. Another thing is the amount of honey/sugar seems high for how little cereal there is. I was taught to make these with a 1-to-4 ratio. The honey + the sugar = 1 cup, so the cereal should be 4 cups, not 3. But I guess that's a matter of personal preference? I think I'll add more peanut butter next time too. It's a really good base recipe, however. Thanks!

THESE ARE THE BOMB!! No bake, takes like no time at all to whip up, takes a bit to cool, but then dig in!!  The first time I made them, I thought they were more honey than peanut butter tasting, so the second time I made them I halved the honey and sugar, but then they were too gooey, not sticky enough, so I had to quickly make another 1/2 batch of honey and sugar mix to pour over top of cereal, peanuts and peanut butter... then quickly mixed while keeping everything over low heat.  Next time I might trying to do half honey half corn syrup to ease the honey flavor just a tad and bring out the peanut butter flavor a bit more.  Otherwise these are still very exceptional.  I just have one daughter who's not very big on the taste of honey and would prefer more PB tastes.  I love how easy these are to make, and serve!!

I found it to have a bit too much coating, so I ended up adding about another cup of cheerios.  I also followed what another review said and boiled the sugars for a little longer to promote hardening at room temp.  Overall a good recipe, just needed some tweaks for us.  I think I could get away with adding even more cereal next time, as some of the coating still went to the bottom.  Maybe a few rice crispies to soak up some extra and fill in the cracks.  :)

Yummy...it turned out a bit too sweet for me, too sweet for a to-go breakfast bar. I'm gonna eat this batch for dessert. Next time I'm gonna cut out some sugar.

Very yummy!  I used corn syrup instead of honey and chex instead of cheerios.  I added a touch of vanilla too but would recommend adding a dash of salt if you aren't using salted peanuts because I think you'd want something to balance out the sweetness.  I smooshed them down into the pan with a spoon sprayed with Pam to really compress them so they'd stay in bar form and they did perfectly.  Will definitely make again but probably improvise more.

These are good, but a bit too sweet.  I would cut back on the honey the next time I make them.  I boiled the mixture for a couple of minutes and that seemed to help the bars stick together instead of crumble apart.

awesome recipe, easy to tweak, I used 2 cups of krispies, and 1 cup of fruity krispies in the first batch for the kiddos, The second batch lowcarb for my Mom and me, substituting 1/2 cup splenda for the sugar and "sugarfree" honey/sugar free "maple" syrup 50/50 and unsweetened wheat puffs, I suggest toasting the wheat puffs in the oven for 10 minutes first if you want them more crispy. These adjustment cut the carbs almost 75%!!! Oh happy day!!!

Very delicious! I made this with Kashi's Heart to Heart cereal it is has a very delicious flavor. I'd also love to try this with multi-grain cheerios. 

The sugar could probably be reduced to 1/3 cup rather than 1/2 cup to make these a little healthier. 



I don't recommend you boil the mixture. Only heat it to boiling and then remove, or boil for a few seconds (30 or less). I Boiled the sugar and honey for a minute before removing from heat and adding the peanut butter and they were a tad too hard.

These are sooooo good! I'm vegan so I omitted the honey and used brown rice syrup instead. This is a very versatile recipe. I baked it as is and several other times with all kind of ingredients like toasted oats, mixed nuts, gluten-free cereals, dried fruit. The possibilities are endless. Thanks for a yummy treat!

I made this twice already. The first time the only change I made is that I added 4 cups of mixed cereal and I boiled it for a few minutes. I was unable to cut it so I just broke it apart. The second time I didn't have enough honey so I substituted maple syrup for most of the honey. I used 4 cups of cereal again. I boiled the mixture a little less and this time (for about 1-1.5 minute) and I was able to cut it into bars. Both times my husband devoured them so it's definitely worth 5 starts even though I myself find them too sweet.

I love these! I didn't add salted peanuts (just don't have any, but they'd be great!), so I just threw in some salt. I'm made two batches and didn't salt the first batch enough. The second time I gave my salt shaker a good shake into the sugar/honey mixture. Perfect!

Also, the first time I made these I did as one review suggested and boiled the sugar/honey for about 3 minutes. The end result was more of a brittle. I still enjoyed it, but my 19-month-old son couldn't eat it. The second batch I only boiled for a minute or so and they came out perfect! They set up, but still chewy. Mmm mm!

I was really surprised at how good this was! My picky eaters loved it, it wasn't messay and it was SUPER easy to make. My only issue with it is that it does NOT fill a 9x13 in pan! 6x6 is about right. If you put it in a 9x13 in pan you will NOT get bars.   Overall, loved this recipe. I was expecting it to be good...but it was GREAT!

very very good, though when cooled they turned hard as a rock, but only because i overcooked the sugar syrup. just keep an eye on that step, and the rest is golden.

Pretty tasty - I used half sugar and half splenda, and a mix of leftover cereals.  Came out pretty well, but the bars were very thin in a 13x9 pan.

We used Cap'n Crunch cereal and did not add in the optional nuts. My 6 year old helped make them and he LOVED them. He's already asking to make them again and they're not even gone yet. They're kinda crunchy, you need to use those back teeth to bite into them but they are really tasty and a fun snack! *********Update 8/19/09************** My son loved these so much last time that we just made them again. This time we used three mini boxes of cereal, each containing one cup. One regular Cheerios, one Frosted Cheerios and one Honey Nut Cheerios. We also tossed in a mini box of raisins. Incredibly easy and he just loves them. This will be a good recipe to have during the coming school year!

A great on-the-go cereal bar, not a dessert bar.  I used multi-grain Cheerios and added a bit extra, there seemed to be too much coating.

I really liked this recipe! They were chewy and very easy to make! I used chocolate chips instead of the nuts which gave them a very nice chocolate peanut flavor.

The flavor is pretty yummy, and put in individual servings in snack-sized zipper bags, they're a hit with the soccer team. I can't get them into bars to save my soul, though.

These were really really good and super easy to make (it took no time at all!)  I made mine with 2c slightly crushed golden grahams cereal and 1c toasted oats.  I also used natural peanut butter and they turned out delicious. Sweet and very peanutty. Next time I make them I'll add raisins and nuts, and I'll double the batch because I thought they came out a bit thin.  Mine never really hardened completely but they were great just the way they were.  I'll be making these over and over - so many possibilities!

Excellent recipe!  I recommend using a 'honey bunches of oats' type of cereal (I use the Kroger brand) and adding some quinoa flakes (about 1/2 cup) for added nutrition and fiber.  My family of 3 will eat a double recipe during the course of a day!

Delicious and very simple and fast to make.  We have a peanut allergy, so I left out the peanut butter.  It turned out beautifully, even so!  A healthier change from the marshmallow based recipes. (Nothing artificial here!)

I made these in preparation for hurricane Irene for the kids to have a yummy snack in case the power went out -- I've made these every weekend since! The kids adore them, and it's so easy and quick to make. I love that it uses peanut butter (I've tried it with creamy and crunchy and they both work great) and Cheerios. It seems like we always have Cheerios to use up, and this would work great for the stale ones sitting in the pantry, haha!

After reading all the great reviews I'm surprised to say we didn't like these. I have a big sweet tooth but I have to say these were WAY too sweet, even for me. My kids were excited when I told them I was making these, but they even said they're too sweet.

Kids loved these!  I halved the sugar but didn't double the rest of the recipe.  Then I used an 8x8 pan instead of 9x13.  It turned out plenty sweet and thick enough to be bars.  I also used Oh's instead of cheerios.  I'll definitely be making these for school-time breakfasts and snacks.  Thanks!

I don't know what I did wrong. :( I was so excited by all the reviews but these came out SO sweet! I doubled the recipe as others suggested, to fit a 9 x 13 pan. I followed the recipe exactly and they were a great consistency but WAY too sweet! Definite sugar rush if you eat these.

The taste was good, but it was too skimpy an amount for a 9x13 pan.  I've had these before, and they were always thick, maybe an inch thick.  Some other recipes scale the amount to 10 cups of cereal for a pan!  I like the idea, but I'll try a recipe with lots more cereal next time.

This is a good idea, but way too sweet. I'll use the basic ingredients again but try to find away to make it less sweet (any ideas?) Also the 9x13 pan means you'll have skinny flat bars, so I would recommend a smaller pan (8x8ish).

I did not care for these snack bars. They were far too sweet and had little flavor.

I just tried these because my 4 year old son wanted something "special" to eat and we had all the ingredients for this.  I did double the recipe so that it could fit into the 9x13 pan, and was a little short on the whole cup of honey, but they turned out great.  I did boil the sugar/honey mixture for about 3 minutes.  When I pressed the mixture into the pan, I used wax paper to make it nice and even as it was hard to do with the spoon.  They were not hard to cut and did not get too hard.  Great recipe!

It tastes good, but I don't know how you got this to cover a 9x13 pan - my batch only covered about 1/3 of the pan.

We really liked these!  I used corn syrup instead of honey since some reviewers said there was a strong honey taste and I knew I wouldn't like that. This is a great way to use up the opened boxes of Cheerios that no one is eating.

Doing my best to get away from processed foods and tried this recipe. I subbed brown sugar for white, followed the rest of the recipe. These were yummy. Daughter and hubs LOVED them. They did set very hard so I will take the others suggestion and only boil the sugar mixture for one minute next time. And there will be a next tim

Very easy and good bar recipe.  I made per the recipe, with a longer cooking time on the sugars.  I also will use a smaller pan in the future so that the bars are thicker.  I can see that this could be used with so many different cereals and add-ins!

I taste the PB more than the honey in this, and here's what I did (based on reading reviews):  1/2 cup sugar, 1/2 cup honey, 1/4 cup maple syrup - boiled that for about 45 seconds.  Then added 1 cup PB along with about 1 tsp vanilla.  Then added 2 cups cheerios, 2 cups rice krispies, and 1 cup grape nuts.  Stirred in some butterscotch and mini chocolate chips - spread out in a 9x13 pyrex and then let cool.  These were yummy, and very moist.  I'm anxious to hear how the kids like them in their lunches tomorrow!

I was looking for recipes that called for peanut butter since I had two big jars on hand.  I also had a big box of crisp rice cereal, so I used 2 c crisp rice and 1 c oat cereal.  I left out the peanuts, used corn syrup instead of honey (didn't have it).  These taste amazing and are sooooo easy!!!  Thank you so much for the awesome recipe!

Cheerios, oats, rice krispies, walnuts, almonds, ground flax seeds, sesame seeds, sunflower seeds, raisins and a few chocolate chips (which melt when you mix it and make it extra yummy).  All totalled to 4 cups....boiled honey, brown sugar and maple syrup for 30 seconds past a boil.  PERFECT!

I just made these again and they fell apart.  I think it was because my peanut butter was cold and not at room temp (I was using all natural).  Next time I will let it come to room temp first!

I used multigrain cheerieos and added chopped walnuts and pecans.  I really liked these bars and I doubled the recipe to fit in a 9x13 dish.  The only thing was I listened to another reviewer and boiled the sugar for 5 minutes and they turned out hard as a rock.  I couldn't cut through them and the kids couldn't bite them.  I'm definately making these again but I'm only going to boil the sugar maybe 2 or 3 minutes.  I would like to know if anyone had good results using Splenda or Splenda mix for baking.

I have made this a few times, and I have not been able to get actual bars.  Regardless, it tastes great, and I end up with a healthy(ish) snack I store in ziploc bags.  I have made the recipe with Splenda, reduced fat peanut butter and sugar free syrup (in lieu of some of the honey), and it tasted just as good.

This is very good. I added 1 tsp vanilla for more flavor and used 1/4 c. honey and 1/4 c. corn syrup (because I didn't have enough honey) and the flavor is wonderful. These should not be refrigerated - store in air tight container only.

YUM! Tastes awesome with honey nut cheerios. I also used PB Loco Peanut Butter w/ Sumatro Cinnamon & Raisins, so it had some extra tasty stuff in there. For fun, I threw in few Kraft caramel bits that I had on hand. They are fun--a nice twist/change-up from the Special K or Rice Krispy cereal bars. Super fast too! Just be careful not to stack them--they stick together like krazy glue! =)

way too sweet for me and I even reduced the sugar to 1/4 cup.  I like the idea but will probably try to add more cereal to stretch it. I also used a little real maple syrup because I didn't have quite enough honey and it was delish with the peanut butter. I'll keep the recipe and make again but will tweak it to make it less sweet.  Oh, and my bars were perfect. I used a 9x9 and used a slightly buttered piece of parchment to push on the bars and really get them compressed.  I also kept them in the fridge to harden up the peanut butter. They cut beautifully.

The flavor is good but mine didn't form bars, more of a trail mix. UPDATE: I made again but boiled the honey sugar mixture for 1 minute...they almost formed bars this time but only some of them stayed together...next time I think I'm going to boil for 1 1/2-1 3/4 minute...

I made some substitutions: I used 1/2 c. Hersey's chocolate syrup instead of honey, added 1/4 cup peanut butter to recipe amount (so 3/4 total), only used 3/4 cup cheerios and 2 1/4 cups cocoa puff cereal, and didn't add peanuts, but probably could have. This was what I had on hand and it turned out pretty yummy!

Very yummy.  I used half honey half light corn syrup and let the sugar mixture boil for 1 min. (to try to keep the honey taste from being too overpowering). Set up very nicely as bars after it cooled.  The peanuts really add a lot.  Kinda tastes like a PayDay bar.  Thanks!

This is very good.  I used rolled oats and some Kashi Crunch cereal.  I did what other reviewers suggested, I boiled the honey and sugar (I used Sucanat w/Honey) for a full minute.  I also used an 8x8 pan.  I added choc. chips, but they melted.  So I made a second batch, because the first was so good and didn't make much, and I layered in the choc. chips.  I put half the mixture in the pan, added the choc. chips, then put the rest of the mixture on top.  I only let it cool in the pan for a few minutes before I flipped the pan onto wax paper and let it fall out of the pan.  I waited a few more mintues for it to cool and then cut it into bars while it was still warm.  I also used Smucker's Natural Peanut Butter in this.  With all the more healthy substitions, this was still very good.  I will definitely be making this again and often.  This reminds of the Peanut Butter Chews I ate as a kid and have been wanting to adapt that recipe to make it heathier.  Not sure I need to now since this recipe is so good.  Enjoy!

These were not at all edible. The honey/sugar base made the bars far too hard. What little I was able to break off and eat made my teeth feel like they were rotting inside my mouth. Thanks for the recipe, but no thanks. Will definitely NOT make this again!!

Yummy and super easy recipe!  And I'm not a cook (yet.).  I let the sugar and honey boil for about 4 minutes before removing it from the heat as a previous reviewer recommended and it worked.  The mixture did stick together for me and I was able to cut into bars.  This will be a staple for my little ones.  Very yummy!

I made this recipe with 100% natural granola cereal and it turned out good.  Only thing is that it's a little too sugary and peanut-buttery for my taste, so next time I'll use less.

I cooked it for 5 minutes like it said, and they came out pretty hard, gonna cook it for a few minutes less. My fiance loves peanut butter, he said they were really good besides how hard they were. 
Thank you for the receipe!

I doubled everything except the sugar, used only 1/3 cup, as stated in some of the reviews,  & I added 3 cups Cheerios & 3 cups Rice Chex , added 1 cup unsalted peanuts & 1 cup of milk chocolate chips. It's a bit gooey if I leave out of the refrigerator, very tasty & not too sweet. My daughter & I loved them, my 3 year old granddaughter wanted to know "why I put chocolate chips?" She's a sweet lover like myself, so I told her I love chocolate. My 9 month old granddaughter wanted some but, couldn't have because of the honey.  I will definitely make them again when 9 month old is a year old.

The first time I made this I boiled the sugar and honey for four minutes as suggested by another rater.  The bars were way too hard to eat.  Second time I followed the directions and they turned out great.  I also sprinkled some mini chocolate chips over the top to melt.  This is a simple and quick recipe that will work well for a lunchbox snack.

Delicious and easy and doubles great. Cut the sugar by 25% and use a lower sugared cereal. Follow directions exactly as outlined. Once refridgereated and set, remove and serve room temp to eliminate the rock-hardness. YUUMMY!

Delicious. Didn't use a full 1/2 cup of white sugar - instead used 1/4 cup white sugar and 1/4 cup brown sugar. I boiled it for a couple of extra minutes. I didn't use a 9x13 pan (I wasn't able to get it to spread into that large of a pan) - I used an 8x8 instead. Will be making these again!

We made this just as written. It has a good flavor (who can go wrong with peanut butter  and honey?) and the kids loved the "no bake" aspect so they could help; however, 3 cups of cereal did not  cover the the bottom of a 9 x 13 pan. Plus I apparently didn't boil the sugar/honey combination long enough because it never truly set up. But it was good and I would make it again, with changes!

I made it as written but used gluten free round cereal. I usually make it in the microwave but decided to try this method instead. I find the bars set up better when made stove top so I'll probably do this again. I used a smaller pan (5x11) and I think the suggested pan would be too big.

These are excellent! I make these often, using 1/4 C brown sugar and 1/4 C white, then top them with a sprinkle of nuts and m&m trail mix while they are still warm. The kids grab them on their way out to play and I throw them in lunch boxes daily. My family loves these! Thank you for submitting the recipe:0)

I used brown sugar instead of white, 1/4 c honey & 1/4 c light corn syrup, added 1 tsp vanilla extract and 1tsp cinnamon, and substituted jif cereal. Then drizzled with chocolate and orange melting chips for Halloween. They are amazing!

I wanted to use up a box of Vanilla Special K cereal, so I used that instead of the toasted oats cereal. If you like "sweet" then this is for you! This was a great after school snack for the kids and their friends!

I've made these bars several times and they are just delicious!  So much cheaper than buying granola bars and healthy to boot.  I make as directed and occasionally add in uncooked oatmeal, flax seed, or wheat bran and sometimes throw in some chocolate chips.

I'm on my second time making these in three days!  Buttered 9x13 pan, 1 cup corn syrup, 2/3 c brown sugar, 1 cup crunchy pb, pinch of salt, 2 tsp vanilla, 10 cups of cereal (3 c Multigrain Cheerios, 3c Kix, and 4 c cocoa puffs).  Once the syrup and sugar started bubbling around the edges, I timed one minute and then removed from the heat.  Pressed into the pan using a sheet of waxed paper and allowed to cool before cutting.  Once cool, cutting into bars is no problem.  My next attempt will include oats, coconut, and chocolate chips...can't wait!  Thank you for a wonderful base recipe!!

I used "Honey Nut Cheerio's" in this recipe.  I was short on the honey so I used half honey and half corn syrup with the sugar.  I followed everything else except for throwing in a cup of trail mix instead of the peanuts; I forgot the chips would melt but that was fine, it just gave it a darker color.  Let simmer for a few minutes so it the sugar would set when cooled.  I don't know why but it didn't look like enough for a 10x13 pan so I quickly greased my 8x8 brownie pan.  I cut into squares.

Perfect scenario to try this recipe: I had 2 cups of  "healthy" cereal that I didn't want to waste, my always-looking-for-something-to-eat kiddos we're asking for a snack, and our pantry was basically cleaned out. I had all the necessary ingredients and scaled down the recipe to fit the dry ingredients (2 cups) I had. Success! Since I used a healthier (read: not very sweet) cereal, the honey/sugar combo was perfect for us. I will say that I did have a problem with the bars being hard (my jaw is still tired from all the chewing!), but I'm hoping that it's only because I need to tweak the ratio between the cereal and the honey/sugar/peanut butter "syrup". Since we like peanut butter, I may just add a little more peanut butter and a dash of cinnamon and hope that'll solve the hardness issue. Either way, great recipe!

I made this with 1/4 cup of Splenda and sugar free honey, followed everything else.  Next time I will add more peanuts.  My Husband is a diabetic, so I am always looking for recipes.  It is great!

Delicious! I used a mixture of nuts, crunchy peanut butter, and a mixture of honey and Karo. We also had some leftover chocolate chips from Christmas cookies, so I put the, on the top.  I wanted to eat the whole pan.

Taste was good, but I thought the recipe should be doubled if using a 9x13 pan.  The amount of mixture was not substantial enough to hold together.  I will use this recipe again, experimenting with different cereals.  I thought Chocolate Cheeriors would be a good addition :)

I made these yesterday for the first time.  We all loved them.  My kids, husband and I.  Very easy to make.  I did boil the sugar honey mixture for 1 min and used whole grain cheerios.  They were great.  They don't last long either.  My kids had one for a snack when they came home from school and then another one after softball practice.  To where my son said he was getting one of those awesome bars.  Made another batch already today.  I know they won't last long either.  Big hit.

My husband doesn't even like honey and was very leery if them. Once he tried them it was a different story. He asks for them all the time. They definitely do not last in my house.

I made these just to see if the kids would like them. Cereal bars are so over priced at the store.  I substituted Lite Karo syrup for honey because I was out, and these are already a big hit.  We have already made a couple batches, adding coconut, nuts, craisens and different things just to try it.... Excellent recipe and fun to do with the kiddos. Thanks! :)

These are great!  I used Multi-grain Cheerios, crunchy peanut butter, and omitted the whole peanuts.  I also put them in an 9x9 pan.  They came out terrific.  These taste SO much better than store bought cereal bars.  Sweet and lightly salty.  What more could you want in a snack?!

FANTASTIC!  I only had 2 c of multi grain cherrios so I added a cup of rice crispies.  I did another suggested and used 1/2c sugar, 1/2c honey, 1/4 syrup and added vanilla to my pnut butter.  I also used an smaller pan than a 9x13 and also added chocolate chips!  Of course they melted instantly making it a chocolatey sensation!  I still believe with the chocolate chips that it has got to be better for you than the store bought cereal bars that have a shelf life of 2 years because they have so many perservatives in them!  These are so yummy!

I think this is a better option than cereal bars with marshmallows.  I let my sugar boil a few minutes and they definately got hard.  Straight from the fridge, they were too hard, but at room temp, they were fine.  I didn't have peanuts on hand, so I used green pumpkin seeds and chopped walnuts and also added some ground flax meal when I was mixing it up.  They do have a strong honey flavor, but we liked them!

I put mine in a 8x8 pan, and it was just the right thickness, but I found it very sweet. I will definitely make it again, next time less sugar and more cereal.

I followed other reviews and substituted/added other ingredients (almonds, raisins), increased boil time to 2 minutes, and doubled the recipe. I had to end up cutting into 24 squares to reach a size my kids could finish at one sitting. Next time, I will feel comfortable using healthier cereal because the recipe is sweet enough without added sugar. Great recipe, thank you! These are our new school day breakfast bar!

UPDATE: I made this recipe again and decided to try a 9x13 pan on a single recipe since the double recipe made a lot.  I used Cheerios and all ingredients at the amount suggested and it did not make enough to fill the pan.  I will now use an 8" for a single batch and 9x13 for a double.

yummy my whole family loved them.  I will definately make this again. I used agave nectar instead of honey.  One problem i had was everything didn't hold together and it was hard to cut so i think i'll put more peanut butter into this.  Over all very good!!!

I am a university student and needed a healthy snack to go with my early morning routine. These bars were easy to make and tasted delicious - my bf couldn't wait for the bars to cool off, he wanted to eat the mix right out of the pot! I will uses a smaller pan next time, or double the ingredients, as the bars were really thin.

I followed this recipe almost exactly, I substituted one cup of cereal for brown rice krispy's. GREAT flavor! I loved the recipe because it used honey instead of corn syrup. I've been looking for a bar recipe without corn syrup and this one was perfect. I would have given it 5 stars but I couldn't get it form in bars very well. I think next time I will try melting the peanut butter with the sugar and honey.

These were easy to make and taste great.  I used splenda, agave nector, and a combination of multigrain cheerios and chocolate cheerios.  I thru in a handful of oatmeal also.  I heated the splenda and agave to just a boil, let it simmer for about 2 minutes until it started turning a carmel color, removed it from the heat, added the PB stirring until melted, then mixed in the cereals.  Kid and hubby loved them.

Changed just a couple of things: 3 cups of cereal was not enough to balance the wet ingredients.  I used 4 cups and it was just right.  I used an 8x8-inch pan and they came out as 16 nice little cubes.  I think a 9x13 pan would have spread them out too thin for me.  Next time I'll try it with only 1/4 cup honey - it was rather sweet.  Nonetheless, I really enjoyed these bars and so did my 18-year old son!

These taste great!  everyone really enjoyed them.  Great crunch and not too sweet.  The only thing is for some reason they didn't stick together enough for bars.   They still tasted awesome.  Maybe boil honey longer, I did it for about 5 minutes.  Next time I'll try slightly longer.

These are really good.  They helped me useup the last of the Cheerios that weren't getting eaten.  I think they'd be really good with some chocolate cips added or maybe some butterscotch chips.

These bars are fantastic!  My son loves cashews so I substituted some chopped ones for the peanuts and also added some almond slivers along with a handful of Golden Grahams...because I love them.  These bars taste fantastic and are fun to make with little kids, too.  I will be making them again and again and  again.  Very quick and easy!

So delicious. My kids *loved* this. Such a great alternative to store-bought, and you've already got the ingredients in your pantry! Thanks for sharing - we'll be making this one quite often.

Yum! I used Cheerios, natural peanut butter, reduced the sugar slightly, added 3/4 cup oats (both quick or old fashioned will work) and 1/2 cup dried cranberries. I continued to boil the sugar/honey mixture for 30 seconds after it came to a full boil and got a nice bar that stays together without being candy hard. Do not boil the honey/sugar mixture for up to 5 minutes. Doing so creates the "rock hard" and "break your tooth" oaty cereal bars referred to in other reviews.

very easy, mine were a little gooey. Maybe I should have boiled the sugar mix longer. Tasted really good, very sweet.

Awsome bars! Mine came out chewy, not hard. I like them because they provide plenty of protein and carbs for when I work out!

I used whole wheat chex, half sugar-free syrup, half honey and half sugar, half splenda. Then I added macadamia nuts. I Loved these! they're a little sweet, but I still really enjoyed them. Will definitely make again! =]

I made this for my 3 kids and 5 others - only a couple finished them and no one has requested them since.  No one really disliked them - just not something I'll make again.

I doubled the coating part of the recipe and added 5 cups of toasted oat cereal then 1/4 cup each of peanuts, sunflower seeds (shelled), raisins, dried cherries, and dried cranberries.  Turned out great.  I haven't actually cut them yet so we will see how that goes.  Great way to use up cereal that no one likes.  Will definately make these again.

This was good. My son likes it. I think the cereal pieces are too big to make bars and the sugar is too much and and makes them too hard. Next time I make this I will break up the cereal or use a smaller cereal, use just peanut butter and honey and I think they will turn out better. What I did with my first batch is crumble it all up for a "munch".

These are SO good!  I could hardly stop eating them.  Neither could the 8 year old I babysit who will not eat anything!  She took a bite, and after a moment of suspense...she belted out "That's the way, uh huh, uh huh, I like it!" LOL.  I used Golden Graham cereal because that's what I had in the house, and also boiled the sugar and honey longer as one user suggested.  I think I went too long though, because they set up to be hard as a rock.  That can easily be remedied though by a few seconds in the microwave.  Be careful!  The sugar mixture can get VERY hot when reheated!  I will be experimenting with different kinds of cereal & next time will only boil the sugar and honey for about 1 minute instead of 3.

My 10 year old loved these.  I made one batch Friday and made another today.  We used a smaller pan to make them a little thicker.  Plan on throwing trail mix in instead of the peanuts next time.  They are very easy to make too.

These were so easy make. I've already made them a couple of times. I added almonds and dried cranberries instead of the peanuts. They are pretty sweet so I think you could get away with using less sugar. The second time I made them I added marshmallows and chocolate chips and they kind of melted into a big mess but it still tasted pretty good. This is a great recipe to save some money and get away from so much packaged and processed food.

I gave this recipe three stars since I didn't think they were spectacular.  I added mini chocolate chips instead of peanuts.  It kind of reminded me of the chex monkey munch.  They were hard to cut so I didn't get bars rather a crumbly mixture.

Much like Demimi, I had a box of that weird Kashi "Go Lean" cereal, and it just wasn't my bag... Thankfully, I found this recipe!  I doubled it, due to the SIX CUPS of the cereal - but cut the sugar and honey to 3/4 cups instead.   Still very sweet, but this was the only pleasant way to use up that terrible cereal!

It was too sweet with the honey--I had to use 1/4 cup sugar. There wasn't enough peanut butter taste to my liking, and it didn't stick together in the end with just the honey. The end product was a crumbly mess that fell apart completely when I tried to cut it into actual bars. I think I'll use 1 cup peanut butter, 1/2 cup corn syrup (I think the corn syrup makes it stick together better), and use 5 cups toasted oat cereal and 1 cup oats. Forget the honey--the taste might be great, but it won't be sorely missed.

Very easy and very good!  I used Splenda, sugar free syrup, reduced fat peanut butter, and strawberry Honey Bunches of Oats.  (I'm a long-term dieter and that's what I had on hand).  I boiled the syrup and sugar for 3-4 minutes as suggeseted by others. It was a bit of a workout stirring in the peanut butter and cereal but well worth the (slight) effort.  Very good!  I can't stop going to fridge to break off a piece.

I was looking for a cereal bar recipe with no corn syrup, and this is perfect! Any cereal works, I used half Total half Cheerios. I timed 45 seconds of simmering, and it set up like a dream. I used an 8x8 pan, it MUST be a typo for the 9x13!

This is a fantastic recipe--I used agave nectar instead of honey because I'm not a big fan of honey flavor, and it worked out perfectly. Boiled the sugar/nectar mixture for a little over 1 minute and the bars turned out firm but chewy and delicious! I also threw a handful (about 1/4 cup or so) of chocolate chips in with the peanut butter to make it a bit chocolatey. Yum! EDIT: I forgot to say that I did use a slightly smaller baking dish than called for. I used an 8 x 12 dish.

Very easy and very tasty! I can't comment on the bar formation because I always eat it straight out of the bowl! For some reason, these are 4 ingredients I always have when the pantry's empty and I need something sweet.

Added another cup of Cheerios and it filled a 9x13 thinly. Also, used a handful of sunflower seeds instead of peanuts. Good base recipe to use.

I made these for a care package for my husand who is in Iraq.  The turned out great and tasted wonderfully... i ended up having to make another batch for myself.  
I used 1/4 cup Splenda to replace the sugar and also added dried cranberries for a little extra zest!!  I took the advice of boiling the splenda/honey mixture for 5 mintues to help the bar set up when they cooled and it worked fabulously!  
Wonderful recipe.... i will definatly be making more to send off!

I doubled the recipe and put it in a 9 x 12.  I also boiled the sugar and honey for 3-4 minutes.  And I used natural peanut butter and the recipe worked great.  I think they may have been a little too thick doubled, but would have been too thin if it was a singe recipe.  So next time I may spread them into a larger pan.  These are definitely a keeper!!

These are fantastic. I have made them for my family several times now. To get them to form into bars I use my hands (if the mixture is too hot just use a piece of plastic wrap wadded up in your hand)and press it into the pan tightly. Works every time! My husband prefers them a little less chewy so I just add 1/4-1/2 cups more oats for a firmer texture and have never had a problem making into bars...even before I added the extra oats.

First of all, this tatses very good!! I followed directions as posted and couldn't for the life of me get it to form into bars. (I ate mine with a fork.) Also, the amount it made didn't fill the 9x13 pan, so I had to move everything to one side.

Pretty good!  I simmered the sugar/honey mixture for a minute or so to make sure it became solid enough to hold the bars together.  I also added some granola to the cereal.  A great portable breakfast-very filling!

Changed the recipe up just a little:
Instead of all three cups of oats, I used 1 cup each of oats, puffed brown rice, puffed red wheat.  I added 1/3 C. of wheat germ and 1/3 C. milled flax seeds.  I used 1/2 C. sliced almonds and used natural peanut butter.  Using the cereals and "binders" (flax & wheat germ) helped the bars really stick together!  I also cooked the sugar/honey for about 4 minutes.

Excellent!  Perfect for the kiddos afternoon snack.  They were very easy, little cleanup and I was able to make them into bars.  I loved how they weren't incredibly chewy or crunchy, my 2 year old would have had a hard time with that.  Thanks for the great recipe!

I took the advice of another user and changed these up a bit. I used cinnamon toast crunch added some chocolate and voila'! Yum! Great for all ages, kids especially love them.

Awesome Recipe.  Used the sugar and honey as a base, combined cereals to make great bars!

This is a terrific recipe.  I replaced the sugar and honey with marshmallows to help form into bars.  It was also less sweet. My husband likes to take these to work as a snack.  They are a nice alternative to a fatty, prepackaged granola bar.

the taste is great, but since it seems most people can't make bars out of the "bar" recipe ( myself included) I can only give it a 2.  Actually getting it to make bars would boost this recipe to a 4.  (I suspect some additional fat would solve the problem, but haven't tried it)

This has great taste and as a result won't last long.  I did get them form bars, but they didn't stay together well while my 3 year old ate them.  So, in the future when I try them I will either from cookies out of them or I will make them thicker.  This was great for my toddler who was getting sick of the same old breakfast.

These were very good! I used splenda and a little less honey and peanut butter. I also used a blend of cheerios, total, and wheat chex. I also could not get them into bars, so I ate it as cereal with milk and it was very good. I also think it would be good if natural peanut butter was used (like with flax seeds and very little oil.  Overall a very good and healthy alternate breatkfast.

These tasted delicious but I agree with past reviewers-I couldn't get bars out of this. I used Splenda, red fat PB & omitted the peanuts & I liked using whole grain oat cereal. I made this into a cereal snack rather than bars. The second time I made these, just for the sake of calorie counting, I cut the honey, PB & Splenda amounts by half & I don't think the taste was diminished at all. Thanks for a great recipe.

I have now made this delicious and EASY recipe many times for my family, with a ton of different variations. As long as you keep the 'base' the same, anything else seems to work (trail mix, wheat germ, other cereals, dried fruit, etc.). My kids take the bars to school and everyone loves them.
