This was a very nice recipe for brunch. Next time I'll use a slightly larger pan. With the thickness of this cake it got too dark for my taste by the time it was done in the middle. I will also use cinnamon and nutmeg with the allspice.

I agree with Annie but instead of a larger pan I reduced the temp. to 375 and increased the cooking time until done

I don't know why, but I expected a lot more from a commercially sponsored recipe.  One would assume their recipes would be tested and retested  before attaching the company name to them. The cake didn't impress me for a number of reasons. First, this was moist, I'll give it that, but the allspice was strangely odd to me. Cinnamon or a little nutmeg would have been a better choice. For that matter,  NO spice and a little vanilla would have been better.  The flavor of the cake itself was flat, and not sweet enough. The jam filling, which I didn't care for at all, did not compensate for that. The topping wasn't particularly tasty, and wasn't the best looking topping either.  I used a 9x9" pan and, in hindsight, should have used the 8x8" option. The first layer of cake batter was so thin that, once  baked, the filling pretty much sank to the bottom. As for the filling, preserves was not the best option - pie filling, canned or homemade, would have been so much better.  In order to pretty this up a little I sprinkled it with powdered sugar, but that did little to change my overall opinion.  My three star rating, which I consider to be "good, but average,"  is very generous.

I really like the idea of this recipe!  Simple!  I made blueberry sauce for the filling.  Honestly, that's the only thing that gave this dessert any flavor.  It was not very sweet (even though the sauce had PLENTY of sugar) and kind of bland.  I will definitely make this again but with more sugar in the batter and maybe some vanilla or some other extract to liven in up.  I did add cinnamon to the batter because I didnt have allspice on hand, didnt do much.

THE BEST!! We love this coffee cake I only made 2 changes. I doubled the topping and used blueberry pie filler instead of jam. It's what I had on hand. Great recipe  thank you

I loved this! I added about a cup of blueberries to the batter which made it super moist. I would definitely make this again!

next time i make this, i will use canned blueberry pie filling in place of the preserves. The preserves only gave the recipe a hint of blueberry. i also had to cook it for twice as long as the recipe suggested. so i recommend cooking at 350 for 40-45 min.

This is a quick, basic recipe.  I didn't have the same problem with the baking time (8x8" pan for 22 minutes worked great for me) but I agree that it could use a bit more flavor...perhaps adding cinnamon and nutmeg in addition to the allspice as suggested.

With the modifications suggested (add cinnamon and vanilla; drop allspice and substitute real blueberries for the jam) this was a big breakfast pleaser.  Cake is very heavy and hearty.  Very easy to make with items I usually have on hand.  Keeper

I put in 1/2 c. sugar, omitted the all spice & put lemon zest into the cake and the topping. I also
doubled the topping and baked it at 350 for about
an hour, I checked it after 45 min., it still needed more time. I will  make this again. Delish!!

I happened to find blueberries frozen from summer and found this recipe and I doubledit into a cake pan I cooked it at 350ยบ for 35 minutes I also used cinnamon instead of all spice and I changed the topping to more of a strussal topping like I use on my apple strussal pie. Apso instead of the blueberry jelly I cooked frozen blueberries with a little sugar let then cool and used that in the middle well needless to say my 3  teenage sons had it gone by breakfast the next morning it was a hit in my house infact I m making another one as I type this.

Very simple to make.  I did not have blueberry jam in the house and didn't want to make a trip to the grocery store, so I used 1 cup of canned blueberry pie filling.  Had a great flavor and everyone loved it.

I did not care for this. It tasted strongly of flour, so much so that it was really gross. It was also more moist than I would have liked. Definitely will never make this again.

AS others here have said, a little vanilla and cinnamon are all this needs to be spectacular.

I just made these as muffins for work - they are fantastic! Really easy to make - which is great, since I know my staff will love them! 

My slight variation: Muffins are better for my crowd, so I filled muffin cups (with liners) 2/3 or so with batter, piled up about 8-12 blueberries on top, then I pushed them in a little and topped with the crumb topping. I did the same with diced bananas and more nuts instead of blueberries for 1/2 of the muffins. I cut down on cooking time by 5 min for the smaller pan(s). 


I will get Smucker's and do it exactly as directed, I am sure it'll be even better!  Thank you thank you!

I was looking for a fruit coffee cake recipe with no sour cream, as I didn't have any handy.  This one came up, and I thought I'd try it, but after reading the reviews it was clear they needed more spices.  I added vanilla and cinnamon, as well as the allspice.  I was using a bundt pan and my homemade canned apple slices, which I lightly mashed so they would layer nicely.  After mixing, the batter looked more like biscuit dough, so I added more milk.  Not sure if our elevation had something to do with it?  We're up very high in Calgary (1084m/3557ft).

The result was delicious and disappeared right away.  This time I'm making a double batch, as it didn't fill the bundt pan very well, and I'd like to have seconds!
