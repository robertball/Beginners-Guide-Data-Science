This was a fine basic soup. I would tell someone making this for the first time that 1. Do the first step in a pot. 2. 2 heads of garlic is quite a lot. I only used 4 cloves and that was fine. 3. 2 tablespoons of curry powder is way too much. I would recommend only using 1 tablespoon. 4. I might add a regular onion to the mix- not just green onions. Tastes great with rolls.

What a great way to use turnips and radishes! I also used kohlrabi instead of carrots bc it was what I had available... But other than that I followed the recipe. So glad you posted this! Thank you!

Fantastic!  Loved the way it makes veggies I'd never choose to eat on their own palatable!

This is a great way to use most of the winter root vegetables I get in my CSA. I've yet to find something better to clear our fridge. I make a double batch and freeze it in small portions to take to work. I also find that you can substitute just about any root vegetable if you don't have the amounts of the ones listed. I used a food processor to mince everything instead of dicing them since the soup gets pur√©ed anyway.

So good! I left some of the veggies (maybe a fifth) out of the blender to give the soup some texture.

Love the soup. I am on a whole 30 diet plan and can not have dairy or sugar along with other things. So I followed the suggestions for vegan recipe using balsamic vinegar in place of Worcestershire sauce. I had no radishes on had and don't like a lot of spice so I added sweet potatoes instead and left out the brown sugar it was awesome.

There's nothing wrong with this recipe, but it isn't great either. I appreciated finding a recipe that used Hakurei turnips, since they were part of my weekly CSA package and I didn't know what to do with them.

This was pretty good. I used sweet onion instead of green, 6 cloves of garlic instead of two heads, and heavy cream instead of milk. It wasn't spicy enough for me so I drizzled some sriracha on my serving. That made it perfect.

Nice soup. I used olive oil to saute things and all milk. Still came out nice and thick. I used a little bit more than half the curry.. I should have used about half.. its just a tad too spicy. I'l remember to temper it futher next time. I also didnt use 2 head of garlic.. didnt have that much in the house
