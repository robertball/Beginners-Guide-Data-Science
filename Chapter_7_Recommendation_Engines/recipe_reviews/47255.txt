I have had fish with fruit before and loved it, but I found the fruit mixture much too sweet.  I think it depends whether or not the canned fruit is in juice or syrup.  Since mine was in syrup, I should not have added more sugar.

This recipe is quite nice.  I used fresh peaches instead of canned.  I serve this slightly sweet salmon with a spiced rice to offset the sweetness. My 19 month old son loves this salmon.

I've served this twice now, the only variation is that the Salmon was BBQ'd.  Rave reviews each time.  The fruit sauce is great.

mmmm... this is excellent, my husband and I both loved it.  Definitely use the canned peaches in juice rather than syrup.

Very different!  Pretty good, but I didn't add the extra sugar, and I would have added more ginger.
