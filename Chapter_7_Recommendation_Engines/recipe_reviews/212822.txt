I have made this for years. It's a very tasty dish and can be made either with cheese blintzes as written or with frozen fruit filled blintzes or with a combination of cheese and fruit filled.

Very simple, delicious recipe!  Based on previous reviewers, I, too, cut back on the sugar.  I added a splash extra orange juice and also folded a pint of fresh blueberries into the batter before pourind it over the frozen blintzes, then sprinkled cinnamon to the top.  The blueberries were a pretty and delicious addition.  Guests enjoyed it very much.

This was very easy and delicious.  However, I did find it way sweeter than necessary.  I reduced the sugar by a little bit because it sounded like so much, but it was still too sweet for my taste.  Will make it again, but reduce the sugar.

I have made this for different celebration brunches for years and it is a family favorite.  I use 3 boxes different flavor blintz (18), 1 stick butter, 4 eggs, 3/4 c oj, 8oz sour cream, 1/2 c sugar and 1 tsp vanilla.  It has always gotten rave reviews.

This was the first time having this for me and my family and we all agreed that it was pretty good. I used a combo of cheese and blueberry blintzes but otherwise followed the recipe to the T with the exception of an added Tsp of cinnamon. I think next time I make it I will probably use 1 less egg, a little more OJ and will definitely sear the blintzes in a frying pan for a minute or two, to give the pastry covering a bit more consistency.

I halved this recipe for a small brunch. I could only find "tofutti" blintzes, but they still came out great. I rolled them in the melted butter before pouring on the batter. I used a little extra orange juice and much less sugar. It's really sweet as it is. I used lowfat sour cream. I grew up with blintz souffles on special brunch occasions. We always served them with thawed frozen strawberries and lowfat sour cream. This time I forgot to serve the sour cream, but the strawberries really hit the spot.

Delicious!  It took more than 45 minutes to cook - closer to 1 hour.  All of my brunch guests loved it.

I have made this recipe for years but couldn't remember all the ingredients.  This version is way to sweet....and I cut it back to 1 cup of sugar.  My guess is that 1/2 cup is plenty.  I have made it with all types of blintzes and its' always a treat.

This recipe baked up beautifully, however, the sugar should be reduced significantly.

This is really great! I made half a batch and flavor is just wonderful. We really enjoyed it. I added an extra splash of orange juice.

This was extremely easy to make, and it came out perfectly. The only change was to halve the sugar.  It took a little longer to bake to a golden brown, but that wasn't such a big deal. I made this three days in advance of serving. I covered the pan with Al foil while warming it up.

Made this for the first time and it was a hit! It was so delicious! I brought the souffle to a family gathering and it was enjoyed by all. in fact I would seriously consider making this and serving it warm as a fancy dessert. One thing I wish I had done was either used with small torch or put it under the broiler for just a minute or two to brown the top of it because the crunchy edges of caramelized sugar were phenomenal.

I served it with sausage and topped with a raspberry reduction (no sugar since the souffl√© was sweet enough.  I loved it!  It could be dessert too!
