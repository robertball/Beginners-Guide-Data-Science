good recipe and  the ingredients can be played around with, I guess the darkening comes from the brown sugar and smoke.  I've seeds on order, aji amarillo, cascabel and hot Thai so will use those this year.

Recipe is great. Simple yet a great end result!  I chose to skip the brown sugar and add instead a half tsp of Splenda.  I also left the seeds in for extra texture and heat! I used it on my chicken today and I'm still feeling the heat.  Love it!
Thanks

Step 1: Wear gloves! I didnt and my hands have been burning for 8 hours now. Followed the recipe to a T and I dont think I would change anything (except garlic, we love our garlic). Great Job! It is hot and this recipe makes more than I could use in 6 months.
