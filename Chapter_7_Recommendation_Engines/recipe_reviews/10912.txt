Very sweet cookie. But good and easy to make.  I added a few sprinkles of cinnamon with the pecans & crackers and it added great flavor.  Bake for 10-12 minutes.

Yum!  Thanks for a great cookie recipe.  I didn't have nuts so I substituted oats.  They are great.

Nice and easy cookie to make and took the suggestion of adding cinnamon.  I had quite a few leftover eggs from making "coquito" (eggnog) and used this recipe to use the egg whites.  I baked some on parchment paper and some on a Silpat and the ones on parchment turned out far superior.  I baked them for about 8 minutes each, let them sit on the cookie sheet for about 1-2 minutes, and then transferred to a wire rack to cool.  Thanks!

This recipe was terrible. I thought I would try it because it was very different from anything I had ever seen before but it ended up being a waste of time. It was a lot of work took a long time and the taste made me want to puke I would not recommend this recipe.

Our class made these and shared with teachers on our hall. Their voting came up with 3 stars. In our classroom we thought they were very tasty and voted them a 4. They had a different texture and taste. We did have to add more crackers than called for to get them to a bakeable consistency

These are really good! I didnt have butter crackers so I used regular saltines and they were just as good. Try layering them in a pan and topping with cream cheese and cherry pie filling!!

I stumbled on this while trying to use up egg whites. It's my lukiest find yet! Thank you khowle110 for the suggestion of cinnamon and the baking time. BTW - Walnuts work too. Now I don't mind recipes that call only for egg yolks - this is a GREAT way to use them up.

Love this recipe.   It reminds me of meringue cookies.   This is a very easy recipe, no brainer.   But for the first time through please follow the recipe.  Use real Ritz crackers, no pretenders.    There is definitely a difference in taste if you don't.   I used walnuts the second time because I'm not fond of pecans.   My husband thought the idea of a Rifz cookie was bizarre until he ate one, now he's a convert.   Try the Rtiz pie with whipped cream,very nice.
