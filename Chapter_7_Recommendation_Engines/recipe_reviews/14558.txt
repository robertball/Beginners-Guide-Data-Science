Well, I tweaked this a bit. I used crushed ginger & garlic instead of powdered. I also added 2 tblsps of Hoisen sauce, a good drizzel of sesame oil, a tsp of cayenne pepper and a splash of lemon juice. I didn't have green onion on hand so I used some dehydrated onion in the mix (although I missed that green onion flavor). I forgot about it in the fridge, so it marinated for 2 days but was great. I'm not sure why other reviews said their steak was tough - I'm thinking maybe it wasn't sliced correctly? You need to cut "against" the grain and with a slight angle or it will be a tough. I feel if you cut flank steak properly it's actually quite tender (even without marinating it for days) I cooked mine on a George Forman indoor grill until it was  medium. You also need to let the grilled meat "rest" for 5 minutes or all the juices run out on first slice & the remaining won't be that juicy. Thanks for the marinade recipe that you can adjust to your own taste! I look forward to warmer weather when I can cook this on my outside grill! I sliced this thin and served with Japanese sticky rice. This would also be good sliced thin and used in lettuce wraps with other components as well, just another idea.

Not bad - it does make the meat very tender if you marinate it at least overnight, and most people will surely not find fault with honey and soy sauce.
That being said, know that the dominant flavors are going to be very Asian tasting: soy & honey, creating what amounts to a sweet and slightly teriaki flavored soy sauce marinade. The vinegar helps tenderize the relatively tough cut used.  I personally added 1 tsp. liquid smoke and some coarse-ground black pepper (to taste). This  really should not be called "barbequed" flank steak, however, since (for one thing) there is absolutely no smoke preparation nor any BBQ 'flavor' involved whatsoever. The most prominent taste is clearly soy sauce, and the meat leans very strongly towards an Asian flair (not that there's anything wrong with that - in fact, I'd even add some ginger root or powder next time to kick it up in that direction).  This would really be best for thinly-cut (1/2 inch) flank steak, to be pan-fried quickly and sliced over white rice or noodles, maybe with some green onions, water chestnuts, and so on. For the purist, or those looking for a traditional or truly "london broil" type preparation (or styled marinade), this probably isn't what you're looking for.

Awesome recipe. Although I still prefer my mom's marinade recipe, this was great! We all loved the juicy, tastiness of the meat and would make again. To all those who haven't tried this one yet...make sure you use the flank steak. As others have stated, this cut of meat really does turn out the best with this recipe. Thanks Harry and Martha!

My family loved this recipe.  I used 1/4 cup olive oil instead of 1/2 cup veg oil.  I marinated it for 24 hours and sliced it thinly when done, and it was very tender!

This is a fantastic marinade! The meat gets a wonderful color/glaze when cooked over a charcoal or gas grill. I cook it medium rare to medium and  slice it (against the grain) and serve it over spring mix lettuce, sliced tomatoes, roasted red peppers and top it with crumbled gorgonzola and serve it with a balsamic type viniagrette and a side of crusty french bread and a nice glass of red or white wine. Very easy and elegant!

This marinade added a blast of flavor to my flank steak. I was surprised how good it tasted, especially considering how easy it was to prepare.

I marinated this overnight and broiled it about 4 inches from the heat for 14 minutes and it turned out perfectly medium.  My husband and I both really enjoyed this.

Well, I'm not sure what happened, but this wasn't great.  It smelled really terrific as it was marinating, but it tasted off - almost like wild game!  Very odd.  Probably won't try again.

This is truly an outstanding marinade for flank steak.  I always marinade it overnight, and cook until rare, anymore and the steak will be tough.  Cut it thin to win against the grain, and serve it with some Castello Cheese, I usually just take a bit of cheese off with my knife and roll it in a slice of the steak. Trust me on the cheese...the two flavors really meld well together.

OMG, we thought this was amazing!  Let me first say that I used flap meat just because that was what I had on hand.  I doubled the sauce and marinated it for almost 20 hours.  When I put the meat on the grill, I put the leftover marinade in a saucepan with a little cornstarch to thicken.  Served the meat over sticky white rice, topped with the sauce and a little chopped green onion....perfection!  This is going into regular dinner rotation for sure!  Thanks Martha!

This was the first time I have ever tempted to BBQ flank steak.  It was much better when I char-grilled this yummy steak during the last 5 minutes.  Excellent with flour tortillas and grilled sweet peppers!

Great Recipe - Simple ingredients packed full of flavor! Updated a little by using Olive Oil vs. the Veg. Oil.and I'm sure you could update the distilled white vinegar to balsamic, etc. However, I really made this just like stated and it was wonderful!  It's nice to make a simple old fashioned recipe! Absolutely condsider this recipe for your next BBQ! Hats off to Harry the Butcher and Martha for submitting it!

Personally, I loved this marinade. I thought it was very fresh, very Asian and super tasty. I did use low sodium soy sauce though since I find regular soy sauce way too salty for my taste. And technically this isn't barbecued steak, it's grilled steak, but that's a minor point. If you like Asian inspired flavors, you'll enjoy this marinade. Just remember to let your steak rest for five minutes after removing from the grill (to redistribute the juices) and cut on the diagonal, against the grain. Yummy!

This is a great marinade!  Everyone loved it.  I only changed the technique to marinade the meat: I use Ziplock bags and used about 1/3 of the quantity required to marinade the meat.  Thank for the recipe.

Mmm,Mmm,Mmm, This is the best marinade out there. I recommend marinating overnight for maximum taste. I swear you could use shoe leather and it will come out fork tender.And you can use this recipe for ANY meat including Venison. It is Awesome on game meats because it takes the "gamey" taste out of your meat! Also, I hate to drop names, but use Kikkomans soy sauce. You won't believe the difference. No salty taste, it allows the other flavors to come through and even accents them. Everyone raves on this recipe. Thank You from the bottom of our tummys!

Very good marinade! Great flavor combinations - it was a hit! Thank you! Instead of piercing with a fork, I scored it with a knife - forming a diamond pattern on both sides. This prevents the steak from shrinking too much as it cooks! :-)

Very suprised how awful this recipe was.  Usually the reviews are reliable, but in this case, the steak just did NOT have a good flavor.  I hate wasting food, but it was honestly inedible.  Also, be ready to REALLY clean your grill after trying this one!

This recipe is EXCELLENT.  To intensify the flavors, I opted for fresh grated ginger and fresh garlic as opposed to the recipe's powdered versions.  For the best results, make sure to always tenderize flank steak.

This is one of the best marinades I have ever made.  I do, however, use brown sugar instead of honey, balsamic vinegar instead of white and I don't use garlic.  This is my whole family's favorite and I use it mainly for boneless chicken breasts which I pound out before marinating.  It is wonderful!

Made as written and it was very good.  Next time added 1/2 teaspoon liquid smoke, 2 teaspoons kosher salt, and doubled the vinegar.  It was amazing.  I have no need to search for any other steak marinade recipes!

For those who think the soy sauce is overpowering.....try low sodium soy sauce.  It has really made a difference for me.

I prefer to use oyster sauce or teriyaki sauce as soy sauce is so overpowering.

Good recipe, but it can be made better by using fresh ginger. When marinating meat or vegetables, make sure you turn them from time to time, so that all sides rest in the marinade over a period of time. This helps them soak up all the flavor and, in the case of meat, helps tenderize.

The entire family raved about this marinade!  The flank steak was perfect.  Even my picky picky 15 yr. old son, who wont eat any meat with ANY fat on it, devoured the lean flank steak with this marinade.  We were all amazed we finally found a beef recipe the kid would eat!  Perfect & so easy...........my kind of recipe.

Delicious! We hardly ever buy flank steak, but decided to try this any way and it was wonderful. I used less oil, and subsituted brown sugar for the honey and cider vinegar for the white vinegar. Also used fresh ginger and fresh garlic instead of powdered.  Slice thinly against the grain to maximize tenderness and you will have a new family favorite!

We really enjoyed this.  I marinated it overnight.  I used minced garlic (in a jar) and Spice World ground ginger.  Forgot to blend it, but it worked out fine.  Rather than discard the marinade, I boiled it and sauteed yellow pepper strips and sliced onion in it.  Then I served all of it over rice.

This was delicious!  I didn't use flank steak, I had a flat iron steak.  I also didn't have any honey, so I made a stevia/sugar blend, and used minced garlic.  Marinated it for several hours and broiled it.  My husband and I loved it!

I'm a stalker, not a reviewer BUT in this case I MUST!!!!
I have used this recipe for more than a year with PERFECT results EVERY time. My favorite way to maximize the flavor is to slice my flank for skewers, or better, I cut up a full tenderloin into large cubes. I double the recipe and marinate for 2 full days. The key is the honey, I believe. Bring the meat to room temp, skewer on soaked bamboo, and place on HOT grill and then turn down. The searing charrs the sugar JUST enough. Some pieces never make it to the serving plate.
    All I can say is THANK YOU for this recipe. It's so perfectly delicious just the way it is. I am a hero at every event when it arrives!

This was ok.  Nothing too special.  It does make the meat very tender.  We found that is needed salt to bring out more of the flavors.  It would be better if you spiced it up, using cheyenne pepper or cumin or something.  It's way to sweet the way it is.  All in all a good basic marinade, but don't be afraid to play around with it.

Ok - well maybe I think every recipe I try on Allrecipes are 5 star...but they are!  This was wonderful.  I did add 3 cloves of real garlic into the marinade.  Also added a couple teaspoons of Cayenne for some punch.  I love flank steak   It was very tender when sliced against the grain...that's the only way.

This was a great recipe!  I added chopped garlic to it and marinated it for 48+ hours.  We took it camping this weekend and shared it with friends who also wanted the recipe.  For those reviewers who say it was tough, remember that you need to slice flank steak against the grain!

I do not eat any red meat but my husband does so I try my best to make a steak from time to time.  I have failed miserably many times so this time I tried this marinade.  Wow! I received great reviews.  I even took the chance to make it for other dinner guests and it was a hit.

I loved this recipe. I did add a few other things to it though like onion powder,steak tederiser,tobasco sauce,grey poupon country style mustard, adobo seasoning,salt & pepper, & steak sauce (A1). It was great. My dinner guests raved about how good the steak was. I also used it on the chicken too. That was a big hit too. Thanks Martha.

Really good basic marinade.  The whole family really liked it!  Like others, I made a few tweaks.  Used minced garlic, subbed seasoned rice vinegar for the distilled and peanut oil instead of vegetable.  I pounded both sides with a meat tenderizer and marinaded over night.  The flavor was good, but a little weak when we took a bite with rice.  Next time I'll add more garlic and ginger and make a double batch, reserving half to reduce a bit and serve as sauce.

Made it exactly as directed, except only marinated for 2 hours.  I'm sure it would be even better with a longer time, but it was delicious even with only a short marinade time!  Boiled the remaining marinade to make it safe and served the thinly sliced meat on a platter with the cooked marinade drizzled over.  Looking forward to the cold leftovers tomorrow night.  Thank you for sharing.

I did what others said and put in sesame oil and hoisin.  I let it marinate overnight, and it turned out really tender!  I added green onions too.  I think next time I will add real garlic and red chili flakes.

Pretty good marinade, I did tweek it a little. I used chinese cooking wine rather than vinegar and added about a teaspoon of chili garlic paste. Didn't make it too hot (i was a little worried!), kids didn't even know it was there but I could taste the flavor not the heat. 

Also, I only marinated for about 6 hrs, that was plenty.

I used this recipe and added garlic as some reviews suggested. It turned out pretty well. I only had time to marinate the flank steak for 6 hours. I think next time I will only use this marinade if I have time to marinate it longer. I also used it to marinate veggies (zucchini, red onion, mushroom, and bell pepper). Then I skewered and grilled the veggies. They turned out great. I think I liked the marinade better on the veggies than the steak.

Edible, but not great. Made exactly as recipe said, except used low sodium soy sauce. The meat was very tender, but the flavor was not very good. Won't be making this again. I'll resume my search for the perfect steak marinade............

This was so good.  Great the first day, and perhaps even better as leftovers. I was trying to duplicate a recipe at a nearby Chinese restaurant, and this did it!  We broiled it in our gas oven until it turned slightly brown--the caramelized honey is so good.

Yum!!!I sliced my flank steak thinly when still slightly frozen and put it in a zip lock bag. Made the marinade in a bowl and wisked it with a whisk, easier than a blender. I then poured the marinade into zip lock bag and let marinade over night. Turning it over periodically. The only substitution I made was I used terriyaki marinade instead of the soy sauce so it wouldn't be so salty. Next day I skewered it on shish ka bobs alternating it with portabella mushrooms. Then grill for a few minutes. Doesn't take long. MMMMMM came out excellant and the family said it was one of their favorites! Thanks for the recipe!

This was a pretty decent marinade with what seemed to be chinese inspired flavors.  I chose to use top sirloin,  fresh grated ginger and fresh grated garlic, I marinated it for 4 hours, then oven broiled it somewhere in between medium and medium rare.  It created a tasty camarelized, sweet crust and was juicy and somewhat tender inside.  For me personally, I prefer a more savory steak than sweet but for what is was, it was quite delicious! My husband really enjoyed it as well :)

This was delectable!  I marinated it for about a day and a half (because something came up the night I planned to cook it!).  This was to our favor -- it really was tender and delicious.  I would like to try this marinade with chicken or pork tenderloin also.

Excellent! The grocery store didn't have flank steak so I used a NY Sirloin.  OMG this was like butter. I marinated for about 32 hours.  I felt good not using a bottled marinate.  Hubby loved it.  This ones a keeper.

I loved it. My 3 year old loved it.  My husband wouldn't finish his.  He said it was way too tough.  I  substituted brown sugar for honey, broiled 7 minutes per side.

One of my "go-to" recipes when I want something that can't miss for company. The only change I make: I use brown sugar instead of honey, just because I never seem to have honey on hand. Everyone loves it!

What a fabulous recipe!  I changed a couple of ingredients: I used some habanero white vinegar and fresh minced ginger and garlic. I marinated the flank steak for three days. When I told my husband what was marinating, he told me he hated flank steak. But, of course, he loved this!  I cooked it on a hot grill for a total of 15 minutes, and of course, sliced it against the grain.  Thank you for a wonderful marinade!

This marinade is very tasty. I whipped it up and placed the steaks in it for only half an hour as it was a last minute enhancer. My hubby said it was ok - but he cleaned his plate! I loved it! YUMMY!

I'm a really picky eater, but I must say this recipe was absolutely delicious. The meat was so tender and full of flavor.  I will be making this recipe again!!
It took about 12 minutes (6 minutes per side) and I served it with Garlic Mashed Red Potatoes. Excellent Meal! Thanks :)

I marinated for a few days b/c I was too busy to cook it, but it was great.   I did add a few cloves of fresh garlic as mentioned by others.  10-12 minutes of the grill and it was perfect.   Will definitely do again, the hubby loved it as well.   Oh ya, didn't use blender, just mixed together it in a big plastic (pan sized) container with lid and kept it in there for the few days.

I have made flank steak with this marinade over and over again. My family and many guest that I have served this to love it every time. I do recomend that you marinade the flank steak for at least 24 hrs. for best flavor.

OMG the flavor of this is exceptional.
Combinations seem a bit weird. But after marinating for about 24 hrs this tastes awesome.

I love flank steak and am always looking for new marinades.  This will be my main recipe from now on.  It was delicious.  I let it marinate for 32 hours.  It was so tender and flavorful.  I can't wait to make it again!

Fabulous marinade for meat. We've done tri-tip and rib eye. Both parties were successful. Better marinated overnight opposed to a quick hour I tried the second time. More flavor. Thanks, Martha!

Fantastic Marinade - Only had two hours but came out wonderful. Didn't have honey; only can imagine the taste letting it sit over night! About 2 mins before pulling the steaks off the BBQ, i added just a little butter on top - highly recommended, brings out the flavor of the steaks!

I don't eat steak, and actually, I'm a vegetarian entirely.  BUT, I made this for my fiance and he loved it!  He usually just likes his steaks plain with some Heinz 57, but he certainly didn't need it with this marinade.  PS -I cross-scored the steak in diamond shapes

Great marinade...I did however add a couple of things. First, I crushed a garlic clove into the mixture, and I added a tablespoon of balsamic vinegar and lastly I added a tablespoon of a spice mixture called 'Mama Africa'. It is a mix of wild ginger, garlic and spicy peppers. WOW!!! was this awsome. I also used this on skirt steak and some of my neighbors were peaking over the fence to ask what I was grilling!!!

Love, Love, Love this. I don't know about the picture shown. But the flank steak we buy is boneless. My husband cooks it on his Big Green Egg and then we slice it up and make fajitas out of it! Wonderful!

Very good.  Sliced steak to 3/4 inch thick before marinating.  Maybe use less oil next time.

Awesome!! Don't change a thing!! Make sure that you cut your meat in thin slices after you grill it. Let meat rest at least 10 minutes. That is the trick with flank steak, thin slices that are against the grain. My 1 and 2 year old could eat this meat it was so tender.

Very good.  Meat was very tender with a good flavor. I used tamari (soy sauce) because I have found that it has a better flavor and doesn't overwhelm.  Also used fresh ginger and garlic.   Will definitely make this one again.

This is wonderful! We doubled this and used white vinegar and rice vinegar. We subbed olive for vegetable oil. We put some minced garlic and onion powder in also. We marinated the beef for 24 hours. I didn't bother with the blender,  I just put it all in a ziploc bag and squished it around, added the meat and tossed lightly. When placing this on the grill be very careful as the flame shoots up, I guess due to the honey. We had a wonderful meal with this recipe, thank you so much for sharing!

My husband and I just had this for dinner and it was really delicious.  I added a few cloves of chopped garlic to the marinade to give it more of a garlic taste.  You have to be really careful not to burn the steak while it is on the bbq, especially since it is a think cut of beef.  Flame ups are also a concern - just make sure to let all of the marinade drip off before placing on the grill.  I would definitely make this again!

I quadrupled this recipe for my daughter's 4th Birthday Party.  There were about 25+ adults.  Needless to say, there was not a single sliver remaining at the end of the night!  I almost don't want to share it with anyone so that I can continue to bask in the praise.  Absolutely delicious, absolutely easy.  Use plastic bags to marinate.  No mess, no cleanup, throw them right on the grill - the flank steaks, not the bags! A new family BBQ must-have!  Thanks!

I agree with other reviewers that this marinade really tenderizes the meat, but it lacks the punch that I had hoped for.  I rate the flavor as being pretty tame.

My husband and I both enjoyed this.  I let it marinate overnight and it was very flavorful.  The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because it was really messy to grill.

I tried this recipe after reading all the rave reviews.  It wasn't great but it wasn't awful either, just ho-hum.  We ended up using A-1 Steak Sauce at the table because the meat just didn't have alot of zing to it.  I guess I was looking for a marinade with more tang and zip to it.  One really good thing about this marinade is that it does a great job of tenderizing the meat.  I marinated the meat overnight (London Broil) and it was much more tender than usual.  Thanks for the recipe Martha but this was just a little too bland for my family's tastes.  I may try this again but it will need something more for a little zip!

When I first sliced this (across the grain)-I had my doubts as it sliced tough. It turned out fantastic! We will definitely make it again.
I do think 20 minutes on a hot grill is too long, though. I went 8 minutes first side, 7 minutes 2nd side.

I used pork sirloins instead of flank steak and even my mom who doesent like pork raved about it. I put it in a shallow baking dish and flipped every couple of hours to let the marinade flow evenly. The flavor was EXCELLENT!! This marinade was a winner!!!!

The marinade was good, but I was expecting something amazing.  The flank steak itself was very tough!  We made this for my parents and no body seemed to rave about it.  If I make this again, I'll just use the marinade on a different kind of meat.  Thanks Martha.

This steak was good but I marinated it for over 24 hours and it wasn't nearly as flavorful as I expected.  I also don't think it served 4 as the recipe states.

So bland, had to add good amount of seasoned salt half way through cooking. Why spend all the time to prepare this when marinating a flank in Catalina salad dressing is at least twice as good? Sorry for the poor reveiw, but it doesn't deserve more, and I really wanted it to taste good while I was preparing it. Oh well.

I love this marinade. We barbequed the steak and the meat just melted in your mouth. It is best done overnight but still tastes good after a few hours marinating. Will definitely be making this again. The best!

I would recommend a different cut of mean - Ribeye? - for this recipe.  BBQ'd flank steak is rather tough!  Flank steak is better for stir frying.

We tried this recipe this past weekend and ended up using it THREE times.  The first time we cut up a boneless sirloin for shish-kebob and marinated it (using fresh garlic and ginger) and it was unbelievable!  The next day we cut up chicken and pork and vegetables and marinated them, also wonderful!  The third day we marinated whole Delmonico steaks - wonderful again.  The longer you marinade the better!

Unbelievably tasty!!  I never knew flank could taste as good as this and be as tender as this.  Here in NZ flank is mainly used as sausagemeat, so I had to specially order it!!!  I have passed this recipe on to my butcher too.  Thank you for sharing this.

This is a stupendous recipe. I love the marinade, it's so sweet! I think, however, that I would have cooked it a bit longer if I had known what was inside. Otherwise, I had about 4 pieces!

We all loved this recipe. As the weather didn't permit outside grilling, I placed steaks in shallow baking dish, topped with sliced onions, peppers and mushrooms and poured marinade over all. It was a great hit. Thank you for sharing the recipe

Came out wonderful. I've made this twice on two different gas grills and both times it took 25 minutes total to reach medium.

I upped the servings to 90 and marinated a box of flank steak for a meal at a family reunion last August.  Along with dutch oven sides, this recipe received rave reviews when we served it and was requested to be prepared again at the next family reunion. We now prepare smaller batches for our own family and can hardly wait to prepare this again.

We loved this recipe.  I rarely eat steak, but this was fantastic.  I made the following minor modifications: I used low sodium soy sauce, apple cider vinegar, 1/3 cup oil and fresh garlic. I think the tenderness depends on the steak because I bought two and one turned out more tender than the other, although they were both great.  Easy weeknight meal!

This marinade was delicious.  In the future I'll use a different, more tender meat because even after 24 hours of marinating, flank steak still isn't that tender.

Very easy and flavorful marinade.  I lowered the oil to 2 tbsp of olive oil and added a bit more soy sauce and water instead.  I also used fresh ginger and garlic, minced.  I broiled it in the oven since I don't have a grill - 15 minutes on each side came out a little overcooked, so 10 minutes should be perfect.

I needed a quick marinade and I had all of the ingredients on hand for this.  I was only able to marinate for 2 hours, but it was still very good.  Instead of the ginger, salt and pepper I used Montreal Steak Seasoning.  The kids and hubby all had seconds- a keeper.

I was salivating just making the marinade--it smelled soooo good!!  Marinade gave the meat a nice flavor, but next time I will definately marinade overnight instead of just 8 hours.  Used fresh grated ginger root instead of powder--I think it really makes a difference.  Can't wait to make again!

This is a fantastic recipe.  It never fails to please. I have even tossed the steak in the marinade and popped it in the cooler when we are going camping.  When we arrive, it's ready to cook over the campfire. So tasty.

Followed the directions exactly and allowed the meat to marinate overnight.  Cooked it medium rare and sliced thinly across the grain.  Still way too tough to me.  Definitely needs an extra step or two to tenderize before marinating.  Also, I agree with a lot of the reviewers that while the flavor was pleasant, it just needed something more.

We absolutely LOVE this recipe!!  We've made it twice when we have people over and every time there's never enough.  We always get rave reviews.  The only thing we do diffently is add a little balsamic vinegar.  We slice it very thin and serve it rare as a finger food.

The marinade rated 5 stars. My choice of steak, because my grocery store didn't have flank steak, rated about 4 stars.  Great marinade!  Will try it again with other cuts of meat.

This was amazing. I don't have a BBQ, so I mixed the marinade in a glass bowl, cut the flank steak into thin strips, and added them to the marinade in the bowl. I accidentally forgot the oil in the marinade, but it still tasted great so I may not add it in the future either. I marinated for 8 hours and cooked the strips in a hot frying pan with a bit of vegetable oil. It only took a couple of minutes to cook, and they came out very tasty and tender. I'll definitely make this again!

This marinade made the meat very tender compared to others I've used. I think because my family has very bold tastes, next time I need to add way more garlic to it and maybe even a touch of hot sauce. We didn't notice that there was a great deal of flavour.

I just had to do a review on this one!  This is one of the greatest marinades ever.  My husband is a huge fan of honey and I myself am not.  But when you take these ingredients and combine them its a perfect marriage.  I followed the directions but did not have ginger so I had to use nutmeg.  It was still perfect.  It is sweet to the first taste and then the other ingredients follow through.  I loved it.  I have since passed this one on to many people who also enjoy it.  I made this on a Thursday and my husband requested it again Saturday night.  Try this receipe atleast once and you will be amazed.  I also forgot to mention that I skiped the  blender and placed marinade a steak in a zip lock bag.  I marinated the steak for 8 hours and might (if I can wait) marinate it over night.

I've never ever revieved any of the recipes I've tried from Allrecipes, but HAD to log on and say how GREAT this was!  Every time I make steak, it's like shoe leather. This one was tender, moist and juicy, you cannot mess this one up! I had to stop myself to save some for my husband and my 2 1/2 year old son loved it too! I'll make this one once a week!!!

Great recipe.  Took others advice and added 3 cloves of garlic and a 1/2 inch piece of gingeroot to the marinade in addition to the dry spices.  I marinated it overnight.  What a wonderful flavor.  It's a keeper!

i marinated the steak (sirloin) overnight, and it did taste tender and sweet.  i even added extra soy sauce to it beforehand (as i felt there was a lot of oil).  it definitly needs a little more kick though.  on top of the garlic and ginger powder i would **definitly** add some fresh garlic as well and maybe some more ground ginger.  i will use this recipe again but will definitly be making those changes, it's a great recipe it just needs a little bit more flavour on top of getting the steak tender and sweet.

This is a great and tasty marinade. I loved the touch of sweetness. I added a couple of fresh garlic cloves. I didn't have flank steak so I used top round and it still turned out fairly tender. Would be good to slice thin and make steak sandwiches.

My husband loved this and the kids didn't think it was too bad either.  It was very tender and flavorful.  I cut the leftover meat in thin strips and made fajitas with them the next day.

I marinated the flank steak for 24+ hours and then broiled it.  I wasn't that impressed.  I didn't think the meat had that much flavor.  I normally marinate a flank steak overnight with a whole bottle of Italian dressing.  It's easier and I think it tastes better too.

This was very good. However I think that I would marinate for longer next time (2 nights) because we didn't find it had enough flavor. I marinated overnight and used a George Foreman grill. I also found it to taste a little greasy. I may try cutting back on the oil a little bit next time.

The first words out of my seven year olds mouth were "this is the best meat I have ever had" this from a kid who begs to go out to dinner every night. All my kids ate two helpings. We grilled it up in minutes. Could not have been easier and will be making again and again!

This is a FANTASTIC recipe.  I am not typically a fan of sweet meat, but the marinade for this recipe really delivers.  The flank steak grills beautifully (great color!), and the taste is mouthwatering.  We had guests over for this one (first time we'd cooked it - ever), and it was an absolute hit!...  they not only took seconds but demanded the recipe!  A+

Great recipe!  I followed the recipe to the "T", except that I broiled the steak in the oven.  It came out perfectly.  Can't wait to try this on the grill.  Thanks for sharing.

I thought that this marinade was just ok.  It really could have used some "zing" - if I make it again I'll add some fresh garlic and cut back on the oil while increasing the soy and vinegar.

I really loved this recipe.  I have a lot of recipes for Marinated Flank Steak and this one really is in the top 10!  You can definitely grill flank steak outdoors.  If the steak is tough, you are slicing it the wrong way.  It has to be sliced against the grain. It could also be tough because it was cooked too long.

I found this recipe to be rather salty and boring.  My husband did not care for it either.  I much prefer the Korean bar-b-que marinade.

I agree with many of the comments that this needs to cook longer than 20 minutes. Althought the taste was good I found it a little disapointing in that I thought it would have had a much more intence flavor.

Well, I thought the marinade was very tasty and I will probably use the marinade again for any steak cuts.  Our flank steak was good, but not as spectacular as I had expected based on the reviews.  I remember the taste from my childhood - it tastes very similar to a recipe my parents used in the 70s.  Next time I will try broiling the meat instead of grilling.

I love this recipe because the meat tastes wonderful after marinating.  I only marinated it from morning until evening and it came out fine.  Marinating flank steak is a lazy way to make a wonderful meal.  All work is done in the morning, if any, and just cook it on the grill for dinner.  Didn't broil because I like the grill the best.  These ingredients I always have on hand!

My butcher also gave me this recipe over 20 years ago.  Only my recipe has an added 1 Cup of chopped onion.  I fully concur with the other reviewers.  This recipe is the best and I have given this recipe out many times.

This marinade made our flank steak de-licious!  It retains a wonderful grilled flavor when cooked on a barbeque.  The steak is so tender you can cut it with a dull butter knife!

We had this steak as the main dish at a neighborhood bbq. The meat was so tender, we could cut it using plastic utensils!  Both adults and kids liked it.  We marinated the flank steak for 24 hour which is the only reason I don't consider it a Quick recipe.

This is my one of my favorite recipes. I usually follow a recipe once and then adjust to my own tastes, but I have not varied from this recipe in the ten years that I have been making it. My family loves it, and I always receive compliments when I make it for others. Thank you for sharing!
Edit:  I forgot that I do change the veg oil to olive oil and the white vinegar to apple cider vinegar.

Yes, this has soy sauce in it and that’s what makes it great.  Marinaded it for 24 hours and grilled to medium rare.  It was tender and delicious.

This was so easy and good! I can't grill steak very well, but this turned out great! Even my mother-in-law (who is hard to impress) really liked it. I think I'll try the marinade on some other meats too...

We really, really enjoyed this.  I marinated in a bag for 24 hours.  The flank steak was very tender.  My son who doesn't like steak said "I don't like steak, mom, but I love this!"  We'll definitely make this again!

I don't usually think about cooking early enough to marinade, but I tried, using this recipe & it was delicious. Everyone noticed the great flavor, & it was very different from what I usually make. I did cook it a little longer, but my grill temp may have been different. I just may try some marinating again. Great results!

I marinated the flank steak overnight and the meat was very, very tender (& flank steak can be chewy!) so I was pleased with that part.  Otherwise, I think next time I will add more seasonings and spices as it didn't appear to be very flavorful.  Will try again.

HI,
I forgot to rate this last July.  I did this for my husband's 50th birthday party I used a tritip steak instead of the flank and marinated it overnight.  It was a big hit with everyone.  Will do again.  Just wonderful.

This marinade gave a very nice well-balanced flavor. We loved it. I used it on chunks of beef tenderloin that I skewered and baked for a few minutes at 450. They looked and tasted great.

This is a wonderful marinade for almost any meat - super duper on steak and pork chops! I used tarragon vinegar instead of distilled - don't know how much that changes the flavor, but it's definately good!

Our family doesn't eat much red meat, so having steaks on the 4th of July was a treat.  This recipe is super easy and best of all uses things that you already have in your house.  I wish I had marinated overnight, as the flavor probably would have been even better, but even with 8 hours it was great. My two boys ( 5 & 9) asked for seconds and thirds and my picky husband loved it too. He told me to keep this one, which he rarely says.  Thanks!!!!

This marinade gave the steak a wonderful flavor!  The only change I made was reducing the oil to 1/4 c.  Will use this one again and again!

My family loves this marinade.  I try to make it the night before and let it sit overnight.  Makes the meat a little bit sweet.  Delicious.

Very good and really easy to make.  My son asked if it was "chicken on a stick" which is actually these Thai Beef Skewers I sometimes buy from the grocery store I shop at.  I had the guy at the meat counter tenderize the flank steak a bit too since flank steak can often be tough.  The only thing I might do different in the future is start marinating the meat in the AM instead of the night before...it could have been a tad less "marinatey".

My husband hates Flank Steak, but I had some in the freezer and didn't want to waste it.  I made this recipe and he absolutely loved it.  He said it was one of the best steaks he has had in a long time!!!  I couldn't belive it :)  I follwed the recipe exactly (except used a zip lock bag instead of a dish to marinade).

FABULOUS.  We marinate this for at least 24 hours and it is melt-in-your-mouth great!  This will be a regular at our table.  Thanks so much.

Perfection!  I marinated this for a day and a half and I also added a little balsamic vinegar and Montreal Steak Seasoning!  Cooked it slow at first and then the last few minutes put the grill on high to sear the flavor. It is important to let the meat rest for 5 - 10 minutes to redistribute the juices before cutting.  Nothing left on my son's and boyfriend's plates!  EXCELLENT!

We love this.  When flank steaks go on sale for less than a couple dollars a pound, we stock up.  I freeze each one in a freezer bag with about four times the marinade.  We grill it when it defrosts, and the meat is SO tender and tasty.  I also make extra marinade to drizzle over our potatoes and onions, and we mop it up with bread.  Yum!!

The best marinade ever! 
This was so good. My husband is filipino and I have a hard time getting his meat to have flavor. he is not a big fan of the meat flavor us americans like. This was the perfect marinade to marinade our steaks in for a couple days! thanks so much! I will use this on any type of steak! I didn't use the garlic powder though, i only had minced garlic on hand. it worked out perfectly!

Wonderful!  I did not have garlic powder so I used minced garlic and kept everything else as written.  Not a big fan of flank steak so I made with tenderloin steaks on the grill and my family enjoyed quite a bit.  Thanks

Prepared exactly as directed. The marinade was phenomenal. It was sweet with just the right amount of tart from the vinegar. My wife enjoyed the marinade. It kept the meat very juicy and tender. Definite keeper for the recipe book. Wonder what this would taste like with a filet?

People....if you want a tender flank, cut against the grain!  This marinade is geat if your looking for a sweet, tangy, TENDER piece of meat.  I loved it, will alternate it with my spicy rub to mix things up sometimes.

Very tasty!  My whole family, including my picky 22 mo. old loved it.  Added about 4 chopped garlic cloves and cut the oil down to 1/4 cup.  I will add this to my "favorite recipes".

This was the best flank steak I've ever made.  My pickiest child even rated it an A+++.  We will definitely make this again.  Next time I make this I will cut down the amount of oil, though, because we had a lot of flare-ups on the grill.  Martha, thanks for sharing your great recipe!  We're going to use last night's leftovers for fajitas tonight.

This was a fabulous way to prepare a cut of beef that is traditionally not so good. As other reviewers suggested, I added a couple of cloves of minced garlic and about 1 tbsp fresh minced ginger.  We did not find this beef to sweet as others have suggested - it was just right.  Very good - I suspect this will become a regular meal in our house.

I used half the marinade on a 1lb sirloin steak and let the steak marinate for 2 days.  Pretty tasty, but a little sweet for us.  If I use this recipe again, I'll definitely use less honey.

Excellent!  Very moist, tasty and tender.  Followed recipe as written, except I added some fresh garlic and ginger.  Marinated it a day and a half.  Lots of flavor.  My new favorite marinade.

Definitely had a weird flavor. I wasn't impressed at all.. and there was way too much oil. My husband ate it, but doused it in barbecue sauce. Sorry, I won't be making this again.

Excellent!! Marinated the flank steak for 24 hours and grilled. Great flavor. I did make a few changes...I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil.....rice wine vinegar and added 3 sliced scallions to the marinade...yummy!

GREAT marinade... needed to be left to marinade even longer.  I had a massive flank steak, and there wasn't a single piece left over.  Thank you.

Amazing recipe.  VERY EASY!  You must tenderize the steak while it marinates by poking it with a fork every few hours.  Marinate overnight so it is very tender.  Flank tends to be a little tough, but by doing this you will be set!

This was pretty good... but I do agree with the other reviewers that it lacks a "kick."  Basically a good teriyaki flavor, nothing wrong with that.

Grocer didn't have flank, so I used choice tri-tip. Perfecto-mundo! My 5-yr-old refuses to eat any form of beef, BUT LOVED THIS! Next time, I save the marinade, cook it down a bit, and try over rice. Thank you for sharing this recipe!

I cannot believe how tender and delicious our Flank Steak was using this marinade.  We have cooked Flank Steak for years and have never had it turn out so good.  Don't change this recipe at all - it is absolutely the best.  Thank you "Harry The Butcher".

Nice recipe. The soy sauce gives the meat a Japanese touch. We grilled the meat only about 5 minutes since we like our meat medium raw.

Wow, I have to ditto the praise from all the other members.  This was extremely easy to prepare and the taste was great.  I used fresh garlic and fresh ginger.  Also, I noticed marinating it overnight strengthens the flavor and makes the meat more tender.  Thanks!!!

Wow!  This bets my regular marinade recipe.  we make the sauce in a belnder, tranfered steak and all to a ziploc bag and marinaded overnight.  Very tender when using a thick cut steak.  Tonight we will try London Broil using a flavor injection since i forgot to marinade last night.  Thanks fir a great recipe!

This recipe is AWESOME.  The first time I used it was for a special dinner that I made for friends of ours, they now believe me to be a very good cook!  I plan to use the Marinade again to make dinner for my inlaws.  I'm sure it will knock the socks off my father-in-law who is a master in the kitchen  :O)   THANK YOU SOOOOO MUCH MARTHA FOR SHARING THIS RECIPE!!!!

I often make flank steak and am always looking for new recipes.  This one is delicious, an a little on the sweet side.   I used fresh garlic (three cloves) and fresh, grated ginger (two teaspoons).  The flavor was excellent.  I look forward to making this recipe again.

Holy COW!!!  This recipe was awesome!  Everytime we opened the fridge while it was marinating, our mouths watered.  It was calling to us!  Once done & my husb brought it in from the grill - AAHHH!  My 2 yr old kept saying "more dake, more dake." A hit with the 4 yr old, too, & he's the toughest critic.  Great for company if you want to WOW them.

Oh my goodness.. my children are very picky eaters and they absolutely loved this! The recipe was extremely easy and quick.  Marinated for approx 20mins only!  Even though I poked a million holes in it and it turned out very tasty and tender.  I will definitely keep this recipe!  Thank you so much.

This was a wonderful recipe. It was quick, it was easy and it made the Steak taste sweet and salty at the same time, but not too much of both. I only marinated for a couple hours and was still able to get the effect.

A five star rating doesn't do this recipe justice! It is definitely a "winner" and I am so happy to add it to my list of top recipes!  I will use this recipe often which will result in a very happy family!  My children ate so much dinner that I was almost in a state of shock! My husband raved about it even after dinner was over.  Try it....you'll be happy that you did! :)

A very easy and quick recipe.  For a more flavorful and bold taste use fresh ginger and garlic with a bit of frest basil. Also, cut down on the soy a bit to reduce the saltiness.  Overall a great marinade.

What a wonderful marinade. We have used this for 
flank steak, chicken (legs and tenders) and pork chops. I whisked the ingredients instead of using the blender. This is a true keepes for sure!
Hats off to Martha.

I agreed with Bizzysmom's review, the marinade was average.  It did make the steak
a very nice color after grilled (it looked beautiful), but it could have used a little more 
flavor.  Flank steak is very lean so it depends on the marinade for taste.  Overall it is 
a good recipe, I will just modify it in the future to add some extra spice.  Maybe lots 
of chopped garlic would do it.

This is a very good sauce.  I actually never used it for marinating, just put it on when I was barbequing.  Turned out pretty good, if I used it for marinating the steak would of been even better!

In Australia, we call Flank Steak, Rump steak, but regardless of the name
this marinade makes it taste delicious.  Only one piece of steak was left
from about 20 pieces after our BBQ.  My husband made a point of telling me
in the midst of all of the commotion that the steak was beautiful and our guests
 commented as well.  Thanks for making my sons 1st birthday such as success,
 by helping me serve something that everyone talked about!

I had high hopes for this marinade...but it just tasted like your average teriyaki marinade to me.  It was easy, and good...but not as good as I expected from all the glowing reviews.  And by the way, flank steak is not an inexpensive cut of meat in my area...it's in great demand as fajita meat so commands a higher price.  Thanks for sharing.

In reading other reviews of this recipe, it's apparent that the "toughness/tenderness" ratio is less of a result of this marinade recipe, but rather the grade of meat you purchase.  This is obviously true for all meat dishes.

This recipe is tasty to soy sauce fans.  If you're not a big soy sauce lover, then you may want to reduce the amount of soy sauce.

I had high hopes for this recipie, and I will admit, it was a nice marinade.  It truely made for the most flavourful shoe leather I've ever had!  Prehaps it was the meat, but thank goodness I didn't follow the cooking time.

This was really good tasting and juicy.  I was expecting it to be much more tender after marinating for 2 days and as other reviewers had suggested not needing a steak knife to cut it.  I used apple cider vinegar instead of distilled, real garlic and 1 lemon juiced.  I didn't have ginger and it still came out good.  Will try again using the ginger next time.

My seven year old boy HATES steak, but he loved this and actually asked for seconds.  This is a must try for the steak, and even not steak lovers.  I highly recommend this marinade.  The only reason I didn't give it five stars accross the board is because the honey is hard to dig out of the spoon.  DELICIOUS!!!!!!!  EXQUISITE!!!!

I had high hopes for this one, but I found my off the shelf 30 minute marinade was better tasting (and a lot quicker).  I was leery about putting a lot of holes in the flank steak, because my theory is the natural juices run out and the meat gets tough.  That's what happened.  And I didn't cook it even half suggested time, because the meat would have been shoe leather by that time.  As it was, it was not as tender as it should have been from 24 hours of marinating.

This was good, but not as good as I expected.  I'm not a big red meat fan and there was a little too much oil for my taste in the marinade ... I'd be curious to see how it would work with chicken ?

I didn't have all the ingredients and I replaced honey with sugar, white distilled vinegar
with rice vinegar, ground ginger and garlic with fresh grated ginger and fresh chopped
garlic, veg. oil with sesami oil.  It was a food from heaven.  We didn't even need steak
knife.  I think the tip is not to over cook on the grill.

My grandmother passed this recipe on to my mother and my mother then passed it on to me and it is the best marinade I've ever had and extremely easy because the ingredients are always on hand.  The only difference in ours is we don't use the ground ginger.  I also prefer to use fresh garlic in mine which gives it a great taste.

What a simple and delicious marinade! It was the first time I cooked a flank steak and it turned out great! I, too, used lemon juice instead of vinegar, and fresh garlic instead of grated. I e-mailed this recipe to everyone in my online address book. Thanks, Martha!

Excellent!!! It was so tender, juicy & moist.  The marinade was just perfect.  I cooked it on the grill and it was so simple.  I also wrapped some red & green peppers, red onions, & drizzled with a little olive oil in foil paper & cooked them on the grill until tender.  I served the steak with the peppers & onions on fresh hard rolls. Everyone can't wait until I make it again.

I was so impressed with this recipe.  I always grill marinated filets because they are so tender.  I was amazed how tender and tasty this steak was, and so was the company I served it to.  An added bonus is that it costs alot less than filets.  I will definitely serve this often.  Thanks alot for this recipe!!

This is my favorite! I always marinate over night.  And the best part is I take the leftover and toss them into a salad for lunch the next day.  My husband and I look forward to this every time.  I marinate--he grills!

This was the ultimate best.  I did use fresh garlic, but otherwise made no changes.  I doubled the marinade and in addition to a flank steak, also marinaded some boneless, skinless chicken breasts.  Yummy! Next times you are going to have a cook-out and want to have to guests think you really know what you are doing...try both the flank steak and chicken.  I  can't say enough good things about this.  Try it..you won't be sorry!

The marinade on this steak smelled wonderful -- it was hard to wait until dinnertime to grill it.  It turned out perfectly, and the flavor was exquisite.  This one's a keeper!

I have made this twice, once with flank )marinated 4 hrs.) and once with london broil(marinated over night) Both were abslolutly wonderful. The substitutions I made  were I used lemon juice instead of the vinegar and I used  Splenda ( a honey substitute). Once again this is a definite keeper

This was my first time ever making flank steak.  Boy what a treat, i marinated it for more like 48 hours, it was quick and easy on the grill.  It was tender and deeeeelicious and my 8 year old daughter loved it and asks when we are having it again.  My boyfriend says two thumbs up for a first time flank steak for me.  Lots of my friends have tried it and loved it.  Very easy just should leave at least 24 hours for marinading.  Excellent!

I use this basic recipe with the addition
of a few gourmet touches that will make your
guests say, "ooolala" the perfect steak
that needs no steak sauce at all.
Just add lemon juice instead of vinegar,
brown sugar instead of honey, a touch of ground
coriander and cumin. One Tablespoon of sherry,
(optional) and one teaspoon of liquid smoke.
Marinate several hours and grill to your
favorite doneness.  This will be the best
tasting steak you will ever wrap your lips
around!  Garonteed!

This was a definite hit at our family  barbeque.  And it was as good cold as it was hot.  We can't wait to have another barbeque and serve it to our friends!

This was easy to prepare ahead of time and my guests really liked it.  It was effortless to cook and you can choose to grill(my favorite) or broil.

Great recipe!  
I add some fresh chopped garlic to the
marinade, rather than garlic powder.
A small change that only takes a few
minutes, but greatly enhances the
flavour. (If you love garlic!)

This was the first flank steak we have done and it was great! We left out the ginger, and it was still great. Great left overs for sandwiches!

The recipe for Barbequed Marinated Flank Steak was the best marinate that I have gotten off the internet.  It tastes just like those beef teryaki sticks that you get at a chinese resturaunt.  Absolutely a must try!!
