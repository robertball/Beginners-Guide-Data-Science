These were the "hit" at my holiday party - make sure to have designated drivers at the ready as they can sneak up on you!

This is delightful.  The addition of the cinnamon schnapps adds the perfect amount of jazz, differentiating it from other chocolate martinis.  I made it plain, and also with the glass lined with melted dark chocolate, and both were wonderful.  Obviously, the glass lined with melted dark chocolate enhanced the chocolate flavor, but I recommend trying both methods.
