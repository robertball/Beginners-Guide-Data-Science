MELTS IN YOUR MOUTH-YUMM! I have two words for all you who are having so much trouble getting your cookies out of the pan.  PARCHMENT PAPER
buy it, use it, you will have no more problems and you will never go back.   Since some people said this didn't have enough flavor, I compared it with other recipes.  Due to this I used 2 tsp of vanilla, 1.5 tsp of salt, and of course, who would use margarine when you could use butter.  Beat the heck out of the sugars and butter and oil and eggs so it is almost like cake batter.  The dough is very soft so a quick chill in the fridge makes it easy to work with.  Very well liked, have had someone ask for the recipe where ever I take them. Thanks Mary Ann-Permanantly in my cookie recipe box.

I've been working on this recipe - I think that if you implement it as written, it's a four stars recipe but you can modify it to make it a five star recipe.  Here are the things that I did to make the most of these pecan sandies: (1) For the sugar, I kept the confectioner's sugar the same but for the cup of white, instead I used 1/2 cup white and 1/2 cup brown sugar; (2) Instead of using 1 cup oil and 1 cup margarine, I used 1 cup unsweetened applesauce and 1 cup butter; (3) I doubled the vanilla extract; (4) I added one dash of cinnamon (who knows if this actually added anything to the flavor); (5) I did freeze the dough for a half an hour before trying to roll it because it is gooey; (6) I did use parchment paper on the ungreased cookie sheet as other reviewers have recommended; (7) Once rolled into balls, the way I flattened the cookies was by pushing a half a pecan into the center (they don't spread much in the cooking); (8) Instead of rolling the dough balls in extra sugar, I cooked them without and then once cooked and cooled for a bit, I took a queue from another reviewer and brushed a maple glaze on the cookie.  The maple glaze recipe I used was to mix together the following ingredients: (a) 1 and 1/4 cups confectioner's sugar; (b) 1 tsp. vanilla extract; (c) 1/2 cup pure maple syrup.  Once I made these changes, these cookies blew my mind.  So delicious and different from a typical cookie.  Thanks so much for the recipe and for all the comments from reviewers.

These really DO taste like Keebler Pecan Sandies! Some reviewers wondered if brown sugar could be substituted for some of the white sugar.  That's what I did.  I used 1/2 cup packed light brown sugar AND 1/2 cup white sugar instead of all white sugar and they came out terrific.  No need to buy these at the store when I can make them at home.  Thanks for the recipe!

These are now requested more in my house than chocolate chip.  I make the dough, and scoop them onto parchment paper.  Then flash freeze them and put into freezer bags.  As I pull out a dozen to bake, they are thawed enough by the time the oven preheats.  Makes baking for the holidays easier.

These are great!  They have a yummy, tender, almost flaky texture.  I used butter instead of margarine, and canola oil.  Mine didn't spread out at all and stayed in pretty much a ball shape; it was probably because of the butter.  They're cute though!  The dough was very wet right until I added the pecans.  It was too squishy to "roll" in sugar, so I sprinkled it on with a spoon, (on some of them) and stuck whole pecans on top of the rest of them.  I cut the recipe in half, and used half brown sugar for the white.  I also used half whole-wheat pastry flour.  Baked for only 8-9 minutes.  I used unsalted butter and put in less salt than the recipe states; I could still taste the salt a little too much.  So if you use salted butter, you may want to cut way down on the extra salt.

These are delicious!  They don't spread much, so you can put a whole bunch on one cookie sheet.  They reminded me of Mexican wedding cookies, so I rolled some of them in powdered sugar -- but don't try that -- it was really sticky (and not as tasty).  When rolled in granulated sugar they are to die for!

These are my son's new favorite cookie.  The only thing I did different was substitute the margarine for half butter and half Crisco and I toasted the pecans.   They disappear quickly at our house!

How wonderful these charming cookies are to me! They were a tad bit challenging to stir for an old woman like me, but with some help from the man next door, they turned out so very fine. I shall serve them with a nice and light frothy beverage on a cool, crisp morning on the veranda.

These cookies are very good!  The dough is very soft, so you might want to refrigerate it before shaping into balls.

I have used many recipes from this site, but this is the first that I have been compelled to rate. I use alot of nuts in my baking, particularly pecans and this recipe is my new favorite way to use and eat pecans.  I did make a few alterations to suit my taste.  First, I used butter instead of margarine.  I used 1/2 white and 1/2 packed brown sugar, doubled the vanilla extract and added an extra cup of chopped pecans.  It is very important to beat the butter and vegetable oil with the sugars very, very thoroughly, until smooth and creamy, then add the other ingredients as the recipe states.  The dough was thin so I put it in the refrigerator for about an hour to firm it up, as suggested by another member.  Then used my cookie scoop to form even balls, rolled them in sugar and baked them for about 6-8 minutes on air bake cookie sheets.  These really are the perfect cookie in appearance and taste. My fiance and his co-workers agree  Thank you Mary Ann for this wonderful recipe.

Not a great flavor, I used real butter and they still came out kind of bland. They weren't dense at all like the kind you buy in the store. All in all I wouldn't make these again.

Generally I like this type of cookie, with a dough that includes confectioners' sugar, oil, butter and  cream of tartar.  I know the cookies for their characteristic lightness and sandy texture.  Not so  much this time. The mixed dough was very soft and laden with oil, already a big tip-off of what was to come.  I chilled the dough and while it did firm up, the resulting cookies were overly greasy, somewhat crumbly and not even substantive enough.  While one could play with the amounts of margarine (I used butter) and oil, the solution, I'm sure, would be to add a little more flour, simple as that.

first time made as written, 4 stars. Second time made per rewiews, subbing 1/2 cup brown sugar & 1/2 cup white, instead of 1 cup white and doubled the vanilla makes it a 5 star. Thanks for the awesome recipe and reviews people!

These were perfect.  I made 3 changes:  #1: I used only 100% whole wheat flour #2: I used butter in place of the margarine #3: I used unrefined (turbinado) sugar in place of the white.   I did, however, use the white confectioners' sugar as called for.  For my family & me, these were absolutely melt-in-your-mouth delicious!  Much better than store-bought -- and fresher as well!  5 stars all the way!

Excellant cookie ! I used 1 stick of margarine & 1 stick of butter , instead of 2 sticks margarine . I also used 2 teaspoons of vanilla and replaced half of the white sugar with 1/2 cup packed brown sugar. I baked these 1 dozen at a time , on parchment paper . They spread only slightly . In my oven 10 minutes is perfect for that tender crisp texture so important in a Sandie. These cookies are meant to have a mild flavor ...with these changes, this recipe bakes exactly the way I would expect a perfect Pecan Sandie to be . Thank you !

MAKE SURE THAT YOU DIP ONLY THE TOPS INTO SUGAR, OR THEY'LL BURN. I used 1/2c white sugar and 1/2c brown sugar. Chill dough before rolling into balls. Toast the pecans, the flavor comes out better. Push a pecan half into the center of the balls.  These cookies don't spread much. Always use butter instead of margarine when it comes to baking.

Just made these and love them. I changed the recipe slightly. I doubled the pecans and added another 1/2 teaspoon of baking soda. I scooped these with a 2 oz scoop and slightly flattened with a fork and sprinkled with colored sugar. Yum

These are absolutely the easiest to make and best tasting cookie.  I make these several times a year and always to rave reviews.  The only change I have ever made to this recipe is to toast the whole pecans before chopping them.  Toasting the pecans makes these irresistable!!!

I followed this recipe to the letter and only left out rolling the cookies in sugar (personal preference only!).  These have a  mildly sweet flavor that sits really well in our family.  I did press my cookies into a nice flat round shape since others had trouble with not spreading... and mine barely moved..  so the result was a perfect cookie for our family!  Thanks so much for sharing!

I made these cookies tonight and think the flavor is really good.  I followed another reviewer and used 1/2 white sugar; 1/2 brown sugar.  I rolled my first batch in sugar, as written.  For us, they were way too sweet so they rest were baked without the additional sugar.  Baked a couple batches on parchment and some without.  The cookies baked on parchment spread more resulting in a thinner cookie.  Had no problems with cookie sticking without the parchment.  I used a cookie scooper and did not bother to roll them - they maintained a beautiful shape.  Next time, I would reduce the amount of oil and either use butter or applesauce.

Loved these Cookies! We had to use margarine because my husband and son have dairy allergies, but they were still good.  I can only imagine how good they would be with real butter!

These are really great! I used butter instead of margarine and doubled the vanilla. I didn't have any cream of tarter, so I used two tablespoons of baking powder, and omitted the baking soda. I was a little worried they wouldn't be as good, but they were absolutely wonderful! I can't seem to keep my hands off of them.

I just finished making these cookies.  Based on other reviews I modified the recipe slightly and the cookies were great!!  I subsituted 1 cup margarine for 1 cup butter.  I substituted 1 cup vegetable oil for 1 cup crisco.  I also use 1/2 brown sugar and 1/2 cup white sugar.    The cookies are just like the Keebler Pecan Sandies and my kids absolutely went crazy for them!  I will definitely be making these cookies again and again!  Thank you for the awesome recipe.  By the way, refrigeration was not required.

Oh boy, these are GOOD! I made 1/2 recipe because I only had 1 cup of pecans. I used half brown sugar, half regular sugar, kept the powdered sugar the same. I used canola oil and used a little less (about 2/3 of the half cup called for in the half recipe.) I used unsalted butter, I never use margarine. I used my small cookie scoop, and didn't bother to roll them in sugar, but flattened them slighty with my fingers before baking. They spread out perfectly, and didn't stick to the cookie sheets. This recipe is a keeper, will make often!

Tasted better than store-bought. Not at all difficult, kids would like helping. I did have to grease my cookie sheet though. (Used spray oil.)

OMG! There is NO reason to buy these ever again! I followed another reviewer and used 1/2 brn sugar and 1/2 wht sugar instead of all wht sugar (am partial to brn sugar), and doubled vanilla.  I made these for a VERY picky hubby, whose favorite cookies are these, and he kept saying.."I only had 4.....".  Do try this recipe!! :) ENJOY!

I would give this recipe a 5 star except that I made some "changes" after reading all the reviews.  I used butter instead of margarine and used 1/2 granulated sugar and 1/2 brown sugar.  I also only baked them for 8 to 9 minutes.  But overall...these were totally "OUTSTANDING".  Not only were the verbal reviews excellent...but just watching everyone's facial expressions when they first bit into these was awesome!  I came right home tonight and added these to my favorite cookie list.  Thank you for sharing.  The recent Keebler commercials for pecan sandies inspired me to even look for and bake these cookies.  LOL

These  cookies are wonderful!  The only alterations that I made was that I used 1/2 cup packed light brown sugar AND 1/2 cup white sugar instead of all white sugar along with butter not margarine.  The  pecan sandies came out awesome - very tasty.  Thank you for the recipe!

This is a great recipe. I took the advice of others and used 1/2 cup of white sugar and 1/2 cup of brown sugar instead of 1 cup of all white sugar. I also doubled the vanilla extract and did 1.5 tsp of salt. These were a huge hit!

I have made this recipe 4 times. The first time I made it just as written and they stuck to the pan and crumbled when trying to remove. Cookie tasted good. I made it the second time leaving out the oil and it turned out very dry. I sprayed the pan with Pam baking spray. I wanted the right consistency so I made it third time making alterations. The last time I made them this is what I did; spray the cookie sheets with Pam baking spray, substituted oil for 2 tbls of milk, 2 tbls of vanilla extract, 1 tbls butter flavoring, 3 1/2 cups of flour, 1 1/2 tsp salt, omitted the tartar, 3 cups chopped pecans and no sugar for decoration. You'll get a cookie instead of cake like cookie.

These cookies are great, though not traditional pecan sandies. The baking time is definitely more like 9 mnutes. They tend to burn on bottom quickly if you don't keep an eye on them. I used parchment paper, and they didn't stick. I think next time I'll try baking them on the top rack of the oven to help with the burning. Also instead of rolling the cookie dough ball in sugar, I would dip them and not cover the bottom with sugar because sugar tends to burn. These cookies DO expand, so make sure not to make them too big and place them 2 inches apart. They bake so quickly, you can make multiple batches in no time! I didn't have enough oil, so I substituted 1/2 of the oil with apple sauce. It turned out great :)

These are delicious doing the recipe exactly!  These cookies are not meant to be brown so don't over cook them (like I did) waiting for them to brown a little...  Even with my slight mistake they were still yummy!!!

These are very good cookies...buttery, crispy, melt-in-your-mouth, with an awesome pecan flavor and crunch. Like many other reviewers, I topped mine with a pecan half, to add a little interest.  The only problem I had with these cookies is that they have a slight baking soda taste..I might be the only one who noticed this, as no one complained about it to me.  I also used butter instead of margarine, because I never have it in the house. The cookies turned out great...except for that baking soda taste. Thanks for sharing the recipe...I'll probably make these again!

I LOVE pecan sandies, and these are fabulous!  For folks who have trouble with the soft dough, I used a small cookie scoop (Pampered Chef, but you could probably find it at a kitchen store) and scooped the dough onto wax-paper lined cookie sheets.  I stuck them in the freezer for a few minutes before rolling in sugar.  Hope this helps!

These were the best!  I worried because I forgot the vanilla, but it was for nothing. I did follow the others advice and substituted 1/2 the sugar for brown sugar.  Refrigerating the dough for about 30-45 mins is a must. It made it so much easier to work with. Also, parchment paper is very important as Im sure the cookies would have stuck without it.

Wow, these are absolutely fantastic! I've never been a fan of pecan sandies, but I was making these for my mom. I had to try one to make sure they were edible and WOW! So good! I loved the texture, flaky without being overly dry. They are really rich and delicious. I made these with vegan egg replacer and they turned out perfectly. I rolled half in sugar, the other half I topped with a pecan half (very pretty). Thank you, thank you!

This is the first time I have made pecan sandies, and I am an avid baker.  These were absolutely wonderful!!  Sooo many compliments.  I have already handed out the recipe.  Note, I used a cookie scoop, as I do for almost all my cookies - bake more even and are uniform.  They looked perfect!  Make tons!!!!

Outstanding recipe! I used butter instead of margarine and cooled the cookies on their sheets for 5 mins. before transferring to a plate. Sensational! I'll be baking these for years to come!

The first time I made these, I was sure I had made a mistake when measuring the flour because the batter was so thin and impossible to roll into balls.  I added more flour and also added some almond flavoring.  Everyone said these were their favorite cookie and asked for the recipe.  The second time I made these I realized I had added the correct amount of flour according to the recipe; however, I added more flour as before and once again they turned out great.

Amazing recipe that was a hit at a bake sale. I followed one reviewers advice and did 2 tsp of vanilla and 1.5 tsp of salt. I also split the recipe in two and did half with regular flour and half with Bob's Red Mill Gluten Free flour. The gluten free ones were equally delicious and equally loved!! Saving and remaking this one for sure.

Loved it. I made 1/2 batch and got 54 cookies. Mine didn't look as bumpy as the ones pictured above. Mine look like the ones from the store. They melt in your mouth and are light, not dense like the store bought ones. THey slid right off my airbake sheets. I doubled the vanilla like suggested and don't use cream of tartar. A lot of people run into problems when they don't refrigerator a recipe with butter or margarine, and when they substitute vegetable oil spreads like Parkay or Blue bonnet for margarine or butter. You can't. Margarine is around 80% fat and spreads are only 30-40% fat. THey are mostly water. I watched a tv cooking show on it. Good Eats.

Someone brought me some store bought Pecan Sandies but they tasted weird to me. I decided to look up a recipe and found this one. These were so good nobody even wants to think of the prepackaged kind anymore.

i also altered this recipe with rave results.  Instead of 1 cup of white sugar I did 1/2 cup white and 1/2 cup packed brown sugar and I doubled the vanilla.  This are awesome cookies.  They do taste just like the keebler cookies.  does that make me a little elf?

So light, they just melt.  I did not roll them out, but spooned them onto a cookie sheet lined with paper.  Some I sprinkled with sugar, but not necessary.  I will definitely make these again.

What a great cookie.  I was looking for a pecan sandie type & this is it.  I did change the sugar as some reviewers suggested to 1/2 cup each of white & brown sugar & used butter. I also pressed pecan pieces into the top of each cookie.  Will make this again & again.

A wonderful cookie--light, crispy, melt-in-your-mouth buttery, nutty goodness. I followed the recipe exactly, though omitted the rolling in sugar part; instead, I pressed a pecan half onto the top of each cookie before baking. Cook until edges are just starting to brown; they will harden nicely as they cool. A perfect cookie for the Christmas season.

I used 1 cup butter, 1/2 Crisco butter flavor, 1/2 oil - the dough was flaky and not gooey at all - no need to refrigerate that way.  Had to press with fork when they came out of oven - if undercooked just slightly, very moist.  Double the vanilla, and next time I'm going to  try 1/2 brown sugar.  First try - liked them.

I used butter instead of margarine and 1/2 brown and 1/2 white sugar.  These were good warm but a few hours after I baked them, they were so dry they just crubled.  I don't think I overbaked them as I didn't even let them get brown or golden.  Oh well, they were good when dunking them in milk.

Too Good to Believe, I made these for Christmas last year and was a little hesitant-with 1 cup of butter and then 1 cup of oil, but it got so many good reviews I thought I would take a shot.  I can't believe that it tastes soo good.  These are a keeper-I only changed the sugar like a few people mentioned-half white and half brown.  Have already passed them down to my children.  Of course with all the praise going to m-ann.  Thank your for this great cookie recipe.

fantastic!   i did something extra, which was to make them into thumbprint cookies - indenting my thumb once the dough was shaped into balls on the cookie sheet and piping in raspberry jam.  it was the perfect compliment and my company raved about how perfectly deliciously these were.

Hands down, these have got to be the best cookie I have ever tasted!  I used butter instead of margarine, and let the batter sit for 5 minutes before I shaped them.  These are BETTER than Keebler!

I followed the recipe with the suggestion from another member of adding 1/2 tsp. almond extract, and it's great! After reading what others said about it being too soft, and hard to remove from the pan, I wondered if I was making a mistake in even trying this, but I forged ahead. I wiped the cookie sheets with a small amount of cooking oil, used a cookie scoop with a squeeze handle, and a meat fork to toss in the sugar and lift out, leaving the excess sugar behind.  They turned out perfect. I would recommend watching them closely in the oven, so as to remove them just before browning.  These will be a great part of my Christmas cookie trays which I'm looking forward to sharing with friends and neighbors!

Excellent cookie recipe! I used real butter instead of margarine for better flavor. I also affixed a pecan half on each cooled cookie with a powdered sugar and water icing made in a sandwich ziploc. Clip a tiny corner off the bag to deliver small dots of icing to "glue" the pecan to the cookie.

If I'd known these were so easy to make (and the recipe makes so many!) I would've stopped buying Keebler years ago!

I made these today for the first time and OH MY GOODNESS they are great!!!! I own a country market/bakery - my customers love sampling any new recipes I try -- they all loved these -- warm right out of the oven. Thanks for a new cookie now added to my cookie basket. I did use butter instead of margarine.

Awesome! Also I recommend trying this: once I didn't have pecans, so I left them out and put Sugar Cookie Icing (on this website) on top. AMAZING! I also advise against making the pecan sandies balls too big -- they expand a LOT.

These are delicious! They totally melt in your mouth! I didn't have any margarine, so I used butter instead. These will definitely make an encore in our house!

Amen Sister, these are really good!!!  I followed the recipe exactly.  Before baking I used the sugared bottom of a glass to gently smash the cookie just a little bit flat.  Some cookies are good warm out of the oven but these are best cooled.

What a yummy cookie!  I also added extra vanilla, and i only put in 1 1/2 cups of chopped pecans only because i wasn't going to buy two packages.  It turned out great!!  My husband loved them and he doesn't even really like pecans!

My dough was too sticky to roll into balls so I added about 1/3 cup of flour.  I had no other problems but will try adding alittle more sugar next time, too.  I let my cookies cool then put some of them into a bag with powder sugar to dust them and they turned out to taste like a cross between danish wedding cookies and pecan sandies...very yummy.  I also only dipped top side in sugar and pressed them down some before cooking to flatten as I love to dip my cookies in milk, hot tea, and/or coffee.  The next time I make these I'm going to add a cup of mini-chocolate chips.

So very good.  Recipe says margarine, but I used real butter (always).  And I have good cookie sheets, I don't have any trouble getting them off the pan and I don't use any of that other stuff.

I listened to another reviewer and didn't roll the cookies in sugar before baking. I wish I had! They weren't quite as sweet as I would've hoped. But, despite that it didn't affect my review. They are just ok. Pretty bland with a heavy texture. I probably won't make these again.

These cookie are absolutely delicious, have a delicate texture and are a snap to make. I used walnuts instead of pecans (didn't have on hand) and butter instead of margarine, but they still turned wonderful. I will bake them often, varying nuts. Thanks for sharing.

I made these cookies on Dec. 14, 2005 and I just have to say that they taste like the pecan sandies you buy in the store.  Excellent!  My husband has always loved pecan sandies, so I looked for the recipe on allrecipes and decided to try making them myself. This recipe is a keeper.  My husband is allergic to soy and margarines have soy products so I used real butter.  I have even substitued the pecans with walnuts and the taste is still excellent.  Thank you for the recipe!

A+++++!  Remind me of Danish butter cookies.  Very delicate cookies and they do melt in your mouth!  I used butter instead of margarine, walnuts instead of pecans.  My dough was kinda soft so I made drop cookies and sprinkled them with sugar.  They looked pretty and were terrific!  Good holiday or "company" cookie.

Absolutely the best Sandies I have ever had, hands-down!  I only added 1/2 cup sugar and 1/2 cup of confectioners sugar and they were sweet enough for me. Instead of MARGARINE, I used SPECTRUM (non-hydrogenated) ORGANIC ALL VEGETABLE SHORTENING.   Also, I did not make balls out of them or roll in sugar at the end.  Those are the only changes I made.  Thank you for this recipe as it is a new family favorite at my house!  I would like to add that my friend made the recipe with BUTTER and I tasted her cookies; they were definitely NOT nearly as good as using SPECTRUM SHORTENING.

One thing that I do with any recipe using pecans is to always toast them lightly before chopping.  Have found this removes any oily taste and improves the flavor.

LOVE IT!  To be honest, I've never seen a cookie recipe with vegetable oil as an ingredient, so I was very very very skeptical even before trying out this recipe.  But as I read other reviewers raving about how good it is, I just didn't want to be the one who missed out on a good, perhaps a great, cookie recipe.  Well as it turns out, this is not just a good recipe, IT'S GREAT, AWESOME, FANTASTIC, FABULOUS!!  No, really, it's that goooood!!  
BUT I did tweak some ingredients as other reviewers suggested. (1)  I also used 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup white sugar (instead of all white).  (2) I read that lots of people doubled the vanilla extract, but I TRIPLED it and it was great!  Come on, the recipe calls for 4 cups of flour, it can take 3 teaspoons (which equals 1 tablespoon) of vanilla extract.  (3) I also used real butter (instead of margarine).  (4) I picked up on one reviewer who said that she added 1 more cup of chopped pecans, which turned out to be good idea (if you like more flavor and texture in your cookie, definetely do add more).  (5) Chilling the dough in the refrigerator for 1 or more hours before baking.  
But I wonder about one person who subbed vegetable oil for equal amount of apple sauce.  I think I'll cut the recipe in half to try that nex time!  
This will definetely stay in one of my Christmas cookie recipes!  Thanks!!

I was really looking forward to making these cookies. I LOVE pecan sandies and wanted to make my own. I read a lot of other reviews and decided to try cutting the oil in half by substituting apple sauce as some others suggested. The taste is ok, but the texture is definitely not a pecan sandie. Apple sauce makes these cookies very cake like. Not crunchy and dense like you want to find in a shortbread cookie. I'm trying a new recipe next and not using apple sauce.

These pecan sandies are the best ever.  They are light and fluffy with just the right amount of pecans.  The texture is incredible.  We have a bakery and sell them at Farmers Markets.  They are a hit!

This was an AWESOME cookie recipe! I halved the recipe because it makes so many cookies. I didn't have cream of tartar, so I omitted BOTH the cream of tartar and baking soda and substituted them for baking powder as the leavening agent. (1 teaspoon). I did as others suggested and did butter in place of margarine and did 1/2 cup white and 1/2 cup brown sugar. I also added 1/4 cup of mini chocolate chips when the pecans were added. 
Light. Airy. Delicate. Not an extremely sweet cookie. Slid right off my Pampered Chef bar pan with no parchment paper or baking spray needed. Dough was super easy to handle and shape into balls. One of the BEST cookies I've ever made!!

I followed some of the reviewer suggestions: butter, 1/2 white and 1/2 brown sugar, double the vanilla. I also toasted the pecans and finely chopped them in the food processor. The dough was very soft, so I refrigerated it for an hour, then used a small scoop to form the balls. Baked them using silicone baking mats in my pans, and these cookies came out perfectly!! Wonderful sandy texture, perfect level of sweetness, and excellent for a quick dunk in some coffee. Thanks for posting a great recipe!!

The taste was just okay, not much flavor and  my sandies cam out more like cake. I followed the directions. they were crunchy on the bottom, and cake like on the top. I felt like these was more like wedding cookies than sandies. I didn't tweak the recipe.

My huband girls love these at the store I found this recipe and the only thing I did different is roll the cookie dough in raw sugar (Sugar IN the Raw). They were thrilled with ccokie both ways (regular sugar and raw sugar). They said this recipe was a keeper! It does make many cookies!

I made during Christmas and took them to work. Now I get request for them all of the time. I'm making a batch today as a requested birthday gift for a friend, they're that good! I do substitute the margarine for unsalted butter but that's my only change.

These are very good! Makes a ton of cookies. The only thing I changed was 1/2 c white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar as others had suggested. I would advise refrigerating dough in between batches the cookies seem to firm up better. I used a melon baller to scoop the batter, a lot less mess that way

This recipe was so yummy, I could have eaten all the dough and not made cookies...I used butter which didn't seem to change the look or texture of them at all. I did put in 1.5 teaspoon instead of just 1 but otherwise, stuck to the recipe and had no trouble with them at all...

My only change: I replaced 1/2 cup of white sugar with 1/2 cup of brown sugar. One thing I would have done different to add a little more flavor is to roll the cookies in white sugar and a tablespoon of cinnamon. This may not be as Sandie-like but it would probably bring out the flavor of the pecans a bit. Otherwise a very good tea cookie.

This is an excellent cookie. Everyone who tried it loved it. (young and old) I wouldn't say the recipe makes nearly 96 cookies unless they are super tiny. I didn't even get half of that. They really do melt in your mouth. I plan on making a double batch very soon!

I made these cookies tonight.  They are yummy - light, delicate and crispy.  I made mine with all butter and added an extra teaspoon of vanilla.  The dough is very soft, so I chilled it at least 30 mins.  I think they will make it into the Christmas boxes this year.

MELT IN YOUR MOUTH GOOD! Made these today and my hubby can't stop eating them, yes they taste just like the keebler kind! It made soo many cookies, although i would not recommend cutting the recipe in half because they will go quick! [also added 2 tsp of vanilla for extra flavor] maybe these will be left for santa this year ;)

I must have done something wrong but I can't figure out what! It tasted like it needed much more sugar and the dough was very wet making it nearly impossible to roll in the sugar.

This recipe is amazing. They have the right kinda texture. I made only a half batch because of everyone else's reviews and I have to say it is worth a full batch.  I made only a couple of changes. I used unsalted butter instead of margarine, doubled the amount of vanilla and added about 3/4 tsp of cinnamon. I cooked mine for 12 minutes, turning the cookie sheet halfway through the baking so they got an evenly browned on the edges. This recipe is definitely a keeper.

Pecan Sandies are my husband's favorite cookie.  He rates these as 6 stars.  They melt in your mouth and are not too sweet.  I followed the recipe except I used butter instead of margarine.  When I'm in the mood to make cookies, these will be the first ones made.

after reading a few reviews this is what I did.  I too used butter, changed sugers to half brown, half white. Also I had some ground pecans and used those, I had approx half a cup left and went ahead and added them to the recipe. I used 2 tsp of real vanilla.  My batter was soft, I dropped it by large tsp fulls and used a tart press to "pat" down the cookies. they came off the sheet easily. I have only tried them warm, but they cured my craving for pecan sandies.  I will make these again.  recipe made 75 cookies.

These turned out pretty good! They're very sensitive to being left in any longer or shorter than stated...so watch them carefully. I didn't have enough Pecans to crush into the batter, but they still turned out well.

Awesome cookie!  My daughter had me make another batch before she returned to college.  I gave it 4 stars because the first batch seemed a little salty.  I cut back the salt to 1/2 tsp and they came out great!

These were good but I wish I had used powdered sugar to roll them in vs the white sugar suggested here. Thank you for sharing!

I loved these cookies and get requests to make them every holiday season! They are better than the ones at the store. The owner of my job makes some and they are no where close to as good as these. Problem is, it is hard to get them to try anything they didn't think of or make. They really do not know what they are missing out on.

I loved these.  When I was making these I was a little sceptical because they were so greasy. I forgot to roll them in sugar before baking and rolled them after.  I couldn't believe how moist and delicious they are! I did cook them on parchment paper instead of a plan baking sheet. Otherwise no changes..it didn't need any!

pretty good.....i should have known they wouldnt be like a shortbread when i saw the eggs and oil and cream of tartar....duh but the picture made me think they would be more dense.  As it turns out they are quite light....with a nice nutty flavour and the sugar coating is a nice and necessary addition, without it i think they might be a bit bland.  I followed advice from other reviewers and added more sugar/salt and vanilla.  My husband loves them......he's eaten at least 20 of them in the past day.  Great for a cookie exchange.....it makes a LOT of them.  I used my tablespoon measuring scoop to ball em out so they'd be about the same size. yummy.  ill make em again

Hard to add anything but another "Excellent!"  I did use butter and 1/2 white and 1/2 brown sugar, and refrigerated dough overnight.  Interesting to see the variety of photos of these cookies ... I suspect it has to do with the temp of the dough when you bake it.  After refrigerating overnight, I let the dough sit for an hour or so to come to room temp before baking ... they spread to a nicely shaped round cookie, although not flat.  The thicker "ball" some people seemed to get was probably from baking very cold dough ... just something to keep in mind when you decide which shape you're looking for!

I thought they were the best.  I am really not a sweet eater but after I heard how great they were a bunch of times I had to try them.  Oh my goodness!  I did use butter instead of margarine and half brown and white sugar.  Also used 2 tsps. vanilla.  Try it you will like it.

I just finished making these and they came out GREAT!  They were super easy to make too.  I did follow the suggestion of someone to double the vanilla and use 1 1/2 tsp salt.  I usually up the vanilla in every recipe anyway.  Thanks for a terrific recipe!

This is a very good cookie especially with a cup of tea.  It has a great flavor and you can either roll it in the sugar or not...either way the cookie is great.

I used butter instead of margarine and didn't roll the cookies in sugar as the recipe recommended. I placed a pecan half in the middle of each cookie before baking. I thought these were great, although they cooked quickly, I turned the oven down to 350 degrees and baking for 10 minutes was perfect.

I follwed the recipe (almost) exactly and they turned out perfectly.  Rather than rolling these in sugar I just sprinked them with sugar after they were on the baking sheet.  It gave them a nice shiny finish but I will probably forego it the next time since the extra sugar probably adds little to the taste.

Someone wrote that they don't spread much so I didn't space them out as much as I normally do (because I was short on time for our Cookie Exchange - lol).  Well, they DO spread a little.  On the top, they looked lovely, but on the bottom, they fell apart.  Lucky for me, I know how to "fake it" with pretty packaging!  :)  Reminder to self:  make the balls a little bigger, and space them apart.  With that in mind, they would look as nice as they tasted (and they DID taste good!).

Wow.  These were amazing.  We are making cookies tonight, and we made these first.  Wow.  These are so light and tasty that we feel like we could have 20 each!  We made the first half without the pecans (we are gifting anonymously to students in dorms, so some may not like nuts) and the second half with - both amazing!!!!

Yields tender, melt in your mouth cookies -- these put store bought to shame.   I toasted the pecans and used 1/2 white and brown sugars, also used one stick of margarine and one stick of butter because that's what I had. Preheat oven while dough is chilling.  Don't overcook, and watch carefully if using a dark cookie sheet.  I had to pull the ones on the dark sheets a minute or so earlier.  I made these as a gift for my Grandfather's 94th birthday.  A big hit!

These cookies are delicious!  I've never cared for the store-bought variety, but my husband likes them, so I thought I'd give this recipe a try.  Neither one of us could stay out of them!  I did substitute butter for the margarine.  Although I chilled the dough as some reviewers suggested, the dough didn't stiffen as one would expect.  No matter, the balls didn't spread as much as I feared they might.  These were to be frozen and placed on my Christmas trays, but I'm not sure they'll last that long!

Wonderful. Like other reviewers, I subbed brown sugar for half the white sugar called for, which imparts a nice bit of color to the cookies. I recommend following the timing instructions rather than waiting for edges to actually get brown - these cookies do not get browned at the edges until they've cooked too long, which will make them too crunchy. Definitely recommend refrigerating the dough to make it easier to handle, and sprinkling tops with sugar rather than rolling in sugar to save time. GREAT recipe that I will surely make again.

Very nice recipe for pecan sandies. I halved the recipe and still managed 70 of them and all regular sized. I did cut down on the sugar a bit but that's because instead of the 1/2 cup oil, I used 1/4 cup oil and 1/4 cup sweetened maple syrup. Also as I ran out of pecans i didn't have any to put on top of the cookies but they look splendid without them anyway! Next time I will try this by substituting the white sugar for half white and half brown sugar. Thank you M-Ann :)

Awesome cookies!  I creamed the first 4 ingredients until the mixture was fluffly and almost looked like cake batter.  Also used 1/2 white sugar and 1/2 brown.  Turned out EXCELLENT!!  If you let them sit on the cookie sheet for about 5 minutes cooling - you should have no trouble moving them from pan to cooling rack.  Will definitely make again - thanks for a wonderful recipe!!

I made these this evening, and they came out perfect. I have never made sandies before, I usually make chewy cookies. I took one reviewer's advice and doubled the salt and vanilla, and another one's and used wax paper. I flattened the balls slightly with my fingers, it helps them to have the right shape, instead of muffin top type cookies. My family loved them!! I will have to give some away this week, this recipe makes a huge amount of cookies!!

I made these beauties while getting ready for work.  They were so incredibly simple and tasty that I'll make them again for SURE!!!  I didn't roll them in powdered sugar but when they were finished I dusted them with it and it worked just as well.  Everyone raved about them and I am very pleased myself.  KUDO'S TO THE AUTHOR!!

I think this is a great recipe.  Even my husband who says he doesn't like nuts in cookies loved them!  My grandmother used to make pecan sandies, but I can't find her recipe.  These are just like she used to make!  I don't think they are too sweet.  The recipe was awfully big, so I halved it to try the recipe, but it is so good, I'll probably make the big recipe next time.

Wonderful light cookies! Everyone enjoyed them on Father's Day. I remember this being one of my Dad's favorites and surprised him with them. Big success! I did not find the dough hard to work with after 30 mins in the frig. Used parchment paper for an easy clean up. I will be making these again. Thank you for this great recipe!

What a fantastic recipe!  These cookies totally melt in your mouth.  I did make some changes that other members recommended: I did 1 1/2 tsp. of salt, doubled the vanilla, used all butter (no margarine) and after the cookies were out of the oven, I dusted them with powdered sugar.  Great old-fashioned cookie and one to keep in my recipe box!

Nothing like I expected from the reviews. I refrigerated overnight because of the dough being so soft. The only thing I changed was using butter instead of oleo - followed everything else to a T - will not be making again.

This is the second year I have made these for Christmas gifting.   They are the best cookies ever!  They make about one million cookies, so be prepared to share or eat a bunch yourself.  This year I passed them out with homemade hot chocolate that I had flavored with powdered amaretto flavored creamer.  I put about 1 1/2 T. of the creamer into the cookies as well and it turned out mighty tasty.  Now if you'll excuse me, I have to go eat some more cookies...

Very good!!  I used 1 1/2 tsp of vanilla extract like other reviewers suggested.  Watch the cookies closely - they burn easily!  I would suggest either lowering the cook time, the cookies need 10 mins max.  They are not as "melt in your mouth" or crisp (but not burnt) as I wanted them to be, not sure what needs to change.

These do not taste like Keebler cookies at all. They taste like regular sugar cookies with pecans in them. I followed the directions exactly. I will not be makine these again.

Easy and delicious.  I used butter instead of margarine and halved the recipe, and they came out great.  I also baked them for only 9 minutes because I like a softer cookie. Thanks for the recipe!

This is a good recipe, cookies come out nice and soft. I only cooked them for 11  minutes @ 375. The down side is that I feel that it needs more flavor. So I added a maple glaze to the top after they were cooked and cooled. Still pretty yummy though especially with a tall glass  of milk for dipping in. Yummy!!

I was out of butter and vegetable oil, so I replaced the butter with butter-flavored shortening and I replaced the vegetable oil with peanut oil. It worked out rather well. These cookies are WONDERFUL. I'll definitely be making them again... hopefully with the right ingredients at hand. :)

These are great! The only changes I made were that I halved the white sugar to 1/2 cup and added 1/2 cup of brown sugar. I also used 2 tsp of vanilla. Lastly, I used 1 stick of lite margarine and 1 stick of lite butter with no problems. These are much softer than the sandies you buy at the store, but they have the same taste. I prefer them soft, anyway.:-)  Enjoy!

I used butter instead of margarine.  I thought the oil in this recipe was a bit odd, but they are wonderful!  They are best warm from the oven when they are still soft, but are also great cool, hard and crunchy.  I will save this recipe and definitely use it again!

These are fantastic! The only thing I changed was using 1 stick of butter and 1/2 cup of shortning instead of the margarine. I baked them for 12 minutes in a gas oven and they were fluffy and crispy! I let them get nice and gold around the edges because I like these kind of cookies crispy. The kids loved them! And my one son hates nuts, but he loves these. I will make them again and again!

These cookies were okay, but I was disappointed because they seemed like just sugar cookies with pecans in them.  I had to refrigerate the dough for a while since it was really sticky, and the cookies spread in the oven, looking nothing like the picture posted. I doubt I would bother making these again.

These are fantastic cookies, reminds me of the pecan sandies I loved as a kid.  They were too sweet when you rolled them in sugar so I skipped that next time and they were even better!  Thanks for a great recipe!

Absolutely incredible cookie Mary Ann! I've never made anything like these before and was so excited to try this recipe. I'm happy to say that these are one of the very few "new" cookies I made this year that will go into my permanent Christmas cookie recipe box. Thank you so much!

I always make these @ Christmas  along with a few other baked goods that we hand out to our friends. These cookies are especially coveted! The only difference I see is that I lightly dust them  with confectioners sugar.

These are yummy! I substituted the sugars with artificial sugars because my husband is diabetic. Next batch will be made with a substitute flour.

Made two subs. Walnuts (cheaper) and omitted sugar coating. We ain't  "cookie monsters" anymore and rarely eat.  This recipe is nice because not overly sweet.  But that's preference and why left out the sugar coating.  The texture wasn't  quite the same as store bought. But this recipe doesn't claim to be a copycat so please consider before leaving poor review.  Ours turned out  slightly  cakey and soft. But no prob  taste great all the same.   I read other recipes not using soda or tartar.  Next time will try without to try and get a denser texture.  Overall great recipe for adult taste. Nice with coffee or iced tea.  Kids might not like so much. But plenty other sweety recipes for them.  UPDATE On second try omitted the tarter used same amount of soda only. Used 50/50 butter and margarine no vegetable oil.  And didn't bother with the chilled dough part. just dropped and slightly smashed with backside of wet wooden spoon.  pretty good

Great! I sub 1/2 c. Brown rice flour for 1/2 c. White flour just to get rid of it. Added 1/4 tsp. Almond extract along with vanilla. Only bad thing is I could eat ALL of them! Also took advice of another reviewer not to add salt! That was dumb! Next time I'm adding salt as recipe states. I pressed down with fingers to flatten b4 baking AGREE parchment, parchment! Easy clean up no sticking

Awesome cookies... I omitted 1-C sugar and substituted 1/2 C dark brown sugar and 1/2 C regular sugar in the recipe. Nor did I roll the dough in white sugar, they are plenty sweet and very tasty.

These cookies were amazing!! But instead of using vanilla I used 1-1/2 tsp of almond extract and coconut oil instead of vegetable oil. Will definitely make them again.

Everyone agreed this is pretty close to the Pecan Sandies!  
I did substitute coconut oil for the vegetable oil and vegan sticks for the margarine.  Also, followed reviewer and toasted the pecans.  Daughter loved them but suggested adding white chocolate next time....Can't wait to do that!
Thank you for a great recipe! This is going in rotation with chocolate chip cookies from now on

Made exactly as directed except baked a few minutes longer.  The cookies were a hit at home and at the cookie exchange.  Would recommend this recipe for pecan sandies.

These cookies are good but not very sweet at all. Remind me more of a scone. Made a white chocolate drizzle and that helped a lot. Next time, I’ll add butter extract for a little more flavor.

These were fine, I didn't think they were very flavorful.  I followed many of the other recommendations (using brown sugar, half wheat flour, tho I didn't double the vanilla and I should have). I would not make them again.

I made these using unsalted butter instead of margarine and replaced the AP flour with fine, almond flour. My daughter is gluten intolerant.  The dough was soft so I added 3/4 cup extra almond flour and chilled the dough before scooping it out on the baking sheet. I initially baked it for 10 minutes and added one minute so that the edges started turning a light brown.
Everyone loves them!!

I love these!!! The only change I made was to use half butter, half margarine. They were super easy to scoop and came out looking perfectly! I didn’t roll in sugar, I didn’t see the need. I use silicone baking mats and they lifted right off. These were super easy to make and super good! Next time I’m going to try adding a little almond extract.

Delicious crunchy cookies! As suggested I used 1/2 white and 1/2 brown sugar and butter instead of margarine. Baked small golf ball sized cookies on parchment paper for 20 minutes in 375 oven.

Half the recipe made 44 cookies. The dough isn't solid enough to roll into a ball; I just dropped by tablespoon. They're sweet enough; they don't need to be rolled in sugar. The photo shows each cookie topped with a pecan; I didn't do that. I'd make these again.

I made some for a client, but substituted with walnuts (as she didn't have pecans on hand).  I read some reviews and like suggested by another baker, I also used 1/2 cup each of granulated and brown sugars and a dash of cinnamon. 
I'm allergic to nuts, so I was unable to personally taste them. My client said they were amazing!

Amazing. Only change: sifted some confectioners sugar on top of cookies while cooling. Some photos show a whole pecan on top, but these were delicious without that. Family agreed: we'll never eat commercial pecan sandies again!

I haven’t had pecan sandies in over 10 years before recently trying this recipe andthey were better than I remembered!!! I used subbed coconut oil for the vegetable oil and used a little less sugar and they came out perfect!

I made these but followed a suggestion by another reviewer.  I used 1/2 cup granulated sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar and 2 teaspoons vanilla.  They taste amazing!!  I will definitely make these again!!!

I made this batch for my son who doesn't like pecans!!  But even these were melt in your mouth. I didn't use the oil--I doubled the butter & used salted butter. EXCELLENT RECIPE!! Will continue to use. Thanks. KR.

These are pretty good cookies. I followed the advise is several reviewers and did 1/2 cup each of white & brown sugar. I think next time I'll go with all white sugar for a slightly sweeter cookie.  Also did the maple glaze for 1/2 the batch which really was a waste of good maple syrup. The vanilla in the glaze overpowered the maple. The other 1/2 I rolled in Sugar in the Raw which was awesome- I did have to refrigerate the dough to make handling easier.

I have made this recipe at least 10 times.  The only change I make is to use butter instead of margarine.  They are  great cookies.  Just wanted to pass on one piece of information.  The last time I made these the butter was not as soft as it should be.   I ran the mixer on a higher speed and for longer than usual and undoubtedly whipped air into the creamed mixture.  As a result the cookies spread out more while being baked.  The taste and texture is incredible but the cookies were flatter.  Didn't slow down anybody at our house.

I made this last year for a family reunion and everyone loved them! In fact, I came back to find them to take to my reunion again this year! They taste more like a melt-in-your-mouth shortbread, not a strong flavor like a chocolate chip cookie. They are perfect with a strong cup of coffee!

Was very skeptical about making these since I don't like making anything new but I have to say these came out exceptional. I got so many compliments on them and they do taste just like the Keebler ones. I did what another reviewer did and added some cinnamon and I think it added to it. My husband now asks me every week "when are you making those pecan cookies again?"

If I could give 10 stars, I would. I was never a fan of Pecan Sandies from the store but made these, mainly for my mom since she loves pecan sandies. I tried one out of the over and OMG. This is now my favorite cookie of all times. Some cookies are just way too sweet. This one is perfect. . Will definitely be making these every year. Thanks for sharing! I did double the vanilla as well as used butter instead of margarine. I NEVER use margarine in cookies.

Very similar to my sugar cookie recipe.  I didn't want the two cookies to taste like the same cookie with a few changes, so I subbed 1/2 cup brown sugar for 1/2 cup of the granulated sugar, as recommended by others.  That plus the addition of the pecans really set these apart.  Very tasty and they will become a "regular" on my holiday cookie tray.   Thank you!

Melt in your mouth delicious. Easy to make and remove easy when baked on parchment paper. I will make these over and over. I rolled a big portion into balls and put in my freezer to pull out and bake when I need a fast good go to desert.

So, at 11pm I decide to make a batch of these babies only to discover that I was completely out of all-purpose flour.  I did, however, have plenty of bread flour. I hemmed and hawed for about 5 minutes over whether to go for it (you just never know with bread flour for cookies, i've had a disaster or two) and I'm so glad I did!  It was a tense 11 minutes while they were in the oven, but they browned beautifully around the edges, had a crispy outside, and soft inside. Melt in your mouth!  Pleasantly surprised, to say the least.  

i didn't have the stickiness that others mentioned. I was able to roll and sugar them without chilling (no idea if this was due to bread flour) but wanted to mention that.

 I also followed tips from others and altered the following:
- beat the living daylights out of the sugars, oil, butter (I mean, no lumps, cake batter consistency). Then beat the eggs and vanilla just as thoroughly
-2 tsp vanilla, butter not margarine, canola oil not veg. Everything else I left the same. 
- HAND STIR the dry mixture into the wet! I think some may be mixing it together with the beaters.  It was super easy to mix with the wet because the wet was beaten to a pulp!
-PARCHMENT PAPER is a must for these little nuggets

I put a piece of pecan in the top of each cookie (mostly so the fam would know what kind they were) but it looked cute too

Whipped out about 5 dozen from one batch. My 1.5" balls spread into 2" cookies.

I have made this cookie many times!  It's a go-to holiday cookie at my house.  I use shortening instead of oil and use butter (unsalted) instead of margarine (butter flavored Crisco is amazing for this cookie).  I made a variation with cream cheese once, added lemon zest, and have substituted pecans with walnuts at other times.  It's such a good "short" cookie!  Always great with coffee.

Oh my!  I will never buy another Pecan Sandie cookie again. These are excellent, made just as written.  It made about 100 cookies.  Now I will have to freeze some quickly before they are all gone and I  have gained another 10 lbs.  And if I did... it would have been worth it!  Yum!

My husband likes to buy these so i decided to look for a recipe and am I glad that I found this one!!!  Like others said, they melt in your mouth.  I made the recipe exactly  like its written and they turned out perfectly.  I did take the advise of others to use parchment paper, however.  No more store bought Pecan Sandies for us!

Great recipe. My second time. I toasted the pecans and added a whole pecan on top as garnish. I made them in 2 oz balls. It may take a moment more to bake. And, in the next few days, I heat them for 3 minutes in a toaster oven at 300 degrees and it's almost better than when first baked.

I made these for the first time today...after reading other reviews, I toasted the pecans before chopping, used half granulated and half brown sugar, 2 tsp vanilla and  half margarine and half butter.....I used a #60 scoop and it made 10 dz, very delicious cookies...whoever said the cookies were greasy/oily must not have creamed the wet ingredients enough...I get those ingredients beating while measuring out the dry ingredients and by the time I am finished, the wet ingredients are silky smooth...

Great recipe I've made for years, but using real butter. Real butter and real vanilla are the keys to the flavor. And for those of us who grew up in the low-fat craze of the 80's and 90's, unless you're lactose intolerant, butter is now considered way healthier than most oil based margerines. Go real food!

This is a phenomenally easy recipe, AND it's delicious. I read some of the reviews and followed the advice of a few reviewers. The recipe makes enough dough that you can kind of play with how you form and bake the cookies. I made mine with a gluten-free flour blend (Lillabee's brand) and did a cup for cup substitution. I also used 1 C coconut oil in place of the vegetable oil, doubled the vanilla, and used 2 tsp baking powder instead of the 1 tsp baking soda and 1 tsp cream of tartar. I also added 1.5 C semi-sweet chocolate chips because why not? I also did not roll the cookies in sugar, nor did I really chill the dough significantly. My kitchen gets hot, so I did keep the bowl in the fridge to keep the dough a little cold, but I didn't find that the dough needed extensive chilling. These cookies do not spread a ton, but they result in crispy, melt-in-your mouth, little delightful treats. The recipe yielded almost 6 dozen cookies. I'll be tucking it in my cookie pocket for future use.

very good! Since everyone was saying the dough was sticky, I replaced the oil with crisco. Very easy to work with. I also just rolled the dough out to half inch thickness and cut into little squares. Neat little square cookies. Then I made them again with no pecans but added dry cranberries and white chocolate chips! Yummy!

My daughter made these. DELICIOUS! They are nothing like store bought sandies.  These are very soft and delicate.  Definitely making them again!

Outstanding!  As others recommended I used 1/2 white & 1/2 brown sugars. Doubled vanilla & 3 cups pecans. Only baked 8-9 minutes in my oven. Didn't bother rolling in powdered sugar. Much better than Keebler Pecan Sandies!!

Theses cookies were delicious and I got so many compliments! I was told they were the best that we're ever eaten, better than store bought. I changed a couple things - I used half brown sugar and white sugar, and also substituted almond extract because I was out of vanilla. I think that added the extra good flavor!

I absolutely LOVE these cookies! So moist, flavorful and cute :-) Lately I've been spoiling my husband with little treats from 
this site and these are by far his favorite. He 
says he'd take these over Kebler any day and I'd have to agree with him. I used 
unsalted butter instead of margarine cause
 I'm a huge fan of butter (butter makes 
everything better) and with the oil butter 
combo I had no problems getting the them 
off the cookie sheet. Bake these amazing 
cookies and share the goodness :-)

I adjusted the recipe to be gluten-free and they were amazing!  Here are the changes I made (thanks to other reviews also):
1. butter instead of margarine
2. coconut oil instead of vegetable oil
3. 1/2 c white sugar and 1/2 c dark brown sugar instead of all white
4. 2 teaspoons of vanilla instead of one
5. Instead of 4 cups all-purpose flour I used:
   2 c brown rice flour
   1/2 c coconut flour
   1/2 c spelt flour
   1/2 c tapioca flour
   1/4 c almond flour
   1/4 c white rice flour
   1 tsp baking powder
I really mixed the sugars and butter mix until very creamy and almost stiff.  Because other reviewers refrigerated, I did so for about 30 minutes.  I rolled into small balls and baked for 8 minutes.  Then I removed and squished with the back of a spoon and returned to oven for 2 more minutes.  I let cool on baking sheet.  These cookies had great texture and flavor and melted in your mouth.  I got huge praises and everyone wanted the recipe.

I stuck to the recipe except for using butter instead of margarine and adding 1/2tsp almond extract. They were so good. i took some to the bar with me (it was dart night) and the bartender said they were the best cookies she'd ever had, and begged me to make her a batch to take to her parents' house for Christmas. Another person there has already given me the stuff to make her husband a batch for his birthday. My first homemade cookies and these were the responses! Thank you so much for posting this! Oh yeah, DO use parchment paper. I was able to bake all three batches on one piece. So awesome. Also, i discovered, by accident, that putting a biscuit in plastic container with the cookies makes them soft. I had baked some buttermilk biscuits and had a couple left over. I had room in with the cookies, which were several days old by then. Next evening, the cookies were soft. I magine a piece of sandwich bread would work as well.

I am giving this recipe only 4 stars because it calls for margarine which make for a cookie that is too bready. The second time I made them I substituted butter for the margarine and got a wonderful cookie! They were crisp and buttery and that is the only way to make them.

I just finished making them and they turned out amazing! I added freshly grated cinnamon sticks with the sugar you roll them in and then a little more before I baked them. They taste so good. Definitely going to make them again.

I make these with Olive Oil and then don't squish them too tight.  Sprinkle with a light dusting of powdered sugar and they are delicious 'breakfast biscuits!"

I HAVE ALWAYS HATED PECAN SANDIES!! I made these for my mom because it has always been her favorite cookie.  OH MY GOSH!! I could not stop eating them!!  They were delicious.  My parents raved about them.  They were the best they had eaten.  I think if you can get me to eat these, and I don't even like pecans, then you have done something amazing!  Thanks for the recipe!

Very good, I added 2 teaspoon of cinnamon sugar, used light brown sugar instead of white, and doubled the vanilla extract.Used 1 teaspoon of baking powder instead of baking soda and cream of tarter. I used salted butter so I did not add salt.

Delicious!!  No more store bought Pecan Sandies for me!  Did as others suggested and used butter instead of margarine.  Used 1/2 white sugar and 1/2 brown sugar and waited till the cookies came out of the oven to sprinkle with sugar.  Will definitely be making this cookies again.

I actually forgot the powdered sugar and they still turned out excellent!! It was a soft dough (since I had forgotten the extra cup of sugar, otherwise it would have been more stiff) but I liked it that way. Very easy to scoop and press with my hands. They baked nice and crispy. I used butter instead of margarine, 2 tsp of vanilla instead of 1, 1/2 cup of white and 1/2 cup of brown sugar and about 1 and 1/4 tsp of salt. I also added my own homemade chocolate covered toffee that I crushed into bits. I loved the sweet/salty flavor combination it had with the extra salt. My father only likes to eat oatmeal cookies, no matter how many types of cookies I've tried to bake for him, none compare to his precious oatmeal. So when he said he liked these even better than his usual oatmeal cookies, that confirmed that this batch was a real winner. I will make them again with my modifications. I may even make them again without the cup of powdered sugar, but I will also try it with the powdered sugar just to see what happens! This is a perfect dough to add other ingredients to, you can get creative like I did with the toffee bits. Toffee and pecans...yum! But you could add chocolate chips or other nuts. I really liked this recipe--it's a keeper. I'm sure it would have been more "sandie" if I hadn't forgotten the powdered sugar. But as it was it was still a hit with my family.

I really liked these cookies. I would suggest making a half of a batch. I think they also taste better the day after you make them.

Very tasty.  I do not know how you can roll them in powdered sugar before baking.  They were too soft if you make them exactly as the recipe states.  I put the tops in powdered sugar after baking and, like everyone says, they were very good.  Would make again.

ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS!!! Just baked them and HAD to review. I've never had sandies before but they looked so appetising. I used butter instead of margarine and 1/2 white and 1/2 brown sugar as per other reviewers. Awesome recipe thanks!

Great recipe! My son is allergic to pecans so I altered the recipe.  I used all butter instead of oil and margarine, and 1 1/2 tsp almont extract instead of vanilla...so I guess they were almond butter cookies! ;-) Anyway, they were melt in your mouth out super yummy! I brought some to work and everyone LOVED them!!

awesome! I made these as a treat in my holiday plate for my neighbors, they loved this cookie! In one batch I used margarine and the other butter. I think they tasted similar, margarine made the cookie more shortbread like, but I think the butter ones were slightly more richer, plus its not as bad for you. I plan on making these again very soon!

I made these cookies over the Christmas holidays and they were so popular that I had to make them twice!  The recipe makes lots of cookies so with the second batch, I made much bigger cookies.  I also added about a half teaspoon of cinnamon to the sugar they were rolled in for the second batch.  My dad has already requested more of these delicious cookies!

Good recipe.  I also made one with macadamia nuts.  I love to bake but don't love sweets.  Changed the recipe to reflect a less sweet version.    Items changed:  1 cup margarine to 1 cup butter 1 cup of sugar to 3/8 cup white, 3/8 cup brown sugar 1 teaspoon vanilla extract to 2 teaspoon vanilla extract  1/2 cup white sugar for decoration to sprinkling confectioners sugar on pecans

Wonderful, it was an easy recipe, the cookies came out perfectly firm and light. It also made a lot so I was able to give a lot of them out for Christmas gifts, but we had enough here at home to munch on. My husband and son LOVED them. They went fast...will be making them next Christmas.

These cookies turned out wonderfully. Will definitely make again. I love pecan sandies but this was the first time I actually made them homemade.  My fiance said he didn't like pecan sandies, but somehow he seemed to eat more of them than any other cookies I made for the holidays!!

Makes a lot!  Our family enjoyed these - nice and light, very sandy texture (but does make a lot of crumbs while eating, and delicate to store).  The flavor was very nice.  Next time I'll definitely half the recipe.

My husband is a huge Pecan Sandies (store bought) fan.  I made these today following the recipe exactly and they came out great.  My husband loved them and said the cookie tasted like the store bought brand .... only better.  This recipe is a keeper.  Thank you.

I substituted butter for the margarine.  While the texture of these was light and crispy, I didn't care for the taste as you could taste the undertone of oil.  Not what I want for a Christmas cookie!

So good!  I used butter instead of margarine, though.  Everything else was perfect.  Chilled the dough a bit before rolling into balls.

I made these as is, but with butter, not margarine. (why marg?). I didn't have enough pecans, and thought maybe that was the flavor lack, but I think as others have suggested, doubling the vanilla and replacing some gran sugar with brown would make this recipe pop. Will make again. Also, I suggest fridging the dough a bit before balling. I had no problems with sticking as others did... And, these are REALLY light cookies. Maybe I'm used to the 'elves' but I find them too light. Will try all the changes in my next attempt. Still, very good overall.

Very good cookie.  I did use a few of the suggestions offered by others such as substituting the cup of sugar with 1/2 brown sugar extra vanilla and toasting the pecans.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Mine did not look like the picture, at all. Did not rise and kind of fell flat.  They're edible, but they taste of cream of tartar or something.  Why not just use baking powder?  I did substitute butter for the margarine, and split the cup of white sugar, using 1/2 white and 1/2 brown as suggested by two reviewers.  I just wasn't that impressed with these cookies overall.  Sorry.

Very good cookies.  Very light and fluffy.  I substituted the margarine with Crisco that I find makes cookies softer longer.

These were really pretty tasty. Light and buttery, I have had this recipe in my recipe box for a few years and never tried them. I made sure the pecans were very finely chopped. Made as a part of my cookie fest and I am glad I finally tried them!

These cookies were pretty good. Instead of rolling in white sugar I rolled them in powdered sugar. That made them better to me. My family loved them.

As other reviewers have mentioned, they do taste like the Keebler Pecan sandies.  I did double the vanilla and added butter extract. Didn't roll in the sugar at the end, but they came out very nicely.

I can't stop eating these gems!!  Look up the term 'melt in your mouth' and these will be mentioned!  I added double the vanilla and splash of almond flavoring.  also, worked very well to use the cookie scoop thingie as mentioned by another reviewer.

Very good. Very tender. I always use 1/2 whole wheat flour. Don't roll the dough in the sugar, just dip them and place sugar side up on baking sheet(so they dont stick) and remove from pan o cooloing rack immediately. This one is going in my recipe stash!

Oh man!  The dough is sooo good! I had to lower the oven temp to 350 for my oven. I flattened them a bit with a glass before rolling in sugar which made them a little cruchier. Now I need to make it with almonds!  Thanks for the recipe!

My sister said these taste just like the keebler sandies but even better. I didnt use any salt. The pecans and butter added enough already. I liked them better not rolled in sugar. Also I underbaked them slighlty and stored a whole bunch in my freezer.

These cookies are DELICIOUS!! Do follow some of the advice of others: I used butter instead of margarine and these cookies do spread out a lot when they cook, so make sure to give them plenty of room on the cookie sheet. I made them to send to my husband who is serving in Iraq, but they are pretty crumbly and already started breaking apart when I was packaging them. Other than that, I had to force myself to stop eating them so that I still had something to send to him! Thanks for the recipe :)

Mary Ann, thank you so much for submitting this recipe.  This is the best that I have been able to find since my mother passed.  She never shared her recipes and we never found her books.  Thank you so much.

These were good!  Halfway through the recipe, I realized I didn't have any pecans (yeah, it's a good thing to check and make sure you have PECANS before you make PECAN SANDIES!!!) so I just rolled the un-nutty dough into balls and rolled them into cinnamon sugar.  They came out like snickerdoodles, and were very good.  Sometime I will try these again with PECANS!!!!!!

I have made this recipe twice for my family so far, and it was a BIG hit. Especially with my husband whose farvorite cookies are pecan sandies. He LOVED them, and won't be going back to store bought. Wonderful recipe!!

While these were DELICIOUS, I had trouble with the texture.  When I tried to remove them to the cooling racks, they really crumbled.  I had halved the recipe to make 4 dozen, so I put 24 cookies on each of 2 cookie sheets and put them both in the oven at the same time, one in the upper 1/3 of the oven, and one in the lower 1/3.  Could it be that they didn't bake evenly, and I should have done them in 2 batches???  Any advice would be appreciated, as these are VERY GOOD.  Also, I did need more white sugar in which to roll the cookies than the recipe indicates--next time I might try some of them w/o the additional sugar, since they were very sweet.

This is a very good recipe although, I wish it could be made healthier, 1 cup of oil is a lot! These cookies baked perfectly and tasted very close to the pecan sandies you can buy in the store. I wish I had paid attention to how many cookies the recipe made before I started making them, because I would have halved the recipe. Good recipe for a bake sale, holidays or for gifts.

I tried it with desperation since I lost my original recipe and amazingly enough the cookies came out almost identical to mine and of course I was estatic. The recipe is my favorite.
