This is so easy and very tasty. Perfect way to add some brightness to a roasted chicken dinner. I followed it exactly with the exception of the peas. I subbed chopped asparagus because fresh peas werenâ€™t available at the roadside stands yet.

Used frozen peas. This was really good and very easy to prepare.
