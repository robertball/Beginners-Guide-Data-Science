EXCELLENT!  This will be a regular on my recipe rotation.  I took the recommendations from many of the other comments:
- 1 can chopped tomatoes with chiles in place of one can of soup
- 1 can white beans instead of red kidney (I don't like the red ones)
- 1 can of corn (great addition and adds color!)
- 1 (4oz) can green chiles
- 1/2 can extra water
- I cooked the onion with the meat

I browned the onion and meat the night before and put measured out the spices into a bowl. In the morning, it took less than 10 minutes to throw it all together and go.  My husband had 3 bowls!  Thanks for the great recipe.

This is a great base for a slow cooker turkey chili. If you omit the red pepper flakes and replace one can of the tomato soup with a can of tomatoes with green chilis, this recipe is VERY kid friendly. When I want a more spicy version (I love spicy food!), I only add between 1/4 and 1/2 teaspoons of the red pepper flakes. An entire teaspoon simmering all day in a slow cooker will blow out your sinuses! In addition to the black beans, I also used both dark and light red kidney beans to make it more festive. This recipe is a keeper in my recipe box. Thanks!

This is great chili! I made two pots two cold days in a row! I followed the recommendations of other reviewers: I used one can of diced tomatoes with green chilis in place of one can of tomato soup. I cut the chili powder in half (it was still spicy!), added a bit of water, and added jalepenos. Yum!

I wish I could give this recipe more than 5 stars! Absolutely delicious! I took the advice of some others and only added 1 can of tomato soup, but also put in 2 cans of diced tomatoes. We like spicy food so I added some diced green chiles and a couple of chopped jalapeno peppers. My husband HATES ground turkey, but he had seconds of this chili. Thanks so much for a healthy recipe that tastes like its not!
I could seriously eat this twice a week and not get tired of it... YUMMY!!!

This is one spicy chili! I only used one can of kidney beans - 2 cans would have been overload, also used the other suggestions and used one can tomato soup and one can diced tomatoes with green chiles...added 1/2 can of water so I had no complaints on it being too thick. Also added a few sprinkles of hot sauce - not sure if that is what made it extra spicy or just the fact I added a little more than the 2 Tbsp of Chili powder. Omitted allspice and you would never know. I would have to say this is a keeper but would definitely NOT give it to my 2 1/2 year old, much to spicy! Perfect with bread, a little cheese and sour cream!

This was wonderful.  I substituted 2 cans of diced tomatoes for the tomato soup.  Perfect meal for a chili (haha)day.

our very first time making chili, and it came out so good! we like it SPICY so we added one habernero pepper seeded & chopped, one small can of diced jalapenos, and half a tablespoon of tobasco. i was worried at first that the jalapenos would be overkill, but all that time in the slow cooker seemed to mellow the flavors while infusing them into everything. also added diced fresh red and green bell peppers and replaced the tomato soup with diced tomatoes. our neighbors who used to run a restaurant in baja loved it! and so healthy on top of everything. this is a keeper!

I thought this was GREAT!  The only thing I changed was I added a can of chopped tomatoes instead of one of the cans of tomato soup.  It was a little thicker than I would have liked but was still great especially for dipping with tortillas.  Next time I will use more spices - I like my chili a bit spicier.  Overall a great spin on chili.

Didn't have measuring spoons (we just moved and I can't find half my stuff) so I guess-timated and it still turned out great.  My boyfriend had two huge servings and took the rest for lunch today at work.  Easy recipe.  We topped it with shredded cheddar cheese and crumbled crackers.  YUM!

This is an awesome, low-fat chili! My boyfriend made this today for the first snowfall of the year, and I think we may have started a tradition. He added two chopped jalapenos and one anaheim chili, as well as one can of chopped tomatoes (drained). He omitted the allspice as we had none on hand. The end result was fabulous. Thanks!

This chili is delicious. My boyfriend and I used leftover turkey from Thanksgiving. We read through reviews and also made a few changes. Instead of tomato soup, we used 1 can of tomato paste ( that helps with the thickness) 1 can of water, 2 cans of kidney beans (1 light and one dark red for color. DRAINED), 1/2 white onion, 1 can of corn, 1- 4 oz can of diced green chiles and 2 cans of diced tomatoes (1 with green chiles, 1 plain) 2 TBL chile powder, 1 TBL cumin, 1 TBL garlic powder. Salt and Pepper to taste. Started 2 hours high and 4 hours low. EXCELLENT.

ATTENTION MY SISTER (and brother) WEIGHT WATCHERS...this delicious chili is only 4 points per serving! - ;)
 (I've estimated that a serving is about a 1 cup of chili)

This one is a sneaker hit! Very simple and not a lot of fanfare, but great-tasting! Minor modifications: I sauteed the onion with the turkey, used 1 can of diced tomatoes in lieu of 1 can of the low-sodium tomato soup and I rinsed the beans after draining them. (There was still a little bit of a poot factor, but oh well!)

At first (in the crock pot) the chili seemed a bit too thick. I almost added some liquid, but waited for it to start simmering. As everything started to settle down together, the chili became the perfect consistency of a hearty, stick-to-your-ribs chili!

Side note: In all of the chili recipes I have made, allspice has been a surprisingly welcome addition - even a mere pinch. Next time I make this I will try adding a pinch more! Also, do not forget your chopped green onions, sour cream, shredded cheese, corn chips, etc. - whatever you like - to accent your dish!

This was a great surprise.  I think I decided to try this recipe because I liked the picture, it had a good rating and looked quick and easy.  Still, I had my doubts about a tomato soup based chili and worried throughout the day about whether my crockpot was going to scorch the whole batch.  I cooked the chili on low for eight hours per the instructions and not only did it not scorch at all, it was delicious.  I might cut back on the red pepper flakes a bit next time, as it has quite a bite, but cheese and sour cream helped turn the heat down a little.  My husband loved it.

This was soooooo good. People often complain that turkey chili is too bland/flavorless. Not this one! I did opt for one can of tomato soup and one can of diced tomato with green chilis. Also, used just two cans of beans (one red kidney, one black) and sauteed my onions with the turkey.  I was also generous with the chili powder, garlic, and red pepper flakes because I like spice. Thought I'd have leftovers for lunch this week but it was GONE...served with corn bread and low fat shredded cheese. Will definitely make this again in the next week or so. Enjoy!

This was excellent turkey chili!  Loved the flavor (which usually goes out the window when subbing in turkey for ground beef) and only made a couple of minor substitutions.  Plugged in one can of diced tomatoes and one can of tomato sauce instead of the soup, used a whole onion instead of half, only did half of the chili powder so it was kid-friendly.  It was excellent!  My husband, who is pretty picky, loved it and so did my brother - he said he didn't even notice it was turkey instead of beef!  Nice!  Thanks!

Very good cooked on high for 4 hours just as the recipe said. I personally think you can just add a can of Rotel diced tomatoes w/green chili in addition to the 2 cans tomato soup because this chili was not too soupy for me at all. In my opinion, 2 tablespoons of chili powder is a LOT of chile powder, be careful unless you love it burnin' hot.   I added a couple of bay leaves and also chopped a green bell pepper and added that to it.  I used a can of corn (drained) for one of the bean cans in the recipe.   My 10 yr old son ate 3 bowls......  This recipe gets 5 stars because it will turn out tasty no matter what you substitute ( within reason).......I would say , in closing , that 1 TB is enough chili powder for most.......If you want more heat, add a few drops of Tabasco sauce or you can chop a seeded jalapeno . Whatever your heart desires.........

I make this chili about once a month in the wintertime. It is delicious as is, and always turns out great!! 

I've found that you can pretty much add whatever you've got in your pantry/fridge to make this chili more hearty. I always add a jar of roasted red peppers  (adds a bright red color and tasty depth), chopped green bell pepper if I have it around, and corn works great too. If it seems like it's too thick, I just add a little extra water and it always seems to accept more ingredients without any issues. Enjoy!!

I mixed a package of ground turkey with a package of turkey sausage to give the chili some more flavor, it was delicious!  Also I used 2 cans of diced tomatos with green chiles instead of the tomato soup, and used a can each of black, red, and white beans.  I will definitely be making this chili again!

Very easy recipe.  Great hit at a super bowl party.  I seasoned the turkey with garlic pepper and salt when I stir-fried it.  I also substituted 1 can of tomato soup with a can of chopped tomatoes and chili pepper and added a can of corn.  Thank you!

I liked the chili but it was a little lacking on flavor.  It could be because the turkey was leftovers and not freshly made. I would make it again.

This is my go to recipe for chili. First off i would like to say that this chili is great when made exactly as the recipe is written! I have made countless batches of this recipe since I first found it about 3 years ago. I usually use 2 cans of black beans and only 1 of kidney beans. Sometimes I add a can of corn. I always top it with crushed Cheddar sunchips. I don't use onion and instead use onion powder but that is only because I don't care much for onion. Also, it can be made in about an hour on the stovetop.

Excellent!  I'm not much of a cook but have attempted to make chili a handful of times - each time, it came out way too bland.  This recipe is AWESOME!  I'm a wimp when it comes to spices, but this combines great flavor w/out being too crazy hot.  I made a few minor adjustments and doubled the recipe for a SuperBowl party... and it was a hit.  I will definitely make this again - probably add it to our rotation during these cold Colorado winters!

This was excellent chili.  I used a 15 oz. can of tomato sauce and a 15 oz. can of diced tomatoes and it is perfect consistency.  I also added a tablespoon of adobo sauce for a little more zip.  Thanks for a great recipe.

This was a great base for a quick, delicious and healthy recipe! Thanks! Based on other reviews, I used the juices from 1 can tomato soup, 1 diced tomato can and 1 stewed can which worked perfect. I added corn, scallions and basil as well, added a few more seasonings and voila -- a not-so spicy chili dish that is fantastic! (And meanwhile I thought all chili dishes had to be spicy, guess not).

This didn't turn out like chili for me, more like soup. I don't eat canned tomato soup, so I used two cans organic tomato sauce. I also used two cans organic black beans as I don't care for kidney beans. I did add more chopped vegetables, four large organic peppers, one ginormous onion and a whole mess of garlic. I also doubled the spices. This turned out really well and is enough to feed me all week for very cheap. When I make this next time, I might add a can of organic diced tomatoes to beef it up a bit, maybe play with the spices some. NOTE: I used California chili powder, which is a milder flavored chili. You get a lot of the flavor without a bunch of heat. You can find it in those little cellophane envelopes in the ethnic aisle of your supermarket.

I started cooking this recipe about a year ago, and I certainly think it lives up to its 5 star rating.  In orer to avoid the high fructose corn syrup in tomato soup, I've tried substituting Hunt's tomato sauce.  This makes the chili less sweet, since Hunt's has no sugar added.  I've tried countering this by adding a sugar substitute like Splenda, which works pretty well.

This was a delicious recipe. Mine came out VERY thick though, nothing like the picture! It was JUST the way I like it! I had 2 cans of black beans and one can of cannellini beans...so that's what I used here. I also didn't have allspice but I threw in a touch of Chinese 5 Spice. YUM! And I added 1/2 cup of hotsauce to this for a little extra kick...wow. This was fantastic. And really, SO easy.

Delicious! I made it with ground chicken. I followed the advice of other users and did the following: Replaced 1 of the cans of tomato soup with 2 cans tomatoes w/diced green chiles, only used 1 can of kidney beans, and omitted the allspice. YUM!!!

I have never reviewed before but I just had to this time. This chili is amazingly delicious. For someone like me, who doesn't like heat without flavor it was perfect. Just the right amount of spice without being overwhelming. I also added a can of sweet corn just to give it some nice color and used a little extra turkey, about a half pound extra, as I have a house full of men who love their meat. This recipe was easy and so good. I will definitely be making it again!

Great and simple recipe!  Followed the advice of many others here.  Added a chopped onion in the skillet along with the turkey (2.5 lbs).  1 can of black beans, 1 can of chili beans, 2 cans of corn, 1 can of tomatoes, 1 can of tomatoes with chilis and a packet of chili seasoning.  Our friends love this, thanks for the recipe!

The recipe is great! I subbed diced tomatoes for the soup, added a diced yellow pepper, & omitted the allspice. **NOTE: If you are feeding a hungry crowd and/or want leftovers, you may want to double the recipe. It makes 8 small portions.

Instead of 2 cans of kidney beans, I used 1 can of kidney and 1 can of white canneloni beans. I added a can of corn and a can of stewed diced tomatoes. 

It's absolutely delicious and probably the best chili I have ever had!

Laura's Quick Slower Cooker Turkey Chili Haiku: "This was fine and good. But closer to 3.5. Less red pepper flakes!" Eek, I don't know if my child would've liked this if it had sat in the crockpot chirping w/ a whole teaspoon of red pepper flakes, so I reduced it to 1/4 tsp., and also dropped a can of kidney beans, due to what I had available. 6 hrs in the crockpot on low later and it was charring at the corners, so I had to add some water. 2 hrs. later, it was glue-thick (which in all honesty, is how I like my chili) but the crockpot was a b1+c4 to scour after dinner. I liked this chili alright, and you would never guess that it was turkey and not ground beef, but I'm not entirely sure if I'd make it again.

I followed other reviewers' suggestions and replaced one can of tomato soup with a can of Rotel and then added 1 can of corn.  I tripled the seasoning and thought this was more of a stew than a chili but it still had great flavors!  Served with reduced sodium fritos.

This recipe is my go-to chili recipe.  I've made it probably 5 times now and only change a couple things here and there to suit mine and my fiance's preferences.  I use 1 can of tomato soup/1 can diced tomatoes to make it a little chunkier & give it a slightly more fresh taste.  I also skip 1 can of beans and just use 1 can black, 1 can white cannellini beans.  I've also started adding 1 diced green pepper to give it a little color and some freshness.  Otherwise, this recipe is delicious.  The proportions of spices are perfect!

This is my most favorite recipe I've ever made from this site. I've made it probably 20 times. It freezes super well too so when I don't feel like cooking, I'll pull some out in the morning and let defrost in the fridge. I've taken suggestions from reviews and have made some changes as well. I substituted one can of tomato soup for a can of diced tomatoes. I also add a can of white beans and a can of corn, drained. It's also better the second day.

Everyone asks me for this recipe now!! Thanks to this recipe i am now famous for making great chili :-) I followed the recommendations from the reviews and added a can each of corn and green chilies. A friend later made the same recipe but left out the cumin - it makes a big difference, worth going out and buying it if you don't have it at home.

Easy, excellent recipe!  I've made this twice now, and did a double batch the second time.  I followd it exactly and it's delicious.  We add shredded cheddar, a spoonful of sour cream, and jalepenos before eating.

FANTASTIC!  I did make changes based on comments, but am sure it is just as good in it's original format.  We like spicy/hot foods but even I did a double take at the spice quanties, but the amounts are perfect (left out the allspice).  I even added 1 chopped jalapeno pepper & 1-4 oz can gr chilies. I used only 1 can soup and in place of the 2nd, added 1 can diced tomato.  I also substituted 1 can of the kidney beans for frozen corn.  Also added a generous 1/2 cup water and increased the onion to 1 rather large onion.  It was so good that I had leftovers for bkfst this morning - couldn't wait until lunch time!

This chili is yummy! I added a can of diced tomatoes and a can of green chilies for extra flavor. I served it with homemade cornbread on the side and topped the chili with sour cream and shredded cheddar cheese. Perfect for a chilly fall night. Thanks for the great recipe!

This turkey chili was absolutely wonderful!  I made a few changes based on other reviews.  I used a can of no salt added tomato sauce and a can of fire roasted diced tomatoes.  I also added some frozen corn.  I used a can of chili beans and a can of great northern beans.  I love the fact that this is rather healthy, as far as chili goes.  A dollop of light sour cream on mine and some sour cream and shredded Mexican cheese on my husband's and dinner was served!  Thanks for sharing your recipe with us.

Phenomenal!  The store was out of ground turkey so I used ground chicken.  Reduced to 1 can tomato soup, substituted cannellini beans for the black beans, added diced tomatoes with jalapenos, drained.  Omitted red pepper flakes and allspice.  Put in slow cooker on low for 8 hrs.  Forgot to spray the crock (oops) so I stirred it a few times.  No big deal.  Yummy with cheese & fritos!

This is fantastic chili!!! I did make a few changes, though. I didn't have any tomato soup, so instead I used canned no-salt added diced tomatoes, and instead of garlic powder I used 1 tsp minced garlic, 2 cans red sodium black beans (they are my fave!), and only a good sized pinch of the pepper flakes (a full tsp seems like a lil tooooo much!). I also used ground turkey breast.  Super healthy & yummy, super easy!!! Thanks for the recipe  :)

OMG this is delicious!!! The only changes i made was substituting 2 cans of diced tomatos for the tomato soup & only using 1 can of kidney beans.  I also used a full packet of mccormick chili seasoning.  I didn't use any allspice either.  This turned out GREAT!!  The amount of "spiceyness" was just right! HIGHLY recommend this recipe for a healthier version of chili:)

So so so good. I subbed the tomato soup for crushed tomatoes because I like the texture (chunky) much better. I didn't have allspice so I omitted that. I cooked the ground turkey with the onions. BEST CHILI EVER!

This recipe is a great base. I doubled the chili powder, add a few dashes of tabasco, a can of corn (drained), and also a can of diced tomatoes(I used the "chili diced tomatoes)! It came out fantastic!

Good chili!  Very easy to make - I did as another reviewer did and used 1 can of tomato soup and 1 can of whole tomatoes instead of 2 cans of soup.  Will make this one again.  UPDATE:  I froze some of this four months ago and just ate it last week - I'm happy to say that it was good!  Held up well and tasted great!

I followed others suggestions and LOVED this recipe.  Instead of using two cans of tomato soup, I used one can and added a can of diced tomatoes.  I also added a can of corn and just one can of kidney beans.  It was delicious!

Excellent for a quick chilli. I made my own beans because I hate the can aftertaste. I followed the ingredients and directions to a T and cannot think of anything to change about it. Oh, I added green bell peppers.

This is a great one.  I added a healthy amount of Frank's hot sauce to give it some kick.  I am going to add a can of beer next time for additional flavor.

My husband wanted more of a 'kick'; I thought it fine. However, I was disappointed that there wasn't enough liquid. I added 3/4 c water and a small can of tomato sauce. I will make it again - with the adjustments noted.

This is really, (I mean really) good chili. We make as directed (except for lessening the amount of red pepper flakes) and its delicious. It in our rotation.

I used frozen turkey breast scallopini (thrown in frozen, diced after cooking), 2 cans diced tomatoes ILO of the tomato soup, a can of water, a bottle of beer, and 1/2 a bag of Trader Joe's frozen charred corn, otherwise followed the ingredients pretty closely.  Cooked for about an hour in the pressure cooker instead of using a slow cooker (worked just fine).  I found the flavor to be rather bland (definitely not overly spicy!) and flat.  In the end I added 1 t. cocoa powder (definitely helped) and some crushed tortilla chips, then let it cook (without pressure) for about 30 minutes more.  With these changes it was worth 3.5-4 stars.  Sour cream, cheese, and sliced green onions on top may have helped, too.

This recipe is really good.  I gave it a 4 out of 5 stars because I did have to tweak it a bit like some of the others did.  I wanted to add more turkey and no beans because no one likes beans in our family.  (Sorry, I know chili w/no beans!?)  So instead i had 2 lbs. of turkey. Cooked the onion and garlic (used chopped garlic) with the meat the night before threw it in crock pot the next day. I did not have the tomato soup so used a small can of tomato sauce and two cans of diced tomatoes one had green chilies in the can.  I also had to add a little water to the mix with the addition of the meat because it was so thick.  I used all of the other ingredients as stated except for the pepper flakes, I used half of that, wasn't sure how spicey that would be with 1 tsp. so to be safe I used 1/2 tsp.  When it was done i topped it with diced onions fritos and sour cream.  Fritos are a personal fav of our family on top of chili.  I think I will use this recipe again.  Great to be able to throw things into a crock pot and come home to a warm bowl of chili for dinner that night.  Served with corn bread too!! :)

MMMMMMM GOOD!!  Everyone raved about the chili.  My 84 year old grandpa who isn't a chili fan said this is the first chili he's ever tasted that he liked. He had 3 bowls.  I substituted one can of tomato soup with a can of diced tomatoes and chilies.  I also omitted the garlic since I am allergic.  I added cherry tomatoes for the last hour of cooking. I will definitely make again!

Because of the GREAT reviews I was excited to try this.  Sorry but I HATED IT!  The flavors were weird.  Maybe because of the changes I've made, but I followed other reviews..substituting 2 cans of soup w/ 2 cans chopped tomato, & used only 1 can of kidney beans & half of pepper flakes.  Cooked it on low for 6 hours and it turned out a little dry.  I added tomato paste, some water, & some sugar to somehow sweeten the flavor.  Maybe tomato soup would have made a big difference.

Great recipe.  Like many other reviewers, I substituted diced tomatoes (drained) for some of the tomato soup, and added a jalapeno and anaheim pepper for a little kick.  After sprinkling the shredded cheese on top, I put the dishes under the broiler for a few seconds, then topped with low-fat sour cream.

Loved it! As other reviewers suggested, I replaced one of the cans of soup with a can (10.5 oz) of diced tomatoes with green chilis. Cooked it on high for 4 hours and it had a perfect consistency. I served it over baked potatoes and it got gobbled up fast. Would definitely make again but might add some tobasco for some more zip (we like things spicy). Very easy and tasty!

This chili turned out perfect! I added 1 can of rotel instead of one of the cans of tomato soup, and also added a small can of corn. I made mine slightly spicier as well. It was delicious. Excellent texture and flavor. I will be making this regularly. Even my very picky father liked it!! :)

This was delicious and simple to make.  I doubled the recipe (except for the kidney beans) for use in my 6-quart crockpot, and replaced the black beans with 2 (14.5 oz) cans of diced tomatoes (undrained) to make it a more moist while also adding a jalapeno for more heat.  It tasted just as good as leftovers today.  I was looking for a simple crockpot turkey chili recipe and came upon this one first via Google.  My search has ended!  Thank you, Laura!

A great recipe! The teaspoon of red pepper was a bit much for our tastes, even though we enjoy spicy food. I'll tone that down next time. We served this over elbow macaroni and topped it with sour cream. My husband called it "five alarm turkey chili" but we enjoyed it.

We loved this chili. It was easy to make and it had a wonderful flavour to it. The cumin makes it smell and taste great and the consistency was just how we like it. This will probably go into our dinner rotation. Thanks!

LOVED IT! This was a hit with the the whole family! Made a couple changes-didn't use the soup, as I didn't want the high-fructose corn syrup, so I subbed with 1 can of Hunt's Natural tomato sauce and 1 can diced tomatoes with green chilis, cut the red pepper flakes to a ½ tsp (my younger daughter can't do too spicy), used 1 can each of organic black beans and organic dark red kidney beans (drained and rinsed), and used pumpkin pie spice in place of the allspice because that was all I had. Didn't use any extra water and the consistency was perfect. Topped with 2% sharp cheddar and diced white onions (for my helping) and it was fabulous! I was so sure that my younger daughter (17) wouldn't like it, as she actually said “ewww" when I told her I was making chili, but she loved it! This will definitely be a regular on the menu! Thank you for this great recipe!

I've made this so many times! I just want to point out that it is easily made gluten-free by substituting the soup for one can diced tomatoes and a can of tomato sauce. Adding a little cornmeal will help thicken it up.

AWESOME!!! I followed exactly except for cutting back chili powder to 1 1/2 T... end result was still a little spicy (but still very good...I'm a wimp) so next time I will cut red pepper flakes in half.  Cook time in my crockpot was 4 hr on low.

Super easy, healthy, and delicious recipe!  Based on other reviews, I used the diced tomatoes with chiles instead of tomato soup, halved the chili powder, and added about a 1/2 cup of water towards the end to get the desired consistency.  I also threw the onions in the skillet while browning the turkey to soften them up a little.  This will definitely be a repeat recipe in my house.

This was unbelievable!! I listened to some other reviewers and made a few changes. I used 1 19 oz can of tomato soup, added 1 can of diced tomatoes with green chilis, swapped out one can of corn in place of one can of red kidney beans, left out the allspice, and seasoned my ground turkey with onion powder as it was cooking. I was a little pressed for time, so I cooked it on high for 1 hour and on low for 6. This was one of the best chili recipes I've ever had and I will definitely be making it again!

I agree with everyone's notes on additions, especially the corn-adds nice texture and color. Poured it over corn-bread and it was perfect with the flavors of the chili!

This was GREAT! Definitely added 2 cans of diced tomatoes and about a cup of water instead of tomato sauce. Added 1 can of black beans and 1 kidney beans. Also added a little more chili powder and chopped up celery to give more flavor. Excellent with cheese, and dollop of sour cream! yummy!

This is a delicious, filling, quick and healthy meal!  Great for the winter time.  It feeds a lot of people, or it's a great leftover.  I've been making this recipe for over a year now, and my boyfriend loves it!  Thank you!

Awesome chili!  I also modified the recipe.  I didn't think I had chili powder so added some sweet chili paste; then found my chili powder so added only 1 1/2 tbsp of chili powder.  I used less red pepper flakes, and used a combination of tomatoes, tomato soup and also added some water.  I then added about 2 tbsp of cornstarch to thicken it up.  I served it with grated cheddar and a dollop of sourcream on top.  I will definitely make this one again.

I just made this last night and it was excellent! The best chili i've ever made! I did not add two cans of tomato soup, just one and replaced the 2nd one with a can of diced tomatoes. I then added 1 can of water b/c it looked so thick. I also added 2 cans of corn, 1 jalapeno, and chopped up 1 green bell pepper. I cooked corn bread as a side!

This chili has become a winter staple in our house. I added a can of corn; I've sometimes substituted white beans for kidney but it is good both ways.

Great recipe. I forgot to pick up the Chili powder but with some research found out that all I needed to do was add a bit more cumin and garlic.  Turned out perfect! Just enough punch to be noticeable. Also, had to double the recipe for a large household.

Quick, Easy & Yummy!  The only changes I made were to eliminate the olice oil (used Pam) and I took the advice of others and used 1 can tomato soup and 1 can stewed tomatoes.  I also added a can as it was a bit thick for my liking.  Overall a really good dinner to come home to after a long day at work.

Thank you, Laura! I made this over the weekend- perfect for Sunday night dinner! Made the recipe EXACTLY but just added a can of corn (drained, of course)! So delicious and healthy. Served it with low-fat sour cream and shredded Mexican cheese, and of course oyster crackers. Was such a hit, we had leftovers for dinner Monday night. Thanks again!

I followed this recipe to the letter. I did not care for the cumin. I normally like cumin, but in this case it was all I could taste. This was my first experience using turkey to make a chili and I'm not sure I would do it again. Besides the overpowering cumin, there was something missing in this recipe. I'm not sure if it was the turkey making the difference or not.

This  was very good and easy to prepare. I used a different combination of beans, and Italian ground turkey, which has a little more flavor then plain ground turkey. The spices used in this recipe are very flavorful. It's even better the next day, when it all blends. Topped it with a dollop of sour cream Thanks Laura!!

Had to add in my 2 cents!  This is an awesome recipe!  I didn't use all spice as I didn't have any, so I took the advise of another reviewer and added montreal steak seasoning and it turned out amazing!  The second time I made it, I used a combo of red, black and pinto beans, cooked those for 18 hours after soaking 24 hours, then added in the rest of the ingredients and cooked for another 10 hours, and that made it AMAZING and soooo thick!  Definitely something i will be making as much as possible!  Thanks Laura!

This was great. I left out a few of the spicer ingredient so my two year old would eat it, and it turned out fine. First time I've made or had turkey chili, and it's definitely a recipe I'll keep.

I served this for a football party yesterday to a tough audience of chili experts, beef lovers and cooks - it was a hit with everyone.  My mother even asked for the recipe!  Like others, I added a can of drained corn instead of the 2nd can of kidney beans, and a can of diced tomatoes with green chiles instead of the 2nd can of soup.  I also added some water halfway through cooking.  Perfect spices, great blend of flavors.  Delicious!!

This was way better than I expected it to be. I followed the recipe as is. I liked the kick that it had, but I can see how some would want to reduce the heat. I make lots and lots of slow cooker meals and this was one of the best. I just always feel guilty when I eat something that has so much sodium in it....

YUM! This recipe is fantastic. I substituted one of the cans of tomato soup for some diced tomatoes, as other reviewers had suggested but that was the only change I made. I was a little afraid of the red pepper and chili powder but followed the recipe anyways. In the end I thought it had the perfect amount of spice.

This is a keeper! Made a few modifications... only used 1 can of soup and replaced one of the cans of kidney beans with a can of chili beans with sauce. Used a little more cumin than called for (i'd suggest browning the turkey with it, too), added 1/2 cup of water, one can of no salt added corn, one can of undrained diced tomatoes w/ green chiles , one can of green chiles, and one can of undrained stewed tomatoes. I didn't have any allspice, but I found a website that said to use equal amounts of nutmeg, cinnamon, black pepper, and cloves as a subsitute. Turned out great! Served it topped with shredded cheddar and sour cream with tortilla chips on the side for dipping.

I loved this chili.  It was just the right amount of spice for me.  The only thing I would do next time would be to add a little water at the end as needed.  It was a little thick for me.

I didnt have all the ingredients so I adjusted as needed.  I used one 28oz can of petite diced tomoatoes with liquid instead of 2 cans of tomato soup, added 1 chopped jalapeno for heat, I used onion powder insted of garlic powder since I didnt have any and I replaced the salt with garlic salt (since I had that).  I didnt have allspice so I used equal parts of ground cloves, cinnamon, and nutmeg.  I thought the mix  looked a little dry so I added 1 cup water.  It was soooo good.  I served it with shredded cheedar cheese, chopped green onions and home make wakiki cornbread from this site.  My husband was in heaven!

A solid, reliable recipe for busy days. Everyone loves it. If I am short on/out of the soup I do sometimes switch out a can of low sodium diced tomatoes (partially drained) for one or both. I guess that makes it a little thinner, but it's great nonetheless.

Giving this 5 stars, after the tweaking I did. But c'mon, doesn't ALL cooks tweak a recipe? I used tomato sauce in place of the soup, used ground sirloin instead of turkey, added a can of corn, replaced one of the kidney beans for great northern beans, added a can of chilli beans with sauce, and added a chopped bell pepper.

My husband, myself and 4 children from ages 9 to 14 all went back for seconds.

Great Recipe! My family loved it!!! Especially my mom who dosnt really enjoy chili. I did some of the suggestions that the people recomended, no allspice, added 2 can of tomatos, only 1 can of kidney beans (becuase my dad cant really that many beans, and only half the chili powder. Awesome recipe! We also had Cheddar Bay Biscuits with this and it was a great combination.

Very quick and easy!  My whole family really liked this dish a lot...even my 4 year old who doesn't like spicy food but she still thought this was good.  It has just the right amount of spice.  A definite repeat at our house.

This chili is definitely great.  A word to the wise (and for those who don't really like spicy chili):

Cut the cumin to 1 tsp (or even less).
This recipe does NOT need salt at all.
If you don't like spice, cut down on the chili powder (I didn't, but I love spice)

This recipe was delicious and smells great when it's cooking.

A suggestion:  It goes great with the applesauce cornbread muffins on this site as well.  YUMMY!

I have tried this a few times and it is great!  I have since made my own spin by adding a can of  sweet corn, a can of diced basil and oregano tomatoes, and a little ketchup for a smidge of sweetness.  This is great over a baked potatoe and/or with a little bit of cheddar cheese!

All these "it's so spicy!" reviews had me freaked out.  I was in a rush, wrote the recipe down and quickly put it all together after getting home from the store.  That's when I actually started reading the reviews and panicked - everyone was saying to halve the red pepper and I had plowed forward with the full amount.  I like some spice but not so much that I lose all the other flavors.  Well, I've just finished my first bowl and it was AWESOME!  Yes there's a hint of heat that little one's might not like but I've served tortiall soup that was hotter than this chili to toddlers.  

Anyway, if you're concerned then yes, maybe halve it but don't worry if, like me, you bravely/stupidly 'cause you were in a hurry went ahead with the recipe as published don't freak out just yet.

This is the easiest, great tasting recipe. I used one and one-half times the turkey, beans, and soup which made for a very hearty meal. I will likely add some diced tomatoes to it to give it a little more texture. Served it with honey cornbread and honey butter for Christmas Eve. It likely will become our tradition based on the ease of preparing and the taste. Will definitely be making again!

GREAT, easy chili!  I brought this to a pot luck and it was the first thing gone and my family has asked me to make it again because they loved it.  I followed the advice of others;
- I replaced 1 can of soup with diced tomatos w/chilies
- Cut back a little on the chili powder
- Added 1/2 can of water and a can of white kidney beans

This was great!  I did only use 1 can of tomato soup and put in one can of diced tomatoes with chiles, an 8 oz. can of tomato sauce and a 4 oz can of diced chiles and skipped the allspice.  Also only put in one can of kidney beans.  Will make the same way again the next time.

This recipe was very good! Of course like other reviews I made adjustments. I halved this recipe, I used 1/2lbs of ground beef, instead of tomato paste I used 1 can of diced tomatoes and 1 can of Rotel chili. I used the  spices listed and added 1/2 onion, 1 small bell pepper, and 1 cut up jalapeño. I also added a little red pepper. The chili came out with just enough spice. I also cooked it on high for 4 hours.  My husband  and I really liked it! Will definitely make again and perhaps even serve it at parties.

This is a great and very easy way to make a healthy chili. Delicious. You absolutely will not get anyone asking, "Hey is this health-food or something?", just "Wow, this is great chili". You can tweak chili a lot of ways: sub tomato sauce for tomato soup, add hot peppers, adjust onions and spices to your preference and so on. I make this chili just as written, and I make it with tweaks. Always great. Thanks!

I honestly wasn't a fan, while my husband liked it, it was slightly to hot for my kids. And we like spicy but it was enough the kids, had the burns in their throats, they couldn't get past. For me, it had a weird after taste, that I just didn't care for. I think it was the allspice and the mix of tomato soup.

I'm making this for the second time today after it was so well received the first time around!  I also took the advice of other reviewers and added a can of corn and replaced one can of kidney beans with white cannelini beans.  I also sauteed the onions and then added the turkey in and cooked them together.  I used the exact measurements when it came to spices and it turned out great... not to spicy for me or my son, and my husband, who is the spice lover, thought it was perfect.  We topped it off with some crunched blue corn tortilla chips, cheese and sour cream.  Delicious!  I love having enough leftover to freeze... makes a really easy dinner later!

AMAZING! I added about a cup of diced green pepper, an extra tsp of hot pepper flakes, a small can of tomato sauce, and substituted one can of tomato soup for chopped tomatoes (as others reccomended). This chili was definitly one of the best I've had and I'll be making it again soon. The only problem is that the recipe is too small! Double it if you want to have some left over, or feed more than 3 people. You will want seconds of this, garaunteed. The slow-cooker really brings everything together and it thickens up toward the end, don't worry if it looks too liquidy during the first few hours of cooking.

This is so easy and SO good. I took the advice of replacing one can of tomato soup with one can of diced tomatoes--definitely recommend this! I also used real garlic, minced, instead of powdered. I left out the black beans. Two cans of beans total suffice. I used the exact spices called for and it was perfect for us. When another reviewer said they made this twice in one week, I thought that was excessive, but now I get it. We will eat this again soon! And all winter long.

I absolutely love this recipe, I tried it out for the first time tonight and it turned out so great!  My husband and I both devoured our dinner.  I also took a few of the suggested changes: I replaced one can of soup with a can of diced tomatoes, I replaced one of red kidney beans with white ones and I added half a cup of water.  I also just used a package of pre-mixed chilli seasoning since I didn't have all the required spices.  I will definitely be adding this chilli to my winter rotation :)

A good, easy-to-make recipe.  Like others, I substituted 2 cans of diced tomatoes with green chili's for the tomato soup (I just couldn't bring myself to even TRY the soup - just doesn't jive for me).  I followed everything else to the letter and boy was it easy.  The house smelled great, the chili was tasty and just a bit spicy.  A definite keeper.

This was really good! I am not a fan of tomato soup  so I used 1 can of the soup and 1 can of tomato sauce. I also used ground chicken instead of turkey and added 1 cup of frozen corn. It was the perfect consistency. Other than that, I used all the spices as noted and the flavoring turned out really good after simmering all day.

Replaced one can of tomato soup with a can of diced tomatoes and green chilies, and added a seeded jalapeño and a can of green chilies. Turned out very chunky, and I thought it needed a can of tomatoes, but husband and son liked it the way it was!

Excellent recipe! Like other reviewers, I replaced one can of tomato soup with diced tomatoes.  I topped with cheddar cheese and sour cream and served with a light and sweet cornbread (Maryanne's Cornbread on this site) which was a nice complement to the spice in the chili.

Best chili I have had!  It came together very quickly in my slow cooker, and the flavor is terrific.  I did use one can of white beans and one can of black beans because that is what I had in the pantry.  Will use this recipe over and over in the upcoming fall months as an easy weeknight meal that will be ready whever we are - thanks!

This was a great recipe! I followed the recommendations of replacing one of the canned tomato soups with the diced tomatoes with green chiles.   I browned the turkey with the onion and 1 chopped pasilla pepper as well and added a jalapeno to the whole thing. Lots of compliments, and has a building heat as you eat it!

Yum! Although my husband loves spicy food, my kids and I don't, so I modified this recipe a bit as per some of the other reviews. First, I used 1 can of tomato soup, 1 can of diced tomatoes, and 1 can of diced tomatoes with pepper and onion. Then I used about 1/4 of a can of chopped chiles.  I also used 1 can of black beans, 1 can of red kidney beans, and 1 can of white kidney beans. Lastly, I mixed all of the spices listed together (but not allspice bc I didn't have it), and used about 1/3 of it in the chili.  I separated some of the chili halfway through cooking and added more of the spice mix to make it spicier for my husband. I served the chili over rice with cheddar cheese, broken up Fritos, and sour cream. It was a big hit! Very tasty and not too spicy for us girls.  I love this chili recipe and would definitely recommend it.... it's hard to find a recipe for ground turkey that actually tastes this good!

This was super easy and really good!  I will definitely make it again.  I did need to add about 1/2 can of water.  I have small children so I had to try and cut down on the heat.  I cut back on the chili powder to 1 TBL and the red pepper flakes to 1/4 tsp.  Also followed other reviewers and replaced 1 can of soup w/ 1 can of tomatoes with green chilies.  It was still on the spicy side for my kids.  Next time I'll probably leave the red pepper flakes out for the kids sake.  Otherwise, extremely delicious as written!

This was an easy and good chili, it was a bit on the spicy side for us.  I will cut the chili powder down the next time I make this to suit our tastes.

I've made this a bunch of times, with both turkey and beef-it's a definite go-to for me.  I love the fact that this recipe has very simple panty ingredients and simply tastes GREAT.  It's EASILY modified to suit your tastes; I add a can of diced or stewed tomatoes and a can of chilis (gives it lots of heat!), and sometimes a cup of water to thin it and cut it just a bit.  Today I added a can of corn (like others had) and that adds lots of color to this dish.  It's in the slow cooker now-it'll be ready for the Super Bowl kick-off (like I said, it's a go-to recipe!).  Highly recommended.

YUM! My family really enjoyed this. The turkey helped keep the meal reasonably healthy, and we couldn't even tell the difference! I added a can of Rotel and omitted the red pepper (didn't have any!). Instead of tomato soup, I used a can of crushed tomatoes. And we served the soup with a dollop of low fat sour cream and a sprinkle of shredded cheddar cheese. It was delicious! I can't wait to make it again!

I loosely followed the recipe and it was wonderful!  2.5 lbs lean ground turkey, browned w/ one onion, four celery stalks, and one package of chili mixture.  I then put in the crockpot (4+ hours) w/ two 28 oz cans of stewed tomatoes, 2 8 oz cans of tomato sauce, 1 can tom paste, and extra chili powder, cayenne and cumin to taste.  BIG FACTOR in the taste is adding the entire can of kidney beans.  i also added one can of black beans.  Will definitely make again and again....

Granted, I made a few adjustments, but the result was by far the BEST chili I have ever had. Ever.  I used 1 can of tomato soup and 1 can of diced tomatoes instead of 2 cans of soup. I also added a can of green chiles and a can of corn. I used 1 can of regular kidney beans and 1 can of white kidney beans instead of just 2 cans of regular kidney beans. I also tossed in a dash of red cayenne pepper for just a little extra heat.   All that said, the most important change that I made, and the one that I'm sure made this the best chili I've ever had is that a used home-cooked smoked turkey meat. The flavor the turkey added from being slow-cooked in the smoker was incredible. If you can get access to a smoked turkey, you simply have to make this recipe using it. It's amazing!

This is excellant turkey chili! Five stars even without the changes I made of using 1 can of tomato soup instead of 2 and then add 1 can of diced tomato with chili (Rotel). I did add the onion to the turkey when browning and only used 1 can of kidney beans instead of the 2 called for. The Allspice is a nice touch too. I used red pepper flakes to taste. The spice and heat was perfect. Everyone I have shared this recipe with loves it too. This is now my favorite chili recipe and the only one I make. UPDATE** I now use 1 can of Rotel diced tomato with chili and 15 oz. can of tomato sauce with excellant results instead of using 2 cans of tomato soup. I add the beans (1 can kidney instead of 2 of 1 can of black beans) during the last hour of cooking too. Sometimes I feel funny about the added sugar in the tomato soup.

I would have never noticed the substitution of turkey vs. beef in this recipe, as the chili ends up being extremely rich and meaty. This was a great, no thought weeknight meal.

I made this for my family, which includes a very picky 8 year old and a husband who doesn't like beans and they both LOVED it! I cooked the onion with the ground turkey and seasoned it with salt, pepper, and garlic powder prior to putting in the crock pot. It made the turkey more flavorful. I will definitely make this again!

This chili was WONDERFUL.  I made it exactly as the recipe stated, and it turned out perfectly.  I was a little nervous, because I'm not a big turkey fan...but I couldn't even tell it was turkey.  Absolutely fantastic.

Great base recipe.  I made it once w/ beef and another time w/ turkey and both were very good.  I used 1 can rotel diced tomatoes w/chiles and 1 can tomatoe sauce b/c i had no soup.  I added about 1/2 c of water.  I used a whole onion and a gr. pepper.  You can play w/ the recipe based on what you have on hand.  The taste is 4 stars but I bumped it up to 5 stars b/c it is easy and healthy.

This is a staple recipe in my house. I make it once every few weeks for sure. My only changes: I add a package of taco seasoning plus pepper, jalapeno, garlic powder and a bit of chili seasoning and omit the rest of the spices.  I add a 15 oz can of diced tomatoes instead of the tomato soup.  It's a favorite, give it a whirl!

Made this for the guys in my family, and they all liked it. I made a few adjustments per the other "raters" :)  I used 1 can chopped tomatoes with chiles in place of one can of soup - 1 can white beans instead of red kidney, - 1 can of corn, - 1 (4oz) can green chiles - 1/2 can extra water - I cooked the onion with the meat. I also added some salt and pepper to taste as it cooked in the slow cooker. I like a little more spice:) All in all, pretty good chili recipe, and super easy to make.

I have made this twice now. It's fantastic! We use onion powder instead of onions, but I don't think it really matters. It's great with shredded cheese, sour cream and crumbled corn tortilla chips (like Tostitos).

This was awesome...I will definitely make this several times this winter.  I'm not a huge meat eater, so I only used 1/2 lb turkey, but my meat eating husband didn't complain of the lack of meat.  I didn't have tomato soup so I used some spaghetti sauce and some water...turned out fine.  I took the other suggestions and used a can of Rotel and only one can of kidney beans.

I took the reviewers advice and used only one can of tomato soup and added 1 1/2 cans of diced tomatoes.  I omitted the allspice and red pepper flakes but I added 4 chipotle and adobo sauce.  Kept it spicy.  Perfection!!

It was so easy and soooo good.  Added 3 cloves of garlic and 1/2 packet of taco seasoning, 1/2 cup of veg refried beans and a little beef broth.  The chili had a cheesy texture.  Everyone came back for seconds til it was all gone. :)

I was a bit disappointed here because this is exactly the type of thing I would love.  I don't like pieces of cooked onion, so I substitute either onion powder or juice in most things, and originally that was the only change I made.  It was just a basic chili, nothing special, but also seemed a little bland for a chili.  I then even tried adding more of the spices.  And no, it's not the turkey because I cook with turkey all the time (burgers, white chili, etc. -- and ironically it's usually me rating the turkey versions higher than other people).  There's just other turkey chili recipes I've found out there that are better.

This recipe was great! I had ground turkey that I needed to use and had never cooked with before so wasn't quite sure what to do with it. Then I found this recipe! I only used one can of tomato soup, one can light red kidney beans, and one can black beans. I did not drain the kidney beans, but did drain the black beans a little bit. My boyfriend and I are very picky about onion so instead of using one, I used onion powder. I also used sea salt, coarse black pepper, garlic powder, ground cumin, complete seasoning, chili powder, ground red pepper, crushed red pepper, whole oregano, and worcestershire sauce. I seasoned the turkey with poultry seasoning, as well as garlic powder, onion powder, sea salt and pepper before browning. The chili was very spicy to our liking, and delicious!!

This is the best chili recipe I've ever come across.  My husband and I really loved it and I've added it to my official recipe box.  The only thing I did differently was not put in the vegetable oil as suggested to cook the ground turkey in.  In my experience the turkey is moist enough to cook on its own.  Thank you for sharing this recipe!

This is a great recipe.  I used one big can of crushed tomatos and one can of stewed tomatoes instead of the tomato soup and it had a nice fresh tomato taste.  I did not find it spicy, in fact I added more chili powder to kick it up a notch.

I have made this five times and it is wonderful. I altered it a little per others reviews. I used one can of tomato soup, one can of kidney beans, one tablespoon of chili powder, added a can of tomatoes with chilies, and half a can of water.  If you like your chili really spicy keep the chili powder at two tbspns, but I had to tone it down for the kids. Keep it on low all day and you will love this easy and yummy chili!

I'm not a big spicy-food fan, so I used only 1 tablespoon of the chili powder and it came out spicy enough. I sauteed the onions with the ground turkey first, which made it more flavorful. I followed the other suggestions and used 1 can of tomato soup and 1 can of chopped tomatoes. I also added a can of corn and chopped up and green pepper to make it more colorful. It seemed a bit thick at first so I added 1/2 can of water - it came out delicious. It was my first time using my crock-pot (a wedding gift that had been in the box for 3 years), and it was such an easy recipe. I'll definately make this again!

Pretty darn good.  Quite spicy, but lacked depth of flavor.  We added a bit of ketchup and that helped.

Excellent recipe, but I must admit I changed it around a little.  I used a cooked, boneless breast (shredded) and added a can of green chilies.  It's a definite keeper at my house.  Thanks for sharing!

Used this recipe as a base, but really needed to add many more things to spice it to up to our taste with more heat and flavor.  That is why I just give it 3 *s.  Took some suggestions:  Used 1 can tomato soup and 2 cans of diced tomatoes with green chilis. Extra items we threw in:  garlic, jalapeno, a dash of curry, cocoa powder (yum!), little brown sugar.  It turned out delicious with a spicy finish.  Very easy and encourage people to add whatever other items they like. As I said, it is a good base recipe to start with.

My wife loves this chili. I recommend doubling the ingredients and mass-producing this chili for the freezer for nights when you're too tired to cook.

I echo a previous review... this is the BEST chili I've ever had!  I cannot keep enough of it in the house!  Recipe alteration: I cut the amount of chili powder in half and doubled the garlic.  I also substituted the can of black beans for a can of pinto (pink).  Mmmmm!

This chili was the best! I replaced the ground turkey with boca crumbles, and replaced one of the cans of tomato soup with a can of rotel and a small can of tomato paste. One of the cans of kidney beans I had were actually chili beans (which I think means they were like Ranch-style beans). I don't know if that made a difference but this chili was so great!! We added fritos and sour cream, and my 7 yr old ate 3 bowls! Not only did she like it, but my husband devoured enough of it on chili dogs that I had to fight for the last of it! The boca crumbles were almost indistinguishable from beef, and in our opinion better than turkey. I will be making this alot to get us thru the cold Minnesota winter, thanks for the great recipe!

Easy to make and very delicious!  I followed the advice of some other reviewers, and substituted one undrained can of diced tomatoes for one of the cans of soup.  I also added one soup can of water, and the end result consistency was just right.  I feel that it needs just a bit more zip, so next time I will add some Tabasco.  I served it with shredded sharp cheddar cheese on top--fantastic!

Liked the recipe overall.  Used 2 cans of Rotel instead of tomato soup.  Still would have liked there to be a little more of a kick.  Maybe use more red pepper flakes.

I tried this recipe when using my slow cooker for the first time and it was a major hit in my house.  The only change that I made was to substitute stew beef for the ground turkey.  I was feeding four picky eaters - including three toddlers - when I made this and everyone cleaned their bowls!

My whole family loved this recipe and my husband (Mr. picky) had 2nds!!  I didn't have any kidney beans in the pantry, so I made a few modifications. I added 1 can of Diced new potatoes, 1 can of Whole kernel sweet corn, 1 can of Black beans & half a cup of frozen Black eyed peas.  I know it sounds weird, but man was this awesome.  I also used a Family size can of Cambells Tomato soup.  Served with cornbread and this was the bomb!

This chili was super good! Just to kick it up even more, I added a few drops of Tabasco!  I will definitely be making this again. It was even better the next day when my husb and I took it for lunch! I didn't have the allspice, and it was still great.. excellent flavor!

This turkey chilli recipe is a keeper. The only thing I did different was I seasoned the ground turkey with a little garlic salt,ground pepper and Italian seasoning. Also in  addition to the recipe I added 1 can of chopped tomatoes with green chilies.

followed recipe except I used one can of thick tomato sauce and one can of diced tomatoes w/green chilies in place of soup. I also cut the chili powder in half as well as the red pepper flakes and it was perfectly hot and spicy -- anymore and it would be way too hot!  Used white kidney beans rather than red, and added fresh off the cob corn and some diced green and red bell peppers.  Served with a side of sour cream, and shredded cheese to put on top - it was so yummy!  Great with cornbread too!    Teenagers loved it too!

OH. MY GOODNESS. I made this for potluck and everyone who ate it said it was so delicious!!! I thought it wasn’t enough for the crowd so I made some modifications to bulk up the recipe on my way to work with it already prepared. I didn’t want to bring a half full slow cooker to the gluttony. This what I did: 1 can EACH 540ml dark red, black & white kidney beans, added 1 can 540ml diced tomatoes with chili seasoning, added 1 can 398ml added fire roasted salsa, added1 can 341ml peaches & cream corn, used 2 cans condensed tomato soup (284ml), added 1 can non-condensed creamy tomato soup (540ml), & increased garlic to 1tbsp because I love garlic. I use a 6qt oval slow cooker & it was full right to the top! After 4 hours on high it was glorious! I forgot the all spice & next time I’ll brown the turkey with the onions.

Thought I try this as the “Boss” wanted me to cut back on the red meats. Pretty well followed the recipe with the exception of tomato soup.  I used a 15oz can of diced tomatoes and about of 1/2 cup of tomatoe paste.  I also added 2 stalks diced celery along with a 1/2 of  a diced green pepper.  We had a can of spicy chili beans in the pantry and added that in lieu of the kidney beans. Through in a 4oz can of mild green chili’s cause she likes it a bit more spicy. (I’ll regret it later ??) set on the 8 hour lo temp. and set out the shredded cheddar, sour cream and a load of crackers.  A great way to watch the snow melt on a cool February afternoon!

Made this to the recipe and followed everyone’s suggestion, using a can of tomatoes with chiles in lieu of the second can of tomato soup. In the end I added spices to this, nearly tripled the garlic powder, added a dash of cinnamon (every good chilli recipe uses cinnamon), a dash of cumin and a couple scoops of spicy Herdez red salsa. The key to any tomato based recipe is to continue cooking until the taste is developed, so I probably cooked mine a couple hours longer than the recipe recommended and added salt to taste. It’s delicious and I’m sure it will get better as it marinates in the fridge.

Enjoyed this and couldn't tell it was turkey (not ground beef). Added a can of corn and substituted a can of diced tomatoes for one of the tomato soups. I only added 1 Tbl of chili powder, and a dash of red pepper flakes since I don't like too much spice. By the time 4 people had seconds, there wasn't much leftover.

It was good, but I'd cut the chilli powder to just 1 TBSP next time.  It was a bit too spicy.

This chili is amazing.  Personally, I wouldn't change a thing.  If you don't like spicy, leave out the red pepper flakes.  My husband ate three bowls and finished the rest for lunch the next day.  I can't wait to make this again!

It was a hit!  I made the adjustments as suggested and made some of my own...used 1 can kidney, 1 can white beans, 1 can black beans.  Added 1 cup chicken broth instead of water, browned the onions with the turkey.  1 can of diced tomatoes with green chili, jalapeno and 1 can tomato soup.  I also added corn.. served it with green onions, greek yogurt  instead of sour cream, shredded cheese and avocado.  Everyone loved it!!

I never even really liked Chili but now that I don't have to eat it with Kidney beans I love it!  I made it with 2 cans of beans, undrained (one mild and one medium spicy) and no black beans, and used 3 TBSP of Pampered Chef Chili seasoning and then just 1/2 of the garlic powder and red pepper flakes.  IT has a great kick to it but not so spicy you can't eat it.  My lips were feeling a little hot when I was finished!  Wish I had some sour cream, need to remember that for next time. Very good.

VERY GOOD !!! The only changes I made was to not pre-cook the ground turkey.  Instead I deleted the oil and place the raw turkey directly into the crock pot with the other ingredients.  I also used one can of soup, one can of chopped tomatoes with chilies, and one can of black beans and one can of kidney beans, both  undrained. Cooked on high for 4 hours and it came out great! Thanks for a really healthy flavorful easy chili recipe.

enjoyed it, and I used the two cans tomato soup!  added a can of tomato sauce, corn and mushrooms cause I  had them on hand. only cooked 6 hours on low, all the liquid was gone by then, I can see how a can of diced tomatoes might make it more liquidy and allow it to cook longer.

I love this recipe! So do the people I feed. It's very easy to make. It's flavorful, low fat, high in fiber & protein. Slow cooking is so nice. My  twist is that I add a can of white corn. It adds to the texture, flavor, and color for a different presentation for your chili.

Excellent!! I followed the advice of other cooks and replaced one can of tomato soup with a can of diced tomatoes. I also added a small can of water, some corn and diced peppers as I like veggies in my chili, and next time I might only use one can of kidney beans instead of 2 and add even more veggies. Everyone at the table liked this, including my 7 month old son!

So delicious and easy! We didn't have tomato soup so I substituted with a can of tomato sauce and a can of petite diced tomatoes. 

This is a perfect weeknight meal! Leftovers for lunch were delicious too

Great base recipe! My modifications: Browned the turkey with onion and two tablespoons of garlic, while adding Worcestershire sauce and assorted seasonings. Omitted soup and subbed two cans of diced tomatoes with green chiles. Added one diced  red and one green pepper. Also blended 4oz can of green chilies, can of chipotle peppers in adobo sauce, and 4oz can of jalapeno, and added. Halved the chili powder and red pepper flakes. Used one can of black beans, red beans, garbanzo beans, corn (all drained). Low for 8 hours. Served with shredded cheese, sour cream, and hrandmothers buttermilk cornbread (recipe on this site). Fantastic!

This was exactly what I was looking for! Great tasting chili minus the hassle. I followed other reviewers and in place of one can of tomato soup I subbed a can of diced tomatoes with chili's. I also cooked the onion (I used a whole onion) with the turkey prior to adding it to the crock pot. I didn't have allspice so I didn't use it. This is going to be my go to recipe! I didn't find it to be too spicy at all - but I love spicy so maybe that's just me. Thanks for sharing this recipe!

This chili is delicious and really easy to prep! In addition to the tomato sauce, I added diced tomatoes and another 1/2 of water. I added 1.5 times the suggested kidney beans, because I didn't have black beans. Rather than canned beans, I added dried beans. I also added 2 chopped up jalapenos and a few mushrooms. I cooked the onion with the meat before throwing them into the slow cooker. Make sure you cut up the ground turkey before cooking them or else you'll have huge chunks.

I have made this chili 4 or 5 times now.  I don't know why they specify draining the beans - I had to add 3 cups of broth to make the chili "wet" enough when I did that- so I don't anymore.  I also use tomato puree instead of soup (1 can) and follow someone else's suggestion to add the diced tomatoes and green peppers instead of the 2nd can of soup.  I, too, add a pkg of frozen corn.  A few slight modifications and a perfect, easy dinner loved by everyone except our vegetarian - though I'm considering making it without the meat and adding it when I serve so he can eat, too :D

I really liked this chili and will more likely make it again.  I am not a big fan of heat or spice, so I only did about 1/8 tsp of red pepper flakes and 1 Tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon of the chili powder. For the kidney beans I used one can each of pink and pinto beans. It was what I had and I just prefer them. My only real issue is the sodium level. I would definitey opt for low-sodium canned goods. As my crock-pot is an older model and I wanted to make sure the soup was done in the 3-4 hour range I did sauté the onions in the oil, until soft, then added the ground turkey to the pan. This was good garnished with a little shredded cheddar, and jalepenos, on top, as desired.

My go-to recipe for chili.  Made a few slight modifications.  I did not use tomato soup but diced tomatoes.  I did eliminate the cumin, which is just preference.  Have made this a few timws, last time I did two cans of black beans and it was a hit.  A lot of that is just preference.  Very easy and so tasty!

This recipe was great! I had almost all of the ingredients on hand and is the perfect amount of spice and flavor. Per other reviewers suggestion, I too replaced one can of soup with a mild can of tomatoes with green chilies. I also added half a cup of water and the consistency was perfect. I followed the rest of the recipe to a T. Cooked on high for the first hour then low for 6 hours and it was perfect. Other reviewers said that the 2 tablespoons of chili powder and full teaspoon of chili flakes was really spicy but I thought it was the perfect amount of heat without being overbearing. Definitely rotating this recipe into a regular dinner during the fall and winter seasons!

I love this recipe and have made it many times, always tweaking it a bit. I like to double the meat, dice a large onion, and add a can of pumpkin. You can't taste the pumpkin, but you get the nutrients. I have also successfully used diced or crushed tomatoes if I don't have tomato soup on hand. 

I also leave out the dried pepper flakes and half the chili powder because it's too spicy for me in it's original form. That's easy enough to add in the bowl of anybody who wants to zip it up.

My favorite thing to make in my slow-cooker, it's absolutely addictive! Like a lot of ppl, I also use 1-can of tomato soup and replace the 2nd can with diced tomatoes. I add chopped jalapeño peppers and what I have found to be the secret ingredient to making it perfect:Frank's Red Hot Sauce. The sauce adds a a delicious tangy, spicy flavor that makes the chili irresistible!

I liked the kick in it, however, it was too spicy for my husband and son.

I have been scouring the internet for hardy, flavorful, clean eating ideas. This fit the bill. I opted out of using the vegetable oil and just browned my ground turkey breast with a little bit of water in a non-stick skillet. My local grocery store didn't have low sodium tomato soup, and due to my diet restrictions "low sodium" is a must. I opted to use four 5.5oz cans of low sodium V8 vegetable juice. I also added a small can of diced, fire-roasted green chilies (drained and rinsed)and one fresh tomato(diced). Given how bland the turkey was, I added a tad more cumin and chili powder (to taste), along with some paprika. I will definitely be making this again!

I made this last night....AMAZING! I don't even like chili and I can't stop eating this! Has a small kick to it so that makes it that much better. I used a can of low sodium tomato parmesan soup. Next time I'll add the corn I think. Best chili I've tasted. :)

This has become my go-to for turkey chili, but I did make a couple of changes.  I use a 28 oz. can of crushed tomatoes instead of tomato soup.  I cook the onion with the ground turkey, too.  Sometimes I use white beans instead of black, but not always.  It freezes well and makes a great topping for a taco salad, too.

I have a pre-schooler, so I took the advice to skip the red pepper flakes and substitute a can of tomatoes with green chiles for one of the cans of tomato soup.  I also added half a soup can of water.  Cooked on high 4 hours, topped with grated cheddar, ditched my spoon and ate with Tostitos multi-grain scoops!  :)  Yum!  Two adults and a pre-schooler finished it off!!!

I made this chili as per the recipe. Next time I would like to try to substitute diced tomatoes totally for the tomato soup, not crazy about the taste it adds to it.  Also, I'm not sure if it's just because we're using turkey instead of ground beef, but it lacks a bit of flavor.  Also, this chili was so much better tasting after sitting in the fridge for a day or so.  Although I generally liked the chili, I will opt for a recipe with ground beef next time.

My notes: I had 2.5 lb of extra lean gr turkey. 
Fried 2 onions and 2 minced garlic cloves in olive oil after browning turkey. 
Added 1 28 oz can crushed tomatoes,1 19 oz can black beans, 1 28 oz can red kidney beans, 1 large can tomato sauce.
Only added 1.3 Tb chili, and the rest of the spices as suggested (not doubled). Put all in a pot heated on stove top then put in the oven at 350F for 3 hours then reduced heat to 325F for one hour (it may have been ok then but supper was still an hour away). Added 1 can of corn niblets before serving. 5 stars
My husband also loves the Chunky Chili Cornbread Cobbler made with ground beef found here http://www.canadianliving.com/food/chunky_chili_cornbread_cobbler.php  I make this one in the oven too.

January 2015
Repeat with only 1lb ground turkey. 1 can 19 oz can white beans, 1 19oz can black bean, 1 large can tomatoes, 1 can thick and rich tomato pasta sauce, spices as for single recipe. Cook on stove top for 15 min., then oven for 2 hours. Added frozen corn at the end. Delicious.
March 2015.  nice with ground chicken. I have made this several times since and it is always a hit at home and when I bring it to friends.

We all really loved this recipe.  I've made several turkey chilis before, but this is one of the better ones.  I think I liked it because of the tomato soup instead of tomatoes.  The chili was thick vs. watery.  Excellent.  Will definitely make again.

I loved this, but like others, I omitted the tomato soup. Instead I used 1 can no-sodium diced tomatoes, 1 can Rotel tomatoes w/ chiles and added 3/4 can of water. Only used 2 cans of beans (pinto & black) - the perfect bean-to-meat ratio unless you really like a lot of beans. I also only added 1 TBSP plus 1/4 tsp chili powder and omitted the pepper flakes. I seasoned with cayenne pepper and sea salt to taste after cooking (am a bit of a spice wimp). Used one small onion and browned with the meat and fresh garlic. Been eating this for the last few days, and I love every bite!! Probably the best chili I have ever had (so glad I left out the kidney beans since I don't care a lot for them!)

Great tasting chili! I made the "unhealthy" version of this by substituting 90% lean ground beef and Italian pork sausage for the turkey. I browned the meat with the onion, and a teaspoon of garlic and Worcestershire sauce.
Also, like others, I wasn't so sure about the tomato soup. So, in lieu of the tomato soup, I used 8oz can of tomato paste; 15oz can of tomato sauce; 15oz can of diced tomatoes, and a small can of diced tomatoes with chillies....like my chili with a bit more tomato zing. 
Got great reviews from the folks we had over for the game and chili too! they all said it was pretty spicy though (i did reduce the amount of red pepper flakes...still pretty spicy tho). Next time, I'll probably reduce that a bit more. I like it spicy, but that's just me. If making for others, it's best to keep the spice down, and let them dice it up themselves with hot sauce and/or red pepper if they wish.
Finally, I also added some frozen corn to the slow cooker. Added nice color, texture and taste!

This was my first time marking a chili and it turned out amazing!! I added fresh mushrooms and celery to the recipe. I also substituted I can of tomato soup for a can of diced tomatoes for some extra texture. I will definitely make this chili again.

May replace my previous favorite chili recipe!  Didn't use all the spice though, to make it kid friendly.  Used the full chili powder, but reduced red pepper flakes to 1/4 teaspoon.  Also replaced one can of tomato soup with plain diced tomatoes.  Next time I will try the tomatoes with green chiles as others have suggested (just didn't have any on hand).  Used only one can of kidney beans with the black beans, but compensenated with 20 oz. of turkey instead of the 16 oz in the recipe.  I used about a half a soup can of water, but next time I will use at least a full can, as I had to add some water at the end of cooking time (we're used to more soup-y chili).  My 7 year old had 3 bowls of this!

Wth several modifications, based on the first review I read which was very positive with changes.
For those of us who do not like hot food, my rendition has the tiniest bite, but it is NOT hot.
I used one can of condensed tomato soup, adding one can of water and one can of crushed tomatoes.
I left in the 4oz of green chilies; they are a nice addition without adding too much hot.  I also browned
the onions with the browning of the ground turkey.  My chili powder is quite hot, so I added one, not two tbls of chili powder and did not add the red pepper flakes. Red kidney beans are not my favorite, so I used two cans of white (northern) beans, one can of black beans and added one can of corn.

I cooked the chili in a slow cooker for 8 hours on low.  To make it more Weight Watchers' friendly,
I served the chili with plain Greek yogurt on top, instead of sour cream.  It was perfect!

No more prepared chili seasoning for me.  This is awesome.  I used one 24oz can of diced tomatoes instead of soup, I didn't drain the beans, and I accidentally used 1 whole Tbsp of cumin.  Served it over quinoa.  Delicious!  Thanks Laura!

I have come to rely on Boilermaker Tailgate Chili (from this site), which I make with turkey, as my go to chili to get rave reviews from those I am feeding.  However, I came across this easy slow cooker recipe and decided to give it a try for a less labor intensive meal.  It was actually excellent.  I took cues from other reviewers and used 1 can tomato soup and 1 can Rotel tomatoes, as well as a can of chopped green chilies.  I also added 1/2 can of water.  I used 1 can kidney beans, 1 can pinto beans and 1 can black beans.  My only complaint doing it this way was there was not enough liquid.  Next time, I will probably use 2 cans tomato soup and 1 can Rotel tomatoes.  My son complained that it had too many beans, but he is not a bean fan.  I thought this was  a great, easy chili recipe.

I adapted the recipe after reading some of the reviews: only one can of kidney beans, added a can of corn (isn't that corn kernels in the photo?), used a large can of black beans, and I forgot to buy tom. soup so I added a large can of tomatoes.  Oh, and cut the amount of chili powder in half.

I LOVE this recipe!  It is the only chili that I make ever since I first made this about 3 years ago!  My sister asked for the recipe and now it's also her go to recipe for chili! It doesn't taste like a turkey chili AT ALL!  I make a few changes, just for my taste.  I use 1 can tomato soup and 1 can diced tomatoes with chillies. And only 1/2 teaspoon of the red pepper flakes. I also leave out the oil and just cook the turkey with a quick spray of Pam. So delicious and not at all bad for you!

I typically hate turkey. I won't make anything with turkey, but my sister swore that this did not taste like turkey. So I tried it.  This was a great recipe and it didn't taste like turkey at all. The whole family loved it.

I've been making this recipe as written for years and it comes out perfect everytime. The only thing I don't add is allspice because I never have it and it doesn't seem worth buying, for just a pinch. This is a very thick chili - which is how I like it. It does have quite a bit of spice but some some cheese and sour cream cool it down perfectly.  Overall this is an excellent turkey chili!

When my husband discovered we were having this for dinner he complained because he is a big fan of my typical ground beef chili. After eating, he "guessed it was ok" as he went back for seconds, and polished off the remainder the next day! I kept with all the spices and used Ro-tel tomatoes instead of tomato soup after reading other reviews, and I felt this was too much spice. Next time, I think I will keep true to the recipe as it is probably fine the way it is stated.

Such a good base! however I did use one can diced tomatoes and a small tin of diced green chilies in loo of tomato sauce. I also cooked the onion with the turkey in the skillet. Made the blue corn corn bread to go with it and my boyfriend LOVED IT! Thanks

This turned into a "what Christina has on hand" chili and using this as a base is definitely a go. I thought it would be too spicy for my toddler, so I halved the chili powder and omitted the flakes. I still felt like it was on the hot side; hence, the 4 star rating. I also didn't use tomato soup (none on hand) and used 2 cans of diced tomatoes instead. I made it vegetarian by using Boca Crumbles in lieu of turkey and threw in a tuscan blend of dry beans/seasoning vs. kidney (again, all I had.) I cooked on high for 4 hours and thought the flavor was wonderful. :)

This was very good but had to make the following changes hence, 4 stars.  I used 1 can of kidney and 1 can of pinto.  cooked the onions first and added only 1 can of tomato soup but added 2 cans of diced tomatoes.

Yum! This has seemed a bit shy on liquid to me as well so I use a 28oz can of diced tomatoes in addition to the tomato soup (And sometime I substitute chile sauce OR enchilada sauce for the soup). I also add about half a bag of frozen corn plus a can of green chiles. I've made this with other lean meats (buffalo and venison) and it is always a hit!

This turkey chili was easy and tasted great! It was a tad spicy for my taste buds, but I know to just modify the amount of chili powder next batch.  I will be making this again and do recommend the recipe!!

We use this recipe almost weekly and absolutely love the chili! We sautee the onion and turkey with the pepper before putting it in the crockpot. We use a 32 oz. container of organic, low sodium soup - everything else according to the recipe. Even our pickiest eater loves the result. We especially like that it is so very healthy and delicious!

I had never made chili before. This was a super-easy recipe that turned out great. I did substitute one can of canned tomatoes for one of the cans of soup. My slow cooker also runs hot, so I reduced the time to 4 hours on low or two on hot, and it still turned out great. My husband and I, not great chili fans in the past, both loved it, and so does our 1-year-old daughter. Our extremely picky 3-year-old is taking more persuading but I think in the end he will also come to like it. We plan to introduce this into our regular 2-week rotation of meals. Thanks for providing the recipe!

This chili turned out really good.  It didn't end up tasting like like tomato soup at all.  I substituted a can of tomato soup for fire roasted tomatoes.  I would definitely make this one again!

This was really good, easy, and not spicy for those that don't like heat. I took advice from others and subbed 1 can of corn and 1 can of navy beans (white) for the kidney beans. I also subbed a can of diced tomatoes for one on the soup cans.

Five stars for being 1) full of flavor, 2) very easy, and 3) slow-cooker friendly. Whole family raved. Eyeballed the chili powder but it had more kick than my 3 year old can handle, so next time will reduce it by a bit. Changes: 2 pounds turkey, 2 cans black beans, 2 cans corn, 2 cans fire roasted tomatos, 1 small can diced chiles (mild), 1/2 can water.

Cannot say enough great things about this recipe. I use to think with chili you had to top it off with cheese,onions and sour cream. But this one is amazing all on its own.

This recipe was DELICIOUS.  I took some of the other reviewers advice and swapped out the red pepper flakes and added a can of green chiles.  I also swapped a can of diced tomatoes for one of the cans of soup and added a can of corn.  My mother, who is a very vocal critic, LOVED it.  I served it over brown rice for a very hearty and delicious meal.

Very good chili!  I don't even miss the ground beef!  I did as some other reviewers suggested and I put in 1 can of tomato soup and 2 cans of diced tomatoes.  I did not have any allspice but it still tastes great!  I do think next time I will cut the red pepper flakes back a bit.  I put the finished product into small, lunch sized containers.  I froze a few so whenever I don't have time to make lunch, I'll just grab a chili on my way out the door.

I enjoyed the chili, but it was just too many beans.  I couldn't even taste the turkey. I will try again, but I will have just one can of kidney beans and  either another can of tomato soup or a can of diced tomatoes.

Amazing! I followed the recipes but I added a cup of water because I thought it looked too thick but I should have known that the slow cooker thins it out. Another thing that I added was DelMonte's corn (drained). This gave it a sweet taste. Next time, I'm sure it will turn out perfect!

Loved this chili! I followed suggestions and omitted the soup, added mexican corn, diced tomatoes, tomato sauce and green chiles. I also added a dash of cinnamon and about a Tbls or two of brown sugar. Turned out great!

Tried this for the first time with some of my own tweaks. Instead of the tomato soup, I used a can of diced tomato and a can of spicy enchilada sauce.  It came out a little thicker but it was perfect with some tortilla chips.  I'm definitely doing this one again!

Lots of changes! I changed it to 12 servings. I omitted the tomato soup and instead used 1 rotel and 2 cans of stewed tomatoes (i chopped them) AND to make up for the liquid i poured in a whole heavy beer (shock top). I did not have any sort of chili or red pepper flakes so i used 2 teaspoons of hot sauce (didnt want it too hot). Also, I was out of cumin, so i added some steak seasoning (has cumin in it), no allspice, so i used a pinch of nutmeg and a pinch of cinnamon. No garlic Powder, so i mixed half minced garlic and half garlic salt. Overall the taste came out great! I dont have anything to compare it to but i am surprised it turned out even though i was missing so much stuff! :)

Love this recipe! Excellent flavor! TO further cut down on the salt, I switched out one can of tomato soup for a can of no-salt added chopped tomatoes.  I also rinsed the beans well to reduce the salt there too. I will definitely make this one again!

This recipe was super delicious. I've never made chili before, so I was a little nervous going in. 

We had a massive chili feed, and I doubled the recipe to fill the stomachs of 8 extremely hungry people. My chili was well received, and I personally found it one of the most delicious chilis I've ever eaten, let alone MADE. 

Instead of using the 2 cans of tomato soup, however (afraid the chili would come out soupy), I substituted with two 8 oz cans of tomato sauce and 1 can of diced tomatoes. I also added a little dash of basil and marjoram. It came out flavorful and tender after cooking a few hours.

I will definitely make this again!

Yum! Everyone in my family loved this. From 65 to 6 years old they were at the table asking if we could have dinner early. They ate the leftovers for lunch and dinner the next day and left NONE for me. I used red white and black beans for color. As toppings crackers sour cream and shredded cheese toned it down and minced peppers heated it up. Good stuff and not expensive to make.

This was the hit  of a party one evening!!  I used beef instead of turkey;  omitted the allspice and vegetable oil; and added another teaspoon of the red pepper flakes, a few dashes of hot sauce and seasoning.  I don't know if it would have had the kick we like without the extra heat, but it was great!

Excellent! Browned the meat and onion the night before. Used 1 can Healthy Request tomato, 1 can Rotel with chiles, 1 can cannelini beans, 1 small can corn, 1/2 can water. Mixed the spices the night before and dumped it all in the crock in the morning. Cooked on low for 6 hrs.

This chili was excellent & so simple.  I did reduce the amount of red pepper flakes & used cayenne pepper because that's what I had.  I added all the other spices along with a can of black beans, red kidney beans, diced tomatoes & only 1 can of tomato soup.  My hubby who is "picky" asked me to save him the leftovers.  From now on this is how I will make my chili.

Here is is 2011 and the recipe is alive and well..i like swapping out the diced tomatoes and chillies for tomato soup and leaving the heat to the discretion of the eater. I was laughed at when i submitted turkey chilli in a chilli contest,only to be vindicated later when i came into fashion..great recipe,simple and tasty

AMAZING!!! My husband & our friends said it was the best chili they'd ever had... I added an extra pound of meat, used the full onion, a can of corn, and substituted one of the cans of soup for a can of diced tomatoes with chiles... Served with corn bread, fat free sour cream & fat free cheese.  My mother inlaw and my mother asked for the recipe the next day  :)

This recipe is excellent! I picked it because it didn't have peppers in it, because of the great reviews, and because of its simplicity. I didn't change anything and it was excellent.  I did use beans with no salt added and could not find low sodium tomato soup! Thank you so much for a great recipe. We will put this in our regular meal rotation.

Awesome and easy to make chili!  I used some of the suggestions, including changing one can of tomato soup to a can of tomatoes and green chilis, as well as browing the onions with the turkey.  Also, since my boyfriend doesn't like many kinds of beans, I used two cans of chick peas.  And the result was delicious!  He could not get enough, and had the chili for breakfast and dinner the next day.  If I had a bigger crock pot I would have doubled the recipe!

Great recipe! I will definitely be making it again. I suggest substituting diced tomatoes with chili peppers for a more authentic taste. No need for the red pepper flakes either-the chili powder already gives it more than enough zest.

It was pretty simple and we had it in the pot in 20mins (we were a bit rushed for time.) Instead of Tomato soup we used the diced tomatoes tomato paste but also added cayenne along with brown sugar.  Turned out super tasty and easy to freeze/reheat.

This was great and so easy!  We lost power this morning so I could not make it in the slow cooker.  I just browned the meat and threw it in a pot with all the ingredients.  I added a can of corn, green pepper, a whole onion (instead of half), and 2 soup cans of chicken broth.  It was delicious!!

I really enjoyed this chili. I did make a few modifications. (1) I used one can of beer in place of one can of soup (2) I added corn to this dish for extra flavor.  I will be making this dish again for it was really good. Next time however, I will add more peppers for I like my chili on the spicy side.

This was darn good! I also used a can of tomatos in place of one of the cans of soup. My husband  doesn't like "chunky," so I put the tomato and onion in the food processor to make it smooth. I used one can kidney beans, one can cannellini beans, and one can black beans - very festive! I added the spices as written (minus the allspice). It was just a tiny bit spicy. Next time, I will increase the chili powder and red pepper, to give it some kick. We both loved this, and my husband even had leftovers for breakfast (blech). This recipe is going into our monthly meal rotation!

Super easy to make and better than most turkey chili I've made. I didn't think it was too hot at all, even with the recommended amount of chile powder and the addition of a jalapeno. It could probably use even more kick if you like your chili with some heat. I also per other reviewers subbed chopped tomatoes for the soup. Definitely will make again!

This is great, basic chili. Like other posters, I made some adjustments after the 1st batch (and now my BF can't get enough of it), but as it's posted, I think this is a good recipe that will suit most adult tastes. I use the tomato soup as written, change the beans to 1 can ea. of black, pinto and light kidney, and add a little corn. I use 2-1/2 Tbs. chili powder and only 1/2 tsp. red pepper flakes, and fresh garlic in place of powder (2-3 cloves). I am "generous" with the 1/2 Tbs. cumin, which I grind myself, and with the pinch of allspice. I serve it with freshly chopped tomatoes, sharp cheddar and a little dollop of sour cream (I love my dairy!), but it's still delicious without if you want to keep the fat down. If you like the chili not so thick, the large 26-oz can of Campbell's tomato soup is a good option (I compared labels and found that regular Campbell's has lower salt than the Healthy Choice, etc. at our market).

When you make too many changes to a recipe you morph it into an entirely new recipe. That said, these are the changes I made to this recipe: I took the advice of many people who have reviewed this and omitted the soup altogether (I made this recipe earlier this winter with the soup and it tasted sorta like spaghettios) and used 2 cans diced tomatoes and 4 oz can of diced green chilis. I also used 1 can black beans and 2 cans chili beans. I added 4 oz water since it was quite thick as I was mixing it all up in the crock pot--which went on low for 8 hrs. The spices are terrific---you mess with the spices too much and you really have a different recipe than the original. This recipe is just fabulous, quite spicy, but if you don't like spicy then what are you making chili for?

Excellent!  The only thing that I added was a can of corn.  I did not put the hot pepper seeds in.  I also only used 1 tbls of chilli powder.  Most of my family does not like spicy food, so I add the heat to my dish.  This was very easy to make and very satisfying.

Yum, yum, yum! I, too, did not use tomato soup, we don't like canned tomato soup at all.  Instead I used 2 cans of diced tomatoes and 1 can of stewed tomatoes, I crushed everything with my hand before adding to the mixture.  We used chicken instead of turkey because its what we had.  The spices are great, very well balanced, and it would be easy to make more or less spicy to one's taste.  I would not decrease the cumin, it add a nice depth of flavor and isn't really spicy just smoky. Thanks for sharing this!!

This is best the second day.  Also,I only used one can of tomato sauce, and that got rid of the "canned soup" taste that I didn't care for.  Skipped red pepper flakes because of my family preferences.  However, my family absolutely LOVED my modified version.  Highly recommend the modified recipe!!

This is a fantastic recipe and soo delicious.  We do an entire medium onion and one green pepper.  We also double the garlic powder and add about 3/4 of a can more of tomato soup.  It is soooo delicious and has  a nice kick to it.

I followed the directions to a "T" and this was by far the weirdest tasting recipe I've ever made.  Very different.  Hubby dumped some bbq sauce in his and really liked it.  If I make this again I will substitute one can of the t-soup for one can of stewed tomatoes. I like tomato soup but didn't care for strong hint of it in this recipe. Becareful on the crockpot though.  I cooked it one day, & stuck in the fridge.  The next day when I got home from one job, I plugged it in and came home from my second job about six/seven hours later & it was burned.  The newer crockpots just cook hotter.  Not sure if I'll make again but it was a change.

This chili was really tasty...we made it for dinner last night.  I read the reviews prior to making and followed a few of the suggestions.  First, I substituted 2 cans of diced tomatoes with their juices for the tomato soup.  However, I found it a little dry so I also added one can of tomato sauce.  It turned out with a really nice chili consistancy. I also added a half bag of frozen corn.  Very easy and delicious.  We will definitely do this again soon.

This is great chili.  It won a chili cook off and no one guessed it was turkey.  I made changes based on the suggestions from other reviewers.  It is part of the rotation now!

As written this is a mediocre recipe in my opinion, it needs a little tweaking.  It had a weird flavor and was rather dry for chili.  If I make this again I would use stewed tomatoes in place of the tomato soup - not a fan of the soup's flavor.  I would also probably omit the all spice.

Adding corn was a must do. When the sweetness of the corn combined with the spicy heat of the chili it resulted in a an amazing melody of flavor.

For my first chili ever...this was a great recipe. Like the other reviews,I did replace one can of tomato soup with one can diced tomatoes with green chiles. Next time I make this recipe, I would probably add some spice. It wasn't to spicy...which is great for some people like me. But my husband loves spicy foods.

This is a great recipe. I adapted in the following way to give it an extra kick: Add a third can of kidney beans, a can of tomatoes with green chilies and INSTEAD of the chili powder, use 1 (one) Tablespoon of cayenne powder. Just for kicks, I also added a can of corn.

I made this for a potluck at work...lunch started at 11 and my entire crockpot was empty by 10:30...It was fabulous!  I used 2 cans of chili maters and 2 fresh chopped jalapenos.  I also used 1 can of kidney and 1 can of black beans...none of this was drained!!  It turned out in the perfect consistency and was absolutely delicous!!  I also used 2 lbs of turkey meat!

Definitely quick and easy! I made a few subs - didn't have 2 cans of tomato soup (just one), so I subbed tomato paste and diced tomatoes. I added chili beans, green pepper, and 2 jalapeno peppers - nice and spicy! VERY IMPORTANT to spray crock pot with Pam - I didn't and it is still soaking...

This has been one of my faves since I found it about 2 yrs ago.  It does not have to be done in a crockpot, just simmer on the stove or refrigerate overnight to get the flavors blended well.  I sometimes use 2 cans of any combo of black, kidney,garbonzo beans,whatever I have on hand, 1 can soup and 1 can diced fire roasted tomatoes to mix it up or sometimes add corn.   As for heat, I add extra hot sauce or sliced jalapenos.   Great toppings are cheese, diced onion, sour cream, salsa, avocado bits, cilantro...be creative.

This recipe was so easy and delicious.  I made the following changes - I browned the turkey meat with the onion before slow cooking - I replaced the soup with 1 can of chopped tomatoes with chiles  - I added a can of corn Other than that I followed the recipe exactly.  It is not too spicy - you could even add more spice or a can of jalepenos if you like spicy.  Next time I will try to add butternut squash...I love the combo.

This makes a great meal!  I do make a couple of changes, just my preference.  I omit the beans and add a 28oz can of diced tomatoes.  Then when it's almost finished, I add 1 1/2 cups uncooked macaroni to the chili.  Love it!

this is exactly what it says- Quick, and no to mention tasty! i have been making all kinds of chili in the slow cooker forever and in my opinion, it's the only way to make it! the smokey taste it gets from the cumin is delicious and i love putting black beans in my chili. definitely a keeper, thanks Laura!

I too used a can of diced chili tomatoes instead of the 2nd can of tomato soup.  This recipe calls or alot of beans.  I did not use all the beans it calls for.  My family doesn't care for beans.  I went with half the seasoning and adjusted for taste.

This was a great recipe! I used 1 can of black beans and 1 can of pintos and one can of corn. I took others suggestions and used 1 can of diced tomatoes with 2 chili peppers and 1 can of tomato soup. Served with rolls and had leftovers for lunch!

Loved it! Has a little kick to it, and could even make it a little spicier with more chili powder too!

LOVED this.  This is the 2nd time I've made it, only this time I doubled it.  I used 2 1/2 lbs of ground turkey, and doubled everything except for beans (this time) I used 2 cans of red kidney beans, 1 can of black beans, and 1 can of white beans.  I also took others suggestions replacing one can of Rotel diced tomatoes w/ chili (medium heat/spice) for one of the tomato soup cans, I added a can of stewed tomatoes in place of the other tomato soup can, and added corn.  It's perfect with Fritos scoops!

I made this for my family and they loved it.  NOw I make it at least once a month.  My sister stopped by one night and now wants to come to dinner whenever I make this.  
I do use less chili powder and peppers (about 1/2 as much).  We're a low spice family.

I used canned diced tomatoes instead of the tomato soup.  It was really, really good.  I usually get sick of chili by the time the batch is done, but this one kept me wanting more.

Yum. I replaced of one can of kidney beans for white beans and cajun spice instead of chili powder.  I also didn't have all spice. Still came out great.  Second time I made it I added a can of corn and green chilis.  Really yummy.. my husband wants me to enter it in the chili cook off at his work.. we'll see how it goes.

This is a great recipe!  I made a few modifications:
I used 1 can garbanzo beans (chick peas)
1 can red kidney
1 can black beans
I forgot the tomato soup so instead I used a 28 oz can of diced tomatoes.
My husband loved it!

This came out great! I made a few changes as well. I read the other reviews and substituted one can of diced tomatoes with chile's for one can of soup. I also added frozen corn, and a little bit of chicken broth so it wasn't too thick. Before serving I crunched up some fritos for the bottom and put shredded cheese and sour cream on the top. Yum!!!!

Good solid easy chili recipe.  I used canned (undrained) tomatoes instead of soup; and I had no black beans but I used pinto, kidney, and garbanzo.  The flavors were great.  Might add a bit more liquid next time - but thanks for a great recipe!

I just made this recipe tonight, and it was good!  I changed some things, though, based on other reviews.

*used one can of tomato soup and one can Ro-Tel mild tomatoes with green chilies
*instead of 2 Tbsp. chili powder, I used 1 Tbsp plus 2 tsp. chili powder and 1 tsp. chipotle chili powder. (Do NOT substitute chipotle c.p. for regular c.p. in recipes. It's much, much stronger!)

DH loved the flavor and the amount of heat, but thought the ratio of meat to beans was uneven; next time I make this I'll stick with just one can of kidney beans and a can of black beans.

Overall, very good.  I'll try it again!

Love the name..."quick" slow cooker chili.  Yummy dish!

Followed some of the other suggestions such as: instead of 2 cans of tomato soup, used 1 can of soup & 1 can of tomatoes with green peppers (aka Rotel).  Used 1 cup of frozen chopped onion instead of 1/2 a fresh onion b/c I keep frozen on hand.  Also added about 2 cups of frozen corn for more substance & color.  Instead of garlic powder, I just used minced garlic, which I keep in my fridge.

After making this a few times, I've found that the vegetable oil is NOT necessary when cooking the turkey, even when using 93/7 fat content.  Just spray a little Pam and cook.  One of the things I love about this recipe is that it's so much healther than most.  Why not make it even more so?  Incredibly good, and easy!  I did take cues from other reviewers and use a can of rotel tomatoes in place of one of the cans of soup.  I also used a can of white beans in place of one of the kidney beans.  Thanks, Laura!!!

My son (5yrs old) and I made this for the first time today, what an amazing chili!  It is the perfect blend of spice and chili!  You would never know it is turkey, a nice thick chili!  The only thing I did to modify the recipe was removed 1 can of kidney beans.  I would be worried that there would be too many beans in it had I added the 2nd can.  I would also recommend doubling the recipe if you are serving this to more than 3 people, everyone is going to want seconds and the original recipe would not be enough to feed everyone seconds.  I will be making this all winter!!!

My family loves this recipe. I have made it many times, I try different beans each time, always good.  The only thing I change because it lacks liquid is I add spicy bloody mary mix to make it the consistency we prefer (about 3/4 cup) and it also gives it a little extra kick. Top with shredded cheese and my favorite crushed cheez-its. Delicious.

this was really good!  I'm a Cincinnati fan, so after browning the turkey, I ground it to a finer consistency in the food processor.  Also, added a dash of cinnamon to my cup.  No cinnamon for the pot.  My hubby's not a Cincinncati fan.  It's great either way!

I fixed this chili for a party I was having. It received rave reviews. My daughter wanted the recipe, and she didn't even know I made it with ground turkey. She said, "Oh, and it's healthy too! I did add 1 small can of tomato sauce, and used 1 can of kidney beans, 1 can of pinto beans, and 1 can of cannellini beans instead. I will make this again!

This was really good! I did change it a little like others did by using only one can of soup and a can of diced tomatoes with chiles.  I also replaced the pepper flakes with 2 seeded, chopped jalapeno peppers, which gave it a nice spicy tang.  It was super easy to throw together and very yummy! Recommended!

I followed the advice of others and subbed a can of diced tomatoes for one of the cans soup and used only one can of kidney beans. 1 T of chili powder is plenty if you like your chili mild to medium in spice. This recipe really only served four and was so easy and yummy that I would recommend doubling if you want to feed more.

Unbelievable. My kids and husband do not like chili, but they loved this. They said it was the best chili the had ever had, and they went back for seconds.

I used about 1/4 of the recommended chili powder - about 1/2 T, and no red pepper flakes. Also could not find low sodium tomato soup, so used regular.

Thanks Laura!

Laura, this is great chili! We love lots of beans in our chili and this really had that. I used two cans of Healthy Request Tomato soup and thought it worked great, no canned soup taste. I did add more onion and some chopped bell pepper because we had plenty of both. I left out the hot pepper flakes and just put those on the dinner table. That way the chili wasn't too spicy for my teenagers. Served this with shredded cheddar jack cheese, sour cream and tortilla chips. A great big thank you for this keeper recipe!

I'm pregnant and have had almost no energy to do anything, including cooking, one of my favorite things.  I decided to break out my slow cooker and start using it, so we at least have some hot, home-cooked meals!  I don't normally like to cook with canned soup, but this chili was actually very good, quick to put together and smelled great while cooking.  All together it took less than 15 minutes to put together.  Will make again, if I need a tasty and fast meal.  The only thing I changed was I added 4 oz. of canned mushrooms and diced up a green pepper.

Amazingly easy and delicious. My husband and young daughter usually do not like chili, but they both ate this up and loved it!  I left out the onions and red pepper flakes and I used canned diced tomatoes with roasted garlic and onions instead of soup.  I also added 5-6 ounces of tomato sauce, a half tablespoon of sugar and an extra dash of cinnamon.  This is a new family favorite.  Thanks!!

I amnot a big chili fan, but I loved this chili!  Everyone went back for seconds.  I used 1 can of tomato soup and a can of petite diced tomato.  I will definately put this on my rotation.

My new favorite chili recipe. I am so glad I finally found a recipe so I can stop using the chili seasoning packets that add up to a lot of money. All the other recipes    I have tried didn't hit the spot. I took this to work and it was gone in no time flat. People were asking "what happened to the chili I didn't get any!" The only thing I did different was to decrease the red pepper flakes as others suggested and use 1 can tomatoes with green chilies and one can diced tomatoes since I didn't have any tomato soup. The second time around I tried it with one can soup and one can tomatoes and I didn't like it that way as much. Thanks for the great recipe.

So here is why I am giving this recipe 5 stars...I don't even like chili, but this was AWESOME! I only tried the recipe because I am always looking for simple recipes to make in my crockpot & my husband is a huge chili fan. The recipe was so simple, everything just gets tossed into the crockpot and bam 7 hours later I have delicious chili! I didn't have allspice so I left that out, and I didn't have kidney beans. Even without these 2 ingrediants the chili was fab! I served it with fresh bread and topped each bowl of chili with some chedder jack cheese. I will definitly be making this again and again. Thanks for the great recipe!!

A-1 chili as it was--and healthy!  Changes include leaving out the veg oil--turkey browns just fine on its own.  Added a grated carrot in there for a little extra somethin'.  I left this to simmer for two and a half hours on the lowest setting (stirring occasionally) in a large pot as I don't have a slow cooker.  Great stuff!

This recipe is delicious!  I made it for some friends from England.  They had never had chili before and they loved it.  I used half tomato soup and half petite diced tomatoes.  I also used one less can of beans and thought that was plenty.  This will be my staple chili recipe from now on!

This is a great recipe and very easy to put together. I pull less chilli powder because I wanted the kids to try it. They tried it but still found it spicy. My husband loved it but wanted it to be spicier! In any case it is a great reciped to serve for a get together and very simple to make.

Excellent recipe! I followed it exactly, and then added some corn. It was spicy, thick, and extremely easy to make.  My boyfriend said it was "good" after the first bite, and for this man that means it was excellent.  Thanks!

This was great.  I might add a tbls. of brown sugar next time.  This was just enough for the 5 of us, with boys only having one small serving.  I would double it for company.  Great with moterey jack cheese and a dollop of Sour Cream.

I really enjoyed this, especially since it was healthier than my regular chili. I followed the advice of many reviewers, subbing one can of diced tomatoes for soup, and cut the red pepper flakes in half. I also added a small can of diced green chiles and one can of water so it wouldn't be too thick. I browned the turkey in olive oil and added chopped garlic. I like spicy, but I cut it down for my son. I just added hot sauce to my own bowl, topped with shredded cheese and put a corn muffin on top. Very enjoyable.

Excellent! I didn't think I'd like ground turkey in chili.  I usually use ground beef.  But this recipe was very good!  Great flavor.  This recipe will replace my current chili recipe.  This is a keeper!

This is a definite make-again recipe! Delicious and a perfect consistency. We added one diced chipotle for extra heat and one soup can full of water to make it a little less thick.

I made this recipie for myself a few days ago, and it was really good! I did make a few alterations, I used 2 cans of diced tomatoes with the liquid instead of tomato soup, and added double the cumin and some coriander too for a smoky flavor. I also added a couple of shots of extra hot hot sauce, because my fiancee and I are spicy fans. I really really enjoyed it and I will be making this recipie again!

I've made this chili with ground turkey and lean ground beef.  Have to say I prefer the beef.  I left out the black beans, added a can of drained diced tomatoes, and topped with sour cream and shredded cheddar.  Perfect for a cold winter night!

My family loves this chili! It's become a staple at big get-togethers. Like other reviewers suggested, I use one can of tomato soup and 1 can of diced tomatoes. The spices are great. I do change up the beans - mostly depending on what I have on hand. It works well with pinto, black, and kidney (or all three!).

This turned out great and I will be making it again. I made it on Christmas eve for my in laws but I used real ground beef. I also did not use the can of soup and replaced it with a can of tomatoes and some tomato paste.
My in laws always add two tablespoons of peanut butter to their chili and surprisingly this made it taste much creamier and really added to the flavor.

I've made this several times and I love it!  I'm not a chili pro though.  The only thing I change is to add about a cup of beef broth to the meat when browning it to give it some beef flavor.  I drain it off before putting in the cooker.

Mmmm! I used 99% lean ground turkey which I cooked with the chopped onion in the skillet. I upped all the spices a little and added mushrooms and corn. I also took the advice of other reviewers and used 1 can of soup and 1 can of crushed tomatoes. Sooo yummy!

Very good! I did take other reviewer's advice and trade one can of soup for a can of pureed tomatoes.  Also, I add a can of water, because my family likes their chili a little less thick.  Otherwise, the seasonings are great (my husband can't believe it's not a pack from the store!) and we love mixing in different kinds of beans! Thanks!

For the time it takes to prepare this chili and the amount 9or lack of ingredients) it takes to compile this it is a 5 star recipe. If you are going to a chili cookoff I would be more inclined to try to make something that has more spices 9and takes longer) but for every day eating you have no reason to go any further. It has a little kick so you might want to cut back a little if you have little ones. Other than that no complaints here!

I love this recipe. I use it all the time and it is always a hit. I generally add a little ginger as it is my favorite spice. I also replace one of the cans of soup with a can of tomatoes. And I add a can of diced jalepenos to spice it up. Sometimes I don't have the all spice when I make it and I don't taste much of a difference without it. Generally speaking I like to play with the spices, using the recipe as a guideline or starting point. It is a great recipe that leaves some room to play!

Wonderful!  I ended up adding more cumin and chili pepper to make it spicy, but it was great to start with.  My husband didn't even realize it was Turkey chili!

This was great and so easy to put together for a busy, chilly day. The only thing I added was 1/2 cup of water. The spices were perfect for us. Don't forget the toppings!

First snow of the season in Colorado and I'm let down by this chili.  

I did as others suggested and sub'd one can of soup for diced tomatoes with green chilies.  Did everything as the recipe called for otherwise.  After letting it stew for 2 hours it was very bland.  I started playing.  I ended up adding minced garlic along with extra cumin, chili and cayanne pepper.  To my surprise I had a couple of anaheim peppers so i sliced and diced and threw those in.

This chili is better the longer it sits.  The next day we had the leftovers and it was pretty darn tasty.  Maybe adding the spices during the last hour would help :/ 

Regardless, I wouldn't call this spicy.

This was delicious, low in fat compared to most chilis, easy to make, and my husband (who is so picky) ate every last drop and his friends were begging for a bowl and ate the rest of it! Very very good.

I was expecting this chili to be great because of all the good reviews, but unfortunantly for my husband and I it did not live up to our expectations. We cooked it in the slow cooker for 7 hours and it still tasted a bit bland. After adding cheese and sour cream on top it tasted a little better, but we still found something else to have for dinner, I would recommend using another recipe.

The Chili was so GOOD!!!  I changed the recipe a little.  I added a half of can of water ( it seemed way to think and added about a 1/2 tablespoon more of the red pepper flakes for a little hotter taste.  This is a keeper.  My husband loved it.

Made this last night and my husband loved it. I did as some others suggested and used one can of tomato soup and one can of tomatoes (zesty chili style). I did add a little water because it was so thick and had to add more spice to it but it was a great start! Thank you!

This was the best chili I've ever had! I can't wait to make a double batch next time to freeze leftovers (as there certainly weren't any leftovers this time!). I followed the recipe exactly, except to add one cup of tomato sauce. I rinsed the beans to help with the sodium. I also only used one can of Kidney beans, and pink beans instead of black beans. Greatest chili ever!

Delish! I love it! I didn't use all the beans and backed off a little on the spices since I have toddlers, but the tomato soup was a new chili ingredient for me and I loved it.

This recipe is easy & delicious. Some ideas to spice/vege it up--instead of the soup, use 2 cans of Rotele + 1 tablespoon cumin + a couple of chopped green peppers.

Very tasty. I only used one can of kidney beans and also used the other suggestions of one can tomato soup and one can diced tomatoes. I omitted the black beans (forgot to buy them).

This chili was decent, although most certainly not the best I've ever had.  I was worried about the spices, because people were saying that they are too hot.  Therefore, I cut down on them.  In the end though, it was a little bland so I added more chili powder, some curry and few drops of habanero sauce.  I also tried a little coco.  I will add some more cumin next.  This gets better over time.  :O).  Also, I rinsed my beans to get some of the salt off.

I double batched this and served it straight from the crock pot at a winter party we had.  Lots of chili lovers were there and they all loved this recipe!  I had toppings of shredded cheese and sour cream available. Very pleasant taste and warms you up in winter.  Freezes well.  I would highly recommend this recipe!

This is the best chili my husband and I have ever tasted!  I also sub'd 1 can of died tomatoes w/ chilis instead on 1 can of tomato soup.  I also added a small can of tomato sauce.  I also doubled the red pepper b/c I liked a little more kick.  This will stay in my "loop" forever!

Great turkey chili recipe. So easy to put together. Will be making this again. I did omit added salt because I couldn't find low sodium tomato soup. Also cut the red pepper flakes to 1/2 tsp. to suit my families taste.

My husband and I love this recipe. I like to serve it with fresh french bread. It is so easy to just put it in the crockpot before work and come home to the wonderful smell of chili. The only change I make is adding more chili powder at the end to add some more spice. This is always a hit when having dinner guests.

This was excellent, we made it for Superbowl Sunday.  I did follow the other reviews and substituted a can of soup with diced tomatoes. I also substituted a can of kidney bean for hot and spicy chili beans (which I didn't drain).  It had a great flavor and was not too thick.

I have been craving chili for about a month now so when I saw this recipe I just had to make it.  I am so glad that I did!:)  I only used one can of tomoato soup I replaced the other can with diced tomatoes instead.  I did not have any allspice but I did not miss it at all.  This is a great recipe, thanks for sharing!:)

This chili is soooo good!  I have a family a five to feed and everyone came back for seconds!  Needless to say there was not a bit left over.  This is a keeper!

excellent recipe. I did wind up making it with (eek!) ground sirloin and adding quite a bit more chili powder, few carrots finely chopped and celery. We typically wrap it up like a burrito and enjoy for days!

I love making this chili as a change from the heavier, more fattening chili recipes I make!  You really can't even tell it's made with turkey, since there are so many seasonings and spices.  Would recommend this one to anyone looking for chili alternatives!!!  Thank you!

Delicious! Everyone loved it. I did use 1 can of soup and 1 can of fire roasted diced tomatoes with green chiles. I couldn't find my garlic powder, so I put in 2 cloves of fresh minced garlic. Served it over Fritos and sprinkled with cheese. I'll be making this often.

This was a good base recipe.  I don't eat meat but during certain times of the year there are comfort foods I enjoy.  I used Morningstar Vegetarian crumble, which can be found in the frozen food section.  I aslo for some reason didn't have a lot of the spices on hand so I added a can of diced green chiles to add flavor.  The other thing is I used a can of diced tomatoes in addition to the can of tomato soup.

Excellent.  Couldn't tell it was turkey..  I used 1 can diced tomatoes in place of a 2nd tomato soup.  I also added some water because some reviewers said it was too thick.
Made this again with pinto beans instead of black beans and it was equally delicious.  One of my favorite recipes...

I halved this recipe, but used one whole can of pinto beans, one can of black beans and two cans of diced tomatoes in place of the soup.  I also added chipotle paste for some kick and some frozen corn.  This was tastey and knowing how healthy it is makde it taste even better.  Thanks for the great recipe!  Made this with the "golden sweet cornbread" from this site.

This is the best chili I have ever made.  I've been looking for the perfect blend of spices to satisfy my pallate and this is definitely it.  I've gotten rid of all the other chili recipes in my box....  Definitely making this over and over again!!

This was a good, traditional chili. That being said, I'm not a huge fan of traditional chili, so although this was perfectly fine, I would definitely doctor it up next time (add a pureed chipotle pepper, add some basil or oregano, etc). I will say that it definitely needs more liquid -- I added a whole can of chicken broth and was very glad I did -- chili was the perfect consistency with it after cooking all night, but would have been a dried out mess without it.

This was quite good. I didn't miss the ground beef, like I normally do in a ground turkey recipe. Just enough spice for my sensitive tounge. I didn't have red pepper flakes, so I used ground cayenne pepper instead.

This chili was EXCELLENT! My husband raved about it and even ate leftovers the next couple of days with no complaints.  I couldn't find red pepper flakes at the grocery store, so I left that out and added some canned jalapenos and a little more chili powder (we likeo ur food spicy).

Excellent chili!  I used ground beef instead of turkey and used a can of rotel and a can of diced petite tomatoes instead of tomato soup.  I also added jalapeno peppers and extra red pepper flakes for added spice and it turned out perfectly.  Loved it!  Will make again and again.......Yummy!

This chili was delicious!  However, according to the recipe the chili should cook for 8 hours in slow cook, but I only cooked it for 6.5 hours because the beans were starting to burn.  Also, when I served the chili on the plates, I added shredded cheddar cheese and a little bit of onion.  It gave it even a better taste!

Very good, simple recipe. Fairly mild with the spice as the recipe calls for, I double the red pepper and add some cayenne for extra heat.

I love this  recipe! This chili isn’t very spicy, but the flavor is delicious!  Easy to spice it  up a bit to your own taste.  I also substitute a can of chopped tomatoes or tomatoes with green chilis instead of one can of tomato soup.  Corn is a nice addition too.

This is a great recipe for turkey chili. I have used it as a basis for many years now. I like others do some individual tweaking. Instead of tomato soup I used fire roasted tomatoes. I also use two cans of green chili and tomatoes. three cans black beans (my fave), 2 cans each dark and light kidney beans. I also use two pounds of ground chili since we like our chili chunky. I obviously make this is large quantity so I use the serving option in the app to adjust the quantity of spice. I do also add about a teaspoon of turmeric and a teaspoon of smoked paprika and it adds to the flavor. thanks for sharing this recipe! it's a keeper!

I used two pounds of ground turkey and one package of
whole mushrooms.
The chili tasted ok, just not spicy hot like chili should be.

I just increased the Chili powder by 1/2 and doubled the red pepper flakes.  Each person also added hot sauce to their serving. My family loves spicy food. This was a delicious recipe as I am not a fan of chili, but I will eat this any day.

My family loved this! I did make quite a few changes though. I couldn't find a dairy free tomato soup so used 3/4 can of tomato sauce and 1 can of fire roasted tomatoes. I also added about 1 tbs of cocoa powder. Our new favorite chili recipe!!

This is delicious and easy. I also took advice from previous reviews instead of two cans of tomato I used one can of tomato soup one can of stewed tomatoes and one can of Ro tel mild diced tomato and green chilies. I also added two cans of super sweet corn. light red kidney beans,black beans and Cannellini beans. And 2 pounds of turkey . I had to make more than six servings. I did not add water. I will make this again!

I made one change - did not add the jalapeno as I was concerned about how spicy/hot it might get. It turned out great and I would absolutely make it again!

This is great, very spicy, the way I like chili.  I made it in my Instant Pot and it was great.  I am not a fan of turkey but needed to use it and this was perfect for me.  I followed the other readers ideas of using the Rotel tomatoes but kept both cans of soup, and added a bell pepper cause I needed to use it too.  Definitely a keeper

This is a very simple and delicious recipe to make. I've made it with turkey, beef, bison, and venison and it turned out great every time. I think the next time I'm going to try elk.
 I wouldn't be a proper reviewer if I didn't make some changes to fit my own taste. lol I like a chunky, hearty chili. So this is what I changed, instead of 1 lb of meat. I use 1.5 lb and that works out better for me. Instead of the tomato soup, I use one 28-oz can of Red Gold whole peeled tomatoes. I dump them in and then I use my wooden spoon to crush them against the side of the pot. Some may choose to add some water, but I don't. Other than that, I keep everything the same.
*Pro tip: If your chili comes out too soupy. Use a potato masher to crush up some of the beans, but not all. This will thicken up your chili pretty good. Enjoy

This recipe is true to the description. I was amazed at how tasty and satisfying it is.  Due to pantry constraints, I used tomato soup and cream of chicken soup and one can of pinto beans.I added a teaspoon of Italian herbs as well. My son-in-law walked straight to the crockpot saying, "What's in here?" because the kitchen smelled so good! With toppings this is a complete meal for anyone and pairs well with a green salad for a really full meal.

Sooo good.  I too used diced, no salt added tomatoes in place of soup, added in chopped green chiles, some low sodium chicken stock and a pinch of smoked sweet paprika.
BUT  I served it over riced cauliflower, with a little sour cream a d shredded cheddar - will not serve any other way.

This is hands down the most boring/bland chili I've ever made: it tastes like it came from a can.  

I made it exactly as written and would never ever make it again.

This chili came out amazing! Some of my family said it was the best they'd ever had! :D I did make a couple alterations after reading some of the reviews. I took the advice of many people and I substituted 1 can of condensed tomato soup for 1 can of Ro*tel diced tomatoes and chiles and nixed the red pepper for the kids. It still had a mild kick to it. I also added a little bit of frozen corn at the end and 1/2 can of water.

My 8 yr old daughter and I made this together. She normally will not eat much  chili- and she begged for leftovers when this was done! We did substitute the tomato soup for Canned diced oregano and basil tomatoes. It was easy to set up and I would recommend it on a Sunday so you have easy leftovers for the beginning of the week.

I did make some changes after reading other reviews.  I omitted the tomato soup and used two cans of diced tomatoes with Chile.  Also added a can of tomato sauce and can of water, which I won’t add next time I make this just to see the difference.  I used a pound and 1/2 of ground turkey.  Also omitted the black beans and used a 30oz can of kidney beans and 30 oz can of pinto beans.  Used the spices exactly as the recipe called for.  Everyone thought they were good, even my executive chef son.  I will make again.

It turned out pretty good just a little sweeter than I expected. Think the creamed corn added too much sweetness. Will make it again but use drained  whole corn kernels instead of creamed.  Only substitution I made was I replaced the tomato soup with one can of rotel tomatos and one can of diced tomatos.  Cooked it on the stove top. Ready in just about an hour.

Excellent recipe.  Easy to make and quick clean up.  I took the suggestion of another reviewer and eliminated the soup and substituted two cans of tomatoes with green chilies, reduced the amount of chile powder by a tablespoon or so and added a drained can of corn.  I, too, found one can of kidney beans and a can of black beans sufficient.  I suspect there are a bunch of variations that will work and will try some the next time I make it.  I made it in my 4 quart slow cooker; it served 4 people with only a small amount leftover.  I thought it was spicy but my guests added a bunch more chile power and a lot of Tabasco.  To each his own.....

Did not come out as creamy or juicy as I expected; it was more beans than anything else….   Somewhat lacking in flavour.

I did not like this chili version. The tomato soup makes it sweet. If you like sweet chili, then follow this recipe as is. If I make it again, I’ll use diced tomatoes in lieu of the soup.

Thought it was wonderful.  Did use tomato soup.  Will omit next time and try with two cans of tomatoes with chile.  Did use a can of mild chilies also.  We are pansies when it comes to things being too  hot.  However, cheese/sour cream help if it is too hot.   Did have enough for two additional meals in freezer. 

Couple of 'Wisdom'...Seniors.

Quick and easy, very good, I did tone down the spice in the cooker and added some to the turkey in the pan. Helped the turkey stand out a bit from the beans. I also added a can of white beans in lieu of a second can of red. Will make again and keep playing.

Excellent!!  However, I must say that I took the advice of one lady that suggested that the red pepper be cut back.  I cut it down to maybe a heaping 1/4tsp and it was perfect.  Will definitely make again.  Hubby love it and so did I!!!

I used 3 cans of black beans, no kidney beans on hand, I also used ground red pepper rather than the flakes was what I had on hand as well. I also used ground chicken. I cooked it on high for 4 hours, however it burnt on the bottom and edges even though I sprayed the whole pot with cooking spray. My family found it a little too spicy, but we all ate it even with hot mouths! We would make it again!

Great Chili! I used two cans diced tomatoes and one can tomato sauce and the texture was perfect for my taste. Perfectly seasoned. I garnished mine with Greek yogurt and sliced fresh jalapeños. Enjoy!

I followed the recipe until I got to the tomato soup which I used one can of and added a jar of my mother’s homemade garden tomato juice and it was lovely!

LOVE this recipe! This is the only chili recipe I ever make. The only change I made was instead of tomato soup. I use 2 cans of petite diced tomatoes, one regular one jalapeño & habanero. Gives it a little bit of spice. I also add a can of tomato paste, only because I like some tomato taste & thickness to my chili.

This has been my base recipe for chili for years.  I've always done what others suggested and then done my own thing with it.  If I want to go super spicy I add Adobe along with ghost pepper chili powder.

Chilli is all watery and soupy. Has no flavor. All I did different was use double portions. What did I do wrong?

I'm not usually a huge chili fan but my husband likes it and this recipe was pretty good. I don't like kidney beans so used pinto beans instead. Also substituted canned tomato sauce and paste for the tomato soup. I cut the chili powder in half and subbed a chipotle pepper in adobo for the red pepper flakes. It had some heat but it was tasty with gluten-free cornbread and fresh cilantro on top!

This recipe is super simple and easy to make! I added a bit more chili powder and spices myself but overall pretty delicious! I've made this twice so far and the 2nd time I made it I replaced the tomato soup with tomato paste and crushed tomatoes then seasoned it myself.

I made this chili last night for today and it was easy to make; my son visited me too and offered to taste it to let me know if I needed to add more seasoning. He exakned to me this meal was on point and nothing was needed to improve the flavor. He decided to make it a meal where he ate seconds and taken some of it home to eat.

This is my #1 favorite chili recipe. It is 4 stars as written and doesn't need changes but it did play with it a bit after the first time.  With some small changes it's 5 plus stars! I subbed one can of tomato soup for diced tomatoes and added about 2 tbspn of semi sweet chocolate chips! I also add one can of corn, chopped carrots, and celery to bulk it up with more veggies.  Take one can of kidney beans out to lower the carbs a little too. It's outstanding! You don't miss the red meat at all with all this flavor. Thanks for The great recipe!

Solid start to the recipe. I made the standard changes mentioned by others - diced tomatoes & chili for one of the cans of soup, added water, etc. My family loved it. We left out the red pepper flakes, and my kids devoured it.

I added some diced Olive Oil & Garlic tomatoes in place of one of the cans of tomato soup, substituted garbanzo beans for the kidney beans, used fajita seasoning in place of the chili powder that I didn't have and added a good handful of frozen corn as well. It came out YUMMY!! Thanks for this quick & versatile recipe - the printed version is staying in my recipe box of all stars.

This turned out great. My family loved it, including my 4 year old. I did substitute pinto beans for one can of kidney for preference. I also used 1 can of mild rotel instead of tomato soup and added  a cup of water. I omitted the red pepper flakes for the children, but I bed it would have been good.

This is one of my favorite recipes for chili - ever! Someone brought me a gift basket of the ingredients when I was on maternity leave - everything but the turkey and spices. It is so easy, and so good. I hate people that alter recipes and then share like they know everything, but I do make alterations on this one (lol - know it all!), and I really like the results. I use the family sized tomato soup and also add 1/2 of a large can of tomato sauce to make it have more liquid. I also add a few dashes of cinnamon. I love the cinnamon with my chili spices and I even do it in tacos and burgers when I make the seasoning now. 
When I got the gift basket, my friend also threw in a pouch of corn bread mix that you just add water to, which was great for me being that I was on maternity leave and all. 
I often do that now. I pack up all the ingredients except for the turkey and spices and throw in a box or bag of corn bread. It's such a sweet idea and the people I've shared it with love the thought and the chili!!!

I made this yesterday on a rainy day and the family loved it. It did need a little salt, but only in the individual bowls. Other than that, it tasted great with a little sour cream on top and some Fritos scoops to eat with. I will be keeping this recipe to make again.

Easy, filling and the balance of spices is just right. I thought the tomato soup would make it watery, and that it would need more to bulk it up, but that was the case.

This was "okay", although I think next time I will increase the amount of meat by about 25-50% and possibly reduce the cans of beans by 1. I also added some extra water to the slow cooker as it was super thick.

This is delicious! I followed the advice of others and did only one can of tomato soup. Added a can of diced green chilies and a can of diced tomato. I also cooked the onion and turkey together, seasoning with salt and a dash of allspice. Cooked on high for four hours.

Doubled the recipe and couldn't fit in all the beans into the slow cooker, but it still worked very well.

excellent recipe, i only made one modification because of preference and that was i used tomato sauce instead of soup, i also did 2lbs so doubled everything, it came very good.  8 hours on slow, it was worth waiting for.

It was really easy to find all the ingredients in the store and to prepare. I followed the directions given and It tasted great! I did put some Italian seasoning in it and it worked well the other flavors. I will definitely be making it again soon!

Very good recipe! I’ve made it about 5 times since I’ve found it 2 months ago. Only changes I make is 2 cans diced tomatoes w/onions, I get 3 different types of beans for variation And I  put 1/4 cup of salsa in too for some kick. I’ve made it with Turkey, pork, chicken and beef and it tasted great every time.

So good! I cooked the turkey with the onion and half of the spices before adding everything to the slow cooker, replaced one can of soup with one can of diced tomatoes, and also added a can of corn and a couple of habeneros. Came out at just the right amount of spicy, but it was a bit on the dry side so I think I'll add a can of tomato sauce next time.

I loved this. I only tweaked some of the ingredients because I’m picky. I only used 1 can of each kind of beans and only 1 tablespoon of the chili powder. I did not put pepper or red pepper flakes because I do not like my food too spicy. To get my kids to eat it I put the chili on soft tortillas (like soft tacos) and they loved it.

This was a great recipe and made for an excellent chili! It was a great for my one meal a day when the breakfast and lunch are meal replacements. It provided a lot of protein which works great with my diet. Also provides for great leftovers, as I usually eat it everyday until it runs out. I try and make it in bulk every time, therefore I have my meal set for the next week or two.  For more spice, I added extra chili flakes and tomatoes with greens chiles. 


For an extra tang I added lemon juice on top for each serving (optional) !!!

Wow this was easy and very tasty. Spicy but that is how we like it!  I didn't drain one can of Kidney beans and it was perfect. I try to do low sodium and I don't add any salt.  Family and friends LOVED it.

This was so easy and so good. I followed others advise and only used one can of tomato soup and one of kidney beans. I added a can of diced tomato and enough water to barely cover the chili. I added all the seasonings but I didn’t have cumin. I did though have a bottle of taco seasoning which coincidentally had the same seasonings for this recipe, so i added two tablespoons of it. I added a bit of salt to taste as well. I didn’t have time to cook in a crock pot so I made it all on the stove and it was ready so fast! I’m definitely making this again. Oh and I made a box of cornbread from the 99 cent store with honey butter and topped the chili with sour cream. Mmmhmmm.

I made this in my Instant Pot - cooking the ground turkey on the saute function then using the slow cooker mode.  I cooked mine on high for 4 hours.  It was fantastic and so simple.  I'll be making this a lot!

This is a great simple chili, and especially helpful for me because I was running out of ideas for ground turkey. The batch is small, so if you are using a large crockpot, consider doubling it, as my crockpot, on low, dried it out a bit by the time cook time was up. (This could also potentially be my equipment, hence the five stars still!)

Bomb.com. This stuff is amazing! Pretty cheap to make too, which is great because I’m broke. The ingredients make for a good amount of food, I had two bowls, my roommate had one, and there’s still some left!

Turned out great and even pleased my picky-eater that "dislikes" ground turkey. Only modification was a few dashes of hickory liquid smoke.

Scale back the chilli powder and pepper flakes to reduce the heat if needed. I did not. This was quite hearty and delicious.

i just felt the turkey meat cooked in slow cooker was like mush.  the is a Simple Turkey Chili recipe on this site that I have been using for years and I love.  I just think cooking in the slow cooker  was the difference.

I only did one can of black beans and one can of Kidney beans both drained. Added one can of diced tomato (undrained). One can tomato soup + half can of water. Adobo generously on top. Very good recipe!!!

I've made this one several times and it always turns out so good! A little more seasoning and meat is all I add.

For some reason I felt like it tasted a little "gritty" to me. Probably my fault for not stirring ingredients enough, but since I never had this problem before, I just used another recipe I found here. Sorry.

This recipe has high reviews. I was very disappointed. If it weren't for the cheddar and chips at the end, it would taste very bland. There are better chili recipes out there. 

Chili is definitely much tastier with beef; i won't use turkey again.

This recipe is a great starter recipe, but needs some modifications. I liked the use of tomato soup, but I added some bell pepper, minced garlic and about 5 oz beer. I also felt there were too  many kidney beans for the portion of ground turkey. So I would use only one can, or add more ground turkey.

Excellent recipe. Entire family loved it including kids. I made changes as others suggested: one can Rotel instead of one soup can. Only used 2 cans beans. Will definitely make this again.

I usually make Chili using my own recipe which is more involved using more ingredients,  But this recipe is so delicious and so easy and quick to make. I think I will use this recipe from now on. Super yummy!

This is my go to chili recipe - I've probably made it about ten times over the last two years. I follow some of the advice from the comments and use two cans of diced tomatoes instead of tomato soup (usually I pick whichever flavored ones look good - fire roasted, garlic, etc).  And I always add a can of whole corn kernels. This is also a very pretty chili - lots of different colors. I approximately follow the spice recommendations, but at this point, its more of a shake it until it looks (and tastes) good kind of a thing.

This was sooo delicious! I substituted 1 of the cans of tomato soup for a can of petite diced tomatoes as other suggested. I added a half can of water, 1 can of summer crisp corn. Also, I cooked the onions in the ground turkey and added double the chili powder and lastly I added ketchup.

Good basic go-to recipe! I did however make it differently, by mistake, but it was great. I didn't have soup on hand, so substituted a small can of tomato sauce. I accidentally opened 2 cans of black beans, but still added the 2 cans of rinsed kidney beans.  I used 3 cans of chopped petite roasted tomatoes, so I guess without trying I made a lot of changes. I did add chili powder and more cumin. But hey, this was the basic recipe I used and it turned out great! Thanks for submitting!

This was really good! I subbed in tomato/red pepper soup and added half of a mini can of tomato paste to make my soup more tomato-y. Also didn't have allspice so added a dash of cinnamon. Also added 2 cans of black beans and 1 can of kidney. It was really good! Will definitely make again :).

Really great chili, I found the spices to be just enough. As others have mentioned, one can of tomato soup and one can of tomato with chilies is the perfect balance. I add another pound of meat just because, and also some corn and fresh jalapenos. A winter staple!

We loved this. So easy in the Crock-Pot. I skipped the separate browning step and just threw everything in the Crock-Pot at the same time. As other recommended, I used one can of tomato soup and one can of diced tomatoes. I also added a small can of diced jalapenos for extra spice. Loved the mix of flavors. It was a great consistency - not soupy, but not too thick. Will definitely make it again.

Loved the recipe... I am a spice wimp, so it was a little too hot for my tastebuds. If you’re sensitive to heat, wouldn’t add as much chili powder or red pepper flake. Otherwise, very good recipe!

I love this recipe.  It's easy to make.  And it's perfect for when you have a schedule that doesn't allow you to be home to make this.  The only thing that I recommend is that when you brown the turkey, use some seasoning to help give it some more flavor.  I use garlic salt and pepper.

This has become a favorite meal in my house. Easy recipe, quick to make, excellent flavor. Perfect for those busy days or just a cold day. My kids and husband love it. We like a meaty chili so we use 2 pounds of turkey instead of 1, serve it with corn bread and it’s perfect.

This was certainly an easy meal to make! This was my 1st time making chili and it was pretty good. Of course I changed and/or added some things. I bought Italian seasoned turkey for extra flavor and added diced tomatoes and a smidge of sugar. The spice levels are there for my family and the flavor taste good for everyone

I’m not in to spicy food so I left out the spice and kept the flavor. It still tasted like chili! I also substituted one can of tomato soup for a can of stewed tomatoes. I like the chunkiness of the tomato, but wasn’t as soupy as chili traditionally is, but still really yummy. I think next time I’ll keep the 2 cans of tomato soup and add the stewed tomatoes. My family really enjoyed it nonetheless!

I used half ground turkey, half lean ground beef, browned together with the onions. And one of the cans of soup I used was a southwestern corn, potato, and pepper soup. Turned out AMAZING! My favorite chili so far!

This was a delicious recipe to use my leftover wild turkey that we first grilled with a spicy dry rub! Wow! Serve with buttermilk cornbread. Outstanding!

This has become my go to chili recipe. It's easy, and it never disappoints. I only use two can of beans instead of the additional can of black beans, but that's the only modification I make.

I really liked it but I think next time I'll add a can of undrained diced tomatoes. It was really thick so I threw in about a cup of water before we ate it. Because my family is wimpy, I don't use red pepper flakes and I also cut the chili powder to 1.5 tbs. Will definitely make it again but probably go up to 2 tbs because it was a little strong in the tomato taste.

This recipe is pretty classic Tex Mex chili and there are many good things about it. Its easy and quick and its forgiving. I've made this at least 4-5 times. The husband loves it. If you don't have turkey--use ground beef . If you don't like or don't have one type of bean--just use almost any substitute (I wouldn't do baked beans or black eyed peas but anything else is up for grabs). Ive added corn or left it out, if guesstimated spices with a heavy hand its its been great. This is a keeper!

Loved this chili. It was easy to make, delicious and reheats well. I did add a can of corn and chopped green chilies, but I’m sure it would be just as good without those additions. Will make this again this fall and winter.

Excellent recipe, though the first two times I've made this; it'd been rather runny because I made the tomato soup according to the instructions on the can instead of just using the tomato soup base. I also added sriracha and hot sauce to give this chili a nice kick since it wasn't really all that spicy. Overall though, it is a good recipe and I enjoy making the spice combinations with real spices instead of those pre-made super salty chili packets.

Ive made this twice in a row now, only i used beef instead of turkey cause the supermarket had no ground turkey or chicken. I used only 1 can of kidney beans cause there seemed like it had enough with 1 can of each type of bean. Also i used 2 cans of "Creamy" tomato soup.  Really is a great recipe. Next time ill try to find ground turkey.

Also i ate this with home made bread from a recipe i got from this community. Cant stress enough how much my whole family LOVED this meal.

I reduced the amount of chili to 1 1/2 tbs purely because the people I was making for don't like spicy food too much. Apart from that, it was probably the tastier chili I had made in a long time.

I added a can of tomatoes with chili peppers and a lot more chili powder and still felt it wasn't hot enough. If you like spicy, add twice the chili powered at least. I would also add some corn, and top it with cilantro, avocado and cheese. Then you have a really tasty dinner!

This is an all time favorite of my boyfriend and I! This recipe is so easy to put together in the crock pot, and the result tastes way too good for its simplicity. I add a little smoked paprika along with the seasonings, and serve with a generous amount of cilantro, cheese, and sour cream.

Ok normally I hate when ppl change a ton and give something 5 stars but I've been making this recipe for years and I've made it exactly as written and it was great or with a ton of substitutions and it was equally great. Over the years I've made changes and taken other reviewers advice to get it how I like it. I use canned dice tomatoes in place of the tomato soup. I use 3 cans with green chilis or else if I'm using ones without green chili I add a small can of green chili by itself.  I used to use half soup but on occasions when I had no tomato soup ( I make homemade so I rarely keep canned on hand) I have used all tomatoes and everyone likes it even better as it taste less like canned chili. I omit the red pepper and instead leave hot sauce out for those who like spicy to add to their individual serving so its heat friendly for all. I add fresh garlic or garlic powder or a combo, whatever I have on hand, and I use a variety of beans. I always use 3 cans but rarely the same 3. I've found any canned beans, white, black or red work fine. If I'm shopping for this recipe I tend to go with 1 black, 1 dark and 1 light red though I've used seasoned beans of all kinds, even cajun seasoned black eyed peas once in a pinch. It always turns out great. That's why even with my tweaks this still rates 5 stars.

I've made this multiple times. It's the perfect thing to make while I'm at work all day then bring leftovers for lunch during the week.  I have a very small slow cooker. I think 1.6 quart. So I have to scale back for most recipes. I used 1 lb ground turkey. Then 1 can of beans (whatever I have), and 1 can tomato sauce, and then whatever vegetable I have around. I have used sweet potato, and most recently I threw in half a bag of of frozen corn. The longer it stays in the slow cooker the better.

My family loves this turkey chili!  I've made this exact recipe many times over the past few years.  I make it once or twice a month during the winter.   It is always great!  I follow the recipe pretty closely, maybe adding a few more onions because we love onions in my house.  

I cook up the ground turkey and put all the ingredients into the slow cooker pot the night before, so all I have to do in the morning is pull it out of the fridge and plug it in!  So easy!

It makes enough for dinner (family of 3), then a few servings for lunches for my husband to take to work the next few days.  I made this for a Superbowl party, and it was great, I also made it for a work pot luck and everyone loved it.  They couldn't even tell it was turkey instead of beef.  It is a hit!  Bake up some cornbread to go along with it, and it's one tasty dinner!

Love this recipe. I've made it several times. I use 1 can of rotel, along with 1 can soup. I also use a taco seasoning for extra flavor and tri-colored beans. AMAZING.

Super quick and easy chili that's always a crowd pleaser. I used tomato sauce with tomato paste instead of condensed tomato soup (to keep it GF), and I cut the chili powder and red chili flakes WAY down (1/2 T chili powder and a pinch of flakes). 
This freezes and reheats well, if you're looking for make ahead meals.

Amazing chili. Followed a couple changes that everyone already did - that work plus some other personal stuff. I used  1 can diced tomatoes instead of the soup. Used olive oil instead of vegetable oil. I added a can full of water.  Then added both cans of beans (pinto and black - just what i had). I only used 2 cans of beans instead of 3 to make it feel more "meaty". Was perfect for my smaller family of 4. Used chipotle powder instead of red pepper flakes (personal favorite) and to add to the smokiness added a tsp of smoked sweet paprika. Cooked it on low on the stove for about 90 minutes.  Great consistency. Super easy. Dump stir. Simmer.

I have made this with turkey, and beef, and both are good. I only use one can of kidney beans and one black beans. I have used tomato soup, and diced tomatoes, and like the diced tomatoes better. I also cut the chili in half because I dont like it to spicy. Great easy recipe!

This was the first recipe I made in our new slow cooker, and it was simple to make and tasty to eat. For our cooker, 7 hours on low was definitely enough, as I checked it at that point and it was starting to burn. 

We omitted the onion but otherwise followed the recipe as written. The red pepper flakes provided plenty of heat but not too much. Otherwise, the flavor was maybe a tiny bit lacking.

This is my go to chilli recipe!  My family loves it!  I sometimes prepare it with ground turkey and other times with ground beef.  I do what Heather suggested:  1 can chopped tomatoes with chiles in place of one can of tomato soup.  I use black beans and kidney beans, I add one can of chopped jalepenos and frozen corn.  I also add celery, carrots or what ever vegetables I can sneak in there and no matter what, my family loves it!  Thanks Laura for this recipe!

My husband has been bugging me to make chili.. Keep in mind I have NEVER made chili in my life but when I found this recipe I knew it was going to be amazing and effortless AND IT WAS!!! He scraped the pot... it was very good.. I did make a few changes I seasoned my ground turkey with sea salt, I used 1 can of tomato soup and 2 cans of diced tomato.. I also added Maggie seasoning when it was almost done it needed a bit more flavor to me..I added this to my cook book and will definitely make this again!!!!

This is a very nice recipe! However, I made 2 recipe for 8 people and had a serving or two left over. If I had made 1 recipe for 8 people, I definitely would not have had enough. So maybe the serving size should be decreased by half to accommodate feeding adults. But overall, I was very satisfied with how this turkey chili turned out. Thumbs up!

This was good but honestly I think for turkey chili the McCormick seasoning bag is just as good.  And WAY easier for someone like me who stinks at cooking.  Will stick with that for turkey chili in the future.

I made this for 8 chili-loving  people and it was gone quickly. Everybody loved it and I wished I had more to serve.  It was way too thick when I put it in the crockpot so I added a couple cups of bone broth and about a tablespoon of tomato paste. I used a can of tomatoes instead of soup.

This is the best chili I have ever made! My fiancé loved it as well.  The only things I did differently was I added 1 jalapeño and some corn and honey for sweetness to balance out the spice.  This will be my new go to recipe!

Loved the recipe..  Took some of the other review suggestions and switched out the soup with tomatoes with chilies.  Also since i used condensed soup, i added half a can of water for each soup can.   Added jalapenos for spice (thought this made the recipe).

Loved it! I made it vegetarian by replacing the ground beef with vegetarian crumbles. I also replaced 1 can tomato soup with chopped tomatoes with green chilis. Followed the recipe otherwise. We garnished with sour cream, cheese, and jalepenos. Was awesome and I will definitely make again!!!

I did not make any changes and I have made at least 6-8 times.  I actually use it for a dip for tortilla chips instead of a bowl of chili.

I'm super excited because this recipe tastes like my memories of eating chili when I was a kid. My mom used to make regular chili and I would have a whole lot of club crackers all mashed up into it. Now I think I did that because it cut down on the tomato-eyness and added some sweetness. Now without the crackers, thx to Laura's recipe, I achieve the same flavor. And w/so little effort! Woo-hoo! All I did was follow the recipe according to what I had on hand. I used a mixture of black, pinto, & cannellini beans. 1 tsp-ish of salt. 1 medium onion. Only one tsp vegetable oil. 2 8-oz cans of tomato sauce (I didn't have tomato soup) plus 2/3 cup of unsweetened original almond milk (not vanilla). I also didn't have allspice. So I used one pinch of cinnamon & 2 pinches of Chinese five spice. Finally, I added 2/3 of a scoop of Kal brand pure stevia extract. Everything else was the same. LOVE.  PURE LOVE!!

Best Chili Ever! Took some other suggestions read in the comments:
-  Add 1 can green chilis
- Substituted 1 can diced tomatoes for 1 can of the soup
- Added 1 can corn
- Added Mushrooms

Topped with Sour Cream & Crunched up Chedder & Asiago Cheesecrisps from costco.

Quick, easy and delicious - will definitely make it again.  The only critique I have is that it needed more liquid.  

I followed reviewers advice and made the following changes:
1. Omitted the chili powder altogether for young kids who hate spice.
2. Added about 8 oz of beer to the slow cooker for more liquid (light lager, e.g., corona or pacifico are good choices)
3. For the first step, I sautéed the onions, then added the turkey, so both were sautéed together. I also used about a cup of chopped onion instead of half a cup.
4. Instead of tomato soup I added 1 can of chopped tomatoes (with liquid) and one can of tomato sauce.

I topped with chopped red onion, sour cream, lime and shredded cheese, prepared white basmati rice to accompany. 

Whole family LOVED it.

This was SO good!  I usually make my own chile on the stove but decided to try this one for a change.  I used lean organic ground beef because that's what I had in the house.  Because the package was a bit more than what the recipe calls for, it seemed to not have quite enough liquid when I mixed it all together in the crock pot, so i added about 3/4 of a can of diced tomatoes.  Worked out perfectly.  I also fried some onions and garlic when I browned the meat so that was thrown into the pot too.  Even my 6 year old loved it!!!  Not too sweet or too acidic, just perfect.  Will definitely make again and again.

This was so easy and yummy! I actually only had a little less than 1 tbsp. of chili powder, and it was still great. I also left out the allspice. This will become a regular for our little family.

Ok, So I just made this and my family of 5 devoured it. Didn't even get to take a pic 1st. As with most reviewers; I substituted 1 can of diced Tomatoes with Green Chiles for the Tomato soup. I omitted the Allspice & Corn, FORGOT the Onions (I chopped them & set aside..), used only 1/2 the suggested amount of Red Pepper Flake (I used Crushed Red Pepper) and cooked on high for 4 hours. Actually turned to low for last hour. I also substituted Ground Beef for the Ground Turkey. I used about 5 twists of Pink Himalayan Salt from a grinder. 
     Words can't begin to describe how amazing this recipe is. Mine was appropriate for our 3 year old boy. Just enough "heat" to satisfy anyone. A variety of peppers or hot sauces can be added individually to taste.
     This will definitely be done again & again in our home.

I followed this recipe exactly, with a few exceptions. Instead of two cans of kidney beans, I used one and then added one can of white beans. I also only used one can of tomato soup, but added one can of diced tomatoes with green peppers and celery.  Everyone loved it!

This recipe is a keeper! I chose to use chopped up turkey cutlets instead of ground turkey to give it different texture. I didn't have red pepper flakes so I substituted 1/4 tsp of cayenne instead (probably could have used a tad more). Also substituted the tomato soup with two cans of diced fire roasted tomatoes. Topped it with a dollop of salsa and some grated cheese. Tasty!

I tried this chili recipe for the first time and it was great!  It was my first chili with ground turkey and I didn't change anything in the directions or ingredients.  It turned out really delicious.  I shared it with my son and and a co- worker and they loved it! I definitely will make it again and it is added to my recipe file.

This had come out delicious.  However, I had made a couple changes:
1 can of Campbells Tomato Soup
1 can Kidney Beans
1 can Black Beans
1 can Little White Beans
2 teaspoons (for a little spicy for those of you who like a little kick but, not over powering to where it isn't enjoyable)
1 can diced greed chiles

I cooked it for 9 hours on low on the slow cooker as well.  I didn't spray the slow cooker with cooking spray and it was fine in case anyone else forgets to do that part.

This was not horrible, but was very bland.  I made the recipe as is and ended up having to add a bunch of seasoning and veggies at the end in order to give it more flavor.  Ended up okay, but as the recipe is listed definitely only two stars.  I would recommend adding some fresh peppers and beefing up the seasonings.  Or just look for a different recipe.  This recipe has some great ratings, but if you actually read them almost all of them added different ingredients.

Pretty tasty for Turkey Chili! Very quick and easy to make. I did tweak a bit following other comments suggestions: Added corn, added green chilies, swapped out a can of tomato soup for a can of Rotels.

This is very good! And VERY easy.  I made a couple of changes:
Only used 1 can of kidney beans, and changed one can of soup for 1 can of Mild Ro-Tel.  
I usually use the Chili spice pack, but you don't need it.  This is very good.

Wow, was this good. I changed some things. I used cayenne instead of jalepenios. And more seasoning, along with paprika instead of thyme, I didn't have thyme. Garlic powder and onion powder. I tasted it am had out too much cayenne in it so to cool off the heat I put some cream cheese in it and it tasted even better! I double the recipe , ate some and froze the rest for the winter.

Used 1 can great northern beans, corn, 4oz green chiles, tomatoes with green chiles, diced tomatoes, 1/2 tbsp chili powder, 1/8 tsp red pepper flakes

Good taste, added a bit more salt and ate with sour cream and cheese + bread. Just a hint of spiciness and balanced with sweetness of corn. Not bad.

My boyfriend likes the chili a little thicker, so I left the top of the crock-pot half off for a few hours of the cooking processes.  We also like things kinda spicy so I added green chiles.  It turned out great!!!!!

Loved it! Next time I'll cut way back on the chili powder though. Way too hot for me and my friends. I like it mild and sweet. I made it with boca burger instead of real meat. Trying to go vegetarian and this was a good one to go meatless with.

This recipe is great and very easy to change around. I personally prefer more veggies and less beans, so I usually make this with a red pepper, a green pepper, and a whole medium sized onion. I use a can of black beans and a can of corn and skip the kidney beans all together. The spices are wonderful!

I followed the recipe and we love it. My husband has asked for it multiple times. It's almost too spicy for me (which means most people would consider it mild to moderate) but absolutely fantastic.

Well, this smelled so delicious while cooking today--perfumed the house nicely.  So, of course, I had to make a couple of changes since that's how I roll and sometimes I just like to use up things or add a spice or two.  First change, I did not have the tomato soup!  I did have some cream of onion so that's what I used, 1 can.  I then added a 7 oz can of La Preferida "homestyle sauce" which is a fine diced blend of tomatoes, onions, jalapenos, coriander, vinegar & spices, kind of a salsa.  I added a good 1/2 cup of chopped sun dried tomatoes since I had them and wanted to make sure I had some nice tomato flavor since I used the onion soup.  I also added a 14.5 oz can of whole tomatoes which I chopped up, included the liquid.  I added a 1/2 tsp ancho chile powder and all the other spices as directed but wasn't real careful with measurements-- I didn't level off any tablespoons.  Also added about 1 cup of water.  Used pinto, small white and black beans.  All my canned goods are low salt so I did end up sprinkling a bit of salt towards the end.  Didn't want to add salt too soon because of that onion soup being full salt.  It is very tasty and a great base recipe that allowed me to get creative with the ingredients I had on hand.

Having never cooked chili before, I needed a place to start and I found this to be excellent. 


I made a small batch exactly as the recipe described and found it ok, but a little bland. We like our food with intense flavors and while this was good (probably very good for those who prefer subtle flavors)... it needed some things to kick up the space/flavor. 


Changes I made:


Used Ground Beef AND Choice Stew Meat cut into 1'' pieces. browned  these with some of the spice mix, garlic and onion prior to throwing in the crock-pot. 


To the mixture I added 1.5 x the amount of spices called for in the recipe. Also added a can of diced tomatoes, green chillis and a can of tomato paste. Finally, I tossed in 1 large jalapeno, 1 small habanero and 1 serrano pepper, all seeded and diced very finely. 


With those changes and the added meatiness/spiciness. It WAS PERFECT! 


Hot and very tasty. Serve with sour cream and cheese on top with tortillas.

Really tasty! Thank you. I accidentally put a half-tablespoon of Jamaica allspice instead of a pinch, and thought it still tasted great. I also always add the onion and spices to the meat while it's browning. The spices seem more pungent to me that way.

This recipe is so tasty!!!! This is the second time I have made it, but I was sick the first time so I didn't get the proper taste although my husband was raving about it for days. The only tweaks I made was leaving out the red pepper flakes and adding one can of corn (drained). When everything gets put in the crockpot, it looks as if there is not enough liquid to become chili, but it liquifies just enough while in the crockpot. What a great recipe!

Followed the recipe and the chili tasted great. Paired it with some cheddar cheese and a dollop of plain yogurt. The reason for the minus one  star is that following all the recipe it came out a bit dry, would of need maybe one more can of tomato soup. Otherwise great recipe.

This is now my "go to" for making chili!  I only gave it 4 stars because of my adjustments.  I used 2 lbs of ground turkey, 2 sweet Italian sausage links (casings removed and crumbled), added 1 tablespoon worcestershire sauce while browning meat with 1 jumbo white onion and 3 large grated cloves of garlic.  I also didn't use soup; I instead used 1 can of plain diced tomatoes and two cans of diced tomatoes with green chilies (I mixed all three cans in a bowl for 1/2 the day so the plain tomatoes could blend in).  Because of the extra can of tomatoes, I added more seasonings (total of 3 tablespoons chili powder, 3 1/2 teaspoons ground cumin, 1/4 tsp salt, 1/4 tsp celery salt, only 1/2 tsp garlic powder because of fresh garlic used and kept red pepper flakes at 1 tsp and pinches of black pepper and allspice the same as listed).  As for the beans, I used 3 cans; 1 low sodium black, 1 low sodium light red kidney and 1 dark red kidney beans (regular, not low sodium).  Sooo good and easy!  Will be in regular rotation.  Oh, and I only cooked for 5 1/2 hours  on low (my crock pot seems to always cook faster and I've always had to cut time by 2 hours).

Family loved it, including a 3 & 4 yr old. Fried one chopped onion and 2 garlic cloves then added it to the turkey after frying the turkey. Added salt & pepper to this mixture to season.  Only added one can of tomato soup and added two cans of diced, seasoned tomatoes.  Added one can of mushrooms. Delicious.

This is a really solid recipe. Great flavor. I kept the pepper flakes out so people could add heat as they liked. Next time I might consider using ground beef and increasing the amount to 1.5 lbs.

This was good. I feel crock pot food doesn't always live up to stove top or oven food but it was good. I subbed ground beef for turkey, 14.5 oz can of petite diced chili style tomatoes for one can of soup, white beans for one of the kidney and 4 oz can of diced green chilis with an extra 1/2 to 3/4 can of water and a 10 oz can of mexicorn.  I also browned the meat and onion together. Easy, tasty worth making :)

I really liked that this dish was super easy to make and didn't require too much work yet still tasted really good, not to mention healthier than other chili because of the turkey. It was a little on the spicy side but it wasn't too bad, I'd still enjoy making and eating it again.

This came out great.  I didn't use the red pepper flakes so it wasn't spicy since my family doesn't like a lot of spice.  Next time I would add maybe mushrooms and a little cayenne pepper, not too much.  This was very filling and tasty.  My boys went for a 2nd helping so that is good.

Very good Chili base! If you like it spicy and with bell peppers here's my mods: I added 2 bell peppers, whole white onion instead of yellow, 2 jalapeños, 3 (small) banana peppers, a lot more red pepper flakes, and a few dashes of cinnamon and smoked paprika. Also instead of tomato soup I used one can tomato sauce and one can stewed tomatoes. Came out awesome! Wife requested I make it again as soon as we ran out! Think this'll be a staple!

I USED TOMATO SOUP!  I actually followed the recipe.  It was quite irritating to read so many reviews of THIS recipe, when they substituted a major ingredient!  It took me a bit to find a few reviewers who could tell me HOW this recipe REALLY turned out.... WITH the soup!  Anyway, good base chili recipe. The soup worked... thank you.  :)

I replaced one can of the tomato soup with a can of diced tomatoes. I also added a small can of mild green chiles (ex: 4.5oz can of Old El Paso Green Chiles). This chili has the right amount of spice for my family. My husband likes things a bit spicier than I, so he added a few splashes of hot sauce to his. Top it with a little shredded cheddar or Mexican cheese, a dollop of sour cream, and some corn bread and you've got a perfect meal for chilly day. :)

I made a few changes.  Deleted the tomato soup and used diced tomatoes.  A large can. I threw in a small can of Rotel   tomatoes with green chilies.  My other big change was to use shredded turkey breast or white meat chicken.  
The spices in this recipe are perfect!!!  Tried cinnamon instead of allspice.  I make a huge pot when I have guests.  It is always a big hit.

This was delicious! I used one big 28-oz can of diced tomatoes instead of the soup. Some comments said it was dry, and it did seem dry when everything was mixed together, so I added about 1 cup of chicken broth before cooking. I used whatever beans we had in the house -- which happened to be aduki and cuban-style black beans -- and I don't think that made any difference in terms of taste. I also used 1/2 the amount of chili powder, so it was pretty mild. There was enough here for a few meals...I'd make it again.

GREAT FLAVOR! My husband claims to make the best chili ever.  After having this chili, he said, "its better than mine!"  That says a lot because he doesn't show a lot of emotion regarding recipes.  He commented numerous times through out eating it that it was awesome.   He loves thick, spicy chili and this was exactly that.  I toned it down by adding cheese and sour cream.  That allowed us both to enjoy it!  I did add a can of tomatoes with chilies and only one can of tomato soup as recommended by others on here and it made it delicious!  Love that it is a crockpot recipe also.  My house smelled amazing all afternoon!  Highly recommend! Thanks for sharing!

I love this chili recipe. Did substitute one can of tomato soup with rotel original. Also added a jalapeño sliced thinly for flavor. 
Definitely cook the turkey meat with onions. If u don't like black beans substitute with a can of navy beans 
Top it off with sargento sharp shredded cheese.  So yummy

This was so easy to make! Highly recommended, although I wish there was something sweet in there. It was very hearty and delicious, but I feel like it could've been balanced by peppers, etc.

Great recipe! I did use  a can of tomatoes with chilies, a can of tomato soup, less Chipotle powder and a can of garbanzos,  and a can of red kidneys.  My finicky husband could have eaten it all, but held himself back. That's really high praise from him, especially asking me to make again, a lot! Thanks again for a great chili.

Very good recipe, I made a few changes, I used about a half a pound of left over ham and a pound of left over turkey.  I also doubled the recipe and used two cans of tomato soup and two cans of diced tomatoes.  Turned out really good, I also topped it with chili flavored Fritos, though I imagine the regular kind would have done just as well.  I will definitely make it again.

We love this chili! Instead of tomato soup I put 1 can of organic diced tomatoes(with juice) and 1 can of organic tomato sauce. I also only put in 1 can of black beans instead of 2 and put in a can of low sodium chili beans in place of the second can. Along with the kidney beans of course. And 1 can of corn! I lightly seasoned the ground turkey while cooking it on the stovetop as well :)

I've made this for years and have passed the recipe on multiple times.  I have never made it with tomato soup, I like texture in my chili and use 3 cans of Rotel instead.  I use white beans instead of kidney which is just a personal preference.  We top ours with either elbow macaroni or tortilla chips, cheese and sour cream.  Easy with leftovers and it tastes great!  My husband only found out it was made with turkey a few years ago after finding the package in the garbage.

Excellent.  Use 2 15oz cans of the Hunt's chili-seasoned tomato soup.  Also, include one green, red, and jalapeño pepper.

I have made this before and made no changes but this time I did.  Instead of soup I used 2 cans of dice tomatoes with jalapeños and I small can of tomato sauce. I used 1 can of kidney, gabonzo bens and a can of black beans. I also added a can of corn. I sautéed a whole onion with garlic with the ground turkey before hand and then threw it all in the slow cooker. Also added a can of diced chiles. I doubled all the spices, roasted red pepper, cayenne pepper and cumin.. We like it hot. It was amazing!!!

This is great!  I followed other reviewers' advice, adding a can of diced tomatoes with chiles in place of the second can of tomato soup, just used one can of kidney beans, added some green chiles, and just eyeballed the spices without worrying about the Allspice because I don't have any.  I browned the onion and turkey together before putting it all in the crock pot, and it turned out phenomenal!  I  was looking forward to eating it all day and it did not disappoint.  I will definitely make this again.

This is delicious! Super easy to make, hardly any prepping. Only reason I didn't give it a 5 star comes from all the chili cook offs I've been to and I have deff tasted better, but for a quick home recipe this is a keeper! I did what a lot of the other cooks mentioned, added diced tomatoes, chopped green bell pepper and 2 jalapeño peppers. This added more color, texture and spiced it up a bit!

Easy recipe which will be made again. My changes: I followed the recommendation with the tomatoes and chiles, plus can of chilies, corm and the variety of beans. I used approximately two lbs of turkey as I like meaty chili. I used the two tomatoes soups as well. Rather than adding one can of water, I use cooking/chicken stock. I substituted the red pepper flakes with three jalapenos, sliced, and halved.  I made this for my hunting camp and everyone raved over it and had multiple servings. For reference I cook with a 6qrt cooker.

Amazing!! So flavorful and easy! The only changes I made were subbing one can of soup for a can of chili-style tomatoes and adding a bit of water (maybe 6oz or so). The recipe has enough heat that my husband and I enjoyed the flavor but is mild enough that my toddler was able to eat it with no problem. This made about 5 full bowls. Prep took no more than 20 minutes start to finish. Will be making this many, many times again!

I threw in a can of stewed tomatoes instead of one of the tomato soup cans. I have had it both ways, with two cans of soup and with one can of soup. I like it better with one can. The two cans of soup makes it too sweet. I did this stovetop

Like others, I swapped out one can of tomato soup for diced tomatoes & green chiles, I also cooked the onions while browning the turkey. 2nd time making it I accidentally added a can of diced jalapeños in place of the green chile and while very tasty for the adults, it was a little tough of the kids' palates. This is keeper.

I love this recipe! I have made it several times. I do make some slight changes. Like a lot of the other reviewers, I use one can tomato soup and one can of diced tomatoes with chilies. Also I use one tablespoon medium chili powder and one tablespoon hot chili powder. Also surprisingly I have never used a crock pot, I always make it in my pressure cooker. It takes about 20-25 minutes in the pressure cooker and it comes out tender and perfect as if it has been cooking all day!

So I made a few changes according to what I had: 
- I sautéed the onion and added 2 cloves of chopped garlic (sautéed as well), and halved the amount of garlic powder. I like garlic :] 
- Used 2 cans of regular tomato soup rather than reduced sodium
- Used Olive oil instead of veggie
- Used 1 can kidney beans, 1 can black beans, and 1 can of pinto beans, for color and variety
- Rather than 2 tablespoons of chili powder, I did 1.5 or so, and used Korean hot chili powder. 
- Splashed in some sweet paprika, and used a pinch of cinnamon rather than allspice.
I guess I actually made a lot of changes. But after 4 hours on high and 2 on low, it was fantastic! We scooped in a little rice and topped with plain greek yogurt, cheddar cheese, and green onions. Definitely keeping this one around to experiment with, if anything.

I loved this - although I had to make a few changes based on what I had in my cupboard. II used only one can of tomato soup, 1 can of black beans, 1 can of white kidney beans, and 1 can of pre-pared spicy baked beans. I also ran out of cumin and added garlic salt. Finally I added some pickled jalapenos. Amazing!

Fantastic! Browned 3 lbs turkey with onion. Added two cans tomato soup, one can rotel, , one can beans.  DoubledvSpices as listed with exception of red pepper flakes (a couple shakes). Cooked it all on the stovetop for a couple hours then topped with shredded cheddar. My Kids who claimed to not like chili devoured it with tortilla chips!

My husband and I are making this recipe right now. I followed some of the other reviewers suggestions like the tomatoes and green chilies instead of a can of tomato soup. It needed a little more of kick for us so we added a tablespoon of chipotle powder and it is good for me now. Great recipe, will definitely be getting added to our favorites!!(:

It was easy to make but I found it extremely bland. Had to add hot sauce and cheese just to make it decent.

Great chili recipe! I made it when I didn't have a working stove or oven and used a bag of frozen meatless crumbles.  It turned out great and you couldn't tell the difference at all.

I've made this again and again! It's too good!! Definitely add the corn! Second time I made it I only had one can tomato soup; so I subbed a can of manwich sauce. Sounds crazy, but I now use it every time!! Adds a very small bit of flavor and thickening. Also took other suggestions, chopped tomatoes with chiles, etc. thanks Laura!! Everyone loves it!

I used Hot Chili Powder for extra heat. I'd use 3 cans of tomato soup next time just to make it a little juicier. Current recipe is pretty thick and I like a little more liquid. Excellent w Fritos, sour cream and sharp cheddar cheese.

Great recipe. I added a can of diced tomatoes, doubled the cumin and used half the amount of red pepper flakes. Came out perfect!
Next time I'll probably skip the red pepper flakes to minimize the acid reflux ;)

I have made this chili for a few years now, and my family loves it!  I make it about once a month in the winter, freezing any excess.  I make the following changes to create an overall spice level of medium:

-For my 8.5 quart crockpot, I triple the recipe, except for the beans.  I use 3 cans red kidney beans and 3 cans black beans for the triple recipe.
- Instead of turkey, I use extra lean ground beef.
- I use a nonstick pan and omit the vegetable oil.  I drain any fat from the pan, then return the beef to the pan and turn the heat up to brown the beef.
- I use one large onion sauteed in with the beef, as well as about 10 cloves of garlic (add garlic last so that it doesn't burn).
- Instead of two cans of tomato soup, I use one can of tomato soup and one 15 oz. jar of hot salsa.
- I either add fresh hot peppers (habanero and jalapeno) or add 1-2 cans of Rotel diced tomatoes with habaneros (hard to find, but in the Northeast, we've found it at Target).
- I omit the salt.

We eat the chili in all of the following ways:
- on its own
- with chips
- with cheese
- on top of french fries
- on top of a baked potato
- with chili cheese hotdogs
- in a chili cheese omelet
- as Frito pie (corn chips in a bowl, then chili, then cheese)

Great quick recipe! I made a few adjustments. I used the whole onion and added a red bell pepper. Instead of cumin I used cayenne. It added a little more kick and veggies! I think if I make it again I'll add a green bell pepper and maybe some celery or spinach!

Yummy!! I've definitely been craving chili and this was definitely satisfying. Like others, I substituted the 2 cans of soup for 1 can diced tomatoes and 1 can Trader Joe's fire roasted canned tomatoes with chiles. It adds a nice kick to the chili! I also added a little bit of leftover tomato paste I sauteed garlic and a red bell pepper with the ground turkey. 

This was a super quick and easy dish! Top off with shredded cheese, avocados and a dollop of greek yogurt (healthy alternative to sour cream) and you've hit the jackpot!

This is a good turkey chili base. To cater to my family's tastes and get in more veggies, I:  used one can tomato soup and two cans of diced tomatoes (with liquid), added a small can of diced chiles, added a diced green bell pepper, and added about a cup of frozen roasted corn kernels.  I replaced the garlic powder with minced garlic, left out the black beans, and used one can of dark red kidney beans and one can of light red. I reduced the amount of red chili flakes, increased cumin (which my husband loves) and added a dash of liquid smoke. Before tumbling everything into the slow cooker, I browned the turkey with the onion and bell pepper. I also added a bay leaf while it cooked.

Great recipe, but I made a few changes: I used olive instead of vegetable oil, cans of organic diced tomatoes instead of tomato soup, omitted the allspice, and used 2 teaspoons of ground red pepper instead of a teaspoon of red pepper flakes to give the chili a nice little "kick." My husband & I loved how it turned out!

I didn't make any changes to this recipe and it was awesome! We don't like cooked, stewed, or crushed tomatoes, so this was ideal. Enough spice to please the adults without being too spicy for the kids. We will definitely make this one again!

We enjoyed this recipe, though we tempered the chili powder to make sure it wasn't too spicy and regretted doing so (it wasn't spicy enough for us).  We added a splash of El Yucateco habanero sauce at the end, that helped spice it up to our taste.  Also, we made the following modifications: used 1 tbsp minced garlic in place of the garlic powder, substituted one of the cans of tomato soup with a can of diced tomatoes with green chiles, and we used only one can of kidney beans instead of two.  Also, we didn't brown the turkey in advance, and it turned out fine (we did oil the crockpot, which may have helped create a similar effect).  Overall, this was a good recipe, and we will make it again!

This has become a staple Fall/Winter meal in our house. My husband asks for it as soon as the weather starts to change. I use coconut oil instead of vegetable oil but otherwise follow the recipe. I also serve with sour cream and shredded cheese on top. It's delicious!

I did make a few changes, I did fry the onion with the meat.  I added a can a diced tomato. But I think the cumin was a bit much for me.  But overall a great recipe.  Will make it again.

This is our favorite base chili.  we use a little less chili powder. Also, I never have tomato soup, so we usually use canned diced tomatoes, with the juice and have even used V8.  Delicious!

Very Good. Nice flavor. Few changes:

I added 2 hatch chili peppers. Very good if you like spicy.
No All Spice.

I minced the onions and hatch chili peppers. One hatch chili pepper would probably be sufficient for most.

I loved this chili! I did take the suggestions and included a can of drained corn, a can of diced tomatoes, and green chilies.  I did substitute in a can of pinto beans for one of the cans of kidney beans just because we love the flavor of both.

Great recipe, warms you right up on a cold day.  And the turkey, in my opinion, is way better than using beef.

My Dad is 88 years old and as of about two years ago, a diabetic.  He's also the original "red meat and potatoes" man.  He also prefers a hot meal for his dinner even in warm weather.  That said, he loves this chili and so do I!  It's easy to make.  Since it's a crockpot meal, it doesn't heat up the kitchen when it's warm outside, and it's delicious!  This chili has a little heat, but it's not the "set your mouth on fire" variety of chili.  If you want it really hot, you'd probably have to up the chili powder and hot pepper flakes and maybe add some other heat producing ingredient.  But we like it just the way it is.  I highly recommend it!

loved the recipe and it's great for the entire family, kids included.  I also added the corn, substituted the tomatoes with green chiles along with one can of the tomatoe soup, eliminated the red pepper flakes and varied the bean selection (red kidney, white, and black).  Delicious!

I absolutely love this recipe! I've been making it for years! I do tweak it a bit though just to suit my tastes. I add half cut jalapeños, a can of corn with the juice, and sliced bell peppers for color and lots of fresh garlic . I also use a packet of chili seasoning instead of the individual seasonings and some tomato paste to thicken it up . I still  add red pepper flakes because I love my food spicy. Such a low maintenance meal to make that's so hearty, do it in the am and by the time you come home from work it's delicious and ready to go!

I've made it twice now. First time I didn't have chili powder so I made some from scratch. That time was better. I also overdid the beans the second time to use some up. It threw off the ratio. But it was still awesome. Both times I added large chopped mushrooms. I doubled the recipe and froze most of it in muffin tins. Now I just pop one in the microwave while I make a piece of toast and I'm ready for a snack.

This chili is very good.  I usually find ground turkey recipes to be a bit bland, but this is not bland at all.  I followed the suggestions of other reviewers and used one can of tomato soup and one can of Rotel, but with the Rotel and 2 tbsp of chili powder, it was WAY too spicy for me.  I bumped it down to 1 tbsp of chili powder on my next attempt.  I do not have allspice, but I added some Sam Adam's Winter Lager and that worked out well.  This will become a regular in our household.

Delicious! The spices make it a superb chili! Any broth is a great sub for water, and any beans and tomatoes add texture and absorb the flavor! Thank-you

I loved it! This was my very first time making chili because I just don't like beans. But I made this for my family and my hubby and kids loved it! With a family of seven this was a great meal that stretched. But there were hardly any leftovers for the next day. I used the suggestions like tomatoes with chile's and I even added a half of pack of chili mix. It was so good! I even ate it and enjoyed both the kidney and black beans. I look forward to making this again!

Spicy, I had made this for a family dinner for a 18 month old and hubby and my self. I would have eaten it but it was too spicy ( I am b feeding our newborn) I had only used 1 tbs of Cayenne pepper as the heat. No red pepper flakes.... The hubby loved it and the Lil one didn't get any. I added a dollop of sour cream to the bowl as well. Looking forward to trying again. Not sure why or how it came out so spicy.

I have made this chili many times and love it! :) Don't get me wrong, the original recipe is fantastic, but I usually end up I tweking a little bit because of what I have in my fridge and pantry. My favourite rendition thus far has to be substituting the canned tomato soup for diced tomatoes (juice left in), adding a jalapeño pepper (with some seeds removed), a can of peaches and cream corn, and adding a healthy pour of kahlua!

Great recipe, love the turkey in it! Made some changes to my own taste (added some leftover tomato pasta sauce I had kicking around in the freezer, and only 1 can red kidney beans), but so happy I found this! Thanks for a great meal I will be making over and over!

Did as others suggested and substituted a can of tomato soup with a can of tomatoes with green chiles, added a half can of water and omitted the red pepper flakes (it was plenty spicy). Also sauteed the onion before browning the meat, rinsed the beans to cut back on salt and didn't add any salt and added a can of sweet corn, drained.  Topped with a little bit of cheddar cheese.  Super easy to make and tasted great. Will definitely make again.

This recipe was awesome. I did tweak it a little bit for the tastes of my family. Instead of tomato soup I used 1 cup of marinara sauce and a can of chopped tomatoes with chilies as suggested by others.  I also sautéed the onions with the ground turkey before putting it into the crockpot. And I put just a pinch of red pepper flakes instead of the 1 teaspoon recommended because my kids were eating it and I didn't want to spicy. Perfect!!!!

Good, but not the best chili I have had. I subbed a can of soup for a can of Rotel as many suggested, and added another can of beans. Next time I think I will add a can of diced tomatoes as well. I didn't have allspice, so I omitted that, but I will try that next time.

I loved this recipe. I used 1 can diced tomatoes with green chilies in place of  tomato soup and used 1 can white kidney beans in place of red kidney beans. I cut out crushed red peppers and cut the hot ingredients in half of suggested amount because of kids. Still has a kick to it. Served with white rice. Tomorrow will serve with Nachos.  Very delicious!! Thanks for sharing!!

Very good simple chili recipe. I made a few adjustments - used a can of diced tomatoes instead of 1 of the cans of tomato soup. I used pinto beans instead of black beans and added 1 chopped pepper. I also cut down the chili powder to 1 1/2 tablespoons. My whole family enjoyed this, so I will be making it often.

This is a spectacular recipe. I added all the ingredients to the pan as I cooked the turkey even the spices so they cooked a little and be me really aromatic. Then I topped with fresh avocado, fresh chopped jalapeños and chives and a squirt of lime.... DELICIOUS!

Loved it. I added red bell pepper and used the seeds from that instead of flakes.  Sautéed the onion and  red pepper with the meat.   I subed one can of tomato soup for a can of tomatoes and green chilies. Added a can of corn,  yum! Mixed up the spices some too,  mustard powder,  onion powder. A great recipe to make your own!  The turkey is great.

This is very good chili! I kept the recipe mostly the same but made slight modifications based on the reviews. I did replace one can of soup with the diced tomatoes and green chilies. I also added a little water (and a bouillon cube because I tend to do that to flavor any water I decide to add last minute). As for the spiciness, I kept to the recipe but eyeballed the amount of crushed pepper and extra chili powder I added based on my preference. I picked the long cooking method - 8 hrs - and the flavors really blended well.

FANTASTIC CHILLI! 

This tasted good even a week after I made it! 
I followed the recipe added corn, and extra seasonings to give it color and to make sure it had LOTS of flavor. It was sooooo good! The only thing I would change was the tomato soup was too soupy as we were serving it over rice and I wanted a more condensed version. I had to let it reduce for almost 6 hrs to get it to the consistency I wanted. Next time I will use tomato paste. But otherwise DEFINETLY keeping this one!

This is so good! I was hesitant to make it because I've never cooked with ground turkey and my family is very picky. But it turned out to be a big hit! I didn't have allspice, I had season all I don't know if it's the same thing but it turned out great! We put shredded cheddar cheese on top and ate it with tortilla chips.

A little more heat than I'm used to, but I'm used to quite mild chili. Really enjoyed this, particularly with some Monterey Jack sprinkled on top. Used ground beef instead of turkey which I browned with the onion before adding it to the crockpot.

I have made this too many times to count.  I substituted chili beans instead of kidney beans.  Since I am not the cook of the family, the husband likes to do it, this is a good recipe for someone who doesn't really like to cook (me!).  It has just enough spice to keep everyone, including the kids, happy.

Made this using crushed tomatoes instead of the tomato soup and it was so good.  The family usually does not eat turkey and they all loved it including myself. Thanks Laura.

Love this chili! My boyfriend and I have made it exactly per recipe instruction and with our own changes, and we love it both ways. He can handle a lot more "spice" than I can, and this is the perfect blend of spices for people who do and do not like hotter foods. This is one of our favorites.

Loved it!  Did as recommended, used 1 can chopped tomatoes instead of soup, added 1 can of corn, 1 can green chiles, 1/2 can extra water, and a little chipotle and tomato paste.  Great served with cheese, sour cream, cornbread, fresh lime squeeze, hot sauce and cornbread!

Great recipe. I prefer things a bit milder, so I halved all of the strong spices, and it still had enough of a kick for me. Other changes - used vegetarian "beef" instead of turkey, which worked out really nicely, especially if you are not into meat; added corn and 1 can of fire roasted tomatoes in lieu of black beans and second can of Campbell's tomato soup, respectively, as per advice of a previous reviewer. Also added cinnamon and pumpkin spice for a slightly sweet flavor, and as someone else suggested, used a towel to line the lid so the liquid doesn't drip into the chili and make it too liquidy. 4 hours on "high" was still not enough to get a lot of the liquid out, so I gave it closer to 5, and it was still somewhat soupy, but I actually liked it that way, so that was okay. Next time, I'll add 1 can of  pumpkin puree as suggested by another recipe, to give it even more of a sweeter flavor - I really like when you can feel both the spicy and the sweet flavors equally strongly and sense the texture and taste of the chunky pieces of "meat," beans and corn in your mouth.

I followed the recipes as written but, as suggested, did 1 can of tomato soup and 1 can of tomatoes with green chilis. I added another 4oz can of green chilis. Cooked in high for about 3:30 hours. I didn't like this chili. It was bland. I think I'm done trying turkey chilis I can't find one I like.

This is a winter time staple in my house. It's hearty and filling for my teenage son and it is quick to throw together in the morning. I also modified the recipe by adding a can of diced tomatoes and omitting a can of the soup like a few other reviewers recommended. I love coming home to the smell of this tasty dish!

It came out too spicy. I tried what the other reviewers have recommended/said: 1 can of tomato with green chili, in place of one of the tomato soup, and I also omitted the red pepper flakes to make it kid friendly, but it was still not kid-friendly at all.
Furthermore, per recipe 2 tablespoon of chili powder - I only put 1 tablespoon, but it was still too spicy.
I like spicy food, but this is too spicy and my toddler can't eat it. I had a little stomachache after eating a cup.
I recommend to just stick with the 2 cans of tomato soup, don't substitute the 1 can of tomato soup with 1 can of tomato with chili. Also don't put the red pepper flakes and hold-off on adding the whole 2 tablespoons of chili powder; you might need to adjust it according to your liking. This is way too spicy for me. Other than that, overall, it has good flavor.

I have been craving chili for a long time. Looked at a lot of recipes. Made this today...just finished a bowl for lunch! Took the advice of other reviewers, but i used diced tomatoes without salt added. The other substitutions i made were using 1 can of low sodium kidney beans, low sodium black beans, red onion and half a pound of hot turkey sausage. I omitted the all spice and added a couple table spoons of bacon bits. Took a nap and wake up to find out my very picky daugther who does not like black beans had already eaten 2 bowls (black beans and all.) She has been know to pick every piece of something she does not like from her food. Had mine...soooo good!

Such tasty, fulfilling and healthy chili! Of course beef adds a lot more flavor because of the oils but that's why turkey makes you feel so much better about eating it. I also like the thickness and consistently of it. I omitted a can of kidney beans as I'm not the biggest fan and I still thought it was fine.

I am a beginner cook who just moved out of my parents a few months ago.My boyfriend bought me a slow cooker and this was the first recipe we tried out. This was extremeley easy to make and came out delicious. I don't like my chili hot so I completely omitted the red pepper flakes. 
I read the reviewer suggestions below and I too swapped one can of tomato soup for one can of diced tomatoes.
I added only one can of red kidney beans and instead added a can of mexicorn(corn with red and green bell peppers) and half a can green chillies.  I also added half a can of water because it was rather thick. I didn't have all spice so I replaced that with a pinch of cinnamon which actually did a good job cutting the acidity.  Will definitley be making this again.

I've made this countless times and it has become a staple in our home!  Super easy, the only thing I change is adding a can of corn!  We love topping it with shredded cheese, sour cream and broken up tortilla chips!

I wanted to try a different chili so gave this recipe a go. It was alright but I will definitely go back to my usual chili recipe. There are some things missing.....

i used one package extra lean turkey, one package lean turkey - sauteed in oil with one chopped onion, spray crock pot with pam, add turkey, 1 bag frozen corn, 1 (10 oz) can tomato soup, one (15 oz) can black beans, one (15 oz) can kidney beans, 3 (14.5 oz) cans diced tomatoes, 2 T chili powder, 1 t red pepper flakes, 1 T garlic powder, 1 T cumin, salt and pepper to taste.  Came out great a little too spicy for kids.

This recipe is FANTASTIC!! My husband (who claims to not like chili) has asked me to make this every week for the past three weeks. So easy, so delicious. I didn't change a thing except lowered the amount of red pepper flakes to a sprinkle, since we're wimps when it comes to spice.

Good, but not great.  Not too spicy.  Thicker than I expected (which is good).  Definitely need to coat the sides of the slow cooker with spray to make clean up easier.

My boyfriend and roommate thought this was delicious. I liked the amount of spice, but I don't like things super hot. If you wanted it to be spicier, there's definitely room for that. I used the following main ingredients instead of exactly what was listed and it was great. 
-One can black beans
-One can red kidney beans
-One can of white beans
-One can of semi-sweet corn 
-One can of low sodium tomato juice 
-One can of diced tomatoes with jalapeños 
-One 4 ounce can of green chiles

Don't forget the following toppings. Yum! 
-Cilantro
-Chedder cheese
-Avocado 
-Nonfat greek yogurt or sour cream

This was a good chili. I enjoyed the change to ground turkey meat. The tomato soup added a creamy texture that most chili doesn't have. I really enjoyed it!

Super easy and delicious. I did take advice after reading MANY reviews and added a can of rotel w/chiles instead of a second can of soup. Also used 20oz ground turkey which was right on par with the amount of beans. Omitted the allspice since I didn't have it. The reason for 4 stars is because the suggested cooking time is off as others have stated. It is easily done in 6 hours on low before it starts sticking to the pot and that was with adding 1/2 can of water. Overall it was great and will definitely make it again. Thank you!

I loved this recipe but we wanted a little bit more kick so i'm adding half an habanero and we'll see if i'm still alive to update how it is.  Also, I didn't use the hot flakes since i added the pepper.  Last I used regular tomato soup since I couldn't find the low-sodium one.  I obviously left out the salt since the soup adds enough sodium.

Wow.  Quick, simple, healthy with some heat and very yummy.  It was great.  I did add one can of "hot" diced green chili's, but otherwise made exactly as written.  Topped with shredded cheddar, a little sour cream and a few crushed Frito Corn Chips.

I love this recipe!  It has become a favorite of my husband and I.  I use  a roasted red pepper tomato soup, and fresh chopped garlic instead of the powder.  I also add extra onion.  I also use a packet of chili seasoning along with the cumin and a little less of the chili powder recommended.  I don't have any allspice on hand so I leave that out too.  Yum!

This was my first experience with a slow cooker. I hate tomatoes so no chunky tomatoes in this recipe is what attracted me. I did everything that the recipe said, except for the allspice- Don't have it, don't even know what it is. I did had 1/2 a can of beer, a little hot sauce and no salt.
I planned on the 8 hour cook time since I had to work. I stopped home and checked on it at the 6 hour mark and IT WAS PERFECT!!! I was SO EXCITED!!! I left well enough alone, still cooking on low, for another 2 hours.
I came home only to find dried out paste with barely any flavor. It was PERFECT earlier. So spicy it cleared my sinuses! I loved it! 
So, I would recommend that 6 hours is the max you should cook it. I'm going to try it again when I can be around to turn it off at 6 hours. So disappointed but that's my own fault. It was REALLY AWESOME before it over cooked.

This chili was amazing. I was struggling to pick a recipe for a soup exchange and came by this. It was the hit of the exchange. So easy too. Be sure to make enough for leftovers, it seemed even better the next day.

Wow.  Never used ground turkey before, even planned an alternate dinner for hubby.  It turned out wonderfully.  Did what others suggest - I can of tomato soup and one of chopped tomatoes with chilies.  Opted to omit all other HOTS. great results for us.

This is very good, especially the second day.  As others suggested, used 1 can of tomatoes and 1 can of tomato soup and only 1 can of kidney beans. Added I can of kernel corn and fresh garlic. Will be adding this to my frequently made recipes. Thanks

I replaced the canned tomato soup with low sodium diced tomatoes. Used fresh ground turkey and chopped garlic cloves. I added celery for some sodium and also added mushrooms.

This is the easiest recipe I found for turkey chili that did not include diced tomatoes. Neither my husband or I eat them. We both absolutely love this turkey chili and I make it at least every other week in the fall and summer. I always make it as the recipe states , but will be trying some of the suggestions for some variety.

This is definitely one of my favorite slow cooker recipes.  Didn't change a thing and it was so hearty and good.  Skeptics of ground turkey probably won't be able to tell it's not ground beef.

I love this recipe. It's so easy that I make it at least once a month and it stays in the fridge for about a week providing a quick on the go meal. I use all low-sodium beans when I can, I substitute one of the cans of tomato soup for a can of Southwestern style diced tomatoes and green chilies, I also add a little tomato paste as well as some extra green chilies. And on top of all that I will add one or two more extra cans of beans. It could be chili beans which is pinto beans in chili sauce and/or some white beans, Low-sodium of course.

This was my first time making chili and it was amazing! This recipe was awesome. My family likes spicy so this was perfect for us. We topped it with a little shredded mozzarella and served it with crusty french bread. I will definitely be making this easy recipe again!

Easy and came out great!  Like the other reviewers I modified slightly, replacing soup with 1 can sliced tomatoes, adding the equivalent of one can of frozen corn and 1/2 cup water.  Followed spices but skipped allspice as we didn't have it.  Added 2 green chilies and 1 and a half Jalapenos as we like spice.  Also liked this recipe because it fit in my smaller size crockpot and made 4-6 servings which is about right for us. UPDATE: [To avoid cans and to lower sodium content] I have also made this with dry beans (I cooked 2 cups dry kidney & 1 cup dry black beans together with a little onion and 1tsp. salt & added 4 cups of the cooked result to the chili); 4 diced roma tomatoes (instead of soup); 3 cloves minced garlic (instead of powder); 1 cup frozen corn; added 1/2 cup bean water + 2 green chilies and 1-1/2 jalapeño.  A little more labor intensive, but I usually serve beans and rice or burritos the first night and turn the beans into chili the next night.  This is a great base recipe with the right proportions!  Spiciness can be modified to taste.

Made this over the weekend and it was a hit! I followed some alterations that were in the comments. I exchanged a can of tomato soup with a can of diced tomatoes with green chili (mild) and I also added 1/2 can of mild green chilis. Perfect amount of spice. I also added a can of corn which added a nice crunch. Also, something that is probably common sense but I thought might be helpful is to add to drain the cans of beans before adding them to the pot. Thanks so much for posting!

Excellent recipe!!! I added a can of diced tomato with olive oil and green chile to the recipe.  The diced tomato with olive oil cut down the spiceness and hotness of the recipes.  But the end product still had a kick. My audience loved the end product.

This is an easy, good and hearty recipe. As others suggested, I substitured the 2 cans of soup for 2 cans of diced tomatoes. Also substituted one can of kidney beans for pinto beans instead - just to have a greater variety. I also only included 1 tbsp of chili powder, as that is enough, and added a chopped bell pepper.

I've been making this recipe for 6 years now, and I love it. I do a couple tweaks though, I don't add the onions (and add a can of diced chilis) until the last hour, use more chili powder. Sometimes I sub a can of tomatoes instead of two soups. It's a winter fave in my house!!

Excellent!  I did modify a bit for what I had on hand, but the results were wonderful.  I used a can of tomato sauce and a can of crushed tomatoes in place of the tomato soup.  Only 1 can of black beans, cayenne instead of red pepper flakes, omitted allspice, and added a dash of turbinado sugar to cut the acidity.  Also, didn't use any oil.  This was delicious and I will make again.  Served with shredded cheddar, onions and corn chips.

I made this chili for last years's chili cookoff at work and it wone fisrt place.  The only changes that I made was to substitute 1 can Cannellini beans and 1 can white beans for the 2 cans Kidney beans.  I also add some canned jalapenos.

Everytime I make this, people go crazy for it. And the best part is that it is SOOOO easy to make! I keep it mild in spice for general crowd pleasing, but I am itching to ramp up the heat with some jalapeno and cayenne pepper.

I love this recipe!  It's so simple and flexible to using whatever you happen to have on hand.  I especially like how perfect it is for a cold day.  I throw everything in the slow cooker in the morning and come home to a filling meal that's healthy.  I wish I had more recipes like this.

Terrific, took the advice and substituted 1 can white beans for 1 can kideny beans, added one can rotel tomatoes with chiles plus soup, 4 oz green chiles and 1/2 can of water.  I forgot to brown onions and turkey together and it was still delicious! My 10 year old daughter loved it.  I didn't tell her it was Turkey.

I rated this a 4 but with changes I made I would definitely rate a 5+.  I used 1 lb turkey 1/2 lb lean ground beef.  I used 2 cans of diced tomatoes/one can tomato soup and only one can of black beans. I also added green and yellow pepper and 1 can of green chiles.  I couldn't stop eating it!!!

I LOVE this recipe!  It tastes like regular beef chili!  I don't even dethaw the turkey-- I just throw it in the crock pot and stir a couple times throughout the day.  I make this recipe for friends who have babies because it freezes REALLY well.  Delicious!

Absolutely wonderful flavor in this chili. My family loved it and my father who claims to hate turkey anything devoured it. Will keep this one in rotation this fall/winter season.

My family LOVES this.  I have a 7yr old, 4yr old, and 2 yr old and they ALL scarf it down!  Instead of the beans listed, I put a can of chilibeans.  Also, I used 2 10oz cans of tomato sauce and a cup of water instead of tomato soup.  I serve it over corn chips or cornbread, and top with cheese, sour cream, green onions, and cilantro.  DELISH!!!!

INCREDIBLE!!!!  This was one of the best meals I've made in a long time.  Like others, I used one can of tomato soup, and one can of diced tomatoes.  As I was about to make my five year old chicken nuggets, he says "what's that delicious smell? I want some of that."  He had three helpings!!!

This was simple to make and pretty tasty. It had a very strong cumin taste though and was spicer then what my 8 year old could handle. I would either eliminate the cumin entirely or lessen it by half if I make it again. Otherwise a great recipe and very easy to make.

So great!!  I altered the 2 cans of soup as well and opted for 1 can diced tomatoes and one bottle of Heinz chili sauce and it worked perfectly!  I kept everything else the same but at the end I added frozen okra for some color since I LOVE okra and it was cooked and warm within minutes.  I did not measure out the spices just put in some of all.  What a wonderful recipe, thanks Laura!!

My husband and I loved this recipe. Instead of using regular tomato soup, we used organic and it was delicious! Also, we left out the red pepper flakes otherwise it would be too spicy. We exchanged the garlic powder for a chopped garlic clove. We left out the all spice. We added a dash of Lawry's season salt. We added a can of fiesta corn as well! We made a double batch so we could freeze some. Very yummy on a cold rainy night!

I'm not one to write a review, but this is definitely review worthy.  My father-in-law prides himself on his chili and the whole family thinks this recipe is better.  Great stuff.  i now make this all of the time.

My family loved this recipe.  My only changes were due to what I had on hand. I subbed a can of Rotel for 1 can of soup and black beans for the kidney beans. I served this with a cornbread souffle, sour cream and shredded cheddar.  This is my new go-to healthy chili recipe. Thanks, Laura!

My family LOVES this recipe!! This is one that satisfies everyone's tastebuds. I serve it with honey cornbread. My hubby and I love the cheese and sour cream topping. In fact I'm cooking it right, I added some cut up green bell peppers this time which is a great addition. Only thing with the recipe is when I followed it exactly it needed water added to it. Had I cooked it without I think the crockpot would've burned, I added like a cup or cup and 1/2 I think. But we LOVE LOVE LOVE it!!

This was pretty good chili; I'll probably make it again.  I browned the ground turkey, onion, and garlic on the weekend, then threw it all together one morning before work.  I only used 1 can of tomato soup, and replaced the 2nd can with a can of diced fire-roasted tomatoes.

I love this recipe!  I read reviews and added 1 can of diced tomatoes and 1/2 can of water.  I'm not a spicy food eater, but even I can handle this.  My husband (who is not fan of ground turkey) loves it too! It's a keeper!!

This is my favorite chili recipe and a crowd-pleaser every time. As suggested I switched the soup for 2 cans of diced tomatoes (and I usually look for the kind with some flavor already in it). I added one can of kidney and black beans and cut down the chili powder by 1/2 tbs since I'm not a huge fan of spicy food. I love that it's turkey and healthier than your average beef chili. And it's easy since all you do is dump the ingredients in the crock pot and let it cook.

Great recipe. Quick, easy and delicious. I did as other users suggested to replace the soup with 2 cans of  chopped tomatoes with chilis and found that it lacked moisture so I ended up adding 1/2 can tomato soup anyways. Thanks for the recipe!

I love this chili recipe! I did a lot of the same things there were suggested. I used only one can of tomato soup, 1/2 a can of water and omitted the red pepper flakes. I also added a little hot sauce and used lean ground turkey. To cut back on calories, I didn't use the oil to cook the turkey and it turned out fine. I also didn't use the onion because I don't like them. I would definately make this again on a cold winter day!

Great recipe with the perfect amount of seasoning for me.  My husband really liked it as well.  I'm a beginner and this was my first attempt at chili and this was a cinch.  I don't care too much for beans and like my chili thick so I took other reviewers suggestions and used only 1 can of tomato soup and 1 can of kidney beans.  I also added 2 chopped fresh roma tomatoes and it turned out great!

This was excellent!  Left out allspice (didn't have any) and used pickled jalapenos in place of pepper flakes (didn't have those either).  Added small can of enchilada sauce and then a small can of corn towards the end.  Really yummy!

I used hamburger even, and this is the best chili I have ever had! I don't like hot spicy, but this is perfect.. just enough kick to not be too bland. I also used white bean, kidney and black beans. Great combo, and a can of chunky cut tomatoes!!!! So filling, and just right. I am 21, and I will use this recipes for the rest of my life!

Delicious. I made some modifications, not because anything was lacking in the recipe, but either because I didn't have the right thing on hand or just wanted to. First, I used leftover roasted turkey because that's why I was making chili in the first place -- to use that up. I just added it in once I had everything else in except the spices. I did sautee the onions, along with the zucchini I added. Like other reviewers, I subbed a can of tomatoes (with mild chiles in this case) for one of the cans of tomato soup. I used the juice from the tomatoes to make up for the lack of liquid, and it was just right. I added one diced zucchini just because I've developed a taste for zucchini in my chili and I wanted it. I NEVER measure spices so I don't know how much of everything I used. To my surprise and chagrin, I did not have any cumin powder. I put in some paprika instead. Not nearly the same thing, but it was fine. I put hot sauce on the table so my husband and I could each get the heat we wanted. I did not cook this for hours and hours, and I don't think it's necessary. Sure, it gives more time for the flavors to meld, but if you're in a rush you can eat this within two hours of your start time. I also used a dutch oven (Le Creuset) instead of a crock pot. That and sauteeing the onion and zucchini deepened the flavors. I'm looking forward to my leftovers today now that the flavors have had a chance to really settle in! Overall, a very nice recipe.

I made some changes from the original recipe and the finished product was great.  I replaced one of the cans of tomato woup with a can of diced tomatoes, omitted the vegetable oil when I sauteed the turkey, added about 1/2 cup corn and didn't use any onions, I also added about 16 oz of tomato sauce as it cooked because it looked like it was going to be a bit dry.  Like I said, it came out great!  We enjoyed the turkey and didn't miss the usual beef!

Delicious!  It had just enough kick without being too much.  I let it simmer much longer than suggested so it got much thicker.  We've got some leftovers sitting in the freezer for a cold, dreary day.

holy "guns of navarone." i doubled the recipe and ended up with way too many beans for our tummys to handle. next time i'll cut down on the amount of beans. however, an awesome recipe. like others, i used diced tomatoes to substitute some of the tomato soup. also added a small handful of jalepenos; several pinches of pepper. next time i'll saute the onion before adding it into the slow cooker. my husband said it needed more "chili" flavor, so next time i may also add more chili powder to bring up that flavor profile.

Very good, made a couple changes though since I always have to :) ... added the juice of one lime, a small can of corn, can of diced tomatoes with green chilis instead of tomato soup, 1/2 can of water and a small can of green chilis.  One other thing, next time I make this, I will definitely double the recipe.  We like to leftovers for weekday lunchs and there's wasn't much left!

Very good basic chili. Like many others, I only used one can of tomato soup, and I added 2 cans of diced tomatoes with the juice. My beans were 1 can black beans, 2 cans red kidney beans, drained. I also added half a bag of frozen corn, which added nice color and texture. Spice-wise I only did 1 tablespoon of chili powder since my 5 year old doesn't like spice.   I also forgot to add the onion in the crockpot, but I chopped it up and added it to the top of my individual bowl, along with shredded cheddar cheese and some crumbled Fritos corn chips.  I'll definitely make it again, although I'll be hunting for something to add to give it a little more flavor.

Turned out great!! I even let the crock pot go too long (about 10 hours) and it was fine.  Turkey is a healthier option and people didn't even notice what it was.  =)

I used 1 can of tomato soup and 1 can of tomatoes with green chilies.  I also added some frozen corn.  Great chili for a cold winter's day in Ohio.  I make it every snow day :)

I followed some of the changes recommended by reviews, ie. I used white cannelloni kidney beans vs. the red ones, a personnel choice and I added Mexican corn and one can of chopped tomatoes and one tomato soup. It was gone in one sitting. My family loved this. Next time I will Dbl. the recipe. Thank you, this is going to be a staple in our family.

This chili is magnificent!  It delicious as written, but can be modified to suit whatever mood you're in.  I've made it with both ground beef and turkey and both work great!  Usually, I will use one can of black beans, one can of white beans, and one can of kidney beans.  I also use 2 cans of diced tomatoes with the liquid instead of the soup.  If I want it spicier, I will add a few dashes of hot sauce and paprika, and maybe some green chilles.  I always serve it with sour cream and cheddar cheese.  SO GOOD!

I made this for an alternative early Thanksgiving with some college friends. It was such a hit, and I couldn't ask for a simpler recipe. I got the wrong size cans of tomato soup, so I substituted 6 oz. tomato paste and about 1 cup of water, and it worked perfectly. I'll definately be keeping this recipe handy!

LOVED THIS!  I made some changes because my husband doesn't like beans and we love onions.  I left out the beans and added 1 lb of lean ground beef.  I roughly chopped and sauteed a large Vidalia onion by itself with olive oil spray, then added it to the browned beef and turkey (which I brown together in olive oil spray). I made my own allspice cuz I was out using a pinch of each of nutmeg, cloves, cinnamon. I used 1 1/2 tsp of salt.  I used 20 oz of turkey so I had to add 1/2 of a soup can of water.  Cooked on low all day and served with sour cream and cheddar, DELICIOUS!!

I made this chili this past weekend and I have to say, it was some of the best chili that I've had.  Similar to some of the other comments here, I made a few substitutions.  First off, I put 1 1/2 lbs of ground turkey in the recipe.  Also, I subsituted one can of tomato soup for a can of sliced tomatoes as well as another can of whole peeled tomatoes.  It was the hit of a Halloween party and am very much looking forward to making this dish again.

Excellent! My red meat eaters loved it. I reduced the chili powder to 1T, and it was moderately spicy. Would definitely make it again... and again!

I used 1 can of white navy beans, instead of an extra kidney bean can for more variety and color. I also didnt have tomato soup so i used Hunt's "Garlic and Herb" Spagetti sauce. It made it italian and tasty! The family loved it with warm hot corn bread! Frozen ground turkey works too. My family HATES onions so I use onion powder instead of chopped onions. You can always change any recipe to fit your families preferences. Im making this for a halloween party.

I used 1 can of soup and one can diced tomatoes w/ jalepanos. I cut back on the seasonings for my nephew to be able to eat it.3 Adults ate it for dinner and I might have 2 medium size bowls left for tommorrow. I also didn't brown the meat or onions I just dumped everything in the crockpot. I even used frozen ground turkey!

I had to use ground sirloin b/c that's what I had...(defeats the purpose of turkey chili, I know!) But this was very good! I added corn per another reviewer and it made it really hearty. I did use half the chili powder, my boyfriend does not like a lot of heat. It still had quite a kick to it but not overpowering.

Now I'm not really a chili fan, but I love this chili.  I don't even like beans, but I do in this chili.  Wonderful combination of flavors. We just topped with the shredded cheese.

I am eating this chili at the office for my lunch right now - and it is awesome! My boyfriend and I decided to make a pot of chili this weekend to bring for our lunches every day this week. It's chunkier than I am used to - but then again, i am used to runny, blended Cincinnati chili. Different, but I love it. I just e-mailed him and said "I LOVE THIS CHILI! I'm giving it 5 stars!" and I'm sure he'll agree! I topped mine with a sprinkle of cheese, but preferred to keep it healthier, so no chips or sour cream.

Okay, first of all I do not do the whole canned soup thing in recipes. I substitute tomato or marinara sauce, add some canned tomatoes and this is a great recipe. I also add a little red wine OR barbecue sauce (smoky) to cut the acid, which makes it a bit deeper and complex.

I was amazed at how delicious this recipe was, especially after I made it even healthier.  It was fast, easy, nutritious, and super delicious!  I used low-sodium kidney beans and low sodium black beans.  I added 1/4 cup water, and one can of diced tomatoes with green chiles.  I also added 1.5 cups of frozen corn the last hour of cooking.  Pair this recipe with "Excellent & Healthy Cornbread" and it will satisfy everyone in your home.  Thank you for this guilt free recipe!

I will make this chili again but, change a few things. I added chicken cooking stock (I thought this recipe was too thick) This is the only change I made and after cooking the chili in the slow cooker realized that the longer it cooked the better it tasted. Next time I will not use two cans of tomato soup.  Maybe one and then substitute the other with a can of chopped tomatos or tomato sauce. Maybe even omit the allspice.   I will also use 1/2 tsp. of red pepper flakes to suit our taste.  Other then that not a bad recipe.  Thank you and I will try this again.

Delicious and economical. I know chili recipes vary widely depending on the region, but this is good as-is, or as a point of departure for variations. I'll definitely be making this again, and I'll probably substitute a can of tomatoes, and add a clove of garlic and a green pepper to make it like Mom used to make... only gloriously spicier.

This came out very good.  I added some additional ingredients suggested by some previous reviewers, and used diced tomatoes with jalepeno added (it was still not too spicy, though, and I'm a wimp!).  I will make this again!

This recipe was phenominal. I only used 1 can of kidney beans and 1 can of corn. I also cut up red and green peppers and threw them in for some added color. I can't wait to make this recipe again.

Really easy and yummy!  I added some corn and didn't use onion.  It's easy to make the recipe a little spicier if you want to.  I have also made this with lean ground beef as well.

I leave out the allspice and add a little more chili powder as well as celery and canned corn.  This is so easy and allways gets rave reviews.  I've even done it minus the turkey for a veggie dinner night.

I followed the change suggestions listed by others.  This is a keeper for sure. My only complaint is that the turkey came out a little dry.  If there was some way of making the turkey a little more moist that would make this a 5 star chili for sure!!

This was good... but not so great and delicious that I would make it again. It was just missing 'something'. I'll keep looking for the perfect chili recipe.

Solid recipie. I followed the suggestions of some other folks and added a can of corn and some water.  I also omitted some of the beans because I don't care for them. I went with two cans of black beans and that was it.  I also left out the Cumin and the All Spice. I added green chiles too. I did not use ground turkey, but cubed up turkey breast instead.  It turned out pretty great.  The wife didn't seem to like it as much, so that is why it only gets 4 stars.

I just started to cook and use my crock pot and boy was this easy.  I used 100% turkey breast instead and didn't use the oil to brown it in the skillet.  I did add 2 cans of water b/c I bought condensed tomatoe soup (not too sure if that's the only kind anyway).  It was delicious!!!!! My husband loved it and is thrilled that after 8 years of marriage I'm cooking some amazing stuff.

Very tasty.  Many times I feel like turkey meat is chewier than beef, but in the crock pot, the turkey meat is perfect for the chili.  There was a good amount of spice to the chili, without it being overly hot.  Only complaint would be the amount of kidney beans.  Maybe one can would be enough.  Very good overall.

Awesome recipe! I only used one can soup and added 1 can of diced tomatoes, per others. I also did not add the red pepper and used only 1 lbs of chili powder as my family is rather wimpy lol. First time I made it with black beans and pinto beans, oh and I added a can of corn, drained. Second time I used white beans and both times it was delicious. My hubby loved it which is rare with turkey lol. This will be our new chili recipe! YUMMO!

So easy to throw together!  I took another reviewer's suggestion and sauteed the onion with the meat.  I also subbed one can of the tomato soup with a can of rotel.  I also added one 4 oz. can of diced chiles.  I made this for a party to save time for all the other food I needed to make, and I could not be more pleased!

So delicious and so easy to make. The only changes I made was exchanging one can of kidney beans for white beans and omitting the allspice because I couldn't find it in my cabinet.  I added sour cream and shredded cheddar when it was done.  Can't wait to have some leftovers!

It was delicious, i made 4 times as much as the recipe calls for, but i did use some suggestions others made. I added 2 cans Rotel diced tomatoes with chilies and 1 can corn drained. It was a big hit, i had sour cream and different kinds of grated cheeses and scoops corn chips to serve with it. I will be making this over and over again.

This is incredibly easy and tastes GREAT. I'm not a big fan of spicy foods so I leave out the red pepper flakes. I also use elk hamburger instead of turkey (it is incredibly lean) and add a couple cups of frozen corn.

This chili ROCKS!!!  I only modified it a bit by using 1 can of tomato soup, 1 can of tomato sauce and 1 can of rotel.  (Instead of the 2 cans of tomato soup)  I promise you- this made the BEST chili I have had in a LONG time.  I will make this over and over!

This was a great chili after cooking it. But we started tasting it before we cooked it in the crock pot. It was even more delicious cold. We probably ate a fourth of the bowl with chips before cooking it. Delicious! Next time I'm adding corn and serving cold with chips at our next party.

This chili is super-easy and always turns out great. Per the advice of other reviewers, I always use 1 can tomato soup and one can diced tomatoes with green chilis. I also add either 1 can tomato sauce or 1 can tomato paste and 1/2 cup water (we like our chili a little soupier). This chili is pretty spicy....but not too hot!

Great recipe! I was out of chili beans, so I substituted 3 cans of pork & beans. I drained and rinsed two of the cans and left the third as is for more liquid. It gave the chili a very slight sweet taste. Worked wonders!

This chili was great! This was my first time making chili and everyone loved it! I listened to the other review and added 1 can of diced tomato's and chili's in place of one can of tomato's.  We like spicy in my house so I used all the chili pepper and added some cayenne pepper for more flavor.  I added a can of corn for color and a little adobo because I like adobo on everything.  It turned out fantastic! My roommates used it for chili dogs and nachos.  Big hit. I will definitely make it again.

My first time using a slow cooker, and this was really easy! It's now in heavy rotation on our dinner menu. My husband loves tomatoes, so I add some diced tomatoes.

Great flavor - perfect for a chilly (chili?) night. Nothing better than a good slow-cooker recipe.

Excellent!  If my husband loves it then it is a winner...  He likes his chili thick and chucky.  He said it has a nice fresh and light flavor.  This will definitely be a repeat dish for us.

This recipe has become a favorite in my house!  I serve this when friends and family come over and everyone loves it!  The last time i made this, I added a bit more chili powder and it gave the chili more of a kick.  It surprised my husband but he LOVED it!

I followed some of the reviews, and skipped the tomato soup, and replaced it with 1 can of diced tomatoes, and another can of diced tomatoes with chilis.  
We are not huge fans of spicy food, so we reduced the pepper flakes to about 1/4 tsp.  We only put in 1 tbsp of chili powder, and doubled the garlic powder.
I also added 1 tbsp each of brown and white sugars (we like it a little sweeter!).

I chose not to add the red pepper flakes. I couldn't find low sodium tomato soup so I used Healthy Request tomato soup. In place of the two cans of kidney bean I added one can of light and one can of dark red Bush's beans for color variation.  Added a can of Hunt's diced tomatoes with green chilies also.  Very very good recipe.  My children loved it and asked for seconds and thirds!  Thanks for submitting this recipe!

Really nice chili. I toned it down a bit by omitting the red pepper flakes. I was worried about the amount of cumin but it turned out great. I also did as other reviewers suggested and substituted 1 of the cans of tomato soup for a can of chopped tomatoes and I did add a can of drained chilies with it.

Absolutly loved this recipe! My boyfriend raved about it to all his friends and he is not a fan of ground turkey (I didn't tell him that it wasn't hamburger!). I didn't use the slow cooker. I browned the turkey and combined all the ingredients into a dutch oven and let simmer. And I only used 1 tbsp of chili power and it was still hot!

Excellent!  Because I have two little girls and a pregnant wife, I made it a little less spicy and added slightly more garlic to make up for missing spice.  Still terrific.

We liked this chili.  I thought I had chili powder and found out mid-cooking that I didn't so I subbed taco seasoning for all the spices.  We also skipped the red pepper flakes because we don't like things too spicy.  We used one can of tomato soup and one can of diced tomatoes with green chile.

This was a yummy chili.I used a can each of black beans,white beans,and red kidney beans,which made it appealing to the eye.I wondered about the use of the allspice but, I think It really added that "something" special to this dish.I didn't want to use the soup so I used 2 cans of whole peeled tomatoes and smashed them after adding to the pot.I also added a little bit of chicken broth about 3/4c. because I was worried about it being to dry.All in all this was a great hearty chili.

This was excellent. My roommate and my boyfriend (and myself) devoured this chili.

I looked over a lot of the reviews, and followed many of the advice given.

I substituted 1 can diced tomatoes with green chili for 1 of the cans of tomato soup.  I added a handful of chopped peppers and a dash of cayenne.  I also browned the turkey the night before with the chopped onion. The most time consuming part of putting it together in the morning was opening the cans!!

This is a great chili recipe! I followed the recommendations by using only one can of kidney beans and adding a can of diced tomatoes w/green chiles in place of one can of tomato soup. No leftovers! I will definitely incorporate this into my winter rotation!

This chili was very easy to make. And it tasted delicious! I made this with all the ingredients in the recipe but cut back on the garlic powder a little. The spicyness was perfect for me and my boyfriend. We loved it!

This recipe is good, but it needed a few adjustments.  I followed it as is written, but added parmesan cheese (about 1/2 cup) and two small cans of tomato sauce.  It just seemed to be lacking a bit of flavor.  I did like the spicy aspect, but added even more red pepper flakes and chili powder.

This is easy to make, and it's easy to vary the level of hot-ness.  I like that it contains lots of lean protein.  I simmered on high for only two hours and the taste was well-blended and the chili was heated through.  I can't imagine chili without some kind of tomato, so I added approximately 1.5 cups of diced tomatoes.  This also made the consistency more soup-like than salsa-like.  Someone should try blending this recipe with nacho cheese (Velveeta) for chili con carne.

The ease and flavor was nice, but it needed something else...maybe a can of stewed tomatoes?  It was "dry", if that makes sense.  I'll try it again with something added for sauce next time.

This is one of the BEST chili recipes I have ever made!!!  The only thing I did differently was to use 1lb. of ground turkey & 1lb. of ground turkey sausage & then went with the other ingredient substitutions noted by other readers.  My husband & male friends LOVED it!!!

I doubled the recipe and used only 1 can of soup, and used whole and chopped tomatoes with chilies as a substitute. I found the chili to have quite a kick! Maybe that was because I was a little short of beans. But it was fantastic! I also added 2 peppers for health and flavor.

Really great!  We did add a can of chili-ready tomatoes and a can of water in addition to the recipe.

It was really fantastic - a little too spicy for my toddlers, but my husband and I thought it was really yummy!

Used 1 can low sodium beef broth and 1 can tomato soup for a heartier flavor.  Also used 1 can black beans, 1 can pinto and 1 can white beans for added fiber and flavor.  I made several times and sometimes throw in corn.

Very good and easy!  Used ground chicken, replaced one can of soup with a can of tomatoes w/green chiles, and only used one can of (black) beans.  Excellent flavor!  Also, in my opinion not too spicy - just a good spice!

I thought this was really easy and delicious. Based on other reviews I made a few small changes 1) cooked onion with meat, 2) substituted one can soup with one can chopped tomatoes with chilis and 3) only used half amount of red pepper flakes called for. It was easy to prepare and was perfect chili on a cold evening watching football

We all liked this.  It cooked down to no juices so we're going to make chili dogs for a quick dinner tonight.  I cooked on high for 3 1/2 hours and it was burning to the sides.  Watch the cook time on this!

This was so simple to put together, and it was delicious. I prepared everything the night before and then turned on the slow cooker at lunch time the next day. It was ready and waiting for supper time!

My husband loved this which was good because he hasn't been impressed with any other chili I made.  I cut the chili powder in half like others suggested and I added a can of whole kernel corn (drained).  I ended up using about 1-1/2 pounds of turkey so I added another can of soup and shook in a little bit of extra spices.  I'm making it again tonight hopefully it passes the mother-in-law test.  Thanks for the recipe!

I followed this recipe exactly except I left out the red pepper flakes and it came out perfect.  It wasn't spicy at all but was full of flavor.  My 1 and 4 year old boys loved it!!!

I love this recipe, I make it all the time in the cool months. I can eat it for days until it's gone. I use a little less kidney and a little more black beans still very delicious. Also add alot more red pepper flakes to kick it up a notch!

I love doing slow cooker chili.  It's so easy.  Here's the things I did differently: 1 larger can of kidney beans (19oz I believe) instead of two cans, added a can of corn, added two jalapenos, added a little more red pepper flakes, subtracted one can of tomato soup, added a half can of water for moisture.  Came out great!  My fiance said it was too spicy but I like it that way.  She's able to eat it with some bread on the side.

This was really excellent.  We toned down the spices for the kiddies and added some extra veggies -- zucchini, celery, carrots and some frozen corn right at the end.  Served with a side of cornbread, it made a great midweek meal!

I love this recipe for tasty chili.  I don't use canned beans, and I add an extra can of tomato soup and two cans of water to help cook the beans.

This was fantastic!  I doubled the recipe for a Super Bowl party and served with corn bread, sour cream and shredded cheese.  I used lean ground beef instead of turkey and sauteed the onions on low heat for about 10 minutes before adding them to the slow cooker - delicious!

This was a great recipe that the entire family enjoyed.  Even the 5 and 3 year old ate it.  I added a can of corn and that even made it taste better.  Top it with cheese and Fritos if you are not looking for a low cal dish.

Great!!!  I followed some of the recommendations provided by other reviewers...  Substituted one can of tomato soup with diced tomatos w/chiles, only half of the recommended chili powder (just enough heat)and added a can of corn.  Delicious!!

LOVE THIS!!! I had a favorite chili recipe that I made for years before stumbling upon this one. This is my new fave and I've made it over-and-over the last few months. It's super easy and my 3 kids and husband eat it up.
Thank you!

I cooked the onion first in a splash of beer, then browned the turkey. Added a great flavour. Great for freezing in single servings.

I like this chili well enough that I make it all the time.  I do omit onions because no one in the house likes them, but otherwise I usually make it as is.  It is very spicy, so you can tone down some of the spices if you don't like spicy chili.

We had this tonight and I will never make another chili recipe again. This was great and it is a low fat, high fiber meal. Even my 3 year old son loved it. I used minced dried onion flakes instead of fresh onion, just to save time. I didn't have any allspice or red pepper flakes so I omitted those. Served with low fat sour cream, this was yummy! My husband says I can make this once a week!

This is a staple in our home.  We also use a can of the diced tomatoes in place of one can of tomato soup.  Everyone loves it, and the spices are perfect for our taste.

Great blend of flavors -- I too subbed one can of diced tomatoes for sauce and stuck with one can of beans (kidney) and it was fantastic! I've just set up a second batch using ground beef.

Good recipe!  Of course I can't help but add extra spices to everything.  But the base was good.  I also added a 28 oz can of diced tomatoes and cooked it on low 10 hrs in crockpot.

A wonderful recipe. Used 1 can of soup and 1 of chopped tomatoes. Added 1 tbsp of brown sugar. Made this for my husband's poker night and they couldn't stop eating it, even after leaving it on warm in the slow cooker for hours. Thanks!

This was perfect with turkey leftovers. Took me 5 minutes to throw this together. I added a white bean instead of a kidney to have a bigger variety. Instead of the two cans of tomato soup I added to cans of tomato juice and one can of diced tomatoes. You will need more liquid for the recipe! Oh, I also added a can of drained corn and made cornmeal muffins to go along with the chili. This would be great with leftover rolls from Thanksgiving too.

Came out a little thicker than most chilis - would probably used some canned tomatoes instead of the tomato soup.

I don't know if it was my fault, but this did not have any flavor at all.  I am going to try it with ground beef next time to see if that makes a difference.

Great recipe!  I subbed a can of navy beans for the black beans (it's what I had on hand), only used 1 can of kidney, and substituted a can of diced tomatoes for one can of soup.  My boyfriend and I both loved this but we didn't find it to be spicy in the least.  Maybe it's the Texan in us but we both thought it was pretty mild.  I'll definitely make it again but next time I'll add a bit more spice.

This was absolutely amazing. I didn't have kidney beans so I substituted white cannelini beans. Otherwise I followed the recipe as written and my husband won't stop raving about it.  I should mention this was the first time I've ever used a slow cooker and this was a great recipe for the maiden voyage :)

This recipe was fabulous!! My fiancee's coworkers tasted it and begged me to make it for them!  I added green beans and corn for more veggies and a jalapeno for some kick! Definitely a keeper :)

Excellent! I also used one can of diced tomatoes to replace one can of the soup and only one can of kidney beans. I also added cayenne pepper and some hot sauce. I like things spicy! I'm single so I saved a bunch in the freezer to eat later. Yum!

Not bad.  I really like the spices.  I think I'm just not a fan of kidney beans in chili.  I may try again with pintos.

Not the best chili I have ever eaten but certainly was not unpleasant.  Will not make again.

I made several substitutions to incorporate items I had on hand but the spices were not modified and are key to my dissatisfaction.

In the interest of fairness here are my substitutions. I used ground chicken instead of turkey; 2 cans of black and 1 can of kidney beans, all well rinsed; regular tomato soup but did not add any salt; and I used cooking spray instead of oil when I browned the meat.
