I had my reservations about my ability to make these, they look like they take alot of time and patience. But they were so very easy and fun to make, and the ones that did not look perfect had a little character! I made some with little hats, and some without. I made these as a test for my annual Halloween party and I will absolutely serve them this year!

I made these for my family last Halloween, and they were a hit! So easy to make and very filling. They are best with plain yellow mustard.

I made these last year for halloween. They were a lot of work for something so small but they make a nice impact on your table. I took this general idea and make something similar with regular hot dogs year round. I take small biscuit dough and smoosh them down and wrap each hot dog with 1.5 biscuits. Then I just bake them according to the biscuit instructions. We call them biscuit dogs, and we love them. I started using biscuit dough instead of crescent rolls because they are less fat. My dss likes them better, go figure.

I love holiday treats that aren't full of sugar!! Every fun recipe for kids  seems to be cookies or candy.  We made these in our toaster oven in minutes.  I homeschool my kids and we are learning about Egypt right now.  Making these edible mummies was a very enjoyable project.. Coincidentally it being so close to Halloween this was a perfect recipe for my kids to do! They are bite size and my boys just loved them.  Great recipe for little hands, with no real worry of working with raw ingredients such as eggs or meat. Being that small children loooove to put everything in their mouths.   In fact my boys want to make them again on Halloween, using regular sized hot dogs

Made these for my halloween party and had none left. I rolled the entire sausage with the dough, pinched both ends to seal and then cut across the front to make space for a face. Stayed together perfectly. Will do again for sure.

This is a really cute idea that was easy to make up for a Halloween supper! Just a note -- make sure the hot dogs have cooled some before putting the "face" on with condiments...otherwise it won't stick!

Yummy Mummy! So fun to serve these at a Halloween party for a bunch of college kids ~ they went very quickly. It took quite some time to wrap the crescent dough strips around them, but the wow factor was worth it. Serve with a bowl of mustard &/or ketchup. I strongly recommend using the beef Lit'l Smokies®, because they have a good & smokey flavor. I do not recommend the pork-chicken Lit'l Smokies®, because those taste exactly like hot dogs.

This is such a fun recipe! Maybe I am slow, but for me it was pretty time consuming, but turned out so cute! Was the first thing to go at the Halloween party we attended (and there were TONS of food choices!)  Enjoy!

These were the first to run out of at our party. Had other hot food, but everyone wanted these. I should have doubled the recipe for sure. They went real fast!! Would make them again, for sure.

A little time consuming but well worth it. Served at a halloween party and my kids loved these and preferred over pizza! They were so cute! I used the all beef smokies.

the kidies loved these...! I used full sized hot dogs, served them with chili and cornbread (for the adults who ate the Mummy Dogs too)... patting dry the hot dogs before adding the dough will helps it stay in place... I also used the small to go packets of mustard to master the Mummy faces...

These are so cute and easy to make...I cut a regular size hot dog in half and made 2 mummies per dog. Then when I served them I am able to stand them up flat hot dog side down on a platter and they looked adorable and kids & adults love them:-)

These were easy to make and a huge hit at my Halloween party! I found that using a pizza cutter to make the strips really made the process easy and they made a nice savory compliment to all my Halloween candies and desserts.

These are always a big hit at Halloween.  I use hot dog weiners and they are more of a meal.  Let the kids help wrap the crescent rolls around, get them involved in the meal, and they will love it!  Also great snack for playdates or anytime.  You can also wrap the crescents on top in a santa hat shape (pyramid/triangle) for Christmas...

Tasted great... I went through all the trouble to make them into mummies, but didn't have a chance to make the faces!  Everyone was hungry so it went pretty quick!

Loved this idea! I would have to go too far to get crescent dough and didn't want to make my own, so I made these using Puff Pastry (recipe on this site) and it was so delicious! Yummy! I rolled out the puff pastry and cut them into thin strips and wrapped the mini dogs in them. Then when they came out of the oven, I dotted two eyes only with ketchup and ate these with Fry Sauce (recipe also on this site) for dipping. Thanks for the cute idea.

I used whole hotdogs sliced in half the long way and wrapped a whole triangle of crescent dough around each.  They still had a mummy look, just no head wrap.  Good balance of dog to dough and not such a choking hazzard for little chewers.  My husband and I even liked these.

Oh, these mini-mummies are so good! They were quick and easy to make. I used the 'seamless' crescent roll dough and cut it into strips while my daughter wrapped the lit'l smokies. Wanted to snap a picture but as soon as they hit the table on Halloween night, they were scarfed up by kids and grown-ups alike. LOVE this recipe!

I just added this recipe and already made these twice!  I am a vegetarian, so I obviously had to modify it.  I used Yves Good Dogs (veggie dogs, found in the produce department of most grocery stores... where the tofu is.  You can also use "smart dogs," just make sure you don't use frozen veggie dogs) and cut them in half to form one "lit'l smokie."   I then followed the recipe exactly as written (except I used reduced fat cresent rolls, which tasted exactly the same as regular, but with less fat!).  Use a toothpick to spread the mustard on the exposed part of the dog to make the face look good!    These were DELICIOUS!!!  Even my meat-loving parents found these absolutely amazing.  Try this modification for a less-fat/healthier version of the "mummy dogs."  You won't be disappointed!

These were the hit at the party!  They are very tasty.  I used a bottle of French's Yellow Mustard for the faces.  I squirted straight out of the bottle, but it came out a little too thick to make the faces look cute.  I would recommend either a thicker mustard or use a thin icing tip with mustard to make them look really good.

Give yourself plenty more time than the recipe suggests for prep time. It took me an hour to make 60 mummies (doubled recipe) ready to cook. I used a pizza cutter to cut each dough rectangle into 12-14 (long side) strips. Then I'd roll one strip away from the rectangle and as I did I would roll it out a little until it was almost double in length. I would then use one whole strip to do the bottom of the mummy. I would roll out the next strip and use half of it to do the top of the head. This seemed to speed things up once I figured that part out...though it still took a lot of time.

Clearly I don't need to rate this recipe as so many others already have but I guess I just feel the need to put in my "two cents"!

Definitely 5 stars on taste, although whoever decided the prep time was only 20 minutes either had like 10 go go gadget arms or a horde of little elves helping them!  In reality they are INCREDIBLY time consuming, especially if you put the faces on (took me like 2.5 hours to wrap and draw faces on 2 small packages (~60?).  Granted, I can be a bit of a perfectionist so it's probably possible to do it in less time but I really don't see how you could do more than about 1 per minute so seriously plan on at least an hour for the prep work.  I don't like yellow mustard so I used BBQ sauce, which I thickened by cooking down in the microwave (not too much or it just makes a huge ball on the end of your toothpick).  When you bake them the faces darken even more so you can clearly see them, even if they are a little faint when you first draw them on.  

I will definitely make these again but in the future I will just quickly wrap the croissant around the smokie instead; it was fun to do, ONCE- but never again!  :o)

These were a HUGE hit at my son's preschool halloween party.  The teachers loved it because it wasn't more sweets and the kids loved gobbling mummies!  Quick tip, wait until the smokies are cool or just before the party to apply the little mustard faces...otherwise they run or dry out and become a little transparent over time.  These were much easier to make than I thought and now we make them quite often just for snack time!

One of my kids' favorite treats. This can also be made with reduced fat crescent roll dough, cheddar Lit'l Smokies and an optional dip on the side that my kids like is either chili sauce mixed with grape jelly or BBQ sauce.

Fun, easy, tasty and cute!  I must admit, not all of our "mummies" look as good as the stock photo, but a quite a few came out really well.  The taste can't be beat and they really our adorable.

So cute! I called them little babies in a blanket. You can only see the faces if you dab them with mustard on a toothpick. Ketchup doesn't show up. They burn easy on the bottom so I'm deducting a star. And the croissant dough is a hassle to deal with but it's worth it for a party.

These were easy and fun to make. I did not add the "hats" on them and they ended up looking like wrapped up toes. Still they were a hit at our Halloween party! Thanks for the recipe!

These were a huge hit with my son!  Although I've made these just as regular pigs in a blanket, I never thought of making them "Mummys" for Halloween.  Perfect spooky snack!  Thanks for the idea!

Worth the effort; the biggest hit of my halloween appetizers! I did some with pigs in a blanket dough and some with crescent dough, and the crescent was far better.

I let everything come to room temperature before I started wrapping the mummies.  When wrapping them, I started at the middle of the Little Smoky and rolled it outward toward the end.  When I wrapped for the hood over its head I started in the middle and rolled outward toward the other end.  I used the mustard as "glue" and used dry pepper flakes as the eyes and mouth.  I'll post a picture later.

Getting the li'l smokies wrapped up is more difficult than you would anticipate. But in the end, it's a fun, spooky, finger-food for Halloween :)

These were great. We're more fond of using hotdogs now but for a smaller serving, these are perfect!

These are great for Halloween night right when the kids are about to go trick or treating. They eat them up extremely fast and you're sure that they have something in their stomachs other than candy. Wonderful!

Cute seasonal variation for the typical pigs in a blanket that my kids love anyway.  Great for halloween food fare.  I used smokie links and buttermilk biscuits since that's what I had on hand.

These are so fun and cute!  Great for kids, but my (adult) boyfriend loves them too.  They take a little more time than just wrapping croissant style, but for a spooky treat it's totally worth it!

These are tasty and fun to make! I also like to use full size hotdogs with a rectangle of dough for each.

I made these for Halloween for the children but they were equally enjoyed by the adults. Had I known they would be such a hit I would have made a few extra dozen. I used regular franks in place of the sausage or baby franks.  They came out soooooooooo cute. Will repeat this one next year.
