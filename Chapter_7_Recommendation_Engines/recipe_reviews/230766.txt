Oh, YUM!  What a deliciously wonderful salad!  The dressing is just perfect!  The only change I made was to omit the collard leaves.  Otherwise this recipe is plain perfect!  I want to arrange a dinner party just to present this salad!  Thank you very much for the recipe!

I made this salad two nights in a row and each time I was assembling the ingredients I was thinking, "really??" But it works! And it's amazing! There are a lot of ingredients but it comes together very quickly and is beautiful to boot! That said, I had to make some changes... no collard greens or romaine at the store, so I used boxed spring mix and more kale; no orange pepper; toasted almond slivers instead of walnuts; half a small red cabbage; cut the oregano to 1/2 tsp (I don't like oregano). Leftovers are okay because the dressing doesn't soak everything. Just incredible!

I just made the vinaigrette from this recipe and added it to my salad along with avocado. It is delicious! I'm never buying store bought dressing again. Fresh is so much better!

Loved this salad!  All the different ingredients made for wonderful flavour combinations.  I didn't have collard greens, so used spinach and spring mix greens instead.  The dressing was really nice.  My husband commented on the dressing, as well as how nice the pears were.

I LOVE this.  I hadn't ever used collard greens in a salad before, but I am so glad we tried it... the kids couldn't get enough.  The crunch and the depth of flavor from all the greens is amazing.  I would recommend NOT replacing with spinach ('tho I love a good spinach salad!) because it's just such a wonderful, unique change of flavor.

This review is for the dressing only. I was looking for a MyPlate homemade salad dressing and came across this one. The ingredient list looks very strange to me. I'm not sure I would have ever made it had all the reviewers before me not given this salad a glowing report. I'm so glad I did though. The dressing is delicious, and just a little gives great flavor to the salad. Definitely a keeper!

My family and I have enjoyed this salat tonight and it was loved by ALL!!!
The receipe is spot on. The crunch of greens and veggies and walnuts, along with savory flavors and hint of sweetness  of the dressing and pear.  Lastly it looked fabulous and is super healthy. ITS A WINNER.

Best salad I have ever had! Used kale and regular mixed salad and toasted almonds instead of walnuts.

I made this incredibly delicious salad as a main dish. There were no collard greens available so I used a little more kale. The salad is full of texture and flavour.

Delicious!! I used spinach instead of collard greens, but otherwise I followed the recipe. The dressing was really good as well. I'll be making this again.

This is a great salad. Tons of flavor in the dressing. I substituted spinach for the collards. Other than that I followed the recipe and it was a big hit. Will definitely make this again.

I made a few changes only because I used what I had.  I didn't have collard greens or kale, so I used baby spinach and romaine.  I also used an apple instead of a pear and left out the tomato.  The dressing was very good and the salad was a big hit with my family! I think I will make this again exactly the way I made it!  Yummy!!

I love salads but I hate making them. This recipe took me a bit more time to assemble than I care for. The flavors of all the different ingredients are very tasty. I will try to make this again. Don't substitute anything as it is terrific the way it's written.

This was a masterpiece salad for me.  I followed the recipe ingredients (measurements not exact - what is 5/8 of a head of cabbage?) using half a small head.  The colors and flavors were superb and I definitely plan to do this again!  Family loved it!  It really is a meal all by itself.

This was a tasty salad but there were so many elements you couldn't get them all in one bite.  As a result, as you eat, you're asking yourself "wait, was that raisins or was that avocado".  As Posen says on Project Runway "learn to edit yourself."  I think this salad would benefit from a little editing. The only thing I did different was not use collard leaves, and they were not missed.  The dressing was good.  At first I only used 1 tsp. chilli powder because I was worried it would be too spicy, but after tasting it I ended up using the whole 1-1/2 tsp.

I made this for Dinner Club, last night, 11/17/19.  Received lots of compliments.  The dressing was quite good, and sturdy enough to stand up to all these ingredients.   Everyone loved the little bit of heat that the chili powder gave.  Very colorful, and just a note:  Sizing up for 8 servings gave me more than enough salad for 12, even without the collards, which I did not have.

I made this salad for a family gathering. Everyone loved it and several people went back for seconds. This was also my first taste of collard greens and I was pleasantly surprised.

The salad dressing for this salad is so good!  It’s got depth and warmth and is what make the salad unique. I will use the dressing with other salads as well.  All said regarding the dressing the mix of greens is great too.  Very hearty and very yummy!  Will be making again.

This was good, but for all the time and ingredients that went into it, I'd expect this salad to wow me, and it didn't. I've made other salads that were simpler and more flavorful and interesting, so for me this isn't a keeper.

This salad is very good, but I would say it takes more like an hour to prep it - there are so many ingredients!  I used the Collard greens, but I'm not sure I could taste their addition.  Since I was making it for a large party, I increased the Kale, and doubled most everything else except the onion and cabbage.  I also didn't double the oil, but I did double the other dressing ingredients. Not sure this is an outstanding salad, but it was good, and the leftovers were good the next day, even after sitting in the dressing since it doesn't wilt.  I happened to taste it with a candied walnut (someone else's salad mixed with mine), and it was really good!  Not sure I would make this again, but for a kale salad, it was good.

Most pople think that late fall and winter are seasons when salads are off the menu - NOT TRUE!  This salad uses greens that are in-season and the dressing is fabulous.  Simple, good for you and tasty.  Give it a try.

Pretty good. I think I'll come back for more. Just that.. this salad has lots of ingredients. I personally think the raisins are a MUST. It adds so much flavour to the salad. I like the nuts too. Overall, it is a great recipe!

Great taste but the servings are wrong. This recipe serves way more than 4 servings. This is enough for a crowd.

Fabulous salad! Made it to take to a friends house for dinner and made it again the next day for home :) The salad dressing is very good, that I will make to go with other salads! Thanks for sharing this recipe.

We loved the tastes, textures, and colors of this salad. No bermuda onion, though--it's a spring onion, not too suitable for a winter salad. There are lots of substitutes, though.

Really didn't expect this salad to be as good as it was.  I normally wouldn't put kale and collards in a salad but I followed the directions almost exactly ( subbed dried cranberries for raisins and sunflower seeds for walnuts). It was a huge hit at a family dinner.  The dressing is outstanding!  Lots of chopping, though.  It took me more than  30 minutes to prep including washing and spinning the greens.

This is a hit!  I used Apple instead of pear and craisins instead of raisins. Everyone wants this recipe!

There is nothing NOT to like about this salad.  

Substitutions I made because it is what I had on hand included:
craisins instead of raisins, 
Penzeys Tuscan Sunset herbs instead of oregano (I'm not too crazy about oregano), 
Penzeys Ancho chili pepper.  

We live in Italy and avocados aren't that easy to find, so unfortunately I had to do without.  It would have been great to have them.

The salad dressing is really superb--and I'll use it again and again.   Thanks for posting this great recipe.

Excellent salad, particularly the dressing. I didn't use all of the same vegetables, but I followed the dressing recipe exactly, and it was well-received. I will make this again.  (I used Bibb lettuce, kale, green onions, orange peppers, an Anjou pear, cherry tomatoes and walnuts)

Wonderful! Seems flexible to whatever you have on hand. I used half the dressing for one large bunch of chard cut into thin ribbons, with the avocado, pear, red onion, red bell pepper, and almond slivers. Will definitely make this again.
