This is one of the best pound cakes I've ever tasted or made.  Used 2 1/2 cups of mashed canned sweet potatoes (1 40oz can) and sweetened it with a little brown sugar, extra cinnamon and nutmeg.  Used a pineapple glaze instead of orange.  A delicious soft, moist masterpiece. Will make again and again!

This is an excellent cake.  I made the recipe as written & it could not have been more perfect.  Great texture and wonderful flavor (slightly milder & less dense than pumpkin).  I pureed the sweet potato rather than mashing it, and I only had to bake my cake for about an hour.  I am a pastry chef & am very fussy about my cakes, and I will be using this one again.  Great cake!

This cake is marvelous.  I can't keep it around long enough.  I changed the flour to cake flour and it is even better.  It's a real hit with my friends

I'm an avid baker and this one is a keeper!  Perfect for Thanksgiving or Christmas or any other time you want a moist, spiced cake that smells heavenly.  I used fresh sweet potatoes and everyone was so impressed with the taste.  I think I'll add raisins to the mix next time to see how it comes out.

This cake was DELICIOUS! But I recommend using cake flour instead of all-purpose.  It tastes a 1000% better that way!

This cake is awesome!  I used Bruce's canned mashed sweet potatoes (just sweet potatoes - no additional ingredients) instead of cooking and mashing fresh sweet potatoes.  It has been a hit every time I make it!

I made this for a ladies luncheon.  While I enjoyed it immensely and thought it was great, not one of the ladies asked for the recipe, which is highly unusual for them.  Instead of the glaze, I frosted it with Allspice Cream Cheese Frosting from this website, and it was very attractive.  I found that the cake only needed to bake 1 hour and 5 minutes in my oven.  Good thing I checked it then instead of letting it bake the entire hour and 20 minutes or I would have had a burnt cake!

Absolutely Wonderful! I highly recommend this recipe. My family could not get enough. Before my husband could finish his second piece, he told me to make another tonight. I tweaked this recipe some for our family taste buds:I added extra 1/2 tsp vanilla, decreased nutmeg to 1/4 tsp, after creaming butter and sugar.,I added one egg at a time, then added two cups of hot mashed sweet potatoes, followed by flour mixture, lastly I added vanilla. Only baked for 35-40 minutes. Baked in Bundt cake pan.Wonderful golden/orange color. Immediately inverted to cake plate to cool.Cake was so good, I didn't even bother to make orange confection glaze. Cake was moist, dense, but not heavy like a brick. This cake could pass as a soft sweet potato loaf depending on what you bake it in. Again, fantastic recipe. Highly Recommended. This recipe is a keeper. Enjoy!

This was a delicious recipe.  I used the cake flour as recommended by other reviewers.  I also did not need to bake it for the full 1 hr. 20 min. -- went about 55 minutes and it was well done.  I will definitely make this again, perhaps bake for about 5 minutes less.  Tastes like a spice cake.

Since I just learned how to use my kitchen, I am always looking for easy recipes for food days at work.  THIS IS IT!  I used canned sweet potatoes instead of fresh to save time.  Friends and family all want this recipe.  Take it from me, I currently have an icky mess in my kitchen that was supposed to be fudge.  I will stick to this recipe from now on.

This cake was amazing...I am not usually the biggest fan of pund cakes, but now I have definitely changed my mind.  I had it in the oven for no more than an hour. More than that would have made it dry.  I also used cake flour.  It was perfectly moist.  I made double the amount of orange icing and mixed the zest in with it as well to give it extra flavor.  While the cake was still hot I poked a few holes in the top with a fork and poured on half of the icing.  This made the orange flavor sink into the cake.... DELICIOUS!  After the cake cooled I topped it off with the rest of the icing.  A great way to use up left over sweet potato caserole.

I would give this one 10 stars if I could! This is SOOOOO good. I made this for my husband for Father's Day. He said it was one of the best, if not THE best pound cakes he has ever had! This is a HUGE compliment because his mom has made fantastic pound cakes his whole life. I am a novice at pound cakes and it turned out so yummy! I microwaved the sweet potatoes (it took 3 med/large ones). I added them hot which melted the butter. If this happens to you, decrease the cooking time by 20-25 minutes. (I will make it every time this way! It cuts the prep./cooking time substantially.)

I made this late on Thanksgiving Eve - discovered after I mixed it all up that I didn't have a tube pan so I had to use an old bundt pan. I also tried to pop it out of the pan too soon after it came out of the oven. It broke in half but it still tasted delicious. Our family was pleasantly surprised to have yet another dessert option on Thanksgiving. Thanks.

awesome pound cake! I like extra spice, so I added 2 tsp of cinnamon instead of 1, and 1/4 tsp of ground cloves. I also added 3/4 cup of ground walnuts. I'm lazy so for the glaze I used dulce de leche from a jar. My husband and daughter loved it!!

I have been making this recipe for years and it is always a hit. Instead of a tube or bunt cake pan I use two loaf pans (This recipe will make enough for two loaf pans). I  bake till a toothpick comes out clean. I start checking around 45 minutes into the baking.

09/07/10 - I made this again for a Labor Day barbeque and also made cinnamon whipped cream topping with cinnamon oil that just made this pound cake sing. I also used slightly more sweet potato and added some vanilla yogurt and an additional egg.  I dusted the pan with a cinnamon/sugar blend instead of flour before placing in the oven to bake. This cake is just wonderful, flavorful and an elegant dessert.  07/15/10 I make large batches of homemade dog food twice a month and sweet potatoes is a key ingredient so I always have cooked sweet potato on hand.  I made this last night and with two people in the household only 1/2 of the cake is left today.  Great moist, dense and flavorful cake.  Loved this, wonderful flavor and great color.

This week at our school we had a multi-cultural day, and I was representing the American South.  Making a zillion sweet potato pies was too hard, so I found this recipe and decided to try it.  EVERYONE that tried it absolutely adored it, and many came back for seconds.  I'm glad that I made two cakes!  I would recommend this cake to anyone.  Thanks for the recipe!

Now when I saw the orange glaze, i knew i had to have cardamom in this recipe! I cut the cinnamon down to 1/4 tsp, nixed the nutmeg, and added 1 1/4 tsp ground cardamom (next time, I think I will add even more). I went with the cake flour suggestion as well as reducing the sugar to 1 1/4 cup (this is only if you don't enjoy really sweet cakes; i prefer enjoying the flavors of the spices and sweet potato).I also reduced just two tablespoons of confectioners sugar down with the orange zest and juice on the stove, and using a mixture of water, lemon juice and cornstarch to thicken it up to glaze consistency; it gives it a really nice tart flavor that compliments the cake very well.

I love this recipe. I printed it on Friday and made it on Sunday evening.  I substituted 2 cups of my "special" sweet potatoe pie filling for the
2 cups of mashed sweet potatoes. It was a hit my husband and the ladies at the beauty salon said it is WONDERFUL!!!!!

Excellent. I served it for Easter and the orange color and flavor were nice and springy. SECOND TIME AROUND: Still wanting more orange flavor, I halved each of the spices and substituted Grand Marnier for the vanilla--very good; less "spice cakey" and more orange. THIRD TIME: left out all the spices called for and used 1 1/2 t cardamom and again, the Grand Marnier instead of vanilla. So good!

I can't believe I'm actually writing another review, but this was really good, per all the raves I got. I also did 1c. white, 1 c. brown sugar. I'm a little stingy when it comes to my real butter so I did use 1 stick butter,1 stick margerine. Bake according to what u know ur oven can do. My bundt only took 55-60 mins. Had to give quite a few  saran wrapped slices away because it was toooooo dangerous to keep in the house.(Yes, that Good!) Very moist. Oh yeah, and I didn't use any glaze. This cake holds it's own. I'm already getting request for full cakes.

I've been baking this cake since 12/31/2000. Family and friends love it. I've stuck to the original recipe, baking for just 60 minutes and it comes out perfect. This cake is a must for the Thanksgiving and Christmas seasons.

This is pretty tasty.  I didn't use the glaze because I didn't feel the need to add more sugar to a perfectly sweet cake. Next time I'll add a little orange zest to the cake if I omit the glaze. It was moist and had a delicate crumb.  The light spice flavor is perfect with a dollop of homemade whipped cream on top.  You can also bake it in two 8.5" x 4.5" loaf pans for about an hour.

Just made this one a few hours ago as one of our Christmas desserts.  It's wonderful.  I modified the recipe just slightly by substituting 1/2 cup brown sugar for part of the white sugar.  Also, instead of the orange glaze, I made a maple brown sugar glaze using butter, brown sugar, maple syrup, and half n' half (to smooth it out).  Both my husband and I have tasted a small slice and it's incredible.  I'll definitely use this recipe again.

Made this for my family over Thanksgiving.  Everyone loved it.  will definitely make it again.  I do recommend NOT cooking for 1 hr. 20 minutes.  My cake was done in about an hour.  I will also change the orange glaze to a lemon for a tangier flavor.

The cake was very good, my suggestion is; when mashing the sweet potatoes include a can of cream of coconut(goya)and orange juice

This is a great recipe.  I made it for Christmas and everyone loved it.  It was really moist and orange glaze added great flavor.  I will definitely be making again.

This recipe is also another keeper! I used 1 cup of sugar instead of two, and I used freshly ground cinnamon. It tasted wonderful! It almost tasted like a pumpkin bread. Next time I want to try different glazes just to experiment but this cake was quite good!

I just made this for our Thanksgiving meal...Oh my goodness this was the best dessert by far! I did modify the recipe a bit but I think as written it would have been great anyway....Instead of the full amount of white sugar I used half white and half brown sugar...I did add a bit more vanilla, just for personal taste...After reading the reviews I came across someone saying they used a brown sugar glaze over it...I couldn't find a recipe for brown sugar glaze, so I made something up. I melted a stick of butter added some brown sugar (just eyeballed it) and a shot of vanilla extract...I baked the cake in a springform pan, and let it rest for a few minutes. I put it on a cake platter poked several holes in it with a wooden skewer and poured the glaze over the cake...The outcome? The most moist wonderful light cake I have ever had!!! Great recipe, this is a keeper and will be on my families table every holiday! Thank you!

Loved it. This cake came out very moist and tasted just like sweet potato pie.  I sprinkled a little brown sugar, cinnamon and nutmeg to the mashed sweet potatoes and used cake flour as suggested by other reviewers.  I will definitely make again.

This is a terrific cake.  I made it with vanilla confectioner's icing and it came out great! And as mentioned before, it does make your kitchen smell fabulous.

I made this cake yesterday and it was delicious.  Despite the fact that my one yr. old turned the oven temperature up to 475 degrees and the cake only took about 45min. to bake, it still came out great!  Did use the cake flour-made it nice and light.

This was more of a regular cake than a pound cake texture. It was good - not great. Mine was just slightly overdone at 62 minutes. I should have taken it out sooner.

This recipe is a keeper. Made it exactly as directed except I took it out at 1 hour and 10 minutes. At 1:20 it would have burned. It had a fine, velvety texture using the all-purpose flour called for. The flavor was subtle and really nice overall.

This is so far the best pound cake I have ever baked the texture is so soft and fluffy...I made this cake for my family and they absolutely LOVED it. The orange zest on top of the pound cake added a great touch to it.

I had made too many sweet potatoes for Thanksgiving and wanted to try something other than sweet potato pie. This is a great alternative.  I just pulled it out of the oven and tasted it warm.  It is so good!  I think I'll make another one.

What a lovely cake.  My daughter had to find recipe for school and this was one we choice for her to make, she got very good marks for it too!  A lovely moist cake, the only change I made was to use self raising flour instead of plain.  Will definitely make this again.

Very good recipe - potatoes whether white or sweet always make a very tender dough. I made in a bundt pan and followed the recipe. I added a streusel filling with finely chopped walnuts. I love the ribbon effect. I glazed it with a simple vanilla cinnamon glaze. Is a permanent in my recipe box.

great recipe. I made cupcakes with the batter, and they turned out sooo good. It made 21, perfectly rounded topped, cupcakes. I frosted them with cream cheese frosting and topped it with a small piece of candied ginger. I made them for a potluck and everyone loved them.

I give this cake five stars because my whole family loves it, but I thought it was heavy and dense. I think my mistake was my sweet potatoes were warm when I added them to my fluffy butter and sugar and the butter melted and was very runny until I added the flour. Maybe I will try the canned kind next. The cake was really good though.

I tweaked  it a bit because I saw no liquid was in recipe. I used 6 vs 4 eggs,  1 1/2 cup real butter (3 sticks), 1/4 cup of milk and about four shakes of cinnamon.  OH MY GOODNESS!! Super Moist and tasty.

This cake is an old favorite of mine. Only had it as a kid around Christmas time. DELICIOUS! My family did not use the orange juice and orange rind though, they used rum in the batter and rum in the icing,and pecans. But I like this variation too! And there was a bakery nearby where I used to live that made this cake with pineapple. I miss that bakery that went out of business. They also made great sweet potato pies that tasted like they were made at home. Sweet memories.

This was good. I will make again. The citrus of the orange was a little much for me so I will do a vanilla icing next time. I also decreases the sugar in the cake by a half cup.

This will be the third time I have made this cake in three weeks.  Everyone at my job and my family LOVE this cake.  Orange glaze is really good, but I am going to try a Praline Pecan Glaze.

Absolutely beautiful.  Seriously.  Loved it!!  So did my neighbour (she also wants to bottle the scent for an air freshener).  Only changes I made was to bake in 2 loaf pans and I omitted the glaze.  Fantastic!!!!  Thanks for the recipe - it's a keeper!

The first time I made this, I followed the recipe exactly.  Some of the people who tried it, really liked it but I was not impressed.

I just made it again using cake flour as suggested by some other posters.  I also added 1/2 tsp. of allspice as I do when I make a sweet potato pie.  The result was fabulous.  The cake seems lighter and the allspice added a little kick.

Loved this cake!!  My family is a big fan of sweet potato pie so I was a little skeptical at first but I couldn't have been more pleased with the result.  I did as others suggested and only baked the cake for about 1 hour.  Other than that, a really excellent recipe.

My folks thought it was wonderful.  I don't like nutmeg so substituted butter nut vanilla flavoring for the nutmeg and used butter nut vanilla flavoring and milk in the glaze.  I have made 3 in 2 days.  We took one to a function and everyone was asking for the recipe.  Thanks for a recipe that will be used over and over at our home!!!!!!!!!

This cake was just ok. There are many other pound cakes I would make before I would bake this again.

Since my husband loves sweet potatoes and I wanted to make him something to take to work for a morning break snack, this fit the bill perfectly.  It came out moist and tasty.  Kinda reminds me of pumpkin bread.  I skipped the glaze and my husband said it would taste good with whipped cream.  I also baked fresh sweet potatoes instead of canned, and sifted my all purpose flour twice.

I LOVE this cake. Easy to make, always perfect and super moist. Last time I made it, I substituted pumpkin for the sweet potatoe and it was GREAT!

My husband lost the recipe that he used a few years ago. This recipe is similar to what he used to make. All the other recipes we tried from books and other sites didn't quite match. All we can say is thank you. WE LOVE IT!!!!

I will give this 4 starts because I changed the glaze to my own recipe consisting of powdered sugar, syrup from canned yams, vanilla, cinnamon and water. I love this recipes and so does my whole family.  I will definately make it again for the holidays.  Thanks for the great recipe!

I've been making this recipe for the last two years and it's always a requested cake by many family and friends during the Thanksgiving and Christmas holidays. I love that it's less ingredients than the traditional butter pound cake I always make...and it's lighter. My picky eater child even loves it. I've used both butter and margarine...didn't see or taste a difference. I usually add another tsp of vanilla too. And my gas oven cooks hot and fast so my cooking time is only 1 hour at 325 degrees. Any longer or hotter and it dries the cake out.

This is a great recipe. I made it the first time by following the recipe to a tee but using organic ingredients where possible and it was super although I did not have to cook mine near as long as directed.  I then made it a second time with the following changes: I used only 1 cup of organic cane sugar instead of the 2 cups of white sugar. I used 1 Tbsp. madagascar vanilla instead of 1 teaspoon. I used 2 and 3/4 cups of King Arthur White-Wheat Flour. I also added 1/4 cup mayonnaise at the end. I baked this at 350 degrees for 1 hour.  For the glaze I did the following 1 cup organic powdered sugar 1 Tbsp. soft amish butter 2 Tbsp. pineapple, coconut juice with no sugar added and 100% natural 1 Tbsp. grated orange zest  It came out just as good with the reduced sugar and the pineapple/coconut glaze was really good.  This is really a great cake with lots of opportunity for different flavors. Thanks for sharing Anne!

Thanks for a great recipe, Anne.  I made this at the weekend and it was a perfect cake to take into work.  Not too sweet, even with the glaze, easy to cut and pretty light.    I made the following modifications based on previous reviewers:  - half butter substituted for apple sauce  - more spice with 1tsp mixed spice, 1/2 tsp ginger  - baked for an hour    I should have put the glaze on earlier, I waited 20 minutes before inverting and glazing, the cake wasn't warm enough to fully absorb the glaze.    Will definitely make this again.

Really good toasted, with butter.  I used some brown sugar to replace white and wound up with something browner than the photo shown here.  I backed off on the butter because the sweet potatoes I used were leftovers which were already sweetened and spiced somewhat.  I added addition spices and some orange zest.  I would make again.

Great recipe, turned out really good.  I used a 1/2 cup of brown sugar and 1/1/2 cup of regular sugar, I also used 2 tsp of cinnamon instead of 1.  Great consistency and texture.  I also garnished the top of cake with pecans prior to cooking and made a brown sugar glaze.  I will make this cake again.

I made this for my daughter's first birthday party, and it turned out great! I made it exactly as directed, using canned sweet potatoes and baking it in a bundt pan for 1 hour. Whoever said to bake it for longer than an hour must have had an oven that wasn't working right, an hour was plenty! It turned out great, and tasted fantastic, everyone loved it, even the birthday girl!

Delicious, moist, flavorful, heavy.  I substituted about 1/4 of the butter with applesauce and was short on the sweet potatoes, so I used a little applesauce there too.  Also left out the nutmeg becuase I'm not a big fan.  Yum!

Real sweet potatoes are difficult to find where I live so I substituted yams.  Make sure they have cooled before adding to the batter.  I would recommend testing after 1 hour - my cake was done in 1 hr 5 minutes.  Nice moist pound cake, excellent texture.

This cake is much lighter than a typical pound cake which is dangerous because you will want just one more piece!  I am a Southern girl , and I am known for using sweet potatoes in anything I can.  The orange juice is a refreshing addition.   This is my second favorite pound cake.  It comes in second to my mom's traditional pound cake.

My family members loved it. I did not have enough fresh sweet potatoes so I have the amount in the recipe and baked for only 40 minutes. I cut down the sugar because I don't like too sweet. Turned out pretty moist.

I MADE THIS FOR OUR BIBLE STUDY GROUP AND EVERYONE LOVED IT.  THE ONLY CHANGES I MADE WAS TO ADD ABOUT 1 TBLSP SOUR CREAM TO ENSURE IT WAS NOT TOO DRY, USED CAKE FLOUR AND DUSTED WITH POWDERED SUGAR INSTEAD OF THE GLAZE.  EVERYONE WHO TRIED IT LOVED IT.

I was somewhat hesitant about making the cake but I did and it’s unbelievable delicious. I used cake flour and more cimnamon and nutmeg than what was called for so that these two ingredients could be taste, oh , yes this is a new addition , a keeper recipe. Thanks  for this wonderful recipe. Annie Coburn

This will be a must for my table next Thanksgiving.  I used left over mashed sweet potatoes and pumpkin; and substituted Splenda for the white sugar.  Check for doneness starting at 1 hour.  Mine was beautifully done at about an hour and 20 minutes.   Beautiful color and texture, this is definitely a holiday-worthy cake.

This cake turned out great!  It has delicious flavor especially with the spices - I'm a cinnamon fan and the nutmeg was good in it too.  It was quite moist too and great texture.  I decided not to add glaze which I was glad I didn't because it is sweet enough without it!  I took some in for my co-workers and they loved it too especially remarking about the moistness. So glad to have found this recipe. Thanks!

Came out moist and flavorful. Spices were very nice! I used a blend of 3 flours for mine (Organic Oat,Spelt, coconut). Mainly because I bought flour in bulk  and mixed them all together and Kept it in a container in the freezer.

 Next time I will sub the butter for coconut oil as I usually do (If you do this substitution- USE 1/2 the amount of "COCONUT BUTTER" as  regular butter because the "coconut butter" is very moist when you cook with it- even in place of vegetable oil you can use LESS coconut butter. Only thing is if it's cold where you live melt it down first. Actually always melt it down;) you can substitute "coconut butter" in place of eggs as well with some ground flax seed to make it vegan. 
It really doesn't compromise the flavor.:-) 
  I usually place enough COCONUT BUTTER in the pan I am going to cook in  while oven is preheating- then pour it off into a measuring cup- then the pan is oiled and the coconut butter is ready to use. Much healthier!

I accidentally added the confectioners sugar to the batter (along with the regular sugar) but it turned out just fine.  I considered making the glaze but we like the taste as it is--I'm worried the glaze will make it too sweet for our taste.  I might make it and add it to just half and see how it tastes.  I love this and my husband does too--I will definitely make this again.

score!  Easy, moist, my guy ate it up.  microwaved the sweet potatoes (I had yams) and when they cooled, they peeled so easily.  Because I used yams, it was prettier than the picture, more pinkish.  I did add more milk when I saw that it didn't have a cake batter consistency.

Texture was perfect; flavor lacked a sweet potato flavor.  It may have needed more spice?  I should have added all of the glaze.

I will make again.  All 4 adults liked.

This recipe rules! I panicked and didn't think the orange glaze was going to be thick enough, so I added 4 oz. of cream cheese and a 1/4 teaspoon of vanilla extract to a small amount of the glaze and beat it with a mixer for a minute. I drizzled the cake with a little of the glaze and then the cream cheese frosting. It turned out soooooo good. Tastes like an orange 'cicle with the orange zest! Will make it again! Also,  the batter did seem a little thick, so I added a teaspoon of oil and it came out very moist!  It only took and hour to bake, so I recommend checking on it  at the hour mark.

OMG!! This Pound cake is DELISH!!! The only change I made was I used Cake Flour instead of AP. I cannot wait for my fiance to come home from work and try it! I do not know what size bundt pan I used, but I was able to also get two perfect sized individual cakes also!! I will send the large cake with babe to work tomorrow, and we will have the mini ones tonight!! And OMG! Orange glaze?!?! Who ever thought of this is GENIUS!!!  Thank you so much for sharing!!!

I have now made this cake 6 times over the last month..1st time exactly as stated in a Bundt cake pan, looked & tasted lovely.. had over a bushel of sweet potatoes that I was looking to use for holiday gifts & decided to tweak this to use. baked the sweet potatoes, then purred. took advise of another poster & used 1 cup of dk. brown sugar with 1 cup of white sugar, added another t. cinnamon..big difference.. I have added chocolate chips or raisins to mixture & the best yet has been fresh cranberries.. made it taste like the holidays.. then baked them in small loaves & even mini muffin tins for gift giving.. nice addition to gifts from the garden

We loved it, but I made some (minor) changes. The way the recipe is, it still would have been a five star rating so I'm rating  to reflect it.  I followed recipe but used half brown sugar and half white. I used cake flour instead of all purpose. It wasn't specified to use unsalted butter but that's what I used in case anyone might be curious. Also added about a half teaspoon of apple pie spice. I used a 10 inch bundt and it took only 50-55 min ( can't  remember exactly but I checked it when my house started to smell wonderful.) Also, I was lazy after doing dishes so I just topped it with powdered sugar instead of the glaze and it was delicious!

Fantastic! Very bright flavors, very moist! I only had canned yams on hand, and they did very well. This recipe also worked well at my altitude (Denver, CO), which is nice, some things don't turn out well unless you tweak the leaveners a bit. I served it with a home made whipped cream that I flavored with orange zest and cinnamon. Happy baking, all!

This recipe is awesome, just made it today. The cake turned out great! The only thing I did differently was add 2 1/2 cups of sweet potatoes instead of 2. I also cut the baking time down by approximately 10 minutes because I used a seasoned stone bundt pan.  This will definitely be one of my go to desserts.

Made it exactly like the recipe said, everyone loved it! "Super moist", "not too sweet", "really sweet potato? So good".  Light, fluffy, moist, sweet but not that I ate to much sweet cake kind of sweet. Perfect for the fall, winter, holiday season:)????

A 5-star recipe that I will make again!  In my opinion, a more appropriate title might be "Spice Cake with Orange Glaze".  The sweet potatoes are unrecognizable in the cake and the cinnamon and nutmeg come through nicely.  The texture and consistency of the cake wasn't like a pound cake to me.  The orange glaze is a must, and really made the cake sing.  A Thanksgiving hit; will make again!

I made this today for my parents and in-laws. A big hit!!! I love baking and I have a go-to pound cake recipe I've used for years. However, I was wanting to make a spice cake as fits the season, and I love sweet potatoes. This was perfect. I added raisins and a little brown sugar (as someone else mentioned to do in one of the reviews I read). This is definitely a cake I'll make again very soon..

Everyone loved it.  Peeled and boiled potatoes which helped soften the butter.  used 1 cup brown sugar, 3/4 white sugar and 1/4 honey.  Also extra cinnamon, clove, nutmeg, vanilla and almond extract.  One extra egg (have chickens, always use extra eggs).  With the frosting, I also used real lemon juice along with the fresh orange juice and zest.  Definitely a keeper.  Thanks a bunch!

I took this cake to a Mother's Day get together yesterday and everyone loved it.  I used canned sweet potatoes and cake flour as others suggested.  I will definitely make this again.  It was a big hit!

I made this this evening and I'm still not sure what I think overall.  Yes, it was light and fluffy, good texture, but the flavors were a tad too subtle for me.  I think I was expecting a more powerful sweet potato taste and just didn't get it.

Made this cake for Thanksgiving.  Turned out more like spice cake in looks and taste.  The cake was light brown inside and a bit dry.  Mine didn't look anything like the picture. It also cooked much faster than recommended time.  I will not be keeping this recipe, I'm sorry to say even though I love sweet potatoes.

I made this cake for my son's 1st birthday, and we all LOVED it.  I frosted with a cream cheese frosting instead of the glaze - yum.

Will make again!

I followd the recipe, I just exchanged the all purpose flower for cake flower as some of the others suggested and the cake turned out great. This is the first cake I've EVER baked from scratch and my husband loved it.  I didn't do the glaze, but next time I make it I think i will do a vanilla glaze, just for a little mor Sweetness!

This pound cake was delicious and moist, even in spite of my substitutions I made as I didn't have everything on hand. I only had one cup of mashed sweet potato, so I used mashed Yukon Gold potatoes for the other 1 c., and added a few shakes more cinnamon, scant 1/4 tsp. ginger, and 1/4 tsp. ground allspice to make up for the flavor. SOMEONE in my family ate my orange, so I used lemon juice for the glaze and kumquat peel for the zest (I have a tree in the back).
The flavor was still delicious! The added spices were perfect: not overpowering but not underwhelming either. The glaze was also a fine compliment even when not orange flavored. 5 stars all the way, and I'm looking forward to making this when I have all ingredients on hand to see how it compares!

I made this cake and it was a BIG hit in my home. It was gone in less than 24 hours. I increased the sweet potato and butter by 1/2 cup, and added a teaspoon of allspice! Delicious! I am going to make this for my breakfast club at work.

5-stars because 5 people finished it off in a day and a half, AND I've been recruited to make it for Thanksgiving.  Good thing it is really easy.  Used brown sugar instead of white and maple flavoring instead of vanilla and only had to bake it about 55 minutes.  I thought a pineapple glaze sounded better than an orange one, but I didn't have pineapple juice on hand.

I really enjoyed this cake. I send it to my daughter's teacher and she said she had never tasted a cake this delicious. I agree with her. Try this cake. If you like fall flavors, it will not disapoint.

I liked the cake. It seemed to have a blander taste than I expected.  Maybe I was thinking more on the lines of spice cake?? Anyway it was moist - good texture.  My husband on the other hand hated it.  Refused to even give it a second try.

I tried this yesterday and it was a hit! I took one of the other reviews advice and used cake flour. The cake was moist and just delicious! I replaced the orange juice in the glaze with a mango, peach orange juice blend to make the glaze more interesting. I also added the zest right to the glaze. What a great cake! It will now be a thanksgiving must!

Yummy! made it in muffin pan, so they took a lot less time to cook. Also instead of using four eggs, I used two eggs, and two large table spoons of mayo, this made this super moist and delicious. Doubled the cinnamon. Gone before I could say enjoy!

I'm going to keep trying with this recipe, since I don't think the kind of flour I used (the first time) did it any favors (whole grain pastry flour). Also, the second cake I made with this recipe, I used AP flour, and I added 2 T cocoa, an extra tsp of cinnamon, a tsp of pumpkin pie spice, and 1/2 tsp of ground cloves. It turned out MUCH better. I like the extra spice, and the cocoa adds a little something extra I like to the flavor. I think it's a recipe worth having. I'm not an expert with cakes (I'm more of a pie girl, really), but this is a keeper. Probably some cake flour would make a huge difference, and I intend to find out.

Very delicious! Followed the recipe the way it was written except I may have used a bit more sweet potatoe since I wanted to use up some left over baked ones I had. Made a very moist and delicious twist on a traditional pound canke. Know this one is a keeper since the husband went back for seconds!

This is an excellent recipe.  The cake had a great texture and the recipe was easy to follow.  For our tastes, I believe I will add more spices next time.  We live in New Zealand, so I also used kumaras (a type of white coloured sweet potato grown in New Zealand) instead of the orangy sweet potatoes found in the United States.  The kumara tasted fine, but I have a feeling that the orange sweet potato is probably a better choice.  Still, the cake was delicious, and I will make it again.  Thank you.

I went with most people and used cake flour.  I didn't have a bundt pan so I used a rectangle pan and filled it half way. It was so good and not heavy at all.  I would make this again.  I also tried a muffin version but I didn't think they were as good.  I also used canned sweet potatoes with about a 1/4 cup of brown sugar. This was a great receipe.  Laura H, WI

This cake was fantastic!! Made it just as directed and it turned out moist, dense, and very filling. my hisband and my daughter HATE sweet potatoes, so i simply chose not to tell them it was sweet potato cake. It was gone before dinner was done. Great fresh out of the oven with fresh butter. The only thing I'll do next time is add a little more cinnamon and nutmeg, maybe omit those all together and use pumpkin pie spice. Otherwise no changes! Thanks for the recipe

as someone who DETESTS sweet potatoes, i was very skeptical when making this cake despite the good reviews. I'm glad I did. the sweet potatoes helped make it moist. I was 1/4c short of the sweet potato but had some carrot/sweet potato puree that i use to smuggle into my 4 year old's foods, and added that, and it turned out fine. As soon as she's eaten dinner, i'm going to give her a piece of this and if she eats it, it will be in my rotation. thanks for the recipe :)

This cake is absolutely delicious.  I made it and substituted the sweet potato with Libby's pumpkin mix, that comes in a can.  My family was amazed with the moisture of this recipe and the flavor.  I highly recommend this recipe.

I baked the cake (but I added 1 tsp of each spice) and it was simply awesome!  My husband and kids devoured it!  Thanks for submitting the recipe!

I have to say I had my doubts.  I'm not a fan of the sweet potato.  But this is by far the best cake I've ever made.  REALLY easy to make, and delicious!!  My husband loves this cake!

The only way I like sweet potatoes.  Here are my suggestions for a different cake:   add dried cranberries (about 1/2 cup) and 1 tsp. grated orange rind.  No better just different. Thanks.

This cake was not as good as I thought it would be.  I have other pound cake recipes I like better.  I thought it would taste more like pumpkin pie than it does.  My husband, however, loved it.

Made this recipe a couple times.  It’s a moist cake but  a tad dense.  The flavour was lacking, so the second time I doubled the cinnamon to improve the taste.  Definitely use the icing over the cake as it cools.  I added chopped Crasins to the cake batter and used the cranberry juice from a can of cranberry sauce  to make the icing and this really helped to boost the flavour of the cake.   This cake keeps well for a few days.

This is a delicious cake and everyone loved it! I do suggest to serve this cake the day after you've made it.  Not the day it was baked.  I also did not use canned sweet potato/yam, I peeled, boiled and mashed it myself.

This recipe was delicious. I had sweet potatoes that my grandma sent from North Carolina. I used 2.5 cups because that’s what I had after I boiled them. It was a huge hit this Thanksgiving.

I baked this cake for Thanksgiving and it received high reviews. I didn't use 2 cups of sugar (as listed in the ingredients), I thought that was a bit much. I added the juice of one-half orange to the batter to balance the orange drizzle. I will likely try this recipe again with a little more cinnamon and nutmeg, the juice of a whole orange and maybe add pecans.

This cake is delicious! I made it using cake flour after reading the reviews. I also reduced the cooking time by 20 minutes; otherwise, it would be overcooked. Will definitely make it again. It was a hit!

This cake is moist if you don't over cook it. Unfortunately the cooking time is inaccurate. Cook 20 minutes less. I made a cream cheese frosting which my family tends to LOVE on spice cakes. It was great. I think I'll make this for Thanksgiving.

I couldn't find Sweet Potatoe, so I substituted Pumpkin from a can, and it turned out GREAT. My wife and friends loved it, so I'll be making it again. It would be a fine cake for Thanksgiving.

Excellent cake , I made it a bit healthier- added 3 tbs of ground  flaxseed and whole wheat flour with a few tablespoons of wheat germ - so i added 1/2 tsp extra of baking powder. I also used organic unrefined sugar and used 1.5 cups . For garnish i sliced a few oranges snd let them dry out 
In the glaze i added dome orange zest and a dash of cinnamon 
Amazing cake moist and flavourful it was a hit with the family

This was my first cake I have ever made from scratch! easy once I prepped all the ingredients. It was excellent!!!! My husband and son couldn’t even wait for it to cool down. The orange glaze was the perfect accompaniment . I made the glaze without the rind but when I added the rind it was outta this world!

Very unique and my co-workers certainly appreciated it.  I found it best warm.  Seemed to dry out by day 2.  It tasted slightly like a boxed spice cake, but nothing like the density of a pound cake.  Perhaps lesson the cooking time.

I had to make this twice. The first time the cake was too dense because the butter and sugar I added didn’t get fluffy. Unfortunately, I had to throw it away. So the second time, I added the eggs after blending the butter and sugar. The cake turned out great! I also Place holes in top with a toothpick so the icing can run thru the cake!

Not sure what I didnt do correctly. I this cake is delicious but, I while the inside was moist and delicious the outside wasn't cakey. It had the texture of a loaf or muffin.. I have a gas oven maybe it was a temperature thing. Any suggestions?

I will definitely make again!  Even my friend who dislikes sweet potatoes loved it!
    
     I made it exactly as the recipe said, but did not need to bake it as long.  I cut the time by 10 minutes and it was done perfectly!

This was a big hit. I didn't have enough sweet potato so I used some carrots to make up the difference. Next time, I will try to reduce the sugar or use an alternative sweetener.

This is an awesome recipe, however I changed a few things at the recommendation of some of the other members. I used two cup of cake flour and 1 cup of all purpose flour. The cake was very moist and flavorful.

I made a few changes: I used cake flour, I used a 15 oz can of sweet potato puree, I added a layer of 1 tsp cinnamon, 1 tsp dark cocoa, 2 tsp sugar in the middle of the cake, and swirled it around with a knife to create a dark "fault line". I used tangerines from the backyard for the juice, and added zest to the glaze.  

Like many others, I found the baking duration listed to be over long.  I took mine out at 1:05, and it was just about right, maybe a tad overdone on the bottom, due to being too low in the oven.

I think the recipe is for a 12-cup pan -- mine is 10-cup, so I used the extra batter to make 7 cupcakes.  

If you add the glaze after 20 minutes of cooling, as in the instructions, it won't look like the photo - the glaze will be more translucent.  You'll need to let the cake cool a lot more to get that white look.

I always make the recipe just as stated.  Then tweak it to fit my personal taste.  The cake turned out well it was moist, however it did not have a ton of sweet potato flavor whichis ok with me. The cake is  a great  with coffee.  I will make it again and possibly add pecans, candied ginger and a little extra cinnamon. All my husbands co workers really enjoyed it.
Thank you for the recipe.

I made it Gluten Free by using Bob's Red Mill 1 and 1 blend. I was looking for a way to use up some berry jam, so I also added a layer of the jam in the middle of the batter. It turned out delicious! It was done in my bundt pan in an hour, rather than the 1 1/2 hours recommended.

This cake is beautiful, moist and delicious!!! Definitely a keeper. I added 1/4 cup buttermilk to the batter and I made an orange syrup with 1/4 cup water, 1/4 cup granulated sugar and 3 tablespoons of fresh orange juice, brought it to a boil and poured it over the cake after allowing the cake to cool for 10 mins.  I glazed the cake after it was completely  cooled.

Made some changes after reading other reviews.  Half the sugar was brown, doubled spices, salt & vanilla, also added chopped walnuts.  Batter seemed very thick so I added 1TB heavy cream, 2TB orange juice and 1/4 cup applesauce.  Set your timer for early checks, this was done in about 55 min. using a bundt pan.  So delish, light and tasty that I'm baking a second to gift to a neighbor.

This turned out to be a fantastic last minute dessert!  I reduced the sugar to 1 and 3/4 cups and it was a hit at the party as it wasn't too sweet.   As I have a convection oven, I reduced the baking time to 1 hour.  At 40 minutes, I reduced the heat to 325 and it was fully baked at 55 minutes.  It was perfectly moist and tasty with just a drizzle of frosting (I added an extra tsp of orange juice to allow better drizzle and additional orange flavour).

Excellent cake, will definitely make again. It was very moist and tender w/ a great flavor. I used red yams. I also followed the recommendations of several reviewers and made 2 changes: 1) used cake flour and 2) baked for an hour. I didn't even need icing/drizzle. You won't go wrong w/ this recipe.

Let it set for 24 hrs to get all the favor and you won't be dissatisfied.  It was fantastic would almost replace for my favorite 7-up pound cake. Note: I substitute the AP flour with  cake flour , make sure all ingredients are at room temp.

I was doing a few things and not paying close attention and put all of my dry ingredients together.  To save time and cleanup, I usually don't sift but toss in a sistema container.  I creamed butter, potatoes and vanilla together, then added dry ingredients and eggs one at a time.  I put in oven and checked after 45 minutes...it was completely done at 58 minutes.  Beautifully moist and totally delicious.  I will serve it at a Tea planned for tomorrow.

This cake was so delicious to myself and,
 everyone I shared it with; family, friends and, coworkers included that, I was forced to 4 batches in 2 weeks which includes one of them being sugar free and, i had a blast knowing it was my first time being introduced to this recipe...fun to make and, delicious Yum! Yum!

Made for a work thanksgiving dinner, sweetened up the sweet potato mush, brown sugar, cinnamon and a dash of nutmeg... came out smooth and MOIST.. WOW.. Oh and I used cake flour definitely... Next times will make sure to bake some pralines in it, nicely suspended through it and maybe a streusel topping... I made my glaze really thin last time.. People seemed to love it, one man actually offered to pay me to make him one! Definitely a keeper!

It was a hit! I used cake flour instead of all purpose flour. I added candied pecans on top. I will make it again.

This was a huge hit! People were asking for the recipe. I don't have a bundt pan so I made it in a 9x13 and it worked fine. I did not have any orange juice so I used organic apple juice for the glaze and it was delicious. Ppl wanted the recipe. Will make this every winter season. I baked two large sweet potatoes the night before. Got up, peeled them and put the cake together quickly!

Had the right amount of sweet potato left over from making Chipotle Chicken Sweet Potato Skins. Used cake flour and some extra nutmeg; baked 55 minutes for my oven. It was moist and flavorful. It was light and rich. Would definitely make this again.

The texture and moisture is excellent.  The taste makes you want a second, third and fourth piece.

Removed half the sugar and half the butter.
Used canned sweet potatoes (that I had intended on making into sweet potato pie, but no condensed milk handy).
Used almond flour for half of the flour.
Wheat germ for 1/4 the flour.
Whole wheat gen purpose flour for the last 1/4.
Didn't add icing.
The kids still loved it, but next time I'll make some icing and hide it for myself ;)

I made 2 changes to this recipe: 1. I used cake flour instead of all purpose and I think that contributed to the beautiful texture of the cake, it wasn't dense at all. 2. I didn't have nutmeg so I used allspice which gave the cake a lovely taste and fragrance. I would definitely make this again, I think its the perfect cake for afternoon tea. Cooking and mashing the potatoes was a bit time consuming not to mention the clean up, I would make this cake again if I already had leftover SP or I'll use the canned ones.

This cake looks beautiful! However, it turned out pretty dry for me and not a lot of flavor. I did change out the sweet potato and used 2 1/2 cups pumpkin, adding more than the recipe called for but still dry.

I too just like Ngerland found this recipe to be dry and bland when I tried it.  It looked very presentable, but the product was dissatisfying and lost its steam fast.

I love this cake! It has become a holiday favorite with my family. I reduce the heat and baking time according to my oven/pan. Instead of baking sweet potatoes, I use a can of Bruce's baked sweet potatoes. I've finished the cake with an orange glaze, pineapple glaze, cream cheese glaze, and simple powdered sugar.

I just made this and it is delicious, very moist and perfectly spiced! I did use cake flour, and added a tsp. Orange peel and a tsp orange extract to the batter. Left it unglazed, it doesnt really need it.

Yummy and moist. I used 1/2 a/p & 1/2 whole wheat flour & added 1/2 tsp. of ginger. I also don't have a tube pan, so just divided it between 2 loaf pans & baked for 1 hr.

I had to give the recipe a 4 as is. I really want to give it a five but just can't. I love the recipe and have made it countless times with cake flour and various glazes. Any descriptions that I have can't do it justice. It's a pleasant surprise to the people here in Savannah and we use sweet potatoes in just about everything on a regular basis. Today I couldn't find any cake flour in the pantry and decided to just follow the recipe as written minus a shorter cooking time(from past experiences with this cake). The AP flour resulted in a bread like texture that didn't really work. My normal baking time is 1hr 5mins but using the cake flour I should have cut it by another ten minutes. It's nice to follow recipes word for word but experience can also prevent you from losing time and money on something that didn't feel quite right. I don't think that I will ever do that again.I'm going to toss this one and just make the other version tomorrow. Once again, I have made this recipe a keeper...with edits of course.   :)

This cake is delicious.  I made it with left over sweet potatoes cooked in orange juice and it was very moist.  I did not make the glaze but my co-workers didn't seem to mind.  Everyone liked the cake.  I'll be making this one again.

This cake is INCREDIBLE.  I used cake flour and added a little brown sugar to my mashed sweet potatoes.  I also put chopped pecans in the bottom of the pan before adding the cake mix.  I'm sure the orange glaze would've been great however I opted for a brown sugar glaze which was the perfect topping for this moist delicious cake.  Even the batter is delicious.

Very moist pound cake.  I used cake flour and cut back the sugar to 1 cup brown sugar and 1/4 cup granulated sugar.  I made 3 loaves and 6 muffins out of this recipe.  Will definitely make this again!

Simple, light, delicious! A little dry, but that might just be my baking time (I lost track and left it in for an extra 10 minutes). It doesn't have much cinnamon taste, and I did add an extra teaspoon, but I think that's totally up to you on how spiced up you want a pound cake to be. I think it was pretty much perfect to serve with ice cream and coffee.

This recipes makes an AMAZING cake.  I do not eat sweet potatoes, but my sister and boyfriend do.  I made them both a cake using this recipe and they were in heaven.  During the process of making it, it smelled SOOOO delicious I had to try it and I was amazed sweet potatoes could be so tantalizing as a dessert.

Loved the cake I cooked it for 1 hour and 10 min in my oven. I added more cinnamon, vanilla, and nutmeg to suit my taste. I also added a little ginger and a cap full of lemon extract. I omitted the glaze it really didn't need it.

This is the best pound cake I have ever eaten or made. I work for the military, and make it all the time for different occasions.  Plus it is a request from them.  Recently I bought small angel food cake pans, 6 pans all together, now we call them Sweet potato baby cakes.  It is moist and wonderfully tasty.  I use Bruce's sweet potatoes on this recipe, because we do not use fresh sweet potatoes at home.  So whomever tried this and it did not come out good, should try the canned....excellent...

This was a great, moist cake that tasted just like a pumpkin pound cake!  I used canned sweet potatoes, but will try fresh baked next time!  YUMMY!

I had never made cakes with sweet potatoes and was curious about this pound cake. Wonderful texture and an unusual taste (pleasant). A keeper. While the cake was still warm I glazed with maple syrup. I also made a quick bread I'll post soon.

Everyone loved this pound cake, and since I am from a farming family, it made it all sweeter!  My husband suggested a cream cheees icing, but other than that, I'd not change a thing!

This cake is so good.  I changed the recipe a little and added a cup of chopped walnuts to it.  Tastes so good when served warm with a little apple butter on it.

This is an EXCELLENT recipe.  My family is not fond of sweet potatoes so when I found myself stuck with some I went looking for a recipe to use them in.  The batter for this cake is light like marshmallow fluff and the end result is light and springy.  Also, this cake is not too sweet which works great for my hubby who is not a sweet tooth.  The only change I made was adding a tsp of ginger to the batter.

I followed the recipe exactly, but the cake turned out a little on the heavy side. I also found that the glaze was great with the orange juice and zest, but it was a little too sweet for my taste. I think if I make this again I will try using maybe a cream cheese frosting and incorporate the orange juice and zest that way. All in all, it's a good cake, I was just a little disappointed.

Perfect cake. It was moist, delicious, and had a beautiful texture. I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out flawlessly. My family and I gobbled it up in no time flat. This will be a recipe I'll use a lot!

This was ok. The spices were very nice but it seemed like it was missing something. Needs some experementing, but the potential is there.

A previous review suggested cooking only 60 min, but my cake was slightly over done by that time. The result was a dry cake that was tasty but required lots of water to wash it down. I prefer a much more dense pound cake, but this was tasty.

We exhanged one cup of wheat for one cup of the white, and doubled cinnamon, added some pumpkin pie spice.  Had it with whipped topping. Kids loved it.

This was such a wonderful cake.  I made if for my new years party and it was quite a hit.  This was my first time baking anything  that didn't say "just add water", so  it was very easy to make.  Great Recipe!

This cake is great! It's light textured and a snap to make. I didn't make the glaze because i'm not a fan of orange but the cake is a hit!
