no grill, so i used my iron griddle, but this recipe got me started on grilled/fried cauliflower. first i just fried it in olive oil, and that was great. then added diced garlic, and it was even better. now i'm making it with shredded romano on top for the last 3 or 4 minutes. i never did get around to using the brown sugar—i'm diabetic. this is a perfect entree for me, and i love it. even the "not-that-fond-of-cauliflower wife likes it. if you like cauliflower even a little, you should try this.

I’m about to do the type of review I hate. You know, the kind where the cook modifies the recipe so you can’t tell for sure if the correct recipe is good or not? I wanted to do this recipe as written, but my cauliflower was too small to get more than a couple of nice slices off it, but I really wanted to grill it along with my chicken. So, I cut it up into florets, tossed it in a bowl with 2 TB’s of olive oil to coat it. I mixed my own homemade season-all-type mixture with the brown sugar and sprinkled it on the cauliflower. But how to actually grill it? I borrowed the technique from a (less worthy) recipe and put the florets in a doubled-on-the-bottom aluminum foil pouch with 4 slitted vents, and grilled them on the lowest gas grill setting, turning them every 12 minutes, then checking after 14 (each grill will vary, of course.) On charcoal/wood, you should off-set the pouch. I really do hope to do this recipe exactly as written someday when I have a large enough veggie, I think it’ll be great! But I hope this modification helps someone else in my predicament. There aren’t many grilling/roasting veggie recipes out there, so thank you so, so much ziola.

I don't know if it is the light grilled flavor or the brown sugar that transforms the Cauliflower flavor into a little slice of heaven.

Oh my gosh.... this was great!  Make sure you slice the cauliflower large enough so it doesn't fall apart and if you really want to have slices for presentation purposes, get a couple heads of cauliflower, you really only get 2 nice slices per head, otherwise, it is large chunks which still cooked up nicely and tasted great!

I just made this with cauliflower and broccoli and used a vegetable grill pan that has holes in it for about five or so minutes tossing once, then put back in the same pan I used to mix, covered with foil on the grill for another 12 or so minutes and it is delicious! So simple, in fact my husband makes his own seasoning mix for grilling and it also has brown sugar in it so I used his seasoning. It was very easy and it tastes so good. Thank you very much for this recipe!

This is great. 

The resulting mixture seemed suspiciously small to me so I doubled it, which was a mistake - the spices were too powerful.

Don't have an outdoor grill, so I first boiled the cauliflower, then added the spice mixture, and then baked it for twenty minutes at 180c. The texture was perfect.

This was a hit. I used my cast iron skillet on the grill to finish it. Also cut the slices from the center and cut them in half for easy handling. Husband ooood over it.

This tasted good enough but it sure wasn't as easy as I thought.  Slicing a head of cauliflower took some doing and mine also fell apart. I didn't use my grill it since it was winter and I think that was the problem.  I panned fried the slices along with all the pieces and the flavor was really OK but it was so greasy. I still gave it 4 stars because the recipe does say to grill it and I think it would be so much better that way. I did sprinkle some Romano cheese on it before serving and I loved the result. I do plan to try this again in the summer on the grill.  Thanks for a really unique recipe!

My family didn't like the seasoning on this at all.  The cooking method is a success, and one that will definitely be repeated with different flavors.

Part of my cauliflower fell apart when I tried to slice it in planks.  I just through the big florets on the grill with the rest of it and that worked fine.  My husband really liked it.  My piece was a little light on the seasoning, and I wished it had a little more.  I found it a little difficult sprinkling the brown sugar evenly, so he may have gotten the perfectly-seasoned piece.

Just made this for the first time and it was INCREDIBLE. Although my cauliflower was largely in slabs, I also had some pieces that fell off, so a vegetable grille pan was perfect to keep it all together. Also, I didn't grill it directly on the rack, but the pan did a fine job at charring it. To make it faster, steam it in the microwave first. YUM!

Very good and easy to make.  I thought it was great, and my wife and kid, who don't like veggies as much as I do, at least thought it was OK.  I did make some changes:

1) I quartered 2 heads of cauliflower instead of slicing - I thought they would stay together better.
2) Quartering basically made 3 sides on each quarter, so 2-3 minutes grill time on each side - less than 10 minutes total.
3) After grilling, I wrapped everything in aluminum foil instead of using a pan - cooked for 20 minutes.
4) I seasoned as instructed when grilling, but used bacon grease, brown sugar, and minced garlic inside the foil.

Everything came out fine, but thought it would create more brown sugar garlic sauce in the foil.  Maybe a splash of water or vinegar next time.

We really liked this recipe and I will make again. I searched and searched but I just don't have a pan that I can put on the grill so I steamed the cauliflower for 8 minutes in the microwave. Lawrey's ® isn't available here so I used Mrs. Dash® instead. Great little recipe, thanks for sharing.

We’ve been making this for quit awhile already.  We use a basket like u put fish or pieces in. Lock them in there marinated with olive oil and seasoned salt. No brown sugar.  To each their own. It’s super delicious.  It’s funny we are having it tonite and your recipe popped up.  Awesome veggies.  Asparagus the same way. !!!

Thank you for sharing your recipe.  I think all the negative comments are totally unnecessary. And when you change a recipe completely there’s no need to put all that in here. The comments are for the recipe end of story.

I made this and it turned out great. I used a BBQ Grill Mat which you can use on a gas or charcoal grill. I'm not one to push products but like everyone else small veggies kept falling through my grates too. This is 100 percent better then a basket. I think it only cost me $20. Google it and go back to enjoying small grilled veggies.

I could not grill this as instructed. Cauliflower crumbles when cut, and pieces continued to fall off. 

So, instead, I cut smaller pieces and laid them out on a sheet of tin foil. I then put the foil on a slotted grill pan we use for vegetables. After cooking the pieces on each side for about 5 minutes, I closed up the tin foil and cooked them another 10 minutes. 

I only used half a head of cauliflower. I’m glad I did because the flavoring was perfect.

It seemed a bit too salty and I wasn't able to cut the cauliflower in slices very easily, which meant a lot of little "flowers" instead.

Great recipe ! I did make the cauliflower pieces too small so lost some in the grilling process.

Flavor was awesome. Hubby let it cook a bit too long and it looked burnt but carmelized. Will try again.

I don't like season salt,  so I used salt, pepper, garlic, onion powders and parsley. I forgot about using the sugar and it was still delicious.

Delicious!  Had a little trouble cutting the cauliflower without it breaking into florets, but eventually got the hang of it.  Instead of Lawry's, I used my own mixture of the same spices that Lawry's has in it.

I didn't have fresh cauliflower, so decided to try this recipe with some bags of frozen florets but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. OMG, my family devoured it. Cooked on the grille in a grilling basket so that the smaller florets wouldn't fall through the grates. Delish!  Now my son, who previously said he didn't like cauliflower, is asking when I am going to grille more LOL. I was afraid it would taste too sweet with the brown sugar, but it didn't at all. I will definitely make this again, and may even try this method with some other veggies- squash perhaps.

Too sweet for our tastes , but the idea was great. I’m going to try substituting balsamic vinegar for the sugar and chilli flakes with the salt.
Fingers crossed.

Good stuff! It got a little crumbly toward the end of the grilling, but I managed it carefully with a spatula. I might use a bit less sugar next time, as I was going for more savory than sweet.

I loved it... I had never thought of grilling cauliflower and this was AWESOME, even my roommate enjoyed it... and he is a died in the wool avid "steamed cauliflower" is the only way. I think this recipe gave him a new perspective.

I made this recipe with seasoning as described and also with Montreal steak seasoning.  I liked the steak seasoning better as the sweetness of brown sugar on the cauliflower didn't work for me.  That said, I will definitely be grilling cauliflower again.

Liked the taste but it was difficult to cut the cauliflower in slices.  I kep them in flowerets and dipped them in the mixture.  I was not able to make them on the grill.  the frying pan with a cover worked just as well as the method the recipe suggested.

I made this last week.  Used Louisana Cajun  Seasoning together with the brown sugar and the results were great. The flavours blended quite well.  My son is not a  fan of cauliflower but he enjoyed them. I will definitely make again.

Delicious - adding the brown sugar made the cauliflower taste like candy. So good! We used a grill pan so we could use the whole cauliflower head.

This is a fantastic recipe, I doubled the sauce recipe to properly cover the vegetables. For the pan I slid the cauliflower onto a grill pad and covered it with a cake pan. Only needed about 15 minutes before it was tender and caramelized. Make sure you buy a large head and cut thickly to avoid it falling apart.

I LOVED THIS DISH.....
Loving Cauliflower I wanted a recipe where I could grille it.
I followed the recipe exactly but doubled or tripled each ingredient, the half head of cauliflower I used needed this increase to coat each piece thoroughly.
I can see one could use many variations of this recipe... the brown sugar was an interesting twist.
Bravo, 5 Stars in my book.
I’ll be fixing this again and again....

I made it and it was delicious.  Will tweak the recipe a bit next time and not cook for as long as I did.

It was delicious, but it was super hard to cut the cauliflower in slices thick enough to say together without crumbling.
My husband is not a fan of cauliflower and didn't like it, but I'm willing to try it again!

I followed the recipe as stated. My cauliflower broke into smaller pieces so I used a grill mat on the grill. It came out wonderful! Everyone raved at the flavor. After using the grill mat, i covered a cookie sheet with aluminum foil and put all the pieces on it and finished “baking” it on the grill on the higher grate over the coals. Carmelized perfectly.

Tasty, but I couldn't cut the whole head into florets so used a grill basket for the broken ones.

Five stars for flavor but three for execution. Out of the whole head, I only got two slices to stay intact, so I cut the whole thing up and put it in a grill pan. Delicious flavor and very easy. Will definitely make again.

This was great! Hard to cut into steaks though, only got 2 steaks but the rest were larger pieces. Basted both sides with olive oil, sprinkled both sides with brown sugar and Lawry's season salt, grilled on medium on foil grill pans on the BBQ then reduced heat to low and covered in foil. This was an easy recipe and turned out great!

Delicious.  Mom said it was the best cauliflower she has ever eaten.  I used avocado oil instead of olive oil and did not put on grill.  I added ingredients to a heat proof dish covered with aluminum foil and placed on bottom grill of barbecue for 20 mins turning the cauliflower half way through.  Cooking time depends on how thick you cut it, but honestly even if the cauliflower was in large flowerets it would be just as good.  This is definitely going to be a family tradition.

Live the seasoning flavor. A lot like BBQ potato chips. I put them in triple foil instead and it was a little mushy. Will try o my 15 min next time. I cut a large head into 4ths.

So simple, but really delicious. The brown sugar caramelizes and gives the cauliflower a golden brown coating and a slightly sweet flavor. Grilled them quickly directly on each side, then put in cast iron pan with foil on top on the grill for about 25 minutes more.

Simple and yummy. Made it in florettes not slices and grilled in tin foil as another suggested. I prepped it hours before cooking which is the kind of recipe I like when we're grilling with company.
