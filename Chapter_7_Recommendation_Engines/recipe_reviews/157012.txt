A wonderful recipe, but I believe a step was left out. Since the recipe didn't say "dice/chop very very fine" I think that before the beaten eggs are added, the soup should be blended.  It would also be helpful to have better instruction than "fill a large pot 3/4 full with water." I used my 5 1/2 quart Le Creuset pot, and filled it 3/4 full. By the time I added the 4 large potatoes, it was full to the brim. Since potatoes greatly vary in size, a weight would be helpful. We picked the sorrel from our community herb garden--as other reviewers have said it's hard to find sorrel in stores (including our local co-op). It would be nice to know how much a "bunch" of sorrel is.

this is a very good recipe for "holodnik" I have not being able to  find "shaveel" or sorrel in US, but I think balsamic vinegar should do the trick,
 your recipe is delightful because it shows how to use spinach and get a zing! thumbs up!

This is an amazing soup! The only problem I have no idea where to buy Sorrel. I will try to check out local farmers markets or grow it which can be quite an ordeal:(

Unfortunately I couldn't find any sorrel, and I bet this was the key flavor I was missing. This was good, but I know it can be better.

I filled a large soup pot about 60% of the way with water (which I salted), and that was perfect because it left enough room for vegetables and stirring without issue. My grandmother's recipe also calls for 1/2 cup of white rice to be added into the water with the potatoes, which I'll add next time. Also, I bought a package of prewashed spinach, which made the prep easier since washing each leaf can take a lot of time (a 5oz package yielded about 4 cups of chopped spinach, which was just right). Someone else suggested blending the soup, I would not, this is not intended to be a cream soup. I was generous with the salt, added an extra tablespoon of sugar, and served with sour cream.

This recipe was close to my grandmother's, so I'll try it again and review once I've added sorrel.

If you follow this recipe, you will end up with water filled with green leaves. I had to modify this to make it edible. My mom makes this soup all the time but I decided not to follow her recipe and paid for it. I will never use this recipe again.

We really loved this soup. I wasn't able to find sorrel but I used spinach instead. If I can ever find sorrel I will try it with that. Great soup to have on a cool spring day.

I made sure to dice all ingredients (except the potatoes) very finely.  I agree that it gave the soup a good texture.  I used only 2 large russet potatoes and that was plenty.  I substituted the sorrel for half Italian parsley and half arugula, that way you still get the lemony, zingy flavor.  Also, I think white balsamic vinegar would make the most sense here, but I used apple cider vinegar.  I was worried the red balsamic would change the color of the soup too much.  Lastly, I tripled the sugar and the vinegar, because this made a lot of borscht.  Very good! And we used all of the listed garnishes.  I would make this again.

Great borscht ???? I added the tops of green garlic because sorrel wasn't available . Garnished with the cucumber and dill was perfect. I also used it for a special on my menu at work ( Waban Kitchen , Waban, Ma )and my guests loved it.  Peace, Love and Great Food for all.... Norm
