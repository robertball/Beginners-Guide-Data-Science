New family favorite! It is a Tabasco style hot sauce, not a chili salsa. I used rice vinegar because it is mild and allows the serrano flavor to shine through. The heat was not overwhelming and was a forward heat that didn't linger. 
This one's a keeper.

I used the food processor to pulverize about 10 lbs of Serrano peppers, garlic, sea salt and vinegar per the recipe. I place the boiled ‘slurry’ in sealed quart jars for 2 days in the frig.  I strained the slurry using a fine mesh strainer into a 3 quart sauce pan (nice consistency, thick liquid) and funneled into pepper sauce jars. Flavor is hot but not volcanic. Love it

I made this with my homegrown serranos i used half green and half red. I also added 2 dried jalapeno from my garden last year. Turned out great just enough to make your forehead damp. Next time i make this i will only use a cup of vinegar to start with though, a little thin for my likeing but still very tastey.

Serranos were on sale at my favorite local grocery store so I bought a pound and had some leftover and thought, why not give this recipe a try. Hell yes! Glad I did, amazing taste, great balance of heat & flavour

It didn't dawn on me until after I was done making the recipe that basically all you are doing here is flavoring the vinegar and making your own green pepper sauce such as Tobasco.  There isn't anything wrong with that but I just didn't realize that at first and thought I'd mention for those making it next.  I plan on saving an empty shaker bottle and keeping this in my fridge at all times.
