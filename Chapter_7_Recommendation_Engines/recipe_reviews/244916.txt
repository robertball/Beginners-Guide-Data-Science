I cut the recipe in half and just did one loaf. At 20 minutes the loaf looked done but the center was undercooked.   I baked for 40 minutes.  The crust was really hard to cut and the crumb was still a little gummy.

Very easy recipe. I chose this for my first attempt at homemade bread and it came out perfect.

Very easy to make, I love the crustness of the bread, made it twice now, I added 1 cup of whole wheat the second time, very addictive.

My attempt at this resulted in a goopey dough without any any shape at all.  Undeterred, I threw the whole mess in a large dutch oven and crossed my fingers. About 40 minutes later, it was done and with pretty tasty results. Thick and heavy like a good sourdough. I actually liked it.

It came out wonderful. But i suggest maybe cutting the dpugh into four loaves it did come out a little softer in the middle but i do like it like this!
