I had to make a few changes to this recipe based on what I had in my kitchen. I used olive oil, red pepper flakes and dried thyme as substitutes. I also added 1 tsp garlic powder. This tastes best after it has cooled.

This was outstanding. I reduced the amount of pistachio nuts(unsalted)to half a cup and put them in the food processor for a rough chop and flavor to go through the dish. I also reduced the salt to 1/2 teaspoon. I had the leftovers the next day, they were great when cold too. Thanks Tensmom.

I made this without the pistachio nuts as a salad topper.  The flavor was excellent without being too overpowering.  I liked them salty.  They'd make a great snack too. Thanks!  There should be more recipes with garbanzo beans/ chick peas.

This was very good.  It was simple and easy to make.  It was on the salty side so I recommend reducing the salt used.

So different and delicious! I halved the cayenne and cumin to make it a little less spicy, but it still had heat.

I thought that these were really interesting, and I didn't think that I liked Garbanzo beans.  Turns out they're pretty good cooked (vs. raw) and I liked the spice blend.  Husband thought they were too salty so I'll try omitting that next time.

I did not enjoy this recipe at all.  The cooking time did not seem correct and the beans never got 'crispy'.  The flavors of the seasonings were kind of lost.  Nothing remarkable about this dish.  Next time I have this many garbanzo beans I'll just make hummus.

Instead of cayenne pepper, I used chipotle pepper seasoning, and instead of fresh thyme, I used the dried ground variety.  These made a tasty snack  Next time I will be inclined to find fresh thyme, though!

Yum! Used roasted salted pistachios as that was all I could find. Omitted the salt because of it. Would probably add a touch of salt in the future.

I liked the flavors but will have to try again since it never got crunchy or crispy.
