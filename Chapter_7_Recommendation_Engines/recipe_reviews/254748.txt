Was a great sweet & savory just as promised. I made it for my wife, who loves vodka Martinis, and she was very impressed. Tasty and creative...

This wasn't the prettiest cocktail (which is fine), but it tasted ok for us. We don't own martini glasses, so I just used a regular glass. I also floated some sliced strawberries in there just for fun. Maybe we are just not martini people? This was fun to try for something different, though. Thanks for sharing. :)
