Was looking for a last minute fruit-cake recipe for Christmas - I made this at 9pm on Christmas eve and it was a hit on Christmas day! My husband even came back for seconds. I did add about 5% more on the fruit side... made for a wonderfully heavy and moist cake (mother did always say that the worth of the fruitcake is told by the weighing!) Thanks!

Great recipe! I did not wrap the pans with paper & they still turned out perfectly.  

I doubled the recipe for two pans. Used 2 C raisins, 1 C dates, 2 C craisins, 6oz pineapple and 2 C apricots instead of the cherries and citrus peel.  1 tsp cloves & 2 tsp cinnamon - the perfect amount.  The house smells wonderful too!

This is fantastic!  It's my first attempt at fruitcake and not only was it delicious, it's easy.  I misread the directions (oops) and used candied fruit rather than dried fruit, so the cake is probably a bit sweeter than it should be; next time I will use the candied fruit (it's so pretty in the cake) but cut the sugar by about 1/3.  I also soaked the candied fruit in rum for a week, which gave it a nice, rich flavor. There was way more batter than for one loaf pan, so I also made three small cakes in ramekins and wanted to try infusing them with rum for two weeks, but my husband ate them on the second day!  Thanks for the great recipe! -- Jax in the French Alps

Made it for Chinese New Year, in mini meatloaf pans as gifts to family and friends.  This recipe is easy to follow and it really only takes 20 minutes to whip up everything before heading to the oven.  The finished product is moist and dense in flavour, probably due to the fact that I pre-soaked my fruits and nuts in rum for about a year.  It aged better that way and the flavour comes out concentrated.  This will be my family fruitcake recipe I will use year in and out!  Thanks Mark!  BonnieVic-Malaysia

This was fantastic! I didn't use nuts, citrus or cherries, just mixed fruit and some prunes diced the same size as sultanas (just went by eyeballing the prune amounts). Took it to my Father's house for Christmas Day and everybody went back for seconds, we served it warm with brandy custard or thickened cream and it was so delicious. I didn't cook it the full time as I checked it about 15 minutes before and a skewer inserted in the middle showed it was cooked. I then smeared about 1 tblspn of bourbon over the top and just trimmed the non-stick paper so it was level with the cake and wrapped in foil which helped to soften the top of the cake (it steams) so that it's like the commercial types with the soft, smooth top and not rock hard. I put it in the fridge overnight, next morning left the non-stick paper on, double wrapped in plastic wrap and once in foil again and stored in fridge for five days and it traveled in an old biscuit tin. Seriously wonderful and can I say it blew all the other plum puddings and celebratin cakes that I had bought from the supermarket out of the water? It did. No sooner had I cut a slice, then someone would grab it. Oh yeah, boil the ingredients in a sort of larger style saucepan because the baking soda makes things bubble up.

I loved this cake. I first soaked the chopped fruit in about 1/2 cup of brandy for three days. I really think it made a difference. I followed the cooking instructions almost exactly, with the newspaper and all. I did only cook it for an hour instead of the whole hour and forty,though. I think it would have been way too dry otherwise. I made the cake two weeks before Christmas and let it sit in my fridge in a large tin. Every other day I drizzled it with a little brandy. So delicious! I even got a friend of mine(who DOES NOT like fruitcake,haha)to admit that it was very good.

I've never been a big fruitcake fan, but this was delicious!  I made it with a few variations:  * Dried cranberries marinated in vodka for a few days until fully re-hydrated * Raisins marinated in water until fully rehydrated * Two large apples, diced * Marinated the typical neon dried fruit blend for fruitcakes in vodka for a few days until re-hydrated * Walnuts and pecans because I had them on hand * Used cooking spray on cake pan and it came out fine -- no parchment or newspaper needed.    I was trying to get a more natural tasting fruitcake and would probably add more apples/cranberries and decrease the neon fruitcake blend next time.  Rum taste was very mild and added a nice warm undertone.  This cake would probably be excellent with just apple pieces and I may try that next time.

Baking a fruit cake for the very first time and having it turn out so beautifully, was never in my wildest dream. Thank you, Mark, for sharing this recipe and I must say that it has done me a great favor, as Christmas is nearing and I wanted this festive season to be a special one since I've just tied the knot early this year. The cake is so moist and soaking the fruits in Rum, added to its richness. And the final touch - I've poured some Rum over the cake as well once it's all cooled down. Right now, I can't seem to keep my hubby away from the cake. Thanks once again and I shall keep baking this cake, year in, year out. 
Regards, Nisha Rayan - Kuala Lumpur -

My oven seems to be a turbo fan forced without an option to swap to slow, so when I followed the times as suggested the cake was too dry.  On my second go I shaved off 20 minutes for the second part, came out ok, but I think I could still go another 10 minutes and it would be great.  So to recap 40min at 160 and then 1 hour at 150 - but do test!

For the Australians out there here is the cup version of the recipe. 2 cups mixed fruit; 1 cup glace cherries - not chopped, so you need to chop them up after meausuring; 1/4 cup mixed peel; 1/2 cup walnuts - not chopped up, so will need to do that as well; 2 cups white sugar; 170g butter; 1 cup milk; 1/2 teaspoon mixed spice ( I used 1 teaspoon); 1/2 teaspoon bicarbonate of soda ( same as baking soda); 2 1/2 cups self raising flour; 2 eggs.  I also soaked the mixed fruit in rum for a few days as well. 

Oh by the way, none of the first dry cake was left, gone within days. My husband said it was perfectly OK...

This was so good right out of the oven.  I wanted to wait but it smelled so good. I got 6 small loaves out of one recipe.  I omitted the citrus peel and added dates and raisins for the dried fruit. I will be making this again.

I have never been a fan of fruit cakes because I hate that fake fruit in there. I used different dried fruits(mixed berries,apricot,dates and pineapple) It turn out excellent. I would say I am a fan of this recipe.

This is the easiest Fruitcake recipe, and turns out great. I did a batch where I soaked all the fruit 24 hours in brandy, and it mellowed out perfectly after the cake sat for a few days. I did four small loaf pans, knocked a half hour off the second bake time.

It needed something to fit my tastes, so I changed a few things. I used brown sugar, 1 Tb cocoa powder, added raisins, and put in rum extract. Then the spices I used were cinnamon, allspice, and corriander. What I got was a beautiful,dark, cake.

Like most others, I give this recipe 5 stars.  All the reviews had good ideas that I wanted to incorporate, so I printed the recipe and jotted down various ideas.  I soaked my chopped fruit in Captain Morgans Rum 3 to 5 days in advance.  I really like lots of pecans in my fruitcake, so I added 2 cups (not chopped) vs. 1 cup.  I also used 1/4 c. molasses and cut back 1/4 c. on the sugar and milk.  I baked at 325° for 25 minutes and then 300° for 42 minutes.  Next time I will line the bottoms of the loaf pans with parchment paper.  Had a little trouble with one sticking to the bottom.  Before I wrapped these up in waxed paper and cling wrap, I basted with rum.  Now I'm basting with rum about every 5 days until I'm ready to giving these away.  When I pull them out to baste, I have a taster loaf that I've tried a couple times now.  Oh man!  Is it ever good.  I think the recipe could be renamed Fruitcake Crack or Fruitcake Addiction!

I posted when I first found the recipe about a missing ingredient...duh on me, it was there but I just didn't see it listed at the end :)  Anyway, for my first fruitcake ever, this turned out beautiful! Reading other reviews it seems that it's wonderfully flexible as far as ingredients preferred. I tossed in some raisins I had, added twice as many walnuts as called for, added a bit more spices to the mix and tossed some pumpkin pie spice I had on hand. WOW! This converted three people who claim to hate fruitcake to fruitcake lovers...or should I say, loving *this* fruitcake. It's been requested every holiday now so it'll be in heavy rotation! And boy! Was it nice & heavy! It really is almost too easy to make. I didn't use the brown paper around the angel food cake pan and it turned out perfect, right down to the minute. Thank you to both the original poster *and* his Mom for the recipe!!! Ya' done good!!!  :D

I have made this 2 Christmases in a row and WOW, it is incredible!  I used candied fruitcake mixed fruit that you buy in the store that I soaked in amaretto for about 2 weeks prior to baking.  The day I prepared it, I used regular dried fruit.  This year I used apricots and strawberries and it was delicious.  Instead of mixed spice, I used a combination of nutmeg, cinnamon, and pumpkin pie spice.  I also added vanilla extract.  It's really such a versatile recipe, as long as you get the basic preparation.  I feel you can experiment with different fruits, nuts, and spices.  I also didn't use the newspaper...I just covered the pan with parchment paper on the inside and foil on the outside.  Don't be intimidated by fruitcake or think that it's not for you.  I have converted people who hated fruitcake with this recipe.  It is so moist, dense, and sweet.  I can see this becoming a Christmas tradition in my household.  You must try it!

I was very excited about this recipe, but it didn’t work for me. The flavour was great, but the cake seemed too dry. Not at all what I was looking for. The boiled mixture looked like a nice smooth caramel, which lends a nice flavour and smell to the cake, but it is too dry.

I have made this several times to use as both Christmas cake and a birthday cake. And I really love the cake it makes!  I read Dorothy's review and had to read it again, sounds like she used humans as ingredients, thanks for a really big smile to start my day Dorothy!

Thank you.
