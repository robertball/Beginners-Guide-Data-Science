I took another reviewers suggestion and cut the bacon into bits and fried it, before adding it to the bottom of the baking pan. I also used a box of yellow Jiffy cake mix, because the store I went to was out of white. My kids loved this. Cake for breakfast? Heck yeah. There were NO leftovers. I had made eggs on the side and this meal was reminiscent of McDonald's McGriddles. I'll make this again. I served this with homemade pancake syrup, also from this site. NOTE: Butter or grease the heck out of your pan. Otherwise, you aren't getting that cake out, no sir.

I won best dessert at Bacon Fest at work!  I did do what another review suggested and cut the bacon up in little pieces instead of the strips.  I also subbed 1/2 tsp of vanilla extract + 1/2 tsp cin. extract for the maple extract (didn't have any).  The cake by itself was excellent as well, will be using that for a future recipe this fall :)

Not a make again receipe, sorry.  If I were to make it again the bacon needs to be cooked longer and then crumbled. It was awful trying to cut the bacon and the cake so moist. The grandkids gave it a one star too.

I also crumbled the bacon for the pan and added some to the cake.  I went a step further and frosted 2 layers of this cake with buttercream frosting with bacon and maple flavoring added.  It was a hit with my bacon loving family.

Oh my God, this has to be one of the best things that I have ever made. This was so good! It was a hit for everyone that ate it too. The only thing that changed was that I cooked the bacon till it was crispy. I also cut up two pieces of bacon and put it inside.  The cake ended up perfect, and there was no problem cutting the cake.

This was great but I did make a few changes.  I used yellow cake mix instead of white, added 1/2 tsp. Cinnamon and 1 tsp. Vanilla extract to the mix.  I took other's advice and cut the bacon into 1 inch strips before frying and fried til crispy.  I added about 8 strips into the mix but used the rest as stated in the original recipe.  I sprinkled the finished cake with powdered sugar and served with whipped cream and fresh fruit.  Made this as my daughter's birthday breakfast and the whole family loved it!

I saved this recipe but held off making it for quite sometime now. I decided I would try it with my kids this morning. I did as others suggested by cutting the bacon up before frying it. I served with eggs and milk and the kids LOVED it! I probably wont make it too much because I try to give the kids healthy breakfast but for a treat this was perfect!

This tastes really good!  I'm kind of a klutz in the kitchen...as per my usual, I didn't grease the bundt pan well enough.  I thought the bacon would bring its own grease but it carmelized nicely with the brown sugar.  Some of the cake stuck to the sides as well, so I had to  piece it back together and scrape out the bacon from the pan to set back on top.

To hide my big mess I made a maple glaze.  In a pan on medium heat, cook 2 tbsp butter, 1/4 cup maple syrup, one cup of confectioners sugar.  Whisk until smooth, drizzle over the cake.  It hid all my imperfections and tasted great!

I have two dozen guests in the other room and what am I about serve up?  A pile of crumbs.  I followed the recipe, adding a few bacon bits into the batter as the only difference.  I am not a novice cake maker, either; didn't make any rookie errors like over-mixing.  Good idea, it just didn't work and now I'm stuck in the kitchen trying desperately to think of a plan B.

I have made this cake several times.  I have had a few hits and misses.  The first couple of times, the cake was very crumbly and I had problems getting it out of the pan.  Another time I made it in a bundt pan and like with other reviewers, it stuck badly.  I sent the crumbs to work with my husband and no one cared how crumbly it was, they was, they loved it-as do a couple of my grandchildren.  I get asked to make it a couple of times a year for birthday luncheons at his work.  I use a regular box of white cake mix and make a 9" x 13" cake.  I cut  up the bacon before frying it and I don't double the amount of maple syrup called for, just add a little bit more.  The best advice I can give is to line the bottom of the pan with parchment paper and grease it before adding the bacon and brown sugar.  Since I started doing that I haven't had any problems getting it out of the pan.  I have to make one today, so I think I will try adding some of the bacon to the batter as a few have suggested so maybe it will cut easier and not  crumble as bad.

I made this cake for a party and it was a BIG hit!!!  My modifications:  >Crumbled bacon and fried til crisp, >Added about 2 slices (crumbled) to the batter, >Made as a Bundt cake (liberally buttered pan), >Used sugar free maple syrup, >Sprinkled Confectioners Sugar on top before serving.  It was very moist and tasted wonderful!!!  Definitely a do-again recipe!

I crumbled the bacon and use a Bundt pan.  The batter was very watery and it took much longer than the 15-20 minutes suggested to bake.  The look and taste are good but the cake is a bit too crumbly.

This recipe is so good ! I made it on Christmas morning. After the kids opened their presents, they went straight for the cake. The bacon came out chewy and crisp, and the cake super moist and sweet. This is my fav and my kid's fav breakfast ! Serve with maple syrup and extra fried bacon if desired :)

My husband and daughter absolutely loved this. I do think cutting the bacon into smaller pieces would be better than leaving them whole. It was a quick and easy breakfast for supper. I will definitely be making this again.

Wish I had read reviews first. told my husband the next time I make this I would crumble the bacon and not leave it in full strips, then read reviews most everyone suggested doing that. I will be making this again, maybe do cupcake with this recipe too. Guess I'll start reading the reviews first.

I was looking for a bacon cake to share with my dog for his 13th Birthday. I followed other reviewer's suggestions and cut the bacon into pieces and fried it to a crisp. Instead of vegetable oil, I used the bacon grease when making the cake. I also baked it according to the instruction on the box. I used a good coat of cooking spray and used a 13x9 cooking pan. Unfortunately the cake stuck to the pan and came out in pieces:( I'd definitely use parchment paper next time. The cake mix I used had sprinkles so I didn't add bacon to the batter. It reminds me of pancakes and bacon.

I made this cake tonight.   Smelled great,  looked great,  until I tried to get it out of the pan!   I made it in a bundt pan, which I buttered generously and sprayed with cooking spray,  but part of the top still stuck and tore.  Tastes good anyway.

must have done something wrong, bacon was soggy and unappealing.
