We tried this tonight, and I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised at how good this tasted.  I am weary of trying "other" meats because I don't like meat when it's gamey but this was excellent.  I would cut down on the pesto a bit because I felt it was a little strong, but otherwise it was excellent!  It paired well with the pasta and the red roasted potatoes I made (since the kids are picky about their pasta.)

As an Allrecipes Allstar, I was asked to make this recipe with bison top sirloin steaks.  I cheated slightly in the preparation of the bison steaks. I marinated them in a mixture of 1/2 cup grapeseed oil, 1/4 cup soy sauce, and 2 Tbsp McCormick Montreal steak seasoning.  I let the steaks marinate for about 45 minutes (you don't want to marinate any longer). I also cut down the pesto to about 85 grams (1/4 cup plus 2 Tbsp) It was MORE than enough pesto. I didn't add the pesto to the top of my steaks, just to the pasta. This recipe was simple, tasty, and healthy!  In grilling the steaks I had to keep in mind that due to how lean the bison is that it required 1/3 LESS cooking time, and heat! If you follow the directions as stated just remember the pesto needs to be divided (which it doesn't state).

Wow! This was really good! I followed Sarah Stone's recommendation of marinating the steaks, and I also grilled the steaks instead of pan frying. I used the Simple Garlic and Basil Pesto recipe from this site. I carefully grilled the steaks to 145 degrees (some may have been closer to 150), and they were fantastic. I'd never had bison before, and have decided that I would eat it all the time if it weren't so expensive. Very tender. The pasta was OK (I added more pesto that recipe called for, and also found it needed salt). I might tweak the pasta next time by adding a little more olive oil, pepper, salt, oregano, and a dash of red pepper. Otherwise, outstanding recipe!

This was just ok as written.  The bison was flavorful but a little on the chewy side for my liking.  The consensus at the table was the dish as a whole was lacking in flavor and was boring.  Not sure I would make this again.

I made this with bison ribeyes instead of sirloin and it was delicious!

Fabulous and easy. Good enough for company and easy enough for everyday. I used regular beef steaks as I have no idea where to get bison in Wisconsin.
