I'm french canadian and this dessert was made at least every other week, because of its simplicity and low cost (she used a mix of brown sugar and water instead of maple sirup and did not use cream or other dairy). 

I compared it to my mom's and hers was better. Truth be told, the cake part was about the same, but she would bake it in a square glass dish (8in x 8in), which allowed all the liquid to be poured onto, which turned this moistened cake into a pudding. 

I highly recommend the use of a dish allowing all the cream/sirup to be poured and baked with the cake.

I love Pouding Chomeur! The first time I had it was in Toronto, Ontario, Canada at a French restaurant several years ago.  Now that I am in California, did a "Canadian Themed" dinner and this was a perfect dessert. It was creamy, not overly sweet because I didn't add all the sugar to the cake part. Served it with vanilla bean ice cream and berries. Everyone loved the dessert and wanted more. Give it a try as it will not disappoint and it is super easy to make!!

I used 1 c maple syrup and 1 c cream and there was a perfect amount of sauce for a deep dish pie plate. Used salted butter so cut salt amount to 1/4 tsp,   It took 40 min to cook and did not boil over in the stove.  Taking this to work for Festival du Voyageur week.  Heho!

PS - this cake/pudding was very tasty but having more sauce is recommended.

I loved the textural component added by the maple cream sauce. A true restaurant quality dessert! I'm making it again for my Mom for our Mother's Day brunch!
