HUGE hit with the family!  Has become one of our favorites!  We love fruit salad and what we like most about this one, is it's not so sticky sweet as some of them can be.  Instead of heavy whipping cream whipped, I just add cool whip (saves some time!).  Wonderful recipe!!!  Thank yoU!!!

I think this needs flour to thicken as similar recipes have included.
