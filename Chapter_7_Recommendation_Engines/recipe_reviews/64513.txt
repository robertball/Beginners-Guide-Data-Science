These were HEAVENLY!  My husband and I would give them 10 stars if we could.   I lined a grill basket with tinfoil and put the chicken and some marinade into it and grilled the pieces that way.  I used dried rosemary and cut the sugar in half.  I also used low fat ranch dressing and completely omitted the salt because it just isn't necessary.  These were melt in your mouth MOIST and DELICIOUS!!  Even my 19-month-old and 3-year-old gobbled this up.  The marinade from the grill basket was also incredible poured over white rice.  EXCELLENT RECIPE!!!!!
EDIT:  I've since made this recipe on the stove top and in the oven in order to use up all the marinade (which is INCREDIBLE on rice) and both alternate methods are good by the oven is a better 2nd choice as the stove top method tended to dry the chicken out a bit but still tasted great!  I bake it with all the marinade on 450 for 20 minutes.  Melt in your mouth moist!    EDIT AGAIN:  I tried another reviewers recommendation to use Trader Joe's ranch dressing...just not that good with it.  It might be slightly healthier for you but I'm willing to splurge for the little dressing that's used and use hidden valley ranch light.  Made a HUGE difference to my family and to guests who've had it both ways.  Cut back on oil...but use flavorful ranch dressing!

Very tender chicken!  I would use this marinade for chicken breasts as well.  We reserved a little of the marinade and added more ranch dressing for a nice dipping sauce on the side. UPDATE: I've made these so many times now because they're just that good.  You can cut down on the oil and substitute dried rosemary for the fresh if you don't have any on hand. I always use the sugar and 1 tsp. of salt vs. two. If you're looking to cut down on calories Hidden Valley Ranch Light Buttermilk Dressing works great with this recipe.  I usually marinate this at least 6 hours. No matter what you do - it's bound to come out moist and delicious.

This was fabulous!  Based on other reviews, I cut back the olive oil to 1/4 cup and omitted the salt and am glad I did.  Threw fresh rosemary twigs (soaked in water for 1/2 hour) in the smoker while barbequing these and the aroma, oh my, the aroma!  If I was Italian I would be kissing my fingers.  Momma Mia!!!  Thanks for a great recipe!

WOW! These were fantastic! Even my 19-month-old gobbled these up! The only ingredient I left out was the salt. I made one batch of marinade for the chicken and another batch to marinate vegetables...onions, portabello mushrooms and quartered new potatoes (about 2 lbs). After you quarter the potatoes put them in a microwave safe dish and add 1/2 cup water. Microwave on high for 13-15 minutes, just stir halfway through cooking time. Otherwise the potatoes would never be done on the grill at the same time as everything else on the skewer! After microwaving let them cool a little and then marinade.  I marinaded everything in a couple of ziploc bags for about 2 hours.  We will definitely make this again and again!

My family enjoyed this meal immensely. I marinated thie veggies that I used also (Vidalia onion, red and green bell pepper, and yellow squash) and it came out absolutely luscious. I made this with both the dried rosemary and again with the fresh rosemary, and I think that the fresh rosemary really adds a lot to the flavor.  This will be a favorite recipe in the summer grilling months at our home!

4 1/2 stars in our house!  I baked chicken pieces in the marinade at 350 for about 20 minutes.  I thought it was delicious, my husband thought it was good.  I might decrease the lemon juice and vinegar next time because it was a little tangy for our taste, but the chicken was tender, and the sauce was delicious over rice.

These kabobs are flavorful, juicy & fabulous! Followed the recipe almost exactly and used fresh rosemary, except I took a hint from other reviewers and cut back on the salt a little bit.  I also marinated red & green peppers, sweet onions and mushrooms with the chicken, reserving a little of the marinade to use for basting. It took a little time to thread everything on the skewers and a bit messy, but it was so worth it! Next time I'm going to try putting things on the skewers first, then marinate. These would be wonderful to make ahead for a party or any kind of get-together!

The vinegar and lemon juice really tenderizes the meat, and the flavors go very well together.  Trader Joes has the best ranch dressing I have found so far (no affiliation).  It's organic, all natural ingredients, uses real buttermilk, has no high fructose corn syrup, has less fat than regular ranch, super creamy, and tastes great.

I made this for 100 people last weekend, for 80 people the weekend before and for 70 the weekend before that.  I can't tell you how many asked for the recipe and how many said it was the best meal they'd ever had.  I marinated whole chicken breasts for about 6 hours.  I took them out of the marinade, scored them lengthwise several times and grilled them on a gas griddle.  When they were done, I cut them in strips and put them in an electric roaster with the marinade.  I let them slow cook on low heat for about and hour and a half.  Served over white rice with the marinade as a topping gravy.  Broccoli with garlic butter and cashews and a roll.  Beautiful plate, wonderful meal!

This recipe intrigued me because it was different from any chicken dish I have tried.  I printed the recipe and planned on preparing - but the weekend got very busy (hence - no cooking!)  Sunday I was going to be gone until past dinner - I ask my husband if he would mind preparing the dish.  I left the recipe and all ingredients sitting on the counter.  The results were amazing!  Kids loved it- the chicken was tender and flavorful, and husband was proud declaring  this would now be his signature dish that he would make anytime (yipee!)  The only thing I know he did different was to use white wine vinegar instead of white vinegar.  I'm not sure why and I don't believe it really mattered.   Can't wait to invite friends over and have hubby wow 'em!

This was really good. I did cut the chicken into chunks, but instead of skewering/grilling, I baked them in the sauce (20 min/350*), then served with the sauce over garlic butter rice. A couple of notes: 1. I noticed some people commented that the rosemary taste is too strong. If you're using dried rosemary instead of fresh, remember to cut the amount in half (if you don't like a noticeable rosemary flavor, you should consider cutting it more). 2. I noticed a lot of people said they ommitted the sugar. In my mind, that sweet edge pushed this recipe over the top.

Theresa, dang these are great! My in-laws said I made the best "non-big" holiday dinner ever when I served these with Zucchini Cornbread Casserole and Barbequed Marinated Flank Steak from this site. I used ranch dill dressing and rice wine vinegar. Omitted sugar and salt. Marinated overnight. Delish!

DELICIOUS & MOIST, even tho' I reduced the oil to 2-3 Tblsp.!! I did marinate it for 18+ hours to ensure the meat was infused with the fresh rosemary & other flavors. Excellent!  I've made this several times in several ways in the past 2 months: I've used bottled Hidden Valley, dry ranch mix, & AR's "No-Guilt Zesty Ranch Dip" (a lowfat dip from this site) - ALL were terrific. With the latter, I combined: 1/3 c. of the NG Zesty Ranch + 1/3 c. buttermilk + double the rosemary + increased all other ingredients by 50% (incl'g chicken; only 2-3 Tbl oil!) = excellent, & comparable to orig. recipe. For the pkt of dry "Simply Organic Peppercorn Ranch", I mixed: 1 Tblsp. dry mix + 1/16 tsp. dry onion powder + 4 Tbl. buttermilk + 1-1/2 Tblsp. each of mayo & sour cream = ranch dressing; then added all the other ingredients. I highly recommend any of these methods for a truly delicious grilled chicken kabob! ** UPDATE: Last time,  I skewered the chicken on stalks of the rosemary plant. I left the leaves on top, while deleafing the skewer part. I don't know if this added more rosemary flavor, but it did make for a beautiful, rustic presentation of the kabobs.

A-Mazing!  I have made this quite a few times, but I don't always make kabobs.  I grill using whole chicken breasts, then slice and use for salads.  The ideas are endless!  Oh, I prefer making ranch dressing using the packets just because I think it tastes better than bottled.  If you can do this, I think it improves the taste of the marinade so much better.  It's not necessary though :) Thanks for an awesome recipe!

Very, very good. A little too salty for me, so I will reduce that next time.

So simple and so good!
I did AS IS, and don’t think I would modify it.  When these babies hit the BBQ, the smell was heavenly.  The chicken was moist, tender and the rosemary really came through.  My two little ones gobbled their portions up.  The combination of all the ingredients was spot on!
If I had to change anything, I would experiment with different brands/types of ranch dressings.  Since it is a prominent part of the recipe, I am sure that one could find nice little twists for this great recipe.  Although marked as optional, I added half of the proposed sugar, which I will leave out next time.  Also, I would not marinade much beyond an hour or the lemon juice and vinegar would start over tenderizing the chicken.

Very moist and tasty!! I marinated the boneless chicken breasts in a homemade ranch dressing yesterday morning. I used, “Ranch Dressing II,” from this website. After reading other reviews regarding the salt, I decided to cut back to 1/4 teaspoon. I also cut the worcestershire sauce down to 1T and white sugar to 1/2 T. The lemon juice and herbs really made the dressing burst with fresh flavors. It was also the buttermilk from the ranch dressing that really helped tenderdize the chicken meat. The grilling time was approximate. The golden brown sear on the chicken left a carmelization -very nice. The chicken meat was so tender and juicy, not tough or dry! It  was seasoned perfectly with a good hint of the fresh rosemary -delicious! Loved it! I am so glad that I cut back on the amount of salt and marinated it for 24 hours. We all really enjoyed our kabobs. I would make it this exact same way again. I served this with, "White and Wild Rice Pilaf," also from this website.

I tried these this summer and they were ok but when I took a reader's advice and baked them at 350 for 25 minutes, they were out of this world!!!  The sauce over rice was heavenly.  I will be making these a lot now that I discovered how much better they are baked!

made this for dinner last night & hubby loved it so much he cleaned his plate with a spoon to get every delicious drop of this delicious sauce!!  Only changes I made were to reduce the salt to 1 tsp. instead of 2 tsp. (per other reviewer's advice -- Thx!)  and we ended up having to bake it (at 350 for 20 minutes) as a HUGE thunderstorm came up just as we were getting ready to warm up the grill, but I can't WAIT to try it on the grill next time!  Next time, I'll reduce the oil by a little (maybe 1/4 cup) and divide the marinade into 2 batches, to marinate some veggies for the skewers too!  (maybe onion, red/green bell pepper, yellow squash/zuchinni, etc).  I'm also going to try substituting this sauce for the usual Cream of ... soup in my favorite Chicken Casserole recipe.   Oh! would also be good as a Seafood Casserole, marinating shrimp, scallops, etc. in this and adding a little rice and topping with some dried bread crumbs!  REALLY REALLY GOOD SAUCE!! Thx for the recipe Theresa Spencer!

Even after adding additional seasoning, it wasn't enough flavor for my family.  My daughter ended up dipping it in her typical BBQ sauce (a sign of blandness).  Will try something different next time.

Didn't change a thing to this recipe and it has become a standard go-to dinner for my family. Absolutely fail-safe and perfect every time. We have made it after marinating it overnight and other times only letting it marinade a half hour or so and it is spectacular every time. So good with brown rice!!! Also sometimes use extra rosemary because we love it, but it's not necessary. HIGHLY recommend this recipe as is!!!!!

Loved by everyone.  Found out much later that my 11-year-old thought these had fallen in the grass, so he just picked off the rosemary and ate them anyhow.  How funny!

Heavenly.  I reduced the oil and it came out just fine.  Also - if using wooden skewers soak them in water first so the ends don't burn up.  I had a bottle of Chardonnay with this which was just simply mah-va-lous.

Yumm!  Probably the best chicken recipe I've ever made.  Something about this recipe keeps the chicken so moist and flavorful.  I made these for a group and received compliments from everbody.  I will for sure be making these again.  I added red & green pepper, red onion, and mushrooms to the kabobs.

I've tried many chicken recipes and have cooked chicken every way possible and this recipe is by far our #1 favorite.  Husband and boys (ages 10 & 6) love it.  Followed recipe exactly.  Must be grilled.

This was great, omitted the sugar. I marinated it for 3 hours with zucchini, then skewered zucchini, yellow squah, vidalia onions and green peppers was excellent. Chicken was moist and very flavorful, will definitely make again. Grandaughter loved it.

This is a great recipe.  I also marinated large halved mushrooms in the sauce and the flavors were amazing together.

I followed the recipe exactly, except I didn't cut up the chicken. I just marinated boneless/skinless chicken breasts and grilled them as is.  They were wonderful!  Very moist and tender with good flavor.  The rosemary was very subtle - I'm thinking I'll add just a tiny bit more next time.

This is a can't miss recipe! I added personal "touches" by adding: squash, zucchini, red & green pepper & onion. I ALWAYS prepare the kabobs and marinade overnights before GRILLING them. We steam some broccoli and rice for "sides" to complete things. UmUm

Oh my. This is stellar. I am a beginner cook and even I made this dish turn out superb. The combo of ingredients is a bit odd but it sure works well when cooked. My only changes were to reduce the salt and oil by half. I do not have a grill so I baked the chicken on 350 for 20 minutes and then broiled it for a few minutes to crisp it a bit. As suggested by others, I also marinated and baked a separate pan of onions and red bell peppers (cut into chunks) - also baked and then briefly broiled.  Thank you Allrecipes.com and Theresa Spencer for this amazing recipe.  Update:  I mixed and marinated the chicken and veggies in two zip lock baggies. I lined my two baking pans with heavy duty reynolds wrap. Clean up was a breeze,

Wow. I cut into 1 inch cubes, marinated overnight, and grilled on med-high for 8 minutes (turning once). The chicken was so tender it started to fall off the skewer at the end of cooking. Be sure to let it rest before serving.  Virtually melted in our mouth.  I used the ranch II recipe on this website.

REALLY thought I had reviewed this before and was just coming back for an update but guess I failed to review it before.  I've made this several times with the exception being to use boneless, skinless chicken THIGHS instead of breasts and not using skewers.  FABULOUS recipe!  (Kabobs are just tedious to me) Tonight I made it with chicken blsl breasts (still not skewered) but the ranch I had  already opened was HVR "Farmhouse Originals" roasted onion and Parmesan flavor.  THAT was just as wonderful.  Love this recipe!

What a disappointment these were.  I used ranch dressing made from a mix on this site, which I have used before and we love, but the addition of worstershire just seemed to overwhelm everything.  Now I have to find a way to use all the uneaten chicken leftovers.

I love this recipe and have made it several times.  The only change I make is to cut back the oil to 1/4 cup.  The longer you marinate this, the better.  This is good on skewers like the recipe suggests but I've also used the marinade on boneless skinless chicken breasts.

Yep.  Everyone was right.  These are amazing.  My boyfriend is THE pickiest eater ever, so I was reluctant to try something new.  But he loved them and told me I could put this into our rotation.  I followed other reviewers suggestion to use only 1/3 cup of olive oil, and half the salt.  Everything else I followed exactly.  Seriously, these are awesome!

Succulent and just plain scrumptious, these tender morsels of chicken will definitely grace my table again!  I used light ranch dressing, a little less oil, and very little additional salt.  I thought that I had fresh rosemary in the fridge but I did not.  Not being a huge fan of dried, I used fresh oregano instead and it was very tasty.  I am certain that rosemary would have been a better choice, however, and I cannot wait to make them again with the prescribed herb.  I was afraid that marinating for only 30 minutes as the recipe dictated would not be enough for either flavor or tenderizing but I got a late start with dinner and it was all I had.  I need not have worried; the chicken was so delicious that we all went back for seconds and, truth be told, resisting a third helping took some willpower.  Great recipe!

I am finally getting around to reviewing this recipe.  I have made this at least 5 times within the past year and my family absolutely loves it.  There is no need to modify it. It is fantastic as written.  We like to serve it with Trader Joes Flatbread and Trader Joes Tzatziki Sauce. YUM!  I wanted to thank Theresa Spencer for sharing this wonderful healthy recipe.

Excellent!!!  I made exactly as written except I marinated for about 12 hours.  Delicious!  I will definitely make again.  I was hesitant because of the ranch dressing but it's not a strong flavor at all.  It just makes the meat moist and adds a hint of flavor.

This is an awesome recipe! I didn't make them as kabobs..just used boneless, skinless chicken breasts. First time I was ever able to make juicy chicken breasts on the grill.

This is FAB!  I was looking everywhere for the perfect summer dish to whip up for my mom's birthday and after reading the reviews I knew I couldn't go wrong.  It is so easy and SO delicious!!  I opted to use 1/3 cup of oil instead of 1/2 cup like many suggested and made a separate bowl of marinade for veggies.  I used green, red, and yellow peppers, zucchini, mushrooms, and sweet onions and then put those on separate skewers.  Besides the veggies, I served the chicken with white rice and garlic bread.  Other than the oil, I followed the rest of the recipe to a "T" and it all turned out excellent.  I would suggest this recipe to anyone looking for a simple summer meal that is sure to please!

I made this last night under the broiler because our grill was out of gas....I reduced the oil by half and kept the rest of the recipe the same, using light ranch dressing.  This was SO GOOD.  The chicken was so tender and delicious.  I used 1/2 the marinade for the chicken and 1/2 for red and green peppers, red onions and mushrooms, they turned out fabulous as well.  This morning I said to my husband that it was so good we'll definitely have to try that again and his response?  "Can we have it again tonight??"  Thank you for a great easy recipe, it will be in my rotation all summer long =)

This was very good!!!  I had to use white wine vinegar since that was what I had on hand and we used whole, boneless, skinless chicken breasts and left them whole and grilled them.  I marinated this for about 8 hours or so and my husband and kids gobbled it up.  I also doubled the marinade as I used more chicken than was called for.  I served this with roasted, red potatoes seasoned with fresh rosemary, olive oil, salt and pepper and corn on the cob.  An excellent chicken dish!

This was some pretty good tasting grilled chicken. It reminded me of chicken from a Greek restaurant. I had planned on making it before I realized it needed to be grilled, so I cooked it in the house. I used Marzetti lite ranch dressing and dried rosemary. My bottle said 1 tsp. dried equaled 1 Tblsp. fresh. I also used about 1/2 the black pepper suggested. But, as it gave me mild heartburn, I wish I would have left it out entirely. I had med/large chicken tenderloins and used 12 and it was perfect for the amount of marinade I had. I sprayed a square cast iron grill pan with pam and heated it on 6 for 10 minutes, then grilled 4 at a time, as is without skewers, 6 minutes per side flipping once. It tasted just like grilled chicken outside. The only downside was it was a tad salty, but it was juicy.

AWESOME!!! Super easy, uses ingredients typically on hand and YUMMY! I prefer brown sugar for the (optional) white, it caramellizes better on the grill. I now also increase ranch 1/4 cup and do as another reviewer suggested, make 2 separate batches and marinate chicken in one, and for the other, I micro 2 red potatoes 2.5 mins each, cut in about 2"chunks, marinate with onion chunks and whole mushrooms. If you do this, do chicken and veg on separate skewers cause the veg ones are done a few minutes quicker and 'shrooms would be burnt if it was all skewered together. This is now one of my absolute FAVORITE dinners! THANKS SO MUCH!!! ****UPDATE: Did the veg kabobs as mentioned above, but this time added squash and cherry tomatoes... OMG! I've made this at least once a week for the last 2 mos and NEVER repeat recipes with that kind of regularity, can't get enough of this meal!!!  SO MUCH better with fresh rosemary, but dried is good too in a pinch :)

Absolutely delicious! I set aside some marinade for basting, and my habibi was a whiz on the grill - cooked to perfection and not too dry. He said he basted them several times throughout the grilling. Along with the chicken we cooked red and green bell peppers, red onions, and mushrooms. Everything tasted absolutely splendid, or so said all of my guests, and I quite agree! I made the recipe almost exactly as written. I only subbed dried rosemary for the fresh - perhaps this recipe will convince me to grow some.

This is one my favorite quick recipes!  It is so yummy and simple to make.  I have even baked the chicken skewers at 350 degrees instead of grilling, and they came out moist and delicious!

This chicken was delicious.  I used strips of chicken breast and marinated sliced mushrooms as well, and left it all in the fridge for a few hours.  I covered the grill with foil and grilled it all, and then put it on small ciabatta loaves with some fresh mozzarella cheese.  Then stuck that in the oven until warm and melty.  Best paninis ever!  This chicken is great for sandwiches.

Update: After making this lots of times, we've found we like it best when we omit the lemon juice, vinegar, and sugar.

These absolutely melt in your mouth.  This may be the best chicken I have EVER tried.  I omitted the sugar and salt just for personal preference.  This is a big time keeper.

This recipe is truly phenominal!  I marinaded for probably 6 hours before grilling.  Everyone raved about these kabobs, and asked for the recipe after they were served.  I can't believe it took me so long to try these, but now that I have they will be on the dinner rotation all summer long!

Have made this twice now.  They are amazing.  I double the sauce and reserve about 1/4 cup for basting while they are grilling.  They are so flavorful and moist.   I also grill peaches with this recipe (just toss cut up peaches with a little olive oil, wrap in foil, and throw on the grill while the kabobs are cooking) and the combination is so tasty.  Will definitely be one of our regulars.

Delicious!! I pretty much followed the recipe as written. I added about 1 tsp of garlic powder and only used 1 tsp of salt. Don't forget the sugar! (I would reccomend you marinate it for at least an hour) -I made this with the Cheesy Ranch Potato Bake on this site, with peas. Yummm

My 2 year old who will NOT EAT MEAT ate these up tonight at dinner...we were giving high fives all around the table! :)  VERY simple, VERY good.  I  tossed the chicken and marinade with cubed zucchini, sweet onion, red and green pepper, and parboiled red potatoes.  Threw it together in less than 10 minutes (INCLUDING cutting the veggies!) and let it set in a covered glass bowl in my fridge all day.  I'd make them tomorrow if I didn't have leftovers already! :)  SUPER AWESOME!

This was outstanding. Be sure to soak the wood skewers in water for about 30 minutes or they will burn up. Made the recipe as stated exactly. I will make this for future cookouts.

Everyone in my family, including my 19 month old, liked this chicken recipe.  I added red bell pepper and red onion strips to the kabobs.  Baked the kabobs in the oven at 450 degrees for 10-12 min. each side (watched them carefully).  Omitted the sugar from the marinade.  Used dried rosemary, little less than 1/2 tablespoon.  Will make this again.  Was quick and easy.

We loved it! The most flavorful chicken we've had in a long time! The person saying there wasn't enough flavor obviously did something wrong! I broiled mine since we don't have a grill and the man still said it tasted like it came right off the barbeque! Thanks for this recipes, it will be repeated! I made and will not make any changes, it's perfect the way it is!

This was great! I was worried about baking it because I wasn't sure what kind of pan to use and I used more chicken breast halves than the recipe called for.  
I just dropped the kabobs into a 13x9x2 pan or something like that and did the bake at 450 for 20 minutes.
Came out great! Even though I forgot we were out of lemon juice when I was making the marinade and forgot to let it sit for 5 minutes.

We liked the unique ranch flavor and the chicken was nice & moist. I doubled the sauce part and used it over brown rice and for dipping.  BTW...IF.. you were to leave the (very fresh) chicken in the marinate for 3 days, like *somebody* unintentially did, you would still have a  delicious (not mushy at all) grilled chicken :0

The only change I made... was I used boneless, skinless breasts and didn't make them on skeweres.  These are really delicious.  No changes needed in anything~make as is.

Terrific marinade.  I didn't use any salt and used 1/2 the amount of oil in the recipe.  For my kabobs, I used chicken and shrimp on separate skewers, and they were delicious.  Everyone enjoyed them.

I thought the chicken came out moist and tender (as many reviews have mentioned) and the flavor was good. For me, I thought the worcestershire was way too "front and center" for a chicken kabob. I put aside about 1/2 of the marinade (per suggestions) before adding the chicken to use as a dipping sauce or to add to the rice I served it with. I didn't care for it on the rice but did like it as a dipping sauce. Overall an good recipe (slightly above ok but below really good) This was a nice easy dinner to throw together though since I had everything on hand.

This was very good and very easy to make, we used 1/2 ranch & 1/2 bacon ranch dressing, plus we used brown sugar instead of white, and garlic vinegar instead of white! it was very good and the aroma of rosemary was heavenly .... Don't forget to marinated the veggies you plan to put on you kabob's too, the onions were to die for!!! and the chicken salad sandwich I'm eating right now, was made with the left over from last night! ... this sandwich rocks© yabba dabba doo... enjoy, Fred

Excellent recipe.  Easy to make, very tender and flavorful. I used dried rosemary since I didn't have fresh, and I cooked them under the broiler.  Next time I'll make some vegetable skewers at the same time and try the marinade on the veggies too.

I grilled this at a tailgater for a college football game. Tons of people stopped by to see what I had on the grill. It gives off an amazing aroma, and tastes even better!

I made this when the power went out on the Woodstove!  Everyone loved it!  I put everything (cubed chicken, mushrooms, onions, red and orange and green peppers, tomatoes) in a Pyrex and covered with foil and cooked it for a half hour on the Woodstove, made wild rice, and poured extra marinade over everything.  So good!

This is the best chicken recipe ever!  As written, there never seems to be enough marinade, and seems to be too salty when I double the recipe.

2012-05-28  I had made this in a test run before our annual family gathering.  Making it according to the instructions resulted in chicken that was moist but lacking in the flavor I wanted.  The second time I made it, I made extra marinade that I put aside as a dipping sauce. & marinated the chicken for 24 hours before grilling.  The results were much better.

This was excellent!!!!  I used homemade ranch dip mix and buttermilk, as I don't buy ranch dressing.  I just grilled the chicken breasts whole, I didn't have time and was too lazy to make kabobs.  I would definately not add any extra salt.  It doesn't need it.  I also didn't add the optional sugar, and I didn't see why it would need it.  Will definately be making to take on the boat as kabobs.  YUM!

I wanted to cook it on the stove, so I fried it in margarine so it wouldn't get dry. It was delicious! I made the recipe EXACTLY as it was written and it is one of the most delicious recipes out there! Next time I will probably use a little less salt but that is it

This is such an easy recipe w/ great results.  Perfect mid-week family meal when you don't want to put a lot of effort into cooking.  It's not "knock your socks off" but it's pretty close; like I said, it's easy!  Don't overcook the chicken!

We normally do not like boneless chicken breast meat.  However, this recipe makes it great.  The chicken comes out very moist and flavorful.  I did decrease the salt to 1 tsp.  I normally like my food salty, and 1 tsp worked for me.

I have always made these exactly as the recipe states (ok, sometimes I use dried rosemary) and with or without sugar, it doesn't matter. They are awesome and I have never had anyone not like them.

Wow!  The entire family just loved this.  I made it exactly as stated.  Marinaded for about 8 hours (had a busy day).  The chicken was sooooo tender....I am intrigued.  Wondering exactly WHAT ingredient made it so moist! Oh well, bottom line is, this is my new "go to" recipe for chicken-ka-bobs!

I'm not accustomed to cooking with Rosemary. This recipe was delicious. I used it on chicken cutlets which I baked for 30 minutes at 350 since I don't own a grill. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because for my personal taste it was on the salty side. Next time I will use only 1 teaspoon of salt or maybe omit the salt altogether since the worcestershire sauce has enough salt as it is.

this chicken is KILLER! the whole family enjoys it. I buy individually frozen chicken breasts and set them in the marnade in a ziploc bag (with most of the air removed) and let them thaw for 2 days in the fridge. excellent. a standard in our home.

These are delicious. My family really likes the sauce--we usually double the ingredients for the sauce and marinate some veggies as well, putting them on the skewers with the chicken or separate. We've also just used the sauce and baked in the oven when weather wasn't grill-friendly. Note: for oven use, though, use a shallow pan or dish so that the chicken bakes through.

This is excellent. I cut down on the oil (used 1/4 cup) and may even cut it down further or replace it with water the next time I make this. The chicken was so tender! I think I will try adding veggies to the marinade and threading them onto the skewers as well.

Wonderful recipe.  The chicken was so tender, and the marinade was wonderful.  I used splenda instead of sugar, and it was undetectable.  I had to use dried rosemary, though, but I just cut down on the amount.  This is a keeper that I will use often.  Thanks so much.

I had seen this recipe recommended on the Recipe Exchange numerous times and decided to go ahead and try them.  After reading the reviews, I cut the salt in half and, because bottled ranch is pretty sweet, I didn't add the optional sugar.  These kabobs were SO good!  My daughter is having her 13th birthday in a little less than a month and she has requested these as part of the food at her party.  Next time I'll mix up some fresh Hidden Valley ranch dressing to use instead of the bottled stuff.  Since that dressing is less sweet, I'll add half of the sugar.  Thanks for a really good recipe!

It was very good and I'll make it again. I did something a little different though. I cooked chix on the stove for 4 minutes each side to sear it. i than marinated it and than threw it all in the oven on 350 for 1/2 hour or so. I scaled it down to 2 people but put a little extra ranch dressing in it. Next time, I might marinade it in the refrigerator before searing it for awhile. It's a keeper in our house.

I cooked this on the grill a few weeks ago and tonight I cooked in the oven in a baking dish. Doubled the marinade and added a lot more rosemary. Baked at 400F for 30mins. Also added mushroom and zucchini. 
Oven method preferred, meat was succulent cooked in the gravy. Hubby said it was absolutely delicious! Gravy tasted so good with hot rice!

I've made this twice, with different results.  The first time I cubed the chicken first, then marinaded for several hours in the fridge.  The second time I left the chicken breasts whole while marinating, and the meat didn't absorb the marinade well at all.  Cubing the chicken seems to be a key step here.  Will absolutely try again.  Thanks for sharing!

We enjoyed this different take on grilled chicken.  I cut back the olive oil to about 1 Tbs., and I had almost no flare-ups on the grill.  I omitted extra salt and used the marinade on boneless, skinless, whole chicken thighs.  After a sear on a hot grill, I moved them to the opposite side of the grid and finished cooking on low heat.  I hope there are some lefties, since I feel the chicken would be a great addition to a lunch salad.

I made this twice. The first time I grilled it and thought it was good, but not great. Chicken was tender and juicy as promised, but the rosemary, which I usually like, was just too intense for me.  The second time, I took the advice of other reviewers and baked it for 20 min in the marinade to serve over brown wild rice with a little of the sauce. I did not like the flavor at all.  The rosemary was even more overpowering and it was all just a bit tangy. Definitely if cooking in the marinade you should reduce the salt.  Just to mention, since not everyone cooks with kosher salt, I'd suggest using it for this recipe if you are following it to a T because regular table salt would make it incredibly salty.

These were wonderful. Don't over grill them or they will dry out to much. I didn't have Rosemary so i tried savory and loved it. I used 3 large skinless boneless chicken breast and had enough marinade to do 1 - 2 more. Will make again.

This is the first review I have ever done and it is well worth it! This chicken was amazing! I doubled the marinade, I didn't cut back on the olive oil because I thought the olive oil would soak into the chicken and make it moist. I chopped up some rosemary and then I took a whole sprig and put it in the marinade and chopped up the chicken and had it in the fridge for about 2 hours. I then put them onto the bamboo skewers (after I soaked them in water) with some red onion pieces in between the chicken. I cooked them in a grill pan on my stove and they came out amazing! I wish I had taken a picture, they tasted even better than they looked. They literally just burst with flavor and melted right in my mouth. I could eat this every day and never get tired of it. After I had got home from the grocery store, I realized I forgot the lemon, so I didn't add lemon juice, but it was still as tasty as ever!

I've made this recipe several times did not change a thing except that I did not use the optional sugar.
Fantastic, moist chicken one of my wife's favorite kebabs.
Did make this once using boneless/skinless chicken thighs, even moister yet, I think that will be the way that I will keep making them.
Thanks Theresa for a truly easy and tasty recipe!

What I liked best about this recipe is that it keeps the chicken moist and flavor.  The only change I made was  I added green pepper, onion and mushrooms to the kabobs.  Delicious!

Marinated chicken for five hours, other than that, I changed nothing.  I served this chicken to my in-law's and enjoyed many compliments as they devoured this delicious dish!  This will become a summertime family favorite.

Even my husband, who is not a rosemary fan, loved these! His words were, "If you made this every day, I wouldn't complain." I halved the marinade and used 1.5 breasts cut into strips and baked them in the oven since we don't have a grill. So juicy and delicious!

This was pretty tasty! I didn't have rosemary, so I used an herbal mix that I had on hand which had rosemary, thyme, lavendar, etc...in it. Turned out pretty good! Very filling for some reason!

Now I know why this recipe is so highly rated....it's because this chicken is delicious!  I made up the marinade and let my chicken pieces marinate all day while I was at work.  When I got home, I just put them on the skewers with some added red peppers, green peppers, purple onion and zucchini chunks.  I served with rice pilaf and we loved it.  The chicken was very moist and flavorful.  I will definitely be making again and again.

Used reduced fat ranch, and forgot lemon juice.  This was still delicous!  This is definitley a keeper.   * Note revision: Made this again, so yummy.  Also, need to mention my "super taster" picky eater, ate this and liked it.  This says a lot in my book!

This is a GREAT recipe!!  I followed the recipe for the marinade almost exactly except I did not have fresh rosemary, so I used dried. I also do not have skewers, so I did not cut up the chicken breast.  Instead I used a meat tenderizer to pound out whole breasts and then cut them in half.  I  marinated the chicken for about 3 hrs and then cooked them in a frying pan with a little oil and butter.  The chicken was extremely tender and infused with flavor.  It was great served with some fresh veggies and pasta.   Also, adding a little reserved marinade (not used to marinate the chicken) and chicken stock to the pan drippings and allowing to reduce down a bit makes a great sauce for the chicken and pasta. YUM!

Tasty, easy, and I had all the ingredients in the house- it doesn't get any better than that. I served with rice, doubled the marinade and added onions, peppers, and mushrooms to the kabobs for a complete meal.

Great chicken recipe.  I was looking for something different to do to chicken and came across this recipe.  Followed others advise and kept some sauce for dipping, it was really good, but think it would have been better had I grilled chicken in the extra sauce in foil pan, THEN used it for dipping.  Used leftovers in salad next day for lunch w/ranch dressing, and it was great there too!

I have made this recipe several times and it seems to come out differently each time.  The first time I made it, it was absolutely delicious!  The second and third times it was just ok.  I followed the recipe all 3 times exactly as written so I am not sure why it came out differently.  It is very good but the olive oil flavor seems to overwhelm it a bit so I think next time I make it, I will decrease the amount of olive oil.  I forgot to note that I didn't have any fresh rosemary so I did leave that ingredient out as I don't care for the flavor of rosemary.  Overall it is still a very good recipe and I will make it again.

Outstanding taste!  I prepared the marinade without any added salt and the dressing and Worcestershire provided sufficient salt for our taste.  Marinated about 6 hours.  The rosemary flavor in the background was excellent.   We will definitely make this again.

I'm giving this recipe 4 stars because I think it is good, but not great. I couldn't quite put my finger on what the "off" taste was, but it was definitely very tender and moist.  I'm not a big fan of rosemary, so maybe that's why I didn't get as excited as some of the other readers.  Might give tarragon a try next time.

Really good! I liked them more than I thought I would, since I'm not real big on rosemary. It was great with the ranch dressing though :)

After seeing Cookin'Mama's review, I decided to try this for our Sunday dinner. I couldn't find our skewers, so we had grilled chicken instead of kabobs. I used 1/3 cup oil and a little more Ranch dressing, only 1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce, 1 teaspoon of salt, and cider vinegar instead of white, and we marinaded the chicken for about 6 hours. It was perfectly seasoned, tender, juicy, slightly caramelized edges, and a nice hint of rosemary--delicious!

The marinade for this tasted out of this world. I wasn't overly impressed after the skewers were done, the flavor just didn't seem to be there any longer, just average tasting for me. I may try them again.

Okay my friends, I must have done something way wrong.  I used lime rather than lemon, white wine vinegar and baked rather than grilled (as many others did all three of these).  The results were a bland, very bland sauce over chicken.  :(

this is yummy! i heated up the extra marinade and added a tablespoon of butter , a few splashes of milk, and about 1/4 cup of sour cream to it without boiling to make a quick sauce to go over rice.

This chicken turned out very tender and moist, I did use cutlets instead of making kabobs. I followed the recipe to letter otherwise, but marinated for a couple hours. We grilled these and I think next time I will cut back on the Worcestershire sauce, maybe half. To me it seemed to overpower the other flavors in this dish. I will try this again though for sure, thanks for sharing!

This was delicious and these are ingredients I'll always have on hand! I threaded the skewers with the vegetables and marinated chicken; I just brushed marinade over the veggies while it was cooking. My only tip is definitely use fresh rosemary - I didn't have any and had to use dried, which gave the sauce a strange texture after cooking.

This is a really great recipe. saw that a lot of people found it too salty so i only used half the salt and pepper that is called for... seemed perfect. Used dried rosemary... i'll def use fresh next time... I am sure it would be incredible.

I made this with chicken breast instead of doing the kabobs and they were a BIG hit; absolutely fantastic. My sister and my husband are 2 of the families picky eaters and they both loved them, as well as the rest of the family. These will be a regular for us :) Thanks for a great recipe!

Wow, these were delicious! I, also put onions and mushrooms on the kabobs. I did not add any salt. I think the marinade would be a good veggie dip, too. Unfortunately, they were just ok as leftovers. Next time, I'll make them when my husband is home and there won't be any leftovers!

UPDATE: The first time I made this I was underwhelmed and couldn't believe all of the great reviews.  However, I made it again yesterday and WOW... they were tender and delicious.  We threaded red onion, mushroom, red and yellow bell pepper and a cheery tomato between the chicken pieces and it was restaurant quality.  Glad I tried it again..went from 3 stars the first time I tried it to 5 stars! Served with saffron rice and grilled pineapple.
1st review:
These were very tender.  They did not wow me, but they were okay.  I served with veggies marinaded in my homemade Italian dressing, then grilled, grilled pineapple with cinnamon, cayenne and brown sugar and a simple steamed broccoli with garlic and lemon butter. A nice supper.

As written, this recipe was too salty for our tastes. Second time around I left out the salt and used a fantastic homemade Ranch dressing I found on this website (Ranch Dressing II by Dawnia). Also, I decreased the Worcestershire to 1T. and added 2 cloves of minced garlic. The end result was fantastic... I know I'll be grilling this often over the summer!

Very tasty!  Easier to saute in pieces before skewering them.  The marinade was awesome, but needed sugar.

Fantastic flavor. It doesn't over power the chicken and gives the chicken a "lil' pop" to it. I marinated it for about 3 hours. Also I didn't have rosemary so I just replaced it with sweet leaf basil.  Very pleased with it all around.

I thought it was a tiny bit bland the first time I made it. I added about 1/4 teaspoon of smoked chipotle pepper seasoning and a pinch of thyme the next time around and marinated it for three hours and it was much improved. It was incredibly tender both times.

Excellent! So flavorful and moist. Very easy to put together, I accidentally left out the oil and I don't think it comprimised the taste at all. I cooked it on the top rack of my grill in a foil lined grill basket, as suggested by another reviewer. I am so happy to have a good NEW way to fix chicken, just in time for summer.

Very good. It was a good blend of flavored.  I would use fresh rosemary which everyone recommended. I may reduce the olive oil next time. I also omitted the salt and 1/2 the sugar.

Seriously the best chicken I have ever eaten in my entire life. I made this for mothers day on the grill. I let it marinate for four hours. My Dad looked at me and said I hope maybe someday your mom can cook like this!! It was that good!!

I prepared this recipe on Monday morning - planning on grilling the chicken  that evening (didn't "kabob" it - left the boneless chicken breasts whole).  My son's baseball game ran late, so we ended up having take-out instead.  The following day I figured I'd try grilling it - hoping that the chicken wouldn't be too "seasoned".  It was, by far, the tastiest, moistest chicken I've ever grilled.  Will make this again and again and again.....

Very good marinade.  I didn't grill these, but instead cooked them in a large nonstick pan over medium high heat, and skewered them after cooking so we could still enjoy the kabob effect.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

Really good.  I made the recipe as is, except used less oil and dried rosemary.  Served it with rice.  Yummy.
(This recipe is also great cooked in the oven (with all marinade) at 350 for 30 minutes.)

We love this recipe. I've made it several times since finding it. I like to add veggies (grape tomatoes, green pepper chunks, mushrooms) to the kabobs. I only use about 1/2 the oil called for and don't miss the rest. Awesome flavor. Thanks :)

Turns out I didn't have ranch dressing but my Greek dressing was fine.  I marinated it 8-5. Also cooked onions, tomatoes and peppers and served with couscous. One lb. of chicken cubes was enough for 2 of us. It was really juicy and next time I hope we have Ranch dressing in fridge!

I was looking for something quick & easy to make with what I had on hand & this was a great find!  I had just picked the only Meyer lemon that was on my bush & I always grow rosemary + I added a thickly sliced Vidalia onioin & put everything in a casserole after 1/2 hour including the extra marinade and man, was it ever good!  I served it over rice & there wasn't a scrap left ~ the boyfriend LOVED it too!  The review that said the extra marinade was great over rice wasn't kidding...  Do yourself a favor, don't throw it out!  This is a keeper!

Great flavor, i agree that the marinade seemed a bit salty but the meat didn't seem to be.  I added mushrooms and grape tomatoes to the veges.  My skewers went missing so I ended up making foil packets on the grill instead.  Turned out fantastic anyway.

This was really quick to make. I made the marinade in the morning and just kept it in the fridge until dinner time. I used chopped up pieces of chicken thigh and cooked it inside on my grill pan without the skewers. The flavor was delicious!

Will not make this again..I wanted to like this because who doesn't like ranch dressing?!? But I think the worcestershire was too overpowering and there was too much oil. The combination smelled great but didn't translate into the meat. I may attempt a version of this plus and minus some ingredients.

This earned three stars for our family for a couple of reasons:
First, I had pretty high expectations. It has a pretty high rating and rave reviews and as long as I have been using this site I can't recall a time when a recipe has not lived up to reviews. We were expecting to be blown away and that did not happen.
I made this exactly as penned and the ranch flavor really didn't come through for us, I even doubled the marinade. The chicken was good, of course, but just OK. There is another grilled chicken marinade on here that we had made a couple of weeks ago and we really were blown away so, that was hard to ignore. 
Besides the ranch flavor, the rosemary didn't show up either. I grow my own rosemary and was expecting that freshness to come out and it just didn't. I love trying new things, but won't waste my time on this one again, sorry!

I made the marinade and used it on boneless skinless chicken thighs. It was delicious and leftovers tasted better the second and third day. l will be sure to use this on the grill this spring and summer. Thank you for the wonderful recipe!

Unbelievable!!  This is the best chicken I have ever eaten. I marinate then bake mine in the oven on 350 degrees for 40 minutes.  The leftover sauce is crazy good on brown rice.

Will make again I didn't make any changes but dare to say it would be fine even without rosemary.  I marinated this for about 2 hours just because of the timing of my day, then went to grill and we were out of propane so tossed it in the oven with my sides 450 degrees for @ 15 min and came out very moist and tender  My husband and 18 month old son LOVED IT!!!!!  its not often my husband gets excited about my cooking so that says something

SO GOOD!!! Everyone in my family loved these and we have a variety of tastes. None of the specific ingredients are overpowering but all blend beautifully for a flavorful, savory taste. Also, the chicken is ridiculously moist given that it has no skins to keep the moisture in and is cooked over a dry heat. I do have one suggestion for anyone giving this a try for the first time: Reduce the amount of chicken or increase all the other ingredients. You don't want to be stretching too little marinade for too much chicken. (Four breasts would be perfect.)

What a simple recipe with great flavor! I almost follow this recipe to a "t". What I've changed is eliminated salt completely and instead of making kabob, I cooked the cubed chicken in the oven at 375ºF, covered with foil, for 20 minutes and then remove foil and cooked for an additional 10 to 15 minutes. I served with basmati rice and vegetables. Another thing I did differently is I marinated the cubed chicken for 2 hours before cooking. If you want to use an amazing Homemade Ranch Dressing, check out Chef John's (foodwishes.com). I'll bet you'll never buy it from the grocery store again.

By far the best chicken I've EVER made. I was a little thrown off by some of the ingredients (I thought it might have a funky taste). I used only a smidgen less of the olive oil and a little less than 1 teaspoon of salt because I was putting it over buttered white rice. It was spectacular. Give it a try, I can't imagine if I had skipped over this recipe. I'm looking forward to impressing everyone by making it for our next family gathering.

This recipe is so very delicious! I've made this several times, but only once grilling the chicken as kabobs. I grilled whole chicken breasts after putting them in this marinade, but you don't get much of the marinade's flavor. I also baked whole chicken breasts after marinating them and still almost no flavor. Grilling them as kabobs is definitely the way to go - trust me! They are full of flavor and they are so juicy! If it matters to anyone, we used a charcoal grill. I only had dried rosemary leaves, so I used that instead of fresh, using the correct fresh-to-dried ratio. I also doubled the marinade and used an entire pkg of chicken, which contained six chicken breasts. After grilling all of the chicken, there was enough marinade left over to use on two frozen chicken breasts we had (which we immediately put in the marinade), but we could have put a total of five or six breasts in the left over marinade. My husband and I made the kabobs for dinner with my parents and we all loved them. Please grill - you will not be disappointed!

This was one of the best recipes we have tried on here.   I made it exactly as the recipe stated and it was superb.   Flavor really held for only marinating 30 minutes.

I didn't care for this.  I will state that the chicken was moist but I thought the basil and ranch flavors was way to strong.  I served it with mushrooms, onions, and potatoes and rice with the sauce over it.

This recipe was delicious, I did change a few things such as instead of sugar I used 2T. Honey and added some chopped Garlic for extra flavor. I also didn't add any salt like the recipe called for. I marinated the chicken breast for one night and cooked them with veggies on skewers, and I loved it! So tender, juicy and flavorful. Will make again :)

I hate to rate a recipe when I change things. I have to tell you how I cooked it. I didn't grill it because I didn't have time. I didn't change any ingredients. The marinade is AWESOME! I cooked it in a skillet. I made gravy out of the marinade (I always make homemade gravy). I served it over rice. I would give this 10 stars if I could.

I baked the chicken in this sauce and it turned out beautifully. I didn't have lemon juice to use, but I used lemon pepper instead and it did the trick!

Loved it--used it to marinade chicken breasts for several hours in the fridge. Next time I would leave out the salt and add more rosemary. Yummy though!!!

I also cooked this in the oven with additional sauce and served it over a rice blend. It was delicious. I could envision using pheasant instead of chicken with similar results.

Made it on my new green egg.  I know nothing about grilling. This is the 3rd thing I've made on a grill and it's incredible.   The whole picky family loved it!   I only marinated for 45 minutes and it was amazing.

This is now our favorite chicken marinade recipe in our house. It is simple and quick and produces a chicken that is both moist and flavorful.. Followed the recipe almost exactly.. I just don't add the vinegar but add a few extra squeezes of the fresh lemon. Definitely a keeper ,

AWESOME!!!!These will definitely be added to the rotation. Served with white rice. Wanted to use a full tablespoon of rosemary but our plant is pretty new and was afraid to take ALL the leaves off, lol. Quick meal for a weeknight.

So good and easy to make, exactly as written!  Just don't forget to soak your wooden skewers in water beforehand so they don't catch on fire on the grill.

Flavor AMAZING! This is my GO TO chicken marinade now. So satisfying. Really, really good. I made it slightly differently using coconut aminos for worsteshire sauce (Gluten/soy-free). My husband and I don't like things with sugar, so we omitted that as well. Still just wonderful. I should add that I made the ranch dressing from scratch (homemade mayo, garlic, paprika, fresh parsley, chives, lemon juice, S/P) so I can't speak to the flavor from store-bought ranch.

Awesome! As suggested by another reviewer, I dumped all the marinade and chicken pieces in a glass dish, covered it with aluminum and baked on 450 for 20 minutes, then served it over rice with the juice. It came out perfect and was easier than dealing with the grill. I love good sauces and this was really tasty. The kids liked it too!

Chicken Breast Sandwiches: Grill full chicken breasts coated in the sauce, then top with extra sauce before placing on toasted buns with lettuce, tomato (1/4" - 1/2" slices), pickled jalapeno (pickles work just fine too), and red onions (white is fine too).

I add mayo, my wife adds nothing for condiments. 

Thanks to the OP for the sauce!

SO amazing. I made as is, except my fresh rosemary was frozen. And I also marinated them for 5 hours (made at lunch and grilled at supper when I got home). My boyfriend loved them and went for seconds! (He is very picky).

I have to admit that I was skeptical, especially after I made up the marinade.  My husband BBQd the chicken and it was fabulous.  I did not make it as kabobs, just boneless, skinless chicken breasts.  It was wonderful.

It's pretty good.  I was afraid it would be too much Ranch flavor, but it was really more of a rosemary flavored chicken.  I used half of the olive oil and generic low-fat Ranch dressing, and no salt.  I baked it at 400 degrees for 20 minutes.  It was very tender.  I'd give it 4 1/2 stars.

My husband said it was the best chicken I had ever cooked.  This is HUGE bc my husband is a MEAT(as in beef) and potatoes man.  I am always looking for great chicken recipes since chicken is more budget friendly and we have a large family. I did not have the rosemary so I used Italian seasoning.  I also marinated it for at least an hour, reserving some of the mixture so I could baste the chicken as it grilled and another reserve to dip fries in.  I used foil on the grill so the chicken would not dry out.  I removed the foil just before done and placed the chicken skewers directly on the grill and basted it.  It really was juicy and flavorful.  This was a last minute meal idea so I didn't have any of the onions or peppers I would want on my grilled food, next time I will definitely add bc the sauce is so good I want to put it on everything!

I have 3 children, and they simply cannot wait for these kabobs to be cooked and on their plate. Add some caramelized pineapple rings and potato salad, and my kids are in heaven. 
I have read reviews saying that the cook enjoys the marinade sauce sooo much, they just can't bear to throw it away. I understand this because at times you feel like you are throwing away the tastiest part. However, by using the marinade, you run a high risk of getting salmonella poisoning. Raw chicken is usually covered with salmonella bacteria; most people just call it food poisoning. But, no worries, this tasty dish is easily saved. After you have marinated you chicken, take it out of the sauce, and throw that germ riddled sauce AwAy. I can hear the gasps from here. It's ok, all you have to do is make more of the marinade/sauce that you made to put the chicken; but this time, don't put chicken in. Make a single, or a double amount of sauce (Ive read that some people are making double batches to use as sauce anyway). Make as much sauce as you want, and you and my family might fill the world with "yum"s!
Another quick tip: if you are using wood or bamboo kabob sticks, you can keep them from burning on the grill by first soaking the completely underwater for an hour before you thread the chicken on them. This way you can cook your chicken all the way through so that no pink shows on the inside, without worrying if your kabob stick will burn up before the chicken is finished.

Absolutely delicious, I'v made the recipe several times now! I also have just made it without using the kabobs. Served it with jasmine rice and a green vegetable. this recipe is definitely a keeper. My husband and 2 boys don't really like chicken too much but loved this recipe.

Instead of grilling the kebobs, I put them in the oven, about 30 mins at 425F. They came out perfectly, moist and tender and the taste was amazing!! I was a bit careful with the Worcestershiresauce and only used half of what the recipe called for but I might use the full amount next time. I also had only dried Rosemary on hand but it was still fantastic. 5 stars hands down! Even my picky 5 year old liked it!

These kabobs are devine!! I found this recipe and made them for my boyfriend, them I made them for my parents when they cam over and everyone loved them! The marinade isn't overpowered with rosemary and you don't have to keep them in it too long which is fabulous. I made it with roasted red potatoes and garlic green beans. Definitely going to be a staple!

I've been making this recipe for a few years and just made it again last night for a potluck. Every time I make it I get rave reviews. For our tastes, we don't add the sugar or salt but pretty much do everything else as listed. (We grow rosemary in our yard so it's always fresh and handy.) For the ranch dressing, we use Hidden Valley Ranch from the packet made with BUTTERMILK. Light years better than any bottled ranch dressing. I swear it makes a huge difference. Also, grilling is the only way to go for the right flavor. And if you want to make it easier, skip cubing & skewering the chicken. We just throw chicken tenderloins in a bag with the marinade, let it sit for a couple of hours, then throw on the grill. Just as tender and flavorful. Thanks for the recipe!

I made this recipe for dinner tonight. My 9 year old daughter was crazy about it!!! She isn't always easy to please, but I wouldn't call her a classic picky eater. She likes flavor and I suspect she is on her way to being a great cook. There wasn't a bit left on her plate. We are in a rental house during our remodel, and don't have a grill. I cut the breasts into 3 strips each, skewered them, baked for 10 minutes in the marinade, tossed the marinade, put foil on a cookie sheet, then under the broiler for 10. Perfect! I did marinade longer than 30 minutes (more like 2 hours). I would definitely increase the marinade time. Nice, simple week night main dish.

Amazing - flavourful and moist!  We didn't make this into kabobs; rather, marinated whole chicken breasts for 2-3 hours in the marinade and grilled the chicken breasts whole.  So fabulous.  I did cut back on the olive oil per other reviewers suggestions but kept everything else the same.  It makes a lot of marinade, so you could do a few more chicken breasts than the recipe calls for--just make sure you coat well and recoat once or twice during marinating period.  Will definitely make this again!!!!

This recipe was not as tasty as I was expecting, even after brushing some reserved marinade onto the kabobs during the latter stages of grilling. The chicken itself was moist and tasted OK, but I was expecting a bit more zing. Not sure if this is a comment on the recipe or my expectations, but it was certainly worth a try.

The recipe was fabulous....I used my indoor grill and this recipe was on the flavor train! Soo so good! My family totally enjoyed the flavor that this recipe had. The way I cubed my 5 huge chicken breasts, I made 18 skewers and they were completely gone at the end of the meal. Everyone said I out did myself and I didn't and won't change a thing with the recipe, at all. TY so much.

Very good recipe. Because I don't like the taste, I cut the Worcestershire to 1 tblsp., left out the salt because of the ranch and Worcestershire, increased the black pepper to 1/2 tsp. and decreased the sugar to 1 tsp. Next time I'm going to use whole boneless breasts. The chicken was very tender, moist and flavorful. Definitely worth trying if you like rosemary.

I used half the oil, roughly 1/3 the salt, and three quarters of the sugar; I also used three quarters the rosemary (1 tablespoon) because I only had dried on hand, but dried is more pungent anyway so it's probably approximately the same, flavor-wise, as if I'd used the listed amount of fresh. I marinated over night. It made a delicious marinade and juicy, tender chicken. It's also very easy to put together, relatively versatile (I've done it on the grill and under the broiler in the oven, and it was very good both ways), and quite budget-friendly. This will be a part of our regular rotation for sure, with my changes, and I think it might be my favorite chicken marinade ever. Even so, I wrestled with whether to give five stars or not, since the recipe as given has easily twice the necessary oil and three times the necessary salt, and as given would be virtually inedible to me. Even my salt-and-fat-loving husband said that it had tons of flavor with the ingredients reduced. Anyway, the core recipe is awesome, but be sure to tweak quantities as your tastes and dietary needs require, and definitely marinate at least overnight to make the flavors really come together.

I made the recipe exactly as written but added no salt and baked at 350* for about 30 minutes.  It was excellent.  I roasted Mushrooms, onions, potatoes, grape tomatoes and red peppers all cut into bite size pieces separately at 475* for about 35 to 40 min.  Served with the chicken. Was such an easy dinner to make.  The chicken breasts were as moist as can be. My hubby who normally puts ketchup on most things, did not on this.  I will be making this again.  It is definitely a keeper. Thank you Theresa

I followed the recipe exactly. This had a sweetness to it that I didn't like.  I would not recommend adding the sugar to this. We all tend to like stronger flavored items (peppercorn, garlic, etc.) and this was just not the type of flavor that we go for.  The kids ate it reluctantly.  We won't try this again.

I prefer this recipe with lamb although chicken is an okay substitute (for nearly anything). I also prefer to alternate the meat pieces with pieces of onion and/or green bell pepper.

Followed recipe almost to a tee. Would have omitted the salt, except that I used low sodium Worcestershire sauce. I probably put in 1.5 to 2 tablespoons of minced rosemary. Use a decent ranch dressing, not something cheap that tastes only of salt. Mine turned out awesome. Not a super strong taste, but had plenty of flavor for sure. TIP: Invest in a digital thermometer and pull the chicken off when it is 165 degrees in the center. If the chicken comes out dry it is not because of the marinade, it is because you overcooked it.  Dry chicken = flavorless chicken.

This really made a tender and flavorful chicken.  I had to make a few changes for convenience.  I used 5 chicken breasts halved.  I seasoned them and baked in the marinade at 375 for about 40 minutes.  I cut the olive oil to 1/4 cup, and probably could have used even less.  My picky 6 year old even asked for a second helping.

Delicious!! I marinaded the chicken for several hours and I didn't bother cutting it into chunks - just pounded the breasts to a uniform thickness. Also, have a water bottle handy when you put the chicken on the grill, it flames up immediately!

I would rate this more at a 3 1/2 star ,but giving it a 4 because my daughter loved it!! The rest of the family ended up dipping it in BBQ sauce. It was good, just not strong enough flavoring. Mrinated for 8 hours. Maybe next time I'll try marinating longer.

Fantastic!!! I used 1/4c olive oil and kept all other ingredients the same. Loved the smell of this creamy marinade. I also used a light ranch dressing (Hidden Valley). Used about 7 chicken breasts that I cut into chunks and marinated overnight. I think the fresh rosemary is key....smell was amazing and chicken moist off the grill. Thanks!

I love this recipe! Made it tonight and marinated red onion and fresh mushrooms with the chicken for a little over an hour.  I also threaded thick cut bacon on the skewers with the onion and chicken.  The mushrooms I grill on tin foil until they get tender.  So so good!  Goes really well with fresh grilled asparagus!

A little on the sour side. Maybe it was my Ranch Dressing.

These are yummy! My only change was to reduce the olive oil  by half...I serve these on a bed of greens, tomatoes, cucumbers, shredded lettuce, purple onion, very healthy! and filling. I had a couple kabobs leftover so the next day i shredded them and mix them with a little Frank's hot sauce stuffed them in a pita with some shreeded lettuce tomato and some ranch dressing, awesome too! Thanks sumitter for a fantastic recipe! Elvira Silva.

Quite tasty. I did marinate for 8 hours. Next time I would like to decrease the salt by half. Served with Asparagus Cashew Rice Pilaf and grilled mixed veggies.

Used a suggestion from another reviewer.  They suggested putting the chicken and the marinade in a vegetable grilling wok lined with aluminum foil.  The chicken was flavorful and tender.  Everyone loved it.

Made marinade exactly as written, though I used whole skinless boneless chicken breasts instead of chunks. The chicken was flavorful and juicy. Thank you for a great recipe!

I wasn't sure about this because I'm not a fan of ranch dressing, but wanted to try something different for chicken kabobs.  Wow!  This was great and so easy!  The only change I made was dried rosemary (didn't have fresh) and fresh lemon (that I did have).  I had too many green & red bell peppers so i put them on the skewers too.  Excellent!  Will make this again (probably tomorrow!)

I LOVE this ranch dressing mixture! I now use buttermilk ranch dip and apple cider vinegar instead of white...turns out PERFECT! I have used this dip for kabobs, grilled chicken breasts and made a batch just to dip the cooked chicken in! YUM!

I cubed the chicken and then baked them in a 9x13 because I don't have a grill and I was out of lemon juice so I left that out, I used buttermilk ranch and apple cider vinegar, it was soooo good!  I can only imagine how amazing it would be on the grill. I also add some julienne bell peppers.Thanks so much for this recipe!

Tasty and easy. Used whole breasts instead of cutting them up because I am lazy like that. Did 1 tsp salt and skipped the sugar - mostly because I forgot. The 5 & 2 yr olds both gobbled it up!

These were very, very good.  I gave 4 stars instead of 5 because we found the rosemary a bit overpowering. Next time I'll reduce that a little.  And since it's December in New England, instead of grilling, I baked these in the oven since others had had success with that.  It worked out fine.  I used chicken tenders which also worked out great and baked for about 18 minutes at 350 degrees.  I would use those again if making kabobs and just thread them onto the skewers.  I hate cutting up chicken!!

These were amazing!! We ate it with a salad and pita bread/hummus.  I made a couple of changes just because I didn't have some of the ingredients...I used soy sauce instead of Worcestershire, Balsalmic vinegar instead of white vinegar, and a greek feta dressing instead of ranch, and dried rosemary instead of fresh.  We also cooked it on our Foreman grill.  I am sure the regular recipe is equally amazing, my only recommendation is to keep some of the sauce before mixing in the chicken...it would be great to top the chicken with some of that after cooking it.

Best marinade EVER! So moist and so much flavor. One of the few that doesn't need to be doubled. I also slice and bake red potatoes drizzled in olive oil, salt and chopped rosemary to use up the extra.

Fantastic!  I actually followed this recipe to a T and they were wonderful.  They could have used just a little something, although I'm still not sure what that is...maybe some garlic?  I grilled these and served them with Ranch dressing and they were great!

What a hit! We've made this several times following the recipe pretty much as stated. We have a huge rosemary bush in our yard and the only thing we changed is using the woody little branches as the skewers. Infuses even more rosemary flavor. Delicious and tender.

This was DELISH!  I made it pretty much according to the original recipe although I didn't have enough worcestershire sauce and like others I reduced the amount of salt.  I marinated mine on the skewers with red peppers, mushrooms, and chopped onions for about 4 hours. Will definitely make it again.... maybe add a little garlic next time?

I liked this recipe! Very easy to prepare. As suggested in other reviews I omitted the salt and added more rosemary. Perfect ( : I didn't cook all of it and the next day I lined a baking sheet w/parchment paper and just baked it 350 for 15 min. as another person had suggested. Very good too!

these were phenomenal!  I made them for Fathers Day and they were gone before you knew it!  The chicken was nice a moist and tender.  We will definitely make these again.  The only thing I did different was to use dried rosemary instead of fresh, and marinated the chicken for at least 2 hours before grilling.  Delicious!

These had an odd, unpleasant flavor for us and weren't tender at all. I must have done something wrong- with all the 5 star reviews- but followed the recipe to the best of my knowledge.

This was AMAZING.  Fresh rosemary is a must, and I have made it with bottled and homemade ranch--both ways were terrific and oh-so tender.  I have a very picky 3 yr old, so I just had to remove any visible rosemary from his kabob :)
Thanks for sharing!

Delicious! I omitted the salt as recommended by others. I also added zucchini, vidalla onions & mushrooms to the skewers. I marinated everything for about 2 hours & reserved about half of the marinade to baste with as I was grilling. I can't wait to make this again!!!!

Made this one twice in the last two weeks for BBQs and both times, they turned out perfectly. Got lots of compliments. I cut the oil in half and it was still very moist and tender.

These were pretty good. I cut the olive oil and salt in half and added 6 cloves of chopped garlic. Next time I will leave the sugar out.

We tried this recipe over the weekend we weren't so impressed. The chicken was dry and we marinated it for well over the time others said they did before cooking. Maybe it was the high heat of the grill we used but overall they came of the grill dry and even though we served them with a ranch dip they never really softened up. The flavor was just okay...we love ranch and we love rosemary but somehow they just didn't blend in this recipe for us.

The chicken was awesome! I added mushrooms, onions and pepers to the kabobs and the chicken even flavored the veggies.  We will definitely be adding this to our favorite meal list!

This marinade was awesome. I first tried it with boneless pork chops, marinated them and cooked them whole on the grill. I tasted the marinade but it wasn't enough for me. The second time I made them with boneless chicken breasts and cooked them on the grill. This time I just cooked the chicken whole and then tossed and basted them really good in the marinade- AWESOME. They came out so tender, juicy and full of flavor.

great recipe - followed another's suggestion and cubed 1 red and 1 green bell pepper, along with 1/2 a vidalia onion and marinated it with the chicken.  i also used the low fat hidden valley ranch dressing and i don't think it compromised the flavor at all!

Wow.  These are delicious.  You really don't taste the ranch flavor (which is fine) but they are so tasty.  Fresh rosemary is key.  Warning: the marinade looks and smells so foul I almost threw these away before grilling.  AND my husband is not very good with the grill. Still, these were delicious after cooking and looked exactly like photo.  I followed other reviewers' tips (thanks guys!) and used 1/3 c. oil instead of 1/2 c.  My picky 11 year old who is not a big fan or chicken or ranch dressing said, "mom, these are pretty good!" and finished his plate.  Will make again!  Served with rice pilaf and grilled peaches. (Update: I have also made these replacing the ranch dressing - most are full of chemicals - with plain greek yogurt and they are just as delicious!).

I also added some summer squash and zucchini to the marinade and grilled them on seperate skewers. The vegetables were amazing. Red peppers would be good too. The chicken was also very nice but a little light on flavor for me. I used Maries Light Ranch (which is light on fat but big on flavor) Im  a huge fan of ranch dressing, so Im thinking that next time I will regularly brush the chicken with the marinade (there was plenty) during cooking to boost up the flavor. I ended up drizzling some extra ranch dressing over the chicken to boost up the flavor afterwards, but of course that lacked the extra flavor of the rosemary and worsestershire in the marinade. I thought about cooking it in a foil lined basket with the marinade like one of the other reviewers. This would give additional flavor, but I do like the slight charring that you get from direct-grilling. I used the left over warmed chicken and squash in sandwiches with ranch dressing the next day - and they were to die for! All in all a great simple tasty recipe.

Very good. Like another reviewer, we'd cut olive oil in half. Grilled directly and it turned out flavorful enough in combination with some of the sauce, which we cooked separately on the stove.

Absolutely delicious.  I have never tweaked this recipe and the chicken comes out moist and perfect every time.  I've made it about once per week since discovering it.  Love, love, LOVE the rosemary flavor.  Use plenty of it!

I WISH I could give this more stars!  I enjoyed this more than any other savory dish I have tried off of this site.  My husband said, "If candy were juicy, salty, and full of tangy flavors, this would be candy!"  I followed the recipe exactly and I only grilled them 8 or 9 minutes...longer probably would have dried them out, but my grill was pretty hot.  Can't wait to try this on veggies, too!

SOOO Delish!!! I made extra sauce (w/a little more ranch dressing added) for dipping & my husband said "this is the bomb!" I added 1 lg. clove of minced garlic to the marinade, used dried rosemary which I crushed & marinated for 2+ hrs in a ziploc bag, other than that I followed the recipe. I also marinated veggies in a seperate bag. This is truly scrumptious!!! Thank you for such a wonderful recipe!

Yum!!!!!  Just like most reviewers said this is a great marinade.  I used Hidden Valley lite ranch and fresh rosemary is a must.  Next time I will omit the salt and halve the olive oil.  Marinating for 30 minutes yields very moist, tender and flavorful chicken.  Thank you!

We made this amazing little dish over the weekend. I knew this was going to be a hit after reading all the reviews but WOW. DH said this is hands down the best chicken he's ever eaten and asked me to make it again sometime this week. I made it with zuchinni patties from this site and mushroom rice and it was an amazing meal. The marinade is to die for. Thank you so much for this excellent recipe!

Wow, sooooo delicious! I marinated these for a little bit over a day and the chicken was so juicy. I tried to make these a little healthier by decreasing the OO (1 tbsp total), omiting the salt and sugar ( preference on the sugar) and making my own ranch dressing using non-fat plain yogart. Thanks for the recipe, we will be using this often now that we can grill again:)

Excellent!  Even my son who does not really like chicken - loved it!  The only adjustment I made was cut back half on the olive oil.  Served with black beans and rice and asparagus - delish!!!

Very simple and very tasty. This turned out very very tender and moist meat with a great flavor. I used buttermilk Ranch dressing, dried rosemary, and chicken tenders and didn't cut them into chunks or skewer them. I did cut the salt in half though as usual. Thanks Theresa this was fantastic!

We LOVE it! it's one of the 1st dishes I have ever heard my 4 yr old, extremely picky eater, ask for more meat. We think it tasted fine without the sugar, couldn't tell the difference we made it both ways. We even used a light ranch and dried rosemary since we couldn't get any fresh. TY Theresa!

Oh wow!  What a hit.  This marinade is delicious.  I made the marinade last night. I clipped  3, 4" sprigs of rosemary and soaked them in the marinade overnight since I don't like pieces of rosemary.  I took advantage of "more pepper to taste" and added a fresh clove minced garlic.  I marinated the chicken for about 3 hours before grilling.  I will definately make these again and again.

These are fabulous!!  I don't bother with cutting up the chicken and threading it on skewers and I hold back some of the sauce for drizzling/dipping the finished product.  I just marinate and grill.  Fantastic flavor from an unusual mix of ingredients.

We must be crazy, because we did not like this at all. My husband didn't even finish a single serving. I'm shocked because I was sure we would love it. I thought it was too tangy and tasted mustard like. He didn't say what it was like, but made it clear he didn't care for it.

Great recipe.  I needed something at the last minute that used what little ingredients I had in the fridge and so I didn't even read the reviews before making this.  My husband declared it the best chicken he'd ever had.  I did leave out the salt (figured 3T of Worcestershire was enough) and used it marinate thinly sliced (to speed up the grilling) chicken breasts.  Tender and tasty without being overwhelming.  Next time I will try it with much less olive oil to see if it still turns out.

Very good and flavorful!  I would not add any salt though; 2 teaspoons would have killed this for me!  (And it's just bad for you).  I actually left out 1 TBS of W. sauce because it's so salty, and added none of the salt.  This was perfect!

This was outstanding! The grill gave the chicken a nice crispy exterior, while being flavorful and juicy inside. I used Litehouse dressing because it doesn't have MSG like most ranch dressings do. Even my 2 year old, who despises white meat chicken, ate a whole kebab. And the best part? It took no time to get this together. We will DEFINITELY be making this again!

These are OUT OF THIS WORLD!!! I used whole rosemary springs instead of the minced and used boneless, skinless chicken thighs. Definitely mix some marinade with extra ranch for dipping...sooooo good! Chicken was juicy and tender! Great recipe!!!

Very tasty!  I made extra marinade & drizzled a small amount of brown rice before serving with the kabobs on top.  Delicious!  On the kabobs, I used green peppers, onions & chicken.

This was the first recipe I tried from Allrecipes. It was so good I became a Supporting Member. My kids and every family we have ever prepared it for rave about it. I have made these kabobs about 30 times since 2007. Shrimp is great prepared this way, too. We usually serve it with rice and grilled veggies.

Wow, what a delicious marinade. I can't believe I waited this long to try it.  The chicken was moist and the blend of flavors was perfect.  I didn't bother to cube the chicken, but instead just marinated the chicken breasts whole and then grilled them.  I served it with a mock risotto and corn on the cob.  My little guy cleaned his plate.  This will definitely be on my menu quite often this summer.

Another rave review. I did bake them in the oven at 375 for 20 min. on skewers positioned on 9X13 baking pan. Very moist and great. DH loved.

Fantastic!  Even my 8 yr old triplets ate it.  I didn't do kabobs but marinated the chicken breasts for a few hours and then grilled.

I served these at a party, and while I thought they were pretty good, a few others absolutely LOVED them (even one picky eater just kept going back for more). I followed one reviewer's advice and cooked them in the oven with all the marinade, since I don't have a grill. Overall, very good.

I made up my kabobs early in the day and marinated them all day. Used chicken,mushrooms,onion,green pepper and grape tomatoes and grilled them on a grill tray I use for fish.  I boiled leftover marinade and used for a dipping sauce.  We really liked it and something a little different to serve company. I served with southwestern rice & breadsticks.

Excellent. I'll definitely put this into my summer "go to" rotation. Made exactly as written, and it was absolutely perfect. The sauce is to die for when the extra is heated up and drizzled over the kabobs before serving. This recipe is company-worthy, classy yet casual in its presentation, and most important of all -- super tasty!!  Thanks so much for sharing.

After reading so many positive reviews, I was disappointed with the results of this recipe.  I followed the recipe as given with the one exception of adding chopped garlic that was recommended by another reviewer.  I found the flavor of the sauce to be too strong for the chicken.

I've made this twice lately and it was enjoyed by all, even the little ones.  I omitted the salt and it wasn't missed and I like my salt.  I used chicken tenders instead of cubing the chicken.  I threaded the tenders onto the kebabs kind of like ribbon-candy.  Works great and cuts out some prep time. I used fresh rosemary but really didn't taste it so I think that I will add more next time.  For everyone concerned about the sodium, remember that the nutrition information is for the chicken and the marinade, when in fact most of the marinade is discarded so one is not getting near as much sodium as it appears.

Very good.  The second time I used buttermilk in place of ranch dressing, increased the lemon juice, vinegar and sugar.  It's a keeper!

These were outstanding. I've made them twice now - once with the salt and once without. I'll include the salt for now on, I thought they were a little bland otherwise.

I omitted the salt and sugar entirely and used fat free ranch. The kabobs were a bit on the bland side for me, but my husband enjoyed them.

I thought this was one of the best chicken recipes ever.  I didn't use quite as much Worcestershire and thought it was fantastic without it.  I marinated it for about 4 hours but next time I'll do it overnight.  I set some of the marinade aside for dipping and basted the chicken with some of it as well.  It was really moist and flavorful and I'll be making this again soon.

These kabobs turned out great! They were very moist and tasty. To be honest, I didn't really taste the ranch dressing. Wasn't sure if it was a necessary ingredient.

I do so many different things with chicken, and I will say this was probably the most deliscious marinade yet.  I would recommend to marinate it overnight for more flavor, I did try it two different ways both marinating for a short and long period of time, and the flavor of marinating it over night was so much more powerful!  Loved this I recommend to try it, def my new favorite!!

This chicken was delicious!  I didn't have any ranch dressing so I substituted a creamy parmesan peppercorn dressing instead.  I used only a few shakes of Himalayan salt and omitted the sugar.  I will definitely be using this marinade throughout the summer!  Thank you Theresa for a great recipe!

Terrific recipe - my fussy and critical family members loved it too!  Used approx 2 lbs. boneless/skinless chicken breasts - cut in half (to make big kabobs);substituted 1 tsp dried Italian seasoning for Rosemary; substituted 1 tsp white wine vinegar for vinegar; omitted salt/sugar; marinated 1 hr.  Will definitely be making again - yummy!

My family and I really liked this recipe. I have to give it 4 stars because I made some changes that I thought made it better. I cut the olive oil and salt measurements in half, used rice vinegar instead of white, omitted the sugar, and used boneless chicken thighs instead of breasts. I grilled the kabobs on my stovetop grill. Honestly, when I was making the marinade and tasted it I thought it was kind of gross, but the end product was delicious. It will be a regular for us!

I had two large split boneless chicken breast that i needed to use up. I was looking for something that would be good to put on top of a salad for my husbands lunch. I seen this and gave it a try. OMG - moist, juicy, full of flavor. Very impressed. I would of never thought of this combination. My husband never eats anything with ranch, I had him try a peice before making his salad, he loved it. I followed the recipe, I did let it marinade for 3 hrs. and then grilled it. Thanks and nice job Theresa.

this is the best chicken marinade i have ever made.  it is simple, easy and delicious!  i've made this quite a few times, and each time people rave about it.   i marinate for at least 4 hours, and have always skewered the chicken for grilling.  don't substitute dried rosemary, the fresh rosemary is one of the best parts!

Very delicious, very moist just as others wrote.  But I gave 4 stars because the weight of the chicken is not written.  I had 3 breasts that were one pound and 2 teaspoons of salt would have ruined them. Luckily I knew this and adjusted it to one teaspoon and they were almost too salty however we like salty food so it was good eaten with rice. I also reduced the oil to 1/4 cup and used low fat ranch. I can't imagine grilled chicken without fresh garlic so I added 2 big cloves of minced garlic.  Lastly, I used about 1 teaspoon of dried rosemary and added a dash of oregano with it and left it in the marinade for a couple of hours.  30 minutes isn't long enough for flavors to blend. Didn't have the worcestershire sauce so I left it out.  I usually marinate chicken in yogurt so this was a good alternative to the same ol and I will make it again. Almost forgot, since I was cooking with rice and someone commented on how good the sauce was and suggested cooking it in the oven under the broiler with all the marinade, I gave it a try.  But all my marinade evaporated and when the chicken was done, I was only left with the 1/4 cup oil that I added to the marinade?? I got no sauce, but the chicken browned nicely as if it were grilled outdoors.

These were yummy. I let the chicken marinate for a couple of hours before baking in the oven. If you want to bake them, just be sure to soak the skewers in water for 24 hours before baking.

This chicken is SO delicious. It completely surpassed my expectations. I will definitely make this many more times. I did omit the sugar, since it says optional.

I made these for the first time for a BBQ on Labor Day weekend. They were a complete hit! The adults and the kids equally enjoyed them. Next time I might add a bit more ranch to them as I couldn't really taste it too much. They were great and I plan to make them again!

Very good.  I was looking for something that would use what I had on hand and this fit the bill.  I also basted veggies in some of the marinade I kept away from the chicken.  I found that the marinade simply brought out the flavors of the chicken and veggies instead of overpowering them.  Will certainly make again!

WOW! My husband said this was the best chicken he's ever eaten.  It was really good!  I didn't have any rosemary, so I used dried Basil instead, and I marinated it for probably 2-3 hours. It turned out awesome!  I will be making this again and again.  Next time I might marinate some mushrooms in this marinade and make some kabobs with peppers and onions!  YUM!

YUM!!! So flavorful. I only added a dash of salt and used about 1/4 cup oil - the ranch dressing and Worcestershire sauce give it enough kick. The chicken really does come out very tender, and the rosemary adds a depth of flavor. This is definitely a new favorite.

I used whole tenders rather than cutting up breasts.  Marinated about 6 hours.  These were easy, delicious, moist and looked beautiful on my pewter platter once grilled.  Used leftovers in a spinach salad with dark cherries and celery seed dressing the next day.  Very,very good recipe!

Good, but I confess I had higher expectations based on the reviews. Just and advice if you want to make this healthier, make sure you use an organic reduced fat ranch dressing this way you also avoid high fructose corn syrup.

The chicken was very moist and juicy for grilled chicken. My normal grilled chicken usually is dry.  This is great.  The flavor was good without being to over powering.  This has been added to my favorite recipes and we will make it again.

Wonderful!  I didn't make any changes, except for leaving out the salt.  Next time I think I will set aside some of the marinade and heat it up to use as a sauce to drizzle over the finished chicken!

I was so tired of the same old chicken. Someone suggested this on the recipe exchange this morning and this was really nice. I didn't have rosemary and my husband doesn't care for it, but I had fresh basil and parsley and that worked out nicely. The marinade kept the chicken nice and most.

I loved this recipe.  I also did as others recommended and had a second batch of marinade and put into a bag and put veggies into it.  When I was ready to cook I used my cast iron pan and dumped the veggies into it and placed on the grill over med low heat and cook them.  Then cooked the chicken next to the pan after about 10 of veggie cooking.  used the sauce from the pan to pour over rice and it was amazing.  I omitted the salt as well and it was well seasoned. Will be making for friends and family soon.  Loved this recipe.

WOW, I loved this dish!!  I did as the top reviewer did and baked it in the oven.  I did mine at 425 for about 25 min, but I could have pulled them out a few minutes earlier!  I skipped the salt and sugar, and decreased the olive oil to suit our families tastes.  This was very good and the sauce was great over basmati rice.  I will totally make this again!  It would be a very quick meal to throw together by preparing the marinade and chicken in the morning, and then just baking at dinner time.  Thanks for a great family recipe!!

I will definately be making these again. The only thing I would change is the amount of salt. Next time I will try half the salt called for. I also marinated the chicken overnight but I will try the 30 minutes recommened next time. Interesting mix of ingredients but it really is good.

It was very good!  I also marinate mushrooms, zucchini and bell pepper to go on the skewers.  Delicious with couscous.

I'd give this 4 1/2 stars if that was an option:  we cut the salt in half, and that was plenty.  I also took previous reviewer's advice and marinated some onion, peppers, and mushrooms with the chicken too.  Grilled these on separate skewers from the chicken (cooking time for veggies is different).  I cooked the left-over marinade in a saucepan until bubbly and served that over cooked brown rice on the side.

We loved this chicken!  I didn't have any skewers for kabobs, so I just used the whole boneless breasts.  I also did not have any fresh rosemary, so I used dried.  Delicious!

This is the best chicken marinade I've ever used--it has the perfect amount of tang and spice.  Only slight changes--I used 1/4 c. olive oil instead of 1/2, and added a little cayenne and red pepper flakes to give it an extra kick.  I baked it with the marinade included in the pan at 450 for 20 minutes as another reviewer suggested and the marinade was delicious as a sauce on rice. Thanks for the recipe!

Excellent summer chicken. My only suggestion would be to add more veggies on the skewers for flavor and texture variation. But this was a big hit across 3 generations at our house!

This is an awesome recipe! The first time I used this recipe, I tasted the marinade after adding all of the ingredients, and I was very skeptical! So I added more garlic (our family loves garlic!)!  The ingredients impart an incredible flavor---even without the extra garlic! Using this marinade, we've had chicken kabobs twice, and boneless chicken breast once, and have not been disappointed. As an additional note (because it annoys me to see this in other reviews), if you do not like one or more of the ingredients in this marinade, don't try it then punish the person who put it here for us to try by giving the recipe a low rating because you didn't like some of the ingredients!

I thought this was very good.  I pounded my chicken pretty thin and let it marinate overnight.  It broke down the meat quite a bit, and I was worried that I had let it marinate too long, but when i cooked it, it was perfect.  very tender and flavorful.  I had 5 guys over for dinner and they couldn't stop raving about it.

this was the best!! I was worried that it called for too much rosemary but it was great.  Cooked on low on the grill until grill marked and then moved to the top grill for remaining 10 minutes.  Nice and tender with fantastic flavor. Will make again and again.

Amazing recipe. Just made this for dinner and my husband and I absolutely love it. I left out the sugar, used 3 chicken breasts, sliced green bell pepper, and some onion wedges and marinated it all for over an hour. Then poured it all into a 9x13 dish and baked at 450 for 30 minutes. I'll definitely be making this again.

This was delicious.  The kids loved it.  I intended to grill, then it was storming, so I put the whole thing(marinade and all) in a 9 x 13 and baked it at 425 for 30 mins.  The chicken was moist and delicious, the marinade was excellent on rice.  Next time I will use less of the olive oil, because the sauce was plenty oily after cooking the chicken right in it.

I made these for my family last night and they were a big hit!  Very juicy, flavorful chicken.  It was too salty for us though, so I would cut the salt in half or entirely.  I used the extra marinade as dipping sauce and it was also excellent over jasmine rice.  
I craved this all day today and I'm making it again for dinner tonight.

Kind of surprised.  I only used two chiken breasts, but kept the marinade the same.  Turned out pretty well as I baked in all the marinade! I would suggest letting it sit in the marinade a little longer if you are going to grill it as the flavor of the marinade didn't seem set in the chicken.  If I make on grill, will more than likely set aside some sauce before marinating.

WOW...Excellent!!  Changes:  Marinated for several hours.  Only used 1/2t. salt, and 1/2T. sugar.  I think 2 T. of salt would make it way too salty (since there is already soy sauce & dressing).  Next time I'll omit the salt altogether.  Everyone...Adults & Kids loved this.   Served with jasmine rice and veggie Kabobs sprinkled lightly with olive oil and sea salt.

Absolutely wonderful!  My kids request this chicken all of the time.  My husband grills it and we slice it to use on our salad.  Very easy and lots of flavor.  We do cut the oil in half and use light Ranch to cut some of the fat and calories.

My husband usually likes my cooking pretty well, but this one made him exclaim that I MUST send the recipe to his mother so we could make it when visiting over Thanksgiving. His 8 year old niece immediately proclaimed it the BEST CHICKEN EVER. Instead of skewering the chicken, I just pounded the breasts thin and we grilled them that way. I've only had dried rosemary the times I've made it so far.. can't wait to try it with fresh!

Yummy, yummy, yummy!  I have been cold all day and refused to grill, so I just put this with all of the marinade in the oven and cooked it that way.  Some of the sauce separated, but it was still so delicious!  I marinated it for about 8 hours.  I always over-marinate.  I made rice and put some of the sauce over the rice.  Thanks for a great recipe!  I am trying hard not to go get more!

Oh my gosh ~ this was great! It was cold and rainy here last night so I decided to just saute this recipe on top of the stove and it was the best. My husband loved it as well. I followed the recipe exactly and just cut up the chicken in bite-sized pieces before marinating for about 3 hours.  I didn't even have to add any oil to the pan and covered it for the first 5 minutes of cooking or so. I will be making this one for company next time!

This was loved by everyone in my family of six, even earning me extra praise from my 5 yr. old: "Mom, you're best cook of all the food in the world!"  

I avoid additional sugar, so I left it out. I used Annie's Naturals ranch dressing since it is all-natural and low in sugar. I used both fresh rosemary and fresh thyme from my herb garden, and added a little extra lemon juice.  Some skewers were made with just the meat. For those of us who like veggies, I made shish kebab with the meat, red bell peppers, mushrooms, zucchini, and Walla Walla onion. Outstanding!

Absolutely delicious. I substituted more fresh-squeezed lemon juice for the vinegar and marinated the breasts whole. Rosemary must be freshly minced too. Amazingly simple and clean taste!

I've made this recipe at least 50 times and the only changes I have ever made is, I add vegetables to the skewers, like bell peppers, onions, mushrooms, etc,  I add them to the marinade and keep them chilled until I skewer them.
 For best results, put the skewers on a hot grill, turn down the heat and cook them slow - Never over cook the chicken!
 Serve the kabobs on some rice pilaf, or, even better, a lemon Dill rice!

PHENOMENAL!! I am super picky about chicken and this just became my favorite chicken I have ever eaten. I used about 4lbs of cubed chicken breasts and I let it marinade in the sauce mixture (I followed the exact recipe for the marinade) for a few hours. Then I sprayed a 9x13 casserole dish with nonstick spray and dumped the whole mixture in and baked at 400°. I probably baked it for somewhere around 45min-1hour. I didn’t time it, but I checked on it/stirred it up every 15min or so. Once I thought the chicken was cooked all the way through, I shut the oven off and left the dish in the oven for another 30min or so. It turned out perfect, tender, and super flavorful. This will definitely be a weekly meal at our home!

I have made a ton of grilled chicken over the years using various marinade recipes. This recipe is hands down off the charts. The best, most delicious marinade I have ever used. Any I was not (until this recipe) a huge Ranch dressing fan. This marinade transforms not only chicken but veggies as well as serves as an excellent dipping sauce. Not that this recipe needed any adjustments but to suit my personal taste I doubled the recipe, after reading other recommendations marinaded the chicken overnight (which due to the amount of acids was needlessly slightly nervous about), added extra lemon juice, used brown instead of white sugar, added fresh garlic and thyme. THANKS for the recipe - only marinade I will use in the future.

This is outstanding. I loathe ranch flavor and this tasted nothing like it. I've made the kabobs and chicken breasts and they are both delicious! I let them marinade overnight.

YUM!!!!!! These are so dang good!!! Easily one of my favorite dinners. Instead of marinating it for only 30 minutes, I did it for 6 hours. I used 2 teaspoons pepper, and I added more Rosemary. Oh and I also omitted the sugar, it definetly doesn't need it, and it means this dish s even healthier!

This is a family favorite!!

Even the teenagers like this one. No changes made other than doing the chicken in strips since it is easier. I forgot the Roemsary one time, they still liked it. I normally marinade for at least 4 hours, make a little extra sauce for dipping.

This is a great recipe. In the past my daughter made them, doing them as kabobs on the grill and they were wonderful. After reading some of the reviews and seeing that others had just done them in the oven and also as just breast halves and not cubes, I decided I would try that. I was in a huge hurry and all I did was dump all the marinade ingredients into a gallon zip-lock bag, shake it up,  throw in 5 chicken breast halves and let it sit for 30 minutes. Then I dumped the whole thing, marinade and all, into a shallow baking pan, covered with foil and baked at 400 for 25 minutes. Perfection! I just ate a piece of the leftover chicken and it was even better. Very moist, tender chicken with a good flavor. I followed the ingredient list exactly and wouldn't change a thing.

Marinated with chicken cutlets, baked in oven , then broiled .  It was the most tender chicken ever. Followed recipe but only added 1/2 the salt and sprinkled some sugar in.  I think the amount of sugar depends on which Ranch dressing you used.  Definitely will make again.

I'd give this 6 stars if I could.  I did what others have said and halved the oil and used 1 tsp salt and the tablespoon of sugar and it was incredible. I used a bit of the marinate to baste the Kabobs as they cooked on the grill to keep them moist. The wife and sister in law couldn't get enough. I'm going to need to double my serving next time just to keep them happy. Great recipe!

I didn't make kabobs per say but skewers!  they were wonderful!  Flavor was full and not salty as I had worried it would be.  I did marinate longer than original recipe.  but wow really good!  Definitely a keeper and a will be making this again!  thank you or sharing this wonderful recipe!  Oh, forgot to mention I used this marinade to make some shrimp!  OMG! GREAT STUFF!  cooked the shrimp in the marinade in a skillet and after removing the shrimp I let it reduce a bit and used as a sauce! NUMMY!

Wow! This is an amazing marinade!  I followed the recipe to a tee, using hidden valley light ranch and I marinated whole chicken breast instead of chicken chunks on a skewer. This is some of the most  flavorful, moist chicken we have had in a long time. I prepared enough for left overs, hoping to use it for salads the next night. My husband and sons devoured every piece of chicken I grilled, so no left overs. The recipe will be a keeper for my family. Thank you Theresa.

Didn't  have rosemary, but made the rest of the marindade exactly as written.  I marinated overnight.   It was a hit for everyone in the family.  
Made this again with just an hour for marination.  It is so, so good!

This is definitely a different flavour for chicken, and quite good too. Unfortunately I got lazy and stuck it in the oven in the marinade as someone else had done. Next time I will use the grill, I think it will be even better.

I would have given this recipe 5 stars, but I made some changes. Both of my kids love it! (Ages 2 and 4, they both ask for seconds) I cut the amount of oil and salt in half. I've also made it three different ways, my personal favorite was in the oven. I put the marinated chicken in a glass baking dish and baked on 375 for 25 minutes. I then broiled each side for 3 minutes a piece (having drizzled some of the sauce left over in the baking dish). I wish I would have cooked a little more sauce, it's delicious to dip and put on other side items.

Should have made a double batch, we gobbled them up!! They do almost melt in your mouth. I didn't have lemon juice so I used white wine vinegar for that and for the regular vinegar and was sad to see my fresh rosemary bush done for the season so I used dry. Let it marinate all day and grilled it in the oven. Awesome!!

This rosemary ranch chicken is amazing. So much so that I have made it about every other night. Yep, when the hubby eats the leftovers and we're fighting for the last piece, it's just that good. I haven't used the hidden valley ranch yet, but eventually will. I use Ken's Ranch dressing and I leave out the extra salt. I also don't use the full tbsp of sugar, just under it. I thought it was a lot of olive oil, and next time I will try it with the 1/4 cup like everyone said in the reviews.  So when I make this, I just alternate skewer fresh pineapple and chicken. I cut the pineapple to about 1/2-3/4 inch thickness and when I skewer them, I put it against the fibers, so they don't fall off when grilling (I've had it happen the first few times I made this). Hope you like it. :-) (I feel like I was in paradise eating golden pineapples and moist fragrant chicken.  Geez, talk about obsessive.. Ha-ha)

This is an all time favorite.  We usually do not even bother with the kabobs...just make it with boneless skinless chicken cut into strips.  It is delicious and tender.  I found this recipe 6 years ago, saved it to my recipe box and have been making it ever since!  We serve it a lot at big get-togethers and it is always a hit.

No leftovers! I adjusted the recipe for about a pound of chicken (eyeballing it) which for my family normally means leftovers and EVERYONE ate seconds. The hubs is the biggest food critic and he asked for it to be added to the regular menu.

This was delicious! I wouldn't change a thing. So flavorful. I marinated it overnight and all day. I didn't make them into kabobs. I used thin chicken breasts and cooked them on the bbq. Definitely a keeper.

I have not done this yet, but will let my chicken sit over night for sure before grilling. That could intense the flavor when ready to grill and serve with rice. But I must say I have made cutlets with covering them with the ranch dressing then bread crumbs and any thing else you add (cheese). Then frying in a oil of your choice and it is really tender and crispy with sauce or not. Yum

Oh my god! An absolute winner in my house. I have 4 children, youngest being 5 - 12 and they all couldn't get enough of it! I will say that grilling is definitely the way to go because it encapsulates every bit of the flavor from the fresh rosemary. Made it again for some family that came over and they begged me to tell them where I got this recipe. Kudos to the inventor of this recipe! Two big thumbs up!

This was very easy to make.  Only thing I did different was add 1/2 teaspoon of salt instead of 2 teaspoons.  The Ranch Dressing and Worcestershire sauce already had enough salt for me.  The kabobs cook very fast.  I may have overcooked mine a little.  I put the kabobs on a bed of steamed spinach.  We also had garlic potatoes.  Yummy!

This is the best chicken marinade I have ever tasted.  I followed the recipe exactly as written.  (I confess I marinaded it all day long.)  My family loves it - there are never any leftovers.  I also shared it with a neighbor who fell in love with it also.

We added some pieces of peppers and onions between the chicken on the skewers just because we're a family of 6 so "fillers" are needed.  Made the sauce as written though, hubby grilled, and oh man-this was yummy!!! I've recommended to all my friends and we will definitely be having it many more times!

This marinade is so delish!  I didn't do the chicken as Kabobs since it's been an awful winter here in the Northeast; instead, I used my cast iron grill pan and it worked beautifully!  Will definitely be making this one more often - even my kids liked it!

Yep very tasty.   Made multiple times and kids seem to like it as much as everyone else.  Cut the ranch to half the last two times.   Still ranch flavor just a little more subtle.   Quick and easy.   Def a keeper for week night meal.

This was super good.  I get really tired of chicken and often think kabobs are just extra steps for the same old thing but these were really good.  I used good quality chicken breasts and a refrigerator brand ranch dressing which probably helped in the outcome but otherwise I followed the recipe as written and they turned our really moist and tender.  I will add these to the regular rotation of good menu items.  Would be a definite contender for summertime entertaining.

we loved these. however I served them with a siracha ranch dipping sauce I whipped up. they were delicious with the dipping sauce. I put them in marinate in the morning and grilled them later in the evening. I also left out the salt.

Excellent recipe!! Easy and delicious. My grill gets pretty hot, so I took the kabobs off after about 5-6 minutes. Didn't get a chance to flip them, but I liked the extra crispy grill marks.

I have been making this for about a year now and realized I hadnt left a review! This is delicious, the chicken turns out sooooo tender. I process the Rosemary in a little food processor/chopper, just quicker than mincing by hand. I also use chicken tenderloins so I don't have to thread chunks onto skewers. Just cook them directly on the grill. Otherwise I make the marinade exactly as described. My husband and kids can't get enough!!

Well this is my first review, so obviously it was amazing! I didn't have a bottle of ranch on hand, so I used ranch dip packet made with sour cream and then thinned it out with milk. So good! Thanks for the recipe!

Chicken was very tender, I marinated for one hour only because I forgot about the chicken, and I ended up baking in the over with all of the marinade and serving over angel hair pasta. I poured the cooked sauce over the chicken to serve, was very delic, I didn't alter the ingredients at all.

We didn't care for this.  I can't explain it, kind of bland with a hint of tang.  My daughter usually likes anything chicken.. but she didn't eat it.  I followed the recipe exactly.  Maybe with some tweaking.  Sorry

These were tender and tasty.  Even my non-chicken loving husband ate the entire skewer.  I made a double batch of marinade and cut up summer squash, sweet red peppers, onion chunks and button mushrooms and marinated them in their own container as well.  Yum!

This was so easy for very flavorful, moist chicken.  Family really liked it.  I used Annie's Cowgirl Ranch dressing - not sure if that made any difference, since this was my first time.

I was very impressed with this recipe.  My wife and kids loved it!  Even my 5 year old ate all of the chicken on his plate.  That's a miracle in itself.  The meat was very tender and packed full of flavor.  Nice job to the creator of this recipe.  I'm giving it 5 stars!!!!!

Love. Love. LOVE this recipe! So moist, flavorful and delicious! I omit the sugar and use red wine vinegar instead of white vinegar. I marinate overnight and am careful to only cook until they are just done to maintain moistness and flavor. If there are any leftover, I chop them up and use it to make leftover chicken croquettes, yum! I came across this recipe last year when looking for low-carb chicken recipes. THANK YOU for sharing!

The dish was good but I didn't want to deal with the kabobs so I cooked it in a casserole dish in the oven as others mentioned.  I think though, that pouring in all the sauce was too much, the chicken was almost 'boiled' in it. I would have been better off holding some of the sauce off to the side. I will try again though.

Was Very good. I didn't make any changes other than  I marainaded it for a couple of hours before cooking.  I didn't make Kabobs and I cooked it in the oven.  The left over marainade I boiled and then mixed into the white rice I made seperate.

I loved this chicken kabob recipe - I did use the "adjust" to cut the recipe in haLf and added a splash of white wine which I was drinking at the time and then grilled the kabobs for 15 minutes over medium high heat - served with some chicken flavored pasta sides and some blanched broccoli and cauliflower tops - it was great for Sunday dinner -

One of the best chicken recipes I've tried. My husband and daughter couldn't get enough. Yum yum yum. Used chicken breast not as kabobs, Absolutely  a keeper.

i Love this recipe i do this about once a week the one thing i suggest is  that weather you use breast meat or boneless thighs let it marinate overnight it makes it extra delicious.

Followed the ingredients exactly and it was so good!  I did end up baking the chicken in the marinade for 30 minutes at 350.  I cut the chicken in strips before baking and I wanted to try this w/rice as others have suggested.  But I didn't have rice so I mashed some potatoes instead and it was really good.  Looking forward to grilling as directed when I can.  But will also continue to bake it this way too.  So good, the flavor is fantastic.

We've made these several times now, and they are a hit with the whole family!  Wonderful flavor, even if there isn't time to let them sit and marinate.  I usually make a little extra marinade so that it covers the chicken completely, and I prefer a little extra worchestershire and rosemary (fresh is a MUST!).  No matter how much chicken I make, everyone gobbles it up and there are no leftovers!

This is a great recipe! I had no rosemary in the house so used tarragon and it was delicious. I also omitted salt and didn't miss it. will make this again with rosemary next time.

Great recipe but I did a couple things differently.  I omitted the salt and used only half the oil. I used dried rosemary because I had it on hand so used only 1 teaspoon instead of a tablespoon.  I mixed this up before work so the chicken marinated most of the day and then I cooked them in a non stick pan over the stove.  Served with roasted potatoes.

I too cooked this in the marinade in the oven for 25 minutes @ 350. I marinated my meat for 4 hours before cooking, omitted the salt, and used dried rosemary. It was flavorful, tender and a keeper. Thank you for sharing!

1/2 cup of oil is way too much.  I used two tablespoons and it was plenty.  To me, the flavor is lacking; which really surprised me given the ranch dressing and Worcestershire, not to mention the vinegar, lemon and sugar.  It grilled up nice and moist but it wasn't nearly as good as I had hoped.

FANTASTIC! I followed the recipe exactly, and instead of threading the chicken onto skewers and throwing the marinade away, I baked everything in a casserole dish in the oven at 375 degrees for about 40 minutes, and served it over rice. It was a hit with the entire family. I followed this suggestion from other reviewers and I'm very glad I did. *REVISION, as we found it a bit salty (for oven version only) - reduce the salt to 1/4 teaspoon, reduce the oil to 1/4 cup, and increase the ranch dressing to 3/4 cup. Otherwise, if preparing this for kebobs, follow Theresa's recipe exactly and you won't be disappointed!

This is a wonderful marinade. I used bacon ranch and it was great. I didn't know how the Worcestershire sauce would go with the ranch but thought it was excellent. I am one of the very rare people who does not like rosemary so I used oregano and basil instead. I did not add pepper, salt or sugar because I thought the dressing probably had enough sugar and salt and sometimes pepper can be too over powering.

It was good, but would really only pair well with white rice and other bland starches. I liked it a lot more than the rest of my family. I might make it again, but it won't go into my regular rotation.

I doubled the marinade (though I first halved the oil, salt, & sugar) to toss it with orzo & cooked broccoli.  I also used half the amount of rosemary because I used dried rosemary.  Was out of Worcestershire but it didn't seem to be lacking without it.  I cooked them in the oven on metal skewers under the broiler for 5 min, flipped and cooked 5 min more.  Easy and very flavorful!

Fantastic!  Was looking for a new chicken recipe and this recipe was excellent!  I did omit the sugar because my husband is a diabetic.  We didn't miss it at all.  My kids loved it.  I used bottled WalMart buttermilk ranch dressing(found in the produce section) and fresh rosemary.  I grilled it and we devoured it!  Will definitely be making again.  Thanks

This was amazingly delicious! A definite keeper, I can't wait to serve again.  I reduced the olive oil & ranch dressing to 1/3 of a cup each - seemed like too much marinade - and kept the rest of the ingredients the same.  Next time I'll reduce the salt to 1/2 tsp, as it was a bit salty.

We just had these chicken kabobs for dinner tonight and they were really, really good! I couldn't find my measuring spoons so I just used a teaspoon and soup spoon to measure, and used boneless/skinless chicken thighs instead of breast meat, otherwise I followed the recipe exactly.  We found the kabobs flavorful and moist, with just the right amount of charring.  I wish I had made extra marinade for dipping or to put on the rice we had with it.  My husband suggested we try it with beef the next time, so we will give that a whirl.  P.S.-Sorry no photo, we ate every last morsel!

So delicious and different from other marinades I've tried.  I made it exactly as called for and the different flavors were amazing together.  This may be my new favorite chicken dish.

This won raves from family. I prefer listing amounts of ingredients. Chicken breasts range from 4 ounces to 16 ounces. Usually recipes call for 6 ounce chicken breasts so for this recipe that would be 30 ounces. I used 2 pounds which was 32 ounces. Perfect. 
  I did as several suggested; reduced oil, salt and increased amount of rosemary. After marinating for several hours, the chicken and marinade was put into a 400 degree oven for 20 minutes. Absolutely wonderful served on basmati rice. Next time I will add browned chopped sweet onion or bell pepper. For my portion, I will add mushrooms.  Delicious sauce.

I mixed up and marinade in the morning, and the chicken marinated all day.  It had great flavor and grilled up in about 10 minutes.  Served this with 'Fire and Ice Salad' from AR, grilled Parmesan green beans, grilled garlic bread and 'Chocolate Stuffed Raspberries' a personal recipe from AR.

We don't have a grill so we cooked these stove-top. They were delish! I can only image what they will taste like grilled, yum!

I omitted the sugar and it was incredible! (I'm sure it's great with the sugar, I just didn't have any on hand). My boyfriend has asked me to make this three times since I first made it... that was last week!

Hubs and I loved these!  They made for a nice light summer meal served with green salad.  They would make great appetizers for a large gathering.  I clipped fresh rosemary from the garden, which made for a heavenly aroma. Not wanting to mess up the grill, I cooked them on a foil-lined grill basket as others suggested.  This was okay to do,  However, when I make these next time I'll cook them directly over the flame.  I missed that little bit of char on the meat.

We have made this recipe over and over and over again. I will not even eat chicken kabobs on the grill any other way now. Friends love it and always request the recipe. I usually think chicken is bland and tasteless, but these are so moist and flavorful. I cut the chicken pieces into about 1.5" cubes and then toss them in the marinade for 1-2 hours in the fridge. Even though this recipe has thousands of 5-star ratings, I always like to read the 1 and 2 star ratings just for fun. Some allrecipes users have said they bake the chicken instead of grilling, but I would think that would entirely change this recipe. IMHO, you should definitely grill these kabobs and do NOT overcook or of course they will get dry.  This recipe is not intended to be a sauce either--it's a marinade. I actually can't imagine eating it as a sauce--yuck. I do think it would be far too salty and creamy for that. Follow the recipe, folks. And if you do still find it is too salty for your likes, just omit or reduce the salt.

Easy and the kids love it! I've made it several times. It's still good with dry rosemary, but fresh is better. I often don't measure the ingredients and it still comes out great. Also, I don't usually bother with kabob skewers; just slice the chicken breast lengthwise into 3 pieces and grill.

great flavor. These were absolutely delicious, a hit with the entire family.  "Update" 10/20//2018 made this using another reviewers method in the oven- loved it more because the marinade is really excellent over rice!

The chicken was very favorable, and my whole family approved! I also used onion, yellow pepper, and cherry tomatoes all tossed with olive oil, salt, and pepper to alternate with the chicken on the kabobs. The size of the chicken cubes was perfect for the veggie slices and they both finished cooking perfectly, and complimented each other very well. I recommend this to anyone who wants a nice, easy, summer mean with very little prep and clean up needed.

Made this for a 4th of July potluck picnic where we were asked to bring something for the grill.  I used homemade ranch dressing and about 2 pounds of chicken tenderloins and fresh rosemary.  The only flavor I could really detect on the chicken was rosemary.  They were good and went very quickly.  Thanks!

I have made this recipe two times, both to outstanding reviews from friends.  I make this exactly as the recipe states, except I marinated for about 4 hours. It was an amazing dinner. The kabobs were moist, flavorful and totally delicious. I used Hidden Valley Ranch dressing, premium olive oil and fresh rosemary. I served with crock pot baked potatoes, side salad and bakery rosemary bread. Be sure to add additional olive oil or cooking spray to your grill because the chicken will stick. FANTASTIC! Thank you so much for sharing this recipe.

Couldn't be happier with this recipe. I used dried instead of fresh rosemary (one teaspoon dried = one tablespoon fresh) and omitted the option sugar. Had to broil as I'm grill-challenged but the chicken was very moist and tasty. Thanks, this will be a staple around here.

This marinade is fantastic!! I used it on chicken breasts a few times and used it for pork chops for the first time last night and yum!!!! Can't wait to try it out on a nice pork tenderloin. The possibilities are really endless. Don't limit yourself to just using it for the kabobs.

Seriously, the most delicious kabobs I have ever eaten. This may be the most delicious recipe on all of allrecipes.com!
We cut the amount of chicken in half and reserved 1/3 of the marinade after we made it. (We didn't have enough Worcestershire sauce so we subbed in a couple of Tablespoons of steak sauce.) We marinated the chicken overnight, and threaded it onto the skewers along with some mini potatoes (nuked first), mini sweet peppers, and Vidalia onion. We used the reserved marinade to brush onto the vegetables during grilling.
Delicious!

very tasty, reduce salt, as it is not needed due to Rranch dressing and did not cut chicken in cubes.  Used chicken tenders and grilled them whole as they are so small already.  Very moist, served with green salad with Ranch  Dx. and lemon bowtie pasta salad.

Very flavourful and moist! I read another reviewer's notes that she baked it with the sauce on top at 450 for 20 minutes.  This worked great.  Leftovers were amazing too!

Followed recipe as written (except I didn't have fresh rosemary) and it was DEEEEEEEEEEEEEELICIOUS!!!!!!!!!!!!  Added onions, mushrooms, red, yellow, and orange peppers (let them sit in a separate bag w/ the same marinade) and they were super yummy too!  PS:  I cooked my kabobs on the GF and they turned out great!!!  Nice char/crisp on the veggies and chicken.

I used this on whole breasts baked in the oven at 450 for 30 minutes.  I simply sprayed a glass casserole dish with non-stick spray, put in the breasts and dumped on the sauce to cook!  This was absolutely the best chicken I have ever made.  It's super easy and amazingly delicious.  Even my picky 2 year old ate a WHOLE chicken breast and all his vegetables with the sauce on them!  I am planning to actually try this in a crock pot with potatoes and carrots in an almost "pot roast" style dish!

I should also note that I used Hidden Valley Ranch's dry powder and not pre-mixed ranch dressing.  I was actually out of sour cream so I went with the lower fat option of using Mayonnaise to mix the powder.  (I use Duke's Mayonnaise for mixes due to it's great flavor)and this worked out very, very well.

Just made this for supper and absolutely LOVED IT!  Super simple, I omitted the sugar and only did 1/4 cup ranch and oil but I only had two breasts.   There was a lot of leftover marinade.  Next time I will reserve some for a dip maybe.   I baked it on 375, with skewers on foil lined cookie sheet for 20 min (flip halfway!) then broiled it on high for 2 minutes.   YUM YUM YUMMMMM

This was fantastic, even my 16 month old loves them. My suggestion is, though, to grill on low and continue to baste the chicken while grilling with the left over sauce, it enhanced the flavor so much compared to the time with out.

Tried this one last night and it was amazing! My 5yr old and my 18 month old both loved it too. We didn't change a thing except increase the marinade time.

I only used a couple tablespoons of oil. I used chicken tenders, marinated it overnight. And baked in the oven. Everyone loved them. I reserved some marinate for dipping and to pour over rice. I never use the sugar or salt

OH MY GOODNES, THIS RECIPE IS GREAT! My Whole Family Loves It! I Didn't Add Any Rosemary Because We Didn't Have Any And Then I Grilled Chicken Breasts Whole (Didn't Make kabobs)

We had sworn off of boneless, skinless breasts until I found this recipe.  We could never keep them from being tough and dry.  But these were delicious.  I followed the recipe exactly and they were wonderful.  The whole family said to add this one to the regular grilling-season rotation.

This marinade is awesome! I didn't have lemon juice so I just doubled the vinegar. I also used thigh and leg meat for the kabobs because I like dark meat better prepared this way. Just personal preference. I also halved the recipe and there was more than enough. My husband said he would eat this every week. My 14 month old ate this up too so I guess he liked it!

These are excellent! They are very tasty, very juicy and pretty easy to make. I followed the recipe exactly and it works well. I think FRESH rosemary is the key to making this recipe as good as possible.

My family and I loved these! I always read through the reviews before making any recipe, so based on what others had to say I reduced the olive oil to 1/4 cup, and used light ranch to make it a bit healthier. Other than that, I didn't change a thing! We've already made these twice in the past couple of weeks.

We make these all the time! It's a mild flavor, which is great if you have picky eaters. We've also baked these on a cookie sheet in the oven.

Awesome recipe! I have made it as written and with twists and all come out great :) Recently, on a cold rainy Dec night I have made it with 4 chicken breasts cut up into bite sized pieces, half a red bell pepper, a small onion and 2 celery ribs chopped up in a 13x9 in the oven at 375 for 15-20 min and it's amazing over rice. Kids gobbled it right up. I substituted dry Italian seasoning for the rosemary in a pinch, decreased the Worcester since my daughter doesn't care for it, and decreased olive oil to 1/4c when baking, good flavor. Thanks, this recipe is a keeper, especially love that you can twist it to fit what happens to be in your pantry with great results!

We don't skewer the chicken but cook it in a grill basket.  It turns out great every time and leftovers are great on salad for the next day's lunch.  I didn't change the recipe at all.

I made these this past weekend, and they are really good! I threaded the chicken, along with veggies (red, yellow, green peppers, cherry tomatoes and pearl onions), onto the skewers before I marinated them though. I put them into 9x12 covered glass casseroles, refrigerated and marinated overnight. My family really liked it, right down to my 3 year old grandson that wanted 2nd's! If you don't use FRESH ROSEMARY for this dish, you're simply not getting the full flavor possible here! The only change I made to the marinade mixture is that I used half the salt suggested. Thank you Theresa Spencer!

I tried it once as kabobs but cutting up the chicken took to long. So now I just use skinless, boneless, chicken breast. It is fabulous and the chicken so tender. Our family just loves it!!

I have been using this recipe for about two years.  My family loves this recipe.  I make it up as a marinade and use it on all my grilled chicken.  It is by far the best grilled chicken we have ever had.  I don't change anything in the recipe but do it exactly as written.  It is excellent!!!

My teenage son ate everything! This is a fantastic recipe. Followed the recipe exactly the first time. It was a great balance between tangy and sweet. Made for very tender and juicy chicken. We saved some of the marinade and used for dunking and to flavor rice. This will become a go to! Lora Deanne

WOW!!!!  Have never been a big fan of rosemary but these kabobs were FANTASTIC  I followed the recipe exactly, something I rarely do, and I am so glad I did.  Everyone in my very large family agreed that they were great and I have to make them again.  Having them all agree is extremely rare.  This dinner was miraculous on all levels.

The marinade is super easy to make. I followed the recipe, and only difference is my chicken marinated in the fridge for about 24 hours before cooking. The chicken was moist and tender and really retained the flavor or the marinade. We will make again for sure!

Made this exactly as listed - I only used three breasts, but made the same amount of marinade and saved a little before putting the chicken in, so I could use it on rice. This recipe is fantastic and easy, I am definitely saving it! Remember to soak your skewers if you use wood ones, so they don't totally burn away.

Very good recipe.  In the words of my 2 year old "Mmm...mmm...pretty good chicken".  I used the recipe itself exactly as stated but put it on whole chicken breasts which I cooked in the oven, they were so good, enjoyed by my 1 year old, 2 year old and my hubby...a big hit!!!

This is unbelievably delicious. And is it really under 400 calories for 6 skewers? Amazing!

This was great!  Very moist and tender!  Even my picky eaters ate it up!  We ran out of ranch the second time and used Caesar instead and it was still delicious!

These were pretty good- I used chicken thigh. I would add a bit more spicy next time but will try it in the oven too. Very juicy and easy to prepare!

What a let down - bland flavor, not moist.  Hubby said "tastes chalky".  This recipe sounded very good but ended up in the recycle pile. I like dipping chicken in ranch dressing but this one missed the mark.

Very tasty. Heavy on the salt for us though... lots of salt in other ingredients.  Will omit salt next time. Didn't have lemon on hand so used a combo of lemon juice concentrate (2tbsp) & lemon pepper (1tsp). Had to cook in oven so just used chicken beast strips and baked at 350 about 35 mins browning a little.  For this method, could have used less oil in the marinate.

Made this last night.  Everyone liked it.  The chicken was flavorful and juicy.  Added red and orange peppers and plum tomatoes cut down the middle.  This was my first time making kabobs so I was impressed with the outcome.  Will be making these again soon.

I made this on a whim last night, and it was even better than expected! My mouth is watering for more as I write this. My bbq was out of propane so I just put the kabobs on a cookie sheet in the oven at 375 for about 23 minutes with a loose piece of foil over the top and it worked fine for me. The olive oil I used was infused with garlic and rosemary, but otherwise I made the recipe as written. Unfortunately my husband didn't really care for it (he doesn't like creamy sauces) but this is something I'd definitely make again for a dinner party or a pot luck when more people are there to eat them. I lightly simmered some garlic in olive oil, then stirred it into cooked white rice and served the kabobs over that. The presentation of the kabobs is beautiful, and they taste like something you'd get in a nice restaurant. 5 stars in my book!

Outstanding!!  This is actually the first kabob I've ever made and oh boy was it delicious!  My boyfriend who is not a chicken person and I who am not a ranch person absolutely loved these!  We made the marinade using peppercorn ranch dressing and about half the amount of kosher salt instead of regular and let it soak for about an hour before grilling.  Also made zucchini, squash and red onion kabobs to go with it.  What a perfect summer meal!

I've made this twice, and it's fabulous! Instead of ranch dressing, I used plain non-fat yogurt and added  1/2 tablespoon Penzey's peppercorn dressing base. It's much healthier, plus I'm on a diet. (If you don't have a Penzey's Spice store nearby, substitute 1/2 tsp. fresh ground Tellicherry pepper, 1/2 tsp parsley, 1/4 tsp. garlic powder, 1/8 tsp thyme.) I also used a low sugar Worcestershire sauce, and left out the sugar completely - it's just not needed! I let everything marinade for an hour or two before grilling. This is my new favorite summertime chicken recipe!

I used this recipe with two quite large chicken breast halves (bone in and with the skin on). I baked them at 350 degrees until they reached an internal temp of 165 degrees.  Followed the recipe for the marinade to the tee and marinated the breasts over night because they were so big.  It's not something I would make on a regular basis but for something different every now and then it was good. I added 4 peeled medium sized russet potatoes and 4 medium Walla Walla onions to the roasting pan and poured the left over marinade over them before I baked everything together. I also sprinkled some fresh rosemary leaves over everything before baking.  The potatoes and onions were even better than the chicken.

I marinaded my chicken for about 1.5 hours and then baked it for 30 minutes at 450 degrees.  Made a second batch of the marinade for 2 onions and two red peppers that I cut up - baked those in a separate dish but in the same oven as the chicken.  Served with rice.  Not crazy about it.  I think the sauce by itself over the rice (in addition to the marinade) would be better.

Instead of adding rosemary, I dried sprigs from my garden, and used these as skewers.  We also ran out of propane, so I broiled instead of grilling.  I added a little cayenne for some kick.  Otherwise, followed the recipe as stated.  My family really loved this!  The rosemary flavor from the skewers permeated the meat completely - I'm glad I didn't add the rosemary in the recipe.  Only use the sprigs as skewers if you really like rosemary a lot.

I LOVE this one!!! It's my go-to recipe for grilling, especially boneless chicken.  I usually use boneless chicken thighs, which is inexpensive and the the dark meat is more flavorful.  It always comes out tender and juicy.  I slice it into strips.  The smaller pieces only need 3-4 minutes grilling on each side. It also works great with a George Forman electric grill. I omit the sugar and salt.  It's got plenty of flavor without those.  I now buy my ranch dressing and worcestershire sauce in the industrial sizes at a big-box store because I'm making this several times a month.  Oh, and it doesn't need long in the marinade. In a pinch, I've done for as little as 10 or 15 minutes with great results.

Followed this recipe exactly except used seasoned rice vinegar because I didn't have white vinegar and cut the oil in half. Marinated for one hour. Skewered with orange peppers and purple onion and served with spinach salad, made for a great presentation! Cooked on the BBQ approx 2.5 mins per side on medium heat and the chicken remained moist and veggies lightly roasted. Amazing recipe except there were no leftovers!

Simple and delicious.  I made this following the recipe to a "T" (except cutting it down to 4 servings) and it came out beautifully.  Just the right amount of rosemary.  Just be sure not to overcook the chicken!

Used as marinade for boneless skinless breasts. Marinated about 3 hours. Was delish off the grill. Easy for a beginner cook like myself and a nice change of flavor for a family who eats chicken often. Also, south beach diet phase 1 friendly.

These are fab-U-riffic! They're great just as is. Made them as kebabs just like in the recipe. Tweaks were to add 2 veggie kebabs per serving, marinated in same marinade but separately to avoid salmonella, and included Vidalia sweet onions, brown mushrooms, green, red, and yellow bell peppers, and red and yellow cherry tomatoes. Sides offered were rice pilaf, potato salad, cottage cheese, fruit medley, fresh baked whole grain bread, black and green olives and sweet and dill pickle spears. Dessert? Strawberry yogurt pie.

We loved this.  I followed the recipe exactly, except I marinated the chicken about 2.5 hours instead of 30 minutes.  It was seasoned well, with lots of flavor.  Some reviews say it didn't have enough flavor, but I don't see how that is possible.  The chicken grilled up moist and juicy.  We served it to our neighbors at a dinner party and everyone loved it.  I'm adding this to my go-to list!

Did not add salt or very much olive oil. 
Added dried rosemary instead of fresh, reduced salt worcestershire sauce and hidden valley ranch. 
Marinated for 7 hours.
Baked chicken breast and green beans in a pan with the sauce for 20 minutes @ 350.

The flavor was ok. Just tasted like ranch mixed with worcestershire sauce and every know and then a hint of rosemary. Maybe I'll try putting on a kabob next time. Hmm.

These are excellent!, great flavor and easy to make. I only ended up using 1 tsp of salt instead of 2, other then that no changes.

I loved this- but did Everyone 'Miss the line' in # 2. of Directions?
"DISCARD MARINADE".

If you are not cooking on stove in pan, or in oven, then marinade, having had Raw Meat[any kind but especially fowl] in it,- can give
you salmonella poisoning. Most of the reviews just said" I put marinade over veggies,potatos/rice. It has to be 165 degrees to kill salmonella. Ya'll Please be careful while we enjoy such wonderful,tasty treats.

I didnt have any rosemary so I used the same amount of oregano and a little parsley. I also didn't add any salt. I marinated it for about 4 hours and then baked it in the oven as suggested by another reviewer for 20 minutes at 450 degrees. It came out with a wonderful texture and a good potential for taste but the amount of olive oil made it look sort of gross, was a bit overpowering, and made it too oily. Next time I hope to use about half the amount of olive oil. Thanks for the recipe! =)

These are great! First time I made them I had all the ingredients and they were exactly what we wanted (I omitted the sugar). But the next time I made them, I was out of Worcestershire sauce, lemon juice and rosemary. I subbed in soya sauce, orange juice and herbs de provence, respectively. They were even better!! These have become a summer family favourite. Excellent starter recipe. :)

Love this recipe!  Super tender, used it on salmon, any kind of chicken, or pork.  Make extra sauce for dipping.

Just made these for dinner tonight.  Started with a foil grill pan on the grill as another suggeted, then moved them directly onto the grill at the end to get some grill lines and a finished appearance.  We ate them, but I probably won't make this again.  It's always fun to try something different.  Thanks for sharing.

Excellent chicken recipe!  I don't have a grill so I just baked them (at 450 for 20 minutes like I read in another review) and it was amazing.  I let them marinate for a couple hours and then baked them with the marinade.  I left out the sugar and worcester sauce. They were really flavorful.  When I first mixed up the marinade I thought it didn't smell very rosemary-y at all, but after cooking the flavor is definitely there.

Just made it for my teenagers and they all loved it! I used an earlier comment and roasted them in the oven (15-20 min at 425). The kids love gravy on everything so after putting the kebabs on a platter I skimmed off the fat, mix a tablespoon of flour with cold water and whisked it in the pan at high heat until it thickened and poured it over. Great recipe, thanks!

I made half of this recipe cutting back on the salt and omitting the lemon juice.  I was skeptical about the sugar, but I did use the full amount.  I got lazy and didn’t make this into kabobs, but just used skinless/boneless chicken breast halves.  I did reserve a small amount of marinade to baste on while grilling, but I wouldn’t do that next time.  The additional basting really didn’t add to the appearance, as I hoped it would.  Very good and a little different!

I loved these!! They were great!! I cut the salt but that was the only change that I made to the sauce. I did throw in some whole mushrooms with the chicken to marniade in the sauce. They had great flavor too. I will make this again without a doubt.

OUTSTANDING!  Delicious flavor, very tender, and goes well with a variety of side dishes.  Satisfied everyone in the family including my daughter who says she "hates" grilled chicken.  They ask me to cook this for them regularly!

I was a bit disappointed after all the rave reviews.  This was good but not WOW good.  I did have to use dried rosemary so maybe fresh is what would take this over the egde....?  Anyway, I cut the salt and oil by half as suggested by others.   Made extra kabobs with green and yellow peppers and zucchini.  Might try this again if I end up with fresh rosemary in the house.

I don't give many five star ratings - but these kabobs really deserve it. The only change I made was to omit the sugar. They were great. I added a some veggies to the skewers, broiled them, and served them with rice pilaf. My family loved them.

This was wonderful! We have a local pizza place that makes really good ranch dressing and I used it for this marinade. I made a triple batch so that i had some left over as sauce and enough for alot of chicken. Put cubed chicken into gallon sized bags then split marinade into thirds - 1/3 in each bag them 1/3 left over. Marinaded overnight and skewered the next day. Tender, juicy and delicious. Our dinner party guests said it could rival any of the Mediterranean restaurants in our metro Detroit area. Served with rice pilaf and it was spectacular. I did not put in the sugar as some other reviewers mentioned.

This was awesome!! I doubled the recipe and put the chicken in one bowl and red potatoes in another. I did cook the potatoes in the microwave for a few minutes, before putting in the bowl. Both came out great! Will make quite often!!

This was wonderful. Have to admit that I myself have not prepared this dish yet, but it was served to us by my sister-in-law last week. When she told me the name of the recipe I thought hmmmm....that sounds familiar....maybe because I had saved it to my own recipe box a few weeks back! Thanks for a different and delicious departure from "same old chicken"!

UPDATE: we've made this chicken I'd say at least 20 times in the last few years....everyone absolutely loves it! I've even done it in a sauté pan when the weather wouldn't cooperate. Wish I could give this 10 stars!!

This was the best marinade for chicken. No more bottled sauces for us. I let mine marinate in the fridge for about 5 hours before putting on the grill. Grilled extra to make chicken salad. My husband who puts hot sauce on everything didn't use any with this chicken. I can see making a batch of this grilled chicken every other week.

The flavor's good, but I think possibly these should marinate longer, because I didn't feel that the marinade really infused the chicken with only 30 minutes.

This is definitely a five star recipe!  It was a little too salty for me so I'll cut back on the sea salt next time but otherwise, WOW!  We loved it and so did the neighbors we had over for dinner!

I found the kabobs just okay. They were tender but   lacking in flavor.  I followed the recipe as directed except for reducing the olive oil to 1/4 cup. If I make this recipe again, I would add more rosemary.

Excellant!!  I'm too lazy to skewer so I broil chicken in marinade then add saute'd peppers, onions and mushrooms. Stir and serve!  My family loves it.

Yum!  Had these for dinner tonight and didn't change a thing with the recipe.  Liked these better than the steak kabobs we made a few weeks ago.  The flavor was wonderful!  Went great with the veggies we added to the skewers and a side of four cheese risotto.

This was pretty good! I have made this a few times as is (oops, except for no salt), hubby likes this recipe. Moist! This time I added some chipotle chili pepper and some cilantro, I personally think the longer you marinade the better so usually let em soak overnight. Good stuff thanks for sharing this recipe!

Even though I used reduced sodium Worcestershire sauce, this recipe was a little salty. I plan on omitting the salt next time. Other than that, it was delicious! The rosemary was subtle but noticeable.

I followed the directions exactly. Marinated overnight. Very juicy, my 2 year old LOVED these. My husband and I just weren't especially impressed. We served them at a BBQ with half of the ranch kabobs and half with just chicken with store bought BBQ sauce on them and most people said they liked the BBQ better. After reading all the reviews I was super excited to try them, but overall was disappointed.

so delicious!  I added red bell pepper and granny smith apples to the kabobs between the chicken and it was great!  The flavor of the chicken was finger lickin' good!  Hubby went back for seconds within 3 minutes and that is a rarity for him for new foods!

AWESOME! Used only about 1/3 c of dressing and oil b/c I did not have any more dressing than that, cut back on all other ingredients in marinade, too. Seems like you are always dumping out marinade anyway. Glad I did, it ended up being plenty for the amt of meat.  Forgot to put in the sugar, it came out great though.  Omitted the salt, there was plenty in the dressing I figured. Used dried rosemary, only a little over a tsp of it.  Had in the marinade for approx 1 1/4 hrs or so.  The kids, who normally complain about chicken, scarfed this right down.  Will definitely make again! Soaked my skewers in H2O for a few hours but they still got burnt on the ends, oh well, no matter, the chicken was awesome.

Quick and easy! Yum! Use fresh rosemary. Also can skip the kabobs and use on chicken strips on the grill.

We LOVED this recipe! It's super-easy but it tastes like you spent the entire day in the kitchen. I used full chicken breasts instead of making them into kabobs and used Kraft Calorie-Wise 3-Cheese Ranch Dressing. I also marinated the breasts for about 5 hours, instead of 30 minutes. Next time I will add an additional TBSP of rosemary and a bit of onion powder, and marinate it overnight (refrigerated, of course). To save time, instead of mincing the rosemary by hand, put it in a food processor with the olive oil, give it a good whirl, and then add all the remaining ingredients. I hope you enjoy this recipe as much as we did!

I was a little skeptical because the the mixture of ingredients sounded a little strange but it really came together nicely and was delicious! The reviews were spot on. My boyfriend wants to try it on fish now.

Everyone in the family loved this. We made kabobs first and they were good but everyone wanted more! The next night (because of requests) I did whole boneless breasts that had been pierced with a fork. Absolutely amazing! The only thing I did differently was used dried rosemary(about 1/4 tsp or less) and cut the salt in half. MAKE THIS RECIPE!!!!!

I use this marinade for my regular chicken breasts. I always cut the breast down. This way you get more flavor. If you leave them thick you end up with some bland chicken at the thickest parts. So cut the breast into 3 pieces and marinade overnight. When I place them on the grill I make sure it is a hot grill and I leave as much of the marinade on them as I can. I usually grill some corn with it and use roasted potatoes and you will have a home run! FANTASTIC flavor!

Easy and very good....only things I did differently was use dried rosemary since I didn't have fresh and marinate a few hours because it was more convenient. Will do this again for sure.

This was AWESOME!!!  The best chicken marinade I have ever tried.   So easy and delicious.  The chicken came out SO juicy and savory.  It will be a keeper forever and would even be great for guests.  I used dried rosemary because I didn't have fresh and I omitted the sugar.  I might omit the salt next time, it's flavorful enough with the other ingredients.  SOOO yummy.  Thank you for the great recipe!

This is a fantastic recipe and has made its way into our regular meal rotation. What we like about it the most is the flexibility. I want to begin by saying that I am not a big rosemary fan, however this recipe has the right combination of flavors that it satisfies both the rosemary lovers and those who aren't quite sure about it. The first time we made this, we made 3 batches: 1) using the recipe as written for the chicken kabobs (marinated for 5 hours), 2) omitted the vinegar and marinated vegetables (portobello, zucchini, bell peppers, onions) for 1 hour, 3) omitted the vinegar and worcestershire and used as dressing for tossed salad. I can't wait to try more variations. This is a "winner winner chicken dinner"!!

This recipe was great! I made the recipe same exact way except I used light hidden valley ranch, soy sauce light and chicken thighs. My only complaint was that it was a little too salty and I love salt which was surprising and a little oily. You can definitely omit the salt because the ranch and soy have enough on their own and next time I will cut down the the oil in half. This will be a repeat in my kitchen for sure!

Ok so i never write reviews, however i tried this recipe and everyone is asking for it.  The only thing i did different is cut back the sugar only using one teaspoon, used thin sliced chicken breasts  cut them in half and put them on the skewers like that.  AWESOME!!!!!

These were AMAZING.  I made them exactly as the recipe says, except I let the chicken sit in the marinade for 3 hours.  Tender, moist, and delicious!

I usually try something and tweak to my liking and then write all over the papers. This one is going to remain pristine in my recipe folder, it's just perfect as is.

Substituted a couple ingredients based on what I had (ex. soy sauce for worchestershire sauce) and it came out too salty.  I would probably try the same idea with just marinating it in the ranch dressing.  I know I didn't follow the recipe, though.

Very easy and flavorful. I started making this a year ago and it's a constant dinnertime favorite for my husband and two small children. We love it! Thanks for the amazing recipe!

Very tasty! I soaked my skewers ahead of grilling, but the ends of several still caught fire (I'm guessing from the oil in the marinade). So if you have a choice, use metal skewers or maybe use a damp paper towel to wipe the end of the wooden skewer after you thread it. I used only 1 tsp salt instead of 2 tsp, and it was plenty. Update: I've started just marinating chicken breasts a day ahead and grilling them. I think the meat stays more juicy and tender this way as opposed to kebabs. We always make an extra batch of marinade (minus the oil and adding a bit of water) to have as a sauce. When ready to serve, I just microwave the sauce. It's excellent over both the chicken and jasmine rice. Such a delicious recipe!

Used this recipe to make chicken breasts. They turned out really nice. I love the rosemary flavour in there. I did mine in the oven on 375 for 15 min per side. I made a bit more sauce for the pasta I served it with

If I could give this recipe more stars I would, it is fantastic...one of my very favorites from this site!  I add in a tablespoon of low sodium soy sauce, and I use rice wine vinegar and omit the sugar.  To make it simpler, instead of cubing chicken breasts, I skewer chicken tenderloin strips....OH MY they turn out so moist and flavorful!!!

This recipe is a KEEPER! I love recipes that you prep inadvance and use up all my fresh herbs!  I pounded my boneless chicken breast(since i wasnt making this as kabobs), halfed the salt and the oil-and marinated my chicken for about 5 hrs. and WHoa- Good! I also pounded out my chicken. IT was moist - cut with my fork- Something about the grill just brings out all the flavor.. and the little burnt crispie edges were the best! Will def. make this again and again.. ThANKS

My family loved this recipe! The chicken was full of flavor, moist and deliscious. I chose this recipe because my 3 year old loves ranch dressing and it's hard to find things he'll eat. Both my 3 nd 4 year olds loved this chicken. I will definitely make this one again.

ah-maz-ing! I really wasnt expecting much even though there are great reviews. But wow! This was so good. We doubled the recipe, added green bell pepper and onion the skewers. We had baked potatoes and corn on the cob. I had the left over chicken the next day with a smoothie for a healthy lunch!

What I liked most about this is that the chicken was so moist and tender!  Didn't dry out at all!  A little too much rosemary for our liking but was still really good!  I think perhaps because I basted with the leftover marinade it made the rosemary stronger (and I only had dry not fresh)....would have been better most likely if I wouldn't have done that.

Guests liked this recipe.  I had marinated it for a good 6 hours.  I thought it was good but had hoped that it would absorb a bit more flavour.

This meal was delicious and so easy and quick to make! I put the chicken in a dish covered in sauce and baked it for 20 minutes on 450 degrees. It was amazing. Rice or quinoa with it tastes great as well!

This is only the 2nd recipe I've reviewed because I'm so picky... WOW this was fantastic!  Here's what I did different - as others suggested I cut the oil in half.  I used chicken tenders, lite ranch, and apple cider vinegar because that's what I had on hand.  I do think I'll cut the salt in half next time but that's just personal taste. I also baked it in the marinade at 320* for 30 mins.  The meat was so white, juicy, and moist.  I used the sauce left over from baking on top of mashed red potatoes.  I am definitely bookmarking this one and sharing!!

I was looking for something different to do with chicken & I came across this recipe. I did not have skewers so I just cut the chicken breasts in strips, made the marinade ahead of time, poured it over the chicken & left it to marinade a few hours. It was so good! This one is a keeper.

This recipe was so amazing. We had my husbands co-workers over for a bbq and decided to test this recipe on the chicken kabobs. It was a huge hit! Our guests couldn't stop talking about how moist the chicken was even though the edges were just the perfect amount of crispy. We ate this with jasmine rice and roasted red, yellow, orange and green bell peppers. 

This is one for the recipe box!

If you are going to bake it, do not overdo the marinade it won't allow the chicken to crisp unless you only have a thin coating on top. Otherwise tasted good, not sure if it's a recipe I need to have again.

Awesome Recipe!!  My family thoroughly enjoyed these and are already asking me to make them again.  I made my own ranch dressing from another recipe on this site and used dry rosemary, as I had none fresh.  The chicken was so moist and tender and the flavor was just wonderful.  Thank you for sharing this recipe.

baked 5 breasts for 20-25 min and it was amazing. can't wait for the leftovers. sauce is delicious and smells heavenly. no changes necessary. next time i may experiment with some sort of heat to the dish, but it is great as is! would be good with roasted potatoes too.

Wow, finally something that both my 7 year old and 21 month old will eat!  My husband went back for seconds too!  I baked mushrooms, onions and green peppers for 20 mins at 450 degrees.  I put the chicken in our other oven for 20 mins at 350 degrees and served all of it over rice with extra sauce that I warmed in the micro for 45 seconds.  Came out perfect and super moist!

The combination of these simple ingredients is so tasty and seems like there's more in it than just these few things.  I've made these several times for cookouts and they're a crowd pleaser.

These were really good! I used dried thyme (1 teaspoon) instead of fresh rosemary and apple cider vinegar because I didn't have plain white vinegar. Will make these again!

LOVED IT.  Even the kids.  I didn't make enough, they were asking for more.  I cooked it as kabobs on the grill and the only thing I omitted was the sugar.  Used regualr Hidden Valley Ranch Dressing.

I have to double the recipe for my family :)  For even more tender chicken, replace the salt with 1 tsp. of meat tenderizer.  I get this ready in the morning before work and skewer and grill in the evening. So very very good.  Thanks!

This marinade is wonderful! I follow the directions exactly and get a great product every time!  I have made this on the grill as kabobs, and in my oven.  In both cases I make one batch of marinade for the chicken, and another for mushrooms, baby potatoes, and onions. 

On the grill I thread the veggies and the bite sized pieces of chicken. I take the extra marinade from the veggies only, and heat it through to make a side dipping sauce. 

In the oven, I cook the veggies on a large baking sheet, and the chicken in a separate container at 350 for 20 min until the chicken is cooked through and the juices run clear.  Then I take out the chicken, turn the heat up to 450 and finish the veggies for an additional 10 minutes. All of the marinade is put on the chicken, so I have lots of extra to use for my dinner!  

Prepared either way, you will wish you had more to keep for leftovers.

I've used this site for years and this is my first review... This recipe is the best chicken I think I've ever had and my whole family LOVED it. The only change I made was I doubled everything except the olive oil and salt. I will be making this again and again and again lol...

Loved, loved, loved these.  I used dried rosemary since this was all I had, and artificial sweetener instead of real sugar - these were excellent.  Next time I will triple the sauce and marinate the veggies in it too!   Thanks for the great recipe!

Ran out of ranch dressing but had a dry ranch mix which I used a couple tablespoons mixed with  a 1/4 cup sourcream and 1/4 cup mayo, used 1/2 tsp. salt and 1 tsp sugar and followed the rest of the ingredients exactly. Very good and very tender. This makes a lot of marinade, it probably would work for 7 chicken breasts, I used 5. DH loved too.

These were pretty good.  My husband did not care for the rosemary but I thought it was ok.  Chicken was nice and tender.  I added green and red pepper, zucchini and mushrooms or I think it would have been rather boring.

These were great. I didn't even bother with the cubes on skewers, just marinated chicken breasts and then grilled them - perfect. My 3 yr old son AND my 35 yr old husband liked it! I will use this for pork as well! Thanks for sharing, Theresa!

LOVED IT!!!  I'll be using this recipe for my chicken breast this week. YUMMY!!!  Perfect as is...
I was short on time the first time I made this, so it only marinated for 10 minutes and I didnt have fresh rosemary, but it came out fantastic!  My picky toddler says, "he doesnt like to eat that bird(aka chicken)" but he devoured this meal.  Thank you!!!

This recipe is soo delicious I can't even find the exact right words to describe it. I added it to my weekly meals and just love the flavour. I told my friends about it and they looked at me like "Ranch chicken?, really?" and so I made it for them and they LOVED it and left with the recipe. It's fantastic!

Love, love, love this marinade!!!  I was ready to start eating raw chicken straight out of the bag because it smelled so delicious.  I made this 3 times in the first week that I tried it because my family enjoyed it so much!

So my husband said this was the best chicken he's ever eaten. I am so happy with this recipe. I would not change a thing. I did everything exactly how recipe says. Cooked it on a charcoal grill. It was delicious!

These kabobs are absolutely delicious and moist! I made them last week and my husband wanted them again this week. Even my 3 year old loved them! I followed some recommendations to cut down on salt and oil, and was glad I did. Great recipe!

Delicious! Was super easy and I happened to have all the ingredients on hand. I don't understand why some of the reviewers changed the recipe, it's great just as it is. My hubby LOVED this! It will be going in my recipe box!

I made this recipe exactly as written, and served it in to friends along with garden-fresh corn, tomatoes, summer squash, green beans, and cucumbers. This is a wonderful main dish for summertime when main dishes need to be less filling and they take second place to garden fare. The chicken has a wonderful flavor, and the leftovers were great reheated the next day. I'll definitely make it again, and I'll keep the ingredients on hand for future grilling.

Very good recipe....i didn't make kabobs, but just pounded chicken breasts and marinated them for about an hour.  My husband and I loved the fact that the flavor was there but didn't over power the chicken.  I omitted the salt, I didn't have fresh rosemary, so I used a little more than a teaspoon of dried, I  used light Hidden Valley Ranch and I  reduced the olive oil to 1/4 cup.  I also reduced the Worcestershire sauce to 2 tbsp because I'm not a huge fan of it, as I feel it can also be overpowering at times.  The chicken was very moist and tender.  Will definitely make again.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I prepared this exactly like the recipe except that I used 1/2 Tbsp. of dried rosemary in place of the fresh rosemary. This chicken is FABULOUS! I will definitely make it again.

Gary,Mike and I liked this.  I used chicken breast tenderloins which are thin and sauteed them in a teflon skillet with no extra oil added.  A bit salty so next time leave out.  Definitely needs sugar as this is tart.

This is an amazing recipie, been using it for ALL occasions.  Friends and family constantly request I make it. I follow the recipie almost exactly (I do tend to lessen the oil, omit salt and sugar). I've also marinated prawns in this prior to grilling them on the BBQ - it turns out AMAZING! Espessially if you add a generous amount of Cayene pepper to the marinade (sometimes I sprinkle it on after I skwer them).

I have been on allrecipes.com for years and this is the first recipe that was so good it made me post a review. This recipe is DELICIOUS!! I modified it by making shesh-kebabs with chicken, onion, orange peppers, and yellow peppers. I used branches of rosemary and skewered them the length of the kebabs. Then marinaded the entire shesh-kebab (veges and all) before grilling. Simple, fast, delicious!!

Outstanding. Will make it for company this weekend - second time this week. I'm growing my own rosemary for the first time, which is what sent me looking for rosemary recipes. Major hit with the hubby, who isn't fond of 'green bits' in his food. He's the one who asked for the repeat! I pan sauteed in batches the first time. Will try it with B/S chicken thighs. Will grill this time. Added: hubby asked for this a 3rd time. B/S chicken thighs are fabulous with this.

YUM!!! Made exactly as written minus the rosemary as we are not rosemary fans. THis was the moistest, well seasoned chicken I have ever had. I made one day as kabobs and the next with pounded chicken breasts. No leftovers.....

This is so easy.  The marinade makes the chicken very tender.  It's always a hit with company!  I also add the veggies to the marinade as recommended by others which makes a huge difference.

I actually didn't like these as much as I thought I would after reading the reviews. They just didn't have the flavor I was expecting. Probably won't be making these again.

These were really good and tender! followed the recipe exactly as written except I didn't have fresh rosemary. I didn't tell my hubby what was in the marinade (he hates Ranch) and he loved them.

Easy.  Pretty good, will no doubt try it again.  I wish it had a little more ranch flavor...maybe I'll try some different dressings.

Wow!  I always forget to write reviews, but this was the most AMAZING kabob I have ever had.  Ever.  I love the taste of rosemary, and it needs to be fresh just like the recipe calls for.  I got so many compliments.  Nobody wanted the steak kabobs with a store bought marinade.  I used Wild Coyote ranch from Wal-Mart.  Thanks for an incredible recipe!

Rosemary Ranch Chicken Kabobs: "Rockin' chick kabobs. Tender, ranch-ey, grilled perfect! Love the rosemary." I'd never made a marinade with a creamy dressing before, so I was a little put-off by the unattractive color of it, but wow were the results awesome! (I used my fave, Naturally Fresh Lite Ranch.) I added some zucchini, bell pepper and red onion to the skewers and dribbled what was left of the marinade over them. The chicken was definitely the star of the meal though - truly amazing.

Every once in a while I eat something SO incredibly delicious, I dream about the day when I get to eat it again.  This is one of those recipes.  WOW!  Anyway I decreased the olive oil and salt as some of the other reviews suggested and I was glad I did.  This recipe is PERFECT.

Finally got around to making these and WOW...this is a great recipe!  I didn't use fresh rosemary and I'm sure that would have made them even better, but even so....this was the best grilled chicken I've ever made.  The only thing I may tweak next time is reducing the amount of salt, but a BIG thank you to Theresa for sharing this recipe!

What a great marinade!  I made this just as the recipe called for and it turned out great! the only think I did differently was I marinated for about 5 hours (and that's only b/c I personally don't see the point in marinating for 30 minutes)  I added yellow squash and green papers that were seasoned with olive oil and basil to my skewers.  thanks so much for sharing!  we will be making this often!

This is a true 5 star recipe - outstanding! The flavor is awesome and the chicken came out tender even after my husband grilled the skewers for a bit too long.  We loved them so much we're making them again today and marinating some veggies to grill, too.  I'm thinking I'll mix the leftover veggie marinade (that hasn't touched the chicken) with some extra ranch or even sour cream for a dipping sauce.  Awesome summer recipe that just about anybody would love!

This was very good and I was leary bc I'm not a ranch fan.  I simply tried it bc of the many pos. reviews and thought I need more options for chicken on the grill.  My kids (picky preschoolers) absolutely devoured their chicken and my husband loved it too. I followed the recipe as written since it was the 1st time but did use light ranch dressing as that's what I keep in the house for my kids. Only complaint is silly: threading skewers was kinda gross :)

We liked this, probably a 4.5, I rounded up. I'd have liked a stronger Ranch flavor, so I think in the future I might just make a version of this marinade omitting the dressing and adding a packet of dry ranch seasoning mix to the oil/vinegar/juice marinade. I wedged slices of bell pepper and onion between each piece of meat on the kebabs so that they'd get a little dressing on the veggies too -- very good, thank you!

This was really good! I also added zucchini and potatoes to some of the kabobs. I may add the listed amount of sugar next time, only added a pinch. Would make again!

Did not care for this, as the Ranch taste was way too strong. If I make it again I will use maybe 1/4 of the original Ranch.

Yuummm! These were so good! Marinated red peppers, onions, and mushrooms in a separate bowl of marinade for 30 mins and turned out great! Very messy but worth it! Served over brown rice.

This recipe is FANTASTIC! I made this for our group freeze-ahead dinner club & put the marinade & 4 chix breasts in a freezer bag in the freezer until we were ready to use them, thawed & then grilled them.  EVERYONE (8 families) loved them!

Made this last night for dinner, was a HUGE hit! Will make it again soon. After marinading for 2 hours I spread out onto a large casserole dish and bake at 450 for 30 mins (or until chicken is fully cooked).

I made this for a dinner party and everyone raved about it.  The chicken was extremely tender and the flavor was delicious.  I followed the recipe exactly except substituted white wine vinegar for the white and marinated for about 3 hours.  The vegetable kabobs marinated the same way were just as good.

I didn't have time to fool with kabobs, so I doubled the marinade and BAKED the cubed chicken in it at 350F for about 30min. The results were great, so I'll assume that the grilled version is even better!

We absolutely love this...We've served this for fancy schmancy dinner parties and everyone raved over it....Don't change anything on the ingredients....I have used red wine vinegar or balsamic when I didn't have white vinegar...Also, I've made these w/o the kabobs by just pounding the breasts to even thinness and then marinating and grilling...Just perfect!!! Perfect for company!

This recipe is amazing!!! I don't make kabobs with them, instead using whole boneless, skinless breasts. I've also made this up all in a ziploc bag, put in the chicken then put in the freezer. It marinades as it thaws and I don't have a mess next time I want it!!!! I recommend it to everyone, especially those who love ranch :D

Not sure what went wrong with these, but I followed the recipe to a tee and they didn't turn out good at all.  I am a vegetarian so i didn't get to taste them, but was told they were dry and the flavor wasn't too good... even though I used good quality, fresh (not previously frozen) chicken breast.

Terrific recipe - a definite keeper.  I made the recipe exactly as written with the exception of not adding any salt.  I marinated it for 2 1/2 hours but wish I had marinated it longer because we loved the excellent flavor.  I'll be using this recipe many times.  Added note: my daughter came over and had the leftovers on salad.  She loved it and immediately ask for the recipe - and she doesn't like chicken.  Thanks for sharing!

I didn't have ranch dressing, but had a ranch dressing dry packet, so I used that instead of ranch dressing from a bottle.  Followed the rest of the recipe exactly and we loved it!  I will definately be making this again!

Pretty good. I didn't have a grill though, so I cooked it in the juice on the stove. Doesn't need the salt. I forgot the lemon juice and didn't add the sugar.. but I think I should've used both. Cut down on the oil though.

WOW! These kabobs are so melt in your mouth tender I would give them 10 stars if I could. I use rosemary from my garden and my like to go a little heavy on it, but I mince it up really fine. My husband prefers ranch bacon dressing on his salad, so that's what we have on hand and use. I did omit the salt since ranch dressing always seems to have quite a bit in it anyway. It's a pretty foolproof recipe. I have even prepared and froze a bunch ahead of time and grilled them the second night of camping.

Loved this recipes.  Used more sugar since I know my family likes things on the sweet side.  Also used orange juice (fresh squeezed) since I didn't have any lemon.  Cut up some potatoes and threw it in with the marinade because there was plenty.  Then I baked it all instead of kabobs.  Fantastic!  Will definitely do again.

We baked this and it came out pretty good. Problem was, the chicken didn't soak up enough flavor (chicken was watery), and it wasn't salty enough for me. Another reason for 4 stars? Worcestershire sauce is hard to come by in my opinon, so I subbed it with soy sauce. That could have affected the result by a lot...and probably not in the best way. Perhaps the chicken not tasting perfect like everyone says it does is my fault, but I like foolproof recipes. This recipe wasn't very forgiving.

The only things I did differently were to add some potatoes to the marinade (since there was plenty of marinade) and I broiled my skewers instead of grilled.  My whole family loved it!  My husband suggested next time I add some cubed onions.  Very yummy flavor!

Update: I did this recentlyin my own oven..still delish!! Previously, i tried over the fire..it didn't come out that well..i'll definitely stick to the oven.  Wow!! Excellant recipe!!    I made it with Ranch Dressing II for dinner last night at my MIL's place - dinner with hubby & MIL.  I didn't make kabobs but whole breast meat instad. I didn't exactly follow the measurement - just went along with my instinct/ tastebud. I added on about half of the salt and didn't add on the sugar.  Then I put in the oven to grill...totally awesome! It was so tender and we even scooped out the sauce from the pan.  Even my 13mth old son loves it!    I'm going to try again this week for my parents but since they don't have an oven, i'm gonna cook it in the grill pan over the fire stove.

Wonderful!  I made these last night for my family and they loved, loved, loved them!  I didn't have fresh rosemary, so I used 1 1/2 tsp of dried rosemary leaves which I crushed in my hand, but otherwise kept to the recipe.  They were so moist and flavorful.  My husband declared the chicken as his new favorite.  We took the chunks of chicken off the skewers and tossed them in our salad.  I will definitely make again.

Very good recipe!  I made it for my girlfriend and she was shocked at my sophistication :)  It is a bit salty though, so maybe remove that step or buy the reduced sodium worchestershire.  All-round hit though.

These are terrific!  I've made them twice and I have not been disappointed.  However the 2nd time I made the mistake of marinating overnight and they were too salty - I would not recommend this.  I also do them in a grill pan on the stove and this works great.  Enjoy!!

I wouldn't have made this recipe if it wasn't for the high star rating.  I'm glad I did, the whole family loved it.  The rosemary flavor is amazing.  It is super easy to make.  I made no changes to the recipe.  We put the chicken and marinade in a ziplock bag until we are ready to eat.  Then we put together the kabobs and grill.

WOW!!! This chicken was so fabulous! My family loved it and so easy. I marinated it for a few hours and ended up baking it in the oven as another reviewer had done as well, with all the marinade. I can't wait to grill it. This is a new favorite for sure. I can't wait to make it for friends and family.

This was a really good recipe overall. I didn't care too much for the strong rosemary taste but no one else agreed with me. I made the kabobs then skewered a sliced of french bread on each kabob. Everyone enjoyed them. No leftovers at all. I think next time I may use less rosemary and maybe add some homemade BBQ sauce. That sounds yummy. The chicken was SO tender and moist.

These were fantastic! I do recommend a longer marinating time though...the longer they marinated, the better they got. I don't have a grill so I baked these as some other reviewers suggested. My husband LOVED these and said that I need to make them regularly...which is saying a lot because he's Mr.Picky! Thanks for an awesome recipe :)

So very moist and delicious! The marinade works great over rice and veggies, too. I did NOT use the sugar and DID use low-fat ranch dressing. This dish will be made again and again! LOVED IT!

This is a great recipe! I did as another reviewer said and baked it 25 minutes on 450 in the oven. It was a little boring tasting but this was such an easy fix! When it was done all I did was sprinkle some lemon pepper over all the kabobs and it brought the flavor out perfectly! One more thing is that I added bell peppers to the kabobs which was real good. Thanks for the recipe!

Love these! So did my husband! My 3 year wasn't a big fan but rosemary might be too much for him. I added more lemon juice and vinegar, 1 tsp seems like nothing. I added juice from half a lemon and 1 Tb of vinegar. I have made a lot of recipes from this sight and most are OK at best but this one was awesome!

Terrific recipe.  I broiled the chicken with red bell pepper and potato slices in the marinade, then skewered.  Fantastic flavor.  My wife hates ranch dressing, but she loved this, we'll definitely be making this again.

Three and a half stars. Terrific flavor, but far too salty, and I didn't use all the recommended amount. I ended up with a significant amount of excess marinade as well, so the measurements could be cut back.

This is an excellent recipe. The only changes I made to the ingredients was that I used half a packet of ranch dressing mix and 1/4 cup of sour cream in place of bottled ranch dressing, and I used apple cider vinegar instead of white vinegar. As for preparation, I did not grill kabobs but instead baked the breasts whole. I poured the marinade over the chicken and covered the pan with foil, and baked at 350 degrees F for 30 minutes with the foil cover off during the last ten minutes of cooking. The marinade made an excellent sauce. My husband was still talking about how delicious this chicken was when we went to bed! I will definitely make this again and will absolutely try them grilled.

I don't feel I can rate this chicken because I cooked it in the sauce without marinating it since  I was short on time, so the sauce was good on the chicken but the flavor wasn't cooked in. However, I followed the advice to use white rice as a side for the sauce--so good! I used jasmine rice from my rice cooker. Would totally recommend it on the rice! I only used 1/2 the amount of oil--and had no olive oil so i used vegtable oil and it still turned out great!

This recpe was FANTASTIC!!!  I followed the recipe exactly, but instead of doing just chicken, I added some veggies to the marinade as well!  Whether you do just the chicken, or add green peppers, mushrooms and onion like I did, you are getting an easy recipe that is fresh, light and delicious!!!!

I sandwiched red pepper between the chicken chunks on the skewers, and used some cut up steak I happened to have in the freezer as well. I must say, the chicken tasted a lot better with the flavors than the beef did. I had so much left over, so i kept it in the fridge to marinade for a day or two, and holy smokes was it delicious. I basically dumped the entire contents of my marinade bowl (chicken chunks and an excessive amount of ranch marinade) on a tin foil lined baking tray, and cooked it at 3:50 for 20 minutes. It turned out beautifully, and was wonderful on rice. Definitely an easier and saucier alternative to the skewers.

This was wonderful!! Chicken was moist, not dry and VERY flavorful. I didn't want to buy fresh rosemary so I used less of the dried spice kind. We will use this as our go-to marinade from now on.

These kebobs were delish!!  I am new to grilling, and wanted an easy winner chicken dish.  This got rave reviews from my hubby and father.  I only had balsamic vinegar, which worked fine.  And substituted BBQ sauce for Worcestershire sauce (I have never owned that stuff!).  Anyway, these are so so so good  :)

My husband and I enjoyed this. We had cut the chicken into thick strips and ate it as an appetizer.  We dipped it with our favorite wing sauce. Yum! I had made the ranch dressing using ranch dips mix/sour cream and used lemon pepper b/c I was out of lemon. Next time, we will use dark meat. I'm not really a fan of white meat.

this was by far one of the few my entire family gobbled up and looked for more!  This will go into the gotta have again lists.  One extra layer of flavor is to soak the skewers in Rosemary water!  YUMMY... wouldnt change another thing

This was delicious! I added a little bit more ranch dressing but that was all it needed to amaze me. This went extremely well with garlicky, spicy and sesamey green beans and baked vegetables (potatoes, carrots, onions). This recipe will surely make its way into my personal cookbook.

Sometimes it is hard to find a recipe to give boneless, skinless chicken breasts a lot of flavor without drying them out.  This is one of those recipes.  I skewered the chicken with onion and cubanelle pepper pieces and grilled them.  I absolutely loved the flavor and will try baking them in the oven next so I can use the drippings to serve over rice.

These chicken kabobs, exactly as the receipe is written, were outstanding and oh so easy!  (I did reduce the salt to 1 tsp. based on other reviewers.)These were on the table in 45 minutes . Am definitley volunteering to bring the entree to the next concert in the park !  Thanks for sharing.

Revising my original 4 star review to make it 5! This was great! I doubled the sauce (but only used 1/2 cup oil) and marinated the chicken in it for about 30 hours in the fridge. I used some of the sauce to marinate veggies separately (GP, onion, zucchini, & potatoes), and reserved about a cup of it to brush on the kabobs as they were cooking. I used Nikkib's advice about potatoes, and after I microwaved them I marinated them for about 1 hour with the rest of the veggies. Will make again!

OMG! This is absolutely amazing! I followed the recipe (except reduced salt by 1/2 tsp) and it turned out delicious! I also marinated onions, peppers (red, green & yellow), sections of asparagus, mushrooms, and baby red potatoes with the chicken, and then made the kabobs. My grill was running out of gas, so it took about 30 to cook (so it was really low heat), but I would be tempted to slow cook them again. Loved the baby red potatoes with it. Made up some white rice by using chicken broth instead of water, and then set the kabobs on the rice right off the grill, to season the rice. I also had put the remainder of the marinade on some foil on the grill just to cook it, and then poured that over the kabobs and rice. Holy smokes. :) So good! Packed with flavor and tenderness. Better than anything you can get in a restaurant. THIS IS PROBABLY MY FAVORITE MEAL NOW! FABULOUS!!!

Soooooooooo good!! I didn't change a thing. My 1 year old loved it and so did the rest of the family, including my husband who isn't fond of chicken. You have to try this!

Very tasty! Made this tonight, but didn't use skewers. I lined a broiler pan with foil, then I marinated veggies with the cubed chicken (Baby Bella Button Mushrooms, Red Onion and Green Pepper chunks and Cherry Tomatoes) for 1 1/2 hours then put all in the pan and placed on a high heat grill for about 25 minutes, stirring every 5 minutes or so. Served over white rice that I make using chicken broth instead of water and season with parsley, garlic & onion powder and white ground pepper. I also added garlic & onion powder, white ground pepper and Island Breeze seasoned salt to the marinade (omitted the white salt). The chicken and veggies cooked well this way and had that grilled flavor even though they never really touched the grates! Hubby loved it! Will go on my dinner rotation. Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe was so good and easy to make!  In an effort to be more healthy, we used Fat Free Ranch Dressing and 1/8 cup of olive oil.  We doubled the rosemary.  Very tasty!  We will definitely make again.

I followed the recipe but added sweet onions and bell peppers to the kabobs and put them on the grill on a low temp.  They turned out great!  I love the flavor of fresh Rosemary and these tasted wonderful.  I will be making these often during the grilling season and want to try the sauce on rice as others recommend.  Good Recipe!

Fabulous!  I made this just as the recipe directed with the exception of dried rosemary since I didn't have any fresh.  I wouldn't change a thing.  The chicken was so tender and flavourful.  I'm looking forward to using this marinade for chicken burgers.

This was delicious.  My husband is pretty  picky about grilled chicken and he loved this resipe.  The only thing I changed was that I used thin cut chicken breast cutlets and not kabobs.

This was really good, but could have been a tad more flavorful (for me). However, my husband loved it! Very easy to prepare, but extremely messy. The rosemary and ranch gave it a nice flavor, but I just could have used a bit more 'oomph'.

I have already reviewed this recipe as written and we LOVE it, but last night I wanted a little bit of a kick, so I added about a tablespoon of the liquid from a jar of jalapenos (and omitted the vinegar since the liquid is mostly vinegar) and it was SOOO GOOD!  Nice if you want a little bit of heat to it.

I made these for our Memorial Day BBQ on Sunday.  I doubled the recipe and let the chicken marinate overnight.  The only thing I did differently was cook them on the grill in an aluminum tray as I didn't have enough skewers.  These were a huge hit!  Everyone loved and raved about this chicken and I got a request for the recipe the next day!  Will definitely make this all summer, thank you!

Delicious!  I made it easy on myself and cut the chicken into strips instead of cubes for chicken sticks.  I also omitted the salt and it was plenty salty for our tastes.  Even yummy cold the next day, Thanks!

Yum! Yum! Yum!  This was really good!  I did use a little less oil.  Also, I forgot to save a little marinade for basting so next time I will do that.  I made my kabobs with zucchini, onions and bell peppers.  My husband loved it!

I have gotten chicken kabobs from out meat market before and was not impressed with the flavor of the marinade.  This however were excellent! Made it exactly as it was written. I let it marinate for a few hours and the chicken had allot of flavor! Next time I will let it sit over night. I served it with rice pilaf and grilled vegis.

I've tried this a couple ways - I've pan fried as the recipe recommends and I've also thrown the chicken and the marinade in a wok and cooked it in the sauce. There was lots left over and you can serve over rice or pasta. The grilled version is great on salad. Delish.

Very good!  I followed the recipe, but used lime juice instead of lemon (I didn't have lemon) and dried rosemary instead of fresh.  Next time, I'll buy some fresh rosemary because I'm sure it's better!  The chicken was very flavorful and tender.  The whole family liked it, which is saying a lot!!

Absolutely delicious!  I cut back on the salt after reading reviews and it was just perfect.  I put this together in the morning and my husband grilled it the same evening, so it marinated for about 8 hours.  It was so tender, juicy and flavorful!  We served this at a party and people couldn't seem to get enough.  We made twice as many skewers as we thought we would need and they all disappeared.  This was a HUGE hit!  We'll make this recipe often from now on.

The combo of the lemon juice and vinegar was too strong for our family.  We will try again with less or just omit one.  Did toss some of the mixture with some potatoes as others have suggested with less than stellar results-I ended up throwing the potatoes in a pan to fry and they were much better.

so good! I just used chicken breasts instead of chopping and doing kabobs. It was great!!! Very good with baked sweet potatoes as a side.

I made this exactly how it was written and we absolutely loved it.  The only thing different was that I let it marinade for 3 hours before placing it on the grill.  I wouldn't change a thing (only because I'm not a good improviser).  I served it with some white wine-flavored wild/white rice blend (something that I did improvise on AND it actually worked).  We had a fabulous dinner!  So, so good.  Can't wait to make it again.   PS...made it my gas grill and I personally did not have a problem with flare ups from the olive oil/ranch sauce dripping.

I was a little apprehensive because I'm not a huge Ranch person, but these are amazing! I sent the link to this recipe to all my friends and family out and told them they had to make it.  At home we can't get enough and it immediately became one of our regulars.  I did make 4 small changes: I used an indoor grill,  reduced the oil by 1/2,  used white wine vinegar, omitted the optional sugar.  Once again, this recipe is superb!

Pretty good as a baked dish (450F oven, for 25 minutes, cooked in a Pyrex dish). Was planning on making it on the grill but the weather turned bad, so I will try again some other time on the grill - I bet it would be better. I followed the directions as written, but used Hidden Valley Light ranch dressing instead of regular, and cut back on some of the oil (didn't miss it). It does taste a bit of convenience / shortcut food, but the fresh rosemary helps with that, so don't skip it unless necessary. Served over Jasmine rice with roasted asparagus.

Hubby liked these. They were easy to make and I had all of thee ingredients on hand, except for vinegar. But he doesn't like vinegar, so it worked out. I would like to make these again. I put them on a grill in the oven, set at 375 degrees for about 15 -20 minutes. I also made sure to turn them every 5 minutes or so.

Fantastic recipe!  My entire family LOVED it!  We have made it many times and here are a few of our misadventures.  Don't over marinade!  30 minutes is all you need the texture of the chicken will change if you go too long (from the acidity of the lemon I think).  Fresh rosemary is the only way to go...it tastes completely different with dried rosemary.  We forgot fresh one time and were very disappointed with the dried version.  For some reason the way to get the best taste is on the BBQ, we tried other ways of making it and it was not as good.  Don't mess with the original recipe, it is really awesome the way it is!

nothing to rave about, but not bad at all. I cut the oil a little and only put in 1/2 tsp sugar. Also I didn't have white vinegar (maybe that would have made it better?), so added extra lemon with orange juice. I'd make it again sometime, but I'm inspired to make a chicken dish with orange juice as the main ingred. now! Anyway, I put a slice of red, green, and yellow pepper on each kabob with the chkn, had a little baked potato with greek seasoning on it, and a salad. A nice "light-ish" supper.

Excellent marinade for both chicken and veggies. We just cooked the breasts whole and then ate the veggies on the side rather than skewering all of it (saves time). We did red peppers, purple onions and cherry tomatoes but the tomatoes got mushy. Maybe squash next time?

Half the oil,  I used white wine vinegar (all I had) and baked this dish with red bell peppers and red onions. Served it over brown rice.  Very tasty, will make again.

Okay, but not that great.  I tried one reviewers suggestion to do it in the oven so that all the juice could be used, and put over rice.  I did, but didn't find it anything exceptional. Might be better on the grill, but.............

I tried this recipe for a family BBQ this past Summer, and it was the first thing to be eaten up! The only problem I had was that I used a little too much marinade and it dripped all over the grill, so be careful in how much you use! Very tasty and juicy!

Instead of kabobs I cook this in a 9x13 baking dish with chopped green peppers and onion and bake it with the marinade (plus about 1T cornstarch). Serve over rice. Great for a crowd or just a quick family dinner.

I've made these on the grill and loved them. Last night I made them but our grill was out of commission so I threw them in the oven. Because I wanted to maximize the flavor with the chicken (esp with the mushrooms and onions I added to the kabobs)I cooked them in the sauce itself. Placing the kabobs in a shallow pan and cooking them 1st loosley covered at 350. Then taking the cover off to bake in the flavor. Rave reviews from everyone (even the 2 year old).

Didn't kabob them. Also, I used dried rosemary and I added too much apparently, but they were still good. I'm positive they will be great if I use fresh or a smaller amount of dried rosemary. Tender and juicy!

These were so tender and tasty!  I'm glad the sugar was optional, because I unintentionally left it out.  We used the baked method, 450 degrees for about 15 minutes, which worked well.  Even my picky child ate them!

omg was this the bomb! Made this one night because it sounded easy, fast and with ingredients on hand and am I ever glad I did.  I used chicken breasts and didn't make them into kabobs but kept the rest as is.  So, between me, hubby and 10 yr. old son, we all loved this marinade so much!  I seriously will make this often and that's saying a lot since we all know how many recipes are out there for chicken.  The BEST flavor that you literally taste on the meat...mmmm mmm so good!thanks for sharing!

I omitted the rosemary as a) I'm not a huge fan, and b) I didn't want to buy an entire package when I was only using it for one recipe. Even without the rosemary, the meat turned out amazingly tasty and flavorful. I marinated the chicken for about 24 hours, threaded the cubes onto skewers, and cooked it on my Foreman grill. I served it in warm pitas with lettuce, tomato and onion, with a little more Ranch dressing. Absolutely delicious!! I'll definitely be making this again. Thanks so much, Theresa!

i followe the reviews and make this in the oven.  I cut the chicken into bit size pieces and baked at 350 for 25 mins.  I served it over brown rice and drizzled with extra marinade.  I also didn't have ranch and used cesear drg (light).  was ok-but would have used less.

Really simple recipe. I marinated two chicken breasts with the original amount of marinade. I left in the fridge over night and baked them in the oven. Came out delicious. The chicken was moist and tender.

These were really good.  They actually have a good after taste too. I love rosemary because a little goes such a long way.  I didn't change anything, but like other reviewers, I may just cut down on the salt a bit.

This was fantastic!  My 2 yr old even liked it! I used 1/2 the amount of dried rosemary, but everything else was as the recipe called for!

Excellent, one of the better chicken marinades on this site.  You don't need to mod this recipe.  Best when: Grilled over hardwood fire, using fresh rosemary.  Cautions: Easy to overcook the chicken.

Really great recipe! Keeps the chicken from drying out, and it's perfect just the way it is written. It may seem a little over salty before hand, but it doesn't keep the salty flavor afterward at all. Got great praise. c:

I made these for my boyfriend last night and he said it was "the best meal I made all summer".  I also marinated green peppers, red peppers and onions and added them to the skewers--delicious!!

This was sooo good.  I marinated the chicken for 1 hour, and I decreased the amount of salt to 1/2 teaspoon.  It could have used a tiny bit more salt, but I feel that 2 teaspoons would have been way too much.  The sugar was a little lagniappe that I felt was a very nice, subtle addition to the recipe.  I grilled the skewers for ~9 minutes on a grill preheated to 400 degrees, turning occasionally.  The chicken came out very juicy and tender.  Next time, I might try a different herb to see how the flavor compares...oregano, thyme, cilantro.  Mmmm, they all sound great.

Absolutely delicious!! Very moist and tasty.  I marinated them for four hours then put the kabobs on the gas grill.  I only had three breasts but followed the recipe exactly and made the entire amount of sauce and glad I did.  I kept some of it back for dipping and everyone loved the extra sauce.  My young grandsons who do not care for chicken ate their whole kabob.  When I asked one of them how they would rate it on a scale of 1-10, he said "infinity"!  The only change I would make the next time is to add only l tea. of salt.  Will definitely make again.

This is a great marinade and sauce recipe. I made double and reserved half to pour over after grilling. Next time I will half the salt, but will definitely make again. I mixed 1/4 cup of the left over sauce into turkey burgers the next day and this added great flavor as well as making them very moist.

So yummy! I omitted the salt and sugar, because I felt like it was probably ok without those 2 things. I marinated thighs for about 7 hours, we made skewers with red onion, red bell peppers and the chicken...they were so tender and flavorful. Great go to recipe for the bbq.

We made this for some friends last night.  This was excellent. Marinaded our veggies at the same time (onion, peppers, mushrooms, yellow squash) and add it all to the skewers then grilled on foil (which helped keep the flavor in).  This will definitely be on our regular meal plan from now on.

5 stars - I loved this recipe!  I had a package of 4 chix breasts and all the ingredients for the marinade.  I chopped fresh rosemary like it called for and it was the perfect hint of flavor.  The vinegar definite helps keep the chicken breast moist, so don't leave it out. Cider vinegar would also work...  For a side, I made stir fried green beans with bacon bits and red onion.  This was a great low-carb meal... next time I will use fat-free ranch dressing!

Very good. I made these the first time for a 10th anniversary BBQ. They were a huge hit. They smell great while cooking and I was pleasantly surprised that the white meat didn't dry out at all, was very tender. Great recipe for adults and kids alike. Marinated for 6 hours, and got multiple requests for the recipe. Will make again.

Not as much flavor as I expected - could not taste any ranch at all.  Not a bad recipe, but not necessarily worth the prep time.

This has become my household's favorite go-to meal! I love that the chicken is always moist, and you can adjust the rosemary to your particular tastes. Thanks for sharing! Just one caution: If using wooden skewers, soak them for at least 30 minutes  so they don't burn up on the grill!

I made this last night for a BBQ and it was amazing.  I left the chicken breast whole and put it on the BBQ in a veggie basket lined with foil.  It cooked in the marinade and then I tossed it on the grill for 30 second for char marks.  Thanks so much Theresa...this will be what I use on chicken for years to come.

The only changes I made were to bake and to use dried rosemary rather than fresh. The flavor was very strong, so if I make this again I will use less rosemary. I served this over rice. The chicken was very moist..but my most picky eater wasn't begging for the last piece, sorry.

I cut boneless, skinless, chicken breasts into three strips, marinated them, and then cooked them on the grill.  My family loved them and couldn't quit eating them.

I made this for some friends and they all loved it. I cannot vouge as I am a veg-head. They devoured them all! I give 4 stars because I don't give a 5 too easily, and I asked what could possibly make them better and one friend suggested marinating them longer. I did marinate for a couple of hours, not the 30 minutes suggested.

I thought this chicken was awesome!  Fabulous marinade.  I didn't do this as kabobs, just some chicken breasts.  But I probably would do the kabobs the next time and marinade some vegetables for the kabobs also. I think the key to this recipe is you have to grill the meat.  I read some other reviews and it seems like the people who baked the chicken did not like it as well.  I think the grilling method really kicks up the chicken flavor and marinade a notch!  I am planning to make this the next time I entertain.  I think people would be surprised whats all in the marinade.  I wasn't expecting such a huge flavor from the ranch dressing!

This was excellent.  It was so good, I made it twice this weekend.  I marinated the chicken overnight and it was full of flavor and very moist.  Thank you

just delish!! you'd be surprised how flavorful the chicken turns out. I would cut back on the rosemary just a tad and the salt or worchestire sauce, but otherwise... YUM!

Absolutely Incredible Recipe. Followed the recipe to the letter for the marinade, except for marinading for 4 hours. I made an extra batch of marinade to use while cooking and for dipping. It turned out great, and it was a hit at the party.   Recommendations/Changes: - Double the sauce recipe when marinating. - I added a bit of garlic which went well with the rosemary. - I also used cracked peppercorn ranch dressing which also added a nice touch.

Wonderful flavor.  I marinated for 1 1/2 days (due to illness in our house) and they were so moist & flavorful.  My only change was to leave as whole chicken breasts instead of kabobs.  Thanks!

Absolutely FANTASTIC! These really made our 4th of July meal extra special. I opted to marinate them overnight and I'm glad I did. They were so flavorful, moist and tender. Hubby is already asking when I'll be making them again, so they are a definate keeper! Thanks for posting. :)

The marinade in this recipe is quite excellent. Very flavorful, although for some reason I didn't get much of a ranch taste in the chicken. Nevertheless, the chicken still tasted great off the grill. Next time I might marinade the chicken overnight to see if that changes the flavor.

This is FANTASTIC!  We just finished dinner and everyone raved about it...even the veggie haters. The flavor is TO DIE FOR! After reading other reviews, I doubled the marinade and used half for the chicken and the other half for zucchini, mushrooms and red potatoes.  I quartered the potatoes and microwaved them as another reviewer suggested before tossing them into the marinade.  Two hours later, everything went onto skewers and then into the oven at 425 degrees for about 20 minutes.  Everyone raved!  And, the pan juices were great drizzled over the chicken, vegetables and rice.  A definite keeper!!

WOW!!! This was AMAZING!!! My bf is not a big chicken eater but he could not get enough.. nor could our kids age 4,5 and 6.  He said this was the best thing i have ever made him, that i REALLY impressed him, and that it tasted like a $12 restraunt meal.  I dont think it could get a better review than that! Made with seperate vegi kabobs, basted in asiago italian dressing.

Made this for the first time last night.  Picky kids thought it was "okay", but DH (who is just happy whenever I cook) and I thought it was good.  Would recommend a longer marinade time!  Did have good time with 2nd daughter assembling the kabobs.  First time making kabobs - it was easy to make and easy to serve!

very yummy! We grilled the marinated breasts vs. kabobs. Also, as another reviewer suggested, grilled gr/red peppers and onion in a foil pan. after the breasts were cooked we put them in pan with veggies and their juices. Served with egg noodles. Chicken was perfect, didn't change a thing w/ the recipe.

I made this as directed except I marinated the chicken breasts for 5 hours in the fridge and baked in the oven for 25 minutes at 400 F.  Very moist and tender, the family loved it.  A nice simple and tasty recipe for dinner!

I had no Ranch dressing, but Creamy Italian dressing. Usually we have the outdoor grill going, but a rainy day, so I used the Cuisinart Griddler, which I hardly ever use.  I kept to the recipe, except using the Italian dressing, no salt. Prepped chicken thighs, cut up, to marinate for 4 hours.  Put on skewers and grilled.  OH MY.  How nice.  I will be serving these again and again!

This was delicious! I loved the ranch/worchestershire flavor. I made it using yogurt instead of oil to make it more like a sauce than a marinade. I skewered it and broiled it for about 7 minutes on 550 and it was perfectly moist and tender! Wonderful recipe I will make again!

Very good recipe, my husband grilled them, but we didnt make it into kabobs. I also wanted him to cook them in the sauce on the grill in tinfoil but he forgot. I made extra sauce to eat with it and and everyone loved it... I will definately make them again.

These are super moist & delicious! Even picky DH devoured them.  Omitted the salt & used dried rosemary.  Like others I marinated Vidalia onion, green, & red,   bell pepper pieces & threaded them along with chicken onto wooden skewers. (Tip: Soak skewers in water 1/2 hr. or so to prevent burning.)

This was a monster hit with my group of friend and is in the "We want this again" list. I cant wait to be trying it on the field soon. I followed the ingredient suggestions but prepared this on a camping grill so rather than relying on timing, I removed the kabobs as each skewer reached 165 internal temp. Very juicy and full of flavor.

This recipe has become a favorite in our house.  It always turns out tender and tasty, and is so easy to make with basic ingredients.  I typically decrease the salt and sugar by half due to personal preference.  Leftovers make a delicious chicken salad.

My teenagers loved this recipe.  One said, "Mom, if you made chicken like this everytime I would be so happy." Now that's a THANK YOU!   I didn't bother making kabobs - just put the chicken tenders directly on the grill.  I also marinated some shrimp and grilled them up too.  Really good!

I made this dish for my husband at the last minute the other night and oh my goodness was it ever good.  I marinated for about an hour and then grilled the chicken for approximately 15 minutes.

Very Good!  I cooked these on my stovetop grill pan.  I covered the pan with alum. foil to prevent the marinade from burning then removed the foil at the end to get the grill marks on them.  My very picky kids loved them!  I'll hold on to this recipe

The best chicken I think I have ever had. I thought this was awesome. Did not change the recipe at all! It was a huge hit and a keeper.

very good, very tender and flavor.  I would omit the salt next time, too salty and I love salt.

Great contrast in this recipe! The lemon & vinegar was a great addition. I used the same marinate for both chicken & pork. I honestly prefer this marinade for the pork.

So good!  I made them exactly like the recipe calls for.  I was worried that the ranch would be too overpowering, but it was perfect.  The fresh rosemary was great.  I saved about 1/4 cup of the marinade before putting the meat in, and used it at the end to drizzle over the cooked kabobs.  Served with jasmine rice and grilled asparagus- perfect quick, easy, and flavorful dinner to make on a weeknight.

These were good.  I didn't follow the instructions and grill them, instead I baked them at 425 for 15 minutes.  I will most likely make these again, but next time I'll grill them.

This had a really good flavor. I may have cooked them a bit long as mine were kind of dry. I will make these again, but I'll be sure to watch the cooking time.

EXCELLENT!!!  I threaded the kabobs with mushrooms, red bell pepper, and pearl onions.  Served it over brown rice.  My 8 year old told me the next AM, dinner sure was good last night!  This recipe is a keeper

I thought these were pretty good.  Very juicy and flavorful!  My kids didn't like them as much as I thought they would.  I think it was the rosemary that they didnt like.  Next time I will marinate some without the rosemary for the kiddos but very delicious!

This was the best-reviewed cookout recipe I've ever made.  The flavor is assertive, but not crazy-overpowering.  I consider 30 minutes to be the MINIMUM time to marinate; going longer was a good thing to do.

I admit, I did change the recipe a bit but it still turned out good.  I only had a whole chicken (instead of BLSL chicken) that I marinated and then stuck in the over for a few hours.  The flavors probably weren't as strong, but I am anxious to try it as the recipe states.  It smelled great as it was cooking!

These were OK.  I marinated them longer to get more flavor in the chicken, but it was still lacking something.  These just weren't my taste.  The flavors did not seem to mix well.

These are really awesome! I made these one night for my boyfriend, just to try them and they were sooo good. I didn't put the rosemary in it however, because I'm new to 'cooking' except for what I already know how to cook, but it was really good all together. I added bellpeppers and onions to the kabobs before I grilled them and it just added to the flavor! Most definitely recommened!!

These are wonderfully, melt in your mouth delicious!  The only variation I made was leaving out the tiny amount of sugar - it just sounded weird to me.  Even my  husband who claims to "hate" ranch dressing raved over the finished product.  We've made it lots of times and is definitely a summertime grilling favorite in our home.

These were excellent...very, very flavorful...almost too much, but not quite.  I used half as much olive oil and dried rosemary...I will be sure to use fresh next time.  I threaded the chicken kabobs with chunks of vidalia onion and baby bella mushrooms.  The onions and mushrooms just popped with flavor since I gave them a quick coat of the marinade.  Those were the best part for me!

These were a hit at my BBQ last night.  Everyone gobbled them up! I only added 1 tsp of salt, completely left out the sugar, and marinated them for over two hours. I used chicken tenders instead of cutting chicken breasts into cubes. I weaved the tenders onto skewers without cutting them. I then placed them on the grill for 10 minutes, turning them once. They were absolutely delicious.  Many of my guests asked for the recipe. I will make these again for sure!

First of all this chicken is great hot in a wrap or even cold in a packed lunch. You can serve this so many ways. When I make sandwiches I leave the chicken breasts whole and add ranch dressing on the top. For the wraps I actually shred the chicken after cooking it in the skillet. This is great when it is cooked on the grill or on the stovetop.

I followed the recipe exactly but marinated the chicken for about 6 hours.  A definite keeper!

Excellent.  The flavor is mild enough, even the kids loved these!  I marinated the chicken for several hours and I also substitued 1 1/2 tsps. dried Rosemary.  Thank you for the recipe.

These are so incredibly good!! Other than adding bell peppers to the skewers, I followed this recipe to the T and would not change a thing! This marinade is so different than any other kind that I've used before, and I can't wait to grill these again the next time we entertain!

We tried these on the grill & my husband & mother-in-law loved them (as did I).  Our friend who usually doesn't like chicken on the grill (ie, chicken slathered in BBT sauce) was enchanted as well.  Delightful flavor & super easy.  Fresh rosemary really makes them pop.  A keeper at our house!

We loved this chicken & marinated mushrooms & Vidalia onions also. I cut back the Worcestershire sauce to 1 T. and the sugar in half. PERFECT! Also, I didn't want to take the time for kabobs, so I sliced 6 breasts in half lengthwise, and grilled them in strips. The extra marinade was boiled stovetop & tossed with boiled red potatoes. Thanks for a great dish!

These are VERY tender. I think I marinated for 20-25 mins. I used 4 chicken breasts with LOTS of marinade left over. I only used 1 teaspoon of salt, anything more would have been salty. The flavor was good, next time I'll try with homemade ranch.

I left out the salt (didn't feel it needed it), used red-wine vinegar and two packages of equal for the sugar and also light ranch dressing.  Great marinade - let it sit for about 45 minutes and used an indoor stove-top grill.  Very tender chicken.  Thanks for the recipe.

Like everyone else said > this is easily the moistest chicken we've ever had.  I left the chicken breasts whole and grilled that way.  (Just didn't have time to make kabobs, is all.)  Will make this one again!

The marinade smelled great, the aroma from the grill was mouth watering, but we did not like the kabobs.  Very bland even with added onions and peppers.  Will not make this again.

I didn't find this all that tasty.  I used organic ranch but I must face the fact that I just don't like ranch dressing at all.  There were leftovers so I served my boys the cold chicken over iceberg lettuce for lunch.  I had a grilled cheese.

I think this is one of the first recipes I've ever actually followed as is (minus black pepper).  The 4 other people that ate these must have said at least 4-5 times each how great they were and how much they liked them.  It was my first time eating rosemary and it has kind of a pine taste to me.  I'll keep trying and see if it grows on me!  These are def a keeper!  TY for a great recipe!

What a simple yet AMAZING marinade! I used all the ingredients with the exception of the rosemary (which I had none of and replaced with Mrs. Dash Garlic and Herb seasoning) and the white vinegar (which I replaced with Red wine vinegar infused with garlic.) I marinated them for 3-4 hours and I think that made them so perfect.They were awesome! So moist and tasty! My hubby is not a big fan of kabobs of any sort yet he has already requested these again! I think this time I will take some others advice and add some veggies (mushrooms, onions, peppers) in with the marinade. This recipe is a keeper for sure! Update: The second time I made these they were just as perfect as the first, even my extremely picky brother-in-law loved them. I made a second batch of marinade using half the amount of each ingredient and placed in it baby bella mushrooms and green pepper chunks. Amazing! Use this recipe!

I used dried rosemary instead of fresh at it worked very well!  I also let the chicken set for 24 hours insead of the 30 minutes.  Other than that, I wouldn't change a thing!

My husband took a bite and immediately commented about the wonderful flavor!  We loved these tasty kabobs!  I used Kraft Garlic Ranch.  Make them tonight if you can!  *Update*  I've made this many, many times since June and everyone that tries it, loves it.  I omit the vinegar, but include everything else.  It's extremely good on boneless chicken thighs, and make sure to marinate overnight.

I admit it, I was skeptical about this recipe. I couldn't see how the strong flavor of worchest...(however you spell it!) and ranch would meld together. They DID! I only used 2T, which was just right for me. I didn't have rosemary, but I don't really like it either, so that worked out fine. My 3 year old said 'mmmm, this chicken is very FLAVORY!' If that isn't worth 5 stars, I don't know what is!

I added red peppers, onions and zucchini and the recipe made plenty of marinade to cover everything. Really flavorful and the rosemary didn't overpower like I thought it might. I used light ranch right out of a bottle and it was good! Easy!

I made this recipe for Father's Day and it was fantastic...I tripled the recipe for a big family gathering.  I marinated the chicken for 24 hours.  Also, I marinated the veggies, too.  (squash, purple onions, zucchini, red&green bell pepper)  Lastly, some in my family aren't big fans of rosemary (I used fresh) and I used only 2/3 of the recipe amount.  Everybody loved it!!  I was getting calls on Monday from my family telling me how great it was!

Well, like all the other reviewers wrote, this is AWESOME!!! I used lower fat/light ranch dressing and dried rosemary (there wasn't any fresh at the store), and my family loved them! They were so moist & tender. The only thing is that they're so messy to make (but I made my hubby put them on the skewers!)

Can't wait to make them again!

This was unique in flavor and tasty.  I made as directed but added a little dry ranch dressing mix in because my husband loves ranch.  I marinated all day and the chicken was nice and tender.  I will be making this again, Thanks!

Everyone who ate it wants the recipe. The only change I made was using peppercorn ranch because I did not have plain, but came out awesome. I omitted the lemon juice and used dried rosemary. (Did'nt have what recipe called for)I'm sure the recipe would not has been as good with dried, but I let it soak overnight. I will be making this millions more, loved it.

AMAZING!! The chicken was sooo tender and flavorful...I thought I made far too much, but there wasn't a piece left!  I steamed veggies and heated the extra marinade, then tossed them together...delicious!  The only changes I made to the recipe: I did not add sugar, based on my own taste, and used only 1/2 tsp of salt.

We cooked this for a family party, and everyone loved it. It was moist and tender. I added a little white vinegar, and omitted the salt.

I have never reviewed a recipe on here before, but felt the need to on this one, it was so GOOD!  Like others, I omitted the salt and cut the sugar in half.  Also, did not have apple cider vinegar on hand, so used regular white vinegar and red wine vinegar.  Doubled the sauce for 6 skinless chicken breasts and I parboiled the breasts in chicken broth. We were taking to lake to cook and did not want to bother with the raw chicken out there.  Used mushrooms, tomatoes, green peppers and purple onions.  They were absolutely delicious!  Will most definetly be making these often this summer.

This is one of my favorite go-to recipes.  I always make extra marinade because I like to dip the cooked chicken chunks in it and I make rice and pour a little marinade on it for serving. Recommend to all my friends. Make on grill and in oven and it always turns out great.

This was great. Reminded me of a stroganoff. I made it in my slow cooker.

I marinated for a little over an hour then threw it all into my slowcooker. I used 3 good sized breats. To use more chicken, I'd double the sauce. I added 1 tablespoon of onion powder and did use a good tablespoon of sugar which is called for as being optional.

I cooked it on low for probably 4 hours and stirred it occasionally. When it was looking done I mixed equal parts of a tablespoon of cornstarch and water to thicken the sauce. 

Served it over noodles. Delicious combo of ingredients.

Chicken is my hubby's least fav...he took one bite while taking the meat off the grill.  From inside the house we heard him say WOW, so we knew we were in for something REALLY GOOD!

This is a KEEPER

this was very good!  i ended up having to throw the kabobs in the oven, 425 for 25 min, because we were in a tornado warning.  i had cherry tomatoes, mushrooms, red pepper & red onion threaded between the chicken and served with brown rice.  i can't wait to make this again, but on the grill.  outstanding sauce!!!

I really like this.  I marinated it for much longer than required (a few hours).  It may even benefit more from an overnight marinade.  I made it in an electric grill bottom skillet.  It was maybe too oily and I will try using less oil next time.  Also, I used 1/2 recommended amount rosemary because substituted dry rosemary for fresh.  I think I will use a whole Tablespoon next time and grind or crush it better first.  Its a very tastey sauce.  I agree that it is a good sauce on rice.

These were good -- nothing special for us. Probably just our taste. Will not make these again. Also, I followed the recipe to the tee. Sorry 
Update -- We did these again and used 1/2 a package of dry ranch dressing mix and it made all the difference in the world. The other change of a dash of Tarragon vinegar.

We tried it last night.  We didn't love it, but we really liked it. The next time I make it, I will cut back on the salt and maybe add a little more ranch dressing.  It is definitely a recipe that we will use again.

I made these for my birthday party and they were GONE!  So I made TWENTY EIGHT kabobs (each with one chicken breast skewered on each kabob) for my son's birthday, figuring the 8 kids would be too busy for more than one and the 12 adults might have a couple.  We about had kid/parent wars on our hands!  The kids STOPPED PLAYING for seconds and the parents were coming back for more!  I could have made 48 and they would have still been gone.  I could barely get them off the grill before they'd be snagged...I had to make the kids wait or we'd had had a bunch of burnt fingers!  Some of them would stop swarming the grill...these are 5 year olds!  I also got the remark from one kid, "My mom can't make anything like this!" ;)  WHOA!  Great recipe!

I did not make the kabobs but instead marinated whole chicken breasts. I grilled them on a stovetop grill pan and they turned out wonderful.  I boiled the remaining marinade as a dipping sauce which was excellent.  Will definately make this again.

I'm planning a cook out for my hubby's b.day. He wants ribs, chicken AND salmon for the main courses - I wanted something guests could easily pick up to munch on or sit down and eat as well - so I decided to do some kabobs for the chicken. I thought I'd try several different recipes to see which one he liked the best. I was afraid he would want to do them all, as you can see he likes choices! I made this Rosemary Ranch one, Hawaiian Chicken Kabobs, Chicken Kabobs Mexicana, and Yummy Honey Chicken Kabobs. For lunch today we had one of each as a test... following all recipes exactly and marinated each one overnight. This one was definitely the best! Chicken was much more tender, juicy, and full of flavor compared to the other ones. Too bad it had the most calories/fat - but hey it's for a party!

I made this recipe but didn't have ranch dressing. I had a packet of ranch dip mix which I combined in a bowl with cream cheese and I used that instead of ranch dressing. It adhered to the chicken and was sooooooooo delish. My family loves it including my "non meat eating" 5 year old daughter.  I have made these for friends on bunko night and everyone wanted the recipe. Friends have passed this recipe on to other friends like crazy. The ingredients sound so simple but the end result is taste heaven!

These were wonderful and so easy! My husband just kept commenting on how great they tasted. I omitted the salt and the sugar and used fat free ranch dressing. I mixed in onions and green peppers in the kabobs and they were so flavorful. I saved the marinade as previously mentioned and poured on the couscous. So great! I will definitely be making this again soon!

Whenever I ask my husband how he liked the dinner I cooked, his usual reply is "It's alright."  But with this one, he raved about it.  I threaded the chicken with green and red bell peppers and pineapple chunks, and they go very well with the chicken.  It's highly recommended!

If I could give this 10 stars I would. One of the best chicken recipe I have found on this site. We do not even like ranch dressing but will now have a bottle of it on hand at all times just to be able to prepare this recipe. I did not include the optional sugar. Thanks, Theresa, for this fantastic recipe!

2 tsp. of salt is way too much for this, especially because you already have the salt from the worcestershire. Next time, I will either half the salt or totally omit it. Otherwise, good flavor.

The marinade was very tasty.  I added zucchini, onions and red peppers to the kabobs - delicious!

These were good.  I reduced the salt to 1/2 tsp, but would probably do 1tsp instead to make it more flavorful.  Very tender chicken.  Thanks for the recipe, Theresa.

I made these last night and my family was raving all night long. My husband is the pickiest eater ever, but likes ranch dressing so I thought I'd try this.  It was a huge hit. My 6 year old ate 2 whole kebabs and my 3 year old ate one whole one all by himself, and he doesn't even like chicken.  You aren't going to believe this but I'm making it again tonight and I'm making 3 times the amount and having my parents over.  The best thing was I had everything on hand! Thank you so much for this recipe. I know we will be enjoyiing it all summer long!

My family gave this recipe rave reviews.  Husband was especially impressed.  I followed recipe as is except that I had tenderloin pieces so I didn't cut up and use as kabobs.  I just left them as is and grilled as is.  Perfect!  Will definitely use this recipe over and over.

This chicken was great.  The marinade tasted salty, but the chicken wasn't overwhelmingly salty.  Next time I will try making it with less salt.

Made this dish last night and it Rocked!!. Made a couple of changes, first I decided to bake it at 375 for about an hour. Didn't have any white viniger or lemon juice but i did have apple cider viniger and used that. I cut the salt and sugar in half as well. Chicken was tender, juicy with slightly tangy sweetness. Served it over a fresh salad. Amazing!!!!!

The chicken was amazing!!  Did not use the sugar and used 1/2 TBSP of dried rosemary instead of fresh.  Served with thinly sliced tomato and cucumber on pita with tzatziki sauce.  So good!!!!

My daughter and I thought it was amazing! I used packet made Hidden Valley adding 1/2 cup Sour cream and 1/2 cup milk instead of a cup of milk. I also added some Dill and Garlic Powder to the marinade. It was delicious!   What I wanted to add is I cooked the marinade with little wine to make a sauce.  I like sauces on my chicken

This is fabulous! I added vegetables to the skewers and marinated the meat and veggies for much longer (approx 1.5 and 6 hours on the two times I’ve made it). Other than that made as instructed. Served at a BBQ and my guests flipped over it—several asked for the recipe—and they were thrilled to take home doggy bags. Definitely a keeper!

My husband and I really liked this recipe!  Great flavor and I'm glad it didn't taste too Ranch-y.  I noticed the tang and rosemary the most.  My kids, however, hated it and wouldn't eat it.  They mostly thought it was "slimy" -- maybe I'll use less marinade next time?  I would try it again!

Hard to taste the rosemary, but it is a great tasting marinade.

This chicken recipe is magnificent! My whole family loved it.  It is so so easy to make. I followed the recipe exactly except I marinated it a lot longer (about an hour and a half). I kept them tight together on the skewer so they wouldn't dry out and grilled them for about 7 minutes on each side. Definite keeper.

Yummy. I probably put much more rosemary in this just because I have a huge plant and love it. The chicken was very tender. I BBQ’d them about 15 minutes on 375ish heat. Husband loved them. I will use this marinade for chicken breasts as well.

Made exactly as written.  Used it on really nice plump skinless, boneless chicken breasts which we cut in halves.  Conditions outside were not optimum for grilling but hubby undertook it anyway and stayed with it til all the chicken was perfectly cooked.  OOPS, I did sub one ingredients out.  Instead of sugar I used a sugar substitute called Swerve.  The chicken was moist and very tasty!  Thanks for the great recipe!

Delicious.  I do reduce the oil by 1/2, but I always do that with every recipe I can.  I used dried rosemary, conversion is 1 TBL fresh = 1 tsp dried.  My husband does not like ranch dressing, but it sounded so good I made it and didn't tell him the ingredients, and he thinks it is wonderful.   I have made this with kabobs, and whole chicken breasts when pressed for time and don't feel like cutting and skewering.  Great either way.

One of the tastiest chicken recipes I’ve ever made and very simple too. I used boneless chicken breasts and reduced the salt to 1 teaspoon.  My husband even commented on how good it was. It will be a staple now.

Wow was this ever the best marinade for chicken!  I made two recipes but this one was the most popular, and I thought it was the best.  I am going to use this recipe for mushrooms in the crock pot  I will substitute butter for olive oil and try to figure the rest out later when I make this mushroom recipe.
Try this for a guaranteed winning recipe.  I also put my fresh rosemary into my coffee grinder to really chop them up fine.
Yummiest ever chicken skewer recipe!

Expected to love this but it was just ok.  Hubs loves ranch but just made a face when he tasted this.  Have several recipes we like more, so I won't be making this again.  Glad I scaled this down for just 2 chicken breasts

Read lots of reviews and decided to make exactly as written except used white wine vinegar instead of white vinegar. Only marinated for about an hour. Added zucchini and red pepper to my skewers. Used my stovetop grill pan because it’s too hot in TX right now to stand over the outdoor grill. I threw a piece of foil over the kabobs so that the chicken would cook through. These surprised me with my much flavor they had with minimal marinating time. Everyone raved! Will definitely make these again and again! Thanks for a great recipe!

Tender, moist and flavorful! This is a delicious recipe. Followed it exactly except for cutting the salt in half and omitting the optional sugar. It’s messy when threading the skewers, but all kabobs are. Trying it agin as a marinade for grilled boneless, skinless chicken breasts. I have to imagine it’s going to be just as good!

Have made this a few times now and we really like it. Served to company tonight and got compliments. Kids and adults both like it. My only advice is to skewer the chicken first and pour marinade over the meat on a cookie sheet or similar pan (the chicken is too slippery to skewer easily if marinated first). Turn the skewers to coat the meat. Oil the grill so the meat doesn’t stick too. Enjoy!

Excellent! Took the advice from other reviews, cut back on the salt. Also baked in the marinade in a aluminum tin on the BBQ, once almost done finished on grille for perfection.

I never review anything but this recipe is fantastic. The entire family told me to make more next time. Instead of oiling the grill I used my grill pan and used bacon to line it. We have a new favorite in my house.

Perfect chicken recipe.  I use my leftover ranch dressing for this and have both baked (see other reviews for directions) and grilled.  Wonderful for company or weekday dinners.  I have served it on a bed of couscous or with rice.

I can of messed up. I read “ranch dressing” and thought ranch powder. That’s what I bought so that’s what I used! My husband and I own an olive oil and vinegar store so I used rosemary infused olive oil and garlic infused white balsamic. No added sugar. Marinaded for several hours and alternated with variegated red peppers. Very good!

I was not a fan. The flavor I loved was the rosemary, but I really got turned off by the smell and look and it all combined while it was marinating.  I am surprised I did not care for it based on the positive reviews.

Followed directions exactly.  Very moist chicken.  Not as flavorful as I was expecting based on reviews but liked it enough I am going to make it again.

Good, but not a lot of flavor. Followed the recipe as listed, without the option sugar. I marinated chicken and veggies for over 4 hours. The chicken came out tender but none of the marinade flavor came through.

This was very tasty!!  I used 1/4 cup olive oil, closer to 2 Tbs. Worc., dried rosemary that I crushed in a mortar/pestal, and 1 tsp. salt. Using Hidden Valley Ranch dressing I thought it was still a bit too salty for our taste so next time I might omit the additional salt altogether. I didn't have time to cut and thread the chicken on a skewer so I just pounded and cut the breasts in half and grilled them.

I don’t know if I will be able to eat chicken any other way now!! So so tasty!! I have to hide spices from my kids so I used 1 tbsp of ground rosemary as a substitute. Thank you so much for sharing!

Absolutely a Keeper for grilling! We (4) loved it. Tender chicken chunks loaded with flavor. I made whole green beans and roasted on the grill corn on the cob. Yum. Update: I made as stated except for the method of cooking. My grill was out so I used my air fryer. Put the pieces in 350 for about 7 minutes. They came out a bit browned and fully cooked, tasted great over some rice and corn on the side.

My family loved this.  I added vegetable chunks to the marinade and put them on the skewers with the chicken. I had plenty uncooked leftovers so I froze it and plan to grill it  in a grill pan instead of sticking it on skewers.

Perfect.  i’ve made this a few times. I double the marinade and use it for vegetables on skewers (peppers, onions, mushrooms ).  I like to put the vegetables on one skewer and the chicken on a different skewer because they take different time to cook.

Scott says excellent recipe. I cooked it in a convection oven on cookie sheet covered with foil at temperature of 375 until chicken done- about 15-20 minutes.
I substituted several things in the marinade
used mayonnaise instead of ranch dressing
added two tbsp of ketchup, one tbsp of minced ginger, some sweet hot sauce from fridge. used rest of recommended ingredients
delicious.

Awesome! I don't put them on skewers I just bake them in the oven with all of the marinade. Uncovered at 450 for 20 mins. The extra sauce makes an excellent gravy over rice as another reviewer suggested. I only add a pinch of sugar. 5 Stars!!

These were amazing! I used dried rosemary, no sugar, and added 2 fresh basil leaves. I also marinated it for a few hours, if I had the time I would have let it marinate for longer, but it was great as is. It was a bit salty, so next time I will either halve or omit the salt. Will definitely make this again.

Made this for my teenage daughter and she really liked it! Did a side of jasmine rice and tomato and cucumber salad. The recipe says 8 - 12 minutes on the grill but it took about 20 -25 minutes to cook to our liking - I flipped once or twice during cooking to evenly brown. A success that I will make again!

I've made this excellent marinade several times.  I always use boneless, skinless thighs, cut the salt down to a shake or two, and marinade for a few hours.  Sometimes I make kabobs and sometimes I grill whole thighs - good either way.   Thanks for the recipe

Delicious! I let it marinate all day while I was at work and then grilled. My kids usually need some kind of dip with their chicken but you don't need anything with this. Love it!!

I added cherry tomatoes, pearl onions, and bell peppers to the skewers and set aside a portion of the marinade as a dipping sauce.  This also works for pork tenderloin

Excellent. Definitely make extra marinade to drizzle over rice. My family devoured it. I used chicken breasts instead of making kebabs. It was so moist and delicious.

Our family LOVES this recipe! Even our picky eaters devour this chicken! It's tender, juicy and flavorful. I. The past, we've always grilled it on skewers with peppers and onions but today I'm going to bake it in the oven instead. I know it's going to be just as delicious ??

This recipe is freaking awesome!!!! I cooked it in the oven rather than over flame and it turned out amazing...

What I did was also skewered green peppers and tomatoes, made it all in the oven (cooking at 400 for about 25 minutes), placing the skewers on a Pyrex bowl to keep 'em elevated - and then dripped the run off leftover sauce from the chicken mixture after it was cooked onto the veggies and a little back on the chicken and served it.. 

OH MY god was it awesome. Best. Kabobs. Ever.

Thank You, Theresa!!!!!

This is a great recipe.  I decreased the amount of chicken since I was only cooking for three.  The whole family enjoyed it :).  With it being so low in carbs, this is definitely one recipe I will use again.

I haven't tried yet. I intend to make them soon. I will use rosemary skewers,instead of the bamboo or metal. I use them for all my skewed food, imparts an incredible flavor.

This has become a regular in our mealtime rotation. All 5 of us in our family love it - even my pickiest kiddo! I omit the sugar and double the marinade. I add mushrooms, zucchini, and bell pepper to the mix and let it marinate for a few hours if there’s time. I boil the marinade after I pull everything out and place them on skewers and we drizzle it over the top when eating. We eat it atop caluiflower rice and it’s a healthy, very yummy meal!

Followed the recipe except cutting the oil in half, that the only reason for 4 stars. I think this would be a great recipe for wings if you spiced it up a little. I would make this again.

Amazing! I used 1 teaspoon of sugar and thighs instead of breasts. I threw in half a chopped yellow onion, half a bell pepper, half a red pepper and a full container of mushrooms into the marinate as well. Two hours later, I threw it all into a tray and cooked in the oven at 450 for 20 minutes. The marinade does thin out after cooking but tasted amazing all dumped over rice. Will make again and again!

Gave it 3 stars not because it wasn’t good because they could easily be added to any summertime outing but because it felt like it was missing something. Maybe a bit of a kick like cayenne or even a bit of garlic before adding to the mixture. One upside was the fresh rosemary, oh Lordy how delicious it was.

Made it for the second time and it was as good as the first time. This time I used the marinade with the potatoes and bbq’d them both which the potatoes turned out really good too.

Made this tonight.  I marinated  onions and peppers with the chicken breast, for at least 2 hours, skewered it all and then I stuck it under the broiler (I don't have access to an outside grill).  I was disappointed, didn't have any "wow", and in fact hubby and I both thought it was rather bland.  Don't think I'll be making this again.

For the most part, I make this recipe to the T except I probably use a lot more rosemary. I let the chicken marinate for at least 2-3 days and the grill them. These are really one of my favorites, I never get tired of them. So delicious and savory.

Made this for dinner last night. Followed the recipe exactly as stated. The chicken tasted like I was just eating a bowl of ranch dressing. I was disappointed. But the next day we had the leftover skewers for lunch and they were delicious. They did not taste like a bowl of ranch. The rosemary stood out with out overpowering the chicken. If we make this again we will only be eating it the next day. I cannot explain why, it is just far better cold the following day.

These Kabobs were excellent! Marinated for 8 hours and included baby creamer potatoes, onions, and red bell peppers. Brushed with olive oil and chopped cilantro. Served with home made coconut flour street size tortillas and rice.

This was an easy and flavorful recipe!  Everyone loved it and asked for the recipe.  Didn’t change a thing and it was delicious.  I’m sure you could bake this in the oven and get great results, too!  Make this!  You’ll be glad you did!

Very Nice Recipe I made it but left out the salt, (only bc I don’t care for salt) added ½ teaspoon of garlic powder & used a Garlic Ranch Dressing. I marinated Chix breasts then grilled them on the bbq basting each breast as I turned them adding a seasoning salt (a mixture of spices & peppers I make) served with Chix stuffing but a rice pilaf or any startch would work to.

Loved the flavors! No need to add salt IMHO. Like others, I doubled the marinade recipe and baked in the oven at 350 for 30 minutes. Covered for first 20 minutes. Served over rice and everyone loved it.

I purchased chicken tenders and placed them on the skewer in one piece.  Kept it to 4 minutes on each side on the grill.  Very moist.  This made a beautiful meal, added a side of fresh cut up grilled veggies.  The second time I made it I added a side of rice pilaf.

Very tender.   Because it was raining cats & dogs outside, I baked it in a 350 degree oven for 20 minutes as one reader suggested.   Didn't get the classic brown char of a grill but was tasty and easy to make.

This was delicious. Instead of using ranch dressing, I used ranch dressing powder along with skim milk for a little healthier option. This dish was very flavorful, and the chicken was tender.

-DELICIOUS! I cut back the oil and sugar by half. Next time, I will probably use the recommended amount as the sweetest really added something to the taste. My husband discarded the marinade while the kabobs were grilling, so I would like to try to use it for dipping or for veggies next time. Tender and yummy!

This is a great marinade for chicken!  It came out very flavorful and moist.  I made only one minor change - I added some fresh minced garlic and omitted the rosemary - only because my 9 year old grandson wouldn't have eaten it if I did.  After marinading halved chicken breasts in it for most of the day, I  just BBQ'd them whole to save time.   Delicious and will use again!

This is the perfect marinade! It has great flavor, while still being mild enough that the kids like it. It also does keep the chicken moist! Plus it's easy enough to make often. I marinade my chicken over night and cook the next day and it always comes out great!

3.5 stars.  These were good, but pretty bland.  Not bad, just kind of "meh."   Perhaps I'll try them again eventually with more seasoning.

Love these!  We do chicken chunks separate from marinated veggie chunks and then just slip all off the skewers and have. A great dish. Hubs doesn’t usually go for ranch dressing but he loves these!,,,,

The marinade was easy to put together. I even eyeballed most of the ingredients without measuring and it still came out juicy and delicious. My husband and teens were impressed with the flavoring.

I had super high hopes for this and thought surely the top critical review was a fluke (given all the positive ones) but it was not at all like I had hoped. Both bland and dry. :( Perhaps I'll give it another shot again the next time I have a the odd chicken breast left over for another recipe. Always try to give the "high hopes"recipes another shot in case I went wrong somewhere.

Used alittle extra Worcestershire sauce and lemon juice.
Didnt have fresh rosemary so I used alittle more than called for of dried rosemary leaves.

I slathered 3 chicken breast cut in half length wise (6 pieces) with half of sauce, let sit for about 30 minutes and baked on 400°f With foil cover for 20 minutes took off foil and added rest of sauce and cooked for about 25-30 minutes. (Cooked alittle too much but I was multi tasking and it wasn't burning)

Sweet with subtle rosemary taste.

Chicken came out moist, but not very flavorful. Not sure I’ll make this again.

I wanna try this baked 20 minutes  at 350 and served over rice, perhaps brown & wild rice.  Will use 50%  of   rosemary, dried.  Will also modify my rating to last tense!  I expect it will still be 5 stars!

This is one of our family's favorites since I first made it a year ago.  I recently used it on whole boneless breasts because I didn't want to fuss with the skewers and it worked out great!  Everyone prefers the kabobs better though.

these  were really good. I followed another reviewer's advice and we lined a grill pan with foil instead of threading them onto skewers , which was easier and very delicious.  Would recommend this dish!

This is my absolute favorite chicken recipe. It is so flavorful and moist right off the grill! The first time I made it, I cubed the chicken and made the skewers. Now when I make it, I just use tenders and cook them right on the grill--much easier and just as delicious.

We made this yesterday and it was so good! And I used 8 chicken breasts instead of 5 and there was enough of the marinade. Next time I just have to make sure I cut more red onion and bell peppers for the skewers. But over all really good and tender. Will definitely make this again! Thank you!!!

Followed the recipe pretty much as written.......but used chicken tenderloins.  I marinaded them for about 5 or 6 hours.  Chicken was delicious, and moist.  Will certainly make again.

Delicious! I made this exactly as directed, minus the optional sugar. This was so easy and flavorful that I wouldn't change a thing. I am usually disappointed by lack of taste in most recipes, therefore I typically made modifications going forward. However, my husband and kids loved it just as is and no one even asked for any form of dipping sauce. That says a lot in my house! I used Fresh Thyme Organic Buttermilk Ranch dressing in this recipe.

An excellent marinade! My grill ran out of gas so I baked them in a 350 oven for 45 minutes. They turned out moist and delicious. This recipe is a keeper.

I made this twice in the past three weeks.  Like most I left out the sugar and halved the olive oil.  First time around was great but seemed a little bland.  This past weekend was for a group and I added 1 tablespoon Dried Rosemary, and 1 teaspoon of Dry Mustard which gave a little kick.  I still halved the olive oil and left out the sugar.  Fantastic!  Everyone wanted the recipe.  
Also recipe will do 3-5 chicken breasts so multiply ingredients as you increase the chicken.  Also marinated about 12 hours.

This was really good and juicy.  I did as other reviewers and only add 1 tsp salt and a little less sugar.  I also didn't add the Worcestershire sauce but only because of allergies.  Great recipe thanks for posting.

Adding one more comment... my husband cooked these low and slow on the bbq and brushed them with the extra sauce the whole time. So they were pretty saucy, almost creamy, when they were done... not dry at all. Oh my gosh so good!!!!!

made it for one so adjusted the recipe appropriately.  decided to bake it as per one rave reviewer.  baked it at 350 for 20 mins in my toaster oven.  served over rice.  strange taste.  some pieces of chicken tough, sauce a bit acidic.  not sure about the bottled ranch dressing as i am used to doing sauces from "scratch".  not to my liking and won't do again, but others obviously were happy.

This was a huge hit in our house. In addition to a freshly squeezed lemon, I added some lemon zest. The rain held us back from making it outside, so I just browned it on the stovetop. Between that and the raspberry walnut salad I made, my husband was practically licking the plate for dinner tonight!

I have made these at least a dozen times. It is always a hit. Great to do on whole breasts as well instead of cubed.  No kids love this marinade. I typically make it as stated in the recipe. At times I have altered the type of herb used to alter the flavor. I like the rosemary best but we also like it with thyme.

I used whole chicken breasts instead of pieces.  Marinated about two hours.  Otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  Served with grilled vegetables and a tossed salad.   Delicious.  I will definitely make again.

OMG really?  You have got to be kidding me!  This recipe is INCREDIBLE!  I made it as is but cut the salt and sugar by half.  Let it marinade for about 6 hours and cooked as kebabs on the grill.   Also took about 10 pieces and breaded with Panko and cooked that way in the oven -- OFF THE HOOK!  Really, I can't wait to make this again!  This recipe is coming into my weekly rotation.  THANKS SO MUCH!

I made these just as the recipe said and they were delicious! My kids and picky husband even loved them. I even got compliments from the hubs for these kabobs. Usually he eats without complaint, but when there's something he really likes, he voices it. Definitely a keeper. These are so easy to make too, I would even make these for a backyard party for friends.

Good recipe!  Two of the large boneless breasts from the grocery store will do.  Save the rest of the marinade and baste the kabobs a couple of times for better flavor.

I am not one for writing reviews often, but this was seriously some of the best chicken I have made. Tender, moist, flavorful and nice crispy edges from the grill. I did cut back on the oil as others suggested, but other than that, I followed the recipe. So good!

Very flavorful and juicy chicken. We added pineapple chunks to the kabobs because we love grilled pineapple.

I baked this in the oven like some other reviewers. They said to bake it at 350 for 20 minutes in the sauce. I put mine in a 9x10 pan and it was still raw on the outside after 20 minutes. At 40 minutes it was cooked but not hot so I baked my bite size pieces 50 minutes total. In the end, this chicken was edible but I didn’t like it. It didn’t have much flavor and tasted kinda like roast turkey. I wouldn’t make it this way again. I gave this recipe 4 stars because I have made it on the grill before and it was good  I just don’t recommend oven baking it.

Was a hit on Memorial Day weekend.  I used jalepeno ranch dressing, otherwise followed the recipes.  Our guests were asking for the recipe!

This chicken was delicious, even my picky non-chicken liking husband really enjoyed it. The only thing  I would change is omitting the salt, seemed a bit too salty for us Ranch has enough salt on it own.. Otherwise delicious!

I used this recipe on boneless skinless chicken breast. I tenderized meat before grilling. Also, I halved the olive oil. Absolutely delicious!

A go-to family fave!  I make it exactly as written and it's fantastic every time.  Best if marinated overnight I've found.

My picky eaters did beg for more!! I made this as written. My husband said it's the best chicken dish he's ever had. We boiled the leftover marinade and drizzled it over rice. The marinade separated, but it was yummy. This will be in our regular summer grilling rotation.

I enjoyed the flavor of this recipe.  My chicken cubes were too small and some of them stuck to the grill.  Next time I will keep the pieces bigger.

I made this exactly as written - as I do most every recipe the first time around - and it turned out perfectly!  The leftovers made a great salad topping.  Mmmmm!  Daughter is already asking me to make it again!

We loved this chicken! I made it exactly as described except I had to bake instead of grilling. Baked at 400 for 20 minutes in the marinade. We all really loved the flavor. Definitely making this again!

I made no changes, except adjusted it for 2 people... It's simple, easy & tastes GREAT!!  I will make this over the Summer for evening meals.. We dipped each piece of chicken in Ranch Dressing, however the marinade gave the chicken a wonderful flavor..so dipping was ''optional''... I used ''Fresh Dried Rosemary'' I get from my Rosemary Plants.. It gave the chicken a nice aroma even while on the Grill!!  WILL MAKE AGAIN!!

5.18.2018 - These were excellent! Very easy and quick to make. I did reduce the salt in half and think it could be reduced to 1/2 tsp depending on the ranch dressing you're using. The marinade ingredients are not overpowering at all and results in moist and a good flavor for the chicken.  Definitely not bland kabobs. We skewered the chicken along with bell peppers and tomatoes. Will be making this recipe again! Thanks for the recipe! 5.27.2018 - Made these again to be Lactose Free by making a vegan ranch dressing (from Karissa's Vegan Kitchen website). The kabob's were delicious and we felt they were much better using the vegan dressing instead of Hidden Valley Ranch.  Great recipe and one we'll definitely continue to make.

WoW! This was a huge hit tonight at dinner. I heard the declaration, "this is so good!" with nearly every bite from all sitting at the table.  It really is that good!  I didn't have enough prepared ranch dressing on hand, so I whipped up a batch using a ranch dressing packet mix I had in my pantry. I also cut the salt down to 1/4 teaspoon since the ranch dressing mix was pretty high in sodium. I made a triple batch of marinade. I put chicken breast tenders in one bag and mushrooms, onion, and sweet red pepper pieces in another. After a few hours, I skewered it all and put it on the grill.
Don't be tempted to cut back on the rosemary or the sugar because the addition of those flavors are what make it so special. This really is an "impress the company" type of dish!  Be sure to make more than you think you need because they'll be going back for seconds and thirds. The leftover chicken would also be delicious the next day sliced up on a salad with some arugula and diced hard-boiled egg.

I made it in the oven and my entire family scarfed it down!  The only reason why I did not give it 5 stars is because it came out dry; I cannot seem to find the right moment when the chicken is done.  Other than that, the flavors were superb!  Thank you for sharing this recipe!

I didn’t have any lemon or fresh rosemary. So I omitted the lemon and used dried rosemary. It was great!! Everyone aged 2-37 loved it! We will definitely put this in the rotation.

This was fantastic.  Only thing I subbed was Balsamic instead of white vinegar because that’s what I had.  I also cooked it on a Foreman grill.  Will absolutely make again

I was shocked to find how much my husband and I disliked this given all the glowing reviews. I followed the recipe except I used less rosemary. My husband who is the least fussy person I know wouldn't eat it. No accounting for tastes I suppose. A huge disappointment!

This was excellent! Very juicy and flavorful chicken kabobs, will definitely make this again. Used someone’s suggestion to serve with rice & grilled veggies.

Yummy & easy! I omitted the salt & sugar, cut chicken breast in half, and baked in the oven for about 25 minutes , and this was a hit! I served with rice pilaf and green beans. The whole family loved it and I will be making this again! :)

I had to bake these so it didn't turn out quite right for my taste.  Also, you've really got to love rosemary to enjoy this dish.

It was VERY moist and nice flavor although not crazy strong. I had my pieces cut a bit bigger than 1" cubes and it did take awhile for them to cook thru on the grill - more like 25-30 minutes. They looked very gourmet coming off the grill but might try making in the oven next time since I'm not the best at grilling in general.

This was a hit with my family. My mom said she didn't know chicken could taste so good. Dad is diabetic, so I used light ranch, about 1/4 cup olive oil, skipped the sugar, and  only 1 tsp salt. Even with it modified the chicken came out tender, juicy, and tasty!

I marinated for about an hour. I had to bake it because of the weather and we didn't like it very much. I will definately be trying this on the grill after winter, I'm sure it will be a lot better.

Great taste. I'd make this again. I marinated these for several days and made these as chicken strips cooked in the oven at 370 for ~12 minutes due to weather. The only negative was the amount of oil that was left over in the  cooked marinate. For future oven cooking, I will cut back the oil to a tablespoon or so.

I completely forgot about the olive oil! Cut salt back in half and used only a teaspoon of sugar. Let it marinate for about an hour and a half and cooked with the broiler. Delicious! Served with broccoli, cauliflower, and a dinner roll. It was a hit.

Really liked it! I let mine marinate for a few hours because I didn't have to make dinner right away. Was very flavorful, moist, and tender. There were no leftovers! I have to agree with another  member that dried rosemary probably would have worked too.  Will make again.

This was outstanding! I followed the recipe almost exactly, with the exception of using dried rosemary instead of fresh. The grill is put away for the season so I used the broiler instead. Came out fantastic! My kids even liked it.

What a great recipe!  We used home made Ranch Dressing with real buttermilk and served it over Orzo.  Be careful not to overcook it, ours took about 12 min on the grill.

My family and guests LOVE this recipe. Sometimes I cook and serve it as whole chicken breasts instead of on a kabob. Works perfect!  One tip, I like to marinate it overnight and I use fresh rosemary.

Absolutely amazing! I discovered this recipe at the beginning of summer and it immediately became part of our regular grilling rotation. I omit all salt and sugar for dietary reasons but keep everything else as is. Fresh rosemary is a must! I always make another batch of the marinade and keep it separate to use as a dipping sauce. I use the leftover meat marinade to brush onto the chicken toward the end of the grilling stage. Best. Recipe. Ever. Thanks so much, Theresa!

This is so delicious. I was very pleasantly surprised at how juicy and tender the meat was since it was chicken breast I was a little hesitant but boy was this good.  My 7 year old had seconds and he is a very picky eater. Loved it!

Yes I will make it again.  Tender and juicy when fully cooked.  Our family loved it.  Used leftovers in chicken broccoli casserole which was very good and easy since chicken was already cooked and seasoned. Best chicken on the grill I have every had.

I made this following the recipe with modifications suggested by others. My family found it rather bland compared to some of my other chicken recipes. I won't make again.

A keeper for sure! Thanks to the reviewer who gave oven directions, perfect! 
I made the marinade as written, no changes. Put it and the cut-up chicken in a casserole dish. Marinated for about 15 minutes as we were in a hurry for dinner.  Cooked at 450 for 20 minutes and it was perfect.  Served with rice and green beans. Yummy! Thanks for a great recipe!

I used chicken tenders and did not cube it.   Also added Parmesan to thicken the sauce so it would stick to the chicken.   Kids loved it.

This was pretty good. Next time I'd like to marinate for longer than 30 minutes to an hour. I was also running late on time so I used the thighs I had thawed instead of breasts. I'll use breasts next time. I also did what one reviewer said and made it in the oven @450 for 20 minutes. Although I thought this recipe was pretty alright, I plan to make it again on the grill and with the original recipe.

Pretty much followed the recipe. Use a grill pan inside the house on my gas range. The chicken breasts turned out to be more like tenders when I unwrapped them, so I cut them in strips and marinated. Really good and my guests were happy so I was, too!

My husband's all time favorite chicken. He just doesn't dig grilling the kabobs.  Prefers it in a dish,over rice, extra dressing and lots of mushrooms, cooked in oven or grill .

This is a great recipe.  I've made it numerous times.  The flavor is delicious!  It's a really good entree for a party.  Do all the prep work ahead of time and put the skewers on the grill when the guests arrive.  Cooks quickly.  I usually serve with a side of rice and a garden or Caesar salad.  i have used dried rosemary when I didn't have fresh and it was still good.  Thanks for sharing Theresa.

This chicken was delicious! Super moist and flavorful but with the crisp grilled edges we all love. My super picky 4 yr old loved it, I wish I would have made 5 lbs of this chicken. I used apple cider vinegar and dried rosemary and it was perfect. I will definitely make this over and over again! Thank you for this easy simple recipe for a busy mom who sick of coming up with new dinner ideas.

Incredible!  Was quick and easy.  I didn't have white vinegar so I used apple cider vinegar.  I just cooked the breasts whole to 150 degrees on the grill then let them sit under foil for about 7 minutes.  Will definitely make again!

This is one of my favorite recipes.  I don't change a thing.  I recommend only marinading for the recommended time.  I've left it for longer and I don't like it as much.  Too salty.

We are not huge chicken fans - but this was amazing. The marinade is nice and creamy. I wouldn't change a thing!  Thanks for the recipe. My picky six year old even loved it!

Love, love, love! I followed the recipe except I used low fat ranch dressing and low sodium Worcestershire sauce. Have made it at least four or five times and every time it is a hit. Double the sauce and save half of it to put over rice. Steam a little broccoli and you have a great meal.

This came out amazing! I halved the chicken as it would've made a TON of it however kept the marinade recipe the same to have a lot of sauce and marinated for a few hours. I also followed the advice of another user and cooked the marinated chicken tips in a foil-lined grill basket vs. skewers. Everything came out moist and exploding with flavor. Thai jasmine white rice on the side is the perfect compliment to this dish.

I was a little skeptical at first seeing the ingredients, but  the culinary exercise I assigned myself that day was Rosemary themed.  My wife and I usually avoid kabobs because we feel the meat gets too dried out . This certainly was not the case in this recipe. We both loved it. I try new things in search of Sunday meals when our family gets together and only the best make it to our Sunday table. This is now in the rotation!

This is the best chicken I have ever done on the BBQ. So juicy and tender, so little effort to make an amazing meal. I used a wood pellet BBQ so a slow cook with smoke, it was awesome. Didn't change anything just followed the recipe.

I found this recipe last month and we've made it a handful of times since. It is so delicious. I saute onion and bell pepper pieces to thread on the skewers with the chicken. SO GOOD!

This is the most tender, juicy chicken I've ever put on the grill! SO delicious and easy to make. I tried the recipe as recommended, but I would opt out of the sugar next time (personal preference). This is definitely getting added to the menu for BBQ rotation. Thank you!

We had no grill so we cooked in oven. I didn't have rosemary but I had an EVVO bread spice mixture.  It had rosemary so I  used it.  I have made this recipe the way it was written and it was good that way too.

Excellent tasting chicken!!! Omit the salt!!!!! I cooked in the oven @420 until internal temp was 140 or so, placed half of pieces on skewers and cooked on grill until 165. So moist and tender. The other pieces that were cooked in oven were good but not as good as the grilled.

Made this evening and it was wonderful.  Used fresh rosemary from our herb garden and followed the recipe as written with the exception of just a pinch of salt as recommended by previous reviewers. A keeper.

This is a great recipe.  We didn't do the kabobs, but stir fried it in a pan.  Added 3 cloves of grated garlic to add more flavor.  Served it with a fresh kale power salad.  Would make it again.

Overall this recipe was pretty good.  Chicken is tender like everyone says, but if you know how to grill chicken that shouldn't be a problem.  Maybe cut some of the salt and oil.  Rosemary does come through, ranch not so much.  As much as you marinade it has a really light flavor which a lot of people like.  I thought it was okay and will do it again, but tweak the recipe.

I didn't read reviews beforehand, but instinct told me the salt (2 Teaspoons!!) was too much. I cut it to 1 tsp and it was still too salty. I made my own ranch dressing with fresh herbs. Flavors were great. Next time though, no salt.

These were very good.  After reading the reviews, I decided to cook in a grill pan to enjoy the marinade, but at the end it really separated and was quite oily.  I had even cut the oil in half.  I may have cooked them a little longer than needed, but wanted to make sure they were done.  The only other change I made was to use dry rosemary since that was all I had and cut the salt in half as well.  I used low fat ranch because I wanted to keep the calorie count down.  I poured the marinade over rice and it was good that way.  It would probably be good over mashed potatoes too.

Used charcoal grill , at low grill height of about 3 inches and without foil.  Outstanding ! Done in about 12 minutes.
Leftovers moist and excellent next day.  I know that the family will be requesting more picnics with this winner !  Paired it with Best in the West baked beans/ corn on cob/ fruit salad and GF chocolate bundt cake using King Arthur mix.  All great !!!

Absolutely delicious!!  I followed the directions exactly, making the ranch dressing from scratch (thanks, Penzey's Spices!).

Update:  Can also be done as chicken strips.  Marinade for 30 minutes, put on grill, take off and re-dunk in marinade, then sear again on grill to get full flavor of the sauce.

I have always loved this recipe and, at first, my hubby was okay with it but he just isn't a fan of chicken breast meat, so tonight I threaded in slices of bacon in between the cubes of chicken and he loved it.  Kept saying how good it was and ate every bite, whereas last few times I made this he left a couple pieces of chicken--and I'm very careful not to overcook and dry it out.  But--bacon!  Go figure, right?!

I haven't made this dish yet but I will. I just wanted to warn those folks that are using the left over marinade that this is a good way to get food poisoning.  For your own safety, please discard the leftover marinade and do not make it into a dipping sauce or anything else. 
On a positive note, I cannot wait to make this dish.

Kid tested and dad approved! Whenever I find a good recipe that causes the kids to clean their plates, it's added to the rotation. This will definitely be one. I didn't use the sugar, but otherwise made it as instructed. The chicken was juicy and flavorful.

These were really good, I will make again. 

Only change was to marinate for 2 hours instead of just 30 minutes.

Next time I will probably add more rosemary, since that flavour didn't come through very strongly.

I loved this recipe and will be using it many times. I doubled the recipe for the marinade to use as a sauce. I followed exactly with the exception of the salt. I listened to other reviewers and cut it in half which worked out perfectly to my  taste. I marinated the vegetables as well (peppers, mushrooms, tomatoes, and red onion.) I put some on skewers and the rest I grilled in a grill basked. Served with warm pita bread and have also used with brown rice. Just added a little of the extra marinade / sauce.  Was a big hit with my guests and wonderful left overs.

Okay, I'll admit that I used chicken wings as opposed to boneless, skinless chicken breast.  The skin of the chicken may have made it a challenge for the marinade, although I have successfully used marinade with chicken wings in the past.  I thought the recipe was okay but I'll used boneless, skinless chicken on my next try.

My teenage daughter found this recipe and wanted to make it for Memorial Day weekend.  It turned out FANTASTIC!  Based on a review that said there was not enough flavor we ended up marinating the chicken for 3 hours instead of 30 minutes, and the finished product was BURSTING with flavor!  My husband cooked the kabobs, and he cooked them to perfection.  They were moist and juicy and oh so delicious.  We will definitely be making these again soon!

This chicken is amazing!!! I just used a grill mat and grilled it loose and it turned out perfect! I was a little skeptical at first when I saw how creamy and heavy the sauce looked. Once you grill it, it thins out and just gives the chicken a great flavor! Highly recommend.

I like making mac and cheese but sometimes it seems like paste. Not so with this recipe! I'm throwing out all of the others and sticking with this one from now on. Thanks for putting it out there.

This recipe is my go to for dinners with friends and family! It’s our daughter’s favorite dinner, and she requests it whenever she comes home.  The chicken is so tender and the mix of flavors is perfect!

Really delicious and flavorful chicken! Marinated chicken for about 3 hrs and cooked on the grill outside and it smelled incredible while cooking! Used dried rosemary because that's what I had and about 2 tbs oil instead of the amt called for in the recipe. There's oil in the bottled ranch dressing already so next time I make this recipe I will omit the oil altogether.  I used Hidden Valley light ranch dressing.  This recipe is a definite keeper! Thank you!

Used aluminum foil on the grill for the first half of the cooking time, then put skewers directly on the grill.  Like others have said: tender, moist and delicious.  Served with veggie kabobs and rice. Will use this recipe on shrimp, too.  Thanks!

This recipe is very good, but like any marinade for chicken, it should be given 24 hours to marinate prior to grilling.  This will impart the flavors that work so well together:  rosemary and ranch!  Do that and give it a 5!

I did not make any changes...when I use a Recipe from AllRecipes, out of respect for the person who posted, I never make changes the first time.  This was good...definitely very tender Chicken.  The ranch definitely added a nice flavour to the Chicken, but, I found the Rosemary to be overpowering.  IF I make it again, I would be sure to reduce, not eliminate, the amount of Rosemary used.  many thanks to the Cook who posted this!!

This recipe is fabulous, I marinated it for 24 hours and the flavor is out of this world. If you don't marinate your meat for a time, the saturated flavor that you are looking for, wont be there. I don't like Ranch dressing, and I don't eat chicken left over. Yet, here I am, eating my leftovers, for the second time. 

I had neighbors say, I don't know what you had cooking on the grill, but we really wanted it. I cooked it for my in-laws, they loved it. My husband and I love it. 

This will be a staple in our home, so thank you!

Made this tonight for dinner. Yummy and easy. Instead of grilling it I pan cooked it and thickened the marinade into a sauce. The kids loved it, it's a miracle!

Great flavor and very easy to assemble.  I made kabobs with the marinated chicken along with: red/green peppers, onions and mushrooms.  Absolutely a keeper and I will be making this again. No changes were made to the original recipe.

This was a really easy and excellent meal. I mixed up the marinade with a little less sugar than called for, also subbing brown sugar for white because that's what I had on hand. I had frozen chicken breasts in the freezer so the night before I put them in a ziplock bag with the marinade while still frozen. I put this back into the refrigerator to defrost in the sauce. The next day I periodically massaged the bag. An hour before cooking this for dinner, I soaked the skewers in a baking dish of water and I took the chicken out to cut into bite-size pieces. I noticed the marinade had gotten a bit watery from the chicken defrosting so I made a small extra portion of it and added it to the bag. Then I tossed the cut pieces of chicken back into the bag with some cut up broccoli. We grilled this over coals alongside some veggies skewers and a basket of the marinated broccoli. Throughout the grilling process we poured extra sauce from the bag over the chicken and vegetables. This was tender, tasty and easy to prepare. Will make again!

This came out excellent! Very tasty, and actually tasted like a mediterranean kabob dish. I actually used the broiler in my oven (live in an apartment, so no grill!). I set the broiler at 450 degrees, with the heating element 4-5 inches away for about 5 minutes each side. I had to do an additional 5 minutes to get that charred crispy texture. Super good. I tried this because I was tired of doing the same chicken recipes and wanted something different. Thanks so much to whoever posted it!

So good! I was pleasantly surprised. I thought it would be too salty or tart but it wasn't. Super tender and flavorful. We didn't have fresh rosemary so I used dried. I should have chopped it up more. I will make this again for sure!

I loved this recipe. Rosemary is one of my most favorite herb. Instead of using ranch dressing,  I used Hidden Valley ranch dressing packet. It turned out really well. My son whose 8 and my husband really enjoyed it. I paired it with Garlic Parmesan Asparagus.

This tasted great! It was tender and juicy and short on time to make (cooking 8 min per side for our chx breasts). I didn't have any ranch dressing, but I did have hidden valley ranch mix (made 1/2 of packet according to directions on mix). Other than that followed directions as stated. I loved it, my husband on the other hand gave it 3 stars. I do wish I would've remembered to save some of the marinade sauce before I added the chicken ( for my rice). Still I was in Mmm, Mmm Heaven with this chicken recipe, I will be  making this again! Thanks for posting it!

The marinade is sooooooooooooo good I didn't use on kebabs but I did use it on chicken breast and thighs I also heated the marinade before I added it to the chicken to bring out the flavor of the rosemary and made a glaze from the reserve marinade

This has to be some of the tastiest chicken kabobs I have made.  The rosemary and ranch, along many of the other ingredients provide a great flavor palate that you can taste off of the grill.  I used four large chicken breasts from Costco and they were the perfect size for this recipe.  I have plenty of fresh rosemary bushes planted around the house and it was just the ticket for the fragrant flavor rosemary provides.  Happens to be one of my favorite herbs I use for cooking.  The kabobs were tender and juicy as I grilled them for 6 minutes on each side.  This will be a family favorite for sure.

We've made this recipe numerous times and EVERYONE raves about it! Tonight I went to make it, not realizing that we were out of rosemary, so I decided to change it up a little to work with what we had, and it too was delicious! I simply replaced the Ranch with Creamy Cesar dressing and used Italian seasoning instead of the Rosemary. Both versions are yummy!

This was a huge hit with the entire family! I used 1 teas salt, instead of 2 teas- but otherwise  followed the recipe as written. It turned out incredibly tender.

It's my favorite chicken recipe, I don't use fresh rosemary, the dried one works perfectly fine. Also I use chicken breast and cook the reserved sauce on a low heat for extra dipping sauce. It's delicious. Also I paid it with rosemary mushrooms. It's a must make.

I don't get it. I read so many reviews. Made the dish and it was BLAH at best. I don't eat spicy food or heavily seasoned so I figured I would have no issue with it but when I made it and places it on plate not only did it look boring and white, it was very bland and tasteless to me. Wished I could have voted for it but honestly I wouldn't waste another batch of good chicken on it. ??.

I roasted these in the oven rather than grilling and they were quite bland. Looking forward to grilling to see if the flavor changes.

I am not normally a fan of most chicken dishes but try to eat it because it's supposed to be healthier than red meat.  This recipe was AWESOME!! Chicken was so tender and had a great flavor!  We will be making this again!!

Made this tonight. Only marinated for 15 minutes (time constraint, no Worchestershire Sauce! Waited for hubby to bring some home.) Used some chicken breast tenderloins and some boneless thighs. Baked in oven with some quartered red potatoes and carrots (which roasted while meat marinated.) A huge hit with the whole family. Husband initially voiced concern because he does not like hot ranch dressing. My 7 year old does not like ranch dressing (neither do I, but I have enjoyed things with ranch - not salad - so this sounded yummy!) so we served it without telling him what the marinade/sauce was. He loved it! Hubby loved it. Very good., moist and tasty! Can't wait to marinade longer and grill, per recipe!

Crowd pleaser.  Everyone raved. I doubled the marinade and cooked on BBQ using grill plate instead of kabobs.  It cut down on prep time and everything cooked evenly.

We were divided on how many stars to give this recipe. Two of us thought the kebabs were average. The other two gave them 5 stars. The marinade was delicious. It would be great on a salad or as a dipping sauce for grilled chicken.

Did it in a slow cooker for two hours. Served it over short grain brown rice one night and boiled, chunked potatoes the next. Family liked it. Followed recipe closely. Substituted rice vinegar for white vinegar due to what I had on hand. Will make it again with lessome or no salt since it was slightly salty.

Only change was to halve the olive oil like other reviewers said and it came out fantastic!  Made for very savory, juicy chicken kabobs.

This is truly sensational. Probably our all time favorite recipe! We use chicken tenderloins and marinade everything in ziplock bag overnight. I also add more lemon, as it's our personal preference.

I made the sauce as directed and put it on salmon. It's wonderful. The key is you have to charcoal grill it. Any other way, it's just not the same.

We were in the middle of an ice storm so I baked them in the oven. The color was not the pretty color in the picture, but the flavor was spot on. I love rosemary with chicken and the addition of the ranch dressing was a good addition.

The chicken was moist but the flavors were bland and I did not care for the ranch marinade.   It had a weird aftertaste.  I have a bunch of leftovers which I will end up throwing away.

My family loved this chicken recipe.  I roasted the kabobs in the oven since it was too cold to use the grill outside.  The flavor was great.  Served the chicken over rice.

Excellent!  My 13 yo son said he thinks it is the best chicken I have ever made.  I didn't have any lemon juice, so didn't use.  Used 1 tsp of dried rosemary and only 1 tsp of sugar.  Definite keeper!!

Excellent flavor and very moist.  This is definitely a keeper!  After reading the reviews, I did reduce the salt and oil by half.   I had to bake this instead of grilling it due to a snow storm. Looking forward to trying it on the grill next time!

I really enjoyed this dish. It delivered on the promise to be moist and juicy. I did a few things a little different - based purely on personal taste. I cut the salt as well as the rosemary in half. Also next time I would use a little less oil as the mixture seemed to be swimming in oil. I also used white wine vinegar in place of plain white vinegar. I think next time I would also add some chili flakes or a dash of favourite hot sauce as I like a little extra oomph. But overall, I was very happy with this recipe.  We diced up the chicken and placed on top of a salad and really enjoyed the results. Thank you for sharing.

Excellent. Used chicken tenders instead of cubed breasts for a nicer presentation and texture. Also added a little food color to give it a tandoori look. Will definitely be in the monthly lineup.

I've made this several times and we love it. I've never made the shish kabobs on the grill. I just pour the marinade over several chicken breasts and bake at 350 for 30 min or when chicken is done.

Wow!  I thoroughly enjoyed this dish. The prep time was a little longer than I would have liked but this dish was amazing!  Cook time was about 14 minutes. This was my first time using Rosemary and it really enhanced the flavor of the meat.  I served the chicken with rice, a mango salsa and asparagus.  My family loved it.

Loved it!  Great flavor, will definitely do it again. My whole family loved it, including the picky eaters.  Paired it with grilled zucchini & green pepper, baked sweet potato, and cut up tomatoes.

Too cold here to grill so I made this using chicken breasts, placed them in a baking dish and covered them with the marinade/sauce. Baked at 350 for about 35 minutes. It was fantastic!

This was good. The family agreed that we would make it again. I liked the marinade and would use it on chicken cooked in other ways too. I served it with a simple pasta side and a green salad.

I love this marinade. I leave out the vinegar and lemon juice and use whole chicken thighs. I usually let the chicken marinate for at least 2 hours since I don't have the acids. It's my favorite chicken recipe.

This was a little messy to cook indoors (my grill needs to plating), but absolutely wonderful.  I've mentioned before my son is a major picky eater, has never liked chicken, ever!  He devoured these and told me they tasted "Divine"!  I did have to substitute the Worcestershire sauce (ran out making the meatballs the day before...) so I used a steak house marinade instead, however everything else was exact and absolutely wonderful and filling.  We paired the kabobs with carrots :)

LOVE LOVE LOVE this marinade.  It seasons the meat quickly.  I have also used this with steak.  I'm not a fan of rosemary so left this out.  Sometimes I will add garlic.  You cannot go wrong with this marinade!

The only thing I changed was that I left the breasts whole. This was completely on point. Breasts were juicy, not salty. I'll definitely  make this again...a lot!! Thank you so much!

I made this exactly as written, and it is delicious. So glad to have something to do with all our fresh rosemary, which is essential. The chicken was also good hot or cold the next day as leftovers.

I made tenderloins/chicken fingers instead of kabobs. They were incredible!!! I had leftovers and used them with bacon, tomato and arugula for a salad the next day. My 4 year old loved these, more than chicken nuggets! Definitely a winner.

It smelled so wonderful while it was grilling, we couldn't wait to taste it!  And, we were so disappointed that it tasted so bland. I followed the recipe to a T, and let it marinate for 6 hours. There just was not any "wow" flavor what so ever. I wanted so much to love this recipe after reading all the rave reviews, and add it to our restaurant.  It wasn't horrible, just not much flavor to make you want to eat it again. It needs major tweaking.

Absolutely delicious. Substituted the fresh rosemary with dried rosemary, just about half the amount called for, and they turned out very good and had a strong rosemary flavour.

This was absolutely delicious, I didn't make any changes to the recipe or ingredients, however I did add red onion, red pepper, and zucchini to the skewers instead of making them as side dishes. Definitely going to make this one again!

This was delicious!!! Easily one of the better recipes I have found online, if not THE best one. Easy to make and yummy. Only confused part was how to scale the recipe since it just says # of chicken breasts instead of providing a weight.

The taste was delicious!  I was skeptical because my family is so picky.  I plan to use this to marinade whole chicken breasts and then oven bake.  The only change I made was to use half the sugar because I'm trying to cut back on added sugars and I was afraid to leave it out completely.   I would say to be sure to use good size pieces of chicken.  Mine were too small and hard to manage on the grill.  But delicious!!

This is our favorite way to make chicken, and that is really saying something! Rather than making these as kabobs, we marinate halved chicken breasts and then put them on the grill. Absolutely delicious!

We agree with SusanD112 - absolutely heavenly!  The chicken pieces were in the marinade for several hours then put on skewers and barbecued.  We boiled the marinade and put that over white rice.  Everyone in the family, especially our three teenagers, loved it!  We can't wait to make it again.  The marinade was so tangy and delicious.  I have not had chicken that tasty in a long, long time.  We made about seven kebobs with about 9-10 big chicken pieces on each.  We thought we were making enough to have plenty for leftovers.  But, we devoured it all!  It was sooooo good!  We highly recommend this dish.

This was AMAZING!!! This was literally the best grilled chicken I've ever had in my life. It was juicy, tender, and honestly I thought the ranch was going to ruin it but it actually completed the whole dish. With the slight taste of ranch and the Rosemary it really did top off the dish. I didn't make the chicken into kabobs only because I didn't have skewers but it didn't make a difference. I did not alter the recipe in any way because the measurements were perfect. It was pretty simple except for mincing all the fresh rosemary by hand, haha. I would recommend this dish to everyone!!! This is my go to chicken dish every time!!

The chicken was a HUGE hit with my family. Especially with my daughter whose palette is the definition of finicky! The ONLY change I made was using lime juice instead of lemon...and it was out of necessity as I didn't have any lemons on hand. Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly (even added the "optional" sugar) as given. I will definitely be making this again!

They were pretty good-more like a 3.5.  Make  sure they are marinated long enough  and mixed well.  A  lot of the flavor comes from the lemon juice I will use a bit more the next time.

This is a great recipe. I have made it numerous times and is very adaptable. I have used both breast and thighs (depending on what I have on hand). The best is if you can use homemade ranch dressing, but your favorite bottled dressing works well too. It is great served with tzaki sauce, Naan bread and grilled veggies.

Delicious!!!  Made exactly according to the recipe except that I took a little extra time to really babysit them and rotate them on the grill.  They came out amazing!  My husband is a great cook and super skeptical of anything with ranch dressing in the recipe, but even he loved them!  This is a keeper and no need to tweak the recipe.

This was very good and the kids liked it. Moist. Served over rice as suggested. Also used only 1/4 c olive oil. Marinated for about 5 hrs. I cooked in a pan over medium heat for about 12 min. Used chicken tenderloins which I cubed prior to marinating.  Would definitely make again!

Delicious! I halved the Olive oil, omitted the sugar,  and used a yogurt dressing, and it dropped the calories per serving to half of what the regular recipe had. We loved this!

The chicken cams out great. There were no leftovers at the end of the meal. The only problem was a few of the pieces stuck to the grill. Maybe it was too hot???

Really great tasting.  I used dried rosemary, and omitted the salt, but followed the rest of the recipe.  It did not need any more salt, btw.  I also added some peppers, onions, mushrooms and tomatoes to the marinade bag along with the chicken for flavour and colour.  These turned out great.

This sauce truly was a hit in my house. My picky children loved it and had seconds. I used chicken tenders and skewered them then grilled them. I'll definitely make it again and set some sauce aside in the beginning for dipping later. Thanks!

Delish! I accidentally forgot the sugar, but it was delicious all the same!  So I prob won't add it next time.  Because I was short on time I only marinated the ckn for 15 min and then grilled.  Super moist and yummy! A keeper!

Fantastic!!!!!! These were a HUGE hit!!! I will definitely be making them again!!! I followed the recipe (I did use fresh squeezed lemon juice and rosemary from my garden) however  I marinaded the chicken for 6 to 7 hours instead of 30 minutes making these full of flavor!!!!

Such a seemingly odd combination of ingredients, but somehow when mixed together, magic happens! I've made this a couple of times now. The first time I implemented a couple reviewer suggestions and it was great (the whole family devoured it). But THIS time I followed the recipe AS WRITTEN and found it truly ranks 5 stars as is! It's fast becoming a family favorite. This one's a keeper!!!

It was amazing! I. Did make minor changes, used only 1/4 cup olive oil, as I was concerned about flare ups on my bbq, and marinated boneless skinless breasts overnight. Thanks for the recipe.

This is one of my family's favorites.  I make it quite regularly following the recipe exactly as found here except I don't add the optional sugar and I marinate the chicken for several hours.  I've made it both with cut up cubed chicken and also with full chicken breasts.  Both ways are good, but I'd say that it's slightly better with chicken cubes.  Personally I hate skewering things so I just get a grill pan with holes in it and grill it on that.  Works just as well and is half the trouble of skewers.  Overall this is a fantastic recipe that I'm happy to have in my menu rotation.

So Rosemary is the only herb I absolutely refuse to eat.  I don't like the smell or the taste or even the appearance .... So, I substituted fresh chopped parsley.  This turned out so well my family is already asking  for it again after less than a week!

Excellent  and absolutely nothing had to be altered to make it so!  We did marinate the chicken overnight as opposed to 30 minutes, but that was more of a convenience issue than a cooking one.  You can eat these alone or they are also great threaded onto skewers with mixed veggies in between.  A very nice surprise and my guests ate them ALL within minutes!

Delish! My husband raved over it. I also added zucchini, onions and peppers to make the kabobs have more flavor. I added those on at the end before I put them on the skewer but the marinade from the chicken still drips on it so tastes wonderful. Very simple, easy, quick and tasty!

This is a very good marinade. Followed recipie exactly. Made my own ranch dressing with Ranch Dressing #2 from this site. Grilled with charcoal over direct heat to get grill marks without over cooking. Everyone loved it. Thanks!

The only changes I made was to use 1.5# of chicken tenders, and 1.5# of chicken cutlets and grill them directly, instead of on skewers.  Phenomenal!  Never had grilled chicken so juicy and tender.  I marinated it for about 6 hours.  The leftovers were great cold, and even warned on the grill two days later.

The flavor of the Rosemary overpowered this dish that we could hardly taste the ranch flavor...I used dried rosemary and it was still strong...I also added tony chacheres to add a little more flavor... They were ok, but being a true New Orleanian that know food I believe the recipe has to be tweaked some!

Very disappointed. Nothing special. I have always marinated chicken for bbq in Italian Dressing and it was just as good. Nothing special. I'll stick with my bottled Italian Dressing.

I made this recipe, just as suggested. No changes, aside from marinating longer than 30 minutes, and not kabobbing the chicken. It was AMAZING!! Chicken is my husbands least favorite meat, he's a beef & potatoes man. I prefer chicken over beef any day. This chicken pleased us both. It was so tender. I was nervous about marinating in ranch dressing, but boy was I wrong. It's become one of our new favorite chicken dishes.

Totally delicious.  I made extra marinade and saved a small amount of the marinade  on the side before I added the chicken.    After the chicken was grilled, I removed from the grill and basted the cooked chicken was the reserved marinade.   Made a world of difference with the flavoring.

This was a really great dish I grilled up for July 4th celebration.    But it would be great anytime.  I picked it because it seemed quick - and it WAS!  I marinated the cut chicken in the early morning in a plastic bag and by evening when I grilled the Kabobs they were very tasty and tender.    I reduced the oil by half and added a bit more ranch dressing to make up the difference.    Even the picky eaters loved it - I made a LOT for everyone - I had only one kabob left over!  It went really fast.

My family is super polite and super picky in their food. My family will say they like something but wont eat it- ergo they dont really like it. Imagine my  surprise when every scrap of this chicken mysteriously dissappeared from everyones plates! This is just awesome chicken. Flavorful and tender.

I read reviews and made the following changes.  To the marinade used 1/4 c olive oil, 1 1/2 T W. Sauce, 3 T Rosemary, 1/2 t salt, 2 t lemon juice and used 1/2 marinade on chicken and 1/2 marinade on veggies, fresh mushrooms w/stems - halved, green and red bell peppers, cut into 1 1/2" pieces, large Vidalia onion cut into 1 1/2" pieces and let set in refrig. for 4-5 hours, then threaded all on skewers.  Preheated electric grill to med. high heat and cooked for 15 minutes turning 1/2 way through.  This came out excellent for a 4th of July cookout.  Thanks for the recipe and for the great reviews!  Will make again...

These came out great! I followed the ingredients and instructions in the recipe exactly. I combined the ingredients in a Ziploc bag so I could shake everything up really well.
I minced up the rosemary and added it to the marinade, but I also stuck the entire rosemary plant in the bag while it marinated.
Grilled on skewers and flipped when appropriate. About 10-12 minutes total on the grill @ med-high temp.

I had my doubts about this recipe, but we did a trial run the night before our party and all I could say was, "YUM!!!".   The chicken breast was surprisingly tender, small and large pieces alike and the flavor was amazing.

Everyone at the BBQ loved this, adults AND kids.  The rosemary flavor was a little weaker than I'd like and we'll probably add 50% more rosemary than written the next time we make this.

Served this at my cookout and it was fantastic! Didn't change anything other than using chicken tenders and marinaded for an hour, mainly because we didn't grill until later in afternoon. I found myself making copies of this recipe for my quests!  Chicken couldn't have been more tender or juicy. Flavor was amazing. It was the hit of my cookout. Thank you Theresa Spencer for sharing!

upon reading all the positive reviews for this dish, i was a bit skeptical. no way could it be as good as all these people were saying. i was wrong. this dish was DELICIOUS. based on other reviews, i halved the amount of olive oil and salt, and i also added some extra rosemary and pepper for a flavor kick. it was amazing! so juicy and tender, i could not believe it. i definitely will be making this again.

No changes are needed! I'm finally writing a review after making this dish almost weekly for over a year! Kids love it too. If you can marinate the chicken for at least 2 hours it really makes a difference!

I base my (star) ratings on ; Ease of preparation, ability of travelers to have ingredients on hand, and amount of time from start to mouth.

These were quick and easy, I made a bunch, then sat around the campfire with friends and enjoyed them.
Next time I will try cooking this over the campfire, friends will have their own skewer to cook. Sounds like fun!!

My picky son and husband both liked it! My husband doesn't even like chicken and he said "this is really good, and I don't like chicken, but you can make this again!"

Really good. Chicken stayed moist (I cooked it on foil on the grill in the marinade). Only had (4) chicken breasts and 1/4c of ranch dressing on hand so I had to half the marinade recipe. I chose to omit the sugar. Was more than enough marinade to cook in and use as a sauce. Everyone ate it - Will definately make again.

Made this for my husband, myself and three teenage kids. It was a huge hit, even for my daughter who doesn't like Ranch. Two thumbs up!  They asked that I make chicken like this all the time from now on.

This was excellent! I made these for the kids while my husband and I grilled something spicier for ourselves. After tasting theirs, we wished we'd made more for ourselves. I served over homemade rice pilaf from this site (Anne's, I think) with a green salad. We'll be making this again soon- this time for all of us!

I cut it in strips and grilled it without the skewers and it was great and we didn't have to handle it after the marinade.
Everyone loved the flavor and we will definitely be making this again.

I made it using fresh rosemary from our garden. It was a hit and everyone wanted the recipe.  Instead of cutting into 1 inch cubes I sliced the breasts length wise and threaded them onto wooden skewers.

This was simply wonderful and a change from the usual Greek marinade I normally use.  Everyone loved it and even my youngest that only seems to eat pizza managed to eat a few pieces (a sign that it  has got to be good).  I saved some marinade aside for dipping.  I did follow the recommendation of others to cut the oil in half to a quarter of a cup.  I think next time I would cut down on the salt and up the rosemary.  A winner.

We grill marinated chicken all the time. This was good, but nothing special. And I really couldn't taste much rosemary, either.

This recipe is awesome! I did reduce the salt as advised by other reviews and kept some of the sauce to the side to brush on once it was on the grill! Also as another review stated, I cut up some red potatoes and put them in some water in the microwave for 15 minutes and then put them on as well. Only other modification was that I hadn't ever really used rosemary in a recipe so I didn't use a whole lot of it. Highly recommend this recipe!!

Wow this chicken is good! I've made it a few times now, and the only change I make is I omit the salt. I thought adding sugar sounded weird at first, but I think it really is necessary to balance the flavor. The meat is sooo moist and tender! Definitely a new favorite in our house.

I have made this several times to the exact instructions. Always awesome! Today I added some fresh dill along with the rosemary, just to use it up. Over the top good!!! I usually marinate overnight or at least several hours. Include green peppers, onions and cherry tomatoes in the marinade. Assemble after several hours and enjoy.  SO GOOD!!!

We had this for dinner tonight.  It was wonderful and definitely a keeper!  I I added bell pepper, and onion sections  in between the chicken pieces for extra flavor.  I used balsamic vinegar and added a little blood orange infused oil , garlic powder , and lemon pepper to my marinade and there was not a bite left!   Y'all should try this

Okay, this is one of those recipes that you can believe every review on. I made it just as posted but reduced the salt by half. Did a mixture of both chicken and pork as shish kabobs. I have to agree that this recipe is GREAT! Am saving and printing to use again! Definitely worth trying!

I made the recipe exactly as stated and neither I nor my husband liked it.I will say that the chicken stayed moist which was a plus. It was the flavour that we didn't like.

I made a couple changes. I left out the vinegar and just used juice from a half a lemon. I also did only a 1/4 cup of oil. I believe I put a little garlic powder in the marinade as well. I marinated for 5-6 hours and it came out amazing. Grilled it up for dinner and my 2 family members raved about it. Definitely making this one again.

Very good base start with although I made changes to offset the extreme stringency and saltiness.   Make the base recipe and then add a bunch of maple syrup or other sugar base to offset the salt, or... just cut the salt in half and roll with original base.  Otherwise great, I would not have thought to use Ranch as the base. it makes the marinade very sticky... great.

This is really, really tasty!! I can't wait to try marinating full-size chicken breasts in it. I made it just as written, except I was all out of ranch dressing, so I substituted with mayonnaise and Hidden Valley Ranch Dips dry seasoning mix. Awesome!!

loved this recipe! so simple yet so tasty! the only thing i would change for next time is to use less salt. i also used the leftover marinade after i took the chicken out and brushed it on large mushrooms and peppers, and grilled them as well. so so good!

This was amazing. My husband hates ranch but I didn't tell him what was on it, until after. He couldn't even tell! Even my picky 9 year old loved these too! I'll have to try my father in law next. Simple, quick and great for a summer time treat

This was really good! I don't have a grill so made it in the oven and poured the excess marinade over the kabobs. I also lined the pan with aluminum foil which kept it from burning and kept the juices in.

This was incredible.  When I was making it, I wasn't so sure about the ingredients mixing together but it was awesome!  I marinated for a couple of hours.  It's a "keeper".

Made a slightly modified version using powdered ranch instead of ranch dressing, with extra olive oil and worcestershire on some chicken thighs.  Grilled up fantastic, great flavor to them, going to be making this one allot.

We're not actually big grillers at my house, but when I worked nights, I was a big fan of my crock pot, so I used this as a crock pot recipe instead.  I prepared it as directed, then cooked it on the crock pot for eight hours on low.  I served it over rice with the marinade as a "sauce".  My husband I both loved it, and it's now a standby recipe for us!

I've made this several times. I like to use fresh rosemary, and I use Ken's ranch dressing. I think it' fresher-tasting. I usually make extra; leftovers make great gyros.

Made this for mothers day. That would be my wife, her mother and her sister. I paired it with a caesar salad and roasted veggies. I got praise from all. I recommend this to anyone looking for an easy tasting grilled chicken dish.

Amazing flavor!
The prep work for this recipe is minimal other than building the skewers. We also added peppers, mushrooms and onions to the skewers. 
Tip: Use the left over marinade to brush on the kabobs during cooking. it jacks the flavor to another level!

Delicious!! I cut back that olive oil by 1/4 after reading some other reviews. Then I cut the chicken up, tossed it with the marinade in a ziplock bag, and let it sit in the fridge all day so that it really soaked up the flavor. After I put all the chicken and veggies on the kabob, I used the excess marinade in the bag to coat the veggies (red and yellow pepper, zucchini, yellow squash, and sweet onion). Next time I hope to have some fresh rosemary; all I had on hand at the time was dried.  But still, everything came out so flavorful!  I judge how well a recipe turned out by how long the leftovers last in the fridge--these were gone by the next day.

+ 5 more stars. Marinated overnight,  Delicious.  I didn't have fresh rosemary, dried was fine. I didn't add salt, glad I didn't.I Used balsamic vinegar. So tender and moist.  Will definitely be in my rotation.  Thanks for an awesome recipe.

These came out great, I went a bit heavy on the rosemary and ground pepper and light on the salt. These will become a common meal at my place.

This is a flavorful and easy recipe. I substituted dried Rosemary for the fresh as the latter was a bit strong when I first made it, but overall the recipe was good either way.

I don't have a grill so I baked and then broiled the chicken. I skewered one for my 12 yr old and cut up the rest to put in a salad. The chicken was moist and flavorful.

You know it's good when kids say they like it! First night made kabobs as directed and then next night sautéed veggies:peppers, onions, tomatoes, garlic and then added chicken and marinade(marinade that was not used with raw chicken) and served over rice topped with fresh mozzarella cheese and roasted almonds. Next as a time saver, I'm going to drop chicken breast in the marinade and freeze in a ziplock Baggie.

Theses were so good that even my pickiest eater asked for seconds. I omitted the sugar, substituted coconut aminos for  the Worcestershire and used my homemade ranch in order to make these Whole 30 compliant (sugar free). I added some veggies (bell peppers, red onions, and zucchini) and assembled the kabobs before covering them in the sauce to make them easier to prepare and less messy. I grilled them on my gas grill on a few grill mats and they came out perfect and full of flavor. I have already made these 3 times, each time making a bigger batch as they don't seem to last long around my house. Thanks for the great recipe! I love when I find things that can be easily adapted to fit my dietary needs.

This was great we were able to cut our chicken with our forks.  Last night I used this to marinade pork chops and it was also great.   You have to try this both ways.

I've had my eye on this for a while now, I'm so glad I finally decided to try it! 
I had 8 chicken breasts which I decided to just flatten a bit and keep whole instead of kabobs. 
I doubled the marinade but only used 1/4 cup of olive oil in total. 
I Marinaded mine for 2 hours and they turned out very flavourful... And I could definitely taste the ranch 
My only suggestion is to cut the oil down by half at least.. And use a good quality ranch dressing.

Outstanding... didn't make kabobs, just used the marinate (only modification was skipping the sugar) for boneless chx breast and grilled.  Incredibly flavorful.  My 17 year old ate the leftovers for breakfast the next day.

I had to add additional sugar, but this was a really good dish.  I did make it on my indoor grill, and it made a big mess of the grill, but it was worth it.  Very good!

We marinate onions & alternate with the chicken cubes and make extra sauce to go on rice. We make a cucumber & yogurt sauce to eat with the chicken, which gives this dish a more Mediterranean flavor. Everyone eats this up.

I followed the recipe as is (isn't that what we are all supposed to do when rating anyway?!) and I loved it. I admit... I was a little worried since we've always used store bought marinades but it impressed me enough to start making my own!

Well I didn't have any propane, so I didn't grill it, nor did I kebob the chicken, but it was still so good! I made the marinade in the morning and didn't cook the chicken until I got home from work, so that was at least 10-11 hours of sitting in the marinade.
Both my husband and I were pleasantly surprised at how good this was (and I'm not known for making really good food outside of a crockpot), so he's already got plans to make this again on the grill.
I did use fresh Rosemary which I think added quite a bit of nice flavor, and I agree that cutting down on the oil would be good for next time, but otherwise, it was perfect the way it's written!

Very good. Used a little less salt and a little more lemon juice. Chicken breast sliced in 2-3 inch wedges. broiled in oven. Very tender and delicious. 
Next time, I'll find another spice to add to give it just a little more oomph.

This recipe was good, however next time I think I will use less olive oil, and more of the other ingredients. It was tasty, however I thought it would have more of a kick in flavor than it did. I love Rosemary, and Ranch... I was hoping to taste these a bit more. 
The chicken cooked nicely with this marinade, the chicken stayed tender and juicy, so I will definitely try it again.

Perfect. Used Hidden Valley ranch. Light on olive oil. 3 large breasts filleted in half. Grilled. Served with roasted asparagus and onions. And rice. Excellent. Make extra for cold salads.
Used boneless, skinless chicken thighs. Absolutely delicious.

There is not much to say about this recipe except that it is absolutely fabulous! I have made this several times and everyone loves it, so much so, when the kiddies see chicken in the freezer they immediately ask if I am making this! I did not change anything on this, great just the way it is! Will obviously be making this for years to come!

This is a very tasty marinade, but I'm glad I read some reviews before making it . I cut in half both the salt and the olive oil and am glad I did. The marinade was bordering on being too salty even at half, and it was way too oily. I am going to reduce both of those quantities a bit more next time.  I had some chicken cubes and marinade left over and cooked them together the next day in the microwave. It was delicious and would probably have been very good over rice. I plan to triple the marinade next time to have enough for sauce.

Really good!  My husband doesn't like chicken and he loved it.  I did the vegetable and chicken on separate kabobs because the veggies don't need as much grill time.  I also did half the salt.  Very flavorful!

I made no changes (other than leaving out the sugar and adding more fresh rosemary than it called for).  I thought this was great. Husband isn't a huge chicken person.  He liked it, as far as chicken goes, but didn't have seconds.  Non-picky kid loved it. Picky kid at two larger cubes(claimed he liked it okay but acted suspicious of it). He is not open to trying new foods so I would call this a success.

This chicken is delightful.  Followed others recommendations and cut the olive oil in half and omitted the salt.  I marinated the chicken for 2 1/2 hours.  Next time I plan to add red and green peppers, mushrooms, and red onion to the skewers.

I'm convinced that those who don't like this recipe also don't like puppies and rainbows. It is amazing! The only thing I leave out is the salt. One of our favorites! Like many others, I marinate it several hours, or overnight.

I'm rating this 5 stars because I am always asked for the recipe. The only thing I do differently is to marinate overnight. I've never tried anything else because I've only made it for large picnics, but I've been told by others who have tried this recipe that it has way more flavor this way.

These were delicious. My husband don't like ranch dressing but he gave them a try. He feel in love with them. Enough flavor even that I didn't add the rosemary since I didn't have it. I cook them in the oven at 450 for 20 min with all the sauce. The chicken was very moist and soft and the sauce was very good over the rice. I'm adding this recipe to my favorites. :)

Do not even think about doing this recipe last minute. You would be selling it short if you did the minimum marinade time of 30 minutes. Gotta be a few hours in advance, if not overnight. Grilling them is the ticket to unleashing this recipe's full potential. Do it right, or don't do it at all!

I made this and absolutely loved it! I left out the salt after reading some of the reviews but I'll include it next time. I also realized that my pieces had a 'tight fit' on the skewer and in trying to make sure they were all well cooked, I had to grill them longer and thus got a little overdone. I'm definitely keeping this recipe as one of my favorite 'quickies'.

Very good! I used less olive oil, only a pinch of salt, and a teaspoon of sugar. Marinated chicken breasts for a couple hours, they were very tasty.

Fantastic. I usually have a hard time getting grilled chicken done perfectly, but this recipe is just right and the flavor is delicious and unique.

This recipe was great! I added a cup of ketchup to give it a little more of a BBQ-taste, and added in some oregano and basil, and it turned out amazingly. I used somewhat bigger pieces of chicken and it still cooked the flavor in quite well. I would marinate it longer next time, though, if you make this recipe with bigger pieces of chicken, just so it can soak up as much flavor as possible!

This was delicious! I did not include the optional sugar and I cut the salt in half as other reviewers suggested. I also marinated the chicken for about 12 hours. The kabobs were so juicy and flavorful. We had guests over and they asked for the recipe. I heated up the leftover marinade in the oven and it was great over rice. Next time I will make extra of the marinade.

I used slightly less oil than listed, as suggested in these reviews, the first time I made it. My family loved it. We never made kabobs because we were too lazy to take the propane tank to the store to swap it out for a full one. We took the chicken pieces and cooked the chicken in the marinade in a Pyrex in the oven and it was absolutely perfect. We even used some of the "gravy" over rice.  Easy recipe. The most labor intensive part is cutting up chicken because I tend to over trim the chicken breasts.

I didn't want to bother with the whole mess of the outdoor grill so I prepared this on my George Foreman grill.  I'm giving this 4 out of 5 because I reduced the salt to a scant 1.5 tsp. and it was still a bit on the salty side.  Next time I will try using 1 tsp. salt.  I also let this sit for longer than 30 minutes while prepping other things, so it really had a chance to absorb the flavors.  The marinade was delicious and the chicken was very juicy and tender. This recipe also makes enough marinade for  more than the 5 half breasts it calls for.  Delicious!

What an awesome recipe!  I've made this a few times now with chicken breasts and thighs (both are good).  The sauce is incredible, so I recommend baking rather than grilling.  I place the chicken and marinade in a baking dish for 30 minutes, then just pop it into the oven at 450 for 20 minutes or so.  That way you get to use the extra sauce, which goes great over rice.

Awesome! Make sure you pierce the chicken before putting it in the marinade so the flavor gets into the meat. This may be my favorite way to grill chicken. I didn't put it on kabobs-- just cut the chicken into strips and put on grill.

I've made this a couple of times now, and it's one of my favorite dishes! I personally like really strong flavors, and I've found that marinating the chicken overnight makes an amazing difference!!! I also like to add some zucchini and mushroom slices to the skewers before grilling.

Cut chicken breasts in half and marinated for about 2 hours. Added garlic powder and some crushed garlic to the marinade also. Grilled with wet rosemary stems. Delicious! Family loved it.

We really enjoyed this, but we did make some changes because of  what we had on hand.

We only had 1/4 cup of regular olive oil, so added 1/4 of lemon infused olive oil.  We also didn't have quite 1/4 cup of ranch, so topped it off with Caeser. We used White wine vinegar and substituted Thyme for the Rosemary.  The chicken breast we used, was thin cut, so we grilled it as is, rather than as kabobs.  It was delicious!  We will make this again!

These were great! I halved the salt like others suggested. I also let the chicken marinate for 24 hours instead of 30 minutes.  It was incredibly juicy and tender.

I love this recipe.  I have made this several time with rave reviews from friends and family.  Instead of kabobs I usually marinate boneless skinless chicken breast for 3-4 hrs and grill.    This is a keeper.

This is by far the BEST chicken I've ever made! It truly does melt in your mouth...and so easy to make! It's my new go-to chicken dish.

Wow. Really tasty recipe. Note: grilling them gives it more of a charred flavor. Baking doesn't taste as good.

My family loves this recipe and I have made it several times. I only use half the oil called for. A few times I didn't want to bother with threading small chunks onto skewers so I used chicken tenders and grilled them straight on the grill rack. On one occasion I discovered I was out of ranch dressing. I substituted some mayonnaise thinned with milk and added ranch dressing seasonings.  Could not tell the difference.

Because it was too cold to BBQ today, I marinated the whole chicken breasts for most of the day in a large ziplock bag.  The only changes I made to the marinade were to add a little more lemon juice, omit the sugar and I used white wine vinegar instead of white vinegar.  Then I  put them in a roasting pan with the marinade and baked them at 400 for about 20 - 25 minutes.  Oh my, they were delicious and the savoury lemon sauce was perfect!  Everyone loved it!

I just made these for dinner and I have to say, I couldn't stop snacking on them after I was full! It's not like it's bursting with flavor where it hits you in the face but it's very subtle and addicting. I only marinated it for 30 minutes as instructed and it had good flavor and was pretty juicy. When I first saw this recipe and tasted the suace I thought it was odd but it does work well together. I think the important thing is how you cook it.

I didn't have a grill so I tried cooking it on a cast iron skillet which was too small and made for uneven meat. I baked some and it didn't look appealing so I just ended up throwing it all on a skillet with a bit of butter like a fajita and it was really good. I took some advice from people and only used 1/4 oil, any more I think would've been too much. I also omitted salt because everyone said it was too salty but I thought it could use a bit more, I think it depends how you marinade it. I also used buttermilk ranch, threw some veggies on the skillet with leftover marinade and served it with rice. 

Next time, the changes I would make is probably add more Rosemary, go ahead and add the salt, and just throw it on a skillet instead of skewers to save time if I'm really hungry. 

I would make it again! I have some leftover chicken marinating so we will see if it tastes even better overnight.

Really average… I did put it in the oven instead of over the grill… might give it one more chance on the grill.  DEFINITELY need to cut the olive oil at least in half… had a very oily taste.

We made this last night . A couple of small changes . We added orange juice instead of lemon juice , a tablespoon , very good with the rosemary , also used half the salt . Raining outside so we cooked on the stove top griddle. Delicious ! I will use this marinade again for sure. Looking forward to trying with pork and fish …

amazing!!! best chicken i have ever had!  It was cold outside so I did not cook it on the grill.  I cut the chicken into strips and placed it in a casserole dish and baked at 350 for 20 min.  It was so moist and tender.  I have, in the past, grilled it and it was fabulous! :) Enjoy!

I've made these several times and they're in our monthly rotation now.  I don't have a grill, so I've tried the oven and stovetop.  Stove top is better.  I don't bother putting them on skewers anymore.  We have young kids and while it's a fun novelty, I got tired of sword fights :)  I do use fresh rosemary, dried just doesn't have the same flavor.  I also make my own ranch dressing, which is worth the trouble for this recipe.  It's delicious by itself or over rice.  It's a crowd pleaser and all my kids (ages 1-10) like it.

I have made this recipe well over 20 times and it has become a family favorite.  We keep a plant of fresh rosemary growing year round and purchased stainless steel skewers to make this delicious chicken marinade.   Definitely let the chicken marinade in the sauce for at least 4 hours.

This was soo delicious! I doubled the marinade ingredients (besides salt and sugar), and threw green + red peppers into the marinade with the chicken. I added onion wedges to the skewers before grilling.. turned out amazing. Will make again and again.

Loved this chicken recipe!  The only modification I made was to add 1/3 of the rosemary the recipe called for.  Marinated for 45-60 minutes.  Chicken turned out moist and flavorful!  Will definitely make this again!  ***Forgot to oil the grill first to prevent sticking...Will definitely remember that next time.

This chicken is awesome!  Very juicy and flavorful!  I usually cut breasts in half, marinate, and grill.  If you cook in the oven, cook in marinade, then use sauce over rice.  Yummy!

instead of a grill I used a ribbed skillet. I also cut up bell peppers and mushrooms and marinated them along with the chicken.

So delish!!! Made it twice in one weekend. Easy to put together needs 30 minutes to marinate but I do more so the flavors intensify; i marinate for an hour or more but it doesn't really need it. I use Kens's buttermilk ranch dressing and loved the flavors.  Made it as kabobs and regular chicken breasts fillets. Friends and family loved it.

I made these for tailgating today - adding veggies to the skewer. They were wonderful. Tender and very tasty. The flavor was perfect. This recipe allows the natural flavors to come through, but at the same time makes the chicken and veggies better.  I received rave reviews from our tailgating crew.

My small changes:  I included red pepper, onion, fresh mushrooms, and small potatoes (pre-boiled) to my skewers. I used Hidden Valley Light ranch, white wine vinegar, half the sugar, half the rosemary, and no additional salt. I was worried about the rosemary overpowering the taste, but it didn't at all. Next time, I will use the regular amount of rosemary. I made the kebabs last night and let them marinate all night in plastic bags.  We will definitely use this marinade just for chicken breasts in the future too.

This is a fantastic recipe.  We marinaded the chicken for an entire day in the fridge prior to grilling, which made the chicken extremely moist.  Put on the grill with onions, green peppers, and red peppers all marinaded the same.  This was melt-in-your-mouth delicious.  Will definitely be doing again.  Made with a side of rosette potato wedges seasoned with crushed rosemary, salt, and creole seasoning.

Wanted to try a new chicken marinade and I'm so glad I chose this one. I cut boneless, skinless chicken breasts into strips and marinated and grilled in a grill basket.  I was skeptical as I was making the marinade, but now it's my new favorite.

Wow! Bf and I were amazed at the flavor after only marinating a half hour! We used whole breasts(didn't cut into chunks) and still the flavor permeated through the moist meat. I always thought people were overreacting when they said they'd make it every week, this very well may be a weekly dinner!

Fabulous! This one is a keeper. The only thing I did differently was that I lined my grilled with foil and cooked the cut chicken on the foil without skewers. Absolutely delicious!

I followed the other recipes in the comments, I added a little more ranch, and cut down on some of the oil. I also salted and peppered on the grill and let them cook a bit longer to caramelize a bit. The family went CRAZY over them, Delicious!!!! First meal I ever cooked for the family! Thanks!

I found out about a last minute cookout that my husband's new employer had invited us to.  After getting in from work at 2 a.m. I cut up my chicken, whipped together this marinade ( I was tired, just guessed on the measurements) and let it all sit in the fridge until about 11 a.m. which is when I put the chicken on the skewers and headed to the cookout.  After about 10 minutes they were off the grill and I was nervous, never having made this recipe before, but all of the guys LOVED them, and so did I!!  The chicken was tender, full of flavor, and a big hit!!  My husband doesn't even like rosemary but kept coming back for more!  It seems that the fresh rosemary does really give this recipe that extra boost of flavor, and I poured a little heavy on the worcestershire sauce, outcome was amazing!  If I can make this in the middle of the night, half awake without a measuring cup, and have such a hit then you can't go wrong!!

This is one of my family's all time favorite recipes.  The first time I made it was for a family houseboat vacation in Lake Powell.  I quadrupled the recipe and every last piece was eaten.  I make this for family dinner at least once a month and even my pickiest eaters (I have very little kids) beg for more.  Most of the time, I use dried rosemary because I always have it on hand.  I prefer it with fresh rosemary, but dried works great too.  Do yourself a favor and make this tonight!

I followed the recipe as listed and halved the sugar and salt but the dish was way too rich. I used Kraft ranch dressing which may have been a factor but I was not happy with the way it turned out.

I chose this because I knew it would be a hit with my kids (is there a child out there who doesn't like ranch?) but both my husband and I ended up enjoying them as well!  I forgot to buy fresh rosemary at the market, so after letting these marinade, I sprinkled dried rosemary on them before we grilled them. Great flavor, but I do want to try them with fresh rosemary, as the recipe calls for.

I tried this the first time with thighs and it tasted amazing on the outside, but marinade didn't penetrate into the meat very well (it WAS nice and tender though).  You really need to have small pieces for the flavor impact, but it's well worth it because this marinade is delicious!!  The vinegar sounded strange at first, but don't leave it out.  Follow the recipe as-is and you're sure to have a winner.  If you like this chicken marinade I highly recommend a beef recipe: "Best Steak Marinade in Existence" posted by user Kookie.  These 2 are the last marinades I'll ever use!  Thanks for posting!

I wasn't particularily crazy about the flavours here. Not sure if it was the ranch dressing... or the rosemary... or the combination. But this missed the mark for me.

Scrumptious! Made this marinade exactly as written. Hubby likes dark meat and I prefer white. So we marinaded our preferred pieces of chicken rather than skewering chunks. Used fresh rosemary from my new plant. Then we weren't able to grill them until the next evening, because something came up that we couldn't be home to cook after all. It was delightful. Will definitely make this again.

This was very good! I used rosemary flavored olive oil which helped add more rosemary flavor- otherwise I followed the recipe as written. I loved how moist and tender these were.  All of my children loved it too.

Terrific recipe! I added green pepper and onion to the kabobs just for color and flavor - yum! Great left-overs, too.

Prepped this meal the night before an early afternoon BBQ by having the already put-together kabobs marinate overnight in the fridge. Came out beautifully and no complaints could be heard until there was none left. 
It was a little messy to cook, cutting back on the oil is a good idea. Also, rubbing together and breaking up dried rosemary a bit with your hands brings out more aroma and flavor in the marinade.

I made it in the oven and it wasn't very flavorful. I'll have to try it on the grill next time. I did use someone's recommendation and used the excess marinade to flavor some brown rice and that was really good!

This was just "ok". The upside is that the chicken did not dry out - but there wasn't much flavor either. The only change I had to make was using cider vinegar instead of white vinegar, due to availability. Considering the change I had to make - I gave it 4 stars instead of 3. I'll try again using the white vinegar.

Loved it! I made my own ranch the night before.  I did not add salt or sugar. I added  bell peppers and onions to the kebabs. My husband  and toddler absolutely loved it! I made some roasted asparagus to go with it. It was a home run!

The end product is really delicious! I don't have access to a grill where I'm currently living, so I seared it on the stove. Not exactly pretty looking but the flavors are there. Word of warning: don't let the marinade fool you! I tried it before putting the chicken in and was pretty worried how the end product would turn out but I was pleasantly surprised! Highly recommend this recipe. Definitely going to marinate longer than 30 minutes next time though!

Very nice recipe ~ Followed the directions as written and turned out good.  I usually don't like to grill Kabobs because they dry out so fast, but I did marinate these for 6 hours and they turned out yummy!  I will definetly make these again.

I've made this recipe many times because I absolutely love it! When I make it, I usually separate part of the mix and save it as a dipping sauce for the chicken which I marinade 1 hr - 2 hrs. Great recipe!

These came out really tasty! I used Marie's creamy ceasar dressing and lime juice since that's what I had on hand. The fresh rosemary was very nice; I'll try with dried rosemary next time to see if there's a big difference. And I'll probably marinate overnight so they're all ready to grill for a weeknight dinner.

These were so great. I marinade 8 chicken tenders and grill it up on our stove top flat iron grill with red bell peppers and zucchinis. The hubby loved it so much, it left us wanting more. Only change I made was to use orange juice instead of lemon as I didn't have any on hand. I can imagine it being better with the lemon juice. Definitely will be on our regular dinner rotation. No need to kabob it, less mess.

This is a very good chicken dish. It was fairly simple and my parents and sister loved it. It was a bit heavy for me so I added more lemon juice to lighten it up with the acid. It tasted great on the grill! I paired it with grilled corn and delicious watermelon salad which is just diced watermelon mixed with the juice drizzle blood orange olive oil and chopped up basil! I cook dinner once a week sometimes twice for my family (below the age of 15) and this dish is on my to cook list!

This is by far the best new recipe we've tried in a LONG time!!!  Even picky 11 year old could not get enough.  We reduced the salt to 1 teaspoon and used light hidden valley ranch per other reviewer suggestions. Because everyone spoke so highly of the marinade, I put one batch in a big Ziploc back with the chicken and another batch with zucchini, yellow squash, cherry tomatoes, and a red and orange pepper. Once we put the veggies and chicken on skewers I took the rest of the veggies and marinade and cooked it in a small saucepan while the skewers cooked.  WOW!!!  Super juicy and delicious.  Only problem was I made 4 huge skewers using veggies and 3 total chicken breasts thinking it would last our family of 3 a couple nights, however every single morsel of chicken and vegetables vanished! Thanks for this recipe Theresa!  We will make it often.

We loved it.  We weren't able to grill the chicken, so I fried it on the stove top.  The grill would definitely have made it better, but it was delicious fried.  We served this with rice and steamed veggies.

This was delicious and so easy. I seasoned the chicken with Lawry's salt, pepper, and poultry seasoning before marinating. Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly. I took another reviewer's advice and saved some of the marinade for a dipping sauce which I liked, but my husband said wasn't necessary as the chicken was already so flavorful.

I found it bland.. sure it was tender which is great, but flavour wise didn't have much. I had some leftovers so let it marinate overnight and that batch did taste a bit better, but only slightly. I will stick with my regular recipe.

This is my go to recipe for when friends are coming over and we are grilling out. I have my own rosemary plant which makes this extra special and fresh! I add red peppers or mushrooms to the skewered chicken. always good!

Have made this twice now according to the recipe. Thinking I may have messed up the first time, I tried it again. Both times were a disappointment. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't a hit either...just ok. It was bland and hardly tasted of ranch. Guests and I ended up reaching for the BBQ sauce. I will not be making again.

I have been using this recipe for several years now, it's FANTASTIC!  When I am short on time, I just marinate the chicken with this and skip the kabob part.  Yummmo!

Really good! I halved a pkg. of dry ranch dressing (all I had), to get the correct amount which I don't think affected the flavour once the other ingredients were added.  I used thigh meat instead of breast. 
Was it ever nice to only marinate for the 30 minutes. Many times I forget  to do it early in the day. This can be pulled together easily on a work night for a great summertime family meal. Any side dish would easily compliment this dish. I had fingerling potatoes tonight.
Thanks so much for sharing your recipe.

I have to say, I was pleasantly surprised with how tasty this turned out. I cut the recipe in half and grilled it for about 15 minutes, turning frequently. It came out very tender and moist and very flavorful. My husband loved it, so that means it's a keeper!

This is an absolute family favorite and it one we use often when company comes over.  Very flavorful and great as leftovers (warmed or cold) as well so we always make more than we need.  As mentioned in other comments, I also cut back on the salt.

Everyone in the house LOVES this recipe. I do cut down on the olive oil,salt and rosemary though. We double the marinade and cook this in the oven one pan of marinated chicken cubes and one of marinaded veggies, we do yellow squash, zucchini, onions, peppers and mushrooms. Serve it all over white rice.  It's AMAZING.

Really good, only 4stars because they needed a little more flavor.   Bought ranch dressing mix by accident so I used 1/4 c milk & 1/4 c mayo so I did cut back on the oil to 1/4 c.  And I omitted the salt because of the dressing mix.   I also just baked them because I can't be bothered with skewers.  I think next time I'll use a half packet of dressing mix to up the flavor.

Really great recipe. Flavorful and eat to make. I didn't use actual ranch dressing, i used 1\4 cup of ranch seasoning (the powder) and it still came out great.

**edit
I've made this recipe a lot of times and it's super yummy. I also was lazy and didn't want to put it on skewers so I just threw it into a wok. The result was a super saucy, great tasting chicken meal that we ate on a bed a rice. A1.

This was absolutely delicious. I didn't have fresh rosemary, so I used dried, but the flavor came through wonderfully. I also used Brianna's Buttermilk Ranch dressing. It's a bit healthier than some of the more known  brands. I left out the worcestershire sauce and black pepper because we don't like them.
I also marinated a red pepper and baby portable mushrooms in balsamic vinegar and olive oil and garlic salt and served alongside a crisp romaine salad. Awesome, easy, delicious dinner!

I must say, this is excellent.  I make my own ranch dressing to use in this recipe.  Usually I just pound out the boneless chicken breast and cook on the indoor or outdoor grill.  I save a bit of the marinade to baste on the breast while cooking.  When I serve this to guests, they love it.

This was an accidental find that turned into one of our favorites.  I wanted to make the Tomato Basil Pasta from this site, and needed a protein to go with it.   After a quick search, I thought I would give this a try.  Perfect Summer combo really.  I cooked this on my indoor grill, and it was perfect.  If anything, I might cut back on the rosemary just a hair, but I probably won't even do that.  Quick and easy, and full of flavor.  This combo will be  regular Summer rotation for us on either the indoor or outdoor grill.  Do yourself a favor and don't skimp with the dried rosemary.  Go fresh for Summer!

I made this last week and again this week.  The family loved it!  The marinade is simple and quick and packed full of flavor.  I added another 1/2 teaspoon of the Rosemary when I made it the second time for a little more flavor.  Can't go wrong with this one!!! Thank you.

Just made it! Love it! Prep was easy and the ingredients called for are not out of the ordinary.  Followed instructions as is except for grilling it.  Still good and will make again!

This was a great date-night meal! I did not have Access to a grill, so I set the conventional to 450, cooked them for just over 20 minutes (rotating and adding more sauce at the 10 minute mark) and these babies came out wonderful! We will definitely be making these again! I suggest adding mixed veggies into the kabobs, adds an extra pop!

This wasn't for me or my family. The ranch gives a weird taste with the lemon, Worcestershire, and Rosemary. I think, if I try it again, I'd use ranch seasoning, no salt, less rosemary, and less oil. I broiled it because I don't have a grill, so maybe that's why I didn't like it? They were juicy, though. I had no issue with it being seasoned and juicy and enough food/marinade. Like I said, if I try it again, I'll make some changes to make it more to my taste.

Love the flavor, but recommend skipping the sugar. Sweet really didn't add to this. If anything I think I'd try a little something spicy. They do work quite well in the oven as suggested, but I found they were done in only about 12 minutes at 450. I'm sure it depends on the size of your chicken cubes.

I did use less salt and oil as some of the other reviews recommend.  I also used a lite Caesar dressing in lieu of ranch. I baked it in the oven with extra sauce.

I actually make this with vegetarian chicken (Quorn chik'n tenders), and it is quickly becoming a favorite! For one bag of Quorn, I use only 1/4 c oil and 1/4 c ranch dressing (I guess mine is technically Ranch dip) and then the rest as noted. I mix everything up together in a bowl, add the "chik'n," then let it chill in the fridge for a few hours before I sautée it in the frying pan. I'm sure it would be delicious grilled, but I just haven't taken the time to do that yet.

This was beyond delicious!  Couldn't decide which ingredient made it the best!  I used cutlets and grilled 10 minutes each side @ 350.  I also punctured the cutlets with a fork and marinated 6 hours.  This will become a staple in our "what's  for dinner?" war chest.

This is an amazing recipe.  The longer you marinate it the better it tastes.  An hour and a half is perfect!  Love it, have made it about 10 times.  It is a definite keeper!

I followed directions exactly except marinated chicken on the skewers placed in glass baking dish.  A little tricky turning over on grill because chicken spins on skewers but the final product was DELICIOUS!   Very moist and flavorful.  I put rice, chicken then reheated leftover marinade on top.  Definitely make this again!

Great recipe! Super easy to make and my family loved it! It tastes so good and when the chicken is grilled just right, the meat is so juicy. All of the flavors are definitely there! I've made this multiple times; totally worth it!

This recipe was spot on!!!! I marinaded the chicken for an hour or so just because and it was awesome.  The chicken was so tender, juicy and tasty. My family loved it and I was so glad to have a new recipe to add to my repotiore.  Thank you so much.  I will make this for parties too because you can skewer the chicken ahead of time and just throw them on the grill when you're ready to eat, easy peezy.  Love it!!!!

I made this with pork tenderloin rather than chicken and it was absolutely divine!  Even my extremely picky father in law liked it so much my mother in law asked for the recipe!!  I also halved the salt (because I have to), halved the sugar because I had made it with chicken before and thought that was enough, otherwise followed the recipe. Warning: the marinade on its own does not look very appetizing, but persevere!  It is delicious!

This is THE BEST CHICKEN I've EVER had! It was amazing by itself as kebobs...and I can hardly wait to have the leftovers in a salad tomorrow! We'll be serving this when we meet my daughter's soon-to-be inlaws when they come for the wedding! It's THAT GOOD!

I used a Greek Yogurt Ranch dressing and cut the oil to 2T, did NOT use sugar. Thought it was excellent.  
We grilled the chicken per recipe and it was very moist and flavorful

These are my go to dish to bring to every bbq I'm invited to. Kids and adults alike swoon over them. They beg me for the recipe. They invite me over again and again.

This was better than to kabobs we were purchasing at the butcher. I used some of the marinade on some squash for the grill and it was also great.

Yum! My daughter requested these get put on regular rotation on our dinner menu. Moist, good flavor and easy!! Just made this again last night. I would give it MORE THAN 5 stars if I could! Better than restaurant. I used chicken thighs this time, left them whole and threaded on a skewer like they  do at the fair.

Fantastic! Chicken takes a long time to marinade. I used this recipe, modifying to my taste of loving rosemary. It's fantastic!!

Amazing!!!!  I know lots of people said these were good but wow.  The chicken was so moist and tender and tasty!! I used low-fat ranch dressing and white wine vinegar and will make the same way next time.  These will be added to our grilling line-up!!! Be sure to use fresh rosemary it makes such a difference.

I made this recipe for my family of six, and the bowl was emptied in the first five minutes!! I would double the recipe if you are making for over 5 people. I added 1/4 cup more olive oil then what was called for, and I brushed olive oil over the chicken on the grill every 2.5 minutes. I also flipped the Kabobs every 2-3 minutes. The chicken had a little less flavor then I was hoping for, so, I would marinade for 2-3 hours in the future. All-in-all this is an amazing recipe!! My family said this is a keeper!! Very good!!!

Very good. Made no changes to original recipe. Might eliminate the vinegar next time. It had a slight tangy taste but over all very tasty and I'll make again! I added green bell peppers and mushrooms as well.

This chicken tastes great! We even had to double the recipe the second time we made it just because we wanted more! I suggest adding some fresh tomatoes or peppers on the kabob to freshen up the flavor. I also suggest marinating it over night and not just for half and hour.

I have made this multiple times.  I don't change a thing, although I do double the marinade.  This comes out so moist on the grill and as other reviewers have stated, it is so delicious over (brown) rice, but I also make this with punched potatoes and the marinade just makes those even better.  The marinade elevates everything you put with it; even roasted veggies.

So, I was skeptical on trying this. Ranch and Rosemary did sound good at all, but since there was a lot of feedback on this I gave it a try. So glad I did! It so good, even the picky eater ate it! One Happy Mom! Thanks for sharing!

This recipe is so simple! Yet it's still soo delicious! I followed this recipe for the most part, except I used vegetable oil instead of olive oil. And I also substituted lime juice for the lemon juice. I served it with chicken, lime, and garlic flavored white rice, and green beans! When I served this to my family, everyone loved it, even my mother (and that's saying something)!! Definitely will be making this again!!

Delicious, healthy and very simple recipe. Made this a couple times and it came out perfect every time.  All my guests were asking for seconds.  I used fat free ranch dressing and added chopped up garlic to the recipe which made it even better. Grilling time was probably more like 15 minutes, but I kept turning the skewers to make the chicken evenly cooked.  This is becoming a staple in my grilling repertoire.

Excellent! Very tender, flavorful and easy to make! The only changes I made were, used 1 tsp of salt instead of 2 and marinated for 1 hour. The recipe is basically perfect as is! Kids loved it, too!

This was a great choice. I marinated the chicken for 2 hours and did not need to add additional sauce. I cooked directly on the grill and turned 4 times at about 5 minute intervals. I used 1/2 the sugar and everything was perfect and tender. I will definitely make this again.

Delicious!  With the exception of getting chicken in marinade before I left for work (12 hour marinade vs 30 minutes) I followed recipe exactly.  I tend to overcook chicken on grill, but this was cooked perfectly.   SO flavorful and tender!  Making today for the second time this week - thanks for the great recipe!

Amazing!! Even the picky 4 year-old liked it! We didn't make the kabob part, but cut into pieces and cooked in a pan inside. Otherwise, we followed the recipe.

This was delicious! I had to sub items out as I didn't have all on hand and it still came out ultra yummy!
- Used dried rosemary
- Omitted salt
- Used lime juice instead of lemons since that's what I had
- Used balsamic vinegar since I didn't have any white
- Used 1/4 tsp Stevia instead of sugar
Will definitely cook again!

This is my family's favorite grilled chicken. I like to marinate it overnight and cutting into kabob size pieces truly does make such a difference. The recipe is perfect. We' e never oiled the grill grate and have never had a problem.

this chicken is delicious! I usually add some dried garlic, paprika,  onion, and cayenne. I have also found that if you only partially grill the chicken , then put it in the oven (with the remainder of the marinade )for the remainder of the cooking time  it is more flavorful and moist.

This chicken was incredibly moist and flavorful. This is now my go to recipe for grilled chicken. I used bacon ranch so I could've done without the salt, but otherwise I wouldn't make any other changes.

Made 2 batches of marinade using 2tsp dried rosemary instead and cut sugar in half... enough marinade for 2kg of chicken breast... pounded to even 3/4 to an inch thick... grilled for about 7min on each side.. meat came out tender and moist...

This has become a summer grill-out favorite in our family!  I use chicken tenderloins instead of threading the chicken onto skewers and I always make extra to top my salad for lunch. I marinate it overnight or at least several hours for the best flavor.  Fresh rosemary is a must!!

This chicken was amazing! I took the suggestion of another reviewer and baked it. I didn't have enough ranch, only about 1/4 cup, so I used about 1/4 cup of blue cheese dressing and 2 tablespoons of Caesar dressing just for fun! Also, I only had apple cider vinegar which did the job just fine. I baked the cut up chicken with the marinade for approximately 25 minutes-I made sure that each piece reached 165 degrees before taking the dish out of the oven. We ate it along with noodles and Alfredo. Will definitely be making this again!

I once used drums sticks instead and I marinated them overnight.  My guests loved it, so did I. This recipe is fantastic! Thank you for sharing it!

What an incredible Dish !!  I use Thin Sliced Chicken Breasts instead of making Kabobs. I let it marinate for 24 hours then grilled the chicken the next day. I grilled Fresh Corn on the cob and Asparagus to accompany the meal. For Leftovers I made mashed potatoes to accompany the remaining chicken with excess sauce and that was just as awesome. Great Summer Evening dish to make when entertaining guests !!

I added more rosemary than called for, as well as extra lemon juice to brighten the flavor. The chicken was moist and flavorful. I also skewered onions between chicken bites. Tasty!

Delicious! As others suggested, I omitted the salt and only did 1/4 cup of oil. Easy marinate and it keeps the chicken nice and moist, not to mention tasty too! I didn't do kabobs, just did whole chicken breasts on the grill and I let the chicken marinate for 10 hours

I made this with only about a lb of chicken tenders that I cut into smaller pieces. I still made the full amount of sauce; the extra would be good for dipping the chicken or marinating veggies. Since I don't have an outdoor grill, I baked them at 350 for 20 min (per some suggestions). It worked well...came out very tender. No color though so I put them on the GF grill for a few minutes. Got some nice grill marks and still tender. Thanks for the recipe, Theresa!

Thought this had a weird combination of ingredients, but I made it as written. I did let it marinate for a couple of hours in the fridge.  Cooked it in a grill pan on stovetop, medium low heat.  Both my husband and I enjoyed it.  Not overwhelmingly flavored, nice and juicy.  Next time, I might let it marinate all day.  Give it a try!

I ran across this, wanting something different with chicken. For over a year now, I have CRAVED this on multiple occasions!!! On the off chance you end up having leftover chicken, the next night saute some onion, garlic, celery, and carrots, add some chicken broth and cooked rice, and voilà! The best chicken and rice soup on the planet!!! If the consistency seems off, I add more ranch and sugar. Absolutely LOVE this chicken!!!

Made this last night for dinner and my husband and I (& our 2 year old) loved it! We're not big on rosemary, so I left that out and added yellow onion to the kabob. This was delicious! A TON of flavor!

My family loves this recipe! Made it tonight and because of tornado watches I had to cook it in the oven at 350 for about 30 minutes. It came out good but we like it much better cooked on the grill. We follow the recipe exactly as listed, serve it with rice and green beans. My kids age 9 and 10 1/2 have eaten at least 2 skewers full every time I make it. My oldest is a very picky eater - all she ever orders out is fried chicken fingers.  I have made this recipes at least 30 times!!!

The roomie and I agreed; this turned out amazing. He requested I make it again and again. Though, as I don't have a grill, I marinated some chicken breast tenderloins in the sauce overnight and then cooked them in a grilling skillet on the stovetop until they were a delicious golden brown. Then I took the leftover marinade and chopped up some vidalia onions to cook up in it until they were nice and soft. They came out great, the roomie even requested seconds on the onions and normally he's not a big fan of them. Will definitely add this to my list of meals to make regularly!

That a great recipe.  I told my friend what i was making and she said everything sounds good except for the ranch.  Since i like ranch and have plenty in the fridge, i used it.  Wow was i surprised.  The chicken was moist and you don't taste the ranch at all.  Very good.  Definitely making it again.

I just tried this recipe and I only had 1tbls of Worcestershire sauce. I let it marinate for 4 hours. Then I threw everything in the skillet and added some spinach and it was Devine. We sopped up the sauce with bread and it tasted like we were eating in an Italian restaurant.  Definitely a keeper.

I made my own ranch dressing and followed the recipe letting it marinade for 1/2 hour.  I made too many kabobs...we gobbled them all up.  Even my finicky eater ate 2!  We had it with a Caesar salad.  First time making kabobs for me.

This is absolutly the best recipe I have ever made off AllRecipes I pair it with Skewered Potatoes also from this site and it is a perfect summer meal without ever heating up your kitchen.  I do not add the optional sugar.

Very good marinade. I used a rotisserie and the chicken came out awesome! I marinated green peppers and onions also and they were delish! I'm planning on using this marinade on roasted potatoes in the future...

My friend raved about it to me and forwarded me the recipe.  It's good.  My husband goes crazy for it.  I would make again, but it's not a dish that WOWs a dinner party.  I made it for 2 dining occasions and both times other dishes were the highlight of the night.  But it is a good recipe for an at home meal.

This was a hit in my house.  We ate all of it in one sitting.  I did make some changes to the recipe.  First I used home made ranch dressing, I added 1 teaspoon of garlic powder, a dash of red crushed peppers. I used 1 tablespoon of lemon juice and then marinated it for 3.5 hours.  I forgot to add oilive oil and it turned out just fine...we just used olive oil spray while cooking it .  The kabobs were not dried and they were delicious

I made this recipe for my family last night.  I used whole chicken breasts instead of kabobs and cooked it at 450 for about 25 minutes.  The chicken was moist and delicious....everyone loved it.  I only gave it 4 stars because we found it was too salty.  I will definitely make again and omit the salt.

Tried this for the first time last week, was looking for a simple chicken kabob recipe.  This was amazing!  My wife loved it and wants me to make it again this week!  definitely worth adding to my weekly recipes!

Bomb chicken and real quick to make. I didn't mess with the recipe except I used a lot more rosemary and lemon. Check the type of ranch you use. Don't just pick the cheapest ranch since it's only for marinating. The type of ranch changes the taste a lot. I've added this to fettucini alfredo and I've had it with hummus and pita bread. Either way, the chicken is always dank!

Different, easy, and tasty. I slow cooked it and then broiled the chicken after it was slow cooked. I'll make it again soon!

I ended up leaving out the rosemary and I used chicken breast tenderloins.  I ended making the marinade and throwing it in the freezer, when I took it out, I decided to make chicken salad with it, cooked the chicken, then emptied most of the sauce and turned the heat on high  to crisp it a little bit, it came out awesome!!

Wonderful!

I made sure to buy fresh rosemary from the produce department. I had dried, but I just didn't think that would do the recipe justice.  I marinated mine for about 5 hours (I always marinate longer than recipes say, just a personal preference).

I didn't bother putting the chicken on skewers, and I just cooked it on the stovetop for about 14 minutes.

I will admit-I was skeptical at first. There was a lot of marinade in the pan when I first put the chicken in, and I was worried I would have a big gloppy mess on my hands. Luckily, the marinade cooks down.  The chicken ended up being fantastic. Although I made it in the winter, it tasted like spring to me, and I can't wait to make it as a light dinner when the weather gets warmer :)

Also, I made extra and plan on throwing it into a pan of fettuccine alfredo later this week. So excited!

This recipe was delicious! My fiance and I don't have a grill right now, so we baked this instead. I cubed the chicken and put it into a baking dish. I then covered it with the marinade. Then I simply baked the chicken at 450 degrees for 20 minutes. I served the chicken over a bed of rice. One thing to note- use 1/2 the recommended olive oil. If you use the full amount, it turns out way too oily! Other than that, a GREAT dish that both my fiance and I loved!

Amazing! This is my go-to recipe when I grill chicken. My preference is to substitute the lemon juice and white vinegar with balsamic vinegar. It gives it a nice glaze. Set aside some of the marinade to drizzle the chicken with when finished. Delicious!!!

Substituted some of the chicken with shrimp, added onion and peppers to the skewers and grilled these babies up with some elote on the side. My small group of friends ate without speaking a single word, a humble cook's greatest compliment.

Was not impressed with the flavor, too "wangy" for me.  Chicken was not at all tender. Will not try this again.

Kamado Joe, Big Green Egg, and other kamado style cooker folks out there. 500 degrees, direct 3.5 minutes, flip, 3.5 minutes. Done and oh so good. Spray your grate with cooking spray or oil it beforehand. A++

I love the flavor of this marinade.  I prefer using thighs, but have made them with both thighs and breasts to be a little healthier.  I follow the recipe almost exactly, less sugar though.  I also have let it marinate for several hours. I think cutting back on the oil would work as others have suggested.  This is a keeper.

We love this chicken so much I make it nearly once a week.  I follow the recipe exactly except I use light ranch dressing.  I would like to state that using fresh rosemary really makes a big difference...I do use dried sometimes, but it's always way better when I use fresh. Thanks for sharing this recipe, it's so good and I plug it into my weekly menus all the time :)

Made this for a crowd and they loved it. My husband isn't a big fan of chicken - finds it dry - but not this recipe, chicken was very moist and flavourable. Very tasty and virtually no work. Instead of making kabobs I just cut each breast into 3 pieces and BBQ'd.

Wow. Just Wow. It's such an odd combo that if it didn't have so many great reviews I would probably not have looked twice. I used 2 tsp dried rosemary and cut back on the salt, and I didn't feel like grilling so I cut the chicken into strips, marinated and then baked it. This was fantastic and my husband raved about it.

This turned out a lot better than I expected.  Now I marinate almost all of my chicken in the mixture.  I reduce the oil by half to cut down on the fat.  Very tasty.

Super easy and super good.  I marinated chunks of chicken in the marinade for half a day then cooked on stovetop.

We had very high hopes for these kebabs, especially after reading so many positive reviews, but the marinade just didn't blow us away. It tastes like something you might get at Olive Garden - nothing wrong with that, just not to our personal tastes.

I really liked this recipe. Very easy to prepare, and the chicken turns out super tender melt in the mouth, with subtle flavors that blend wonderfully. I had it marinating overnight. I used peppercorn ranch because this is what I had in the fridge, substituted dried rosemary for the fresh one and vegetable oil for the olive oil because I don't like the olive oil flavor. Rosemary flavor was very subtle. I suspect fresh herbs would give more pronounced flavor. Next time I make this recipe, I will make sure to buy fresh rosemary. After reading other reviews, I halved the salt, and I think it was the right decision. This recipe will definitely be added to my regular rotation!

Wow!!! These were to die for.  My family really enjoyed these Kabobs.  I followed the recipe almost exactly, except I marinated mine overnight in a zip loc bag, and grilled them in a griddle pan.  The chicken was very moist and juicy.  It was a really big hit with my 10 and 13 yr old girls.

Fantastic. Marinated overnite in a ziploc. Cooked half on skewers and half on Rosmary stems.  Yummy. I did discover its easier to poke the hole in the chicken before putting it on the stem.  I followed the recipe exactly and will be making this again.  Everyone gave rave reviews, even the kids.

Incredible taste! Wow! My family raved about this - they said it was like "company dinner". :) I baked the chicken on skewers in the oven for 20 mins at 350F and then broiled them another 5-10 minutes, turning once, to give 'em a little 'char' taste. I removed the sauce after baking and served it over rice and broccoli as other reviewers recommended - very tasty!
I reduced the olive oil to 1/4 cup, the salt to 1 teaspoon and it tasted great! Highly recommend this one - you will be impressed!

I made this and didn't have any fresh rosemary, so had to use dried.  It was very good even with the dried.  My toddler loved it too and so did the DH.

We absolutely loved it!! I usually like to try a recipe first, before I serve it for company, but did not have time. No regrets!!! They all thought it was delicious and very tender!! We barbecued it on foil instead of directly on gill, as I was not sure if they would dry out. They were so tender that I would try it next time directly on the grill to see how they turn out that way. Fantastic!!

This recipe was absolutely delicious, and better yet.. so simple to make!  I marinated mine for 2 days and it was well worth the wait, they were full of flavor.  Also, I cubed my chicken when it was only about half defrosted, as it is much easier to cut it into nice cubes when still partially frozen.  I cut up some green pepper and onion and made a couple of skewers of those as well as a nice side dish.  Highly recommend this recipe!

One of my favorite marinades so far.  We grill with this and use whole skinless chicken breasts, don't always need the skewers.  Made many times and love it.  Thank You.

I just made this as the recipe said and it was delicious!!  My son and husband went for 2nds and 3rds!!  My son said, "Mom, are you going to make these more often?  I hope so."  They were tender, juicy, and very flavorful.  I guess I did made a couple changes:  I made the kabobs first, then marinated them on the sticks.  Also I omitted the salt.  Added some cauliflower rice for a side dish.  Delish!  Thanks for the recipe.

I loved this recipe!  The flavor is terrific and the chicken so moist.  I made these for a birthday party and expected to have lots of left over.  They gobbled them up and I had two sticks left!  I marinated them overnight in the fridge and the flavor and moistness of the chicken was terrific!  Definitely a repeat!!

I make the recipe as it is, other than omitting the sugar.  My family loves it and I think it is one of my very favorite things to eat.  I make extra marinade for basting the kabobs on the grill.  I also add yellow squash, peppers - any color, onions and mushrooms to the chicken in the marinade, and thread those onto the skewer as well.  Yummy!

I was unfortunately unimpressed, the favor is fine, but not to the strength I was looking for and I definitely added more rosemary and Worcestershire sauce. not bad but not amazing

This was tasty, but pretty bland. My family enjoys foods that have tons of flavor, and this just didn't cut it. The sauce was delicious, but even after marinating it just didn't hold the flavor like I was hoping. Next time I will have to reserve some  sauce for dipping and then I think this will be a winner!

LOVE THESE!!! I've made these at least 10 times. They come out very tender and very flavorful. The longer you marinade the better, but I've marinaded them for as little as 20 min and they were still wonderful. Great for picnics or just for dinner with something simple like a baked potato which you can also throw on the grill in foil. :) I didn't find a huge difference between fresh rosemary and dried either. Both are good if you don't have fresh.

Just tried this today after being intrigued by the ingredients.  I followed the recipe exactly as written (including the sugar) and was floored by how delicious and juicy the chicken was.  I had almost 4 pounds of cubed chicken breast and had plenty of marinade.  I usually prefer thighs for grilling, because breast meat can get so dry, but these were perfect when cooked 6 minutes on both sides.  I don't know if it's the Worcestershire, the ranch or the rosemary, but the taste was luscious.  Big hit.  Try it.  You won't be sorry.

This was great!  I did cut the salt and oil in half and left the breasts intact.  I was worried about the amount of Worchestershire, but it worked.  I will be making ths again!

My husband (who gripes about eating chicken) loved this. It was easy for him to grill; I doubled the recipe for the sauce and used it for basting. We grilled veggie chunks - zucchini, green pepper, cherry tomatoes, and basted them with the sauce, too. I served this with the Zucchini-Cornbread Casserole as did another cook, and it was fantastic. Chopping all the chicken took time, so I might try cutting it into strips next time.

My whole family loves this easy dish. I don't worry about all the oil since most of the marinade is discarded. I like to serve the kebabs over a rice pilaf with grilled zucchini on the side... great summer dish!

Phenomenal recipe!!! I made the marinade as directed above, then made a basting batch without the salt, and continued to baste during the grilling. My family likes 'well done' edges on the grill, so I turned up the flames, and these came out beautifully. After having these for supper, my husband stated, "I wouldn't be disappointed if we had these for breakfast tomorrow too." Easy recipe, normal ingredients, A KEEPER.  THANK YOU SO MUCH!!

This was amazing!  I made a couple of changes because I didn't have all the ingredients on hand.  Instead of rosemary I used thyme and instead of lemon I used lime juice.  It turned out great and I can't wait to make it again following the recipe exactly.

Really delicious.  I used half the olive oil, omitted the salt, and didn't add the sugar.  Used rosemary from my garden.  Marinaded after I cubed and skewered the chicken and left overnight.  We put them in the smoker for 20 minutes and finished on the grill.  Got rave reviews from everyone at our July 4th BBQ and had many requests for the recipe.

Chicken was moist and tender, but flavor was "off".  Next time I'll try without the Worcestershire Sauce.

I used roughly 2 tablespoons of the dry rosemary and lime instead of lemon juice.  I used a little less chicken because that was all I had on hand.  It was a really flavorful marinade, I will definitely be using it in the future!

Great! I used white cooking wine - Chablis, instead of vinegar and  1 rounded Tablespoon dried Rosemary/garlic seasoning mix instead of fresh Rosemary. Also marinated chunks of yellow gold potatoes (separately). I added the potatoes, red onion and mushrooms to the kabobs. I'll make it again!

This marinade is great. Make sure to mince the rosemary really fine or else you might get an overpowering bite. We added zucchini, squash, and onion with the chicken and grilled it all but the chicken did taste better than the veggies.

EXCELLENT marinade! I left the chicken soaking for probably 4 hours and about 2 hours with slightly pre-cooked potatoes, onions and raw green peppers. The meat was put on skewers for grilling and I went ahead and finished roasting the veggies (potatoes/onions first for 15-20 minutes and added peppers a little later for less cooking). Because we got distracted, I ended up taking the chicken off the skewers and just adding it to the roasting vegetables for about the last 10 minutes. It was wonderful and we can't thank you enough for the recipe! (Oh, I did omit the salt and don't feel like we missed anything.)

My son said the best chicken he's ever had, we were snacking on it all night long.  I made the original version, and another version where I added garlic powder and Sriracha chile sauce.  I loved both, but I think I'll make with my add ons from now on.

My neighbors and my family LOVED this! It will definitely be an annual 4th of July recipe! yummmmmmm!  I tried it with whole chicken breasts, and it was not as good.  The bites of chicken need to marinate for better flavor throughout.

**EDIT** LOVE. THIS. SAUCE.  I think it's the worchestershire that brings it over the top!  Don't leave out the sugar and use a good brand of ranch dressing (I used Ken's regular ranch.)  I don't think it's too salty if you don't salt the raw chicken first...bone-in chicken changes the taste so I prefer boneless chicken breasts.  I did cut down on the oil a bit. **EDIT**

Wow this was good!  I used the grill basket and saved the marinade to go on top of rice.  I'd like to try it on skewers as well to get more of a grilled taste.  I only used 1 tsp of salt as some suggested and used dried Rosemary, but otherwise I followed the recipe as written.  I'll make this again and again I'm sure.  Thank you!

Excellent recipe. Made for a BBQ family get together, and all loved it from the 2 year old through the adults.

I love this recipe, and have made it several times over the years. The only change I made was by accident, but it was so good that I left it that way. I was new to growing and using herbs. What I thought was rosemary turned out to be lavender. (I even stuffed it in my Thanksgiving turkey before learning it wasn't rosemary.) I serve the chicken on my new fancy circular skewers with lavender mint fingerling potatoes and fresh sautéed green beans. Now that I have a new ice cream maker, I think I'll try lavender honey ice cream for dessert!

My family really enjoyed the taste of this marinade.  We used it on boneless chicken breasts. It's something different from the norm.  Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe was delicious!  The chicken was moist and had lots of flavor!  I used chicken tenders, skewered them and cooked them on my indoor grill since the weather wasn't cooperating.  If they were this good cooked indoors, I can only imagine how fantastic they would be on the bbq.  I'll definitely use the bbq next time. Thanks for the recipe!

We weren't very fond of this.  Maybe it was the Worcestershire sauce or maybe the rosemary but I think we'll go back to our old standby of olive oil, lemon juice and garlic.

this  recipe was wonderful!! i marinated them in a plastic bag in the fridge and forgot about them when friends asked us to go out with them.. i cooked them the next day. They were moist,  tender, VERY flavorful!! I used chicken tenders.. left them in one piece and threaded them on skewers to grill. I used bamboo skewers that I soaked in leftover lemon-lime soda. The only substitution i made was  fresh lime juice for the lemon juice and i used only half the sugar. 

Will be making these regularly

LOVE THIS!  I did as others advised and changed a few things.  I omitted the sugar and salt.  I also omitted the vinegar.  I did add Red Wine to the marinade...we loved the extra boost of flavor.  I also added fresh Basil from my garden.  After washing, drying and chopping...I sprinkled the Basil on top of the chicken skewers and Vege Skewers during the cooking process.  YUMMY! :)  Thanks for the recipe.

This is a good recipe, but I didn't taste the ranch dressing nor the rosemary flavor in the cooked chicken. Perhaps if I would have marinated the chicken longer than 30 min the tastes may have come through. Given the high rating, I was a bit disappointed. It is a good recipe but I don't think I'll be making it again. Thank you none-the-less.

These were really tender, but considering the number of ingredients in the marinade, I expected them to have more flavor. All I could really taste was the rosemary but some bites also had a bit of a mild sweetness. I used only about half of the sugar, and I'm glad I did, because I know that sugar in a marinade (or BBQ sauce) will make something burn pretty quickly on the grill. I'll probably make them again because my husband liked them. And again, they are VERY tender.

We made this as is except we grilled the chicken breasts whole instead of putting them on kabobs and it was delicious.  My kids told me to go on here to rate it 5 stars.  We have rosemary growing like weeds in our backyard so I love to find recipes that use it!

Fabulous. I tried the first piece of chicken while working the grill and have to admit that I didn't want to bring any into the house so I could have them all to myself.

These were good.  Will make again. The ranch flavor isn't too overpowering so it isn't like you're just dipping chicken fingers into ranch, which is a good thing.  It was too cold out for grilling so I put them in the oven to broil.  I also marinated some grape tomatoes and pieces of yellow bell peppers in worcestershire sauce and threaded them on as well for some color and extra flavor.

I cut chicken breasts into strips and marinated for 2 hours and these were AWESOME.  Grill on High for 3 minute, turn and grill the other side 3 more minutes and then turn it down low for another 3 or until the internal temp reaches 180.  This will be a regular in our house going forward.  (Note - i took the suggestion of others and decreased the oil and made ranch from a packet to lower the fat using olive oil mayo and lower fat milk)

Left over chicken makes THE BEST chicken salad ever.  Just dice up the left overs, add your mayo to taste, and it's AWESOME chilled.   Thanks!

This was an absolute hit among my family. I was off for MLK Day, so I thought I would make this. I let the chicken marinate for 3 hours and it turned out perfectly. I didn't cut down on the salt or the sugar, but I served it with rice (to which I didn't use any salt in the making of). STRONGLY RECOMMEND!!

Most tender chicken I've ever made. Ready in no time at all and very flavorful. Put a grape tomato or some veggie in the middle of each piece of chicken to ensure not to crowd the chicken too close together.  If chicken too close together, they take longer to cook or, like in my case once, didn't get cooked all the way and I had to put some of the pieces back on the grill.

Made as is and it was fabulous!  I used chicken tenders since that is what my husband bought, and we marinated it for 2-3 hours.  This recipe definitely will be used often by our household!

Chicken is moist and flavorful.  Note: must watch what brand of salad dressing you choose as some make a very salty dish.

This is a must try recipe. The whole family loves this chicken including the kids 3 and 5yrs. My husband couldn't believe what was in it. Best part the ingredients are usually things at have at home. I use dry rosemary because it's on had and you can still taste the flavor. This is my go to recipe when I get tired of the plain grilled chicken my husband loves.

My husband love these chicken kabobs! I only did half of what the recipe called for (with only used 2 chicken breasts) and it was delicious. They were a bit messy, but well worth the mess. We are having friends over next weekend, and my husband requested we serve these to our friends. Can't wait!

Very good flavor! I changed one thing, but followed everything else. I didn't have fresh rosemary on hand, so I used dried rosemary. I let it marinate for a little less than 2 hours, and baked the dish for under 40 mins. Next time I'll try to have fresh rosemary, but I think the dried worked very well!

Really good. My family (including our 2 year old) enjoyed these and the prep was pretty easy. I cooked them for a bit longer on my natural gas grill (20 minutes) turning once...and they came out perfect. I also cooked a skewer of bell peppers and onions to compliment the chicken. That made for a great combo. Give these a shot. It's an excellent recipe.

This chicken was great!  My picky 12-year old twins even asked for seconds.  I did not actually cut the chicken into kabob pieces. I pounded the chicken breasts and marinated them for a couple of hours.  WONDERFUL FLAVOR!

Delicious!!!  I used bone-in chicken breasts and baked this in the oven....tender, juicy, and great.  I felt it was just a bit too salty, but not intolerable.  I'll just cut down on the salt a little next time.

My 13 year old daughter wanted to make dinner...and found this recipe.  She made it all by herself and I have to say this was one of the best new recipes we've tried in a while.  Easy, relatively quick and so much flavour!  Will definately make again.  We served with "burnt butter rice" (also a recipe found on this site), and a salad...  yum!

This was really good. I marinated the chicken for about 5 hours. Really simple and so yummy.

I marinated the chicken overnight  - cut back on the oil and salt. I was going to grill it for my company but things got hectic and I ended up baking it (in the marindae) at 350 for about 30 minutes. The chicken was moist but not that flavorful - it was good but not exceptional as many have stated. Next time I will grill it to see if it makes the 5 stars.

What a great recipe! I did not have rosemary so I used thyme. I also added crushed red pepper as I like a little kick. I served with brown rice with cilantro and sauteed green beans with olive oil, garlic and lemon zest...perfect healthy meal. Thanks for sharing the recipe.

the kabobs did not have that much taste.  Next time I will marinate thighs in a pan and then bake  the entire dish in the oven.

My husband loved this recipe, but I just didn't care for the flavor.  I will give it credit for producing really juicy, tender chicken.  He would give it 5, I would give it 3, so I gave it a 4.  I'll make it again, just not for myself.

This makes delicious, moist chicken kabobs, but have to be careful because my husband always thinks they cook faster than they really do, and we've had a couple thicker pieces that were underdone.  Taste great on salad or served along baked potatoes, or rice & a veggie!

If you have the opportunity to cook these over a cherry or apple-wood open fire -DO IT!  I used my own ranch "packet" recipe, followed the directions, and cooked over an open fire and WOW!  Very good.

These were really really tasty!  I couldn't find my skewers so just sauteed them in a pan with some of the sauce.  My only issue was it was way too salty.  Perhaps it's because I let my chicken marinate 2 hours instead of just 30 minutes...  I don't know but when I make this again, I'm at least halving (maybe more) the salt.  Thanks for the recipe!

I marinated some bell pepper (various shades), onion, mushroom and threaded them on with the chicken.  I did omit the sugar and halved the salt and did 1/3 cup of olive oil as was suggested by a few others.  IT WAS FABULOUS!  My picky kids even loved the veggie with the chicken, and my husband asked me to put it in "the rotation".

I really liked these!  Next time I will use much less oil.  I left out salt as always.  1 tsp dried rosemary, and about 1 tsp of sugar.  It made tons of marinade, so I dumped in some squash.  I think it would be excellent on roasted potatoes, too.  ETA: Made a second time with 1/2 the oil--worked fine.  Dumped about 2/3 of marinade on chicken, and rest on 3 medium potatoes chunked and it was great roasted about 450 for 40 min.

Amazing!!!!  I tripled the sauce and marinated some veggies as well (red potatoes, squash, and mushrooms).  I marinated everything for several hours and it tasted wonderful!  I took the advice of other reviews and softened my potatoes (cut up and microwaved them in an inch of water until a little soft) before marinating them.  This was the best dish I've had on allrecipes by far!!!!

Love this recipe! I chose to make this my first time cooking a meal for my parents and sisters and they thought it was wonderful. It was just what I was looking for. My only critique is that it was a bit salty, the 2 teaspoons of salt weren't necessary, at least not all. I'll use my own judgement next time, but loved it nonetheless; I'll definitely be making it again!

I made these kabobs 3 weeks ago and am making again tomorrow for a party because they are amazing.  I add mushrooms, red pepper and onion to the kabobs. Double the sauce and marinade the chicken in 1/2, use the other 1/2 while grilling. Important.

I've made this many times and never had any leftovers. I didn't like skewering them ( slimy feeling to me) so tried just marinating large pieces and grilling but it wasn't the same. I recommend skewering, it's worth it.

I made these for a friend's birthday party. My niece and nephews loved them; as did everyone at the party. I wasn't crazy about them, hence the four stars.

My son would give this a 5 but he isn't posting so I am giving it a 4. He thought it was the best chicken he had ever eaten. I thought it was very tasty. I made a couple of changes. I used 1/2 olive oil, 1/2 canola. Canola has a slightly higher smoke point and I don't use my expensive olive oil for grilling, I save it for dishes where I can taste the flavor of the oil. Also, I did not add salt, I felt that is way too much salt for any dish and the ranch already had enough salt in it. I will be making this next weekend for a family gathering. Thanks!

I took this to a bbq and while people liked it they didn't rave about it.  Granted it's not bad, it's just not great.  It's definitely an alternative to your standard chicken kabob.  I made the recipe as directed and let the chicken marinate for 4 hours, skewered the chicken, poured the remaining marinade on the chicken and put in the fridge for another 5 hours.

Delicious!  There are no left-overs when I marinade the chicken using this recipe.  I've never added the rosemary - simply because I don't ever have it on hand - but the recipe is still amazing without it.

Chicken came out very tasty and moist.  I think the longer you marinate the chicken the better the flavour.  I have also done this with whole chicken breasts marinated over night.  Great for entertaining!

I've made this several times now and it is a great recipe. The marinade is delicious. The only change I've made is reducing the oil to 1/4 C and omitting the sugar. I let them marinade all day then skewer them with some veggies and grill them. Tasty and easy. I also use chicken tenderloins. I just use my kitchen shears to cut them into chunks, and they are a snap to skewer. Great recipe!

This was a nice change of pace from my usual marinades! I made extra marinade and saved about half a cup of it beforehand so I could have dipping sauce. That really seemed to up the "tasty quotient", according to my household! 

I used whole boneless skinless chicken breasts, just pierced them heavily with a fork then marinated in a ziploc bag overnight.

Very moist and flavorful.  I used rice vinegar, half the salt and olive oil as others suggested.  Marinated about 45 min while preparing other food. Half the chicken I put on kabobs the other half in a lined grilling pan, both were fine.  Everyone enjoyed it.

Tasty.  A nice alternative to the flavors we usual go towards when making kabobs.  This will definitely become a standard recipe that we make often.

Made as written, except husband too tired to heat up the grill so I improvized as cooked chicken in the wok.  Really nice flavor!  A bit salty so will cut back on the salt next time - and there WILL be a next time!

Definitely five stars!  This chicken is so good!  I made it how written once, and also used blue agave nectar instead of sugar the other time and you can't tell the difference.  I used Costco's one and only Greg's ranch and it was delicious.  It's now our favorite chicken marinade!  We didn't use skewers, just put them on the grill.  Also, when I put the chicken in the marinade i jabbed the chicken with forks so the marinade would soak into the chicken.  Also used garlic salt instead of salt.   So moist! Thanks for the recipe!

I hesitated to make this recipe.  I was afraid that the ranch flavor would be over powering but it was not.  The flavor of this chicken was excellent!!  It is my husbands favorite chicken dish now. 

MY TIPS:  I used dried rosemary leaves as I had no fresh on hand and it was delicious!  I pounded my chicken breast  very thin and marinated it for about 3 hours.  Pounding the chicken thin is key.  It takes up the flavors wonderfully.  I didn't skewer mine.  I just grilled the chicken breasts as is.

Negative: Add the remaining marinade to the rice sparingly.  It can be a bit strong.

I thought the ingredients were strange & the marinade looks gross mixed up, but these were FANTASTIC!  Either make more sauce to serve with as dip or mariade using 1/2 and keep other 1/2 to serve with the chicken.  Good stuff :)

These were delicious. I cut the oil in half like a lot of others suggested and used light Hidden Valley ranch to make it a little bit healthier. Will make again for sure!

fantastic! i didn't add worcestershire sauce, just because i didn't have any, and it was fine.  i also don't have a grill, so i baked it in the oven uncovered for 30 minutes at 400. lastly, wanted to serve this with vegatables, so i mixed a bag of frozen califlower in with the chicken and sause and popper it all together in the oven.  because i left it uncovered, the califlower got a bit roasted, which was so good.

These were absolute amazing. I made them for my friends and at first I thought that it would be to much, but they could not get enough. The only thing that I did different from the recipe was I left it in the marinade for a couple hours. I think the next time I try this recipe I'll do it up the night before and see if it taste better after marinading longer.

This was a very flavorful recipe and I highly recommend this to anyone. I ended up using red onions, green peppers and grape tomatoes along with 3-4 pieces/chunks of chicken on each skewer which was delicious.

Made this for my brothers, sisters, and their spouses (10 in all).  Doubled this recipe and ALL said this was a keeper!  Will omit the salt, reduce the sugar.

I omitted the sugar, used a package of ranch dressing mix, and dry rosemary.  Next time I will try with a little less salt. Excellent!

My son (he's 13) and I loved this, but my husband did not like it at all.  I followed the directions, except I did not cut the chicken into cubes, left them whole.  And I marinaded them for about 4 hrs.  Thanks for the recipe.

Even my EXTREMELY picky boyfriend ate this! I made the marinade and let whole chicken breasts marinate for about 3 hours before baking at 400 for 25-30 min. Very moist and great with baked potatoes!

Excellent - tender and moist.   Followed recipe exactly but cooked boneless chicken breasts rather than kabobs.  Next time will try kabobos with veggies, etc.  Thanks for a great recipe.  This is a keeper.  Note:  I buy the dry Hidden Valley in bulk at Sams and make the ranch dressing by the quart - cheaper and always have enough on hand.

DELICIOUS!!! I reduced the oil to 1/4 cup and used dried rosemary b/c that's what I had on hand. We don't have a grill b/c we are in an apartment w/ no access to outside. So I cooked in oven as suggested by other reviewers at 425 for 25 mins (cooked in the marinade sauce) and it turned out GREAT!! Served over rice as another reviewer did and it was wonderful w the "sauce" and chicken. Next time will add peppers and mushrooms, and onions.

I just bought a grill and this was the first recipe I cooked on it. WOW! I'm so impressed! I only made one change, though. I added bacon as suggested in  "Bacon Ranch Chicken Skewers" another recipe found on this site. My family loved it!! I will definitely be making this recipe again.

OMG!!! This is definately a keeper! I cut oil to 1/4 cup. Used buttermilk ranch (that's what I had), and rice vinegar (that's what I had). I also cooked on stove top grill pan. Cut chicken into strips. Served with couscous and broccoli. Will reserve marinade for couscous next time. Wonderful moist, flavorful chicken. Definately use fresh rosemary. Will definately serve this again!! Yummo!!

This was my boyfriend and I's first attempt at grilling, and this turned out really good. I didn't make the chicken into kabobs and just left it as breasts. I added a splash more lemon juice and a little bit more black pepper. I used dried rosemary and half the amount of sugar. The chicken got a little dry, which was probably just a result of our inexperience at grilling. Overall, it was good though! We'll try it again.

GREAT recipe!!! My whole family loved them. Not even one piece of chicken left. My 2 and 5 year olds are usually very picky. But they loved them. I used red and green peppers on some of them. Can't wait to make these again!

Very good marinade.  The sauce was nice and thick and stayed on the chicken well on the grill.  I may cut the oil a little bit but great the first time as is.  

I didn't have fresh rosemary so used dried and ground up in my spice grinder.    I used 3/4 tablespoon ground dried rosemary for this.

These are delicious even the kids loved them. I tasted the marinade and thought 'oh goodness that's salty' but after cooking them it wasn't to salty for us, it was just right.

I have a picky (adult!) daughter who does not eat red meat or dark meat chicken.  She loves this recipe!  Very easy to prepare, and the entire family loves then.  The rosemary is delicious.

Used 4 large chicken breasts, pounded.  Subbed thyme for the rosemary and skipped the sugar.  Marinated in fridge for 6 hours.  Delicious and tender.  We all loved it and the neighbors even commented on how good it smelled!

I love this recipe!  My sister made it for me about a year ago and I decided to try it myself and both my boyfriend and I loved it.  I added about half a tablespoon of soysauce and left out the sugar, but I stuck pretty close to the recipe otherwise.  Thanks!

Absolutely love this recipe and so does my husband! Easy to make and I don't change a thing except using dried rosemary and no sugar.  It's so delicious and very tender. We make it at least twice a month! Thanks Theresa Spencer for posting this!

Love these kabobs. I've also made with chicken strips and marinated overnight for more tender chicken. Really great summer recipe!

Excellent and great for experimenting! I didn't have any ranch, but I did have some blue cheese dressing! Took a bit of the dressing and the Worcestershire sauce and tasted them together...I thought, "This could work." My husband isn't a fan of blue cheese, but he loved this! Look forward to trying out the orig. recipe though :)

I have made this twice now and really like it.  Instead of kabobs, you can simply lay them on tin foil on a cookie sheet and broil.

This recipe seems too simple to be as good as it turns out. I seared and grilled our kabobs for about 8 minutes. They turned out so moist! Try soaking your kabob sticks in water to prevent them from catching on fire.

This recipe was a hit...  Didnt have lemon juice or vinegar on hand so I used 1tbs fresh squeezed lime juice and used red wine vinegar.  Tasted amazing!

Only two stars for this recipe. It was easy to prepare and I had all the ingredients on hand. I did not make the kabobs but instead marinated and then baked boneless chicken breasts. Otherwise, I followed the recipe.  The chicken was nice and moist and I did like the rosemary a lot. The family said it was 'okay'. The sauce, mediocre in flavor, was off-colored beige and not visually appetizing. Therefore the two stars.  I might try this again (it never hurts to give something another go) but I will grill it as the recipe states and see if that makes enough of a difference to keep this recipe on hand.  Thanks for posting--it is always fun to try new dishes.

Omg foodgasm!!!!!!!  This recipe is incredible!  I wanted to teach my boyfriend how to cook since he'd never cooked anything that didn't come from a box and since he loves ranch I chose this for his first recipe and we were both blown away by it.  He was very proud of himself and wants to try cooking more.

I followed the recipe exactly (well, I did use lowfat Ranch), and it was delicious! Very tender and flavorful. I've made it twice now, and my daughter and husband love it too.

Edit: This works well in the oven, too. It's even more flavorful.

Very good!!!  Had these last night and I thought the sauce would be weird or too salty, but it wasn't.  Had great flavor, I love Rosemary on chicken.  Would have loved to see tips on how to wrap the chicken on the kabobs though.

This is by far one of the best marinades I've found. I actually haven't tried it on kabobs, but it tastes wonderful when used to marinade chicken breast before grilling. The chicken always turns out extremely tender and delicious.

This is always a hit whenever I make it and is now a mainstay at the 4th of July bash.  I cut the pounded chicken breasts in tenderloin style strips before marinating, always use chopped fresh rosemary and Ken's buttermilk ranch dressing. The strips are easy to cook on the grill in no time, and IF there are leftovers they're just as good the next day. Even the picky eaters go for this chicken !  I have frozen the marinated strips in a zip-lock bag along with the marinade and this works great too !

Wonderful chicken kabobs!  I cut down a little on the olive oil - just 1/4 of a cup and only used 1 tsp of salt.  I added bell pepper and onion to the kabobs and they were delicious!!

After making this recipe, I realized I don't like rosemary. I baked it instead of grilling and it was kind of bland for me. I had to add garlic salt and more lemon juice. I think I'll make this again without the rosemary, maybe with cilantro.

We made this for our Labor Day BBQ, and they were fabulous. Best kabobs I've ever eaten. The chicken was so tender and juicy and the flavor was amazing. This one is definitely a kepper.

Not that you need another rave review, but these were fantastic.  All four of us liked them and that's an accomplishment these days!  Followed the recipe to a "T" and was surprised at how much flavor the chicken had after marinating for only 30 mins.

Everyone we've served this to LOVED it. My dad does not like rosemary, so I use basil on his, but the rosemary taste is not strong at all. We love this marinade on veggie kabobs too...simple side dish for this chicken. It's in our regular rotation on our menu for sure! Thanks so much for posting this delicious recipe.

Delicious chicken! I used half the oil, omitted the salt entirely, and marinated for 1.5 hours. I bet it would be even better marinated even longer.

I was looking for a good chicken recipe to serve at my cookout.  I too usually try out recipes beforehand but didn't have time, so I was a bit apprehensive to try a never-made recipe on guests but it was actually very good.  I doubled the recipe and it was just the right amount for 12 chicken breasts.  I only used 1/2 the oil, sugar and salt that the recipe called for, however, next time I will make the recipe as stated.  I also marinated the chicken for 5 hours.  It had a very nice flavor and had a nice aroma as it was being grilled.

I was looking for something different last night and gave this a try.  I didn't marinate, but instead basted the sauce on the chicken as it grilled.  Absolutely fabulous! The whole family devoured it.  What a tasty change!  Definately adding this to my dinner rotation.

This was Soooo good! Made it for company and I usually try recipes out b4 I use them on people, but didn't do that this time. Everyone loved it. Chicken was very moist and tender. I love things saucy and was wondering if I would need to make sauce for the side to eat with the chicken. Didn't need any extra at all. Was very good and pretty easy to make. Will be making this regularly for bbq's...I just halved the oil and omitted the salt. Marinated about 6 hrs. Yummmm!

Made this last night !  OH my goodness !!!
I made it exactly to recipe, my only regret is 
that I didn't double the recipe ~ my sons and husband inhaled that chicken, leaving me only about two bites :-)
The meat was juicy, packed with flavor, and tender, and the men told me to give it 5 stars, which it richly deserves !!!!

I grilled these last night, they were wonderful!  I didn't use any sugar and used half the salt. Next time I'll leave the salt out altogether.  I didn't have any olive oil on hand so I used Canola oil and marinated 24 hours. The chicken was so moist and delicious!  Thank you for sharing!!!

After reading so many 5 star reviews I was excited to try this recipe.  I often cook with fresh rosemary and I love kabobs so I thought this would be a winner.  I was so disappointed, the flavor was ok but nothing great.  I would have preferred plain chicken to this marinade.

This recipe was amazing!!  I used only a 1/4 cup olive oil as suggested in another review, otherwise followed the rest of the recipe!  We did ours in strips and marinated for 1 1/2 hours and they turned out great!  As leftovers, I used them on a salad.  Yummy!!  I'll be giving out this recipe!

We used this recipe to marinate chicken breasts and then grill.  We were only able to marinate for about 3 hrs before grilling and the chicken was excellent, great taste.  Next time we will marinate for longer.  We have found another favorite that we could use every couple of weeks.

Made this several times now.  These are the best Kabobs ever, so tender.  I am not a big fan of rosemary, but it was not overpowering, that my kids love them too.  Will continue to make these.  I have even let them sit in the marinade overnight to make it easier to put together after work the next day.  I use homemade ranch- they Hidden Valley ranch dressing mix recipe- so good.

Followed recipe almost to the tee except I only had dried whole rosemary on hand and I marinated it overnight. Delicious! Nice twist for the usual teriyaki flavored kabobs we usually do.

Delicious kabobs! Chicken remained very moist with lots of flavor. Didn't have to grill these long! I marinated the kabobs with the chicken chunks+ veggies all ready to go on the skewers overnight. 
Everyone loved these. I served it with wild rice.

I made this recipe with pork chops instead of chicken ( a suggestion from my brother) and did whole pork chops instead of kabobs. It was delicious. I think I will spice it up more next time though. It was good but I expected more flavor. Maybe marinate longer too. Anyway it is a delicous recipe for the grill!!

This was great! I didnt have any worcestershire (or soy sauce) so I use teriyaki sauce, which was very good, but will skip the salt next time.

Delicious! With rosemary picked fresh from the garden and the inescapable smoky flavor that only grilling can give a food, this recipe is truly one I would return to again and again. We served ours with lemon rosemary rice, though I think it would do beautifully on a salad as well.

This recipe is AMAZING!! I have made it 5 times so far and have used dried rosemary, a garlic/rosemary combo, and today I made it with fresh rosemary. All were incredible, but today's with the fresh was even better. Thank you so much for this delicious recipe! I have gotten so many compliments and requests for this recipe - I just forward them the link as it is perfect!

Great recipe!  I increased the lemon juice to 1/2 lemon and included the zest.  I decreased the olive oil to about 1/4 cup and used light ranch dressing.  I also put it on veggies to grill.  This is now one of my "make again" recipes.

This was okay, but the marinade was pretty bland. Not the flavor we prefer in a kabob. Also took 18 minutes to cook.

Our favorite Kabob recipe.  I wasn't sure how I how rosemary and ranch would taste together but we went ahead and tried it.  This was wonderful!  We grilled some veggie kabobs and dinner was served!

These went very fast at my daughter's birthday party.  We used our George Foreman to grill them and didn't bother skewering the meat.  Marinating overnight really allowed the flavor to permeate the meat.

We love these. Sometimes I use the marinade for whole chicken breasts or just tenders, and ditch the kabob idea altogether. Either way, delicious!

This recipe was FAAABULOUS!!!  Even my picky 4 year old ate it.  The chicken was so moist.  I was concerned because chicken breasts are usually very dry, but this was absolutely perfect....perfect moist-ness, perfect flavor, perfect everything.  I did cut back on the oil, only because I read other reviews.  I didn't have fresh rosemary on hand but I did use what I had in the small glass jar...but everything else I did was to the T....thanks for the keeper!!!  Great recipe and easy, easy, easy too!

I made these for our Memorial Day picnic!  They were a hit.  I took the suggestions of other reviewers and decreased the olive oil and omitted the salt.  I also baked them for a short time to decrease grilling time.  Thanks for sharing.

I have made this many times now, and it is always amazing! I've made it exactly as written, and have also modified it, and it turns out delicious. Try adding some Frank's Red Hot, or changing the fresh herbs you use (try fresh oregano, marjoram or thyme). I'm grilling this today for Memorial Day, along with marinated vegetable kabobs and fruit kabobs. Mmm!

Wonderful!  I made this for a last minute get together and after the first bite the praises just kept coming.  I left out the sugar, used white wine vinegar, and vegetable oil because that is what I had on hand. Still turned out great! the fresh rosemary from my herb garden made the dish.

Pretty good.  I had to use the oven since we ran out of propane--oops:) but they were still good.  I made my own ranch dressing with sour cream and powdered ranch and added a little extra ranch for oomph.  I used a very scant half cup of olive oil.  My husband requested that if I made the recipe again that I use dark meat so I will change that next time but this has a great flavor.

This recipe is definitely a keeper!  Like others, I didn't add any salt and only used two tablespoons of Worchestershire.  I used Ken's ranch dressing (full fat) and the flavors came together perfectly.  I'm glad I cut back on the Worchestershire though since it would have masked the ranch.  I marinated the cubed chicken in a ziplock for 10 hours before skewering and grilling.  They came out juicy and delicious.  Served with roasted asparagus and fingerling potatoes with rosermary from AR.  I'm looking forward to adding this to our summer grilling routine.

Not too many ingredients and yet very pleasing flavor from the marinade combination.  The chicken remains tender provided you don't over cook it.  I never seem to do much outside grilling so I frequently cook dishes like this on a long griddle on my stovetop, which works just fine this way.
Caution:  Due to the sugar in the marinade, be careful the chicken pieces do not burn.  Chicken pieces should have some caramelization or golden brown color, but not blackened!  Neither does a too-white color make the best presentation. Turn skewers frequently to avoid burning and get good coloring.  Take off grill or stove immediately to avoid toughening or burning once cooked.

WOW!  The first time I made this I could not believe how good it was. I used Hidden Valley as others have suggested.  I did not have any lemon juice, but it did not seem to matter.  I also just used dried Rosemary.  
On the skewers I mixed it up with bell peppers and onions.  While skewering I was getting marinade on the vegetables, but that just seemed to help.  
The first time I made this I knew it was, without a doubt the best thing I ever made.   Since then I have not been able to replicate the... experience, but am still trying.

I used boneless skinless breasts, marinated overnight, and baked them in the oven for 40 minutes.  The sauce was great (will use rice next time) and the fresh rosemary stood out.  We will try as kabobs as well.  Latest run: I substituted diluted A1 instead of worcestershire because my daughter is allergic to shellfish.  It was delicious!!!

This was very good and very easy.  I will make this again and will vary the spice, maybe swap the rosemay for other spices sometimes.  There were not any leftovers, but if there would have been the they would be great on a greek salad or tossed salad the next day.

Outstanding, this has got to be one of the greatest cases of the whole being more than the some of its parts, at least that I know about. The chicken is so tender and all you do is throw the ingredients in a bowl, mix, let the chicken sit in it and then cook it. I cut it into small pieces and broiled it and served it with rice and some greens, really good.

I was so surprised!!!  This recipe is incredible!  I'm a rosemary fan, so I added another teaspoon of fresh rosemary.  I baked it on 375 for 20 minutes, then turned it up to 400 for another 10 minutes (may just be that my oven is temperamental.).  My family LOVED this dish!!!  There are six of us, and there was more than enough.  Great!!

Love it. I make it just like this if i have everything. The ranch, olive oil and worchestsire are the most important. I have missed out on the others along the way and really didnt notice. I eat it most of the time as a chicken salad - the BOMB! Marinade your veggies in it to grill too.

These are definatley a keeper.  I made Kabobs cause they marinate better, which I did for couple of hours. Cut the oil in half, salt in half, was afraid to use 3 TBSP of worchestershire so I used 2.  Once again 4 out of 4 thumbs up in this house.

If there were 10 starts I would give them all. I've made these kabobs for countless BBQs after finding this recipe here. No tweaks, just doubling of recipe and meat content was needed! I had everyone at every function I made these beg for the name of the marinade I used. HA! It was allllllll me! Thank you for the recipe!!

Wonderful!  I made it a little differently though.  Instead of kabobs, I threw the chicken cubes - marinade and all - into a skillet to cook, and then served it over brown rice.  I hated to throw all that delicious marinade away, so I turned it into a sauce.  My husband and I both loved it, and I'll definitely be making it again!

After reading many, many glowing reviews I couldn't wait to try this recipe. When I finally did, I was disappointed. The meat was super tender, but that was about it. I thought it had very little (if any) distinct flavor and my family of 6 thought it was just "okay". Maybe with some tweaking it would be better.

Used 1/4 oil instead, and half the salt, with just a tiny bit of sugar.  Instead of diced chicken I used thinly sliced breasts, and these turned out great!  My kids loved them too.

It was awesome!!!! My husband loved it. I didn't have white vinegar on hand, so I used balsamic (cut in half) and it turned out just great. I put it over a fresh basil pesto pasta and got a lot of compliments.

This is AWSOME!!!!!!  I have made this several times exactly as the recipe states with the exception of the oil and sugar.  I cut the oil down to 1/4 cup and the sugar to about 2 teaspoons.  I found after making them several times that the kabobs are a lot of work so I have marinated whole chicken breasts and then grilled I have also slowly grilled frozen chicken breasts and used this as a basting sauce.  Anyway I have made this it turned out great.  I would give it 10 stars if I could.

Easy, quick and delicious! What more could you ask for? I interspersed zucchini rounds and onions on the skewers, and served them with couscous (cooked the marinade for a sauce - yum)!

I always seem to have a hard time getting chicken done as kabobs so I started cutting the boneless breasts up in 3 or 4 pieces and pounding with a mallet. Grills quickly and thoroughly that way.

I used the marinade on chicken breast halves that I pounded to about 1/2 in.  After marinating for about 2 hours, we grilled the chicken.  Delicious!

Very nice marinade. I only added 1/4 cup olive oil and used chicken tenders. Didn't skewer them - they turned out nice and juicy with a great flavor.

I made this for a bbq.  It was so good that by the time I got done grilling it...there was none left.  So...  I am just going by what everyone else told me :-)  I did let them marinate an extra long time (2+ days in the fridge).  Note: need to make more next time...and save some for myself!

Delish!  I didn't have any ranch dressing but I had Ceasar so I substituted.  I marinaded all day long and baked in the oven at 350 for 30 mins.  It was so good my 3 year old had seconds and my husband had thirds.

This is an incredble recipe.  I made it a few times and have settled on a variation:  I use a teaspoon of curry powder, instead of sugar I use honey (helps cling the marinade to the chicken) and I use white wine instead of vinegar. I use baby bella mushrooms,roma tomatos and pneapple to the skewer (that I soak in the pineapple juice).

Easy to make and very delicious...a crowd pleaser!  I've made it using fresh and dried rosemary.  Both taste good, but fresh is better.  I make this recipe often, and always with good results.

This was the best chicken I have had...perfectly juicy and flavorful.  I have a hard time eating chicken on the grill as the texture is usually a bit to chewy for my taste, and the flavor is never rich enough, but this one is great!!

I made this exactly as the recipe suggested, it was wonderful. We grilled it. I saved a little of the marinade (before it went on the chicken) boiled some red potatoes until done, drained, moved potatoes to a grill basket, poured saved marinade over them and placed on grill just until browned while the chicken finished cooking. Yummy!

Not as tasty as I expected it to be.  I like ALOT of flavor so I usually add more vinegar for the tang and a little parsley and marjoram.  I also use only half the oil.  But it is great over rice.

Subtle yet flavorful. It's not the best combo I've had but will do for an easy dinner. More seasoning on the chicken  and veggies between the chicken would present better. I will cook this again with changes.

Really good. I doubled because I used 6 chicken breasts (not halves). Based on other reviews I reduced salt by half and I also reduced oil by half for the calories. Used light ranch dressing. Grilled breasts instead of kabobs. Really good, and moist. Just a tad salty still for me, altho my husband didn't think and no one else complained. Maybe it was just me. Will definitely use recipe again, thank you very much!

I added Bacon to these (because ranch chicken and bacon just go together heavenly) and I marinated for about an hour to an hour and a half. They were juicy and so succulent. Thank you for this wonderful recipe.

We really liked this recipe.  I used thyme the first time I made it because I was out of rosemary.  We had it again the next week with rosemary. Either way, they were a hit!!  Thanks for sharing.

I followed the recipe to a T and was not disappointed. Next time I will add some minced garlic to the marinade. The chicken was done to perfection and the taste was very pleasing to the palate. OPTIMO!

my husband and i love this recipe, we have already made it a few times this summer! you only need one tsp of salt, and we always marinade peppers and onions in a different bowl to put on the skewers with the chicken. add some rice and you're all set!

These were delicious!  I used fat free ranch and dried rosemary, I actually said wow when I took my first bite.  My boyfriend and I polished off all the kabobs before we finished grilling.  Best believe I will be making these next week with fresh rosemary.  Thank you Theresa!

These were pretty good, but not as good as the recipe sounds.  I used full fat Ranch dressing since the low fat kind is not good at all.  The ranch taste just wasnt there though.  Maybe next time I will use the dry ranch dressing mix and sprinke on the chicken instead.

These were very good.  My whole family liked them.  I used Ranch Dressing II from this site for the ranch dressing called for in this recipe.

Simply delicious.  I also marinated green and red bell pepper chunks and vidalia onion chunks.  The chicken and veggies marinated for 2-3 hours.  I took the extra marinade from veggies and added over rice.  This recipe is being added to my favorites.

I would use a little less ranch dressing next time and let them marinate for an hour or a little longer. Over all, these were pretty good!

This really was fantastic. I have never taken the time to write a review for other recipes, but this one deserves the praise. I marinated the chicken for about 5 hours and reduced the oil and sugar slightly. My four year old daughter even loved it and after gobbling it all up, she actually thanked me for making dinner that night!

Very good.  Needs a little something more to make it pop though.  I think maybe more Worcestershire, or maybe some chille pepper, or something else.

Cooked these last night and loved them. The meat stayed very tender, I marinated them for a couple of hours. Served with some roasted veg and couscous. Will definitely cook them again.

Holy moly! Now this was amazing chicken. Even our picky "I don't like that" 13 year old loved it. No small feat!  I stuck to the original recipe this 1st time around and loved it. Juicy, flavorful, so yummy. It is definitely going into heavy rotation.

YUM!  Chicken is normally so boring, but the marinade made this great!  I marinated overnight plus I kept some marinade to the side to heat up and sprinkle over the chicken and rice. Really, really good.

Oh my gosh...fantastic!! A few minor changes but not many! I bought fresh chicken 'tenders' rather than regular breasts. I do not like to cut it all up & skewer it. The tenders are SO moist, & easy and they are already in fairly small pieces and cook up really quickly. Worked great!  I cut back on the salt and used maybe 1t or so. Added a quick dash of onion powder and garlic powder. I did not find it to be too sweet with the sugar in it. It was a BIG hit with guests tonight! You will love this...

I made this for a guest coming for Sunday dinner. I usually like to try out new recipes on family first, but for this one, I sent up a quick prayer that it would be ok! It was fantastic! I followed the recipe exactly, but I did not add the optional sugar. It cooks beautifully on the grill and does not stick.

This is something that the whole family loved. I had to make it and go to work in the evening. Of course I had to test it first and was very impressed with myself. When I called later, the first thing my wife said was "That chicken was awesome! The kids loved it!" You may notice she said "was". Good thing I got a taste before leaving it to them. It would have been perfect if I had soaked the skewers first to prevent burning. This recipe will impress.

This is so quick, easy, and OMG fabulous.  I put it on kabobs with green pepper, mushrooms, pineapple & I forgot the onion.  Can't wait to make it for guests and wow the socks of them.  I bought a rosemary plant specifically for this recipe.

My picky daughter (who doesn't even cook) asked for this recipe!  We all loved it.  Served it with veggies I had marinated separately and grilled with the chicken (zucchini, summer squash, fresh portabella mushrooms, onion, etc.) and jasmine rice with dill.  Awesome!

This was reallly good!  Chicken was moist and had a great flavor - I didn't use white pepper - otherwise followed exactly.

This is a fabulous chicken recipe!  I used boneless skinless chicken breasts and grilled them while basting a few times with the remaining marinade. DELISH!!!!

My husband was not initally up for chicken. However, after one bite he was ready to eat the entire dish. I can understand the salty concern but is not evident after grilling. I would agree to only using 1 tsp (or even half a tsp) verus 2 TBS.  We used on a Cuinsart grill/press.  It was perfect.

I'm not a fan of ranch dressing so I waited too long to make these. I wish I made some marinade on the side like other reviewers.

This chicken was very flavourful and moist... sometimes hard to get with white meat.  Even the leftovers two days later, when reheated in the microwave, were tender and moist.  Rather than making kabobs I pounded chicken breasts a little thinner and marinated them over night.  Delicious!

Outstanding.  We have made this so many times.  I usually just use on chicken breasts due to time.  And use only 1 tsp. salt.  Everytime I make this for company they won't leave until they hav ethe recipe.  YUMMMMY!

Family really loved this and requested I make it a regular meal. I made veggie kabobs to go along with the chicken - with a bit of olive oil, pinch of salt and dash of pepper - onions, button mushrooms, red bellpepper and cherry tomatoes.

Outstanding! I marinated 5 boneless chicken breasts, rather than kabobs, overnight and grilled them on a low setting on the gas grill for about 12-15 minutes on each side, checking the internal temp periodically until the thermometer registered 175 degrees.  I removed the breasts from the grill and allowed them to rest for about 6 minutes before serving. The result was a very moist, tender product.  The next day for lunch, I warmed up a leftover chicken breast, sliced it and added to an ice cold tossed salad.  Wonderful!

My guests totally loved this recipe--the marinade is excellent--I used lots of fresh rosemary and the flavor is unbeatable.   I like this because the chicken is easy to cook without being burned on the outside and raw on the inside.  Will definitely do this again and again.  Excellent!!!

Made these for a 4th of July cookout. Made different ones, chicken, veggy, shrimp and combinational Kabobs. Was a real hit, even got calls later that night on how good they tasted. I will put them on the stick first, kind of messy with marinade.

Didn't care much for this.  It was pouring rain so, based on a previous post, we BAKED two boneless, skinless chicken breasts instead of grilling them  (after marinating them for almost two hours).  Sorry, but there just wasn't much flavor (perhaps grilling would have helped).  I will say, however, that the chicken was VERY moist and VERY tender.  Just not much flavor.

The marinade for this dressing smelled and tasted so good, I was really looking forward to making this.  Unfortunately, it didn't turn out as great as I had hoped.  I marinated the meat over night and followed other people's suggestion of leaving out the salt....it needed it.  Will try again with 1 tsp of salt.

Was just okay for us.  Followed the recipe, and while moist, just did not have enough flavor.

We thought this was a fantastic change from the soy sauce based marinades I usually make. .  I cut the recipe in half and it was more than enough marinade for 3 chicken breasts.  I also reserved a few tablespoons of the marinade BEFORE adding the chicken.  I brushed it on the meat 1 minute before removing the meat from the grill.  It was excellent.

This receipe is delicious!  Made it for the first time last weekend and let it marinade for an hour.  Flavor is great if you like rosemary and it is very juicy.

This was a very good and easy recipe.  I used chicken breasts that were pre-seasoned (in the package) and added the marinade to the already seasoned chicken breasts.  Wonderful flavor, but would use boneless, skinless chicken thighs the next time, as the chicken breasts tend to dry out, even when not overcooked.  All in all, excellent recipe, will definately make again.

This was nothing special. The olive oil is unnecessary, and it was too salty. It just didn't give the kick of flavor that I was expecting.

My whole family loved the Kabobs!  I did not add the sugar and used sea salt but followed the rest of the recipe.  It was awesome!  I marinated the chicken for 45 minutes and grilled it at low temp.  We will be using this recipe again.

These were soooo good I'm makin' them again tonight (twice in two weeks)!!   Try them with allrecipes.com Greek Garlic Lemon Potatoes, Greek salad, and rice mixed with hummus for a to-die-for meal!  Note:  I marinated the chicken for 1.5 hours.

Yummy. Prepared as directed. Saved some of the marinade, and added more ranch dressing and worcestershire as a drizzling sauce. Served over rice, with Mom's Cucumber Salad from this site. A big hit at our house last night.

Very tasty!  Family and friends loved it.  I marinated for a couple of hours instead of thirty minutes, only had dried rosemary available and it tasted great.  Will do again.

I was getting SO sick of chicken on the grill, until we tried this. It's by far the best we've ever grilled. I crushed the rosemary OVER the chicken right before grilling. FANTASTIC.

I made this dish, but made some changes because we are on Weight Watchers. I completely left out the oil, sugar and prepared ranch dressing. Instead, I used a half cup of lowfat buttermilk, probably a half of a Ranch dressing MIX packet and then added the lemon, vinegar and fresh rosemary, pepper, less salt and less Worchestershire sauce and I also added one minced garlic clove.. I marinated it for probably three hours and then grilled on skewers with veggies. It was very tasty and everyone loved it!

I only marinated for 30-40 minutes but the kabobs suck it up so much, it tasted like it had been marinated for days! I will definitely use this again.

I didn't think I would like this but the flavor was wonderful with the ranch and the rosemary.  I used homemade ranch dip from this site with 1/3 sour cream, 1/3 mayo and 1/3 buttermilk with fresh chives and dill.  I would recommend this dish as kid friendly and great for summer cookouts.

With the first bite to 'test if it's done', the boyfriends eyes nearly popped out of his head.  It's that good.  I'm afraid of grilling chicken because it usually dries out, but this recipe promises moist chicken and it SERIOUSLY delivers! We didn't use the rosemary because we don't like it (nor did I feel like buying a huge pack for a tablespoon's worth - if you have a good friend that grows some, I recommend kissing butt for a sprig ;) ).  I threw in 2 pinches of thyme leaves as a replacement.  Made a little extra sauce and served over rice (cooked it a little bit since the chicken sat in it), and served it up with some grilled corn (butter, salt and pepper wrapped up in aluminum foil).  Fabulous.  The fiance said THIS HAS TO MAKE IT INTO OUR RECIPE BOX.  *Update* Skewered this with some onions then grilled and threw on top of a salad with Mama's Balsamic Vinagrette which paired p e r f e c t l y with it.  Awesome!

I'll add my voice to the chorus of those who thought this chicken was delicious.  Everyone agreed we should make it again.  I followed the recipe exactly except for cutting the salt to one teaspoon (based on earlier reviews), and marinating all day rather than just 30 minutes.  Next time, I'll try it with the full two teaspoons of salt just to see if that improves the already excellent flavor. Thanks to Theresa Spencer for this great recipe!

Oh my gosh- made these just as recipe says, and marinated all day in the fridge. They were SO SO GOOD!!!!! This will be a recipe I turn to often now when entertaining. Served with "picnic foods" on the side: macaroni salad, watermelon, marinated cucumbers, deviled eggs, and French bread. Everyone loved it- even the kids! Extremely tender and flavorful. Thanks!

I just got up from the most delicious, succulent, satisfying chicken I have EVER eaten.  My husband, who has been all over the world and eaten anything put in front of him, looked at me during supper and said, "This is as good a piece of chicken as I have ever tasted."  My mouth was too busy to answer, I just nodded in agreement.  THANK YOU for the best tasting chicken EVER!!! and I have to tell you, I eat chicken about 6 times a week.  I am in awe!

This has got to be the best chicken marinade ever, my hubby and I couldnt stop talking about how good it was!!!!   I used homemade ranch from a local store that I love (very garlicky and has green onions in it also)!!   I let the chicken set in the marinade for about and hour and then I also reserved some for basting while it was grilling!!   I cant wait to make it again!!!

The family liked this but it did not get rave reviews.  Saving some of the marinade for dipping is a must - otherwise I don't think the flavor would have been as distinctive (I marinated the chicken overnight).  I do think this recipe is a keeper though and next time I'll add some garlic and probably double the rosemary.  Also, I held back on the Worcestershire as others suggested but next time I think I'll try it with the full 3T.

Added 2 small zucchini and 2 small yellow squash, 1 green pepper and 8 oz of mushrooms, all cut in chucks. Put it all in a gal. ziploc bag and marinated in fridge all day, turning it over occasionally. I grilled in kabob baskets and served wtih Rice a Roni Rice Pilaf.  Fabulous!

This was super super yummy!  My husband really enjoyed these!  I thought it had way too much rosemary so I cut that way back.  I know it's rosemary chicken, I guess I just don't care for the taste of rosemary.  But I will definitely continue to make these!

My husband and I both enjoyed this recipe. The only thing I did differently was marinate the whole boneless skinless chicken breast instead of making kabobs.

It's a keeper. I didn't string them on the stick. I grilled sliced and served on top of salad. Yummy! Even the fussy eaters liked it.

Very easy and good. Scaled the recipe for 2, but I would add more roesmary than the 1 tsp the scaled recipe called for.  Seemed to make the chicken a bit mushy, but I did marinate it for longer than recommended (it was too nice an evening on the deck to leave it to cook!) Will make again, adding a bit more rosemary and maybe some garlic.
8/7/10 update Made this again and added garlic and more rosemary. Really tasty; 4 1/2 stars.  One other reviewer mentioned it lacked punch; maybe a dash of Tabasco next time. Still, a keeper and will definitely be a go-to recipe. Also made a batch of marinade just for the vegs - onion, red pepper, yellow and green zucchini and mushrooms.

Love it. I had run out of ranch dressing and used 1/4 cup Hellman's mayo and 1/4 cup goddess dressing as a substitute. It was sooo good. Since then, I've made it at least four times, still using my mayo/dressing instead of ranch. The chicken is so tender and juicy.

This was extremely Good. I cut back on the Olive Oil amount(1/2) and added Veggies to the Kabobs. I Let the Chicken Marinate for about 3 hours. Cooked 25 minutes on Medium-low heat to let the veggies get tender. Was very Flavorful and my kids really enjoyed the Kabobs. I had to used Dry Rosemary, but will try with Fresh. Thankyou for posting will be a regular in my household.

Yummy!  We ate these up, although next time I'll use half the amount of salt.  I took the advice of some others, and reserved some unused marinade as a dipping sauce (adding some more ranch to it).  We even used it with a few shrimp.  Will definitely make this one again!

These were AWESOME! I didn't want to bother with doing kabobs, so I just cut the chicken into strips & grilled them. There were outstanding... very moist, juicy & everyone raved about them. Will most definitely repeat!!! Only change I made was leaving out the salt, but otherwise I followed the recipe!

Update: We have made this chicken so many times now! Last night we sprinkled tons of grated parmesan cheese over the chicken before grilling and it was even better. I love this marinade. Thanks so much!! This marinade is a keeper. The flavors were nice, and the chicken stayed very moist. We will be making this over and over again for sure.

This was good... I just used chicken breasts instead of making kabobs and they were good. I would probably marinage them longer next time though.

This is so delicious I don't even know what to say!  I did whole chicken breasts, which I marinaded as directed, then I put them in a dish and poured the marinade over the top.  Baked them for 20 minutes at 450 and they were perfect.  I made them for the "Pig Burger" recipe from this site, but I'm sitting here eating it before I even have the burgers made!  I have never been good at cooking meat, so I know my husband is going to be thrilled with this recipe! :) Thanks!

Delish! We omitted the sugar but otherwise kept to the original recipe. I also added bell pepper to the kabobs and served over rice. Mmmm

Wow!  Just like all the other reviewers, I admit this was really good!  It had the perfect amount of flavor, and the rosemary really stood out.  My 2 year old ate more tonight than I have ever seen him eat!

I felt the need to update this to say that we have had it many times this summer and each and every time it is a huge success!  Original Review:  This is at least 5 stars!  So delicious.  I can't wait to make it again.

I did mine in the oven - 350 for 25 mins. I marinated the chicken six or so hours---man --- talk about flavor.  I cut back on the amounts because I only had two chicken breasts--wish I had more for leftovers!! I served it with some asparagus and of course poured a bit of the sauce on top of both. Thanks Theresa!! This will be a great - someones coming for dinner meal - they'll think I worked all day!!

I would give this more than 5 stars if possible.  I followed the recipe except omited the salt and used a little less oil and sugar.  The flavor was delicious and the chicken was tender and moist.  Mincing the fresh rosemary took a while so next time I will try dried to see if there is a difference.  Can't wait to use this recipe again!

This marinade is great! Be sure to use fresh rosemary (I made it with dried and fresh and the fresh is definately better!) I also tried it with the buttermilk ranch and the regular ranch and I prefer the regular ranch.  I also added 3 cloves of garlic and marinated it overnight I cut the worchestershire sauce in half the second time I made it I felt the salt dried it out when marinated overnight I also did not add the sugar the second time it caramalized too much on the grill Everyone gobbled these up on mother's day and everyone asked for the recipe

This was so delicious! I broiled the chicken instead of grilling and the flavor was still awesome! I am sure that these will taste even better if they're grilled. I will definitely make this again!

I used a packet of ranch dressing mix instead of ranch dressing and splenda instead of sugar. I liked the splenda but the ranch was to much. Next time I will use half the packet of ranch dressing mix and will try marinating for 1/2 an hour. It was really delicious though and a favorite of my soon to be husbands. We ate it with steamed broccoli mixed with roasted red peppers.

Great taste!  Halved the salt as suggested and skipped the rosemary just because we don't like it.  Next time I will make an extra cup of the marinade for a dipping sauce, it is so tasty!

Used this on whole chicken breasts, and marinated over night. Didn't have as much flavor as I was hoping for! Will try again though.

Fantasitc! Another recipe I repeat often. I do leave out the sugar and use dried rosemary instead of fresh-  I would like to try the fresh sometime. I tend to marinate mine a long time and also froze chicken with the marinade and that cameout great as well. Perfect on the BBQ but also did in the winter on the indoor grill.

Made this ALMOST exactly to the recipe. I used Dale's Steak Seasoning since I didn't have Worcestershire sauce. I also used White Balsamic Vinegar since I didn't have regular white vinegar. Turned out so delicious! Like from a 5 STAR Chef! My husband doesn't even like white meat (because of how it's usually dry), but he loved this chicken! Will definitely be a meal I cook again!

This is the first chicken kabob recipe I've ever tried and it was absolutely a amazing. I was hesitant that they would taste too much like ranch dressing, but it didn't at all. Instead, it had a moist and complex flavor for such a simple marinade (I had all the ingredients on hand which, for a novice like me, doesn't happen too often!). Also, I liked that it only took thirty minutes to marinate rather than overnight was useful for me who often doesn't know what I'm going to make until I make it.  I'll definitely make this again!

EXCELLENT.  I skewered these with baby bella's, green pepper and onion.  My husband says this is definitely a keeper.  Next time I will marinate veggies with the chicken too.

Being probably the pickiest eater in the world these were simply heavenly. My husband loved it as well as my 9 year old. Served it with grilled bell peppers and grilled asparagus and put it over rice. Definitely will make it time and again!

It was winter when I cooked, so we used the broiler instead. Everyone that I cooked for really loved the sauce and gave me compliments.  I'll be keeping this recipe around.  Thanks!

I haven't made this recipe since the summer, and I have to say I can't believe I forgot how wonderful it is! I knew I had liked it, but trying again made me jump on here to review. Made it as per the recipe using light ranch dressing. The chicken is so tender and flavorful, and the low marinading time is great. Would say this is one of the best chicken recipes out of even restaurants I have been to. Thank you for sharing!

These are so delicious!  Instead of chicken I use Quorn tenders and it's turned out perfect every time.  I use half the sugar, no salt, and low fat dressing.  And to save time I just make a basket out of tin foil, pour in the tenders and marinade, fold the pouch closed and put on the grill for about 20 minutes, stirring once.

I made up this marinade as directed (except for a teaspoon of dried rosemary instead of fresh) and poured it over whole chicken breasts in a pyrex baking dish.  After refrigerating for 30 minutes, I popped the whole thing in a 370 degree oven for 35 minutes.  The chicken came out very moist and flavorful, and my boyfriend and I definitely enjoyed our dinner.  I do, however, think that grilling the chicken would make it even better.

This is really good and easy.  Our grill was out of commission, so I marinated whole chicken breasts and baked them for 20 minutes at 350.  It was really good-my husband loved it as well.  I followed the recipe to a T, except I used soy sauce instead of Worcestershire because that's what I had on hand.  I also halfed the recipe, because I was making it for 2 people.  I will definitely make this again--I can't wait to try it on the grill!  EDIT: I finally made this as kabobs on the grill--amazing!  I love it before, but its even better now.  I followed the recipe exactly, except I marinaded the chicken for 6 hours.  On the skewers I put red pepper, onion and potatoes (unmarinaded, but I seasoned the potatoes).  This is an amazing dish that I will make again and again.

This has got to be the best chicken kabob recipe  I have ever had! my family loved it.   Next I have to try it with the rosemary (didn't have on hand).  I can't wait until the weather gets nice because these are going to be even better on the outdoor grill!

I gave this a four because my boyfriend (who loves everything) loved this recipe, but for me (being a picky eater) thought it was okay.  The chicken was definitely really moist and overall had good flavor - perhaps I'm just not big on rosemary.  I will definitely try this again though.  I did make a few changes.  Because there were only two of us I used two chicken breast halves (made about 6 kabobs-plenty).  I used canola oil (all I had), about 3/4 cup of ranch, 2 tsp lemon juice, 2 tsp vinegar, 2 tsp garlic powder.  The rest of the ingredients I kept the same as the original 6 serving recipe.  I marinated the chicken for about 2 hours then alternated chicken pieces and pieces of green pepper on the skewers.  Overall pretty good recipe and very easy (which is always good in my book).

YUM! I was a little nervous about some of the ingredients listed but trusted the recipe and I am so glad i did! TASTY TASTY! I am only giving 4 stars because garlic should have been included. i cooked my chicken indoors on a grill pan without skewers, served with pita bread and wild rice. certainly a keeper!

This dish is excellent!  The chicken turned out very juicy and flavorful (even the reheated leftovers were tender and moist).  I can see my husband and I keep making this dish over and over.  I highly recommend it!

This is delicious! My whole family (My husband, 4 kids, and me) loved this chicken! I made it exactly as written, but left it in the fridge to marinate for about 4 hours until dinner. I read a lot of reviews before cooking it, and tripled the sauce recipe, but that wasn't needed. I think double would have been perfect. Thw reviewers that comment on not liking rosemary or it was ovewhelming...make sure you use FRESH rosemary as the recipe calls for. The dry bottled stuff always tastes awful and most people use way too much. If you can't use fresh, then all you would need is a pinch of the dry stuff. Anyway...everyone loved this in my house...and it was even better the next day:) Thanks for a great recipe! We will definitely have it again!

I thought this was just OK.  But then again, I think Ranch Dressing is just OK. I marinated the chicken for 2 hours.  I didn't feel that the Worcestershire, lemon and vinegar was all that noticeable.  If I make this again I will increase the amount of those ingredients and add garlic. I also baked mine in the oven with good results, the chicken was very moist.  I will probably try this again for a BBq in the summer as I do have friends who are Ranch Dressing fiends.

This was soooo good!  The chicken was very flavorful and juicy.  January isn't exactly grilling weather where I live, so I cooked them on my Foreman grill.  The only change I made was to cut the salt in half because I knew my ranch dressing was already fairly salty.  Thanks for sharing!

Skewered the chicken in strips over a pyrex dish and cooked it in the oven at 400 degrees for twenty five minutes.  Chicken came out tender and dripping with flavor, absolutely amazing for leftovers on salad! Make extra!

OMG, this is a fantastic recipe.  I have used this recipe for large parties and have gotten rave reviews every time I serve it.  On a busy weeknight, I just marinate chicken tenderloins and grill them whole.  The flavor is just as good as if I cut the chicken up before marinating.

These were oddly on the oily side, but other than that they tasted awesome. We had a few feet of snow, so I oven baked rather than grilled for 20 mins in a 375 degree oven. I placed them in a shallow pan and poured all of the excess marinade into the bottom. Very moist and flavorful, just a bit oily. Plenty of flavors, so go ahead and omit ALL that extra salt! You won't miss it. I will reduce the oil next time and I can't wait until I can try them off of the grill! The leftovers never even hit the microwave the next day because they tasted so good cold!

This is so delicious only to marinate for 30 minutes.  Better over night.  Even better... tripple the recipes - eat one batch now, and freeze the other two batches of raw chicken cubes in the marinade for a later time.

Delicious! I didn't have lemon juice so I left it out and I don't think the recipe suffered for lack of it. Paired this with some couscous and green beans and it was hit! Definitely a keep for me!

The chicken was very tender, and didn't dry out.  Even my husband, who hates the mere mention of rosemary, liked this recipe.  I'll make this again.  I'll probably try to marinate chicken breasts next time.

Fabulous. Made it just like the recipe says and it was delicious. Wish I'd made more. Since it was cold and rainy, I broiled the skewers. Will definitely make many more times.

Awesome.  I have made these a few times with everyone liking them.  I let them marinade in a ziplock for at least 12 hours, sometimes up to 24 hours.  The longer the better.

Made these for my 23rd birthday party and they went over really well. I gave some to my bro because, as a broke college student with a half kitchen, he never eats any real food. I used 3 tbl Margarita mix instead of lemon juice and sugar (x2 because I doubled the recipie). People liked the lime-y taste. Joe helped and cut the chicken up while I mixed the marinade. I cut the skewers in half and baked the chicken in the oven in a casserole dish. I used tinfoil to protect the dish but I didn't do a very good job so it didn't work. For the first half hour I cooked the dish at 400 degrees with tinfoil on top but it was still pretty juicy so I cooked it another 15 min on 550 and the top layer browned a little. I took off the top layer served it, drained the juice out and cooked the bottom layer for another 10 minutes at 550. They browned pretty well after that but the dish was a bitch to clean in the end.

Very good, but I think next time I will use ranch seasoning rather than ranch dressing for more flavor.

Awesome! everyone gobbled them up. I omitted the sugar and salt, used light Ranch dressing and halved the oil. Marinated 8 bl/sl chicken thighs for 36 hours.
I have now made this numerous times and always omit the oil, sugar and salt. I also now add a tbsp of SD's Dry Buttermilk Ranch mix which just kicks it up a notch!

I have rosemary growing in my garden - I made the marinade without minced, fresh rosemary, but skewered the chicken onto fresh, woody rosemary branches. Incredible! Tender, juicy, & delicious!

Used light Kraft ranch and dried rosemary.  Enough to marinade 1.75 pounds of chicken. Good and moist!  Delicious on salad the next day for lunch.

I followed the directions except I used 5 chicken breasts, added garlic because we love it and onions and cooked it in the slow cooker for 6-8 hours on low because I didn't have time to grill, it was awesome!!!!!  Husband is a huge fan of grilling so this weekend we will try it grilled.  Awesome recipe, Thanks!!!!!!!

I have made these so many times over this summer,  I thought it was time to review them.  This chicken is the BEST.  I have done it both ways, cut into pieces or as the whole breast.  Both are excellent.  Making it again tonight and going to try another reviewers tip of using the marinade over rice.  I also have left the salt out...it doesn't need it when you use hidden valley ranch dressing.  Thank-you for a great recipe!

Awesome! In a college apartment so I didn't have a grill but the broiler worked perfectly! I did go the traditional approach and added red and green peppers on the skewers. This was an amazing dish and every one wants to come over next time I make it. Instant hit!

Wonderful, so tasty! I didn't have any fresh rosemary so I crushed some of the dried stuff that I had, I believe it was about 1-2 tsp and it turned out so good. I have made this twice now and love it, the chicken seems to melt in my mouth and is so flavorful! Thanks!

I guess I was expecting a much better taste. To me it was a little bland. I salted after cooking to make it taste better. It did, but I'm not quite sure what this needs; more spices I guess. I saw that others liked this so much that I just had to try it. Glad others liked it though! Will tweak it a bit and maybe repost my thoughts. One thing I gotta say is that I like the idea of doing kabobs... I've not done them in a very long time!

This is an excellent recipe, enhanced by the fact that it is easy. My husband liked and and he doesn't really like anything 'fussy.' I think it has replaced the marinade I've used for the last 20 years! Upon the advice of a friend, I used low fat Ranch dressing. What could be better!

Great marinade for Kabobs! - i added peppers (bell, jalepeno, yellow wax), tomato, and onion to the skewers, and doused everything in the extra sauce before grilling & made flatbread wraps with taziki, cilantro, and green onion. Thanks, will definitely make again!

I made this for my sons birthday party using chicken breasts and everyone raved how delicious it was!!! Definately a keeper!!!!   I had to double the recipe for the 12 chicken breasts.  I pounded the chicken breasts slightly and added 2 cloves of garlic and about a tablespoon of honey, marinated it for 24 hours!! YUMMY!!!!

My whole family enjoys these. Sometimes I'll grill whole breasts with this marinade and eat in a salad, and other times we do the kabobs with veggies. Awesome recipe, thanks!

This is a really great recipe! I used ChicagoRN2's advice to cook it in the oven. It was some of the most moist and tender chicken I have ever had. I will definitely make this often!

WOW! Amazing recipe - Made this for a bbq - got rave reviews! Made kabobs with the standard kabob veggies. Had some leftover chicken and cooked it on the stove in a grill pan and some leftover onion and bell peppers - outstanding!  This one is a keeper!  Used dried rosemary (didn't have fresh on hand) and marinated for about 30-40 minutes (the stovetop ones were marinated for about 3 hours)

Delicious & very easy! The chicken was so moist & juicy, it was amazing. I made a few changes, dried rosemary instead of fresh, and I used chicken tenders.  Marinated tenders for approximately 30-45min. and put on the grill, I did not want to fuss with kabobs. Everyone gobbled them up, no leftovers.  I will definitely make again. Thanks

I did not care for this recipe that much. I don't know if maybe I did it wrong, but I had all the ingredients. I used drum sticks for this recipe and BBQ them but for some reason, I didn't feel like it had enough flavor. It was very moist and my roommate and my husband loved it, but it wasn't one of my favorites.

Just made this for husband and 3 boys!  Whenever I make chicken I get the "ughhhh chicken again", but this was excellent.  Everyone, including my picky 7 year old loved it.  Husband even said it was some of the best grilled chicken he has ever had!  Made it exactly like recipe except, pounded chicken breast out and grilled them whole.  Cut them up into chunks afterwards and served with rice pilaf.  Will DEFINATELY make this again!

Turned out tender and delicious! I sliced the chicken into strips and marinated for 1/2 hour and then scooped them out of the marinade and placed them into tinfoil and put it on the bbq for about 45 minutes. I didn't have ranch so I used Big Bob's blue cheese and it was great. I left out the salt and only had cider vinegar, no lemon so I used lemon flavored oil instead of olive oil.

Totally easy weeknight dinner. Would go well with lots of sides, and the ranch marinade really seems to tenderize the chicken and keep it moist.  Hard not to like this one.

This was the BEST grilled chicken we have ever made.  We grill chicken all the time and we couldn't get enough of this chicken.  The rosemary and ranch went together so well.  We loved this chicken and we are making this again later this week.  I can't believe I waited this long to make this chicken!  I pounded my chicken breast thin and grilled them whole - no skewers.  You must make this dish ASAP!

Didn't have lemon juice and had to use dried rosemary (cut in half) but it turned out absolutely delicious.  Husband used cold for sandwiches which were the best I've ever had.  Definately a keeper - the flavor was perfect.  Thanks Theresa!

These kabobs are our new favorite!  We will keep making these even when it is too cold to grill.  Recipe was perfect as is, just cut back a bit on the salt due to personal preference.

This was just OK.  There seemed to be something missing.  We were hoping for MORE flavor.  I followed the recipe exactly, the only change was marinating the chicken for 4 hours.  I'll have to read some of the posts for additional hints.

The hubby, the one yr old and the 3 yr old devoured it. I baked it at 350 degrees for about 30 min, served it with rice and veggies. Will probably use less oil (by half) next time  but it was AMAZINGLY tender and yummy.

These were outstanding.  I, like another reviewer, also marinated mushrooms and vidalia onions (in a separate ziploc bag) and added them to the skewers.  Really tasty and the chicken was so moist.  Will definitely make these again (I see some are discussing the merits of the different ranch dressings, so, for the record, I used Marie's :-) )

My family described this as having a "burst of flavor in your mouth".  Even the kids liked it.

These are sooo good... I followed the recipe exactly except I marinated them over night and while I was at work. When I got home I skewered them on wooden skewers and grilled them on the george foreman grill. They turned out really good. I only put five chicken chunks on each skewer and could only grill three at a time but they didn't take long to cook. I did have to move the chiken around and turn it so they wouldn't burn, they got very crispy in some parts... So good will make again and again Loved these!!

My family and I loved this dish.  It was excellent.  Only two substitutions...used fat-free ranch and was still great and half the amount of oil.

This was fabulous. My husband and my guests loved it. Others said how good the marinade was as a gravy on rice. It tasted delicious but when I heated it up in the microwave, it separated and looked very oily.

Very good flavor from the marinade. I marinated the chicken for about 4 hours. The only thing I would do different next time is use boneless skinless chicken thighs instead of chicken breasts.

I love this marinade - it was awesome.  The chicken was so tender.  I'm so glad I made and grilled some extra chicken breasts - leftovers for a chicken salad!  Thanks for the recipe.

Great, The flavors blended very well and the chicken was not dried out. Because of the chicken cubes, cooking time was much less than whole breasts. I marinated longer and I believe that made the chicken even more tender.

My son loved this dish.  It would be good as just a chicken breast.  Reserve some sauce for the next time you cook it or for the table.

I discovered this recipe about 2 years ago.  It quickly became a family favorite and requested by friends!  It is great!  The combination of flavors is really tasty!  I sometimes omit the rosemary, because hubby isn't a huge fan of the "sticks".  Even doing that there is still great flavor with the other ingredients.  I may try ground rosemary next time to stay more true to the recipe.  This recipe has become a staple in my recipe collection!  Thank you for sharing it with the world!!!

This is a very easy recipe that produces wonderfully tender chicken.  I used 1 tsp of salt in the marinade and sprinkled seasoned salt on the chicken itself before adding the marinate.  Perfect, and left-overs are still tender.

Holy Moly!  I (and my whole family) would give this recipe 10 stars if possible.  I followed the recipe as stated but I did let the chicken marinate about 8 hours.  The meat was super tender and juicy and the flavor was incredible.  Next time, I will cut the salt and double the rosemary.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

This is a very good recipe; the chicken was moist and tender.  It would work well for a grilled chicken sandwich.  I omitted the sugar during my preparations.  I will definitely make this again sometime.  The only thing that I need to consider is whether or not the recipe produces good leftovers.  This characteristic has always been quite important in determining if it can survive the test of time in my kitchen.

This was fabulous! I used dried rosemary b/c that's what I had. I was running short on time so I didn't do the kabob thing, altho I will do that the next time I make this. Anyway, I layed the chicken kabob pieces in a baking dish and poured the marinade over then baked at 350 for 30 minutes and served over brown rice. This recipe is absolutely packed with great flavor. Thanks for a great recipe!

I marinated this over nite. The chicken was very tender and juicy but I didn't find it had enough flavor. I'll make up some of the marinade and use as a dipping sauce for the leftover and see how that goes. I dusted this with bacon salt and that did improve it for me

I have made this on numerous occassions to discover simpliest is best:  ranch, pepper, rosemary, garlic powder and a little oil.  That's it! Worcestershire is a nice touch, but still fab without. Always a hit at get togethers and fabulous on salad the next day! I'd give it 5 stars if kept more simple...sugar, lemon and vinegar are just not needed and forget adding more salt as Ranch has enough:-)

This was a great recipe and I will definitely be making it again.  I did find that the lemon juice was a bit strong so next time I'll add a bit less.  I also added half the sugar.  Instead of doing kabobs, I marinated chicken breasts and then bbq'd them on a cedar plank.  Fabulous!

This was so tasty! I served it with broccoli and cheese couscous and a tomatoe-basil salad. We had left-overs so I put the left-over chicken in a salad for lunch! This is definitly a keeper! Thanks for the recipe!

I first tried this recipe in 2007 for a church function and it was a HUGE success. People came back for more. I have made it again and again and it is still a huge success. The rosemary and ranch flavor the chicken so nicely.  Really worth the effort. I find if the chicken is frozen when I cut it, I get more uniform pieces.

My husband said this is one of the best things he has ever had. We all loved it, even the five year old. I served it over long grain rice,and corn bread... grilled with red onion and peppers but it didnt need it. HIGHLY reccommended will be making many more times.

An interesting marinade with the ranch dressing, I added extra lemon to mine. I made extra so I could marinade fresh vegetables. I mixed the chicken and the veggies on the skewers and they came out great.

Very good!  Used dried rosemary instead of fresh, so halved amount and also did boneless breasts instead of kabobs.  Husband loved it, small children liked it.  Will make it again.

Fabulous!  I was going to grill some vegies on the side in the leftover marinade, instead I just skewered them along with the chicken.  They were delicious.  Next time, though, I am going to save some of the marinade to soak the vegies in.  It was so yummy.  I also used the juice of a whole lemon because I like lemon.

Very good.  These make for a nice change. I just made them as chicken breasts rather than kebabs.

The marinade for these kabobs was really simple, things that I had in my fridge were right there. The chicken came out tender and moist.  I noticed that there was too much marinade though, so i'd cut the whole thing down by half, or use double the chicken.  Good idea to use the vegies in the marinade too!

These are excellent!  Restaurant quality recipe.  (I eve subbed dried for fresh rosemary.)  I have made them twice in less than a week on my boyfriend's request.  I marinated veggies (red potatoes, red onion, and green pepper) to go with them.  We cooked them once on the grill and once under the broiler.  I will make these again and again!!!

Omigosh these were very delicious! The second I saw the recipe and the great feedback I knew they'd be a hit, and of course they were.  I followed the directions pretty much exactly, and they turned out moist, tender, and flavorful.  There seemed to be quite a bit of excess marinade, which was pretty much all thrown out (and I'm not too fond of wasting anything!) so next time I might cut the marinade in half with the same amount of chicken.  Needless to say, I will definitely be making these again!!

I thought I had a favorite recipe for chicken kabobs until I made this one!  This is right up there for me, really tender and delicious chicken!  My family and company enjoyed it, both kids gobbled it right up.  I didn't use the sugar or salt, otherwise I followed the recipe exactly.  I did use light ranch dressing and didn't feel that it lacked anything.  Next time I will try fat free ranch and I may reduce the olive oil a bit as well.  I think the fresh rosemary really makes this recipe.  Thanks for a great one!

The only negative we had, and something that we had entire control of, is that the amount of rosemary and the resulting texture with the meat is a bit too "organic" for us.  We did use dried rosemary so fresh would have a softer texture and would probably become softer under the grill heat.  We also cut out the salt and used HVLight Ranch.  Tenderloins and boneless thighs with red and green peppers, onions and squash. Delicious even with the rosemary being a bit rough.

Wonderful.  I cut the recipe in half and was still too much marinade so I added a bunch of veggies to it (eggplant, onion, and green peppers).  The flavor was wonderful and the little kids tried it too.  Will make again.

This was pretty good, but I was not blown away.  Followed recipe as directed but reduced salt, and marinated three chicken breasts instead of kababs for about 2 hours.  Poured everything into a baking dish and then baked at 425 for about 20 minutes.  The chicken was tasty, and we scooped up the extra sauce in the dish to put over rice, which was really good.  Easy quick weeknight meal.

These are really good and very moist.  I only used half the amount of oil and it was plenty.  I used dried rosemary and I think that using fresh probably puts this recipe in the 5 star category.  Thanks!

These were a huge hit at our cookout!  The only change I made was using red wine vinegar, because that's all I had on hand.  I marinated the chicken over night and then skewed and grilled these on a charcoal grill.  Everyone loved them and asked for the recipe.  The chicken was so moist, tender, and flavorful.  My only "complaint" was that I thought it was a little salty, but no one else did, however I think next time I will just not use the extra salt ... there's enough salt in the dressing, etc.  All-in-all this was a winner and I will definitely be making this again!

Chicken was very moist.  Marinated for about 4 hours. I used dried rosemary in place of the fresh to save money.  Made Kabobs with zucchini, peppers, and onions.  Still moist the second day when I was eating it cold out of fridge.  KEEPER!!

This is a staple in my kitchen! Sometimes I use the rosemary, sometimes I don't. I like to change it up a bit too - I use whole breasts and throw them in the oven for 30 min or on the Forman grill for 10 (i know, i am probably the only person who still uses one, but they are handy!) great recipe, thanks!

I liked this chicken dish, but I was hoping that it would have a VERY flavorful taste to it. It was tasty, but not what I expected. The only thing that I did different was use whole, skinless and boneless chicken breasts and let them marinade for about 5 hours. I also made fresh ranch from one of those Hidden Valley packets; maybe the recipe would taste better if I had used bottled ranch? I loved the rosemary flavor and actually would put more in next time! All in all, it was a good recipe and I will come back to it and give it another shot.

This was wonderful. I am a huge rosemary fan and I thought this chicken gave out the perfect amount of that woodsy flavor without overpowering the chicken. Thank you Theresa for this recipe that I will use many times.

I don't know if I did something wrong, but there wasn't much flavor.  The chicken was extremely tender and moist, but I could not taste any of the ingredients.  I used ranch dressing from a local restaurant because I do not like store bought dressing.... I'm wondering if the tangy-ness of Hidden Valley is what makes this recipe.  I will try again with something bought from the store.  I will double up on the rosemary because I didn't taste it.  I marinaded the chicken overnight and still no flavor.  But due to the great reviews, I feel I did something wrong.  Will try again and update.

I have a love/hate relationship with rosemary so I was ready for a "meh" reaction, but this was really tasty.  That might have something to do with the fact that I used dried rosemary in place of fresh, but I really enjoyed them and my fiance said it was a keeper.  Thanks.

EXCELLENT!  SO GOOD on the grill!  I omitted the sugar and salt as there is plenty of sodium and sugar in the remaining ingredients.  The recipe also makes a LOT of marinade.  You could easily halve it and still have plenty to marinade four chicken breasts, eliminating some waste in the process.

Tried these out for the Forth of July and they turned out great.  I threw some veggies on the skewers just to give them a little something extra.  Good recipe.

Hello, this is the avon lady's daughter, Christina (:  This chicken is superrr tender and delicious. I love how I can taste every ingredient that's in it. Although we didn't make it into a kabob, we did however use chicken thighs and it worked fine. They're so easy to make and grill, this is a meal I wouldn't mind having again. (:  -Thank you for a wonderful recipe Theresa Spencer! ♥

Loved it, and my very picky son loved it! Next time I'll try it as just the breast rather than bother with the kabobs, though.

Loved this! I made it with chicken that had been frozen and you couldn't tell. It was so good, I made it in the morning and let it marinade all day, then I threw it on the grill and had dinner in less then 15 min.

OMG!! I hate ranch, I may the only one in the US that does, but my family loves it so I decided to make this recipie, today.  This chicken is so good it's not even funny.  I had everything on hand so I threw it together and put it on the grill, I did add peppers and red onions but the recipie was the same, it's fantastic I wish I had made more it's all gone and I just took it off the grill 10 min ago.  I will make this again, maybe tommorrow!!

I am always looking for something different for dinner.  I found this recipe and thought I would give it a try.  I am glad I did.  It was so good.  The kids loved the skewers.  I used light ranch dressing and marinated it for a couple hours.  I do think if you use light or fat free dressing the amount of vinegar and lemon juice needs to be decreased.

I can't tell you how good these were!  My husband and 11 year old really liked them as well.  I'm not a huge eater of meat, but I went back for seconds, than thirds which is unheard of.  I than snacked on them for the rest of the night.  I did as another reviewer suggested and reserved about 1/2 cup of the marinade, added ranch dressing and used it as a dip.  I'm going to make them on the 4th for an appetizer.

These kabobs were awesome!  My boyfriend and I ate the whole recipe.  Next time, I will set some of the marinade aside for dipping, because it was SOOOOO delicious! The only flaw - these were quite messy on the grill.

Yum!!!  Didn't do the kabobs, just marinated chicken breasts for about an hour. I did use light ranch, and don't think regular ranch would be any better.  I cut the salt in half based on other recommendations.  Thanks for sharing this one!

Followed the recipe and loved it.  The chicken was tender and the flavor was great.  I marinated it a little longer then 30 min. only because I got busy and forgot the time.  Will prepare again.  Easy!  Thank You for the recipe.

YES - the rosemary would have helped!  This is the best recipe ever: great flavor, very moist and easy to prepare.  This is to chicken what béarnaise is to steak.  Everyone loved it to the point of licking the marinade bowl - seriously!  I left out the sugar but please don't leave out the most important ingredient and then give it a low rating!  A lot of people may miss out on a great recipe because of that.

Had my in-laws over for supper, and I did a few different chicken marinades.  The only change I made with this one was that I didn't add rosemary (didn't have it and forgot to get it at the store), but I didn't think this was great at all.  I marinated for 7 hrs., and everybody who tried it agreed there wasn't much flavor.  Not sure if the rosemary would have helped?????

Delish!  We didn't make the kabobs, just used whole chicken breasts.  Very moist with a little tang.  Husband loved them and I can't wait to eat the leftovers.  Thanks for the great recipe!

This was a big hit at a recent picnic lunch.  I cooked the chicken on an in-door grill the night before, and served the kabobs cold along side a pasta salad.  I doubled the recipe and there was none left!

This was absolutely fabulous.  I usually follow recipes to a T the first time I make them, but I was short on Worcestershire sauce, so I substituted steak seasoning in its place.  Also, I didn't have 30 minutes to let the chicken sit in the marinade, so I sealed it all up in a FoodSaver bag for 15 minutes instead.  It was VERY GOOD!

My husband and I really enjoyed this. This only change I made was using dried rosemary as that was all I had. Oh and I probably didn't marinate them for the entire half hour as we were rushed, but they still tasted great. We liked to dip them in a little ranch to bring out the ranch flavor more. We'll definately be eating these again - tasty and easy, my kind of meal!

Very tasty and easy to make. This was the first time I tried making kabobs and they turned out great. I ended up using breast tenders since that's what I had in the fridge and the timing was perfect (about 10 mins on the grill).

Delicious! Got the whole family cooking, grilled them up and they were quite tasty.  We think next time we'll try putting some bell peppers on the kabobs with them.

Moist and tasty. Easy to make. I replaced 1/2 the oil in the recipe with chicken broth to cut down on the fat and I used fat free salad dressing. I will definitely make it again.

I wasn't able to get chicken breasts so I used turkey instead and I used orange bell pepper to go in between and it was SOOO good! Oh yeah,I did not use rosemary I used garlic in stead,it made it very good!

I was at BFF for the week....she said I have this great recipes for Chicken Kabobs for the annual BBQ she has.  I had my reservations...as my pass experience w/ chicken kabobs were always dry and not good at all.  WOW is all I can say.  Very easy to make!  She cubed the chicken and we stayed w/ recipe exactly.  They grill up very nice and it was fun to watch even the picky children eaters go back for 2nds. The chicken went really quick and everyone there wanted the recipe.  We are off to Tahoe for the 4th and I am bringing this recipe for sure.  Really, you must try it. Not the same old boring chicken....it is the best!

This was good, but not really something I would turn to if I really needed to impress someone.  I didn't think the flavors blended all that well, and overall not that tasty.  Perhaps I need a different ranch dressing ... Although all 3 of my boys did at least pick at it, which is better than they often do with a new recipe.

This recipe was fabulous! I only added one tsp of salt, didn't change anything else. Even the most pickiest of eaters gobbled these up at my BBQ, made them yesterday and my husband is already asking for them again! Thank you, for a new family favorite!

These were awesome! I didn't add salt at all and I definitely recommend using fresh rosemary. The dried as a subsitute will not be sufficient for the incredible aroma created by the fresh ingredients. This was so easy. My only recommendation is to skewer them before marinating to eliminate the mess.

I wasn't over the top about most reviewers.  Thought it could have a little more flavor.  Chicken had better flavor later in the evening...kind of like next day lasagna...it makes it that much better!

Pretty darned good :-) I followed the recipe exactly (except I extended the marinading time to 5 hours and soaked the skewers in water for 30 minutes before grilling so they wouldn't catch fire), and threw them on the grill next to veggie kabobs made with red onion, zucchini, and cherry tomatoes (I marinaded the veggie kabobs in italian dressing for 5 hours as well).  Then, I whipped up some rice pilaf and presto -- we had a lovely dinner.  Thanks for the recipe!

excellent!  This turned out so so good.  I alternated chunks of chicken and onion.  Used the onion only because we like grilled onions.

I had a crowd full of Picky guys to cook for this weekend, so I thought i'd give these a try!!! They exceeded my expectations and there were NO leftovers!  They loved them so much and kept telling me they couldnt wait to eat them again.  Thank you so much for this amazing recipe that is now a staple in my household :)

SOO good! I loved this recipe. I made no changes to the actual marinade for the chicken but I doubled it and put the rest of it over chopped red potatoes, summer squash, and green beans. I also added to them garlic powder, red pepper, bread crumbs, and parmesan cheese sprinkled on top. I roasted just the potatoes first for an hour and then added the squash and green beans for another half hour to 45 min. I covered the dish with foil for the entire time except the last half hour and baked it at 425. It was the perfect blend! The only complaint my family had was that there wasn't more and we are a very critical family when it comes to food. Everyone loved it and I can't wait to make it again. It was so easy to make!

I marinated four chicken breasts in the rosemary ranch sauce for a couple hours and broiled them whole instead of making kabobs.  They were moist and flavorful.

Made the marinade as written (except only used 1/2 the amount of salt), cut 3 large chicken breasts into strips & marinated them for 2 hours.  Since it is snowing here (IN APRIL...arrrg), I lined a cookie sheet w/aluminum foil & broiled the strips for about 8 minutes on each side.  LOVED the result!  My extremely picky father even commented that the taste of the chicken was excellent.  Thank you for a great recipe, will FOR SURE make again!

When I first made the marinade and tasted it I was really nervous because it didn't taste too great. But I went ahead and put the chicken in it overnight. The next evening I tossed some peppers and mushrooms in some extra sauce I'd set aside, and put the chicken and veggies on the skewers. I broiled the kabobs for 8-10 minutes, turning once, and they turned out great. The only change I made to the recipe was I used only about half the salt it called for.

The chicken was very moist and tender but I was expecting a lot more flavor. I ended up making a quick dip for the chicken. I'll probably make something close to this again, but not this exact recipe.

UPDATE: MY NEIGHBOR RECENTLY DESCRIBED A PORK DISH SHE ROUTINELY MAKES THAT MADE ME CRAVE THIS RECIPE. THERE IS MUCH TO BE SAID FOR FOLLOWING A RECIPE EXACTLY AS INTENDED AT LEAST ONCE. THESE ARE FANTASTIC IF GRILLED (DO NOT BAKE - IF IT'S TOO COLD TO GRILL, WAIT UNTIL WARM WEATHER RETURNS!). IT'S A SHAME I DIDN'T FIND THIS OUT THE FIRST TIME. Hmmm.... These were allright. A bit tangy for my liking, but decent nonetheless. As a few others have also done, I too baked my kabobs at 350 degrees for 30 minutes (I soaked my wooden skewers in water all day so they'd be safe for oven use). I liked the idea of drizzling some of the cooked marinade over rice as someone suggested, but unfortunately I wasn't a fan. I think I'll give these another try, but will grill or broil my kabobs instead (I think this is the way to go). Thanks anyways, Theresa! :-)

This was too sweet for me and I felt like some of the flavors clashed. I was disappointed. By the time I bought all the ingredients this was a little pricey and I just felt like my hard work didnt pay off.

I don't have a grill so I had to change it up a bit to make in the oven.  I marinated the chicken for about four hours and then baked them with baby bella mushrooms, onions, and zucchini (which I also marinated for a while, as well).  I had soaked the skewers in water for a couple hours and then baked it all at 450 for 10 minutes or so, and then turned them and cooked for another 10-15 minutes.  They came out really well! I served it with garlic and olive oil couscous, and they went well together.  My boyfriend really liked this recipe and I'm sure we'll use it again.

Wow - this was SO good!  My entire family loved it...even my picky 2-yr old.  I cut the breasts into thirds, marinated for 45 minutes, and then baked at 400 degrees for about 30 minutes.  It was super moist and very flavorful.  Thanks for the great recipe...it'll be a weekly staple at our house!

This was a good flavor, but not quite a strong enough flavor for us.  I didn't end up making kabobs or grilling either- I baked this in the marinade in the oven for about 30 mins at 350.  Turned out ok- just needed some sauce or something.  Update* I made a warm sauce with ranch and worcestershire and served this over jasmine rice- yum!  Very moist and tasty!

4 for flavor, 3 for texture.  These were dry after broiling.  Used the Creamy Buttermilk Dressing from this site in place of ranch.  Family liked this entree.

I don't usually write reviews..I am a complete mess in the kitchen so when a recipe doesnt turn out right I dont know if its because of me or the recipe.  That being said, this recipe is awesome!  It was so easy to make and everyone loved it including my "I love my mom but not her cookin" kids.  I only marinated for 30 minutes then broiled the chicken in the oven.  It was full of flavor!  I also only put in 1 tsp of salt and it was perfect.  Thanks for the great recipe!

This marinade is wonderful! I will leave overnight next time. I baked chicken and served over rice which was perfect. Definitely a keeper and will make part of my rotation and try veggies too.

I made these as part of my Christmas Eve buffet.  I followed the recipe exactly except that I marinated mine all day.  They had great flavor and husband has asked for them again.  Even his very picky mother liked them which is saying a lot.

This recipe is great!  The only thing I did different is I left out the salt.  I have used the sauce with chicken, pork chops, and steaks and everything has been SO tender.

These turned out really well.  They were very moist with a lot of flavor.  I found the combination perfect ... not sure what others meant about it being a weird combo.  Next time I will mince a bit more rosemary to sprinkle on right after they come off the grill for added flavor and garnish.

This is good. I doubled the recipe and added a lot more lemon juice and black pepper. Skipped the sugar. I broiled mine for about 12 minutes total and they turned out great. Thanks!

Pretty good!  I think I overcooked the chicken on the grill.  I used the marinade on potatoes, onions and mushrooms and grilled them too - they were fabulous.

This was pretty good but was lacking a little zing.  It did keep the chicken super moist and was easy to prepare.  I found it was a little oily and it tasted like there was a weird coating.  Perhaps if I cranked up the flame on the grill, it would have been a little crispier but I didn't want to overcook and dry them out.  I think I would cut the oil a little bit and either marinate longer or add something extra to spice it up.

These had a good flavor but there is something "off" in the mixture of different flavors in the ingredients. I had read other reviews and decided to make in the oven, but will try again on the grill to see if this changes things a bit.

I was a bit skeptical at first, but the marinade smells so awesome when you put it together! My family absolutly loves this meal! I usually make more marinade than the recipe says, put it aside and drizzle it over the rice that I serve with the chicken!  YUM!!

MY family loved this but I thought it was just OK. You really have to be a lover of Ranch dressing. Next time I will use less worchester sauce and less salt. I used fresh rosemary from my garden and that did help it I think.

This marinade is incredible. Everyone loved it. They all wanted to recipe and said that they had never had such moist chicken before. I marinaded the chicken for about 4 hours before putting it onto skewers and grilling. I highly recommend this in place of the same ol' barbeque chicken that we can all get sick of in the summer. Thanks for yet another great recipe!

This marinade is fantastic! I've made several times and will continue to make over and over.  While this works well with whole chicken breasts or boneless breasts I would definitely recommend making theese as kabobs, they really soak up the great flavor of the marinade better this way and come out absolutely scrumptious off the grill... also I've had good luck with letting the kabobs sit in the marinade for up to 24 hours.  I've made this with dried rosemary if I didn't have any fresh on hand and it still comes out great. I also agree with the reviewer that suggested Trader Joe's ranch dressing, it really is the best.  Thanks for this wonderful recipe!!

Chicken cooked tender but it didn't have the ranch flavor.  (Marinated in a container for 8 hours) Maybe it should be basted with some ranch near the end?  People liked how it turned out, but no one tasted ranch.

I LOVE this marinade.  I don't bother with kabobs, I simply marinate chicken breasts and thighs for 3 to 4 hours then grill it.   The chicken is incredibly juicy and tender.  I also tried this with pork chops.  It wasn't quite as good as the chicken, but my husband loved it.

And the angels sang..."YUMMM!" I didn't kabob them but rather cut the breasts into strips. The leftovers (what few there were) were great in burritos.

I just have to add my two cents about this great recipe! When I made the marinade the first time, I wasn't so sure about it. However, I had read the reviews and knew that others had the same thought, but I also knew that those same people thought the recipe was great. I've made it at least five times now, and it's always been amazing. The first time I just marinated whole chicken breasts for a couple hours and grilled them using dried rosemary instead of fresh because that's all I had. I also omitted the salt thinking it wasn't really necessary. The second time I made them as kabobs and used the fresh rosemary -- a definite must!!! -- just a pinch of salt, and brown sugar instead of white. I also marinated vidalia onion, red pepper, and mushrooms in a separate bowl and added that to the kabobs as well as fresh pineapple. Oh man, they were to die for! I heated the marinade from the veggies to serve over rice which everyone but me has just loved. It has a bit of a tang to it that I just don't prefer with rice. I served the kabobs with a 5-blend rice, tossed veggie salad and fresh fruit. It's a great summer meal! The last three times I've made it we've had company, and everyone (even the picky eaters and kids) have loved it and asked for the recipe. Thanks for a really great recipe!! 

Just a note: although using dried rosemary still makes it taste great, using fresh rosemary makes it even better. So if you can get fresh do so :)

This was excellent. I made very few adjustments. Used dried rosemary since that's all I had and I did not use any salt. A little of the rosemary goes a long way so I will probably use less next time. This browns up beautifully.

This is one of the best recipes for chicken kabobs ever. I am not a huge fan of ranch, but thought it sounded otherwise good, plus it had good reviews. I'm glad I tried it because it is not only easy to make, but delicious as well. I made it for a large group of people, and everyone was raving. Thanks!

Tis is AWSOME!!! After marinading the chicken, I added sliced bell peppers, chunked pineapple, and whole mushrooms to the kabob. I then coated the whole kabob with the marinade before grilling. I cut the salt down by 1 tsp and then added some garlic powder & garlic salt to the marinade. I served this with bacon wrapped shrimp & a nice salad. A nice summertime dinner!!! Definatly a keeper

MMMMMMM!  Love this chicken!  The oil and sugar are unnecessary (and this cuts back on fat and calories!).  I have also used dried rosemary because I don't always have fresh in the house.  I make this a couple times per month.  It doubles easily and is always a crowd pleaser.  Adults and kids gobble it up!

Absolutely superb.  Everyone enjoyed this, and like others we marinated veggies as well.  Used zucchini, peppers, mushrooms, and squash.  My two year old even ate the mushrooms when they were marinated in this!

My 9 year old son loved this and kept asking for more off of my plate! It was very easy and I had all the ingredients on hand. 
The only reason why I gave it 4 stars was because it seemed a little salty. I will cut down or omit the salt altogether next time, but it will be made again!

These were excellent.  Flavor was wonderful.  I ended up marinating them for about 4 hours and they turned out perfect!  Made a little extra marinade to brush on as they were grilled.

These were great, even with veg. oil instead of olive oil. I also didn't have the vinegar, so I doubled the lemon juice.

Our house loves this. We had to add bacon to it (thick cut) and our friends call us to ask when we're making it next!

My family loved this!  I butterflied the chicken breasts and let them soak for a couple of hours and then cooked them on the grill.  I used the Lowfat buttermilk ranch recipe from this site and even dipped the chicken in some of the ranch dressing as we were eating it.  Will definetly make again.

Loved this and have made it a couple times. Once I was missing rosemary and substituted garlic it was wonderful as well.

I thought these were pretty good but my husband thought they were boring.  Probably won't make again just because my husband didn't care for them.

So good. I couldn't imagine what this would all taste like together but the reviews were so positive so I made it! I left some sauce seperate and then heated it in a pot.  I also used chicken breasts so I marinated them for a few hours before throwing them on the grill.

Wonderful!  We made these on our own first and loved them so much we made them when we had guests for dinner.  Everyone loved them - very tender and not dry at all.  We used FF Ranch too, and I think they were great!

Excellent.  Versatile recipe. I was in a hurry and did what others suggested and baked the meat and sauce in the oven (without the skewers).  I used thick, boneless pork chops, cut into cubes, because that's what I had on hand.  Next time, I'll probably omit the sugar as it was too sweet for us. Served over basmati rice.  Delish!  Maybe I'll add some veggies next time - the sauce is too good to waste!  Next time I try this recipe, I'd like to grill the meat in my grilling basket, instead of threading onto skewers.

I have to say that everyone in my family had something to say about these.   This chicken was very tasty and moist. Before I BBQ'd them I covered them with foil and baked for about 20 minutes just to get them started and then I BBQ'd.   
VERY TASTY!!!!! They also made great sandwiches the next day.
Thanks for the recipe

This was soooo good, my 5yr old daughter couldn't keep her fingers out of the extra sauce we kept to the side for basting.  My husband says he's sick of chicken and doesn't want to eat it for a couple of months, and even he had to admit how good this recipe is!!! I can't wait to try it with pork kabobs.

"This was the best chicken you've ever made" exclaimed my husband after eating it! Thanks for this wonderful easy recipe. I grated a small onion and added a couple cloves of minced garlic. Tasted so yummy....

Loved this recipe.  Whole family asked for it again. Made my own Ranch Dressing with the dry ranch recipe on this site.  The last time I had the chicken marinating my husband thought I had forgotten to put it in the oven so we ended up with it baked and that was wonderful as well!

Very good; thank you!  I only used 4 chicken breasts since that's all I had.  Marinated in the mixture for about 5 hours just bc I wasn't ready to make them until much later than I had anticipated.  Good flavor, and easy too.  Bf loved them; he ate two skewers.  So much for leftovers!  Thanks!

Didn't change a thing.  Loved them, very moist and flavorful.  Paired them with Rosemary Red Potatoes from this site and a green salad.

The first time I made this, I was in love!!  The kabobs were so moist and delicious!!  I am hooked on the marinade, and have done chicken breasts with this marinade as well. The chicken is so moist and flavorful every time!  I will be making this all summer!:) Thanks for a great recipe!!!!

Excellent! I followed the recipe exactly, except for eliminating the optional sugar and these were very tasty. I only had time for about 30 minutes of marinating, but you could still taste the flavor. I will definitely make this again.

Wow!These kabobs were delicious! The marinade provided great flavor, and also made the chicken extremely tender and moist. I marinated the chicken for about 1.5 hours, meanwhile, soaking bamboo skewers in water. For the marinade, I used Hidden Valley Ranch and dried rosemary, which worked fine. The only changes I will make next time is to try fresh rosemary and CHOP it into little pieces (pieces of rosemary kept getting stuck in our teeth!), and save a little of the marinating liquid before adding the chicken to use as a basting/dipping sauce. Grilled on medium heat on a gas grill for ten minutes (lid closed), turning once. Make sure you do not forget to oil the grill grate, otherwise the kabobs will stick horribly!!!

This recipe was very good.  I didn't have prepared ranch, but I used some powder ranch dressing with mayonaisse.  I liked the taste that the worcestire gave it.  I didn't use the sugar, and only marinated it for about 10 minutes (that was all the time I had), and it was so moist.

This is awesome! My husband was not too sure of it since it calls for ranch, not a big fan. But it turned out so great. We added some carrots, onions and cerely (yes it is good) in another mixture and it was so yummy. I am making it again with Pork shoulder! I am planning on making this again, and again, and again!

Made these for my boyfriend and didn't tell him what was in the marinade (he doesn't like ranch). He liked them, thought they came out similar to chicken with a creamy cheese spread. I made them in the oven due to weather.

This was as fabulous as all the reviews stated!  My whole family loved it.  I only used a pinch of sugar and marinated it for about five to six hours then grilled.  My husband said he wants this at least once a week!

I made these as an appetizer for Father's Day and everyone loved them. I followed the recipe exactly except I ended up leaving them marinate for about 3 hours. Not sure if that made a difference but they were awesome. I will definitely be making these again!

This was great!!!  I added onions, peppers & mushrooms to the skewers with the chicken and had a great meal over jasmine rice.  Even as micro-waved leftovers the next day, the grilled goodness and moistness was retained.  Thanks for this recipe.

I thought these were very good. I will definitely make the marinade again! I wrapped a 1/2 a piece of bacon around each piece of chicken and then grilled. My husband didn't leave any leftovers!

It just doesn't get any better than this! Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe!

The marinade is also fantastic for pork. I used it with a pork loin roast and it turned out very tender and juicy; I would advise to increase amt of rosemary if using for pork - otherwise no changes.

I omitted the rosemary and was a little nervous about how it would turn out, but the chicken still had great flavor and was verry moist!  I grilled this while out camping, it was very easy and quick and my family LOVED it.  I served it with a rice pilaf and tossed salad.  I will definitely make this again!

I marinated the chicken for about an hour then baked in oven (450 deg) for about 20 min.  The chicken was VERY tender and VERY tasty.  Thanks Theresa for giving me another 5 star recipe for my recipe box!  :)

This marinade is much too delicious to waste.  Used four large boneless chicken breasts, cut them in half and marinated them in the sauce for about 45 min.  Meanwhile I put some rice in the rice cooker and sauted some vidalia onion, sliced mushrooms, yellow squash,diced mushrooms and peppers in a little EVOO. Add some pepper & extra rosemary to the veggies. I added the veggies to the chicken and marinade and baked in the oven covered for about 45 min.  The chicken was tender and the sauce delicious over rice.  I'll definitely make this again.  Next time I would cut back a little on the salt in the marinade.

This recipe was a hit with my family! The chicken really does come out tender and juicy.  I cooked mine in an electric oven under the broiler and used a broiler pan.  The marinade was a bit thick, so I whisked in a few tablespoons of water before I poured it into the drip pan. After I cooked the kabobs 10 minutes per side, I poured the drippings and marinade over brown rice and it was excellent!! The one thing I'll do differently nex time I make this dish is to soak my bamboo skewers in cold water before I roast the chicken. I could barely smell the delicious food over the stench of burning wood!!

Followed the marinade almost to a T- I went a little light on the oil because I thought it not necessary to have that much. I did add orange bell pepper and pineapple chunks to the skewers and they turned out just great. My husband, my dad and I all just loved this recipe. Next time I may add some onion just to compliment the flavors, but the bell pepper and pineapple are a must for you to try if you try this recipe. I loved it!

This recipe is a definite keeper! We only had two chicken breasts on hand, so we added baby portabella mushrooms, red bell pepper & onion to the skewers - perfect for two people! We also cooked down the leftover marinade to serve as sauce over kabobs & rice. This was SO delicious & a perfect summer-time recipe for the grill. Will definitely make again & again!

This was wonderful, my in-laws loved it and the kids too! I used dried rosemary and omitted the sugar, I also marinated all day. I heated the remaining sauce and poured it over rice - YUMMY! My mother-in-law is going to make it for her reunion party in a couple of weeks.

I could eat this 3 times a week and enjoy every bite! I used cheap frozen chicken breasts, and the marinade made them taste like premium cuts! I sent this to all my friends to share in my good fortune finding this recipe! I will cut salt next time, but it was still simply scrumptious!

This was an easy recipe to make and tasted great!  We didn't change a thing about it and will regularly use this recipe.  I put my chicken over a bed of lettuce, and the marinade is so rich that I didn't even need extra dressing!

It was very tender; however, I did not find much flavor outside of the Rosemary. I think this flavor could be duplicated without the ranch dressing (very messy)

I just made this for dinner for my husband who isn't too fond of chicken because it is dry. I really like this chicken a lot. He said it was dried out and tasted great. I decided to bake it in the oven for 20 mins instead of the bbq and all went well. Thanks for the recipe!

This was very good and I will definitely make it again.  Like other reviewers I omitted the salt and cut the sugar in half.  Next time I will eliminate the sugar all together.  It was a bit too sweet for my taste.  I served this with fresh green beans and a peruvian rice that I got at Trader Joe's.  The rice and the chicken were a good combination of flavors.

Absolutely wonderful!  We used apple cider vinager instead of white, and didn't use sugar.  It was amazing!  We also baked it in the oven, as suggested in a previous review, with all of the marinade.  The baking thickened up the marinade, making it a wonderful rice topping.  This recipe is definitely a favorite.

I almost never have all the ingredients listed for the recipes and have to "alter" a bit, besides am always adding stuff to "make it my own" That said, this is really very flavorful and the chicken came out very tender. I didn't have ranch "dressing"(wet) but had the HVR dry dressing(used a half pack) and had to substitute the olive oil for what I had on hand (vegetable oil). Also eliminated the 2 tsp. salt(I thought the dry ranch dressing would be salty enough) and added 1 tsp. garlic powder and added more black pepper and some crushed red pepper flakes- we like it on the spicy side. Delicious! Will def be making it again! Thanks for sharing

This recipe is incredible. 

I followed it exactly (a new one for me), but ended up with too much sauce.  I hated to throw it away so I poured it over asparagus, thinly sliced eggplant and yellow bell pepper and broiled it in the oven.  

Both the chicken and the veggies made for an amazing picnic sandwich.

Thank you so much for the recipe.  Definitely a keeper.

The fresh rosemary really made the dish!  It was so light for a hot summer night.  Served it with rice, but next time, (and there will definitely be many of them!), I think I'll serve it with pasta and salad.

Chicken kabobs came out moist and delicious.  Used a locally made ranch dressing and fresh chopped rosemary.  Chicken was so tasty!  Put some of the marinade on the side and added extra ranch to dip the cooked chicken in....sooo good!

The chicken was very tender but I didn't taste the marinade very much.  I think next time I make this I will save some marinade for basting.

This recipe is amazing! I just made it using my indoor grill and the chicken came out flavorful and juicy! I put a sprig of rosemary in a pot of rice I was cooking and it made the perfect meal for my husband and I! Thank-you!

This was simple delicious!!  Followed the recipe to a 't' (although I may have added more rosemary as it is hard to measure!) and my whole family loved it!!  The chicken was tender and flavorful!  Thank you - it is a keeper!!

Delicious recipe that we'll be using all summer. I used dried rosemary since I didn't have fresh and I marinated the chicken all afternoon. It was tender and moist. I wouldn't hesitate making this one for company.  Thanks for a great recipe!

YUMM-O! I put this together 2 days ago intending to cook it that day but we had some stuff come up and so it marinated in the fridge for 2 days. These are SO tender, moist and flavorful! It only took about 10 or 11 minutes on the grill and they were perfect. Like pretty much everyone else said, I omitted the sugar and salt and they are just fine. I'm enjoying these with a tall glass of lemonade!

Woweeeeee Woweeeeee, this is sooooo good.  My significant other only likes beef & potatoes & even got a woweee out of him.  Absolutely delicious without one change.  Did not have enough kebab holders; so just quarter a couple of the breasts.........still just absolutely wonderful.  Cooked a little asparagus on the grill with the chicken.  Thank you for a great recipe.

For once I added nothing and took nothing away.  It has a different but good taste.  Great combination of flavors.  The only thing I did different was just put the whole chicken breast on the grill.  My 4 year old said "mmmmm this is some good chicken!"

Four and a half stars - I thought these were excellent, but my husband (who likes things "plain") wasn't thrilled, but said they were ok.  I marinated the chicken for about 4 hours before grilling and the result was very tender, melt-in-your-mouth chicken.  And don't listen to my husband - I thought the flavor from the marinade was very subtle, but enough to give it a little something.  I did probably use slightly less rosemary than what was called for - I just used up what I had so it was about 3/4 tbsp.  I'll definitely make these again!

My husband liked it.  My 7 and 4 year olds and I didn't like it.  We didn't like the rosemary with the ranch flavor.  I let chicken and steak soak in it for a couple of hours in the fridge.  I preferred it on the steak to the chicken.  I probably won't be making this again.

I made these in the grill pan on top of the stove since the weather was too icky to go out and use the real grill.  The marinade is SOOOO tasty.  I ended up simmering it for 10+ minutes and using it over rice.  Delicious.

Very yummy! After reading reviews, I cut the oil down to a couple tablespoons and marinated for several hours. I dumped the chicken with marinade in the the oven. (375 for 30 min) I can't wait to try this on the grill (it was rainy & chilly last night).

We all cleaned our plates!  The only thing I didn't put in was white vinegar because I didn't have any.  I did back the chicken in the oven instead of grilling.  The chicken was so so tender and the taste was wonderful.  I didn't have fresh rosemary so I used the dried.  This was so good I will definitely cook this again.  It was easy and tasty!  I served with rice and peas.

We eat this now once a week - my kids love this. I suggest you make extra, its heavenly thrown on a salad the next day. Or simply eaten right out of the storage container you put it in!! Better then five stars.

Very good.  I used this with whole boneless, skinless chicken breasts because I was too lazy to cut them and skewer them.  I marinated for about 1.5 hours and then grilled on the foreman.  I thought the taste was 5 stars, but I the recipe needs some tweaking.  I definitely think less oil can be used, no additional salt, and no sugar.  I also used dried rosemary, which was definitely fine.  While this was very good, I don't know if I'll be making it again because it's not good enough to validate the fat content.

I have made this recipe so many times and everyone always loves it. People who don't even like Ranch, like this. I marinate it for 12 hours. It's so yummy.

This was terrific! Didn't marinate any veggies with it, but would definitely do so next time. Marinated about 3-4 hours and had outstanding flavor. Can cut back or omit salt - I didn't this time but will next - there's plenty of sodium in the Worchestershire! Fresh rosemary is key, and no need for sugar. We grilled, and I think this made it, but baking would probably be okay for the winter months. Hubby and I thought it would make a good chicken sandwich w/some provolone or other cheese, too. Or cut up on a salad. Kids gobbled it up, too. Great flavor!

what a delightful recipe!!! i was a bit leery of the concoction for the chicken to marinade in but the marriage of flavors was so tasty! i added a little brown sugar (i find it carmamelizes nicely and gives chicken a glossy finish and added paprika on the kebobs for color. the chicken had a wonderful barbecue flavor and the inside was very moist and really flavorful. ranch dressing and rosemary...who would have known? this one will not disappoint.

Excellent!  This is a keeper.  I only made enough for my husband and I - and my children - who rarely like anything new - loved it!  I also added half the sugar - it was perfect.  Next time I will make more!

This is a great recipe!  The chicken stays moist and the flavor is wonderful.  I was a little hesitant because sometimes rosemary can be overpowering-but not in this recipe-it is just perfect.  I followed the recipe except for leaving out the sugar entirely and cutting the salt in half.  Perfect!

I cooked it in a pan and skipped the grill/kabob part. Just marinate the chicken and pour it all in pan, stir and cook until chicken isn't pink.  Tastes great.

These were pretty good.  I marinated them all day, and although they were very moist, the ranch dressing really seemed to overpower all of the other flavors.  I did omit the salt based on other's reviews.  I'm not sure if I'll try this one again, but it was a good meal.  Thanks!

This recipe was ok.....I just don't think it had a lot of flavor.  The little bit of flavor it did have was good though.  I might make it again but try to spice it up a little or marinate it longer.

This is a great recipe and so easy to modify depending on what is in your fridge at the time.  I think the only absolute items are the ranch dressing, the olive oil and the pepper.  We didn't even cut up the tenderloins or put them on skewers--we just grilled them as is.  EASY and moist.

This recipe has a nice flavor. I used slightly less salt than the recipe called for, otherwise followed it exactly. If you like rosemary, give this a try. I served it with couscous and watermelon for a perfect summer meal.

These were easy and yummy. I used chicken tenders and didn't make them into kabobs. I followed the rest of the recipe exactly except I used dried rosemary because I didn't have any fresh. I'm sure I will use this recipe many times in the future. I cooked them inside on a grill pan because I didn't feel like messing with the grill and they turned out great.

I was really nervous when I smelled the marinade for this dish - it smelled like nothing but ranch dressing.  Don't get me wrong - I like ranch dressing well enough, but I feared that it would make my chicken really tangy.  It even freaked me out enough that I doctored it a little, adding cajun spice and chili powder.  I was pleasantly surprised!  It didn't taste like ranch dressing at all.  I didn't make skewers - I marinated whole chicken breasts, adding about 2x the amount of dried rosemary (didn't have fresh), cajun spice and chili powder.  I marinated for about an hour. I then grilled the whole chicken breast in a cast iron pan, basting with the marinade throughout.  I also threw a few whole crimini mushrooms in the marinade and then around the periphery of the pan.  The end result was a grilled chicken with a very nicely-flavored glaze, and the crimini mushrooms were the best.  I would do it exactly the same way next time.

So far, I have made this twice and it is quite good. The second time, I realized that I only had Ranch Free, rather than regular Ranch dressing, and it still worked fine, though the consistency of the marinade was slightly different. This marinade is a little different, but extremely savory and yummy, even for picky eaters. Thanks!

This is an absolutely wonderful recipe. 
I made it exactly as written except for omitting 1 tsp of salt.  We added vidalia onions and green peppers cut into eights with the chicken. Also saved a little of the marinade to use at the table.   I can highly recommend this recipe

This was yummy.  Probably deserves 4.5 stars but I reserve 5 stars for the honey chicken kabobs that were the biggest hit ever here.

But I'll definitely be making these again too!

Delicious!  I cut back on both the salt and the sugar.  This one's a keeper!
