It doesn't get any easier than this!  Try adding some of your own fruit to the Cherry Pie Filling Base--use whatever you have on hand--canned or fresh.

Great recipe! My husband and son both love this one. I use this one a lot when I'm short on time or need something simple to bring to a potluck.  It's easy to keep the ingredients on hand in the pantry. Add a dollop of whipped topping to make a fast dessert.

Great recipe and super easy.  I used the sugar free cherrie filling and also sugar free fruit cocktail and no one knew the difference.  It has splenda as a substitute but no one noticed and will be making alot during the summer!

Easiest salad I have ever made!  It is always a hit at potluck dinners as well.  I now keep the ingredients on hand for a fast dessert. Sometimes I will use one larger can of cherry pie filling (or one with more cherries) with 2 cans of fruit cocktail.

I love this! I think it is especially good after sitting in the fridge for a couple of days. You cant mess this up.

This is my family's oldest fruit salad recipe. But instead of using canned fruit cocktail I use canned pineapple chunks canned mandarin oranges and fresh bananas. If you slide your finger down the middle of the peeled bananas three sections and break them into chunks rather than slice them they won't stick to the bowl. This is really really good.  Reduced sugar cherry pie filling is a nice substitute.

It's yummy but super sweet!! The bananas definitely help spread the sticky cherry filling out some, but you could stretch it even more with other fruits or I don't know what else - pudding, whipped topping, etc.? A little goes a long way!

My husband liked this better than I did.  I thought it was pretty sweet and I used fruit cocktail in it's juice and sugar-free cherry filling.  Probably won't make again.

Sometimes I'll add some cool whip to the mixture, it lightens it up a little. I've used blueberry filling, and strawberry filling as well.
Always turns out great!

I give this five stars for simplicity and taste! We've made this for a long time in my family. You can add whatever fruit you want, and we always add marshmallows too. It's sooo easy, and kids love it!

I wasn't that impressed with this.  I could taste the can from the fruit cocktail and it was very sweet.  Although my grand-daughter loved it, I doubt I'll make it again.
