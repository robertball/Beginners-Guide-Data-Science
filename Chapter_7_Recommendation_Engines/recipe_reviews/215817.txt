Pampered chef has this recipe. If you want to cut out some steps, use a rotisserie chicken from the grocery store, preferably the Italian seasoned kind. Use the whole thing. It's the perfect amount. I also use oven ready lasagna noodles. Be sure to add about 1/4 of water and 1/4 of milk to the Alfredo sauce because the no boil noodles absorb some of the liquid.

This is an exceptional recipe!!  It was easy to make, and you can modify it to suit your taste.  I followed the recipe with a few changes: I used 2 cloves minced garlic with the chicken/Alfredo mixture, and made it ahead of time and let it sit in the fridge and get all garlicky and happy!  Like the other review I also sprinkled about 1/2 cup of Parmesan cheese between the layers. Also, instead of cooking up an entire package of lasagna noodles I used 4 per layer (12).  I did use a 9x13 glass baking pan, and found that 35mins at 350F was enough to heat it through and melt the mozzarella, with a crispy brown edge!  Yummo!!! This is a must try, you'll love it.

This was very good. I did use three jars of alfredo sauce and switched the spinach for broccoli because my family does not like spinach. Nice twist to regular lasagna.

This recipe was fairly easy to make, I did not have enough ricotta cheese, so I substituted a block of softened cream cheese for one of the pts. of ricotta.  It was creamy and delicious, an enjoyable treat for the entire family.

I made this for a ladies dinner and it was a great hit--I had many requests for the recipe.  The recipe doesn't need many modifications but I found the alfredo sauce a little too thick so I thinned it with 1/3 - 1/2  cup skim milk and I sprinkled Parmesian cheese in each layer as well.  The whole process of making this takes some time (as with any lasagna) but the results are worth it!  Really delicious!

Except that I used broccoli instead of spinach, I made this recipe as per the recipe.  Oh and I added salt and pepper to the cheese and broccoli mixture.  EXCELLANT recipe!  Thank you Sybil for a wonderful main dish that's going in my regular menu at home.

This lasagna was a hit!  I did skip the ricotta cheese because no one likes it.  I also used chopped broccoli instead of spinach.  I doubled the chicken to make it more healthy.  I also used Classico new reduced calorie Alfredo Sauce.

This is FANTASTIC!  Everyone loved it!! I made "Easy Alfredo Sauce I" to go with this, it was out of this world - so easy too.  I keep 1c measures of shredded cooked chicken in the freezer to make meals like this more convenient, and this is one meal they were perfect for.  I doubled the spinach too, but we're all big fans of spinach - that's all I changed :) yum we'll have this regularly!

this is more a warning than a review:  Do not use oven-bake lasagna noodles!  they were chewy so this was not good.  There is not enough liquid to cook those type of noodles correctly.  Also, make sure you save half the alfredo sauce for the second layer!  It wasn't good, but I think that is because I'm a horrible cook...

This is SO good and easy! I have made it a few times now and the only thing I have done different was, adding 1 egg to the ricotta mixture I think it holds it together better. Everyone LOVES this! Even my husband who HATES spinach.

To fix the problem of it not staying together well I would add an egg to the ricotta mixture.

Definitely do yourself a favor and make a quick homemade alfredo sauce instead of using the jarred stuff. There are a couple of great recipes on here for homemade alfredo. They only take a few extra minutes, but the results are well worth it. I, like several others, used a rotisserie chicken with great results. Nice recipe. It was well received by all who tried it :)

I thought this was absolutely delicious.  It was a definite great alternative to regular lasagna.  My 12-year-old son was a bit turned off by the way it looked ("WHITE lasagna mom????") but he ate up every bite that was on his plate!  I will be making this again and again.  Thanks!!

Very good.  Made couple modifications.  Used bag of fresh spinach, sauteed with some sliced mushrooms and onion.  Used low fat Alfredo sauce and sprinkled parm cheese between layers.  Next time I will use a store bought rotisserie chicken as the chicked was bland and a little dry.

This is REALLY yummy.  I think next time I will reduce both the cheeses by a third to a half, and increase the veggies by triple or even quadruple! I put a whole package of chopped broccoli in ours in addition to the spinach, and even then I could have doubled both. I also used Newman's Own Alfredo instead of Classico (personal preference, sorry) and next time I will try using their Roasted Garlic Alfredo for even more flavor.

This is amazing! We all loved it! Even my son who's a very picky eater! The only things I did different is I used cottage cheese instead of ricotta, since we don't like ricotta and i used fresh spinach. And in my opinion cottage works amazingly for pasta. This recipe is definitely a keeper!

Tried this recipe last night and it was fantastic! My guests loved it. I made the chicken in the crockpot with some McCormick's Grill Mates Zesty Herb Marinade to give it some flavor. Instead of dicing the chicken I was able to shred it after cooking it in the crock pot for 6 hours.

LOVED it!!  I soaked the no bake lasagna noodles in garlic salt/regualar salt while I prepared the mixtures.  Also used the precooked sliced chicken breasts from the frozen section.  Added seasons like garlic salt, oregano, italian seasoning to the spinach mixture as well.  On the top I sprinkled feta cheese as well!  It was AMAZING!!

Very good, but if using Rotisserie Chicken and adding Parmesan Cheese be super careful with the salt.

I have been making this for a years with a few changes.  1. I do not cook the spinach, thaw and drain well and add to meat mixture.  2. Add pesto to the ricotta cheese. 3. You can use no boil noodles, but you need to boil slightly. 4. Add garlice and diced onion to meat mixture along with any italian spices of your choice. 6. After you mix up the meat mixture be your own judge you may want a little extra alfredo sauce.  I always buy extra, but if you don't use it all make some bread sticks and use the left overs for dipping. 7. I also always add parmesan cheese, you can add it to the meat mixture or in the layers.  My family is not crazy about spinach, but they love it in this recipe.

This was a great cheater lasagna for a weekday meal.  I didn't use ricotta and just used Mozzerella.  I mixed the spinach in with the alfredo sauce and chicken and used that as a layer. It's a keeper recipe.  I'm bringing it to a potluck on boxing day.

Wasn't crazy about this at all... too gooey! It's fair to say, though that I don't usually like jared alfredo sauce and this recipe uses a ton of it. I'm partial to homemade alfredo sauce. Now if you were to make this with homemade alfredo sauce, I'm pretty sure it would rock.

This will be making it's way into dinner rotation. I substituted cottage cheese and cream cheese blend for the ricotta, added some garlic, salt, pepper, onions, &  basil for flavor and everyone enjoyed it. Easy recipe especially if you already have cooked chicken on hand. My kids didn't even complain about the "GREEN' stuff in it. A crowd pleaser from my 15 month old to my 15 yr. old.

This is a nice departure from traditional lasagna. Add some herbs and seasonings to suit your taste, as it is a little bland as written.  Made a loaf of Jo's Rosemary Bread to go along with it, also on this site.  Add a green salad and you have a very nice meal.

This was SO GOOD! I loved it! I used broccoli instead of spinach and I also used cottage cheese instead of ricotta but that was an accident. It still turned out awesome though! The noodles on top edge were a little crunchy...I don't mind though but if you do, there is extra sauce you may want to put some on before baking. Oh and please don't shun me, but I used canned chicken.

It took longer than 1hr and 30min to make.  It also needs more seasoning, especially in the spinach/ricotta mixture. I'm really sorry I didn't read the low reviews, because I wouldn't have bothered to make it.  I'm sure my husband will say it's very bland : (

This recipe is excellent! I used ready-to-bake noodles, and it turned out fine. I just let the noodles soak for five minutes in warm salty water before layering the lasagna.

I made this for my boyfriend and myself for father's day. It was fantastic!! Granted I omitted the spinach. I used oven-ready noodles as well. The only downside was the top of the lasagna (I'm guessing it was the noodles) bubbled up into crust-like strips, where I had laid the noodles. The noodles were too close to the top I'm guessing, but I'm not 100% sure... Otherwise, it was so good! My part of the leftovers are already gone!

LOVED this! Unfortunately, it is very unhealthy. I used only 1 pint of riccotta, 3 cups of Mozzarella cheese, and 16 oz of spinach to make it somewhat healthier. I also used Oven Ready Lasagna Noodles and covered it with aluminum foil, and the noodles baked very well. I will make this again. Very Delicious!! Update: For an easier, cheaper, healthier version I used 1 pk. frozen cheese ravioli, 1/2 pk. frozen spincach, 1 jar alfredo, 1 small can mushrooms. Cook ravioli according to package, while boiling,cook spinach according to package, add alfredo and simmer until warm. You still get the pasta/alfredo/spinach taste!

I thought this recipe was fabulous! I changed it a bit by using 1 pint ricotta cheese, 1 pint cottage cheese. I also used two different types of alfredo sauce to increase interest in the flavors. I seasoned it with black pepper and rosemary garlic seasoning. Bit hit with my family and a new personal favorite!

Rather tasteless. I had already added garlic and Italian spices to the ricotta mix, but it did not do the trick. Not cooked chicken but roasted chicken from a store like Costco's needs to be used. The chicken needs to be very flavorful.  This would bring the rating to a 4 star.
Also be aware that it makes a huge lasagna.

Nothing goes wrong instead of using just regular chicken breast diced, use rotisserie chicken and sprinkle a little garlic salt with your spinach mixture and it helps if you taste your seasoning to suit your own taste and don't pile on the spinish you want a thin layer and what seems very helpful to my recipe don't use the whole bag of spinich beacuse you are going to have other things added to the spinich mixure. I used frozen fresh spinich and steamed it just a little to get the chill off the spinich and never use canned spinich and if you don't feel comfortable with spinich, use broccoli cuts instead and remember other peoples taste may not agree with yours and be creative and use the amount of seasonings that suits your taste and then you have a positive meal outcome, I promise... promise you a delightful meal

This was excellent! I brought some of the leftovers to work and everyone that tasted it asked for the recipe. The only changes I made was used a rotisserie chicken and add parmesan cheese (sprinkled into the layers). I also used 1/2 jar of alfredo sauce on top of final layer of noodles, then the mozzerella cheese. YUMMY!

This recipe was absolutely amazing!  I made my own alfredo sauce ( I was given an awesome recipe), substituted fresh spinach, but otherwise followed the recipe.  My husband and 3 kids ate with gusto, and it has been requested many times for a weekend dinner.  Well worth the time it takes to make.

It was pretty good, but I think if I try it again I'll try using broccoli rather than spinach. The spinach kinda overpowered the other flavors for me. When I made this I used 4 chicken breasts rather than 3.

This came out really good(on the bottom)not so good on the top! Took the easy road and used No-Bake Noodles, not a great idea with the way this recipes is layered, noodles on very top didnt get as soft(done)as the others in the middle and bottom. Overall I will make again and make sure that the top layer of no-bake noodles has sauce on top before I cover it with cheese.But definately a winner in my book(and hubby's too)

Wonderful!!  For those of you who love chicken like I do....this is your recipe!  I always add parsley and 1 egg to my ricotto cheese and evaporated milk to the alfredo sauce to make it go a little further.  My family loves it!!

i LOVED this recipe! it was surprisingly easy (this was my very first lasagna, ever!) and it tasted SO good. I seasoned the chicken with a little bit of Goya Adobo, but that's the only thing I changed at all... I made it for a Sunday dinner and it was a HUGE hit!!

This was fairly easy to make. Everyone loved it. Though the recipe was a bit large for a small family. I'll probably cut it in half next time.

I love chicken alfredo sauce with pasta but was excited to try this out for my husband and I. The first time I made it i put a little less spinach in and had lots of it left over. I just wanted to try it and it tasted amazing! My husband was licking his fingers and asked me to make it again tomorrow night.He took most of it to work for lunch and to his mother. He was so excited. I made it the next day and it was more spinachy and my husband loved it even more. Overall I have to say that this is an amazing recipe and would recommend it for guests or just for a romantic dinner for two.  :) cheers

AWESOME! I am a terrible cook, a very green beginner and after reading other reviews about adding milk and water this was a complete success for me!! Not many of my "new tries" work out the first time so this was great! Taste was awesome and not bland like most other things seem to turn out for me. :)

This really was missing something. It was dry - definitely needed more sauce. And it just was bland. I was really excited about making this one, as it seemed like it should be delicious. But it wasn't. It needed garlic (which I added, but clearly not enough) and something else - maybe nutmeg and lots of pepper added to the spinach mixture? Don't know if I'll try this again - it was expensive to experiment with.

This is probably the best recipe I have made on this website-and I have made many....My kids loved this too and they do not like spinach. There wasn't too much spinach for them to taste it (so they said). Excellent recipe! I will make again....I read other reviews and the only thing I did differently was use the ready made noodles. I also added 1/2 cup of milk and 1/2 cup water to the chicken mixture because the ready made noodles need the moisture. It came out perfect.

The Chicken Lasagna Alfredo was great!  Everyone loved it in my house.  I didn't use the entire bag of spinach so my husband didn't even recognize that it was there.  I think next time I may add more vegetables: like shredded carrots, broccoli, and maybe a few red or yellow peppers!

came out dry and the ricotta overpowers all the other tastes, time consuming for a mediocre at best type of meal. Needs a lot of sprucing up...and can probably do without the chicken...cant even taste it.

Really great! I only bought one jar of alfredo - so I didn't have enough, so I did an allrecipe search and found "quick and easy alfredo sauce" - made that, and tada - it saved the day!  So, I ended up not using the jarred sauce, I used the homemade and it was really tasty - everyone loved it.  Thanks, I will be making this again!

delightfull we even made it without the chicken none on hand.We use wal mart brand of alfredo sauce its really good. We also added fresh mushroom and did not boil the noodles first. I started with a layer of alfredo on bottom of pan n put sauce directly on each noodle to cook them. Thanks for posting.

Wait a few minutes before cutting.  Tastes good though.  Bake on top of a cookie sheet since mine ran over the edges.

Am I confused?  Where do you put the remaining 1/2 jar of alfredo sauce?  I used one jar to mix with the chicken and then it said to spread 1//2 of the remaining jar of alfredo sauce over the spinach layer but then I still have 1/2 of a jar???

This was delicious. I did add some chopped cooked onion to the chicken and some cottage cheese to the ricotta cheese. I made 8 noodles but kept the other measurements pretty much the same! EDIT : I made these into rolls I forgot to mention that!! It's so much easier to make lasagna rolls when making lasagna for company.

This is a great recipe, my only twist was making fresh pasta, adding 2 tbs of pesto to sauce and home made mozzarella and ricotta.

I was so pleasantly surprised at this recipe!  I used rostisserie chicken and Newman's Own instead of Classico.  I used oven ready lasagna noodles, but don't recommend them b/c they were too firm.  My family loved it - will be making this again for sure.
