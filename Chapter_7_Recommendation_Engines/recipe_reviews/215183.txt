This smoothie was just ok for me.  Felt like it was lacking something and the milk made it very thin.  I liked the tartness of the granny smith, but thought it needed something more than a banana.  I will try it again, but will use yogurt instead of the milk and maybe add some blueberries or strawberries.  It is still a great way to get two of your fruits in for the day.

This recipe is great, quick and easy!  I just got my braces on and needed something to numb my mouth.  After making the horrible discovery that we didn't have any ice cream for milkshakes, I hit Allrecipes for smoothies.  This was perfect because it looked nice and required no ice cream.  All ingredients needed were on hand.  After reading reviews, I changed a few things:

           2 smaller apples for kids - "Gala Gems"
           3 ice cubes instead of two
           a little bit of vanilla yogurt
           1% milk
Other than that, I followed the instructions.  The result?  A wonderful smoothie!  It was gulped up by my mom, me and my brother.  Even my brother liked it and that means something!  I will definetely make it again!

I quite enjoyed this smoothie. My family and a I made 4 servings instead of 2, and added 2 tablespoons of honey for a bit of extra sweetness. The banana and apple worked really well together!

This smoothie was pretty good. I used Fuji apples because I didn't have Granny Smith on hand, which definitely made it sweeter. I also added some whipped cream and a dash of extra milk because it tasted strange to me. I'm very happy with the way it turned out! Thanks!

It did not have as much flavor, but it definitely was delicious for a healthy smoothie.

It's really good. I added red red raspberries and used Coconut milk instead of cows milk. Will make this again!

Just a tip: To those saying to thin, you can add more ice or even freeze the banana before cutting it up.  The other banana smoothie recipe I do calls for equal parts milk/ice

This really needs a flavor boost and was too thin to be what I consider a smoothie.  I used a red delicious instead of a granny, and I don't think that modification would make or break this recipe.  I blended, tasted, then added more ice cubes, a little bit of vanilla, and a sprinkle of  cinnamon.  Nutritionally, it breaks down well, and it was OK, but I doubt I'll make again.  If I did, I know that I'd sub non-fat vanilla yogurt for the milk.

I loved it, the only thing was i only used half of a banana because otherwise it overpowers the apple.

It was pretty good considering the little amount of ingredients used. I made one serving, and I felt like I could have made the two serving amount, there wasn't a lot of product after I blended it.

Next time I would use yogurt instead of the milk as the smoothie was very runny.
