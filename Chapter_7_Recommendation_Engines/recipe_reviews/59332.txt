To make this recipe work, you really must have the red pepper paste instead of the tomato paste. It is a spicy paste with a very unique flavor available at specialty food stores and ethnic food markets. Also, I think it's better when the garlic is crushed and use 1 onion.

This was very good! After living in Turkey for two years, I have been searching for a good recipe to recreate the tava we ate there. I omitted the potatoes altogether. That was the way I ate it there, so after reading the reviews I figured I wouldn't even fuss with them. I also replaced the tomatoes with two cans of regular rotel. I topped the dish with some shredded mozzarella for the last 15 minutes - yum! Serve over or with rice... The end result was very similar to what I remember! Thanks for the recipe!

ok, I thought I could pull this off with boneless chicken breasts (we don't care for thighs), and found that the potatoes just wouldn't get done along with the chicken.  I pulled the chicken out, and kept cooking the vegetables up to the designated 1 1/2 hours, but then the potatoes still weren't completely done.  However, the taste was excellent, the chicken came out perfect,my husband and I both loved it. Didn't feel like extra spices were needed, I was glad I didn't "tweak" it any.  I will experiment next time, maybe pre-cook the potatoes a bit, because this is well worth it!  Thanks for the post.

I have made this several times and its great!You might want to add a can of Rotel to this to spicen it up, thats the only thing I have found so far that makes this taste the same as when I used to eat this in Adana Turkey. You can even add Squash to it and anything else.

I was stationed in Turkey for 17 months while in the Airforce.  This recipe is the closest to Chicken Tava that I've ever been able to find.  It's honestly delicious.  I find it tastes best when I use crushed red pepper, combine oregano with the tomato paste, and exclude the potatoes and pepperoncinis.  I also dice the garlic.  When we're feeling lazy, we use stewed canned tomatoes to speed up the prep time, and I always have the tomatoes chopped up as much as possible since I'm texture picky.  All in all, great food, and a super easy dish for kids to help prepare.

I used pepper paste as another person suggested, plus added the turkish spice, pul biber (crushed red pepper) and some cumin.  My Turkish husband loved it!

I love this recipe!  I have been making this for years, but I never found the closest recipe from Adana until now.  I use chicken breast instead of the chicken thigh.  I cut the chicken into bite size pieces.  I use the turkish pepper paste instead of the tomato paste (I found a local mediterranean bistro that sells all sorts of turkish items). I cover and simmer everything on the stove for about an hour, then I put it in the oven with mozzarella on top and cook until cheese is melted.  I even use the traditional clay bowls!  My kids love it.

I loved this dish. Some people had problems cooking the vegetables through, so I made sure to cut things up in smaller pieces. I also added a can of Roto. It was delicious.

No, this was not worth the effort.  Was not impressed at all. Won't make again.

I found it difficult to cook the vegetables through without overcooking the chicken.

This could use some more spices.  $affron, turmeric, cumin, and coriander are options.

I added a little bit of spices to add a little more flavor, but it was still a bit bland for me.  Not terrible, but not a great dish in my opinion.  Sorry.

Like most folks I found this a bit bland, had to add lots of Tabasco and black pepper to make it palatable.  Sorry,  not a keeper for me it would take too much tweaking to get it to something we'd enjoy eating.

Nice recipe. Make sure you slice the potatoes thin. I used only 2 tbls tomato paste and 2 tabls red pepper paste. Layer tomato slices on top and use long green peppers, not pepperoncini for a more original version.

Quite good but recipe was altered to reduce cooking time.  I browned the chicken on the stovetop for a couple of minutes on each side.  I also sauteed onions on stovetop to bring out their sweetness.  It only took about 30 minutes in a 350 degrees for dish to cook.  Good quality tomato paste (i.e., organic) with 1 T. sugar (to cut the acidity) seemed to make what could have been a very bland dish (note the absence of spices) into a very good dish.  It's really good but left me wanting something spicy at the end of the meal.  I think it would be excellent to serve an Indian rice pudding afterwards.

First I will say that in my opinion this did not at all taste like Adana TU chicken tava. I was a little disappointed about that . However on a positive note it was still very good! The only thing I added was cumin and Mediterranean basil.
