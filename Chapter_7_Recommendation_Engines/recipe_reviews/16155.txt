This is beautiful! Absolutely georgous. For the jelly rolls I used little debbie's. They looked spectacular- but they didn't soften at all. The crowd I made it for loved it, but my husband and I knew it could have been better with a homemade jellyroll. But like I said- It is beautiful!!!

Made this as a treat for my family yesterday. Made a few changes - used canned strawberry pie filling in place of fresh strawberries because there weren't any when I went grocery shopping, used cheesecake pudding, and added creamed cream cheese to the pudding mixture, had fresh jellyrolls from grocery store bakery and cut them in 1/4" slices. Layered jellyrolls, pudding mix, whipped topping, strawberry filling, repeated along with standing slices of jellyroll around the outside on the pudding layer.  It was fantasic!

I also used the Little Debbie's rolls and it makes a very pretty dish.  This is ideal for a summer potluck dessert.  I sliced the jellyrolls in fairly thin slices (about 1/2 inch), which helps them soften considerably.

I have made this several times, each time with rave reviews. I sometimes use cheesecake flavored pudding instead of vanilla, chocolate works well too. Once, i used a tub of prepared cheesecake filling from the cooler section. It still tasted great, maybe a bit better even.

This was an extremely easy trifle to put together, and it was very tasty. Next time I make it, I will use two boxes of Little Debbie's jelly rolls, and I may layer it differently.

This is a very, very good dessert! It's easy to make. I did double the recipe & substituted 2 1/2 packages of Shortcake (each package had 4 shortcakes) for the jellyrolls. The dessert was a hit at the potluck!!

This was so yummy! I added a second layer made from banana pudding cake rolls. My layers from the bottom up: strawberry Debbies, fresh strawberries, 1/2 of pudding mixture, banana pudding Debbies, fresh bananas, remaining half of pudding mixture, remaining Cool Whip.

I used lil debbie jelly rolls. And I didn't have a 5oz pkg of vanilla, so i used two smaller ones...so I ended up having a lil more pudding. (2 cups milk) And had frozen strawberries on hand.

My daughter and I made this tonight for a dessert and it was delish! It was simple to prepare. I used Lactaid in place of the milk because dairy just doesn't cooperate with me anymore. It turned out great. I too used Little Debbie rolls which probably made it a little bit sweeter than I care for but it was still amazing!
