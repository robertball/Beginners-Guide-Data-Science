Instead of using potatoes, I saved some time and used sliced black olives. It turned out really neat. The only reason I rated this a 4 instead of a 5 is because of the unhealthy ingredients. It tastes really good, but definitely not something you'd want to eat too often. I made it as an appetizer actually, and everyone loved it. Very festive looking.
