I made a few changes based on what I had on hand.I omitted the celery and added a little celery salt instead, and used dried minced onion. I also added green beans and corn to make up for the veggies I didn't have, and I cooked it in the crockpot. Overall, this a good, easy to make recipe.

I thought this soup was magnificent and we are soup people. Perfect spices. Could pass as gourmet. Will serve it for company and pass it off with a fancy name.  Thanks. It's a lovely recipe.

I've made this soup a few times- and passed on the recipe to others. It does take a little longer than 10 minutes to get the veggies and beans to a softer-than-al dente state. Also, while I've used one can of butterbean, one can of garbanzo, the butter bean makes an important "meaty" contribution to the soup and also thickens the broth. I had never used butter bean (aka large lima bean or gigante beans) before this, now I always keep some cans around. Great recipe!

I share this recipe with everyone that would listen. It was delicious.  I love butter beans and this is the fist time I had it in a soup.  I had no desire to add rice or pasta which is my usual m.o. to soups.  I love this recipe.

This was a good way to use up a few cans of beans I had in the pantry. Next time I will add extra can of beans as I like hearty soups. also I did make one change and used italian seasoning in place of the basil and parsley to use what I had on hand

Really enjoyed this soup.  I added a little cayenne pepper to this for a hint of heat.  Loved all the veggies in it.  Made good lunches for the work week!  Will make again!

This soup was delicious.  We have a CSA (produce subscription) with our local farmers market and got butter beans for the first time.  We used all fresh vegetables and herbs and it was great.  We used two medium tomatoes in place of the stewed tomatoes and added a little extra salt and pepper to make up for it the seasoning that usually comes in canned vegetables.  other than that, we didn't have to change a thing.

I made this soup as is and found it delicious. Next time, I added slices of Keibasa (polish sausage) and let it simmer for an hour.  This was a very hearty soup.

Tastes quite bland- I followed the recipe exactly as written.  The beans taste good, but the flavors didn't seem to do anything special when put together.  It did taste 'healthy', so that is a plus.

I cooked dried beans and it came out very good.  My husband who is not a soup or butter bean person said it was excellant.

I made this recipe as written, with no changes at all.  It was quick and easy to make, smelled wonderful as it cooked, and ended up as a satisfyingly delicious soup!  With its reds, greens, oranges, and browns, the colors of this soup seem so fitting for a chilly, autumn day.  I will most certainly make this recipe again and again!

Good and could easily be done with any beans - I will likely try garbanzos next time.  I found it took a little longer than 10 mins to get the carrot throughly cooked.

I used fresh shelled butter beans from the farmer's Market to make this soup. It was excellent.

Great recipe - been using it for years from the Taste of Home recipe book... Its a great start, easy to change-up... If you use the tomoatoes with Italian spices added, you do not have to add seasoning - cuts down on one step!

This was easy peasy!!  I am amazed how easy it was, but it was good nonetheless. I used chopped green onion instead of a whiteonion and I threw in some leftover shredded turkey breast.  ---A pretty mindless recipe for those days when thinking is already too much of a chore!

This was a really quick and easy recipe. I also served it with corn bread, very tasty.
