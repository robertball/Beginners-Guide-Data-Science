I made it and baked for 20 mins but it became sticky even after letting it cool. What did I do wrong?

Excellent, just the way my Avo would make them. We call the Espiros though, but the same recipe. I make these on all special occasions, my son just loves them!

Loved it, but had to bake them for 30 minutes before the inside was cooked. Added 1/8 t of lemon zest, decadent

How can these little puffs of air be so addictive?  When I saw that this recipe called for so little lemon, I couldn't imagine why it was even in there. And when I tasted the batter before baking, I didn't taste the lemon at all. But after they were baked, that lemon flavor came through ever so slightly. I sprinkled them with multi-colored nonpareils which made them very festive looking. Such easy little delicacies to make and with ingredients I always have.
