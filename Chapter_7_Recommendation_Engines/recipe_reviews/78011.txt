I'm sorry, but microwaving fish doesn't work for me....it's too easy to over or undercook.  The sauce is a definite winner, though.

We have made this recipe twice. It was delicious with cod and I added snow pea pods. The second time we made it with tilapia and added mushrooms - also good! I cooked it in the oven as we served 6. One note, when you triple the recipe (6 servings), there is NO need to triple the sauce - I can't imagine anything with 1/3 cup of fresh ginger - yikes! And nearly 4 cups of liquid - unnecessary. Use your judgement. But we enjoyed it both times.

My husband and I really enjoyed this meal. I used salmon filet as that is what I had on hand and baked in the oven.  I did turn the fish over and finished cooking under the broiler. I did add 1tbsp each of  fish sauce and reduced sodium soy sauce. Even though my hubby is not a fan of cilantro I was able to convince him it is good and it lends a bright green color to the dish. The kids weren't as impressed but the older one ate his plate clean. I liked the crunchiness of the cabbage too.
