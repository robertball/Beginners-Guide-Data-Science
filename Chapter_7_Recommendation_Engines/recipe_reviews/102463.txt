The rub is great - it adds lots of flavor. And the blue cheese butter is fab, too!

This recipe is simple and easy to do on a charcoal grill.  Just be careful to not leave the meat on the grill too long or your rare meat will go to medium.  My family loved it and again it was simple and quick!

This is a very excellent recipe. The "Blue Cheese Butter" really made it special.

This was absolutely amazing!  Added chopped chives to the sauce and poured over the meat after flipping the first side while it was still on the grill.
