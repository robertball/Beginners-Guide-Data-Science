Very good basic recipe, but I made some changes after reading other reviews.  Instead of preparing a casserole, I diced the chicken and then cooked it in a bit of oil.  I then added all sauce ingredients, added a can of cream of mushroom soup and simmer the chicken mixture for about 30 minutes.  I cooked the rice separately (1 cup) and served the sauce over the rice.  Delicious with these modifications!  I've always found that keep the rice separate from other ingredients makes for better leftovers.  Thanks!

My wife and I made a dinner together using this recipe.  We both enjoyed the dinner and we will make it again.  We made 3 modifications:  1.  Decreased soy sauce in half to 1 tablespoon, because my wife says soy sauce makes her retain water.  We thought this meal had enough flavor with only half the soy sauce.   2. Increased the rice to 3/4 cups, based on GTIDEY's tip.  It worked out just right for us like this.  3.  Decreased bake time to just 1 hour.  Since the chicken has already been browned in the skillet, I believe it would have been overcooked in the oven if baked for 1 1/2 hours.  The meal was well-cooked with just 1 hour bake time.

I baked this for the full hour and a half, and the chicken was super tender.  I used half a cup of rice, and was happy with the consistency of the sauce - it made an excellent 'gravy' for the chicken.  In addition, I threw in some extra spices - pepper, paprika, and about a cup of shredded cheddar cheese.  This was delicious, and would be very good with pork chops also.

Wow!!! I was really impressed with this recipe. I did use fresh mushrooms instead of canned. I also made it a skillet dish rather than a casserole, cooking the rice seperately. This will definitely be on my dinner table again soon.

The base of this was pretty good. I changed it around the ingredients I had! I used cream of mushroom instead of cream of celery. I didn't have any celery so I didn't put it in there, and I used cream of chicken and mushroom (again...it's what I had!) given all the mushroom soup I also didn't put in the can of mushrooms. I took other review's advice and upped the amount of rice to 1 cup. Glad I did, we didn't have much left over. The chicken also was a little dry and I reduced the cook time to 1 hour. We will definately make this again though.

I thought this was great! I cut the breasts into strips to cook faster. Also making it easier to eat and more of a casserole. I threw in a little poultry seasoning to the strips, onion powder and minced onion while browning the chicken.  This way, baking only took about 30-40 minutes and remained very tender and juicey. Thanks!

My family really liked this recipe. The chicken wasn't dry at all because I didn't cook it for 1 1/2 hrs. I just brought the internal temp up to 170.  I used mushroom soup, a 7 oz. can of mushrooms, (we like mushrooms) 1 cu of rice and 3 cu of water.  I thought with only using 1/2 cu of rice to 2 cu of water it would be a littly soupy...I will make this again.

a delicious and easy dish! I prepared as suggested, with just a few spice-modifications. We like our dishes a little tangier, so I added an extra table spoon of soy sauce, a hal-teaspoon of salt and a half-teaspoon of white pepper. IT WAS SPECTACULAR! The sauce tasted a LOT like stir-fry sauce. Thanks for this idea, I'll be using this recipe again and again.

This recipe was a huge hit with my boyfriend, who is already requesting I make it again! I made a couple changes including making it as a skillet instead of a casserole. I prepared 2 cups of brown instant rice before hand and set aside mixed with some butter to keep from sticking to pot while keeping it warm. I cut the chicken into strips and added some seasoned salt and then cooked in 2 TBS vegetable oil. I added 1 can of cream of chicken and 1 can cream of mushroom soup to the chicken, along with one can of water. After mixing with the chicken, I added the soy sauce and the worcestershire sauce, along with a few dashes of onion powder. I let this simmer for about 30 minutes. I then sauteed 5 chopped mushrooms and added to the simmering chicken/sauce mix. After everything was mixed, viola-a very tasty dish that provided a number of plentiful leftovers. Will be making this again!! Thanks!

As in previous reviews, I made the rice and sauce separately.  I also added a can of tomatoes.  This is a recipe I will use over and over!  Enough for us and a meal of leftovers.

This was good!  I dredged the chicken in flour before browing.  I thought there was more than enough sauce, so next time I'm going to add 1/4 rice.  Also, it was pretty salty (and I like salt!).

My husband and I loved this dish. My husband is anti-vegetable so even without the vegetables is was good. I added broccoli to mine. I love the creaminess that the soup adds and the white rice gives it a nice oriental flare.

Tender moist chicken and very flavorful rice. This is great. I have actually made this recipe for a few years now. I prepared this as the recipe is written and felt there was no need to change anything.

very tasty. I can't stand celery so I used celery salt (that I can handle). I used 1 can of cream of chicken & 1 can of cream of mushroom w/roasted garlic. As per another review, we like a little kick too, so I added a bit more soy & worcestershire & increased the rice to a cup. Chicken came out tender. Easy to prepare & will be added to the rotation. Thanks for the recipe!

This meal was absolutely delicious.  I modified the recipe based on other reviews such as cooking the rice separately and decreasing the cook time in the oven by thirty minutes.  Easy to prepare and great to eat.

This was awesome! I used sushi rice, and it made it like creamy risotto. Thanks for sharing. I'm going to use it as a side dish sometimes without the chicken to go with grilled steaks.

This recipe was pretty good.  I used chicken thighs because that is what I had and what we prefer.  I also added a whole cup of rice. I am glad it did because it needed it to absorb up all those yummy juices.

Quite a nice dish, but as written, sounds very time consuming. Instead, I cut the chicken up into small strips as if for a stir fry, and then fried them in the olive oil with the onion until they were cooked. Then I added the celery, fried that, and then the other ingredients. I covered and simmered for about 20 min, while I made the rice. That was a lot faster. My husband said it tasted a little like stroganoff. It will go onto our monthly rotation.

I've also done it exactly according to the recipe and that was tasty too but very heavy. We decided next time we will try it replacing the cream of chicken soup  with just a cup of chicken stock in order to make it a little lighter.

This was a good, tasty recipe that was easy to prepare. I used the leftover Thanksgiving turkey instead of chicken and it was great. Prepare as written, don't increase the rice or it will be too dry. 1/2 cup seems like not very much rice, but this makes a good size casserole that fed my family of 4 with generous portions.

My boyfriend loved this! I made some modifications though. I increased the rice to one cup. Perfect! I omitted the mushrooms because we didn't have any. I diced celery and carrots and added them for "color" and diced the browned chicken and added it to the mixture. Delicious!!! Will make again!

Very good taste for minimal effort.  I cut up & precooked the chicken with the onions (& some garlic).  Added extra rice & water to compensate.  Since the chicken was already cooked, I was able to cut the cooking time nearly in half.  I'll probably add diced water chestnuts instead of the celery next time for a bit of crunch.  Thanks!

This was good. My husband thoroughly enjoyed it. I made some modifications to the recipe as well based on other suggestions. I didn't have cream of celery so just used cream of chicken + cream of mushroom soup. I upped the onion to about 3/4 of a cup. I didn't have chicken breasts so just chopped up a whole chicken which is probably cheaper.  followed the recipe but instead of baked casserole I poured over brown rice. left out the mushrooms and used olive oil instead. pretty tasty, although i'm worried that the salt/sodium content is pretty high in this dish.

i made this recipe as is, only adding 1 cup rice per the other reviews.  truthfully, i wasn't thrilled.  the rice soaked up ALL the gravy so it became gloppy rice, not saucy.  and there really wasn't much seasoning to it.  i don't think i'll make it again.

I liked the flavor of the rice and sauce except the chicken was very dry.  I probably won't make it again.

The sauce was OK, I used cream of asparagus as well as cream of chicken (because I didn't have the cream of salary).  I let the sauce cook in the oven for about 1/2 an hour, because 1 and half hours to let the chicken cook is way too long.

Now *this* was really good!!  Except for leaving out the mushrooms, which I hate, I didn't change anything -- it was in fact the tanginess I loved.  I agree with Ethurston about cooking it less time.  Being sure to let the sauce thicken is a key point, and I added the rice to start cooking a bit before the sauce was done, which perhaps allowed the chicken to get done without drying out.  Filling too.  I too will probably go ahead and add more rice next time.  Thanks, Carolyn.  Definitely making again.

Very flavorful dish!  I made this dish twice in one week and used one can each of cream of mushroom and cream of chicken soup instead of the celery soup suggested in the recipe.  I look forward to making this recipe again.

after i read other ratings i took some of their advice and changed some things! this was a mistake! have done this before with other recipes with GOOD results! it was lacking something, kinda bland. suppers that don't turn out the best the family calls "mels surprise" and will not let me make again! so if you try it, maybe follow the recipe closer!!!!!

Ok, this was a good base (as others have said) I changed a bit: Poached my chicken breasts to cut out a lot of baking time. Reserved 2 cups of the water for the rice mix. NO CELERY (yuck) Used cream of mushroom instead of the celery soup. and added water chestnuts in replace of the canned mushrooms. Baked only 35 minutes or until the rice was finished (make sure to keep a tight cover).

I did not like this receipe.  The color of it was a turn-off being so brown and the chicken was tough.  The only good thing was that the rice cooked well but overall I will not being making this receipe again. :(

It was a great recipe and I loved it but I added fresh mushrooms, mushroom soup and an extra tablespoon of soy sauce.  I also increased the rice to a little over one cup because of the extra liquid from the extra can of soup. It turned out sooooo good!

I used what I had on hand. Subbed canned chicken meat and cooked it all on stovetop in a sauce pan. I added the rice to the pot. I did add turmeric and ginger and salt and black pepper.

This was a good recipe. However, I added 1 cup rice, added some garlic powder, celery salt ( instead of celery), cream of mushroom soup,  oregano, and pepper. I also found that you could cook it for 1 .15 instead of the 1.5. I would make again

1 more great recipe from this site. I did change a few things: I didnt add celery or onion, i didnt fry the chicken first, and i used thigh/leg combo. I added all the ingredients into the baking dish except cream of celery soup, i used cream of mushroom and didnt add the can of mushrooms.I did add 1 cup of rice because i love rice so much! It was so good. I seasoned with minced garlic, onion salt, season salt, paprika and pepper. I will be making this over and over again. Thanks for another great one!!

This was really good when I finally got done with it!  Cooking the chicken thoroughly was the longest part, but it was well worth it!

As the other reviewer suggested, I decreased soy sauce to only one tablespoon and increased the rice to 3/4 cup. Oh, I also added chopped garlic when sauteing vegetables. Just enough seasoning, but still soupy for our family.
