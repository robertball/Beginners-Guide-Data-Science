DELICIOUS!!! I'm glad I made this cake for my whiskey loving guy...I made a couple of changes: I didnt grind the almonds quite as finely as I was supposed to I left out the raisins I added a small scoop of semi sweet choc chips in addition to the german chocolate. I made whip cream from this site and added whiskey to it =) yum..it added a nice light touch to the dense chocolate cake AND I made chocolate ganache from this site (added whiskey to that too) instead of the topping the recipe suggested...Dont be afraid of the whiskey taste being too overpowering..chocolate and whskey are the BEST combination!!! We loved this cake..

Formidable! I think the origin of the chocolate squares is not as important as the percent of cacao in them. Could be German or other as long as it is high. I used chocolate with 64% cacao. There's a problem though with the recipe converter: - 4.5 tablespoons of cake flour equals 67 5 grams (and not 40 gr).; - 2/3 cups ground almonds equals 80 grams (and not 95 gr).

This cake is absolutely the best! It has a rich chocolate torte-like flavor. I've been told it tastes like it came from a professional bakery. The only thing I do different is that I don't add the raisins.

My boss had requested a birthday cake combining her favorite flavors - chocolate and Scotch! An internet forum query yielded this recipe. It was a total hit. She ate two pieces (usually only a half) and took a couple for other people. The raisins really absorbed the scotch and when you bit down on them - Wow! This recipe is surely a 'keeper'.

Wow rich soft yummy. Suggestion: DO use parchment or your cake will fall apart coming out of the pan! I also added hazelnuts as well as raisins still superb. I found it took a bit longer than 20 mins to cook enough but that may be my oven!

Fan-flipp'n-tastic! Even with all my efforts to ruin it. I made the cake on Monday night took it to work tuesday left it in the work fridge all day and forgot to pick it up before driving to my parents house for my Dad's bday dinner. Arrgh! I then proceeded to forget it @ work wednesday night so on thursday night I took it to Deb's house for dinner. I made ganache since I hadn't iced it w/the icing suggested in the recipe. Made the icing - it seemed wrong so I didn't use it. Anyhow I made the ganache (http://allrecipes.com/Recipe/Chocolate-Ganache/Detail.aspx?prop31=4) but omitted the dark rum thinking it would save this old dried out cake. Well this cake didn't need saving! It was fantastic! And the ganache was an excellent addition. Next time I will either mash up or puree the raisons or leave them out all together. We all agreed they were weird in the cake.

I drastically reduced the amount of raisins & used regular chocolate chips instead of the German Chocolate. I loved the drizzle over this superbly moist cake (it wowed everyone!)

The raisins and almonds were at bit weird in this cake. Made it again without them and every enjoyed it much more. My rating is for the recipe as published without the raisins and almonds I would give it 4 stars

I can't get enough of this cake!! I love whiskey and chocolate so I thought I'd give this a try. Easy to make too. I made it for a small gathering and not a crumb was left! Thanks so much for sharing!! This will now become one of my favorite recipes.

Though there is a little flour added this is basically a flourless cake. Be aware that flourless cakes with no leavening agents are a bit more tricky. The addition of ground almonds adds a wonderful level of flavor to this delicious cake. Though it failed as a cake for me and turned out horribly under-baked in the middle (even after baking it longer than stated). However as cupcakes it was divine hence the 3 star rating.

Please note - I tweaked this recipe and made cupcakes vs a full cake. I've had bad luck making cakes before so I decided to make mini-versions so that I wouldn't have to deal with the un-molding process. The cake reminded me in taste and texture to a brownie. I used fresh apples peeled sliced and soaked in scotch rather than raisins. This helped (IMO) to retain the alcohol flavor in a little bit better without it baking it out. Apples actually enhance the scotch flavor whereas grapes can contrast it too much. It may be a little weird to have apples in chocolate cake - though not terrible - but I may need to play around with a different fruit maybe. My husband decided he wanted a tall chocolate frosting on the cupcakes so I made regular chocolate frosting. This overpowered the taste too much though - next time I'll stick with the ganache instead.

I made the recipe exactly as the directions and it came out fine. I did make it in a cake pan but the middle "sank in". I really did not care for the raisins so I will leave them out the next time I make it. Other than that this cake was delicious.
