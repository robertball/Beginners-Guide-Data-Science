I used boneless chicken breasts that I sautéed ahead of time then made the sauce in the same pan. It’s great!

Delicious and easy! Especially loved the sun dried tomatoes. I made it gluten free by using gluten-free pasta and xanthan gum for thickening the sauce.  My teenage sons gobbled it up without complaints.
