I added blackberries to the recipe because I had them available, and took out the pecans, and used a double crust. This pie was delicious!!! It was definitely the best fruit pie I have ever tasted!! Great recipe. It was worth all the trouble.

Good recipe. The crumb topping was delicious, the filling was ok, but I definitely suggest that you prebake the pie crust for 10 minutes or so. I used canned peaches instead of fresh, and canned sour cherries instead of the raspberries. I also halved the sugar in the fruit mix, because I wanted a not too sweet, more fruity taste.

I baked this as one of 3 pies for my mom's b-day and this was one of the crowd favorites.  I didn't care for the raspberries (which I'd actually thought would be my favorite part!), but still enjoyed the pie.  Pies are hard for me to rate because I prefer cake, but since everyone else seemed to enjoy this, a 5 it is (I, personally, would have rated it a "4").  I followed the recipe as is, though I did have to use frozen (thawed) peaches due to seasonality.  I wasn't sure what variety of apples to use, so I used a mac, a granny smith, and a gala.  I also added a handful of oats to the topping and subbed almond for pecans per personal preference.  TY for a nice pie twist!

I don't usually enjoy fruit pies but this was great!  I followed the recipe almost exactly except for the fruit amounts- I used the amounts of each that I had lying around until it filled the pie crust.  My raspberries were frozen in a mix with blackberries and I didnt defrost them- just threw them in and it still worked great.  I loved the pecan crumble topping (I used pecans that were glazed and I think that added a nice flavor) and got great reviews from friends!

I used fuit that I bought frozen. i let them defrost and put it in a pie shell with all the other things. I cut down on the sugar. It was great and had the real flavor of fruit, not overly sweet.

I doubled the recipe for a work birthday and had WAY too much fruit left over even after mounding as high as possible in deep dish 9" pie crusts... Could the original recipe have been for 2 pies? Otherwise great recipe. I took advice from some other reviewers and prebaked the crust, cut down on the white sugar, and substituted whole oats for the nuts in the crumb topping. With prebaked crust (10min @400F) the cook time could shorten to 30min. With leftover fruit, I mixed in leftover crumb topping and baked in corning dish 20min - bet it'll be great with ice cream tomorrow!

Outstanding pie!  My family really loves this pie.  I do make it with two crusts and leave off the crumb topping though.  I'm sure it five stars with the crumb topping too though.

Very nice recipe and quite easy. I didn't have raspberries, so I had to substitute dried cranberries. It worked well, too.

The best part of this recipe is the pecan crumbly goodness that's on top. I only put the peaches and raspberries in because I had some in the freezer that particular day. I've made this twice, and everyone's who has tasted it has loved it.

I had apples, peaches and pears and couldn't decide what kind of pie to make until I found this recipe.  I didn't have raspberries but didn't really miss them.  Different from the usual 1 fruit pie.  Thanks!

We did not care for this pie. Way too watery from fresh fruit cooking. bottom crust soggy. Peaches picked up colors from raspberries and looked unappealing. The crust on top was good.

Very good recipe, but way too much fruit to fill just one pie. I actually reduced the fruit the second time I made it. I also added a top crust. Everyone has loved it that has tried it!

This pie tastes great, however, I needed to cook it for an extra 20 minutes for the fruit to cook through and it came out a bit too runny.  I substituted 1/2 a cup of oats for the flour which mae the top taste great.  I would make this again but change come of the measurements so that it is not as runny and bake it for longer.

My first pie!     Substituted an extra pear and blackberries for the peaches because of the season.   Really yummy and very easy. Could see using the crumbly-goodness topping on other pies and desserts.

This pie was awesome!!  Great flavor, easy to make!  I don't care for crumble topping, so I made a lattice crust to top the pie and mixed the pecans that are called for in the recipe in with the fruit filling.  Wonderful!  Will make over and over again!

This pie was not all that impressive.  The topping was kinds gross, and the filling wasn't wonderful for all the money that went into making it.  Won't be making it again.

I used all frozen fruit including peaches, raspberries and saskatoons berries.  Since there was so much extra juice, I added more flour to make sure it thickened and cut back on the sugar.  I baked at 375 degrees for a bit 50 minutes.  Turned out excellent.

Like someone else mentioned, I had to turn the oven down to 375 °  and cook this pie longer so the fruit would be cooked and thickened. I added some cubes of cream cheese,  added blueberries instead of raspberries, and skipped the apple and pear. It was delicious even though a bit runny.

One reviewer said it had soggy crust, so I added a little more flour. It was fine, not soggy. Didn't have any berries, was looking for something to do with apples and peaches, very nice combination, and I love pecans so did extra pecans in topping. I also added a tsp. of vanilla just because I love the flavor. It was very good. Bordered on five star, but I save 5 stars for "knocks my socks off" and it wasn't quite there. Might have been if I had followed it exactly.

Wow! Great pie! I made a bottom crust from Bisquick called "Short pie." I used apples, pears, frozen ( thawed) cranberries and canned peaches, we'll drained. I substituted sugar for Splenda. Used the Brown sugar crumble mixture on top. Baked in a fluted ceramic pie dish and it came out great!! When I made the bottom crust from Bisquick, that had to bake for 8 to 10 min before I filled it with the fruit mixture. No soggy,.nice and firm. Really easy recipe and low sugar if you use Splenda as a sugar substitute. Note: I did have to add a bit more flour to the crumble mixture to get it to pea sized but no big deal. I just added a bit more brown sugar. Thanks for sharing the recipe!!

This was delicious! I used 2 apples(all I had), 3 peaches, strawberries and raspberries.  I cut the sugar in half, but everything else was the same.  This made two 9" deep dish pies.  Yummy!

Such a good pie, easy enough for a person like me who can count on 10 fingers how many times I've made pie!

I used about half the sugar the recipe called for, and it resulted in a healthy-tasting, delicious pie. Also indulged in a gluten-free crust and I'm so glad I did. The pie and crust worked SO well together.

Really appreciated the crumble topping, made this pie extra-delicious!
