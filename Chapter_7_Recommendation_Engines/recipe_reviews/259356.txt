This was very good, but a few things that I want to point out. The onion and celery amounts seem like WAY too much, in my opinion. I used 1 medium onion (diced) and 2 stalks of celery (about 1 cup) and 1 leek. This was more than enough to generously cover my bread (I used homemade artisan bread that I had on hand).  Other than these adjustments, I followed the recipe. This was one of the juiciest chickens that I've ever made. Cooking time for me was 1-1/4 hour. My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed this, and agreed that it was a "do again" dinner.

I made this chicken dish today. The only thing I changed was I had two large onions instead of three. Plus I did not have a leak in the house so I chopped up some green peppers instead. Easy to prepare and the chicken came out juicy. I’ll Will remake this again. Was very good and tasty.

This was very good as written. I was concerned that the thyme and red pepper flakes would overwhelm the finished dish. That did not happen. There was a little heat but not much. When I made the recipe, I cut all of the ingredients in half, using half of a chicken. I think next time I would halve everything but the sautéed vegetable/spice mixture. We raised chickens for meat during this quarantine and had them butchered last week! Perfect way to enjoy our chicken. I’ll be making this again, but with crusty sourdough bread, to see how this dish works with that change!
