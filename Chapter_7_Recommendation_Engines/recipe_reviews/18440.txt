I made this for a party and it was a big hit. Everyone raved about it. I used 1lb. box of angel hair spaghetti 2 large cans of spaghetti sauce and cheddar and mozzarella mixed cheese on top. This made a 9x13 pan.

I modified this based on other reviews and while it's not technically the original recipe, I've got to give full props to the Wendy for submitting this and getting me started.  The last time (I've made it more than once), I used a little over a pound of mild italian sausage and onions (and ran it through the food processor to get the crumbles smaller) and two 26 oz. jars of sauce.  I'm also a not-interested-in-recovering cheese addict so I used mixed in two cups of shredded cheddar with the spaghetti mixture and another two cups on top.  I think I'll stick to this combination as it was quite tasty.  It made so much I gave the neighbor a cube for her toddler who wasn't feeling the love for spaghetti before tasting this.  As a stay at home mom, I love having this in the fridge for my toddler's (and my) lunch.  It holds shape very well so I can cut it into small cubes and serve it to him cold or warm.

This recipe was a great starter. I added mushrooms, onions, garlic salt,  garlic powder and onion powder to my ground beef when frying it. Then added mozzarella cheese along with the mild cheddar. Everyone loved it I now make this instead of the original spaghetti.

I can't agree with other reviewers regarding the proportions - I followed the recipe and it was neither too dry nor too wet. Perfect.  My husband is not a huge spaghetti fan, but loved it this way.  I put a cup of cheddar and then a cup of mozerella on top, followed by a generous shower of parmesan.  I used Ragu Robusto brand sauce and still spiced it up with extra garlic powder, italian seasoning, and chili powder.  I always do that to jarred sauce.  Very good - a definate keeper as a basic recipe.

This was excellent, of course with the changes that I made.  I browned lean beef in olive oil, and finely chopped onions, along with salt, pepper,garlic powder,oregano,and a pinch of crushed red peppers. I also used a 26 oz jar of spaghetti sauce and Half of another one, so that it had enough sauce. I topped it with pieces of butter, provolone slices, and shredded mild chedder, and baked at 375 for 20 mins until cheese was melted and slightly browned. and MMMMMM MMMMMM MMMM! Very good!!!!!!!

I have made this a few times awhile back, and for some reason forgot about this yummy recipe. Thanks to my recipe box on here I made it again, and wow it is so good. I of course make my normal sauce, and add mushrooms, onion, garlic, parsley, balsamic vinegar, and olive oil to my sauce. I also use the cheddar cheese, but I also add mixed Italian cheese to it. This dish is perfect for a cold winter night. I guess there is something about baking spaghetti for 30 minutes that makes it extra yummy.

Great recipe...the whole family loved it, even my 5 year old niece.  It needs more sauce than the recipe calls for.  I usually buy a large jar (24oz) and almost use it all.

Great starting place for an easy family meal that everyone enjoys.  Leftovers are even better!  I used less pasta (about 2/3 of a 16 oz package) and about 32 oz. of my favorite basil and oregano sauce.  I also sauteed onions and garlic with the ground beef and added Italian seasoning to the sauce.  Some reviewers think that cheddar and spaghetti makes a strange combination, but I love it!  My mom always uses cheddar cheese in her baked spaghetti.  I recommend a cheddar and mozzarella bend.  I layered spaghetti, cheese, and spaghetti.  I added the cheese on top during the last few minutes of baking.  I served it with grated parmesan and garlic cheese toast.  I'm sure I'll make this one again!

This was a really tasty and quick dish.  I love to have a "sit down" lunch with my kiddos and since the 3 of us all agree on spaghetti...we had this today.  I used mozzarella instead of cheddar and since I couldn't find my baking dish..(left it at the in-laws), I opted for the microwave, which worked great.  Plus, it cut down on the cooking time.  I had this done in about 15 minutes.  Oh yeah, instead of ground meat, I used meatballs.  I did alter it quite a bit, but the end result was good and my babies had dirty mouths & full tummies which is all that mattered!!  Thanks Wendy.

I read through so many reviews of this recipe that in an act of sheer madness, I tried to accommodate all the suggested modifications from other reviewers...or at least those that I could remember. I sauteed the ground beef [seasoned with onion powder, italian seasoning, basil, oregano chili powder, salt, pepper], sliced white mushrooms, garlic, and red chili flakes.  After pouring in my spaghetti sauce of choice from Trader Joe's, I added bay leaf and simmered the mixture in low heat for 10 minutes. I chopped up fresh mozzarella and brandished two bags of shredded sharp cheddar and mozzarella.  After tossing the pasta with the sauce, I alternated layers of cheese and spaghetti in the baking dish, then topped the crust with the same layers of cheese plus Parmesan. The result? Rich and creamy spaghetti with tender mushrooms, gooey melted cheese crowned with a layer of crispy cheesy crust.  Great texture, awesome flavor! Thanks fellow reviewers!

I make my own meat sauce. I cook the spaghetti noodles, drain WELL; put back in pan and heat the pan long enough to see a little steam escape.  This eliminates any excess water not drained off.  I use about 4 cups of homemade sauce and mix into the noodles.  Then pour into a 2-3 quart, lightly sprayed with cooking spray.  Top with 2 cups of cheddar cheese.  Cover and bake for 40 minutes.  The noodles soak up the sauces and it is delicious.  You will never want a sauce just poured over cooked noodles again.

As written, this would actually be quite bland. But with a few modifications, this is easily a five star recipe. Just add chopped onions, minced, fresh garlic, basil and oregano (to taste) to the ground meat while your browning it to infuse the flavors. Once browned and drained, add sauce (you'll need more than the recipe calls for unless you like your spaghetti rather dry, I used two jars because my family loves to sop up extra sauce with garlic bread!) Also, I would suggest using mozarella cheese in place of cheddar, much more traditional and I believe more delicious!
The original recipe is a good starting point, but you can (and should) be creative and make this your own signature dish by adding the things you know your family will enjoy like mushrooms, sausage, green peppers, etc.

First time making/eating baked spaghetti and I wasn't impressed.  I layered mozzarella cheese in the middle and on the top, but this dish just turned out dry and tasteless.  Won't make again.

This is a good recipe for left over spaghetti. Mix it all and bake - a new dish. Tweak it to make it your own. Top this dish with cheese before you freeze it, and go ahead and use whatever cheese (or cheeses) you like best. I typically use both cheddar and parmesan. The paremesan seems to give it a nice "crust." I gave it 5 stars because it's tasty and because it's so easy and requires limited ingredients as compared to other spaghetti bakes.

I make this using homemade meat or regular sauce, I toss an bit a mozzarella cheese into the spaghetti & sauce, then top with more mozzarella cheese. 
I used to have a restaurant and this was one of our best sellers.

pretty good but not something I'd make again.  Fast and easy for sure, just not the flavor I wanted.   To change the flavor- add more spices to the sauce and use sharp cheddar or parmesan cheese.

Foolishly tried this when family was in a hurry to get out of the house for an event.  I used my own sauce but that was the only change I made.  I had a quart jar (32 ounces) of the sauce and ended up using the entire thing before we were through eating. After baking, the cooked spaghetti became mushy from absorbing the liquid in the sauce and then became dry as the liquid was used up. I could have had a nice plate of pasta in half the time.

Oh YUM!  I tried this recipe for the first time tonight and loved it!  After reading the suggestions from others, this is how I modified it:  I went with .75 lb. of spaghetti noodles and 1.5 jars of Prego sauce. 1 small can of tomato paste, italian seasoning, onion powder, and garlic powder.  I also cut up fresh basil to add to the sauce.  Real Iowa butter was mixed with the noodles along with a tbsp or two of extra virgin olive oil.  I topped it with a small amount of mild cheddar cheese, provolone, mozzarella, and freshly-grated parmesan cheese.  A couple pats of butter on top and into the oven it went.  This made for amazing comfort food!    Update May 2009: Emeril's pasta sauce tasted great in this in place of Prego! Update 2014: Still making this and love it! I've also had success using Newman's Own five cheese sauce and tonight I'm adding shredded asiago cheese. :)

This was absolutely delicious!!! I had to use almost 2 boxes of spaghetti because I haved a large family. I used a roll of sausage and 1/2 pound hamburger. I cooked them together in the skillet along with some chopped onion. Once it was drained and I added the spaghetti sauce, I added some tomato sauce and extra seasonings. I always add extra seasonings to the jarred spaghetti sauce anyway.. ( paprika, basil, oregano, onion powder, garlic salt, seasoned salt, etc.) I also added extra cheese on top. I am surely going to make this one again, in fact I think it will be a regular!! Thank you sooooo much Wendy! The family loved it!

Cant get any easier...one word of warning, you will want to experiment with the ingrediant ratio. (More sauce, less noodles, etc...) Following these exact ingrediant portion sizes will yeild a very dry dish.
Once you get this to your taste..its great! :0)

Great basic recipe!  The recipe I go by has layers, like lasagna.  It's cooked spagetti, layer of mozzarella, layer of cream cheese, sour cream mixture, layer of sauce and then top with cheddar.  Once layered, take a fork and poke it in the layers and jiggle it to allow the sauce to permiate the spagetti a little.  YUMM-O!

Loved this. I used two cans of Marinara sauce and some 5% ground beef and left it in the slow cooker all day while I was at work for an amazing sauce, then I added some mozzarella cheese to the spaghetti bake. This is a good basic recipe to build on. It's 5+ stars with modifications, and it's 5 stars as a basic recipe as well.

We liked it.  Son said it had more flavor than regular spaghetti.  The cheese was a nice addition...I used both mozzarella and cheddar.  Will definitely make again.

This was a pretty good recipe as far as my family was concerned! I did take some of the suggestions I read and incorporated it into the recipe. I did cook onion and bell pepper with the ground beef. Also, I added an about a 1/3 of a jar of spaghetti sauce in addition to the 16 oz. jar it called for.

Okay, so I am a college student and it was so easy to make and yummmy! Plus while it was baking I actually did some homework, so I think the recipe might be magical. Updates on that if i find more findings.

Changes: turkey instead of beef, I added all my spare veggies (yellow bell pepper, mushroom, tomato, onion, broccoli) and I used some leftover Bri on top which sounds gross but totally worked. 

And the crispy noodles on the side are yummy, MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH.

I approve!

This was pretty good, I used fresh mushrooms that I cooked in white wine before adding to the sauce. I also cooked onions, red bell pepper, fresh garlic, basil, italian seasoning, salt and pepper along with my ground beef.
I used mild cheddar and mozzarella cheese. I layered it all and then baked.
came out really good.

Quick and Easy!  I used your recipe as a base and made the following changes: ground pork instead of beef, added onions and garlic sauteed in olive oil, and black olives and also definitly more sauce (I added 2 jars).  For cheese, I used fresh romano, mozzarello, and parmesan.  So good!  Be sure to cover the dish and take the foil off during the last 10-15 minutes to brown. My hubby told me it was the best spaghetti he has ever had!  Thanks so much Wendy!

It was good, but not wonderful.  I used a 27 ounce jar of sauce and it was still somewhat dry.  I would make it again for an easy dish, but I would half everything, it was way too much food for my hubby and I.

I substituted Johnsonville Spicy Italian Sausage Links, removed casings and browned instead of ground beef. This added a lot more flavor and no extra work involved! This is a great quick meal and something I know everyone in the family will enjoy. I baked mine in muffin tins to control serving sizes.

5 stars for simplicity and taste! Added chopped onion to the meat while cooking, drained, then added garlic powder, basil, oregano, salt & pepper and cooked for 1 minute. Added 2- 26 oz jars of sauce and noodles.  Mixed in a cup of ched/jack cheese.  Put in baking dish and toped with more cheese. Delicious!  Thanks for the recipe and all the reviews!

I had to feed 10 people. I was out of lasagna noodles so I tried this recipe and added my own ideas.
I used 2lbs of spaghetti noodles and made my sauce to taste for our family , i put  a small amount of salsa and a can rotel green pepper and tomato mild sauce in with it which gave the noodles a nice light spicy taste . I also used cottage cheese and mixed with noodles and added  parmesan, mozzarella and cheddar cheese to top.
Now if i can only make it taste this good again. Everyone loved it! The noodles soak up the sauce. 
So I wouldn't go to light on sauce. Served with Salad and garlic bread.

This was amazing! Next time I'll use more sauce and maybe add some more of a different type of cheese. I used extra virgin olive oil, chili power, garlic powder, and Italian seasonings when I browned the meat.
Really good! Everyone enjoyed it (even a picky 2-year-old)!

So good and easy that next time I will make two pans so I can put one in the freezer. I think a veggie version would be good too! After reading reviews I did make a few tweaks - 1) used 1 1/2 lb Italian sausage instead of ground beef 2) used almost two 28 oz jars of spaghetti sauze 3) added a can of drained diced tomatoes 4) used 2 C parmesan and 2 C mozarella instead of the cheddar. To cook it all, I added half of the cheese in with the meat/sauce mixture, then combined it all with the cooked pasta, topped with the rest of the cheese, baked for 30 minutes, then broiled for 5 minutes or so to get the cheese browned on top. With these tweaks it was flavorful and had plenty of sauce - gets 5 stars from me!

This recipe is a keeper.  I did make some changes as recommended by other reviewers.  I used 1 lb of mild italian sausage and browned it with onion and garlic.  I used 1 lb of spaghetti and 2 big jars of spaghetti sauce.  I also threw in a can of sliced mushrooms.  I layered the dish (noodle, sauce, cheese) x2.  I also put some cheese in meat sauce mixture.  It set up really well and tasted great.  I served it with garlic bread.  Thanks for the post.

This is a good "basic" recipe (the best one on this site IMHO). I made this for dinner w/ friends. Unfortunately, their son came down with the flu, so we didn't get together. Being that I didn't want to waste what I prepared, I baked this for my bf & I. We were eating this for a wk.!!!! I pretty much followed Wendy's directions, but did make some personal changes to suit our tastes. I could only find a 1.25 lb. pkg. of chuck, so I used that in lieu of the lean beef called for (I drained my meat VERY well b-4 continuing w/ the recipe). I also used 2 (26 oz.) jars of Ragu sauce (I was going to use 1.5 jars worth, but didn't see the point in wasting 1/2 a jar - what was I going to do w/ a little bit of leftover sauce???). Oh, and I also added a sm. (chopped) onion, 2 cloves of minced garlic, s&p to taste, ~ 2.5 tsp. Italian seasoning & a pinch of red pepper flakes to the beef while it was browning. I layered 1/2 of the beef/spaghetti mix. (mixed together as directed), shredded mild cheddar (~ 1 c. worth), the remaining spaghetti mix., a few pats of butter, 8 provolone slices to cover everything, more cheddar (~ 1/2 c.) & some dried parsley flakes for garnish. One thing to note: if you are preparing this ahead of time (works great!), take it out of the fridge at LEAST a 1/2 hr. b4 placing in the oven & bake for AT LEAST 40 min., maybe longer (my casserole was lukewarm, even after 30 min.). Thx. for sharing this great kiddo-pleasing recipe!

Oh my goodness, who knew one simple change would make spaghetti my new favorite meal. I love the added cheese on top! I used cheddar and mozzarella and added a little bit into the sauce as well. I ofcourse seasoned the meat with salt and garlic powder, and the sauce with extra italian seasoning. I used 12 oz of angel hair and a 26 oz jar of pasta sauce and mine is not dry at all. I also decreased the baking time to about 15 min. . Turned out perfectly and will be added to my dinner rotation.

I guess I was looking for something else.  My pasta totally dried out in the oven and just had no more appeal than a leftover bowl of spaghetti with cheese microwaved on top.

OMG! Loved this.  We were totally bored with spagetti every week so i needed to find a quick yummy recipe that even my husband would eat.  I took the advice of others by adding canned mushrooms, onion, garlic and green pepper to the meat mixture and using a 26 oz jar of spagetti sauce.  We didn't have any chedder or moz chez on hand so I used a colby/montery chez mix and it turned out wonderful served with steamed broc. and a salad my kids and hubby loved it. Thank you for a great recipe and all the reviews this is a keeper for my box.

The sauce you use will make or break this dish.  I used delicious home made sauce, and it came out great.  I was a little leery of the cheddar cheese (I actually planned on using mozzarella, but didn't have any), but it was good!  I added chopped onion, mined garlic, salt, and pepper to the beef while it was browning.  I also sprinkled a little Romano cheese on top before baking.

Really enjoyed this dish but next time I will cut down on the spaghetti.  1 LB was just a little too much. I did add salt, pepper, garlic powder, and ranch dressing powder.  Next time I will also add diced tomatoes and bell pepper.

Simple and tasty, i was craving noodles and sauce and this fit the bill.  Will add more cheese, and sauce next time it can be a bit dry.

Not as good as I expected.  My husband liked it but my kids didn't.  I followed the receipe exactly.  Maybe with some extra spices or something it will be better.

I used Hunt's green pepper and mushroom spaghetti sauce, one can of mushroom stems and pieces, 1 package of blended cheeses and 1 package of mozzarella.   I added the mushrooms and blend cheese to the spaghetti.  Topped off with the mozzarella.

this is a great recipe and a nice change from the basic spaghetti.  I have made this a few times now and I recommend doubling the sauce.  as far as I am concerned, too much sauce is better than not enough.  I also suggest cooking the ground beef with some onion and garlic to give this dish some more flavor.

Great base for a recipe!  Our favorite combo so far has been: 1 lb ground beer, 8 oz sliced mushrooms, 4 lbs spaghetti sauce (we like Prego traditional), 1 lb angel hair pasta, 2 cups cheddar cheese, and 2 cups mozarella cheese (plus a bit of garlic and salt). Brown beef mushrooms.  Season with garlic and salt.  Drain.  Add sauce and simmer.  Break angel hair pasta into thirds or quarters.  Boil for just over 3 minutes.  Drain and add to sauce.  Mix well.  Do layers of noodles and sauce then layers of cheese.  Normally we can get three layers of each.  It will barely fit in a 9x13 pan.

My family and I loved this!  I did modify it though.  A previous reviewer was right.  It does need more sauce, so I doubled the amount it called for.  I also added mushrooms, chopped green peppers and garlic powder.  Mine was perfectly baked after about 15 minutes so that was a plus.  Excellent recipe!

I understand that this is a BASIC recipe and is meant to give you a quick meal, but with a few minor changes, this can be an AWESOME recipe that can still give you a quick meal. This is how I alter the Ingredients’ list: 1) 2 TBS olive oil 2) 1 onion, diced 3) 4 cloves garlic, chopped, 4)1lb of meat (I use turkey for health reasons) 5) 1 teaspoon garlic powder 6) 1 teaspoon oregano 7) 1 teaspoon onion powder 8) 26oz of pasta sauce 9) 3 cups of cheese (I use extra sharp cheddar, mozz, sometimes colby/monteray jack. Do NOT use other kinds). This is how I alter the Directions: a)I sauté onion/garlic with olive oil b) add seasoning to meat while it is cooking c) let pasta cool for 5-10min before I mix in 1.5 C cheese (the remaining cheese goes on top)  I made this numerous times and my husband absolutely LOVES it even though he's healthy-conscious. I was disappointed because I made it tonight and added more than my usual 26oz of sauce because I read the suggestion in reviews. I advise you NOT to do that. It did not maintain the usual mold and it altered the taste.

This was a very good basic recipe.  I did make a lot of changes though.  I used a 26 oz jar of plain spaghetti sauce that I added oregano, basil, seasoning salt, pepper and sugar to.  I also added onions and garlic to the meat while it cooked.  My husband and the kids loved it!

Very Yummy! I just sprinkle it with mozzarella and parmesan before sticking it in the oven. I also added onion and garlic powder to the meat. I added italian seasoning to the pasta, just a little bit of Mrs. Dash. Next time i would add 2 jars of sauce and a pound and a half of meat, just for personal preference!

This is a relatively healthy, quick meal.  I have 2 kids, ages 2 and 4.  They love it.  I run fresh veggies through the food processor and add them to the sauce and they never know!

Awesome recipe! I made this one weekend night in for my very picky boyfriend and myself and we both loved it! In my past experiences with baked spaghetti, it has been dry and hard, but this one was great. Since it's only my boyfriend and myself, I used one and a half 10 oz jars of spaghetti sauce, 3/4 lb of noodles and added some onion in the meat for extra flavor. I also added motz cheese along with parmesan cheese and cheddar on top...turned out great and the very picky boyfriend said that I won't have to worry about leftovers!

So this is just what it says, basic, you need to add seasoning, onions etc. I do like the idea of the recipe and the basic recipe is not bad. I put a 26 oz can of sauce instead of the 16 oz and I still think it could use more sauce. I put the spaghetti in a 9x13 pan and poured the sauce mixture over the top and sprinkled the top with the cheese. Also added 3/4 cup shredded parmesan on top. I'll make this again and just perk it up a bit with onion, garlic, seasonings.

Mmmm good! I followed the recipe almost exactly. The only changes I made were: I only used 1/2 pound of ground beef and I didn't have enough spaghetti noodles so I used a handful of pasta shells. Perhaps the only change I would suggest making is adding a tad more sauce, but that's only because I like a lot of sauce. I served with hot crusty garlic bread. Wonderful and quite tasty! Thank you for sharing!

Super easy and super good!  I used a lot of different reviewers' suggestions when I made this dish...I cut back a little on the spaghetti, added extra cheese, and threw in some sauteed mushrooms and onions, fresh garlic, chopped bell pepper and dried parsley.

Good starter recipe. I used 3/4 lb ground venison, 1/3 lb italian sausage, chopped onion, 2 large jars mushroom/parmesean spaghetti sauce, 1 lb thin spag. noodles, cup of sliced baby carrots, 1 cup italian cheese blend, 1/2 cup parmesean cheese -- it was good. Needed more things in it, maybe mushrooms, zucchini, and chopped tomatoes. It was plain and kinda dry (I like drier spaghetti though). Husband liked it better than regular spaghetti. Will make again with adjustments.

This tasted great and was so easy to make.  I followed some other reviews and sauteed fresh garlic and onion with the meat.  I also mixed mozzarella cheese in with the chedder and layered it as if making lasanga.  My son loved it, I'll definetly make this again!

Our family is kind of picky when it comes to baked spaghetti, but this one is the best!  I make the 9 x 13 pan of this recipe when our eldest son and his finance are coming over (which makes five of us) and it is just about all gone at the end of the meal.  Very yummy!  I actually like to use sharp cheddar instead of mild, and I prefer the med size can's of Hunt's Spaghetti Sause instead of jarred.

this recipe was delicious!! If you can cook pasta, you can make this meal. I substituted the ground beef for pre-cooked chicken meatballs (courtesy of Costo), and i only had mozzarella cheese on hand, so i used that instead of cheddar cheese. I also used the larger jar of spaghetti sauce (24 oz) since my family likes their spaghetti saucy. Quick and easy dinner to make on a school night. My 13 months old ate the spaghetti till his tummy poofed out. :o)

Missing: a 1/2 cup of chili. I tried this recipe yesterday for our neighbors. They loved it. 
I made it a bit more spicy for them and I used Buffalo meat instead. The children enjoyed it as well. My daughter said that it was too spicy and that it could probably burn off a birthmark. haha. I try to be hip and innovative with these recipes. We learned to eat spicier and more daring ingredients from our time spent in Phoenix, AZ. Sometimes my crazy recipes require medical attention afterwards. :-))

My man LOVES baked spaghetti. His favorite is from a small local restaurant so I was trying to mimic their version. This recipe is very comparable to theirs. Very flavorful and cheesy. He loved it :)

I didn't find this to be any better or worse than plain old spaghetti. I won't make it again. To me it just equaled having to wash a casserole dish. Not my favorite thing to do.

My mom used to make this but she used American cheese...I know, sounds unappealing but we loved it. I make it for my family now and it is a dinner favorite. Try it, you might be pleasantly surprised.

This is a great "basic" recipe!  But if you have more time, make some changes and experiment!  I do half spaghetti sauce and half alfredo sauce out of a jar.  I also like to add shredded Italian cheeses!  You can do so many things with this!  Have fun!

Great recipe that allows for customizing.  I added chopped onion, celery, and minced garlic to browning hamburger meat, adds great flavor.

I made this for the first time tonight and it was excellent!  I used Prego herb sauce and paired the dish with garlic cheese toast and caesar salad.  We eat a lot of spaghetti to begin with and this was a great new twist on it which made for an outstanding anniversary meal for my boyfriend and I.

I'm disappointed my spaghetti-lovin hubby turned his nose up at this.  I used a typical jar of Classico (bigger than 16 ounces) and found this dish to be very bland. Parmesan helped some.  Maybe I needed more sauce?  Oddly, I'm not sure why ladling our typical Classico sauce on noodles is better than mixing and baking, but it is.

This was a nice, simple recipe. I thought it was good, my husband thought it was alright but I only gave it 4 stars because, surprisingly my kids didn't really like it. I thought it'd be an easy surefire hit with them with the cheddar cheese on top but they didn't like it. Perhaps their tastes are more refined than mine. All in all, easy and tasty.

Exactly what I was looking for - a quick, simple recipe. I had all the ingredients on hand either in the pantry or freezer and was able to put this together very quickly. I used ground turkey breast instead of beef and added mozzarella and Parmesan cheeses on top. Delicious!

Very good. I added in an extra layer of italian cheese and also put diced onions, garlic and green pepper in with the ground beef. Next time I will try it with italian sausage.

Very easily made with ingredients on hand.  I added onion to the meat as it was cooking and wish I'd added about a tsp. of salt to the mixture.

This was pretty danged good!  I took some of the suggestions of other reviewers and made a few changes to the sauce.  I added some balsamic vinegar, some masala wine and a few spices of my own.  I also put some small cubes of butter to the top before I topped it with cheese.  It was very tasty and made a lot more than I expected.  :o)

This recipe was pretty good, although we found it to be a little dry. I wish I had added more sauce to it before I baked it. Oh well, I will know for next time! Overall, we liked it, and I'm sure we will have it again since it was quick and easy. My son did devour it, which is always good!

Nice & tasty.  Quick, too, but lacks seasoning.  Add your own favorites (I used onion, Italian seasoning, garlic, & red pepper flakes).  Nothing special, but a good solid starter recipe.

I expected this to be different. I don't know how, either to have a different texture from normal spaghetti or slightly different taste. It didn't. What is the point of going through the extra 30 minute step and dirtying another dish for it to taste exactly like normal spaghetti with some cheese sprinkled on top? Also, I used a 24oz jar of spaghetti sauce and it was still not enough sauce, so there's no way 16 oz would be.

Great starter recipe!  Delicious!  I used the following ingredients: 1 lb ground beef, 2 (16 oz) jars spaghetti sauce (Ragu Vegetable Primavera), 1 lb mini penne noodles (to make it easy for the little kids to eat), 3 1/2 cups cheese (mild and sharp cheddar, parmesean, mozzarella - 2 cups mixed with meat and sauce, 1 1/2 cups on top).   Thank you!  I'm definitely saving this one to make again!

I have searched for a recipe similar to what they served in my elementary school and the trick the whole time was to bake it I loved it because the sauce adheres to the noodles. We went light on the cheese because it was perfect the way it was. We used Bertolli Five Cheese Sauce and Prego Traditional Meat Sauce, two pounds ground round, and 24 oz spaghetti. Amazing!

Tried this recipe last night and it came out great.  Didn't have any lean ground beef, so I used ground turkey. It was delicious. Family loved it and will try it again with the LGB.

Even the kids ate it! After cooking the beef, I drained it & rinsed it to get some of the fat off. Then I added onions, garlic & black beans to the ground beef. I let that cook for a few minutes then added the sauce, let that come to a simmer then combined it all. I added some mozzarella to the mix then the rest on top. Great! Just don't know what to serve on the side (no one was in the mood for salad, had it for lunch!).

Don't know why my family went so crazy over this - it was so easy, and pretty much straight from the pantry. Ended up putting in two small square pans which left me an extra for later in the week. Huge hit. Will be making spaghetti like this from now on. I personally like the traditional spaghetti- but when you can actually get your kids to eat something whole heartedly - go for it!

I love making this.  I do add more cheese.  My family likes cheese with their spaghetti!  When I make this, I usually make enough that there are 1 or 2 pans to put in the freezer for days when I don't feel like cooking or am too busy.  It freezes well.  I just put it in aluminum pans and wrap well with foil.  It will have to cook quite a bit longer since it is frozen but worth the wait.  I put the frozen 9X13 pan in the oven covered with foil for about 90 minutes on 350 and then uncover and bake an additional 30 to 40 minutes.  YUM

Awesome!  I too added my touch, with a can of petite diced tomatoes and juice, some additional italian seasoning, and parm cheese, also, I used a cheddar jack blend instead of plain cheddar.  My family now protests when I try to make "just plain spaghetti".

You can't beat this for a twist on regular ol' spaghetti and sauce.  Couldn't be easier and was a hit in my home - everyone ate it the second day as well.

I took the advice of some of the other reviewers: a little over 1 lb of ground beef browned with chopped onion and a teaspoon of chopped garlic, black pepper, used only 2/3 lb of thin spaghetti noodles, and used a 24 oz jar of sauce.  I spooned 1/2 of the spaghetti mixture into a 9" x 13" baking dish, topped with 1 cup of shredded four-cheese mix, added the remaining spaghetti mixture and topped with another cup of cheese mix.  I baked, covered with foil, for 25 minutes. Then removed the foil to lightly brown the cheese on top. Covering with foil kept the noodles on the top outside of the dish from drying out. Served with garlic Texas toast; it was a very tasty and easy meal. I will add a little more sauce next time and increase the cheese to at least 3 cups.

Husband really liked this one (even requested leftovers!). I used 1 lb. ground pork(sage). Browned with minced garlic, onions and sliced mushrooms from a can. I also used extra spag. sauce. Topped with a mixture of mild cheddar and parm. Thank you for this easy recipe :)

This recipe is as it states "basic" baked spaghetti.  It's quick, easy, very mildly flavored as written and a kid pleaser with the cheese.  I prepared the recipe as stated only I layered half the spaghetti mixture then half the cheese and repeated the layers.  My picky 7 year old loved it.  I'll make again, only next time all add some onions, garlic, and red pepper to the mix to spice things up a bit.  Overall a quick, go to recipe for a family pleasing mid-week dinner.

This is a great recipe for me since the ingredients are minimal and my husband loves it. Next time I make it I think I'm going to take the spaghetti off early because its a little bit mushy for my taste. I also think the recipe could be jazzed up a bit with spices, but I'll have to experiment.

I used a 26-oz jar of sauce, along with a 16oz can I had in the pantry. Per another reviewer, I browned some mild Italian sausage and used it, adding  plenty of garlic powder plus two cloves, sliced. I did stir the cooked noodles into the sauce/meat/cheese mixture. I added 4oz can of drained, sliced black olives on top, then covered with foil when cooking so it wouldn't brown and get hard, like others had noted. The foil worked like a charm, and this made a HUGE 9x13 pan full. Great potluck dish, and fed our family of 4 for 3 meals. Will add to my keeper-file; thanks for the post!

this recipe definitely needs more sauce.  and i think the next time i make it i'll layer the mixture and put cottage cheese in the middle to make it more creamy.

Way too much spaghetti, or perhaps not nearly enough sauce?  Nearly everyone enjoyed the dish at our potluck, but I used a full 26 oz of sauce, and still thought it a bit dry.  I also used an entire 2-cup bag of finely shredded cheddar - one cup didn't even cover the top.  Definitely going to break up the noodles next time, too - too long to work with if you don't!

For basic baked spaghetti it is what it says it is basic.  This time I jazzed it up a little I added sliced olives, mushroom pieces and stems, italian seasoning and garlic powder. Just those few ingredients helped out this recipe tremendously. YUM!

This was a good basic recipe, I added onions, mushrooms,garlic powder, crushed red pepper and salt to the burger as it was browning.  I mixed mozzerella cheese & Mexican 4-cheese blend & shredded parmesan to the top.  Next time I may add a little extra sauce to make it less dry.  But we enjoyed it very much.

Actually very good and very easy.  A bit different from fixing regular spaghetti.  I used mozzerella instead of cheddar.  Would definitely make again.  Thanks

I have made this twice and it's a neutral for me.  I cringe when I see the fat from the cheese bubbling, but knowing that my BF loves cheese, I go ahead and do it.  It does refrigerate well, and is very easy to serve leftovers in cubes or squares the next day.  Overall, it's a nice change once in awhile from the basic spaghetti recipe.

Very good basic recipe.  I sauteed some veggies (red/green peppers, mushrooms, garlic, etc) in some spices and added that to the mix.  Followed other reviewers' advice and added more sauce/less spaghetti.

Tastes very good; definitely a welcome change from plain old spaghetti.  The spaghetti takes up more of the various flavours.  Will definitely make again.

I made this for my family of 6, on Friday night and they ate up!  I knew that I was going to make spaghetti, but I wanted something different and I checked out www.allrecipes.com, and I found your recipe.  Thank you for it and I wouldn't change a thing.  I served it with a side salad and garlic bread and my family thought I had spent so much time cooking.  And, of course, the best part of it is you don't have to spend a lot of time on it.  Thanks...

This was pretty good, I accidently overcooked it a bit.  my husband didn't like it but thats because he doesn't like cheese. I had used parmesan cheese for this recipe instead of cheedar it tasted good. I probably wont make this again since my husband don't like it but I would suggest it to other people.

I reduced this recipe to four servings and layered it.  I added onion and minced garlic to the meat mixture and seasoned it with garlic salt, garlic powder, a dash of paprika and seasoning salt.  I used mushroom pasta sauce and sprinkled on some chopped olives I had leftover from another recipe.  I also used a combination of cheddar and mozzarella cheese.  It was okay, but I think I'll try a different recipe in the future.

Yum!!!  DH turned up his nose when I told him what was for dinner.  He devoured the plate I served him and went back for 2nds!  I didn't use the cheddar topping, instead (since I had it on hand) used a couple slices of provolone and mozzarella...I too used a full 26 oz jar of spag sauce (Ragu) and less than the full pkg of spag noodles.  Thanks for a great and easy recipe...I made it this morning and let it rest in the fridge till dinner time.

For as simple as this dish is it was very tasty. I did use a 1lb. 10 oz. jar of sauce. I also layered and ended up using 2 cups of cheddar and 2 cups of mozzarella. If you like saucy spaghetti (like my husband) you may find this dry, but as someone who doesn't pour a lake of sauce on theirs this is just right.

This was indeed an easy and very tasty recipe.  I added onion powder, salt & peppe to the beef while browning and grated parmesan cheese to the spaghetti while it was hot and before I mixed it with the meat.  The only thing I wouldchange for next time is to add moe sauce b/c it was slightly dry.

This was very easy to make and came out well.  I used ground turkey instead of ground beef, wheat noodles instead of regular and used mozzerella instead of cheddar.  I also used one and a half jars of sauce based on other reviews.  We have plenty of left overs.  I would make this again.

This was a simple and tasty recipe.  I added a can of sliced mushrooms, but other than that, followed the recipe.  I might cover the casserole with foil next time for the first 15 minutes as the cheese and pasta on top was a little overdone.

I followed the suggestion of adding additional sauce (almost another full jar) and sauteed onions and garlic before cooking the beef.  We used monterry jack, cheddar, and queso cheeses (what I had on hand) and overall it came out rather well.  Next time I'll try a more robust sauce than the marinara we used, but my son really liked it!

Messy, and you basically make spaghetti and then bake it with the cheese on top.  Not different enough from regular spaghetti to make it worth the extra time in my opinion.  It does taste good and my family liked it but no more than our regular spaghetti.

As a spaghetti lover, this recipe was a fun new twist to the same old spaghetti and meat sauce.  I used about 1/2 to 3/4 cup more spaghetti sauce the second time I made this recipe because I found it a little dry only using 1 cup.  Makes great leftovers, reheats well.

This turned out great for a family supper.  I took the hint from other reviews about it being a little dry, so I added a can of cream of chicken soup.  My family loved it!  I also used 1 pound of ground beef.  We like this better than regular spaghetti.

This is great basic recipe, but I really prefer things a bit spicier.  Use a flavourful tomato sauce or I spiced mine up with red pepper flakes, basil and a pre-mixed spicy flavouring shaker.  Parmesan on top was also a treat!  I substituted 1.5 cups dry TVP (So Soya) for the ground beef; this worked well!

Was too dry, and the proportions of the noodles and sauce were off. Next time I will make it with less noodles and more sauce.

This was sure easy to make and something almost everyone can enjoy.  I included some ground Italian Sausage to the ground beef for added flavor. About 15 years ago I first tasted baked spaghetti and have been wondering how to replicate it ever since. Thank you!

EASY, TASTY and QUICK. What more can you ask for?! Make your spaghetti sauce from scratch or jar of Prego (my preference as it is on the sweet side and not too bad for the jar). Mix sauce with spaghetti and pour in a 9x13 dish. I did follow others to add butter and fresh basil to the noodles. Spruced up plain ole noodles. Add favorite cheese to the top to bake. What a great meal~! Can't go wrong.

I made this with jarred pizza sauce instead of spaghetti sauce, I used Worcestershire sauce to season the ground beef a little. It was amazing! Thanks for the recipe!

I think this is good, basic, comfort food. Baked spaghetti was a much loved economy dish of years ago when times were tough, 1930s thru 1950s. I made it just as posted. I have to gently disagree with users who think that there is not enough sauce - the whole idea was that the sauce would bake into the pasta, and intensify flavour in the oven. You should be able to *cut* neat portions of it. Anyway, it ain't haute-cuisine but it sure is satisfying. 5 stars from me.

This is a good basic recipe.  I did add more spices to the sauce, which I suggest or it will be very bland.  I used a 24 oz. jar of sauce, and it was still slighty dry.  Next time I will either use more sauce, or a less spaghetti so it won't be quite so dry.

I'm a new step mom and after cooking gourmet meals for friends and family I have been struggling. I just received this recipe thru e-mail. I added  1/4 t of garlic and onion powder along with 1/2 t of rosemary and1/4 cp of Parmesan cheese to the meat, sauce and spaghetti.  I served it with bread stick and a fresh veggie tray with ranch dressing ( a staple and how we get veggies in them)The kids and my partner love it. For me it was OK but I have 2 kids preparing for movie and very happy they had a " meal that rocked". Thanks allrecipe.

I love this baked spaghetti!! What I like most about it is the baked part, it makes it easier and less messy for my 16 month old to eat! I do use more sauce because after trying the original recipe the first time I found it to come out kind of dry. So I add just a bit more sauce and I also brown mushrooms with my ground beef. My whole family loves this recipe, it makes great leftovers as well!! : )Oh and did I mention its so EASY!!

This was a pretty good recipe. I added red and green bell peppers, mushrooms, green and white onions, and tomatoes. I also added seasoning salt, Cajun seasoning, salt, pepper and garlic.I love how easy the recipe is and how modifiable the recipe is. It can be doctored up or kept plain and simple.

This was excellent for our household. I ended up using mozzarella, italian, and feta cheese in the the spaghetti as well as cilantro, mushrooms, and some zucchini. Before I put it in the oven, I put one layer in the pan, covered with cheese, added the second layer and topped with the remainder of sauce and cheese. Over all this was a successful dish.

excellent - used reviewer 2's ideas.  sweet Italian sausage and a little onion.  one cup of cheddar mixed with the sauce.  two cups over top.  16 oz jar of spaghetti sauce with about 1 cup more.  also made most ahead and put together with just cooked spaghetti to bake together for 30 minutes.

This is great recipea  for me because I can fix it the night before and refridgerate. When I get home in the evening all I have to do is pop it in the microwave to warm it up,  then add the cheese on top and follow baking directions. With a bagged green salad and a crusty roll it feels like someone was at home making a delicious dinner for us! It does need a little more sauce than the recipe calls for so buy a larger jar and add to your taste. You can also tweak the cheese to your taste. I use the shredded Italian mix you can buy. Thanks for this recipe!!!

I tried this recipe last night and my whole family loved it.  They said they prefer this recipe of baking the spaghetti and just plain old spaghetti.  I did add frozen meatballs from Costco instead of ground beef and added fresh parmasian cheese with the sharp cheddar cheese.

It was definitely yummy (and my family dug it) but as a pasta connoisseur, this was definitely far from authentic. (But then again I wasn't expecting authenticity from a jar of spaghetti sauce and cheddar cheese.) (: It was a tad bland for my taste, so if I make again, I will definitely add some mushrooms and other veggies, as well as top off with fresh tomatoes once baked. The top layer of the spaghetti was crunchy once it came out of the oven, which was kind of disappointing. But all in all, it was a lot of food, super easy to prepare, and very inexpensive, so I will definitely be making it again for my kiddo. (:

simple and delicious! I used ground turkey instead of ground beef and put cheese in the middle as others suggested. I used about twice the amount of sauce. The leftovers were fantastic!

Its one thing when a recipe is simple and leaves it to you to put whatever seasonings you want.  Its another when the measurements for the base ingredients are completely off.  I am so glad I had extra spaghettie sauce because before even baking it I could tell it was going to be dry like what I read in other reviews.  Double the sauce, then everythings is fine.

I made some modifications - I used veggie crumbles instead of ground beef, and I added garlic powder, dried basil, and dried oregano while it was browning.  I used an assortment of cheese - mozzarella, Triple Cheddar, Parmigiano Reggiano, and Romano.  I mixed some of the last two cheeses in with the warm spaghetti noodles. This is a great way to sneak in whole wheat pasta, we didn't even know the difference. Great base recipe!!

I followed the directions dutifully and ended up with about five times too much pasta! It smelled wonderful, but came out as clumps of starchy pink pasta!

I loved making this... super easy! I am a nanny and it was a perfect last-minute dish to make when you have no idea what to make for dinner. They all loved it. I used Mozzarella cheese instead of cheddar and I put pepperoni on top and the cheese on top of that to make it a pizza/spaghetti bake. Wonderful!

This is a good basic recipe to build on.  I used penne instead of spaghetti because that's what I had on hand.  I cooked a mixture of ground pork and beef in a pan with minced garlic, olive oil, and diced onion.  I then mixed the cooked meat, boiled penne, and spaghetti sauce all together.  I poured the mixture into a 9"x13" baking pan and sprinkled Parmesan and shredded cheddar cheese on top.  The baked pasta would've been perfect as is but to make it a little healthier, I steamed some broccoli and added it on top of the pasta in the last 5 minutes of baking in the oven.  The baked pasta turned out perfectly!

I love this basic and easy recipe.  My mother has made pasta this way for years.  It's a really great base.  I used grated swiss cheese this time for a little bit of kick but cheddar hits the spot too.  I also added some mushrooms and green peppers to the pasta sauce but it taste fine without.  Fantastic!

I didn't care for this recipe.  It was too dry and not very flavorful.  I used hunts traditional spaghetti sauce.  I may try it again with a different type of sauce and add a few other ingredients.

Overall it was good. I think it needed a little more sauce, I used Colby jack cheddar cheese. Also instead of ground beef I used ground sausage. It was really tasty, it just needed more sauce. I will make this again in the future.

I know this is a basic baked spaghetti recipe however, it lacked a lot in taste. It needed much more sauce than indicated. The most dominate flavor was the noodles. If I make again, I will double the meat, cheese and sauce.

The first time I made this, I pretty much followed the recipe exactly, and my fiance said it was "ok." I made it again last night with some modifications. First, I used more sauce, as there wasn't quite enough last time. Also, I included a can of sliced mushrooms, garlic powder, and italian seasoning. I topped everything with shredded cheese, plus a generous portion of parmesan cheese. This time, my fiance said it was "really good" and went back for more.

Nice, easy recipe.  Makes a ton of food to feed a good-sized crowd.  Would suggest adding a variety of cheeses instead of just cheddar, but it came out great following the recipe as directed.  Thanks for sharing!

This was a great start for Baked Spaghetti. I used this recipe and modified it for the ingredients I had on hand and to my liking. First, I used a 26 oz. can spaghetti sauce because I didin't have a 16 oz. can. Second, I added onion powder (my husband doesn't like onions) and garlic powder to the sauce to a little extra flavor. Third, I added an extra 1 1/2 c. mozzarella cheese plus the 1 c. cheddar because we are big cheese eaters. Thanks for the recipe!

If you've never made baked spaghetti, this is a great recipe to start with. Hint:I think its best to have regular spaghetti one night and save the left overs to make baked spaghetti the net time.

With the consideration of reviewers' notes: I sauted onion and garlic in olive oil then simmered it with the sauce; cooked the noodles and then mixed with muenster cheese; added 1 tspn oregano, 1 tspn onion powder, 1 tspn garlic powder; used mozzarella and parmesan on top; garnished with dried basil. I didn't measure noodle/sauce/cheese quantities - just eyeballed everything. Some of the noodles on the edge were crispy but most stayed nicely moist. A great variation on spaghetti and a quick, yummy dinner!

I was a little wary because I thought the spaghetti noodles would dry out in the oven, but it came out wonderfully! Next time, I want to try adding some sausage, mushrooms, and extra cheeses.

Very good.  I took the other suggestions and seasoned the ground beef with garlic powder, salt, pepper & italian seasoning.  I also added pureed squash to the sauce so I could sneak in some veggies for the kids.

This one wasn't for us.  I'm all for jarred sauce, we eat it quite often but when baked like this (22 minutes) it just got very dry, I even used a 25 oz. jar of sauce instead of the 16 oz.  The noodles even seemed more cooked than what I started with.  I'll stick with the regular way.

I thought this was a really neat, easy way to make spaghetti a bit different.  My 2 year old scoffed the lot, as did hubs.  Its basic, like the recipe says, but a good base to play around with different cheeses and you can add garlic, onions, etc to your liking.

I really liked how easy this recipe was.  But I did not use the hamburger meat. I mixed the spaghetti and sauce together as instructed, sprinkled parmesan cheesse over it and added 4 breaded Veal Patties on top. It was really good. But when I make it again I will add mozzarella cheese and a 24oz. jar of spaghetti sauce instead.

Very good. I added a little cheese and I think the next time I will try it with American or Parmesean cheese. We'll see. Just a touch dry too but I think I went a little over the time and maybe slightly too much pasta.

I made this tonight and it was great!  I added extra cheese (cheddar and italian), onions, garlic, season all, and italian seasonings.  I wasn't sure if it was really going to be worth the extra step to bake it after I cooked it but it was perfect!

5 stars for EASY and yummy.  I used mozzarella because my husband would never go for cheddar cheese on spaghetti.  I used whole wheat spaghetti, which I usually hate, but it tasted OK in this dish.  Great weeknight meal!

My family said this was one of the best spaghetti's I have made.  The only thing I changed (for preference sake) was I used 2 jars of sauce and put a layer of Ricotta before the cheddar.  Yummy! Thank you for a great recipe.

This was a pretty good dish. I used a homemade spaghetti sauce which is really what makes this dish. I had to substitute bowtie pasta for the spaghetti and a mozzarella/cheddar mix. This is a good starting point. As the name states this is "basic" baked spaghetti.

This was very good! I added minced garlic, and italian seasoning, and it was very good! I do think 30 min in the oven is too much. After the 30 min, the cheese on top was overcooked and hard. I think maybe 15-20 min would be enough. Otherwise, very good!

OMG this is DEE-LISH!  This is the only way I will eat spaghetti from now on.  The only thing I would change is to save a little sauce so that you can drizzle on each individual serving.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

I'm very glad I found this recipe. I've always dreaded "spaghetti night". My family loves spaghetti but I've never been a big fan of the basic meat, sauce, noodles recipe - even mixing the meat and sauce with the noodles was too bland. I tried this recipe and LOVED IT - and it was a huge hit with the family. It's a great basic recipe that actually flavors the pasta!  I added garlic powder, dried oregano, red pepper flakes, and minced onion to the ground beef while cooking to give it more flavor. And I used a mixture of shredded mozzarella and colby jack cheeses on top. Next time I think I will add some extra stewed tomatoes to the sauce, but otherwise it was great! Thanks for helping me find the love of spaghetti!

I have been making this for years, only my own way.  Instead of ground beef, I use Italian sausage.  After it is browned, I add a jar of whatever pasta sauce sounds good at the moment, and use ALMOST a pound of whatever pasta I have (sometimes rotini, sometimes bowtie, or whatever).  I cut it a little short only because I prefer a "saucier" pasta.  And I top mine with either shredded mozarella or sometime if Italian cheese blend.  It's super easy, quick, and cheap... which is perfect when you are on a budget and don't get home from work until 6:30.  Really, this is a very versatile recipe.  If you stick to one pound of meat, one pound of pasta, one jar of sauce, and one 8oz. package of shredded cheese, you almost can't go wrong!

I gave this a 5 because it's a great family meal!  If I was cooking for an older age group I'd probably pass it up.  I added onion to my ground beef, and make sure the middle is hot before serving, my outsides were hot, but the middle was only lukewarm!

I thought this came out very well.  I used a little under a lb of rotelle pasta and added 1 small can of tomatoe sauce to the spaghetti sauce.  I used 1 cup cheddar and 1 cup mozzarella.  I also seasoned the meat with garlic and onion powder and added some slices of pepperoni to the sauce.

MMMMMM!!! So good. All of my kids loved it - even the picky 2-year old. Not a fancy meal, but delicious and easy. I doubled the spaghetti sauce because others said it was a little dry. I also used 1 cup cheddar cheese and 1 cup mozzarella.

Simple, easy and a great starting place.  I thought it was a little dry though, so I will add another jar of sauce next time.  And I like to add at least S&P to the hamburger (I usually also add dried red peppers, basil and oregano).  I also like more cheese, so doubled cheddar and added some parmesan.

I make this recipe as one of my pantry meals.  It's one of those meals where I have all the ingredients on hand in the pantry and freezer.  This a a standby for when I haven't gone grocery shopping in a long while.  I usually use either Tortellini or Gnnochi instead of Spaghetti noodles.  I sometimes use a marinara sauce with italian suasage already in it and skip the ground beef part all together.  Cook the noodles, heat the sauce, toss together and top with grated parmesan and whatever grated white cheese I happen to have on hand and bake for about 20 minutes until everything is hot an the cheese on top is bubbly and browned along the edges.  Serve with rolls and a salad and viola, dinner!  Trader Joe's has some delicious dried pastas and marinara sauces, any of which would work great for this recipe!

This recipe is pretty good. I used kraft double cheddar cheese sauce instead of shredded cheese and I think it might be better if I used shells in stead of spaghetti.

This is a good standby recipe for when you can not be bothered cooking or the shops are shut. I added a little bit more sauce  then stated and also added chopped mushrooms and olives. It was good simple comfort food.

This is a great recipe but I found it to be a bit dry after baking. The next time I made it I also added a small can of tomato paste and "glug" of good red wine. It made it less dry and the taste was still delicious! I also use tons of fresh veggies, some minced garlic and a mixture of mozzy & cheddar cheeses.

Made my own spaghetti sauce for spaghetti the other night and we didn't want to eat spaghetti one more day but made WAY too much.  Topped with sharp cheddar cheese and parmesan and finished the whole thing off.  Very easy way to use up leftover spaghetti without feeling like you've eaten spaghetti over and over!!  Both boys loved it as well as DH and MIL.

So delicious! I used sliced up smoked sausage instead of ground beef and also added sauteed mushrooms and onions.  There were no leftovers! I made a double batch and gave some to my starving-college-student little brother.  He said if I keep making recipes like this, I'll have a permanent dinner guest!

My family struggles using up our leftovers.  I used this recipe for the idea to get rid of spaghetti leftovers.  I used my own spaghetti recipe for one night's dinner.  Then put it all in a pan and spread cheese over top to bake it on the second night.  My family loved it and didn't feel like we had spaghetti twice, but we didn't waste all those good leftovers!

Yum, yum, yummmmmm.  This was so good. I am vegetarian, so I substituted vegetarian ground crumbles for the ground beef. I also used a mix of cheddar, swiss, and parmesan cheeses. It was so perfect and good. My dh LOVED it.

Very good but changed this one up quite a bit. Browned the ground beef with onion and garlic. I also added a few other spices. Added an extra jar of sauce and topped with extra Parmesan Cheese. Thanks for the post.

This was really good with just a few minor changes - definitely increase the sauce to noodle ratio, add fresh mushrooms when cooking the meat, top with mixture of cheddar and mozzerella. Easy and tasty.

Mine turned out dry - I would add more sauce next time.  I think it would also be better with more things, I added black olives, but mushrooms would be good as well.  It was OK

Thanks for this! I too followed some other reviews and cut back on some things and added more sauce. Delicious and a wonderful way to vary the typical spaghetti dinner.

I've never had a baked spaghetti before, so I wasn't sure what to expect. I made a huge batch of sauce and we had regular spaghetti one day and baked spaghetti the next. There was probably 4 or 5 cups of meaty sauce, 12 ounces of angel hair pasta, and I sprinkled maybe 1½ cups of mixed cheddar and mozzarella on top. My husband enjoyed the leftovers at work today! Next time, I'll only cook the pasta slightly as it was REALLY overdone after baking, even though I only cooked to al dente and I rinsed it with cold water. But a great recipe! Thanks, Wendy!

Overall the taste was good, but it was like it was too much spaghetti & not enough sauce, even though the can I used was 26 ounces.

This was a GREAT recipe and a tasty spin on regular old spaghetti! I tweaked mine just a little bit. I browned an onion with my hamburger. I also added a 1/2 cup of parmesean cheese, 3 TBSP melted butter, 1/4 tsp garlic poweder, 1 egg to my noodles. Be sure to let your noodles cool completely (I ran mine under cold water) and hand toss the ingredients together. The noodles stayed a little firmer and had a little more flavor. This is definitely a better-the-next-day dish!

Easy and good.  Makes a cake pan full to the top.
I used two full jars of sauce and could have maybe used a little more.  Also, seasoned my hamburger after browning with partial packet of spaghetti seasoning.
Wished I would of halved the amt of spaghetti or layed cheddar cheese slices in the middle and then on top.
Add cheese the last 15 minuets on the top.  Leftovers are even better.

This is the exact same baked spaghetti my Mom made when I was growing up. You might not think Cheddar cheese would be good on spaghetti, but it's really delicious! Yummy recipe. (I add green peppers and mushrooms to mine ... sometimes zucchini, too.)

Great taste apart making spaghetti the normal way. Didn't use cheddar though - the combination just isn't appealing. Sprinkled mozzarella over it. 

Also, put sausage in the sauce mix. I removed about a lb. of sausage, removed it from the casing, and browned it on the stovetop, then added it to the spaghetti sauce.

First, this was so easy to make.  I had all the ingredients I needed on hand and didn't have to run out to the store for anything.  You gotta love that!  Second, it's a tasty change from the same ole' spaghetti we usually have.  My boyfriend was very reluctant for me to bake the spaghetti, but when it came time to eat, he went back for seconds and agreed that I had won him over with the baked variety.  I read several other reviews before I started cooking, so I went ahead and made the spaghetti with approximately 3 cups of sauce.  That amount seemed just about perfect.

Very simple and easy. I made this a meatless dish and instead of cheddar, used a LOT of mozzerella and parmasan cheese. The kids loved this.

This was just what I needed to use up my leftover spaghetti sauce.  My husband thought it sounded iffy until he tried it.  Then he couldn't stop raving and eating.  Thanks for the idea and helping with the oven time and temp.

Not bad...I used hot Italian sausage instead of hamburger.  Added some needed spice.  Next time I would also add mushrooms.  I would make this again.

This is just as the name implies "basic". It is easy and feeds a big crowd if need or as spaghetti is better the 2nd day.

This is a new go-to favorite! I added garlic (why it's not in the recipe is beyond me) and frankly it needs more ground beef. Could be done with meatballs, too. A great recipe, I'll be doing this for lots of parties in the future. It's one of those "can't mess it up" recipes that is very forgiving if you get the basics down: Spaghetti, sauce, cheese.

Very easy and quick recipe.  I used ground Italian flavored turkey and a jar of Newman's sauce with basil and garlic.  i used about  3/4 of a lb of pasta.  The only change was I used mozzarella cheese and some cheddar .  Maybe I should have used the other 1/4 lb of pasta as its not very deep dish at all and came out tasting very much like pizza.  It's delicious.  Thanks for a great recipe.

As written, I could tell that this recipe would be very bland so I made some changes.  I used a pound of ground beef and a pound of ground sausage. I cooked my meat with a chopped onion and seasoned it with salt, pepper, garlic powder, Italian seasoning and oregano. I used probably about three cups of cheese (I'm really not sure how much it was because I stirred some in with  the mixture as well as sprinkled it on top so I know it was waaaay more than one cup). I also used a 26 ounce jar of Ragu. The hubby loved it. This recipe can serve as a base for the dish, but you'll definitely need to add your own twist to it.

Easy, quick and satisfying!  I used mozzarella and Parmesan and also added some sprinkles of dried oregano. 
Makes plenty for leftovers that warm up fabulously in the microwave.

It was okay. I'm not a big fan of spaghetti, because I ate it sometimes three times a week as a kid. I followed the recipe, but I put mozzarella cheese on top instead of cheddar. I also put minced garlic, onion powder, garlic salt, and natures seasoning in the meat. I Also cooked it at 360 for about 20 or so minutes because every oven is different. My fiancée like it though so I guess I did good.

Yum! I made this without the ground beef and instead topped with leftover meatballs. Cheddar didn't sound appealling, so I used mozzarella cheese on top.  I then flash froze the whole thing, vacuum sealed and placed in the freezer for a delicious, simple meal later.

I had a party of 40 to prepare for and needed something different yet quick to prepare and this fit the bill perfectly. I added mozzarella and Parmesan to the mix. All present were well pleased as was I with the taste and the presentation.

This is good!  I make mine slightly different.  I add onions, diced tomatoes, mushrooms and green pepper to my sauce.  After the sauce and spaghetti is cooked, I spread half the spaghetti in the casserole dish, layer it with half the sauce and add a thin layer of cheddar cheese, then repeat.  SO YUMMY!!

Definitely a fun and tasty way to eat spaghetti. I did add more spaghetti sauce than the recipe called for and the recipe easily lends itself to revisions.

I make this all the time and my husband loves it.  I double the sauce add garlic and Italian spices to the meat and sauce and really ladle it on before baking  otherwise it can be dry.  The left over sauce is put in a gravy boat so it may be poured over the top when served at the table so everyone can make it as saucy as they like.  I have made it with Italian sausage too which makes it extra yummy.  Just depends on what I have available.
I first found this recipe 20 years ago and it was baked in a pie plate and called spaghetti pie.

Just made this for my picky teenage daughters and they loved it. I used one box of Barilla protein angel hair pasta boiled for 4 minutes, 1 jar of Bold & Spicy Ragu and half a jar of Traditional Ragu. I browned 1 lb of organic ground beef and added pepper, garlic salt and oregano. Mixed the pasta with the ground beef sauce and added some black olives. Then put a layer of that in the pan, sprinkled 2 cups of colby jack cheese, another layer of pasta mix and topped with 2 cups of mozzerella. Covered with foil and cooked for 25 minutes, took foil off and cooked another 5 minute. It really is delicious and easy to clean up after too. I will make this again. Thanks!

I made this following the recipe except for nearly doubling the spaghetti sauce and using equal parts cheddar and mozzarella cheeses.  I used almost two full jars of sauce, and it came out perfectly.  I've never made baked spaghetti before; both my husband and I loved it and ate it four nights in a row.  We're going to visit my mother in a few days, and I think I'll make this and bake it when we get there.

I did use this recipe as a starter and that's why I rated it as I did. I seasoned it to our taste preference with garlic, oregano, onion powder, and basil. I also added chopped spinach and Parmesan before mixing in the noodles. Yummy!

Agreeing with another reviewer who said it's a lot of work for (basically) spaghetti with cheese.

This was a fun and different way to serve up spaghetti, since my son loves it. I won't make it again. Came out very dry and a bit pasty. I follows direction down but adding a few spices and sauté  onion and garlic with meat.  kids eat it but did not rave about it..

I'm a cheese lover, but not that big on spaghetti. However, this spaghetti is delicious! I added a few shakes of parsley flakes and more cheese! Let's not forget the buttered toast... mmm (:

This is way too easy to make! Use left over spaghetti, it seems to taste even better.

I made this recipe because it was super simple and basic. I was so disappointed with it because in order for it to taste like anything, you have to use tons of cheese which makes it super unhealthy. 1 cup of cheese did nothing for this recipe and on top of that I seasoned the meat because it did look like it may be bland and boy was it.

Not a cheddar cheese fan.  The taste dominates the sauce flavor. But mozzarella comes out perfect. With a little Parmesan. Like other posts.....great comfort food. Good recipe for a basic meal. Thanks

Definitely needs more sauce and more cheese. I think I used 3x the sauce,but my sauce is homemade and thick with veggies. If you use a thin, jar sauce you would probably be okay. I probably used 2 cups of cheese, 1 cup in the middle and one on top. I will add more cheese next time. It also made more than would fit in my casserole dish, so I have a smaller dish to put in the freezer.

Great basic recipe.  I only had grated parm. and it melted too quickly in the oven.  I was afraid the dish would burn and so I removed it before the spaghetti set.  So I'll definitely will use cheddar next time.  Thanks for sharing.

This was a great dinner.  If you make it as recipe states, it takes awhile.  If you use it with leftover spaghetti, it's fast and a great way to revisit the same meal.  I made as recipe stated except used less spaghetti, so it was a little soupy and not as much baked as it should have been - but we like more sauce so we thought it was great.  The kids went back for seconds and wanted it for lunch the next day.  That is a big hit in my opinion!

This is a good basic recipe.  However, I used one pound 90% ground beef, a 24 oz. jar of Basil Garlic pasta sauce & 1/2 lb. Fusilli pasta.  I played around with adding extra dried basil, Italian seasoning, garlic pasta, etc.  I also put 1 cup shredded Mozzarella cheese on top. It was quite good.  I will definitely try this again.  Thinking I might put 1/2 Cup Parmesan cheese on top also.

Great basic recipe!  We added lots of seasoning, used sausage for half of the meat, and used a mixture of cheddar and mozzarella.  Thanks for the recipe!

I tried this recipe today and it was pretty good. I used a pizza blend cheese and topped it with parmesan. It made a really nice crust but I think next time I'll try american cheese....good recipe!

My boys balk at the different texture of whole wheat spaghetti, but this recipe makes texture a non-issue.  I'm sure this is delicious vegetarian -- how I normally cook -- but it also tastes great with less ground beef than stated and only enough cheese to cover the top (a bit healthier).  I added mushrooms, onions, garlic, some olives I needed to use up, and extra spices. Next time I will probably make it 100% vegetarian, including grated carrots, bell peppers and tomato chunks.  I don't know why the same ingredients taste so good baked, but it's a tasty alternative when I can afford the extra 30-minute cooking time.

Good and quick. I used frozen meatballs instead of ground meat. Turned out very tasty, however I had to add a little more sauce.

I even added more lean ground beef to make it a whole pound for the dish, I reduced the pasta to 4 servings, and increased the cheese 6 more ounces, crowned it with fresh parmesan cheese and it still wasn't a recipe I would use again. I've had much better!

Made this tonight. It was easy, quick & delicious. I used ground turkey & added garlic powder, minced onions, basil, oregano, red wine vinegar & a touch of olive oil to the turkey & sauce mixture. I'm lactose, so I used Almond Cheddar Cheese from Whole Foods instead of a dairy based cheddar. I used 365 Organic Spaghetti sauce from Whole Foods. Very, very good. I will make again when I have a big crowd.

I really liked this. I'm just learning to follow recipes and was pleased when I came across this since I had all of the ingredients needed. My husband and my sons scraped their plates. Only thing I was concerned about was whether I'd done something wrong because it seemed a bit dry to me--like maybe I should have put a little more sauce in it. But overall, came out great and tasted yummy.

This was very good, my family loved it! (And I was so happy to find a simple recipe without ricotta or cottage cheese in it, no one in my family likes those.) I used Italian cheese & linguini noodles. Looking forward to eating the leftovers for lunch & making it again in the future.

all i can say is WOW. this was absolutely fantastic. I added some portobello mushrooms, garlic, and 1 small onion to the beef while it was browning. Normally when I make speghetti i find that it is a little bit watery and I can never figure out why. This was thick and cheesy and friggin amazing.

Have made this several times.  My family loves it and the leftovers are delish! I often cut pepperoni into slices, preheat to get rid of the grease and throw those into the mix too. SO YUMMY! **edit** I've started adding a jar of alfredo to the jar of spaghetti sauce as well as sauteeing peppers and onions to add to the mix. The extra jar of sauce keeps the dish more moist which it needed in my opinion.  Granted it takes me a little more time to make now but its so yummy I don't mind :)

Soo good and easy!  I stuck to the recipe mostly but I added some stewed tomatoes and onion in the mix, and I seasoned the ground beef with seasoned salt and pepper. I also added a TINY bit of sugar. Like less than a teaspoonful. I also added a LOT more cheese, naturally. Will be repeating this!

A great "back bone" recipe!  I actually had some left over cooked ground beef from a recipe from the night before.  Because it wasn't a full pound of meat I added half a chopped green bell pepper, half a chopped red bell pepper and half a chopped onion.  I saute them in some olive oil w/ a dash of Italian Seasoning.  Used my jar of spaghetti sauce.  Oh, I had to substitute the spaghetti noodles w/ rotini noodles.  Baked for 20 min (to prevent the over drying) and it came out wonderfully!!!  Fast and filling for those busy weeknights.  Plus it makes for great left overs.

I thought this dish was okay...but was a little too dry for my taste! I followed the recipe exactly, except i used a 20 oz jar of sauce instead of 16 oz...and it was still too dry! I think next time I will use two 16 oz jars and also use italian sausage in place of the ground beef. With these couple adjustments I'm sure it would be a great meal!

My boys loved this spaghetti.  It was simple to make.  Next time I will add a little more sauce.  The cheddar went well, even though it is odd to use for Italian food.

Followed the recipe as suggested, with just one minor change. I added about 3/4 cup cheddar to the sauce, and then topped the casserole off with LOTS of mozza - yummmmmy!

This was a hit with my husband. The kids ate it, but whined for a couple minutes first. They are in their picky phase! It makes a lot, so we will definitely have enough for lunch for the next day or two. I used shredded chicken instead of turkey.

It's a good basic recipe. But honestly, I didn't see why it was that much better than plain old spaghetti. My family does like it, however. I use 2 cans of sauce (Prego), Italian Seasoning, a pound of Hamburger, a can of diced tomatoes and 2 cups of cheese. Those are the modifications I've made. It's good, it's just from the reviews I expected more "Wow!" factor.

This is a great recipe for as simple as it is.  There are way too many dirty dishes for 4 ingredients, though!! That part was not so nice.  The only change I made was to add a can of tomato sauce and a bunch of spices b/c of the plain sauce.  Oh, also I used an additional cup of mozz. cheese and mixed half a cup of each in the mixture and topped with the other.

As is, this recipe is just okay... on the bland side and not very enjoyable. I thought it needed way more than 16 ounces of sauce. It looks like a lot of the people who gave good reviews added more sauce and ingredients to liven up the taste. I may try again with changes.

Made this last night and wow! what a hit, my daughter ate it all plus seconds! It was delicious, I followed the recipe with additions of green peppers, chopped onions, mushrooms and some garlic powder. I used cheese slices instead of cheddar cheeses(lol all i had) and a cup of grated mozza, with some parm. A friend stopped by and i sent her home with some, she called my back and said it was the best pasta she has ever had! Try this you wont be disappointed. Thanks everyone for the additions and tx Wendy for the recipe.

I agree with previous reviews that say this is a great starter. I've been using this recipe for a while with a few changes. First, I up the ground beef to 1 lb. I also put seasoned salt, pepper, garlic powder, chili powder, and onion powder in the ground beef while it is cooking. I also combine mozzarella and parmesan cheese with the mild cheddar cheese.

Fantastic! I am giving this 5 stars because my husband, who has many times told me he hates spaghetti, ate this up! I used sharp cheddar and parmaean cheese. Next time I will use mozerella as well.  I also added an exta can of tomato sauce with some basil thrown in, as it seemed too dry at first.  Thanks for this way to get my hubby to eat spaghetti!

This was a good casserole. Very easy and tasty. I did as others suggested and used some additional Italian sausage, onion, and garlic cloves which really helped the taste. I could not believe how much this made. I think one could easily feed 8 people with this recipe.  It's a great potluck dish!

This was really good, but makes a lot of spagetti!  I made it for my family of 4 and I felt like I was eating leftovers for over a week.  It was very good, and would be great if we had guests over!

Instead of cooking the noodles beforehand, I dumped all the ingredients into a baking dish (except for the cheese), added water, and let the sauce cook into the noodles more so than it would've the other way. This gives it a fuller taste, and adding the cheese for the last 30 minutes of baking still works perfectly, though I did use half mozzarella and half cheddar with a dusting of grated Parmesan. The only other suggestion is to make sure (when opting to cook the noodles in the oven) to stir frequently and add plenty of water so the spaghetti noodles don't clump up and stick together. The family LOVED the recipe and it was a wonderful change from the basic spaghetti.

I am rating this high for two reasons: 1) it is a great use of leftovers and 2) as other reviewers have said, it's a great 'starter' recipe. As is, I can see how it would be a bit blah. To my leftover pasta and homemade sauce I raided my fridge and added black olives, precooked sausage, pepperoni and chicken, fresh mushrooms, onions and a few other things and then I topped with a mixture of cheeses to use up all the bits and pieces I had. Big hit and my guys scraped the dish clean!

This was a pretty good (like it says) basic recipe. I put tons of seasonings into the meat while it cooked, and mixed it with mozarella and cheddar cheese in the middle and on top when I baked it. It was a little dry for me. I defintely want to try it again, but maybe more sauce, more cheese (maybe pepperjack) and more spices!!! Thanks for the recipe!

I used this recipe mostly as a template because I had a lot of leftover sauce w/meatballs.  I did a layer of spaghetti/sauce, layer of mozzerella/cheddar, layer of spaghetti, then sprinkled mozzerella and parmesan on top and baked until cheese melted.  Didn't think I'd like the cheddar, but I really enjoyed it.

I'm giving this a "5" based solely on the reaction from my 2 year old.  She took a couple of bites and I heard "Yuuuuummmy!!"  After that, I knew I would add this to our rotation.  I used extra lean turkey meat and whole wheat pasta.  We used FF shredded cheese but it didn't melt very well.  Next time I'll use real cheese and layer it in the spaghetti before baking.   I'm not a cheese person, but even I enjoyed the extra flavor.  Thanks for an easy dinner!!

I was looking for something different...read the sugguestions and added mushrooms, minced garlic and diced onion as well as doubling the sauce (which was homemade).  Would make this again, just not sure it was one to put on the family favorite list

I thought this was decent the first night....however, as the sole meat-eater in my house, I had a ton of leftovers that I put in containers for lunches over the week. I've got to say, this recipe reheats TERRIBLY. It's dry, the cheese gets hard, and when you cut into it, the spaghetti ends up in these tiny little pieces that you can't pick up. The shining light was the turkey I put in in place of ground beef (which I don't eat). Next time I make this, I will use a lot more sauce and I will use a pasta shape that is more conducive to being picked up easily such as macaroni or penne.

I liked it a lot better than regular spaghetti, but DH was not as keen as I was.  That's the only reason it's getting 4 stars and not five.

We are vegetarian so we didnt add the ground meat. As written its just okay. I added garlic, spices, green bell peppers, onions, and a mix of 5 different white cheeses.

My family loved this recipe! I gave a five star rating even though I didn't have any cheddar and just used mozzarella cheese but we can't wait to try it with cheddar next time! Also I decided next time that I will try to layer noodles/sauce then cheese, noodles/sauce then cheese again! Thanks for sharing!

This is a good recipe however it is a little bland.  I will use others suggestions next time I make it and cook the hamburger with onion and garlic.  I will also try adding different spices to my spaghetti sauce.  Thanks for the idea!!

Delish!  I agree with the other cooks that more sauce is needed.  I think it depends on the sauce you use and how much meat you cook up, but I definitely had much more spaghetti than sauce.  I added oregano & garlic powder to my spaghetti sauce, but you may not need to add anything if you choose a great-flavored sauce!  This dish pairs excellently atop a thick slice of garlic bread (how my husband likes to eat anything Italian & saucy!).

This recipe was a good starting point. I browned the meat with onion and minced garlic.  I then added 29oz can of tomatoe puree, 6oz can of tomato paste, 2tsp of basil, 2Tbs of sugar, black pepper and crushed red pepper. Then I mixed the spaghetti with sauce and added a cup of cheddar, a cup of mozzeralla and several sliced of provolone on top.  My husband and 2 year old daughter loved it!

This was a very delicious starter recipe. I threw in an onion and garlic salt with the ground beef. I also put two different cheeses on top. It turned out really delicious, and it's easy to make lot's so you can make ahead and freeze.

I'm rating this on what I think it could be, not what it was.  I used a 24-oz. jar of spaghetti sauce and it was still very dry - kind of like "hot lunch" spaghetti in elementary school.  Next time I would want to either add more sauce or less pasta (like maybe 1/2 - 3/4 of a lb.).
I also added chopped onion and garlic to the ground beef before adding the sauce, which made it quite yummy, and added a bunch of spices to "doctor" the jar of sauce.  All in all, with these changes, this is a meal I'll definitely be making again.

Yum! SOOO good and great as a leftover. But I mad a few changes:i seasoned the ground beef with italian seasoning and basil before cooking it. Then added onions to the beef while it cooked. I drained the ground beef before letting it simmer with the sauce,because it continues to get greasy while it simmers. I also ended up using about 1.5 lbs of sauce to give the dish a saucier texture. And i added a lot more seasoning to the spaghetti/meat mixture before baking.

I made this for dinner yesterday, and my family & guest loved it! I made my own sauce, added a very thin layer of ricotta cheese to the top of ground beef,and used angel hair pasta (personal preference). I topped with monterey jack cheese. I did season the ground beef with oregano, basil, garlic powder and onion powder. I will definitely make this again. Thanks for sharing!

Quick and easy recipe, five stars because my five year old said he LOVED it. I did make the following changes though: added  salt, pepper, basil, garlic and onion to the beef while browning, used 1.5 jars of spaghetti sauce and used 1 cup cheddar and 1 cup mozzarella on top.  Great for a  casual family meal.

I am giving this a 4 because it is a great base recipe but I wouldn't want to make it as written otherwise.  I sauteed mushrooms and 1 onion in olive oil.  I set this mixture aside and then browned meat in same pan.  I added Italian seasonings, garlic powder, and kosher salt to meat.  After meat was browned I put the mushroom/onion mixture back in and then covered it with spaghetti sauce.  I only had egg noodles on hand and so I used those.  Followed the recipe besides these alterations and broiled the cheese and the end to brown it a bit.  If there are only a few of you in your household I would recommend cutting this recipe in half.  I was counting on leftovers but I made WAY too much for the two of us.  We are going to be eating this for a week!  

FYI:  I served this with the "Cheesy Garlic Bread" from this site submitted by Gina.  Fantasitc!

I'm new to cooking and tried this. It turned out really well. I used a 26 ounce can of Spaghetti sauce that way it wouldn't be so dry.  The next time I think I will try adding some garlic. Otherwise, it was delicious.  We have leftovers for the week!

I used a little more meat than was requested and only had Mexican cheese on hand (which worried me a little) but it still turned out just as great. Actually gave leftovers to Italian in-laws and they loved it as well. My niece (who apparently never eats spaghetti unless is plain) actually asked for seconds as well as the other children. We will make this again. I did take it out a little early because we were afraid 30 minutes was too long. It turned out just great anyways.

My husband wanted baked spaghetti and I hate to make it but figured what the hay. I got this recipe read the reviews and thought why not I doubled the recipe because I have 5 kids and three are teens. I gave it four stars because it was nowhere near enough sauce it was almost to the point of being dry. next time I will add more sauce. Thanks

This was a hit at my house!  Don't expect a fancy dinner but it is great for a quick easy dinner.  We had a ton of leftover spaghetti from a night out to dinner.  No one really liked the pasta in the first place but after adding a bit of sauce, some garlic salt, olives and cheese they scarfed it down.  The best part was no one even realized that it was the yucky spaghetti from the other night!  I will definately do this again!

I am still waiting on this to cook but figured I'd review the "prep". It took me much longer than 20 minutes to prepare the dish. Closer to 40 minutes - maybe it was just my water taking forever. I browned the meat and then drained it. Then added the sauce, garlic salt, onion salt, onion powder, Italian seasonings, parsley, and basil and allowed it all to simmer while the water was boiling/spaghetti was cooking. Also, I used a large can of sauce and it was barely enough - so definetly next time I am using 2! I mixed 1 cup of cheddar cheese into the sauce which I had simmering w/ the beef. Then I mixed the sauce/beef/cheese mixture in with the drained spaghetti and put that into a greased cooking dish. Then I topped it with 1 cup cheddar and 1 cup mozzerella. I hope my husband likes it!

didn't add meat, just sauce and cheese, and it wasn't bad at all. For a quick fix, when your in a bind, not a bad dish. Maybe not for company you want to impress, but certainly for old friends who love you regardless of what you serve, so long as it's edible.

Pretty yummy and very easy. I used Prego -original I think, and added garlic, mozzerella and some butter on the pasta. I layered the cheese which made it nice and cheesy throughout. Next time I will add more garlic -I used about 4 cloves. My boyfriend and I had leftovers for a week ,it kept well and my boyfriend thanked me for making it every time he ate it.

This was a very good recipe.  I don't understand why people like Mama2bearcubs completely reinvents the recipe and then gives it a thumbs up.  If you completely change the recipe then give it a new name....and call it your own.

This is a great recipe. I made my spaghetti     like I generally do then I followed the rest of the recipe. My family loved this easy and great recipe. What I will do differently next time is use my spaghetti leftovers.

We loved it! I used frozen meatballs and made it like a cake. Will use cheese between the pasta and meatsauce. Then pile in the rest. 

Thank you!

I made this dish for my boyfriend and I last night.  I have never made spaghetti in my life and, I must say, think this turned out pretty good!  
I took the advice of other reviewers and seasoned the ground beef.  I also had fun "doctoring" my store-bought spaghetti sauce with olive oil, paprika, onions, garlic salt, etc.  I also added cheese to the sauce as well as the top of the spaghetti before I baked it.  I baked it for about 20 minutes uncovered.  My spaghetti wasn't dry at all.  However, I will definitely have to remember that 1lb.of pasta is entirely too much for 2 people!  My boyfriend only had the complaint that breaking the pasta to make shorter noodles in the future would be appreciated.

This was really good and something my son would def. eat.  I used feta and white extra sharp cheese.  Like others I added onions and garlic.  So yummy I will definately keep this one around.  It is VERY easy to please everyone around my house with this one.

This meal was extremely easy to make, and it was a hit at our house, especially with my husband.  We used 26oz of spaghetti sauce in our casserole, and we both agreed the dish needed more sauce.  We love cheese, so we will also add mozzarella next time.  Thank you for sharing!

This tasted great!  It was very similar to the classic spaghettie, but I liked it with the cheese on top.  I added lots of garlic and seasoning to regular jarred sauce.  Seeing that everyone wrote it was a bit dry and I didnt have extra sauce I added water to the bottom of the dish and it came out perfect!  My 3 year old loved it.  Definatley a keeper :o).

This was a good and I will make it again with modifications. I will add mushrooms/sauteed zucchini to add something green and reduce the amount of pasta. 1lb is serious overkill. Otherwise we enjoyed it, thank you.

Great recipe Wendy!  As per the other reviews, I added more sauce and covered during the first 20 minutes of baking.  Also used TexMex pre-grated cheese (Monterey Jack, Cheddar, & Mozza) and layered as one would a lasagna.  My guy loved it as did I and I'd make it again.  Refreshing change from spaghetti and lasagne.

Again, excellent and thank you!

You would think spaghetti is just spaghetti!! But no this tasted a little different, which really did make a nice change. I did add a can of chopped toms, which also contained chopped peppers onion and aubergines. This I found made it not so dry. I added regular mature cheddar to the bake. and finished with grated parmasen. I will be making this on a regular basis.

This is so easy and tastes so good.  I use it for AWANA nights when there isn't alot of time to cook or eat.  I make it ahead and because it's caserole-ish it keeps its heat well.  Tastes even better on day 2.

I gave this four stars because it was easy and fairly quick. I made mine meatless. I think that next time I will experiment with maybe an Italian cheese blend rather than the cheddar. I thought the cheddar was ok but not great. If I were to add the cheddar I think I would use a cheddar cheese soup mixed in instead. I would make it again with a few adjustments! I see potential!

I have been making spaghetti like this for quite sometime now (I use mozzarella, but have always wanted to try Cheddar).  It is the only way my husband will eat spaghetti, and since I've been doing this, I don't like regular spaghetti either.  It's a great twist on spaghetti!

I added a lot more sauce (based on the other reviews).  It was okay, nothing special.  But it was very easy!

I've always wanted to try baked spaghetti and being that I just happened to have had plain cooked leftover spaghetti in the fridge I decided to give it a try. I also had leftover sausage and peppers from our daughters grad party, so I threw that in too. I know I didn't use 3/4 of a pound of the pasta, but I did use a whole jar of sauce. I topped with a bag of shredded Italian six cheeses and of course added my usual seasonings. My kids and hubby really liked this dish. Great way to get rid of the leftovers. Thanks Wendy!
