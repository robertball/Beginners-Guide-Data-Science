The eggnog flavor stands out in these waffles. I could see this recipe as a great way to use up leftover eggnog or just to have that holiday flavored meal. No changes made!

I made this as written and then divided the batter. The first batch was just like it says, topped with a little organic maple syrup and chopped pecans. The second bath I added crispy apple wood  smoked bacon. The final batch I added a pinch of cinnamon and dried orange rind. All were wonderful and the last two variations really brought out the eggnog flavor. I would caution new cooks, if you heat your butter in the microwave to melt, do not take it straight out and pour into your egg or you will cook the egg. I blended a little of the butter with the eggnog to cool the butter prior to adding. Delish! This will be a great holiday breakfast offering for a carb hungry family.
