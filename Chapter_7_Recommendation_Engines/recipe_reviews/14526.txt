This is a fantastic recipe..especially made on the grill. I'm concerned with the comment made by PJBAHR who said they saved the marinade and added pineapple tidbits and served on the side with the chicken.  Please don't EVER reuse a marinade as a condiment or dipping sauce that raw chicken has been marinating in UNLESS you boil it first!...you run the risk of salmonella poisoning.  (You should do this with any type of marinade, no matter what kind of meat is used).
Thanks for the great recipe!

Very tasty.  Made a couple of changes to the 2nd round to suit my family's taste.   Added 2 tablespoons sherry, 1 tablespoon sesame oil, 1/4 teaspoon fresh finely ground ginger, 1/2 teaspoon fresh pressed garlic.  With the additional seasonings, this recipe is a power punch of flavor!!!  Yum!

Instead of BBQ'ing, I marinated the chicken for about two hours, then "fried" it in a 1/2 teaspoon of olive oil.  I made a lot of extra marinade and warmed it up with some pineapple chunks.  I served it over white rice, and used the extra marinade for a dressing for the rice.  This recipe was incredible, and a huge hit at our dinner party.  I can't wait to have it again!

I used skinless boneless chicken breasts and added a generous tsp. of ground ginger and 2 tsp. of garlic powder.  I also grilled the chicken with the pineapple chunks.  Wonderful, wonderful chicken!  I boiled the marinade and served it over plain white rice.  The chicken tasted too good to have a sauce!

This was so good and so easy to make.  I used others' recommendations and added a little grated ginger to the marinade and also before serving, thickened the marinade with some corn starch and served warm for a dipping sauce.  Even my picky son who hates EVERYTHING but the plainest of foods used the sauce.  I used 6 boneless breasts for 4 people and next time will use 8.  They were cleaned up in a flash and all were asking for more.  I cut the chicken in thick strips, two or three, depending on the size of the breast, and then skewered them in an "s" fashion on the skewers.  Next time, I will marinate longer.  I opened a can of pineapple rings and there was exactly 1 cup of juice in there.  I served the pineapple and made some rice and had a great meal.

I personally think you shouldn't rate a recipe unless you've made it exactly as written.  I made this to the "T" and it was delicious!  Will definitely make this again!

Very good response from family. One can of pineapples yields the cup of juice you need, and the pineapples on the skewer are just the right combo.  I added garlic and ground ginger as others' suggested, and marinated the chicken for 24 hours.  They came out great!  Thanks!

I thought these were great. I threw some spices in the marinade while it simmered, then marinated the chicken for about 3 hours. I skewered it with slices of green pepper, onion, and pineapple, and grilled, then served over rice pilaf. What a great, healthy meal- and SO easy to clean up! I think heating the marinade ingredients really helps meld the flavors and influence the taste.

Loved this one! Took advice from others and marinated over night and added 1 tsp ginger and 2 tsp garlic.  Chicken was tender and juicy!  I'll be making this one again soon.

This sauce is fantastic! The only thing I changed was to add some fresh grated ginger (about a 1/2 inch chunk, grated). I think this is a MUST... it added a real nice mellow ginger flavor. I cannot say enough good things about this sauce. I used half of the sauce to marinate 2 large chicken breasts cut into bite size pieces. I sauteed the chicken pieces in olive oil with diced onion, garlic, and a red pepper. Once the chicken was cooked through, I added pineapple chunks and the other half of the sauce and simmered on low heat for awhile. I served over rice. SO DELICIOUS!

Excellent recipe! I too added vegies to this dish (green pepper, broccoli and onion) which I marinated overnight and added some seasonings and a bit of hot sauce to the mixture. Just make sure you don't marinate the meat and vegetables together. As others, I served this over rice and my gang absolutely loved it! Terrific Hillary!

Wow! These are beautiful and great tasting! I added chunks of bell pepper, pineapple and served with white rice. The only thing I would do different next time is marinate much longer than 30 minutes. Yum!!

Mmm, these were delicious! I followed some of the other reviewers' advice: I marinated most of the day (9-10 hours or so), which I think adds a lot of flavor and juiciness. I used about half the sauce to marinate and thickened the other half with corn starch and drizzled it on top of the finished product. I also added about 1/2 tsp ginger to the marinade, which adds a great flavor. Since I live in an apartment and don't have a grill, I went ahead and fried the chicken in the marinade in a frying pan, with pineapple chunks, which tasted great on top of everything. I served with some curry rice and it was a great meal! My husband kept asking, "When did you learn to make this?!" I think I'll be doing the kabobs for my next party...

This is the first 5* recipe I've given, and it is WELL DESERVED.  Let me just start with the modifications I made.  We used boneless skinless chicken breasts that I pounded flat so they'd cook about as quickly as chicken tenders.  Also, we live in an apt. so no grilling, so we just did it on the stovetop.  I think I only used about 1/3 c. of brown sugar and a little more pineapple juice instead.  It was AMAZING.  The chicken was juicy and flavorful.  I boiled the marinade for a few mins until it had reduced by about 1/3 and poured this over the chicken and a side of white rice and it was just fantastic.  We will definitely use this recipe again and again.  It's so simple and so delicious. Thanks!!

Dang good and dang easy to make. I cooked mine in the oven because we don't have a grill. These were really tasty! I used the left over marinade to make a sauce that we used over the rice. I simply took the extra marinade and added some cornstarch. I will be making these again!

This recipe was terrific and so easy.  I added some garlic to the marinade and seasoned 4 skinless chicken breasts with salt, pepper, onion powder and garlic powder. I poured about half the marinade over chicken and covered tight with foil.  Baked at 400 degrees for about half an hour. Then turned chicken over added remainder of marinade and pineapple over chicken.  Covered tightly and baked for another 20 minutes.  Served with rice.  Absolutely delicious !!!

I made the marinade as directed and then poured it over the chicken tenders in a Pyrex dish and baked at 350 for 30 minutes.  My fiance and I thought it came out great considering it wasn't grilled.  Next time I'll take the advice of others and marinade the chicken longer, probably adding some garlic, ginger and pepper flakes to the mix.  Thanks for another easy chicken recipe!

My husband does not like chicken, so I substituted 3 cubed boneless pork chops instead.  WOW!!  The only other change I made was to add veggies and some pineapple chunks to the skewers, and a little bit of ginger to the marinade.  We didn't have any leftovers, which in and of itself is a rare occurence and a huge testament to the tastiness of this recipe :)  Thanks!!

Wonderful flavor!  I skewered them into kabobs and added red bell pepper and canned pineapple chunks (which was packed in exactly 1 cup of juice)  My whole family loved them, and I've been asked to make them again.

Delicious!  This is so simple and takes only a few ingredients to produce a sweet and tender chicken.  I opted for low sodium soy sauce, brown sugar splenda (cut the amount in half), and fresh pineapple juice.  I didn't bother boiling anything, just threw it all in a ziploc bag and let it marinate for 30 minutes. I skewered the chicken with fresh pinapple and it was fabulous! I must admit the first time I made this I made a huge mistake by marinating this for over two hours because I forgot it in the fridge.  The acid in the pineapple turned the chicken into "paste" - lesson learned....

loved this recipe! the other reviews were very helpful! i boiled the remaining marinade & used it as gravy for rice. definitely used less soy sauce & more brown sugar. Also mixed in mandarin orange juice because i ran out of pineapple juice! marinated it for a few hours & seasoned chicken breasts with black pepper, garlic, & Mrs. Dash right before i broiled them! with my own little twist on it, i renamed it "Tropical Chicken." made it for my husband's birthday & he absolutely loved it!! ENJOY! :-)

These were great! Sometimes I can get a little bored with chicken, but I was pleasantly surprised with these skewers.  Makes for great leftovers too! I served the skewers on top of brown rice and made fresh steamed greens beans.  Heart healthy meal!

Excellent. Even my mother who is not the biggest chicken eater loves this. I did change it a bit though. For one, I did not add soy souce.

After heating the pineapple juice and brown sugar I poured it ontop of the chicken in my 9x13 dish and refrigerated for 90 mins. I then threw the entire dish in the over and baked 30 mins. Baking it with the juices kept it very tender. We did find that the pieces of chicken that we were too full to eat at dinner we ate about an hour later, were even better. The flavor realy absored quite nicely. Delicious. I made them last night and again tonight, with pork chops instead. They were great aswell.

I marinated full chicken breasts in this marinade that I made using Light Soy Sauce and a Tbsp of fresh ground ginger. I marinated the chicken about 5 hours before grilling and then saved the marinade and added the pineapple tidbits to it and served "on the side" with the chicken. YUM!!

This is a great quick recipe!  I used the pineapple juice from a can of  pineapple chunks and added the pineapple chunks to the skewers!  It was so tasty!

Everyone loved these!  I minced a can of pineapple tidbits instead of just juice... very good! Super easy to make and kids loved them, thanks!

very good and easy to make!  i didn't skewer the chicken.  Instead, i just threw everything into a baking dish, including pineapple chunks and chopped green pepper.  it turned out very moist and disappeared so fast!

tasty!  A few changes.  I used breasts, marinated with half the dressing and used that to brush on while cooking.  The other half i poured over the chicken when done.  Next time add corn starch to thicken.  and maybe marinate with less than half so there's more left at the end.

I just made this last night and it was delicious! I added a tsp of ginger and some garlic powder like others mentioned. We had some bad storms come through so I ended up laying them in a 9x13 and baking them at 350 for about 35 minutes - the flavor of the marinade really stands out and is so yummy. We will definitely be doing this again and even trying on different meats!

I felt this made the chicken taste like it was bad; DH said it tasted "okay" but doesn't want it made again.  Not for us, but thanks for the recipe.

This recipe is a favorite.  I double the marinade, and once the chicken is removed I boil it to kill anything in it.    Next add some cornstarch and cook until thickened to a consistency you like.  It makes a great dipping sauce.

Excellent recipe.  Everyone ate these skewers at record speed.  The chicken really took on the flavour of the marinade.  I added chunks of pineapple to the skewers.  I will most certainly be making this one again.

All this recipe needed was some acid.  I added a tablespoon of apple cider vinegar and that did the trick.  It made the chicken super moist and broke down the meat enough that the rest of the ingredients soaked in and had great flavor.

Love this! I added 1/2t of ginger to the marinade.  I only used 1.5lbs of fresh chicken breast, and there was a TON of marinade. Next time I will reserve half of the marinade to use as a sauce for the rice. (I don't like to reuse marinade, even if it's heated to boiling.)

These were excellent.  Marinated for 12 hrs, then grilled with pineapple.  Took the marinade and boiled it for a few minutes and added a tbs of soy sauce to tone down the sweetness a bit.  Then I thickened it up with a bit of cornstarch.  Will definitely make again.

Yummy!  I marinated the chicken for four hours and then I sauteed the chicken tenders on the stove top since the weather didn't cooperate for using the grill.  I dumped the pineapple rings into the leftover marinade and then sauteed them as well...(cook them really well since they were in the same marinade as the raw chicken).  They carmelized up beautifully.  Then I boiled the remaining marinade and put it over rice...the chicken, pineapple and rice together were delicious!

So easy and so delicious!  I added crushed pineapple to the marinade and used Splenda brown sugar blend, and these were great.  I got rave reviews from my party guests.  I will definitely make these for my next party.

I reviewed these earlier this week and had to make some changes because they were dry. I added a teaspoon of canola oil to the mixture and some minced garlic for added flavor. I marinated for 24 hrs and baked them, covered, at 400 for 20 mins. They were juicy and tasted much better than the first time.

This was fine.  But it would definitly benefit from a longer marinating time.  I would also boil down the leftover sauce after you take out the raw meat.  Then serve it as a sauce, it would help it a lot!

A good basic marinade but nothing spectacular.  The pineapple taste is strong even with added garlic powder.  I also added sesame seeds to the marinade & let it marinade for several hours.  My family liked the chicken & it was worth trying.

Very disappointed as I was expecting a more pineapple-y flavor. Although tender and juicy, the chicken tasted more of soy sauce than anything... plus it needed more umph to it. After making this and doing more recipe searches, I found other dishes that are described as Hawaiian Chicken that I will try out next time.

LOVED this! So simple. If you have a few more minutes, add some ginger spice, garlic, and a little lemon juice.
My mom makes something like this with steak, and boils the marinade and serves over pasta, so we did that and it was GREAT!

GREAT recipe; u just need to add some lime juice, garlic, ginger, and sprinkle with black pepper when grilling. Also, grill some pineapple chunks/slices/spears to accompany the chicken.  Works good on fish filets, too!

This was so much better than the usual kabobs we have always done.  The guests at our picnic couldn't get enough!  I marinated vegatables as well, including mushrooms, peppers, pineapple and blanched pearl onions.  It was great!

I'm sorry to say that this was a little bland.  It likey would be much better following the suggestions of others and adding ginger, corn starch and garlic powder to this recipe. Some honey might also be a good addition.  Some of the marinade should have been reserved for basting.

These were okay, a little bland by themselves on the skewers. I'm sure they would have been better with pineapple chunks on the skewers but the actual recipe was lacking.

I marinaded my chicken tenderloins over night expecting some awesome tasting tender chicken. I grilled on my George Foreman-type grill and the marinade stuck to the non-stick surface. The chicken was tender but the flavor just was not there. It was bland and missing something. I don't think I make this recipe again. Sorry.

I made these in January in Minnesota, so grilling wasn't an option.  I will definitely try that one day. My family loved these chicken tenders!  It was so easy to prepare and I'm thinking that the possibilities are endless.  I served these as chicken tenders with rice and stir-fry vegetables.  I would love to try these in kabobs. in a salad, and maybe even in sandwiches.  The only thing I would do differently, as another rater suggested, is to marinate longer.  I will probably do overnight next time.

my family goes nuts for this! if grilling is not an option for you, skewer the chicken as directed. place the skewers on the sides of a baking dish, so the chicken is suspended over the center of the dish and bake @ 350 until done. (20-30 min) grilling tastes better, but the marinade is so good, you can cook the chicken anyway you please and it still tastes awesome!

As a few others have noted, WAY too much soy sauce and not enough pineapple juice.  I added some ginger to the marinade, added green and red peppers to the skewers along with pineapple chunks, marinated for 30 minutes and this was still very bland.  I will not be making this again.  I think the idea of chicken and pineapple is good but this recipe is missing a lot.

OMG! I added 1/2 tsp Ginger & Garlic Powder to the marinade, I cut the chicken up in chunks for Kabobs & put it all in a gal. plastic bag ( 2/3 cup) for at least 4 hours. Skewered chicken and veggies and grilled them up, thickened the remaining marinade w/2 Tblsp cornstarch and served wirh Kabobs. Yes, even the finicky one loved it, especially the sauce. I made a Brown Rice Mushroom Pilaf to go with it. My beloved said it was amazing & virtually no cleanup!

My picky daughter said to give this at least 4 so here it is.  I added fresh ginger and garlic, stir fried the meat in a wok, added corn starch to the marinade and boiled it with the chicken pieces and served over brown rice.  To the sauce I added crushed pineapple, green pepper chunks and onion chunks.  Could have used some red pepper and or carrots for color.

Simple, economical and really good. I marinated a couple hours, then cooked the chicken in a skillet with a little olive oil while boiling the marinade. When it was time to turn down the heat on the marinade, I added the pineapple chunks and a red bell pepper. The chicken came out tender and nicely browned. The flavor was great (I'm not a huge soy sauce fan – it wasn't too overpowering here). Probably serves four if you're making a meal rather than appetizers. Next time I will marinate longer, not add peppers (or maybe go with green), and thicken the marinade with some cornstarch after boiling. Will certainly make again. Thanks for the recipe!

I was looking for a new chicken recipe and this one did the trick. My husband and I really liked it. I marinated the chicken for about an hour, but next time I will tenderize it and marinate for two hours to give it more flavor. I will also reserve some of the marinade to pour over the chicken as it finishes cooking. I made it on the stove top on a griddle and it worked well. It took about 6 minutes on each side over medium-high heat.

This was excellent! I doubled the recipe and added garlic and ginger and then marinated skewered chicken, red, orange, yellow, green bell pepper, onion and pineapple. Put it all on the grill, served with brown rice and used some of the extra marinade as a dipping sauce. Will definitely make again and this sauce would be great for pot stickers, too.

I was somewhat disappointed with this recipe. Based on the high ratings, I thought that it would be really good but it was simply OK. The marinade itself tastes pretty good. But, the flavor just doesn't taste strong enough in the chicken. After reading other reviews, I kept the chicken in the marinade for a whole day, and the flavor was still somewhat weak. This tastes like more of an Asian dish to me, so I lightly seasoned the chicken tenders with salt and pepper, and made some additional marinade and allowed the tenders to to simmer in it until the marinade thickened. I served it over some lo mein noodles and it turned out good enough. If I decide to make this recipe again I won't bother wasting time trying to put the chicken in a marinade because it's pointless as the flavor is very faint. I will probably simply let the chicken simmer in the marinade over the stove as it thickens, then serve it over fried rice. This pretty much defeats the purpose of the recipe I guess, but it creates a relatively easy, somewhat Asian dish. If you are hoping for some amazingly good chicken from following this recipe alone, don't get your hopes too high. The flavoring (while good), is just too faint.

I was disappointed with this recipe as it was rated so highly. I marinated the chicken for 5 hours and still thought the flavor was weak. I added 3 cloves of garlic, green pepper, onion, and pinapple chunks. It was okay, but nothing spectacular like other reviews made it out to be. It would need to be marinated overnight perhaps, or to have some other seasonings to make it worth making again. Not sure if I will bother...

This was a wonderful sauce. I followed the advice of others and added ground ginger. Then, I doubled the recipe, (everything but the chicken,) and let the skewers marinade in the fridge and kept reducing the other half of the sauce, then I used that to baste the chicken on the grill. My picky husband said it was definately a do-over!

Excellent! I used this recipe as a base to make a nice pineapple stir fry.  I cut up 3 chicken breast halves in small cubes, used only 1/3c of brown sugar, added half a green pepper, one onion and half a can of crushed pineapple in juice.  I served this with Asian Coconut Rice from this site and it was fantastic!

Fixed this for dinner and it was wonderful. Did a few things differently to spice it up! First, I added about 2 tsp minced garlic (from a jar) to the marinade for extra flavor. I didn't use light soy sauce cuz I didn't have any. I also reserved about 1/3 cup of the marinade (didn't use it on chicken) and thickened it with cornstarch to use as a basting sauce while grilling. Added some banana peppers, mushrooms and onions to skewers. Really quick, easy and very tasty! We liked it very much. May try on pork or beef next time. Don't forget to soak wooden skewers in water for 20 mins while meat is marinating!

very good, I added about a tablespoon of fresh ginger to this and doubled the marinade.  I find that most marinades are very similar and this one is no exception...it's not spectacularly different in any way, but very good and worth making.  A good basic marinade that most everyone will like.  We had a cookout and made some with this marinade, some with the chicken bacon kabob marinade and some with the sensational sirloin kabob marinade.  All three were good and not very different.  Out of the three, my favorite was the chicken bacon kabob because the bacon kept the chicken moist.  However, not everyone likes bacon with their chicken, so I was glad I made some with this marinade as well, plus I liked the ginger accent in this one.

My cooking has a reputation, but it's not a good one.  How wonderful did I feel when I threw together this recipe and received a million compliments from five kids (ages 5-16) and my husband!  He was so proud of me :-)  Many, many thanks!

The chicken was pretty good, but be very careful when grilling, the brown sugar burns easily.

When do you add the pineapple juice?  Does it go on with the soy and brown sugar? or do you marinate the meat in the pineapple juice first?  Help.

What's not to love!  Three ingredients- pineapple juice, soy sauce and brown sugar.  My kids DEVOURED this!  We brined our chicken first for about an hour in a gallon ziplock, poured out the brine, rinsed the chicken, and then poured the marinade into the same bag and let it sit for about two hours in the fridge.  Juicy, flavorful and delicious.  Thank you for sharing HJR.
Here's the brine recipe- 4 cups of water, 1/2 cup kosher salt, 1/4 cup sugar

SOOOO good!!!  We made the marinade, mixed half with the chicken (a little over a lb) and reserved the other half.  We cooked the chicken on the grill and with the left over marinade we made a sauce by boiling with a little cornstarch slurry and 3 chopped garlic cloves.  We served the chicken over white rice and pineapple chunks with the sauce on top.  It was amazing and we will make again!!

Heavier on the soy flavor than I thought. I used cubed chicken thighs and a pineapple mix drink as I don't like the canned pineapple and didn't want to waste the only (large) pineapple juice can I could find. Marinated green peppers and mushrooms. They turned out pretty well, as did the pearl onions that I cooked in the leftover sauce. I marinated the chicken and veggies separately and used the sauce from the veggies to cook the onions.

thought these were very tasty kinda sweet... I did add some apple juice and garlic salt after reading the reviews, I think it did add some yum factor to it. I also used pinapple and green pepper to my skews while grilling.

I doubled this recipe thinking I would have leftovers. NOT!!!!!  My family gobbled up 20 chicken tenders.  These are perfect.  I also made up the marinade and put some flour in it to thicken to drizzle over the cooked chicken.  FABULOUS recipe.

Pretty good. It was just a little bit too sweet so next time I think I'll use a little less brown sugar. I'll also let the marinade cool next time before I put the chicken in it. I think it kind of cooked the chicken when I poured it and prevented some of the marinade from soaking in.

Simple and tasty! I added a dash of ground ginger and reduced the amount of soy sauce a tad. A small can of chunk pineapple yielded perfect amount of juice. However, I used all this on only 1.5 lbs of chicken tenders (not 2, as recipe states).  I broiled skewers on a lightly oiled, foil-covered broiler pan in the oven instead of cooking over the grill. I let them cook 6-7 minutes per side. I placed the pineapple chunks between skewers when I flipped the skewers over and served those with the chicken and a rice dish with raisins, saffron, and vegetables. Delicious!

This was a very good base marinade.  I would suggest marinating for longer than 30 minutes.  I also added a bit of garlic powder and will add more next time.  I used pineapple juice that came with pineapple chunks.  Next I added bits of the pineapple and red pepper to the skewers.  It was a nice touch and went well with the chicken.  Overall, a good recipe and will make again.

Super Good! I will definitely make these again. I used chicken breasts cut into strips and marinated the strips for a few hours.  Besides that I followed the recipe exactly. I also boiled the marinade and used as a dipping sauce.

Super tasty marinade....let it marinade all day in the fridge and it tasted terriffic.  I also put some marinade on the pineapple chunks and let that sit all day (in a separate container) and it added a nice kick to the fruit once it was grilled.  YUM!!

So so sooo good and so easy. I  threw small chicken breasts in the marinade frozen and left them for about 6 hours in the fridge.  I reserved a bit of the marinade (before adding the raw chicken) to baste the chicken with as it grilled.   My kids aren't big chicken eaters so for the 5 of us I made 7 small breasts.  There was only 1 left over!!  They are ready to have this again very soon.

Made this yesterday for a Memorial Day cookout.  Followed recipe, but marinaded for about 3 hours.  I made extra marinade and thickened with corn starch for a dipping sauce (did not use any that had the chicken in it)  Today we ate the leftovers using  whole wheat flour tortillas as a wrap, topped with  the marinade and  shredded Mexican blend cheese.  They were delicious!!  Did not warm the chicken, but did warm the marinade slightly and the tortills.  Will definately make this again!!

Loved this.  Turned out great, and my husband loved it too (neat trick.)  My modifications:  During the saucepan phase, I used all the juice from a can of crushed pineapple (setting the pineapple itself aside to add later), and added a dash or so of crushed red pepper.    Marinaded as suggested in the original recipe.  Then, because I don't have a grill, I heated up a teaspoon or so of olive oil in a big skillet, threw the chicken in there, and added the leftover pineapple.  Stirfried it all together, and served it over salad greens with a nice Chardonnay.  Absolutely wonderful.  Thanks for the great recipe!

My husband and I thought this was great!  We marinated some chicken breasts and then grilled them with some pineapple slices and made Hawaiian chicken sandwiches (chicken, pineapple, lettuce, tomato, provolone cheese, zesty bread & butter pickles, and light mayo on sandwich thins instead of buns) - delicious!

Delicious! Very easy marinade, and the chicken had wonderful flavor. I was happy that it did not have an overwhelming pineapple taste, the flavors of the marinade blended great together. I didn't feel like bothering with skewers so I just used chicken breasts that I cut in half, to make them thinner. I marinated these for 8 hours, but before marinating, I reserved some of the pineapple mixture to serve with the chicken. You don't really need this since  the chicken is so moist and delicious on its own, but I just really enjoy having the extra sauce to dip everything in. Fantastic and easy and I will definately be making this over and over again.

Excellent!  I wish I could give it more than 5 stars.  Follwed the recipe and would not change a thing.  I could not BBQ so I put in under the broiler, and I made kabobs with Pepper, onion and fresh pineapple.  it was great!

We all liked this alot.  As per the previous reviewer I did chicken skewers and vegetable skewers (peppers, onions and pineapple) and served over rice.  I also kept back some of the marinade and served over the rice.  Yummy.  Also, the weather turned ugly so I ended up cooking this under the broiler.  A keeper for sure.

This is a keeper, only made a couple small changes.  Swapped honey for brown sugar (can't eat sugar), included some pepper to the marinade and added pineapple chunks to the skewers with the chicken.  Made a couple veggie skewers and rice to accompany the chicken.  Great meal.  Boyfriend suggested making a glaze of the marinade next time, to brush over the skewers while cooking..would be great.

I have made this several times.  It has become a family favorite.  I have used splenda brown sugar to cut back on a few calories.  I have made with both chicken kabobs and just chicken breasts if I have less time.  We love it!!!!

Great recipe! The marinade was so easy to put together, and the chicken turned out nice & tender. We used the marinating time to cook some rice & saute some vegetables, and it all made for a tasty & inexpensive dinner.

I followed this recipe exactly (may not have made a whole 2lb chicken, though, only three of us), and it turned out great.  I put chunks of red and green peppers as well as pineapple on the skewers to add some veggies.  I thickened the sauce with a little cornstarch and used it to dip the chicken, or to mix in with the rice I made to accompany.  Serving with the rice and veggies made a good meal.  My husband definitely wants it again!

I fixed this last night and it came out great. I did leave it on the grill a bit to long so be sure to take it off after 10 minutes or cut into one of the pieces to check for doneness.

Great taste, easy to make. I cooked the chicken in a skillet and servd with fried rice. I boiled the marinate and  it and added corn starch and some diced pinapples for a sauce.  it came out really good.I think next time I will add a little garlic and chile powder.

I can't comment on this recipe because I didn't have any but my family said it was quite good. I used whole chicken breasts instead of tenders and baked it in the oven. I baked it with the marinade and then I made extra marinade, added a tbsp of cornstarch and cooked it on the stove to thicken and then added pineapple chunks and served it over white rice. My husband said he would like to have it again soon so it must have been good.

This was good.  Did chicken tenders in GF Grill which speeded things up.  I also sauted some onion and green pepper, added some pineapple and served it over rice.  I doubled sauce and thickened with cornstarch.  I think some cashews would be a good addition.

I love this recipe.  I have used this at least three times in the past month!

I usually add garlic to the recipe and a hawaiian soy sauce called Shoyu instead of soy sauce.

This was very good except my grill wasn't very hot so I had to cook it for awhile and it came out a little dry. I made this with additional skewers of red and green bell peppers and pineapple chunks. Nice light meal with some French bread toasted on the grill. Cut up leftover chicken, pineapple and peppers and mix with mayo for a wonderful chicken salad the next day. It's so good I'll be sure and make extra next time just for that purpose!

I marinated for about 1 hour and put chicken on a kabob with pinapple, red and yellow bell peppers and onion. Then, I poured the rest of the marinade over the skewers while grilling. These were absolutely delicious! My boyfriend said they were as good if not better than Whole Foods.

I have a few questions to those who have made this already.  (These are from a new cook..I'm still learning.) :)
1) If you put the chicken in a baking dish and bake it in the oven with the sauce, is it okay to use this sauce again to put over rice? 
2) If you bake it in the oven with the sauce, how long, and at what temp? 
3) If you grill it with veggies on the skewers as well, can you marinate the veggies and chicken on the stick together in the same sauce?
Thanks for your tips! I don't want to get salmonella poisoning. :

This was so simple and delicious.  I made a couple of changes.  I like a thicker marinade so I added 1 tablespoon of cornstarch.  As others suggested I added 1/2 tsp of ginger and 1 tsp of garlic powder.  I don't know if it needed it, but I liked it, so I'll do it again.  It made a lot of marinade so I set a little aside to be used as a sauce for white rice.  You won't be disappointed with this one.

This was excellent! We did what others did and added a few things to the marinade; garlic, ginger and some mirin (tasty stuff!).  We cooked the skewers on our George Foreman grill, which turned out good because the marinade carmelized nicely.

Enjoyed it very much.  I have made it several times.  The only time I put everything on skewers was the first time; since then I have broiled it in the oven usually with chunks of red peppers and onions in addition to the pineapple.  It is delicious!  Kids and adults in my home love it.  I usually serve it with rice.

Really a great recipe...Another way you can add a flare to it is by cooking a pineapple slice on top of it toward the end of the grilling. Also, a little honey added to the sauce tastes pretty good too.  :*)

My whole family LOVED this recipe.  I chose to do it a little differently, I used chicken breast halves and marinated them in the sauce for 24 hours.  Then we grilled them.  DELICIOUS!

Phenomenal!  I put pineapple chunks directly on the skewers between the chicken.  Kids love to put the kabobs together, but make sure they use extra care in handling raw chicken.

Love this recipe. We cook for the week once a week and friends come by to grab the leftovers. No leftovers on this one! Served it with sauteed pineapples and onions over rice.

This recipe was so yummy and was a big hit at the house.  The only thing I did different was add some stir fry veggies, but did not marinate the chicken with the veggies.  I served with white rice.  I think this has become a favorite among the family.  Oh, and leftovers were fantastic in quesadillas the next day.

My kids loved it. Made the marinade as listed but was a bit sweet for me so I added a 1/2 tsp of cayenne pepper to balance the sweetness. Perfect. Served with quartered yams cooked on the grill.

This recipe is amazing for those of us who are looking for a low-calorie snack or lunch. It' impossible to find a well proportioned and decent low-calorie lunch; at least I thought it was until I came across these. I actually tweaked the recipe a little to suit my taste, instead of a 1/3 cup of light soy sauce, I added a 1/4 cup of white vinegar and two tbs of lime juice, only to add a bit of a tangy flavor. You may want to try that out, it's good.

We really liked this!  Used chicken tenders and added 1 tsp. of ground ginger and 2 tsp. of garlic powder as suggested and cooked in skillet sprayed with Pam for 5 minutes on each side. Definitely will make again.

Add marinated pineapple chunks to the skewers for extra flavor. Also add sherry to the marinade in equal proportion to the soy. I eliminate the brown sugar and skip the cooking process before marinating the chicken.
Also, as was served by Jolly Ox restaurant in Seattle, this is even better as a main dish: Marinate chicken, then cook in the marinade in a pan on top of the stove. When just cooked (don't let it get dry), place chicken tenders in baking dish (or individual baking dishes), pour any remaining marinade over chicken, top with pineapple rings, chopped green onion including tops, slced fresh mushrooms and top with slices of provolone cheese. Bake at 350 until cheese is melted.

Always looking for something new and exciting with chicken, so the 4 1/2 stars enticed me to try this.  It was just "ok".  Nothing spectacular.  Was easy and had everything on hand.  Kids weren't wowed, which admittedly, is a tough sell.  On to the next recipe....

As written, there is too much soy sauce.  For one cup of pineapple juice I used half cup brown sugar and cut the soy sauce to 2 tablespoons.

These are soooooo incredible!  My whole family ate these very quickly.  The only thing I changed was adding 2 tsp. garlic powder and 1 tsp. of ginger to the marinade.  I also put the pineapple on the skewers with the chicken.  Just the right combination of salty and sweet!  Thanks so much for the recipe.

As written, this recipe needs more flavor.  Next time I'll add minced garlic and maybe ginger too.  Instead of buying pineapple juice, will use a 20 oz. can of pineapple chunks - which yields about 1 cup of pineapple juice and thread the pineapple chunks along with the chicken strips.  The marinade would work as is, if the cooked chicken tenders were offered with a dipping sauce that complimented the flavor.

These were SO GOOD! My husband hates anything that tastes like Pineapple, so I made him a seperate batch with no pineapple. But I made him try one of mine, and he hate almost every one!!! They were so good. I even ended up broiling them in the oven because I got home, and realized I didnt have coals! They were still amazing!

Very tasty marinade!  I added a big clove of garlic, minced. I made enough sauce for 1 big breast, which I cut in bite-size pieces, marinated for almost an hr., next time a couple hrs.  Next time I'll make more sauce to add to rice.  I slightly drained the chicken from the marinade and placed in frying pan w/oil, cooked for maybe 8 minutes.  Chicken was sooo tender!

Excellent flavor on the marinade. I added some garlic powder to it and marinaded for about 4 hours or so.  The flavor was very pronounced in the chicken and everyone loved it. I used chicken breasts and grilled them instead of tenderloins.

I had a few extra things on hand, so I threw a little garlic, ginger, lime juice, and sesame oil into the marinade, then after marinating, placed the chicken on the Foreman grill for two minutes and thirty seconds. I boiled and reduced the marinade, and it made a great sauce! I served this with diced mango and kiwi, sprinkled with a little triple sec. Thanks for the keeper!

Used this for my Luau Birthday party and everyone gobbled them up! The chicken skewers are easy to grill, eat, and clean up!They were delicious, but it needs a little something. Will add ginger and garlic next time. Also, I'll definitely try the other people's recommendation of boiling the marinade (to clear of it any salmonella), adding corn starch to thicken, and use as a dipping sauce!

The recipe is a good starting point, but like other reviewers, I felt the need to add more flavor w/ spices. I added 1/2 tsp garlic powder and 1/4 tsp ground ginger to the marinade. I broiled the tenders only b/c I was too lazy to start up the grill, and boiled the remaining marinade for a dipping sauce. It was very good!!

My husband, daughter (age 21), and son (age 13) loved these pork chops. I didn't bake them though, I put them on the grill and basted them with the marinade. They were delicious!! My son is rather picky and he said they were AWESOME!! I will definately try them in the oven when the Summer months are over.

This was really good! next time I would put fresh pinapple on the skewer along with the chickin.  I agree with some other reviewers in that I am skeptcial about reusing marinade, even after boiling, so I just doubled the recipe and used half to marinade and half for the sauce (thickening with corn starch) - delicious

This recipe was EXCELLENT, it deserves 5 stars for the taste and the time to make it. What an easy dinner and my entire family loved it! My husband hates fruit with his meat and I served this with grilled pineapple and doubled the marinade and used half to make a sauce with a little corn starch and he said it was the best chicken he has had. Wow! Thanks for an amazing recipe and a new family favorite!

The sauce really is SO GOOD. It's got the whole salty, sweet, and a hint of sour going for it. Needless to say, this is an absolute winner. I skewered the chicken with chunks of pineapple and it seemed to give it more of a tang to it.

I added three minced garlic cloves and sesame seeds to the marinade.  I cut the chicken into chunks and marinaded for three hours.  The BBQ chicken skewers  were delicious and tender.  I added pepper, onion and pineapple chunks to the skewers and served on rice.  Delicious!!

This was an easy recipe to make but I was thinking it would have had a stronger flavor of the pineapple taste. I had let the chicken sit for a day in the sauce and thought the flavor was going to be great but next time I make it I will try to double the pineapple juice to see if that helps. Made as kabobs over brown rice.

These came out way to sweet. I marinaded overnight and maybe that was the problem. It just tasted like sweet chicken. Couldnt taste the soy or pineapple for that matter.I may attempt this again and just marinade for a few hrs. Just ok.

Delicious! I didnt want to do the grill for just two of us so I made it on the stove.  Used a little less soy sauce. I marinated for an hour and then dumped it all into the wok.  Served it over white rice with some of the sauce and pineapple chunks.  It was absolutely delicious!

This was delicious!! Only problem I had was the brown sugar started to burn a little on some of the tenders so be careful not to let them cook on one side to long. But I added a little garlic powder to the marinade also and made extra marinade on the side and put it on the rice. I used a can of whole pineapple slices (juice came to exactly one cup) and grilled the slices too (love em!) and finely chopped the other slices to put in the sauce for the rice!

This was pretty good - but not great. Too much soy for my taste - so I added more Pineapple juice. Also added the Pineapple chunks to the skewers. The chicken was a bit dry but went well with the Pineapple.

My kids loved it! It was almost a homemade teriyaki sauce. . . I cooked it stovetop, in my big frying pan, and poured most of teh sauce in the pan with the chicken. Came out super-flavorful. Definite repeat, as my kids would say!

Wonderful!!! I used on larger chicken and grilled the chicken on my George Foreman grill, then thickened up the leftover sauce with a bit of cornstarch and served it over the chicken. Saved leftover sauce for another chicken night! Could even mix in w/hamburger and make a teriaki burger w/pineapple on top.

It was fine, but nothing that great. I added a clove of fresh minced garlic and marinated for two hours...but I think it probably needed to marinate for most of the day. Great on the grill though and the kids liked it since the flavor was so subtle

Pretty good. I baked in my oven at 325 degrees for 35- 40 minutes (Frozen). I put a little pineapple juice on the bottom of the pan. I also put a can of pineapple tidbits on top. Next time I think I will try doubling the marinade.

These get a "yummmm" from my husband each time.  I actually use turkey instead of chicken and it works great! Soaking the skewers before helps them not burn on the BBQ.  I'd also suggest cooking them on the top rack so they get a more even cook.

Easy, Easy, Easy!!  My kids loved this dish.  I did however use Splenda Brown Sugar Blend instead of the regular brown sugar.  I also threw some pineapple on the grill too and Mmmmmm, VERY Good.  My kids loved it too!

My granddaughter loved this dish. Everybody did.I cooked mine in a frying pan. I put some marinade aside before plunging the chicken in to add to the pan for extra liquid. I never heated up a marinade before. I had a can of pineapple slices but it didn't have enough juice.I had a can of mandarin oranges on hand so I added some of that. I did include the pineapple to the pan at the end. Wish I had more chicken :)

This dish worked out so well for my housewarming that I had a few weeks ago - everyone was looking for more chicken as well as the recipe! These tenders are so good and not heavy! Awesome job on the recipe!!!

Fantastic recipe. Delicious, easy and fast to cook. I too, thickened the marinade with a little cornstarch while cooking the chicken in a pan, and added 1/2 tsp of grated ginger and 1/2 tsp of minced ginger. Love this one. Thank you so much for posting.

I absolutely loved this recipe.  I'm a beginner cook and this was so easy to make.  I only marinated the chicken for an hour and that seemed to be enough.  I added pineapple pieces to the kabobs and it was great!  This is a wonderful and easy recipe!!!

These were great! Wasn't able to grill so I broiled instead. I used the pinapple juice from a can of pineapple chunks and then made jasmine rice and added the pineapple to this and served the chicken over the top. The kids loved it!

Quick to prepare and tasted delicious.  I marinated strips a couple hours (added a couple shakes of red pepper flakes) and cooked them on my George Foreman.  Served with our local take-out's fried rice and some steamed broccoli.

Outstanding recipe because of the taste and simplicity. I couldn't believe it came together so quickly. I ended up cooking the package of chicken tenders in the sauce and added pineapple chunks at the end. The chicken was so tender and virtually fell apart. The kids even ate this and didn't complain.

Excellent!  I did add just a couple of things to this to perk it up a bit. 2 T seasame oil, 2 minced cloves garlic and 1/4 t ground ginger.  Loved it!

I marinated 3 kinds of meat using 3 different recipes. I did the Asian Beef Skeewers, Basil Shrimp and this recipe. All the receipes were marinated over night. All the receipes were really tasty and everyone loved them but every one agreed this one was the best. The only change i made was i used a can of crushed pineapple and the juice of one canned pineapples instead of a cup of pineapple juice. Someone mentioned in a previous review that it tasted like teriyaki. When i tasted the marinade i thought the marinade tasted like teriyaki but when it was cooked on the grill it had a great pineapple flavor to it. It may have been due to the fact that marinated for more then 24 hours. This recipe is very simple, quick and tasty

Outstanding & easy.  I used canned pineapple rings and brushed some of the marinade on them as well.  Grilled chicken and rings together, tossed a salad and I was good to go!  Great flavor and FAST!  Very adaptable to turkey breast and veggies.

Superb! I used Kerns Mango-Pineapple juice blend since I like that flavor.  Also as others recommended, I added some garlic (minced) and ginger (powdered) to the marinade.  Great flavor, though my kids still ate the chicken with ketchup - well, no surprise since they put ketchup on everything but ice cream!

This recipe got rave reviews from our Book Club Barbeque!  For me, I enjoyed how simple and easy it was to prepare.  We actually broiled them, because we had no propane, and they were still delicious! For them, one woman asked how it was made, another asked for it to be emailed to her and three others had seconds.  Definitely 5 star!

Definitely a hit with my family. I don’t have a BBQ so I broiled them instead after I baked them. You don’t get that grill taste but even without it my family has asked me to make them again! First dinner in a while I didn’t have to fight kids to eat it! They also had a lot of fun eating it off the skewers. Great meal for kids in my opinion!

No changes. Served it with skewers of red peppers, fresh pineapple chunks, baby yellow potatoes & thinly sliced onion. Delicious and no leftovers.

I made this as directed & enjoyed it. However, my husband did not. He could not pinpoint what it was that he did not like. As a result, I can’t modify it. I just have to try something all together different.

The whole family agreed that this recipe was very bland.  Only thing I did different was add ginger as so many recommended.  I skewered it with fresh pineapple and glad I did--the pineapple was the best part of the meal.

My whole family loved it but personally I thought it was okay, maybe next time I will use a little  less soy sauce and brown sugar and a little more pineapple juice. I used a stove top pan to cook mine.

Loved this recipe! Just a tip ( I found out the hard way) Soak the skewers in water first! I added chunks of pineapple in between the chicken Delicious!! The only thing I might change is less sugar, not that it was sweet but I try not to have unnecessary sugar. Would Definitely recommend this recipe

I loved this. I followed Zakkie's recommendations and added ginger and garlic. I also make some skewers with mango, pineapple, red pepper and red onion on them, and brushed with marinade before grilling. I then boiled and thickened the marinade, and served on the side. We had it with wild rice. Awesome!

Okay, I really veered from following directions because of lack of time and ingredients. I lightly sprayed my frying pan with Olive oil, and browned the chicken tenders on both sides. I found left-over chucks of pineapple with a bit of juice in the frig,  so I added that to the chicken. I didn't have soy sauce so I squirted Bragg's liquid aminos and brown sugar, apple cider and rum over the chicken tenders. I boiled it down till lightly caramelized and barely thickened it with water and corn starch. I served it with a roasted sweet potato and okra pan seared.

I've modified this to create soy/teriyaki pineapple marinated chicken breast dinner instead of an appetizer. Takes more than 10 minutes to cook but tastes great grilled, baked, or cooked in a pan/skillet. Marinate for 2 hours max. If you want to swap soy for teriyaki, it's the same quantity/ a 1:1 soy:teriyaki ratio but feel free to modify depending on your taste.

We made this with chicken tenders as the recipe says to, and it turned out pretty good.  I wouldn't recommend trying with regular breast, as I'd imagine it'd be too dry.

Super awesome recipe!! We placed thinly sliced pineapple rounds on top of the skewered chicken tenders as they grilled. We found that this both kept the chicken sweetly marinated and kept it from burning in the hot spots of the grill. Was awesome. We will definitely make this again!

I did add 1 tsp ginger, and I used a can of crushed pineapple and added half of the crushed pineapple to the marinade. I also used a can of chunk pineapple for the juice (saved the chunks to use another day on cottage cheese)and make a second batch of marinade and the other half of the crushed pineapple,then thickened it with some corn starch because my kids think everything is better with sauce :-). served with rice and steamed broccoli for a great dinner. PS I did marinade the chicken for about 3-4 hours.

Delish! The chicken tenders were very moist and a great flavor, yum! I added a splash or two of sesame oil to give it an Asian cuisine flavor, and a sprinkle of Goya seasoning, definitely a meal planner keeper. Thanks so much for the recipe!

THIS WAS PERFECT, my grill ended up breaking AND I got a late start on this meal. So, instead of cooling the chicken for 30 minutes and grilling it.. I ended up just cooking the chicken in a pan on the stove and when it was almost done I poured the sauce mixture in, with the pineapples for roughly an extra 10 minutes on a light simmer. HOLY COW, it was perfect!

Slightly Modified...I followed ZAKKIE's recommendation & added generous tsp. of ginger, 2 tsp. of garlic powder and also added 1/4 c. water mixed with 3/4 Tbsp. corn starch to slightly thicken, adding a little more sugar, a little more ginger etc. AND about 8-10 drops of Louisiana hot sauce to fine tune taste and this was de-li-cious! I saved about a 1/4 of the mixture rather than using all in marinade (marinade 30 mins.) and let the remainder continue warming gently on the stove once I started cooking the chicken - which by the way I didn't skewer, just cut thinly sliced skinless chicken breasts into 3 or 4 inch long strips - also added long strips of red bell pepper for additional taste - I boiled broccoli for about 5 mins. until slightly tender then drained water and added at very end to chicken/pepper mixture with a tad of additional sauce - not too much, don't want it swimming, just flavoured (which was already warming on the side) & let flavors blend about another 5 mins.,(do not cover so not to steam/overcook broccoli) served on rice (which I made with chicken broth instead of water) and poured teeny bit of remainder of sauce on top of all to individual preference!  YUM YUM enjoy:)

I've been making this recipe for a while and it's always really good. I use a little less sugar (1/4 cup for every 2/3 cup pineapple juice) and I add a little garlic powder, black pepper and ground ginger. I marinate at least 18 hours and I don't bother to heat the marinade. It's also really good on pork chops with grilled pineapple rings on top.

I must say I was disappointed in this---I really thought it would be amazingly flavorful, I even marinated for over 3 hrs. It smelled great but just didn't impart much flavor to the meat. Because our family likes white and dark meat, I marinated tenderloins and thighs ( hard to have bad thighs....). Neither had the amount of flavor I was expecting, just OK. I appreciate the recipe being submitted, wish I had better results.

Just had this for dinner and wanted to review it because it was so delicious and light...and realized I did it wrong!  I didn't heat up marinade! but did let chicken sit in marinade for couple of hours and only used a little over a pound of chicken tenderloins. Made rice pilaf to go along with it...while I grilled chicken I grilled can of pineapple chunks, an orange pepper, and a jalapeno and added it to rice with a splash of the pineapple juice from canned pineapple.  Was delicious!! No leftovers!!

My wife and I had this tonight. And found that it was one of those dishes we just wanted to eat and eat and eat, It was really really good,
I had added just a teaspoon of ground ginger and it gave it a sweet bite to it, Also took the rest of the marinade added alittle corn starch, and made a delightful gravy for tators and also put some over the chicken, And yum yum, We also took the pineapple rings and cooked them in the same pan I cooked the chicken breast in, and made them taste wonderful. One last thing, when you cut the pineapples up and take a bite of them and the chicken at the same time, You talkin about an experience, Something we will definitely have again, I call it, " THE HAWAIIAN DELIGHT"

This is outstanding!  Even my 5 year old gobbled it up without a complaint!  I took the advice of others, and added 1/2 tsp ground ginger, and 2 tsp of jarred garlic. The marinade is worth saving and boiling to serve over the white rice! It's super yummy!

I love this recipe.  I not only make it with the chicken, but I also will just make a batch and chill it for later use a steak marinade or dipping veggies!  It's delicious just the way it is!

I thought these tasted fine, but what surprised me was the taste of the pineapple in the chicken was very distinct. I almost couldn't much taste the chicken. I made 1/2 recipe and got 4 skewers. I only had thin chicken breasts and used those.  I soaked the wooden skewers in water while the chicken was marinating. I thought they tasted kind of dry to. I am guessing, because the marinade doesn't have any oil. They would have been much better with a sauce and with the distinct taste they really need Hawaiin themed sides or something similar to go with it.

I really liked this dish! It is so easy to make, healthy and it tastes good. I followed other suggestions and added garlic and fresh ginger, and it was wonderful. I only gave this 4 stars as opposed to 5 because I believe it needed more marinating time, 30 minutes was not long enough. If you can let it marinate over night, if not then 2 hours. Other then that, wonderful, easy recipe.

4.5 Stars: I used both boneless skinless breasts and tenderloins and both were very good.  I marinated overnight and grilled.  You definitely need to keep some sauce aside or make more for basting and plating.

These are really easy to make and even easier to grill because they don't take very long to cook.  I marinated them for 8hrs.  They were really sweet with a light pineapple flavor.  I was hoping for a teriyaki flavor, but could barely even taste the soy sauce.

Delicious!  I  used whole chicken breasts and saved the remaining marinade.  I boiled it out (very important, as other users  noted), then added one diced green pepper and a diced onion.  I then added the marinade/pepper/onion to plain white rice and made it our side.  Basically I was too lazy to do skewers, but I wanted the peppers and onions.  Also served with a side of fresh pineapple.

This was great!!! I scaled the recipe down to 5 servings, and marinated 4 chicken breasts for about 4 hours...then grilled them and served them with a salad. The chicken was so flavorful, and didn't take long to make...so I'm definitely keeping this recipe!

Made this yesterday for a cookout.  Followed another's review and added the ginger and garlic powder.  It was a huge hit.  I was throwing these things on the grill up until the last person left.  (Good thing I marinated plenty).

All I had was a can of pineapple chunks.  I blended that in the food processor with the soy sauce and sugar and used that as the marinade.   Marinaded for two hours.  Chicken was delicious and very tender.

If I made these again I would add more pineapple juice and less soy sauce.  The soy sauce was overpowering and masked all of the other flavors.  This recipe wasn't bad, but it also wasn't memorable.

I thought this was great chicken. I usually don't like sweeter foods but the chicken thighs had great sweet flavor without being coated in a sticky sauce. Used as a marinade and grilled, made the recipe exactly as written. Thanks very much for sharing.

Super kid friendly! My kids loved this.  I also added orange & red bell peppers.  Marinated for several hours but would marinate overnight next time. I served this with spinach salad.

Taste was very good.  I let mine marinate for about 4 hours or so in the sauce.  Unfortunately not as much flavor on the chicken as I would have liked---despite brushing them during cooking with the marinate.  I'll definitely make this again.

Wonderful! Such a great marinade for chicken. I also grilled up pineapple slices and served with some brown rice. The leftovers were perfect in "Microwave Fried Rice" from this site. Thank you- will definitely use this again and again!

This recipe turned out okay. It was very sweet if that makes sense! I just eyeballed the ingredients and boiled them, put it over the chicken then i put the pieces of pineapple from the can over it as well to refrigerate, then i fried it all on a pan. I cut the chicken into bit size pieces instead of putting them on a skewer. It was good enough that I'd make it again sometime.

This dish was good but nothing special.  However, it is very simple meal to prepare.  The chicken marinated for the recommended minimum of about 30 minutes.  If I make it again I will try marinating it longer to see if it adds some flavor!

I marinated the chicken and then forgot that we had dinner plans, so they marinated for over 24 hours.  I thought it turned out really tasty and I'll marinate them for at least overnight again.  It gave the chicken really good flavor.  Definitely using this recipe again.

Very easy and simple.. next time I will save some marinade to boil down and use as sauce since some of the chicken seemed a little dry from grilling, but otherwise great flavor!

I was excited to make these, because I had pineapple chicken at a friends and it is soooooo good. I followed the directions but not sure if I marinated for the full 30 minutes because the kids were starving. I baked them in the oven, I think if I make them on the grill and marinate longer they will be as good as my friends. Will be making these again!! Thanks

Awesome recipe! I halved the sauce the first time and the next time I made it exactly as it states because it was so delish!! I added fresh pineapple chunks to the skewers and boiled the extra marinade down to use as a dipping sauce. I served it with rice and the broccoli with garlic butter and cashews recipe from this site. It's a family fave now.

This was really good.  The chicken wasn't as moist as I thought it was be, but still yummy.  I boiled the left over marinade and it was fantastic.  It made a lot of sauce, so the next day I stir fried onion, carrots, peppers and broccoli.  I diced up the left over chicken and poured the sauce over it and served over rice.  I like this better than the original chicken.  I'll make more sauce next time, it was the best part.

Excellent marinade.  We prefer dark meat of chicken, so used boneless thighs and baked in marinade instead of using the grill. We were pleased enough to use again in the same manner.

I did breasts for this recipe instead. I marinaded it just like required but left some aside. I grilled the breast on the grill and basted them the whole time they were on the grill with the extra sauce ... Fabulous taste and very moist and tender!

Awesome! I marinated them and then sauteed them in a frying pan and served them over rice. I reduced the marinade to a thick sauce and served that over them. DELICIOUS!! (Make sure the marinade comes to a full boil for a few minutes before serving.)

My family loved this! I used the juice from a can of pineapple rings, and I also added a little bit of worchestershire sauce.  I only marinated them for about 45 minutes and they were plenty flavorful.  I put on skewers with onions and served with rice and mixed veggies.  This recipe is a keeper!

My husband and I really enjoyed this recipe.  I let the chicken marinate overnight and set aside some of the sauce to pour over the chicken after it was done. (Set it aside before placing it on the raw chicken).  I also marinated some green pepper, red pepper, and onion in the sauce and placed those on skewers and grilled them up too.  Made some rice to go along with it, nice healthy and light dinner!

It definitely needed to marinate longer than the 30 minutes stated in the recipe. I used fresh pineapple and guessed at the ingredients. It turned out very well. Make sure the chicken is even thickness so it doesn't dry up. Threw the chicken with the marinade in a frying pan and cooked it up. Added extra pineapple while cooking. Served over rice. Very good although I will try some variations next time.

I used boneless chicken leg cut into cubes to serve as a bite sized hors-d'oeuvre for a party. I marinated the chicken overnight. The marinade tenderized the chicken nicely. Instead of grilling it, I just cooked it in a skillet. The sauce caramelized nicely on the chicken. I boiled the extra marinade until reduced to a thick sauce, which I served on the side. My boyfriend and I liked it. I'd make it again and serve it on rice.

Usually I don't review a recipe when I make changes, but this was so good and easy.

I used less brown sugar than the recipe called for and added ginger and garlic as others have suggested.  

As I was assembling my kabobs, it started downpouring outside, so instead of grilling, I cooked the chicken on the stovetop and added the marinade a little at a time (used just a portion).  I threw in pineapple, green pepper and red onion and served over brown rice.  

It was delicious!

This is a very quick and simple recipe, however, requires a long marinade time to absorb the flavor. I made a little extra marinade and poured it over some white rice. I did not thicken the sauce with corn starch like others suggested and just served it hot. I usually do not like Soy Sauce, however, the mixture of pineapple juice and brown sugar made it taste very good.

Rain prevented me from grilling outdoors, so I cooked the chicken in the marinade, with some fresh pineapple chunks and green peppers in a skillet, with the lid on for about 12 minutes. It was moist, sweet and delicious!!

These were really good for a quick dinner and as leftovers cold for lunch the next day.  My husband said it reminded him of his favorite breaded, sweet and sour, chinese dish, but much healthier.  I also cooked these in the marinade in the oven as others had suggested.  Very good.  Thanks.

Simple and delicious!  I added garlic powder and
ginger, and ended up marinating chicken breasts for
a couple of days.  Thread pineapple and colorful chunks
of peppers on the skewers with the chicken and serve on
a bed of rice cooked in chicken broth for a complete meal.

This was terrific! This chicken is a great summertime choice, especially for the grill. We served it with fresh grilled pineapple wedges. It was great! Thank You!

These were pretty good. I grilled them on the George Foreman grill. When I marinated the chicken, I included a few pineapple slices as well. This might have increased the pineapple flavor which was yummy.

Not very flavorable.  There was something missing from this recipe.  Maybe some garlic or something would have given the chicken more flavor.  I am going to try again though...

This was good. I let it marinade overnight and the marinade taste was moderate. I will be using this recipe again as it is a nice change of pace.

Wonderful!  I loved this recipe.  Took it to a party, and everyone raved about it.  I added a bit of fresh minced ginger to the last batch, and it gave it a bit more kick.  Definitely a keeper.

I used boneless chicken breast and they came out fantastic! I also used canned pineapple rings and grilled them up and served them with the chicken...
I also used shrimp, and cooked them on the grill. 
My kids are the worst to feed, they ate all of it with no problems.. :0)
It really is an excellent recipe!

This was a very tasty way to have chicken! They were very easy to prepare and cook up on the grill.  Had a few leftover and they were very tasty the next day.  Served it with rice, salad and ice tea and it was a great meal!

This was a great marinade, but I was pinched for time so I just put them on the grill. Don't leave unattended as they do cook very fast. Very Tasty!

I make this exactly as written and it's delicious - a family favorite that we have often. The nice thing about fixing it as written is that there are so few ingredients you need to have on hand. If you're looking for a quick, easy, delicious chicken dish, this is it. Love it!

This was amazing! I cooked the meat as instructed and added white rice, dry coleslaw, with snap peas. I made a sauce to pour on top with pineapple chunks, soy sauce, and siracha. It was a perfect blend of sweet and spicy. Definitely adding this to the dinner rotation.

Love this recipe I doubled it and marinated chicken thighs overnight. I also didn’t have pineapple juice so I used a can of crushed pineapple (it was the only thing I had on hand)

I should’ve let it marinate longer and I didn’t use brown sugar, so my fault.

Loved this simple recipe. I let the chicken sit in the marinade for 30 min, but feel like it wasn't quite enough te for my liking. I will remake, but allow it to sit in marinade for 2-3 hours and serve alongside some yummy coconut rice & grilled pineapple. Super excited to try it again!

Great Dish!  Wife said "Add it to the rotation!"  Cooked the chicken in a skillet came out just fine.  For a bit more sauce, just add a bit of the soaking sauce and it cooked down nicely.

I did not make any changes to the recipe. My husband and I could not believe how moist, tender and juicy, the chicken turned out. I did, however, use whole chicken tenderloins on the grill instead of kabobbing them. Just make a rice/veggie side dish. Def gonna make it again!

This was really good. My whole family liked it.  We made sandwiches with them topped with mayo, and also ate them as tenders with a mayo dipping sauce. 
The only change I made was to buy chicken that had a 5 day expiration date so they wouldn’t spoil and left the tenders in the marinade for 3 days before grilling. Fantastic flavor!  Next time I’ll prob sprinkle a bit if Adolph’s meat tenderizer on them minutes before grilling.

I've made this several times just as written and it is very good. My family also likes it! This was the first time grilling anything on a skewer so I was a little anxious but kept checking the temp with thermometer. The more I make it the better it gets! Now I have ended up adding some teriyaki marinade along with the soy sauce, a few drips of sesame oil and a little extra ground ginger. Love this recipe!

I made this exactly like the recipe and it was great!  My 15-year old son loved it also.  I made a little extra marinade and used it  with rice and veggies.  It made a great stir-fried rice side dish to go with the grilled chicken!

Skewered these babies with red pepper, onion, and pineapple. Broiled on high in the oven, basting all the while, and flipping then removing at the first sign of charred edges.

Definitely add the garlic and ginger as per other recommendations.

So I did change it and it was fab.
I had a whole Pineapple I needed to use. So I chopped up some and add it to my pot. Put it on low/med heat. Add half of an chopped onion, About a Tbsp of Molasses , and a Tbsp of coconut Sugar, salt and pepper and powder garlic to taste. I heated it up for about 5 to 8 mins and then took a potato smasher and smashed it:->
Let it cool for a little while. Added chicken. Let it marinate for 30 mins. Put them on some screwer and then BBQ. After they where on the BBQ for about 4 to 5 mins on each side,  then put foil down and placed chicken on foil, dumped left over sauce and allow to cook for 5 to 8 mins in juices. Wait till it boils and the pineapple is cooked. EAT!

I had high hopes for the marinade, smelled delicious, but after 3 hours of chicken marinating, it didn't stick to the chicken like I thought it would. The sugar in the marinade burnt on the grill grates, so it should be cooked on medium low heat. It was ok, Just not as good as the reviewers made it out to be.

I also used the pineapple chunks and threaded them on the skewers with the chicken, in my case I used skinless chicken breasts cubed.  It was a nice meal served with Chef John's Classic macaroni salad.

Made this last weekend and really liked it.  Thinking next time may add some red pepper flakes to it.  Also, will make some "fresh" marinade and baste it while cooking.  DO NOT use the marinade you've already soaked your chicken in.  I hear that's not good and could make you sick.  Love this recipe though!!

I made these last night and they were very good. I made it according to the recipe, but next time I will add some minced garlic and a little salt. I used low sodium soy sauce, but I still could not taste a lot of salt at all. My husband liked them very much. I'll make these again.

I made this for a holiday picnic. I made this into kabobs with vegetables instead of tenders. The recipe was easy to make. I marinated the chicken overnight. I grilled the kabobs per the recipe and everyone raved about them. This is a keeper.

Instead of chicken tenders, I used chicken breasts and cut them into chunks. I added ginger like others suggested and marinated the chicken along with pineapple chunks and bell pepper. My family really liked the flavor, and even the kids who don't like pineapple ate it all!

Horribly bland and I followed the recipe exactly, which I normally do first time around. Will not be making this again. Can't see throwing the chicken away so will either cut up to put in a salad or dip it in some teri sauce. I don't ordinarily write reviews, but had to say something about this one, sorry!

It was ok.  My husband thought it tasted off but I think he was reacting to the pineapple juice.  My picky eater ate 7 skewers. I'll take that as a win but will work to make the sauce more interested.  Maybe orange juice?

Sorry, but we didn't like this at all! It was very bland, even after adding ginger and garlic to the marinade. I marinated it for three hours then pan fried it. It had an odd aftertaste, probably from the pineapple juice (try using chunks perhaps?) and just wasn't very good. With some tweaking it could be good, but as is, not terribly appetizing.

I have made this recipe countless times for fish, chicken, and steak.  I like to double the sauce, boil it and add cornstarch to thicken it up. I marinate using half of the sauce and save the other sauce to add after cooking.  Its great over veggies and rice too.

Made it tonight, my family loved it, tweaked it a little, I didn't have brown sugar, i substituted it with pomegranate molasses , added a little of Worcestershire sauce , mustard powder, ginger powder and garlic powder to the marinate,
for the sauce I made the same as the marinate but also added some corn starch, paprika, Cayenne pepper and sliced green onions at  end.

These were awesome.  I added some onion and garlic powder and as it was late in the evening, I cooked these in a skillet with a little bit of EVOO.  Delicious, will make this again.

I made this and cooked the chicken on the forman grill. The sauce dried out right into the meat so it really didn't have a good saucy taste to it. It just tasted like cooked chicken. I don't think I will make this one again.

I made this for dinner tonight. I marinated this over night and there still wasn't very much flavor. I like pineapple and soy together but this sauce just wasn't very good.

chicken tasted very plain; I am not sure if this can be attributed to user error or to the fact that I'm not too big of a chicken fan to begin with. I will see whether or not my significant other likes it, but otherwise I do not plan on making this again unless the chicken can marinate for a significantly longer time

I made this but used thinly sliced chicken breast meat.  It was delicious.

I made it again for a big potluck barbecue and 5 pounds of chicken was eaten as soon as the feast began.

Great taste. Easy to make ..   I seen few nagitive  feed backs.  Never save the marinade after using  expecially  chicken marinade, other said gave chicken a bad taste.  Needless to say it's a tropical marinade.   Excellent  recipe

It's pretty much a lighter flavored teriyaki. Not bad but they don't have a ton of flavor.

booooring  I marinated my tenders for 12 hours, and the extra time did not help.  maybe adding some ginger or garlic, or both might have made a difference.

Yummy marinade!  The only thing I did differently was to bake the chicken strips in the oven at 400 degrees for about 20 minutes instead of using the BBQ.

I added 3 Tbsp of jalapeño juice to the marinade and wow! What a great pop!  Hot and sweet flavor.  Made HV Ranch dressing for a dipping sauce and served with green peppers, onion, and chunked pineapple skewers.  I love the ease of this recipe.

I found this too Bland, will not make again, will try other recipes for
the chicken marinade, and still use the pineapple chunks along with red
peppers and onion .

I Cooked in the skillet and at last couple minutes added cornstarch to thicken marinade (cooked chicken in marinade) and some chunks of fresh pineapple. I also added fresh grated ginger and garlic x 2 cloves. Served chicken over bed of greens and drizzled marinade over to wilt it and used as a dressing. This is wonderful!!!!

I thought the marinade was really tasty, but I didn't cook the chicken on a grill like the recipe called for. I flattened the chicken breasts and cut into strips before marinating.  To cook, I simply tossed the chicken pieces in a wok with a bit of the marinade and let it cook.  Served it over rice.  Delicious!  

To get more of a pineapple flavor, I paired it with mcdavis8784's recipe for Asian Pineapple Sauce.  Drizzled the pineapple sauce over the rice and chicken and it turned out great!

Easy and Yummy.  I did add a clove of mashed garlic and a bit of grated fresh ginger.  Marinated overnight.  Had a really nice pineapple/Asian flavor.  Would make it the same way again.

We all loved this recipe but I made some changes to suit our taste and to make cooking easier.  First I halved the recipe to serve 5 people. 
I used the following recipe for the Sauce:
1/2 C. Pineapple Juice drained from 1 can of crushed Pineapple Setting the Drained Pineapple aside for later.
1/4 C. Packed Brown Sugar
   2  T. Gluten Free Soy Sauce
I kept the preparation for the sauce the same.

To Cook the Chicken I used a large Iron Skillet, added approx. 6 Boneless, Skinless Chicken Strips and seared them on both sides, added the Sauce mixture and placed the reserved Crushed Pineapple on top of the Chicken strips and put the lid on and reduced the flame to Simmer for a total of 45 minutes, after the first 15 minutes I turned the Chicken Strips over dumping the pineapple into the sauce in the pan and put the lid back on and simmered for another 15 minutes, then turned the chicken one last time for the remaining 15 minutes.  I served this with Brown Basmati Rice and small frozen whole Green Beans mixed colors bell peppers.

It was a hit with all three of us and will be our new regular dish to serve.  Thank you so much for the recipe!  love, love, loved it!!!!

GREAT recipe! I made it exactly as it called for, and it turned out so well. My only recommendation (and it's a slightly big one) is to marinade it all day. The first time, I just marinaded it for the recommended 30 minutes, and we hardly tasted the marinade at all. The second time, I marinaded it for about 8-10 hours, and it came out perfectly. Also, when we grilled the chicken, it took about 20-30 minutes total, but we always cook our meat longer than the recommended time, so.

Made exactly as written. Chicken tasted good and was juicy.  Use medium heat or you will burn your chicken because of all the sugar in the marinade. No complaints.  I think additions of ginger and garlic would add a bit more flavor.

Not bad, but also not enough pineapple flavor for it to be called "Pineapple Chicken Tenders." Possibly something I'll try again, but next time I'll implement some of the suggestions from the other reviews.

i'm always one for anything pineapple but this needed something. I did try it again but I didn't have any pineapple juice so tried it with orange instead as well as I also took up someone else advice and tossed in some garlic powder. Tasted far better.

I made the recipe just as it is posted, and it was delicious! Great flavor! Thanks for sharing.
It's a keeper.  However, I will use metal skewers the next time due to the fact that some of the wood burned, even though I soaked them for an hour.

Made this tonight for Father's Day and it was a big hit. Delicious! My husband and kids loved it and when my picky Dad came by for dessert, he tried one. Even he loved it! I followed the recipe exactly except for the fact that I marinated the chicken for 8 hours. Served it with black beans and white rice. Thanks for a great recipe!

Delicious!  Serve these as an appetizer and the family devoured them!  So easy to make.  I let the marinade cool at least 30 min before adding the chicken.  For an added bonus, boil the remaining marinade; mix 1 T cornstarch with 1/2 c. Cold water and slowly stir into marinade to thicken.  Serve as a dipping sauce.

I could swear that there are pineapple chunks between the chicken pieces - that's the way I made it anyway. But recipe doesn't indicate pineapple chunks. 

Give it a try with pineapple chunks and chicken - great for light dinner or appy!

I looked through the reviews and decided to try it. I doubled up on the marinade, adding a tsp of ginger and a tsp of garlic as some reviews had suggested. I used half the sauce for the marinade and the other half to put over the rice. I cooked my chicken in chunks in a frying pan and heated the leftover marinade with the pineapple chunks I got the juice from. Put it over some rice and was good to go. It came out pretty tasty, I would make it again. I will probably marinate the chicken longer next time. I had it in the fridge for an hour.

This is absolutley one of, if not the best, chicken marinade I've tried....Things that I done a little different was I added yellow prepard mustard to the mix, and then wrapped the chicken with bacon....Place on the grill, and cook...Warning....May cause your tongue to beat your brains out....Delicious...

I followed the recipe exactly (except allowed the chicken to marinate for 3 hours). Very bland. I cooked down the extremely thin marinade to use for a dipping sauce, but even that couldn't save this recipe.

Tried this last night with chicken breast fillets. After reading other reviews, I added some garlic and ginger, also boiled the marinade to make a sauce. Was very bland, did nothing for me taste-wise.

Super easy and yummy!  I actually stir-fried mine with the sauce (chicken first).  Then I stir-fried some veggies from a frozen asian mix and combined it with the chicken and sauce.  I added chunks of pineapple the last 5 mins.  My picky toddler ate every morsel and she's been on a hunger strike!

Made this one day when my mother was cooking fried chicken for my stepdad and brother and didn't feel like eating that. It's easy to make and doesn't take extremely long. Smells and tastes great, and ingredients are common things so you probably wont have to run to the store to try this out.

This wasn't salty enough. If I make this again, I would use regular Soy Sauce, or just salt it as I was grilling it. I think that is all it needed. I served this will Healthy Fried Rice.

Despite my Hubby burning these on the grill, they were still good. I stopped by the gas station to grab some pineapple juice, but all they had was a pineapple-peach-mango juice, so I used that. I think it made it sweeter than the original recipe calls for.

Great recipe....easy and tasty, marinated chicken strips overnight and skewered the next day. Loved the sweet from the brown sugar and the pineapple. Very child friendly, all the kids and the adults loved this one at our holiday BBQ.

I agree very tasty, and like everyone else, I added garlic and cornstarch to make the sauce nice and thick.

Simple and delicious! It was too hot to grill out, but I used someone else's recommendation and simmered the chicken in the marinade with pineapple chunks. Very good!

Yummy! Definitely will make this again. Will marinate longer next time with a little less soy sauce. Leftovers had great flavor.

Very good, extremely easy, and quick grilled chicken recipe.  My husband and son raved.  I enjoyed this, and will prepare it again.  It didn't blow me away, but I would definitely recommend you try this as it was very family friendly.  I served it with stir fried veggies over a bed of rice.

Juicy, but not much flavor.  I was going to give it another try using the suggestion of adding garlic & ginger, but my husband said not to bother.  I'd hope those additions would make it more pleasing if someone wants to try.

used on chicken breast and was great.  Added garlic cloves and lime plus cornstarch to thicken it.

I made this in a double batch and froze them on the skewers.  Next time I will freeze them not on skewers it is quicker to stir fry than grill after a long day.

These are wonderful as they are; don't change a thing! I made these along with other kabob recipes from this site (Yummy Honey Chicken, Asian Beef Skewers, Mushroom Kabobs) for a big potluck this summer. They were definitely a crowd pleaser. Thanks!

I marinated the chicken strips for about an hour and added pineapple chucks to the skewers. Has a nice taste, but other than the pineapple taste, not a whole lot different from a teriyaki marinade. Would be great to serve over a bed of rice.

This was good but I'm not sure I will make again unless I alter it a little.  Needs a little kick to it.  Cayenne and or/black pepper.
