I've made these twice.  The first time I inadvertantly used baking soda instead of baking powder and they were great!!!! 5 stars!!  The second time, I corrected the error and used baking powder.  The results were not as nice.  They weren't as chewy and I found them to be drier, still tasted good, but definitely not 5 stars like the last batch.

These cookies were delicious. I added an extra tablespoon or so of brown sugar and used 1 teaspoon of OJ because I didn't have any orange extract. The flavor was good, but a little lacking, so I made an orange glaze (powdered sugar, orange juice, and cinnamon) which added exactly what was missing. They got rave reviews from all of my guests.

Just made these and they are a perfectly wonderful cookie. The spice and orange are subtle and not overwhelming at all. Really great with a cup of tea.
I used quick oats instead of rolled oats as it is what I had on hand so I cannot tell you how the cookies are with the rolled oats. I do know that the quick oats performed perfectly in the recipe.

These are so good! Please note this is not a overly sweet cookie.  It is nicely spiced, soft and chewy from the oats and craisins (what I used) with a little crunch from the nuts with a slight orange boost. Tastes like Autumn in one little bite. We love them and will prepare them again soon. Thanks for sharing!

Love. Love. LOVED this! I didn't find this dry in the least. Instead there were lovely, chewy and I adored the flavour. I didn't have any orange extract on hand, so I used 1 Tbsp of orange juice and 1 tsp of orange marmalade to ensure I got the orange flavour. Also, I halved this to test the recipe, hence the scaled down recipe called for 1/4 cup of brown and white sugar each. However, I skipped the white sugar completely and used only 1/4 cup of brown sugar. I ensured that the butter and sugar was beaten very very well before addng in the egg. After which I let it beat for atleast over 2-3 minutes, and then added the extracts (vanilla, OJ, marmalade) , once again beating well. I didn't use the machine to add in the flour / oats / cranberries / walnuts so that the dough wouldn't be over worked. I got 25 lovely cookies from this, although it took me 18 minutes to bake these (and they weren't dry in the least). Oh also, I ran out of pumpkin pie spice, so I used Scotdog's personal recipe for Pumpkin Pie Spice called 'Kelly's Pumpkin Pie Spice' which was simply wonderful. (I've reviewed it too). This cookie definitely beats the normal oat and raisin cookies .... a lovely new find and a fast favourite! Thanks ramie7224 for sharing this recipe with us! :D

These are awesome.  Doubled the amount of orange extract, used half a cup of the cranberries and half a cup of raisins.  I had to cook these about 12-14 minutes to get the "browned edges" effect, but it could just be my oven.  Made them for poker night and they were demolished.

Delicious! I did not have orange extract so I left that out.  I also substituted 1/2 of the butter for pumpkin puree to save some calories and add an extra element of "fall" and they turned out really well.

I rated this recipe 5 stars because: 1) its an excellent blend of flavors and textures, and 2) its VERY customizable.  I just made it with some alterations, which turned out GREAT and made the recipe even healthier:
1/2 C Splenda instead of white sugar (still used brown sugar)
0.5 C butter, 0.5 C canned pumpkin
1 C all-purpose flour, 0.5 C whole wheat flour
1.5 C rolled oats, 1 C quick oats
Baking soda instead of baking powder
Added 1.5 Tbsp flaxseed meal
Used Craisins instead of plain cranberries
   After 10-11 min at 350, the cookies turned out thick, moist and chewy, with a very slight Splenda aftertaste (next time I may use Stevia, or less Splenda and some white sugar) but I'm the only one who noticed the Splenda taste.  The Craisins are perfect--make sure you get a lot in each cookie!

I'd give these 5 stars for flavor and 4 stars for texture. I agree with other reviewers that they are slightly dry - not in a bad way at all, I just prefer cookies like this to be a bit chewier and 'melt in your mouth'. To compensate I undercooked them, but maybe next time I'll take others' advice and use baking soda. They are really delicious, and I will definitely make them again!

I've made these cookies several times now. A definite keeper. I don't have orange extract, so I used a fresh orange and squeezed a teaspoon of juice and a teaspoon of grated zest. Gives them a nice subtle orange flavor. I also used a full cup of walnuts. I went with the suggestion to use baking soda rather than powder and they came out deliciously soft and chewy. One time I drizzled them with melted white chocolate and the next time with a powdered sugar/orange juice/cinnamon glaze. Fabulous either way.

These were exactly what I was craving! Very delicious! My roommates and I are enjoying them a lot. I used apple pie spice instead of pumpkin pie spice because that is what I had and they turned out great! I will probably have to make a new batch in a couple days...these are going fast!

These cookies were really good!  I normally don't like things with orange flavor in them however, I really love these.  Next time, we will add some chocolate chips.  Will make again!

This recipe was fantastic!  The perfect recipe for a fall treat! I made this for a women's only gathering although my husband and kids loved them also. I had to make a couple changes for dietary reasons. I made them with gluten free flour.  I also substituted xylitol for the white sugar, and substitued 1/2 cup pureed pumpkin for 1/2 the butter, then added two more tablespoons of butter.  Usually gluten free can be dry but these were very moist.  They were a tad bit cake like because of the substitution of the flour.  I know that these substitutions can change a lot but I wanted to hopefully help someone who was wondering about making these gluten free and lower glycemic.  Go for it-they will not disappoint! These had the perfect sweetness to them and are great with coffee!!  I will be making again and again.  Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe!

These didn't spread out at all.  I ended up with tiny little round cookies.  My husband really loved them, so I will probably make them again.  I though that they were a little on the dry side, but tasted good.

I have made this cookies a few times now always around this time of year. They are one of our favorite!  I made them a bit smaller this time they I usually do and ended up with 3 dozen cookies.  Plenty enough to share!  Everyone just loved them.  They are quite festive looking as well. I’ll be making these again and again.

Husband who is the cookie expert said this is 5 stars!  Followed the recipe exactly except I didn't have orange extract so just doubled the vanilla.  Used a little old fashioned oats (all I had) but mostly quick oats.  Not super sweet but that works for me!

Good cookie, but definitely a cookie for an adult pallet. It is somewhat bitter with the cranberries which was good but the cookie itself was not sweet enough for my guests. I myself enjoyed the cookie but was outvoted. If I tried this recipe again I might add more sugar or consider an sweet orange icing to zip it up.

These were incredible.  I added both baking powder and salt.  Also, didn't have the orange called for by the recipe, so added orange juice and followed another reviewer's tip to make a glaze from powdered sugar and orange juice and cinnamon.  These embodied the taste of fall.  So yummy!

Yum!  These are really good!  Very sweet, probably from the cranberries, bc in the scheme of things that's not that much sugar in cookies.  I made larger cookies so didnt' get a huge amount, but they are packed with flavor and heft from all the ingredients.  They spread a bit, but not a lot, so you don't have to worry if you like your cookies not to be flat.  Thanks for the recipe!

Just took out my 1st batch of Autumn Harvest Cookies and they are yummy!! Can't wait to share them with the girls at work.  I also used baking soda instead of baking powder.  I personally love the hint of orange but I think next time i'll add a little orange zest too just for fun.  In the directions it says to use just a teaspoon of dough but I used a tablespoon and it still just took 10 minutes in my oven.  I'll be making these all season long!!

Delicious little cookie gems! Cooking them for exactly 10 minutes was perfect for me, or even a bit longer. These are a great way to use up dried cranberries without a sugar overload. They're so yummy with a small glass of milk!

The orange flavor stands out in this recipe and it was a nice change from the typical oatmeal cookie. Nice flavored cookie, but a little on the dry side.

These were good.  We liked the orange flavor.  My husband can't eat cranberries because of a medication so I made half with cranberries and half with raisins.  I think I like the cranberries better but both were good.

These were pretty good.  A tad dry.  I didn't really taste the orange too much so I think next time I'll add a little more.  Also, I only used a 1/2 cup cranberries, and then a 1/2 cup raisins.

loved this cookie!  used baking soda instead and cookie was crisp on the edges and chewy in the middle.  didn't have orange extract but used grand marnier instead and it was fine.  maybe next time i will use orange zest.  chunky, hardy and delicious!

These are very good cookies.  I too changed the baking powder to baking soda, just because other reviews said they were dry, and it worked out great.  I will make these again, much better than plan oatmeal. I also didn't put in as much orange flavor and put in a little more vanilla.

Let’s get one thing straight: Autumn is the purest most joyous time of year in the American heartland. The colors, smells, and changing landscape signal necessary death to nourish new life. Any recipe claiming to capture the essence of this most magical time MUST be scrutinized with good intention and a critical eye. With that said, I very much enjoyed the subtle flare of this spice blend and rich texture, ramie7224. The aroma coming from my oven as these baked to golden perfection was nearly identical to that of my own Grandma’s marshmallow cinnamon yam autumn dumplings. A treat our home will never forget. RIP grandma Jo.

These cookies are good but I would be sure to store the extra in an airtight container.

I made bars instead of cookies. Really makes a great breakfast bar but I did full vanilla extract no orange and only 2/3 cup of dried cranberries I soaked in hot water and dried after squeezing out the excess water lightly with a cloth or cheesecloth. I also added 2/3 coconut. I live in a high altitude area so I adjusted dry ingredients appropriately for my area.  Baked it in a 11 by 9 pan with no stick spray. Baked it until golden brown.

Didn't add walnuts,  used 2 tsp OJ instead of orange extract.  The cookies were good (OK).  Nobody in the family wants me to make them again though.

These cookies have lots of flavor and didn’t take a lot of time to make.  I added a banana just because I had to use it before it went bad.  The banana and orange extract seem to complement each other.  Now I have a new fall cookie recipe.  Thanks.

Made these cookies exactly as stated in the recipe. I had used a similar recipe in the past with much better results. These cookies did not flatten at all and they are extremely dry. The flavor is very good but I can't get past the dryness of the cookie. I will

To ensure adequate sweetness, pack down the half cup of brown sugar.
