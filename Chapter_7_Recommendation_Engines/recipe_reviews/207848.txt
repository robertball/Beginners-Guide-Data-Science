(I used chickpeas instead of pinto beans and started with salted and roasted sunflower seeds in the food processor instead of tahini.) This hummous has an awesome taste. It was a nice compliment with warm, cilantro and lemon flavored rice. Very delicious.

I made this recipe after sampling some at a store. I have never had hummus before this. I must admit, this is fantastic!!! Even my picky toddlers loved it!    I followed the recipe almost exact, I added an extra clove of garlic and a little extra olive oil to give it a creamier texture. Also, I made sure to scrape out all of the garlic and oil out of the pan with the zucchini.    Definitely try this, it is very good!

Wonderfully tasty!  I used 3 garlic cloves and 3 T. tahini, as others suggested, and drizzled in some more olive oil at the end, and also substituted chick peas for the pintos.

Too much cumin for the amount of beans and zucchini!  I think that if the cumin were cut in 1/2 and added with possibly another herb, this might really be good.  I had high hopes for this, and will try to adjust it to my liking.  I like the idea of zucchini in a hummus mixture!

This makes a really nice light fluffy hummus!  Also a great way to use up left-over grilled zucchini!  I used chic peas instead of pinto beans and added 5 tbsp of the chic pea liquid to make it really creamy.

This is a good hummus for those 'eating for your type' I have used Black Eyed Peas also.

I love this recipe.  I'll make it again and again.  I used chickpeas instead of pinto beans.  We have an abundance of yellow squash from the garden this year and I think I'll try it with that.

Yum - great with pinto beans also great with white beans! When I made it with pinto beans it looked more like authentic hummus...  This recipe is in my hummus/bean dip rotation.  We eat hummus a lot - like adult peanut butter.   Thank you for posting, Chef!

Our family loved this.  My son (12) doesn't like store-bought hummus, but he really likes this.  It tastes fresh and so creamy.  We ran out of lemon juice after a Tbl. and added lime juics for the 2nd Tbl.  Yum

After reading others' comments I tweaked by adding an extra garlic clove. Even then I wanted more & added an extra raw pressed clove to the food processor. Also HEAPED the spoonfulls of tahini & cumin. Yummy & easy.

i love the smooth, almost creamy texture the zucchini gives the hummus! i used about 1/3 of a giant zucchini, having used the rest for the zucchini blueberry muffins on this site. i added more garlic per other reviews, and the only other addition was a generous splash of balsamic vinaigrette -- unusual perhaps, but i always add it to whatever type of hummus i make for an extra kick. yum!

Very tasty!  I followed the recipe other than adding more garlic and zucchini (I added 2).  This is a really fun twist on the normal hummus!  The pinto beans really made this unique, I definitely recommend trying it with the pinto beans the first time!  Also, with any hummus, it is so much better the next day!  If you can make it a day ahead of time, it is well worth the wait!!

I thought this was really bland. I brought it to a 4th of July cookout and those that tried it left it on their plate after one bite. I won't be making it again. I couldn't taste much zuchhini flavor.

Really really good.  Made as the recipe called for (except just used one large zucchini and one whole can of garbanzo beans), wouldn't change a thing.

Very tasty and quick--I ramped up the garlic to 3 cloves plus about 2 tsps of garlic powder and reduced the salt to about 1/8 tsp.

AMAZING! I was tasked with using a zucchini.  This was perfect and received incredibly high marks from everyone.  It was gone in a flash! I used 3 cloves of garlic but followed the recipe otherwise.  Kudos to Wendy for sharing this recipe!

Very delicious!  I had to make a couple of changes. I didn't have any pinto beans so I used kidney beans instead. I also added a tablespoon of sesame seeds, because I didn't have any tahini. And to spice it up a bit I added red pepper flakes, and I used smoked paprika. I also added some flax seed just because I'm trying to get it into my diet more. Loved it so much I added it to my recipe box!!

Overpowering zucchini flavor.  Us less zucchini, and this would be OK, but not great.

With less cumin, garbanzo beans instead of pinto beans, and a little fresh parsley, this is a five star recipe!

I think this recipe should use chic peas instead of pinto beans.
