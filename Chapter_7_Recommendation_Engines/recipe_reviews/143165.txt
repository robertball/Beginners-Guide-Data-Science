Wow - were these ever good!  I LOVE chorizo sausage plus given these weren't your typical run of the mill breakfast burritos I had to give these a try. I was definitely not disappointed.  I added a little bit of smoked paprika along with the chili powder and used light cream cheese.  You could definitely add some Mexican blend cheese or Cheddar if you like - when it comes to cheese and eggs wrapped in a tortilla the more the better!  You just can't go wrong here.  Thanks for a great recipe Seattle Dad!

These are delicious! My mother started making these when we lived in New Mexico and we still make them here in Maryland! Instead of using sausage my mom uses bacon, and i use scrapple. Either way it just depends on what kind of meat you like. Also we make tons of these at a time and wrap them in tin foil and freeze them. Its great for kids to just pop in the microwave. Also you may have a problem finding green chili, i know we do in Maryland, but it is a must, DO NOT substitute, we order ours online.

This was delicious!  I made several changes.  I used only 5-6 potatoes and increased the eggs to 8.  I also used red salsa instead of green.  The recipe made about 7 burritos.  We'll definitely do these for brunch again!

This was great, Seattle Dad! I used 4 good sized organic red potatoes, ground california chili pepper (you get the full flavor of the chili powder without a ton of heat), 3 full eggs and 4 egg whites and light cream cheese. My kids were on the fence about it but both my husband and I thought this was GREAT! I think next time instead of cream cheese, I'll use mexican cheese or shredded monterey jack but that's not a reflection of the recipe. Just a personal choice.

These burritos are delicious! For those of you complaining about the calorie content, just simply don't make them I don't know why you have to make such a big deal over a recipe! Thanks Seattle Dad for a terrific recipe. It's nice to splurge once in awhile!!!

I skipped the potatoes to reduce the carbs.  Great remedy for a late night out.  For more heat pass the hot sauce. I substituted flour tortillas and covered in a cheesy sauce.

The original recipe as written definitely has a high fat and calorie content, but being both more health conscious AND a lover of Mexican/New Mexican food, I used it as a starting point and tweaked it to our dietary needs. First, I used only 1 medium sized Yukon Gold potato (they are the lowest in carbs), and used egg substitute to cut fat and cholesterol. I use either veggie chorizo or ground chicken chorizo, depending on what's available, which is similar in flavor and texture, but is so much lower in fat and calories. I skipped the cream cheese, because we don't care for the texture and substitute monterey jack or queso fresco. Finally, I use "fajita size" tortillas, in place of burrito sized, because we just don't want that large of a meal. I admit, it's not the original recipe I've described, but, it's quite tasty with the replacements, and I don't feel guilty about about enjoying one of these!

These are yummy. Never tried it with cream cheese before!  In the past, we've made these when camping and used pepper jack cheese instead. Garden fresh diced tomatoes are great in these, too! If you use smaller tortillas, and add more chorizo, it's enough to feed a group of hungry campers!  I hate to admit this, but an icy cold beer goes great with these, even if it is morning!  Try a bloody mary w/ a chaser!  YUM!

Delicious! Used a carton of egg substitute and light cream cheese.  Everything else was spot on to the recipe (including green salsa-yum!) and I wouldn't change a thing.

Yummy and easy to make to your liking.  I use bacon instead of chorizo and tossed in fresh chopped tomatoes at the very end of cooking time.  So good

Unfortunatly I forgot to buy chorizo at the store, which I know would have made this recipe even tastier.  However, even without the chorizo it was awesome!  I did use a little less chili pepper because I got the full throttle hottest green salsa on the market.  I also added store bough corn relish.  I think this was better than food truck vendors for sure!

These were good, but found them to be lacking a little something. Easy & cheap to make, and the kids gobbled them up. I did add chopped onions when I cooked the potatoes and topped the mixture with a mexican cheese blend when served in the tortilla. Next time I will add some corn and maybe serve with some sour cream on top... it was just missing "something". Thanks for the starter recipe though!

I thought this was only ok. Good, certainly but not overly flavorful. Made it exactly. Kids liked them well enough. Sautéed bell peppers and onions would be nice additions.

I have not tried this recipe, but on certain weekends I get together with friends and we do a breakfast club; sort of a Saturday Brunch, I am always tasked with the chorizo and fried potato burritos, I use 3 medium russet potato's and a pound and a half of pork chorizo; I live in Arizona and the sausage I get from a little Mexican lady that makes it fresh at home; she learned the recipe from her mom many years ago, it is a little drive, but the chorizos is so fresh! My dad got it from her mom and I am carrying on the tradition. Pity the fool who gets their chorizo from a store. By the way my 12 inch flour tortillas are made at a restaurant called Carolina's and they are still warm when I pick them up!!!!!! The rating is for my burritos not this imitation Mexican ffod
