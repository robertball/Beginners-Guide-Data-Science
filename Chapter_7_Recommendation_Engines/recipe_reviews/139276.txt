I'm picky about quinoa recipes, and I thought this one was excellent. I made a few minor changes based on personal preference: I cooked the onions and the mushrooms longer (I let the mushrooms simmer for about 10 additional minutes with the lid off to reduce the sauce), used more spinach, subbed veg broth for chicken, and omitted the cheese. This was delicious and flavorful, and I didn't find the wine flavor to be too strong at all (maybe it's the type of wine I used, sauvignon blanc). A definite keeper!

I am a big fan of quinoa and am always looking for new recipes, but I'll definitely make this one again.  The mushrooms, wine and balsamic vinegar give this dish a dark rich color and flavor.  I made a few substitutions to meet my own tastes:  I substituted the chicken broth for vegetarian, added roasted red peppers and used feta rather than goat's cheese.  I also think that half bag of spinach is more than enough.  Very good.

This was really good.  For lack of time I made some changes to the original recipe.  I did not have mushrooms or much time so I made the recipe a "one step" by sauteing the onion and garlic in the oil, then I added the spinach (all I had was frozen), then the quinoa.  I then added all of the liquid ingredients and thyme (all I had was dried). I also didn't have any goat cheese or other crumbled cheese for that matter, so left the cheese off all together.  This was our first time to have quinoa and it was great.  The kids loved it!  Even the one that doesn't like spinach loved it and had seconds!  It was a great side dish with our dinner of talapia and fruit.  Thanks for the recipe, will definitely make again!

I came across this recipe while poking around the site.  We'd never even heard of Quinoa before.  I went out, picked some up and made this for lunch.  Absolutely amazing - can't wait to make it for my mother-in-law who's vegetarian and I'm always looking for new things to make for her.  The only alterations for me were using a whole (small) red onion, more garlic and I diced an under-ripe tomato and added it to the end of the quinoa before the mushrooms went in, and Feta instead of Goat cheese.  We'll be having this again soon (and looking for more Quinoa recipes in the meantime!)  Thanks SO much for introducing us to this wonderful food!

Holy cow-free dinner. This recipe exceeded my expectations. Very very yummy. I left out the wine, followed the rest of the recipe pretty faithfully. There was plenty of liquid without the wine, too. I don't like quinoa too squishy, so I keep liquids about 2 c. to each c. quinoa. I saved a little to try it cold later. If it's yummy cold too,  this will be my new favorite quinoa recipe. Thanks for posting!

We love quinoa and I made this as a main dish served with roasted tomatoes and asparagus.  I don't think that it is main dish material as written.  It needed more oomph for that; perhaps some roasted red peppers and something crunchy to sink your teeth into, perhaps some pecans or even water chestnuts.  As a side dish, however, it would be very good.   I squeezed some lemon juice on each serving and I thought that brightened the flavor quite a bit.  It is not the most attractive dish to ever hit the plate, either, which is another reason to add some red peppers for color.

I love this recipe!  I made a few changes, omitting the cheese, using pomegranate balsamic, and adding frozen spinach to the mushroom mixture as it was cooking.

Made this for my husband and me last night, and we loved it. I cut the recipe in half for the two of us, and I will say, I believe the number of servings should be six -- I served it as a main dish and there was still a little left over. Absolutely delicious, a keeper!

I made this dish for friends who had either never had quinoa or had "tasteless" quinoa once before. They loved it and asked for the recipe.  I love the inclusion of thyme. It was a nice change of flavor.  

I was very good. I substituted apple cider for wine and veggie chicken broth for chicken broth. Red Quinoa adds a different flavor also. I cut down on the amount of balsamic to cut some of the sweetness and vinegar taste.

Wow.  Loved this recipe.  I didn't cook the mushrooms separately.  Tossed them in halfway thru the onions.  Used 1 Tb vinegar total and added maple and allspice roasted carrots with the spinach.  Feta instead of goat cheese. Half veg and half chichen stock.  Sounds like a lot of changes but this is the kind of recipe that lends itself to winging it.  It's the base of wine, stock, balsamic and thyme which make it stand out. You could add or sub depending on what you have and still...OMG. This dish made me happy eating it, it was so good.  Thank you, Robin.  This is a new house basic.

love this recipe.  I have been cooking this for almost two years now.  I do make a few minor changes.  I think the balsamic vinegar is too overpowering so I cut it in half and I use vegetable broth to make it vegetarian.  Occasionally increase the amount of mushrooms because I love mushrooms!

Turned out great. Qinoa, spinach, mushrooms, balsamic vinegar... these are a few of my favorite things, and this is a wonderful combination of flavors. I realized I did not have any white wine after getting started so I just used more chicken broth. Still was great and I am going to make with the wine soon.

I didn't love this.  I thought the white wine flavor was too overpowering.  Probably just personal preference, though.  I may try it again without the white wine.  Thanks anyway, quinoa recipes are few and far between!

I altered this so as to cook it in my rice cooker. Added a wee bit of nutmeg to complement the spinach, and mixed the goat cheese right in at the end of cooking. Great side-dish to pair with "Fig and Lemon chicken" from AR.

This was a very good quinoa recipe. Instead of using chicken broth I opted for vegetable stock. I also switched out the spinach with kale and added asparagus. I also used feta since I had that on hand. It came out very well but I did think it was missing something. I'm going to continue to tweak this recipe.

This vegetarian dish is easily adjusted to vegan and is absolutely delicious both ways. More importantly, quinoa is a complete protein, spinach is rich in iron, and all of the ingredients combine for a rich dose of antioxidants.  A healthy, yummy meal!

I've made this recipe several times and every time it's worked out very well. Tonight I made it using Bulgur instead of Quinoa and it was equally delicious. For a special treat and to improve the presentation, I toss a handful of roasted, salted cashews on the top immediately before serving.

I made this for company and it got rave reviews. I had prepared everything up to adding the spinach. Just before serving it, I added more chicken broth to reheat the quinoa, then I added the spinach to wilt it and served it with the crumbled goat cheese.  Would make it again.

Loved this!  I did change it a bit, seems we like our food a bit spicier than normal.   I used one whole yellow onion, one whole red onion and sauteed it with crushed red pepper flakes.  Also, we topped our with goat cheese AND organic raw walnut pieces.  It was amazing.

I absolutely loved this recipe! The goat cheese is crucial and give such a complimentary taste to the Quinoa. I might have used too much balsamic vinegar, so a little less of that would be the only change! A very healthy side - the more veggies the merrier!

Very good. I enjoyed eating the quinoa dish separated from the mushrooms and spinach. Although I love quinoa, I didn't like mixing them as much. I will make this again as two separate side dishes. :o)

Mmmmmmmmm! We cut down the vinegar by a teaspoon or so, and the dish still tasted excellent! A great way to sneak spinach in, especially for the pickier eaters of the family. :-)

I used parmesan cheese instead of goat cheese since that's what I had. Will definitely be making this again.

This was pretty good, even without the feta cheese, which I couldn't find here in Taiwan. I used some Parmesan on top instead, and I used fresh spinach and three kinds of fresh mushrooms. I cooked mine in a crockpot, because I'm lazy, and it turned out fine. Then I had some leftover and added it to a bowl of very thick cream of veggie soup I'd just made. Wow, really perked up the soup! Nice having some bits of mushrooms to chew on, didn't miss the crackers I usually add.

Made this tonight as a main dish for dinner! Wow! It was packed with flavor! I cut back on white wine about 1/4 due to suggestions in other reviews and omitted the cheese (I have a dairy allergy). Great recipe! Can't wait to make it again!

Amazing recipe - it turned out beautifully. I was looking for any dish with spinach and mushrooms (wanted to free some fridge space) and came across this dish. I have tried quinoa before, mainly in soups, and quite liked it for the health effects of this wonderful little grain. This recipe opened some new cooking opportunities with quinoa. We absolutely love spinach, and it is a great combination. Thank you, Robin!

My teenage daughters and I really liked this recipe.  I added some roasted red peppers and decreased the wine and vinegar a little bit.  We thought the goats's cheese went well with it.  We live in the Andes where quinoa is native (cheap) so I am always looking for new recipes.  This was creative and nutritious .

The recipe was easy to follow but without the addition of the goat cheese, all you could taste was the balsamic vinegar.  Wish I would have added some additional vegetables to give it more flavor

Really great recipe with a few mods.  I added red pepper, yellow squash, fresh tomato, and some left over rotisserie chicken.  Substiuted goat w/feta.  I doubled the recipe and it gave me lunch for a week!  Economical and healthy - thanks Robin. B!

Tried this for the first time tonight and it was a delicious and welcome change from the norm!  It was quite yummy!

A few minor adjustments I made:
*slightly less balsamic vinegar 
*used riesling (it was what I had), but would prob be better with a pinot grigio or a chardonnay
*added in precooked/cocktail shrimp to the mushroom mix and tossed it all together to make a main dish

Will definitely make this again!  Next time, I might even toss in some pine nuts or water chestnuts for a little crunch!

I have been wanting to try quinoa. I bought some at the store and then I couldn't remember what recipe I had planned to use. I discovered this one and made it tonight.  After the funny look and the "What is it?" question, my husband tried it and liked it! We both really liked it and I will be making it often.

I would give this 3.5. It's quite tasty but not out of this world, and a bit time consuming.  Given how little time I usually have to cook, I probably will not make this very often but I will make it again.

I am rating this 4 stars because I think the thyme wasn't the best flavor to go with this personally.  Basil would be much better or even parsley.  Also, the other reviewers who used feta probably had a better idea than the goat cheese, which I used according to the recipe. HOWEVER, this is the first time I've ever gotten my hubby to like quinoa and he ever said to make it again.  I used a shallot instead of onion and frozen spinach since I had that.  Added halved cherry tomatoes and half a grilled chicken breast to convince my husband that there was enough protein on his meat eater's plate.  With a few changes (basil in place of thyme and feta instead of goat cheese) this would have been a 5 star recipe.  As written it needed a bit of changing though.  This would also be really awesome with other veggies as well:  bell peppers, zucchini, asparagus, kale, etc.  Whatever is in season with a base of the quinoa recipe.  And it wasn't too winey at all.  Maybe the others didn't let the wine cook down.

Great meal! This was the first time I made quinoa and my husband and I loved this. The only changes I made were I used chicken broth in place of white wine while cooking the mushrooms, used feta instead of goat, and used dried thyme instead of fresh. Very yummy! I would definitely make again :)

I doubled up the recipe because I'm a pig. nah, i just like to make enough food to last me a few days. I had to actually add another cup of quinoa after i cooked everything because there was too much leftover liquid. The grocery store was out of thyme so I used basil instead and instead of goat's cheese, I used feta because I'm not a fan of goat's cheese. The feta made it a bit salty so you don't need to add any salt to it. I really enjoyed this recipe!

Yummy. I made a few changes though, just to suit what I had. I used dill instead of thyme, added shrimp and garlic to the mushroom mixture, added chopped green onions along with the spinach and blue cheese instead of goat. I do like goat cheese better though so I'll definitely use that next time.

This was FABULOUS!  As a heads up, if you don't have a 10oz bag of spinach, an 8oz bag works just as well.  Really. Very yummy. Makes a great side dish!

I loved this dish!!  I did omit the extra chicken broth to the spinach part because my mushrooms gave off quite a bit of liquid, I used mostly baby bellas with some button mushrooms.  Once I combined the quinoa mixture with the mushrooms there was quite a bit of liquid and I left it cook down a little bitbefore adding the spinach.  Also, please don't omit the goat cheese, it really added another layer of flavor to this already flavorful dish!  Thank you for a grear recipe!

This was my first time cooking quinoa and I was surprised at how good this recipe came out!  I didn't have the goat cheese so I just sprinkled some grated parmesan cheese on top.  It actually tasted great even without the cheese.  I'll definitely be making this again!

Big favorite! I make it pretty much exactly to the recipe. The only change I make is that I usually use red wine because that's usually what I have. I put feta cheese over it to serve, again because that's usually what i have.  Freezes really well (before the feta) for lunches. Extremely flavourful and not as much work as it looks.

Made a few changes out of necessity. No goat cheese, so added lemon zest (since I had also used lemon thyme - what I had on hand) and toasted sliced almonds. I would cook the salt into the quinoa next time instead of adding it at the end, since I've read that changes the energy of salt for the better. I only used 1/3 bag of spinach and that was enough.Also added kale for more nutrients.My husband added chicken to his since meat is a must in his eyes! All good.

I loved this! I changed it a bit - used more mushrooms and less spinach, also added a tablespoon of spicy brown mustard to the mushrooms while they simmered. Topped with feta instead of goat cheese for no reason really other than that feta was what I already had on hand. It was really filling as a main dish and I had quite a bit left over even though I ate it on its own. If others are wondering what sort of wine to use, mine was really good with sauvignon blanc.

Nice balance of veggies to quinoa, and great balsamic flavor. Really moist dish.  I had to remove lids and raise heat, as needed, to get liquid to evaporate on quinoa and mushrooms.  7 oz bag of spinach as adequate.

This is my first time cooking with Qunioa and I am happy to start with this recipe, YUM! 
It tasted amaizing and it was not hard to make at all. I did change it up a bit to suit my taste: I used a whole onion and added some parsely in the end, also some portobello mushrooms which added more depth and colour. This recipe is a keeper!

The goat cheese added a nice tangy flavor.  I substituted more chicken broth for the white wine, I never have the right wine for cooking. I liked it with a little more balsamic vinegar at the table. I enjoyed this recipe. I'm not sure if I will make it again, but it was great for a change.

Awesome! Great, with or without the cheese! FYI, I did not have broth on hand, but was pan-searing steaks, and the "beef broth" from the pan searing matched well with everything.

I had to do a lot of tweeking. i did not really like some of the flavors. I love goat cheese, but hated it with the quinoa.  I won't put that in there again. It needs something more mild as a cheese.   I also didn't like how the mushrooms were cooked. they are very bland and had to find a way to get a good flavor from them. The quinoa itself was also bland, and I seasoned it with garlic powder, and a hint of paprika. lots of salt too, and usually never add a lot of salt to things.

Good recipe.  I agree with some other reviewers, I'd give this 5 stars if there was a bit more pizazz to the recipe.  Perhaps some roasted red pepper or sundried tomato tossed in would provide some colour and texture to the final product.  I replaced the wine with chicken broth (I didn't have any white wine on hand), replaced thyme with fresh basil, and omitted the cheese.  Still turned out to be a great 'base' recipe for quinoa.  I will be making this again!

Wasn't as good as I was hoping, nor worth the time it took to make it. I may experiment with it again because I love the nutritional value of quinoa.

Not my kind of flavor.  The vinegar was overpowering.  Maybe I'll try again with less.

I really didn't like this much.  I followed the recipe to a T but I did use frozen spinach instead of fresh.  I added them to the mushrooms and let them cook for 5 mins.  It just didn't do much for me.  Try the Quinoa recipe with black beans & corn - awesome!

This is an excellent base recipe, although I added several more spices to give it more flavor.  One thing to note: you must use wine that you would drink.  The quinoa and mushrooms really soak up the flavor of the wine, so if you don't care for the taste of the wine, you won't like this dish. I have also used this basic recipe to add other things, such as sweet potatoes, to my quinoa.  Excellent healthy and filling dish.

I loved this recipe: incredibly simple and incredibly delicious. I also recommend it for anyone who is on a soft food diet. I recently went through jaw surgery and after only two weeks, I am able to eat this! How delicious. I made no changes, so I recommend cooking as is... it makes a lot of food, at least enough for 3 meals for one person.

It's really good.  I was hesitant at 1st because the 1st time I tried quinoa, I didn't like it.  But with more water (2:1 ratio) and longer cooking time, it's perfect and not as grainy as I remembered.  Definitely a keeper

Hubby and I really enjoyed this recipe since we both like balsamic vinegar a lot! I don't think this is a recipe for everyone since the wine and balsamic flavors are pretty strong. I added a cut up chicken breast to make this a main dish and also used feta cheese since I didn't have any goat cheese. I'd love to try it again using goat cheese instead! Love that stuff :o) Next time, I will also add more minced garlic and a few other seasonings that compliment thyme to add more depth to the flavor. I liked this as a main dish, but for a side dish I prefer the lighter flavors of Cheesy Quinoa Pilaf with Spinach. I'm glad to have two great recipes for quinoa since it's such a healthy grain. Thanks!

Did not care for this and I love quinoa, mushrooms and spinach.  I think it's the wine and vinegar that made it kind of weird tasting.  If I were to make it again I'd definitely use feta cheese over goat.

I used low sodium chicken broth, and not a lot of salt, so it came out a little bit bland, but probably better for me.  The goat cheese helped with the flavor.  Portion sizes are big, I made 3 servings and it was way more than enough as a side dish.

I feel like this recipe has potential.  It's a good combination of flavors, but way too much liquid for the amount of quinoa.  My end product turned out incredibly soggy and was not so good.

I loved this recipe and surprisingly, so did my boyfriend!  I followed the recipe, but I did end up with a lot of extra liquid after I added the mushroom mixture, but that was no problem to cook off.  I also added some chopped bell pepper with the onion in the first step, which I thought gave a nice compliment.  I thought the wine flavor was perfect.  I will definately be making this one again.

I have made this dish about 4 times now and love it every time.  I think you can use dried thyme too and certainly don't need an entire bag of spinach.  Also I omitted the cheese.  It makes a lot but is even better on days 2 and 3 so . . .

I made this using vegetarian ingredients and it's the best Quinoa recipe I've tried.  You won't be sorry!  I cut my mushrooms up really tiny, because I feel that works better with the texture of the quinoa.  I also add frozen chopped spinach or kale at the end.  I love this recipe because you can eat it cold during the summer, or heated up when the weather gets cold.  It tastes delicious either way, and one batch lasts me a whole week!  Thank you so much for this recipe - it really is one of my favorite meals!

I enjoed this. I did make some minor alterations. I cut back on the quinoa and added some sliced roasted chicken to the finished product. I do think next time I will cut back on the wine a bit but that is just my personal preference. It was a filling and easy meal.

I am so impressed! I thought this was very flavorful, and it really didn't taste as simple as it was to make. Delicious! I used less spinach than called for, and thought it was excellent with or without feta cheese. This was the first time I have made quinoa, and I will definitely be making it again.

My husband really liked this and I thought it was okay, so the four stars. I did not have an open bottle of wine so I left it out. I was short a little quinoa and I used shiitake mushrooms and kale instead of spinach. I followed one of the suggestions and kind of did  it with one pot. I had both goat cheese and feta, but my husband  voted for the goat (I would have preferred feta) I think it was a little “gamie” tasting for me with the shiitakes and goat cheese together.

This was my. First Quinoa experience. I cooked the Quinoa. separately in chicken broth as I made enough to use in a few different dishes I want to try. I added it to the pan last after I sautéed the mushrooms, onion, and garlic. I'm not sure what to make of this dish. and it's flavors.. However I did enjoy the balsamic!

I made this recipe exactly as written and it was fantastic!  The only thing I would change next time is to start with less chicken broth and add more as needed.  Mine was a little soupy.

Made this many times and I love it. Anywhere it says wine I use chicken or veggie broth as I don't normally have wine in the house. Outside of that, I make it as is. Wonderful!

YUM!  A great recipe to work from, I didn't add wine or thyme (because I didn't have any).  Added a can of pesto flavored tomatoes, chopped up chitpotle sausages, and used frozen chopped spinach.  Delicious, thank you!

OK, so I didn't have quite the right ingredients for this recipe.  I didn't have fresh mushrooms, so I used a large can of mushrooms and skipped the mushroom step all together an dumped them in with the spinach at the end.  My goat cheese would not crumble, so we just treated it like cream cheese and worked it in at the end too.  Even with all of my troubles trying to get it right it was great!!! My husband kept saying wow! this is so good.  I noticed some said the white wine was overpowering, so maybe not using them in the mushrooms was a good idea.  Oh! Didn't have fresh Thyme either, so used a tsp of dry.  Hey! It was so good despite the lack of this or that.

I do Valentine's day dinner at home with my family.  It has become quite the wonderful tradition.  The main dish and dessert are always the same and I change up the side dishes.  This year, I made Robin's Quinoa with Mushrooms and Spinach and it was a HIT!  My husband RAVED and my daughter loved it.   Everything about this dish - Magnificent.  I will not save this recipe for the once a year fancy meal.  We WILL have this often.  SO Good!

Love it! Its now a staple for me. It keeps in the fridge for up to 5 days and is just as good cold as warm. I often skip the goats cheese and use Parmesan or no cheese at all

It was good, but the wine and salt (from my chicken stock) were way too overpowering. I cooked some salmon in the after-mushroom pan, which was delicious. I think next time I wouldn't use as much (if any?) wine and way less stock.

This was our family's introduction to Quinoa and it was just dandy.  Some of us would have liked more mushrooms but who's complaining.  The blending of flavours was just lovely.

I've made this three times now, and each all different.  This is a classic base recipe and you can add anything to it. I added shallots with the onion and garlic, and collard greens along with the spinach. And sprinkled flaxseed all over it. Only used half the chicken stock recommended (bc it had yeast it in it, and I shouldn't have yeast) + water and salt The first 2 times I rinsed the quinoa before putting it in, and it did take out a bitter aftertaste. I didn't the 3rd time, but it's not noticeable unless you look for it. The baslamic vinegar and thyme do a lot to get rid of that.

The mushroom mixture is especially good! Next time I'm making twice as much!! Spinach didn't add much but color, even though I love spinach usually. Added carrots too. I've tried it with feta and goat cheese (and parmesan) and I think feta is the best.

The great thing about this quinoa recipe is that it provides a great "base" that allows you to customize according to taste veggie-wise.  For example, I used onion, fresh string beans, and shrimp instead of mushrooms and feta.  As someone who follows a gluten-free/dairy-free diet, I value this recipe because it's something that my whole family will eat-plus, it's easy to make a lot at one time.  Thank you for sharing!

We love quinoa; this will be a great addition to our rotation. My 1-year-old ate it by the fistful. We added diced chicken (marinated in balsamic vinegar) to the skillet with the mushrooms. Served with baked squash for a colorful, filling fall meal.

Just loved this recipe! I served it to a non-quinoa fan, and he liked it! So glad to finally find a way to fix this so that we can have quinoa more often. The only thing I did change was feta for the goat cheese...fabulous!

This has become a regular part of our dinner rotation. It is fabulous exactly as written. The goat cheese goes so well with the wine/mushroom/thyme flavors. We usually top it with herb gril.led chicken tenderloins

I am not used to quinoa, and mine may have been undercooked - a bit more tooth to it than I expect.  I loved the goat cheese, but used frozen spinach.  I would try it again with fresh, and maybe try feta, like others suggest.

This is my first time making quinoa and I thought it was excellent!  I didn't find it too soggy, and thought the flavors went really well (used a sweet balsalmic and a mild chardonnay).  Topped it with feta because I'm not fond of goat cheese... so good!  I will definitely make this in the future!

I didn't like the flavor. It tasted rubbing alcohol-y.  Maybe I just need a different wine.

WOW! This is a great recipe.  I should start by saying that I usually don't like quinoa, but wanted to try this recipe because it was so well reviewed. I love veggies, so I added in some zuchinni with the onion, and folded in one tomato and fresh corn-off-the-cob with the spinach.  I also added some chicken to make it more of a whole meal for the BF (2 cubed chicken breasts, marinated in OJ, salt, pepper.. splash of white wine and then a tsp of honey once the chicken is white/cooked). SUPER recipe, and I will definitely be making this again -- frequently!!

A very nice recipe!  This was the first time I ever cooked quinoa so I wasn't sur ewhat to expect.  It was a little mooshy, but the taste of it was great.  My husband liked it, but my daughter woudln't even try it because there was spinach in it.  I'm going to save this as a Passover recipe because we can't eat rice, but we can eat quinoa! :)

Delicious and healthy! I substituted vodka instead of white wine (but cut back on the proportion since vodka is so strong), and still tasted wonderful.

My favorite quinoa recipe ever!  Made it last night and fell in love with it again!  My husband loves it.  We no longer cook with rice, ever.  Quinoa is just too good for you.  I make it with canned/dried ingredients sometimes, but much better with fresh!  Great with "Garlic and Rosemary Simmered Pork Chops!"

I cooked this tonight with only one small change: I replaced the mushrooms with grilled chicken. It turned out great and this small change increases the serving size from 3 to 5. This had great flavor and was easy to make.

The flavor was okay on this one, but the texture left a lot to be desired. It's such a great idea that I don't want to give up on it yet... I think I just need to perfect making quinoa that's not soggy before I make this again.

This is the best quinoa recipe I've found yet!  I followed the recipe exactly, with the exception of using feta instead of goat cheese, since that's what I had on hand.  Excellent!!  I will definitely make this again!

Wonderful!  I used frozen spinach that I thawed and drained really well and it was  fine.  I added it the last 5 min of the cooking time.  I also used feta and it was great.  I'll add a can of diced tomatoes next time.

Easy and delicious! Like other reviewers, I also used about half a bag of spinach.

This was very good the first day and not quite as good reheated as leftovers.  I'll admit that the flavor of quinoa isn't my favorite, but I eat it anyway because it is so healthy.  For quinoa lovers this recipe is probably a 5.

This was my first time cooking or eating quinoa and I really enjoyed it.  For easier assembly, I recommend wilting the spinach with the mushrooms and then stirring it into the quinoa.  Thanks for a great intro to a healthy side dish.

I love it, and to add some protein without adding much fat, I grilled up some turkey sausage, chopped it and threw it in.  It made it a great lunch to take to work.

This was a fabulous recipe that even my picky eating dh loved.  And as previous commenters mentioned, it's even better the next day.  My hubby won't eat feta or goat cheese so I used fresh parm reggiano and it blended well with the rest of the flavors.  I'd love to try it with goat cheese though.  I also used dried wild mushrooms and just reconstituted them before putting them in the skillet.  Next time I'll try reconstituting them in the stock and wine but this way was just fine too.  I only used 5oz of fresh spinach and that was fine, though I might use more next time just because I like it.  I might try cutting back on the balsamic just a smidge because it came across just a hair stronger than I'd like the first night, though by the second day it had mellowed out.  Excellent dish!  Thank you!

I am always looking for new flavors to add to quinoa. This was a great find. I loved the freshness of the mushrooms,spinach and the thyme. The balsamic also adds another level of flavor. Very healthy and tasty, my 9 year old also loved it....will make again!

My husband and 4 year old daughter ate it up (to my happy surprise!)  My daughter didn't want it on her plate but after some coaxing of one bite, she ate all of it and went back for 2nds.  My husband gave it the 5 stars.  I also very much enjoyed it.  The appearance of the dish is a bit off putting so best to put it in a pretty bowl with some cheese sprinkles on top to make it look more edible.

This was okay.  I would've rated it 3 stars, but I didn't add any goat cheese, which might have made it better.  It's not a bad recipe, but I didn't think it was very exciting.
