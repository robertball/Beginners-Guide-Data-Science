Delicious, economical, and easy to make. I was worried as I was adding the oil because even though I was streaming it slowly the mayo didn't seem to be thickening.  I stuck it in the fridge and as it cooled it thickened and tastes like a really good mayo.  No HFCS or other preservatives in our mayo now!

I made this for a friend's son who has many allergies. I made potato salad using the mayo and it tasted not much different then my regular salad.

I was surprised at how easy this was. I used olive oil and it turned out just like Miracle Whip.  Thanks!

I have been trying out Mayo recipes since years and this is the best one ever! It is absolutely fantastic. Tastes just like regular mayo and so easy to make. I added a quarter cup of oil extra which made the Mayo really thick and glossy just like a store bought bottle. Thanks . Loved it!

I have tried this recipe with powdered soy milk minus the sugar and it works perfectly! and also add some fresh garlic and chipotle chiles for a nice flavor.

Made this yesterday then put it in fridge. Only change I made was reducing the sugar to 1/2 T'spoon & adding 1 T of honey. Overnight is did become thicker so do be sure to drizzle in the oil. Today it tasted fine, just too sweet; the next time I'll not add honey or sugar & maybe an extra T of lemon juice.

Easy and delish! I added 1/8 tsp. garlic powder, but other than that, I made the recipe exactly as posted. Next time I would cut down on the sugar just a tad, but that is just a personal preference. It took overnight in the fridge to thicken up...worth the wait, though because it was very good! Will definitely make this again. Thanks!

In making this recipe, I didn't know that it would thicken as it sits. I added more powdered milk to get the right consistency but found out later that it thickened up a lot and was almost unusable. But, as a whole, it was easy to make and what I tasted before it got too thick was great!

I made this to add to tuna fish for tuna fish salad. Only took a few minutes to make. This is pretty dang weird by itself but added to tuna makes a great dish. Will make it again.

Tastes just like mayo. It did thicken a bit but not quite as thick as mayo. Going to use it for potato salad. So excited I found this recipe. Very good.

I made it and it didn't thicken but it's in the fridge now and I can't wait to see how it turns out!  Even if it doesn't though, it still is so yummy! It reminds me of KFC Cole slaw.

I used regular milk. It didn't thicken at all. It may work with the powdered milk, I didn't have any handy so I don't know.

this recipe was well put together.  All of the ingredients were in the rightproportion.  I have a habit of not following a recipe exactly depending how it tastes......it worked our great no matter what I did.   I even used coffee whitener instead of powdered milk( all there was in the cupboard).
