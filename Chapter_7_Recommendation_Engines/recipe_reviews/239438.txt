On a strict elimination diet so I swapped:
1. eggs for flax eggs
2. milk for coconut milk
3. honey for date syrup
4. butter for a wee bit of coconut oil
also added cinnamon and vanilla bean to get rid of the grassy flavour - topped with home made apple sauce (apple, coconut oil, cinnamon) 

Delicious for someone who can eat very little on this diet.

My wife has recently been told she needs to avoid wheat and gluten, so we have been looking for replacements for everyday staples. We bought some quinoa flour and I found this recipe. It makes  a good thin pancake batter, I added about an extra !/2 a cup of flour to thicken it up a little an made waffles with it. They were fantastic, lighter and more flavorful than our regular waffle mix. Served with butter and real maple syrup.......amazing.

This has a distinct taste. I am not gluten intolerant, I just happened to have quinoa flour and made these pancakes to use up the quinoa flour. I was fortunate to loose the quinoa taste via maple syrup & butter. The texture is not grainy, it holds up well for a gluten free pancake.

Thank you so much for sharing this recipe! I love that it used all ingredients that I typically have on hand and didn't have to buy anything special to use once. I ground my own quinoa flour, using a coffee grinder and I used almond milk and only egg whites (there's a yolk allergy at our house). I probably used slightly less milk than called for. I added it last and quit when the batter was the consistency that I was looking for. They were yummy and quite satisfying. It's been a long time since I've had pancakes!

Used almond milk instead, but used with our waffle maker and the whole family loved them - age 6 to 76!

Excellent recipe. Great tasting. Used two more eggs and half cup less milk because I have so many eggs to use up. Will definitely make these again:-) ok the kids weren't overly impressed, but hubby and I liked them.

When I first made these pancakes I didn't care for them too much but now I love them. I eat them all the time. I use my almond milk in it and put some flax seed and chia in it.
