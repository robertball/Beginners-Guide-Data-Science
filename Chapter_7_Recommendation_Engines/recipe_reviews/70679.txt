This is only the 2nd time in my life making a whole roasted chicken (because I find them too dry and bland to bother), but after using *this* recipe it may just become a weekly occaision! Not only was this easy to prepare and the flavour outstanding, this was the JUICIEST chicken I have ever eaten - anywhere! I am so impressed with this recipe, I'm going to try this rub/marinade and roasting method with my next holiday turkey. I think roasting it breast-side down may be the key in retaining the flavourful juices. My only changes were to double the spices and add an onion to the cavity with the garlic. Amazing chicken!

Excellent recipe.  I didnt realize I was out of allspice, so I substituted with dried rosemary and pepper. I put 1 cup of water in the bottom of the pan, with quartered potatoes, celery, onions and carrots.  Cooked uncovered at 400 for 30 min and then 350 for 45 min. Once the skin was crispy, I covered with foil.  It was so tender and juicy.  A HIT!

The savory aroma of the cooking chicken didn't disappoint the eater.  My husband loved this roasted chicken.  I doubled the spices as other reviewers recommended.  I didn't marinade overnight... I just rubbed it in and put it in the oven.  I also stuffed it with an onion.  Husband has already requested for this chicken again.  It was so easy.  And the result was a hot, juicy and tender chicken.

I am an extremely picky cooker and eater. My kids could not be pickier. I also love to cook and am considered to be pretty good at it. Having said this, this was the best chicken recipe I've ever made!

I followed the advice to double the spices and I did marinate it overnight. I put the spices under the skin and rubbed them inside the bird as well. then I cut slits in the skin to make sure the flavors got in.

Being concerned about the smoke issue, I used one of those stand up chicken cookers where you place the bird on two metal arches with a bowl in the middle to catch the juices. I cooked it at 350 for just over an hour and It was perfect. The only things I changed were I sprinkled garlic powder inside and out instead of crushing garlic and I basted it once with some melted butter.This recipe was a total sucess with not one morsel left over.  The dogs were going crazy over the smell, but as cinnamon is bad for dogs we did not give them any. This is a great company dish and I plan to make it again this weekend when we have friends over. Absolute perfection!

AWESOME recipe! I just made it for the first time tripling the spices because I cut out the backbone to butterfly it (and put it under the skin for me to eat) coating both the inside and out, as well as under the skin and marinated in a zip bag only a few hours because that's all the time I had. I roasted a 4 lb chicken with the directions shown butterflied breast down with minced garlic on the inside of the breast, and it is EXCELLENT! My 9 year old even gobbled it up! DEFINATELY will make again and again.

This recipe is good, my family loves it. At first I was a little hesitant to put sugar and cinnamon on meat, but I'm glad I did, because it's the best whole chicken recipe I've made.

WOW!  We were having guests over and I wanted to serve more than just a basic roasted chicken.  I followed advice and doubled the spices, no allspice though. I rubbed the mixture under the skin with the garlic and marinated for the recommended 24 hours. I baked it according to directions, and it came out delicious! The left-overs made a delicious and exotically spiced chicken soup. These are my only changes: #1 Double the spices, mix with grated garlic. #2 Rub under skin, marinate for 24 hours. This is my standard baked chicken now, thanks, Indriani!

I didn't have allspice and put the seasoning under the skin since we are non skin eaters.  Otherwise I made this as written- YUM!  It was moist and delicious.  I had hoped for leftovers- but my husband and I and his parents ate every single piece of meat off the chicken!  We were literally hunting for the smallest morsels that were left.

I have made this over and over again just like the recipe, and it is always delicious.  I was a little leary at first because it seems to be a strange mixture of spices, but once I tried it, I'm a true fan of this recipe.  Thanks for sharing.

It was a standard roasted chicken, but I wasn't really a fan of the spices.  I saw other reviews that shared my concern for the spices, but they said the chicken turned out great.  So I gave it a go.  I followed everything about the recipe except the cooking time (I do roasted chickens somewhat often, and have a cooking time that works great for me).  It tasted like I should be eating pie, but I got chicken instead.  I'll stick with my usual herb roasted chicken.  But they do have it spot on about baking it breast-side-down and basting.

I have made this chicken a few times and it always gets rave reviews from everyone - even the picky eaters.  I normally make a 4 lb chicken, double the spices and add an onion in the cavity like so many others based on other reviews. Tonight I made a 7 lb chicken and was concerned that it would not come out as well due to another review I read. However - it came out awesome!  It fed 5 adults and 2 toddlers with nothing left over! Due to the size, I cooked it at 500 for 25 minutes, 450 for 25 minutes and 425 for about 40 - 45 minutes until it reached a 180 temp. I also added a cup of chicken broth to the roasting pan and basted about 3 - 4 times.  It did get smoky so I tented it with tin foil and the combination of that and the broth kept the smoke under control. The result was a fully cooked, flavorful and moist chicken! My "dark meat only" eaters were raving about the white meat. This chicken was such a hit, I will be making it over and over and over again!

This was the first time I made roast chicken, and this got rave reviews! The bf talked about how "awesome" it was all night, and from him "I like it" is high praise. That said, I thought it was way too salty. The only change I made was to add onion to the stuffing and I put the spice rub under the skin since I don't like the skin. I think next time I make this I'm going to cut back on the salt, because otherwise it was DELISH! Easy to make, though I was a bit afraid the smoke was going to set off alarms...

I usually do not eat chicken, however I cook it frequently for the family.  I tried this recipe and the chicken was so beautifully brown, so delicous smelling, I had to eat some.  OMG!  This is the best roasted chicken in the world.  Make 2 because 1 will not be enough.

I've NEVER made a whole chicken before and was pretty nervous about roasting it for the first time. THIS WAS SO DELICIOUS! I didn't let it marinate and I didn't have most of the spices - I just did the salt, sugar, and doubled the cinnamon. I rinsed the chicken, put an onion and the garlic in the cavity, and rubbed it with the spices. That is all the prep work I did for the chicken and it took less than 10 minutes. Then I chopped up some red potatoes, carrots, leftover radishes, and one more onion to roast along with the chicken. I tossed them with olive oil, salt, pepper, and rosemary. I put the veggies around the chicken and lastly put about a cup of chicken stock in the bottom of the pan with the veggies.
This was so good and the cooking time was perfect. I think I might use less salt next time though. Thank you for the recipe!

Awesome tasting chicken, but wish someone would have comented on putting a lid on the roasting pan, my oven was one horable mess, took hours to clean up.  Will do again with a lid.

Awesome. The previous chicken I made came out so boring. This one rocks.  There are two virtues to this recipe:  * the general instructions on the proper cooking times and temperatures, which created a crisp exterior and an evenly cooked, juicy interior  * the seasonings, which are delicious;  The only thing I would do differently next time is to leave out the Old Spice, which gave it a "deoderant" taste, which my wife and children found off-putting.  (Just kidding about that last part! I know it called for Allspice).

This is a great recipe. I have to admit I was concerned about starting off with 500 degrees but it comes out perfect; very juicy. It cooks perfect in one hour. My chicken was just over 4 lbs. I doubled the spices and put them under the skin, put in zip lock bag for about 12 hours; because that's all the time I had. I am a dark meat person because I think the white meat is too dry and I ate the white meat because it was so juicy :)

Yum!  My husband calls this "Christmas Chicken" because he says it (and the gravy that I make from the drippings) tastes like Christmas.  I've made it twice.  The first time, I left out the allspice but doubled the rest of the spices (except the salt).  I added a sliced onion with the garlic in the cavity.  The second time, I again left out the allspice and tripled the spices (incl. salt) and the chicken had the best flavor!  The drippings ended up too salty though, which made my gravy too salty, so next time I will limit the salt again.  I serve this with mashed potatoes & gravy, and oven roasted brussel sprouts.

My first roasted chicken and this was a big hit...!!  I did double the rub ingredients except the salt and stuffed the bird with 1/2 an onion in addition to xtra cloves of garlic.  I cooked this as recommended but cooked the bird on quartered red potatos and carrots with a cup of chicken stock and basted with butter as I dropped the oven temp.  This made for a wonderful gravy thickened with some cornstarch and cold water.  I also added the chicken juice that accumulated while the bird was resting.  My boyfriend and I are licking our fingers as I type.  Thanks for a wonderful complete dinner INDRIANI...!!

This was wonderful! So easy and so good.The flavor really gets into the whole chicken. I was only able to marinate it for a little over an hour but the flavor was unbelievable.
I tented the chicken with foil for the first 15 mintues, as another reviewer suggested, and I also added a cup of water to the bottom of the pan so it wouldn't smoke. I will definitely make this again.

Best part for me is the roasting upside down. The breast was moist and juicy, being protected from direct heat. Next time I will use no sugar because I prefer a savory herb blend instead of a sweet spice. 500 degrees in my oven for 15 minutes did blacken the chicken unpleasantly, so I will try 450 next time for the first 15 minutes and reduce to maybe 375 for another hour.

This was amazing! I doubled the spices as suggested by other users and rubbed it under the skin.  Otherwise followed recipe exactly and it was so good.  Even my basic-food-liking father in law liked it and I had been concerned that he might think cinnamon on chicken was strange.  Mom-in-law even asked me for the recipe, Put sweet potatoes, potatoes, carrots, onion and turnips and a little water under and around the rack in the roasting pan and the drippings gave them an amazing flavor. Also made the Chimichurri Sauce as recommended and it was deelish! and The cooking time was right on for my 4 lb chicken. Leftovers made a great chicken salad with grapes and apple. 14 year old loved the chicken, 7 month old loved the veggies, an out and out hit! Will absolutely make again, with no changes.

Rarely do I ever give reviews - I must say this turned out delicious and so easy.  I had to modify a bit due to lack of time and spices....

I doubled all the spices but didn't have all spice or cloves - added garlic and onion powder.  Added minced garlic and whole onion in the cavity.  I didn't marinade at all as I didn't have time.  Rubbed the two 5 lbs chickens that I bought.

Placed in my roaster (the one I use for my Thanksgiving turkey) and followed the temp and time to the directions.  They didn't brown because of the roaster - but I have never had moist chicken like this before!

I have four children and they all tasted it and couldn't wait for me to serve!  They loved it!!  Trying to get my picky 9 year old to eat chicken is an act of God - this was the 1st time she asked for seconds!

I placed mushrooms on the bottom as some other reviews suggested and they were amazing!  I also placed chicken broth on the bottom of the pan to prevent burning and smoking - it was awesome!

I made a gravy with the left over broth, served mashed on the side with gravy!

Can't wait to make it again!

This chicken recipe is killer good. The high starting temperature crisps the skin, so the inside can steam. It cooks fast and evenly for a roasted chicken. My other chicken experiences have been dry, raw nightmares.. >_

This is an interesting recipe. Per other reviewers, I doubled everything except the salt and also rubbed the seasoning underneath the skin. My chicken was 5lbs, so I expected it to take a little longer, but I also had to rub it with a bit of butter after the second 15 minute segment at 450 degrees because there wasn't anything on the bottom of the pan to put back over the chicken. This was different and tasty. I kept thinking, this isn't exactly the best chicken ever, but then again, I couldn't stop eating either. It's a nice change once in awhile. Next time, I'll cut out the sugar and nutmeg, and maybe add a little chile for some spice.

Very good and made the house smell delicious!! I added some peeled, cored and sliced apples and sliced garlic with the same spice mixture to the pan to accompany the chicken, and they were delicious!! Thanks for sharing!

Great tatste BUT it was totally burned within the first 20 minutes.  I'd recommend all the spices but only 350 degrees and then broil it for a few minutes if it is not brown enough for you

I very rarely review recipes but this one definitely deserves it.  This is by far one of my favorite recipes on this website.  I always double the seasonings and fill the chicken cavity with sliced onion and celery along with the garlic for some added flavor.  I also add a teaspoon of butter inside the cavity for a little extra juice.  My family absolutely loves this recipe and it makes an excellent Sunday night dinner!

I never would of put these spices together for chicken but this was wonderful. I have a rotisserie for my chicken so i cooked it that way. The chicken was amazing! Everyone loved it, including the picky kids!

Covered bird w/ another pan during 500 deg. cooking period. Bird did not burn, and really was quite juicy. W/ the sugar in the rub, would advise putting tinfoil down in your drip pan b/c now I'm left w/ disgusting burned black drippings that are NOT coming off. Will make again, did as others advised and doubled spices and rubbed underneath skin as well. Flavor was not everything it's been raved about....maybe if I'm able to let it sit 24hrs and not 5....

This was AMAZING. I stuffed the chicken with an onion and sliced up potatoes, carrots and onions around the bottom of the pan with a bit of water. We had company over and I ended up forgetting to baste the chicken and thought I had totally ruined it when I forgot to take it out of the oven when the timer went off, but nope! It ended up being the juiciest chicken I've ever had. Everyone loved it. Thank you very much for sharing!

This chicken is awesome I made some small changes, used brown sugar instead of white and I made extra rub and rubbed it under the skin along with some softened butter. I also lowered the cooking temp. started at 450 degrees F then 425, then finished at 375 because my oven runs hot. The chicken came out so flavourful and juicy everybody loved it!

Very good! I love how it came out golden brown; very picturesque. It was fall-of the bone delicious. I didnt have a roasting pan, so I used a 9x13 " baking pan instead, but it worked great, and instead of garlic for the cavity I used an apple and sprinkled the inside with some garlic powder. I also made sure I dry rubbed under the skin along with the outside of the skin the night before. It adds more flavour in the end. Easy overall, and will probably not go back to baking my whole chicken!

I have made this chicken several times and I love it.  I double the spice mixture.  Then I cut out the spine of the chicken and lay it in the pan, breast down.  Then I rub the spices under the skin of the bird.  Drizzle olive oil on top (the inside cavity that is now face up).  Roast it at 450 degrees for 20 min, then 425 for 15 min, 400 for 15 min until done.  Crazy temp, I know but it ALWAYS comes out so tender and juicy.

I make this at least once a month and my whole family loves it. Like other reviewers, I double the spices (except salt) and add chopped onion to the cavity. In the summertime when I don't want to turn on the oven, I make this in the slow cooker the same way and simply cook on high for 5 hours. (no liquid needed) Thanks for the great recipe!

I made this chicken last night and it was delicious! I followed the recipe but there was one problem...at the beginning of cooking while the temp was at 500 degrees, the juices burned to the bottom of the pan and smoked out our house. I added water after that and everything went well. I didn't add the water to begin with because it was not in the recipe instructions.

I was hesitant try to this recipe due to the various spices used (ones I'd normally use only for baking), however it turned out fabulously!  It smelled so delicious while it was cooking, friends and family couldn't wait to try it!  Was a huge hit - absolutely delicious! Will definitely make it again!

I HIGHLY recommend this recipe!! The only changes I made are, I didn't use the Cloves because I don't like Cloves. Doubled the ingredients, cooked breast side up on a rack, and added chicken broth to the pan for more drippings. The drippings make an awesome gravy, and I freeze the remaining drippings in ice cube trays to cook with at a later date. Also, make sure you put your oven rack a little lower than the center. Otherwise, your chicken may burn. Yum! Yum! YUM!!!

I was extremely skeptical of the spices but trusted fellow reviewers praise. Doubled the ingredients except salt. It was outstanding!!  My husband said he'd never tasted a better roast chicken and it was super moist, not the dried out usual version.

Oh. My. Gosh.  I didn't have time to marinate overnight so I doubled the spices and cooked my 4lb bird at 375 for an hour and 45 minutes.  I basted it three or four times while it cooked, and it was DELICIOUS.  Best roasted chicken I ever had.

I was a bit skeptical about using sugar, cinnamon and nutmeg as a seasoning to roast the chicken, but to my surprise, THIS WAS ABSOLUTELY THE BEST TASTING, DELICIOUSLY MOIST AND CRISPY CHICKEN THAT I HAVE EVER COOKED. I did not have allspice or cloves, but I did add pepper, garlic powder, parsley flakes and paprika to the blend.  I also cooked the chicken the whole time in a 350 degree oven.  Thanks for this fantastic recipe!

Varied the recipe by doubling the amount of spices and stuffed cavity with one whole onion cut in quarters (following other reviewers suggestions).  Strange flavoring for a chicken...but not unpleasant.  My biggest problem with this recipe was the spattering in the oven at these high temperatures.  The oven was spotless and now needs to be cleaned.  The house has a chicken grease smell that's evident 12 hours after I cooked it.  500 (and then 450) degrees is too hot.  The skin burned black...probably the combination of hot oven and sugar that burned.  It took 1/2 hour to scrub the baking pan it was in (and that was after soaking in white vinegar!). After the initial 1/2 hour, I turned oven to 350 degrees and just kept checking until temperature was 180 degrees. Breast meat was  tender and juicy. I never cooked a chicken upside down before, but I will in the future...that was probably the best thing about this recipe.

Based on my experience with roasting chickens, I opted to rub the spices between the skin and the meat by gently loosening the skin. I also included the garlic in with the rub instead of putting it in the cavity. I had to cover the chicken pretty early in the cooking time as it was getting close to black on top. As a result, I had to cook it much longer than indicated. I would have to modify the cooking time and temps to use this recipe again.

It turned out great.  I was skeptical about the different spices, but WOW it was really good.  The only thing I changed was I roasted it conventionally.
That is to say I thought the temp, as written was way to high.  I put it on convection roast @ 325.  It was done in the time frame of an hour. Thank you for sharing this recipe.

I made this last night for my Husband and a friend who comes to our house for Sunday Dinner. She is 70 years old and said that was the best roasted Chicken she had ever had!  I was a bit dubious about using those spices on chicken, but after reading the reviews I decided to try it. I am so glad I did! I will be making my Roast Chicken this way from now on! So tender and juicy, and smelled great cooking too!!  I highly recommend trying this recipe! It will surprise you!!

I made this today for Rosh Hashanah and OMG(gosh)it was soooooooooo great!!! I didn't do veggies under it - I just put some water in the bottom of the pan. Yesterday I soaked the whole chicken in a bath of 1/4 c. sugar and 2 Tbsp salt for about 4 hours to moisten it (this helps chicken a lot), then I let it sit in the fridge overnight with double the spice rub under and on top of the skin.   This was the most delicious roasted chicken I have ever had, and I will make this all the time now!   Just..... wow.

Must be just a personal preference but this was inedible - didn't care for the taste or combination of spices.

I was very disappointed in this recipe. I would like to know what type of oven the original recipe was cooked in. When I cooked it according to the instructions, in my standard gas oven, it was far from being done.  In fact the breast of the chicken was raw inside and looked like it needed another hour of cooking time.

Interesting combination of spices; it has a Moroccan flair. I doubled the spices and salt, though I thought it came out a little salty that way.  I would keep the salt the same as the original recipe next time. I stuffed the bird w onion since I didn't have garlic cloves, and instead mixed minced garlic from a jar with the spices and rubbed that on the chicken.  Cooked it right away, and added sliced carrots along the sides of the dish.

This my all time favorite chicken recipe.  I've made it multiple times and its been absolutely delicious every time. I always double the seasoning. I made it this evening, and after reading some previous reviews, added red onion to the cavity and bottom of the pan as well as multi colored carrots, and red potatoes. I also put smashed garlic under the skin and some butter too. Holy delicious, batman!  The flavor of the veggies were AMAZING and the chicken was nice and juicy!  It makes an easy one pot dish that everyone loves.

I've used this rub on my whole chickens numerous times. My husband thinks his rub is better than this, but he's wrong. One day we will have a cook off for friends and family to decide. Without a doubt, this recipe will win! The first few times I made it I followed the recipe to a T, although I doubled the recipe because I didn't feel like there was enough to fully cover the chicken. Since then, I purchased a rotisserie and make it that way. It helps keep the temp down in the kitchen. I'm not lying when I say this is the best tasting chicken I've ever had!

Amazing. One tip...poultry cooked to 170 degrees F and left to sit the 20 minutes will be even more moist, and will still be safe to eat. Any salmonella will be destroyed.

I know the ingredients sound a little strange, but it is delicious!  I have even made it with out letting the rub sit for 24 hours so don't let that scare you off either.  My 3 boys and husband all loved this.  Even makes great gravy.

I roasted this chicken the way suggested and it was Bloody!!!  I had to roast it an additional 45 minutes.  Everything else I cooked that day turned out well, so I know it was not my oven. I am not even sure at this point how it turned out because it was so late I just let it cool and put it away.

This chicken was probably one of the best that I have ever had.  We loved the flavor!  Would definitely make again!
updated 12/30/12  I double the spices and put some of the spice mixture between the chicken and the skin.  I also put some carrots, potatoes and onions in the bottom of the pan with about 3/4 of a cup of water.  Turns out perfect every time.

LOVE IT!!! I didn't let it marinate overnight. 
I slid some butter under the skin. I also stuffed the chicken with onion and garlic and dusted the cavity with some extra seasoning. While roasting this, I put some quartered potatoes and some more onion in the pan to roast together. Love the gravy, too.

Excellent as others have said ... I was surprised based on the seasoning though aware of cinnamons way of enhancing flavor.  Minimal changes i made include ... Doubling the seasoning mixture (less than double sugar - don't like to use in anything except dessert!), placed pads of butter under skin, added onion to cavity along w/whole vs crushed garlic, and cooked breast side up.  The bird had a pop up timer and I have a hard enough time as it is knowing when it's done ... Did not want the timer to be ineffective being upside down & so close to the bottom of the pan. Still came out juicier than any other I've roasted and I believe it was quite well to almost well-over done!!  So glad i tried this one & will do it again.

Also added cut up fresh zucchini and yellow squash to the pan at the last 20 -30min ... They tasted DELICIOUS with the juices/seasoning.  Did not anticipate that at all ... Again, glad I experimented with something new!

Smells wonderful, now to just get it to taste as good as it smells.  The flavor is only on the skin, we are not a fan of skin, but even with the skin it just lacked flavor.

I love making this chicken. I also double the amount of spices. When roasting, I put in on a bed of sweet potatoes and russet potatoes cut into discs. As I dropped the temperature, I basted with melted butter to make the meat even juicier and to help cook my potatoes. Absolutely delicious!

This chicken is FANTASTIC!  My entire family loves this and I can't believe how juicy it is.  I think the key is roasting it breast side down.  I didn't have any issues with it becoming too brown either.  I have made this several times now and love it each time.

This was just crazy good!  I was shocked, mostly because of the unexpected ingredients..cinnamon, allspice, nutmeg..etc.   After reading other reviews I decided to double the spices and am glad I did.  I think it would not have been enough flavor otherwise.   I also decided not tolet it sit in the refrigerator overnight.  I did make a change in decided to cook it in a Reynolds cooking bag and added potatoes and carrots. I baked/cooked it a little slower at 350 degrees. It took a little longer, but was well worth the wait.  It got rave reviews from the family.  Thanks so much for sharing this!  Everyone should try it.

I am baking my chicken right now.  I followed the instructions and it acted like it wanted to burn.  I took it out of the oven and rubbed a little oil on it and covered it with a tent of foil.  Hopefully that will help.  Will rate after it's baked and eaten

This recipe is amazing!!  I wasn't sure about the mix of spices at first, but I was so intrigued that I had to give it a try.  My husband kept going back for seconds and thirds!  I followed the suggestions of some other reviewers to double the spice mixture, and to place some of the mixture under the skin.  I roasted a farm-raised chicken that I'd picked up at a local farmers' market, and wow, this was like 5-star dining!!

Great recipe--the cooking manner. I will certainly play with the ingredients more next time. This has incredible potential! The chicken turned out well--crispy and juicy, though I did err in that we waited more almost an hour after I took it out of the oven to eat it. I had rewarm it. I wonder whether that was the reason it lost its juice. Another thing: You've got to put something under the roasting rack that will catch the oil--chopped potatoes or something--because the fat will burn and cause your whole house to go smoky. Also, be sure to keep the chicken moderately away from the broiler burners--put it on the middle rack--I turned on the broiler setting later that night and it started sparking because of the fat that had splattered EVERYWHERE, covering  the burners and the entire oven. Lucky we have a self-clean feature.

Truly amazing! The flavors "pop" and the chicken is both crispy (on the outside) and juicy (on the inside.) Be sure to use a thermometer to check your temperature as the exterior appearance of the chicken will make you believe the chicken is farther along than it really is. I took the suggestion of other recipe users and was generous with the spices and covered every square inch of the chicken. You will not be disappointed!

Tried this recipe and it was ok.  I like other seasonings better though.  Followed the cooking temperatures and times from the recipe, but after letting it rest for 20 minutes, I cut into a leg portion to begin serving and saw it was far from done.  Back into the oven it went at 400 degrees for another 30 minutes and even then I questioned the doneness.  Probably won't make again.

I have been making this recipe for about a year now. It is superb! I add fresh ground black pepper and turmeric for an extra boost of flavor! Thanks again for such an epic recipe

Use the spices you like, but the cooking method is what counts. I learned to cook birds like this and especially turkeys from La Technique, Jacques Pepin. I do not preheat the oven, using high heat then lowering. If you wish, after 20 minutes the heat can be lowered one time to 170C. Try this with a whole prime rib as well, works great.

recipe must be a prank because the seasonings don't work with chicken at all.  I was thinking it sounded weird but went ahead and tried it because of all the great reviews.  But if you are reading this... DONT DO IT!

Excellent.  Took a bit longer than advertised but it was tasty and moist.  Served it with the recommended Chimichurri Sauce found on this site.

Made this last night.  It was delicious.  My husband always wants me to bake chicken longer to brown up the skin and normally that just makes it to dry.  Followed the recipe exactly, however I did double the rub and put some of the rub under the skin.  It looked beautiful and tasted fantastic.  It was  a little time consuming to be constantly reducing the oven temp and basting, but well worth the effort.  This is a keeper.

Really delish! I also doubled the spices - added a onion inside with the garlic - along with rubbing garlic and the spices under the skin.
Thanks!

Mmmmmm!!!!  Soooo gooood!  So easy and so delicious.  I used to be a fan of Costco chicken, however, I make sure to buy 1 whole chicken every couple weeks and roast using this recipe.  It's also nice knowing I'm buying a hormone free, vegetarian fed, free range chicken.  
Thanks for sharing this yummy recipe!

I had never roasted a chicken before and found this recipe. When I saw the ingredients I almost skipped it, but the number of reviews and stars made me take a closer look and after reading all the rave reviews I decided to give it a shot. I didn't have the 24 hours to let it marinate so mine only sat for about 3-5 hours. Also I hurrried through the instructions and mixed the crushed garlic with the seasonings, lol. I was a bit worried... Boy was it delicious! I read some of the other reviews said that they didn't like the taste, I think the crushed garlic mixed in with the seasonings could make a difference. I don't know but I love the way mine turned out and I will keep making it that way :D Next time around I might double the seasonings and see what happens

Wow!  I had given up on roasting my own chicken because they always ended up over cooked, dry and pretty unremarkable.  After trying this recipe, I am amazed; this was the best roasted chicken I have ever made - the flavors are very unusual, but work nicely, and the chicken was so perfectly cooked and moist, I will definitely be making this again.  I followed others' recommendations and increased the amount of seasoning used (doubled),  as my chicken was also much larger than the 4lbs recommended, I had to add time to the end (added 15 minutes) and my 6 lb chicken was perfectly cooked after resting for 20 minutes.  I just finished a salad using the leftover chicken and it was still so moist and flavorful.  I highly recommend this recipe to others who, like me, have struggled with roasting chickens and challenge them to give it another try – I don’t think you’ll be disappointed!

I made this chicken for Christmas dinner 2009 and everyone thought it was fantastic. I liked the fact that the spices were put on the chicken the night before so there was very little prep on Christmas day.  I do think that the next time I make this recipe, I will use a disposable pan since it really did a number on my roasting pan and it was very hard to clean.

Made this for a small college Thanksgiving dinner using a 6lbs chicken.  I have never cooked my own bird before and I was very worried about not taking it out in time.  It turned out amazing! so much better than a turkey.  I doubled the spices, stuffed with garlic and onions and set the bird breast down on some potatoes and carrots because I don't own a roasting rack. Cooked it an additional 30min at 350 degrees.  Thanks so much for this recipe!

I only marinated the chicken about 8 hours but put the rub under the chicken skin along with two of the garlic cloves, sliced.  My chicken was 4 3/4 lbs. and took about 10 minutes longer to cook.  Very moist.  I will probably increase the amount of rub mixture next time.

This recipe is great! I've used it a couple times now and my husband really likes it (not a chicken fan). Right before I cook it I also put lemon and onion inside the cavity as well as rub over the top of the breast meat. It keeps it really moist. I also add a little chili powder or Thai spice to the mix for a little extra kick.

The chicken browned nicely.  It was moist.  My biggest complaint was the splatter of chicken grease and the smoke it created in the 500 degree oven.  My oven is a mess and the house still smells like smoke the next day.

I made this chicken and folowed the direction exactly since it has very good reviews. Unfortunately, it's bland. The meat was juicy but the taste was just ok. Also, my chicken cooked longer than what it stated (even using a convection oven) It needs something else. I will not be making this again.

This was the most moist, yummy chicken I have ever eaten. I did double the spices and next time I will spend more time rubbing it on the inside. I am going to try and use this on chicken breasts and baking them in the oven.

I wasn't sure about these spices since I rarely use them in savory dishes, but it surprised me how good it was. Like others suggested, I doubled the spices (could've added more, even) and added onions for the cavity.

This is a GREAT recipe! I'm still a bit new to cooking, but this recipe was easy to follow. It turned out so good! It was crispy on the outside and very juicy in the middle. I didn't have garlic, so I stuffed the cavity with onions.  My husband loves this so much that it's his favorite meal for me to cook. He said that he can literally eat it every day! Thank you so much for this recipe!!!

This is a fantastic recipe, my first time roasting a chicken and it came out great!!! My husband loved it.. my 3 yr. old kept eating it no rice, no veggies, just the chicken... Thanks for sharing it and thanks for all the people who share their tips :) I doubled the spices as suggested and inserted the onion inside the chicken add up some carrots, celery and small red potatoes, i can't say how good it was i will give it 10 stars :)

I was skeptical about these spices, but have to say it was very good and unexpected.  The house spelled wonderful.  It was THE most juicy, moist chicken EVER!  I think it could use a few tweaks though.  For some reason I didn't get any juices so I had to add water for basting.  Also, mine took longer than 1 hour at the recommend temps.  I'm not quite sure what the smashed garlic in the cavity is for either?  I didn't taste any benefit to it.

I did not enjoy this recipe simply because I don't care for cinnamon with any kind of protein.  I've had cinnamon in chili, soups, and now chicken, and well, I don't care for the flavor it imparts, nor did my family.  Having said that, if I had left that out, this would have been a great recipe and I will make again, just without the spices.  If you think you might not or don't care for that flavor, leave it out and just try the chicken with the garlic and salt.

Delicious!  I made this for my husband awhile back and he loved it so much he decided to take on making it himself tonight.  We stuck to the recipe except when roasting.  We roasted it a 400 for 30 min and then turned the temp down to 350 for about 50 min.  Basted in its own juices!

This was the best whole chicken I have ever made.. I was kind of skeptical of the spices, but it turned out amazing. I used garlic powder inside of the chicken instead of whole garlic, only because I didn't have whole garlic.. and I tripled everything except the salt. I made a paste with olive oil and rubbed it under the skin as well as on the skin... I will be making this again.. Many times I'm sure

I baked a 4 lb whole chicken using this recipe. I doubled the recipe and LOVED the flavor- seriously great, but maybe a little on the salty side for me personally. I also added half an onion to the inside. The only thing I really didnt like was that my chicken looked burnt after 15 minutes in the 500 degree oven- I'm sure that was just the sugar burning, but I did cover it with foil after that, and only had to bake it 1 hour total. It was extremely moist and very delicious!

Maybe it was me but the chicken was a little to brown on the top.  So I pulled it out a little early and put some foil on any Dark spots.  But anyways I also cooked this chicken Breast side up and came out very tender and delicious.

Wow, I was skeptical but tried it and it came out perfectly.  The only things I did differently was that I used garlic powder instead of garlic cloves and added it to the other spices and I rubbed some more of the seasoning all over the chicken just before putting it in the oven.  The flavors were really amazing.

This chicken was so tasty! We doubled the spices as recomended and only used 3 cloves of garlic. Even if you put the spices on the skin you can taste it in the chicken. Instead of putting it in the oven we cooked it in our roaster from 2:00 pm to 8:30 pm. I often put the drippings over it and took some and glazed the carrots and potatoes  with it and was absolutley delicious, and the chicken was so tender it fell off the bones! Will make this again.

I've been cooking this recipe for a couple years now and I'm just getting around to review.  My family and I LOVE this recipe!  I always forget to prepare it then let is sit for hours, but I just double or triple the rub and put it on the bird.  It turns out spectacular every time.

I made 1-1/2 recipes of the spice rub.  I also put carrots, potatoes, and onions in the bottom of the pan and sat the chicken, breast side down, on top of them. I cooked it the exact time in the recipe.  This chicken turned out to be the most moist and juicy I've ever roasted.

I really enjoyed this recipe.  It ended up cooking a little longer because I used a larger bird but it was still nice and moist.  The color was beautiful.  Unfortuntely, the kiddo said it was 'yucky' but what does a 3 yoa know about chicken that's not a nugget? I served it with cornbread dressing and carrots.

My husband LOVED this, and he is hard to impress.  I ended up leaving the garlic out because I cooked it on this upright rotisserie stand that meant I could not put anything in the cavity.  I was thinking I would puree it and add it to the rub but I forgot and we loved it so much as is, I didn't want to mess with it when I made it again.  Really, really good.  The only change I made was to double all spices except salt,  I actually used a little less salt than the recipe originally called for. Hubby gives it two big thumbs up so this goes into the regular rotation. Thanks for a great recipe!

I doubled the spices/sugar too (as suggested by another reviewer).  The chicken began to brown too quickly so I covered it lightly with foil for the last 30 minutes.  It came out tender and juicy - family and guests loved it!

I followed a lot of the suggestions from other people.  It had great flavor.  I only made two additions:  gravy from the drippings and added sweet potato.  My wife, who does not usually eat gravy, found it really additive.  The flesh of the sweet potato tasted great and added sweetness but the peel needed to be removed as it seemed to absorb too much spice and became bitter.

Simply put.... my husband said this was the best Chicken I had ever cooked!  I doubled the spices like everyone else, added a celery stalk and an apple to the cavity.  Put butter slices under the skin and OMG!  was it ever good!  I was going to make gravy and didn't have any flour, so I added some milk, a little more of the ground clove spice and all spice and boiled it for about 5 minutes and it was awesome!

Wonderful bird! I doubled the spices like I had read on other reviews... it was a bit overwhelming, but still SUPER delicious. Next time, I won't double the spices... I'll make it just as it is called for.  Still a  5 out of 5 star rating!

I decided to try this recipe only because of the reviews. I thought the spices are for ham and not for chicken.  My gosh it wat interestingly very delicious. I Tripled the spices except used 1/8 tsp less of the cloves and I stuck and onion in the cavity and sprinkled garlic powder inside and outside the bird. This will be made again and again.

I have to give this a five star rating. It was definitely super juicy, which is totally what I wanted. Thank YOU!!! I do believe the cooking method (breast side down) has something to do with it). I too doubled the dry ingredients, although next time I won't double the salt. It doesn't need it. I didn't have time to marinate it for the recommended time, and marinated for 3 hrs. Next time I'll try the 12 hrs,but it came out soooo great anyway. I followed the time and temperature directions, except I did add a foil tent the last 1/2 hour to keep the skin from overcooking.  I don't eat the skin, but other family members love it and it helps keep in the seasonings and adds flavor. Soooo EXQUISITE!!!!! Thanks again Indriani

This is simply delicious. The whole house smells wonderful while it's cooking and the chicken is divine. I even make a huge pot of stock afterwards. From that, I made a delicious tortilla soup. My husband has already requested this chicken again.

This was the most moist, flavorful roast chicken I've ever made.  Thank you so much!  Took other cooks' advice and doubled the marinade and put an onion in the cavity.  Can't wait to have this again.

Absolutely delicious!  Added half an onion to the cavity with the garlic, but otherwise followed ingredients exactly.  I followed some other reviewers advice and cooked it in my slow cooker all day...then put it into a 400 degree oven for about a half hour to brown and crisp it up.  Very tasty, very moist, meat just fell off the bone.  Will be making this ALOT.  Thank you!

This is by far the best roasted chicken recipe I've tried. Just put a little aluminum foil lightly over the top of the chicken if you get too much smoke in the kitchen.

All I can say is WOW. After making this as is the first time- just to test the chicken and spice combination which I loved so much- I tweaked to perfect it. I doubled the spices, leaving out the nutmeg and used course salt instead of regular. I rubbed under the skin as well and marinated overnight. Then I put it on my indoor rotisserie for 90 minutes and added the drippings to a regular canned chicken gravy....I could eat the whole bird myself!! Everytime I have company for dinner this is what they request. Thanks for the flavorful, exciting way to roast a chicken!

What an interesting change of pace! My husband couldn't stop raving about the wonderful flavor of this chicken. Thanks to those who mentioned that it caused some smoke alarms to go off, I opened the kitchen window and turned on the ceiling fan, which kept the fumes at bay. In the future, I will line the roast pan or use a disposable one. I had to throw my pan away because I simply couldn't get the residue off of it. This will make an excellent Thanksgiving bird rub. Thanks Indriani for the delectable recipe! P.S. I served this chicken with the Honey Roasted Red Potatoes, submitted by Stephanie Moon. Nice accompaniment.

OMG! That was sooo good. With the leftovers, I made chicken salad- Yum! I made it again and forgot the garlic,, definitely needs the garlic. P.S. I put it in the slow cooker all day on low. It was so tender, it fell all apart. Was yummy, but not much to look at.

I thought this chicken was fabulous! I only let it sit for about half an hour before cooking it and it was great! I did let it cook about 10 minutes longer after reading other reviews.

I was so skeptical of this recipe!  What odd spices for chicken!   I figured hundreds of reviewers cannot be wrong so I tried it and am glad I did!   

I did double the spices except the salt.   The skin did turn very dark and smelled like it was burning but did not taste burnt at all.  Perhaps a simple fix would be to put the spices under the skin.

I found the spices to be quite subtle in the finished product.

I like how one reviewer said her husband says this dish "smells like Christmas" when it is cooking.  Yes it does!

ANother reviewer said be careful about your sides due to the different spices here.  I agree.  I served mine with plain mashed potatoes and corn.

I used a 6lb chicken.  I did not use a roasting rack bur just a roasting pan and I put the chicken breast side up.  I started at 475 then 425 and finished for 1.5 hours at 375.  Still very juicy after all that cook time - the basting is important!!!

Thanks for sharing this very odd and very wonderful recipe!!

This recipe was super simple. The chicken was juicy and delicious. My son and husband have both requested it again.

I did cook it about a half hour longer than recipe stated but it didn't register to 180 until I did.

Very good with double the spices, surprised it browned so well.  Different spices than I'm used to using makes a great unusual alternative to the spices I use.  Will definitely cook any poultry  breast side down from now on.

After reading so many positive reviews, I wanted to try this recipe. I too wondered about the spices and how they would go with chicken.  The sweet flavor result just didn't do it for me.  It was good, but I prefer a less sweet, more traditional roasted chicken.

The breast skin was a bit soft due to being upside-down (juices flowed downward) and I prefer crisp breast. The flavors were good but I should have turned over during the cooking process but followed the directions.  I will continue baking chicken at 425 degrees with cavity stuffed with olive oil, fresh rosemary and garlic with garlic, salt and olive oil rubbed on the exterior.  My family's favorite.

This recipe rocked!  I did not have time to let it sit for 24 hours so it was only in the fridge for like 2 hours but it was really good.  I did add some broth to the pan to help with the basting and I made gravy out of the broth & drippings from the chicken when it was done by just adding some corn starch.  Family really liked it and I will make again and try it with the 24 hour prep time next time.

Was in a rush so only marinated my half of a chicken for 1 hour, but it still came out nice and flavourful. Shall definitively keep the recipe but double the spices and replace the garlic that I don't like with chili powder to boost it up.

We loved this extremely moist chicken and will definitely make it again and again.  I doubled the spices as some other cooks suggested and it was delicious.  Be sure to cook breast side down and don't get nervous if the chicken starts to look quite dark after the first half hour.  My chicken was 5 pounds and sure enough, it cooked in just a few minutes over a total of one hour.  Thanks Indriani for a great recipe.

This recipe is FANTASTIC!! Like other reviewers, I doubled the spices except for the salt and sugar I also added onion inside the chicken. I cooked a 2 pound fryer chicken at the same cook temp and time that the recipe calls for and it turned out perfectly! This is definitely a keeper!

This chicken was incredibly simple and equally delicious!!! Whole family loved it. I doubled all the spices me rubbed under and over skin as well as in the cavity. Marinated for 24 hours. Served with sweet potatoes and asparagus. SO GOOD! Will definitely make again! ????

Wow. My 22 year old son said it best "I didn't know chicken could taste this good and be this moist". He asked if it was deep fried, he couldn't believe how crispy it was. He also said he could eat it every day. Then he asked if it was possible to make the Thanksgiving turkey this way. I followed others advice and doubled the spices. But instead of adding salt to the mixture of spices, I first rubbed the chicken with kosher salt. Then I rubbed the other spices on after. I did't have garlic, so I just added garlic powder to the spice mixture. I put 1/4 stick of butter in the chicken cavity. I added vegetables in the roasting pan that I happened to have around, sweet potato, yellow onion and whole green onions. My smoke alarms went off after about 10 minutes on 500 degrees, but I didn't even realize it was smoky in the room because it didn't look smoky. I read on other reviews after the fact that some people added water to the roasting pan so the sugars wouldn't burn on the pan. I'm going to do that the next time and I think it'll take care of the smoke alarm issue. I haven't bothered to write a single other review on this site although I use it all the time, but I felt compelled with this recipe because it truly rocked, it exceeded so significantly above what I thought was possible.

OMG!  It was so good!  I had to alter a couple of things.. I omitted allspice and ground cloves as I didnt have any.  Also, I put onions inside instead of garlic for the same reason.  It was awesome!  The skin was so crispy and delish.  Thanks so much!!!

The unusual set of spices attracted me to this recipe. I followed the recipe exactly, but wish I had increased the amount of seasoning. I was disappointed with the flavor which was basically bland. If I were to make this again, I would probably triple the amount of spices.

I will admit that I was very skeptical of using what I consider "baking spices" on chicken, but based on the reviews I decided to take a chance. It was well worth it! I've made this twice now in the last month and will be making it again soon. The first time I substituted ginger for nutmeg and it was also awesome. My husband also loved it!

This is the best whole chicken recipe I've ever made (and I've made a lot of chicken). It sounds weird but it's so amazing. Tonight I'm roasting sweet potatoes and brussel sprouts with it. Nom nom nom!!

Not only were we not fans of the flavor the chicken was nowhere near cooked enough after one hour. I will say this - the chicken stayed moist, which I was surprised at given the high cooking temp.

I have never commented before but I made this chicken yesterday and it was the best,juciest roast chicken I have ever made. The only change I made was I didn't have allspice so just left it out. I doubled the recipe as my chicken was about 5 lbs. Also,didn't marinate it overnite as I missed that part when reading. I baked it at 350 degrees for about 1hr and 45 minutes. I'm 75 years old and this is the best chicken I have ever made. Will be using this recipe often.

I agree with doubling the spices and mashing the garlic with the spices. It was best chicken I have had in a long time. I was wondering is anyone has tried using this recipe but cooking the chicken on a rosterrie?

Loved this recipe.  It was so easy.  I did double or triple the spices and rubbed the inside of the chicken with them as well.  In addition to those spices, I went the savory route as well adding garlic powder, smoked paprika, turmeric and black pepper.  I didn't baste the chicken while it was baking.  Instead I waited till I took it out of the oven, basted it several times, then let it wait the 20 minutes the recipe called for.  The breast meat was very tender and juicy.  Will definitely be making this again.

Everyone loved it. The 5.5 lbs chicken was succulent and cooked to perfection. May use a little more salt, next time. Doubled the spices per other reviews.

I made this by following the recipe exactly.  I should have broiled it at the end to brown the breast.  My husband loved it, he said he's had roasted chicken many times but this is the first time with this kind of flavor so he's asked me to make this again.

I did not use the spices listed for this recipe, however I did cook it in a roasting pan without a rack and I must say it is imperative that you put water into the bottom of the pan because the fat will burn and smoke up your entire house.

Fantastic!  Double the spices and rb all over chicken and under the skin on both sides.  Stuffed with the garlic and some onions and I put baby carrots, onions and potatoes in the bottom of the pan.  The veggies were outstanding- and the chicken too!  Loooooove this recipe.

The chicken came out nice, but the spice blend was a little too sweet for my taste. I'd do a different spice rub, next time.

My oven was clean.  The 500 degrees was to hot, the 450 degrees was to hot.  The alarm went off the fire truck came.  The chicken was delicious!  Should have given the firemen some chicken! I followed the recipe exactly.

My husband thinks this is the best chicken he's ever tasted and has requested it be a weekly item! I haven't had cloves on hand, so I eliminated those and used season salt instead of allspice (again, only because it's what I had). The nutmeg and cinnamon really does it!

My husband calls this the "homerun" of chicken.  This is hands down the most delicious and amazingly moist recipe I have ever made!  I usually change up recipes a little but this one is absolutely fantastic as is.  As shared by previous reviews, I was nervous to put cinnamon and sugar on chicken...but WOW!  This has become a family favorite and will certainly make time and time again :-)

Great flavor. I put sweet potatoes, carrots and apples, covered it and put it in the oven for a couple hours. The flavors were perfect together.

Tried this today and it was really good. Had guest over and the only thing I regret is not having enough for seconds. I did double the seasoning (except the salt) and stuffed the cavity with a small onion along with the garlic. I will be adding this to the meal rotation.

AMAZING AND SO EASY! 
My family and I loved this recipe. The chicken had great flavor. I cut up one piece of celery and put it in the cavity of the chicken to keep moisture in the meat. Other than that I followed the recipe to a T and it turned out wonderfully. I will defiantly be making this again!

This was a very easy to follow recipe.  I didn't have the 24hrs to wait for the seasonings to meld into the bird but I did leave it to marinate about 3 hours and the flavor was very good.  The house smelled wonderful as it was cooking!  My dogs were going crazy and were literally underfoot whenever I went to the oven to change the temps and baste. It was only 3 of us but everyone ate until they felt like they were going to burst! I doubled the spices and stuffed an onion into the cavity as suggested in many of the reviews put red potatoes and a cup of chicken broth in with the pan drippings when I brought the temp down to 425.  Also made sweet dinner rolls from this site to go with it.  My family was so anxious to eat that I didn't even have the chance to make a veggie as well. The spices at first seem odd for roasting a chicken, but try it.  You won't be disappointed!

This was just okay.  I followed the directions exactly except didn't let it sit overnight.  I'm glad I didn't because the spice mixture wasn't awful but it wasn't really my thing.  I will say however that my *small* chicken was exactly done and very moist when cooked this way.  I'm thinking a larger chicken might have been undercooked.

I didn't have time to let it sit for 24 hours (more like 1.5 hours) and it was very good. I also used a 7.5 lb chicken and increased the spices proportionately. The combination of flavors (seasoning) is very good and I would expect it to be even better if I let it sit overnight.

I LOVE THIS CHICKEN!! I don't even measure the spices except for the cinammon and the sugar. Everything else I just pour directly onto the chicken. And I put the garlic in the cavity before I marinate in the fridge. I make it all the time and my husband loves it. :) Great recipe!

Seasoning is good, but not great. I wish it had a bit more tang to it. Cooking method was fantastic. I used drumsticks instead of a whole chicken and turned out well.

This was a big hit and I am making a jar of the spices so that I can do this with regularity.  This will be THE roasted chicken in the house. I served it with the best stuffed mushrooms, and yellow squash with onions.  The wine was a nice topper.  The flavors in the wine complemented the spice of the chicken wonderfully.

Tastes delicious, super moist. Barely a reason to cook a whole chicken any other way. I also stuffed garlic cloves beneath the skin over the breasts, legs, and thighs.

This is the first time I've taken the time to review a recipe... because it is worth it. It has changed the way we do chicken in our home completely.

We now look for whole chicken on sale and keep the freezer stocked. Our family of three eats on this chicken for three days. Perfect.

I like to vary the recipe (cavity stuffers) from time to time, but the ingredients that are staples are the spices (all doubled as per other reviewers). I have pulled back a bit on the salt and only once have I done the overnight thing. 

Always a hit!!! Thank you!!!

Absolutely wonderful recipe. I too didn't marinate overnight and it still turned out flavorful.  I had brown sugar on hand and used that instead and didn't have cloves, however the taste was still spectacular.  This is the 3rd whole roasted chicken recipe I've tried and so far the best. I used to be afraid of cooking a whole chicken, now I am truly looking forward to debuting this to more people than my family!  Thank you!

May be the best chicken ever. At the end of the cooking time, the thighs were still underdone but I wasn't too surprised because we added onion quarters to the chicken cavity, which add to the cooking time. So, we flipped the bird over and roasted breast side-up for another 30 minutes. It came out perfect this time! I only let it rest for 12 minutes and had to carve b/c the kids were howling for food, but the chicken was still incredibly juicy and the meat had amazing flavor - reminiscent of Indian or Middle Eastern flavors. I think next time we'll bake in the oven and finish on the grill... yum.

First time cooking a whole bird, this was wonderful!  I forgot to cook it breast side down, but it was still very moist and juicy.  Hubby and 1 yr old loved it, I made it exactly by the recipe!

The spices used in this recipe are great, but you definitely have to double them to get the flavor to permeate the entire bird.  After reading about the smoke and burning eyes issues, I opted not to cook at such high temps.  Instead, I baked at 350 for almost  2 hours.  the chicken came out very moist, tender and full of flavor. I did not have any onions, so I put a lime in the cavity along with the garlic.  It went very well with the other spices.

This was one of my first times roasting a whole chicken and it came out alot better than I would have thought I could do! The seasoning blend was perfect when doubled! I also put a few cloves of chopped up garlic under the skin. My house did get a little smokey but this was a very moist and delicious chicken. Thanks!

This is a surprisingly tasty way to cook a chicken! I will add this, however, my spices burned in the 500 degree heat oven, so the skin was blackened (unlike the picture shown here in the website). Not sure why that seems to have happened only to me... but the chicken didn't suffer and tasted delicious. It did make the house smoky, which stung my eyes, so I probably won't bake it in the oven again for that reason only. We have a rotisserie, so I'll stick to that method (maybe try it that way next time).

Very simple and very tasty!  Though the splattering juices at 500 destroyed my oven.  :)  The spices were unusual and even my picky eaters loved it.  I (1) doubled the spices (except the salt) and (2) added half an onion inside.  It was done after an hour.  We roasted 2 of them and I'm glad we did!  Now I have enough meat for a week and enough bones to make stock.  Thank you Indriani!

I LOVE this recipe.  The chicken is so flavorful and not overpowering.  I stuff half and orange and lemon in the cavity along with some fresh herbs from my garden.

Tender and flavorful!  This was a simple and easy way to make a roasted chicken  I used a little bit of magic bouquet to brown the skin and add a little flavor, but otherwise was delicious!  Chicken was so juicy!

Made the chicken with just a few modifications.  First, we doubled the seasoning blend and added granulated garlic to the mix.  We also placed some minced garlic into the cavity of the bird.  We baked the chicken according to the directions but did need an additional 10 minutes of baking time (our bird was closer to 5 lbs).  Bird came out so tender and juicy!  The spices used gave the chicken such a wonderful taste.  Will definately make this again and might even triple the spices this time for even more flavor.

Great recipe. I just used minced garlic instead of cloves ( cloves are so strong ) and I put garlic powder in the cavity with salt & pepper.

Surprisingly delicious.  I filled the cavity with a quartered orange, lime, onion, and crushed garlic cloves.  I doubles the spice (except the salt). I rubbed the chicken with olive oil before rubbing on the spices. I used one cup of chicken stock to baste.  Mmmm.

amazing... wonderful recipe. I had to cook the chicken quite a bit longer than stated and actually turned it breast side up so the back wouldnt burn (out of foil!). ended up tasting out of this world.    i did put some potatoes, carrots and onions in the bottom with some water and they were prolly the best part! I did put in some more water half way through cooking ... they turned out amazing. making this again in a few days for my mom who is visiting us.   thank you -

Very easy and really yummy.  I've made this 3 times now.  The spices seemed a bit odd for chicken but it worked out so well.  It reminds me of moroccan dishes.  I chopped up carrots, potatoes, and an onion and put it in the bottom of the pan and just rested the chicken breast side down on top of the veggies.  By the time the chicken's done, the veggies are nice and flavorful.  Definitely a keeper.

Very good, however, I followed the suggestions of the other reviews by doubling the spices, crushing garlic on top too and pouring about a cup of stock in the pan first.

Before making this I butterflied the chicken for later ease of cutting and also faster baking.  I found this recipe before making dinner so I used these seasonings but didn't marinate.  Turned out the most moist baked chicken I've ever made!  Since it baked faster I did 500 for 15 min then 425 for about 30 more.

One of the most moist chicken I have ever tasted and we loved it.   I did end up making a few changes as I went along.  Because there wasn't enough fat/juice to baste the chicken with, I basted it with chicken stock which added extra flavor to the chicken and to the drippings.  Like others suggested, I added diced onions in the cavity along the garlic.  I also added several lemon wedges for extra flavor and moisture.  Next time I try this recipe, I would most definitely rub the bird with either butter or oil before I add the spice.  I also needed to lower the oven rack because at 450 F, my poor bird was getting scorched!  I would also extend the cooking time at least 20 min. longer.  It was still one of the best recipe.  I would not have come up with this combination of rubs for chicken on my own and am so glad to have come across it.  Thanks for sharing a great recipe!

Amazing! I didn't marinate overnight and doubled the rub ingredients. I also added a few more garlic cloves and added a 1/2 an onion in the cavity. Next time I would definitely add 1/2 the salt.

Excellent - the chicken was so tender but I thought that there needed more spices and the cook time was not long enough.  Inorder to have the skin brown up nicely, I rubbed butter on the bird before adding the seasonings.  Also, I thickly sliced (about a 1/2 inch) some potatoes and placed it in the bottom of the pan.  I also dissolved a chicken bouillon cube in about a cup of water and poured it over the potatoes before I put on the rack with the chicken.  I added more of the spices and added some cayanne pepper as well.  I put more garlic in the bird but I also stuffed it with quartered onions.  The remaining onions were placed next to the chicken and they also got a great flavor.

I used a 7.5lb oven stuffer roaster, and was surprised how quickly it cooked.  I just did 15 min at 500, 15 at 450, and an hour and a half at 425, although it was probably done after only an hour.  The meat was moist, but mostly just tasted of garlic.  I doubled the spices but didn't have time to let it sit overnight and didn't put them under the skin.  My husband said the skin was good, but it was getting black so I covered it with foil after 20 minutes at 425.  My problem was the same some other reviewers had- a smoky, burning roasting pan.  I kept adding water to the bottom of the pan, which seemed to help, but my roasting pan is probably pretty burnt up.  Not sure how else to get rid of that problem, short of cooking veggies underneath.

I made this tonight for my family of five.  I used a 4.5 lb chicken.  I marinated it in the rub (doubled the spices including the salt)... rubbed it inside and out and under the skin... sat in a ziplock bag for about 5 hours.  Tucked orange and onion inside the cavity.  In the bottom of the roast pan I put sweet potatoes, potatoes, celery, red onion, and carrot sprinkled with garlic salt.  I added a bit of water to avoid the smoking problem... there was none.  The rack I used to place the chicken in stood above the pan, and the drippings fell onto the veggies.  I tented the chicken with foil for the last 30 minutes.  I made the chimichurri to go on the side... dipped Hawaiian rolls into it along with offering it as a condiment to the chicken.  My family loved it!  Oh, my GOSH!  I spent $3 on the chicken itself... tasted like 4-star restaurant cuisine.  Thank you!

This was my first attempt at roasting a whole chicken, and my whole family loved it.  I was skeptical at first, but the rave reviews made it impossible not to try.  I doubled the spices omitted the allspice.  I will definitely make this again.

Like others I was a little freaked out about putting 'baking' spices on meat.  I could not believe how awesome this turned out!!  I, too, placed a foil tent on the chicken a while into cooking for fear of the skin burning.  I don't care for skin, and the thought of eating it disgusts me, but I had to try it.  It was fantastic.  My husband and I found ourselves tearing into the bird like some starving savages.  We LOVED this recipe and will try it this summer on a turkey, as suggested by another member.  We will also try it on a cut up fryer next time, rather then trying to rip apart the chicken at the dining room table, like a couple of beasts.

Doubled the seasoning as others recommended.  Rubbed some under the skin. Marinated it about six hours.  I am surprised that no one mentioned the high temperature in the oven tends to burn the skin and I had to put a foil tent on top of the chicken to prevent the skin from being burnt.  This was one of the best chickens we have ever had.  We also enjoyed it with  the Chimichurri Sauce.

I think the method here is the key to how juicy this bird  comes out. I have a  convection roast option on my oven so I think that also helped   make a juicy bird with a crisp skin.  Generally  convection  cookingn means  you  reduce the heat by about 25 degrees  but mine adjusts  automatically. I  also roasted breast side down and  the  last  15  minutes roasted  breast  up let sit  for 15 minutes  then ate. I also did  a  brine - a  really important step  I  think in getting a juicy bird. I read the article  about roasting chicken on allrecipes and it also said to let  the bird soak for at the  most 6 hours no more and  no less   than an  hour  - also let it air   dry  in your fridge for at least an hour or overnight.

I've made this twice..delicious! I've never had roast chicken so tender and juicy. The key to that is the cooking method. I'm going to try it this weekend with different seasonings even though we love the flavor of the seasonings called for in the recipe. No matter how you season it if you use this method of cooking it will turn out amazing.

This is a great recipe. It is a great homestyle meal with roasted potatoes and carrots. The secret to a moist chicken is to bake it breast side down half the time and breast side up the rest of the time.

Second time making this recipe and it was even better this time. Marinated a few hours, not overnight. I had a 5# chicken, cooked for 20 mins @ 500 and 450, then about 50 mins to reach 180. Put potatoes and carrots in the bottom of the pan - YUM! Doubled rub and added onion to cavity. This is a family favorite!

I first experimented with the chicken recipe and my family loved it.  I decided to try it with the Chimichurri sauce this time and , oh boy.
My wife was laughing with excitement.  I threw in chopped carrots and cauliflower together with the chicken and they were great having been marinated in the juices from the chicken and the ingredients.  After I advised my wife and father-in-law to spread the sauce over the chicken,  it was OVER!
Thank you, this recipe is a definite mind-blowing keeper.

Doubled the spices to rub both sides of the chicken. Followed other peoples advice-put an onion and garlic in the cavity of the chicken. Put spices under the skin-we don't eat the skin. Cooked as directed and it came out very juicy! No smoke in my house like others. Also put celery, carrots, and potatoes around the chicken and let them soak up the juices. The only thing wrong was that one of the spices is a bit overwhelming-Allspice maybe. The potatoes soaked up the juices the best and they were incredible. Will use less of one of the spices, once I figure out which one is too much, each time I make this meal. Will also use more potatoes and less carrots and celery around the chicken just because they were super yummy!

This was a very unique flavor and a nice change from the usual. I did double the seasoning including the salt. I put mine in the pressure cooker with 1 cup of water for 25 minutes. It was so good! but even better was the gravy. I took the juice from the chicken, let it come to a boil on med-high, whisked together 1 cup milk and 3 Tablespoons flour. then slowly poured the mixture in while whisking.  Fabulous!!

this recipe has a great basic technique for seasoning and then cooking the chicken.  I cooked exactly as the directions said, but did double the spices as others suggested.  The flavors were quite different, but good. i thought it was a little too salty, probably fr doubling the spices. I want to make it again with a spice rub that is of a more traditional taste (salt, pepper, garlic, onion powder -- one could try just about any seasoning combo) and i will let it marinate and cook it with the different temperature times as stated in the recipe as i think that is the secret to this chicken.  Also, at some point towards the end of cooking, i will flip the chicken over so that the skin gets crunchy there too.  I have to say the crunchy skin was good and my husband and boys liked it and said i should make it again.  Oh yes, i added potatoes and carrots to the pan and those were absolutely yummy and crunchy and coated with the sweet/salty mixture because of basting.  they were delicious!  Thanks for such a unique recipe!

I cooked two whole chickens using this recipe. The chicken turned out very moist and juicy. I added half an onion and some 4" pieces of celery inside each chicken. It had a good flavor, but the nutmeg and cinnamon were a little odd-tasting. Next time I'll try this using the Creole Seasoning Blend from AllRecipes. With 2 kids, I don't add the cayenne, and I use smoked paprika, and the flavor is wonderful. Thanks for the post...it was definitely "something different"!

I have tried so many roasted chicken recipes and this is truly the best!  I never had a chicken this moist before.  The spices made the kitchen smell wonderful while it was baking. My husband is a rather picky eater and does not like to eat leftovers. He loved it so much he's eaten much of the leftovers. My only deviations were substituting garlic powder for the crushed garlic. I also didn't have to cook it as long as the recipe stated. I did cook it until it reached 180 F; it's so important to monitor the temperature of the meat while it's cooking.

I really loved this recipe. The house smelled wonderful while it was cooking. My kids liked it too. My husband said it was ok...so I guess he would give it a 3 - 4 rating.  The next time I make wings, I will add a batch with these spices.

I followed the advice of the previous reviewers by doubling the spices and putting an onion in the cavity w/ the garlic. I let the rub stand for 6 hours vs. overnight.  The main thing I changed was the cooking method. My roasting pan was way too large for my chicken, so I substituted my cast iron dutch oven. I added a small amount of water (1/4 cup?) to the pan, but I probably didn't need that. I kept the temperature at an even 375 the entire time I cooked it. I basted several times. I was amazed at how wonderful this turned out! The gravy I made with the drippings was equally fabulous! Definitely will make this again!

Really good, really different. My roasting pan was too big so to stop the drippings from burning I added a can of chicken broth to the bottom and some butter. Also had to cook it quite a bit longer. My husband said it tasted like the holidays, but didn't realize what it was. It made delicious gravy, having leftover mashed potatos and gravy for lunch as I type. Served with honey ginger carrots and Caramel Apple Pie from this site.

I made this twice: once without allspice, nutmeg, and ground cloves and the second time with them. Both turned out very good (extremely juicy!). My husband and I agree the first one was a little better, but maybe that's only because I bought the cheap spices to make the second one (nutmeg, cloves, and allspice). I’m sure the more expensive ones are better. Either way, I would make both again, and my husband requests it be made every week. **Tips: I doubled the recipe, and tented the pan the first half hour. I also rubbed the spices all over the skin, under the skin, and a lot inside the cavity. Had to cook it for about 15-25 minutes longer for an internal temp of 180. Baste about 3 times. Dark crispy skin with juicy meat. The fat drippings were used for sauce and was to die for!

This was very good, but I think I prefer traditional seasonings for roasting a chicken.  However, it was great for leftovers on a salad.

This was a delicious chicken recipe, however next time I think I will cut the salt in half.  Also, just using what I had on hand, I used allspice and then 1/2 tsp of pumpkin pie spice.  This just added a little ginger to the mix and it was delicious.  Thanks, I will make it again and again.

I have made this several times now and it's super.  You can marinate it for 5 hrs. or more and it's just as good.  Tonight, the dogs smelled the carcass and promptly stole my leftover.  Smart dogs!!

This was the most tender and juicy chicken I've eaten anywhere - it was very good! I had to cook mine much longer and also turn it over in order for the breast side skin to get brown. As good as it was, I do have to say that the seasonings are a little distracting. Good, but distracting.

I thought this was awesome.  It was juicy on the inside and slightly crispy on the outside.  I think padding it dry slightly before rubbing all the ingridents on the chicken might have helped to maintain more of the flavor on the chicken, but it was great.

I have made this recipe dozens of times now and it is still my favourite chicken recipe.  I take the skin off my chicken and put the rub right on the chicken flesh.  It's so tasty, you don't miss the skin.

This chicken is simply fantastic.  I agree that it's closer to a fall flavor mix, but I would use it any time of year and not change the recipe.  To those who over cooked your bird, I would suggest investing in a thermometer and increase the time by five minutes if the thermometer hasn't reached 180 degrees.  The chicken should be moist and the meat should fall off the bone.  Fabulouse!  My mouth wattered.

I LOVED this!! I didn't have enough time to marinate, so I didn't- at all-I doubled the spices and then followed others recommendations and cooked the whole bird (6 lbs) in the slow cooker all day and then did 30 mins in a 400 degree oven to crisp it up.  This is the way to do a bird!  Even though I didn't marinate at all- except for the bird being in the slow cooker all day- this was FABULOUS!  This will be a standard at our house now- it's soooooo simple, and sooooooooo delicious!  YUM!!  FYI- I served this with a 2004 EXP Syrah and it was the perfect wine for this chicken!  Ahhhhhhhhhh...........

This recipe was good only on the side where I rubbed the seasonings.  I failed to rub them on the underneath side, the breast, so when we went to eat it, of course, there was no seasoning at all on what we ate, the breast.  Also, we didn't get much of the garlic flavor.  Is there a secret to making the garlic stand out more?

EXCELLENT!!  Chicken stays very moist and has such a wonderful flavor.  How handy that it only takes an hour!  I've made the recipe multiple times exactly as it directs, and I wouldn't change a thing.  I have started to line my roasting pan with aluminum foil, however, as the pan gets to be quite a MESS!  Wonderful fall flavors, but perfect for any time of year! *UPDATE- I can't tell you how many times I've made this, and how many copies of the recipe I've handed out!  It's so easy, and works every time - EXCEPT once:  I usually make two 3 to 4 pound chickens if we're having a dinner party, but once I tried just using one 7 pound chicken.  To my surprise, it tasted nothing like the normal recipe!  Maybe it was too thick for the flavors to sink in...I don't know, but I'll never use anything more than a 3 or 4 pound chicken again!

Great recipe. I concur on the chimichurri addition also, though my wife preferred it as is. The leftovers made excellent sandwiches.

This is the ONLY way I will ever cook chicken now. I have never had a roast chicken turn out till I did it this way. I added a few of my own spices and didnt let it sit. But it was amazing. We almost ate the whole thing in one night!

Very simple and very good. My husband commented while it was cooking that it smelled so good, as did a friend who visited just as it was being taken from the oven. The meat ooozed juices as we cut into it. The aroma and flavor was exotic and delicious. My only problem was that the inner part of my chicken was not quite done, even though I gave it an extra 5 minutes in the oven. This could be due to the fact that I had a slightly larger chicken than the recipe called for, and/or due to an aging and possibly faulty oven. I will definitely try this recipe again and again.

MMMM! This was awesome! I didn't have a roast pan so I just put it on a pan covered with foil and followed the directions.  At the very end I upped the oven to 325 and took off the foil so it could brown.  The chicken was cooked PERFECTLY through! Thanks so much! Next time I will try the sauce.

YUMMY!!!! Turned out GREAT!!! I was looking for a quick recipe to roast a chicken and this is it!  I obviously skipped the overnight marinating but I'm sure that would have just made it better... I threw all the spices together and rubbed it on and an hour later it was done!  I didn't have allspice and I used seasoned salt instead (I know not a great substitute but it turned out great!)... my 3 year old ate both drumsticks and half the breast!  Everyone loved it!  Thanks for the great recipe!!! A keeper!

This is excellent.  I did not marinade over night but i did double the seasonings exactly as recipe stated. Roasted as recipe stated but did add foil for the last 10 mins. 
I peeled and chunked 3 HUGE carrots, 1 1/2 large yellow onions and 3 stalks of celery. The juices from the chicken mingled with the seasonings/rub were amazing with the veggies. Will make again and again.

My entire family loves this.  Changes:  I lift the skin up and rub the spices underneath as well as on top to provide more flavor, especially for those who prefer not to eat the skin.  I use 1 t. garlic salt in place of the salt.  Also, to prevent it from burning, I only place the minced garlic  under the skin.

First, I love this recipe! We raise our own chickens, so it's very important to me to have a roasted chicken recipe I can trust and this is that recipe. I always double the spices (salt too!) and sometimes I don't let the chicken sit with the rub on it for as long as recommended. 

Second, I would caution those that make gravy from their chicken drippings that this recipe does not make my favorite flavor of gravy. Sometimes I use a more traditional (more savory) rub on my birds when I know I'm going to be making gravy. I still use the roasting method in this recipe, though!

I made this numerous times over the years, my photo was the first one I think (the last in the album) Allrecipes ruined the photo somehow, it used to look much nicer :(. I seem to recall that the rub was supposed to be rubbed beneath the skin. I will always do it this way as it is much more effective. Fabulous recipe, your house will small AMAZING! I put veggies in after the first high-heat blast, yum!!

It deserves a 4.5 and I didn't have all the spices.  Actually this is my second time and it's delicious!  Only used salt, sugar and chopped garlic with a sprinkling of a chicken rub over the outside.  Followed everything else and very juicy and delicious.

I love this recipe, it’s always a huge hit a my house. A few tiny things I do differently, I add an additional tsp of salt to the inside of the bird (just a habit I picked up years ago after I learned they do that at Swiss Chalet lol) I don’t leave the bird overnight with the seasoning, simply because I’m not that organized, so it usually gets seasoned about an hour before. VERY important, when roasting, put a little bit of water in the bottom of the pan to avoid smoking and sugar scorching your pan. (Learned this the hard way :P) I love this chicken and use the left overs in a yummy Smoky BBQ chicken Mac and cheese recipe.

The recipe is perfect. My problem was I forgot  that our small oven runs 25* hot.  I noticed my mistake quickly.  I also didn't do all the herbs and let it sit 24hrs, I just pulled the skin back and put butter and sliced garlic under the skin, and stuffed the cavity with about 20 garlic cloves.  Just a few minor changes under a time crunch, but it still turned out so moist and flavorful.

I made this but really only followed the roasting directions. I had already salted and peppered the inside of the bird with sea salt and coarse ground pepper, threw in 5 garlic cloves to the cavity along with fresh rosemary and thyme from my garden. I then oiled the skin with olive oil, more salt and pepper, along with a poultry rub I have and more thyme. It marinated in the frig for 24 hours, then roasted according to these directions. Easy and delicious! Much better than store bought roasted chickens as I know exactly what herbs and spices are in and on it!

Love these spices on the chicken. We like strong seasoning on our meats so I doubled the seasoning which I put on the chicken the night before. I cooked it at 350 degrees for 1 1/2 hours in a Dutch oven with the lid on and basted it every 1/2 hour with the juices.

I love the spices and flavors in this recipe.   I often make it using chicken pieces (breasts or legs etc.) I am a lazy cook and don't bother measuring.  I don't feel like you can overdue the flavors. I also don't give myself time to marinate the chicken overnight so I use a slow cooker and I get a great result.

When I do a whole chicken I make soup with the carcass  using the following recipe only I boil it first in a half a pot of water and add some chicken stock for more flavor: http://allrecipes.com/recipe/229937/spiced-tomato-soup/?internalSource=recipe%20hub&referringContentType=search%20results&clickId=cardslot%2028

I'll start with a confession: I didn't season the chicken at all as the recipe specifies so I can't comment on the flavour. I was looking for a fast way to cook a whole chicken and the scheme in this recipe is amazing. I'll never spend more than an hour cooking a chicken again. It produces the most incredibly moist chicken ever. Ever. I'll try the seasoning as recommended and update.

I doubled the rub. And make sure I rub inside the cavity. I also used onions and garlic to put inside the cavity. I cooked an air chilled chicken, and it didn't make a lot of drippings. I skipped the basting because I didn't get enough drippings. Our NYC apartment was so smoky, so, I learned to put a little bit of chicken stock at the bottom so the pan won't burn. We didn't have ventilation, and our placed smelled like chicken for 2 days! But it's worth it. I have made it twice and it was so juicy and moist and tasty!

I used the spices, it sat in the fridge for 5 hours, then used a roasting bag to cook the chicken. Put some butter on top and inside with the garlic. This was the best I have ever roasted. I'm always looking for different recipes. Not anymore.

This is THE.BEST. roasted chicken that I have ever made.  Actually, I think it's the best roasted chicken that I've ever eaten.  We make this regularly in our home now.  Make sure to follow the cooking/temperature directions exactly, and it will turn out great!  One time, I accidentally started cooking the chicken at 450 instead of 500 and it came out dry because the juices didn't seal inside.

Add me to the list of those who had my doubts about the combination of ingredients, but proceeded with preparing it thanks to all the positive reviews.  Boy, was I glad I did!  This is truly the tastiest roasted chicken I've ever eaten.  I removed the backbone to butterfly my chicken.  After reading reviews, I doubled the spices except for salt and rubbed under the skin (except for the legs, where I rubbed the spices on top).  I refrigerated in a ziplock bag for the full 24 hours.  I placed breast side down on a roasting pan sprayed with PAM and added several cups of water to the bottom of the pan. Boy, am I glad I did.   There was literally no water (only about a half a cup of drippings) left when I opened the oven to pull the chicken out, so I can see that the pan might have been a bear to clean otherwise.  I had no problems with smoking and thanks to the water, the clean-up was easy.  Since I added the water, I didn't open the oven to baste.  Thirty minutes before my chicken was due to come out of the oven, I put in a pan of cubed sweet potatoes to roast and turned them over after 15 minutes and returned to the oven.  They were the perfect side dish.  I made the chimichurri sauce for steaks off of this website. We added just a small amount to our chicken and it really enhanced the spices and flavors.  My family is asking for me to make it again this week!

This is one of my all time favorite recipes! Even with out basting it is moist and delicious! I sometimes flip the bird to let the beast brown and crisp up. I usually skip leaving it in the fridge for 24 hours. I put the rub on and garlic in about 30 min before cooking and to let the bird come more to room temp. My husband and kids give it a big thumbs up too!

Oven at 500 degrees for 15 minutes burned my chicken, maybe lower starting temp a bit.

I'm nightshade toxic so I was thrilled to find a recipe with no nightshade spices in it! I made this with my electric roaster and it came out excellent, flavorful and moist. I will definitely be keeping this recipe, and if it isn't spicy enough for your taste the option always remains to slather it with any sauce you desire. I thought it was amazing all by itself though!

I used the roasting method only, with a different chicken rub recipe.  This method roasts the chicken perfectly! The skin was perfectly crispy and flavorful, and the meat was so moist and juicy!  I made sure to baste the chicken with chicken broth every time I changed the oven temp.  The only issue was that with the high heat, the drippings in the pan burnt, so I couldn't use them for basting or for the gravy.  Hence, the reason for 4 stars instead of 5.

I'm making this tonight, but I just wondered if someone in charge could possibly fix the cooking time--it says 1 day, 35 hours, and 35 minutes. And that's a LOOOOONG time! Will check back in after we have it tonight.

I just used a chicken thigh and leg and guestimated the seasonings. I did put the garlic under the skin this time because I found out it burns and taste pretty gross. I made this with some mashed potatoes and for a guy trying to cook it came out pretty great. Thanks for the recipe.

This was a great recipe! It takes a bit of patience as you're slowly tapering the heat so monitoring is required BUT the work was worth it. Also, I did my best to use the drippings but they were not tasty or good which is fine because I really did it for the protein, not the gravy.

Made chicken exactly as shown.  Was crazy moist and delicious.  And so easy to make.  Did not try sauce this time but will try it later.  Chicken cooking technique is better than a rotisserie chicken.

Took the suggestions to double the spices and added onion to the cavity. I tented it with 20 minutes to go. And used convection bake .... I didn't stay at the higher temps quite as long as indicated.  The result?  The family liked it.

My husband loved it. He was signing my praises! A little on the sweet side for me, I had a hard time finding a side to complement the chicken. The only change I made to the recipe was that under the skin I added butter so I didn't have to roast it upside down. Also, I quadrupled the ingredients. Overall, this one I will definitely make again.

I made this for Easter exactly as written. It was very moist and delicious! In fact, it is very similar to what my mother used to make when I was a child - and so it was extra special. Thank you for sharing your recipe.

Made this 2 nights ago. The temp was way too high and the chicken smoked up my house. After all of that it wasn't nearly done all the way through. I will try this again with adjusted temps. Flavor was good!

I followed the recipes as is but cooked the chicken on a terra cotta vertical poultry roaster. It took an additional 20 minutes to reach 180 (but that could be my ovens fault) and I let it rest for 20 minutes. It came out perfect. I especially like the recipe it included spices that you normally find in any kitchen. I hand raise my chickens and we occasionally give some away as "gifts".  I will be including this recipe in the bag.

I doubled the spices too. I mixed 1/2 of the spices with cloves for the inside. Outside just the spices were rubbed on. Wonderfully moist and delicious. Fridged for only 5 hours. Will be making this again and again

I have made this recipe several times and every time it comes out perfect. My 3 yr old who can be picky devours it. Tonight I added potatoes and carrots to roasting pan once I dropped temp down to 425.  They came out perfect! I will use this recipe for years to come. Don't let the sugar and cinnamon scare you it's delicious.

Amazing!! Made this last night and this recipe was super easy to follow. I ended up doubling my spices like others recommended and since I didn't have any ground nutmeg on hand, I substituted for ground ginger. I added half a yellow onion with the crushed garlic inside the cavity of the chicken and roasted as instructed.  Chicken was very juicy and moist and the flavors were delicious. My husband and I loved this recipe and will be making this again.

Loved this recipe. I was skeptical at first about the nutmeg and cinnamon but everything worked out great. I did double the spices as suggested and added a packet of Goya Sazon for extra flavor. Also, rubbed some butter under the skin. I'm glad I did this because there was no drippings to baste the chicken with. It burned as soon as it touched the pan.  Will be making this again.

This makes it taste better. First baste the chicken with olive oil. Add Chinese 5 Spice instead of Allspice. Start at 450° and drop down 25° every 15 minutes until you reach 375°. Then take the chicken out to keep it moist. The MOST favorite chicken of the family! Everyone who tastes this chicken say it is the all time best.

This chicken was amazing!!! I did double up on the ingredients like the other reviewers said. I let it sit overnight and in the morning I put on a second rub on the chicken. Put it into the crock pot and four hours later..totally yummy!!! The chicken was juicy, flavorful and falling off the bone. I will definitely make again.

The whole family loved this! I did double the spices, and after thirty minutes, I still didn't have any drippings, so I poured chicken broth over the chicken. I also cooked cut up potatoes and carrots on the bottom.  They came out perfect.  Will be making this again!

Really juicy.  With the spice rub, it's different and goes well with acorn or any seasonal squash.  I didn't get pan drippings -- so I added white wine and chicken broth to the pan and baste.  The only reason I can't give it 5 stars is because of how much clean up effort there is with the carving, bones and pan.

Tried it this week & it was delicious!! Trippled the spices (except only used 1.5 tsp of salt & only doubled the sugar) for my 6lb chicken. I adjusted the oozing times to be a tad longer & it came out perfect. The 500° cooking period crisps the skin nicely along the chicken to retain its moisture. **Add about a cup of water to the bottom of the pan to prevent tons of smoking & burning!! The fat drippings will burn to the bottom of your pan & smoke up your house** 

I also sprinkled garlic powder all over the chicken the next day after 24hrs of marinating wrapped in plastic wrap & added an onion along with the crushed garlic in the chickens cavity. Like others mentioned, cooking it breast side down gives you the most tender, moist breast meat! So juicy & wonderful flavor! Will make this again soon.

I tried this for the first time back in September and decided right then to try this with my Thanksgiving Turkey! I had never attempted a turkey or making the big dinner. We had 16 people go nuts for it! I made a new tradition with the family. I did have to multiply the recipe x4. And up the cooking time.

I adore this recipe. This is my 2nd year using this for Thanksgiving. The way it smells when cooking is amazing. My family loves it and it is my go to recipe for roasted chicken. You wouldn't think the flavor combinations would be good, but this has the most amazing flavor.

I make this chicken all the time and it is delicious. I had to change the cooking time because I kept burning it. I roast at 475 for 15 mins then cook at 375 for an hour.

I added onion to the cavity and did not put in the fridge overnight(no time).  My family loved this and I have made itmany times. I doubled the spices and cooked covered for 45 min and uncovered for 30 more.  served with garlic mashed potatoes :-)

An excellent recipe. At first, I thought the short cooking time wouldn't thoroughly cook the chicken, but it does. And laying it breast-side down makes it very juicy! Love this recipe.

Delicious and moist!! 
Doubled the spices except for the salt. Added a little onion to the garlic.  Only "marinated" the chicken for a couple hours but it still came out delicious.  It did take a little longer to bake.  Will definitely make again.

Fantastic!  My first time working with a whole chicken and it came out beautifully.  I actually found the white meat to be even tastier and jucier than the dark meat - which I don't think has ever happened!  It was boyfriend approved too

Since it's summer, I cooked this on the grill with a can of ginger ale inserted in the cavity (standing up) and it was great!!!! The flavors are amazing. We had half for dinner and with the left-overs I made a small chicken salad and a pot pie. All so full of flavor! Great job and thanks for the recipe!

Very flavorful chicken.  Followed recipe with a few exceptions.  Prepared night before, followed other's advice to double seasoning and rub under skin as well.  Added onion and celery inside cavity.  Perfect to use leftovers as chicken noodle soup/stock.

I made this because it sounded interesting and it instantly became our favorite baked chicken recipe. The combination of flavors is magical and the chicken is moist and juicy. We tripled the rub to maximize the flavor and enjoyed every bite. It also smelled wonderful as it was baking. Warning: clean up is messy. It tends to splatter and create little black burned specks on your pan. Next time I'll use foil. But it was sooooo worth it!

Well, Hello, Chicken!  Who knew it could be this good? What a succulent, flavorful experience. At first we weren't sure about this blend of spices, so I made three chickens--this one and two other 5-star recipes as backup. Well, nobody cared about the other chickens, but they were squawking for this one! Couldn't get enough. The spices don't overpower the meat; instead, they blend uniquely to bring out the flavor of the chicken in extraordinary ways. And turning the chicken upside down made the juices run through it like a rotisserie chicken. This should be called something way more unique than "Simple Whole Roasted Chicken." BTW: We doubled the spices (except salt), as suggested by a reviewer, and it was perfect. I could make it this way every time and everyone would be happy!

One thing I loved about this recipe was cooking the chicken breast side down.  I always cook my chickens... and turkeys this way.  They self-baste, as the fat of the legs and thighs drip down to the breast... always juicy! I did not make this yet, but will definitely try... spices sound heavenly!

Very flavorful and juicy! I didn't have time to wait 24 hours, only 1 hour in the fridge before cooking and it still came out great! Next time, I will do the 24 hours.

I came across this recipe when I wanted something different to do with a whole chicken. Too late I realized the spice rub should sit overnight on the chicken but decided to go ahead and just cook it that same day. This came out very moist and tender and the skin was nicely browned and crunchy, yes I know its not healthy but I did eat some of it. I did bake this in a 375 oven in a foil lined casserole dish for about 2 hrs. as my smoke detector would have been going off way to often with the higher temperature.

I followed the directions and the chicken was so tender and moist.  Delicious!  But, I had to throw away my Calphalon baking pan. Nothing would get it clean after hours of soaking with this and that. I used foil at the bottom of the pan, but the juices leaked through.  What a disaster.  And the high-temp baking combined with the grease smoked up my kitchen. So, based on the above, I'm giving it only 3 stars.  There are other cooking methods that produce a tender and delicious chicken.
If I ever make this again, I'll use a disposable pan, and I'd lower the oven temperature.  The spices were surprisingly good.

This chicken turned out wonderful. I liked that it didn't have a bunch of butter or oil to make it tender or juicy and it was. I am glad I read the recipe yesterday, because I realized it had to sit in the fridge over-night. I lined 13x9 pan with thick foil instead of doing the rack to save on clean-up. It does make the skin come off the breast when it is finished, but I don't eat the skin anyhow. The spice flavors worked fine for winter or December with the cloves, but I might try the salt over-night with spring or summer flavors during other months. The cook time, or method, worked very well I just added 15 minutes at the end to make sure it was fully done to my personal liking.
Edit Note: I had written this review before looking at the pan the next day. I decided to add this after reading the next reviewer as I had the same issue. When I removed the thick foil, I had found that the chicken grease some how strangely had seaped through and completely burned up my 13x9 pan I have had for years. After 3 scrubs and ruining the finish I had to toss it. I also would use a disposable pan if making this. It is possible that a few layers of foil might help with this issue, don't know. My 5 star view is purely on ease and the tenderness of the chicken, which I did enjoy.

This chicken is sooo easy, my husband askes for it all the time now and I make it almost weekly, just toss in some vegitables to your pan and you have a full simple and quick meal. I leave uncovered the first 15mi to crisp the skin and cover the rest so it stays juicy and the juices cook into the vegitables making it amazing

Wonderful, best chicken I have ever had. I had a hard time with the cooking time and there were no dripping to baste with. I had a 7 lb. farm raised chicken that did not have much fat. So I put some water in the pan and basted it with butter a few times. I also covered it after the skin was nice and brown. I thought it never was going to get done. The wonderful smell was driving us crazy. I have been looking for a recipe for my thanksgiving turkey and this is it. I’m a new member and I’m not sure how this all works but you should repost this for turkey. Thank you for the wonderful recipe. This is one I will keep and pass on:). Also I’m surprised on how someone can change the recipe and rate is with fewer stars because they did not like it. How can you change a recipe and then give it a bad rating when it did not turn out???

AMAZING!!! That's all I can say! I have roasted hundreds of chickens in the past, but none as good as this. I had a whole cut-up chicken that I seasoned, and I didn't have time to marinate 24 hours. I doubled the spices, but everything else I followed exactly. This is the only way I will roast chicken from now on. Oh, and I put cut-up potatoes and carrots in the bottom of the baking pan and put the chicken pieces on top of those before roasting.

All I can say is WOW! Absolutely delicious. I made a 5 3/4 pound chicken. So I doubled the ingredients. I rubbed under the skin and on top of the skin. Cooked at 500 for 20 minutes, 450 for 20 minutes and 425 for 30-35 minutes. Was perfect! My 8 year old ate 2 legs and said "He wished chickens had 3 leg's"! But he then ate some of the Breast which was very Juicy. Thanks for the great recipe. This is one of my new favorites!

My first time making roast chicken-it came out well. I doubled the seasonings (except salt, and a little less sugar). I didn't have allspice, so I left that out. I sprinkled garlic powder inside and out. I rubbed the seasonings under the skin and on top of the skin, marinated for 24 hrs. I stuffed a quarter onion in the cavity.  Then I roasted it for upside down for 15 minutes at 500, then right side up for 15 minutes at 450, then upside down for 30 at 425, then right side up for 10 more min at 425.  I let it sit for 10 minutes. I was worried it would smoke, become to dry or not cooked through.  Instead it was browned all over and perfectly done.  I'll be roasting whole chicken again.

This was really good.  We all, even my 3 and 7 year olds loved it.  I doubled the spices (except the salt) as most reviewers suggested.  The only other change I'll make is next time add some chicken broth to the roasting pan so that there is a little more drippings.  Thanks for a new and different way to make chicken!

We usually eat only half a roasted chicken,  however, my family at 3/4 of this one! I used the leftovers to make enchilladas the next day.  This is restaurant quality!!! I wouldn't have put these flavors together, but it was a hit.  I doubled all the ingredients except the salt.

I was very skeptical of this recipe when I first came across it. I got a whole chicken on sale at my favorite grocery store and was looking for a new way to serve it. Looking at all the spices in the rub that goes on the chicken it all seemed very 'sweet' to me, not at all what I was trying to find in a recipe... but I did it anyway and the chicken turned out delicious! Excellent flavoring, it wasn't sweet at all when you actually bite into the chicken. I saved all the drippings and used them as a sauce after I diced the bird up. Will do again! Next time I plan to experiment with adding veggies to the bottom of the pan

I will definately make this again.  Very simple to prepare.  Had a unique flavor that the whole family loved.  I don't know about the cooking upside down or the high heat then dropping it down parts of this recipe.  But the flavor was very good.  Oh' and I had to add chicken broth because the first 15 minutes into the cooking of this bird, the little juice that did come out blackened on my pan.  Would definately recommend a bit of broth being added to this recipe.

Simply DELICIOUS!  I made a fresh pineapple/mango salsa to accompany it and just for the heck of it, I put the core from the pineapple inside the chicken along with the garlic and an onion...WOW!  So good!  I will DEFINITELY make this again and again!   I just made it again and, I believe, it's even better this time!!!  I still put a fresh Pineapple core in it (why mess with perfection, right?)and also stuffed it with garlic, a small onion and some fresh thyme  I made http://www.cooks.com/recipe/ik38l56g/jamaican-rice-and-peas.html to accompany it and let me just say, It's so good, You'll wanna slap Yo Mama!!!!!!  I also decided that I DON'T want to scrub a pan (child, NO!) so, I used an aluminum roasting pan from the dollar tree (a pack, y'all) and took a piece of foil to lay on top of it when it looked brown enough for me.  I did not depend on the handy, dandy built-in thermometer that came on my 9 LB roaster; I used my own that sits outside the oven while it is "plugged into" my chicken ;-)  RA  A CLEAN oven, NO scrubbing a pan, and the chance to just relax and enjoy my meal!  Oh, before I forget, last night when I put this all together to marinate, I took the giblets,some water,onion (leftover, hardly 3oz) and a few soft tips of some celery into a pot and cooked it on a simmer for several hours while I watched tv.  When done, I strained it to save to add to the bottom of my pan. PERFECTION! The Temps for this are right! No need for the pineapple either ;-)

I never would have expected this recipe to work out.  Boy was I wrong.  I thought the spices were a wierd combination and the oven heat and time wouldn't work.  Something in my gut made me give it a whirl.  Yes the spice combination was different, but it was DELICIOUS! The cooking process made it super MOIST. An absolute winner in my house.

Excellent! Doubled all spiced but excluded sugar and allspice.  Added 2tsp each - garlic powder and onion powder instead of fresh garlic.  Marinated for 2 hours.  Cooked for 15 min at 450, then 45 at 425.

Unbelievably juicy, moist, and soft chicken. The onion in the cavity is the key, you can experiment with the spice rub (as I did a little) and still get great results if you place onion and/or garlic in the chicken's cavity. Mine cooked in 4 hrs 30 min. Will be making this often!

Wow, great flavors.  I added paprika and garlic powder to the mix.  I used chicken thighs.  I baked them at 400 for 40 minutes.  I served with chumichurri sauce from this site.

The main reason I wanted to try this recipe is because I hate when the chicken breast dries out, however, I did want the skin of the breast to brown so I turned it over half way through cooking.  I think the sugar helped it brown faster too.  I wasn't crazy about the seasoning selection so I didn't increase any of it - the breast did not dry out at all.  It turned out like a rotisserie chicken because it was well browned on all sides so that's why I gave it 4 stars.

Made this last night and it was the first whole chicken for me.  I have to say, I will make this again and again.  First off...simple, simple,simple!  Second, I doubled all spices (not sugar or salt) and marinated for 24 hrs like directed.  I rubbed the spices under the skin too.  It was almost done cooking when I had to leave, so my hubby turned off the oven, covered it and when we got home an hour later, it was perfect! So, with that being said, I don't know if keeping it in the oven with the oven off cooked it anymore or not.  My kids just shoveled it in their mouths...no chatting or fighting like normal. ;) The house smelled wonderful to boot.  This is such a great but mild flavored bird. Moist and delish!  Thank you!

Came out really juicy and flavorful. The last 15 minutes I reduced the heat to 350 since I felt like my oven was browning the chicken too much. I then took it out of the oven and left it covered with a foil for 30 mins. I also followed other's advice and rubbed it with garlic and pepper.

Wow! Best roast chicken I've made so far. Love the flavor and the chicken was so tender. I didn't have a rack, so instead of placing the chicken in the oven breast side down, I placed it breast side up and then just lightly covered it with a piece of aluminum foil part of the way through. Still delicious though!

I'm vegetarian so I'm only going off of my family's reaction, but they LOVED it. I did carve it myself and saw that this bird was way juicier than ones I've cooked in the past. It smelled terrific - almost made me go back to eating meat!

I enjoyed the flavours of this chicken, as did my children. I will probably make this again but would lengthen the cooking time. Some parts of the chicken close to the bone still had a pink tinge to it. I had to put it back in the oven for an additional 15 to 20 minutes, but overall, great flavour.

My family loves this recipe. I make it often because it's SO easy!  The chicken is very tasty and juicy!  I made one change-- omitted the cloves.

We've made this recipe three times and every time it's been delicoius!  After the first time, we cut the nutmeg in half because it was a little strong for us, but still great as written.  Very very moist chicken, even my picky kids eat it!  We made it twice for guests in town, and they raved about it as well.  One time we forgot to season overnight and didn't do it until just before we cooked it, and it was still delish.

If I could give it a higher score, I would!  It was delish!  I didn't have any vegtables in the house, but it would also have tasted great with apples.  I followed the directions exactly as posted and it was a big hit in our picky eater home.

My first whole chicken! It was very good and juicy. I did double the ingredients for the rub and put an onion and some rosemary in the cavity. Very good.

I really had high hopes for this recipe, but unfortunately, it just didn't work for my family. I like the combo of spices, but I didn't like them on the chicken. I made this for Easter dinner, and although my husband liked it only slightly better than I did, it still went virtually untouched and ultimately ended up being thrown away. I do like to try new and different recipes, so thank you for the submission. However, I will stick to the more traditional spices when roasting a chicken.

Very tasty!!!  However next time I will cut way back on the amount of salt it calls for.  It was a too salty for my taste and my hands swelled from it.  But otherwise nice flavor from the interesting combination of seasonings.

I'm a beginner cook.  This came out as though I knew exactly what I was doing! I didn't have nutmeg or all spice, so I used extra cinnamon.  My roaster rack was too big, so I layered the pan w/ celery and onion. Everyone loved it.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This recipe is so amazing! I don't usually cook whole chickens but this was so good and so easy. I actually cooked it covered at 350 for 2 hours then basted it and cooked uncovered for 30 more minutes and it came out perfect. I stuck some quartered red potatoes and chunks of carrots and celery in the bottom of the pan too. When I went to cut into it, the meat literally fell off the bone it was soo moist and juicy! I made gravy out of the pan drippings and it was delicious but we didn't even put it on the chicken because there was no need. I will definitely make this again soon!

Excellent. I doubled the spices as recommended by others. I cooked it @ 350 for 2 hours (5.25lb chicken). It was a little pink in some spots.  I love the combination of spices. So flavorful!! I also placed peeled white potatoes & yams in the roasting pan & they got all yummy & crispy with a little olive oil, Rosemary & basting w/ pan drippings.

LOVED it, and I have never done a chicken before that was good -- I used onion in the cavity too, as another person suggested, but didn't marinade as long as recommended so I'll do it correctly the next time!

Easy and excellent recipe! I took the advice of others and cooked it at 350 for 2 hours and the skin was nice and golden and the meat was tasy and juicy. I got a 4 lb. chicken for $5 and we had an awesome dinner!

My husband and I LOVE this recipe!!  The only things I did differently were to double everything, except the garlic, and I rubbed the chicken with texas pete hot sauce (I've also used the garlic hot sauce version of texas pete) before the dry rub.  The chicken turned out wonderful and very juicy!

I really loved the flavor it was surprisingly awesome. I would have given a five star except of all the smoke it caused trying to cook it and the cooking time wasnt accurate I think 15 minutes more would be helpful.

Love this recipe. This will definitely be my go to recipe for a whole chicken from now on.  I didn't have the time to marinate for 24 hours, so I doubled the spices and marinated about 1 1/2 hours but it still turned out great.

I was hesitant about the spices on this (and not adding salt, pepper, etc.) but WOW! I did rub butter on the bird before I rubbed the spice mix on. This is delicious!

I saw all the great reviews and thought that I should try this. I found the chicken to be very juicy, but very bland. My family does not eat skin which is where all the seasoning is, the chicken meat itself had no flavor.

This is my first time ever to review something!  This chicken is just as everyone has said, moist and tasty.  I added carrots and potatoes to the pan, and you would think carrots might not taste good with cinnamon, etc, but it received rave reviews from my VERY picky family of 5.

Hi,Happy Chefs,  I just took out the oven it is resting!  I can hardly wait for dinner to taste it.  It was real easy to prepare.  I love the color.  I used a small tomatoe paste can to hold up my chicken (read review) thanks for the tip.  I put potatoes in the bottom of the pan, they look yummy!  I will post how the family liked it.  Thanks for sharing. I gave it 4 stars just for presentation I am into presentation! LOL.  Will taste soon. :) I'm back , the family enjoyed it. I would put more rub for  intense flavor.  The mild taste went well with our side dishes.  Thanks for sharing Indriani

I love this recipe.  I now use it to grill chicken.  I get thighs or quarters and put the rub on liberally.  Oil the grill with a little olive oil and cook away (about 45 min).  Arrange the coals so that only half the grill is over the direct heat.  I then cook the chicken over the non coal side for about 45 minutes.  You should only turn it once and don't poke at it with a fork.  The crispness from the grill, the charcoal flavor, and the spices make for an excellent meal.  I haven't had anyone dislike it yet.  Thank you for the simple rub recipe.

I rubbed the spices in pockets I made under the skin of the chicken because similar to another poster, we don't eat the skin in my family either.  I also used twice the garlic, and put some crushed garlic under the skin.  It was one of the best roast chickens I've ever made! I'll definitely be using this recipe again!

This is the most juicy and moist chicken I have ever tasted!  Usually when I bake a chicken in the oven it is dry but this was more juicy than store-bought rotisserie chicken. I will be making chicken more often with this recipe!

OMG! Im a beginner cook and this was my very first attempt to roast a chicken, I was so nervous that it would not come out good.  I bought a 6.5 lb. chicken and tripled the recipe due to the fact that i have a bigger bird for what's called for. I didnt not have any allspice on hand so i used some rosemary. Marinated overnight, followed the recommended temperature and time, I did not have any drippings in the pan so I put in 3/4 cup of water and basted the chicken towards last 30 minutes of baking. My chicken needed another 20 minutes of baking to reach the internal temp of 180 degrees. My mother who's the toughest food critique along with my husband both said this chicken is so juicy and tender. They were all surprised to know the odd combination of spices in this recipe and how juicy and delicious it came out. This is definitely a keeper for a beginner cook like me!

This chicken was really good.  I was worried because the ingredients seemed kind of odd, but it all worked.  Following advice from other reviewers, I did double the spices for the rub.  I didn't have any drippings to baste it with--all the liquid was burned onto the bottom of the pan.  The chicken still turned our amazingly moist and tender.  Speaking of the pan, I will be sure to line it with foil next time I make this.  I've been soaking/scrubbing the pan for last hour.

Doubled the spices, cut small slits in chicken skin and also added some chopped onion with the crushed garlic. This is absolutely delish!!! Husband and son said it was the best roasted chicken ever!

Amazing.  The only thing different that I do w/this is when its in a roasting pan I don't use a rack and I put chardonnay on the bottom of pan just enough to cover bottom of pan and I baste often after roasting for 30 minutes

Amazing!!! Definitly double up the amount of spices. I only let it sit for about 6 hours and it was fantastic! Very juicy. Usually the white meat is dry when cooking a whole chicken but it was VERY juicy. I will be cooking this over and over!

My husband made this last night and it was sooo good!!!  He didn't marinate the chicken a day ahead and he skipped out on the cloves & allspice because we didn't have any on hand.  He also didn't cook it breast-side down and it was still juicy. I urged him to make this again for future dinner parties. :)

I doubled all ingredients for the rub except salt and eliminated allspice (I didn't have it).  The cook time went quite a bit longer in my oven, but it turned out just beautiful and moist.  I did place some foil loosely on top when it started to look dark in places.

My Favorite Roast chicken. Double the spices but 5 cloves garlic is fine. Rub all over under the skin after you pat it dry from it's rinse. For a change up and even more moisture you can add a tomato to the cavity.

I was so skeptical to use this seasoning but oh my!! Delicious! I doubled spices. Crushed garlic on top too. Poured about a cup of water in the pan first. Cooked maybe half hour to 45 mins more. Covered w foil for the first 30 mins. This chix was amazing and so moist. Also sliced butter and rubbed on top before cooking. Also stuffed it under skin. My husband never likes the way I cook meat but he loved it so much he had thirds!! Thank u!

I love how easy this recipie is, my husband hates chicken and he loves it! I make gravy from the drippings he calls it sweet gravy. I make mine in a oven bag, and it works well. I don't put any vegitables in I just do the chicken, and I don't have any allspice I just use what I have. I works beautifully. I am trying this recipie on a test turkey to see if I will do it for thanksgiving, I will let you know.

I was skeptical at first because the spices seemed odd for a chicken, but I wanted to try something different so I gave this recipe a shot. It was DELICIOUS. I did double the recipe for about a 4lb chicken and roasted it in a pan for about 2 hours. I can't tell you how good it was, there isn't any left! I will definately make this recipe again!!

Excellent.  The chicken was so tender and juicy.  I didn't have time to let the spices sit so I just threw them on the thawed chicken and roasted per the recipe.  Would use this again.

I omitted the sugar and doubled the spices. Very good. Quite tender. EDITED: I've tried this with the spices called for, only using a little brown sugar in place of the white sugar and shoving thick apple slices in the hollow of the bird. That is also very nice and lends a good flavor.

I made the same changes as others.  (Doubled the dry mix and added an onion to the cavity.)  My husband also said it was the best whole chicken he had ever had.  I added water to the bottom of the pan and used the juices over the rice.  Also, the recipe didn't say to cover this at any point, but you need to so that it's done all the way.  I would say cover for at least the first 30 minutes and then uncovered so the skin gets cruntchy!  Yummy!  I am going to try this on pork chops next!

I made this chicken to have for sandwiches, so I didn't eat it hot.  I essentially followed the recipe as written, with one change: rather than stuff the chicken with garlic, I used four leeks (white portion only), sliced into rings.  Not sure it made much difference in the taste of the chicken, but the roasted leeks are tasty!  Nice crispy, flavorful skin.  Roasting instructions worked perfectly.

I'm a novice cook and I took all of the skin off of the chicken before reading that this would dry it out.  I followed the recipe with no modifications and it still came out incredibly JUICY!! I was very impressed & my husband loved it.

I was a little leery of this recipe because I thought it would be too sweet but I was so wrong!  My very picky daughter exclaimed "this is the best chicken ever!" And the skin was crispy and delicious-the meat fell off the bones.  I used the carcass for chicken soup and it gave it a different but delicious flavor.  BTW, my thermometer only read 165 and the chicken was cooked through.  Great recipe!

This chicken was amazing! It was moist and thender. I made the sauce recommened to go with it, and wow, my husband and I will make this over and over. The only thing was some of the drippings burned in the bottom of the pan and created a lot of smoke. This may be because of the such high temps for cooking.

We did not care for this at all.  I only gave it two stars cause we actually ate it because it was the juiciest we'd ever had.  No thanks to the recipe though.  We used our attachment in our toaster oven to bake.

I just got done eating this for dinner, and it was great. I used totally different seasonings, but followed the cooking method to a T. I was looking for a way to bake a chicken and have it come out juicy, and this really did the trick. We baked it breast down for the entire time and then flipped it and cooked it breast up for another 5-10min to crisp up the skin, and it worked out great. This will be how I bake chickens from now on.

It's hard to ruin chicken, so this wasn't bad, but I found the combo of spices really odd.

I will have to give this 5 stars. The Hubby enjoyed it so much he request seconds of his already large portions.  I even took the small amount of leftovers to work the next day and my co-workers liked it.

This chicken smelled wonderful, looked beautiful and tasted very nice - extremely juicy. The only change I made was to stuff part of an orange in to the cavity along with the garlic.

I first need to sat THANK YOU!  Thank you for sharing this delish recipe!! This was fantastic, just fantastic!!   I doubled the spices and rubbed it in good (under the skin) and lined the pan well with foil.**EASY CLEANUP**  I cut up some carrots and potatoes and put them under the rack of the chicken, added just a little bit of water so they wouldn't stick to the foil. PErfection.  BIG THUMBS UP! Got any ideas for my next meal?? :)

The BEST for its GREAT TASTE and SIMPLICITY TO MAKE!
We just had this last night with friends and family - I made with TWO whole chicken - they loved it - it's all gone!
Today (not realizing the time), I had one of those store-bought roasted chicken for my and my daughter's lunch.  And I came to a VERY SERIOUS realization, I will try my very best to NEVER EVER eat any more store bought roasted chicken.  Store bought roasted chicken (regardless of what seasoning they claim to have cooked it in), is ABSOLUTELY NO COMPARISON to this recipe!!
We have this almost every week along with Chimichurri Sauce!
Thanks so much for sharing!!

The spices seem odd to put on chicken but the result is excellent!  I have made this a couple of times now.  The first time I followed the recipe, but doubled the spices, using a whole roaster chicken.  But I found the temperature to be too high and the oven smoked.  Second time around I used the spices and omitted the garlic, but on split chicken breasts (bone-in) and cooked on 375 for 45 minutes.  Yum!

Wow!  I would have never thought this unusual blend of ingredients would taste so good with chicken!  Make it for a Bible study at our home and everyone gave it 5 stars!  Will definately make again and perhaps try on turkey later this year!

I was strictly looking for cooking time and temperatures and came across this.  It looked promising, so I gave it try.  I took my brined bird out, seasoned it, and followed this recipe's instructions.  My husband told  me it was the best roasted chicken he ever had.  It was crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside!

This was good, not great but good. One thing I didn't do that I would do next time is to put the spices on and leave it to sit for 24 hours like the recipe suggests. I would also make sure that you rub it under the skin. The skin had a nice flavor but it didn't carry all the way through the meat. Also, it definitely does not call for enough liquid...I added 1/2 can of chicken stock to help baste it.

by far the best whole chicken i have made. i only had it in the fridge for about 6 hours but next time it will be 24.  i used the neck and gibblets, and the same seasoning as on the chicken and boiled them as if i was making a gravy. and as the chicken cooked basted like recipe says. only when the juices started to run out i added more from the stove top instead of water. in the end i had enough pan juices to make a realy good gravy for on top of the chicken and potatos.  the gravy was perfect on the chicken. since i did not marinate it over night, the gravy really helped enhance the flavor that was already in the chicken. this recipe was great and i will be making it again. the family loved it

I took the advice of adding 1 can of chicken broth with some butter and that defiantly helped. It also took an extra 25 minutes to cook. It was so worth it!!!I will cook this one again. Here's a tip for your pan if the juices stick to the bottom- just fill it up with water and bake for 1/2 hour (or more depending on how burnt it is). You'll be able to scrub it off with a cloth. no problem!!

My husband loved the chicken. It took a bit longer than we anticipated to cook, but it was worth the wait. We also doubled the seasonings, except the salt. 
We combined the chicken with the chimichurri sauce as suggest, and we also combine it with a Cajun roasted potatoes (recipe on all recipes).
Overall, great meal.

Lovely, lovely recipe. As advised by many others, I doubled the spices and I did not refrigerate overnight (something I will do next time, just so the flavours will be absorbed into the meat). I filled the cavity with one diced onion and the garlic. I used a roasting bag (not sure how this translates. It's made of heatproof plastic) and added sliced zucchini and carrots. The chicken was wonderfully juicy and like everyone else says.. this combination of spices really surprised me, but it works!

Okay, a little aside about this chicken...

1.  It is extremely moist and tasty.
2.  It was a little salty, so next time I'll probably cut it in half.
3.  My expensive roasting pan was completely ruined by the sugar/spice mixture.  Next time I'll probably purchase a throw-away pan.
4.  Delicious.  Really good and interesting flavor.
5.  I served this for Thanksgiving, instead of a turkey, and it was a huge hit.
6.  Others complained about it smoking up their kitchen, and when mine started to smoke I just added water to the pan and it made the smoke stop.

This is really worth trying!

Chicken is my favorite little sweet bird to roast during the week for a quick meal. This version is outstanding and came out as tender and golden brown as can be! I had a 7lb bird so I brined it overnight with lemon juice & hot sauce in the salt water and I generously doubled the spices and threw a lemon inside with the garlic. I used the Chimchurri sauce as well and I was ooh-in and aww-in the whole meal! Excellent and thanks for sharing this one.

This is my new favorite way to roast a whole chicken!  I've made many different vairations on the flavors, but it always comes out crisp on the outside, tender on the inside, and fully cooked. Thank you!

Easy and delicious.  I did double the spices as recommended by other posters.  Made it last night for the family I nanny for and they're convinced I'm a culinary goddess.  Served it with corn on the cob, mashed potatoes and a peach cobbler to welcome autumn.

I followed this recipe exactly, not a single change to it, and it was so so good!  And very easy!  The ingredients did seem a little odd when I was making it, and I was afraid my very picky boyfriend wouldn't like it, but he loved it too!  I served it with the chimichurri sauce, which honestly I'd never had before, and also with some brown rice, and all of it was awesome!  I'll definitely be making this again.

Very good.  The aroma from the oven reminded me of a pumpkin pie!!  I left out the cloves (personal preference) and served it with brown rice, gravy, and corn.  YUMMY!!

Delicious, a perfect recipe that makes it easy to enjoy the chicken. We use organic chickens, then you don't have the problem of larger than normal (though its now considered normal) breast meat - which cooks so unevenly.

**The chicken was moist but the cinnamon was very over powering it called for  1/8tsp i would cut that down but other then that it was good. Has to cook a little longer then stated in the recipe..Not sure i would make it again

It was good, I did not have time to marinade it, so I just rubbed it in and put in the oven.  I liked it, but it was not the best I've had.

I made this in the crock pot, and I found this to be ok.  I have my own recipe for roast chicken which is what I normally use, but I thought I'd give this a try. I will probably not make this again.  I felt this chicken was very dry.

This was grrrrreat!  I also added a quartered onion to the cavity, but in addition I put a can of chicken broth in the roaster.  This really helped keep the chicken moist and made a terrific gravy afterwards.  I did everything else according to the recipe.  The skin was crispy and nicely browned and the meat was juicy.  Excellent recipe.

I was only able to marinate this for a couple of hours, but it still turned out fabulously.  I lined my roaster with foil, and I also tented my chicken with foil for the first cooking period.  I didn't have any trouble with smoke or smell in the house.  Great recipe, the family loved it, very flavorful and tender.

I like this recipe alot. I used chicken fryer parts, I thought it may come out on the "ukky" side because I did not use a whole chicken, instead it came out juicy and lot of flavor. I will use this recipe again. Next time I will try to use a whole chicken to see the difference between the whole chicken and chicken pieces.

Absolutely delicious. I doubled the recipe, due to a bigger chicken and didn't have allspice, so I added a little bit more of the nutmeg, cloves and cinnamon and a tiny bit of black pepper. I'm not known for my cooking prowess but it turned out beautifully. We finished off a 6 lb. chicken in two days.

This recipe was fantastic. I did not have time time to marinate, just rubbed it on and popped it in the oven. My kids loved it, my husband couldn't figure out what was in it. I am just floored that the odd ingredients tasted like like good old fashioned comfort food. A good addition: after you take chicken out to rest, toss broccoli florets in drippings, put back in turned off oven for 10 minutes, yum.

I used my crockpot as others did and I guess I had too much expectation after reading all the great reviews.  There wasn't much to the flavor as I thought it would be.  Maybe it's using the crockpot that didn't do justice for what everyone says is an FLAVORFUL dish.  Maybe next I'll try it in the roasting pan, but doubt I'd make it again.

Wow! Awesome recipe! My 4 yr old daughter didn't even want me to let it cool down for her to eat it!  I had hardly any drippings to bast with; not messy at all.  I also sprayed the rack with Pam Cooking Spray and it was fine.  I did not cover the chicken at all and it turned out great.  On the border of getting smokey while cooking but not nearly as bad as I thought it would be by reading other reviews.  Used a disposable roasting pan but like I said I had hardly any drippings.  Fantastic flavor; I could have tried to eat the entire bird myself!!!!!

Awesome! So easy, and it got that golden, crispy outside that I was going for. I didn't have any problems with smoke or splatter, although I did cover with tin foil for the first fifteen minutes. Will definitely make again!

This was so easy and yummy!  I rub the seasoning on the day before and then put it in the crockpot in the morning.  Left it on high for about 4 hours. It was falling off the bone, so deliscous.

I bought a better than 6lb chicken so I doubled the rub.  I marinated the chicken as indicated less than 24 hours, probably around 18.  The end result was great, most flavorful chicken I've ever had my husband generously commented on how wonderful everything smelled and I'm looking forward to using the leftovers for soup.  But I have to say that I will never make this dish again.  I followed the cooking directions exactly and my house is still filled with the smell of last nights dinner and I had to clean my oven from all the splatter.  I don't see how this is is a winter dish - it's freezing here and I had all my windows open, ceiling fans running and my husband was on smoke detector duty.  This might be better on the grill, with those high temperatures and all the smoke, I think indoor cooking is a mistake.

Absolutely great chicken.  After reading reviews, I also decided to use a crock pot to cook the chicken, to avoid smoke in the kitchen.  I think next time I'll remove chicken from crock pot and cook last half hour in oven to brown.

This chicken was tasty-there were no leftovers, but I will never make it again!!  The smoke alarm kept going off the whole time it was roasting.  By the time it was done, the whole house was filled with smoke.  All in all, it was a very noisy operation and not worth the trouble.

The flavour was good, but the cooking time is way off. I used a 3lb chicken that was completely thawed and as per some reviewers suggestions I cooked it for an additional 15 mins. It came out still raw in the middle, totally infuriating! I threw the chicken in a roaster and cooked it covered for an additional 30 mins. To add to this my oven was a complete mess from cooking the chicken uncovered. I will not use this cooking method again, but may try the spices using my rotisserie.

This was amazing even though I only let it marinate for about 4 hours. I never roasted a chicken by reducing the oven temperature as the recipe states...and this was the juiciest chicken I ever made. I also stuffed the chicken with a halved lemon.  The leftovers made a great chicken salad the next day.  Thanks Indriani!

I wasn't sure how all the spices were going to work together.  Cinnamon and sugar on a chicken?  LOL  Never question a 5 Star recipe!!  The chicken was extremely moist and the spices were very mild and made this a step up from typical chicken.  We really enjoyed it and loved the flavor that was throughout the chicken, not just the skin.  Great recipe and sure to be made in this home again and again.  Oh, and I tried the Chimichurri sauce and it's really good with this chicken.

Very Very Good!!  I didn't have time to marinade overnight and can't imagine it being better from doing that because this turned out awesome!  I added a few of my own favorite seasonings, Garlic Garlic (Tastfully Simple), Parsley and Cayenne and had great flavor throughout the whole chicken.  Excellent easy Keeper!  Thanks

I used this recipe to save dinner when my boyfiend came home and thought he could cook a chicken in less than 90mins. Well thanks to this recipe he proved me wrong and thankfully so. I turned out perfect and tender.

Fabulous alternative to the average everyday roasted chicken. This one is definitely going in the quick reference box for future dinners.

I did not marinate overnight. I wrapped in aluminum foil and cooked covered for an hour then cooked uncovered for 30 minutes.

This was great! The method of cooking made the chicken perfect--crisp skin, moist interior. I increased each step by 1/2 since I had a six pound chicken. Also, I used Chinese 5-spice because it seemed similar but easier than all of the ones listed and it was delicious. Folks were asking for the recipe. I take that as a winner.

This is THE BEST roasted chicken I’ve ever had! My guests and family ate the ENTIRE CHICKEN! I tripled the spices, used Rosemary and Black Pepper in lieu of All Spice (because I did not have any). I didn’t use the cloves seasoning because I didn’t have and and ADDED poultry seasoning to make up for the missing cloves ingredient. I covered the Chicken with aluminum foil when the top started browning. PERFECT!

Excellent! I followed reviewers and doubled the spices in the rub, except the sugar. I also didn’t have cloves so left those out. I also included onions in the cavity and basted with butter 2-3 times. I didn’t notice the taste of the spices individually - like it didn’t taste anything like pumpkin pie! ;) I did not marinate overnight (no time).This chicken had crispy skin (I started with it breast down but flipped it midway because the temperature on the underside was way lower than on the top) and was incredibly moist. Thanks for the recipe!

I’ve made this 3 or 4 times now. Every time I serve it, my guests report that it’s the most delicious chicken they’ve had! This is such a simple thing to cook and it’s always a hit. I have made some variations on the spice blend just for our taste, but I think the recommended spices are perfect.

The best roast chicken ever. Easy and fun to make. I had to. Lightly cover it with foil for the last half hour but maybe it was too close to the top of the oven. I marinated it in the refrigerator about six hours.
We reheated the leftovers las night and it was still moist and tender.

I doubled the spices, like some of the other reviews have said. I cooked it out on the grill as it was hot and didn’t want to heat up the kitchen.  I cooked a 5 lb. chicken in 1 hr 10 min. It was 175 internal temp. It was ok, not overly spicy. My grandkids were just ‘ok’ with it. Probably won’t make it again. But it was a fun experience, and easy. Crisped up real nice.

I make this recipe at least once a month using all types of chicken pieces.  My favorite is using thighs as they come out very juicy.  I don't ever  have time to marinate so its usually same day and yet the chicken comes out good.

This was the best chicken I have ever had! Way better than rotisserie! The Breast meat was so juicy and tender, yet the skin was crispy. We are still using the leftovers, but we don’t mind because it is soooo tasty! I will be making this frequently.

I doubled the spices, rubbed them on the skin while the oven preheated, added the onion inside... and the magic happened!! Personally I’ll go with a little less salt next time, but this is undeniably my new favorite roast chicken recipe! Thank you Indriani!!

I loved this. Simple and easy.  I didn’t have garlic but I sliced up some orange and put it inside.  Then I added garlic powder to the rub.  I also sliced up some butter and put it underneath the skin.

I didn't have Allspice so I didn't use it.  I also didn't have ground cloves so I used Cumin instead.  I also doubled the recipe.....AND I didn't have time to let it set over night so I cooked it right away.  MAN WAS THIS DELICIOUS!  The cooking instructions make this so tender and juicy!  The rub acted like a nice crisp coating with no bad stuff like MSG in a package!  I liked this so much that I wrote the recipe down and shared it.  Enjoy!

I've made this twice now, and both times it has come out fabulous. Like other reviewers, I doubled the spice rub (except the salt), substituted brown for white sugar and put onion & celery in the cavity with the garlic. Be sure to put some liquid (water or stock) in the bottom of the roaster to avoid the smoke issue and use for gravy. I use a convection oven, so I lowered the temps by 25 degrees at each stage and the overall time to 40-45 mins. Also added some butter at the first basting for richer gravy. Delicious served with stuffing (mixed with those cooked onions, garlic and celery) and a Caesar salad.

I love this blend of spices. The only change I was was add some additional spices like tandoori and I did not put the chicken in the fridge overnight. I made the rub and put the chicken in the oven right after. The stock once I deboned it also gave a nice taste to the soup I made

I followed this recipe exactly and we got a juicy very flavorful chicken with wonderfully crunchy skin. The spice blend is amazing!

A great base recipe for a roasted chicken. Every time I've followed these directions, my chicken has come out tender, juicy and delicious.

Did everyone cook this until internal temp was 180? Everyone is saying how tender and juicy it is, but I would think that cooking it until 180 would make it too dry! Delicious recipe though!

This is the most amazingly unusual chicken recipe I have ever made! My husband is a food connoisseur, his exact words were “I think this is my new favorite seasoning!” The chicken is so moist and tender and the skin is golden crispy. My kids fight over it... ages 2, 6 and 10.

Made as posted (except the allspice, didn't have any either) &  it is really good.  I was skeptical of the spices, but they blend really well.  Left overs made into an open-faced hot chicken sandwich (gravy with the drippings) was even better!  Wouldn't make it often, as others posted they would, but it was a nice change & will keep on hand for when we need to jazz up the rotation.  Added 1 cup chicken broth to pan to avoid smoking and splattering. Marinated for 24 hr, added onion inside cavity as well.  Very nice.

This was good, but it was not amazing like so many reviews said it would be.  The flavor was ok, and it was not very juicy.

I wouldn't change a thing.  It was cooked perfectly.  The only thing I did in addition to the directions was stab the chicken after it had cooked for 30 minutes.  It was moist but throughly cooked.  Delicious!

This was very moist so roasting at a high temperature worked very well.  However, as much as I love spices,  chicken just pairs better with herbs.

Too many spices. The best whole chicken I have made consistently is one on a spit rotating over a hot fire; no seasoning at all. The chicken is very moist and flavorful. It self bastes.

The spices mentioned in this recipe i thought were interesting but very delicious. They did throw some ppl off as they weren't expecting them, but i loved it! 
This has also become my go-to method  for cooking chicken! I mention method because no matter what spices you're using, the way it's cooked makes the chicken incredible. I've just begun turning it onto its back the last 10/15 minutes to brown the breast area before serving it.  Everyone who has tried it is very complimentary about how juicy and tender the meat is - I even use this method for cooking my thanksgiving turkey now as well!

Baking it at the high heat, following the written instructions, creates a yummy bark. It was so delicious. I had to make a substitutions for the allspice with what I had, Mesquite seasoning from Mccormick. We grow our own garlic, so I had that on hand and added more.  My go-to recipe now

Best oven toasted chicken ive ever had. Only small change I made was instead of stuffing the cavity with garlic I made homemade stuffing to stuff it instead. Also I put the rub on right before putting it in the oven instead of letting it sit for 24 hours

I roasted this chicken exactly as directed. The chicken was tender and juicy.  After the first 15 minutes I was concerned about the overly browned spots. They turned black by the end of  the cooking time.  Now my oven looks like a bomb site! Chicken fat was spattered everywhere, and  I need to clean my oven before I can use again!
It was not worth the effort and I will wrap the chicken in foil  if I make this again to eliminate the horrible mess. Roasting with the breast side down did seem to retain the juiciness, so that part worked well.

The method of baking the chicken created a very smoky and greasy oven. You will have to clean your oven when you make this recipe. I would add water to the bottom of the pan and then watch the chicken to see if that will help with the smoke problem. I also think after turning the oven down maybe adding aluminum foil to help cut down on the grease spattering. That being said, the chicken is very juicy and quite good.

Absolutely delicious. Made the following changes due to Unavailability but otherwise followed the recipe:

Half a chicken
No allspice so added 1/8 tsp rosemary and 1/2 tsp blackpepper
Half an onion - which I crushed with 4 garlic which I then rubbed onto the chicken.
Marinated for about half an hour.
Added a stock cube and 2 cups of water to the pan while the chicken is on the rack

In the oven: 
First round - 230-240 C for 15 mins
Baste
second round 210 C for the next 15mins
Baste
Third round 190C for the last 30 mins and added the veggies to the pan
Made gravy with the  drippings in the pan, which took only minutes.

Excellent results. Will be a regular

This was so good! I doubled the spices and added an onion to the cavity. I left out the allspice because I didn't have it and it was delicious! I also only cooked to a temp of 165 as that's a safe temp for chicken. It was so good my husband didn't stop talking about it!

Love it! The spice mixture is so good; I doubled all but the salt the second time I made it because it's just that good. My husband has never liked when I have made a whole chicken because it's too dry, but he loved this one. The downside to this recipe is that I usually have enough chicken left over to make chicken and noodles the next day, but my family doesn't leave anything for leftovers on this one! Maybe I need to find a ten pound chicken..?!

I made exactly as directed. The chicken had reached its internal temperature 15 minutes early.  The chicken weighed over 5# - a roaster.  The flavor was good and it was tender .  I will make this again. I'm glad I checked the temp every 15 minutes or it would have been overdone. Perhaps my oven runs hot at those very high temps , I don't know.  It is a good recipe and worth trying on a turkey or turkey breast as someone else mentioned.

I prepared my chicken the way I always do. I just followed the recipe for the roasting instructions. My chicken was delicious and moist. My husband liked it too. Will definitely use the roasting directions again. I did shorten the cooking time for the first temperature reduction and the final reduction.

I made this exactly as listed and it turned out perfectly!  Very flavorful and moist.  I did not wrap it in foil once I took it out of the oven, we ate it right away. I can't see ever buying a Costco chicken again.

I will definitely make this again! It was so delicious and juicy. I did not have any nutmeg, so I doubled up the other three spices and left the salt and sugar the same. It did set my smoke alarm off twice, so I'll have to do something about that next time. Best roasted chicken I have ever made, and a new fave for my husband. Thanks!

I made this for dinner guest the other night. And man-o-man was it AMAZING!  Don't forget you need to prep the chicken a day in advance. That  is the only draw back, if you can call it that. Also it is key that you let rest before cutting into. Otherwise this is so simple and so yummy you just have to make it!! This chicken came out  juicy and tender. I used a 4 lbs organic chicken. I think next time I'll plan on a bit bigger bird. We had no leftovers to speak of. If I did, I was planning on chicken tacos or burritos. But no such luck- that bird was gone in minutes!  If your a chicken fan, you should try this recipe. I truly believe that you will not be disappointed!!!

This is one of our all time favorites! I double the seasonings (I cook a really BIG chicken) and put a good portion of them under the skin. I try to let it set for several hours to overnight but I don't always succeed! About half way through I flip it breast side up. Sometimes I vary it a little by basting it with pan juices plus honey, or a honey/balsamic vinegar mix.

Best chicken. So juicy. I stuffed it with 1/2 onion, a clementine cut in half, and a stem of fresh ginger. I made a rub of fresh garlic, rosemary, herbs of providence, pepper, celery powder liquid amino and olive oil. I finished with a salt rub. It took a little longer and I tented it with tinfoil. I cooked it by 10  minutes each time until reached 175. Then I took it out, put cover on roaster over tinfoil and it cooked to 180. Wonderful temperature guidelines.

This was so good and moist. I rubbed the spices under the skin as well as on top. I also added a chopped up onion inside the cavity along with fresh minced garlic. Only marinated all day rather than 24 hours. Will definitely make it again.

Don't laugh but...

This is the absolute first whole chicken I've ever roasted, let alone prepared. And guess what?  NO ONE COMPLAINED!!!

Everyone thought it was great and was shocked that this was my first chicken. My boyfriend/love of my life was a bit upset that I chose this chicken over turkey for Thanksgiving but when he took his first bite he smiled. 

A Total Success!!!

I really enjoyed the flavors that came through in this recipe!! I've made various types of baked and broiled chicken many times over the years, and it would be hit or miss on whether the chicken came out moist or not or well seasoned or kinda bland. I found this simple recipe, amd to be honest, I didn't have the time to marinate the chicken, since it was needed for tonight's dinner, but  otherwise I just followed the recipe as written, and popped it right into the oven....and it still came out great! Very moist, tender and full of flavor. I will definitely make this chicken again, and next time will do the 24 hour marinate, I'm sure it will be even better!

I've made this many times. My family loves it. They ask for it again and again. Super easy.  I add a 1/4 " of broth to bottom of pan and roast veggies since I use convection and I'm afraid it will dry out. The original spices combo not only taste great, they make your home smell amazing.

I made this chicken last night and made the spice rub exactly as written except that I doubled it. I put some of the rub under the breast skin and then rubbed the rest all over the chicken, and let it sit covered in the frig overnight.  I did change the cooking method a bit as I roast chickens in a NuWave oven and they always come out very moist  and fully cooked in about an hour. The chicken smelled really good when it was roasting, but as with most rubs, the spices stay on the skin and don't get much into the meat. I sliced the breast thin to share it with my mother. So there were strips of the skin still on the meat. The flavor of the spices was a lot better than I expected considering the unusual combination of spices. I gave it 4 stars only because none of the flavor seeped into the meat.

My husband and children REALLY like this chicken.   One son thought it smelled like ham -- it does have a similar flavor to the glazed hams we've gotten from Costco.  So its a surprise with chicken - but very tasty!

Doubled the rub (excluding salt) for two small chickens.  Cooked with cubed potatoes covered in olive oil, butter, salt and pepper.  Flipped birds over halfway through.  My husband says it was the best meal I've ever made...makes me wonder what was wrong with all my other meals over the last 26 years :-)

wow.. I don't often bother to leave a review when all the others have covered it... but this is so good!  I was super skeptical about the combo (and even subbed a Splenda packet for the sugar) and it still came out mouth-watering! !!

Other  than following someone's suggestion to double the spices I made this exactly as instructed and it turned out fantastically well. I added sweet and regular potatoes, onions, and celery to the pan as the "sides" which also turned out really well. I'll definitely make this again and would only make changes if I didn't have something on hand.

We have made this a few times and we really enjoy it! It makes a very moist, flavourful chicken. When we buy multiple chickens at Costco, we like to rub this one down and throw it in the fridge while cooking the first one with other recipes from this site. We've let it marinate in its rub for up to several days and always love it. Strictly following the recipe, we don't find it salty enough and we've tended to increase the salt and the spices.

I didn't have any garlic cloves or allspice so I used a pinch of seasoning salt, onion powder and garlic powder.  Also, I did not have time for it to marinate so I mixed all the ingredients with margarine and poured/rubbed on chicken cooking it 425 for an hour.

Had to grind my own cloves as well.

I LOVE THIS!!! Chicken was extremely tender and moist. I added seasoning salt, celery, sweet pepper and garlic powder as oppose to whole garlic. Will try again and double to sugar….thumbs up my husband loved it.

I'm not a big fan of this spice combo on a chicken, but it was definitely the juiciest chicken I've ever had and there was a ton of drippings in the pan to make gravy. I will use only this cooking method from now on!

Boy was this delicious! Definitely a great dinner option that is different then a typical salt and garlic chicken.  I put celery inside and around the bottom of the pan around the chicken. The celery bakes well and  becomes sweet and nicely crunchy yet soft.  I typically roast the chicken upside down for the first half then flip it the second half so it is crunchy on both sides.

I also slice slits into a few strategic places on the chicken so that I can shove thin pieces of butter and a garlic clove under the skin to promote a boost of flavor under the skin. 

I highly recommend to try this recipe. And you don't have to rub the seasoning 24 hours before hand I did it just 4 hours before I was going to cook it and it did just fine.

Made the chicken on Sunday and it was wonderful.  Moist, tender and flavorful.   My chicken was almost 6lbs so I doubled the spices.  The best part was using the carcass to
make chicken stock.  Used the stock for the best chicken noodle soup ever.  The flavor of the spices  comes through but not over powering.  Will certainly do this again.

I make this at least twice a year -- which might not sound like a lot, but for me in my house, it is!  My family doesn't know your recipe exists.  They think it's all mine!  I've coined this as "Dad's famous chicken" so please, if you ever meet my family, I will deny your existence.  I hope they never discover this website!  :)

In all due seriousness, great recipe.  Never any leftovers with this one (family of 4)!

This recipe is perfect.  Like many others, I was hesitant about using such an interesting mix of spices, but I'm so glad I took a leap of faith and give this baby a go!  It's hands down the best chicken I've ever had.  I've doubled the spices, which is good, but mostly just make it as is.  Either way won't disappoint!

Delicious flavor and very easy.  I cooked mine about 30 minutes longer because the thermometer kept saying it wasn't done.... I wish I had taken my chances because I feel like it would have been juicier.  Interesting mix of spices that works!  I put a rack on a foil lined cookie sheet so wasn't able to add veggies.  Ended up adding some chicken stock to baste with an then poured some in the bottom of the pan to decrease the smoking.

Prepped the bird (4.25 lbs) plus carrots, celery, onion and baby gold potatoes the night before. About 1.5x on the spices worked well for this size per other reviewers. Before putting it in the oven I added about a cup of broth to the pan and some butter under the skin ;) Followed the recipe roasting times and temps and I had a delicious, easy meal in just over an hour! It's a really good way to cook chicken and its budget and leftover friendly.

This recipe is great! Yes it's got an unusual combination of spices, but they are wonderful. It has a Moroccan flavor which a nice change from the usual thyme, rosemary salt and pepper flavor that we all are accustomed to. If you want to try something a little different, I recommend that you give this a try. After the first time I cooked my chicken this way,, I used a more moderate oven temperature (400 degrees and 375 degrees) because of the splatter and smoke.

Love this recipe! Followed the original recipe mostly, except I added two quartered lemon pieces inside together with garlic and I didn't prep chicken for over night. It turned out excellent!! The skin was so crispy yummy, and the inside was juicy with plenty of garlic lemon aroma. At first, I was concerned about the cooking temperature being a bit higher (500/450 for 15 min each) than the typical whole chicken cooking, but it did help the skin be so crispy and full of flavor. Also basting is important as it helps prevent the skin being overcooked and dry (I used a brush to baste), and adds more flavor throughout the entire cooking time. I didn't need to double the amount of spice, it was plenty for my whole chicken. This roasted chicken recipe is my go-to roast chicken recipe now :)

This is the first time I roasted a whole chicken. I was worried a bit about the spices, the sugar and the reviewers saying it tasted like pie. My chicken cooked perfectly, tasted great, no overpowering by the cinnamon, nutmeg and such, and was moist and delicious. I also doubled the amount of spices (not the salt and sugar) and added rosemary, black pepper and turmeric. This will be my go to recipe for roasting a whole chicken and I will be cooking that often.

I have made hundreds of roast chickens but this is the only way I will ever roast chicken again!! So moist and juicy,  next time I'll marinate :) I made a gravy out of the drippings and it was all so good we ended up dunking chicken pieces in it when supper was done.  Excellent recipe thank you so much!  Served with Roast Sweet Potatoes  and Onions from this site.

I did not think that the combination of ingredients for the rub could ever be this delicious.  Thank you for proving my prediction wrong.  The house smells awesome .... and we have 3 out of 3 thumbs up.  I did turn the chicken over to brown the breast.  Juicy and ahhhh.  Put some water in the bottom of the pan to make a sauce.  Also made the recommended chimichurri sauce (my first taste of that sauce & it was impressive).

My husband and I aren't big fans of sweet mixed with savory, so I was pretty sure we wouldn't like this. He convinced me to try it, though, after telling me it wouldn't be the end of the world if I ruined one chicken.  Boy, was I wrong and boy, was I glad he suggested it.  I didn't detect any sweetness from the sugar, but the result was so flavorful, juicy and delicious.  We will definitely have this again.

Very enjoyable, a nice change from my usual herb-roasted or citrus chicken.  Since this recipe popped up in my inbox on a day I planned to roast a chicken anyway, I decided to give it a try.  I tend to agree with others who think these spices are a little offbeat for a chicken recipe, but I didn't mind it, the chicken was moist and flavorful.

Substituted the sugar with honey but otherwise made it as-is.

This is awesome!  Leave the chicken in the oven as you change the temperature.  I made this exactly as written the first time. The second time I changed the spices, but kept the exact measurements.  My girls weren't sure of the clove, cinnamon combo so next time I used basil, oregano, thyme, garlic powder mix. This is by far the best way to cook a whole chicken!

I found this easy recipe in one of your sample magazines awhile back and just so happens I was making it again tonight when I got the email sharing it. I've shared this recipe with many. Wonderful, surprising flavor, chicken comes out moist and leftovers can be used in many ways. Gotta try, perfect for family and guests.

I tripled the spices except for the salt.  It was delicious!  Used more garlic as well.  I loosened nearly all the skin and sprinkled the spices directly on the meat.  I also cooked it in the slow cooker for about 5 hours--on low for 4, high for 1.  Maybe try making a sauce (gravy) out of the juices?

Okay. This was only my second time cooking a whole chicken, but it is at least the 10,000th time I've eaten chicken and THIS CHICKEN IS THE BEST. The delicious seasoning and juicy, juicy meat due to the smart use of oven temperatures are worth writing about. 

I followed some other reviewers comments and doubled the spices (except the salt, and added both garlic and onion to the cavity. I also cooked in ontop of mini red potatoes and put a cup of chicken broth in the bottom of the pan. I butter basted once halfway through. Using an oven meat thermometer made the cooking stress free and I got a perfect chicken.  The potatoes were also delicious and my chicken leftovers are still so flavorful!

This is going to become a staple in my house. Thank you!

This is so delicious! We double the cloves, allspice, nutmeg, cinnamon, and sugar. Goes great on a whole chicken, or any type of chicken with bone in. This is our simple, "go to" recipe for chicken!

DO THIS RECIPE!!!!!!!  The best and JUICIEST roast chicken I have EVER had!  I doubled the ingredients and added garlic on the inside with whole onions.  Since I don't like eating the skin, next time I'll also put the seasoning under the skin  to add more of that deliciousness!  I did cooking times as directed and basted during the seating period.  My family LOVES this.  We also did the roasted honey potato recipe from this site as a side and was a HUGE hit!  Will be doing this again for company.

Moist and delicious!  I doubled the spices, but not the salt and rubbed them both under the skin and all over the outside.  I still wanted the flavor to be a little stronger. The skin was just so good.  I didn't have any drippings left when it was done, but I bet a gravy would have been great with these flavors.  It was so good either way and I will definitely use this recipe again.

great recipe!  Doubled the spices and put a quartered onion in the chicken.  I put the spices on 2 hours before cooking and had no problems.

Tasted great.  Nice crispy skin and moist inside.  However, what a mess it created!  The high heat made the fat sizzle, and coated the oven with grease, which then started smoking.  The whole house filled up with smoke and set off the smoke detector!  And the oven will take awhile to clean.  

I'm not sure if it will come out the same covered in aluminum foil, but I'll have to do that next time.

I've made this chicken for 2 years now.  The seasonings are excellent and the method results in a very moist meat with a crunchy, crisp skin.

Great recipe! My chicken was partially frozen so I cooked it a little longer than suggested, I mixed the spices with 2 T softened butter, then rubbed it on the chicken.I also turned it over after 30 minutes to allow the breast to brown. Gravy made with the pan drippings had great depth of flavor from the spices..A wonderful Sunday supper

Loved the different spices, however cooking at such high temperatures without covering led to overcooked skin. Second time around I adjusted the oven temperature and covered the chicken for the final 30 minutes, came out with perfect skin.

This was my first time making a whole chicken and my first time adding "sweet" ingredients to chicken, and it was absolutely DELICIOUS!!! My husband and kids loved it! I did not have cloves or allspice, but I used ground ginger along with the rest of the ingredients (which I doubled). I did not marinade the chicken, and I stuffed it with onions and minced garlic. I started roasting at 500, but I lowered the temp about 3 times to prevent my fire alarm from going off. Best chicken I ever had!!!

Incredible.  I followed the recipe but only marinated in the refrigerator for 6 hours. This was amazing! I have been an allrecipes.com fan for a number of years now and this is only the second review that I have done....but I had to say something about this recipe!! The chicken was so juicy and the flavors surprised me.  This skin was perfect and crispy...YUM! I will be adding this one to my regular cooking calendar without a doubt.  Thanks for sharing!

This was really good, however, I read the reviews and took the advice of others to double the spices . . . next time I will just go with the recipe because I thought it was just a bit over spiced.  Also, I did not put the spices on a day ahead of time, but just before putting it in the oven.  The chicken was juicy on the inside & the skin was crispy on the outside.  Really surprised at how good it was.  One additional thing, I went by the time on the recipe & should have checked with a thermometer because the breasts were a little undercooked & had to put them back in after cutting the chicken up.

Who ever thought of cinnamon on chicken has got to be genius!! I was a little unsure but this was out of this world!! It was the 1st time I've made a whole chicken & it was as good as the store bought rotisserie chickens! I doubled the spices as everyone recommended & rubbed it on & under the skin. I added a little garlic powder to the rub & sprinkled some inside the chicken & stuffed it with an onion. My only reason for not giving this amazing chicken 5 stars was that it was WAYYYY too salty! Next time I will only do 1 tsp salt even though I double the other spices. Otherwise best chicken dinner ever!!!

Turned out better than I thought. I have never cooked a whole chicken and this was very easy to do. I didn't have any allspice or nutmeg, so I added ginger. I also doubled all the spices. I also tried to lift up some of the skin and insert spices that way. I didn't have time to marinate, I just threw it in the oven. I cooked mine a lil bit longer than suggested because I was looking for of a more golden crisp to the skin. Everybody really loved this chicken!

This is the most amazing way to cook a whole chicken.  My family adored it and the leftovers added a wonderful flavor to a custom shepherds pie.  I doubled the spices as well, and added an onion to the chicken cavity.  Enjoy!

Chicken was moist but mushy.  I did not care for the clove/nutmeg/allspice smell while it was cooking.

Just made this for the 2nd time - same excellent results - however my husband smoothered it in barbecue sauce to get more flavor.  So maybe I won't go through the work again though it is very moist - excellent - turned over near the end to brown better.

Completely amazing recipe.  My family of four loved it so much, my son asked to have it prepared for his birthday dinner.  We like it even better after the leftovers were removed from the bone and sauce/drippings were poured over the top.

Great flavor and super moist ! Next time I'll try it as a slow roasted chicken at a lower temperature. The high temps in this receipe made a mess in the oven.

My family loved this chicken. This recipe is a keeper! It was extremely easy to prepare and the meat was so moist and had a lot of flavor. It did take a little longer to cook my chicken then one hour. Be sure to check the chickens interior temp before serving.

Wow!  This was really, REALLY good!  I am amazed at how juicy this came out - without butter, or basting!! The spiced flavor was really something different and WONDERFUL.  I did double the spice mix, as recommended by reviewers, and I also added broth to the bottom of the roasting pan, which made a fantastic gravy.  This will be a keeper, for sure.  :)

I LOVE this recipe.  The seasoning is so different from most chicken recipes!  I like to serve it with roasted sweet potatoes and a huge garden salad.  Family and friends go crazy over this chicken!

I really liked this method of cooking the chicken.  It was perfectly done.  However, I was not a huge fan of the spices.   I will definitely make this again using the same cooking method with different spices.

OMG!!!  You have got to try this recipe.

The most moistest and tastiest chicken I have ever had. Even my son loved it. Did as suggested doubled the spices except the salt. Marinated it for about 2 hours in the fridge, (last minute decision to try this) Turned out great. Added carrots, potatoes and parsnips around the chicken, garlic and onion in the cavity. Definetly the way I will make roast chicken from now on. Wonder how it would be on Turkey? Going to try it and find out.

I'm used to cooking a whole chicken in the crockpot and thought I'd try making it a new way with this recipe.  I made the mistake of roasting my chicken without the skin, which tried out the outter layer of meat.  The ingredients are okay and work better that I thought they might, but it was not as herb-flavored as I would prefer.

It was my first time try to make roast chicken and it was huge hit!! My husband loved it!!

I used 6lb chicken so I doubled ingredients. I didn't get enough juice to baste it, so I just added lil bit of olive oil.

I am going to use this recipe over and over!!

I have never in life cooked a whole chicken.  Since I've found this recipe, I have made this twice and making it again today.  Thanks for sharing.  My family loves it.  I've also shared this recipe with my co-workers.

Was always afraid to try a whole chicken, but they were 1/2 price so I went for it.  I loved it and hubby really loved it.  Will use this recipe again!

I only posted 4 stars, because the chicken was a little dry. But I really enjoyed the flavor. Very good flavor and the chicken was beautiful when it came out of the oven.

I'm cooking it right now but wasn't sure what kind of pan to use.  I'm just using a square cake pan without a rack so I can put vegis.  I hope this comes out great like the reviews.  THis is my first try.

Love this rub for roasted chicken. I've used it several times and it's always a hit. The juices at the bottom of the roasting pan make for an excellent gravy!

No changes made.  I loved this, as did my three picky kids.  My equally picky husband did not.  Something about the spices just didn't appeal to him.  Still, an excellent recipe for 4/5 of my family!

This is the first chicken I've ever roasted and it was delicious! I followed the recipe as it was and was impressed with how simple it is to follow. I'm not a fan of complicated recipes, so this was perfect for me! My husband loved it and was really excited when he saw me preparing a chicken to roast again a few weeks later. Thank you SO much to Indriani for posting this super easy and delicious recipe!

This was great, I added 1/2 the salt and doubled the cinnamon - best chicken I've ever eaten, I've made this recipe at least ten times in 3-4 months.

This was soooooo yummy!  I didn't have ground cloves, nutmet or allspice.....but I did everything else, and added ground pepper.  I marinaded all night, put in the over the next afternoon, along w/ onions, carrots and potatoes.  I added 1 cup of water about 1/2 way through the cooking and the juice it made was excellent!  I've never made a chicken that I liked or my kids liked.  They are always dried out and blah!  I can't thank you enough for this fabulous recipe!

The combination of these spices with chicken is surprising and delicious!  I usually double the spice and I never plan a day ahead so the spices go on just a few minutes before it goes in the pan.  My whole family loves it and I've even given the recipe to friends.

I loved the flavors.  I now wish I'd done what other commenters suggested and doubled the spices.  I also added an onion to the garlic inside the chicken. I covered the chicken loosely with foil once it was brown and crispy looking enough.  I needed to cook my 4lb chicken for an extra 15-20 minutes.  The chicken was wonderfully juicy and tender, the skin crisp.  Yum!

I roasted this chicken for a little over and hour, excatly following the directions and the chicken wasn't cooked! I was having family over for dinner and I only ended up serving the chicken breast because it done but the thighs and legs were still uncooked. I don't know what went wrong. The spices for the chicken are very good and I will try this again just cook it for a lot longer then suggested.

My husband said this was the best chicken he'd ever tasted and i agree.....it was!!!  I used all kinds of veggies on the bottom of the roasting pan and let them cook in the drippings.  Wow!!!  It doesn't even need to marinate.  Putting the seasonings under the skin was an awsome suggestion. I put sweet vidalia onion AND freshly crushed garlic inside the bird. Also, cooking the chicken breast side down is brilliant!!  All the juices seep right into the meat. Absolutely scrumcious!  Thanks.

Not a homerun, but could have been due to using too much clove powder when I doubled the recipe. I was also out of nutmeg, so I used pumpkin spice. I made a gravy from blending the cooked onion with the drippings = delicious.

This was my first roasted chicken.  I used a Caribbean jerk rub instead, which still came out very well!  I love how quickly this chicken can be prepared, plus it always turns out juicy and tender.  Sometimes, I use Italian herb blends or give a Mexican flavor with some of the fabulous blends available on the market.  For a roast chicken recipe, I'm very satisfied with the cooking time on this one, and the really crispy skin doesn't hurt it one bit either...and I hate chicken skin!

This was a great and easy recipe. It was so simple and yet tasted so delicious. I doubled the spices as others suggested, and i tightly wrapped the chicken in plastic to marandaide to keep the spices on the skin. I have never had such a juicy chicken. I will make this again and again im sure.

This recipe is easy. I don't even let it marinate. I just add all the spices on the chicken and start the cooking process. It's always a hit and I love making leftover sandwhiches with it the next day. I am so happy a friend sent me this recipe!

For me, the secret to this chicken being so delicious isn't the spices, it's the cooking method. It sears the outside and keeps the juices in. My fiance is allergic to cinnamon and nutmeg, but we'll put whatever we have on hand around the outside, and cook any chicken like that and it comes out fantastic. Works for turkey, too - my first Thanksgiving was a hit because of this! I make it a few times a month now, regularly.

WOW!! I don't know what I could say that hasn't already been said. I followed the recipe as written, except I omitted the garlic. My hubby and I loved it. I ordinarily don't like the skin on poultry, but, this was so beautifully black and so tasty, I ate the skin last night. The rest of the chicken is for dinner tonight.  I did double the amount of spices, and let it marinate for about 8 hours.  When I do roast chicken, I will cook it this way. Thanks for a simply great, and inexpensive recipe.

Wow! Good thing I read the reviews because this combination of seasonings seemed so odd to me. This was amazing! I used a 4.5lb chicken, doubled the spices and rubbed it under the skin. After the first 20 minutes, the skin was almost burnt so I did cover it with foil for the rest of the cooking time. I cooked it for 20 min, 20, min, then 40 minutes. Delicious!

This simple whole roasted chicken is full of flavor and just melts in your mouth.  The sweet aroma fills the home with wonderful scents that hints of the middle east. The adorable chihuahuas stand by the oven to breath it in.   This is truly the only way I roast chickens since i first tried it aver 3 months ago.    The only addition to the recipe I made was Taraagon because i think it needed a different color to all the brown seasonings. When I make this, I like to eat it with a greek salad with family recipe dressing topped with feta cheese, garlic, onions and cucumbers to compliment all the flavors.    Seriously, I am always telling everyone i know about this recipe, IT IS THAT GOOD!!!

This was great! My husband and I both LOVED it. I cooked sweet potatoes, potatoes, carrots, onions, and peppers in the pan too, and the juices were delicious. I flipped the chicken halfway through and it worked great. We had to cook it a little longer than the recipe called for -- about 15 more min. We'll definitely make this again.

This was really easy - I followed the directions exactly and the chicken turned out really moist.  My husband wasn't the biggest fan - not sure he liked the sweetness but I loved it! I put potatoes in the pan and they were yummy - obviously very greasy but the flavor was great!

OMG!  This is great!  I'm glad I read the reviews because I would never have made this given the ingredients.  I tried to make gravy, but it didn't have much flavour - but doesn't need it because it's so juicy!  There is nothing left of the chicken - not even enough to make soup!

Heavenly! The aroma while it cooked made my children hover around the kitchen, I kept telling them, "it's just a chicken!" LOL My husband has been requesting it ever since. I'm back here today to get the recipe so I can use it for our Thanksgiving turkey.

I shouldnt really be reviewing this recipe, because i use a completely different spice blend of what i had on hand.  I just used this as a guideline for cooking times.  Based on the other reviews tho, I'm definitely going to have to make it this way next time.

This is definitely one of my favorite recipes.  The house smells so yummy while cooking!  I double the spices and place a large white onion in the cavity with the garlic.  It always seems to take me about 20 minutes more to reach 180 degrees internally but well worth the wait.  Everyone loves it!

I cooked two chickens in a clay pot (soaked the pot and lid in water for 30 minutes first) with this recipe and added one cup of jasmine rice to the broth in the bottom of the pot.  Placed in a cold oven, then cooked for 1 hour at 400 degrees, turned oven off and let it finish under steam for another 30 minutes.  We ate one chicken at a weekend bluegrass festival (triple wrapped the bird in aluminum foil and buried it in hot ashes in the campfire for about 45 minutes)Everybody love it! I brought the other bird back home for chicken and dumplin's (home made pasta recipe) added onion, celery, garlic and carrots for that bird.  Both were delicious! And the rice was the best I've ever had.  This is a keeper.

This recipe is great as is! I personally like the salt reduced by 1/2 (I am somewhat salt sensitive and bloat up) but even with the full salt it is GREAT! My husband and 3 picky boys LOVED it.  Thank you for a GREAT, EASY Sunday chicken recipe.

OK here is whats special about this recipe. The cooking time(s). I was skeptical that 1 hour would work but it was wonderful. I used my own spice combo but the cooking time made it moist and wonderful. The spice combo sounds wonderful but  we all really wanted garlic. Great method to cook a whole chicken. I made the two 15 minute times 20 minutes because mine was a 5 lbs. I also stood mine up on a pop can filled with broth.  Very good moist chicken.

I love this recipe.  I always quadruple the amount I just don't thing that doubling it is enough spices) and make two whole roasted chickens.  One is eaten right away and the other is carved for leftovers. My whole family loves this recipe.

This certainly did NOT disappoint!  I can see why it keeps getting five stars.  This was the juciest roasted chicken I have ever had.  I roasted it exactly as the recipe stated and it was absolutely delectable.  I did not care for the spice rub at all...I prefer more savory spices.  Next time I will just make my own rub, but will definately cook the chicken just as this was.  SO DELICIOUS.  I think this is one of those recipes that just can't go wrong!

This was a huge hit!  I did modify a little: left out the sugar and salt as well as used an orietal five spice combo that I got from Ocean State Job Lot that had most of the spices (saved time!). I also didn't marinate over night and it was still great! Definitely a keeper!

Like others, I was intrigued and a bit skeptical about the spice ingredients.  While it was cooking, I was still a bit unsure.  The scent reminded me of the honey-baked ham we get at Christmas and I wasn't sure if that would translate well onto the chicken.

I followed the recipe exactly, except I brushed some melted butter 30 minutes in and added a cup of boiling water (didn't have any smoking!).  The chicken turned out very moist and delicious.

I will be using this recipe again.  Next time I may substitute brown sugar for white and try to make my own honey-baked Christmas ham!

I made this for the first time tonight. My husband raved over it. As others suggested I doubled the spices, and I cooked it right away instead of refrigerating it. I didn't have any garlic cloves, so I substituted garlic salt in place of the regular salt, and added it to the other spices instead of inside the cavity. A

fter rubbing the spices on the outside of the bird I used the remaining spices in the cavity, and stuffed it with an onion. This recipe goes great with the oven roasted potatoes submitted by JMRYGH.

This recipe is awesome! The sweetness of the cinnamon and sugar along with the nutmeg and other spices contrasts well with the garlic not to mention that the aroma while it is cooking is enticingingly wonderful!

I am happy with this recipe because of its simplicity. The flavor was decent. I also followed the advice to double the spices…except salt, as I was avoiding over salting for someone w/ high blood pressure. I also made a delish gravy from the stuff in that little sac in the cavity. I think this is the perfect recipe to use for leftover chicken recipes as well, as the flavor is not too distinct.

Doubled the amount of spices, as others suggested.  Also added carrots and potatoes.  Wonderful flavor.  You could tell that some spices were added, but nothing was overwhelming.  It was hard to pinpoint exactly what the spices were when eating it, you just knew that it tasted great!

I was making the chicken just to pull apart for Chicken Enchiladas, of course we had to taste it before shredding it THE BEST!!!  Needless to say we had fantastic enchiladas that night and made the chicken dinner later in the week.  Thank You

If you like a brown and crispy skin on your roast chicken, this is the method for you! This chicken was fast, easy and came out great. The meat was tender and juicy. Perfect! The garlic flavor was definitely detectable throughout the meat, so if you're not a garlic lover (like my picky kids), I'd lessen the amount of garlic.

Incredible- so easy and husband said it was the best chicken ever. I used pumpkin pie spice instead of allspice since i didnt have any. I thought the spices were crazy, couldnt believe how amazing they tasted. Also, had to add broth after fire alarm went off with smoking bird about 15 minutes in.  This is a huge winner!

Just totally fantastic. I, too, cooked it at 225 for 15 minutes and then turned it down to 350 for an hour. It was amazingly succulent and my very picky husband devoured it. I'll definitely make this one again!

Very simple, delicious recipe. I made this as a one pot meal and added baby carrots and new potatoes. The vegetables were delicious too! Recipe took longer (about 20 additional minutes) to cook to even reach 165 degrees. I baked in LeCreuset casserole and clean up was easy. One comment indicate that there wasn't enough pan drippings - I ended up with 1 1/2 cups remaining. I fixed the Chimichurri sauce as others recommended - and while I loved that sauce, the flavor of this roasted chicken stands alone and doesn't need the Chimichurri.

I was a bit skeptical about these ingredients but it turned out to be so good. Very flavourful and juicy, probably due to roasting with the breast-side down first. Will make this again for sure.

Amazing!  Delicious!  Tender! Following changes were made: You do not need to cook chicken to 180 anymore. The USDA says it's safe to cook to 165, then cover with foil for 20 min.  That'll let the juices redistribute and bring the temp up.  Plus it makes it juicer!  I didn't have allspice so I didn't use it. I doubled the spices and rubbed half of them UNDER the skin (omg so good). I used Stevia instead of sugar. I stuck an onion in with the garlic - not necessary I don't think. With about 10-15 min left to cook I flipped the bird over to make the breast skin crisp too. Holy moly. I think I'll be making this at least once a week. It's less savory and more...baking spice-esque, but it goes great with the chicken. I made switch up the spices too but still use the same cooking method. It was that perfect.

This is recipe makes the most tender and juicy chicken, especially the white meat!  I followed the recipe with the exception of doubling the spices.  I was a little leary of these spices and the sugar, but was definitely glad I had tried it!  There was nothing left of the 6 lb. chicken!  It fed 3 adults and 3 small children!  It also makes the house smell wonderful!  Definitely a keeper!

I've NEVER roasted a whole chicken before, and I think this is the PERfect recipe for first timers! I think the recipe is really awesome! The meat was SO juicy! It's probably the juiciest roasted chicken I've ever had. I doubled the spices and added some chopped onion as others had suggested. I didn't have time to marinate it overnight, but I think next time I'll try doing that so that the flavors can really get in the meat. Anyway, thumbs up!

This recipe turned out really well for me, but I'm not sure it was totally by design. I don't have a lot of experience with whole chicken, so I don't know if the juices usually stay inside the skin most of the cooking time -- when I went to baste there was nothing in the pan to baste with because all the juice was still in there. This phenomena kept the chicken super moist, and really infused the garlic flavor. I did not marinate overnight; I put the spice mixture right on and cooked. From the taste I think it would have been overwhelming if it had been allowed to sit 24 hours. Immediate baking worked fine. I also added 1/2 chopped onion to the garlic on the inside. No smoke problems; I turned down the heat a little bit and it still cooked through. The flavor was unique; my boyfriend really loved it -- I will make it again!

Elegant! It was very moist and the flavors infused nicely!  This was by far the best roast chicken I have had.  I would add that there weren't too many drippings, so I would add about a cup of boiling water to the pan so that you can capitolize on the drippings for gravy.

Excellent recipe. Super moist chicken. I would never think to put these ingredients together but the taste was awesome. My husband loved it too. Only thing was that I had to cook the chicken longer than the stated time. Try it, you won't be disappointed.

This chicken was the most flavorful and tender that I have ever cooked or tasted!  I went out on a limb and cooked it for my in-laws based on the reviews.  Didn't have overnight but it didn't matter.  I doubled the spices and rubbed a generous amount between the breast and the skin.  While cooking, my mother-in-law kept asking if I was doing it correctly because of the smoke...after her insistance to help was calmed by a glass of wine, we were all amazed at the depth of flavor this easy dish had.  Absolutely wonderful.  Two notes...added a cubed onion in the cavity with the garlic and deglazed the pan drippings with chicken stock and 1/4 cup flower/water mixture (added later with sauteed mushrooms in butter) to make the most flavorful gravy that complimented the mashers and chicken.  What a hit!

This was so easy and so good. Came out nice an moist. Although I did eventually turn it breast side up so it would brown as well. Will always roast a chicken this way now.

The taste is a 5 star. The procedure is a 4 star.  Actually, the next time I do this I will have to use extra chicken broth or add water because the extreme heat evaporates the liquid and then it burns.  I would also tent the chicken for the first two heatings to prevent it from burning. I think the sugar in the rub burns with the high heat.  Having said this, the taste was out of this world.  My family loved it. I will be doing this again.  Gravy was yummy. PS I double the spices.

Yum!  I keep the spices, minus the garlic in a sealed container to have ready anytime, we've tried it on a variety of meats.  Great recipe!

If I could give this 100 stars I would.  It's seems like such an odd combo of flavors, but they really work.  The whole chicken was full of flavor not just the skin.  I have a house full of kids and a discriminating husband and everyone said this was the best chicken they had ever had.  Even though the spices seem very "autumn" I do not feel like this is a dish that needs to be at all limited to the fall or winter months.  We will have this over and over again.

It was okay, my chicken was a lot bigger then called for so it took a really long time to cook and was in the end dry. I would try the rub again, just not on a whole chicken.

I didn't let this sit the 24 hours, and next time I will.  The spice combination was delightfully different, and my family really liked the sweetness of it.  I will make this again.

Easy, but nothing too special (as the name implies). I probably won't make this exact recipe again. I'd change it a lot to give it more kick.

Oh, yummy!  I tried this recipe last week and it was so delicious!  Baking time was right on...my 2 year old ate it almost faster than I could pull it off the bone for her!  I'm making it again tonight but using boneless chicken breasts since I don't have a whole chicken on hand.  I'll be using this for cornish game hens as well.  Thanks for a terrific recipe!

This was wonderful!!  I didn't have nutmeg or cloves so I doubled the cinnamon and allspice.  My husband and 3 year old daughter loved it.  They ate most of it before I had a change to get some!!  Thanks!!

This is similar in flavor to roasted duck from Asian markets. Doesn’t seem to make a difference whether it’s cooked breast side up or down. Simply THE BEST roasted chicken I have ever eaten!

Excellent chicken recipe!  I lined my roasting pan as suggested by others and also kept a lid on the pan for the first 15 minutes.  Had no problem with the high temp and smoking.  Very moist and flavorful.  Will definitely be making this recipe again and again.  Thank you!

Flavor was good and chicken was tender but the appearance needs work. I cut out the ribs and opened the chicken so that all breast and thigh layed flat and sprinkled garlic powder generously all over it and the spices on the other side. It only got to sit about 45 min because I just found this recipe today. However I will try this again soon using the proper marinating time.

This chicken was delicious.  Moist, very flavorful and just fantastic.  My kids ate it without any complaint and asked for more.  The only thing I did differently was baste it with some olive oil over the spices and baked it for 2 1/2 hours at 350 instead of how it's posted.  I avoided the splattering & smoke mentioned in other reviews that way.  Great recipe - thanks!!

Very good, but not as flavorful as the rotisseri chickens at the local supermarkets.  

I found the garlic flavor to be somewhat strong, which I liked but may not be everyone's preference.

There was a lot of splattering in the oven, so I put a small piece of aluminum foil very loosely over the top of the cooking chicken.

I'd tried to imagine what the gathered ingredients would taste like on chicken...What a delightful surprise!  The rub (doubled the recipe) marinated(24hrs and put small slits in the chicken)through and through and was moist and scrumptious!  I'd also made "Chicken Afritada" from this site and I offered both to my son for a taste test and he loved this recipe better and left nothing but the bones.  Put it on the grill, it's delectable !!! A MUST TRY recipe!  Bravo Indriani !!!

May want to make sure it is on the lowest rack in the oven.  It is very good and I will be using it again.

I doubled the ingredients for the rub when I made this. Also, instead of letting the rubbed chicken sit for 24 hours, I let it sit for 1 - 2 hours and then cooked it in a dutch oven or large covered pot. The skin didn't get as crisp, but the lid kept the flavors in and helped them permeate the entire bird (and the potatoes).

This is a great recipe. The unusual ingredients blend well and taste great. I have made this twice, because the flavor is sooo good. However, I still am having trouble with the cooking time. I keep my meat thermometer handy.

Well, this was good, but I think I was concerned about it not being done as other reviewers had expressed, so I cooked it longer and it was a little bit dry.

I like this recipe.  I did not get to leave spices on the recommended time and could not taste them as well as possible but I will next time.  Will try this again.

Great recipe!  I think it may be better as a winter recipe, though.

Wow!   I loved this chicken.  I only let the rub sit for about two hours and it was still delicious.  It was even better leftover.  This one is sure to become a family favorite.

The aroma was wonderful and it tasted
great.  Next time, I will cook two to have leftovers.  Maybe I did something wrong, but I would up throwing the chimichurri sauce out.

I did not follow the spice ingrediants listed in the recipe and I was disappointed.  I was intrigued by the cooking instructions and may try to use them again.  I would cook longer than recipe calls for though.

So moist!! I used all the ingredients called for, however I only left it in the fridge 7 hours.  Followed the cooking instructions and this turned out so moist and yummy.
