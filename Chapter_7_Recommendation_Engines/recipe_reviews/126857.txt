These were amazing! I made them for a dinner party and they were a huge hit. I used fake crab meat because I'm allergic to shellfish. Also, I didn't have any chilli sauce so I substituted a jalepeno, and it was perfect. I also added a tomato to the salsa. I'm making these again tonight to impress my mother at another dinner party, and they will definately be a staple in my recipe box. Thanks for the great recipe!!!

This was a wonderful recipe. Following my tradition, I stuck closely to the directions and ingredients so that I could give it a fair review after.  I used canned crabmeat because it was a lot cheaper, and I also used light mayo to cut down on the calories. For anyone else, I would suggest making the salsa with more mango and less onion. The onion amount was a little overpowering, and we stunk afterwards! I think you can also cut down a lot on the mayo amount--just throw two heaping teaspoons in there, and it will be fine.   This is one of the few recipes that takes just a little work, and somehow ends up tasting spectacular. I would even call this recipe "company worthy." One tip--my bowl of crab mixture did NOT make 16 regular crabcakes--it only made 7 small cakes that had medium to low size thickness. The length of the cakes was about the length of the bottom of a water bottle.) It was enough for me and my husband, but if you're cooking for a family, I would suggest doubling the recipe.   This is a great recipe to make when you don't have too much time to cook. You can also adjust some things to make it more healthy--ie: light mayo, wheat breadcrumbs, etc. This was a fulfilling meal that did not make us feel lethargic--we were able to go the gym soon after eating. Thanks for posting this!

This is without a doubt, one of the best recipes I have reviewed on this site.  I made the crabcakes exactly as written, they formed beautifully and kept their shape nicely while sauteing.  Good ratio of crab to cake, the crab was not overpowered by the other ingredients.  This salsa is excellent, I used jarred mango from the produce isle, which made it a snap to put together.  I drizzled a little EVOO in to keep everything together.  Served over Marrikesh Express mango salsa couscous.  Sincere thanks for a great recipe, well done!  Update 4/9/09 Grilled these on the BBQ last night, that smokey, grilled taste makes them even better.  Held together prefectly.  Just terrific!

This was fabulous!  The salsa is a must...it tastes wonderful.  And grilling them is definitely the way to go.  I doubled the recipe for the cakes and got seven meal sized cakes...about hamburger patty size.  So I think the yield is wrong, but otherwise...don't change a thing!

It was good.  We thought there was way too much onion(I got one of the smaller ones in the store).

These were fantastic. By far the best crab cakes I've ever had. I don't even like mangoes and I LOVED the combination of crab cake and mango salsa. We'll definitely make this recipe again. Thanks!

We altered the recipe to make it less hot for more sensitive palates -- we just didn't put in any hot sauce or jalepenos.  It still turned out FABULOUS!  Best crab cakes my husband has ever had....and I'll be making them again when my in-laws visit.

My husband and daughter both liked these, both the cakes and the salsa. The cakes were easy to form and quite sturdy. We grilled them with no problems with them falling apart on a perforated grill pan. Thanks!

These were fantastic! I probably would have liked even a little more green onion in mine, but next time. We grilled and cooked on the stove. I actually liked the grill flavor more and it was a healthier way to cook. The mango salsa was perfect with it, I added a red pepper to my salsa as well. Will make again!

I enjoyed the crab cakes but I had difficulty with the mango salsa as there was too much cilantro which may have been due to a small mango but will try again.

Delicious!  I added a little lime juice, fresh cilantro and dry mustard.  After I formed patties, I put them in the freezer for 20 minutes and not a single one fell apart.  Summertime favorite now!

The crab cakes were ok, but nothing in the ingredients made them "Caribbean" in my opinion.  I used panko breadcrumbs, one can of crabmeat and one can of claw meat. I let the crab mix chill in the fridge while I made the salsa which definitely helped keep the patties together when I sauteed them.

These were so good!  I've only had crab cakes once before at a banquet and I did not like them so I was a little skeptic but they will be a regular recipe at my house.  They would be good with or without salsa.  I used canned crab and it tured out great.

I never understand crab cake recipes. Including this recipe (followed exactly as above except 1 less onion), the cakes always fall apart completely while cooking.

I didn't care for all of the herbs in the salsa, I thought they overpowered the taste of the mango. Overall a delicious dish thought. The crabcakes were good on their own too. My husband ate them the next morning with his eggs!

My first attempt at crab cakes was good.  I tried to "lighten" up the recipe using low-fat & fat-free items.  They were good.  I did not make the salsa to go with them.  But plan to next time I make these.

I baked mine, they browned nicely (350 20 minutes). Didn't get rave reviews though. I had a rather large buffet for the family on a midweek nite (it was HOT out) so that might have curbed peoples appetites. No complaints but no one asked for the recipe either. I will try again and grill them.

I thought th crab cakes were pretty good, however, I did not care for the salsa. My husband thought this recipe was the best crab cake recipe that he had ever had. I compromised and gave this recipe a 4 instead of at 2 or 3.

These were delicious! This was my first attempt at making crab cakes. I followed the recipe as is except I used Panko bread crumbs. We had seafood for Christmas and I made these as well as the crab fritters recipe and coconut shrimo IV from this site.  Added a fresh green salad on the side.  I'm still getting compliments!

Honestly, these were just okay. The mango salsa does make them better but I feel the crab cakes should be able to stand alone as well. I didn't have anyone reach for seconds and I pretty much had to beg my husband to finish them off (and that NEVER happens!). I might make the mango salsa again, but probably will stick with the other crab cake recipe I found on this web site.

We really like these crab cakes. I make it with fresh crab right out the Pacific.   For storing fresh crab: cook crab same day caught, clean and freeze the crab with in two days. If you can't freeze right away either clean it all out of the shell or clean the back and all insides out and rinse off the yellow. Pack in cooler bottom up with layers of ice. Drain off water from cooler to prevent crab from getting soft. Pack cleaned crab meat in zip-lock bags before putting on ice.  Freeze crab, remove crab when frozen and vacuum pack it for better storage.  De-thaw crab, rinse and put some fresh lemon juice on it. No one knows it isn't fresh.  Fresh ocean crab will die in fresh water. If you need to keep them alive use ocean water.

This was a simple recipe, although I had to improvise a bit! I added a dash of smokey paprika, used panko bread crumbs, light mayo and served with Thai sweet chile sauce as well as store bought mango salsa...   Due to conditions beyond my control, I had to bake my crab cakes in a 375 oven for 20-25 min.  They browned up nicely and came out great. My husband raved about them (and he wasn't just being nice)...  I'll make these again next week for a party without any fear of failure.

These crab cakes were very easy to make, and absolutely delicious! I used 1lb fresh canned crab meat, but it was the crab meat from the 'claw', which is less expensive but was still just as good. For a healthier version i crushed up whole wheat saltine crackers very fine in place of bread crumbs and used light mayo, and just a heaping tablespoon of it. I probably could've gotten away with even less. 3/4 cup definately would've been way to much mayo. Aside from those changes, I followed the rest of the recipe as was. I cooked them in a pan on top of the stove in olive oil. Perfect! The mango salsa was phenominal, i used 2 mangos and 1/2 of a red onion, then followed the rest of the salsa recipe as was. This recipie served 3 adults in my opinion, if you have a big household of alot of hungry people, definately double it! I will definately make this again, sooooooooooo good! And easy!!!

Wow! This is so good! I made these with Italian bread crumbs since they were on hand, and used my roasted red pepper aioli for a dressing. They were amazing!  I can't wait to try the mango, maybe with some coconut panko for the bread crumbs

The crabcakes were yummy, but the mango salsa, as other mention, is what makes this dish. To make the crabcakes gluten free, I left out the breadcrumbs, reduced the mayo to 1/2 cup, and as other suggested, I added Old Bay. I also added a pat of butter in the pan with olive oil instead of vegetable oil. My husband couldn't stop raving about the dish. I think he'd eat the salsa plain. We're not fans of cilantro, so I substituted parsley. I'll definitely use the salsa recipe for other dishes, like pork chops. Yum!

I have tried other crab cake recipes from here, and I have to admit this is better. I didn't wait and chill th formed patties, I just went ahead and cooked them, and they pretty much stayed put. No breaking apart at all. Will keep this recipe but tinker with it to get the desired flavor I am looking for as it was still missing something. Thanks!

This was very good!  I do not like Old Bay seasoning, so recipes without it call to me.  I added some finely chopped red bell pepper & a little more hot sauce.  I think next time I will coat them in panko crumbs before frying them. I made both the mango salsa and a sciracha line aoli to go with them. Nice recipe!

Some great ingredients here and I'll make it again, but I will at least halve the breadcrumbs, if not more. The bread overwhelmed the crab!

Soooo good!  I'm not a big seafood person and these you can taste the crab but they are not overpowering.  I used fresh crab and made them for my husband and in-laws and everyone thought they were delicious.  Made them exact to instructions.

So good! First time I've made crab cakes and they were perfect! I had to make some changes bc thought I had things I didn't, like lime and basil. The main thing is I used crushed ritz crackers instead of bread crumbs bc other recipes I read said they were better when they used the buttery crackers. My mixture was a little wet so then I added some regular bread crumbs. I added tomato and avocado to the mango salsa. I like the flavor combo but also thought it looked prettier.

Good.  I made if for Christmas dinner...crazy.  I wanted something nontraditional that would bring a different happy.  I was really good.  I did have to double the mango and half the amount of onion for my liking.  Nice texture in the cake.
