From a native of New Orleans, this would be perfect if it had garlic powder, onion powder, celery salt and white pepper.  Also, replace the oregano with sage. Just a suggestion.

I needed cajun seasoning for a recipe and whipped this up in no time at all! I loved it as is, but it's very spicy (it IS CAJUN sesoning, after all). The nice thing about making your own is you can control and spice/salt in the seasoning!

I have no idea if this tastes like cajun seasoning, but it was spicy and used all spices I had on hand, so it's a winner in my book.  I so do not need to buy another spice.  Have too many already!  Thanks!

Thank goodness for this site and this recipe! Not only didn't I have to drive to the store (gas) in the midst of cooking (time), but this is a true cajun winner of a spice!!

I can't believe practically no one else is complaining about the salt overkill!  There is WAY too much salt in this recipe.  It was almost inedible.  I would use maybe a teaspoon or two next time.  Watch out!

I followed this recipe, but added 1 tablespoon of garlic powder as well.  This was so salty, my sauce was almost inedible.  Next time I'm cutting the salt in half because the spice was overall perfect.

Very Good!  I like spicy food, but my husband does not and usually store bought cajun seasoning is fairly spicy.  Therefore, I used this recipe and omitted the salt and cayenne pepper.  I omitted the salt because I like to salt my food to taste if it needs any.

I have no idea how authentic this is, but I was in a pinch since I had a recipe that called for cajun seasoning and I never buy pre-mixed spices.  Worked very well in the recipe!  I can definitely see how some garlic and onion powders would have worked well in this as well.

I was making the Easy Slow Cooker Pulled Pork recipe here and needed cajun seasoning.  This was easy to make and I had the ingredients on hand.  Easy peasy!  Thanks.  I've saved the rest in a plastic container for another recipe someday.

this is a great on the fly seasoning blend. i reduced the cayenne because my little girl can handle hot food like the grownups and i used about half the salt. i tried some on a piece of raw potato i was cutting for dinner and opted to add some garlic powder. really easy and we liked this alot. thanks.

Used this seasoning mix to make Cajun Meatballs, an appetizer recipe on this site. I reduced the salt and added some celery seed and garlic powder. Compared to the price of commercial cajun seasoning, this recipe saves you a lot of money since I already had all the spices. My meatballs turned out great and I have the extra seasoning stored in a jar ready to make another batch! Thanks azstud!

This makes some pretty spicy seasoning!  I did half the amount of oregano (personal preference) and subbed ground cumin for the other half.  I made a batch of this and a batch of another cajun seasoning and my husband and I both prefer this one.

i had all these ingredients separately and was stressing because I didn't have the cajun spices... how silly. Cayenne and oregano seem to be the most important from my use in other recipes.

Pretty Good spice mix. I used it for a red beans and rice recipe also from this site. Based on some reviews, I reduced the salt content to 1 tablespoon since I would rather add salt to dishes rather than have things too salty. Had a good kick to it, which I liked.

Same story as many other reviewers, I was out of cajun spice. I had to add onion and garlic powders after my dish was cooked I wished I had added a touch of sugar.

I wanted to make the Southern Pulled Pork recipe but didn't have any Cajun seasoning.  My 8 year old - while brave and adventurous when it comes to food - would probably have found it too spicy so I used 1 t. cayenne, 1 t. ground ancho chili and 1 t. chili powder instead of the 1 T. cayenne.  I also followed suggestions to add a bit of garlic powder and onion powder and it turned out fantastic - slight heat, a lot of flavor.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I scaled this down since I only needed a couple of tbs. and although I liked it, I had to add some garlic and onion powder. It doesn't taste right without those. It was simple and quick to make, though. Thanks! :o)

I added the onion powder, garlic powder and celery seed as suggested, and it works really well in recipes. I personally like my food less spicy, so instead of 1 tablespoon of everything after the salt and oregano, I used one teaspoon, including the recommended additions, which was fine for me. Other family members would like it much spicier, but...

I just used this on some cut up chicken breast along with garllic and onion powder and it was great. I cooked it in some olive oil and then moved the chicken to another pan to brown and added some flour, milk and  it created a great sauce. After I added some pasta to the sauce it tasted better than the cajun pasta that they sell at Friday's!!!!!

What to do when you look in your pantry and all you find is creole spice but you need cajun spice? This recipe was the perfect answer! Thanks. I used this for cajun chicken and it turned out great. I need cajun seasoning all the time and never to remember to get any at the store so this is going to be very handy and well used.

This was pretty tasteless.  Only thing I really noticed (used it on "superfast asparagus" from this site) was the spiciness from the cayenne.

This is an amazing Cajun spice I use it on everything- chicken, steak and especially shrimp. It’s the only spice I actually take the time to make. The store bought ones are not comparable.

excellent flavor. I like mine a little spicier so I added 1 jalapeno pepper and some Cajun seasoning. The only other change was cutting back on the amount of liquid. I opted for 1 box of vegetable broth (32 oz) & 2 cups of water, as well as the juice from the can of tomatoes. Over all the flavor of this recipe is pretty awesome.

I made this from ingredients that I already have in my spice cupboard.  It makes around 1/2 to 2/3 cup. I did add granulated garlic. I used two tablespoons in the Red Beans and Rice recipe and the heat and salt level seems to be just right. There is some noticeable kick but not so much to be painful. I will utilize this again!  The size of the recipe is good in the aspect that you’re not stuck with a large amount of it, but there are some leftovers that can be easily stored in a spice or pint jar.

Many years ago I found a recipe for Nutty Mango Salmon that required Cajun Seasoning.   Since I had cupboards full of different spices, I wanted to use what I had on hand and have control over the ingredients in the blend I used (i.e. no preservatives).  

This recipe fit my needs and I've never wanted to try another.  I never cared if the ingredients were "authentic Cajun", my only concern was that the seasoning mix worked with the chopped pecan and coconut oil mixture I encrust the salmon with.  

Salmon tends to be bland so I wanted spices that played off the pecans, kicked up the salmon flavor and didn't clash with the mango slices that top the salmon.   This simple spice blend is ALL that.  The amount of salt didn't worry me since I only use 1/2 tsp. of the blend per 1 pound salmon.

Instead of buying pre made, make your own.  But way too much salt, I do half the salt.  These basically are the ingredients you are already using for jambalaya so just adjust the amounts.

Excellent-but as other reviewers I added onion and garlic powders. With the additions it becomes 5 star. Will make again and thanks for the recipe.

Reduced the salt to 1 tablespoon.  Otherwise, turned out great. Will definitely make again; minus the salt.

Wayyyy too much salt as another reviewer has already pointed out! I would use only a tablespoon of salt with this, and I am going to try the other suggestions which have been suggested, but so long as you cut down the salt, this is pretty perfect as-is. Edit/update: I think it was a typo and was actually supposed to be 2 1/2 TEASPOONS salt, that is normally how much I use for meat, I used a tablespoon last time for a stew/gumbo that had too much stock and needed more salt.

I hate it when others write reviews and alter the recipe, but I have to say this recipe does not need paprika or half the salt. I made it without the paprika and cut the salt down to half a teaspoon. It was fantastic. Perfect for the blackened chicken I used to top a salad. I would use it again this way.

I don't keep onion or garlic powder on hand so I use this whenever I need Cajun seasoning. I use fresh onions and garlic in most of my dishes anyway so it works for me. I've used it on ribs, pork chops, blackened fish, etc...Today I'm using it in a copycat recipe for jambalaya pasta that calls for Cajun seasoning.

This worked perfectly for me.  I never buy the spice mixes - prefer to put them together myself.  Not an expert on Cajun cooking but this worked for me for Jambalaya.

Having never made or used any type of cajun seasoning before, I was unsure of what to expect. While this was a very spicy mix, it worked well in the Jambalaya dish that I made and I have no complaints. My only recommendation would maybe be to halve the recipe. This makes A LOT - especially if you don't use this blend often.

We love this on cold peel-n-eat shrimp.  Just boil, chill quickly, and then toss with the cajun seasoning.  Put it in the refrigerator until you're ready to eat.
