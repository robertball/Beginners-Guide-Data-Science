I always thought "toss vegetables in oil, rosemary... maybe a little balsamic vinegar" and you have roasted vegetables... until I tried THIS recipe! I don't know whether it's the lemon juice, the combination of herbs or the marinating before hand, but I will NEVER make roasted vegetables any other way. You could pretty much substitute any of your favourite veggies and this dish would be a success. My husband AND kids raved about these vegetables (especially the zucchini!) Thank-you for this recipe!

We liked this recipe because it adjusts easily to your favourite veggies.  We used zuchinni, brocolli, mushrooms, red onion, red & green peppers, baby carrots, sweet potatoes and snow peas.  The stated baking time was far too long though....everything but the carrots were done in under 40 minutes.  Next time I will steam my carrots first and the roast them all for 30 minutes. I like to make a huge amount so there are leftovers.  Great in a pita or wrap for lunch or mixed with scrambled eggs.

EXCELLENT!!  I made this last minute, so I didn't have time to marinade for 2 hrs or roast x 1.5hrs.  I put the marinaded veggies (only marinaded x 1hr) in the microwave for a few minutes to soften them, then roasted x 40 min.  I also added the parmesan cheese.  It came out great - and got lots of compliments.

I reduced the cooking time for this significatly, as I tend to like my veggies less well-done.  The lemon taste didn't blend well with the other flavors, but was nicer a day later on the leftovers.  Also, the bits of bay leaf were unpleasant.  If I make this again, I will reduce the lemon and oil (too rich for my tastes) and use whole bay leaves, which will be easier to remove.  Overall, a decent dish, but not too exciting compared to simpler versions of roasted vegetable.  (side note: for measuring simplification, 8 TPSP of olive oil is a half cup)

I let the veggies, I used zucchini, eggplant, carrots, and onions marinate (added fresh garlic too) for about 2 hours before I cooked them. Also put a little grated parmesan on top. Made it for a party and everybody wants the recipe, especially after I told them it was easy to make too.

My dinner guests loved this on Christmas eve.  It was an excellent accompaniment to saffron rice and roast turkey.  The only change I will make will be to reduce the lemon.  It was a tad overbearing.  I also plan on using up my leftover fresh vegetables with this recipe.  Thanks, Joanna!

In one word delicious. Left out the eggplant and added quarters of some large mushrooms. I cut the red onions in wedges then roughly separated. Think next time I might omit the carrots. I was hoping for leftovers but there weren't any. Definitely a regular dish in our house from now on. Thanks so much.

This was amazing!  I didn't have time to let it marinade for 2 hours, just 30 minutes.  I used eggplant, squash, zuchini, green and red bell peppers, red onions, asparagus, portobello mushrooms, baby carrots and cherry tomatoes.  I doubled the marinade because I had so many vegetables and left out the lemon zest so it wouldn't be too strong of a flavor.  I baked it at 400 for 20 minutes, stirred it and put it back in for another 20.  We ate them hot because we couldn't wait, but they are better at room temperature.  Make extra- they are great the next day as a cold veggie salad, added to a sandwich or wrap (try them on thick sliced french bread with gruyere cheese or in a pita with crumbled goat cheese), or mixed with scrambled egg whites for breakfast.  Such great flavor- this is the best roasted veggie recipe I've tried yet!  Thank you for sharing!

When I make the roasted veggies, I roast them in very small diced pieces, and then add them to a basic marina sauce for an excellent smoked vegetable pasta sauce.  It's wonderful!

The eggplant picked up all the oil and was cooked way before the other veggies.  The marinade was bland.

Roasting veggies doesn't really require a recipe, once you have a sense of how to do it -- but the addition of the lemon flavor suggested here is just phenomenal! This is my favorite way to do veggies now, with plenty of fresh lemon juice, grated zest, and even the addition of lemon pepper. Using *fresh* herbs really adds to the character of the dish... and your kitchen will smell AMAZING as the mixture sits and then roasts. YUM!

Excellent basic recipe! For those who are new to roasting veggies I suggest using this recipe as a guide, not a blueprint. In other words, if you don't like eggplant, don't put it in. Don't like rosemary and thyme? Leave them out and use, perhaps, basil instead. Simply adjust the recipe to your liking!
I personally often use all the veggies stated in the recipe, but I also add broccoli and cauliflower. But I'll use whatever I have on hand that day and it always turns out great.

This is delicious and really impressive when arranged on a platter.  To use the vegetables I had on hand I included zucchini, yellow squash, mushrooms and red and yellow bell peppers. I substituted a minimal amount of fresh herbs for the dried. Simple preparation - except for an occasional stir, once it's in the oven you can pretty much just forget it while you tend to other things. How easy and gorgeous would this be for your backyard cook-out?

I agree with other reviewers. Great recipe, just makes sure and  use veggies that your family likes, and cook to firmness you like. Next time I will nuke the carrots a little first. They were cooked, but could have cooked a little longer. I also agree with reviewer who said they would not crush the bay leaves. Flavor is good, but you end up having to sort them out. Very yummy, easy and nutritious! We will put it in the rotation! For guests, too.

This is also a good made in the oven.  Just toss the veggies with a little olive oil and roast them.  For a great sandwich spread, pulse the vegetables with 8 oz. cream cheese until creamy.  YUM!

Very nice recipe. I like how the veggies are seasoned but you can still very much taste the veggies' natural flavor. I made this tonight for dinner guests who also liked it quite a lot. A note though...if you make the amount of veggies the recipe calls for you will have WAY more than 4 servings. I did about a third of the recipe and it fed the 4 of us nicely.

I always follow the recipe to a tee finding it crazy when I read a review that says it's a 5 star recipe but I added or I subtracted.  Hello rate THIS recipe not yours.     OK this one was pretty average.   my opinion was that there were too many dried spices. The flavor wasn't too strong because of it, but I felt lesser and fresher herbs might have been better.  LOVE ALLRECIPES.com and I use it all the time.  Thanks.

I made these for a party because I am on Weight Watchers and wanted to have something low points yet good to eat and it went over great. Everyone ate it all and now it is requested from me at all of the parties that I go to!

My family loves when I roast the veggies from our garden. I just toss them in olive oil and season well. When they are done, we roll them up in a tortilla, add cheese and salsa and enjoy.

After reading some of the reviews, made a few minor changes.  1) Used less olive oil to reduce fat, 2) omitted the rosemary but added some dried basil, 3) cooked for less time than indicated because I wanted a little firmness, and 4) used less lemon juice and zest.  These turned out great; added some parma cheese and served over whole wheat linguine for a very healthy pasta dish.  (I used all organic veggies).  Added to a homemade marina sauce and you'd have an awesome dish!  Thanks for the great recipe!

Marinating the vegetables was the big difference in the great flavor in this recipe. Overnight was perfect, and guests raved about these Roasted Vegetables at Christmas Dinner. I wouldn't change a thing....another great keeper from a great site.....Thanks to the submitter.

These were really yummy.  I used zucchini, cauliflower, baby carrots, and diced russett potatoes.  I roasted the veggies in a shallow pan at 400 for 40 minutes.  I then gave them a quick blast under the broiler for 2 minutes each side to give them some nice color.  We'll definitely be making this one again.

Gave it four stars  because I made a couple of adjustments. Instead of lemon juice I used balsamic vinegar and I skipped the crushed bay leaves. This turned out very well and even my DH, who isn't fond of this kind of dish, tried and really enjoyed it. I put it under the broiler for a few minutes to crisp up the veggies a bit. It is a forgiving recipe as you can use whatever vegetable you like/have on hand.

This roasted vegetables recipe is the best I have ever used. The vegetables absorb the flavors of all and leave a nice aftertaste in your mouth. Be sure to allow plenty of time for cooking and stirring as it takes over an hour for the process but, IT IS WORTH IT!!

I might have had too high of an expectation from reading some of the reviews ... or maybe this dish just isn't for me. This isn't a dish I will set out to make again - it takes too much time for a mediocre result. I do enjoy roasted veggies and I'm glad I tried this recipe out. It seems some people on here really enjoyed it, but for me it was just an okay side dish.

We love these veggies! I do, however, omit the eggplant. I don't care for its texture with the other vegetables.; other than that, super recipe! I've never served it to anyone who didn't thoroughly enjoy it.

I cook veggies all the time but the combination of these veggies was an odd flavor.  I didn't care for the added eggplant & onions.  Next time I will only add summer veggies.  They were good but not my favorite.

This is written for people who already know how to roast vegetables.  The directions:  "In a large roasting pan, roast the vegetables..."  If I knew how to do that I would not need a recipe.  It is a continuing discussion between friends whether roasted vegies are baked or broiled & if baked at what temperature. This certainly does not answer that question.  I would have loved to have written JRCROSBY31 directly but was not sure how to do that.

I make roasted vegetables often and use different veggies--sometimes just toss in commercial Italian dressing. I always pre-cook in the microwave: carrots, potatoes, sweet potatoes, and any others that take longer. Serve with lots of parmesan on top. Always get compliments.

Delicious. Used my own combination of veggies and put them in the refrigerator for about 8 hours, then roasted them for 45 minutes. Everyone loved them.

I loved this!  Like others, I found that it cooked up much more quickly than the recipe describes.  In fact, I thought it was perfect after the first 20 minutes.  Although this could be at least in part due to the fact that I made about a 1/4-1/3 portion.  I didn't have eggplant, but I added broccoli.  I used chopped roma tomatoes in place of cherry tomatoes, but I think the cherry tomatoes would be wonderful.  Can't wait to make it again!

This was super good, though the cooking time was a bit too long for us.  Next time I will reduce the cooking time a bit.  Loved the rosemary in it.  Watch out for those cherry tomatoes...they're hot and can explode...ouch.  Thanks for the recipe :)

Made this recipe for Christmas dinner. Actually, did not have enough time to prepare overnight. I  love fresh herbs and used fresh thyme and rosemary; only had dried oregano. The dish was fantastic! Everyone loved it and I'll surely make it again. A bit time intensive with all the chopping and such, but definitely worth the effort. Next time I will use the full amount of vegetables. Excellent!

Made this recipe for guests Saturday, and they enjoyed it.  I didn't use nearly as many vegetables as the recipe called for, and it more than fed my six friends.  The flavor was terrific, but I found the veggies created quite a bit of fluid as they roasted, and this led to some mush.  I might drain them halfway through next time.

This is a fantastic recipe! I made this after I came back from a trip and found that my vegetables needed to be used fast. So I threw what I could salvage into this recipe and made a giant pan of it. It lasted for days, and reheats well. The only thing I didn't like was the bay leaves - the little bits were annoying, and I don't know if bay leaves add much to this dish anyway. So next time I'm going to leave them out. I've been eating the roasted vegetables in place of rice and as a snack. I just finished the last of it and now I'm sad it's all gone :( Will definitely make again!

This was my first time making roasted veggies in oven and this is a great beginner's recipe! I omitted the eggplant as no one in my home likes it and I used grape seed oil instead of olive oil. Very good and will make many times! The reason for the 4 instead of 5 is the cooking time is off- I did the first 20 min at 400 as written, stirred and turned down to 200 and did 7 more minutes. Next time I will cook for a shorter amount of time.

My husband and I use recipes from here all the time. This is the first one that's been so good I had to write a review. I chose this recipe specifically for the seasonings and actual roasting guidelines, having never roasted vegetables before.  I used different veggies than those listed in the recipe (again I was going for the seasoning aspect). I followed the seasonings to a "T" except we were out of lemons so I used limes. WOW!!!!! We made (3) gallon sized zip-loc bags full (which ended up taking (3) large cookie sheets to get them all cooked). There were only 4 adults eating the dinner and there was only a 1/2 c. of veggies left. Outstanding! I didn't add the lime zest, just the lime juice. And I was worried after the fact b/c another reviewer said the bay leaves didn't add anything and should have been left whole for easier removal. I must have crushed mine up small enough b/c there were no complaints. These were so good I've been asked to make them for Thanksgiving dinner!!!! This is definitely a new family fave. I can't decide whether to try it again w/ the lemon juice or just stick w/ the lime b/c it was so delicious!!!

I've made this a couple of times now.  I've tried to shorten the cooking time but if I follow the instructions, it turns out great.  I served it last night to house guests and they all loved it and asked for the recipe.  It's a good way to use up left over veggies.

Ya, I agree with all of the great reviews!  I've made so-so roasted veggies, but these are outstanding!  It's funny cause you don't really taste the lemon or any particular herb, just sweet roasty deliciousness!  I just used peppers, garlic,onion, tomatoes, and some mushrooms and shallot.

Wow, did I feel healthy after preparing this and making it and eating it!!!  It turned out superb even though I accidentally doubled the lemon juice.  I didn't even taste the lemon.  My company thought it was great too!  The tomatoes were my favorite part.

This is a great way to merinate and serve fresh summer veggies.  This makes a lot more than 4 servings as shown - for me it was more like twenty servings.  I used exactly the amount of vegetables called for, but doubled the merinade because there was so much.  Cooked them in a Smoker Bag in the oven rather than on the grill, and everything came out perfectly.  Will make this again.

Yummy!  I used zucchini and carrots.  Very lovely flavours; the lemon really intensifies the sweetness of the carrots.  Will definitely make again and again, and will try a variety of vegetables.

Nice blend of flavors.  Added mushrooms and a splash of balsamic vinegar.  The nice thing about this recipe is you can put in all your favorite veggies.  My husband added leftovers into our eggs this morning--yummy!!!!

Tasty seasoning. Left out the eggplant, used yellow, not red onion , and lightly brushed veggies with olive oil after first 20 min. (I forgot to add it to the bag)

Very easy to make!  I let vegies marinate overnight, wonderful flavors.  I used fresh herbs and added minced and whole garlic.  I also added some small potatoes.  Was a big hit for my dinner party!

Wonderful roasted vegetables.  My husband doesn't eat eggplant, so I eliminated that and sprinkled vegs with grated parmesan cheese right out of the oven. Will make this many times again.

I made this to be a side dish with some mini tacos, so, instead of rosemary, etc., I used cumin, chili powder, and red pepper.  It turned out very well and I will use this combination of veggies and this cooking method again in the future.

Used left over veggies from Christmas. I cut the recipe down to serve 4. Also added mushrooms & a touch of red wine. Left out the tomatoes. Very tasty . Will definitely use recipe again.

This is great!  A lot of cutting!  And a huge giant pan is needed. I divided it up and put on three cookie pans.   The zucchini was pretty mushy. I followed the directions, but I added an additional 20 minutes with the oven on 400. It actually crisped up the onions and dried out the zucchini. We are more a fan of the crispy. I brought these to a party and served at room temperature and sprinkled with Parmesan cheese.

I'm sorry, but yuck! I was surprised how bad this tasted after all the great reviews. It was the only "disliked" dish at my Thanksgiving dinner. None of my family liked it. The lemon, or something, just made it sour and gross. I'd prefer them raw over this recipe, and I don't like raw vegetables! Thanks for sharing.

I made this recipe with the vegetables I had on hand - squash, zucchini, tomato, eggplant, red, orange, yellow, green peppers.  The spices I did not change.  I thought it was alright but my husband did not like it at all.  He did not think the lemon flavor paired well with the Italian seasonings.

So good! I always used to use balsamic vinegar, but the lemon juice and zest really make this vibrant. I follow the dressing recipe exactly, but change up the  vegetables .  This is also a great way to use up veggies that  are maybe a little past fresh.

Made as described in original description.  It's fairly time consuming and takes a long time to cook if you really want softer veggies.  Flavor-wise it was good but not exceptional.

I changed this recipe based on what I had in my refrigerator.  I used broccoli, cauliflower, carrots,  and squash.  I left out the garlic and took it to a church luncheon. . I returned with an empty pan.  It was easy and a big hit.  Took less time than in the original recipe but I just kept checking the tenderness of the vegetables.  I will definitely be using this recipe again.

I omitted eggplant, substituted summer squash for zucchini and added quartered baby bella mushrooms. The balance of ingredients went unchanged, to my regret.  The herbs were overpowering and masked the flavor of the vegetables. I will use a different recipe next time.  I gave this recipe an additional star, having made considerable changes to the vegetables.

A great recipe. The combination of seasoning and marinating takes it over the top.   I will do our roast veggies this way from now on.

This is probably my favorite roasted veg I've made. I think the lemon zest and the seasonings are key. Everything single thing in this blend came out of our garden outside of the oil and dry seasonings.

I found this just OK.  It was a great use of a lot of vegetables.  I think the flavors just aren't my personal taste, so I do think others should try it.  But I won't make it again.

It was simple.  I prepared the veggies the night before our gathering along with garlic and fresh rosemary.  The following day I added the oil and roasted the veggies.  It was a hit with everyone......including the teens.

I have made these vegetables many times, always with some variations based on my ingredients, and every time it's been amazing. I grill the vegetable on the bbq instead of the oven and I never use the egg plant (because no one in my family likes egg plant). Delicious veggies every time!

Fantastic!  Making for the 2nd time.  Used whatever veggies I have in the fridge.  Eggplant is great if you have it.  Did add the Parmesan cheese on top.  Doubled the marinade the first time.  Didn't have as many veggies this time so followed measurements.
7/2016:  made 3rd time. My favorite and so easy.  I did add 2T balsamic vinegar, left out lemon juice...loved loved!

This recipe was just OK. I followed the recipe exactly the same. First, it is not a very easy recipe (too many ingredients and takes too much time). Second, you should choose veggies with similar cooking time (I had to remove all the carrots and cook them extra in microwave. I made it a day before the party. That was a good move. It saved me time and effort. The flavor was good. I also removed the bay leaves after the veggies were cooked. Next time I will make 1/2 amount and cook carrots a little ahead of the time.

The serving size on this recipe is extremely generous.  One "serving" was enough to feed my family of 4 as a side dish at dinner.  This is a delicious recipe, and one I will certainly make again.

I had some eggplant that needed to be cooked, so I tried this.  It may just be that I dont care much for eggplant (despite having it appear in the house occasonally), but I was a little disappointed at the taste of the whole thing after all the work of chopping all the veggies.  I'm sure those who like all of the individual veggies will probably appreciate this more then we did though.

Very good but not as flavorful as I would have liked. Although the recipe calls for dried herbs, next time I will use fresh.

Wonderful recipe any time grilling the veggies is not convenient.  I used fresh herbs from the garden the second time I made it.  Even more scrumptious.

Very good.  Marinated 2 hours.  Added some sesame oil too.  Did not use eggplant and zucchini...added parnips chopped.  Good leftover too!.
