it really turned out good! the squash thickened the soup, so it was very hearty and it made a full crockpot! i would put less oil/butter at the beginning (i skimmed some off at the end), i added the whole package of spinach, and i sprinkled parmesan cheese on my soup once i had served it. overall, really good!
