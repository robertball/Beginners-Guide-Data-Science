This was delicious. I did shred a rotisserie chicken and added it to the mixture  as well as used a whole packet of fajita seasoning.  I was also out of cumin  so I subbed coriander. Thanks for the great healthy recipe, I will definitely make it again.

This was the most flavorful clean dish I've made so far. Followed everything pretty close but could not find Cojita cheese so I used Feta and I'm glad I did. I think the Feta gave it a flavor kick. Not a pumpkin seed kinda guy so none of those and didn't have cumin shockingly, so none of that either. Added chicken breast chunks I seared first and then baked along w other. Delicious and better the next day.

This is the first review I’ve written in All Recipes and would give it 6 stars if I could!  This dish was amazing is so many ways.  The flavors were a perfect blend of the ingredients and seasoning.  We followed the receipt with the exception of the cheese.  On the recommendation of the cheese lady our local grocery store (Thank You Piazzas!), we used Queso Fresco because it’s less salty.  Also, in place of the Fajita seasons, we used the same quantity of McComicks Fajita seasoning mix from an envelope.  We can’t wait to try it again on guests.

Very interesting recipe. I used my food processor to chop/slice the vegetables. I doubled the recipe and used four pounds of cauliflower. The cauliflower and the rest of the vegetables requires a very large bowl to mix everything. I used a 12 quart pot for pasta to do this and everything occupied half the pot. Baking reduces the bulk of the vegetables substantially. 
Only changes I made to the recipe was to use 2 red peppers rather than one and increase the beans to two can.  I baked the beans separately from the rest of the vegetables for the last 15 minutes of cooking. I will definitely make this again.

This was a big hit! Making the riced cauliflower was so easy and it fooled everyone in the family! This recipe made just enough for our family of 4... no left overs. I will double the recipe next time.

I used 2 cans of pinto beans so it would have extra protein for a main dish. I also used crumbled goat cheese because that was easy for me to find. I just heated leftovers in avocado halves sprinkled with a little more cheese. Yummy!

SO good! Replaced the cheese w feta and scallions with avocado. Really enjoyed the layers of texture and flavors in this dish. Meat would be a totally unnecessary addition.

Delicious.   I added 1/4 cup of shredded Mexican blend cheese to the mix for the 2nd 15 minutes in the oven, and topped bowls with salsa and sour cream.  I will definitely make this again!

This was ok. Outside of a filling vegetarian meal it’s nothing to write home about. Everyone said they liked it but it’s been two days later and no one has helped themselves to the leftovers in the refrigerator.  I riced the cauliflower myself-1large head is about the amount the recipe calls for. I used black beans because that’s what I had on hand. I also realized when I got home from grocery store I had grabbed taco seasoning instead of fajita. I also used the whole pack per others’ recommendations. It’s not a bad recipe  and it is flavorful and filling; it just didn’t have that umph we were looking for.

I made only half and used the  frozen  riced cauliflower . I used the whole pkg of fajita spice.
You will never know it doesn’t have meat in it.
5 stars! We are making it again this week!!

So tasty! I added mushrooms and cooked the beans in with the rest. Also, toasted the pepitas. Even my carnivore husband said it was so good that it didn't need meat! Thanks for sharing this delicious recipe!

This was so good! I had to sub the cheese and beans but it was still good. It was very filling for not having any meat. My family really liked it also. I will make this again for sure.

This was really, really good!!  It took a little bit longer to prepare than my regular weeknight meals but it was worth it.  If you make it on a weeknight, make sure it's a night that you're not running kids around and on a schedule.  Ok, with that out of the  way,  the only thing that I didn't have was the cojita cheese. I'm not sure if it would have made a big difference, I used Trader Joe's Raw Milk Cheddar cheese, shredded of course.  Also,  we added tomatoes as a topping but not green onion because I forgot to buy it.  Really, really good.

This was fabulous! Kids loved it. I added some red cabbage, substituted coconut oil. Also we didn't have pumpkin seeds and substituted chopped almonds. We will make this again and not change a thing!

just made this and loved it! I like to make recipe as close as possible the first time. But I didn't have fajita seasoning and didn't want to buy it when the spice rack has everything. And I had some Spanish rice that I put on the bottom of the bowl with the beans and then the rest on top. Oh and of course avocado. Thanks!

Super great dish. The only things I did differently were to double the seasonings, plus instead of fajita seasoning, I used Mexican seasoning (from a market); used mimolette as I live in France and we have the French cheeses near where I live; and I left off the fresh coriander as I was out of it (sadly). Delicious vegetarian dish!! Thanks!!

This is a great recipe. The base of roasted cauliflower rice, peppers & onion is delicious - I am thinking of a bunch of ways just to use the base of this dish! I combined  1 can of chili hot beans and 1 can of black beans in a saucepan and heated until bubbly. I  spooned the beans over the roasted veggies and  then added shredded cheddar cheese. Topped it off with a little salsa, cilantro and a sliced avocado. Very easy & I will be making it again & again!

I like this a lot. It is a great side dish. Also works well as a main dish if you want to add meat. Has a lot of flavor. I had an avocado so I add it as well. I can see myself making it with black beans and corn. This dish is very versatile

My whole family loves this! I used 1 head of cauliflower, chopped fine in my food processor and about a pound of cooked Basmati rice. I added a tad more EVOO. I recommend using more bell pepper...it’s delicious in here. I used feta cheese rather than suggested cheese. I definitely recommend using the pepitas! They add a nice little crunch. We forgot to top our bowls with picco de gallo, guacamole and sour cream...but it was still wonderful! I’m excited to have it again with those last 3 toppings! :) Overall, fast, easy, healthy and filling...not to mention yummy!!

I have made this dish twice now and love it. I make it into 4 bowls and use them throughout a busy week for a quick grab lunch or dinner.  Saves me from some poor last minute choices.

Perfect, the flavors were amazing. I added some shredded carrots only because I had them, and did top with rotisserie chicken (But not necessary). Would be awesome with shrimp, or any meat actually. Will make this again (and again)!

We all really enjoyed this and I will definitely be making it again! I made a few minor changes: decreased oil and salt, and added halved cherry tomatoes to the cilantro, fresh onion, lime juice, and pepitas. I made fajita seasoning  following the recipe on this site. I had some leftover quinoa, so I put that in with the beans. Also, since we don't eat cheese, I made a vegan cheese sauce to top this with. Sooo flavorful! Love that we are sneaking in more veggies without feeling like we're missing out on old favorites. Thanks so much for sharing this recipe!

This was outrageous!  We loved it!  I had half of an orange pepper I needed to use, so I added that in addition to the red pepper.  Awesome!  One of the best and easiest healthy entrees ever!

The only change I made was using fresh parsley instead on cilantro as it was what I had on hand.  This is fantastic!  Definitely will make it again.

I've made this several times.  Today, I made strips of 6 B/L chicken thighs and added an envelope of fajita seasoning mix when they were no longer pink.  Put baked veggies into 2 casserole dishes and topped with beans,  the cheese, and the chicken strips, and baked another 15 minutes.

This was easy to make (yes, prep does take a little,time) & delicious. I used riced broccoli instead of cauliflower, added corn & chicken. I cooked for 10 minutes then stirred and cooked for another 10 minutes; I accidentally added the beans to the mixture so that cooked as well. I added guacamole and sour cream to the toppings. I had a little leftover rice so used 1/4-cup to my serving. Now I have some easily .

This was too salty as written; the added salt is not needed.  The recipe tasted okay but was unmemorable and had some ingredients that were a bit expensive, so not worth making it again.

Added mushrooms for flavour, cooked for 45 minutes for a crispier texture,  and added the beans to the pan for the last 10 minutes of cooking time.

Made as directed except that I used home cooked and seasoned pinto beans.  I would have given only three stars as I felt the dish was average (without all the toppings) but I think it has potential.  Will use two red peppers next time and cut them in chunks, also maybe a poblano pepper. Pepitas were a nice, crunchy touch.   Will try the full packet of fajita seasoning.  And maybe next time I'll top it with pico de gallo and guac.

Made this as written & it was good.   I also added chopped grape tomatoes with chopped red onions & cilantro seasoned with cumin, lime & salt/pepper  as well as sliced avocado & roasted corn which added more color.   Added blacked chicken tenders for the hubby who likes the extra spice & protein.    Next time I will double the fajita seasoning &  make Cuban black beans instead of pinto beans.  I think this will add more flavor .

I had trouble with this recipe. First, I got two cauliflowers rather than 2 pounds of cauliflower called for by the recipe. When I realized that, I tried to eyeball and estimate the right amount of cauliflower but it was hard. I made a lot of cauliflower rice, but it seemed too much, so I kept taking out handfuls. The amount I ended with may have been too little.

The other thing is this recipe depends heavily on the fajita powder that you get. I got a very spicy Mexican Fajita powder and it was too much. Somehow the dish also was much too salty, I like a lot of salt in my food, but it was too much for me! I want to try the dish again, not making the mistakes I made this time, and using Old ElPaso Fajita powder, which may be a bit milder. I love cauliflower and am not particular how it is cooked, so I keep looking for cauliflower recipes.

It turned out good even if the cauliflowers were just chopped and not riced. What makes it good also is the lime juice! Don't forget to put it on! My husband liked it a lot. I added some roasted chicken to it. Will make it again!

I really like this recipe! I stopped eating meat and have been looking for recipes. This will be one that stays in my rotation. I did eyeball my seasonings, so I believe I added more than the recipe called for.

This turned out so well. Not only is it delicious, but it’s filling. I used feta cheese because I couldn’t find cojita. I also tried it with goat cheese crumbles for the same reason. Both batches were excellent. Great meatless dinner.

OMG! We loved this.  Used Feta because Hubby can't eat the cheese listed due to dietary restrictions.  Left everything else the same.  We will be making this again.  It is very time consuming, so I did prep for it through out the day.  I made the veggy mix, and covered it with plastic, so I could pop it in the oven when ready.  I don't think I would change anything except maybe cut back on the oil a bit because of our diet restrictions.  Great recipe!

Good stuff. Family loved it. I changed it up and didn’t do the bowls. We actually put them in fajita shells. Fed us all to fill and had tons of left overs.

Definitely adding this to my list of low-calorie lunch meal prep! Delicious flavor. I could hardly tell that it was riced cauliflower instead of rice.
I did not include the pumpkin seeds or cheese, and instead added some chicken breast, an additional can of beans, and an additional bell pepper. Also topped with chopped romaine lettuce for some additional crunch.

I thought this was wonderful. The only changes I made were to omit pumpkin seeds because I did not have any and I used feta cheese instead of cotija cheese. I also used two cans of beans to  add some extra protein. I used pinto and black beans, plus I sprinkled some fajita seasoning on those before warming  them in the  oven. I will definitely be making this again.

What a wonderful recipe!  Full of flavor and very tasty.  I made charro beans which my husband loves and used them in place of the can.  I was going to use chicken as others did, but totally forgot about it until it was way too late in the recipe!  I had frozen sausage already cooked for lasagna, took that out, sliced up some leftover kielbasa from Costco and mixed them in.  Definitely a keeper.  Thank you, Julie!
