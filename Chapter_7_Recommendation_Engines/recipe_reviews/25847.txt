This Is Great.....I used Folgers CAFE LATTE, MOCHA FUSION instant mix which also comes in a few different flavors such as Vanilla, Mocha Almond, Caramel and a couple of others. I also cut the sugar down just a bit. This is a great summer drink for those who like "Foo-Foo" coffee's or iced coffee drinks. This has become a regular for my wife and I.

This is so delicious.  I have experimented with different flavors of instant coffee to get a recipe that tastes the most like Starbuck's Frappaccino.  I use half Folgers Mocha Fusion and half Folgers Straight Up Latte.  I found that that combo has the best coffee to mocha ratio.

This was just outstanding. I took another reviewers advice and cut the vanilla to 1/2 teaspoon. I also cut the sugar to two tablespoons. I used International Coffee's Hazelnut Belgian flavor and also added one tablespoon of chocolate syrup and one tablespoon instant coffee. Delicious! Thanks for this recipe!

I reviewed this the first time and I believe that I might have been a little harsh. I mean, I love coffee. I think I just tried to make this too low-fat last time and it just tasted like a**.

I made this again today with the Gunline Coffee mix that I had on hand and didn't try to make it lowfat. Way better the second time. Kind of like those blended coffee drinks that I used to buy at 7-11 back in the day.

My apologies. Way better the second time.

This is really a simple recipe. But oh so yummy! For a more chocolaty taste I used unsweetened cocoa, cinnamon and sugar. Really good on hot days!

This rivals Starbucks-and lends itself to all sorts of flavor combinations. My favorite is to use 2 Tbs. mocha flavored coffee powder and then for the last 1 Tbs. use a high quality ground chocolate powder (like Ghirardelli's). Thank you Nick for sharing such a delicious recipe with us.

Well, who needs Starbucks anymore???  This was terrific Nick.  I'm a coffeeholic and absolutely love it hot or cold.  This was quick and delicious but best of all, I can whip this up at home anytime.  I used instant vanilla flavored coffee and soy milk.  Instead of the full amount of sugar called for, I used some chocolate powdered drink mix.  This will definitely be a repeat.  Thanks for sharing.

That was delicious! I look forward to making these all throughout summer. 
I used Nescafe Frothe 'Divinely Mocha' mix, basically cause it was all I had. It was too sweet, it may be because of the combination of the sugar and mocha mix, but needless to say next time I will cut back on the sugar.
I used almond milk instead of normal milk and I think that made it even better! yum.

Perfect the way it is!!  I have been looking for a recipe without ice cream and this one is wonderful.  I used soy milk for a non-dairy drink and you can't tell the difference.  Tim Horton's Iced Cappucino doesn't stand a chance against the "Fusion Shake".  Thanks.. from Leduc, Alberta!

This is a quick and easy iced coffee drink.  It is much cheaper than going to a coffee place and I don't have to leave my home. I followed other reviewer's suggestions and used only 2 T. of sugar and 1/2 t of vanilla.

For the reviewer who didn't know what to use for the instant mocha part of the recipe-Any International Coffee flavor works very well.  I use French Vanilla-3 Tb. to 2 Tb of sugar.  This is a wonderfully refreshing drink-and can be tailored to anyone's taste.

This is a very good imitation of the frappucino from Starbuck's; however, adding one teaspoon of vanilla made it a little too strong, and overpowered the mocha flavor.  I would add just half of a teaspoon, or omit it altogether.  Also, for the reviewer who asked what kind of mocha mix to use--I used Frappe Freeze from Trader Joe's.

Awesome drink!  It was a hot day today, and i couldn't make it out to Starbucks for a frappuccino...this did the trick!  It had just the right amount of sugar so that it still had a great coffee taste!!  Loved it and will definitely be making this one again!

I used Folgers Cappuccino Mocha Chocolate. It was incredible. I'll never spend $5 for another Mocha Frappaccino again!

This combo is awesome! Extremely comparable to a certain coffee/doughnut chain's "Mocha Coolata". I didn't have any mocha flavored instant coffee so i used regular instant and just added a few (ahem) HEALTHY amounts of chocolate syrup. Turned out GREAT! My husband and i have enjoyed it the past 2 nights :) Yummmm....

Delicious!! A nice cool shake with a creamy head for coffee lovers in the summer time! I love strong coffee and just used instant coffee so it was an intense flavor. I'll make this all the time now!

Wow that was good.  I am from Canada and for us we compare it to a Tim Horton's Ice Capachino. My wife and I both feel this was quite a bit better.  I am thinking of trying this with a little Kahlua or Baileys sometime.

Very refreshing. Thick, creamy and very mocha-y! I used a little agave syrup for the sugar. I think this would be best unsweetened, but that is simply personal preference. This would also be really good with any other flavored coffee mix.

What a great treat to make with items that you already have at home.  I loved this recipe and my hubby and I enjoy it on hot summer nights when we want a taste of coffee, but also want to be refreshed.  Great for those not wanting to make a cold coffee drink with ice cream (calories).

I liked this becuase it was really smooth. There were no ice chunks. I think it is better than going out to get one. It is also less expensive.

Excellent and so quick to make.  I added a tsp of instant coffee granules to make it a little more coffee flavored.  Has anyone made with skim milk?

I LOVE THIS SHAKE!! I made the recipe exactly as written, but i topped it off with a squirt of whipped cream...delicious!!! I will definitely be adding this recipe to my regulars and making it often...thank you so much EUC!!!

Delicious!  I didn't have mocha coffee mix, so I used instant coffee, cocoa and a little extra sugar. Definitely hit the spot on a hot day.

Very good...It does come out to be a shake and not a slushy type drink.  I used international frech vanilla, one packet of splenda and a little vanilla extract. I think next time I will add some cocoa powder. Thanks!

Wow, this was good! It seemed so simple I was skeptical! I used 6 ice cubes (that come out of the trays) since my refrigerator doesn't dispense ice. I used my personal dark cocoa mix as the stand in for the mocha mix. Very yummy and refreshing a hot day!

This drink is so tasty, I will never buy a McD's caramel frappe again! LOL! I used the Maxwell House InternationAL Cafe Mocha mix. I listened to the other reviewers and used only 1/2 tsp of vanilla extract. The best drink I ever tasted.

I just made this and it was yummy. I used Instant French Vanilla coffee, fat free half and half, little bit of chocolate syrup and five ice cubes. Left out the sugar and the vanilla. Added whipped topping and a drizzle of syrup. Better than ones bought out in my opinon. Thanks for the recipe.

MMMMM!!!!! This was wonderful!  I think next time I might freeze the milk into cubes before hand to make it a little thicker.  It was awesome though, thanks!

Made for hubby (I can't have...pregnancy)who really likes his iced coffee.  He loved this.  I did add double vanilla (he likes it that way), and a bit more sugar than it called for.  I will definatly be trying this out....when this baby arrives and I can have my caffine again.  Thanks for the post.

Probably more like 4 stars but this is the best at home frozen coffee drink I have found and I have been searching a long time!  I think I will try it with some coffee ice cubes in place of plain ice cubes to give it more of a coffee taste.

This drink is scrumptious!  Very refreshing...I wasn't sure if it would be OK made with skim milk, but it was great. I cut back to 2 T. sugar and I couldn't even tell the difference. There's only one problem...as someone else said earlier, it's ADDICTIVE!!

I would give this 10 stars if I could! This is my favorite thing I have tried from allrecipes to date. I like this better than $tarbucks and it is SO much cheaper! (and I used to work there, so this means a lot!)

This is similar to a recipe I've had for a couple years now. I've found that it tastes best if you use vanilla soy milk for more flavor and french vanilla CREAMER instead of sugar, unless of course your instant coffee is unsweetened, in which case you would need extra sugar. Doing this with the chocolate as some people have done is good. You could also add cookies (Like oreos) to make a coffee, cookies and cream shake. Or you could add ice cream!

WONDERFUL! Add some cinnamon, and use powdered sugar instead of crystals. Top with whipped cream and powdered cinnamon. (Let your glass get frosty in the freezer for 1/2 hour prior to making it) Delicious. Satisfies my starbucks cravings.

This was just okay ... I was really expecting so much more after reading the reviews. If you like a drink with an icy texture, then you'll probably like this. I used the Hazelnut Belgian and added a bit of chocolate syrup. I'll keep looking for a great made-at-home coffee drink recipe.

This was delicious!  I didn't have the mocha mix, so I used Folgers instant decaf and 2 or 3 tablespoons of unsweetened cocoa.  This deserves more than 5 stars!

This was GREAT!!!  I did what several had suggested and used 1/2 tsp vanilla and 2T sugar.  I used 3T of Nescafe's Iced Java syrup (it's fat free!) instead of a powder. I also used fat free milk so the drink was completely fat free and it tasted just like a Frappacino.  I used 1 1/2 cups of ice to make it a little thicker.  And as one person said, this is an addicting drink!

It was very good! The best mocha shake ever! It taste like ice cream but didn't even have any in it. The only thing is I would put 1 tablespoon of instant coffee. 3 is too strong for me.

Excellent! This will save me a ton of money and trips to Starbucks for a Frappuccino. I cut back on sugar and vanilla as advised and used Nestle's Frothe Caramel. Also, had some espresso leftover from the morning cappuchino (about 1 oz.) Absolutely fabulous!!!

This shake is excellent, very comparable to a Starbucks frap. I did not have any mocha instant coffee, so I used Maxwell House vanilla caramel latte instant mix. I also reduced the sugar to 2T (since my latte mix already contained sugar), and I probably would have liked it even more 1T. For a better (less icy) consistency, start with crushed ice as the recipe states. If using ice cubes, they tend to blend in larger chunks & make the drink less smooth.

Four stars only because I changed the recipe and I think it would have been so much better if I didn't. I thought it would be okay to use regular coffee mix rather than mocha. Wrong! It was bad, next time I'll stick to the directions.

Decent.  Only thing I didn't like is that the ice doesn't combine well with the rest and you end up sucking all the "juice" out and have to stir it constantly-----good flavor though.

excellent, but i found that the coffee is too strong, as i add only a little of sugar. Personal advice, less coffee and sugar. you can add more sugar later on.

I LOVED this shake!!! As soon as I finished it,I went and immediately made seconds. It's that unbelievably good!I'd give it Ten stars if I could. It really does taste like a Starbucks drink. I followed every one's advice and only added 2 TBLSP of sugar, I used International Coffee's Mocha flavor and I added 1/4 cup of Toll House Mini Chocolate Chips ( I'm sure you could add Mint chips as well, but I used regular mini chocolate chips. ). The Mini Chips blend up very well so you can still drink through a straw with out any  big chunks. I love the double chocolate taste. I'm recommending to family and friends. Save your money, this recipe is much better.

This was great, I used soymilk and per other reviews cut down on the sugar. For a variation I threw in a banana.

I used decaf instant coffee and non-fat milk.  I think it was much too strong.  As some of the others mentioned I think if you use only 1 TBSP instead of 3, it will turn out much better.  Thanks for sharing :)

I did not care for this recipe. It was way to sweet and I added less then the recipe asked for. Just tastes like cold coffee and milk.

This was yummy. It had a nice creamy texture. For the mocha coffee mix, I mixed together instant coffee with chocolate carnation sugar-free breakfast mix. For the sugar I used 2 packets of Truvia and I also used reduced fat milk to lighten it up. ty

Both the boyfriend and I LOVED this. Like someone else mentioned, I cut down sugar to 2 tablespoons and cut the vanilla to 3/4 teaspoons. He asked me to make this every day haha. I also used 1% milk on mine and 2% on his -- couldn't really tell the difference

This is excellent! You can have the equivalent of DQ Shake and even make it low fat! Just use skim milk and sugar substitute instead of real sugar, and you will cut out a ton of calories and all the fat! I used instant cappuccino mix instead of mocha- terrific!

I love this recipe.I usedit more as a basis because I kind of perfure to just guess rather than actually measurewhen it comes to drinks. I added a bit of vanilla ice cream. It was better than starbucks and I will definatly be making again.

Amazing! It was a little too sweet the first time I made it, but over time I have gotten the recipe down to just the way I like it. This recipe never fails. I use Cappuccino mix and low-fat milk, sometimes it is nice with a bit of whipped cream.  :)

Excellent with a few minor changes.  I eliminated the vanilla extract and the sugan; added a generous squeeze of chocolate syrup and used 5 large ice cubes as I didn't have crushed ice.  I also used 3 heaping Tablespoons of the Caffe D'Vita Mocha mix from Costco. Very good.

Mmmmm.  Wow, that was really delicious.  I found it sweeter then I like so next time I'll lessen the sugar.  I also used a french vanilla instant coffee and some chocolate syrup and it tasted fine.  Goes great with a cute litte umbrella straw!

Good but not great ... I had high hopes after reading the reviews but end result didn't live up to the hype :-(.  Followed recipe exactly as written ~ had nice coffee-shop flavor but texture was icy, rather than smooth or shake/smoothie-like.  I only drank about half.  I made it again tonight to experiment ~ tried eggnog, cocoa, rum extract, ice, sugar & a bit of nutmeg ~ again, very good taste but the texture was too icy for me.  Off to find another coffee drink to try ...

I eyeballed the amounts and omitted the vanilla and sugar. Then I added about 3-4 shots of E&J cream liquor. I also used instant cappucino mix. Delicious!

This drink is nuttin but good!  I used mocha cappucino and added some instant coffee and I can't wait to try other variations of the recipe.  I thought that a touch of Bailey's might be a nice touch when relaxing in the evening.  Thanks for sharing this, I will be making this often!

Totally awesome!!! My husband, who never drinks coffee, flipped out and kept saying how great this drink was.  Takes just like Starbucks.  I followed the recipe exactly, but used International Coffee's Hazelnut Belgian Cafe.  I can't wait to try other flavors.  Just as other reviewers said, it tastes like it has ice cream in it.  Can't wait to have it again tomorrow!

I just loved this receipe!  I went right in the kitchen and blended up one glass and the entire family drank it and then begged for more.
I too used the instant presweetened cappucinno mix, added vanilla and 2Tbs of spenda and it was wonderful.  My hubby likes stronger coffee flavor, so next time I'll add a bit of regular instant coffee to it.
I took everyones advice and added the coffee and sugar 1 TBS at a time until we were happy with the results!
YUMMY, DELICIOUS, a wonderful receipe!

This is really GOOD!! I made this with 3 tbsp of Milo with a tsp of instant coffee powder. I cut down the sugar like the rest to about 1 1/2 tbsp and also the vanilla extract to 1/2 tsp. Another variation i did was with 1 tbsp Hersheys chocolate syrup and 2 tbsp Milo to make it more chocolatey. Since therez syrup, sugar can also be cut down. This is simply delightful on a hot day!!

I hate coffee but made this for my parents who love coffee. I used regular instant coffee and some french vanilla non diary creamer as this was all they had on hand. I took a drink just to make sure it was drinkable and I LOVED IT! This is great! They loved it too and compared it to expensive iced coffee drinks. This one is a keeper!

Very good!  I crushed 6 ice cubes in my Vitamix then added the rest of the ingredients.  I subbed almond milk for the regular milk and used 3 packets of Splenda in place of the sugar.

We don't drink coffee so I used 1 packet of dark chocolate hot cocoa mix. Used vanilla soy milk so I omitted the vanilla and sugar. Came out perfect! The trick is to blend the ice first, add the other ingredients and blend again!

I didn't have mocha instant coffee mix so I used a healthy teaspoon of nescafe instant coffee and two heaping table spoons of swiss miss hot chocolate mix (im not a huge fan of coffee, but I may add a tiny bit more coffee next time). I also decided to skip out on the vanilla since all I had was a vanilla bean. Oh, I also used a tad bit more milk to compliment the two extra ice cubes I threw in to finish off the tray :) Tasted perfect! Thanks!

Yummy tasting but I had to alter the recipe to get it that way. 1 cup of ice is not enough. It was still very thin so I added 1/2 cup more ice. After reading the reviews, I decided to use 1/2 t. vanilla and put the sugar in to taste. The flavor was excellent with only 1/2 the vanilla and it didn't need any extra sugar. My disappointment was that I wanted a wake me up frozen coffee drink and this tasted more like a chocolate milk shake. It was creamy and good but I'll be sticking to my usual recipe with less milk, more ice, and more coffee.

wow!!!! This is amazing! Best frozen drink I have ever made by far. I was hoping for something that tastes like a mcd's mocha frap, and this is it exactly. Loved it. Made exactly as written. Topped with redi-whip and a drizzling of chocolate syrup. Next time will try with splenda. Big money saver for me being able to make these at home.

Very yummy!  I did decrease the amount of sugar to 1.5 and I still think it was a bit too much.  I also used a French Vanilla rather than the Mocha.

Absolutely GREAT! It was quick and easy. I made a couple of changes tho for my preferences. I used 1/2 sugar and put 1 tbs of chocolate syrup; still too sweet. I used a Caupachino flavored mix (i know i spelled it wrong - sorry) and absolutely DELISH!
thanks for a great recipe

This is a pretty good substitute for more expensive drinks at Starbucks.  It does tend to be a little icier, although if you grind it in a food processor it gets a little less "chunky".  Very frothy and creamy.

This was great!  I am in Thailand and we have so many of these 3 in 1 instant coffee packs that are so cheap.  I looked in my cupboard and I saw my new bag of Khao Shong Cappuccino and I decided to give it a go.  It has a hint of cocoa and plenty of sugar.  So I just added three packs, one cup of milk and a bit more ice.  It came out rich and tasty.  Move over Starbucks!

This is an ok mocha drink.  It is not starbucks in my opinion.  I also made it sugar-free with the sugar-free mocha and splenda.  Not bad for a sugar-free frozen treat!

Pretty good, I used french vanilla instant cappucino mix and splenda. I think I shouldn't have put in the extra vanilla, but it was still REALLY good. I'll be making this alot for breakfast.

We love this!  I added the mocha mix powder (like from Costco) and did not add sugar but used chocolate syrup. Then for the grown up version I toss in whatever was left from the coffee pot that morning. Love it and saved  $15.00 from buying these at the local coffee shop.

Used Nescafe Iced Java mix instead of the powder along with skim milk. Excellent but if using the Nescafe mix you should omit the 3 tablespoons of sugar.

This really does taste as good as the other's have stated.  I used Nescafe Frothe Butterfinger flavor, and soy milk.  And I only used 1 tablespoon of sugar, due to personal preference (trying to cut back), but it was still yummy.  Can't wait to make this for my husband later, our whole family loves Starbucks, but usually boycott it due to the fact that we could spend our entire phone bill money on one family trip to the coffeehouse.  This recipe has so much potential, everytime you change the flavor of coffee mix, you have an entirely new drink!

This is just as good as goin to a coffee store and getting a mocha drink.I use 1/2 tsp. of vanilla extract instead, just to make it less strong. I love this drink.

This was REALLY good!  I used English Toffee flavored Folgers Cappuccino mix, 1 cup of milk and 4 ice cubes.  I didn't use sugar or vanilla but it didn't need it.  Yummy...better than a coffee shop and much cheaper.  It looks nice if you make squiggles on the inside of the glass and put whipped cream with a cookie sticking out of the top.  Pepperidge Farms Pirrouette cookies are what I use. =)

My wife is the coffee drinker in the house.  She said this one was "ok".  I asked if I should make it again, maybe later she says.

I'm buying a new blender - because the money I save by making this at home will make it worthwhile.   Thank you for sharing this yummy drink recipe.  
To suit my taste, these are the adjustments I have made.  
2 Full TBL of Folgers Cappuccino Mocha Chocolate powder, 5 ice cubes, 1 tsp instant coffee, 3/4 cup milk, 1/2 tsp vanilla, 1 TBL sugar. 

I have also tried it with the Intl Coffee Hazelnut Belgian but it wasn't quite the same, I guess I'll have to try variations with the measurement.

WOW!

This was so amazing, and so simple.
I used 3 packets of splenda instead of the sugar

I also added different sugar-free syrups (macademia nut, raspberry).

I used skim milk, and about 6 ice cubes in a blender...came out tasting absolutely amazing, for less than 100 calories.

Really good.  I didn't have any flavored instant coffee, so I used some plain instant coffee and sugar free Nestle Quick.  Very good.

It was soooo good; I highly recommend adding a caramel topping to it either during blending or after it adds so much more taste. Overall it was a great recipe, and everyone should try it.

If I could give it a 6th star, I would!  I made one simple change by adding a packet of Splenda rather than the sugar.  The recipe worked perfectly in my great little Magic Bullet! This has become my go-to morning coffee!

We tried this with a hazelnut creme coffee mix rather than mocha, on the second try we added a trace of cinnamon and nutmeg, which really enhanced the flavor.  Extremely tasty and a much healthier alternative to the expensive frappacinos at the coffee shops.

Very refreshing!  I cut back on the sugar, used almond milk and added a little instant coffee.  Will definitely make again,  and experiment with flavors.

Delicious! I can't have dairy, so I used coconut milk (from the carton, not canned) and because all I had was instant coffee, I added mini chocolate chips. It turned out really refreshing and yummy. I'm sure that you could use almond, hemp, rice, or soy milk if you wanted.

OMG! This is SO good! For the mocha flavored instant coffee mix, I used HillsBros Sugar Free Double Mocha Cappuccino mix, and added about 1 tsp of instant coffee to bump up the coffee flavor, and I also cut the sugar in half.  It was DELICIOUS! Will be making this often!
