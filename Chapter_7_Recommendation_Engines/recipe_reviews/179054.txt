I give this recipe 5 stars because it is the best BASIC french onion soup recipe that I've found. I made several adjustments to make it healthier. I used 2 red, 2 white, and 2 yellow onions, whole wheat flour, low sodium chicken broth, and for the croutons I used whole wheat- all natural french bread with olive oil and swiss cheese then I broil in the oven.

I fixed this and loved it. I left out the wine but followed the recipe with all the other ingredients. It was very, very easy to cook and oh so good. Thank you.

I was craving French Onion soup (pregnant lol) This hit the spot and was very easy to make.  Had to leave out the wine unfortunately though.

We loved it just as described. Probably the best French Onion I've ever made.
