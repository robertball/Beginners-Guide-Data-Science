Outstanding! While I made a number of changes to suit my taste, I know this would still be a 5-star recipe as written. I added a few garlic cloves to the potatoes as they were boiling. I wilted fresh spinach and used that rather than frozen. I added some cooked, crumbled bacon, used green onion and omitted the dill weed. At this point this dish was SO delicious and SO beautiful that I thought the shredded cheese would only ruin its elegance. The cheese, I still think, would have reduced the look of these potatoes to that of an ordinary casserole.  This was the perfect accompaniment to the "Herb Crusted Chuck Roast" and green beans.

I made this for Thanksgiving this year and everybody loved it. I had a bag of fresh spinach so I sauteed it with some garlic and onions in a small amount of olive oil. I also mixed the cheddar cheese into the potato mixture instead of on top and it made for a better presentation of the dish. I felt it was a tad on the dry side so next time I make it I'll try red potatoes since they make the creamiest mashed potatoes, or I'll add a small amount of milk to the recipe. Update: I originally did this review back in 2008 and have made this many times. Two things that are really good that I wanted to share that I have since tried with this recipe is the addition of crumbled bacon bits and green onions instead. And on another occasion I have topped with Frenches onions pieces and that was a hit. Just FYI.

FREAKIN' AWESOME! I used spinach dip just because it was handy instead of the spinach and sour cream seperately. I added a little bit of garlic as well. Definitely worth making again!

This is a very unique recipe and a crowd pleaser.  The only thing I added was topping this casserole dish with French's French Fried Onions during the last 5 mins of cooking time. My family loves it!!

What a comforting dish. I made a small portion of this since it was just my husband and I. It was beyond outstanding. We finished the entire thing and my husband raved on and on about it. I added just a touch of garlic to the mix to suit our taste, but it would have been excellent without it. I think green onions would have also been excellent in this dish. I am already planning to make this one a staple on my holiday table. It is a dish I will be proud to serve. Thank you for this very delicious recipe!

This was an absolute hit!  Amazing!  I replaced the frozen spinach with fresh sauteed in garlic, and omitted the cheese- why make veggies fattening and casserole-like?  But oh so good- thank you!! =)

My husband is getting anti spinach, after always being a spinach eater! I made these and he just loved them! The only change I made in the recipe is that I used instant mashed potato's (enough) for 8 servings, added some granulated garlic and onion powder to the mix. Then I sprayed 2 small quart casseroles with non stick spray and froze one casserole for later!  Yum-O this is a great recipe for adults too!

Funny, when I was a kid, I used to mix my spinach with my mashed potatoes on my plate....! Anyway, great recipe.  I omit the dill and add a bit of fresh ground nutmeg.  Some spinach recipes often call for nutmeg.

Excellent - rich and creamy, with a slight tang from the sour cream. I cut the butter to 1/4 c. and used less cheese to try to cut the calories a bit, and it was still great. Goes very well with fish.

Delicious!  These have to be one of the best mashed potatoes ever.  They are creamy (I even used less butter and low fat sour cream) and just heavenly.  The only change I made was to use fresh spinach and add a clove of garlic, because I had a whole bag to use up, but other than that I kept them the same.  The addition of the dill is perfect, so make sure not to skip it.  These are definitely going into my rotation (and the pefect way to get the guys to eat their spinach).  Thanks for sharing!

I had to give this 5 stars because this ended up tasting WAY better than I thought it did. If anyone is health-conscious I made a few choices that greatly lowered the calories & fat without sacrificing taste. Instead of frozen spinach I wilted fresh spinach with 2 cloves of garlic in a non-stick pan. I completely omitted the butter and sour cream and added half a cup of milk instead. I also used about half a cup of cheese instead... still turned out delicious and beautiful.

This is a great new (to me) way to make mashed potatoes!  We really enjoyed them.  I scaled this down to two servings using fresh spinach, green onion and omitting the dill weed.  I sautéed my spinach with some minced garlic in a little EVOO.  I mashed the potatoes with the butter and sour cream and allowed them to cool to room temperature before folding in the remaining ingredients, including the cheese.  I didn’t want the cheese to turn my potatoes the color of orange sherbet so cooling them took care of that.  Worked just great!  I made these early in the afternoon, using individual ramekins and drizzled them with a little additional melted butter, covered and refrigerated them until it was time to re-heat.   I am thinking these would be great for entertaining, as I’m sure they could be made at least a day in advance.  Terrific recipe!!  Thank you Gail Kane!

FANTASTIC! Made exactly as written, except I did add more onion than called for, added some green onion in there and boiled 3-4 cloves of garlic w/ the potatoes. So simple to make...I actually put this together yesterday and baked it today w/ great results. Hubby said that this is one of the best potato dishes that he has had, and I agree. This will be a new staple at our house, for sure~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

We enjoyed this. It seemed a little more fancy than your average mashed potato side with minimal effort. I added a little milk too to thin it a bit so it would be more friendly for our toddler. I think next time I will sautee the onions with the spinach before adding since it suits my taste better. Thanks for the recipe!

WOW! IS THIS TO DIE FOR. I DID MAKE A FEW CHANGES AFTER READING SOME OF THE REVIEWS.  I LEFT OUT THE CHEESE, DILL AND SUBSTITUTED GREEN ONIONS FOR REGULAR ONIONS, AND USED FRESH SPINACH SAUTEED WITH BUTTER AND ROASTED GARLIC. I HAVE FINALLY FOUND A NEW WAY TO SERVE BORING POTATOES.  I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS DISH TO ANYONE WHO WOULD LIKE TO TRY SOMETHING DIFFERENT FROM THE SAME OLD MASHED POTATOES.  THANK YOU, THANK YOU

Wow, awesome!  I have to admit I didn't expect much, but we really liked this (even my husband who reallyjust wanted plain mashed potatoes).  I halved the recipe for the two of us.  I sauteed fresh spinach with the onions and some fresh garlic, added the dill to the spinach, used half the amount of cheese (some mixed in and some on top); also added some pepper.  Covered while cooking the first 15 minutes then uncovered the last 5 minutes to allow the cheese to brown just a little.  Will make again and again.

Wow! I finally got my 5 year old to like something with spinach in it!! (Just in time to start picking some from the garden!) I didn't add the cheddar as I was out and next time, I think I'll try this with 1/2 the butter and 1/2 the sour cream (without baking) just to make it healthier, but for a once-in-awhile decadent side dish, make it as is!

I added 1 clove of minced garlic, otherwise followed recipe. They were good but I would like a little more flavor. Next time I will add some chopped green onions. Will be making these again.

VERY delicious , the only thing for me was that it was too oily at the end ..leaked a little bit outside the pyrex and inside the  dish i had little oil ponds , i took off with a small spoon ..So next time i do this  i will put less butter and add up few different spices that i like .. fresh ground black pepper maybe a little nutmeg and paprika ..might add some cheddar inside the dish as well as the top too since it gives a very yummy flavor .. thanks a lot for sharing the recipe 

This is my second review and i actually forgot that i had already reviewed this recipe , i wish i had remembered , because it was way TOO OILY this time again ,please do the half of the butter , believe me it's enough..ok, next time ! i will add 1/4 cup olive oil in stead of 1/2 cup butter .but will still do it , good besides that ! i add cheese in the mixture too , yummy

For someone who is not a fan of mashed potatoes, I was licking the pan! I also found out how much I love cooked spinach which I was unaware of! 
My changes were these....
I used Greek yogurt as a healthy substitute to sour cream, margarine instead of butter, green onions, and cooked bacon. I also added some garlic salt and onion powder to taste and left out dill weed as a personal preference. I also used instant mashed potatoes since I was short on time. Basic flavors were not changed much and this was outstanding! Thanks for sharing this simple and fast recipe!

What a wickedly clever idea, with unlimited possibilities!  (This is in the oven now.) I had a container of prepared mashed potatoes, fried 3 strips of bacon, and then sauteed my onion and some garlic in the drippings. (Accidently cut up almost 1 cup of onion, but more's the merrier.) I also added an egg for some puffiness.  Used colby-jack cheese, as that was what I had and topped it with some parmesan.  Can't wait to dig in.  Tasted as I went along, and it smells yummy!

I think i tried to make this recipe too healthy by using fat free sour cream, cutting butter to 1/4c. and eliminating cheese.  I also didn't have dill on hand so used basil.  It was good but not great.

I left the dill out, like some of the others did.  Broiled for 3 mins at the end to make the cheese bubble.  Delicious!

Another incident of "we didn't have everything so I changed a few ingredients around." I used 1/4 cup margarine instead of butter, 5 ounces of evaporated milk instead of sour cream, a few shakes of onion powder instead of chopped onion, and I used some parmesan and mozzarella instead of cheddar. I boiled the spuds for 14 minutes and then steamed the spinach in the potato pot while I mashed the potatoes in a bowl. It turned out yummy (not to mention better for us!), and went well with the Slow Cooker Chicken Stroganoff off this site. Yum! Thanks for sharing, Gail. I was almost able to convince my daughter to eat spinach...

I halved the recipe and followed the recipe exactly (with the slight exception of using dehydrated onions.) Everyone liked this including the kids. I'm thinking that next time I might mix the mashed potatoes first and then lightly stir in the spinach at the end. I found with mixing the sour cream and spinach made everything green tinged instead...just not as attractive as some of the pictures that are posted.  Good recipe!

I followed the recipe exactly and believe me I am definitly not opposed to rich foods but there was WAAAAY too much butter and sour cream, I ended up with soggy potatoe goop and I made sure to use 6 decent sized potatoes and added an extra potatoe!and then the extra grease from the melted cheese on top was just too much!!! there is a good recipe in here though just make sure to add a little of the butter and sour cream at a time.. to suit your taste.

This was a really nice recipe. I also used fresh spinach and sautéed it with the onion and some garlic.  Will definitely make again! Thanks for the recipe.

Absolutely delicious! I love mashed potatoes with butter and sour cream; and I love spinach so I knew this would be a winner with me. I boiled the russet potatoes in chicken stock with fresh garlic for added flavor. I mashed the potatoes (with the garlic) and set it aside. I sauteed 1 bag of organic spinach in a little butter with garlic. Added it to the mashed russet potatoes. I omitted the dill weed completely. I added a little more butter to the mashed potatoes and all the rest of the ingredients (sour cream, cheddar cheese, green onions, etc). After I seasoned the mashed potatoes with salt and mixing everything I topped it off with more cheddar cheese. I was so pleased with the results. What a delicious comforting dish! I loved the spinach mixed in the mashed potatoes. The sour cream always adds creaminess with butter mixed in. This went nicely with the," Awesome Slow Cooker Pot Roast, "also from this website."

I really liked this.  Some people said it tasted too much like spinach;  I didn't think so but I like spinach.  I added a lot more dill than th recipe calls for - I just kept adding and tasting till I liked the taste.  I made it the day before and then took it out of the fridge about 1/2 hour before cooking it.  Topped with the cheese and baked for about 1/2 hour ... maybe a little longer.
Even though I liked it I doubt I'd make it again.

This is one of my go-to side dishes any time we're serving beef. My entire family loves these, and the kids don't even complain about eating their spinach! I sometimes whip the potatoes using my hand mixer for an almost souffle like texture.

Good, but probably won't make again as these ingredients could probably come together and make something much tastier with a few tweaks. I used cottage cheese made into sour cream (dieter's faux sour cream), added a pinch or two of nutmeg, had a little bit of blue cheese that needed to be used so I tossed that in too and a bit of panko on top. I chose to mix my cheese into the potato-spinach mixture.

Good idea but I made changes. First I used container of  refrigerated potatoes(didn't have any others). Microwaved them for a couple of minutes.  I sauted package of  fresh baby spinach, onion and clove of chopped garlic in some butter then mixed with the rest of ingredients, topped with a mixture of shredded cheeses  and baked. I also cut the amount of butter in half and used fat free sour cream.

Who would have thought that something with this much spinach could taste so good?!?! I used a whole package of spinach, even though it looked like a lot, 7 medium sized potatoes, 1/2 cup butter 1 small container of sour cream. 2 chopped green onions, 2 cloves garlic.  I chose not to put any dill in it.  I had no cheddar, so I put 4 Kraft singles on top, covered with some crumbled goat feta, and baked at 400 for about 30 minutes along with a huge fillet of salmon.  Absolutely amazing and everyone loved it!

This was very good.  I do think next time I will cook some fresh spinach.  I added some of the cheese right in with the potatoes and put the rest on top.  Will make this again. Thanks Gail!

What a nice change from regular mashed potatoes! I used unpeeled red potatoes, and added a little more dill. Just lovely! Perfect blend of flavors and very pretty. Thank you Gail!

I have made this recipe several times, usually (per others' reviews) with garlic added to the boiling potatoes, fresh spinach, and added crumbled bacon. It always gets the ultimate praise--yummy sounds from the hubs.  It makes a lot, so I usually add the cheddar to only one meal's worth at a time, which is a great thing. Today I discovered that the leftovers (made without cheese) can be made into fantastic spinach gnocchi!!!! Warm the potatoes a little, then use the proportions and directions in Sandy's "Quick gnocchi" from this site. I'd never have had the guts to try making spinach gnocchi from scratch before, but using this recipe with Sandy's, they are easy easy and delicious! Thanks to the allrecipes community for making me cook like a rock star, or feel like one, anyway.

Love love love. Always looking for a new twist on favorite dishes.  I did mix the cheese in rather than put it on top.  I will add garlic next time.  If using frozen spinach make sure you get as much water out as possible

I thought these tasted pretty good and even better than I expected them to be. I followed the recipe, but lightened it up a bit by adding only half the amount of butter and sour cream. I also used low fat sour cream. I cooked the spinach in the microwave, covered, for 5 minutes, in 1" of water. I let it cool, drained it, squeezed out the water, and then added it to the potatoes. I ended up using 5 large russets for the 6 potatoes and used a blender to mash them to make them more creamy. Per another persons suggestions, that made the recipe, I put half of the cheese in with the mashed potatoes. The only down side to the recipe is they take some time to make and dirty quite a few dishes. They are creamy, when blended with a beater, and filling. I would just consider reducing the salt, by at least 1/4 tsp., as it is quite a bit.

I have to confess - I altered this recipe so much, that its not REALLY fair to rate it - but I am sure its fabulous as written and it inspired me to do the following:  I cooked fresh spinach from the garden and potatoes seperately, then mashed and mixed them together with a knob of butter and a little milk, two eggs, grated chesse and nutmeg.  It was fabulous -we loved it!!!

Very tasty, though I thought it would come out more like a casserole...but that was my mistake. :)  I put some of the cheese in halfway through transferring the potatoes to the casserole dish, which was nice.

I had more spinach than potatoes.  I used two cans of potatoes and 1 can of spinach.  I tried this recipe because I was looking for something for my son to eat after having spacers put in.  I added garlic, onion, paprika and pepper.  Instead of using cheddar I mixed in parmesan cheese.  It is soft enough that if my son feels like swallowing it whole, he can.  Thank you for a creative recipe.

Great tators!  This makes a nice filling side dish.  As with all recipes that have spinach in them, I normally always cut the spinach in half so there isn't an overpowering amount of it for our tastes.  It was perfect!  Instead of onion, I used green onion and added a dash of garlic powder too.  So good!  My husband loved these and kept asking me to make them again.  They are so flavorful, no gravy needed!  Thanks for the great recipe!  This is a keeper!  Update: I cannot tell you how many times my husband asks for these, even several years later from first trying this recipe.  It is his favorite side dish now.  I normally just make them by heart now and don't follow a recipe and just add  everything in by a dash here and dash there until I get them the way I want them to taste at that time.  I usually serve these individual style for each person and bake them in an individual small ramekin dish to put that special added touch to an excellent side dish with a meal.  Thank you again for sharing this wonderful recipe!

Holy cow! The only bad thing about this is that it could ruin my diet! I couldn't stop eating it.  I added some chives to the potato mix, but otherwise kept it the same. Next time, I might mix some cheddar cheese into the potato mixture, too.  Very good, whole family (two picky teenagers and a picky preteen) LOVED it, and so did my husband!

Great recipe. I left out the dill because I did not have any but didn't replace it with any other seasoning so I though they were a little bland-my fault.  I think I will make them again and throw in some bacon bits this time!

These are EXCELLENT and loaded with flavor!  They're everything a stand-alone potato dish should be.  I used fresh baby spinach and sautéed it a skillet with a bit of olive oil and kosher salt until wilted.  Huge, huge hit!

I almost entirely eliminated the sour cream and used 1/2 and 1/2. It was excellent!

Too much sour cream!  I'm Polish and when a Pole says too much sour cream, it's too much.  LOL! I'll be cutting that back to 1/4 c or 2 TBSP.  I am not a fan of dill and followed a previous commenter's advice and subbed bacon (!) instead.  I also added a smidge of chopped onion and cut down on the butter.  I know my family, I also halved the spinach.  It's a good starting point to shape into your own vision and I plan to tinker with this.  It's a nice change of pace from ordinary mashed pots.

This is a new favorite of mine.  To die for.  I used mostly olive oil with a bit of butter and light sour cream and fresh baby spinach.  Then I used my immersion blender.  After it was done I added some extra chopped onion and dill.  Was even better the next day after being refrigerated over night.

Absolutely delicious!  I made this for two people, so I went down to two big russet potatoes, half a cup of sour cream, same amount of onion and two tablespoons or so of butter.  I used 2/3rds of a bag of spinach and this made it super spinachy.  I skipped the dill and also used a nice English sharp cheddar.  My husband and I both loved it.

No rating since I modified. Used steamed, chopped kale, a bit of garlic, !/4 cup Greek yoghurt instead of sour cream and 1/4 cup light cream cheese. It was delish! Gonna give it four stars just for the idea which ditto sounds great.

THANK YOU GAIL!!!!!  This was SOOOO delicious.  I made a few changes to suit my taste.  I doubled the dill and still couldn't taste it.  Wondering if it was just super subtle flavor that I would miss if it wasn't there.  I also used 16 oz of fresh spinach that I chopped in the food processor and then used the butter to saute the spinach.  Reduced a lot of the liquid out of the spinach as I was afraid it would make the potatoes watery if I didn't get some of the liquid out.  I wouldn't have minded omitting the step of chopping the fresh spinach.  But I wanted my 6 year old to try this dish and I knew the bigger pieces/strands would be difficult for her.  I also cut way down on the butter.  About 1/4 cup, but could easily cut that down even more.  I used really purple onion, which added a strong flavor plus a pop of color, about a 1/4 cup worth.  I don't really think the cheese (extra sharp cheddar) added anything to the dish with it being on top.  Will be making this dish again and adding cheese (maybe cut amount in half) mixed into the potatoes instead.  I could also see how this dish would be a great base to add other vegetables.  I want to make it again and add mushrooms.  But could imagine so many other vegetables being added well to this!  Definitely making it again.  The entire family loved this dish!

Very good and quick dish - I had to make some modifications, because I did not have enough potatoes (I added aotmeal), but it turned out very tasty and filling.

Some reviewers complained that this recipe was too bland, but I cooked my potatoes in salted water and added the spices according to taste (did not measure), so I felt the casserole had plenty of flavor.  I cooked a 10 oz. bag of fresh spinach rather than use frozen.  I would make this recipe again.

This may be a good option to get little kids to eat their spinach, but it doesn't work as well for adults. Without the spinach, this would have been an excellent mashed potato dish, however the spinach left a nagging flavor on your tongue after each bite. You couldn't really tell what you were tasting, but you knew it wasn't good.

I used fresh spinach that I sauteed in a bit of the butter with some fresh minced garlic and a little more chopped onion. I used reduced fat cheddar cheese and organic red potatoes. We thought this was good but I think it would have been bland had I not thought to add in the garlic and extra onion. I really liked this but my family was just not digging it. Next time, I think I'd like to add a little more spices, like maybe dry ranch seasoning.

Very good and will definitely make again! Only thing is for 6 potatoes, 1 tsp of salt is nothing. I will definitely add more salt next time (I guess that is my latin culture creeping out!).

Very tasty :) Fried the onions a little before adding them and instead of topping with cheese layered the cheese between the potatoes. No sour cream where I live so I just used cream. Reading the other reviews I have to add garlic ... was tempted to but didn't dare it. Served with chicken! Yummy!

I REALLY liked this and I can see myself making it often, especially for special occasions (Thanksgiving, etc).  I did make a few changes -- I reduced the amount of butter by half (& added an extra half-teaspoon of salt to compensate), plus a half-teaspoon or so of black pepper, and a pinch of nutmeg.  I also used low-fat sour cream and about half the amount of cheese.  Next time I'd like to try a different cheese, perhaps Gruyere... mmmm.  I might try grating the onion next time instead of chopping it, and I might also double the spinach and reduce the potatoes a bit.  I love recipes like this in which one can make endless variations!

I thought this was good, but I would make a few alterations. I would add a little half & half or milk to the potatoes so they arent quite as dry. Plus, I would also add a little parmesean cheese. I did add green onions and will do so again. My husband thought bacon would be perfect, because then it would have all the components of a loaded baked potato or twice baked potato. Even with a bit of tweeking or embellishment--it is very good.

You can reduce the fat out of this recipe and add more vegetables in if desired. I wouldn't cut down on the butter though. I used half the sour cream and cheese adding in other veggies and was a wonderful side dish and pretty. Family loved it.

i have never written a review but i had to do this one...delicious. and an easy way to combine your side and veggy in one dish! i only used 3TB butter and mixed my cheese in with the other ingredients instead of as a topping. even my husband commented and he is a man of few words! thanks for sharing this gail :)

This was okay. It was not a "hit" with our family but it was a nice spin on sweet potatoes. If I do this again, since it was a little dry, I would cook it a shorter amount of time and add generous amounts of sour cream and cheese (at least 2 cups of cheese)

I loved this, tastes very similar to a twice baked potato.  Yumm! Only gave 4 stars cause my kids wouldn't eat it.  No one could tell me why they didn't like it, just a very general--we don't like it Mom! I'll just make it smaller next time for myself and the hubby!

Very good dish. I didn't include the dill so I put garlic powder in.

Oh, this was SO GOOD!!! I modified with bacon grease in lieu of the butter and added some Mrs. Dash (no salt), and left the potatoes cubed. This dish is now a staple!

Very good. My husband, who is used to eating at fine restaurants on business and is fussy when he gets home said it was delicious! We served this with grilled salmon and it went well together.

Very good.    I took the advice of some reviewers and sauteed a bit of garlic with my fresh spinach and mixed some of the cheese in the potato mixture.   We had it with ham but it could be a meatless entree as it's filling enough.

I would give this 10 stars if I could! I had only fresh spinach so I sauted some red onion and wilted the spinach in it. I also mixed in the cheese since I did not read the instructions carefully enough. I almost did not have enough left to put in the oven haha!

This is so yummy! I used low fat yogurt instead of sour cream since I didn't have any, and it turned out great! I'll be making this one again, and even seeing if my spinach-hating husband would try it.

This was very good. The only thing I changed was to use fresh spinach, lowfat sour cream and fresh dill. I made this as a side to christined's Best Ever Brisket. I will be making this again.

Simply divine.  Used red potatoes (didn't peel them) and a fresh bunch of spinach.  Sauteed medium chopped onion in butter till tender, added spinach and cooked just till wilted.   Added minced garlic to the potatoes while boiling which game them a deep, savory garlic flavor..   Mixed in quite of bit of shredded Longhorn cheddar as well as some on top.  Oh, and I wouldn't skip the dill--the dill gives it quite an extraordinary unique kick.  This is definitely a keeper!

Used fresh spinach, and left out the sour cream and dill. Added bacon crumbled. Awesome! The bacon in it wasn't as good when we had the leftovers though. It got kind of soggy- yuck. But just after you make it the taste was delicious!

These were better than I thought they would be.  I mixed the cheese in with the spinach/potato mixture instead of putting it on top, used 3 green onions and added cracked pepper.  I also sprinkled bread crumbs on the top before baking.  Next time I think I will cut the butter in half.  Don't think it really adds anything to it except extra fat and calories.

Very good! I shredded pre-boiled potatoes, cooked the spinach then cooled it. In the sour cream, I added, ground red pepper, tablespoon dill, graded 1/2 onion, granulated garlic. Mixed everything together. I think this is a keeper. Great blend of flavors. My whole family loved it! It would also make a great pot luck. Thank you Sally for the recipe.

I made these potatoes for dinner last night and they were delicious.   I added garlic powder, onion flakes and french fried onions to the top of the dish. I also microwaved the spinach till softened.  Will make again.

These were amazing! I used instant potatoes and it was still wonderful and it shaved a ton of time off of the recipe. I will definitely be making this again. Be sure if you use instant potatoes that you follow the box directions and then don't add the salt, milk, or butter that the recipe calls for.

Very nice update to basic mashed potatoes! Added a touch of garlic and used plain yogurt instead of sour cream since that was what I had on hand. Will probably tinker with the spices a little more to suit our tastes but definately worth repeating. Thanks!

I would make this again!  Next time I might try Mexican cheese blend to give it a bit more oomph. I didn't taste the dill weed at all. I blended the cheese into the mixture, instead of putting it on top. I added some minced garlic. 
Thanks for the recipe!

Great recipe! I was thinking of a new take on mashed potatoes and thought why not add spinach? And since there is nothing new under the sun, I came here to look for a similar recipe  to what I was thinking. I added crushed garlic and scallions as well, and like many reviewers, I didn't add the cheese or put it in the oven to avoid the casserole texture. I wanted it creamy but with the addition of ingredients not commonly used in mashed potato recipes. I also added chives to top it off. Very nice recipe indeed!!!

Really good!  Pretty much followed recipe with a few suggestions from others.  Boiled the potatoes with 2 cloves of garlic.  Added a pinch of nutmeg and cayanne and black pepper, and 2 chopped green onions.  Used only 1/4 c. of butter and added 1/2 c. milk because the potatoes seemed dry.  Reduced salt to 1/2 tsp.  I stirred in the cheese instead of on top and added 3 Tb. parmasan cheese.  They tasted so good as is I didn't bother to cook in the oven.  Some bacon would have been great but didn't want to fool with the mess from cooking it.  Served with some kilbasa.  Will definitely make again.

Wonderful dish! Whole family enjoyed this. Used baby spinach instead of frozen. Added some garlic as we have garlic in just about everything! Might add some bacon and spring onion next time just to jazz it up. Otherwise, delicious. 10/10. Thanks for a great recipe.

A definite keeper!! I followed the recipe with a few of the more common changes made by others: I sautéed the onions in garlic and olive oil. I used wilted fresh spinach, mixed in the cheddar cheese instead of putting it on top and threw on a few fried onion pieces for texture. My family raved about this. The flavors were amazing.

Made with red skin potatoes and was worried the potato to other ingredients would be off (since they were a bit smaller than traditional potatoes). It was a bit gooey before the oven but after cooking they were Great!

If I could give this more stars, I would! This is the absolute best mashed potato recipe ever! Today I made it and only used about 2 tablespoons of butter to sauté the onions. No more butter. Also, I have tried this recipe with different kinds of cheese on top: emmental, parmesan and today feta. Any kind of cheese on top before baking works and is so good! I will always make this recipe.

I made this with Lentils And Spinach and put the lentils on top of the potatoes and my wife and two young girls liked it a lot! The mashed potatoes were also excellent by themselves!

Totally awesome!  I added a handful of whole garlic to my potatoes while they were boiling.  I also sautéed lots of garlic and a whole onion and added fresh spinach.  I didn't have sour cream, so I mashed the potatoes and garlic with a little coconut milk.  And I took the suggestion of other reviews and added French's Onions on top to bake.  I don't think I'll ever want boring plain mashed potatoes again.

Put me down as another fan!  I boiled 3 potatoes, and as they drained, sautéed about 2 cups of spinach in a little water and about 1/2 T butter, with about 1/4 tsp jarred roasted garlic.  Once nicely wilted, I dumped the potatoes back in the pan and took the masher to the whole thing.  Once mashied, I added about 1/4 C shredded cheese and stirred.  I had no sour cream and DH hates dill, so I added about 1 tsp apple cider vinegar (hey, I'd always loved it on spinach and on my steak fries!) and stirred some more.  The vinegar gave it just the right 'sour' note.  I didn't add extra cheese or bother baking (though I will in the future, and I'll be usin' the ramekins to make 'em pretty!).  I'll also be trying them with bacon (for me...DH won't eat it).  This recipe is going into permanent rotation!  Many thanks!

Wow, this was a surprise to us especially my daughter.  She loved it!  However, I didn't top it with cheese but will try the next time.  Used fresh spinach, dashes of garlic powder, green onions.

We had an overload of spinach from our CSA so I sautéed it with garlic and replaced the frozen. We really enjoyed this adaptation of a classic. Next time I will halve the sour cream, butter, and cheese just to cut down on the fat. Will make these again for sure. Thanks for sharing your mother's recipe Gail.

Probably some of the best mashed potatoes I've ever made! I used hickory smoked cheddar, but I just mixed them into the potatoes instead of putting it on top of the potatoes. Excellent recipe that I plan on using again!

I made these exactly as written only adding two types of onion. The only thing I did different was to make these potatoes a filling for Pierogies. Very good!

I thought this was fabulous, but my husband and kids didn't like it so much. I used a little less spinach than called for, and less cheese as well, but next time I think I would use the entire amount of both. I will be making this again.

This was quite tasty, my son had 2 helpings! I used 12 small potatoes, halved the butter, sour cream and cheese. I used fat free sour cream. I didn't cook the spinach, just squeezed it dry in a sieve. I sauteed a small onion in the butter and added some minced garlic, omitted the salt and dill, used Habanero cheese blend which added a nice kick.

I decreased the sour cream and butter by half and doubled the dill.  We added 1% cow's milk until it was a mashed potato consistency.  We left out the cheese and didn't bake the dish.  I sauteed the onion with about 1 tbsp butter until it was translucent and then added the chopped spinach and sauteed them together.  Mixed everything up and everyone liked it.

This was yummy.  As per an other reviewer, I mixed the cheese in the potatoes before baking, it really did make a nicer presentation.  I would make this again, perhaps adding some bacon and more onion.

My family really ate this dish up. I felt guilty for taking seconds until just now rating this recipe as I was going to say I did omit the dill, but realize now that I did omit (mistakenly) the butter, too.  Obviously, I didn't miss it.  Some other changed I made was add provelone cheese to the cheddar and cut back on the sour cream by using Greek yogurt. Now I am even more impressed with the recipe and will definitely make it again without feeling as guilty.

I left out the onion and used the cheese I had on hand.  I also used fresh spinach sauteed in garlic.  I will probably add bacon and stir the cheese into the potatoes the next time I make this.

I microwaved the spinach for a minute or two to defrost it and it was fine. Great recipe, thanks!

Excellent recipe and SO TASTY! I used fresh spinach instead, left out the dill weed and added freshly ground black pepper. So delicious that I now use it as a topping on my shepherd's pie or cottage pie instead of the usual mashed potato.

My daughter recently turned vegetarian and it's been hard trying to please the whole family at mealtime. But everyone loved this. I didn't have dill weed so just left it out. Will definately be putting this on the make again list.

Great tasty and so easy to make.  I did mash my potatoes with butter and milk, so did not add the butter to the mix.  Also added the cheese, rather than just sprinkle on the top.  I sauteed onions, garlic and the spinach on their own to add a little extra flavor.  Pretty sure I will be making this again.

LOL....Thanks!

This was very good! Nice change from regular mashed potatoes. I used about 3/4 of the box of spinach because it looked like way too much if I used all of it, I think it would have overpowered the dish, even though I love spinach. It seems it would be more of a spinach casserole than spinach in mashed potatoes. I used a bit more cheese and mixed some in the potato mixture and topped the dish also before baking. I will definitely make this again! Thanks for sharing :)

Bake time needs to be at least doubled. Soak up oil with paper towels as it cooks, and bake until casserole puffs up and turns golden.

This is a great way to add some spinach to a meal.  I liked these potatoes pretty well and think that the addition of garlic would help with the taste.  I left out the dill weed because I don't really care for that flavor.

Made it as written the first time and it was good. Incorporated several of the suggestions others made, which I've posted as the modified recipe, and it was divine . . . . The entire 11x15 pan was consumed by 10 adults in the course of Thanksgiving dinner along with demands I make it again in the future. DEFINITELY a keeper, Gail - thank you for sharing it.

I took a shortcut and used a box of Betty Crocker Instant Roasted Garlic mashed potatoes; also stirred the cheese into the mixture.  Everyone loved it so there were no leftovers.

This is so yummy! I also didn't peel my potatoes. To make it a little more healthy, I used just enough sour cream and butter to make the mixture creamy. I will definitely make this recipe again!

YUMMMMM-EE! This recipe combined so many of my favorite things...mashed potatoes, spinach, CHEESE and sour cream! They were easy to boot. I used fresh spinach because that's what I had - nuke in the micro for a few and ready to add. This is a definite keeper!

If food is love, then I have a big fat crush on Sally's Spinach Mashed Potatoes!  These were so yummy and comforting.  I used leftover garlic mashed potatoes (which saved a bunch of time) and thawed/squeezed dry frozen spinach.  I didn't top the dish with cheese, but I put plenty of cheddar in the mix before I baked it.  I froze part of the UNCOOKED mixture for later.  I figure I can put it in a casserole dish and bake it on the fly when I'm in the mood.  Which, is probably gonna be pretty soon, because I loved this dish!

These are a great way to incorporate spinach into a meal!  My 1 1/2 yr old loved them!! That right there is worth 5 stars ;)
2nd time I made it I did not have enough sour cream and subbed cottage cheese for the remainder. Also used dried minced onion to be quick.

4.5 to be fair.  I've found they are still very good with half the butter (1/4 C) and a touch of pepper and garlic and a lot less cheese.  I froze the left overs in little containers that my baby loves to eat!

This was pretty good.  I guess I was expecting something more flavorful though?  I've added it to my recipe box, but if I make it again I will add more salt, and maybe add more cheese mixed in with the potatoes and mash!

This was a great way to spice up mashed potatoes. Thank you for the recipe. I did by accident, put in more onion than was called for but it still turned out great. I did not have the dill or the cheddar, so I used thyme and rosemary and colby-jack instead. Yummy!

Soooo good! I did as another reviewer said and used instant mashed potatoes instead to cut down the cooking time. As this person suggested, I used butter and milk for the instant mashed potatoes so didn't add extra as this recipe calls for. It turned out perfectly! We had it two nights ago and I'm just about to make it again! Thanks for the recipe.

REALLY delicious.  I used fresh baby spinach, lightly steamed, squeezed, and chopped, rather than frozen.  I'll make this often.

These are a great way to get your family to eat spinach!  I wasn't sure what type of onion to use, so I used a green onion--used more than a tablespoon--chopped it fine all the way through most of the green.  Also, didn't have dill, so used tarragon, which gave it a slightly sweeter taste that was very good.  Used my mixer to blend the potatoes, as we like them without any lumps.  The spinach was good, but I may try chopped broccoli next time, as I think it will work also.  A great recipe that we'll have again.

I made this spinach mashed potato casserole for the first time this Christmas and it was divine! The only change I made was substituting a generous pinch of onion powder for the onion, since my friend does not like the texture of onion. It looked gorgeous and was so delicious! I might be making it regularly rather than reserving it for holidays, even considering the stick of butter and all that cheese! Lol!

Hubby was skeptical of these because of the spinach. First bite won him over. Nice spin on plain old mashed potatoes.

I changed it a bit being vegetarian 
I used avocado instead of sour cream and vegan butter
It was delicious. Just needs a bit more spice/salt

Easy, time-saving recipe.  I added Panko bread crumbs on top and that added a bit of crunch.  Seemed like it could use some additional spices but not quite sure what.  Will experiment around some.  Makes a lot of left overs and freezes well.

I tweaked the recipe: no salt, paprika on top, bake with foil on top, increase dill to 2 1/2 teaspoons! :) , sautee 3 onions in canola oil on hot heat until translucent-replaces dehydrated onion (great if in a hurry), Reduced cheese to total of 1/4 of  8 ounce cheddar, saved 2" square for grating on top last minute, grated the rest and mix it right into casserole...THIS MAKES SURE PEOPLE DON'T JUST PICK OFF THE GRILLED CHEESE THEN SAY, "I GUESS I AM NOT AS HUNGRY AS I THOUGHT."...AVOIDING THE NUTRITIOUS SPINACH (a super veggie-just look at Popeye!) Replaced diil weed herb with whole dill seed from natural food COOP...adds texture..nice zing when you bite into the dill seeds. Delicious.

I used fresh spinach and put some garlic in while cooking. I did not have any dill.  I left out the cheese  and sour cream to reduce calories and did not miss it.  Great dish, will def make for a crowd as you can make ahead and reheat.

Yes, I did make some changes based on reviews of others; I added some green onions and garlic powder, reduced the amount of cheese and incorporated that into the mixture.
In addition I did not peel the potaatoes.  I never peel any fruit or vegetable unless necessary.  After all these changes the one other change would be for 1.5 or even 2 teaspoons of salt.
Thank you for this recipe.  It lends itself to variations.

These were delicious!  I made the recipe as written; the only thing I will do differently next time I make this is cut the spinach in half but that's just a personal preference.

I added additional dill, to equal 1 tsp. My son and husband are loving this dish! Big kudos when they don't like anything in the veggie line. I have added garlic powder to the potatoes as I was mashing them.

This was very good. However, I cooked fresh spinach with a tad of herbal salt. 1/2 cup of butter as I noticed with 1/4 seem dry. Tad more dill. Granulated garlic to taste as well as tad more pepper and salt.mashed potatoes with skin then added butter for consistency then sour cream, and dill...Thanks

I loved this =) although I didn't use the cream since I didn't have it, I substituted it with like half a cup of whole milk plus I added one good spoon of minced garlic (and mixed the cheese instead of topping the whole thing) like many reviewers suggested and...yummm perfect for a cold day's dinner. I am so making this again!

I made a few changes including using straight fresh spinach (I would sauté it lightly next time), adding more onion, and reducing the amount of sour cream to swap in Boursin cheese instead of cheddar. The only reason I don’t give it a five, as I made it, is that I could not get it to crust up at the top as I would have liked. But the Boursin!

Excellent! Chopped a little extra onion and had to substitute for part of the sour cream, as I didn't have enough on hand, but was very pleased with the result. Reminded me of a twice-baked potato sans bacon. Will make again!

Very nice change for a side dish.  I will be making this again.  I had fresh spinach to use up so I precooked it in a pan with a little oil.  Chopped it up after it cooled before adding it to the recipe.  We had some of the casserole left over so warmed it up the next morning.  Ate it on the side with our cheese omelette.  Yummy!

I used a bag of fresh spinach (stems cut off and sauteed in oil for about a minute) instead of frozen. Also, I did not top with cheese, which is good when you want to emphasize the taste of the potatoes.

I used 1/4 cup of butter and, 1/2 a block of Neufchatêl cheese (light cream cheese) instead of cheddar (because that's what I had to work with) and mixed it in. 
I also sauteed the onions with some garlic before mixing it in.  
Delish!

Loved these! I added fresh spinach and more then required.  I did what others did and sautéed mine with the garlic and onion.  On top I also mixed the cheese with fried onions before I put it in the oven. When I boiled the potatoes I did them in a chicken broth to add flavor. Will make again.

I found this recipe in my ARMagazine.  I cut the recipe in half as I felt half would be enough for two people.  I did use fresh spinach that I steamed first.  I had high hopes for this but was sadly disappointed.  Don't think I'll make again.  It might have been the combo of spinach in the mashed potatoes.  Just not our cup of tea.

I have to start with I do not care for mashed potatoes so this was just okay.  My family liked it though and the fact that I added some fresh sautéed spinach to it was a nice way to get in some extra greens.  Easy dish overall.  I left out the dill but would add some other seasonings that we prefer next time.

I have made this recipe twice.  I did use fresh spinach. I did not cook the spinach.  I stirred into mashed potatoes and the spinach cooked during the baking time, making it super fast and easy. Otherwise prepared as written.  Absolutely delicious. Great with meatloaf. I will make it again and will use it on top a shepherd's pie instead of plain mashed potato.

Wonderful! The only changes I made was to follow some suggestions made in the comments. I used fresh spinich, added a garlic clove when i cooked the potatoes and mixed the cheese in the casserole. We loved this!

I made a number of changes but I still have to give this five stars as-is. I do not like dill so I excluded it. I decided to sauté the onions (and add garlic) rather than adding them raw. When I saw cheese and potatoes I instantly thought of bacon so I added that as well. It was probably about five cooked pieces that I sprinkled on top prior to the cheese. It was fabulous!

I made this recipe using fresh potatoes from the garden, and it was really good. to make it great, I think I will omit the dill and add roasted garlic, or chives.

Very very good!  Easy and delicious!  Used fresh spinach sauteed in garlic and small amount of olive oil.  Can definitely use less butter.  Used pepperjack cheese and added some to potato mixture as well as on top.  Will definitely make again and again!

Potatoes usually wake a while to cook, so I would recommend chopping them up in slices or chunks to speed up the process. Very good

i read a few of the reviews before making this and made these changes :i added the spinach frozen to the hot drained potatoes,mashing the mixture together till the spinach was thawed. i omitted the dill weed.i added 1 tsp garlic powder and 1 tsp onion powder. we like food cheesey,so i doubled the cheese amount and added most of the cheese during the mashing,reserving 1/2 c shredded for the topping.

I use recipes as a general outline.  I combined this recipe with caramelized onion and fried mushroom, bacon, and onion.  I used this recipe with fresh spinach, no salt, and used buttermilk instead of sour cream.  To that I added dried thyme, black pepper, bacon, sunflower oil, and olive oil.  I really liked it.  This is not to discredit the other recipes.  I am too much of an independent.  Thank you.

This was excellent and a fabulous way to sneak some veges into a meal.  I followed others and used fresh spinach sauted in olive oil and garlic and instead of the cheese on time, I added cheesy French's fried onions.  My 1 year old is very picky and won't eat veges, but loved these.  My husband is not a mashed potato fan, but he went back for seconds as well.  I will definitely be making again!

I've made this according to the directions and it is an absolute hit in our house.  I have also made slight modifications by omitting the dill...adding fresh spinach, which is also yummy!  I often make this without measuring anything and just throwing ingredients in.  This is still a fantastic side dish and super tasty!  You can't go wrong!  Thanks so much for submitting it.

I needed a potato side for Thanksgiving last minute. I found this, and thought I had all the ingredients. I did not, so, I have to say, I used the dill, sour cream, butter mix as written, then sautéed bacon, mushrooms, red pepper. I chopped all those, cooked the bacon first, used the bacon grease to cook the mushrooms, peppers oh and I used the onion also. I mixed the veggies with the bacon. I set aside and let cool. I mixed the cheese with the sour cream, dill, s an p and butter. I did add a few splashes of Franks red hot also. When I mashed the potato's, I added a splash of milk and a few pats of butter. I then mixed the bacon veggie mix with the sour cream and cheese mix. Then added the potatos. I then spread all that into a 9x13 pan and baked. I did deserve some bacon and in the last five mins of baking, I sprinkled the bacon and a handful of cheese. The top cheese melt nicely over the bacon on top, then when we scooped it out for serving, you got nice cheese and bacon in top but also in the mix too. It was so yummy! I did not have spinach, but will continue to use the base of the recipe here with my add ins. I normally do not change recipes on here, and I have to say the base recipe is good, so thank you for helping me make a great side!

I made this for Thanksgiving.  I made the serving fit 8 and used Idaho potatoes.  The recipe was easy to make but the most time was taken with chopping the potatoes.  I'm sort of novice/intermediate with cooking too in my late 20s.  Everyone enjoyed it and got seconds.  I kept adding idolized salt but didn't want to overdo it.  I would have liked more salt but next time I'll use kosher salt for exact flavoring. I used a yellow onion.  I added my first AR photo ever.

Really tasty and nice that you can embellish with other ingredients as desired.  I added some chopped fresh mushrooms and green onions.  Skipped the cheese as the taste was great even without it.  Nice change to mashed potatoes.

I have been waiting until I have a big crowd over to make these (I love getting lots of feedback on new recipes!), and I followed directions exactly except for two things: I used plain yogurt instead of sour cream and, after tasting the final product, doubled the dill because I thought it tasted so good. They were marvellous, my new favorite mashed potato recipe, and my guests loved them. Thank you for an excellent recipe!

This dish tasted great. I used green onions and fresh chopped spinach instead. I sauted the spinach in olive oil with 1 tbsp  minced garlic. I mixed all the ingredients in the pot I used to cook the potatoes. I mixed in half the cheese and topped the casserole with the other half. I thought it was a bit bland so I doubled the dill and green onions, added a 1/4 tsp black pepper and a dash of nutmeg. Thanks for the recipe!

I really wanted to like these.  They were not flavorful or creamy.  I used Wisconsin sharp white cheese and they still didn't do it for us.

Yum!!!  Holy cow were these delicious and gloriously addictive. I did not expect much from this recipe thinking it had spinach and would be gross. I had a ton of fresh spinach on hand and so decided to make them. I softened the spinach with a little olive oil in the fry pan.The only real change I made to these was to take out the onion and substitute the butter for less olive oil. I also used less of the sour cream. I think that just depends on the size of your potatoes. The only thing I would do differently next time would be to chop the big pieces of fresh spinach down a little smaller.

After reading other reviews, I also decided to add some bacon bits, green onions, and garlic. I also added some onion powder. This was delicious! I think this would be a great way to give some extra veggies to your kids, without compromising the taste of the potatoes.

This recipe is fabulous! I was looking for a new potato recipe & what a gem! I followed the suggestions of others to saute some fresh spinach in olive oil with garlic & onions. Instead of sour cream, I used Tzatziki sauce  (and omitted dill since there already was some in the sauce) and it turned out beautifully. I look forward to trying it with sour cream & dill next time. 

Thank you for sharing your recipe by showing us a great way to enjoy spinach while also livening up plain old mashed potatoes.

Everyone enjoyed!!  Used one package of frozen spinach with 8 xtra large potatoes, 1/2 the butter, and added a bit of milk (mine were very stiff) and about 1T Parmesan cheese.

I loved these potatoes!  I made these to go with 'Pot Roast with Balsamic Vinegar' from AR and the potatoes were the best part of the meal!  I used fresh steamed spinach rather than frozen and I did not add the cheese at the end.  This is a great way to get some add veggies and iron in to your diet.  I will be making mashed potatoes this way again, soon.

Made this to go on the side of a pot roast and my family loved it. I didnt have dill weed which would have been great with it. What i did though as other reviewers have suggested is wilt some fresh spinach down with garlic to add to it, turned out great :)

I was disappointed and that surprised me.  I followed the recipe, used fresh spinach, I divided the casserole, one side had dill, the other didn't.  I did add garlic and bacon, and if it hadn't been for the bacon it wouldn't have had any flavor.  It wasn't bad, but wasn't great either.  I love spinach and I love mashed potatoes.  It needed something, and I can't decide what.  I felt like it needed a crunchy crust on the bottom or flaky pie crust for texture.  Once baked it needed extra salt and I added pepper.

If I make again I will try it w/new red potatoes, instead of Yukon Gold, mix in some parmesan cheese and feta w/the bacon and spinach to see if that doesn't give it more of a spark in the flavor dept.

We loved this recipe. I used 2 bags of fresh baby spinach and cooked it with dehydrated onions. I also boiled the potatoes with 6 cloves of fresh garlic pressed into the salted boiling water. I used reduced fat sour cream and smart balance instead of butter. I also added a little milk for better consistency. It was great! Will make again for sure.

This is excellent! For a  fast option: use instant mashed potatoes.  I add fresh minced garlic for extra flavor and, for fun, try adding chopped green chili peppers to taste. I like the canned ones because it's a quick way to put this dish together. If you use instant potatoes, all you'll need to do is shape the potato mixture into logs or patties, top with cheese and pop them under the broiler until the cheese melts and the potatoes are lightly browned. About 5 minutes instead of 20 in the oven. Can be made in advance in quantity and frozen.

This recipe was to die for!! I didnt follow it exactly though. I used yukon potatoes, dill, butter like the recipe said, but I added fresh spinach sauteed with garlic and onions in evoo. What I added was a spinach and artichoke dip I had already made from the store. I left the sour cream out because the dip had enough cream. I mixed mozz chz in and topped with cheddar, unbelievable!! My fam asked for more the next day!! Thanx for sharing a treasure!

Very good, a little too fatty for my taste. I reduced the sour cream and butter to half and used low fat margarine and sour cream instead and it tasted really good.

This is an awesome recipe! it is definately down home fat people comfort food so watch your portion size!  I made it with just what I had in the fridge so it was a little different.  I didn't have enough potatoes, so I used sweet potatoes too -I also used more onions (about 1/3 c), added minced garlic and instead of sour cream I used a combination of  Cream cheese, kefir cheese and plain yogurt.  Also double the dill.  It was savory and tasty!

This was delicious! I sauteed fresh spinach with a little garlic and onions in a small amount of olive oil rather than using frozen. This gave the potatoes wonderful flavor. I also added a touch of milk after reading one review that thought the potatoes were a little dry.  They were perfect. This recipe is a keeper.

I make great mashed potatoes, but I wanted to jazz them up.  Tried this recipe, not knowing if my husband would like it.  I knew my sons would.  To my suprise, he loved them. YAY!! The only changes I made were to add 1/2 c cream of mushroom soup, 1/4 cup of sour cream and I topped with freshed grated extra sharp cheese. 
My son takes his lunch to school and he told me he was hoping the potatoes were in his lunch today. Maybe tomorrow :-) Thanks Sally!

It was really good! My son loves mashed potatoes but this one he loved:) I'm glad he did since I always have a hard time for him to eat his veggies. Thank you for the recipe!

These are delicious! My DH isn't a fan of mashed potatoes but even he really liked these.  I followed the recipe exactly except for mixing half the cheese with everything else and topping it with the other half.  My only comment is that these are a bit wet and soupy - I'll probably reduce the butter & sour cream by half next time, but we will definitely have this again!

this casserole was a hit in my home last night even though I  used some substitutes out of necessity.  I wanted to use up left over mashed potatoes and left over spinach. my spinach had been sauteed with diced tomatoes and jalapeno. so with that extra zing, I did not add the dill. I also added a half cup of the cheddar cheese to the mixture and mixed in Greek yogurt instead of sour cream. Like I said, an instant hit. next time I will plan on the original ingredients.thanks Gail for sharing

Wonderful dish!  Made little dishes and shared with family, everyone really enjoyed the flavor.  My little guy (10) says " Mom you're the best cook!" Thank you Ms. Gail for the recipe. It was a big hit!

Really, really love this dish. We ate it as our entree instead of as a side dish - very filling. I used green onions, fat free sour cream and only half of the oleo called for. I will be making this often!

I chopped half an onion and sauteed it before adding instead of adding a tablespoon of chopped onion. I also mixed the cheese in instead of adding it on top, and I used fat free sour cream. It was a hit at Thanksgiving!

This was delicious!  But, I need more onion!  i used a whole onion and I cooked it in some olive oil first.  It was delicious!!  I also used plain lowfat yogurt instead of sour cream, cuz that was all I had, AND I used half as much lowfat spread instead of butter to save fat and calories.  But did I mention it is delicious!!

These were incredible. My 10-year old actually ate and enjoyed spinach! The only things that I changed about the recipe were that I diced the onion instead of chopping and I chose not to use the cheese. The potatoes are great by themselves without the cheese, so why add the extra calories? This recipe is a keeper. The left-overs were great, too! Thank you so much for sharing this recipe. Another person had suggested leaving out the dillweed, but I think it should stay. The only changes that I will try in the future is to add either some crumbled bacon or shaved ham.

These turned out pretty good, though I am not sure I would make again since it took a bit long for an end result that was not anything too special. The only changes I made were using dried onion and not peeling the potatoes so maybe that made a difference.

Awesome bliss. Only personal adjustments were to delete the cheese (wanted a more "gourmet" appearance than gooey cheese would have offered) and added slices of four fresh basil leaves. Perfection; and requests for recipe from all in attendance! A definite keeper! Thanks for sharing.

This was awesome! What a great way to sneak some spinach into the kids dinner, you can see it but, hey it's mashed potatoes! I added garlic as the potatoes were boiling and mashed it all together. This also keeps well for leftovers.

Ironically, I put so much extra stuff in these potatoes that I forgot to put the spinach in, and they were still great!  And I usually don't like potatoes unless in the form of the chip or the tot.  I just find potatoes to be bland, flavorless, lowly tubers that need all kinds of arterial blocking condiment help to be edible.  Granted, these weren't good for you, but they were delicious.  I used three large baking potatoes, increased to 2 green onions, and crumbled bacon.  I boiled slices of garlic cloves with the potatoes and mashed them in.  These were delicious and next time I'll add the spinach!

This makes a great main dish for a vegetarian meal.  I didn't have any spinach so substituted chopped broccoli and it turned out excellent!

Delicious! My 1 and 3 year olds gobbled it up. I also added crumbled up cooked bacon. I will definitely be making this again.

To be fair, I didn't follow the recipe exactly as I was hoping to cut out some calories and my husband does not like sour cream.  I cut back on some cheese and used milk instead of sour cream.  I think next time I may cut back on the cheese but try to sneak in the sour cream.  I can see how that would make a big difference.

I made this for a friend's birthday dinner along w/ pork chops and it was a huge hit! I subbed nonfat, plain yogurt for the sour cream, and you'd never know it. Next time I'll crush some garlic into the potato mixture. It's also a great make-ahead dish. I prepared it in the morning, put the mixture in a casserloe dish w/ grated cheese on top and refrigerated. I used a sharp, white cheddar which made for a nice presentation-- more elegant than yellow cheddar. It took a little bit longer in the oven to cook, but was really easy. It's a keeper!

EXCELLENT recipe!! Made this with Easter dinner this year and added a little bit of garlic salt to the potatoes. My husband said, they were the best mashed potatoes that he has ever tasted. I may just have to agree with him on that!

Great recipe, I served for friends and they all enjoyed this dish.  My husband said he was a little doubtful at first, but wanted seconds and thirds!

You're right... very easy & delicious.  I used fresh spinach instead of frozen, cut the butter & chedder cheese & substituted yogurt for sour cream.  Very tasty!

I put in about a 1/2 cup carmilized onions and served it with chicken breast pierre(from this site) It was great! I'm not sure if it would be a 5 without the sauce from the chicken poured over.

used a little too much onion. but even the kids ate it, who normally wouldn't touch spinach. also be sure to cream the mashed potatoes before adding spinach, i had some chunks mashing didn't take out.

Wonderful! we were looking for something to do with the left over roasted rosemary and spinach potatoes ( a recipe also from this site). It was the same basic idea except mashed. It's super easy. I have to say i didn't follow exact measurements and since the potatoes from last night were baked, i just microwaved them with a little milk and butter, I mashed them and then followed the recipe. We're both lovers of mashed potatoes so I am thrilled to now have this recipe as part of our collection.
