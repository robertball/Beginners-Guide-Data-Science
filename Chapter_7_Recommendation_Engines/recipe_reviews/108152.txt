I made this for my husband who is diabetic and he loved it.  My kids and I love it too!  My only substitution was walnuts instead of pecans (since I had some already). It turned out moist and delicious both times I've made it!  It was done in 50 minutes instead of an hour. Great recipe!

This was a great recipe - You can use no sugar added applesauce to cut the sugar down even a little more. I also added a bit of nutmeg, cinamon & vanilla to mine. I have made it twice now and it came out great both times, the outside and ends can be a little rubbery but not bad but the inside is great. I also only used 3/4 cup of splenda rather than a full cup.

wonderful recipe!  I made this in an 8inch loaf pan and made 12 mini muffins to go with it.  I followed the recipe exactly - except I used walnut instead of pecans. Very moist.  Will definatly make again and again.  My husband who is diabetic loved this banana bread.

Made a few healthy substitutions and the bread still came out great.  I used egg substitute for real eggs, King Arthur white whole wheat flour 1.5 cups, 2 T ground flax seed, plus 1/2t cinnamon.  Used 1/4 cup chopped walnuts in half the mini loaves instead of pecans.  I baked them in 8 mini loaves for 20 minutes on 325.  Big hit with the kids and good on the waistline!

Bread came out very moist. I do keep a close eye out toward the end of the requested baking time just so it does not overbake and come out dry. I did not have buttermilk so I made sourmilk with 1/3 cup Fat free milk and a tablespoon of fresh lemon juice.

THIS TURNED OUT SO WONDERFUL - VERY MOIST - I USED WALNUTS INSTEAD OF PECANS - AND, NEXT TIME, I WILL NOT LET IT COOK AS LONG - MAYBE 50-55 INSTEAD OF AN HOUR.  IT IS A KEEPER!!!!

This recipe came out perfectly.  The only thing I changed was the baking time.  I baked for only 50 minutes.  Outside was golden brown and the inside was moist and flavorful.  I wish everything I baked with Splenda would come out this fabulous.

This was very good, although the applesauce sort of took away from the banana taste I think.  Also, one hour may have been a little long for my oven, because the outside of the bread was very rubbery and almost peeled off separate from the moist inside.  The inside was delicious and moist though!

Delicious! Had that great banana bread taste and smell. My kids loved it too.
