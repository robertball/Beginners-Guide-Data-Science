My family enjoyed this but not enough to gobble the entire salad up.  I still have some in the fridge.  My  guests did not go back for seconds.

I loved this simple recipe!  It is a sure fire hit at pot lucks.  One time I made it without the carrots and vingear and it still tasted GREAT.

Marshmallows? What marshmallows? I didn't see them in the directions. Should we just fold them in with the carrots and pineapple? At any rate, I made this salad w/o marshmallows and it turned out scrumptious. It's in the fridge chilling but I've been licking the spoon plenty of times!

This was fabulous.  I omitted the vinegar and added the pineapple and carrots before putting the salad in the fridge to set.  I also sprinkled the top with the marshmallows.
