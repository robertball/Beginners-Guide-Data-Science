Hi guys! I'm the submitter of this recipe and I just wanted to say how happy I am that this dish has brought back many wonderful memories for you. I stated that these were time consuming and I certainly wasn't kidding because I'm making them now as I'm writing. "Prairie Dixie", I give you so much credit for saying that you'll be making this every fall for the rest of your life. I haven't made my own recipe in several years and I now know why!! I am however, making 32 of them, so it's taking a bit of time. I just wanted to say that some of my raw "knoedels" were sticking to the plate and breaking open the dough, so I went back and used cooking spray on the plate. It helped a lot. I hope my Oma is looking down and smiling at me because I'm definitely looking up at her and appreciating all of her efforts and of course, love. Happy cooking gang!

Update: I combined this recipe with 'Peach Dumplings' on this site. I wasn't sure what farina was, so I just added more flour. Thanks so much, Linda, Caleb and I had such fun making this. It was messy but so worth it! (See posted pics). You're as sweet as a sugar cube ! (: Love you! ~Day~ Original review: This recipe is so awesome, and I was extremely pleased to see such a treasured heirloom recipe submitted here. My family used to make peach dumplings like this, but I thought the sugarcube in the center was such a nice touch! It added an extra sweetness to an already wonderful recipe! The best recipes in the world are the ones made with love and time, and this is definately one of those recipes. Thank you so much, Linda, for sharing this recipe!

Great!  My Austrian grandmother also makes these, and I'm glad mine turned out as well as hers.  I tried this recipe twice, once making the potatoe dough from scratch and then using store bought potato dumpling mix.  Both work great, but the store bought method is a lot faster :)

I am German and I usually get food like this fresh on the local fairgrounds. I am used to haven it served with a creamy vanilla sauce on top. This time I am too busy to go, so I though I'd try making them myself. This is a pretty good recipe. Advice from a Southern Germany where potatoe dumplings are a regular on a Sunday lunch table: the secret is the slow boil, rapid boil will make them fall apart. Thanks for the recipe and regards from the other side of the big pond :)

It's so nice to see family heirloom recipes posted. This one was fun to make & the sugar cube replacing the plum pit is just pure genius. Loved it, thanks so much for sharing:o)

Thank you Linda!!! My Grandmother used to make these when I was a little girl and our family recipe was lost years ago. As soon as I saw this I had to try them and am I ever glad I did. These are even better than my Grandma used to make, and make sure you make lots, I have already made 6 batches and am still getting requests for more. The only thing I changed is that we don't serve them with bread crumbs, I mix sour cream with sugar and spoon it over luke warm dumplings. I also used much more flour than called for to get the dough a consistency for rolling. Thanx so much for the recipe Linda I will be using it every fall for the rest of my life! I just wish plums were in season all year.

These are, as stated in the recipe, a bit time consuming but it is worth it! Good things do come to those who are willing to wait and trying out any new recipe, especially one that is traditional in another country... it will take some time and patience.....You'll love these if you try them! Thanks Linda for sharing your Oma's recipe!

I tried these and I absolutely loved them! I personally don't mind a recipe that takes a little time, especially if it's authentic, but maybe if you don't truly enjoy cooking, you may want to stick with some simpler recipes that require less cooking experience. Definitely worth the time and effort. Thank you Linda! It's a very special recipe and I know that I'll try it again!

In Austria you can now buy these in the frozen food section, but homemade is always best. I've made some very time consuming dishes, but this one tops the list both in terms of work and clean-up. The results, however, are well worth it because it brings back so many memories of our time in Austria. Some suggestions/changes: 1) Regular plums will not suffice for the Italian prune plums. If you can't find them, use apricots and make marillenknödel (i.e. apricot dumplings.) Because apricots are larger, just put half of an apricot into each dumpling so that it will cook properly. 2) I peel the potatoes first and cut into quarters to speed up the boiling time. 3) You need a potato ricer. If you just mash the potatoes, the consistency will not be correct. You can buy one for under $10 at places like Bed, Bath & Beyond. 4) Regular, plain breadcrumbs. Not seasoned. Not panko. 5) The recipe is sweet - kids love it - so we're not a big fan of the sugar cube in the middle. Instead, sprinkle  a little powdered sugar for the garnish.  6) Regarding farina, it is a wheat "cereal," so look for it in the oatmeal section and not the baking aisle with the flour. Some regular grocery stores carry it, but  a natural food store is a better bet. You can buy a box at Trader Joe's for $2.99 (although, the big question is what to cook with the rest!) This is a truly authentic recipe that turns out just as good as the original in Austria. Thank you!

So glad to see this recipe!  This is a family favorite that my Hungarian grandmother passed on to my mother and now to me.  The only additional step I add is a plum sauce poured over the top and brown sugar.  I just cook some of the left over plum halves with some water a sugar till the plums start alling apart.

These were so good.  They can be time consuming but so worth the wait.  So if your an inpatient cook these are not for you.  My da is a good very good cook but so is your oma.

Excellent recipe - and so easy for us beginners.  My husbands Oma made this for us all the time - and I have tried a few different recipes - but this just beats all.  Thanks.

So happy to have this recipe.  I grew up eating this and never tired of. iT It is amongst my favourites.  I made the recipe but never used the farina as my Mother and Grandmother never did.  It turned out very well and was well received by all.  Once again, thank you.

Awesome. Unfortunately at the time I wanted to try this, plums were out of season, so I improvised. I used cherries instead of plums and made lots and lots of little dumplings. I couldn't find sugar cubes at the store, so I replaced the cherry pits with red and purple skittles, which adds its own kind of flavor. So, SO good. The cherry-sized dumplings are perfectly bite-sized, too.

We just weren't very fond of these. They turned out to be too sweet, sickening really. Shame, because I do like dumplings and plums seperately, however the idea of combining them into a super recipe was a bit much. Thanks anyways though.

My gramma made these dumplings for us many years ago and then she handed down the recipe to my mom who made them every time prune plums were in season.For the first time last year I helped my mom make them and now plan on making them every year and will pass the tradition down to my daughters and make them for my grandkids.Thanks for the memories.

If you didn't grow up eating these or did not have a wonderful experience in Europe with this type of dumpling, it's not likely you will think these are anything special. I love to cook and I don't mind things that take time or special techniques, but there is still a "worth it" rating and these just do not live up. They were A LOT of work and A LOT of clean-up and they were bland. It's not something to make if you don't have a cultural connection to it. Make some apple dumplings or turnovers instead. They taste better and are much less hassle.

Really good flavor but it was way too time consuming overall. Had problems with the dough being tacky and must have added an additional 2 cups of flour. Perhaps it was from kneading so much flour into the dough, but the final product was like eating a very thick pasta and somewhat gummy after boiling it. I think a better option for plums would be to make a pie with a crumble topping and get a comparable dessert and much quicker to put together. I´m glad to have tried it though.

I'm so surprised to see a recipe here for "Gombocs" (the Hungarian name for them; we kids called them "gumballs"!   Brown the bread crumbs well for best flavor.  Our family likes these more on the second day, when we slice them and fry them in butter, like potatoes, then spoon the plum sauce over (or warmed currant or plum jelly).  UNBELIEVABLE!

I found your recipe just after we finished making a batch.  We do it exactly the same.  My grandmother was from Hungary and was a great cook.  She taught me.  The only thing I did differently was I made the bread crumbs from Pascha bread from yesterday.  This was my labor of love for my family. I am gluten intolerant and can't eat them.

I am german and very familiar with this dish. I have to say this one is GREAT! 
Maybe it is regional, but we top them with melted butter and a mixture of poppyseed cinnamon and powdered sugar. 
We also had them with the breadcrum butter topping, but it is only served like that when yellow plums are used.

My grandmother,aunt and mom all made these.  It took a lot of work since my mom always made a massive batch of them so my mom, the last survivor with the recipe, stopped making them as she got older.  I found her recipe book but the measurements and method weren't clear.  These were very good but my family's were better.  Perhaps it wasthat we used prunes, sweetened them and then boiled them.  It was more like a prune filling than a cooked plum.  Have to give this recipe a try with plums.  

BTW, we had a nickname for these in the family.  Jewish cannon balls. they were so good but you felt them in your belly afterward.  Enjoy all.

I found the dough to be extremely sticky and added pretty much another 2 cups of flour before I could roll it out.  I guess you could use a little at a time and not roll it out.  Then my  breadcrumbs really didn't stick well because my dumplings were cold before we ate them.  Also, any ideas for a garnish?? thanks Dan

I have made and eaten these many times and always enjoyed them.  These dumplings can also be made exactly the same way with ripe apricots.

Great recipe!  very similar to my Austrian grandmother's. I left the pit in and just added sugar at the table. that saves some prep time. also I made extra breadcrumbs because you can never have enough sweetened breadcrumbs!!!

I make these in large batches to freeze every year. When any of our children (all in their late 20's early 30's) spend the weekend...this is on the top of their wish list. I add a little cinnamon to the bread crumbs, butter and sugar coating. DELICIOUS!!

I'm honestly in tears, my Oma used to make this for me when I was little but she wouldn't give me the recipe! Thank you so much for posting this, I'll be making some for my roommates who are from China!

I learned how to make these from my husbands "Oma". She never wrote down the exact measurements of her ingredients so I came on allrecipes.com to try and find a plum dumpling recipe. I must say your recipe is a bit more delicious! Perfect...thanks for sharing!

I grew up with my German mother making plum dumplings. I could not find her recipe, so I tried this one.  My family loved them. Just like mom used to make. We don't use the sugar cubes in the plums to leave the plums a bit on the tart side. I did have to use a lot more flour to get rid of the tackiness of the dough. I used about 3 to 4 cups of flour total. We don't do the breadcrumb mixture at the end either. We do melted butter and powdered sugar on top. Thanks for the recipe.

I was so surprised to see this recipe here.  My Austrian Mother in law made these.  She also made the meat variety on the same day with mincemeat and served in/on sourkraut.   NOTE TO PREVIOUS POSTER ....My mother would take the knoedel after rolling in the crumbs..she would then toast the knoedel i the oven on very low for 15 mins or so.  I think the crumbs stuck.   Thanks for the recipe and the reminder of the love that was used to make this.

Wow. Just like my Austro-Croat Aunt. Fairly bullet proof. If anyone knows a trick to get the struesel to stick better, let me know. Best to get dark plums, slightly overripe and pruning.
