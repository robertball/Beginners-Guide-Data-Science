I brought this to a friend's birthday, and everyone loved it!  This is a wonderful recipe, but here are some suggestions for those of you who don't have a bread machine (like me) and would still like to make it.  First let the yeast proof in the water (make sure the water is warm, not hot or room temperature) and two tablespoons of the white sugar for about five minutes.  Meanwhile mix together all of the dry ingredients.  Stir it all together and let it rise until about double in size (took me about 45 min) and punch it down.  You can then follow the recipe as usual, beginning with step 2.  Also, I had lots of the brown sugar sauce left over, so I would suggest cutting it down if you don't want to throw it all away.  Will definitely make again!

This dish was outstanding.  After forming the balls, (I made them about the size of very large grapes), I dipped them in 1/2 lb. melted butter, then rolled them in finely chopped walnuts and then in dark brown sugar, then stacked them in a bundt pan.  I then sprinkled the remaining sugar and nuts on top, and poured the rest of the butter over all.  This seemed to coat each one better and made each piece come off the whole cake as one individual morsel.  My family of 4 polished it off in about 6 hours of nibbling.  This would be great to take to a potluck.

Honestly, I never knew what "Monkey Bread" was.  But now that my curiosity was piqued, I decided to look at several recipes on this site but over all, they all use store bought refrigerator biscuits which doesn't appeal to me in the least. I almost gave up, then I found this made from scratch recipe and I'm glad I tried it.  It's always a good thing to read the reviews and adapt the recipe to your liking;- however, I made very few changes. For the record, I added a dash of grated fresh nutmeg to the dough, 1 cup of walnuts, and 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla extract to the butter/sugar mixture AFTER removing it from the stove. One important tip when inverting the pan onto a plate is to be sure to place a cookie sheet under the pan to catch all the gooey sugar mixture or you'll have yourself quite a mess to clean up. Then because I avoided a kitchen disaster, I simply spooned the reserve sugar syrup that dripped onto the cookie sheet over the baked bread. Using my bread machine was a tremendous help and timesaver, too. Next time I might try using apple cider or juice instead of the water in the dough. This is divine with a cup of black tea or a cappucino. Wow!

OMG perfection.  I did do one change. Instead of dipping the balls of dough into the butter and rolling in sugar I melted the one cup of margarine, 1 cup br. sugar and 1 tsp of cinnamon in a saucepan over medium heat until all the sugar was dissolved.  I pour approx 1/3 c into the bottom of my greased bundt pan, added a layer of balls, poured another 1/3 c of sauce, rest of balls, and poured the remaining sauce over everything making sure the top layer of dough balls were coated.  covered with plastic wrap and let rise until doubled.  after baking for 25 mins and resting for 5, inverted onto plate.  used a spatula to make sure every square inch of the bread has sauce on it.  This way was so much easier and less messy!!

This is an excellent recipe!!  My family LOVES it!  I add chopped up pieces of apple sometimes or chopped pieces of pineapple in between the layers of the raw dough.  Then let it rise.  Gives it a different flavor!!  The pineapple gives it an Upside Down Pineapple Cake flavor!

I took this out of the oven at 9:00.  By 9:17 it was gone!  I made the dough and put it all together the night before, then refrigerated it overnight, taking it out of the fridge about an hour before baking the next morning.  This  worked great  and I didn't have to get up so early to have a yummy, fun breakfast for my husband and kids Thanksgiving morning. I only used 1/2 the butter/brown sugar syrup and everyone agreed it was still plenty sticky.   Great recipe, I will certainly use it again.

I had to grab an apron when dipping them into the butter/sugar mixture, because that's pretty darn messy.  I made the bubbles each a little too big, but my mom took one bite and told me that this was the best thing I'd ever made - far beyond her usual "less sugar.  More fat.  Could've cooked it longer.."  DELICIOUS!

I used my Kitchen Aid mixer for the dough part of this recipe. Instead of all water, I used part milk and I warmed it to the proper temperature so I could proof my yeast, as I do not have a bread machine. I proofed the yeast with the warm milk/water and sugar in my mixer bowl for ten minutes, then added the melted butter (I used butter instead of margerine) and the dry ingredients, leaving the raisins for last. This did need a little more flour to get it to form into a ball and jump on the hook. I kneaded the dough with the dough hook for about five minutes, then set it to rise in a greased bowl on a warm heating pad. After it doubled, I made the balls and dipped them in butter (again, I used butter instead of margerine) and sugar. (I added cinnamon and nutmeg to the brown sugar so they'd have just a little more flavor.) I made these into Monkey Bread Muffins (instead of one big monkey bread loaf) by placing three balls into every greased muffin tin, like I would Cloverleaf Rolls.  Once they were all done, I set it to rise on the heating pad again until they doubled. 375* for 14 minutes made for perfect Monkey Bread Rolls. This is a great weekend breakfast recipe. I plan on making a thin vanilla glaze to drizzle over the top in the morning. EDITED: These were inhaled. My boys loved them.

Who knew you could make monkey bread without canned biscuits, or with yeast bread for that matter?!  Wow, this was like a big, gooey cinnamon roll.  And knowing it was 100% homemade was even better!! Thank you sooooo much! :)

I never made monkey bread before but am now lovin' it!  So much easier than rolling out cinnamon buns!  I loved this recipe since it was not refrigerator biscuits based but one I could make myself easily in the bread machine.  I followed the recipe exactly, no changes but I did add vanilla extract powder to my dough.  I used my tube pan as my bundt pan is kinda small and I was worried about overflow.  In order to be mindful of other reviewers who had injury from the hot sugar oozing out the bottom, I wrapped the bottom of my pan in heavy gauge foil then set it in a roasting pan to prevent the foil from falling off when I removed it from the oven.  I let the bread cool completely before turning over and removing the foil.  Perfect.  No mess and no injury.  I have already made two more and have them in the freezer.  I lined my pan with parchment, loaded in the prepared dough and froze solid.  I then wrapped tightly with saran and foil.  When ready I will place back in the pan (without the freezer wrapping) and let rise in the fridge overnight.  Bake as usual in the morning for a nice-N-easy breakfast treat.

This is really great! The only changes I made was rolling the dough balls in a cinnamon sugar mixture before placing them in the pan..this makes them extra gooey! I also made a cream cheese frosting/glaze and put in an Ice cream glass, and placed it in the center of the bread for dipping(I heated it up in the microwave for a few seconds so it would dip easily)..I like doing it that way, because it gives people the option for the extra sweetness, plus it makes for an excellent presentation!

I used butter instead of margarine, and it tasted awesome! I will try with margarine too, just to see which flavor we prefer. So easy to make! I thought when the dough came out of the bread machine that surely this was not enough dough for a whole bundt pan--but sure enough, it filled that puppy right up! Great recipe, will definitely make again!

This is a really great recipe. I like it better than other recipes I've found because I prefer to make my own dough in the bread machine. I set my timer so that the dough would be ready in the morning and then finished off the recipe so that it would be ready for breakfast. The taste was very much like a creme brulee french toast recipe I've previously tried on this site, but this looks much more appealing. When we served it, instead of cutting it into slices, we used our forks to take off one little ball at a time. Make sure you keep the balls of dough small when you are making it, because it tastes much better that way. There was a perfect amount of sauce to coat the dough, I had exactly enough. I didn't use any raisins but instead used 1/2 cup of pecans. Very enjoyable, thanks.

This was a great recipe!  I made a couple changes though.  I used butter instead of margarine, I made the dough by hand, and I let the bread rise (after mixing and forming into a smooth ball) in a large oiled bowl for one hour. 

 TIP - To create a good environment for the bread to rise, preheat the oven to 200 F for 10 minutes, then turn off the oven. Put the bread in the oven and let rise for one hour.  

After putting the pieces of dough coated with cinnamon and sugar in the pan, let rise in the oven for another hour covered with clear plastic. 
 
I also found that using a springform pan works great because you can remove the sides easily.

Absolutely the best monkey bread recipe.  I took out the raisins, sprinkled the walnuts into the pan and kept my dough pieces small.  Don't be discouraged by the amount of dough in your pan after you prepare it, it rises right to the top.

Thank you so much for this recipe! My husband grew up on the refrigerator biscuit monkey bread but that just doesn't appeal to me. I'd rather have something homemade and this was perfect! One hundred times better than making it with frige biscuits. I think I maybe cooked the brown sugar butter mixture a bit too long, maybe not, but it has a nice caramel flavor, yum! I just put all of my dough chunks into the sauce pan with the brown sugar mixture, gently stirred to coat the chunks, and poured it into my 10' tube pan.  Wonderful results. I will use this recipe often!! Thanks again!

This is the only recipe I've tried and I am happy with it.  I didn't change any ingredients.  I didn't use a bread maker I followed some notes from another reviewer.  But I do have this to add.  If your butter/sugar mixture is grainly...microwave it a little more.  If it is separated...whisk it.  I did this by accident.  When I whisked it...everything came together in a caramel state and it was perfect!  So if you have trouble...there you go.

This tasted absolutely heavenly!  My only concern/question was about the kneading... mine got stiff after only three kneads.  I was afraid to go any further with it.

This was pretty good - but the sauce was more like caramel & It needs more cinnamon in it as well.  This took really long for me to cook but I think the oven I used needs to be fixed.

We found this recipe to be very good.  We added 1 tsp vanilla to the cup of water.  We also added a portion of nutmeg and vanilla to the butter/brown sugar mixture.  Overall, I think it gave some good flavor to an already good recipe.

I'd give these more than 5 stars if possible!  To easily coat the balls of dough, I drop a few at a time into the butter sugar mixture and scoop them out with a slotted spoon.  Very easy and hardly any mess!  And the cinnamon added to the dough makes it so much better than frozen bread dough!  I can't recommend these enough; I'll never use any other recipe.

This recipe is a good start and there are many different ways to make this. However the changes I made were similar to making Parker House Rolls - by using milk (not water) , 1 large beaten egg, and bread flour. I also added 2 tsp of almond extract, and tsp each of cinnamon and cardamom. I also used 1 stick of melted butter in the batter.
When the dough rose I melted the other stick of butter with the brown sugar, and added 1 tsp of ground ginger and 1 tsp of vanilla extract.
This bread is sticky sweet and hard to put down. 

I think the next time I make this I'll try it with rose water, grated orange peel and all the other ingredients used in baklava.

Perfect 5 stars with changes. I did butter for the margarine and milk for the water. I added a tsp of vanilla,1/4 tsp of nutmeg, and a little cloves in the dough.I put walnuts at the bottom of the pan and then layered the dough on top. I melted the butter,brown sugar, and some cinnamon in a bowl in the microwave.  I used a slotted spoon to dip the pieces in. It was fantastic. Will definitely make again.

The bread part of this recipe is very good; however, the glaze left a little something to be desired. It sort of separated and was gritty. You can also do the bread part by hand as I did: warm the water and add the white sugar until dissolved, then add yeast and allow to form a light foam (about 10 minutes) then add remaining flour. If you have a high-test mixer you can use the bread hook and it works well, if not you can do it by hand as well. After its all mixed turn it out on a floured surface and knead until smooth (about 10 minutes). Cover with a light dish towel and set it in a warm place to rise for an hour. Punch the dough down and knead about 1 minute, then let it sit for 15 minutes and continue with the recipe.

Very good recipe if you don't have frozen dough.  I added extra cinnamon and some vanilla.  I didn't have a bundt or tube pan so I used a loaf pan and it turned out great.  Also didn't have bread machine, but worked fine doing it by hand.  I rolled the dough into long rolls and then just cut them into bitesize pieces and put them in the pan with the liquid.  I used a spoon to get the rolls out and into the pan.  Kept the stickiness and messiness down.  Also put foil on the cookie pan under the loaf pan for very easy cleanup!  Great and easy recipe!

My husband ate the entire Bundt pan full in about 3 days....the small taste that I had told me why.  This stuff is fabulous, and I agree with all the people who didn't want to use store bought biscuits, make this from scratch.  Next time I will be sure to put the cake pan underneath when I invert the pan, I don't want to clean up that gooey mess again!

First, I want to say THANK YOU to the person who wrote how to make this bread if you don't have a bread machine!  Even by hand, the dough was very, very quick and easy to make.  I decided to not make a sweet monkey bread and instead only used about 1/8 a cup of sugar, more salt, and garlic powder in the dough.  I used the dipping stuff from the garlic monkey bread on this site.  It was quite good and looked nice, too!!  Next time I'll make the sweet version.

Awesome! My first time making it, tasted as good as it looked. My husband ate so much of it I thought he was going to turn into a monkey! I added pecan halves, other than that everything else was the same. Thank you soo much for this one!

This was my first time making monkey bread and it was much easier than I thought it'd be.  I used 2 cups of whole wheat flour and 1 cup of white to make it a little healthier.  I also used half the amount of butter and sugar and still had enough.  Next time I will dip the bits in butter and then roll in the sugar though as I think that will more evenly spread the sugar throughout it.

Wow, yum! This is definitely the best monkey bread I've had. I've tried another recipe on this site that used refrigerator biscuits, it was good, but this is better. The texture is great. I rolled the balls in cinnamon sugar and then dipped them, and poured the rest of the brown sugar/butter mixture on top. It held together well and looked very nice. Thanks for the recipe!

This was awesome. I added 2 more teaspoons of cinnamon to the sugar/butter mixture before adding the pieces of dough and it tastes just like cinnamon buns. This was almost as easy as monkey bread made with those canned biscuits, but I'm very glad to avoid using anything pre-made, and it was still quite easy. The flavor is different from biscuits, but I think it tastes fresher, and is just as, if not more, versatile.

This recipe is FANTASTIC!!  Everyone and I mean EVERYONE wanted this recipe when I made it, SOOO GOOD.  The only changes I made was adding some nutmeg and leaving out the raisins.  Adding nutmeg just makes it that much better!  I love this recipe because its made from scratch and it doesn't use already made biscuit dough.  You should try this recipe, everyone will love it!

This monkey bread was eaten up quickly by my family. They wanted me to make it every weekend! I followed the recipe as it is and all went well, but I would suggest using less than 1 cup of margarine in the brown sugar mixture.  Maybe even 1/2 cup. The margarine seemed to float on top of the brown sugar mixture and I had to keep mixing it so that the ball I put in would get covered by the brown sugar too. Besides that, it turned out great and I was pleased with it.

I made this without a bread machine. I proofed the yeast first and then I used my hand mixer with the dough hooks to complete  the mixing. I also had extra brown sugar sauce but I poured the remaining back into the bundt pan and then flipped it over. I also drizzled the top with cream cheese frosting--I didn't use too much because it was just a drizzle, I used 4 oz cream cheese to 1 cup confectioner's sugar and 1 teaspoon vanilla. This monkey bread was so moist and delicious--like it was made professionally. My daughter requested it for a birthday cake. 5 stars, this is definitely a recipe we will make again.

VERY GOOD RECIPE.  I TOOK THIS TO WORK & AFTER TRYING IT, 2 PEOPLE WENT OUT & GOT THEIR OWN BREAD MACHINES!!  YOU SHOULD GET SOME OF THE PROFITS  :)  ANYWAYS, THE ONLY THING I DID DIFFERENT WAS ADD A LITTLE SUGAR TO THE DOUGH (I TEND TO USE TOO MUCH FLOUR WHEN I ROLL STUFF OUT & I DIDN'T WANT TO LOSE SWEETNES) AND I ALSO ADDED SOME CINNAMON TO THE DIP.  VERY EASY RECIPE, WELL WORTH THE TIME.

This is the absolute best!!!!  Everyone who tries it wants the recipe.  It tastes like my mom's homemade caramel rolls.  I really like that you use the bread machine and make your own dough instead of using refrig rolls or whatever.  I get a little intimidated when anything calls for me making my own dough, but this is foolproof!!

This was the first time I made monkey bread - but it won't be my last!  I did add some walnuts in between the dough in the pan.  Next time I'd like to try rolling the balls in melted butter and then sprinkling them with a sugar/cinnamon mixture.  I think someone else already mentioned doing that.  I do recommend you put it in the oven before the dough rises above the top of the bundt pan .  I left mine rise to just less than the top of the pan and within 5 minutes in the oven it was oozing all over the outside of the pan and the bottom of my oven!  Thanks for a great recipe!

The flavor was good. However the dough was too loose and I had to add about 1/2 more of flour. I didn't care for the process of dipping the dough balls in hot sugar and butter mixture. Almost burned my fingers.

wonderful recipe, cannot get enough stars for easyness, quickness, gooeyness... we had company for dinner and I set the bread machine timer to have it ready by the time I came home; 10 minutes to dip the little dough balls in butter/sugar mixture (yes, a trifle too much, you can cut the amount or drizzle it on the finished product before baking). I skipped the raisins and nuts, but made it pretty with candied cherries and popped it into the oven: ready in 20 minutes, just about the time to put the finishing touches to the dinner and serve it. Then it went on the table nicely warm; ok, there is the hot and messy sauce issue, so you need to be careful when you put it upside down, but all in all it was a smash!

I'm 42 and I just now found monkey bread...all those wasted years :)   This was yummy.  I added 1/2 tsp nutmeg to the bread machine ingredients and 1/4 cup walnuts to the brown sugar mixture and it turned out fantastic.  Can't wait to try again.

These are yum! Don't think I can make too often...I ate way too much. My kids didn't even get enough, so they tell me. ;) Thanks for a great recipe...I wanted one that wouldn't use store bought biscuits and this one's a keeper! Did omit the raisins for personal preference.

Outstanding! Instead of using the bread maker, I followed the order of the San Franciso Sourdough recipe on this site (using the monkey bread measurements of course). After reading the reviews about too much butter, I layered the bundt pan with the butter mixture first (about 1/4 cup) and then topped with walnuts. Then, I dipped each piece as  suggested and baked for 20 minutes at 375. I then turned the oven off but left the pan inside to cook for an additional five minutes (I like soft bread but not goo-ey). Absolutely superb! best to make for a large group because it is amazing served warm (re-heating just won't do). Can't wait to make again!

Love this! I did make a few changes, I cut the brown sugar in half cause my family doesn't like a lot of sweetness and I added walnuts. It made the monkey bread taste like my family's Holiday Braid without all the work of making our holiday braid.

I have just tried this recipe and it turned out very!!! yummy. I followed other reviewers suggestions and used only the half ammount of the sugar and butter. Next time I will try to use even less butter 'cause I still had some left. But I guess if you want it gooey you should follow the recipe. For me and hubby would be way too sweet and fat. It's very feeling with the reduced ammount of butter, anyway! I also omitted the raisins. Just made the little balls and dunk them in melted butter and rolled them in cinammon-sugar mix. Very good! Very exotic looking as well (for Germany at least :). Impressive. I will take one of this to our next coffee gathering in the office. Thanks for posting!

This is a fantastic recipe. The only thing that I disliked the first time I made it was ow much waste there was from the brown sugar, butter mixture. I'd cut it in 1/2 next time.

I'm going to try this again - but as far as using a tube pan - no way. All of the "good stuff" dripped out, burnt in the oven and we were left with a (really good!) loaf of cinnamon bread. The recipe needs to clarify this is meant for bundt pan only - every tube pan I or anyone I asked has seen is a two-piece and the amount of time the dough needs to rise gives the warm sugar butter enough time to run out - then the remaining eeked out in the oven! Eh. But I will try again and repost - the cinnamon bread part was good.

This was so easy to make in my new bread machine. My 4 year old helped make the balls and dip them. So much fun. I will not add the raisins next time as they did not go well with the recipe. After this cooled a bit, I flipped it onto a rounded platter. It was beautiful. Everyone loved this.

I just made this, and it is delicious. I think the next time around I will try mixing the raisins in with the dough rather than putting them into the butter sugar mixture.

Was yummy but I took the advice of other reviewers putting it on a cookie sheet so the drippings didn't go everywhere.... Well when I went to move it to a plate for serving it fell apart. This was devastating! Next time I'll flip it onto a plate and take my chances with drippings rather then bits everywhere.

Decent basic recipe.  I used my metal bench scraper to cut the dough quickly into little pieces. To streamline the coating process, I poured the slightly cooled butter mixture in a plastic bag and tossed the dough pieces in to coat, then took them all out at placed them into the pan at the same time.  I had way too much butter mixture, so I made a second batch of dough and had plenty of butter mixture for the second loaf, which will go into the freezer. Even so, I still had at least 1/2 cup of the butter mixture left.  I'm not big on wasting expensive ingredients like butter, so I will make less next time, or maybe find another recipe.  (I added nutmeg and vanilla to the first bread, and instant chai mix to the second.)

My husband woke up New Years Eve "dreaming" of Monkey Bread.  I wasn't about to make it from canned biscuts.  I ONLY make yeast bread/dough in a machine so this was perfict.  They turned out so great that I made a second batch right away to use up the extra sauce.....I guess I'll take it to my neighbor or just eat it too!

Good stuff!  I managed to make a complete mess and questioned everything I did and it still came out ok.  First of all, the dough was very sticky when it came out of the bread maker and I wasn't sure if that's how it was supposed to be.  I had to add a little flour just to knead it.  The butter/brown sugar mixture doesn't mix very well as the butter seems to settle on top...let it cool just a bit and stir it well to get it incorporated.  It makes a lot of syrup and you have a lot left over.  I just poured it over the top when I was done placing the dough because I wasn't sure what to do with it and I was sure I was just making a mess.  Most of the syrup sinks down to the bottom anyway and when you cook it it carmelizes.  Make your little blobs small because they rise to medium size pieces.  It's easy now that I know what I'm doing.  I love the fact that the dough is made in the bread machine!

This is delicious! And very easy to follow. It is pretty messy, but if you use wax paper and don't mind getting your hands sticky temporarily it's not a problem. Definitely place the bundt pan on a cookie sheet to prevent oven overflow mess. I skipped the nuts and raisins (picky eaters) and it's still very tasty. Highly recommended!

This came out great! I had left over brown sugar/butter mixture and didn't add it to the pan. I will nest time because it wasn't gooey enough for me. Will make again.

Good job, Darren, Debbie and Joshua! I set the timer on my bread machine so that the dough would be ready when I woke up. All I had to do was prepare the finishing touches and bake. WOW! These were absolutely the best. My family enjoyed waking up to the aroma and starting their day with such a lovely treat.Thanks for sharing.

Great recipe. I've made it twice. Once I dipped all the chunks in the caramel mixture and once I put them in the pan and poured sauce over. It looks nicer and holds up better with pouring the sauce, but it's not nearly as yummy as when you dip each piece first. Also, put down foil in the oven. It expanded a lot in the oven and a few pieces broke loose and landed stickily on the oven floor. Love it. Real crowd pleaser.

I made this today.  My bf wanted them for breakfast Sunday for Thanksgiving. . I tried the recipe.  He loves them.  I think they are ok.  I don't have a bread maker so I followed the advice of another  commenter.  The bread texture itself was phenomenal.  Light airy and a great crust.  I personally found the sauce to be lacking in flavor but my bf and his coworkers loved it.  Note : it took about 30 min for dough to rise in pan.  Still a good recipe however

You made this way too complicated.  First, I let the dough rise for awhile to get some more "yeasty" flavor in a buttered bowl.  Then cut up the dough into pieces and put back into the bowl.  Add some raisins and walnut pieces and shake it up, then pour the butter/brown sugar mixture on top and stir.  Pour the whole mess into a pan and bake!

I am very happy to have found this recipe!  I make monkey bread often and have always been lazy and have just used the tube of biscuit dough from the grocery store.  Believe it or not my husband and I recently moved to a country that does not have tubes of dough!  I searched for dough  recipes using a bread machine and came across this recipe.  I love it!  It is tasty, easy to make, and takes no more effort than cracking open a tube of dough!   Thank you for sharing.  Someone in Afghanistan is now making monkey bread...

Made 6 servings in a 6 servings XL muffin tin. Added finely chopped pecans and used whey instead of water. I don't have a bread machine so the directions were lost to me. I suggest 2 risings, which I think the directions call for if you had a bread machine. With 1 rising, the bread felt denser than normal.

This recipe was delicious, the kids devoured the whole thing in under 10 minutes! Next time I'm going to add more cinnamon and vanilla to the sauce.

we added a sprinkling of cinnamon and brown sugar to the bottom and sides of the greased bunt pan which added a little extra delicious gooey topping when done! awesome!

It may be messy but here's what I say....a messy baker is a happy baker....a messy kitchen is a happy kitchen....it was delicious and easy to clean...just soak everything in hot water right after you use it.....don't let the butter/brown sugar mixture sit in the pan after you've used it all.....cause it crystallizes on to the pot.....I speak from experience!!!!

Made dough and sauce the day before. The next morning I took them out of the fridge and let them rise for about 45 min. and then cooked them as directed. I made them in a round cake pan. They were wonderful.

Wow is this good!  And the house smells amazing! We did not include nuts as we are usually not nut people with deserts. However, once munching on it, I could see where they would have been good.  Wonderful flavor!  Great using the bread machine to help with the work.  I love the biscuits in a tube for some things, but this is much better. Made it exactly as described but added a pinch of cinnamon to the butter sauce.

I wanted to like this, I really did, but I just couldn't. I found the sauce to be the major problem- the recipe makes too much, and with so much butter it ends up far too rich and cloyingly sweet. Not wanting to waste any, I poured some directly into the pan both before and after dunking all the dough balls. While it makes for a beautiful presentation, there's just so much it's overpowering. Also, the bread the recipe makes seems to be too delicate to stand up to such a heavy sauce. I'm sorry but I will not be using this recipe again.

This was very good. I usually make monkey bread with biscuits, and was looking to try a recipe from scratch.  This was pretty close to perfect!  

I used milk instead of water in the dough.  And butter instead of margarine (personal preference).  Like others, I only used half of the butter/sugar mixture.  Now, that made for some less gooey peices, but that's fine with me.  YMMV.  Also added some cinnamon to the butter/sugar.  Will definitely be making this one again!

This was excellent. I made it just like the recipe but added flaked almonds in as well for an extra crunch. So yummy. Had it for a morning scrapbook session and it went down so well that anything left over was packed into bags for my ladies to take home for their kids.  Not good for the waist line but so good for the soul.

I tried many from-scratch monkey bread recipes and this is the best and least complicated dough. I made a couple of alterations though. I noticed that the bits on top have most of that wonderful gooey sauce and at the bottom the bread is rather dry so I made  this glaze: 1 tb sp butter, half a cup of powdered sugar, 2 tb spoons milk and a pinch of cinnamon. Mix and bring to the boil on the stove and drizzle it on the bread focusing on the bottom bits. I also used half a cup of butter and a cup and half of brown sugar. I melted the butter, dipped the bread pieces in it and rolled them in the sugar. I didn't add cinnamon to the dough. I added it to the sugar as I read somewhere that cinnamon can kill the yeast or make it less active.

I wish I could give this 4.5 stars.  I can't believe I'm saying this, but -- there was just too much butter.  Also, the texture was a little off in my opionion.  I wonder if I would like it better made with bread flour instead of all-purpose.  However, much better than monkey bread made with canned biscuits!

Very good recipe. I wasn't able to use my oven so I had to use my large toaster oven. The bread came out delicious. I baked two small baking dishes (one at a time) at 350 degrees for 20 minutes.

I've never had or made monkey bread before...but i thought this was just fantastic. I made it without the bread machine - I let the yeast sit in the 1 C of water..I used lukewarm water to help the yeast activate. Then i mixed in the rest of the ingredients.  After all were mixed, I switched to the knead hook and let it knead about 3 minutes. I recommend only using 1/2 C margarine or butter. i ended up pouring about 1/2 of the butter off the top before putting in the chunks dough, and it was still quite decadent.  I don't have a bundt pan so I used a 9" round cake pan, and the sauce overflowed a little when the dough started expanding in the oven, but the monkey bread came out fine and was entirely cooked through.

Delicious recipe and extremely easy to make. I used butter instead of margarine and it worked perfectly. However, I'd recommend decreasing the amount of butter in the sauce/topping to about 1/2 cup-3/4 cup. I had the same problem as a few other reviewers with being unable to properly mix the sugar into the butter. The butter kept on separating from the sugar sauce so that there was a film of clear butter on top of the sauce.

Super!! I've been a fan of Monkey Bread for ages, and had always used refrigerated biscuit dough or frozen roll dough. Never again!  I had to search this out one night when my honey had a commitment to bring this to work for a Holiday Brunch,  and I had neither of the above on hand. This was SOOOOO good, it beat both other versions hands down,  and now I can't go back!  Thanks DD&J !

Great!!!It has been the only receipe I could use with slight changes to meet the allergy restrictions (peanuts, tree nuts, dairy, eggs) for a class party.  All store refrigerator biscuits have one of the above allergians.  It tastes better than Monkey Bread made with refrigerator biscuits and simple since the bread machine does most of the work.  Thanks again!!!!

I cheated and used Bridgeford frozen dinner rolls, cut into 1/4s.  'Hard to judge the results given that departure, but the family enjoyed them.  I used crannies, rather than raisins and if I did so again, I'd soak them first in o.j. to soften them a bit.

I didn't have a tube pan so I baked in a bread pan and it came out tasty but it didn't stick together.  I also used whole wheat flour (king arthur).  My little monkeys loved this recipie!

My Mom used to make Monkey Bread and I loved it but couldn't find the recipe of hers. This is by far the BEST monkey bread I've had since Moms. Actually I think I like this one better.. but of course I would never tell MOM!

This is such an easy recipe.  I was so happy to find a recipe that didn't use refrigerated biscuit dough.  I used my bread machine on the dough setting which is such a time-saver!  I used butter instead of margarine & the sauce was so sticky, so gooey, just so yummy.  To save from making too much of a mess I used a soup spoon to move the balls of dough around in the brown sugar sauce & to scoop them into the bundt cake pan.  My fingers never touched the sauce!  Next time I will experiment with different fruit and nut flavors!  It's apple season, so I'll be making an apple monkey bread w/ apple cider and extra cinnamon!

OMG! This was sooo good.  I never had Monkey Bread before, still not sure why it's called that, but I made it yesterday for one of my big baking days.  It's gone today.  I didn't add raisins or nuts (my family didn't want them) and I only used one stick of butter in the "dip" (one stick equals half a cup) and that was plenty.  And I used real butter, not fake margarine, but other than that, I followed the recipe.  It hits that spot when I want something soft and gooey.  Will DEFINITELY be making this again!

I used half the butter/brown sugar mixture and it seemed to be just the right amount. It got rave reviews!

Amazing recipe, only one I found with an actual yeast dough, all the other monkey bread recipes use biscuit dough which is unappealing to me! I like to add a teaspoon of vanilla and dash of cinnamon to the butter/sugar mixture! Really fun to make and eat!

Yummy yummy! It was super easy and so rich and tasty! And you can't beat homemade dough vs. store bought. I added vanilla per other suggestions, and added extra cinnamon both in the dough and in the sauce. Definitey a keeper!

When I was lloking for a "Monkey Bread" recipe, I was dismayed to discover that most use a premade bread product of some kind. This one is from scratch, but offers the convenience of the bread machine. The result was fantastic. My house smelled wonderful too. I have stored this recipe away to use again and again.

This was so good and very addictive. The bread part was surprisingly light and airy. I didn't use a bread machine to make my dough. I added pecans to mine instead of the raisins but it would have been just as good with both.

Yum,yum,yum!!!  I made this today and it is awesome.  I too was looking for a monkey bread recipe that didn't use refridgerated biscuits dough.  I took others advice and added some vanilla to the butter/sugar mixture and it was perfect!  I used real butter instead of margarine but those are the only changes I made. It did make a terrible mess in my oven, it bubbled over, but it was so good I didn't even mind. This one is a definite keeper.  Thanks for sharing!!

I loved this recipe and so did my fiance and his friend who I made it for at the spur of the moment one morning. I dont really care for raisins so I didnt add any but I would probably do it every once in a while, I think the only thing I would change is adding a bit of vanilla extract or bean to the bread dough as well as a small bit to the sauce mixture, maybe even a bit of nutmeg during the winter time. 

Since bread isnt my strong point I was happily suprised when it came out just right, excellent bread recipe as well!

After trying the "use refrigerated dough" recipes on this site with less than spectacualr results, I was about ready to give up on Monkey Bread. I decided to try this one last recipe, and was pleasantly surprised. It was a little bit more work and mess than refrigerator dough recipes (I don't have a bread machine), but it was worth it.

This was okay.  I probably wouldn't give it 3 stars, but my little 4 year old loved it.  Probably because she thought it has real monkeys in it and that is "cool".  I thought it was okay and so did my hubby.  My 6 year old took 1 bite and said he hated it, and he is anything but a picky eater.

We LOVED this recipe.  I didn't put the raisins in, but otherwise followed the recipe to the letter.  I had leftover sauce, so I just poured it on top before baking it.  I also took the advice to drop a few globs of dough into the mixture, then fish them out with a slotted spoon.  Worked out very well.  It disappeared quickly and was a huge hit!

I made these the conventional way and they turned out wonderful.  I did have too much butter and sugar mixture left over so I poured most over the top before I baked them.  Yummy!!

Very good! I made the dough by hand (no bread maker) and let it rise an hour initially, then 20 min after putting it together.

It was rather cumbersome to get the sugar/butter mixture over the dough (mixture was hot and very sticky)... I ended up dumping all the cut dough pieces into the sugar mixture, mixing, then using a spoon to kinda pry them back apart and put them in the pan. The pieces were probably larger than they should have been, but it came out great! 

I've decided that I like this more than cinnamon rolls. Much easier and not nearly as dry as some rolls come out.

This tasted great! I made a sweet dough in my bread maker instead of frozen dough. The kids thought it didn't look to good,(not very pretty) but after one taste, it kept everyone coming back for more!  I didn't change anything except I only had sugar-free butterscotch pudding and it worked just fine. Thanks.

I really liked the cinnamon dough, but the butter/brown sugar mixtures was a complete disaster.  It was much too watery and made a mess dripping as I put each ball in the pan. Also, I used a angel cake pan instead of a bundt pan (my fault), so the liquid made a huge mess in my oven.  The final product tasted great, but was way too sticky -- even for monkey bread.  Maybe I'm just bitter because of the mess in my oven.  I'll wait a few weeks and try again.

We love gooey sweet things around here and while this was both of those things it did not have the best flavor. It was easy in preparation using the bread machine..but the carmelly taste you get from the buttersugar mixture is overpowering. I think these would be better dipped in plain melted butter then a white sugarcinnamon mixture then baked. Also did not keep past one day so keep in mind.

I was REALLY looking forward to some good monkey bread and unfortunately, this wasn't it.  It lacked the good flavor I remember from the monkey bread I used to eat growing up.  My husband had never had monkey bread before and also didn't care for it.  I'm going to try a recipe that uses butterscotch pudding next time since my Mom told me that our neighbor uses the pudding mix in hers - and she makes the BEST monkey bread!

Very Good.  I used hand made method w/o bread machine.  No raisins or nuts but was delicious.  I agree the caramel mixture makes ALOT!  You could get by making 1/2-3/4 what the recipe calls for.   Very good and easy recipe!

Good recipe. One of the reviews said that it would spill over in the oven, so I put a baking sheet under it which caused it to not cook well on the bottom. It didn't spill over at all either. Follow the recipe!

I made it exactly following the recipe just added a teaspoon of cinnamon to the butter/brown sugar mix. It was a huge hit at Christmas dinner I am definitely adding this to my favorites. It’s easy and quick to make and the caramel sauce when it’s warm is delicious. I also made a cream cheese icing to top it.

This came out absolutely unbelievably delicious! I followed the recipe to a T, didn't change a thing. I'm not sure how everyone else is ending up with too much sauce though. I almost didnt have enough!

I made this recipe exactly as the recipe called for and it was amazing! My husband is constantly asking me to make it again! I made the dough the night before and refrigerated it, then took it out in the morning about a half hour before baking it- makes for a much quicker and easier Sunday breakfast!

Perfect soft dough, great rise. Didn't use raisins or nuts. Left in bread machine extra  20 minutes. Did not knead by hand.

Made it according to directions using my bread machine. Came out perfectly. I did add a 1/4 dark rum to the brown sugar/margarine caramel sauce. Delicious!

WOW best Monkey Bread I've had. I used the bread machine on dough setting as suggested. I used a non-stick bundt pan, no grease needed. I added dry-toasted chopped pecans, and diced apples. And I added this caramel sauce recipe: 1 stick butter - melt in saucepan. Add 1 cup packed dark brown sugar, and 3 TBS heavy whipping cream. Wisk and simmer till sugar melts and it mixes together. Pour half into dough before going into the oven. Reserve the rest for drizzling as you serve! ~ Laura in CA

I liked the concept but there was too much butter, 1 cup was too much and I took some out  before dipping the dough in it.  I think the whole thing was overly sweet, and we like sweet, but this was too much.  If I make it again I will tweak the recipe for less butter and sugar. One mistake I did make was I overcooked the butter and sugar and it didn't stick very good to the dough.

Great recipe. Fun to make. Couldn’t find my bundt pan; used my angel food cake pan instead. BIG mistake, butter and sugar leaked out and burned on the oven floor. Won’t make it again without a bundt pan.

Instead of melting butter and sugar and raisins for a sauce I rolled the dough into balls, then dipped them into butter and cinnamon sugar, alternately. I think maybe my sugar was too coarse, so next time I'd use a finer grain. The dough was good but it was a bit too sweet after adding cinnamon sugar and a bit of extra sauce.

The bread was fine but had a weird after-taste. it almost tasted like chemicals, but that's not the main reason why I rated this so low. As I was flipping the bread over onto the plate, right out of the oven, a bunch of the syrup came out and hit my leg. I ended up in Children's hospital urgent care with a second and slight third degree burn all down my thigh. If anyone plans on making this maybe let it  cool for 15-20 minutes before you flip it. Having to go to the hospital is not worth "just out of the oven" bread.

My family loved this, even my non-sweets eating husband. I halved the recipe (sans raisins)  and used a loaf pan (because I don't own a bundt pan), cooked as directed and it still turned out perfectly. I also did the last rise in the fridge overnight and took it out in the morning 30 min prior to baking so it would be ready asap for breakfast.  I'm only giving four stars because it's annoying the recipe was written for bread machines... recipes should not be written for specialized and superfluous gadgets in my opinion. 
However, I'm really happy to have found a recipe that is an actual recipe and doesn't call for pre-packaged ingredients (pastry dough), and I really quite liked the very slightly cinnamony flavor of the dough. 
The only real change I made was pouring the melted sauce in the pan instead of dipping one by one...I tried the dipping and the sauce didn't seem to want to stick to the dough balls, but many of the other monkey bread recipes do pouring instead of dipping so I tried that and just allowed the excess to run off when flipped after it was done baking and it worked great. Much easier and less messy too, again, hence the four stars.

Great recipe.  I kept everything the same but used a pudding  mold without the lid to give it a tower effect. I didn't pour any of the sauce on until I had filled my pudding mold halfway ( don't fill it to the top because the bread rises right over the mold in the oven.  I made 2 towers and gave one to my neighbors who ate  every drop in one sitting . Also a total hit with my husband and kid!! Definitely a keeper.

I made one for my hubby and another one the next day for my Physical Therapists to say thank you.  They both went over GREAT.  Got comments like:  best I've ever had, I'll just take this with me back to my office, or WOW, Thanks.  Both of them were BIG hits!!

The first attempt I used my bundt pan which turned out to be too shallow, so the dough spilled over the sides a bit....not good presentation, but tasted good.  Also the sugar/butter glaze was too runny.  The next time I made it I stirred the butter/sugar glaze till melted then boiled it for a minute ; also used my angel food cake pan and it was MUCH more presentable and delicious!  I will make it again with pecans and glazed cherries and boil the glaze for 11/2 -2 minutes.

Very good but did as one other suggested.  1/3 butter mixture poured into bottom of bunt pan, layer of dough mixture, pour more butter mixture, rest of dough (rolled into grape size balls) and rest of butter mixture.  No mess at all.  We all agreed it had a funny taste.  Will try this with my cinnamon roll dough recipe.

Way too hot!  The top of my monkey bread burned within 12 minutes.  Should probably be around 325.  Also, like another reviewer said, to much cinnamon mixture. Otherwise the bread was tasty.

I wanted to make monkey bread in the morning. To prevent separation issues like some noted, I melted the butter and sugar together and boiled for a good 3-4 minutes, whisking constantly, for it to come together like a caramel sauce. I stuck the pan in the fridge  to cool down fast. Once the temp cooled to 115F (safe for the yeast), I just rolled the dough balls (made the night before btw) in the sauce. Since many reviewers said they had lots of extra sauce leftover using the original recipe's dough, I upped the dough by 50%. As a result, I ended up using ALL the sauce but I prefer a more saucy monkey bread. Next time, I will make a tad more caramel to drizzle IN BETWEEN each dough layer.  Thank you for the recipe!

Requested repeatedly after I made it.  I use my bread machine for the dough and throw my raisons or dates into the dough so they are beaten into the dough and you get the flavour without the texture. My family does not love cooked raisons. I make my sauce with double the butter and double the brown sugar and I put a splash of vanilla and corn syrup.  Sometimes I'll put maple syrup in too. I coat each piece and pour the rest over the top before baking.  Great dessert to bring to group events.

I love this recipe! There's nothing id change! You can always use more or omit the raisins! I also pour the remaining brown sugar mixture over the top before I bake it, to make it extra gooey! Perfect for people to have a sweet treat, but only what they want to take. Love it!

I used chopped pecans instead of raisins.  I also added a handful of pecans to the bottom of the bundt pan.  It baked beautiful and the taste was amazingly perfect.

I use my break maker for the dough and love to switch it up by putting different things besides raisins (always measure out to a cup). Sometimes I use chocolate chips or add nuts. Definitely a hit and people are always impressed!

Because I was unable to use my bread machine to make my dough I did not realize that the dough setting on it let it rise for 58 minutes.  I will definitely try this recipe again and let the dough rise for 58 minutes before making the balls.  It was good just way more dense than expected but of course that was due to the lack of rising time!  I will also take out the raisins as the rest of my family did not like them. (I thought they were great but I must please the masses!) This recipe mixed up well in my kitchen aid mixer using a dough hook.  After checking the cycle for my dough setting on my bread machine I know it needs to mix for 24 minutes then "rest"/rise for another 58 minutes.  Just in case anyone else wants to try it without the bread machine.

Great recipe!!  Turned out awesome, although I had to move it in the oven mid bake bc the top was too close to the top of the oven...  I did sub in whole wheat flour for white so needed almost a 1/4 cup more water than the recipe called for.  I also added an extra tsp of cinnamon to the bread and a 1/2tsp to the glaze.  I also put a cookie sheet on the bottom rack to catch all the dribbles.

I think it should be called Pig a Bread cause that's what we made of ourselves eating it. So good! I used raisins and pecans. I'll definitely make this again - maybe Xmas morning.

I used this recipe as a guideline to utilize some left over bread dough. I grind my own wheat, so I did it manually as opposed to a bread machine, which I don't own. Once my dough was ready, I simply cut into squares and rolled into balls, dipped them in the butter mixture made with chopped pecans (no raisins... yuk!), sprinkled a raw sugar and cinnamon mixture on top, and baked In a glass pie pan.  Absolutely delicious!!!  I highly recommend this recipe! It wasn't that messy at all and would be hard to mess up. So many variations can be used! Enjoy!

This is the best monkey bread I have ever had!  I love throwing the ingredients into my bread machine and having great dough to work with later.  Coating each piece with the delicious butter and brown sugar mixture ensures that every piece is to die for.  I make this for my own family often as well as giving it to family and friends.  It is a hit everywhere it goes!

Made this with the bread machine, but the dough came out too sticky.  I added more flour while I kneaded it and it could have probably used 1/4 cup to 1/2 cup more flour.  I halved the butter and brown sugar as suggested by other reviewers, which was just enough to coat all the dough balls.  The glaze came out nice & gooey, but the dough was too light & airy for my taste.  I prefer a chewier texture.  Next time I will use the dough from "Clone of a Cinnabon" to make Monkey Bread.

This is a pretty awesome recipe.  I have been looking for a monkey bread recipe that does not call for refrigerator biscuits and this is perfect.  I do not have a bundt pan so I used a muffin pan instead (only cooked this for about 15 minutes) and popped 3 or 4 of the chunks of dough into each greased muffin cup.  However, I will definitely have to get a bundt pan now that I know how wonderful this recipe is and try it that way next!

I used my Cuisinart food processor instead of the bread machine to mix and knead the dough.  I also proofed the yeast in 1/2 c water before adding the liquid ingredients to the mixer.  I omitted the raisins and used pecan pieces in the dough and pecan halves in the bottom of the pan.  When I made the butter sugar syrup I also added cinnamon (maybe 1/2T) for extra flavor. My Monkey Bread turned out exactly as I like it with just the right amount of gooey, sticky sauce and pecans throughout.  I loved this recipe and will definitely make it again as it was easy.  From start to finish it only took 2 hours to make these and they were wonderful.

You saved our Christmas! My mother was making Monkey Bread as a tradition but forgot to pick up the packaged dough. I couldn't find a store open late on Christmas Eve so I looked for a way to make it from scratch.  Our family already loved the version using packaged dough, but this recipe kicked it up a notch and they all loved it! I made a couple of adjustments to make it *easier.* Made the dough by hand (no bread machine) and it was easy to work with it. Let rest for about 50-60 minutes until doubled. Punched down and rolled out the dough and cut it into 1" pieces with a pizza cutter. Melted the butter by itself. Placed the brown sugar and 1 c. nuts (omitted raisins) into a shallow bowl. Dunked the dough pieces into the butter and then moved to the sugar mixture; rolled til coated and then placed into the angel food pan. Poured the remaining sugar/nuts into the butter and then poured over the top of dough.  Let rest another 20 minutes. Baked for 30 minutes. Gone before I knew it!

Tastes divine! Want to try it with cranberries or blueberries as well as apples.  I do think next time I make it I will make only half the sauce as I had enough for two doughs.

Really good !-- will wait to cool about 15 minutes next time before flipping on to a plate. The sugar ran all over the place. I did not have raisins on hand but I did use dried currants, which were good as well. I think I will cut down the cinnamon in the dough just a little bit, maybe add it to the sugar/butter to go on the outside instead? This did not last long in my house. My husband is an addict when it comes to sticky buns/sweet rolls!!

This recipe is PERFECT! I do not have a bread machine, but I used my KitchenAid to mix the dough and did the rest by hand. Also very delicious without the raisins or nuts (I didnt have any on hand)! I used another poster's suggestion of keeping the butter and brown sugar seperate and dipping the dough balls into each individually and it made a sort of carmel coating on each piece you pull off :) YUM! I will make this recipe for many years to come! Thank you for sharing!

AWESOME recipe. So easy- and love the fact that you don't have to use refrigerated biscuits. I prefer to make things from scratch with just real ingredients. My family absolutely RAVED about this. Hands down the best monkey bread recipe I've tried.

Did it the muscle-building way & used 1 cup warm milk to proof the yeast with 2 tblsp sugar.  Used 1/2 cup butter & 1/2 cup brown sugar for the sauce and found it to just coat the pieces.  It came out a bit uncooked towards the bundt pan center.  Next time will cook a bit longer.  That being said, it was all gone in about 10 minutes!

Really good but I agree with some of the other posters about rolling the "balls" in the butter then sugar.  I didn't do that but it probably would have added a little something.  I have also thought about sprinkling a butterscotch pudding mix over the balls before letting it rise.  That was done on another recipe and I am curious to see how that would taste.   I added a cinnabon frosting that made it very nice but I think that next time I am going to add a caramel glaze over the bread.

Fun to make and tasted great, but mine was still pretty doughy in the middle and the edges were over done, I would recommend to turn the oven down a little and to cook the full recommended time.

My mom could not find her recipe, so I found this one and I am so happy! I had no easy dough on hand, but have a bread maker and prefer to make things "from scratch". Just like moms! Thanks for sharing this recipe!

This was very good, family also enjoyed. The only change for us I would make next time is to cut down on the sauce, it was a little too sweet for us. Really does tasste like the inside of a cinnamon bun.

This recipe turned out awesome.  I used whole wheat flour because that is all that I had.  I would use it again it gave it a heartier texture.  i served it to my inlaws when they came over and they said that it tased just like the one they had in a fancy bakery in Vancouver over the weekend.  Thanks for the recipe it is a keeper.

I agree with Auntiet who said to coat each piece with butter then roll in brown sugar (no nuts because we have a nut allergy in our house)and then pour butter and sugar on top.  I will try this next time, as each did not have enough coating.  Good recipe overall.

I had never had or mad monkey bread before - I did not know wat I was missing! It was delicious - like a cinnamon bun, but every piece was like my favorite part - the gooey center! I think next time I may add a bit more cinnamon, but otherwise a terrific recipe!

I'd never had this before, but I liked the way it looked. The flavour is somewhat reminiscent of Tim Hortons' Timbits--but better because this is not deep-fried like doughnuts! I added walnuts and halved the sauce. The walnuts are awesome in this, much better than the raisins. I would add more nuts and reduce raisins next time. I used chopsticks to dip the pieces in the sauce. This is best served fresh for a large group of people. I had some left over the next day and it just wasn't the same, re-heated in the microwave.

I loved that I could use my bread machine to make this but I did not care for the glaze. I will make the bread again but look for a different sauce to put on it.

I really liked this recipe! My mom used to make this for us and it tastes very similar to her recipe. I poured the remaining sauce over the bread before letting it rise. After baking, I dumped it onto a plate and the top was soggy although the bottom was done. I just broiled it for a few minutes on high and it was perfect. There were suggestions from family to make it with more sauce next time. I thought it was sweet enough. I recommend saving a little of the sauce for those who'd like to dip! :)

WAY AWESOME -I loved this one - I made 1 for my in-laws, 1 for some friends, & 1 for the office.  made it several different ways. I Found that cutting the raisins and putting them in the dough with the nuts and then making the balls and dipping was the best for me.   THANK YOU SO MUCH.

Really good-reminded me of the bread my dad made us when we were kids. I only used one stick of margarine for the dipping process and still had some left over, which I dumped over the top of the bread. I also individually dipped each piece into the sugar and I believe this is the best way.

I made this recipe with a few modifications.  1.) I used the dough from Sweet Dinner Rolls on this site (amazing). 2.) I added 2tsps. of cinnamon to the sugar mixture.  3.) I used half a cup of raisens and half a cup of pecans in the sauce.  Delicious!! Pretty easy too, it just takes a bit of time to make the dough.  At first I tried rolling the pieces of dough into balls, but then I just dropped the random shapes into the sugar mixture because they all fuse together anyway. Much easier than cinnamon buns and it’s like having all the ‘heart’ pieces without any of the outside crust!  Thank you!

Very easy and tastes wonderful warm with vanilla ice cream on the side.
I did add a touch of ginger in the dough mix.
I also added some cinnamon to the brown sugar/butter coating.

We skipped the nuts and raisins (kids picky) and everyone loved it.  Excellent flavor in my home's opinion...but we usually make things sweeter than called for.  As always, try the recipe way first then tweek to your pleasure.  WE LOVE IT!
