Made precisely as written to accompany roasted pork tenderloin and some fried, garlicky cabbage and broccoli. This is delicious, full of flavor and super easy to make. One could add toasted pecans for texture contrast if desired. I will definitely be making this one again. Thank you for posting this great, quick recipe for others to share!

Delicious.  Used vegetable broth and no coconut milk.
