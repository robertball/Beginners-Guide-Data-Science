Great directions for a general idea on chia gel. Once you start to consume this often all you have to do is eyeball it.

I love to add a couple of tablespoons to juice. I have a question how long will this gel keep in the refrigerator?

Amazing and simple! Put some in my morning yogurt and it gives it the consistency of tapioca pudding. Thank you for sharing!

It really does give you a nice boost, mix it with apple juice and a shot of apple cider vinegar for DIY quick Kombucha-like drink!

I love it this recipe. I mix my raw honey and wheat grass juice with it and take it by the spoonful. It is so much fun to eat this way. For my children I use natural fruit juice they like the different colors and flavors.

Nice gel!  Wasn’t sure of the correct water to chia seed ratio but this turned out great.  I add 2 Tbsp. gel to my yogurt every day to increase my intake of omega 3’s!

So easy! Thank you for the recipe. After awhile I agree, you can eyeball the amounts. I keep it in a covered mason jar in the fridge and just pour into my kefir and yogurt as needed.
