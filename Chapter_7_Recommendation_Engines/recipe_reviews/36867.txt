One of our favorites - we like to double the sauce b/c we pour it over our broccoli.  That said, I've found it a cinch to multiply all the sauce ingredients by 6 (thus using up most of the black bean sauce that I would otherwise waste).  I then use 1/3 of the sauce for dinner, and divide the remaining sauce into 2 freezer bags and freeze them.  Then the next two times I make this meal, all I have to do is thaw and warm the sauce in the microwave while I cook the fish.

This really was a nice dish and a refreshing and unusual departure from what Hubs and I might typically eat.  A wonderful blend of ingredients that came together to make a delicious drizzling sauce - dark, rich and a little sweet.  A little is nice, more would ruin the dish.  I liked the cilantro to finish but Hubs could have done without.  I baked the fish at 400 degrees until the fish was cooked through; for my thick halibut filets that took about 15 minutes.  I served this with "Sesame Udon Noodles," recipe also from this site and they complemented each other well.

Yum!  Made it last night for 2, but tripled the sauce recipe ( so like sauce for 18 I guess:>).  Baked it in the oven, turning once, at 400 for about 15 minutes.  Served with Jasmine rice and asparagus with shitake mushrooms.  Here's the kicker - I  couldn't find 'mirin' - so I substituted reisling (1.5 cups).  It was great!  The sauce is salty (sauce for 18 eaten by 2 people, go figure) so next time I might try low soldium soy.  Thanks!  Husband really liked it!

This recipe is in my monthly rotation; very tasty and very easy.  I've made it with salmon and it's just as good.  The sauce makes the recipe taste like something from a restaurant, but it's still super easy.

This recipe is wonderful! I've used both halibut and ling cod and they came out great. I added red pepper flakes for some heat. I had some extra sauce so I used it for sauted asparagus to go along side and it was delicious (green beans would work too). I will definately make this again, thanks for sharing!

YUM!  This will be my go to for white fish now!  It made several converts of my family who previously claimed not to like fish.  They got seconds!  I served this with quick sesame green beans (adding shiitake mushrooms after reading SunnyByrd's review), lime cilantro rice, and mango lassi II all from this site.  The sauce on this is so easy to throw together, delicious, and light tasting.  It's also very versatile.  I always have the best intentions of making a recipe "as written" but I couldn't find the rice wine and I realized I was out of rice vinegar last minute.  I subbed pinot grigio and white wine vinegar, and it still turned out wonderful.  Thank you for sharing this Kathryn!

This was excellent!  My family enjoyed as well as myself!  I recommend this recipe!  I didn't have shallots on hand but I used finely choppped onions instead.  And I also doubled the sauce.

Excellent! I was afraid this was going to be too salty for me, but it turned out perfectly. I served the fish with gingered green beans and shiitakes, and sesame rice. I can see this sauce complimenting most kinds of fish, and will definitely use it again. Thanks for the recipe!

Fantastic! The sauce is so good. You can use it with so many different foods. Last night I served it with fresh Red Grouper right out of the Gulf of Mexico. OMG! Had a 1 1/4 lb filet between two of us. There may be a bite or two left. Served it like the picture on the main page. Fish/Rice/Asparagus. Yummy! Had to buy all the ingredients except Black Bean Sauce. It is the Mirin that really sets it off. Mirin is a sweeten Rice Wine(Sake).Took me 2 different stores to find it but it IS the key ingredient. Thank you for the great recipe.

Wow!  It's a wow!  I bought fresh Monchong (in Hawaii), used this Asian glaze recipe -- it's as good as they serve at Roy Yamaguchi's!  Of course, right off the grill by the beach doesn't hurt, either......Simple ingrediants that I can leave on the shelf, simple preparation, great balance of flavors that compliment whatever firm firsh you are grilling.  It's going in my book of favorites!

Absolutely delicious!

The flavors were sweet, Asian, yummy. Think of teriyaki, but then take in a slightly different direction. Very nice.

The great thing is that it works with a number of different fish: Halibut, Cod, Salmon, etc. Serve with rice to soak up that delicious sauce.

I've been making this for years. Tonight I discovered I was out of mirin. I (googled it &) used apple juice. The taste was only slightly different, and it was still delicious! We LOVE this recipe!

Outstanding!  The sauce is to die for!  I doubled the sauce ingredients, per previous reviews and I am glad I did.  I put the halibut in the oven for 15 minutes (turning once) at 425 and then served with the sauce and the Carrot Rice recipe from this site.  The sauce is very tasty and versatile.   am going to try it on chicken.

Loved it. Used Sea Bass. Used low salt soy. Served with sugar snap peas and wild rice. Baked for ten mins covered at 350 then took the cover off and flipped the filets. Turned out perfect.  Terrific easy recipe.

Yum! This was a great way to use some of these ingredients we don't use often. I used cod because the store was out of halibut. Delicious! We poured the excess sauce over broccoli which was amazing. This will definitely be a frequent at our house.

YUM.  Easy and good.  Be careful not to use too much sauce.  It is yummy but could overpower the fish if you use too much. Company dish.

So easy and it looks like you spent a lot of time on it.  Perfect for a dinner party, you will look like a gourmet chef.  I use low sodium soy sauce, but follow the recipe with no changes.  Great on all fish, but halibut really is the best because of its firm texture.

This maybe the only recipe on this website that I read all the comments for. I thought it was a pretty tasty dish and my boyfriend liked it as well, but I wasn't as crazy about it as a thought I'd be from reading the comments. I found no reason to double the sauce- it's a good sauce but I didn't want to put it on everything, if anything it's a little too sweet for my taste (those that said it was salty probably didn't let it cook long enough). Overall I liked it.

First review.  This is an excellent recipe.  We bagged the cilantro and used the green part of scallions as a topping.  Multiplied the sauce and used it on both fish and sticky rice.  Although our vegetable was broccoli I would use baby bok choy the next time and there will be a next time.  Kudos to Kathryn for this recipe, a wonderful addition to our "heart healthy" attempts.

THIS WAS WONDERFUL!  Make this as stated and you will NOT be disappointed.  With a pound of halibut to serve three, I doubled the sauce but had some left over (froze it for later use on anything I can think of!).  It was perfect with sticky rice.  I almost wish I had put just a tad more sesame oil on the fish, but how can you quibble about perfection?!

I made this with blackened salmon and it was incredible! I'm pretty sure I could have used spam & it would have been equally incredible. The sauce.......Ohhh the sauce! just follow the directions and don't substitute anything. No need to mess with perfection. I served it with jasmine rice & sesame green beans.

This was really good. My husband loved the sauce. I used Mahi Mahi and sautéed the fish in sesame oil. Very good!

This will be added to our monthly menu.  All members of the family LOVED it!  I didn't have any black bean sauce or black beans, so I left that out, but no substitutions other than that.  Served with Sesame Udon noodles and it was a great complement.

Used salmon as I didn't have halibut.  Used ginger oil as I didn't have sesame oil.  Made two fillets.  The sauce was enough for the two.  Made the sauce first.  Put aside to keep warm and used the same oven proof saute pan to pan seared the salmon for three minutes and then finished in a 450 degree oven for about 8 minutes.  Served with leftover dirty rice and sweet potato rings coated with olive oil and brown sugar.  Cooked in 450 degree oven for 15 minutes before adding the salmon.  Yum.  All kinds of potential dishes from this sauce.  Thanks!

Very good. Passed the 3 yr old and 1 yr old test. I used cod because halibut was so expensive. I was disappointed in the fish but not the sauce/flavor. I will make it again with halibut which is a favorite of mine and my husband's.

very good.  since halibut is so expensive, i used basa swai (?) instead, which is much much cheaper, and it still turned out very tasty.  paired with asparagus.

Really enjoyed this dish. Followed recipe exactly, but did double the sauce, which went well with the brown rice and broccoli served with the halibut. My husband, who always thinks everything is "ok" raved about the sauce. Thanks for a great recipe.

***THIS IS DELICIOUS***  We loved this recipe, especially the sauce.  I didn't have black bean sauce so I used oyster sauce.  I served the halibut over raw spinach with cherry tomatoes and the sauce over that was fabulous too.  Next time, I'll double the sauce since I could see it going with so many other things, like chicken, shrimp, scallops, pork, you name it.  This would be a great sauce for spring rolls too.  EXCELLENT RECIPES!!

I also doubled the sauce per the suggestions of some other reviews. Broiled the halibut and served with whole wheat soba noodles (sprinkled with black sesame seeds) and bok choy. Delicious!

This was a phenomenal sauce. At first I was leary because I had to buy all of the ingredients, but I am glad that I did because I will be making this again. For those who thought it was too salty, make sure you reduce the sauce enough, and you end up with a mild, sweet sauce, not a salty one.

I made this recipe for our out-of-town guest. It was a tremendous hit, even with my teenagers! This is definately a recipe I will make often. I added red pepper flakes to the sesame oil to give it some kick. It was enjoyed by all. It even made frozen halibut taste wonderful.

Made this first with COD and did not care for it. Could not find mirin so substituted with Sake and  sugar, maybe that was the  problem. Made it the second time after getting some mirin. Served with Sockeye Salmon and it was awesome.  Will definitely make again

This was my first go round with Halibut, and I can definitely say I'll be making this one again.  I wish I could have a grill, because I suspect this would be amazing grilled, and in hindsight I could have broiled it, but I chose to bake it.  The sauce was absolutely amazing as written.  I wouldn't change a thing!

Incredible sauce!   I follow the instructions precisely.  I agree with others that it is wise to make more of it.   The recipe states that it serves 6, but it serves 3-4 in my household, bc people want a lot of it.   If halibut isn't available, consider serving this with mahimahi or another firm white fish.  I think it's too intense for a delicate, flaky fillet.    I often serve this with Sesame Udon noodles, a recipe available on this website.   The two recipes work really well together.

OMG, best recipe ever!  I used this on the hake I had from Costco, and served it with some Sapporo Ichiban Chow Mein and HEB Select shelled edamame, and it was WONDERFUL and so easy!  I don't usually take the time to comment on the recipes, but this was so, so good (I'm glad I made 2 extra servings for lunch tomorrow!!!)

This is one of those rare instances where I just DO NOT understand why this was so highly rated. I followed the recipe EXACTLY and it was just a sticky sweet sauce that tasted like something you'd get at a cheap chinese restaurant.   I just don't get it. I spent about an hour collecting the ingredients and then cooking and I literally didn't eat it (literally). I blame this partly on the crappy fish (Cod and Catfish I bought at Winn Dixie) but even still....it just wasn't good.   I hate to be the first negative review for this but I have to be honest here.

This was hit with the whole family, even with my picky 6 year old.  I sauteed the fish instead of grilling because it was raining.  I doubled the amount of sauce and served it on the side dishes of rice and green beans.  I'll definitely make it again, and next time I'll grill the fish.

Simple and easy and a great compliment to the halibut.  Agree with those that say to double recipe so you can freeze some for another day!

The sauce was out of this world.  The only change I made to this recipe was to double the sauce and I am glad I did.  Served it with basamti rice and spinach.  This will go on regular rotation and will try it with different fish.

Just a note per a previous reviewer's comment: hoisin sauce is not the same as black bean sauce - the black bean sauce is combined with garlic and is savory as opposed to sweet. Usually found in a jar. Lee Kum Kee (red lid) is a popular brand  (at least in the west coast) and can be found in most asian markets or asian food section with the rest of the jarred sauces. Update: Interesting combo of flavors. Made for dinner tonite. Substituted green onion for shallots and garlic chili sauce (about 1 tsp) and vegetarian stir fry sauce (2 tsp) cuz I was out of black bean sauce. the sauce came out nicely without any one flavor overpowering 
the other. i might up the chili sauce next time even if I had the black bean sauce. Broiled the halibut on low, and the fish was nice and moist.  Served with whole asparagus that I tossed on the roasting pan with the fish.  Next time I might angle slice the aspagus to get more of the sauce on.  Would make again.

We liked this very much.  The sauce is a nice touch and does not overwhelm the wonderful halibut.  Will use this recipe often.

The sauce on this dish is fabulous.  I admit, I did make a few changes just based upon what I had in the kitchen.  Here is what I did, only based upon "items on hand":
*used tilapia, and baked in oven instead of grilling
*used sherry instead of the mirin, like others suggested
*hunted all over grocery store for black bean sauce to no avail, ended up using hoisin sauce that I already had (is this maybe the same thing?)
*used dried cilantro rather than fresh
*be sure to double the sauce...I didn't but wish I would've
Sorry to all of you purists out there that say we need to follow a recipe exactly the first time.  The sauce is what makes this.
Served with red beans and rice along with fresh asparagus and white wine.  Yum.

Wow, this was delicious.  This was one of the best tasting fish dishes I have had.  I would agree that the cilantro really makes the dish incredible. Do not leave it out.  I think next time I will double the sauce.  We served the fish with Sobe noodles.  As they didn't have a lot of flavor, the sauce really enhanced the side dish too.  EXCELLENT!

OMG!  This was really, really good.  Next time I will add a little more sesame oil onto the fish so that it wont stick on the grill.  I will also add more cilantro.  The mix of flavors was really impressive, but the cilantro (and I'm not a huge fan of the herb) gave it such a fresh flavor.  The cilantro is the icing on top do not skimp on it or delete it!  Really good and resturant quality.  The best part of the recipe is that I had every ingrediant in my staple items.  Thanks, Kathryn, this is a keeper!

We made this for ten people last night and it was a hit.  I would serve the sauce at a warmer temperature next time. The flavors were a perfect compliment to halibut.  We also had two pieces of sea bass with the halibut and they were excellent.

This was so easy and delicious to make. I've made some alternations, instead of grilling, it cooked on the stove for less than an hour. Instead of black bean sauce, I made it with miso paste, soy sauce, and rice vinegar. I didn't need mirin. And it paired well with couscous. Delish! I would love to make it again!

So easy! And amazing flavor! Will definitely do again! I used grouper which wasn’t as thick as the halibut so I cut back the time. I also used a grated cast iron skillet to brown the fish. I’m going to try it on salmon next! Thx!

Works well with red snapper and/or redfish. Nice change of pace recipe. Goes well with bokchoy recipe on this site and rice. I used a garlic black bean sauce.

I did not have sesame oil so used EVOO and it came out just fine.  Everyone enjoyed it and there were no leftovers. 

Have made it at least two more times, with the sesame oil, and it is absolutely scrummy.  Definitely double the sauce so that you can pour it over rice and or veggies.

Made this recipe with grilled Halibut and followed the recipe exactly. Took the advice of other reviewers and doubled up on the sauce - highly recommend. Take the extra time to find great mirin because the mirin is the key to the flavor! After the sauce is reduced, let it stand while you prepare the fish and sides; the shallots will soak up the juices. Freeze whatever sauce is left - if any - and use it later. Fantastic recipe! My crab rangoons, on the other hand, exploded in the deep fryer. I will master them!!

My husband says four stars because I’ve made recipes with more flavor. I think perhaps the Mirin was too sweet for him. But he did say that it was good. It wasn’t too complicated to prepare. I used a countertop grill, which worked well. I didn’t have as many fillets as the recipe required. I’m not a big fan of fish, but I’m saving the extra sauce for me to eat over broccoli.

Lovely recipe.Very unusual. Didn't have any Mirin so used Italian Moscato and it was great.
Served with asparagus.
Even people who don't like fish will probably like this.

Really quick and easy. Wasn't as tasty as I'd hoped but maybe due to the substitutions I had to make.
Used Hoisin  sauce because no black bean sauce.
Used low sodium say sauce
Used the rice wine I had on hand which I'm not sure if it was sweet enough.
Made sauce quantity as recipe states but only 2 pieces of halibut. Amount was good and had only a bit left over

Wow! It turned out so good!  We made it without the Black Bean sauce and it was delicious.  We added extra garlic and shallots and a little less mirin because I didn't  want it to be too sweet.  Overall 4 and a half star!

Awesome recipe, cannot go wrong with this one.  I always make extra sauce to put on vegetables, or even add to my salad the next day to make an oriental chicken salad

This was the best tasting sauce for fish I have tasted.  Once again, the kids loved it and that works for me.  Even without the wine (which I couldn't find), I will definitely make this again!

This dish was amazing! Halibut is my favorite fish and the sauce had such a nice flavor, just like in a restaurant. I follow the recipe exactly as is and I wouldn't change anything here. Thanks Kslago this is a keeper!

This is a very good dish and something out of the ordinary. The blend of flavors is tasty. I made it last night for friends. I put it on some quality King salmon and halibut. My only complaint is that there isn't much sauce to begin with and once half of it boils away, there's hardly anything left. I think I tripled the amount of oil in the recipe and added a teaspoon of Asian hot chili oil to give it a little zing (I'm glad I did). Otherwise, this was a great little recipe. Don't forget the cilantro!

Excellent! We love it! Used Sherry instead of Japanese Sweet Wine like another reviewer suggested. Also doubled up on the sauce. Is now one of our favorite fish recipes.

I joined the site just to review this recipe.  LOVED IT. I added a little white wine when I poured in the mirin, just because I like the flavor it lends.  GREAT recipe!

very good - next time I plan to use more shallots and less soy.  worked fine under broiler; do not skimp on the cilantro, it makes the dish.

This recipe is EXCELLENT!  I absolutely loved it.  The only changes I made were to use a cabernet/merlot (Yellowtail) instead of sweet wine, as that is what I had on hand , and I switched the halibut out for salmon.  I am trying to figure out what else I can use this sauce on besides fish (my boyfriend is allergic), because it is so good.  Thanks for the recipe.

Easy recipe, but just OK.  I wouldn't make it again.
