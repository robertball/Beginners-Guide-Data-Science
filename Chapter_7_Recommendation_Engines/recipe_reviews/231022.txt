The entire family loved it.  Ate it over grilled pork chops but would go great with chicken, beef, fish.  Very versatile.  I used red onion and green pepper because that is what I had in the house.

I thought this salsa was tasty, but it turned out too mushy/runny with cooked tomatoes.  I would make it again but would not roast the tomatoes - only the other veggies and the peach.
