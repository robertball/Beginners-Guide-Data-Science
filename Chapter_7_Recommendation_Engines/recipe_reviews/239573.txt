Tasty and filling warm winter salad. I cheated and added bacon and am soooo glad I did. I used almond shavings instead of walnuts. All the flavours and textures just worked. What didn't work was the oven temperature and the time. At 110°C for 25 minutes nothing was happening except wilting the kale without any sign of getting crispy. So I cranked up the heat to 200°C and waited until the kale and chickpeas got crunchy and took it out. I also used olive oil instead of sunflower seed oil (not available in my area). Thank you LadyRae for the recipe.

I subbed almonds for walnuts but next time I would use walnuts, to give it a "richer" flavor. To save time, I didn't roast the almonds. I also used evoo and omitted the pepper. Quick, healthy snack. Tip-don't refrigerate leftovers, the kale loses its crispiness.

Very tasty and very easy though I think next time I will go halves on the Pepper and I might double the amount of kale next time because I too love kale!

I made it, adding some onions, red peppers, cranberries, and red wine vinegar. It was wonderful!

Used slivered almonds instead of walnuts and dried parsley instead of fresh. Still very tasty!!
