4.13.18  I know there are a lot of Jell-O® haters out there these days, but we’re not among them, we still like it!  I did use sugar-free Jell-O® and although this looks like a totally strawberry dessert from the red color, the bright lemon flavor doesn’t get lost.   A few more strawberry slices wouldn't hurt this jell-o.   I never cook much on Fridays but wanted a little something easy for dessert, and this recipe didn’t disappoint, it was good.  Thanks for sharing your recipe summerstar10.
