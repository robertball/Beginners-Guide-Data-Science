My family is from Guam and this is not kelaguen to  me.  The chicken should only be barbecued after being marinated in soy sauce, lemon, garlic and onions.  After it has been grilled and finely cut, then you flavor it with green onions, salt, lemon, red pepper (i like it spicy) and coconut.  I usually cut out the coconut when I make it for myself.  This is great if you are watching your weight!

I grilled the chicken over hot coals instead of broiling it. It tastes even better.

I am Guamanian so kelaguen is present at any family reunion we have. i love it. but my family adds green onions and red chili pepper flakes and we dont use the coconut. i think its better this way.  serve with Chamorro style red rice and finadene and any meat of your choice and you've got the average Chamorro meal

Although grilled on a barbecue is best, chicken roasted on a spit at the local supermarket isn't all that bad, either.  I also use chopped green onion for essential flavor and color.

If you live near an Asian market try to find Yours brand lemon powder, it makes all the difference. If you want your kalguen dry then sprinkle it in powder form, if you want the kelaguen more on the wet side then mix the lemon powder in water then combine with the other indgredients.

I'm lazy so I broil boneless/skinless chicken thighs for this dish. Adding sliced scallions makes for a tastier dish, too.

This recipe produces a great kelaguen.  I usually bake seasoned chicken breasts and thighs in the oven and it still turns out good. Remove the skin from the thigh and leave the crispy parts of the breast skin on when you dice the meat.
