mixed the cream cheese with some 1 teaspoon cinamon, 1/2 cup powdered sugar.  Carmelized the apples in 2 Tablespoons butter and 1 T. brown sugar, Dash cinamon.  Great!

Not my thing AT ALL. For the first time, I threw out more than half of what I cooked. I was hoping that it would be a good surprise, but in fact, this recipe is exactly as strange as it sounds. Is it lunch? Dinner? Side dish? I can't imagine what it might accompany. Not a good recipe in my opinion, sorry.

This was good, I replaced the pizza crust with crescent rolls.  I liked these, although I cut my apples thin so next I will cut them thicker.  The crescent roll was awesome, gave it a nice crust.

I made this for my family on New Years Eve. My daughter and my nieces enjoyed helping me with it. After cutting up the apples, I made the mistake of not putting all of them on the pizza because I thought it was entirely too many, but I was wrong. Next time I make it I will use all of the apple slices and I will also try some Splenda and cinnamon ont it too.

My fiancee really liked this but I followed some other suggestions and changed the recipe, so that is why I am not giving it a better rating.  I used a wheat crust, put minced garlic on the cream cheese before adding the cheese, used a bag and a quarter of cheese (about 2 1/2 cups), and then putting green onions and chopped turkey bacon on the top.  I used an 8 oz package of cream cheese to make it easy to spread and that was WAY too much.  The pizza was really good but it was too rich with all of the cream cheese I put.  Next time will make it with about half, closer to the recipe amount.  Did really like the overall taste though and will make again.

Sorry for the low rating.  I do not like sweets so I did not taste this but...and a BIG BUT...I prepared it for a group of teachers...co-workers...who love food and no one I mean no one asked for the recipe...very unusual.  I took home the leftovers to my husband who really enjoys apple pie and sweets in general. Guess it might taste good to someoneâ€¦just not the people I made it for.  Hope this is helpful for you.

My husband and his sister thought this tasted like a nice apple pie/dessert on a pizza crust (not a good combo) with burned-in-a-good-way cheese on top. I was really hoping I'd at least like this, but it just wasn't very good.

Unsual, easy, tasty. We enjoyed this to answer the reviewer who asked when would one eat this-for lunch!!! I made this for 2 and therefore halved the recipe. We even enjoyed the leftovers.

Definately use granny apples - gives the pizza way more flavor. I also peel them. This is a super easy recipe, I have even used swiss cheese and found it yummy.

It was pretty good! I used granny smith apples and I would recomend using them. I took the skin off the apples and I would recommend doing that also. I love cream cheese, so I put a lot on but it was messy because it was coming out the sides, so even if you love cream cheese I wouldn't put a ton on. ;)

A fun lunch item or afternoon/small party snack. I added a few other cheeses that were sitting around and they all worked well.

Out of the ordinary but not bad. Tastes good, just not my idea of pizza.
