This was an excellent alternative to plain rice.  Here were the changes I made: I steamed my rice, tried almonds instead of peanuts first and then tried peanuts and my husband and I both prefered ground almonds instead.  Added 1/4 tsp of cayenne pepper because we love it spicy! Used 3/4 tsp of ground ginger.  Used a good amount of salt and left out the cilantro, but I'm sure this would be an excellent garnish but didn't have it on hand.  Made this with cajun snapper.  Will cook this many more times.  Thanks Sowmya :)

We loved it,I had no peanuts so I substituted 1/4 cup of sunflower seeds (They come in a bag already shelled/lightly salted - great for adding a little nutty flavour to salads too), I grated 1 large carrot on the cheese grator and diced 1/2 of a purple/red onion, I also thru in a bit of diced red sweet pepper and I used minced ginger available in the jar.  The rice turned out a lovely golden colour and the veggys looked like confetti - quite pretty.  I might cut the cayenne in half next time because hubby likes things very mild, but if you like quite a bit of zing use the whole amount.  I almost went right past this recipe because the title "carrot Rice" doesn't sound like anything special but when I couldn't find any other recipes that had ingredients I had on hand, I gave it a try - it's a keeper - thanks for sharing

What a wonderful way to spice up the already delicious and fragrant basmati rice. My husband and I both love basmati rice already, but this was excellent. I put a bit too much cayenne in for him, but it is never too spicy for me. You can make it as spicy or mild as you want. I also added about 3/4 cup of chicken broth to the carrot mixture to moisten. Also, be sure to actually let the mixture steam completely for at least the 5 minutes to marry the flavors and soften the veggies. I am making this dish again for a dinner party this superbowl weekend. Thanks so much!!

This is the best rice side dish I've ever used.  Even my picky grandchildren, who don't like rice, liked this dish.  I used a zester to make long spaghetti like carrot pieces instead of grating which took a little extra time but my grandchildren were fascinated.

This one sounded so exotic and yummy. Not sure what I did wrong but it was terrible! The minced ginger was crunchy and inedible and I thought the whole thing was really dry. We just couldn't eat it! :(

This recipe is a great way to spice up rice. I loved it. I used cashews instead of peanuts.

I love this dish!  I used leftover brown rice, more grated carrot than it called for,  olive oil instead of margarine, at least double the ginger because I love it, and a big clove of garlic.  I added some chicken stock to it when I added the leftover rice to soften it up.  I didn't have any cilantro and it was still awesome.  Would be great with an egg fried in at the end, definitely the cilantro, and maybe some lime squeezed in for some brightness.

I love this dish.  My middle-schooler asked for seconds.  I used leftover white rice the first time, so the whole dish came together in 10 minutes.  And it was so good!  The ground nuts and the fresh ginger go such a long way flavor-wise.  This is in our normal rotation for dinner.  TIP: Doubling up everything but the rice makes it a great vegan entree.  For a flavor twist, this is ohmygod good with a few tablespoons of orange juice or some orange zest.

Took a lot of prep work, but such a festive side dish for Asian main dishes (Worked great with Asian Tilapia!)  Be careful to mince ginger completely.

YUM!!!  If I could give this more stars I would.  Made this twice in one weekend.  First time made exactly as written, second time I used Jasmine rice and I think I like the Basmati rice just a little bit better in this recipe.  I also didn't think I'd like the peanuts in the recipe but put them in any way...boy am I glad I did, they add just a little bit of crunch that is perfect!

Yum!  My family loved this dish.  Definitely great for spicing up boring ol' rice.  I only made a few changes.  I used half an onion, and a large clove of garlic, I used a little bit more carrot, and about 1/4 cup of chicken stock at the end, when i mixed the carrot mixture with the rice.  Since it was going to sit in the pot for a little while before dinner.  My husband finished off what was in the pot!  I will definitely be adding this to my rotation.  Thank you Sowmya!

I'm addicted to this rice!  I only had Jasmine rice on hand, but followed everything else and it came out excellent!  I did grind the peanuts as directed, but wonder why I can't just use peanut butter? (ground peanuts = peanut butter) I'll try it next time (tomorrow!!) I did add butter when serving, so it held together better...

Used crunchy peanut butter, very tasty and attractive with the orange carrots.  This is not just plain rice and you might not want to use it in meals where you want a bland starch to soak up sauce or gravy.

I tried this for the first time tonight and my husband and I absolutely loved the fullness of flavor.  I did not add the peanuts as he should not eat them and it was still delicious.  You can bet that this will be a company dish this summer.

This is the rice recipe I have been waiting for!  I made this just like the recipe, but used brown rice.  Served it with teriyaki chicken -- awesome!  My husband had seconds -- and, he NEVER does that!  Thanks for the great recipe!

I loved this recipe! I followed the recipe except I could not find regular basmati rice at the store but could only find the Ready in 10 Minutes Boil in a Bag Basmati Rice. It still turned out great! I would have never thought to add peanuts to rice, but it adds so much flavor. I will will definitely be making this again!

I was looking for a rice recipe that was more interesting and this was it! I left out the peanuts because I don't like them in anything and I put the carrots,ginger,and onion in the food processor - so much easier! It went well with steak made with the "Best Steak Marinade in Existence" from this site also.

I was skeptical about this rice because it seemed to easy of a recipe. Also, I'm not a fan of veggies, why on earth would anyone put carrots in rice?! Anyhow, tried it, and boy am I glad I did. Added lots of cayenne to give it spice. Skipped the cilantro because I had none on hand. Flavour was still great, but green probably makes it more pretty. Also I used some natural peanut butter and peanut oil because I didn't have peanuts. Love love loved this dish! Paired it with salmon.

I LOVE this recipe! A little time consuming for me, as I had to hand chop/grate everything. BUT, the end result was fantastic. This does make a HUGE batch of rice, so next time I will halve the recipe to work better for two people. Delish!

This was really yummy and pretty too! I didn't have peanuts so I put whole cooked garbanzo beans instead. I also added fresh sliced cherry tomatoes. I served this with grilled tandoori chicken thighs (from this site) and the whole family loved it! The following day I chopped up the chicken added it to the rice and added some cilantro dressing from trader joes and had a cold chicken "salad" yummy!

Soooo Yummy! Changed a few things due to personal taste preference and what I had on hand. I cooked the rice in my rice cooker using one cup beef broth and one cup water. Used olive oil instead of margarine, added 1 tbsp minced garlic and sauteed with the onion. Omitted the ginger (do NOT like it!). Also used peanut butter instead of ground peanuts. Added lots of fresh cilantro and some green onions that needed to be used up. We loved this, it went great with our Thai pork kabob's for dinner. Thanks for the recipe, it will be used often!

Interesting combination of flavors with carrots, ginger root, peanuts, and cayenne.  Don't omit the peanuts, as they're really important to the flavor of this dish.  I was little concerned that the sliced onions wouldn't work as well as chopped onions, but they incorporated well into the rice.  Very good side dish; I wouldn't change a thing.

EDIT: Looking over my reviews, I can't believe I didn't give this one the full five stars. I make it so often and it is foolproof. Everyone loves it now -- six stars!

[original review] I loved this and it was so easy to make. My kids didn't like it at all, though, so I have to notch it down one star.

Fruity, nutty, and spicy....what's not to love?  I made this with brown rice, and used pecans that I had on hand.  It's a winner!

Bland and boring.  However, this could be an excellent base for some other flavors.  I made it as written and it wasn't that great.  A little hoison sauce and served with an asian dinner would be good.

Very nice!!  I made half the recipe using Jasmine rice that was already cooked and in the freezer, which is something I do often.  Really saves time.  I assembled this  early in the day and refrigerated; then microwaved to reheat - another time-saver!  When reheating I added some green onion for even more color.  Very pretty!  I served this with Spicy Peach-Glazed Pork Chops (also from this site) which turned out to be a very nice combo.   Will definitely make again!

This one is a solid 3 for me.  It wasn't difficult to prepare, but it just had an OK flavor.  I can't think of a dish this would go well with, other than plain chicken or pork, just to have a jazzier side dish.   It wasn't bland, but for me, the flavors just didn't mesh well.  I probably won't make again, but if I do, I might replace the water with Chicken Broth, just to give the rice a smoother background for the spices, carrots and nuts.

bf liked it more than i did.. but this was still pretty good.. i cooked the rice in chicken bouillon.. used regular white rice and 5 alarm style peanuts.. used less than half an onion and wish i would have used the whole thing.. this came off very thai and we felt like it could have used something like soy sauce.. the cilantro is a must.. ty for the recipe

Really enjoyed this dish!  Made one substitution instead of using rice I used a combination of wild rice and quinoa which turned out amazing.  Loved the ginger flavor.

My family really enjoyed this dish.  I used almonds instead of peanuts since my daughter has peanut alegy and brown rice instead since that's all I had in hand.  This was a great side dish and definitely a keeper!!

Used Jasmine Rice and Almonds instead of peanuts.  This had GREAT flavor.  I thought I only put in a little cayenne pepper but it was a little too spicy..next time I will use just a pinch.

I know this dish sounds a bit strange -- carrot rice -- but it is one of the tastiest things I've eaten in a long time!  With the ginger and cilantro it has a fresh Thai flavor, and the peanuts give richness.  I rarely give 5 stars but this was so unexpectedly good I must do so!

I sauteed veggies in a little olive oil and then added butter just before tossing ingredients with the rice.  I grated my ginger on a zester to avoid chunks of ginger that were mentioned in other reviews.  Rice was moist and delicious.  Hubby wants it again!

Used plain whole grain white rice because thats what I had on hand, used ginger powder instead of fresh, used half the onion, chopped instead of grated carrots.  I have made this several times both with & without the white wine someone recommended.  Husband & I love this recipe but the teenagers don't like it.  What do they know?  They would eat Twizzlers with soda for dinner!

This worked really well as a last-minute addition to our Asian-theme dinner (potstickers). I sliced the onion, just as rings, and I would've sliced them smaller had I thought it through a bit more... long circles of onions didn't go well with the size/shapes of everything else... I subbed cashews, simply because I prefer them over peanuts, and I used jasmine rice. I think the only other thing I'd recommend is using less water so the rice doesn't get as gummy/soft. I prefer the rice to stand up a bit more... but that's just nit-picky. A nice recipe!

Great way to put a twist on plain, old rice! Instead of slicing onions I roughly chopped them, because I didn't want long pieces in the side dish. I didn't have fresh ginger root, but the recipe worked fine with half teaspoon ground ginger. I used toasted almonds instead of peanuts and butter instead of margarine for added flavour. This has become my favourite rice recipe! Thanks!

This was great! I did as others suggested and used vegetable broth to cook the rice. I used a teaspoon of chunky peanut butter in place of the peanuts! You must use ginger as it gives it an amazing taste and cilantro is a nice final added touch!

Very tasty and a nice change from other rices!  I used toasted slivered almonds since I didn't have peanuts and ran my knife through them a few times so they we still large enough to taste.  I also diced my onions - couldn't see having long strands of onion in a rice dish.  For the kids, I omitted the cayenne.

This was the most impressive rice dish I have ever made.  I loved it and so did my company.  The only thing was I didn't chop the ginger finely enough so I had to saute a little longer to soften.  Deginately a keeper!

Great rice recipe! I do reserve 5 stars for recipes that blow my socks off (See Mexican Casserole!) but this one is a very strong 4 stars in my eyes. I used about one tsp of dried ground ginger because it's all I had, and it was fine. This is a very good recipe and I will make it a lot. This time I served it alongside steamed broccoli & red peppers with tofu in Hoisin sauce.

Very tasty dish, although I did add about 3/4 can chicken broth after cooking to make it more moist.  All six of us enjoyed the rice, and I definitely plan to make it again, but with more liquid.

This recipe was better than I expected.  My husband liked it too, and he is usually not a rice fan.  The sweetness from the carrots and the spice of the ginger combine great with the peanuts...just an all round good recipe.  Thanks.

For better flavor, I used 1 bunch of green onion chopped, chicken broth instead of water, add all ingredients except peanuts and cilantro right into liquid either water or broth bring to boil, stir in rice cover and cook. Fluff rice put into serving bowl add peanuts and cilantro on top. Or put on side and add what you like to your own serving. Tip for those who have never really used fresh ginger make sure you peal it first and make sure it is fresh and not old makes a big difference. Another way is to take a large chunk and smash with flat side of butcher type knife and add whole then find it and remove before serving. Another variation use 1 can of coconut milk then use chicken broth to make up the full 2 cups of liquid. Also I usually use 2 1/2 cups of liquid

Amazing! I made this twice. The first time was for a dinner party. I made the recipe as closely as I could given my ingredients on hand. I substituted 3/4 tsp ground ginger and honey roasted peanuts. I served it with Vindaloo Chicken. It was delicious and got rave reviews. The rice is on the dry side, perfect for the sauce of the indian dish I paired it with. The second time I made this I followed review suggestions to moisten it up a bit and toss in 1/2 tsp of Better than Bullion and a small amount of water when steaming the carrots. The result when combined in the final stage was a mushy rice mix than I didn't care for. The flavor profile was still great but the beauty of the recipe is getting a nice flavorful rice that flakes and not clumps. This recipe is awesome exactly the way it is. Hope that helps!

Lovely dish!  The picture doesn't do it justice as the rice comes out very light and fluffy.  The delicate basmati rice with the bold flavor of ginger, sweet carrots and salty peanuts is such a nice balance of flavors.  I served this with Indian Cauliflower found on this site and they complimented each other well.  Thank you for sharing this recipe!

Used almonds and jasmine rice because that is what I had.  We really enjoyed this, but I need to add that I never do anything with myrice so this was a nice change.  Make sure you almost caramelize the onion. Yum!

This is a great recipe! I didn't add the peanuts because I was hosting a dinner and feared the possibility of someone having an allergy. I used it as a bed for baked salmon. I did also substitute a tiny bit of butter and a little olive oil in place of the margarine. Will definitely use this again, thank you.

Absolutely delicious!  Didn't add the peanuts, but was a great side dish anyway.  Plenty leftover for lunch the next day and I actually think it was better with flavors melding.  Thanks for sharing!

I always feel bad for rating a recipe when I couldn't make it by the book, but I suppose it helps to know that it will still be worth making if you're short an ingredient or two.
I used sunflower seeds instead of peanuts, and just a little bit of ground ginger because I didn't have fresh.  I didn't use cilantro because we don't like it.  I would estimate that I used about 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper and almost 1 tsp salt.  This was delicious and went great with grilled pork.
A little head's up: this rice was REALLY filling...more than normal rice.  Maybe it was the nuts.  Anyway, you might want to portion a little smaller.

Interesting to say the least.  At first I wasn't sure if I liked it but, it does grow on you.  My company had good things to say about it so that's good.  Will use less ginger next time though.

I really liked this.  I didn't have peanuts so I used toasted pine nuts but I am sure it would have tasted just as good with the peanuts.  Otherwise I made it exactly as written.  It had a nice earthy mild taste.  It's definitely a keeper for me!

I was looking for something different, and this is different. I didnt use margarine, I never do its got a taste to it that I dont like....but thats personal. I use sunflower/olive oil to brown things with sometimes a knob of butter for taste, again that is just how I do it. The ginger gave it a nice twist and I added some garlic, because I felt it needed "something" lemon couldve done it also, I have to try it again to know.

This was a great recipe!  I wanted to make rice, but I wanted to dress it up a bit without having to go to the grocery store... and this pretty much fit the bill.  I halved the recipe for 2 of us, didn't use the peanuts (didn't have them), and used that cilantro in a tube instead of fresh and just mixed it in along with the ginger.  I think I used more ginger, too.  Regardless, it was very tasty, and I bet it would have been even more fabulous if I followed the recipe exactly.  Thanks for a creative spin on rice that made me look good!

This is delicious.  I have been looking for something to spice up our rice, since I am tired of plain white or brown and I abhor using the packaged rice.  I ended up using Jasmine rice and powdered ginger,as that is what I had on hand.  I also omitted the cayenne, as I have a 3 year old, but overall the taste was flavorful. Husband really enjoyed it and said it had a nice Thai flavor.  While this rice took a couple steps, it was fairly easy to make and the directions were clear. Will make again and again.

Very mild flavor.  It was a nice spiffying up of a plain pilaf with light flavors.  Will make again, though might add more spices and ginger, maybe a little bit of garlic.  I also added some fish sauce.  Served it with Tom Kha soup.

This rice is sooooo good! I used ground ginger, (1/8 tsp) and crushed up almonds instead of peanuts. I also substituted some of the onion for green onion, which tasted and looked great! Its really important that you used basmati rice and the cilantro was a key garnish! I served it with the broiled tilapia parmesan from this site to make for a healthy dinner that was very filling!

We skipped the peanuts and found it delicious. Doesn't require much of frying at the end, just a combining with rice, as stated. Great mix of flavours to serve with, or under, a main dish.

This was an interesting recipe, added a little kick to plain old rice! I made brown basmati in a rice cooker and then sauted with the remaining ingredients and the juice from half an orange which kept it moist and flavorful.  Next time I'll use less cayenne, phew!  I served this with grilled garlic asparagus and the "Local Kine Wontons" (sans crabmeat) from this site.  A very nice meal, but the leftovers were even better the next day!  Thanks!

Simple, excellent recipe.  I made the rice in a rice cooker (I never get it right when I use the stove top method). Simply 1 cup basmati to 2 cups water, plop in slow cooker and done.  The rest is foolproof once your rice is the right consistency.

I made this with brown rice and it was delicious, a very nice alternative to plain brown rice.  It seemed a little dressier this way.  The flavors were very subtle yet still very tasty, an excellent recipe that I now make over and over, even for dinner parties.

EXCELLENT!  I was surprised reading some of the lukewarm reviews on this.  My family would eat this rice every meal if it was availble, including my kids.  Key to the recipe is cooking the rice (must be fragrant/basmati) according to the package directions.  Try this - I really can't imagine being disappointed. It is a great compliment to Indian and non-Indian meals. (Peanuts are optional - still great without.)

This was a wonderful alternative to regular rice.  I used grated carrots from the salad bar at the grocery store to save time.  It had a nice bit of spice that is easily adjusted.

I have made this many times, using commercially-prepared Thai peanut sauce but otherwise sticking to the recipe.
It is awesome. Comfort food on the cheap, plus I have shared this recipe with several foodie friends who loved it.

I can eat 2-3 bowls of this at a time.

Simple, delicious, and adaptable depending on what you have on hand.  Used Sunflower (pureed in Nutribullet) instead of Peanuts.  Tasted great, though I'm sure Peanuts would be yummy as well!

The best!! Really like the flavors and cilantro on top made the dish very attactive to serve! Two gentle shakes of cayenne pepper added a special touch! I used brown rice and was delicious with the steak my husband grilled for Mothers Day, along with steamed brocolli. Made excellent meal!

Very good and very easy. I used brown rice and I didn't have fresh cilantro on hand so I mixed in 1/2 tsp of dried; fresh certainly would have been better but it worked in a pinch. I used 3/4 tsp salt and 1/8 tsp cayenne.

This recipe sounds great, but unless you add something to moisten it up a bit (such as soy sauce or peanut sauce) it's rather dry. The flavors are good, but it requires a lot of seasoning for the flavors to shine through. Adding soy and/or peanut sauce does make it great though!

Sorry, didn't care for this.  I added some extra chopped carrot and quite a bit of melted butter just to attempt to get some flavor into it, but it still didn't work for me.  I'd never had basmati rice before, and I think I might have liked it better with a different type.  (But I'm not giving it a second chance.)

This was good, but not very tasty. I thought for sure it would be out of this world but by itself, it was pretty bland. I served it with Chicken Curry over top and let the sauce run all over it - it was incredible this way, but I certainly would never serve it unaccompanied.

I dislike carrots but because they are so healthy and cheap, I'm always looking for ways that I can enjoy them. This is certainly one of them and with all the other flavors the carrot is not overpowering... yum.

Came out great! I used my food processor both for the nuts and then later the carrots -- prep was a breeze. I used almonds as I didn't have peanuts on hand. We loved this, and will have again! Thanks for the recipe!

I added the carrots in long, thinly peeled ribbons near the end of the sauté, while the rice was all steamy. The dish would have been even better if I had cilantro on hand, but instead I added a sprinkle of frozen peas for color. This one's kinda special, ya'll. Give it a try.

Delicious!  I didn't have any white/yellow onion so I used green onions (sauteed the white ends and added the green ends at the end).  I  also added a TBS of "The Peanut Butter Factory" Fiery Peanut Butter and it kicked the heat up an extra notch.  Awesome!  Served it with Terriyaki Chicken and Garlic Broccoli.  YUMMY and healthy meal!

This is a dish people will either love or hate. I brought it to one get together and it was well received, though no rave reviews. Then I brought it to another event and the reaction was very different. Very few people liked it. It’s not a bad recipe, it’s just in need of a “pop” of flavor as it can be a bit bland.

Natural flavors were light and subtle. Great side dish to compliment any dish. I think I'll make this during the holiday's!

Excellent side dish!  (We paired this with "Curried Coconut Chicken" which was delicious.)  I added only a couple pinches of cayenne pepper and used powdered ginger instead of fresh ginger root.  We loved it, although our 4-year-old complained that it hurt her tongue ... so perhaps we will eliminate the cayenne pepper altogether next time.  Will definitely make it again!

This rice was so good. I followed the advise of some others and used almonds instead of nuts and powder ginger. I also chopped the carrots instead of grated. It was really good. So much better than plain white rice.

Delicious! Used almonds instead of peanuts, added some finely chopped mushrooms at the carrot stage. Great healthy alternative to plain rice. Only 4 stars because my toddler didn't love it, but the adults sure did!

Very, very good!!  I didn't add peanuts, because I forgot them at the store, but it was still so good that now I think "Hmmm, what can I make to go with Carrot Rice?". Very easy too.  I did chop the carrots with a food chopper, instead of grating, just my preference.

Good recipe. Tried this last night. I used jasmine rice instead of basmati. I added a clove of garlic, and chopped the carrots instead of grating. Next time I will probably double the amount of peanuts and will grate the carrots (didnt cook long enough to get as tender as we would have liked). Was great paired with Easy Masoor Daal.  Thanks!

Excellent rice dish.  I omitted the cilantro as I don't care for it.  I used slivered almonds at the end of cooking, instead of the peanuts.  Will make this often.

I liked this, but sadly it was not a hit with my family.  I only had brown basmati rice onhand, so maybe they would have liked it better with white basmati.  I really liked the taste of the ginger and carrot.  Also....I omitted the peanuts,

I honestly just made this rice for fun -- with tikka masala, I didn't think I needed extra flavor.  But it was wonderful!  I left out the peanuts and ginger, since I didn't want to go overboard on flavor, but I was so happy I spent the time making this.  It was a wonderful addition to dinner.  I'll be sure to make it again!

The method for making this dish is flawed. I had to add some water to the onion/spice mixture to get them to blend. A little chicken broth would work too. I don't know why they say to "pulverize" the peanuts. It would be better with small crunchy bits of finely chopped peanuts since the peanut meal overwhelms the other flavors. If I hadn't used a generous portion of cayenne I would not have liked the dish at all.

Pretty good rice.  I just realized I forgot the cilantro completely.  Oops.  However, it was just fine without it.  I really think the combo of ginger and peanuts makes this a nice dish.  I used leftover cooked rice, which made it much quicker, and served with Chicken Paprikash.  thanks for the recipe!

I really wanted to love this - and I did like it alot, but I felt it needed more ginger and something else. So at the end I added a dash of ground ginger and a splash of lemon juice. It was much closer to what I thought. I will make this agin but I'll put in a bit more of the seasonings, and likely some lemon juice.

SO good! I made this to go along with "Indian Tomato Chicken" and it was a match made in heaven. It took me a while to make, but the flavor was great. I used ginger out of the jar and it worked fine. Other than that I followed the recipe exactly. My son gave it 2 thumbs up, so its a keeper! I will make this one again for sure!

I made a double recipe and had leftovers, which were quickly devored. I made my rice in a rice cooker and added the cooked rice to my sauted carrots.  I also added one clove of garlic.  The flavor of the ginger was very nice.  I want to make it again with more veggies and maybe some chicken so it could be a complete meal!  Reminds of the chicken & rice dishes I had at restraunts in Costa Rica.

this was such a nice and easy recipe, and delicious! i was only cooking it for myself & my 16-month old baby, so i cut everything in half, except the peanuts. i had leftover rice from lunch, which i didn't warm first, just threw it in as indicated, and let the cooked veggies do it for me.
i would recommend to not completely pulverize the peanuts, like we had done. they formed little pockets of powdered peanuts within the rice. the next time i make this, i will just make them finely chopped.
also, since my son doesn't eat spicy stuff, i omitted the cayenne * just put some black pepper.
great combination of flavors! thank you!

Absolutely DELICICOUS. Followed the recipe exactly (except I didn't put the cilantro on when I served it). I plated it with Beef Tenderloin with Ginger-Shiitake Brown Butter (recipe on this site) and I sauteed some peapods with toasted sesame seeds and seasoned them with salt and pepper. Gorgeous presentation and I truly can't tell you how yummy it was. I did have to add salt when I was eating the rice, so I think the next time I will put some salt in the rice and boiling water (that's just a personal perference).

AWESOME! I did change things up a bit: used 2 1/2 cups broth, doubled ginger and added juice of 1/2 lime, 2 1/2 tbsp fish sauce, 2 tbsp cilantro and a touch of green tabasco. This would be great with any Thai style meal.

I scaled the recipe down to 2 servings but used more carrots (we like our veggies!). I found it a bit bland as is but with a dash of fish sauce (Nuoc Nam) & lime juice, it was great.

Delicious!  If I could give this recipe 6 stars, I would.  It's a great way to jazz up rice, and add a little nutrition at the same time.  This recipe is very easy and really doesn't take more time that it normally takes to make rice.  Thanks, Sowmya!

I made this with brown basmati rice, but otherwise followed the directions.
After the rave reviews, I was initially disappointed. However, the microwaved leftovers the next day were wonderful!

Delicious!  I substituted peanuts for cashews and added less pepper but kept everything the same.  I think the recipe calls for too much water because my rice was a bit too mushy for my tastes.  Next time I will add less water.  

Goes great with the Thai Pork or Chicken Satay dishes on this site.

Very tasty. Now for the obligatory list of substitutions haha. I'm vegan so I substituted coconut oil for the butter and I didn't have peanuts so I used almonds. I also added some chopped raisins during the last few minutes of cooking for some sweetness. I used fresh young ginger that I had on hand from a Japanese market – it's a bit milder and less fibrous than the ginger you usually find at the grocery store, and I would definitely recommend it.

I found this recipe many years ago and have made it several times.  It is always a hit with my family.  I do add salt and am a little heavy-handed with the cayenne, but otherwise I stick to the recipe.  I have substituted powdered ginger for fresh and it is just as good.  I always serve this with chicken satay to bring out the peanut flavor.  Yum!!

Great recipe! I also made with sliced almonds instead, used extra cayenne and carrot shreds. Turned out awesome, even better next day for leftovers.  I also cook with coconut oil which added extra flavoring. Will definitely make it again :)

This was really easy, and rice isn't a usual side dish at my house but was told " even the rice is good".    Server with broiled fish and grilled asparagus.  Dinner was most successful because of this easy yummy rice dish.

I loved this recipe! But I have to admit that I combined it with another recipe on this site.. The "Fried Rice Restaurant Style" because I wanted a little Asian influence. I added the peas and egg, and then the soy sauce and sesame oil at the end. I also added only a  quarter teaspoon of cayenne pepper, which was plenty to kick it up. It was amazing!! Perfect combination of Asian and Thai. Will definitely make it again!

I happened to have lemongrass curry peanuts on hand so I used those. It turned out great. This is going to my one of my definite go-to's as a side dish for any of my thai or curry chicken recipes.

Have made rice like this for years, but also add anywhere from 1-4 tablespoons of lemon or lime juice to give it a tart punch.  4 stars for missing this addition.

We have a peanut allergy in our home so I made it without. In addition to these ingredients I added  a pinch of cane sugar to the onions while browning and honey before adding the rice. Forgot the cilantro but it turned out amazing. The ginger/carrot mix is genius. I will be adding my version to our faves. Thanks!

This was a good alternative to plain rice.  Only change made was I didn't have any peanuts so I substituted 1 Tbsp of peanut butter. Would definitely make again.

Nice.  Becomes very special if you double everything but the rice, as some other reviewers mentioned.  I also added a good handful of sauteed golden raisins, to add sweetness.  I used bagged grated carrots, (a bit thicker and longer than home grated), and didn't have time to bother with blending the roasted almonds (didn't use peanuts upon reviewer's suggestion).  Sliced almonds added texture, but I will try blending next time.  A unique combination of aromas and flavors!

This dish was surprisingly delicious. I was tempted to skip the nuts (used almonds), but wow, they really boosted the dish from good to great! I will be making this over and over.

I made this recipe using brown rice because I had no basmati on hand and we usually try to consume more whole grains whenever possible.  Even with the substitution, it was very good.  I added enough cayenne pepper to give it some heat, and along with the ginger, is a nice taste combination.  I will make this one again.

This rice was amazing. I did a couple things different. I used long grain white rice, no peanuts, and didnt use cilantro. The sweetness from the carrot shines through. The rice had the prettiest color of orange and the taste was awesome. Will make agagin and again! Thanks Sowmya!!!

Eh, this wasn't the best. Very weird tasting.  I'm not a fan of how crunchy the carrots are either. I would suggest cooking them in with the onions so they get softer.  I think this could do without the peanuts too.

Made this and served as a side dish with fish.  Thought the flavors sounded interesting, but was a bit afraid at first.  Wish I had doubled the recipe, because both of my teenagers wanted more! Fantastic flavor.  I grated the ginger root, and in fact added more.  Highly recommend giving it a try.  Would make a great holiday side dish for a nice change of tradition!

Very good. Strong peanut flavor. Followed recipe exactly...too much water for the rice. I would recommend following the directions on the rice pkg (which in my case it should have been 1 3/4cup of water rather than 2 cups).  I agree with others that it seems to be missing something. But would be good with a spicy pork or chicken.

I thought that it was delicious the only problem i had with it was that their wasn't enough flavor i had to add more spice like garlic and a little cumin. No put downs to the creator of the recipe. otherwise it is excellent and i will make it many times from now on.

I really liked this rice, it had an interesting flavor.  Carmelized the onion well (personal taste), and used more peanuts, but put them on the side in case guests didn't care for them.  Cilantro on the side too, just looked prettier to add the garnishes on top.

Fantastic. I finely grated my carrots, used powdered ginger instead of fresh (that's what I had in the cupboard), and used almonds instead of peanuts. I ground the almonds and toasted them in the oven before adding. Great dish!

This is fantastic! I usually make a double batch and it keeps well in the fridge. The carrot issue...I put my carrots in a food processor, then zap them in the microwave for about 2 to 3 minutes. They turn out perfect!

The overrall flavor of this recipe was good. I would however add more carrots and onions (I used green onions because it's what I had). But I will definetly make it again. Simple and healthy. Thanks for the recipe.

Awesome variation on plain rice, really pretty and full of flavor. I browned the onions before adding carrots and ginger and substituted Peanut oil for margarine. Will make again for sure!

Always a hit when I make it and goes well with sweet mains. Allow me to suggest the following pairing: Pineapple chicken tenders (search it on allrecipes.com)  I used the marinade (boiled, of course) on top of the rice and it was wonderful. This is the sauce:  1 cup pineapple juice 1/2 cup packed brown sugar 1/3 cup light soy sauce  Just boil that and pour it on. I also add garlic and ginger - whatever you like.

I thought this tasted a little too much like regular rice to bother with all of the steps.  But it isn't bad, just not very exciting.

Keeper!  I used 'instant' brown rice, and it was yummy, so I'm sure it's even better with basmati.  Thanks forthe recipe!

This recipe is easy and really delicious. I followed the recipe exactly the first time i made it and it was very good, i added fresh mushrooms and balsamic vinegar the next time just for a kick and it was fantastic! I think next time i will add chopped chicken to the onion step and make it a main dish casserole.  Lots and lots of ways to tweek but on it's own it was very good!

Sooo good! I didnt have any peanuts, but even without them this recipe was so flavorful. I used more rice than called for and it turned out great. ( about 2 cups).

Super easy to do and sooo much better than plain rice. I had cashews so used that instead of peanuts and added a little bit of soy sauce. IT IS GREAT!!

Delicious!  Used almonds and (half a big) red onion as someone else posted.  The cayenne was just the right amount of heat.  Tripled the ground ginger as I love ginger!  Cut down on the butter just to make it healthier.  My husband raved about it.  Next time I think I will add even more carrots.  Thanks for sharing!  We used it as a main dish, but it's a really interesting side.  Will definitely make again for company!

Simple and delicious, this offers a lot of flavor and not a lot of fat.  I made it just as instructed and it was wonderful.  We eat a lot of rice, so this was a nice change and it's definitely a recipe I'll call on again.

Very tasty.  I added a bit of curry powder along in with the cayenne and it gave it a really wonderful Indian flavor.  Definitely a recipe I'll make again.

This rice had such interesting flavor combinations, I was a little scared to try it.  1/4 cup of peanuts looks like a lot more once it is blended!  The overall result was fantastic, though.  My husband and I both really enjoyed this rice.

Goodness this was yummy!  Didn't have fresh ginger so used powder.  This is a better option for me as my kids don't like the strong flavor of fresh ginger.  My 6 year old son ate 2 huge servings and went on and on about how good it was.  Definately try this recipe!  You won't be disappointed!

I followed this recipe exactly and found it to be good , not great.  It turned out a little dry so I had to add some chicken broth before I served it.  I will make it again but next time I'll add some minced garlic and a little soy sauce.

I love this recipe. I was shocked at how easy yet good it was.. I did make a couple adjustments. I used a lot more ginger and added garlic because I add it to everything. I also used my rice cooker for the rice. This is a great recipe. Thanks for sharing!

This was totally delicious!  I used long grain white rice instead of basmati (because it's all I had in the pantry) but otherwise followed the recipe to the letter and it turned out fantastic.  I will certainly be making this again.

Simple but very delicious!  My son is allergic to peanuts so I substituted sliced almonds and it turned out great.  If you really like the taste of ginger, you could add a little more than the recipe calls for.

Very nice.  Used jasmine rice and sesame seeds since that was what I had in stock.  I also use coconut milk for the rice - gives it a sweet flavor.  This turned out great.  Don't use too much ginger like I did, but fresh is the best.  Thanks for a great dish.

Very easy to make.  Hubby was not fond of it, but I thought it an interesting change from steamed rice.  I sometimes use coconut milk to cook the rice, and I think I'll try that next time!

We loved it!! I used chicken stock instead of water to boil the rice and that added a lot of flavor. I also subbed cashews instead of peanuts. I'll probably make this again soon..

Great recipe!  Nice change to the traditional rice and the flavors all worked so well together!  If I make it again I might add more ginger to give it a little more punch.

I served this alongside a very heavy red-lentil curry, and its lightness and simple-without-being-boring taste was a perfect partner dish! However, while it's great on its own I'm trying to see how else to add to it.  If you're feeling a bit unhealthy (and willing to genre-mix) soy sauce might do the trick, but at the cost of masking the subtle salty/sweet/spicy flavor.  For me, the next time I'll cook this I'll add some raisins, keep the peanuts a little more coarsely chopped, and when everything gets mixed together add a dash of peanut oil to the pan to fry rice a bit.  Oh, and I definitely agree with what others have said - let it sit together for as long as possible before you serve!  Really, this only gets better with time to blend.

Barley was used in place of the riceso for one cup of it, I had to use 3 1/2 cups of water.  With that volume, I doubled the other ingredients.  I did not grind the peanuts.  This made a good vegetarian meal.

I just finished serving this to my extended family for dinner, along with barbequed chicken and roasted brocoli.  Everyone (including myself) thought it was delicious.  The combination of flavors is unusual but very good.  The only thing I did differently was to cook the rice in chicken broth instead of water, which I really think gives the rice more flavor & richness.  This recipe is a great alternative to plain rice.  I will definitely make this again.  Thanks!

This recipe is really original and ties in random ingredients that i would never put together but together tastes like one great party in your mouth. i didnt pulverize the peanuts, just crushed them by hand and added extra carrots and some garlic. needs a bunch of salt. delicious, thanks.

I was really surprised at how good this is, especially since it's pretty easy to make.  I've made it twice now and the second time was out of fresh ginger so I just used lots of powdered ginger instead.  Use the fresh ginger if you can.

Followed this recipe exactly and it was delightful. The peanuts add a surprising crunch which works well with the carrots, and the ginger really flavors it up nicely. This was a test run and we've decided to serve it for our dinner party this weekend as a side dish to plank cooked salmon. Thanks for exactly what we were looking for!

This recipe is a delicious way to dress up rice when you are bored with plain. I've made this multiple times to serve with curry or chinese style main dishes, especially ones that are heavy on the meat and light on the veggies.

Great flavor!!!! Didn't have ginger root, so I just used powder and it turn out just as good, also added some mushroom I had on hand - trying to clean out the fridge :0). To cut out the time I used instant rice and came out just as great. Will cook it again!

Used natural peanut butter. I think I'd do it with a less rice / more veg ratio next time, although was fine as is. Nice way to use up carrots and cilantro. I gave it a shot of sriracha as well.

So delicious and a totally fun way to make a rice pilaf. Used shallots for the onion type,  shredded the ginger along with the carrots so it wouldn't be crunchy as another reviewer mentioned. Didn't trust my mincing abilities anyways.. lol. Thanks for the recipe! Going to be a staple in our house now.

I was not thrilled with this recipe. It had a lot of ingredients that sounded great together but I found it bland. Not much flavor to it at all. May try it again sometime with a bit of teriaki or soy sauce added in.

This recipe is a keeper! I used whole, smashed garlic cloves instead of onion (remove before serving), powdered ginger because I didn't have fresh, and Korean red pepper flakes instead of cayenne.  I also didn't have cilantro, but that would have taken it to the next level.

I did not add the nuts. I used virgin coconut oil to fry a batch of green onions, the grated carrots with a subtle 1/3 tsp of powdered ginger and the same of dried cilantro my leftover white rice from last night's Chinese take-out. I added so much rice that I had to up the amount of coconut oil, to get it to be not as dry. The coconut flavor and aroma was great in this dish! Everyone raved.

I used 2 cups of riced cauliflower instead of basmati rice because I watch my carbs, I also added extra carrots and used 1 TBS grated ginger root.  I didn’t have cilantro but I thought it tasted really well without it.  Fixed this as a side dish to a pork tenderloin roast. Everyone enjoyed it.

It's good. It was a bit of a mixed reaction. Some people really liked it, others, not so much. If you don't really like ginger, you won't like it. I thought it was a pretty healthy and easy to make side dish.

Really loved this rice and it just might be a regular side with my meals now. I used the almonds instead of the peanuts and the ginger really added that extra flavor.

I paired this with Baked Teriyaki Chicken (also on here) and it was delicious!  Red onion and dried cilantro was all I had, but it worked great!  Also, I sautéed everything in the pan and added it to the rice pot instead of adding rice to sauté pan (just an easier clean up and it mixes better when fluffing rice).  I would like to try this with Jasmine rice for the extra flowery flavor JasRice will bring to the dish.

I loved it.  Peanutty flavor, good to use up the fresh carrots I had, and quick and easy.  My roommate didn’t care for it, but if it’s not plain she doesn’t like it.  I would make it again.

This was absolutely horrible - I would give it no stars if I could. The basmati rice was one huge clump, making it difficult to mix anything else in. Then I originally made it exactly as written but it was tasteless. so I started squeezing fresh lime and lemon juices over it to try and add flavor. I even added scrambled egg and ham in an attempt to turn it into a fried rice, which my boys love. One wouldn't eat it, the other ate a small portion, and the adults soldiered though because its all we had for dinner. Terribly disappointed as it was so highly rated.

Swapped out margarine for butter. I don't eat cilantro, so I left it out. I changed out the peanuts for almonds as another reviewer suggested.  I will make this again! Typically, I only like plain, steamed rice, but this was really good.

Great way to add some pizzazz to rice.  I omitted the peanuts, added more salt, and also added about a cup of golden raisins.  The raisins added the burst of sweetness that I think the carrots alone cannot accomplish, and also made a great contrast to the spice of the ginger.

Really flavourful rice.  A couple differences from the recipe, I used Jasmine rice and ground ginger and I accidentally forgot to add the peanuts.  Regardless, this is a total keeper.  I served it with Chef John's Meatless Meatballs and it was a perfect combination.  I have 3 teenagers - they all said they will definitely eat this again.

The hardest part about this is grating the carrots.  Otherwise, very simple and tasty dish.  I doubled the carrots using the medium grate on my grater.  I simply eyeballed the ginger but probably added extra (how did it take me this long to learn about freezing ginger and grating as needed? Wow, is that easy).  I also did a heaping 1/4 cup of peanuts, and didn't quite use all the cooked rice as I wanted a more vegetable dish than rice.  It is so good!  I noticed some added chicken broth in, but I don't think that would add to it - at least in my opinion.  I followed the comments/directions to cover the pan after adding the carrots and ginger to let them steam to softness.  I actually turned the heat off entirely during that time and just let it sit for the full five minutes.  The carrots were soft and there was some moisture still remaining when I removed the lid.   I typically like to doctor things up, but this, for me, is one of a few that I think I like the way it is (but with more carrots!).   Quite satisfying.

This was a success! I didn't have the peanuts or cilantro, so I added chopped celery with the onion, and parsley. Everyone liked it!

This is a go to in my house.  I don't change anything but I use a little less ginger than it calls for.  Keeping it covered and on LOW heat while cooking the carrots is crucial.

To try my new instant pressure cooker pot, I tried this using what vegetables I had. On sauté setting I cooked chopped green onion and celery in a little oil, then added sliced almonds, and later 2 cups jasmine rice. After sautéing slightly, I added 2 1/2 cups of chicken broth (I had just boiled chicken) in to the pot, 1 t of chicken bouillon powder, stirred everything together and set the pot to rice setting. This cooked for 15 min after reaching the steam setting. The rice was light and not gummed together like it sometimes does for me when cooked on the stove top. We enjoyed the dish and I want to try it next time with the carrot and ginger. Thank you for such a fun and versatile recipe that lends itself well to so many diff veggies. Bet it would also be good with either green beans or peas and carrots or mushrooms.

I cheated and used the basmati you microwave in the bag and I used ground ginger.  I served with baked chicken breast.  I recommend running the carrot the day before with your food processor and this recipe turns absolutely no hassle.

This was a truly great recipe!!  Easy to make, delicious and so colorful.  Will definitely be making many times over.  For the rice portion I chose to use Chef John's oven method since I do not seem to make great rice in a pot.  I just halved his recipe and made in an 8x8 pan and used chicken broth instead of the noted water in this recipe.  I used almonds instead of peanuts but both are great I'm sure.  The ginger is subtle but adds such a nice touch.  This is definitely a 5 star recipe.

I can't leave a recipe alone, so this is what I did to enhance the original recipe. Used olive oil & butter instead of margarine; added chopped kale with the onions; 2 cloves of minced garlic and 1/2 chopped tomato along with ginger; cashews & almonds instead of peanuts; and drizzled sesame oil over the entire dish when it was all put together.  The above ingredients were for two servings. It was very yummy.

I made the version in the Allrecipes Magazine. A tad spicy for me- I would scale back the cayenne next time. Great flavor and a good way to add some extra veggies to dinner.

I've made this recipe twice now.  It is very good!  I never add the peanuts or the cilantro because thi9se are just not something that I have in my pantry on a regular basis.  But I will definitely be making it again.  Good recipe!

Soooooo good. You have to use fresh ginger and grate it like the carrots. I also was in a hurry and forgot the cayenne but added saffron seasoning. I used brown rice to make it even more healthy. It was AWESOME  I used toasted almond slivers instead of peanuts. The peanuts were not appealing to me. I added frozen English peas as well because I saw it in some photos. This one is a definite must have to jazz up the rice. The kids and husband loved it as well. Thanks!

This rice is yummy. I didn't have peanuts on hand so I used cashews which are very yummy and I left out the cayenne for the kids and the cilantro for my husband, but I am sure it's delicious with both! I also added some shelled edamame and it was wonderful. Excellent leftovers too.

I'm sure after a few more tries with further tweaking this will be a keeper. Unfortunately my first attempt was a disappointment. I sauteed the onion with some chicken broth as well as a glop of ginger-garlic paste, so I didn't add any ginger with the carrots. Probably next time I will try it in the correct order. I used leftover quinoa and brown rice, along with a mixture of dry roasted (salted) peanuts and raw cashews. I added the cayenne to the nuts beforehand and I liked the spice and texture. Looking forward to tasting it after a night in the fridge to better meld the flavours!

I loved this dish. I used blood orange infused olive oil instead of butter to saute the vegetables in. I also used cashews instead of peanuts because that is what I had. I bought matchstick carrots and put all the vegetables plus the cashews into the food processor for a quick chop. I used powdered ginger for convenience. This was delicious and I now make once a week!

Love this recipe!  Only changes to make it a bit healthier are any other nut than peanuts and coconut oil instead of margarine.  I often add extra veggies and make this as a full meal deal- yummy.

Very good.  The rice cooked perfectly following the instructions as written, but with just barely enough water to work, and I had used 2 cups rather than 1.5.  Keep a close nose to it as it nears the end.  Mine singed a tad before I realized it.  It was still excellent, particularly paired with the curry I made.

After watching a movie called "The 100 Foot Journey" I been wanting to make a true Indian cuisine dinner!  So after searching for a side dish to go with the Indian Curry Chicken I also found on this site, I chose this rice. Since I have never tried Basmati rice before, I thought heck, why not and go all the way!!  I followed the recipe exact, no short cuts.....this is amazing. It yells Indian Culture with every bite!!  Thanks so much for sharing, this  is my new favorite rice and will save this recipe to compliment many other dishes in the near future!!

I would make this again, but add more carrots. I roasted raw peanuts for it and the flavor was great. It made up for my using powdered ginger. Also did not use margarine, but sunflower oil.

Being an Indian student in the US we miss the food at home. Thank you so much for this wonderful recipe ??. I was sick of eating lemon rice for a week.

I think this was a nice take on rice. I made it kind of bland but it was still enjoyable.  The carrots, ginger and peanuts were a nice addition variety to the plain ol' rice. I doubled the recipe so I could freeze half for near future sides to meals since this did take effort to make. Might as well make it in bulk!

I followed others' suggestions and added a little more cayenne, which I threw in with the onions, carrots and chicken broth. I also added about 1/2 c. to 3/4 c. raisins, which were really good with the otherwise spicy/savory rice. Next time I want to add cinnamon. This is a good base recipe that you can do a lot with.

Delicious!  I didn't have peanuts, so I used pine nuts.  I also used ghee (clarified butter) instead of margarine, and I grated the ginger.   Will definitely make again.

Yummy. I also added frozen peas along with the carrots and used ghee instead of margarine because....well it's real BUTTER! Also whenever your working with basmati rice, you want to rinse it a few times to get rid of the extra starch and keep it from sticking.

I have made this recipe at least 6 times now. I love it and cook when  I don't have a lot of fresh produce left.  I never have peanuts on hand but it tastes fantastic without it. It doesn't need to be modified at all

This is really good. I made several substitutions because of what I had on hand. I substituted Jasmine rice, olive oil, chopped cashews, 3/4 tsp ground ginger and left out the cilantro but that would have made a good garnishment.

I cooked this recipe twice already. The first time, I cooked it exactly as written and it was good. But the second time I made it, cooked my regular white rice in chicken broth, I added garlic, upped the shredded carrots to a heaping 1 cup, was generous with the grated ginger (used my zester) substituted butter instead of margarine and lightly crumbled the peanuts. Added more chicken broth as necessary at the end when combing rice with veggies. I think this is a great recipe which is easy and versatile. It's on my keeper list.

Definitely a keeper.
I use this recipe whenever I have guests over, or when I am taking something for a dish party.
I make it exactly as described....and it never failed to impress my friends and guests.

I am constantly looking for new recipes for work that settle on my stomach and came across this recipe and omg Basmati rice has officially become my favourite rice! I did not make any major changes but I added unsalted cashews instead of peanuts and the second time around I will be adding shredded zucchini and chives with half an onion instead of a whole one (chives to add that touch of wow) ??

I really enjoyed this. Made it with about 1 1/2 cups grated carrots, ginger paste (found in refrigerator section) and slivered almonds. Didn't have cilantro so left it out but I think it would taste great with it. Also used jasmine rice since that's all I had and still turned out great. Made this as a side dish to the apricot chicken also found on this website and drizzled that sauce over the rice (on my plate) which made it even more wonderful!

I really like plain rice, but I was very impressed with this recipe. The flavors were subtle and not over-powering, yet still very tasty! I made it exactly to the recipe, except that I used a mixture of red and green onion rather than regular. It was a very simple and relatively fast recipe to make, too, which is a bonus.

It was OK. I would give it 3.5 stars. Taste was very mild. Hubby liked it, my two toddlers did not. IMO, not tasty enough to warrant making again given the extra work of grating the carrots.

Very yummy. Using what I alreqdy had on hand, I used short white rice, chili powder instead of cayenne pepper, reduced to only 1/4 of an onion, and garnished with fresh Thai basil instead of cilantro. I'll be making this again!

super yummy. used real butter, home-grown carrots, and short-grain brown rice from the rice cooker and it was perfect. the crunchy/sweet/spicy/buttery flavors are a great combination. will be a staple and i plan to bring it to potlucks because in addition to being delicious, it's very pretty! yay.

Tasty and the best way I've found to sneak carrots into my carrot hating 83 year old father.  I do increase the amount of shredded carrot because of him but we all love the tast.

This is a wonderful side dish.  It's also a great way to sneak carrots and onion into your meals.

I used instant white rice & this was phenominal!  I loved the peanuts in this dish.  I also used 3/4 tsp of ginger powder as someone else suggested.   Very good and a fun one to cook.

wonderful balance of flavors and nice presentation.  I made this to go alongside my favorite Jerk Chicken (recipe shared begrudgely by Negril's best jerk house to me after 2wks of pleading), and island greens also shared by Jamaican's best jerk house, not so begrudgely.  Paired perfectly with island cuisine, oriental or a plain roasted chicken.  First attempt made as is and is a 5 star in taste.  Next time may try purple onion and either small amount of roasted red bell pepper for color with the orange carrots and green cilantro but is really great the way it's written! Thanks for sharing.

We liked this a lot.  It's a nice change from the usual rice sides. I didn't have fresh ginger root, so used about a teaspoon of ground ginger. I also added about 1/2 cup of water and 1/2 teaspoon of chicken bouillon to the onions/carrots for the 5 minute steaming phase. We did have to add more salt and pepper while eating it, so I'll be sure to put more in while cooking next time.  Overall, it trned out great!

I have now made this dish several times and have to say it's a hit with everyone that's eaten it. It goes with most dishes I make for dinner and especially with BBQ rotisserie chicken. I have tried to cut the recipe but decided that it is a wonderful leftover side dish for the next day.

This was pretty good. I used chicken broth in place of the water and almonds instead of the peanuts because I didn't have any. It was a lot of work for only OK flavor.

This was so good.  The only thing we did differently was chop the nuts.  We like crunchy.  The kids liked it too.  Will definitly add to "keep" list.

I just finished this recipe and like the other reviews state, the presentation is just beautiful! My family does tend to like sweeter rice, so I added some sugar along with the salt for a slightly sweet taste. We did however omit the peanuts, I couldn't get my husband to be in agreement with me on that. Also I left the cilantro on the side for everyone to choose in their own moderation.

I left the salt out and added a bit of soy sauce at the end to give it a bite more flavor. I also added mushrooms with the onions.

Very bland dish.  And even more bland the next day.  I'm a rice-aholic but couldn't seem to spice this one up no matter what I added or took away.  Pretty to dish up but might as well be eating a non-tasty rice cake...

This was a delish dish.  I actually made it with long grain brown rice and it was good but I'm positive it was meant for basmati rice.  It would have been even better.  I steamed the carrots and ginger in chicken broth and was light on the cayenne.  Also, I used almonds instead of peanuts.

Very flavourful way to serve rice.  My only substitution was minced almonds instead of peanuts and green onions rather than 1 sliced onion.  My family enjoyed the recipe and it is a great way to increase the number of vegetable servings at a meal.

Absolutely delicious!  This is the first review that I've written on this site and I've been a member for years. I didn't use any peanuts or cilantro and it still turned out great!

Absolutely delicious!  I'm always trying new variations on rice, and this is a new favorite.  I used plain white rice since that's all I had on hand, and cooked it in my rice cooker with a bit of a sesame seed/seaweed spice blend, with a bit of ground ginger.  Also added a few raisins in with the onion-carrot mix (golden raisins would be better still).  All else according to recipe - and it is so addictingly good!

This rice was fantastic. We used it as a side dish to the coriander chicken with mango salsa. One suggestion concerning the rice is too add a little bit extra water since this specific rice can soak up a lot.

My family enjoyed this recipe.  It is labor intensive to shred the carrots but that's what you have children for. LOL!!! My daughter handled the carrots.  Much better than plain white rice.  This will remain in my rotation.

I thought this was interesting.  If I make it again I will up the amount of cayenne- I just used a pinch fearing it would be to spicy and I will add a tad more salt.  Very nice subtle ginger flavor with this one.  Thanks for sharing.

I really wanted to like this and was looking forward to making it, but was disappointed to find that I wasn't too crazy about it.  Maybe I didn't do something quite right, maybe I'll try again sometime.

A simple but delicious dish. I served this with "Perfect Sesame Chicken," and they complimented each other beautifully. I was out of basmati rice and used brown rice instead but still thought this was wonderful.

UPDATE: MADE THIS AGAIN, THIS TIME TO ACCOMPANY REBECCADK'S ZIPPY SUMMER SHRIMP. THIS WAS NOT THE SAME BLEH, UNBALANCED RICE DISH THAT I REMEMBERED! I DON'T KNOW IF IT WAS DUE TO THE ZIP FROM MY SHRIMP OR IF MY TASTE BUDS HAVE CHANGED, BUT THIS WAS SPOT ON. I LOVED EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS AND WOULDN'T CHANGE A THING!!!  THIS WILL BE ADDED TO MY PERMANENT "KEEPER" FILE FOR SURE! Eh. This was so-so. My fiance liked this more than I did, but wouldn't miss it if I didn't make it again (sorry!). I was expecting a LOT of flavor, but oddly enough, this was lacking in that department.... Despite the lack of spice, I thought the onion, carrot, ginger, peanuts and (aromatic) basmati rice would liven this up. Nope. The taste of each component was barely noticeable, but (subtly) strong enough to leave you wanting more of each. If there were a way to enhance this, I'd be all for a repeat. Perhaps chopped apricots or golden raisins would be a nice addition? Tip: If you have a hand-held cheese grater, use it to shred your carrots. I have a food processor for this task, but didn't feel like digging it out for less than a cup's worth of carrots. With a little elbow grease (lol), my handy grater worked like a charm! Served with Thai pork with peanut sauce (JDOERINGPA), the two paired nicely together. Thanks for sharing your recipe, Sowyma! :-)

I used a considerable amount of cayenne, increased slightly the amount of peanuts and used dried ginger (also increased the amount) instead of fresh.  I ended up with a spicy dish that was quite enjoyable.

Wow, this was really a meal in its self and not just a side dish.  I loved the nutty flavoring combined with the ginger!  Of course I added fresh garlic to it because I am a garlic fanatic.

Very delicious and full of flavor! (the flavor the peanuts add is great) I used butter and added a bit more than the recipe called for.  I also added some all-purpose seasoned salt at the end to taste.  Maybe next time I will add something that will give it a little crunch too.  I will definitely be making this again!

Very yummy, exotic, and spicy. I followed the recipe exactly, except I doubled the amount of rice. It was a great side dish. We ate it with a bit of soy sauce on it. Next time, I would reduce the onion to half and may add a beaten egg at the end --in order to turn it into fried rice.

Good, but a bit on the bland side. This worked with falafel pitas, but I had to add Siracha to make it interesting. The peanuts were a good addition... nice, unique addition.

I LOVE this recipe!  I originally made it as a side dish for a luau.  It went perfectly with the Oven Kahlua Pork and fresh fruit.  I've made it many times and it is a great tasting side for almost anything!  My only change is to just chop the peanuts so there is more texture.  Even my 4 and 6 year old girls love this dish.

I've had this recipe in my recipe box for 8 months and I finally got around to making it.  I loved it!  I'm a huge fan of basmati rice and the flavor with the onion, carrots and ginger is WONDERFUL!  I didn't measure the cayenne pepper, I just estimated so next I will measure because it was actually more spicy than I thought it would be.  This will definitely make our recipe rotation!

This was GREAT. I made it as a side dish for Tasty Fried Eggplant Balls (also on here) and it turned out really nicely. Super quick too! I left out the cayenne because I didn't have any, but this recipe could definitely benefit from a little heat. I scaled it down to two servings, and the only thing I'd change is the amounts of ginger and chopped peanuts. (more of both!) Nice color, looks great on the plate, and adds a lot to the meal. Definitely adding this to the "make again soon" file.

Nice side dish. Followed the recipe as stated except I was too lazy to pulverize the peanuts so I just added in a tablespoon of organic peanut butter. Also did not used margarine just used a cooking oil.

This was awesome and received raves!  The peanuts really give it a different kind of flavor.  I used brown basamati rice and 1.5 cups frozen petit peas instead of carrots (didn't have any) and didn't use the cilantro (again, didn't have it.)  Will definitely make again!  Thanks for sharing.

This was good, but I had to add a couple TBSP of soy sauce because I just didn't think there was enough flavor.  I liked it after my addition and served if along side grilled cilantro salmon recipe from this site.

I loved this rice.  I didn't have fresh ginger root so I had to use powdered, however, it was still yummy.  Can't wait to try it with the fresh ginger.

This is so good and easy to make. I made this using chicken broth and without, definitely liked it a little better with the chicken broth. However I didn't add the nuts or cilantro and was wonderful.

Although I made a few changes from the original recipe, this rice was still awesome. I used regular rice because I was out of basmati, omitted the peanuts, used dried ginger, used a heaping cup of grated carrots, and added a few tablespoons of extra butter. I will keep making it this way because the fam said it was the best rice they've ever had, but I do look forward to trying it with basmati rice some day. Thanks for the great recipe!

This rice is a very versatile side dish for a lot of main dishes.  I have made it multiple times, both according to the recipe and with modifications.  It's one of those recipes you can make to the letter and still have a yummy dish, unlike a lot of the Allrecipes recipes that everyone loves with just a few modifications.  However, this dish lends itself well to modifications, so feel free to change it up.

I thought this recipe was really good! I used normal long-grained white rice, not basmati, but it seemed to turn out fine! I added more carrots then it called for, and I also added a bit more ginger... Which I think over powered the other flavors alot. Overall, really good!

This was delicious!! My boyfriend and I both went for seconds!...I followed the recipe by the letter except for the peanuts (I crushed them in a ziplock bag instead of putting them in the blender) this gave the recipe a nice crunchy taste at the end.  I will definitely make this again.

My husband and I really enjoyed this and he's not a big rice eater.  I did make some small modifications that I think helped with the flavor.  I cooked the rice in chicken broth instead of water.  For the onion and carrot mixture I used soy sauce instead of salt and I squeezed the juice of one lime into the mixture right before I added the rice.  Don't omit the peanuts - they make the recipe.  I served this with the Maple Salmon recipe from this site along with roasted brussel sprouts - Terrific meal. My mouth is watering just thinking about it!

This rice was ok. I used Jasmin rice instead of basmati since that was what I had, ground ginger & left out the peanuts since my husband didn't want me to put them in & didn't put in any cayenne pepper since I didn't have any. I would say only make this if you are going to make it exactly according to  the recipe. It just didn't impress me but it had to be because I left so many stuff out. Thanks anyways

Delicious way to spice up plain rice! I made several changes since I just worked with what I already had on hand: I used brown rice, almonds instead of peanuts, and 1 tsp of ground ginger instead of fresh ginger. I didn't have any carrots so I left that out but I did sautee a chopped yellow onion. Finally, to add a bit of Fall flavor, I added a 1/4 cup of raisins and a dash of allspice.  Fantastic!! I'll definately make it again!

Rather enjoyed this and so did my 14 year old. I didn't have any fresh ginger so I used garlic, tasty. Thankyou.

A nice alternative to plain rice, and a good way to add in some veggies, but nothing spectacular. I might make again for the family, but definitely not for guests.

I'm not sure if this is an authentic Indian recipe or not, but at the bare minimum, it has an exotic Indian flair, perfumed but not cloying.  And the color is just a beautiful golden orange hue.  So great to have another wonderful rice recipe.  Thanks!

Not sure what happened- but we didnt' care for it too much.  The texture was off (a littly too mushy), but I attribute that to my poor rice cooking abilities.  The flavor was ok, but not thrilling.  My hubby thought it was a strange combo.

My husband AND my kids LOVED this recipe.  Ok, so did I, but I always like what I cook!  :)  A great family pleaser and an amazing addition to the easily boring starchy side dish!

Wasn't a real winner.   Seemed a little too boring for our family.  Any ideas how to spice this one up?  Go for it!!!

The taste of peanuts is what makes this recipe exceptionally good. It gives the rice a bit of a crunch.

This was awesome. My dad loved it so much, which surprised me since he doesn't usually like anything out of the ordinary. It had a southeast Asian flair with the peanuts and cayenne pepper.

This turned out great.  If you're like me and you can't eat spicy just tone down the cayenne at the end.

Delicious, easy.  Used 1/4 c. chunky peanut butter = lots of peanut flavor.
