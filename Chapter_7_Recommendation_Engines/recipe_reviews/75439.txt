Took this to a dinner party as an appetizer- it was a huge hit! I pressed the tartar into a bowl to create a mold, flipped in onto a small dish and served on a platter with sesame wontons which they devoured. I also substituted 1tbls. of tamari for oil and added a tsp. of chopped onions. Sesame wontons are easy: cut wontons diagonally to make triangles.(Make at least 48pcs. people love them!) Arrange on a cookie sheet with parchment(or lightly oiled). Spray or brush lightly with olive oil and sprinkle sesame seeds. Bake at 350degrees for 5-6 minutes.

I've tried this twice and it's really a good recipe.  The second time I used white sesame oil instead of the olive oil and also added a bit of thinly sliced green onions and just a bit of finely minced garlic.  Great both ways!

Right up our alley Joelle!! Fantastic recipe for a family like ours who have recently been eating a lot of raw tuna and lovin' every bite of it. I slightly toasted the sesame seeds and the french bread. Makes a great appetizer too. Thanks so much!!

I made this as written and it is very, very bland which is not what I was looking for. I doctored it up w/ some soy sauce, chopped sweet onions, and nori furikake and it tasted much better.

Great recipe for fresh tuna. I really liked the simplicity of the dish! SO easy. I would have liked an additional flavor to the tar tar, however. I'm not sure what it might be, but I will definitely experiment with this again. 06/20: I tried this out on my boyfriends best friend, aka the human garbage disposal. He LOVED this with extra wasabi paste added to the top. He said that if I ever make this again to call him, he'll devour it.

Really good recipe! I like to dice half an avacado to toss in, adds a nice balancing flavor.

Great recipe but too bland. I doubled the amount of Wasabi powder, added soy sauce, lemon and ginger (paste). Result was delicious.

The recipe as is, is somewhat bland. I took the suggestions from the other reviewers and added 1 scallion, 2 tsp tamari sauce and subbed one tbs of sesame oil for olive oil. It was very good...  Would add another 1/4 tsp wasabi next time. This is definitely a keeper!

I made this and took Fun Foody's advice and did the won to wrapper thing.  I used wasabi powder and it wasn't very spicy. It all turned out pretty good. I am in Tx.  I can't wait to go to California and make this with some really fresh Tuna.

This recipe was a good base, but I knew some things had to be adjusted to ensure a more flavorful dish.  I replaced the olive oil with toasted sesame oil, added some green onions and about a teaspoon of minced garlic, and added a tablespoon of rice vinegar.  The mixture chilled for at least an hour before serving.

I served it with homemade corn tortilla chips, but wontons would be fantastic too.  I also served it with diced avocado on the side as an optional add-on.
