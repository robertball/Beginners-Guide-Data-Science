I love this recipe, it’s seriously addictive. I have made it several times. The mascarpone filling is too sweet for my taste so I like to cut the sugar in half to 1/2c.  You can always add more sugar until it’s to your desired sweetness.  I also add 1/4 tsp cinnamon and usually cut out the nutmeg but it’s good added too.  I find I have a lot of leftover glaze so I cut all those ingredients in half as well.  I like the taste of the tart better the next day but the glaze can make the crust mushy if you use too much.  The recipe fills up two 8” springform pans with no crust leftover. Looks beautiful when it’s removed from the pan.

Quite simple to make, and very tasty. I split the recipe as I only needed one tart. Baking the shell took 6 - 8 minutes longer for me to get it golden brown.

Everyone loved it. I have made it a few times now. I added an apricot glaze to the top of the crust to prevent sogginess and then added the same glaze to the fruit to give it a beautiful shine .
