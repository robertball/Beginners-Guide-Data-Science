I am a Native American and this is the closest I have come to finding a recipe that tastes like my grandmother's recipe! Be careful you don't knead it too much tho, as too much kneading will make it tough!! We now use this when we crave a taste of the famous 'pow-wow' hamburgers, also use it as a base for 'Indian tacos' topping with seasoned hamburger, and other taco fillings, and so much more! Thanx Rita, it brought a taste of 'home' to me.

My entire family is Native American from the West Coast/and Alaska and this recipe is very close to how we make it.  You know good FRYBREAD, when it tastes good without anything on it yet!  Also, for those that come out with tough dough or crackers, you've kneaded and worked with it too long or added too much flour in.  As for cooking FRYBREAD; I always try and use my old black cooking skillet, it keeps the temperature of the oil or shortening more consistent.

I usually make my bread without a recipe, because I have made it for since I was a small child, this is the closest recipe that I have found, I will just adapt it to the way I make it, if i am making fry bread for Indian Tacos i do not use sugar, if I am just making it to make to have with butter and jam I use sugar, and sometimes yeast to make it really fluffy, just remember not to over knead or your kids will have Native footballs ha ha,I usually let my dough rest while my oil or grease is getting hot,just remember fry bread is distinctive food and  as native cook and  live in Washington, from Montana,  fry bread is a  food that was made from commodities that were given to us Native's by the US government, we did not have all the extra stuff people are using now, depending on where you live and are from U.S. or Canada you have fry bread or Bannock, Bannock from Canada is made with bacon grease usually, and U.S. made is usually Flour, Salt, Baking Powder, there are some changes with different tribes,some use, powdered milk, maybe yeast,sugar and sometimes baking soda, we didn't have ice water, and kosher salt etc.. , Fry Bread is Fry Bread totally native style, and yes you can use chili con carne as a topper to make tacos, split it and make Indian Burgers, roll the dough around a hot dog make Indian Dogs, or you can top it with pizza sauce and your favorite cheese and pizza toppings you have a Indian pizza, fry bread is adaptable as the stuff used to make it, have fun and en

I am Native and I use this recipe. I add a little more salt, about 3 table spoons of sugar and about 3/4 tablespoon of yeast. I never measure...really, but I get 2-3 batches of frybread out of a package of yeast.  The secret to good fry bread is in the mixing. The only way I have ever eaten good frybread was when my grandmothers or myself pushed all the dry ingredients to the side of the bowl, and poured the water in the middle. Then using your spoon, we just go around the bowl and scrape more flour into the water until all is mixed. Then as soon as it is mixed totally, don't mix it anymore! :) We take pieces out of the bowl and have a little flour on the counter and set it on there to dust it and make it not stick to your fingers. Then just work around the frybread carefully making your circle shape. I've never rolled out my fread, made them into balls, or flattened them into patties. I think the secret is in the hand prep...shaping each individual one with care to not rip it. Good recipe. Thats all you need for frybread! We just like ours all poofy! Don't forget when you make the first one, as soon as it is cool, give everyone around you a bite of the first one. My kids just hover waiting for a piece of the first one. Then, put paper towels (or newspaper! LOL!) into the bottom of a paper bag, and drop your frybread in there when your done. Thats what we have always done in our extended family! :)

I cut this recipe in half to get 6 fry breads. I did add just a little more salt than what was called for. I sprinkled a little flour over the counter before patting my bread balls out to keep them from sticking. They flattened really well, I didn't need a rolling pin. I actually fried these in my cast iron skillet. These turned out absolutely perfect. I grew up eating fry bread as a child--this recipe totally took me back. The kids loved these, they fought over the leftover fry bread. NO LEFTOVERS. This is pure comfort food.

This is as close as you can get to authentic fry bread unless you learn how to make it from a native american.

My husband is Ottawa/Chippewa Indian and I have been with him for 34 years and he has always made our Indian Bread and everyone just loves it. He even makes it better than all his sisters do and most restaurants that serve it out west. This recipe uses the same ingredients, but only one thing he does is instead of making the dough into balls he makes the dough sticky and takes spoonfuls and pats it into flour (so its not sticking on the counter or cutting board) top and bottom then pokes small holes all over it with a fork, then puts it in the hot oil, then poke a hole in the center. It comes out light and fluffy. Also put salt into the hot oil so it doesn't smoke as much because of the flour. Tastes good with Bean,Potato,& Hominy Soups. Delicious. He makes this when we are short on food, very filling and delicious.

Tasty little things! I've added honey and sugar to the batter for a sweeter version & I've tried them with other spices mixed in the batter for more of a flavor to go with dinner (thyme,sage and lemon peel even powdered romano and asiago cheese). Good any way you can make it.

Wonderful recipe.  I agree that this is the closest thing to Native american fry bread out there.  It is wonderful with honey and sugar, and also with a little salsa and lettuce.  ^^ Thanks for adding it!

I'm Navajo and I like using 1tsp. salt. Otherwise it's a little flat. Sometimes I'll add powdered milk or warm milk. Any true Navajo will swear only by using BlueBird Flour - comes in white linen bags.

Shape into the size of a tennis ball. Flatten. Starting from the edges use your fingers to stretch into a larger circle. Shape one hand into a fist and lay dough on top. Using other hand pull and turn like making a pizza. Or if you want to cheat, use a rolling pin to do most of the work.

Im part Native American and we grew up with this bread.  My parents have passed on and I was THRILLED to see this recipe with so many reviews.  This is a very easy recipe and also reminds me of Naan (India) bread, soft and yummy. I use expeller expressed coconut oil (no coconut flavor) as it does not smell up the house with oily odor.  I fry in virgin coconut oil (flavorful)
 if I want to sprinkle with sugar/cinnamon.  Tastes like a donut!

We had to add extra water to it and it was really thick after cooking.  Not as sweet as I am used to.

When I was a little girl, my Dad an I would eat at this restaurant that served Indian tacos. We loved them and were disappointed when the restaurant went out of business, but a few years ago, (It has been 16 years since then), my Dad called me and told me he had heard of a recipe for the tacos. He said I needed Fry Bread, so not having been familiar with this recipes before I was skeptical. But after I made it and topped it with my favorite toppings, the memories came flooding back. Thank you for this recipe! From me and my Dad!

Thank you for bringing me back to my childhood. More importantly, thank you for bringing my father back to his. My grandma use to make this all the time and when she passed away no one made it anymore, maybe once or twice. I made this for my dad and I and it was so sood it made him cry. Just like grandma's. Thank you for the memories!

This is such an easy and great recipe that my 13 year old has it mastered after 1 try. She made "Indian Tacos" for the family plus guests and had rave reviews. I have been using this recipe for several years and decided that it deserves a top notch review, if my kids are able to get the same results with it. Everyone wants a copy of the recipe. Try it out!

I really can't compare this to authentic fry bread (as I'm sure there are different home bases varieties), however, it seemed much like hard tack. I think you have to be really careful not to overknead, I would guess. Hmmmm. Not quite convinced about this recipe.

I live in NM where there are still a lot of Natives and one of my friends gave me a recipe for fry bread that is very similar to this. The only exception is using 1tsp salt instead of 1/2tsp. Also, add the liquid, whether you use milk or water, gradually, like making biscuits, only mixing until everything is together. You're not making cake, DO NOT USE AN ELECTRIC MIXER. Knead it all together by hand and stop when its all incorporated. When you fry, make sure the oil is at least 365 degrees. When it puffs up and rises, (about 1 min) flip it in the oil for a few seconds, then remove it. The bread is a basic plain bread. Change the oil you cook it in or add herbs if you want it more 'flavorful'. Corn taco shells are very plain until you add toppings, the same goes here. Whether it be cinnamon and sugar or beef and vegi's. Same with cornbread...very plain until you modify. This is a great recipe!

My family loved these.  I add a little sugar to the dough when making them for dessert.  Also, make sure to not work dough too much or they will turn out tough.

This was good.  I was going to rate it a 4 due to the slight baking powder taste I detected, but my daughter insisted that I rate it a 5!!  I wonder if I should have let it rest a while before forming patties and frying- the ones I did last puffed up a little more than the first ones I fried.  All of my kids loved these.  We had these for dinner with Veggie Vegetarian Chili.

My grandmother taught me no measurements, but this is really close. She would use milk, if availible, but normally it was water. Also, salt to taste. Very good recipe.

This is a great fry bread recipe. I'm Native American, and this is almost exactly the recipe I was taught. For a nice twist, try topping it with your favorite chili and everything you'd put on tacos. It makes an amazing dinner.

Very good basic recipe.  I tried it with part wheat flour which also turned out very good.  I disagree with the yield being 12.  But I also like to make them larger for Navajo tacos in which case I would say the yield is more like 6-8.  For anyone saying that they turned out hard and/or crisp, they probably stretched the dough out too thin.  I did this on my first one, so the next one I didn't stretch out as much and it was perfect.  Very tasty.

I have a recipe I always use. But I wanted to try something different. I don't know what I did wrong. I made two batches, that didn't turn out. The dough was really lumpy and sticky. When I tried to make a ball, it stuck to my hands, I had to use flour to get the dough off, then it was too tough. I'll stick to my old stand by.

I've had better, but perhaps this is the most authentic in that it uses shortening/lard and water. Slightly heavy. It does taste much better made with milk. Went well with the chile verde from this site.

I grew up in Arizona where we had this all the time as a kid. We would get it at school and every fair or festival we went to, and we ate it with powdered sugar and honey. I've been craving this for awhile, and this was very similar to what I remembered. The instructions didn't give very much info on size, so I think mine turned out a little bigger than I would like. I'm sure it will get easier to judge size each time I make it. The recipe itself is so easy I already know I won't need the instructions next time and can make it by memory.

This recipe sounded the closes to my grandma's. So I tried it and it turned out thick and not so good. But I think I over worked the dough. I tried it again the next night and it was PERFECT! I LOVE fry bread and this is a nice simple recipe just the way its suppose to be.

Very easy and quite tasty just as it is. I use this recipe to make some delicious Indian tacos with refried beans, cheese, lettuce, tomatoes, and sour cream. My family begs me to make this dish. I personally found that over working it does make the texture chewier, however, the finished product is less greasy and easier to handle so, I purposely over knead it.

This is a great fry bread recipe. But its not just Native North American cuisine;) Eastern Europeans eat the same thing with versions slightly modified depending on family traditions and country. I would love to see (more like eat) a fry bread showdown between one Bosnian grandmother vs. one Navajo grandmother:)Happy Eating!!

was good, tasted just like the ones we had at a community pow wow. Topped 'em with chili and taco toppings, not honey and cinnamon.  No way would I use that much shortening, I just coated the bottom of a fry pan with oil- maybe 1 cup total.

Used milk in place of water, starting with 1 cup of warm milk, and then adding approx 1/3 to 1/2 more.  Let it rest for 45 minutes before forming.  Pretty good, but i think 1/2 tsp salt is not enough.  Next time I will use 1 tsp.  Hubby really liked it.

I too was raised on fry bread, and this recipe reminds me of my grandmother's. I use a cup of sifted whole wheat flour in this and fry it in coconut oil. Hardly traditional I know, but it is so light and delicious. My husband loves this. Reminds him of back home.

This was a great recipe, the kids helped make it. We doubled the recipe and made  Indian Taco and then drizzled honey over the few we had left. With 12 kids it's hard to find something everyone enjoys; this has become a new favorite if all.  Even fussy Daddy loves it.

Perfect for my tacos. the dough was super easy to work with, light. I used my Kitchenaid knead attachment until just pulled together. I tried pressing with hand but was easier and quicker to roll gently. Also place 3 slits in dough b4 frying. thanks.

This recipe really lacks any flavor and why not just fry up a tube of premaid biscuits.

I have had fry bread all of my life, and I never once used so much shortening!  You could also use a nice light oil...

For my picky girl, I added Cinnamon and Sugar to make it sweet for her, and she ate it as is.  Plus with a little powder sugar on top.  Good dessert for her.

So good! Mix the dough together slowly with nice folds, make your disks thin before frying. I think the next time I make it I will add a tablespoon of sugar!

my frybread turned out super flat and hard :/ I followed the directions...but I used canola oil instead of shortening... can that really make that big of a difference?

I thought this recipe was really good. I increased the salt, as other reviewers suggested and loved the flavor. Being that I've never made fry bread before, nor have I seen anyone else make it, I knew I'd have to experiment to get this to work for me. 

As soon as the dough came together, I split it in half so that I could experiment in small batches. You need to be careful not to overwork the dough or your bread will come out dense. Also, you want to fry at a high temperature in order to get the bread to bubble and rise. 

I think I might also try frying in oil rather than shortening next time because I'm hoping that will make the bread a little lighter. 

We used the bread as a base for pulled pork sandwiches and it was great. I will try the tacos next time. If I can get the dough to work out better next time, I'll change my rating to 5 stars, but until I work with the recipe more, I'm not sure if the density of the dough is my fault or if the recipe needs more tweaking.

I was looking for something similar to what I had in a restaurant years ago with taco toppings. This was nothing like that. These were heavy and tasteless. As they cooled they turned hard. I guess I am just a biscuits and scones type of gal.

On the indian reservation they make thesefor Pow Wows topped wih Chili, lettuce, tomatoes and sour cream. They make the size of a 7-8 inch paper plate. I know they put cream of tarter in them as well. I tried it this time with the recipe as stated, next time I'm gonna put equal parts cream of tarter and some sugar to sweeten them up.

Pretty good.  It was a bit bland, even though it was fried.  Also the finished bread ended up tough, which could have been my fault if I over handled the dough.  We ate the bread with Taco Soup and it was good dipped in the soup.

This came out great. I cut these in half like a pita bread and filled the middle with taco fillings for indian tacos. I used the rest of the fry bread with honey for sopapillas. A great recipe. I did let it rest about 10 minutes before forming the breads after I kneaded it approx 5 min. It even made 12 as specified.

Man, that was good! I fried it in Canola oil because we didn't have enough shortening, but I still covered it with honey, and it was awesome. In fact, I think I'll go have me another piece.

Great recipe, pretty authentic taste. Those who say it's bland need to understand that fry bread isn't some kind of funky new hipster bread. It's an old, old recipe for basic flour bread, plain and simple. 
If you don't over mix and only knead it a couple times before flattening with your hands (don't use a rolling pin), you will get a nice and tasty fry bread that puffs up a little when fried. *You don't need a lot of oil to fry either. The recipe calls for a lot of oil which is unnecessary. I just fry it in a frying pan with an inch of oil. 
The great thing about fry bread is that if you want sweet, add a tablespoon of sugar or honey. If you want savory, add your preferred spices.

I cut the recipe in half, but must have messed up somewhere. They are good, but was not as soft as I would like. The only thing I forgot was the hole. Could this be my problem? Also, how high should the heat be, and how long on each side?

OH YEAH! This recipe is great! I did use more salt and flour at the end. If you use this measurement it WILL come out flat. I halved the recipe except the salt. If youre looking for ORIGINAL and simple, this is the recipe for you. I grew up in NM and being indian and mexican myself this is as original as u can get. People dont realize the ingredients the natives had were scarce and few. This is as close as you can get with simplicity. Usually Navajo natives swear on blue bird lol and even dry milk but this is great! They came out super fluffy and PERFECT! we had em with honey and then with our chili for dinner as Indian tacos. Muchas Gracias for ur recipe! Its basic and perfect!

Needs more salt. A pinch of sugar. May try a dash of soda to get more rise next time. And half milk half water. And maybe a rest period 10 mins or so. Typically I’ve made a yeast recipe. Trying to find a quicker version but still as tasty.....this isn’t quite it.

Edit: made again following those changes. Dough was sticky, I let it rest about 10 minutes and then as I tore pieces off I patted them down in a dusting of flour, poked holes with a fork, made the slit in the center, end result was the best frybread I’ve ever had. Even better than the yeast recipies. Used about 1/2 tsp of baking soda, increased salt to 1tsp, 1/2 tsp of sugar and half water, half milk. Top notch.

It was really really good. I made it how it says. Although I think it could easily use another tablespoon of baking powder, unless i just made my pieces way to flat lol. Other wise really yummy(i had a really great recipe before and lost it. I do Rmebr 4cups flour and 2 tbl spoons banking powder.)

This is the best reciepe I have found. The taste is outstanding. We have a very strong Native American Background of Cherokee heritage that goes back from parents to grandparents. This tastes like family.

OMG. Terrible. I followed the recipe to the letter and even went back and double checked. It came out hard on the outside and thick and doughy inside. Not crispy and chewy like fry bread that I've had before. Not even palpable. Sorry, but I will never make this recipe again. After reading other reviews, it's possible that I over kneaded the dough. I'll try again and let you know.

Super easy to make and very delicious. My only suggestion is to substitute sugar for salt if you’re going to top the fry bread with sweet toppings.

Used 3 C white flour & 1 C whole wheat flour, fried 1.5 minute on each side in vegetable oil. Hubby & kids said they were too thick, but still good ! ? Used it for tacos but would go good with honey too. Got this recipe from a Cree friend.

Too much flour. Very dry and bland. It was so tough to chew, I almost choked trying to swallow it. We ended up throwing out the rest of the dough. :(

The Smithsonian's recipe is better (3 c. flour, 1  1/4 c. warm water, 1T baking powder, 1 tsp salt... knead and let sit covered for 10 min. before cooking).

Yes I've made it again. This will be my go to. I have tried others but this one turned out nice and puffy and crispy especially when reheated. I did increase the salt, probably about 1teaspoon total. I don't really measure.

5 stars as written. I have also made it gluten free by subbing gf flour blend, upping the baking powder and liquid, and adding yeast and sugar. With the changes it's about a 4 star rating...

I made  this but I scaled it down to two servings. The dough is very sticky, it takes some kneading to make it soft. Try to get most of the flour off before you place in the shortening otherwise the pan will start to smoke. But yes I give it five stars. Butter them while they are hot.

After years of drooling at the thought, this was my first time making and eating fry bread (like this). Very easy recipe - I used my deep fat frier. Absolutely gorgeous! I ate mine with butter and honey ? Thank you for sharing the recipe =)

I cut the serving size down to 3 for us since I didn't want to waste ingredients if we didn't like it. No worries, the 3 of us loved it. I added additional salt and pepper to taste after pulling it out of the oil. Yum,yum,yum....I added butter to mine, but the DH and son ate as is.

I really liked this recipe for Fry Bread!  I've been looking to find a good recipe for a while as I've been trying to connect with my heritage.  You just have to make sure you flatten out the dough enough before you fry it!

Double the salt and you have decent Indian fry bread.

I used whole ancient flour blend; eggs; real corn only meal; Stevia for sweetness; sea salt and herbal iodine; raw milk.

So easy to make & delicious. I made this for my high school daughters history class & it was a huge hit & the kids still ask me to make it for them. So I have made it a few times. I like it plain with nothing on it but I also make it with cinnamon & sugar.

Brilliant! This was easy and tasted fab. We used the frybread for navajo tacos for dinner and later when my 10 yo was running around the backyard playing night games with the neighbor kids, I used up the rest of the dough to make small frybreads, sprinkled them with powdered sugar and the kids inhaled them. One boy even proclaimed he would come over and pay me $10 for 10 of them. LOL!  So, yes, these are definitely worth making. I also doubled the salt like some suggested.

My neighbors are into Native American culture, but not really into cooking, and have been asking if I can make this- now I can! I took a batch to them, and they said it's exactly what they remember from living in Arizona.  Yay!

These were good, and very easy to make.  I used whole wheat pastry flour to up the nutritional value somewhat (considering they're fried!)  When done draining on the paper toweling, but while still warm, I drizzled butter over the top, and sprinkled a cinnamon/sugar mixture over the butter.  These were wonderful served with breakfast.

Not so good, perhaps I might have done something wrong. The dough was tuff.

This was fantastic! My four growing boys scarffed them right down and asked for more. Recipe couldn't be easier. Thanks!
