The food was delicious!  However, because I am not an exprienced cook, it took me more than an hour to cut and prepare all of the ingredients, before putting everything in the crock pot; so this was not a dish that can be prepared in a short period of time, although it is cooked in the crock pot.  If you are looking for something fast to prepare, this is not a dish for you.

Not so sure why this is being related to Osso Buco, but it sure tasted great! Followed the recipe exactly except used a veal chuck roast. Served with orzo. Great!

i tried this and the veal had no flavor.  I ended up having to re-saute the beef and place the contents of the slow cooker into a dutch oven and prepare it that way.  It all worked out, but the steps i tried to avoid by slow cooking i ended up having to do anyway.

I made it without the Osso Buco cuts and it was good.  I imagine with the right meat it would be awesome.

A good recipe, but it needs more: a tablespoon of kosher salt and 1/2 teaspoon of freshly ground black pepper is a start (in a slow cooker--in a Dutch oven cut the salt and pepper in half), and osso bucco is made with grated lemon peel; it's not osso bucco without it.  Add two teaspoons freshly grated lemon peel in a slow cooker, or one teaspoon in a Dutch oven.

Fantastic.  We're huge osso buco fans, and this is the most effortless method by far.  The veal was beyond tender and perfectly seasoned without overpowering the veal.  Don't forget to serve with gremolata: 2 Tbsp FRESH parsley, 1 Tbsp fresh grated lemon peel, 1 clove finely minced garlic.  A side of polenta and a big glass of Sangiovese won't hurt either:)

The vegetable sauce was good but over powered the flavor of the meat. It was pretty much tasteless. I'll try it again but add some additional spices when browning the veal; maybe some tarragon and reduce the amount of onion..

This is one of our go-to favorites! We LOVE this! My kids (ages 3 1/2 and 1 1/2) inhale it and always ask for more. I set my rice cooker with arborio rice to make a 'cheat' risotto and serve this over the risotto. I often have trouble finding veal shank so I will get lamb shank instead. A winner!

Made it for company and they raved about it.  Love being able to do all the prep work ahead of time, put it in the slow cooker and set it and forget it!  Paired it with an oven version of risotto that made the meal super easy to make and clean up.  Use your slow cooker liners for easy clean up!

Only thing I added was 1 teaspoon seasoning salt (that was because I used unsalted chicken broth, so if you use salted maybe use 1/2), and 1/2 teaspoon lemon pepper since I didn't have a lemon for lemon zest that everybody recommended.  Other than my slow cooker on low cooked it in half the time 4 hours (so I'd check yours in about that time), it was great.

This is a very good recipe. I would use 2 inch veal shanks, 1 inch is too small and cooks too fast. Traditionally, this is served with risotto. I wouldn't try to make the risotto for the first time when making this recipe. The inexperienced cook may want to look for pre-chopped veggies at her market. The prep shouldn't take too long. I add a cup of wine and boil it down when the shanks have finished browning. Takes about 5 hours in my multipot
