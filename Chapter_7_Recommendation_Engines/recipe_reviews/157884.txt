I made this recipe and it was fantastic, but a little soggy/runny which is due to the fact that the persimmon puree is really juicy.  The only thing I would do differently next time is to drain the liquid from the persimmon puree, just like you would for fresh pumpkin puree before making a pie/pumpkin cheesecake.  If you are not familiar with that, just line a collander/strainer with 2-3 sheets of good quality paper towell or cheesecloth and let sit in another bowl over night.  You'll be surprised to see the amount of liquid that has drained out into the "catch" bowl.  The cheesecake will turn out much better after draining the excess liquid.

I just made this last night, and it was fantastic. I rarely give a recipe five stars, but this earned it. I disagree with the reviewers who said that it was too runny, or didn't have enough persimmon taste. I didn't strain my persimmon puree at all, and my cheesecake had the perfect, creamy texture and a whole lot of persimmon taste. Since I used a crushed gingersnap cookie crust, I omitted the ginger in the cake and used 1/2 tsp of cinnamon and 1/4 tsp of nutmeg instead. I also didn't do the sour cream topping. Instead I served it with fresh whipped cream. Awesome cheesecake. Can't wait to serve it to friends.

This cheesecake was very good. My entire family raved about it. The only thing different that I did was that I added a dash of all spice the sour cream mix that goes on top of the cheesecake. With the luxury of having a persimmon tree in my backyard, I will be able to bake this cheesecake often!!!

Cheesecake was worth it. Crust delicious and held together (while chilled too) I held back about a cup of persimmons and mixed with caramel sauce, warmed in the microwave and drizzled on top, left off the sour cream. I also cooked it in a water bath. Great recipe for flavor.

Quite tasty. The persimmon flavor was almost too subtle and the cheesecake a bit eggier than I prefer. Next time I'll make extra persimmon puree and save to pour over the top as a garnish for both looks and flavor.

Wonderful recipe and easy to follow. I used gramcracker crust because I don't like walnuts. Tasts great.

Made this dessert for X-mas. Loved, loved it because it was my first trial utilizing persimmon. Lovely sweet fruit, not overpowering. Cut the recipe down to an 8" spring form. I made it w/ the typical graham cracker crust, but the bottom came out a bit sticky & gooey... made me love it more.

I added a picture of one with toffee bits on top...my house smells like heaven and I only had a small lick from my fingertip and it is super yummy...can't wait till it chills!  Thank You Thank You. I had 12 persimmons from my produce co-op getting ripe on my counter and I intended to give them away.  Now I am glad I tried this recipe!

The recipe should've said to blend cream cheese first and then slowly add the persimmon pulp.  I tried this to the letter "combine" and the consistency was like ricotta cheese.

It was very good but reminded me more of pumpkin pie.  I would probably use less spices next time.  Yes I would make it again.

It was hard to get a smooth consistency even with a hand mixer on high.  Does have more of a spongy consistency like ricotta rather than the firm creaminess of classic cheesecake. Did taste good, and I would definitely use this tasty crust for gluten free desserts in the future.

This is amazing ! Read other review and used gingersnap cookies for crust, as recommended. An awesome alternative to Thanksgiving Pumpkin Pie. We topped ours with a little sour cream and a little whipped cream. All rave reviews from those who got a slice.

I made this for Christmas Eve Dessert exactly according to the recipe and it came out fantastic.  I only used a strainer to separate the skin/peels from the pulpy center.  Perfect texture, walnut crust was amazing and really complemented the persimmon.  Creamy delicious flavor.
