I prepared this dish last night and refrigerated overnight before baking this morning (I'm not sure if this was a good idea, but it seemed like one at the time).
I also halved the recipe, used milk instead of half and half and forgot the spinach completely, so I added a few extra green onions.  I couldn't find any ham and ended up with deli ham, which wasn't the best.  The recipe would have been great with leftover ham.  
So I will make this again with a few tweaks: not forget the spinach, THINLY slice the green onions, as listed and refrigerate only 15-20 minutes before baking. (You know, follow the recipe a little better!)  Mine was quite 'wet' and I don't know if it's because of the overnight soak, or the fact that my dish probably wasn't big enough.  I think an 8 x 8 pan would be a better size if you half the recipe.

This recipe was the perfect base for a stale loaf of  rustic multigrain bread I bought at the farmer's market and dug out of the freezer while I was looking for something else. It had been in there for so long it had gone stale.  Since it was not a commercially sliced loaf, I did slice some of the bread to line the bottom of the baking dish, then cubed the rest and layered as instructed.   I decided to use what I had on hand, which was leftover ham, Swiss cheese, and a little bit of cheddar, along with the chopped fresh spinach. I did not have any green onions, so I added about a couple of teaspoons of stone ground mustard to the custard base. I may add more next time.  It was the perfect balance for my husband and me. I prepared it and I cooked it as instructed, and it was a tad watery. TIP for next time, I will either saute the fresh spinach to get the water out or use frozen spinach that has been thawed and the moisture thoroughly squeezed out.
