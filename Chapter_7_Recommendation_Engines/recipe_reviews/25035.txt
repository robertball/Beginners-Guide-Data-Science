Be sure to turn the cinnamon side of the graham crackers facing up. Also any crackers that are not covered in the butter mixture will burn. I bake these in a deeper dish (a cookie sheet with some depth) or a casserole dish because some ingredients spill on the sides.

This was a hit at the football party I took it to last Sunday! Several people asked for the recipe. It has a great buttery taste and is super-easy. The only slight complaint I had was that it does taste just a little bit burned. I think this happened when I was stirring the syrup probably would have been easier on a gas stove. Still a great recipe overall. I think I'll make it again at Christmas and give it away as gifts.

So good! Can't stop eating them. I think it helped that I lightly sprayed the cooking sheet before assembling. I followed others advice and baked at 375 for 9 minutes. After about 45 minutes I gently broke them apart and put in fridge to fully set up. Delicious recipe!

I think I goofed and cooked these just a bit too long leaving a slightly burnt taste to some of the coating. Also found it very difficult to cut/break into pieces after it cooled - it was one solid mass. Found that putting it in a warm oven for a minute helped some.

So good you can't have just two! Be sure to cover every surface of the crackers with the syrup mixture to avoid getting burnt. I sprinkled shredded coconut before putting in the oven. When it was done I drizzled melted chocolate diagonally so they were extra yummy and pretty.

Truly addictive. To ensure no burnt taste completely cover crackers with syrup mixture. Also finely chopped walnuts are best. I lowered oven temp to 375 and baked for 9 minutes in foil covered pan & they came out picture perfect!

After reading some of the feedback I made the following changes. I cut the recipe in half put foil on my cookie sheet separated all the graham crackers (I used regular graham crackers) I added some coconut to the top and I lowered the temp to 375 and only baked them for 8 minutes. They were delicious!

This is perfect for what I need! I am doing a presentation on an essay I wrote called "Cinnamon" and I wanted to make little cinnamon goodies. I think I will follow the advice of the other commenters and bake it for 9 min. at 375 degrees. If I've never made something before and I try to make it something always goes wrong. This is so easy I don't think anything could possibly go wrong!

OMG! These are so easy and so delish. I'm afraid my husband is going to OD. Took the advice of others and baked @ 375 degrees for 9 min. Allergic to walnuts so I used chopped pecan added coconut then sprinkled the cooled cookies with a little fleur de sel. A trifecta: sweet salty & crunchy! Yum! Yum!! & Yum!!!

The 12 graham crackers fit in a smaller jelly roll pan not 15x20 and the butter/sugar mixture did not cover the crackers/nuts completely so I sprinkled more brown sugar on the bare spots and drizzled more melted butter over that. The edges baked a lot faster than the middle and I heeded the warnings not to burn it so the center was softer. I thought it was a disaster but had to take it to a party anyway; I was pleasantly surprised to hear people complimenting it and almost all of it disappeared. So the recipe isn't really perfect but it can still turn out wonderful!
