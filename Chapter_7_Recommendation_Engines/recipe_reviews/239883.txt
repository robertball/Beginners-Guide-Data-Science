If you are going to use mushrooms as buns then the bell peppers are not needed and vice versa. I actually did it both ways and preferred the bell pepper buns. There is quite a bit of mushroom going on in the inside of the burger and so the shroom buns seems overkill. My mushroom caps were huge too so that might have played a part. Regardless, this was a great recipe and I enjoyed it. I didn't end up using the egg and I used green onions for the onions. Great recipe and one I would make again!
