I dont know why I had so much trouble with this recipe, but it just didnt want to come together. My only change was using a gluten free flour blend instead of just rice flour. I cant imagine that causing the dry batter issue. I also cut the recipe in half. As I couldnt get it to shape, I just decided to press it into a square pan and bake that way. Once lightly browned I removed it from the oven to set and kool. Upon trying to cut into squares, I found it soft yet still too crumbly. I am going to just let it break up and use it on plain yogurt or eat as breakfast cereal. Its not too sweet anyhow.

I made these last night and they were very flavorful. I only added 2 cups oatmeal because of a personal preference. Turned out a bit crunchy on the outside and chewy on the inside, just like we enjoy.
