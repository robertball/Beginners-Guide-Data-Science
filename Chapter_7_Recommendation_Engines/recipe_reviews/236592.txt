This is a great, basic potato pancake recipe! I only had Yukon gold potatoes, so I used those. I really wasn't sure of the size of potatoes to use, so I only added 1 egg and mixed it up to see the consistency before adding the second, and I ended up not needing the second, it was perfect with just the one. These cooked up nice and crisp on the outside and soft and tasty in the middle. I will def be making these again~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

I'd probably make them thinner and cook at a bit higher temperature seeking a crulisper texture. I cooked them on a griddle using cooking spray to keep the fat low.
