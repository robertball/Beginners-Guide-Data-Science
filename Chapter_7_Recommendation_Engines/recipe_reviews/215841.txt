Found this one for my husband's birthday dinner and it was a HIT!!  I used the Classico Creamy Alredo sauce with Roasted red peppers and it added a great flavor to the recipe.  Definately a keeper in our household.

Basic recipe is very good, but I found recommended pan size to big.  Maybe a 9x13. There's not enough sauce to cover top layer in bigger pan. We will make again.

I have made this several times and it is always a hit. I recommend adding more spinach, carrots and mushrooms. yum! :)

I made this as written with the exception of using 1 can of mushrooms (drained) as I didn't have fresh mushrooms. It definitely needed more mushrooms but the amount of carrots was fine.  This was a bit soupy (until it got cold).  If I use fresh mushrooms, I will definitely use 4 lasagna noodles per layer.  It also required a lot of black pepper or red pepper flakes to give it some pizazz.

Easy to make, but not a nice flavor.
