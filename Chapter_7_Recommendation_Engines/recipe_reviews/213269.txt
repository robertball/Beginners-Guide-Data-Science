This had a really nice flavour, I followed recipe exactly, I was a little apprehensive of the heat of the thai chilli paste, I licked a little off the spoon, before I threw it in the sink, it was really Hot!  But I went ahead and made. I had to use Kikkoman Brand Toasted Sesame Marinade, 345 ml size, as the kraft one mentioned is not available in Ontario, but I think this was comparable. I made the ginger/garlic paste as supplied, I couldn't find it in the store, I used boneless breast and bone-in skinless thighs (for more flavour). I left this on low while I went to work (I made the sauce the nite before and food processed it and stuck it in the frig), great smell when I got home. I took chicken out of pot and took out bones and roughly sliced and set aside. Turned up crock pot to high with lid on (10 to 15 min.), then I mixed  about 2 tablespoons of cornstarch and water, and stirred this into sauce in the pot, it thickened up nicely. I used some Thai stick pasta (very thin pasta, that you just soak for 10 minutes in boiling water, drain and its ready) I  mixed everything, including some green beans cooked to still crisp and  mushrooms ) (Get those veggies into meals) This was excellent heated back up the next day, and the next day....

This is really good. I made it last night for dinner but wanted to cut calories so used 1/2 bottle of light Kraft Asian dressing. It turned out great with complex flavor that was not overpowered by the Chili sauce. Despite using 1/2 the dressing, we still had 2 cups of liquid in the slow cooker when it was finished that made a great dipping sauce.

I did enjoy this dish very much. However, next time, I will make one modification - I will use half the amount of Asian Dressing. That's more than enough. Normally I don't modify a recipe until after I've tried it as is, but I had to make two changes, one out of neccessity and the other by choice. First, I didn't have any ginger-garlic paste so I used 1 tbsp each of minced galic cloves and minced ginger. Second, there were no vegetables! Lots of chicken but no veggies. So I threw in 2 diagonally sliced carrots, 1 large rough chopped onion, and 8 oz fresh button mushrooms, then layered the chicken over it and then the sauce. An hour before it was done I tossed in 1 rough chopped red pepper. Wonderful!

Husband says 3, I say 4. I halved the recipe, but left the chile paste, ginger garlic paste, and peanut butter the same. I really couldn't taste any of those seasonings distinctly, which was fine. I think this would benefit from the addition of a sweetener (like honey or orange marmalade) and red pepper flakes (or whole dried red peppers like restaurants use). My husband wasn't wowed by the flavor, and I wasn't really exactly impressed either. But, this was ready to eat at 5:30, but I had to turn it to "warm" and leave it for several more hours due to a family emergency. That this recipe survived being overcooked by 2-3 hours and still gets a 4 says good things for it. Give it a shot if you like these flavors. Served this chopped up over brown rice, as written makes PLENTY of sauce. Thanks for the recipe! (Photo coming soon.) P.S.--I too tested this recipe using the LIGHT version of this dressing.

The first thing out of my husbands mouth was "YUMMY", so I know it was a hit. Fixed it exactly as written(found the garlic ginger paste at Woodmans). I did take the juice, put it in a saucepan, add cornstarch and cooked it until thick. Poured that over the chicken that I served over rice. It was delicious and the recipe will go into my Favorites folder!  Thanks for the recipe!

I made this dish this week for my son and my Thai exchange student.  I wanted to cook something that would meet our American taste as well as satisfy his Thai cravings.  I followed the recipe exactly.  It was promptly named "nasty chicken" by my exchange student and my son and has been the joke of our house for a week.  It did get eaten with generous amounts of BBQ sauce.  I'm giving it 2 stars because if you are not looking for a "Thai" dish it is palatable for most American tastes. It was easy to make as the title says.  However, if you are looking for a "Thai" meal this does NOT do the trick.

This was tasty and oh so easy! I only used half the bottle of salad dressing, and doubled the chile paste. I found ginger garlic paste in my grocery's Indian section (Laxmi Brand).  I used skinless chicken thighs, and marinated them overnight in the fridge in the sauce.  Cooked on low for 6 hours--1 hour before serving, I deboned the chicken and put it back in the sauce on low. It pretty much thickened up on its own. Served with seasoned sushi rice and an Asian veg medley. Not authentic, but good nonetheless. Thanks for the recipe!

This was absolutely delicious! I used 6 whole breasts of chicken and still had a lot of sauce left over. I also added extra chili paste (it wasn't nearly spicy enough for us) and served it over asian noodles.

Good and easy. I love thai peanut chicken and my family loves it. I think I would rather have it cooked in a wok w/ bell peppers and to make my sauece from scratch, but for a quickiet this recipe was okay. I did add cilantro, green onions, additional minced garlic, red pepper flakes , soy sauce, and cornstarch to thicken the sauce.

I love Thai food, and this was a perfect make-at-home substitute.  I like to use Ken's Steakhouse Asian-Sesame dressing, and it's light, which is nice.  I use about 1 and 1/2 cups.  I didn't have ginger-garlic paste, so I use garlic instead.  Also, once the chicken is cooked, I add in julienne bell pepper and carrots and let them cook for 20-30 minutes.  Serve over rice - soooo yummy!

This is a great recipe! I did only add half the bottle of salad dressing which still left me with plenty of sauce. I made it for the second time and added in mushrooms, an onion, and a pepper. I served it with noodles and it was even better!

This is delicious and SO easy! To be fair, though, I didn't measure the peanut butter, ginger or crushed pepper. I just kept adding until it looked/smelled (and later, tasted) right. And, I left the pork cubed rather and shredding it. Served over rice and it's a hit!

I must have messed this up somehow. It was really par with a cheap bag-to-skillet meal. I made the dressing as called for, and poured half over the 3 chicken breasts. Added a thawed bag of stirfry veggies. Roomate said he would eat it again, but wouldnt ask for it. I'll try it again with a homemade dressing as opposed to Kraft. Will probably scale the liquid way down.

Very good. My kids loved it. When I heated up the left overs at work everyone commented on how delicious it smelled. It was even better the day after on some brown rice.  The salad dressing base added a little more vinegar taste than I would prefer. Next time I make it I plan to add more of the chili paste and maybe some soy and/or sesame oil to liven it up a bit more.

I make this frequently; everyone in my family loves it. And served over rice. I add  1/2 tsp Viet Nam chili sauce too, to bring put the heat a little.

This recipe was great! I used double amount of chunky peanut butter. Also I found it was better with more of the chili paste... I will definitely be making this again :)

It was very good, but needed something to jazz it up a bit. A half hour before I removed it from the slow cooker I threw in a couple of sliced jalepenos (with the seeds as my family likes it spicy!) and some salted peanuts. Also, I agree with other reviewers about using only half the dressing. I served it on thin rice noodles and it was a repeat!

My 11yr old wanted to know how soon we could have this again and my 8yr old decided we should have it as the new company for dinner meal. I served it over brown jasmine rice, then chopped frozen spinach followed by the chicken thighs. I made 
the sauce and spooned that over it. There will be a fight for the left overs for lunch tomorrow!

Very easy, excellent dish. I added extra chilli sauce to make it spicier. Loved the fact that I didn't have to heat up the kitchen on a hot summer day. Will definitely make again

We love the flavors of this. I use Lawry's Sesame Ginger marinade (half a bottle) and throw in a bit of extra ground ginger and a few dashes of soy sauce, as well as the chili paste (have substituted sriracha sauce for the chili paste, too).  The sauce is really good used with a pork roast -- how my family prefers it.

This was very good but it is not Thai at all. I would call this somewhat of a Teriyaki Chicken recipe more than anything. I followed the recipe exactly,  let the chicken cook for 5 hours and than served it over Jasmine rice. Very tasty and I would make it again. It is screaming for a veggie in it. I would say broccoli stirred in at the last minute which I plan to do next time.

Loved this. Super easy to make, delicious even the kids liked it. I made my own ginger garlic paste and got a thai chili paste that wasn’t too spicy. Also used less than called for dressing (about 1/3 of the 16oz bottle)

I love thai food, and based on reviews and my intuition, I added a few things that made it awesome! I added a cup of coconut milk, red Thai paste. I like The way of adding the corn starch to thicken it at the end but I added the PB in The beginning. I finished with scallions, cilantro, lime, and peanuts.

I always use thighs for more flavor & less dry then breasts.
Company & family favorite, have been making it for years.
I add chopped chives, roasted peanuts & mandarin oranges as garnishes.
Serve over rice.

This did not turn out as expected and my family didn't care for the taste. I used Newman's Sesame Dressing,  and the chicken had a very strong taste of vinegar.

First, no need to dirty a second dish.  Put the sauce ingredients directly into the crock pot first and mix them together.  Then put the chicken in.  Very easy!  I use Ken's Lite Asian Sesame dressing (not because I'm watching my weight, just because it's really good).  I also use frozen chicken breast or strips.  4 stars as written because it's so easy and pretty good.  For a 5 star recipe, substitute Tahini for the peanut butter (the peanut butter seems to leave a kind of after taste that I don't care for).  

This is a regular at our house (made with Tahini) served with jasmine rice and whatever steam in the bag veggies we have on hand.  I can mix mine all together but the kids can eat everything separate.  If you use the crock pot for the chicken and a rice cooker for some rice, everyone can serve themselves when they're ready to eat which is helpful if you have a hectic schedule.

My family loved it. The only thing i added the last hour of cooking was a 1/2 cup of unsalted peanuts for a crunch plus i love the flavor and a rainbow of peppers to add a little color and a veggie to the dish.  Hubbie said it was a keeper and i could make it any time.

Personally I thought it was too sweet. It could've been the dressing I used though.  I was expecting it to taste more like peanuts and spiciness and it tasted more like sugary soy sauce.  I followed the recipe exactly and I thought it definitely needed the full 16 oz of dressing. If I halved it, there wouldn't have been enough sauce. Would try again with another brand of dressing, maybe one where sugar wasn't listed as the second ingredient.

So amazing. I subbed a bit. 

Garlic ginger paste = minced garlic and ginger powder

Thai chili sauce = sweet and sour sauce, Sriracha, and red pepper flakes.

I couldn't find chili paste so I used chili garlic sauce and I also couldn't find ginger garlic paste so I used fresh grated ginger. I like other people used "lite" Asian dressing "Newman's Own Sesame Ginger". It turned out great and I will definitely make again. I did it for 3 hours on high and then left it on warm for the rest of the day. VERY EASY!!

Very tasty!  Actually used hot chili sauce and garlic as I didn't have chili paste or ginger garlic paste, it came out great and was a hit with everyone.

I have made this several times and it is family favorite. Serving in Thailand when in Military brings back memories. I like it a little more spicy but my kids do not.
