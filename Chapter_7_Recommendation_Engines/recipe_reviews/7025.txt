Loved it! Best bread I have ever made.  

I didn't use a bread machine.  Instead I did the following: mixed dry ingredients in large bowl.  Combined yeast, honey (in place of sugar), butter, and warm water in a separate bowl.  Mixed until dissolved and left to sit a couple minutes until creamy.  Added yeast mixture to dry ingredients.  After kneeding the dough for a while, 10-15 minutes or so, I left it to rise until it was just over double the size.  Punched it down.  Put dough into bread pan and left to rise again.  Baked in the oven for 35 minutes at 350 degrees.  Yum! The crust of this bread is amazing.  I will definitely be making this bread again and again.

Oh my gosh! I got my bread machine for christmas and I have literally tried at LEAST more than a half dozen recipes, I didn't find one I liked until now! I kept it exactly the same except a couple things. I put in 2 cups all purpose and one cup whole wheat (to try to get myself to eat some wheat, I like wheat, but I was raised on white, so it's hard) and I also let it rise once (regular "basic" bread cycle) turned the machine off and then restarted the whole cycle again (I got that tip off one site, supposed to make the bread hold up better, keep it's shape, while still being fluffy). 

I was scared there would be no need for bread flour or gluten but the oatmeal does the trick! It disappears into the bread and binds great! Great for kids who have issues with "things" showing in the bread, it's all hiding!

I can't thank you enough for this one! It's my favorite! I'm so glad it had oatmeal in it too! Great great great!

Absolutely delicious!! I added a bit more yeast (I love yeasty bread:) and used quick oatmeal instead of rolled oats. I also prepared on the dough cycle, shaped into a loaf and let rise for 30 mins and then baked for 30 mins at 350 deg. Definitely a keeper! thanks!

What a wonderful recipe!  This is excellent.  The bread is moist and tastes great.  I replaced 1/2 cup of white flour for whole wheat and added a Tbsp of ground flax seed for extra nutrition.  This turned out so much better than whole wheat breads I've made which have ended up dry and didn't rise enough.  Definately will keep this on hand to make on a regular basis.

Amazing amazing. I hand made this and baked it in the oven. "Jules" instructions are spot on.  When making this by hand, the dough is quite sticky and wet so I added an extra 1/4 cup flour before turning it onto a board to knead. I then added about another 1/4 cup throughout the kneading process - about 5 min. total.  I let it rise 1 1/2 hours for the 1st rise, punch down, put into a large loaf pan and let rise another 45 min.  I baked it for exactly 35 min. at 350 and had to cover the top with foil for the last 15 min. It's a super moist bread, dense but tender with a slight oat taste.  **Update** This bread does stale quickly after about two days and crumbles. To keep it moist longer and have a chewier texture, add 2-3 tablespoons of powdered gluten. The rise will also be higher.  Try it!

I just got a bread machine, and this is the first recipe I've tried worth keeping!  I've made it twice already, and will make it again as soon as the bread machine cools off.  I did change a few things though.  I only used 3/4 tsp of salt, 2 T olive oil instead of butter, and 3 T of brown sugar instead of 2.  It looks perfect, tastes perfect, and my 7 kids and I ALL loved it and that is really something hard to find.  My husband didn't get to try it because we ate it all before he got home!  It rose to the top of my 2 lb breadman machine without over filling.  I will probably try adding some raisins and cinnamon next time for something different, but this really is awesome just the way it is.  Thanks!

Wonderful, light, soft texture.  The kids went wild over it... I made a second loaf for the freezer and got it out the next day after the first one disappeared so quickly!  I added an extra tablespoon of brown sugar and swapped 1/2 cup white flour for 1/2 cup whole wheat flour!  This is a KEEPER!

This is the ultimate bread machine recipe!!!  I was leery of the oats as my children question lumpy bread, but somehow, the oats magically disappear!  It has a great crust and is easily cut for sandwiches!

There are so many factors that can influence how a loaf of bread turns out and maybe the "negative factor genies" were working with me on this one. Of all the bread machine recipes I've tried this is probably my least favorite. The dough rose too high, which resulted in a bread that was too moist, fluffy and soft for my liking. (Once out of the bread machine I did throw it in the oven for an additional ten minutes at 375 degrees) It just didn't have the substance or the texture I like in bread, though I admit I grew up with homemade Italian bread! I also thought the taste was rather flat. In hindsight, I'd increase the salt and decrease the yeast and  sugar. Also, I assumed I'd notice the oatmeal in the bread, but I did not. Either I just had a bad bread baking day, or it's just a matter of personal preference, or maybe this is one of those breads that's best baked in the oven.

Fantastic bread. Oats just disappear. Excellent texture and taste. Rose better than anything made before. Much nicer than plain white bread - but daughter ate quite happily (unlike brown or wholemeal!). May try bit more salt next time - personal preference - although not sure how will affect yeast recation etc. Excellent recipe. Thanks

FINALLY-I am going to take time to share this rating. Yes, it is 5-stars. This is my all-time easy best bread recipe. I make this recipe about 1/2 the time I make bread as it is just the easy quick delicious bread. My grandchildren love coming to Grandma's house and know they will have this waiting for them. Instead of using the oatmeal & brown sugar, I use the individual breakfast oatmeal packages which come in maple/brn.sugar, cinnamon spice, apple cinnamon, etc. This is so quick and easy and I do not even have to look at the recipe anymore as it is so easy and quick. I put it into my bread maker and set it to dough and then when it is done I put it in one bread pan and let it raise until double and bake at 350 for 35 minutes. Perfect every time and delicious.  Hope you will try it and experiment with the oatmeal packages. There is a big variety of them and I have tried them all and they all work perfect.  Fun way to change flavors and oatmeal bread is so good for you. The kids will love it and they won't know how good it is for them.

This bread is so great! This is my absolute favorite recipe for the bread machine... I've made it several times, but in case you were wondering, bread flour doesn't work very well. It made a more dense loaf that didn't rise as well as the ones made with all-purpose flour.

This bread has a really nice subtle flavor to it.  Even my 6 and 12 year old nieces agree it's good eating - and at those ages they don't agree on anything. I used quick cooked rolled oats since that's all I had on hand and it was still great.

Excellent everyday bread recipe! This is my go-to whenever I use my breadmaker. The only change I make is to use 2 cups of bread flour and one cup of whole wheat flour instead of 3 cups of regular flour. This bread is great plain toasted with a little butter; it is also wonderful for sandwiches and paninis.

Oh how I love this bread! The texture is superb!!! I put all the ingredients into my bread machine and selected dough cycle. I took out the dough, shaped it into a loaf and cooked in my oven @ 350 for 20 min. I put cornmeal beneath the loaf of dough. I let it rise for 30 minutes prior to baking. After it rose, I cut 3 large diagonal slices on the top, spread butter over the entire top and then sprinkled tons of rolled oats on top of the butter. WOW, does it look amazing when it's done!!! Looks like a $6 loaf of bread. THANKS!

Had to make this three times, one right after another on the same day.  I set the first one out. My 10-year-old son ate 3/4 of it with homemade bean soup. Then I made another one. That was quickly cleaned off by two little kids and a hungry husband. I then made a third -- and we're holding steady on that one. Am going to the store to get more packets of yeast. My Hungarian husband said this is the best bread he has had in the US. We may get tired of it one day, but it sure is delicious! Used rapid rise yeast and real butter. Also baked it in a Pampered Chef bread form. Don't know if makes a difference, but the whole texture was simply divine!

Great recipe.  It is good as written however I have tweaked it a little to my family's preferences. I use 3 TBS brown sugar (I like my bread a little sweeter) 1 cup whole wheat flour and 2 cups bread flour.  I also increase the salt to 1 1/2 tsp and the yeast to 2 tsp.  Turns out great everytime!

My absolute favorite bread. This is THE one I will make from now on. Combining previous user comments, I did the following:

1 1/4 cup hot tap water
2 tablespoons melted butter
1 tablespoon honey
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup sour cream
3 cups bread flour
1/2 cup quick oats
2 tablespoons dark brown sugar
1 packet rapid rise yeast

1. Put ingredients in order into the bread machine.
2. Select dough cycle.
3. Shape into lightly greased, regular bread loaf pan.
4. Let sit covered for half an hour.
5. Bake in preheated oven at 345 for 30 minutes.
NOTE* Use middle oven rack position. The bread really rises while baking.

Should be called vanishing oat bread.  Can't imagine this bread having a chance to go stale.  Substituted olive oil for the butter just for ease. Tasted great and easy to make.  Will make this regularly.

I used two c. Bread flour and 1 c. Whole Wheat Flour and added some gluten to keep it moist longer.  I also forgot to put in the oats (whoops) so our Oat Bread was oatless. Still super light and yummy! Will make again.

Very, very good.  I used golden syrup instead of brown sugar for extra sweetness, which worked really well too.  I was surprised by how well this bread turned out, what with it using non-bread flour, but the texture was wonderful and light.  Very tasty, very easy and very cheap to make.

Pretty darn good..add a little more salt and a tad more water. I have been making this recipe for over a year and it is very reliable. Some tips: you can substitute oil for butter and honey/agave for the sugar. I make this in my oven...350 degrees for 35 mins. Also, you can sub white wheat flour fir a portion (about a third or half) of the white flour for a healthier loaf. After you start making your own bread, you will wonder why you ever buy bread...so easy and much healthier than most store loaves.

This bread was very good.  I used the bread machine and it turned out great.  Next time I will increase the amount of brown sugar.  We took the day old bread and made garlic toast out of it in our toaster oven to go with our spagetti dinner.  It was great.

By far the easiest and best tasting bread I have ever made. I found this recipe 2 years ago and have been using it since.

Made two loaves of this, one with the called-for 2T brown sugar and the second loaf substituting 2T honey for the brown sugar.  As for flavor my personal preference is the one made with honey.  Both loaves turned out great--made by hand (knead, let rise, punch down, let rise again, 30-35 minutes at 350 F).  After taking out of oven, let cool for 10 minutes, take out of pan, further cooling on wire rack.  Finally, brushing the cooling loaf with melted butter never hurts...

Well I am now making this bread every day. I thought I had found a great recipe until I tried this one. Taste is brill. My bro-in-law is Vegan and he loves it. Works well by swapping one cup of flour for wholemeal flour.

Hurray!!!  I have had my machine for a couple of years now and tried every boxed bread on the market with poor results.  The bread simply would not rise!  I have purchased bread flour, vital wheat gluten and expensive jars of instant bread machine yeast.  Finally, a recipe that rises to the top of my machine without falling or never making it to the top!!  I was about to throw that sucker out the window!  For this recipe I used my King Arthur bread flour and Fleishmans rapid rise yeast.  Substituted honey for the brown sugar.  On the basic cycle my bread rose to the top of my machine and baked perfectly.  Yes, it's a bit dense but that is what I expect from a home made bread.  Will DEFINITELY make this again!  TYVM for posting!!!

Simple and delicious. I did not use a bread machine for this recipe. I altered the flour to 1 c whole wheat and 2 c white, then added about 1/2 c corn meal for texture. The bread was hearty and went wonderfully with chili. This is going to become a fall/winter staple in the house.

This was my very first attempt at bread and I was thrilled with the results.  I substituted honey for sugar and also added 1/2 tbsp of flax seed meal and 1 tbsp of sunflower seeds.  Thanks for the recipe!!

Wow!  This is amazing!  Light and fluffy with a faint nutty flavor.  I used bread flour instead of AP but that is the only change I made.  I have made tons of breads in my machine, and this is my favorite one yet!  Thank you!!!!!!

Very delicious. Made by hand, mostly following "Jules"'s comments. The first rise I left the bread covered in the mixing bowl for 30 mins, the second in the 9x5 loaf pan I left covered for about 15. At 350 degrees for 35 mins the bread was perfect. It rose up higher than I was expecting, but that was ok with me. Though you can see the oatmeal on the crust, you can't see the oatmeal inside. The oats give the bread a delicious chewy texture. A really great bread--not too sweet, salty, or bland. And the crumb is perfect after cooling. A great addition to our bread recipe collection. This first loaf will actually be shared with friends--proudly. :) Thanks, LITSTER5.

This is my families new favorite bread. I even made cinnamon rolls using this dough(best cinnamon rolls I ever made). I just added a teaspoon of cinnamon to the 2 tablespoon of brown sugar. Then just used dough cycle on my bread machine Then rolled the dough out and spread butter more cinnamon and brown sugar.

Awesome bread!  I've always wanted to make good bread but it most always turned out a bit to flat and heavy.  Made this bread for first time 2 days ago and it turned out yummy.  Great flavor.  My husband kept going back for more!  Having to make another loaf today.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is Sensational!!! I didn't do a THING to the recipe, and it turned out absolutely perfect!  I mad my husband his favorite brownies yesterday, and the bread was ready last night night. He said he loved the bread so much, he'd actually rather have 2 pieces of the bread instead of the brownies! The kids love it too!

Delicious, quick and easy with the breadmaker.  And I'm glad I finally found a bread-maker bread recipe that doesn't need to have dry milk powder added.  Who keeps that on hand?

This is GREAT. this is the first time i succeeded to make a bread that meets my expectations. 

I dont have a bread machine, so i made it by hand. Some tweaks: i used instant yeast(1pkt) and mixed it with the all dry ingredients while mixing all the wet ones in another bowl. I also used 3/5 wholemeal flour instead of all a.p. flour and replaced the brown sugar by twice the amt of honey. I used veg oil instead of margarine and sub. 3/4 of the water with milk. Added walnuts(tossed in 1tblsp honey) for variety.

after combining the wet and dry ingred, i juz kneaded it for 10-15 mins, till elastic. and left to rise till double. knocked back, shaped into a loaf tin, proof till double before baking for 35 mins at 180C. (top browns too quickly and i covered loosely with foil halfway thru the baking)

end result: light and soft, slightly sweet bread full of heartiness. GREAT when lightly toasted. WILL DEF be making again, maybe with bananas or other variations. =)

AMAZING!!  However it could have used more oatmeal.  Threw all the ingredients in the mixer,had to add extra flour, after mixing and kneading with the mixer we let it rise for about 40 min punched it down, shaped it, slit 3 slices on top of the loaf with a knife, let it rise again, and baked it in the oven on our oven bricks at 375 for 25 min - we live in CO so the altitude difference is why we changed the temp and time than what others used.  The bread came out perfectly delicous!  Thanks!

I'll agree with others, I will not buy store bought bread again after eating this wonderful bread.  I follow all directions to a 't', however I subsitute applesauce for the butter.  This reduces calories and fat, and lends to the sweet flavor.  Enjoy!

I have stopped buying bread and only make this bread for our household! It is DELICIOUS. I make it with whole wheat flour sometimes and it still comes out great. I also have added a little wheat germ which works nicely too. Because I don't have a bread machine, I take it through 2 kneading/rising cycles and then bake it at 350 for about 1/2 hour. It is SO tasty! Be aware, though, that it doesnt' have preservatives so you shouldn't allow it to hang out in your kitchen for more than 5-7 days. Mine has gotten moldy in the past.

I added the ingredients in the order given and did use the all purpose flour that the recipe called for. The result was a tender and tasty loaf of bread. As mentioned earlier the oatmeal kind of disappears into the bread and you can't even taste it. That's a good thing for someone like me that doesn't care for oatmeal. My husband's an oatmeal fan though so he was a little disappointed. He liked the bread but hoped for something a little "oatmealy".
I highly recommend this one if you want a great loaf of bread and don't care for the taste of oatmeal.

I made 4 mini-loaves with this recipe. Like at least one other reviewer has said, the oatmeal disappears into the bread. I made this with bread flour and 1/2 c. whole wheat flour, and it turned out very nice.

This was terrific. I did not use a bread machine, but I added the flour, oats and salt to a stand mixer and combined the rest of the ingredients in a 2 cup measuring cup. I usually microwave the water about 1 min first to get it to the right temperature, about 110 degrees. Then slowly add the wet ingredients to the dry using the hook attachment. It should come together in about 10 minutes. You may need to stop the mixer a few times to turn the dough and scrape down the sides. Once the dough comes together, form into a ball and place in a greased bowl and cover with saran wrap. Let rise until doubled in size, about 1 hour. Punch down and roll into loaf shape. Transfer to greased pan and cover. Let rise 20-30 minutes. Bake at 350 for 40 minutes.

I really like this bread. Next time I plan to add whole wheat flour, flax seeds more oats but made it first time by recipe. I like to bake my breads the old fashion way. Kneading is a time to reflect and think about things so I enjoy that time. Bread was very moist and filled my kitchen with a sweetness that most breads I have made don't. I also set at 350 degrees but mine took about 40 minutes to bake. I loved the aroma and will make this again and again.

This recipe is flexible and it is my staple. It is perfect as is, but due to the flexibility of it, you can sub whole wheat flour, oil, less sugar, etc to make it what you are craving. The best part - powdered milk is extremely expensive where I live and this is one of the few bread maker recipes I've found that doesn't require it! Thanks for the recipe!

This bread is great.  Its soft, has a slight oat flavor, and is great with butter and jam.  A great, white bread.  My new favorite.

This recipe was awesome even though I kind of screwed it up. Finished kneading the dough when I realized I had forgotten to add the butter (I don't use margarine for anything). I donned a pair of gloves to avoid having a greasy mess and began to carefully knead the butter into the dough. I did not add any extra flour. When I was done, the dough was smooth and elastic so I formed the loaf and let it rise. The result was the most tender, delicious, honey oat bread with just the right amount of sweetness. It made wonderful sandwiches. I used old fashioned oats which did not disappear into the dough for those of you who like to know they're there. Simply marvelous! My only complaint is that it doesn't last long enough and that comes from someone who almost never eats bread.

Hint: for best moisture and texture, be very stingy with adding flour during the kneading process if you are forming your loaf by hand. Using vinyl gloves while working with a sticky dough keeps the hands clean and makes the dough easier to work with.

UPDATE: I made this according to directions as written the 2nd and 3rd time and although the bread was still worthy of 5 stars, I found that kneading in the soft butter last yielded the very best bread ever!
UPDATE 2: I learned from another site for the best bread, knead the dough for 7 minutes, let rest for 2 minutes, and knead for another 7 minutes before forming into a ball for the first rise. Works well by hand or mixer. PERFECT LOAF OF BREAD every tim

I'm giving it 4 only because a standard bread recipe calls for 2 1/4 teaspoons and it wasn't quite the height that bread usually is in my bread machine- a standard yeast packet is 2 1/4 instead of 1 1/2- but other than that, this recipe is YUMMY and I WILL be making it again, but w/ the standard amnt. of yeast :) 

Thanks for sharing!

We really enjoyed this. I did follow a previous reviewer in making this as directed but taking out after the dough cycle and doing a few modifications including baking it in the oven. Turned out great.

By far the tastiest and most consistant loaf I have come across.  Love it with substituted olive oil, and the third Tbl. brownsugar.  Delightful!  Have added Italian Seasonings, Rosemary, and I have a loaf waiting to be offered up this morning that I added raisons and cinnamon.  Enjoy Y'all.

I've done two variations on this bread.  I'll either keep it as written, but use butter instead of margarine.  Or, I'll replace the honey with brown sugar and replace the margarine with olive oil--I like this version best, but they're both great!  I always use the dough cycle, and then raise it in bread pans and bake it myself.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Delicious, moist bread that rose quite nicely. I made it exactly as the recipe called for but let it rise for about an hour in the bread machine, kneaded it and shaped it, let it rise for 35 minutes in the pan and then baked it for about 30-35 min in the oven at 350.
Will make it again soon!

This was very good! To solve some of the other reviewer's comments about the oats "disappearing" into the bread, I added the oats when my add ingredients timer went off. My husband & I like texture in our bread, so this helped with that (my kids don't so I may put the oats in right away when I plan for them to eat more of it). It dried out a bit sooner than some of the other recipes I have tried and that is the only reason why it didn't get 5 stars, I would have liked to give it 4 1/2.

I loved the flavor of this bread but mine fell during baking :( I can't remember for sure, but I think I used 1 cup of whole wheat flour and 2 cups of regular flour.  I also added some milled flax seed.  Will try this one again!

Absolutely delicious and deceptively simple!  I haven't used my bread machine in years, but this came out beautifully with no fuss.  I did change one cup of flour to wheat flour and added an extra T. brown sugar.  Kids and hubby love it.  Thanks for the great recipe!

This was my first attempt at using my bread machine for something other than the basic white bread recipe that came in the recipe book with the machine. This bread turned out amazing! Just a hint of sweetness from the brown sugar and the oats completely disappear into the bread.

Was VERY good! I made a second loaf with a few changes that was even better to me! I switched out half the white flour for whole wheat flour, used olive oil instead of the butter, and I added an extra TBSP of brown sugar. Easy to make, smelled FABULOUS and even my EXTREMELY picky stepdaughter, who REFUSES to eat oatmeal in any way shape or form (even cookies!!) gobbled it up and even said "Mmmmmm that's really good!" Definitely going into my rotation of breads. DELICIOUS!!!

Wow, this is so good!  Finally a recipe that uses all purpose flour.  I used the unbleach all purpose flour and following the directions exactly, except the order of the ingredients into the bread machine.  Did liquid first and the salt and brown sugar.  Then the margarine, oats and then flour.  made a little crater in the top center and added the yeast.  It made such a fluffy bread!! This is the first loaf of bread I ever made.   The machine I have in around 10 years old, someone gave it to me and had only used it a couple times.  Anyway, this is a good starter to make into other favored breads.  I'm going the make apple cinnamon raisin bread from this by adding another 1 tbsp brown sugar (3 tbsp total), 1/2 cup raisins, 1/2 cup nuts, 1 tsp cinnamon, 1/8 tsp nutmeg, and 1/8 tsp ginger.  For the liquid, 3/4 cup applesauce, 1/2 cup water.  Thank you for sharing the recipe!!

I think the reviewers who stated that it didn't rise well or had a too dense texture let the yeast touch a liquid before baking it in the bread machine. My bread machine instructions states never to let the yeast touch any liquid or it will not rise well. (some may argue with this, but I found it to be true.)So I changed the order of ingredients so that the flour was last, before adding the yeast. This is excellent oat bread. I followed others reviews and added honey instead of brown sugar and olive oil instead of margarine, otherwise did not change anything. This bread makes a great toast for breakfast as well as sandwiches. My family asked if I could pack their sandwiches with this so I will be making this bread at least 3x a week.

This is a really awesome recipe!!! It came out tender, moist and beautiful! It's great in a sandwich or just a piece on it's own with a little butter. I don't use a bread maker, so I mixed the dry ingredients together, the yeast with the water and 4 T honey instead of brown sugar for personal preference. I mixed the wet & dry, and since the dough was really wet, I just rounded it out with the spoon and left it in the bowl covered with a piece of plastic wrap to let it rise. An hour later I kneaded it about 4 minutes with 1/2 cup of flour on the board, put in it one bread pan and let it rise for another hour. I baked at 350 for about 25 minutes (we like our bread soft... it could be baked a little longer if you like it crispy). This is definitely a keeper!

I make 4 loaves of this every couple of weeks, slice and freeze, then toast when required. This is a fantastic recipe. I don't use the breadmaker. Instead, I use my kitchen aid and shape by hand. I often use 50% wheat flour with 50% white flour. I also add linseeds, pumpkin seeds and other nuts. FANTASTIC and very versatile! Thank you

Changed servings to 16 to make a 2lb loaf. Used milk and melted the butter into it. Subbed about 1.5 cups of whole wheat for all purpose flour. This looks, smells and tastes awesome.

Followed the directions exactly. Dough was really wet and during baking in my bread machine, the top sunk. Came out gummy, but still had a good taste.

The first time I made this I followed the recipe exactly and it was DELICIOUS!! This bread is so moist and soft. We ate the whole loaf in one night. The second I thought I would try to make it a little healthier. I used 1 TBL of raw sugar instead of 1 TBL of  brown sugar. I also substituted olive oil for the margarine. I added 2 TBL of ground flaxseed to add some more fiber and used 1/2 c wheat flour with 2 1/2 c all purpose.

An excellent bread. I did it all by hand. I  also make it in a wheat bread, using half wheat, half white flour. I also chop up sun flower seeds, a little, and through them in as well.

Finally after two months with my new bread machine I found it. After making bread after bread most turning out dense, I thought ok what's the use might as well try this one too. Well throw away your other recipes this is the keeper of all time. Its not dense or dry or flowing out of my bread machine. It is a LIGHT, AIRY and VERY TASTY bread, great either in a sandwich plain and/or toasted. Only did minor changes - I used instead butter, honey and instant oats which you don't even know is in there. I also put my yeast in first with the warm water to get it started. Thank You so very much

Best bread I have ever made! I did not use a breadmaker. I used regular oatmeal and soaked it in very hot water and added salt sugar butter, let it cool to very warm then added yeast to dissolve. I then added this to the flour. I did not quite use 6 cups of flour when doubling recipe. Bake at 350 for 25 minutes, cover with for 15 to 20 more.

I have made this a few times now and it really is a great recipe.  Generally the only change I made was to use canola oil instead of marg / butter.  The most recent time I made this I upped the oats to 1 cup and dropped the flour by half a cup and it was just as good, still very light with a sweet oaty flavour.  We think it makes the most amazing tuna salad sandwiches!

This was a really good recipe!  I followed the recommendation and used 3/4 whole wheat flour and I used butter instead of margarine just as personal preference and I was impressed with the results.  We used it for sandwiches...I thought it was a little dry (probably b/c of the whole wheat flour) but other than that it's a good bread recipe to use instead of eating store bought bread filled with additives and preservatives.  This one is a keeper!

Perfect!  My daughters both love this and half the loaf is gone before I can even put it in a bag for sandwiches.  I used quick oats as that's what I had on hand and used half wheat flour.  The crust has this slightly crisp texture that is amazing.  I set my bread maker to "light" for the crust and 1.5 pounds.  This will likely be our regular sandwich bread.

A very nice bread that came out moist and fluffy. 
(I added wheat gluten - 3 tsp, and some whole wheat flour.  Added a bit of honey like others did, too.)

I am giving this bread 5 stars due to its simplicity and excellent results.  I followed the recipe exactly after reading the other reviews, but did have to add additional flour each time I made it.  Would hesitate to change the recipe though because breadmaking is different on different days.  Used the dough cycle, split finished dough into 2, shaped into loaves, in 2 aluminum bread pans about the size of loaf pans, and raised them by turning oven to 150, then turning it off, raising for about 30 min.  Baked at 375 for 30 min. starting from the slightly-warmed oven.  Browned and sliced like a dream, toasted well, delish!

Great loaf of bread!  I used the overnight setting on my bread machine and was pleasantly surprised.  The bread was soft, fresh, and tasty, and the crust is perfect. I did not stray from the recipe other than using butter instead of margarine.  Next time I too will be trying it with a little added honey.  Thanks for the great recipe!  Update:  I just made this again with the other reviewers suggestion of adding honey, I added 2 tbsp to the wet ingredients. It was really good, the kids loved it and polished it off in no time!  I personally like it either way, as written, and with honey added for something different.  I highly recommend this recipe.

This is a fantastic every day bread recipe that can be modified as needed. It comes out moist and pretty fluffy, though still hearty like homemade bread should be! I added honey and used whole wheat bread flour (with 1 T gluten added per cup flour) and it came out very nice. I will try upping the oats next time to give it a little more crunch as they really do disappear into the bread.

Was expecting to be blow away based on the other reviews.  The texture was nice and even in my cheapo-generic bread maker, the coloring was gorgeous, but I thought the finished bread needed a little something more in order to stand on its own.  It was a little too plain.  Doubling the brown sugar to 1/4 cup and adding a tbsp or two of flour made it just about perfect for my taste.  As a general purpose bread for sandwiches, toast, etc. I can't think of another recipe I've tasted that is better.  I only give it 4 stars because I prefer a whole grain bread.  As a note, I had best results using only all-purpose flour (which is how the recipe is written).  My experiment with using bread flour turned out a loaf that was a bit gluey.

This is one of our top fave breads! I added an extra tbl of brown sugar and a full 2 1/4 tsp yeast. Makes a big, fluffy, delicious loaf of bread. I'm lucky if it's cool before it's gone.

Amazing!! You've got to make this bread. I rec'd a breadmaker 7 yrs ago and never took it out of the box until today, when I saw this recipe. I keep smacking myself in the head as to why I waited so long to use my breadmaker! My 10 yr old son gobbled up this bread so fast and wants me to make more already.

This recipe had potential. It had an awesome flavor that made you want more, but unfortunately my bread machine didn't perform. It's an old model with a hole at the bottom. When the cycles were finished, the bread was undercooked, didn't rise well, and the crust was mostly white. I finished it off in the oven but it still wasn't done. I think I need a new machine.

Very good bread.  I used 2c. AP flour and 1c. bread flour.  It did not collapse as my bread usually does.  I will try using honey instead of brown sugar next time.

This recipe is dead on!  Beautiful crust, and rose to fill the entire bread machine.  This is truly a go-with-everything bread.  I used the Pillsbury "best for bread" flour and it was exceptional.

Very, very, good, light in texture, bread! 10/5!
Various spices found in breads,could also change the flavor. Feed the bread machine the ingredients as they are found too.

Very happy with the results, yummy bread that holds together as a sandwich bread.  Adapted due to lack of bread machine- mixed lukewarm water, yeast, and brown sugar.  Allowed yeast to bloom, about 5 minutes.  Added butter.  Whisked together remaining ingredients and added a little at a time to wet ingredients.  Allowed to rise until doubled in size.  Placed in large loaf pan, allowed to rise another 20 minutes.  Baked 30 minutes, topped with melted butter.

Wonderful ! I followed some of the advice and it turned out great.  I used 1 cup of oat, 1 cup of whole wheat and 2.5 cups white flour and used butter instead of margarine.  This is now my favorite recipe for bread machine bread.

I loved this great recipe! I used the directions one of the users gave me because I didn't have a bread machine, and it turned out very well baked and with a nice crust! It remained warm and solid for the night, and to be honest while the dough was rising I couldn't keep myself from snacking on some of the leftover pieces in the large bowl I mixed it in! Though something I would recommend; add a about  half a cup of oats more if you want some major texture and taste! Five stars! I will definitely be making this again.

If I could give this bread more stars I would. By far the best white bread I have come across on this site. The only change I made was to use butter instead of margarine, and I mixed/kneaded in my kitchen aid and then baked in the oven at 350 for 37 minutes. I will be doubling the recipe next time, 1 loaf just isn't enough!

I make this bread about 3 times a month and have never taken the time to rate it.  I do use 1c. wheat flour and 2 c. regular bread flour though.  As other reviewers have suggested, I increase the brown sugar to 3 T. instead of 2 T.  And I always add a bit of milk (usually 1 T.) in place of the water for a softer crust.  At times I have also replaced the margarine with olive oil.  Sorry for the many changes but I think once you get used to a recipe, it's fun to change it up a bit for variety.

ALright recipe, soaking oats in buttermilk prior to adding would give the loaf a much finer texture. I found the crust too heavy. Flavour was very nice and it cuts and toasts well for an oat bread. My husband however loved the heavier crust. But as he is not a chef I have over ruled his 7/10 and awarded my 6/10. Abit bit of tweaking and this could be a great recipe. Thank you for sharing :)

Great bread!  My friend made this and used one tablespoon of coconut cream and one tablespoon of butter.  She also did half wheat and white flour and did 3 tablespoons of honey instead of brown sugar.  EXCELLENT!! I doubled the recipe last night and loved it.  I had to use oil instead of butter, because I ran out of butter.  I also substituted honey for brown sugar and added a tad more yeast.  It is such a hearty bread.  Oh yea, I also added a tablespoon of flaxseed.

Good, made with White Whole Wheat flour, I might use honey next time instead of the brown sugar which did not add enough flavor.  But had a great rise and a beautiful looking loaf!

I made this with my new bread machine and I could not believe the results. This bread has a lightness and sponginess that is unparalleled. It is so delicious and healthy ( no preservatives) that I cannot see myself spending money on grocery bread again. This is an easy and awesome recipe. Will try the wholewheat version another reviewer used the next time.

This was great!  I hand kneaded this, as I don't have a bread machine.  I also used butter.  It was absolutely great.  A nice flavor, hearty enough to slice for sandwiches, and it rose nicely.  I recommend!

One of our favourite breads.  I added 3 tablespoons of brown sugar instead of 2 and 2 cups of ww flour and 1 cup of white flour instead of all white.  Very good.  Great for lunch bread.

Loved this bread.  Slow to rise at first, but ends up tall and fluffy, with a great taste.  Can't even tell there's oatmeal in it, although I'm sure the oatmeal contributes to the moistness and the taste. Making this for the second time right now.

A perfect recipe. I made an oat bread based on a recipe that came with my bread machine. It was a disaster. I was a little worried about trying this one BUT it was simply amazing! I followed the recipe and it came out just as most describe it: light, fluffy, tasty, lovely crust. Yum! This is a keeper.

This bread was awesome!  I made it by hand, and for the first time, I let it rise with a wet dishtowel covering it.  I also used 1/2 whole wheat flour.  This recipe is a keeper for sure.  Thank you!

Good flavor, mine over rose and spilled out of the pan and then the top sunk. Seems a bit dense or chewy. I used all new ingredients. Not sure what happened?

This recipe is a fantastic base model. I use olive oil for the fat and then use a combination of whole grain flours to equal 3 cups. I've tried, one cup of all purpose with 2 cups of whole wheat, one cup of all purpose with one cup of whole wheat and one cup of rye, but my favourite is with all purpose and seven grain. I use the light crust setting on the bread machine and it seems to be not so tough on the crust.. a bit softer. Have fun experimenting with the combos!

It is a great oatmeal bread. But I usually let the yeast grow for 10 minutes in the worm water with sugar in a bread machine pan, then I add the rest of ingredients and turn my machine on. This way the bread is guarantee to rise, and it comes out very fluffy. I will use this recipe again.

Make this for someone who only likes white bread.  They won't know the difference.  My guy said it was the best bread I'd ever made!  Didn't tell him it had oatmeal in it!

Great!  Perfect taste and texture.  It was so soft that I almost couldn't cut it into good slices.  I think I may have accidentally put in too much yeast because it nearly blew the lid off my breadmaker!  Will definitely make again.

Oh my heaven! If I could give this 10 stars I would. I cannot believe how delicious this was. The outside was crusty and the inside was soft and fluffy. I had to cut the recipe down to 6 servings because I could only use 2C flour max for my machine. As a vegan, I substituted the margarine for Earth Balance Buttery Spread (so good) and added 1Tb soy milk. This will be my go-to recipe from now on. Thanks so much! Update: I have baked this 3 times within a week already. That's how good this is. Just noting that it's fabulous toasted too.

OMG.  Someone please stop me from eating the entire loaf in one sitting!  Amazing bread and very easy.  I used 1 C Whole wheat/2 cups bread flour, honey instead of brown sugar (3 T) and added 3 T of gluten.  I am a bit worried about my waistline, though, as I see myself eating much more bread after finding this recipe.

After about 20 different recipes with generally good, but not excellent results, I discovered the Light Oat Bread recipe.  I used my Yojirushi bread maker and it turned out perfectly!  It will be a standard item in my household; light, tasty,perfect for toast, and the oats simply integrate themselves into the texture.  I am experimenting with replacing some amount of the bread flour with white whole wheat and substitution maple syrup for the brown sugar.  Will let you know the results in a subsequent post.

Very good recipe, I prefer whole wheat bread so I modified a little, did not use any all-purpose flour, instead used 1 1/2 cup bread flour and 1 1/2 cup whole wheat flour.  And then baked in my bread machine on Whole wheat setting. Turned out really good very flavorful and moist.

Great tasting bread. My boys 7 and 9 year old really loved it. My husband and I liked it as well. I have made different breads in my bread machine and this I rate as one that I intend to use often. I didn't have 3 cups of reg. white flour only 1 cup so I used 2 cups bread flour and 1 cup white all purpose flour. Someone on the site mentioned that the oats give it some gluten so I decreased the oats by taking away 3 tablespoons. The bread turned out great except it sunk in the middle a little. Nevertheless, it didn't change the bread flavor or texture it still was delicious. Maybe I just need to add a tiny bit less of the yeast. Maybe that was the problem or maybe because I used some bread flour in the recipe.

The oats just disappear into the bread (making it popular with grandchildren). I used 'white whole wheat' flour and removed it from bread machine after the dough cycle. Baked at 350 until I thought it was done.

Almost a five-star recipe, except for the fact that it's a bit short on flour.  I added about 1/4 c. more flour to make it just right.  To make it more healthy (I'm trying to lower my cholesterol), I followed previous reviewers' suggestions to use honey in place of the brown sugar and use 1 c. wheat flour and 2 c. all-purpose flour.  I also added 1 T. milled flax seed as one reviewer suggested.  As I always do, I made this on the dough setting in my bread machine, shaped it into loaves, let it rise in a warm place for an hour, and baked it in my oven at 400 degrees for about 20 min.  As my husband says, "Nothing beats fresh, homemade bread!"

Amazing!  This is only my second attempt at bread and it turned out 100% excellent.  My wife and I ate a whole loaf of it in one day! I didn't use a bread machine (don't own one) just a loaf pan.  Instead of using the plain oats, used a mix of 1/4 c oat bran and 1/4 c milled flax seeds.  Also, before putting the loaf in to bake, brushed the top of the loaf with a mix of melted butter and honey.  Sprinkled some raw oats on the top as well.  The crust was delicious and slightly crispy, the bread was moist and chewy. Much better than store bought!  Thanks for the great recipe!

After reading all the reviews I was excited to make this bread.  I was not impressed.  It's okay, but not the best I've ever had...it seems to be lacking in flavor.

I've made this so many times now and it turns out perfectly each time. I follow the written recipe except I use only 2.5 cups of white flour and 0.5 cups of whole wheat. I do it on the light crust setting and it comes out beautifully golden but still with a reasonably soft crust. By far my favourite bread recipe!

So good!  I tripled the amount of quick oats because I like 'em, and you couldn't even tell it was in the bread.  The oatmeal must've cooked within the dough and blended in.  Next time I might add even more oatmeal for nutritional value.  I used the basic dough cycle on light setting, and it yielded a crispy crust with a soft interior.  It has a subtle taste like white bread.

Someone suggested this bread and I am certainly glad that I made it.  Very tender, light and just sweet enough.  I used 1/2 whole wheat flour and subbed olive oil for the margarine.  Will be making this often!

This was the first recipe I used in my bread machine. I was looking for a recipe that didnt require bread flour as I couldnt find any in my local supermarket and I didnt want to wait any longer finding it to use my machine. I followed this recipe exactly and this bread was fantastic. It was a simple bread, perfect for sandwiches. However, my husband and I were so impressed that I (the bread machine) made such a good bread that we nearly ate half the loaf, warm, right out of the oven. It was a dense bread which is perfect for any sloppy kind of filling because it holds up strong, I used a chicken salad. I'm very happy that my first attempt at using the machine went so well and I cant wait to use it again! Thanks !

Awesome! I have used a lot of bread machine recipes and this one is a keeper! Super duper moist. I did add buttermilk in place of some of the water and added just a bit of olive oil and some ground golden flax and rosemary. Sooo good!

YUM-O! This bread is so good. It smelled wonderful while it was baking & the taste when it was done did NOT disappoint. There were only 3 of us for dinner, & yet the bread was gone in no time. I was going to upload a picture of it, but that didn't happen as it was gone before I could remember to get my camera. Luckily it finished baking the same time dinner was ready or we would've eaten it all up as soon as it came out of the machine, regardless of dinner. We spread softened butter on the slices & drizzled honey too. It was hard to stop making continual yummy sounds with every bite. The only changes I made is that I used Rapid Rise Yeast & Quick Cook Oats as that's all I had on hand & also because I like my bread a little sweeter, I added an extra tablespoon of brown sugar. When it first came out the sides were slightly crunchy, against the soft fluffy middle & was just heavenly. The oats just melt away into the bread. A delightful bread that has just earned a place in my favorites list. Thank You for sharing this recipe.

This is a wonderful bread recipe; even better with some modifications that I made.  For an absolutely amazing bread....use a light beer such as PBR instead of water.  I also added about 1/2 cup of sunflower seeds.  Very yummy!

This bread is pretty good.  Wonderful texture.  Great for sandwiches.  I didn't have any plain flour so I used 2 cups of white bread flour and 1 cup of normal wholewheat flour.  I also added 2tbsp of ground flax.  I will try subbing the brown sugar for honey next time as others have suggested.

Very good bread. I used quick oats and they distributed nicely throughout the dough. Very nice flavor, cuts easily and makes great toast and sandwiches. I added 2 T. vital wheat gluten since I used ap flour and it rose nicely and has a great texture. Definitely a keeper.

This bread is wonderful! I added 2 tablespoons of honey because my husband loves honey bread but did everything else the same. The bread turned out tall and fluffy and tastes wonderful! I'll definitely be making this again!

This is a great bread machine bread.  It is soft and moist like white bread, but has the goodness of oats.  My kids love this bread and I get rave reviews everytime I make it.

This is one of the best bread machine recipes I have tasted. I followed the directions exactly, and even baked on a delayed, overnight cycle. Just be sure to measure the yeast correctly, as it doesn't need an entire little "packet".

Wonderful texture!! The oats truly disappear. I did add 2 T wheat germ, used 3/4 C whole wheat flour in place of some of the white and added 1/2 powdered milk just to boost the protein and make it healthier. It still turned out light and tasty.

This bread is fantastic! It quickly became a staple and I make it every week for our sandwich bread. The first time I made it, I made it exactly like the recipe says and it is wonderful. When I want a wheat bread, I just use half wheat flour and half white flour. Sometimes I up the honey to 2T and brown sugar to 2T because I like sweet bread. Thanks for a fabulous recipe!

This bread is wonderful!  So moist and delicious, I can't stop eating.  I'll be making another loaf soon.  The only change I made is I used 1/4 cup of honey in place of the brown sugar.  It adds just a nice hint of honey taste that I was looking for.  Great recipe.

Lovely bread it tastes a little nutty to me.  I used bread flour.  I mixed in the bread machine and separated in to two small loaves.  Baked the next day 45 minutes at 350*.

Omigosh! Excellent! So light and fluffy and delicious! But I did make several changes and did not use a bread machine. I used 1c water, 3c flour, 1/2c oats, 1tsp white sugar, 2tsp brown sugar, 1tbl butter, 1 tbl olive oil, same amt of yeast, 1/2tsp of salt, and used my Kitchen Aid to knead until elastic. And then I let it rise 60 min, punched it down, let it rise 30 more minutes, punched it down, braided it, let it rise 30 more minutes, and then baked it after brushing the dough with milk and sprinkling with sesame seeds for 30 minutes in 350F oven. Thank you for the great recipe!

This bread is good! I DIDN'T USE A BREAD MACHINE. add sugar, warm water, melted butter,yeast and let stand 5 min. add dry ingredients to a seperate bowl then mix(I also added 1 Tbsp dough enhancer). add wet ingredients and knead till gluten is formed, let rise 1hour then punch down and let rise in an oiled loaf pan. cook at 350 for 30 min, or till light golden brown.

Excellent and easy recipe.  I doubled the recipe and used my stand mixer.  I then made one large ball to use for a bread bowl dip and the size of the round loaf is perfect for a double-batch of dip.

I don't take my bread machine out often but it has been out several days now because my   family is eating it almost as fast as I can make it. I'm so happy they're eating something besides processed white bread!

Very good, I've made this twice using my breadmaker for the dough cycle, and then turning the dough out onto a floured counter and reshaping into a normal sized loaf pan.  Makes a delicious bread good to accompany dinner, and I used leftovers for French Toast.  I also used bread flour combined with whole-wheat flour.

I have finally found my family's favorite bread...Its one we can all agree on.  The first time I made this we sat at the table and ate it all hot from the breadmachine.  I have since made it several times.  I do however use butter instead of margarine; I also added about 3-tbsp honey to the recipe...Very delicious.

I was afraid that the oats would be gritty in the bread, but they baked right in. You can't really even find them as you're enjoying each bite. I love this bread. I added 2 tablespoons of honey because honey oat is one of my favorites, and I don't think I will ever purchase another honey oat loaf of bread from the store again. I brought it to work to share with the lunch group and they all loved it too. They all said that it was moist and light. A+ for this recipe. (I'm a teacher.)

I have now made this recipe twice, and it turned out perfectly both times. It is truly light -- rather than slightly dense, as many bread machine breads seem to turn out -- and is perfect for everything from eating solo to sandwiches. I think this will be our mainstay bread over time. The crust is crisp and crunchy, even on the lightest setting, and the inside is moist and airy. Also, it is super easy and inexpensive to prepare, as well as nutritious. Can't beat it.

This bread is fantastic!  We usually buy Aldy's Oat Bread and this texture is just like it - very soft and not coarse and heavy like some homemade breads.  The only things I altered were adding an extra tablespoon of brown sugar and I used olive oil instead of the butter.  Thanks for the great recipe!

This is the first bread that doesn't have an overly dense consistency and a crumbly texture.  Very tender and light, like store bought bread.  I'm very pleased with this recipe!  I can't wait to make it again.

Wonderful tender texture with a crisp crust!  It really slices well.  I processed it on the dough cycle, then placed it into a bread pan, baked at 450 10 minutes, then decreased temp to 350 until done.  I also used bread flour instead of all purpose.  This is the best sandwich bread I have ever made!

I've tried several BM recipes off ALLRECIPES.COM and to date, this one is BY FAR the best one. My only concern is that the posted recipe creates a loaf that is a bit large for my BM and causes the loaf to hit the lid in its final cycle.  Other than that, it is truly a WONDERUL loaf of bread and I have yet to find anything that approaches the same appeal. (Good as bread, but best as toast and fresh out of the machine.)

Very nice, light oat bread.  I like to 
add a bit more oatmeal, so I cut back on
the flour to even it out.

I LOVED this recipe! I made it in my bread machine on the dough setting then rolled it up, threw it in a breakdown and let it rise again, and baked it in the oven. The only 2 changes I made was I used whey instead of water (had some leftover from making yogurt) and added a couple of tablespoons of

This is such a great recipe! I ran out of white flour and ended up using 1 1/2 c. white 1 1/2 c. wheat, and it was still delicious. I just added a little extra water. I also use olive oil instead of margarine because of a dairy allergy.

Wife and friends love this bread.  It has a little more texture than a plain white loaf but still soft, not chewy.  I use Breadman bread machine, has a tendency to rise too long on normal settings so that loaf falls during baking.  I've had some luck fixing that by reducing the yeast somewhat.

AMAZING! After a couple of years of hiding from my bread maker, with Easter coming I finally took it out of storage and trued a few recipes on this site. I tossed all the ingredients into it and set the dough cycle and crossed my fingers. I took the lovely, soft dough out, formed it into 8 rolls and placed them inti a 9x13 pan spaced apart. I covered them with a tea towel and placed it in my oven which I briefly heated to 100f, but had the door open for a few minutes to cool slightly. I set the timer for 1hour,  took them out and they had risen to touch each other lightly. They baked up beautifully in 20 minutes! They were light, fluffy and just slightly sweet.......how delicious! I will make them again and again!! Thank you for this lovely recipe!
Now I have 2 other reviews for the 3 successes I had in the past 2days!!!

Wanted a good bread machine recipe that featured oats instead of whole wheat (daughter is allergic). My husband says this is the best bread he's ever eaten! I followed the recipe with a couple modifications: 2 tsp of salt and 1 cup of bread flour substituted for one of the cups of regular flour. I also don't like the bread to knead up too dry, so I added a couple splashes of buttermilk as it mixed. It baked up huge and fluffy and soft! The rolled oats provide just a bit of texture; I may put just a little more in next time. So easy and so good! Making it again as soon as the first loaf is gone!

This bread is so tasty. I will admit while I was first putting the ingredients into the machine it smelled awful... Like burnt plastic. After it finished though the house smelled amazing, i'm eating my bread right now. Has a very light texture, crust is great. Next time i will either use bread flower, or some wheat flower to see what happens. Overall a great recipe, and cheap to make. I'm thinking about also using honey instead of the sugar.

Yummy! Made without a bread machine but proofing the yeast with water and brown sugar for 20 minutes, then added the rest of the ingredients.  I used my dough hooks on my hand mixer to blend ingredients and knead.  I also used half white wheat flour and half AP flour for extra grains! Already have many requests for more!

Great bread recipe, that I've made repeatedly. I use canola oil instead of butter, and it still turns out fine. If I feel like I want a denser, oatier loaf, I use 1 cup of oats to 2.5 cups of flour.

Excellent basic recipe as is, but also terrific with a few healthly additions.  In consideration for my Type II diabetic husband, I tossed in a couple of tablespoons each of flax seeds, millet, sesame seeds and cornmeal.  This adds heft to the loaf with complex carbs (digested more slowly) and a protein boost as well.  Thank you for a wonderful recipe!

Excellent!  I bake in my oven as opposed to the machine for a better result.  I also often sub honey for the sugar and some olive oil in place of the butter.

I used butter in place of margarine but that is the only variant I did.

I made this to dip in a homemade soup.  I liked that it was light and contained oats, however it was quite dense and also very easily fell apart.  So, I am not sure it was the best choice as a dipping bread.  A tad on the bland side too, though it was quite easy.

The perfect all around bread....great for sandwiches, toast, everything. I haven't bought bread in 2 months! I did discover that it works best with half bread flour & half unlbleached all purpose flour.

Amazing....

I followed Jules review advice because I don't have a bread maker and it turned out perfect! Thanks Jules. Her review as follows:

Loved it! Best bread I have ever made. I didn't use a bread machine. Instead I did the following: mixed dry ingredients in large bowl. Combined yeast, honey (in place of sugar), butter, and warm water in a separate bowl. Mixed until dissolved and left to sit a couple minutes until creamy. Added yeast mixture to dry ingredients. After kneeding the dough for a while, 10-15 minutes or so, I left it to rise until it was just over double the size. Punched it down. Put dough into bread pan and left to rise again. Baked in the oven for 35 minutes at 350 degrees. Yum! The crust of this bread is amazing. I will definitely be making this bread again and again.

This is my go-to bread recipe. 
I use a 1cup oats, 1 cup all-purpose and 1.5 cup whole wheat split for the flours. 
Have made it into dinner rolls - baked in the oven at 350 for 20 minutes...delish!

This bread was rather bland and didn't taste of oats. The ratio of liquid to dry ingredients is correct though. Will not make again.

My whole family loved this loaf. At my elevation (4000ft) it rose better with an added tblsp of white sugar and an extra half tsp of yeast. Thanks. :)

This is a solid 5 stars! Slices beautifully ,
Kids and husband gave it a seal of approval.
I do cook it in the over because I prefer the 
Shape of the loaf.

This was super-delicious! Next time, I think I am going to set my breadmaker on medium instead of light to get a bit more brown on the crust.

I made as directed, but only used the bread machine to mix kneed and rise. The bread didn't rise in the oven as much as I would have liked during cooking. maybe the standard amnt of yeast would help. Taste was great, a little more chewy than other breads Ive made but good. I may try it with more yeast next time in hopes of a lighter, less dense chewy bread.

This is a very simple recipe, that came out really fluffy and moist. I did not have a bread machine, so I kneaded the bread by hand until window pane, then let the dough rise until double in size then panned it into a bread pan...and let it proof until the dough reached the tip of the rim. Baked it and it came out great!

thanks for the recipe.

I have made this recipe since I got my bread machine a few months ago.
I make exactly as written and my daycare children love it.
I do make mine on the dough cycle and bake it in the oven, but I do that with all my bread because I don't like the hole in the machine bread that the paddle leaves.
I wouldn't change a thing, just follow the directions on the recipe and you should be very happy.

This is one of my go to recipes when I don't know what bread to make.  I love the taste and texture.  The only changes I make is using honey instead of brown sugar and using 2c ww flour, 1c ap flour.

Made this recipe as is, and it was good.  Made it again with some minor changes, and it was off the charts.  I used 2T oil instead of margarine, I used 2T honey instead of sugar, and added in 2T of molasses. I also opted to use the Fast Bake setting on my bread machine.  Could barely wait for it to cool, before we all dove in.  Great as is, and even better as a sandwich!

This is great! I used honey instead of brown sugar, and canola oil instead of margarine. Very soft and fluffy inside, with a terrific crust. Yum!

This is only the 2nd loaf of bread I've ever made in my breadmaker.  I'm so delighted with the results!  The crust is nice and golden without being too brown or tough.  The bread has a nice texture (the oats do magically disappear) and is soft but not chewy.  It's not too dry or too moist - it's just right.  I have a Breadman Pro TR875 and used the Basic Light setting and made a 2 lb. loaf.  The only changes I made to the recipe were to substitute 1 3/4 tablespoons of oil for the margarine and to use quick oats instead of regular rolled oats since I didn't have any on hand.  I'm going to try other bread recipes for the fun of it but this recipe's a keeper!

To the reviewer who did not like this loaf because it was too light and smooth textured...I had run out of bread and made this loaf except I had no rolled oats.  I only had pin oats (found in World Markets) so I used that instead.  The loaf turned out fantastic!  It was still super light and fluffy, but it had that wonderful pin oat texture to go along with it.  So if you prefer a bit of texture, try pin oats instead because they do not "disappear" when baked like the rolled oats do.  I loved this loaf and will make with rolled oats the next time as well.

This is delicious!  The first time I made it I used regular yeast and it came up a little short and heavy, so I used rapid yeast the 2nd time and it was perfect!  The flavor is just delicious.  I am vegan so I substituted vegan margarine and it worked just fine.

I made this one afternoon.  I put everything as is in the bread machine.  It came out beautifully, smelled awesome and was delicious.  My four kids and my husband and myself ate the entire loaf in one sitting because it was just so delicious fresh and hot.  Awesome, awesome, awesome as is!

WOW. I just pulled my bread machine out from the cobwebs and this was an AWESOME recipe to get it back in gear. I used 2 T of honey in place of the brown sugar and served with honey and butter, too.  Delicious.  Will make a gain, and again, and again! Thanks for sharing Litsters!

Easy and good bread recipe. I used 2 parts white and 1 part wheat flour and rather than 1 cup oats - 1/2 cup oatmeal and 1/2 cup ground flax and it still turned out great.

Great bread recipe.  I have made it three times and it's been wonderful.  Great texture, not too heavy-good for toast or sandwiches.  I used 3T honey instead of brown sugar just because I didn't have the sugar and it turned out fine.  Off to make another loaf right now!

This is my everyday bread I bake for use in sandwiches or dinner bread. The only change I have made to the recipe is to sub out the white flour with 1 cup rye flour and 2 cups whole wheat flour and olive oil instead of butter. Add 2 tsps of vital wheat gluten and bake as the recipe calls for. You may need to add a little more water and I suggest sifting the flour.

This is the first recipe I've rated, but my husband and I really liked this bread.  I made 2 loaves, the first following the recipe exactly and the second The only thing I did different was add 1/4 cup of honey and we both really love the flavor and sweetness it added.  I will continue making this bread and adding the honey!

excellent recipe, as others said ingredients are spot on, with the exception of about 1/3 c more water.  Also, I only used the dough function on my bread machine, put in a bread pan (sprayed with pam), let it rise again  for about 1/2 hour and baked @ 350 for about 55 minutes.  So yummy I just finished a piece.  Thanks for sharing!

Yummy!! You can do so much with this bread, before it's baked and after it's baked!  It's very versatile in that it can be used for either sweet or savory toppings.  I used bread flour instead of all-purpose, so my bread was extra elastic-y.  I also cut down on 6tbs of flour and added 3 tbs hemp seeds and 3 tbs flax seeds for added protein/nutrition.  I also upped the sugar by 1 tbs and decreased the salt to 3/4tsp for better rising.  Lastly, I substituted the water for soymilk.    I made two small (but hearty sized) loafs by hand, following Jule's instructions.  During the baking process, I used a spray bottle to moisten the bread & harden the crust.  Give your loaf(s) a couple spritzes of water every 10 minutes for a beautiful and crunch crust!  I ended up baking the loafs for 35 minutes.  =) I don't regret the time I spent making it when I could have been using it to study for my midterms.  You won't either!  Mm study food.

This is a great bread for bread machines!  Quick and easy, great texture, wonderful toast.  I've experimented a bunch.  I am back to the original recipe, except I use 3 1/2 c flour vs the called for 3 c, no more falling, ever.  IMHO it is best if baked outside the machine.  That extra rise time makes it perfect.  I use "dough" program (90) minutes, then remove, squash out, tri-fold, put in large bread pan, or 2 small ones, let rise another 90 minutes, bake 30 mins at 350.  A much more satisfying loaf.  If you try this, you will need the extra 1/2 cup flour, otherwise dough is too wet to smash down and tri-fold.

This is very good bread and easy to make.  I used 1/2 cup whole wheat flour in place of all-purpose. I used the dough setting on my bread maker and put the bread in my own bread pans to bake in the oven.  For this it takes 2 bread pans.  For a little extra added touch sprinkle some rolled oats on top before you bake it in the oven.

This is wonderful! The only change I made was using 3TB of brown sugar instead of 2. I think the texture is great- not too dense and not too fluffy. I baked it on light crust. I love that I always have these ingredients on hand. AND- the recipe is way easy for the payoff. This just might be my go-to  bread from now on.

Really easy, really good.  I've made this recipe twice now, once in my bread machine and once in the oven, substituting whole wheat flour for the white both times.  I added 4 teaspoons of vital wheat gluten as well.

BEST bread I've ever made! I followed advice of other reviewers and made it on dough cycle in my machine and then baked at 350 for 30-35 minutes. After a few successful batches, I'm now going to try adding flax and some seeds.  The only drawback I can see is that I think I ate half the first loaf by myself!!

Wow! This is a gorgeous, lovely bread!  It's one of the simplest and tasty recipes I've tried!  Used dough cycle on the bread machine, turned it out, shaped the loaf and put in in a 9x4 loaf pan. Covered it in plastic wrap and let it rise for 30 minutes and put it in a 375 degree oven for about 30 minutes or so.  It is soooo good! Oh, I also added another 1/2 tsp of yeast because mine was a little old. Beautiful rise!

Awesome bread, other reviewers were right, kids don't even see the oatmeal.  I subbed 1 cup whole wheat and it was great.  Kid's thought it tasted and looked like store bought bread.  Great texture, soft and light.  Holds together great for sandwiches.  One tip.....to cut thin slices use an electric knife!

This is AWESOME!  I made it tonight, and it is the first bread machine recipe that has actually worked for me.  I LOVE that the oats disappear into the bread, because my kids refuse to eat bread with "seeds". ;0)  They gobbled this bread right up.  My husband and I both loved it too.  I made the recipe just the way it is posted.  I also like that it calls for all purpose flour instead of bread flour.

This is a great recipe!  I don't have a bread machine, so I followed Jules instructions and mixed dry ingredients in bowl and wet in another, mixing the yeast and warm water first.  I used bread flour instead of all purpose flour.  The first loaf I made turned out very good.    On my second try of the recipe, I stuck with the bread flour and increased the salt a bit using a heaping tsp.  I also added 2 eggs which made for a lighter and finer texture.  The loaf turned out even better than my first try!  It was especially good warm out of the oven with some butter!   Baking this bread will likely become a regular Sunday morning ritual.

Delicious, quite moist and almost seemed not quite done. Next time maybe I'll use the medium instead of light setting. Am going to try with whole wheat flour next time as well.

Like other people, I didn't use a bread machine, but I did follow the instructions from Jules and it came out wonderfully! I added just a bit of extra quick oats and replaced some of the br. sugar with honey. It took a lot more flour when kneading, and a while of kneading to get it stiff enough, but that may have been the humidity here. It may also have been that I added a whole packet of yeast, which is 2 and 1/4 tsp. instead of the 1 and 1/2 the recipe called for. My family loved it and if I had the time to make home made bread every day, this would definately be a regular recipe in our house.

I've made this twice now, both times in the oven.  The first time I let it rise overnight in the fridge and today the more traditional way, on the counter.  I can honestly say this is the BEST bread I have ever had.  It is delightful toasted with butter, wonderful used in a sandwich.  I plan on toasting it for stuffing at Christmas.  Like others suggested I sub honey for the sugar (and use 3 tbsp.).  I also use real butter (I don't use margarine).  I won't by bread in the store anymore, I make this instead and my kids love it too.  Absolutely great stuff!!!

I'm not sure if I did something wrong... I followed the recipe except used butter instead of margarine and substituted half white whole wheat for half of the bread flour... I did add a tablespoon of vital wheat gluten to try to make up the difference. Anyway, I got a mess. It was raw in the middle and "fell" in the middle... Maybe my bread machine is not very good, but I've never had this particular problem before. I did notice that the dough looked "wet" to me compared to the recipes in my bread machine book. I probably should've added a bit more flour during kneading. But anyway, other people subbed for whole wheat and apparently didn't have a problem so.... I'm not sure what the problem was, but can't rate it better than a 3.

Very good! I took a risk and doubled the recipe the first time I made it and I am glad! It was fluffy with a good crust...prefect sandwich bread. I made mine by hand since I prefer bread like this when I have the time.  I also made it with 1/3 whole wheat bread flour and 2/3 of it with white bread flour.  This is a keeper for sure!

This was a good bread. I use 1 1/2 cup AP flour and 1 3/8 c. wheat flour. I added 2 T. Wheat gluten, and increased the yeast to 2 t. I also added 2 T. of honey. I do not use my bread machine for baking, therefore, I used the dough settings on the bread machine. After the cycle, I kneaded the dough a couple of times and let it rise in a baking pan for 40 minutes. I then baked it in the oven for 25 minutes at 350 degrees. The bread is light, fluffy, healthy and delicious.

Beautiful bread. Just wonderful. I don't own a bread machine but I do have a 30 year old Kitchen Aid that's still kickin' so I used that. I proofed the yeast with the brown sugar and warm water in the mixer bowl for ten minutes, then added the melted butter, and then the dry ingredients. When I switched to my dough hook, the batter was still a bit wet, so I added about 4 tbsp. more of flour to firm it up. After that, it was no problem getting it to jump on the hook. I kneaded it with the bread hook for five minutes, then patted it into a large circle and set it to rise for an hour or so in a saran wrap-covered greased bowl on my warm oven. After the hour, I formed it into a loaf and set it to rise again in the loaf pan for about 45 minutes, covered with saran wrap again. I baked it for about a half hour. Came out perfectly and the taste and smell is out of this world. Love it. NOTE: Hubs loved it, too. This is a keeper.

I was quite dissapointed in this recipe.  I made up a few bags of the dry ingrediants thinking that I would love it based upon the reviews on this site.  However each loaf I made after measuring precisely each ingrediant listed resulted in my loaves caving in on top.  The crust also became very hard and dense.  Perhaps next time I will try making this on the dough cycle only then baking it in the oven.

I'm on the quest for the perfect bread machine recipe, so I'm working my way through them all on this site. This bread turned out moist and a little dense, but didn't have the yeasty homemade taste I'm looking for. It did stale quickly as another reviewer said and became crumbly. Still it was quite good and made wonderful toast and ham sandwiches.

This bread tastes great, but I had trouble with it crumbling after the first day.  I tried to cut it thicker but it still broke apart as sandwich bread.

Very nice bread. Slight oat flavour and wonderful crust. Loose, kind of softish, moist texture. You could use this sandwich with simple flavours as the bread is a unique taste in itself.

Amazing!! I don't like my bread machine, so I did this by hand. I subbed olive oil for the margarine, did a mix of 1&1/2 cup wheat 1&1/2 cup AP white flour(plus a tiny bit more for kneading), and used honey instead of brown sugar. Though I didn't use them, Jules' instructions are right on the money. Her method is the one I've used  for years to make my everyday white bread. All in all an excellent recipe with very helpful reviews. If I could I'd give it 10 stars!

This is the first bread recipe I've managed to make without disasterous results! I made it in my bread machine (changed maybe 1/3 of the flour to wheat but otherwise followed recipe exactly), and got a huge, fluffy, delicious loaf! I can definitely see myself making this one on a regular basis from now on!  UPDATE: I just want to add, to anyone out there dieting, this bread is great for that. I used to have to snack all through my 5-hour shifts at work or I'd conk out, but now 2 slices of this stuff in the morning and I'm not even hungry till it's time to go home!

This is great.  Can't tell that there's oatmeal in the bread at all.  Does anyone know why the shelf-life for this bread seems to be longer than other homemade breads?

This is a great bread recipe.  I make the dough in my bread machine and then transfer to a bread pan, let rise and bake in the oven.  I have had many request to "bring me a loaf"

I agree that this was a very easy recipe to use with the bread machine. I used 1 1/2 cups water and a little extra salt with the second loaf, as the first was dry and dense....

Excellent. I did add 1T of vital wheat gluten, as I usually do when baking bread- but it really may not have even needed it.  This was by far one of the easiest and best bread recipes I've found yet.  Thank you!!

I dont have a breadmaker so made this by hand. Used the exact amount of ingredients but replaced butter with olive oil, added few dashed of cinnamon powder and blue gum honey instead of brown sugar. It turned out to be the softest honey oat bread ever! The dough was a bit sticky so while kneading I kept adding flour (up to 1/4c more, maybe?) to my workbench and hands til I get a smooth dough. The oats didn't completely disappear, it was still there only I think the amount of oats are not enough to show in the bread too much, which is great for hubby (whom would freak out if he sees them!) and for fussy little eaters. I would add bit more oats next time and maybe sweeten it a little? Baked in a preheated oven at 175C/350F for 30 mins. The entire house smelled of bread and honey when it was in the oven. Beautiful!

This is a good bread.  It was not quite as light as I thought it would be. I did substitute 1 cup of flour with 1 cup of whole wheat flour and added vital wheat gluten.  I will try it again with out the whole wheat flour.

This was a pretty good bread and very easy to make.  Its an excellent bread for sandwiches.  My bread machine has a 2lb capacity, I used the light setting and it came out perfect.  I did use bread flour instead of all-purpose flour.  We do like our bread a bit sweeter so next time I think I may add some Splenda.  But this was pretty good especially for how easy it was.

The same thing happened to me as Courtney.  The dough was so wet during the first kneading that it was clear it needed more flour.  It ended up like a wet brick.  I agree with Courtney, I usually use bread machine flour rather than all purpose - maybe that was the problem?

I don't have a bread machine, but I was impressed with how easy it was to make this bread. Like other cooks did, I prepared the dry ingredients and mixed the wet ones separately, then kneaded the dough for at least 10 minutes. Once the first leavening took place, I punched it down and added herbs and onion, then let it sit again for another 30 minutes. I baked as per the instructions and It ended up as a savoury herb and onion oat bread. I also agree that the crust was ever so tasty when the bread is warm or cold. I will surely be keeping this recipe for anytime I feel like making homemade bread! Thanks for sharing.

I'm not sure what went wrong with this recipe. I followed all the measurements exactly, but noticed during the first kneading cycle in my bread machine that there wasn't nearly enough flour. I must have added an extra 1/2 cup or more to get it to the right consistency. The inside was not fully cooked when I used the light crust setting, and the parts that were fully baked did not hold together. I might try this recipe again with bread flour since it has such high reviews, but I was certainly very disappointed with this first attempt.

This bread is the perfect sandwich bread - not the best for just eating hot with butter (since those are best all fluffy and squishy, or crusty like french bread), but for sandwiches these are great, since you want something firmer without big air pockets that will take the beating of being bumped around in a lunch box all day! Still soft and delicious, though! This was just what I was looking for... now to find the perfect bread machine french baguette... :)

I am eating this bread right now and I LOVE  it! I used butter instead of margarine, supplemented 1/2 cup wheat flour for 1/2 cup of the white, and added 2 tablespoons of flax meal.  I also used my kitchen aid to make this.  Awesome!  Thanks!

I made the following substitutions: 2 cups wheat flour to 4 cups all-purpose (I doubled the recipe), and 1/4 honey in addition to the brown sugar. Since I don't have a bread machine, I dissolved the brown sugar in the water, then added the yeast and let it proof. Then I added the oats, salt, honey, and melted butter and stirred in the flour one cup at a time. You don't need a bread machine to make this, but I'm sure it speeds things up! The taste is very light and the oats really do disappear! It's amazing!

This is a wonderful bread recipe.  I make this bread often.  The only thing I change is that I use Scottish steel cut oatmeal.  A must to go with a hearty meal, it toasts nicely also.

ALL 5 star reviews?  I can see why!  This is one the BEST bread machine recipes out there!  Moist, flavorful, nice crust.  I even substituted a cup of whole wheat for the all purpose flour and it just turned out pefect.  I made a small loaf of bread and dinner rolls and my husband just loved it.  Many THANKS for this wonderful recipe.

This is the first recipe I've tried in the bread machine that wasn't from a mix.  It was wonderful!  It is a very versitile bread that worked well with both my breakfast and dinner the day I baked it.

When I got my bread machine for mother's day, I began to search the internet for bread recipes, after trying a few ones that turned out to be ok, I came across this one and decided to give it a try, needless to say that it was the perfect one. So far it is our favorite bread recipe.

Very good.  I thought it was nice to have a slightly healthier white bread recipe to make.  The only change I made was to use bread flour.  I will be making this again!

YUM!!
We are only new to bread making but have tried a few other recipes to get a light fluffy bread. They all turned out heavy and dense..not this one!
We are in the process of making bread rolls from this recipe.
Shall post how they turn out (a few changes)

This bread was a good base that I made some slight changes to, in order to suit my own tastes.  I substituted honey for the brown sugar, 1 cup of white flour for whole wheat flour, and 1 tablespoon of butter for 3 tablespoons of flax seed.  Then I sprinkled some wheat germ on top just before baking.  I baked it for 30 minutes at 350 degrees (thanks to previous reviewers) and it came out perfectly.

i tweaked this a little bit,  i added about a 1/2 cup sour cream, 1/2 cup whole wheat flour, 1/4 cup rye flour, and doubled the oats for more texture and fiber while the sour cream keeps it fluffy and light.  Perfect for rainy days!

This was the first recipe my husband and I tried out in our new bread machine and it came out great!  The bread had a very light and airy texture with a nice thin but crunchy crust.  We tried baking it on light and medium crust and slightly preferred it on medium.  We didn't modify the ingredients in any way.

WOW! This bread is so nice! Put all ingredients it in the machine on dough setting. Dumped it into a regular bread loaf pan. Let it sit covered to rise for half an hour. Baked in a preheated oven at 345 for 45 min. I live at 2600 feet elevation so I used slightly less water and slightly less yeast. I used quick oats instead of rolled oats. The bread is deeeelicious! My first really great loaf of bread, thank you very much.

I am new to making bread, however, I am not new to eating homemade bread. This one has an amazing flakey crust, and is really simple to make without a bread machine. Refer to the Review by Jules for instructions on how to make without a bread machine. They're spot-on!

Great flavor!  I made mistake of putting this on a 4 hour delay cycle in my bread machine and it rose up too much and fell before baking.  The center ended up a bit gummy but was still edible.  Will make it again!!

Excellent! I subbed 1 c of the all-purp with 1 c whole wheat, and it still turned out great. I just bought my machine 2nd hand for $10, but it didn't have a manual. I tried a few other recipes with little luck. This turned out a perfect all purpose bread. I'm taping it to my machine for everyday use.

Mine was not light and fluffy like other reviewers. It was a nice bread otherwise. I made it in the machine and it turned out well. Just felt like mine was a little dry but will try it again. My machine is so sensitive to weather.

Wow! This recipe is delicious. I just bought a bread machine yesterday so this is the first recipe I have used in it. I was surprised how easy it was to make something so great. (Don't laugh but when I sliced into the bread I forgot the kneading arm would be inside the bread and wondered what I was cutting into!)

This recipe turned out perfect.  I will definitely make it again.  I used butter rather than margarine. Delicious and good texture.  I will play around with this recipe some more so I can add more rolled oats.

Great recipe!  My bread machine makes a one-pound loaf, so I scaled the ingredients down to 8 servings, and it came out perfect.  I also added 2 Tbsp. of honey to the wet ingredients.

Fantastic recipe - bread was very light and tasty. I used the wholewheat setting on my bread machine and the crust was amazing - it had just the right amount of crunch. Unfortunately the top of the loaf did 'explode' out of my bread machine during the last 20 minutes of cooking. Next time I may need to reduce the amount of yeast. Will definately be making this receipe again!

Nice bread.  Mild oat flavor.  Mine caved a bit in the bread maker (but I've had that problem before, so I think it's just me or my bread maker.)  The bottom 3/4 of the loaf sliced well and was delicious for BLTs.  We used the rest for toast the next morning.  I don't think it would stay soft and fresh very long.  Will make again.

Delicious - my family couldn't get enough.  I replaced 3/4 of the flour with whole wheat flour and added 2 T honey for kicks.  Works great for sandwiches.. I sent it in my son's lunchbox today.

This bread was incredible!  I used all the called for ingredients, w/ the exception of the yeast and margarine...I used an entire packet of yeast and I used real butter.  I also added about 2 Tbsp honey, as well as 4 tsp vital wheat gluten.  I took all but 3 Tbsp of the oats, and ran them through my vitamix to make an oat flour.   I really like this bread...I've already eaten 3 slices!

This is a phenomenal bread - I have a larger machine so it baked quite light and tasty - just a hint of sweetness.  Only you will know it is not a traditional white bread recipe.  This is a keeper for sure!

Delicious! The texture is just right and the bread is not too dense. Perfect for sandwich bread. So easy to make using the dough cycle on my breadmaker. Because I prefer the shape of a traditional loaf, I took it out of the breadmaker, shaped it into a loaf pan, let it rise for 30 min., and baked at 350 deg for 30-35 min. Thanks for this terrific recipe.

So Good and So EASY!  I never cook in the bread maker, using the dough cycle then shape, put in pan, rise 30 min. and cook 30 min. at 350F.  We loved it and will make often!  Thanks

I didn't have a bread machine so I followed Jules' method. This was my first time making bread and I have to say that it was quite good. I substituted oil for the margarine and used 3 tbsp of honey (think I'll use more next time). During the last 10 minutes of baking I brushed on a mixture of honey and milk to help it brown some more.

This is the first bread machine recipe that turned out exactly perfect and very good tasting. I used Canola oil instead of margarine as I didn't have stick margarine. Just as good. About as good as it can get. Healthy too.

Good bread. I subbed olive oil for the margarine and prepared the dough using the dough cycle of my bread machine, pulled it out and let it rest for 10 minutes, shaped it for my loaf pan and allowed it to rise to 30 minutes before baking @ 350 for 30 minutes. This  resulted in a  perfect loaf of good , hearty bread.

I pulled my bread machine out of the storage room just to try this recipe, and right now I'm making it for the seocnd time in two days!! It's really very good bread. I use the quickbake setting on my bread machine, so I have  a loaf in just over an hour. It's probably a little more dense than if I'd use the regular setting, so sometime when I have time I'll try that. Added a bit more brown sugar than the 2T called for. EXCELLENT!!!

This is a fantastic tasting bread with good texture.  It was my first bread using my new bread machine and it turned out great.  I used the light crust setting and it resulted in a perfect moist center and flaky crust.  I also substituted olive oil for the butter to make it non-dairy, and it worked great.

Very good! I put everything in last night and used my delay setting. The bread was popping out of the pan this morning! I modified the recipe for a 2 lb loaf, so I ended up with 4 cups of flour and then substituted 2 cups with whole wheat flour. I also used bread flour instead of all purpose.

Excellent bread.  I was looking for a great sandwich bread and I found it!  I used some flour that I had that had some wheat flour mixed in, and it came out perfectly.  The rise and color were beautiful!  (A year later) Just wanted to add that this is my most frequently baked loaf in my house.  I like adding in wheat flour and flax seed to make it healthier.  I also turn this recipe into dinner rolls much of the time.  The rolls are baked at 350 for about 30-35 minutes.

The loaf rose so much that it was touching the top of the bread machine lid!  I thought when it said "light" that it meant color but this bread is literally lightweight.  Will make again.

Very good.  The texture seemed kind of dense so I'm not sure if it rose like it should or if that's normal for bread-machine bread.  It didn't brown that much on the top because the recipe says to put the machine on a light setting, so I did.  But it was nice golden brown on the bottom and sides.  It looks like plain white bread and the oatmeal disappears somehow. Tastes great with sandwiches or toasted.  I'll bet it would work wonderfully for french toast.

This was a great bread.  I must say, I added a few things to make it sweeter.  I increased the brown sugar to 3 tbs, added golden raisins, chopped pecans, and some flax seeds.  It was great!  Moist and dense.

this bread is one of our favorites. I make the dough in the bread machine, let it rise, and then bake in the oven at 375 for about 35 min. The crust gets nice and crunchy and the texture inside is light. great recipe. Thanks.

Baked exactly as recipe stated-VERY light, tasty, rave reviews with company.  Slightly sweet taste, which I enjoy, would have made excellent croutons or stuffing pieces, but there wasn't any left!
No after-yeast taste either, will make again!

This recipe was wonderful, it came out perfect. My fiance thought it was french bread,the oats were not even noticeable. 
So far it has come out the best from everything I have made in the bread machine.

Maybe there are better recipes somewhere on this site, but I have to say this is the first truly outstanding bread I have made:  great color, texture, taste, crust, smell.  Yum. The first time, I followed the recipe exactly but it overflowed my breadmachine.  What a mess. But it was super easy and had a good taste so I tried it again, this time just did the dough cycle and baked it at 375 for just a little over 20 minutes.  Love it.  I will contiue to try other recipes but this will be the standard by which they are judged.

What a wonderful bread! I used bread flour just out of habit and it's light  moist with a great crumb. Can't wait to try it with cinnamon and raisins. Thanks so much for a truly great recipe.

A nice bread, rose beautifully and cooked evenly. The only thing I will change next time is to add a few more rolled oats.

I wanted to make a whole wheat diabetic friendly bread so I had to play with different ingredients.  I wanted a bread that was sliceable and wouldn't crumble, and also  wasn't like a dense brick. I needed to minimize my use of white flour. After several experiments, I came up with this winning recipe. I hope you like it.

1.25 cups warm water - 
2 tbsp butter - 
1 tsp salt - 
2.5 cups whole wheat flour -
.5 cup white flour - 
.5 cup rolled oats - 
.25 cup ground flax - 
.25 cup crumbled walnuts - 
2 tbsp brown sugar - 
1.5 tsp yeast -

I did not use a bread machine, I used this to teach my 14 year old daughter how to make bread by hand. We just combined yeast, water and sugar and let sit until nice and foamy, added dry ingredients and kneaded ten minutes. Let rise, punched down, shaped and put in a loaf pan, let rise again and baked at 350 about half an hour until it was 200 degrees inside. She has never made bread before and all I did was supervise and give her tips. It turned out perfectly! We love this bread.

This is my go-to bread. Only change I make is to use 2C all  purpose flour with 1C whole wheat, and I add a small handful of sunflower seeds (raw or toasted) when the machine beeps for additions. Everyone loves it.

Delicious! I don't own a bread machine so used my kitchenaid mixer. I will admit I changed this recipe a bit guided by other reviewers and ingredients I had on hand. I used 1 1/2 cup all purpose flour and 1 1/2 cup whole wheat. used 1cup rolled oats and in a bid to make it 'healthier' added 1 tbs each of flaxseed meal, sesame seeds, chia seeds, sunflower seeds and half a cup of raisins. I also used 2 tbs honey instead of sugar and butter instead of margarine and 2 tsps yeast. I think all the additions made the rising time longer but the end result was tasty and moist. I made one loaf 2 days ago, it's almost gone so I am making 2 more now. One as a gift to my mom, who I know will love it as much as I do.

Very nice texture and taste to this bread! I think I will be making it often, though I will most likely add more sugar or honey next time.
I can see why this is a bread machine dough, because you don't have to touch it once it's in the bread machine. 
I chose to make it and bake it.
Working the dough is very frustrating, as it is the wettest, stickiest dough ever! I had to use a bench scraper heavily floured because it stuck to my hands like glue when I tried to knead it. I put the dough back in the mixer and used a kneading hook for about 7 minutes, then finished the kneading on the bench.
Baked up beautifully!

Without eggs or butter or even milk, I was skeptical that this bread would turn out with much flavor.  And boy, was I wrong! This bread is wonderful! It's hearty, moist inside, not too dense, and has a nice crust that won't break your teeth when you bite into it! I added a few more tablespoons of brown sugar, used half white half whole wheat flour, and used olive oil instead of margarine. I also don't have a bread machine, so I followed the instructions of the reviewer who made it without one--and it came out perfect! Thank you for the recipe!

A great recipe but since I don’t have a bread maker I modified it... Oven- convection bake 350F or regular bake 375F- start with the warm water in a mixing bowl (stand mixer) and add yeast, let stand for 10 mins or until dissolved. - add sugar and dissolve - add the rest of the ingredients and mix until dough shapes into a ball. - knead dough for 5 mins- let rise for 1hr until double in size- punch down dough, shape, and place into greased tin. - decorate with oats and let rise 30 mins - spray with olive oil and put in oven - bake for approx 45 min or until golden brown- enjoy!

This is my go-to bread recipe.   I use Jules version without a bread machine.   I double the recipe but include 2 cups of whole wheat flour.    I also use a slightly smaller bread pan so I get 3 loaves that are perfect for the toaster.    We eat one and give two loaves away to neighbors.

Delicious bread although it was quite loose and crumbly when cut into. I made it by hand and baked in the oven following another user's suggestions.   Could probably use a cup or two more flour as the dough was quite sticky when it should have a smoother texture. Will definitely try it again with a few tweaks.  Other than that it was very tasty and didn't last more than a day!

I have a new favorite bread recipe! It's my habit to always make a recipe exactly as written the first time and I did so except I used  butter, not margarine. I love everything about this bread. Flavor,  texture and crust are awesome! I really don't thing I'm going experiment with it at all. I love it as is.

This has become my standard bread-machine recipe. I usually up the oats to 1 full cup. I have added up to 1/2 cup flax seeds in some batches, just for a change.

I would definitely make this bread again. I used a little wheat flour in place of 1 of the cups of all-purpose flour and substituted maple syrup for the brown sugar. Next time I will try the brown sugar.

I made this bread and used the bread machine to mix it and the first rise.  It stayed really nice ever after a couple of days, but it really needs some honey or raw sugar.  I found it very bland.  It is a very easy recipe though.

Loaf was sunken in. I followed instructions as written, except replacing margarine with butter. Really disappointed, should have made the bread recipe I normally make.

Excellent recipe.  No changes required other than to add a little water, but that's a thing that is typical of bread makers.  Next time, it may not be necessary.  I've made this three times now and had to add water every time but, still, that is the nature of a bread machine.  Very good recipe!

yes changed flour to one cup bread flour and two cups AP  and also used a reviewers suggestion of using the individual packets of flavored oatmeal (I used banana honey). The bread was wonderful but had a slight chemical taste from the flavoring in the packet oatmeal. I wont use that again but will stick with plain oatmeal

used my K.A.M. instead of bread machine. baked 350 35min.  oiled and floured pans. Beautiful loaf display without coating the crust with anything !  also i used quick oats ( more pleasing to kids or those who like less oat texture ) . best grilled cheese sandwich ever .! also used helpful tips from reviewer Jules.

Followed the directions almost exactly. Only change was that I used two tablespoons of coconut oil for the margarine. Used the dough setting on bread machine. Shaped dough into a loaf and placed in a loaf pan and let it rise covered for about 30 minutes then baked at 350° for 25 minutes. I covered it loosely with aluminum foil once it became the shade of brown I wanted. Turned out very good! The bread is slightly moist with a mild Oat flavor. Delicious!

I'm trying this bread again since the first time I managed to put in more water then called for not realizing it until I checked to see how it was going   after doctoring it a little I managed to not only have one royal mess in the machine I got a couple of good loaves out of it so because it tasted so good even after the disaster I wanted to try again.  I'll try to post my thoughts after this batch

We really enjoyed this bread.  It's light and soft on the inside, with a great crunchy crust on the outside.  I used old fashioned oats, since it didn't specify.  I followed the recipe with no changes.

Best bread I've ever made! Delicious! Used Instant yeast instead of Active Dry, and added cranberries. Did not use a bread machine either. Baked it at 350 F in a rectangular mold lined with parchment paper for easy cleanup. My new go-to bread recipe. Will try adding other spices next time too. THANK YOU SO MUCH.

I've made this a few times now. Each time I made it with 3TB brown sugar instead of two. This is probably the closest I've come to store bought bread. Excellent recipe.

First time I made this recipe I followed it to the letter, except that I used the dough cycle and shaped the loaf to bake in the oven.  It was fresh and robust with great texture, and didn't have the visible oats that my multigrain-hating daughter dislikes.  Trying it again today, using honey in place of the brown sugar for the change of flavour (and because I'm out of brown sugar).  Delicious, this recipe is a keeper!

Awesome! I followed directions exactly except I used butter instead of margarine! Whole family loves it! My five year old likes to sprinkle cinnamon sugar on it! I am making several loaves to wrap with small containers of cinnamon sugar to give as gifts to my neighbors for the holidays! LOVE it!

It's a good recipe, and if you leave it to bake in your bread machine, you're going to do well. However, for those of you who will bake it in the oven, keep in mind, this is a very MOIST batter, so it would probably benefit you to leave it in to bake LONGER than usual.  I took some tips from other posters who said they put it in at 350F for 35min, but it needed another 10 minutes, and it was STILL moist even then.  With that said, it's a good recipe, and I will make this again.

I made this bread for leftover Thanksgiving turkey sandwiches, and it was delish!!  The kids and I loved it!  We ate the first loaf and I already have the second loaf in the bread machine :) I used 3 T of brown sugar, and added 4 tsp of vital wheat gluten and it was soft and fluffy and perfect!

This bread is moist, fluffy and it fills the house with the smell of fresh bread!
Very soft and light and the addition of oatmeal really adds a great nuttiness and nutritional kick! I didn't have a bread machine so I kneaded it for eight minutes, then let it rest for one hour, then shaped it, let it rest for 45 minutes and then I baked it at 330 degrees for 40 minutes!

Excellent! it could use a little more salt but I am afraid to add more because it might slow the action of the yeast. The bread was dense but light.....I know, it sounds weird but it also was very moist. It stayed that way the next day too....real good keeper. Best bread recipe I ever found. It will be the only one I use for sandwich type bread.....awesome!

I think I did something wrong with this one. It tastes amazing but it didn't rise very much. Everyone else said that theirs rose almost too much so I'm pretty sure I just messed it up at some point. I'll definitely be trying it again.

Used 1 cup whole wheat flour and 2 cups all purpose. Added 2 tbsp of ground flax seed. Used butter instead of margarine. Excellent bread! Loved the texture and flavour (hubby loved it too!!)

Good recipe. Only modifications i made was adding some walnuts for added texture & flavour. Before baking cycle oats were sprinkled on the top for presentation as well.

Dense and moist.  Kept very well in an air tight container; still moist several days later.  Much better flavour than regular white bread.

A very fluffy, soft bread with a crunchy crust.  It baked up nicely in our bread machine on the light setting recommended in the recipe.  Because it is a soft bread, it is very delicious for eating by itself; however, it makes it difficult to use for sandwiches because you have to cut it thick to avoid tearing the slice.

Great recipe.  Simple and easy.  The first time I followed it exactly and it turned out great, and the second time I did one cup each of bread flour, all purpose flour, and whole wheat flour and it was still yummy.  Love this recipe.

I baked the recipe exactly how written except for the following substitutions:
unsalted butter (melted) instead of margarine; and
bread flower instead of all-purpose flour
The bread is fantastic.  I will definitely be making it again soon.

This is a good bread--good density, soft but holds together, easy to slice. I didn't find it to have a strong oat flavor, though that makes it more versatile for sandwiches. I like to try different recipes, but I will probably make this one again.
I added more brown sugar (3T instead of 2) and I always substitute whole wheat for some of the flour (1C WW to 2C AP). I also add wheat gluten (1T per cup of flour) for better texture and a little extra protein.

Crust can be a bit tough, but the loaf slices nicely. The 1st time I made it I used all whole wheat flour and it was too dense. The 2nd time I used 2C A.P. flour and 1C Whole wheat flour and it was perfect. Great sandwich bread and makes awesome toast.

I love this bread. I don't have a bread machine so I do it all by hand with the assistance of my trusty Kitchenaid. The only change I make is I didn't have oats the first time I made it so i use 3 TBSP of a ten grain cereal mix and an extra 1/4 cup of water to make sure the loaf doesn't dry out. This is our new standby.

Made this in the bread maker last night and it was totally FAB! Best loaf i've made in there. Normally i just make the dough and then cook it in the oven as they come out so poor, but not this one. Whole loaf was gone by 5pm everyone just couldn't leave it alone :)

I love this dough for cinnamon rolls!  I use the dough setting on my machine. When done, I roll out on a floured surface to make a rectangle about 12" X 18".  I sprinkle with cinnamon and brown sugar and dot with butter.  I roll and slice with dental floss.  I bake in a pan that has brown sugar sprinkled on the bottom with a few more pats of butter. Delicious!

i make this all the time! I have made many variations of it, but i find that it comes out better made with oil instead of margarine, but that might be because i'm baking at a high altitude, and things turn out different here. This recipe is really easy, i almost have it memorized

Came out great. Contrary to what the bread machine instructions said, i used regular "active dry" yeast and proofed it with the recipes' water and sugar, with warmed water. i then poured it over the dry ingredients. more like a white bread, i'll try more oats next time.

I have to be honest I was not impressed with this bread. The rise was so great that it hit the top of my bread machine and deflated during baking, resulting in a bread that was far too dense and undercooked. The taste was flat, and when I eat oat bread I want to actually taste the flavor and texture of oats. I will not be making this bread again. Maybe I just had a bad bread making day, but it just wasn't to our tastes. Glad that it's worked so well for so many others.

It was OK, but I wasn't impressed. I have tried this recipe twice because I couldn't remember if I had tried it. That's how unmemorable this bread was. It's not worth making again. It doesn't taste disgusting, but there's just nothing WOW about it.

My family loves this bread. It is easy to whip up and is gone usually in one day! I substitute 1 cup of whole wheat flour for the bread flour for a healthier version.

This came out wonderfully.  It was my first time ever using my bread machine too! The bread was not too dense; was soft and had a nice light oat flavour.  The only minor problem was it crumbled a bit as I was slicing. The did make one change - substituted 1 cup of wheat flour for 1 cup of the all purpose. I'll make this again!

The best bread ever! I love the light oat flavor--not too overpowering to eat with lots of different sandwiches. I have made it exactly as is and have made it by substituting part of the white flour with whole wheat and the light oat flavor still comes through. Super job!

I love making this bread! It is so tasty, just smelling it in the house is wonderful. The whole family Loves this bread! The only thing I do different is add honey to the top of the bread right before I put it in the oven. It give the top a nice crispy golden layer and you can taste the carmel sweetness with every bite!  Yum.

Nice, light loaf. I made it with 1 cup rye flour, 1 cup plain baking flour and 1 cup wholemeal flour. Added the extra 1/3 cup someone else suggested. Used basic setting and the loaf was done in less than 3 hours.   Wholesome, but not heavy.

This bread is delicious!  I added 1 tbl of ground flaxseed and 1 tbl of oat bran, and subbed 1/2 cup whole wheat flour.  I found when I used better for bread flour it was WAY better - go figure. Also, I did an experiment with the kneading, as two people differed on their times.  The 5 minute kneading came out much lighter.  My hubby said it was a little crumbly for sandwiches, so I added two tbl of wheat gluten, worked perfectly!  I make it each week now.  A good for you bread that doesn't taste good for you!  AMAZING!!!

Love, love, love this bread.  It is so easy to make in the bread machine.  It cuts beautifully and tastes amazing!  It is wonderful with a bowl of hot soup, or just with butter and honey.

fantastic, I used quick cooking oats as that is what I had on hand, I doubled the recipe and used 2 1/2 tsp instant yeast, instead of margarine I used 3/4 cup ground flax seed, and I used half white and half whole wheat flour, baked it in the oven at 350 for 35 to 40 min., I love this recipe and my family has been devouring it, as soon as it comes out of the oven they are eating it and 1 loaf disappears immediately, best recipe for bread that I have made by far, does not taste yeasty, just so yummy

Delicious bread! I added 1 tbsp of gluten and substituted 1 cup of the flour with whole wheat.  The bread is moist and delicious, and very easy to cut for sandwiches thanks to the gluten.

Excellent!  I sized down to 9 servings for my 1 1/4 size bread machine loaf but other than that followed the directions exactly.  Very light and airy!  Someone mentioned the oatmeal "melts" into the bread - it does.  I love grainy bread and this is not that!  More like airy white bread or sourdough without the tang.  Easy to slice.  May add a bit more salt next time. Other than that...perfect!

I made this last night by hand since I do not have a bread machine. I followed Jules' instructions like the others who did it by hand said and it was perfect! This morning I used the left overs to make a grilled cheese sandwich for breakfast. Mmmm

FINALLY - Sandwich Bread! This is the first bread machine recipe that I'd give up store bought bread for. I've never found one with this perfect combo of taste and weight. This is  perfect for slicing into sandwiches, and tastes so good I ate a few slices plain (and it wasn't even warm still, since I made it overnight!) first thing.  I did double the brown sugar (gravity/box error gone amazingly tasty!), and when it was "stirring" in there, it looked a bit dry, so I added maybe 1TB of olive oil on top so it all stuck together better.  This was a PERFECT size for my 2-lb size Breadman Plus - came to within 1/2 inch of lid!   Thanks for the share, litster5!

Outstanding! This has become our everyday bread. It's so simple to make and everyone enjoys it. My only adjustments are Olive Oil instead of margarine and 1 Tbs. Sugar in the Raw instead of Brown Sugar. Thank you for a fabulous recipe!

Made this in my bread machine and it was very good.  Good texture and not overly crumbly.    I followed the recipe exactly.  Could use something but I'm not sure what - maybe more salt?  I am planning to make it again and will try adding cinnamon sometime to make a breakfast loaf.

I had a bit of a problem with rising. I used clingfilm and a warm damp tea towel to cover the bowl. But couldn't get the clingfilm out without destroying the top of the dough. So I had to rise one more time, and lightly oil the clingfilm. After the third rising, I put it in the oven for half an hour. The top is a bit too dark, i guess that's caused by the butter that was brushed on earlier. The bread tastes good, not dense. I will make this again!

This was very good, especially with jam.  Plus the oats do disappear into the bread.

I adore this bread.  I have made it countless times since finding it last Christmas.  I made it as Christmas gifts and people raved.  I triple the recipe, make it in my mixer, let it rise, shape it, let it rise again, and bake at 350.  It is fantastic.  Great flavor and great texture.

I baked this last night using my bread machine for the first kneading, then transferred it to a loaf pan after it had doubled. I let it rise again until doubled, then baked it at 350F for 35 minutes as another reviewer had suggested. I rubbed butter on the top after taking it out of the oven. My son said this was the best bread I've ever made...and my boyfriend just made french toast with the rest this morning! It was very light and fluffy, with a great texture and flavor. Thank you, we'll be making this again!

Delicious recipe! I used 2 cups white flour and 1 cup wholewheat. I am going to experiment with adding 4 tablespoons of flax-seed meal to boost the fiber.

Light, fluffy, a great loaf of bread. It was gone before noon.   Even with a larger bread machine, keep the measurements as weritten. In my two quart machine, it still worked better with the measurements found in the original recipe. I did not have luck scaling it up to a larger size.

I followed MommyFromSeattle's advice for making this bread from hand. It came out lovely and soft! I'm so happy it's the best homemade bread I have ever made! Only draw back it that it has a slight yeasty/sweet smell and taste which I dislike.  I which re-make, but want to try other recipes first.

This was a fantastic bread. I did this fully in the bread machine and used whole wheat bread flour instead of all purpose flour and it turned out beautifully. One of my husband's favorite every day breads.

I think it's my bread machine but this bread was really dense and crusty.  I subbed one cup of the white flour with wheat.  I added the salt to the liquid and used the "light" "basic dough" settings on the machine.

This is a GREAT recipe.  Like others I also did this by hand using some of the recommendations offered by others.  I was surprised by how easy and consistently good this recipe came out.  Although I did not have rolled oats, I did have some quick cooking steal cut oats and those worked perfectly fine. I also substituted honey in place of the sugar.  The flavor and texture produced was just right.  Bravo!

This bread is wonderful!  I made exactly as is except that I doubled it to make two loaves.  I don't have a bread machine so I used my Bosch mixer.  The whole family loved this.  I will be making it again and again!

I've used Instant yeast instead of active dry - really have no idea what the difference is except perhaps marketing.

Reliable, consistent recipe.  I used 2 cups bread flour and one cup white whole wheat flour.  As stated, the rolled oats were absorbed into the loaf.  Be sure to use light setting on your bread machine.  May use again.

This was my first experience making bread with yeast that turned out amazing!  I couldnt believe I used regular all purpose flour for this!  The oats really do the trick.  Wonderful soft chewy yummy texture on the inside, wonderful tender crust on the outside.  Next time Im going to make it shaped like a baguette and brushed it with egg and see what happens.  That fresh bread smell is addicting!  I cant wait to make it again!  Oh and my husband who was totally hesitant about eating sandwich bread I made has totally turned around after he ate this.  Actually this bread was gone in two days!  He ate like 3/4 of it lol!!! thank you for a wonderful recipe :)

I was looking forward to making this bread since it got such great reviews, however, I feel that it is just okay. It isn't bad, just doesn't seem to have much flavor to me.

I made this bread as instructed and it was gone in one day. Everyone likes it, even my teens. It was quite a big loaf.  I have to make the second one today and will make again for sure.  Thank you for the recipe.

My husband and I loved this light bread. I put the ingredients though dough cycle in my machine,put it in a bread pan for the final rising and baked it at 350 for about 40 minutes. The texture is very nice.

So so good!  I used 2 cups all purpose flour and 1 cup whole wheat like other reveiwers suggested. Just wonderful. Great flavor and texture. Parents like wheat and kids like white. This is a perfect balance.

I calculated for 36 servicing:  It is a good bread, quick to make and I oven baked it. I don't like using our bread machine.  I used less salt than what the recipe required and even then it tasted a bit salty.  I also added 1/2 cup of milk and 1/4 cup of sour cream to make it less dry.  I liked the rolled oats.  Thank you.

This bread is the best. Little ingredients and tastes great. I make it for family members and get many thanks. I like to make roast beef sandwitches with it.

So good! I used 2 cups bread flour and 1 cup whole wheat flour, and I used a 2-1/4 tsp package of yeast to offset the denser flour. I used the dough setting in the bread machine, then formed it and placed it in a greased 9x5 loaf pan. It rose for 30 mins in a warm oven, then took around 40 minutes at 350. It's SO good, and my daughter's loving it! Thanks for sharing, Litster5!

This was my 2nd loaf ever of bread machine bread and it was very sucessful! Tasted great and will be great for sandwiches. Here's my alterations: olive oil instead of margarine, quick oats instead of rolled, added 1/2tsp salt, 1/2 tsp cinnamon just for fun.

I make this all the time, I never change a thing, other then I sometimes will put dough in proper bread pan and bake it in oven. The machine does a wonderful job and the oats just disappear into the dough.

I made this bread with the ingredients recommended and it had a very mild flavor.  Most of the breads I make are spiced or with something in them for a bit of WOW factor.  This bread is less dominate than anything you wish to use it with.  A very good sandwich bread perhaps.  My first taste was just with a bit of real butter.  I guess I just like breads that slap your tongue around a bit and make its presence in your mouth known.

Great bread recipe.  It is just like the 50/50 wholemeal I usually make, but with the added goodness of oatmeal.  I used canola oil instead of butter.  I will be making this again.

I use this recipe often.  The only difference is I knead it in the bread machine and then put it in a bread pan and let rise and bake it in the oven.  I make it often because people keep asking for it.

I love dense bread, so this one is perfect for me. I used a really old bread machine, which hadn't been used in a few years, so I don't know if that contributed to the denseness or not. Regardless, I LOVE it.

I found this bread to be quite tasteless when using for a sandwhich (and that is what I was making it for). However, toasted w/ jam and butter it was nice. Nothing special to me though.

Very good for a quick and simple recipe.  I didn't have margarine on hand so I used olive oil.  The bread is very light and fluffy. Great for sandwiches.

I too changed the recipe, sorry. I'm a sourdough fan, so I made a sourdough version. I just substituted 1 1/4 cups of sourdough sponge for the water and 1 1/4 cups of the flour (leaving 1 3/4 cups of flour to work in).. I also omitted the yeast. Also, since I too don't have a bread machine, I just followed Jules directions. Absolutely delicious! Real nice sourdough taste with a little sweetness. Great bread!

This is my second favorite bread machine recipe. I replaced one cup of all-purpose flour with wheat flour and it was wonderful. I also used olive oil in place of the margarine. It seemed to need more salt when I did this. Will try with margarine next time.

Really easy for a beginner like me. Don't own a bread machine so I made it by hand and it turned out wonderful! Next time I'll probably use a little less salt (personal preference) but it's definitely my favorite recipe for bread so far!

Wow!  This was amazing!  I live in Denver (high altitude) and dont have a bread machine, so I wasnt sure if it would turn out.  I kneaded the dough for 15 min, let it rise for 45 min, punched it, put it in the bread pan and let it rise for another 45 min.  I baked it at 325 (convection oven) for 35 min.  My kids gobbled it up.  I wish I would have made 2 loaves :(

My husband and son loved this bread - afraid I will be making it several times a week now, since the first loaf went in one day!

This is a nice, light bread.  I added 1/2 c of ww flour and baked in the oven like other reviewers.  I was a bit surprised at the height of the loaf, however; rose incredibly high during the baking process.  This is one of those breads that bf loves; light and fluffy.

So few ingredients, and so simple, but a great bread. It tastes great, slices nicely, good consistency. I have made this a few times now, and it is consistently good.

Good bread, but taste is too similar to the white bread I usually make. I wasn't really impressed. So I will probably just stick to my preivous bread recipe(Best Bread Machine Bread) that works great for me.

This is very good bread.  The only difference I did was I replaced the margarine with olive oil.  I let the bread machine do all the prep work then I transferred it to a regular-sized loaf pan.  I let it rise about 45 mins.  There's too much bread for this sized pan.  I'll try to take that into account next time and make a few rolls or something with the extra.

Didn't need all of the flour.  Great texture and doesn't dry out like other breads I've made.  The only complaint was lack of flavor.  I may try adding honey and a little powdered milk next time.

This bread makes the most delicious toast. My bread machine calls for the water to be added first. I used less water then called for and I still needed to add more flour, about 3 Tbsp. I baked it in the oven for about 35 min. at 350..
This is fabulous bread!! You have to try it!!  You'll be hooked. Thanks for sharing.

OMG this can't get any better!  I actually forgot it, it cooked with the arm in the bottom of the pan and cooled in there and was still perfect.  I used maple and brown sugar oatmeal, added a little flour, 1tbs of brown sugar and 2 tbs honey and its excellent.  Not too sweet and perfect.  Thank you so much for this recipe, I will never buy bread again.

This makes extremely good bread. The crust is nice and crisp, but the inside is very light and fluffy. The oats add a very nice subtle taste to the bread.

We bought a bread machine 2 1/2 years ago and haven't bought a loaf of bread in all that time, so I'm always on the look out for tasty bread machine recipes. I discovered this recipe last month and haven't used another one since! I substitute half brown flour, which gives it a richer taste.

When the power went off over the weekend, it was about 1/3 of the way through the cycle. When the power came back on, I reset the machine to the 'Rapid' setting and it finished off beautifully.

I agree with most of the reviewers in the sense that this bread is quite tasty.  For some reason, though, I had a difficult time getting the dough to rise.  I do not consider myself a novice bread baker, but something went awry.  I do not use a bread machine, as I prefer to do prepare the dough by hand.  I will try to make this again and will adjust the proportions in hopes of getting it to rise a bit more.

I made this up last night and it was a HUGE hit!  Hubby and I ate almost the whole loaf for dinner. :)

It was great hot and fresh with butter but makes really good toast too.  I loved the slightly crispy but not very chewy crust.  The oats do just "melt" into the bread and you don't even notice them.  I'll be making this again for sure!

A good white bread, whit oats you cannot detect, and keeps better than usual plain white bread.
Great for sandwiches, too.

Wonderful bread! I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out perfectly. My kids like it better than any other bread that I've made - it makes great sandwiches and this morning it made the best cinnamon toast. I will definitely be making this one again.

Delicious! I used a Cuisinart convection breadmaker (set to white bread, light crust) and did not alter the ingredients except to use rapid-rise yeast instead of active dry yeast. This is a very good, versatile, "basic" bread. The flavor and texture are great--soft and slightly sweet. Try it buttered while it's still hot.

I was looking for an oatmeal bread recipe when I saw JennyAnn's beautiful photo and that made my decision easy! I made the recipe manually instead of in a bread machine; other than that I didn't change a thing. My loaf looks very similar to the photo, and the taste is delicious. The oats give the crust a nice crunch and add a nuttiness to the flavor. This is a really nice recipe!

Very good.  I am always looking for new bread machine recipes, and this pleased everyone.  Mine fell at the last minute for some reason, but the bread was still delicious.  Next time I will make ith with whole wheat flour to up the nutritional value.  Thanks for the recipe!

Easy recipe, great taste. I'm pretty new to bread making, but this was the first time that the loaf puffed up over the top of the pan. Too much yeast? Anyway, that part didn't cook very well. But the rest was great. Thanks!

So good!! I am still new to baking yeast bread, but this was definitely my greatest success yet! I do not have a bread machine, so I followed another reviewers advice and made it with my KitchenAid mixer. I also replaced the sugar with honey. So moist and delicious! I plan to make this again soon! Thanks for sharing!

Awesome!  I finally found a recipe that works!  Light and fluffy and tasty.  I took the advice of a few other people and added two tablespoons of honey and replaced the butter with olive oil.   I will definitely matke this again!

Just personal preference that we didn't care for this.  I was excited to try it after all of the rave reviews.  My husband and kids don't care for it either.  It did smell wonderful while baking and it made a beautiful loaf!  I think I'll stick with the Amish Bread recipe on this site.

very yummy and good for sandwiches.  the first time i made it the crust was too hard, the next time i rubbed shortening into the crust when it first came out of the oven and it was perfect.  i used the dough cycle on the bread machine and baked it at 350 degrees for 37 minutes.

Made this to go with pot roast and it was very good. Everyone loved it. I used the light setting and 2 lb loaf on my bread machine. Thank you!

Fantastic!

I had to come and praise this recipe again! I made it a few days ago and it is just delicious! Made it to have grape chicken salad on but also toasted it for breakfast. The absolute best bread recipe ever!!!

Thank you for posting this recipe.

My family enjoyed this bread. It had a very nice light texture. Next time I make this, I'm going to try making it by hand. Many Thanks.

What more can I add to this delish recipe, esp. when my my daughter &  friends ask for more. I did have trouble with the bread rising but it had to be something I did. Oh it's wonderful!

This bread is awesome!  I've made 5 loaves and only had my BM for about a month.  The inlaws love it!  I swapped out Bread Flour for AP  1/1 ratio, and also swapped unsweetened apple sauce for the margarine 1/1.  Only had one time it didn't rise well but it was still delicious :)  Will make this again and again.

This was very good!  Mine falls apart a bit - almost too light, but the taste was great.  My son said, "Mom, from now on, when you make something with bread in it, I think it should be homemade bread!"  Can't beat that!

ETA:  Making this bread for market now, and honestly, I'm not sure what my problem was the first time around.  Here's a tip to make your bread even prettier - take a small amount of water on your fingers and coat the top of the bread before the second rise (if you're doing dough in the machine and rising it in a bread pan).  Then sprinkle oats on top.  They stick well and give the bread a beautiful homemade look.  Sells well at the market - it's a keeper recipe from me!

Very pleased with the flavour and lovely texture - soft and moist but firm enough to cut easily.
