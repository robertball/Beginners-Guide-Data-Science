I added Trader Joe's Smoked Paprika and that made it Perfect.
I think next time I will cut down the amount of apples.

I loved the flavor of this soup.  The ginger and lime are perfect flavors with sweet potatoes.  I used raw sweet potatoes instead of canned and so added them with the apples.  This turned out a little thin but that was probably because of the change I made.  I also decreased the red pepper and cayenne according to my taste.  I will definitely make this again.

Adding a garnish swirl of cream or coconut milk at the end makes this recipe look and taste fancy.
