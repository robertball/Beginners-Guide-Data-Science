I followed this recipe with the exception of using all fresh veggies but had to add spices to give it the quick I felt it was missing - poultry seasoning, celery salt, marjoram, pepper and sage. Good comfort food recipe that isn't too bad for you.

I had to substitute homemade turkey broth and turkey meat for the chicken broth/chicken meat in this casserole only because that's what I had on hand. I did use equal amounts fresh sliced baby bella mushrooms. I made this casserole in my cast iron skillet. What I did was browned the onion with the mushrooms, red pepper and a little fresh minced garlic in the butter in the skillet, then added the flour and let the mixture turn a light brown before adding the broth, turkey meat and the remaining vegetables. Before sticking the casserole in the oven, I brushed each biscuit with butter. My casserole was done in a little over 20 minutes. The whole family liked it. This is really like a quick Turkey Pot Pie. I'd make this again. Very filling and comforting dish.

Home made goodness taste without the effort!!  The kids even loved it.  It was an easy way to sneak vegetables into a meal.  I used a bag of frozen mixed vegetables instead of just plan peas.  I skipped the peppers because no one in my family really likes them.

No clue what planet I was on when I put in 1/2 cup of flour.  Had to scramble to add more butter, cursing like mad.. but it's weird.  I had boiled up a large batch of chicken thighs for the meat, as I was 'going cheap', and I always make my own broth from that of course, so I had plenty of broth to keep adding to make the consistancy of my Mistake.. work.  The stuff I ended up with was thicker still than I would normally have made it and I just knew it was going to be awful! it turned out awesome!  lol  Just goes to show, when a recipe is simple basic, it can cover lil mistakes like that.  Now the family wants it Just that way all the time.

I adjusted this recipe only to include more chicken, as my kids are fanatics about white meat.  This was the easiest, and
most adaptable recipe I have found in a long time.  Thanks Sara, my kids thought of it like a Chicken Pot Pie, and if I had told
them Ala King, they would not have even tried it!!!!

Very good.  I liked not using soup to make the sauce.  I added a touch of rosemary and thyme.

Easy A La King Biscuit Casserole Haiku: "This was pretty bland. The worst was raw biscuit dough. Whole dish was a dud." The best part of this recipe was that it didn't call for a can of cream of this-or-that, but the end result was still really tame and could've greatly benefited from some herbs and/or seasoning. Also, in 30 min. we had biscuits that were more than golden on the top (veering into overdone territory), but totally raw half-way down, so when serving it, we had to tug and flick away the uncooked biscuits which was very disappointing to the whole family.

Wonderful!  I love Terry's Easy Chicken Pie from this site but when I went on a diet, it became a "No-no".  So, I started making this instead.  I use can of mushrooms and some frozen corn, beans, and carrots in place of the veggies listed here.  I also use reduced fat bisquits.  It's great comfort food and my picky family loves it!  Thanks for a great recipe, Sara!

This recipe was pretty good.  Like a big pot pie.  I added frozen peas & carrots & eliminated the mushrooms & peppers since my kids won't eat them.  Otherwise they really liked it.

Following suggestions from other reviewers, I added some thyme, rosemary, salt, pepper, and cayenne pepper (to kick it up a notch). I also used a store-bought rotisserie chicken. The outcome was yummy!  Really should have doubled all of the ingredients (except biscuits) to have more substance under all those biscuits.  It seemed pretty skimpy - in fact I was digging around under the other biscuits to get enough "stuff" for us to eat.  Next time, I'll double the recipe.

we had to make some adjustments since my husband is gluten-free (had to make our own gluten-free biscuits and make the soup base from scratch), but this was very tasty!  a bit like chicken pot pie.  it required a little more effort than I expected, but I assume that if you could follow the recipe as written it would be much easier.  Thanks!

I chose this recipe from among the others because it didn't call for any condensed soup, which I can't get overseas.  I love the simplicity and versatility of this recipe -- I add any veggies I have, and it's always good.  I also can't get refrigerated biscuits where I live, but it's so easy to whip up a batch of drop biscuits, which also work perfectly with the recipe.  Thanks!

This was GREAT!  Thank YOU!!  I made it for my husband's birthday and EVERYONE loved it!!!  I had it scaled for 15 servings but it only served 10 hungry people.  I did make a few changes, instead of the veggies listed I bought canned mixed veggies and it was great.  I also ended up adding more flour with some water to thicken it up a little more.  I will diffenatly make it again!!!!!

I thought this was pretty good, but both my fiance' and I agreed it was more like "green peas a la king" ... I think it was my fault though as I used canned peas (recipe didn't really specify).  Plus, the bottom of the biscuits didn't cook all the way...was it supposed to be like this?

This was a great recipe.  I did make some mistakes making it, but I think it turned out even better.  I thought I had chicken broth, but I had chichen gravy so used a whole can and then half a can of water.  I used the mini carrots and just chopped small pieces.  I also used the Grands biscuts and the entire dish was gone with just my boyfriend and me.  I will probably double the recipe next time for more "stuff" to go with the biscuits. My boyfriend raved about this dish!  Thanks Sara!

The biscuits did not cook on the bottom.  Next time I would bake them separately and place them on top for the last 5 minutes.  Also the carrots did not cook thoroughly.  I would steam them until almost fully cook.  Also needs salt and pepper for a better flavor.

Just make your favorite chicken pot pie filling and put  biscuits on it. No seasonings. So dull and bland. And it doesn't take a 4-star chef to know putting a refrig. Biscuit onbefore baking it is  not gonna cook the bottom of biscuit. Bake the ui7e

I made this just as it was written except I used leftover cooked chicken, because that was what I had.  The sauce was a nice consistency (maybe because my chicken was precooked?) and it made a vey good chicken pot pie sauce.  Next time I will try Bisquick mix biscuits because I'm not a big fan of the refridgerated bicuits and because I think they would cook in the sauce better than the large puffy biscuits.

Really disappointing.  I thought the sauce was way too watery and I had to cook it much longer so the biscuits would cook on the bottom.  Overall, not a keeper.

I felt it was more a chicken pot pie with all the carrots but regardless it was delicious. I made home made biscuits for the topping. Didn't use peas. used fresh carrots, onion, green bell pepper. I'll make it again this winter when I have more left over fried chicken.

This was good but I did have to add some seasoning salt as it was a bit bland for us.

This was an easy "need to get dinner on the table" meal. Chicken could have used a little seasoning- it was pretty bland.

I only made a few changes, but I made this for dinner tonight, and I thought it was very good. I used boneless chicken thighs, diced carrots, onions and celery (aka mirepoix in the frozen food aisle) in place of the vegetables in the recipe, and omitted the mushrooms. Reading through other reviews, I had no problems with the biscuits not being baked enough. I would make this again.

This was a good base recipe.  Based on other reviews I made a few changes, I increased the bouillon (Better than Bouillon brand) and added a 1/4 tsp of poultry seasoning.  We added pepper to taste at the table.  
Next time we make this I will add 1/2  tsp poultry seasoning and add a pinch of celery seed.  My husband also suggested upping the broth, it needed just a bit more than the recipe made.
Overall, it was a really good recipe.  Tweak it to your taste, you won’t be disappointed.

We loved this! I used the perfect portions boneless breasts, omitted the peppers, used up a half bag of frozen peas & carrots, fresh sliced mushrooms & chopped onions. After browning & cooking the chicken breasts in olive oil in a skillet, I removed them and set aside. Put mushrooms & onions in skillet to brown then added frozen veg. to soften. While this was simmering I melted dbl. the amount for butter &  cut up chicken into small pieces. Returned chicken to veggie/ mush combo, and finished gravy using twice amounts of flour & broth as well. Added rosemary, thyme, celery salt, and white pepper. Biscuits were store brand in the tube. Baked exactly 30 mins at 350' No sogginess! Perfect

I used the  Hawaiian rolls (biscuits) to top this off and they made this amazing, I’m a person that hates chicken pot pie’s but this was good stuff, i used a Turkey breast instead of a chicken I just eyeballed it with the amount of meat, I also used a cast iron Dutch oven that was pretty large so I should’ve doubled it up.   use two cans of mushrooms one can of peas one can of carrots I have better than bouillon chicken broth and then used all the juices from the cans itself and I probably added too much water but this is day two and I’m glad I added the extra water because my biscuits soaked most of it up and heating it up I needed a little bit of the extra juice that was in it

  I also added time and Italian seasoning to this, the turkey breast already had some type of seasoning, my boyfriend got it on clearance shelf, it wasn’t good by itself but this recipie saved it from going to the animals

Everyone really enjoyed this. I used frozen peas and carrots and fresh mushrooms. I sauted the mushrooms and onions in Earth Balance® before adding the flour. I too found it a bit bland, next time I'll use a little cajun and a pinch of red pepper flakes. I didn't add the pepper, it didn't seem to fit the recipe. Thanks for sharing.

Overall it's a great recipe. I'd definitely add some simple seasoning to it though. I used a solid layer of bisquick dough to the top in place of pre-made biscuits and did the whole thing in my 12" iron skillet.

This is a definite keeper!! This was outstanding, I did make a couple of changes tho. My family doesn't like peppers so I substituted celery, I also used all fresh vegies. I sweated my onions in butter and olive oil which really brought out the flavor. I made this for 15 servings so I put it in a greased roasting pan. It came out delicious!!

Very good, but I was a bit confused on the best way to cook the chicken (I boiled it to try and keep the flavor). Also - I felt it needed a bit thicker sauce, so I added 1/2 can of Cream of Mushroom soup. But it really is a tasty and pretty easy creation.

Thought this was good, would have liked more chicken and a thicker sauce so will change those two things next time...great dish, lots of flavor.  Eliminated mushrooms and added celery and extra carrots and peas.

I thought this was a good basic dish.  I eliminated the peppers.  It was a little bland so I added some basil and some pepper to add flavor.  This is one of my husbands favorites.

This recipe was WONDERFUL and easy! I added a little modification to it. When I ate A La King when I was little my mom used to serve it with rice so I added rice to the recipe. I did it with rice on the bottome of the pan then the chicken mixture and biscuits. You could just add rice tot he mixture. Of course cook the rice ahead of time. I was soooo good.

I thickened the stock up a bit. Used frozen peas and whole fresh baby carrots. Used a Chicken seasoning. We used frozen biscuits so we cooked to almost done then added to casserole. Very good. Omitted the mushrooms and onions. Next time will decrease the butter. Used organic chicken. Turned out well.

This recipe was very good!  My husband loved it!  The only changes I would make would be to double the main ingredients and add a few extra biscuits to even out the ratio of biscuits to filling.  Also, maybe not add as many peas as there were way more of those than anything else.  But a great and easy recipe.

Went looking for a recipe to use Grands Biscuits and ran across this one. I ditched the bell pepper and mushrooms and added french cut fresh green beans and celery. Can you say, "comfort food?!" A bit bland, next time some sage and lots of fresh ground pepper.

Pretty good, even better than I expected from this recipe. I left out the peppers, and added some extra peas and carrots and some salt and pepper. Thanks for a good recipe that I will add to my regular 'rotation.'

Very good and easy to make.  My kids wont even try it, but I thought it was very tasty.  I'm always looking for something new and different from the usual.
