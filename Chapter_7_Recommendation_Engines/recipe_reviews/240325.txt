For the effort that it took to make it was good and filling. Love how easy and cheap it was to make the most. We will most definitely make this again. One thing that I changed was not straining the noodles but scooping them out with salad toss spoons which made the sauce a bit more liquidity.

I use brown sugar rather than white, but other than that I love this recipe!

Unfortunately, the ramen noodles soaked up the thick peanut sauce very quickly and became "gummy" and dry.  If I were to make this again, I'd add some additional liquid (water/soy sauce/vinegar), thinning out the peanut sauce a bit.  I used rice vinegar, reduced-sodium soy sauce, and added sliced red bell pepper for a pop of color and some sweetness.  This was just OK, and I'm not sure that I'll even try tweaking it to get the consistency I'm looking for.   Sorry, Nancy Melsheimer Rudolph, as the first reviewer, I wish I'd been able to give this a better review.  Please don't let this discourage others from trying, as we all have different opinions.

I liked the flavors.   It was very quick and easy.  I found that the  sauce was a little to sticky when I tried to blend it.  I did not have  cucumbers so I used celery to give it some crunch.  I will be likely to make it again.  We use a lot of Ramen noodles and I am always looking for variety in recipes.
