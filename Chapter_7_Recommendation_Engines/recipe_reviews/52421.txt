My husband really liked this stuff and there's nothing to it, but it packs a great flavor.  I chopped my ginger into match strips and stuffed it into a jar and covered it with just enough vinegar.  I added some of this to a dipping sauce I made out of soy sauce, sugar, garlic oil and a little water.  I'm sure I'll find many more uses for this.  Thanks for sharing.

A little overpowering, but good flavor.
