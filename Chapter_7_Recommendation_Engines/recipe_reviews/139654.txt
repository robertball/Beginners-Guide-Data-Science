This was a tradition in our home.  We call it Olio d'oliva e aglio. What my mom did was saute' bread crumbs in a pan and toss the pasta and garlic with this.  We also do not separate the garlic from the oil we just toss it all together.  Does make a good quick supper or snack.

I definitely don't use two cups of olive oil, but I do use quite a bit, as well as a good chunk of butter. When I make it for myself, I just use half a bulb of garlic. I also add a medium tomato, and LOTS of pepper! Basically, this is a good recipe to build on. Don't be afraid of the garlic, it doesn't even taste garlicky.

Really good as is and even better, this is a perfect recipe to build on. I've used it and added all kinds of everything that I'm in the mood for then and there. Its really good for instance to add ham or bacon and/or peppers and so forth. Whatever you fancy. Thank you, its a great Chameleon of a recipe.

I figured that I would try this recipe because my husband and I are big garlic lovers.  However, if I make this again, I will only use one bulb of garlic because 2 bulbs just made it way to strong.  My eyes are still watering and my nose is still running from eating this dish.

I did not care for this recipe....followed the recipe to a tee and was so overbearing.  I highly do NOT recommend this dish...even for garlic lovers.

I love this dish.  I usually cut some grape tomatoes in half and saute them with the garlic and oil.  Then I toss the mixture with the garlic and add the cheese.  You can add customize this to your own tastes by adding different veggies and/or meats, so yummy!!

Nice and simple. Believe it or not, no leftovers. I did add a little fresh parsley and used a parmesan-reggiano blend. So comforting.

The garlic did not turn crunchy for me at all.  I followed the directions, and am not sure what happened.  One thought I had was that I used pre-chopped garlic that comes in a jar and that that might have had something to do with it.  So, if you're going to try this recipe, make sure to chop up fresh garlic.

This recipe was pretty good. I served it on the side of some very flavorful chicen breasts and the crunchy garlic added a nice subtle compliment to the meat.

In my parents house we just called this garlic spaghetti. My Mom would fry three or four whole cloves of garlic in about 1/4 cup of extra virgin olive oil until they were dark brown. She kept the cloves whole so that you could pull them out if you didn't want to eat them. Then she would mix the garlic and oil into the cooked pasta. My variation on my Mom's recipe is to fry small strips of pickled Italian sweet red peppers with the garlic, and to very sparingly add oregano to the pasta after adding the fried garlic and the oil. Excellent with as much parmesan as you like.

I've made this a thousand times before I found there was an actual recipe. Its great plain but even better with extra veggies. I prefer to saute peppers and onions in the garlic and oil first before adding the pasta. However you cook it, it will be fantastic.

Yummy! This is a great side dish that I use with my chicken marsala or lemon caper chicken. To kick it up, I sprinkle in some crushed red pepper.

I love this! Love Love Love it! I generally add olives, a handful of crushed walnut and.... anchovies!!!! (you saute the anchovies with their oil in about cup and half of a really good olive oil until they melt completely away into the oil, then add everything else )the Garlic and Parmesan alone is WONDERFUL though --- I think I'm making this tonight! This is another wonderful recipe that you can adjust for you and your family's tastes. and the variations you can make based on what you have on hand... oh heaven! Thanks for posting!!!

MY FAMILY AND I HAVE EATEN THIS ALL OUR LIVES.  THE ONLY 2 THINGS I DO DIFFERENTLY IS I DO NOT USE AS MUCH GARLIC,  MAYBE A HALF OF HEAD. I ALSO PUT A CAN OF ANCHOVIES AND ITS OIL IN THE SAUCE AND SAUTE THEM UNTILL THEY MELT.  POUR OVER COOKED PASTA AND TOP WITH ITALIAN GRATED CHEESE TO YOUR LIKING.

My sister, mom and I just cooked this for the first time. We all tasted and it was delicious but we decided to put a little more in it. At first we just added sweet dried basil, a little oregano, salt, and pepper. It tasted great but it needed a little spice so we added a little bit of cayenne since we thought red pepper flakes would be a little too much.

I tried this recipe and I will agree that it is a good recipe although it was missing something I will make it again but I think that I might add garlic salt to the noodles. The garlic does sweeten while frying.

I'm hesitant to give this recipe three stars, but it was okay with the modifications I made.
First of all, 2 cups of olive oil is just way too much. I halved it and used 1 cup, and even that was too much. I would say 1/2 - 3/4 cup at most for this dish. Unless you like your pasta literally swimming in oil.

I LOVE garlic, but I only used 1 whole bulb. It just felt like overkill to use more than that.
I added 1/2 tsp crushed red pepper and a heavy pinch of parsley for some flavor and color. Also topped this generously with Himalayan pink salt and freshly cracked black pepper.

This dish was a little bland and really underwhelming. Two stars as written, third star since it was quick and easy. I will not make this again.

Great start to a meal. Added garlic salt, pepper and a bit of cayenne pepper. Green onion, shrimp and squash good additions.  Very versatile.

I do this recipe with a twist. I add oregano salt and plenty of fresh ground black pepper. This is my quick pesto dish. It's very good and savory.

SO easy! Can be made with any kind of pasta.  I like to use linguine.  Sometimes, when cooking the linguine, during the last five or so minutes I throw in some broccoli, then drain as usual.  We usually have this on Fridays during lent for a meatless meal that is filling and satisfying.  I love the garlicky-ness and reccommend using only FRESH garlic that you peel and cut up yourself.
