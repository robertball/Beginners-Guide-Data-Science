I was looking for a cornmeal mush recipe when I came across this recipe.  I did some things a little differently but kept it basically the same.  It is a great old fashioned recipe perfect for the coming fall months.  If you have a wood stove, then cook this on top and slowly cook it while your house fills with the delicious smells of sweet cornmeal pudding.

This has a BOLD flavor to it. It doesn't taste anything like your bland, sugary store bought desserts. If you want a treat with great old fashioned taste to it, this is for you! Serve it up warm with some good vanilla ice cream or whipped cream oozing over the top.

Thank you for sharing such a delicious recipe!  I had had this dessert at a restaurant many years ago, and during an outing yesterday to see fall foliage, I thought of it and searched this Website for a recipe. This one seemed to be the best and I apparently chose well, as it was delicous!!!!  I did not change a thing.  A great New England treat!!  Served it with vanilla ice cream.  Yummy!!! :)

Just what I was looking for! I had this in a restaurant in Chatham on Cape Cod, and hoped to repeat the flavor I craved... thanks so much! For anyone else who may try it: I didn't have a double boiler, and so did it in a sauce pot with a thick bottom, over gas heat (easy to control!) My cook time on the stove was closer to 15 minutes as a result, and 1.5 hours in the oven as directed. As everyone else says, serve warm with a really good vanilla ice cream or fresh whipped cream. Awesome with a steaming cup of coffee alongside... I will add raisins next time - just a personal preference. TERRIFIC RECIPE!!

The molasses flavor is too strong for folks who aren't used to it.  Meanwhile, because the corn meal is cooked along with all of the milk rather than having some cold milk stirred in the end, the result is a single, thick layer.  Traditionally, at least in the New England family I grew up in, Indian Pudding should have two layers, a thick layer with cornmeal at the bottom and a lighter, milk-only layer on top.  It also needs raisins, preferably soaked in whiskey or rum.

Having never tried Indian Pudding before, I sought out a recipe so I could indulge my curiosity. This turned out to be a very pleasant surprise. I made it exactly as the recipe called for, & the taste was reminiscent of pumpkin pie. My suggestion for the recipe directions would be to explain a little more thoroughly about the double boiler, because I was not very familiar with it before this. Also, the recipe says to use a 1 1/2 quart baking dish, but when I poured the pudding into the dish, it filled it to the brim, & while in the oven overflowed. Otherwise this was very good, especially with some vanilla ice cream on top!

I LOVE Indian Pudding and so few people know about it. I cook it long and slow in the oven. Serve with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. A classic dessert featured at Boston's Durgin Park restaurant.

I really didn't think I would like this, but I had this cornmeal to use up and gave it a try.  Go ahead try it, it is very good and perfect for the fall.  Excellent with whipping cream or cinnamon flavored ice cream.  I did add about  1/2 to 1 tsp. of ginger to the mix.

This recipe was very good and much easier than the other Indian pudding recipes we have found in the past.  However the molasses flavor is very strong and the children in our family did not enjoy it.  As a suggestion in this case if you decide to make it for your family try going from only Molasses to 1/8 cup molasses and 3/8 cup honey.  Also try adding some rum-soaked raisins.

Oh boy!  This was SO good, and since I am living in the UK at the moment, impossible to find here.  I was uncertain about making my own, but this came out great, and my Scottish husband who had never even heard of it loved it.  Excellent with vanilla ice cream over it.  Thank you for a wonderful taste of home!  Hubby just asked, "Why don't we have it again?"

I altered the recipe to use Bob's Red Mill Gluten-Free Hot N Tasty cereal instead of cornmeal, and made it on the stove-top.  When it was almost done, I tasted it and decided I needed to up the flavorings as it was really lacking.  Perhaps I should have used brown sugar and not white. I also added rum-soaked raisins; definitely needed raisins, rum or not.  Topped it off with a fresh splash of milk.  Add the 4th star with the improvements.

Yummy! I added a bit of ground cloves and a touch of ginger too. I also upped the corn meal to 3/4 cup because I like it more solid. My 12 year old son loved it.

made it exactly as written. Excellent spice flavor. BUT it had a thin milky sorta top over a thicker set bottom. like it was 2 layers. not very attractive.  gloppy to serve.
Later learned this is a style from Maine.  would have given it a 5 if it had set up like a more familiar pudding.  I will make it again but use more cornmeal. Such a comfort type of dish. very yummy

Definitely the indian pudding I grew up knowing, when I lived in Massachusetts. I made it exactly according to the directions. Must serve it warm with vanilla ice cream on top!

Delicious is an understatement. Saw mixed review feedback, but followed original recipe, save for doubling cinnamon (addicted!). Rich, bold flavors. Being of primarily Irish & Italian heritage, I wouldn't be as familiar with discerning it's traditional Indian authenticity. However, it will definitely become a dessert tradition in my book!
