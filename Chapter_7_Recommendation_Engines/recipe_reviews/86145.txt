Ahhhh, the sweet goodness of this simple side dish.  I took the advise and cut the sugar in half and it was one of the best items I've ever made.  It was raved about for hours.  I couldn't have picked a better side dish for breakfast or for dinner.  A must try for any occasion!

I have a recipe very similar to this which I enjoy serving with any meat entree. I never have any leftovers! My recipe calls for 4 scrambled eggs, 1/2 cup sugar, 20 oz. can crushed pineapple using only 1/2 of the juice, 5 pieces of bread; tore into bits; use any bread, my favorite has been oat. Mix all together in buttered baking dish, with a few slices of butter on top of the mixture as well as some sprinkled sugar, cover with foil, bake at 350 for 45 minutes, then remove cover and bake for 10-15 minutes more, depending on how brown you want the topping to be.

This recipe is great with ham. I received many compliments on Easter Sunday for this dish. I enjoyed it as a leftover later, too.  It tasted nice even cold.  It could be considered a dessert

I made this dish and it turned out great. The taste was such a treat with ham. And this goes well with cornbread dressing also instead of cranberry sauce. I loved it and so did my guests.

I made this with a ham and served it as a side dish. I found this way too sweet. It might be okay as a dessert...if you like warm shredded pineapple goo for dessert. Sorry, we did not care for this.

Excellent!  Healthier when I replace sugar with Splenda and use whole wheat flour.

My family loved this! I decided to use only 1/2 cup Splenda, and it tasted wonderful.  Plenty sweet. The cooking time was only about 40 minutes. I will probably omit the cinnamon next time because a pinch really doesn't add to the taste, but it does detract from appearance. ***Oh, My!  This stuff is delicious cold, straight from the refrigerator the next day!

I tried this dish for the first time tonight and it turned out wonderfully. I added a little vanilla to render the taste a little closer to a cake (as I was serving it as a dessert) and it was a smash hit with all who tried it. (I received many compliments and several people asked for the recipe.) I'll definitely make this again! Thanks for posting. :)

My first attempt turned out soupy, but I think that the problem lies in the fact that I used fresh pineapple and measured 20 ounces by weight. By my calculations, that resulted in adding 1.5 times as much that if I had measured by volume.  I think the recipe has potential, so I will try it again.

I posted this recipe nine years ago.  I have cut the sugar in half after reading earlier reviews. That is why I love this site. Sometimes other cooks can help improve an already good recipe.  I also give top a good sprinkling of cinnamon   Still make every holiday I have ham or pork roast    Glad so many enjoy.

What a delicious side dish and incredibly easy to make too! I made a pork tenderloin with it and it was a hit with my husband and two year old son. I sprinkled cinnamon all over the pineapple bake and just mixed it up in the pan. So glad I didn't use just a pinch. It gave it such a wonderful spice flavor. I used saigon cinnamon. It's sweet with a little kick.

I thought this recipe was wonderful, I wanted something with pineapple that was quick and easy. I didn't know I was supposed to drain the juice so the bottom was slightly soggy, but I added vanilla and thought it tasted amazing.

The family loved this recipe...I only used 1/2 cup sugar and it was just sweet enough for us.  I also dusted the top with sugar and cinnamon before baking.  Our new favorite!

If you use crushed pineapple in heavy syrup it will be far better tasting.

Great side to my glazed ham. I cut back a bit on the sugar , used fresh pineapple instead of canned, and it still was very good. My sister's recipe is similar, but calls for bread. I prefer this one, as its less carbs. Not the healthiest recipe, but oh, so good! We used the leftovers on our ham sandwiches the next day.

I did cut the sugar in half like many reviewers suggested, but I don't think that's what made us dislike it. Next time I would just add more flour to this and make a pineapple cake instead.

This is really good if you love pineapple like I do. And although it seems like a lot of sugar when you're mixing it, it's not too sweet. 10/10 would make again!

We love this dish!  We make it often however we change it a bit.  We only use 1/2 cup of sugar and TWO cans pineapple.  Leave amounts of everything else the same & it's delish! Still plenty sweet! Thanks!

Made this for a different side dish with our baked ham dinner today .  I  cut the sugar in half as some reviewers suggested.  Thought I had crushed pineapple, but it was tidbits;   turned out to be a little chunkier.  This was well received by all and just a bit leftover for lunch tomorrow. Next time, I will try with the crushed pineapple as directed.  Thanks, Santa Maria Cook, for a delicious new recipe to try.

I don't always give five stars but this one deserves it.  Easy, kid friendly, at least for my kids. 
Few ingredients is a plus and not a lot of prep work.  
I baked mine in a large pie pan.  It is a bit shallow that way but it worked out fine.  Good for any season and it was a good match for the salty ham we had.  I cut the sugar down to 3/4 cup.  That was the only ingredient change.
