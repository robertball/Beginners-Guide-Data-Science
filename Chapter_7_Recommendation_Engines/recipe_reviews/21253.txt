My mom used to make some tacos similar to this when I was growing up except she used real Mexican Cheese & she sauteed white onion & added it to the potato mixture instead of putting green onions in them.  I love these tacos.  We also put lettuce in them and ate them with Salsa and Parm. Cheese.  Salt & Pepper should be to taste too.

These weren't quite as yummy as I was hoping.  The potatoes needed a little more flavor, were a bit bland.  If I were to make these again, I would add a little garlic, a little butter, lots of salt and pepper, and maybe even some chili powder to the potato mixture.  The ranch dressing was good with them.  I will try these again sometime, with just a few tweaks.  Thanks for the recipe.

I do something like this ,but I dip the tortillas in a red sauce then fry them. I serve it with shredded cabbage and onions and a lemon to squeeze over the top

Potato tacos are an old favorite in my family that I have not thought to make until I heard XrayBarb talking about them. Now I am all excited to make them, which I did. The kids were IN LOVE! This is a simple dish that is Simply Delicious! You can feed a boat load of people w/o breaking the bank YYAA. My kind of meal. Thank You Yvonne I will remember these and keep them in circulation.

This tasted like a perogie--and it was delicious! I used leftover mashed potatoes and simply reheated them in the microwave with some shredded cheddar cheese. I spread it to within an inch of the edge of the tortilla, and I fried it with cooking spray. The results were more than satisfying. This recipe is definitely a keeper.

These are really pretty good. A perfect use for leftover mashed potatoes. My son gobbles them up. Don't make too many at once though because they are not very good reheated.

I didn't really care for this, but my son liked it. After reading the other reviews, I decided to add 2 tsp. of powdered ranch salad dressing to the potatoes for more flavor and used much less oil to fry them in. I've never had potato tacos before, and I didn't really like the combination of the corn tortilla and the potato. Liked the potato mixture with the ranch dressing, though, so might make that again.

Great idea!! I actually turned this idea into Shepherd's Pie tacos. They came out well, but I feel they would have tasted better baked after cooking in the skillet.

Very good. The potato mixture was mild and creamy, an unusual but satisfying texture to bite into. The tacos picked up the flavor of any sauce well, so we tried a variety of dips, including different hot sauces, dressings, and salsas. A great vegetarian alternative to Mexican food.

This was different and easy! I made only two large baking potatoes and got four tacos out of it (with more than two tbsp of filling per taco.. that wouldn't be very much). I added butter to the mashed potato too and used a little less cheddar (I think, not positive since I didn't use the full amount of potatoes). I added onion powder and garlic powder to the potato mix too and it was still a little bland. I didn't have any toothpicks but I had no problem frying the tacos without them, they stayed together fine. I only fried in a small amount of oil though, to make them brown and crispy. Overall these were good but missing something... not sure what. Maybe more cheese not mixed into the potato? I needed a little more flavour. But I'd make them again and play around with the filling!

These were phenomenal! I used about 9 medium red potatoes and also added 1/2 a packet of powdered ranch dip as someone suggested earlier. For a dipping sauce I used peppercorn ranch dressing and for the second and third batch everyone wanted me to add tomatoes and lettuce then top it with the dressing rather than as a dip. It was so yummy, even the next day--I briefly nuked it then placed it in a toaster oven. This is definitely going on my list of things to make again!

My mother in law makes these!  They sounded so blah to me, but they are so good.  We don't use ranch, but instead top them with cabbage, tomato, cheese, cucumber, whatever fresh veggies you have.  Love them!

I LOVED these. Although my husband wasn't as impressed as I was, I have made them several times. The only problem is that they don't reheat very well. Sort of soggy, so only make what you will eat at that meal

Good starter recipe!  If you buy good quality tortillas (look for the ones that come in a big pack, that's usually a giveaway) you won't need anything but a dry skillet to soften them.  Try frying diced onions until soft, then add diced green chilies and cook for a few moments - add to potatoes for flavor.  And, to reduce fat, roll up like flautas and bake until crispy.

These were wonderful--definitely comfort food. Make sure to soften the corn tortillas--if they aren't fresh, they will split. I softened the tortillas in oil and then I didn't need to use the toothpicks. I cut them into thirds and served them as appetizers.

Very unique--everyone loved them! I had one for breakfast the next day with hot sauce...mmmmmm.

Used this as a basic recipe. It was good!

I used leftover mashed potatoes, saute'd onion, and cooked it like a grilled cheese rather than frying. Easy and tasty.

Followed the directions except for all the frying oil. I fried the tacos in very little oil...just enough to get them brown and a little crunchy. These are just okay,  nothing special.

I have made a different version of these many times, and thought I should try this new way, unfortunately I was not happy with the outcome.  I usually smash the potatoes and add chicken broth and chopped cooked bell peppers with a little seasoning salt. On top we add lettuce tomatoes and jack cheese.  This recipe did not compare.

I had tacos like these in Mexico and wanted to recreate them. I topped them like I had them there - sour cream, shredded carrots (sounds weird, but it totally makes the dish!) and hot sauce. My family was skeptical beforehand but loved them right away.

i was looking for a recipe for these because my host mom made them for me in Mexico. but these were way to greasy. i wonder if there is a way to cook them without the grease becuase i would like them better then. also the corn tortillas cracked when you folded them over or rolled them. my boyfriend liked them more though.

These tasted pretty good. The only thing I did not care for was the frying part.  There was to much oil. The combo of ingredients was good though.

I could just feel the grease clogging my veins.  They were pretty good, but I think I could only eat maybe a half of one next time.  My husband loved them with ranch.

These were easy and tasty! However, next time I will add some salt and pepper to the potato mixture. And while part of me would like to lighten these up by using low-fat cheese an alternative cooking method for the tortillas, another part of me is already thinking about how really excellent crumbled up bacon would be when added to the potato mixture. I will definitely be making/experimenting with these again.

My wife and I always order potato tacos when we go to the garment district in downtown L.A . There suposed to be the best in L.A . Well these are better. For a guy who is just learning how to cook, these were so easy to make. Someone else suggested warming the tortillas in the microwave first to soften them. Well its true, the tacos did not fall apart when I was frying them.

These were so good and so easy to make.  I did, however, have trouble with the corn tortillas wanting to tear in half after I folded them, even though they were at room temperature.  I would recommend heating the tortillas first in the microwave or making these quesadilla-style and then cutting them in 1/2.  I used a lot less oil than called for and just flipped them over.  Thanks, Yvonne!

I love these! After reading some other reviews I wanted to share how I make them. I boil the potatoes whole, let them cool, peel and mash them with a very small amount of milk, a pinch of cumin and some garlic salt. I fill the warmed tortillas with the potatoes and then let them sit out, or in the oven for about an hour or two so that the tortilla gets a little hard. This lets them fry up crisper and less potato “falls” out during the cooking process. 
My mother in law mashes her potatoes WITH shredded cheese,,,, another great alternative!

Followed the recipe exactly--too bland. Couldn't even get the kids to eat it, and they're usually a fan of bland foods.

I have had potato burritos before using left over boiled potatoes. Saute the left over potato chunks (may need to make them smaller), add salt/pepper to taste and a can of well drained chopped green chilies. Heaven!!

These were pretty good. I used flour tortillas as we aren't overly keen on corn, and I also added some freshly ground black pepper and a little chicken bouillon powder to the mashed potatoes. I doubt I'll make them again, but they were nice for a change. Thanks, Yvonne!

These were rather bland tasting.  I give them 4 stars because my kids loved them.  My husband said it was better after adding a lot of salt and pepper.

Delicious recipe.  Both vegetarians and non-vegetarians will love this dish.  I topped the tacos with shredded lettuce, diced tomatoes, spicy salsa, and light sour cream.

Great flavor and so easy to make using commercially available taco shells.

These were a great vegetarian alternative to beef tacos.  I am not a big vegetarian fan but love potatoes.  My husband ate about 3 of them while I was cooking them!  I put them in toaster oven the next day to warm up the leftovers and they tasted like I just made them.
