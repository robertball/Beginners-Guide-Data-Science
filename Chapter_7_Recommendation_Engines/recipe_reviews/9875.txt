Consistently soft and absolutely WONDERFUL.  I have made them a few times and have successfully replaced 1/2 the butter with applesauce.  So I use 1/4 butter, 1/4 c. applesauce.  They are still soft and irresistible.  I also made the apple pie spice mix with 1/4 c. cinnamon, 1 Tbsp. allspice, 2 tsp. each nutmeg & ginger, 1/2 tsp. cardamom (optional).

Very good.  I didn't have apple pie spice so I just added a dash each of nutmeg, mace, and allspice and a big splash of cinnamon.  These were a big hit with my 4 year old.  Thank you for a great recipe!  Oh, I used real butter instead of shortening (we don't use trans fats).

This is an average sugar cookie recipe spiced up a little bit.  I refrigerated the dough and rolled it out for cut out cookies and it worked fine.

My kids love these cookies.  I really like how they stayed soft.  I refrigerated the dough and used a car cookie cutter to make shaped cookies. It's great to find a healthier alternative!

These are really good cookies! You wouldn't know that they were made with whole wheat flour. My first pan spread a bit too much, so, with the rest, I shook balls of dough in the cinnamon sugar in a zip lock bag & didn't flatten them at all. I will make them again.

I used demerara sugar instead of white and used cinnamon and nutmeg, more cinnamon than nutmeg though, and the cookies turned out great! I think brown sugars should definitely be used over white; they give a different flavour.

These are really good - plain, but the spice gives them just the right amount of zip.  Received good response both at home and work!

Wow! These were amazing & very easy. I'm always looking for healthier cookies for me & my family. Next time I'm going to try using xylitol instead of sugar. I'll make these often!! Enjoy!!

These were absolutely wonderful. I took the first reviewers advice and added 1/4 applesauce and 1/4 butter instead of the shortening. I think the applesauce made the cookie too flat. It's delicious, for sure, but it's not the soft cookie I wanted. Stick to the butter or shortening. It doesn't make this cookie considerably more healthy just because you cut 1/4 of the butter. You'll love this one!

So I had to make many, many changes to this to make the cookies palatable! Firstly, had to lower the oven temp as the outsides were burning to 350 (though my oven isn't known for its consistancy). Also, added another tblsp of butter (which I used instead of shortening) and a quarter cup MORE milk as it was looking very dry. The dough wasn't at all sweet (I am not trying to make a cracker!) so I added another 1/4c of sugar as well. Not a fan of chocolates, etc, in cookies so I mixed cinnamon and sugar and rolled the cookie balls in it before putting them in oven. Now, almost as good as white flour cookies!

I wish I could give this a 3 and half stars. While it didn't live up to its high rating and it was good. It wasn't super soft and gooey, but it was soft. It was not a sweet cookie, but sweet enough that it was satisfying. I loved that it didn't contain any white flour and that my kids thought it was treat. I skipped the m&m's and just used raw sugar and cinamon to decorate.

wow wow wow! What a surprise! These are very very yummy. My girls ( 5 and 2) love them! I love them and my husband loves them! Can't believe they are whole wheat. I didn't have any apple pie spice so I used a dash of cinnamon, nutmeg and allspice. The dough was a little thick so I added just a bit more milk and it was perfect. I also left out the  mini candies ( don't need them) Next time I will try making with some applesauce in place of the egg and use part splenda. These will be something we will have on a regular basis.  You will not be disappointed.

Made these with butter instead of shortening and I didn't have apple pie spice so i made my own along with help from some fellow reviewers this is what i arrived at: 1/4 tsp. cinnamon, 1/4 tsp. allspice, 1 tsp. of nutmeg & 1 tsp of ginger. Its not as sweet as your average sugar cookie, perhaps because the whole wheat doesn't absorb flavors well. But its healthier than most and everyone that had one enjoyed it. I'll definitely try this with the chocolate next time.

I use this recipe for cutout cookies.  Refrigerate dough for about 1 hr. before rolling out.  I use pumpkin pie spice and make autumn leaf cutout cookies and let the kids decorate them.  I do not put the extra cinnamon and sugar on them as they will have enough sugar with the frosting and sprinkles :)

I've made sugar cookies every Christmas for 5 years now. I wanted to try this recipe because I had whole wheat flour in the house. I followed the recipe exactly, yet the cookies burned in less than 6 minutes. I tried again and the same thing happened. My oven made every other type of cookie perfectly fine. I can only guess that its the whole wheat that's causing this. I'm going back to all purpose flour now.

These are surprisingly good. I got about 36 cookies out of this recipe. Used butter instead of shortening. These are excellent with a chai latte. I think I will definitely make these again.

absolutely amazing. I used cinnamon and nutmeg instead of apple pie spice. I rolled them out and used cookie cutters with my kids and also iced with royal icing. Soooo gooooood. Not too sweet and just a hint of holiday spice. I'll never use another sugar cookie recipe.

This was deffinently a different way for me to make cookies. The whole wheat flour is such a nice change from the usual all-purpose, and it made the cookies taste better! I accidently added the flour in before blending but adding another egg allows the flour to combine just like normal cookie dough. And also try using chocolate chips instead of m&ms, they melt a bit and allow you to spread them like frosting, making them that much better!

I didn't have any apple spice, so I just added some nutmeg and cinnamon, and used a little less than a cup of oil instead of butter.  It came out rather delicious.

My kids thought it lacked something, and I'd have to agree.  Seemed like it could have used a little more zing to the spice or something.

Our family loves this cookie!  I made it with 4 kids ages 3-9 adding the ingredients and mixing and tasting.  I didn't have quite enough butter so I supplemented with coconut oil.  (We don't use shortening.)  I also didn't have apple pie spice on hand, so we did 1/2 tsp cinnamon and 1/4 tsp each of cloves, ginger, and nutmeg.  We refrigerated it about an hour, and then the kids played with it and shaped it into cookies.  It was the perfect texture for cut-outs and we added mini marshmallows, chocolate chips, dried cranberries, and sugar sprinkles for decoration. (We don't do artificial dyes.)  These cookies are soft and yummy, and we will make these again and again.

I just made these for the first time and they came out great! Instead of the Apple pie spice, I used dashes of cinnamon, nutmeg, and ginger-- the dough was so tasty, I didn't need to sprinkle anything on top. Definitely my go-to recipe for something sweet from now on!

These are so yummy =)

There are so many sugar cookie recipes out there that I like but I really wanted to find some with whole wheat. The only difference in mine I didn't sprinkle candy or cinnamon on them, but I'm sure they'd be great that way too. Thanks! =)

Although I love to bake with whole wheat and spelt flours, for Christmas baking I tend to use all purpose flour.  After a long day of baking I ran out of all purpose flour and really wanted to make sugar cookies so I was pleasantly surprised to find this recipe.  Not as sweet as our usual recipe it was still quite good.  We cut them into shapes and decorated them.

ok, these were totally nasty, I don't know what i did wrong-i followed the recipe exactly and the mix came out crumbly and gritty. So I tweaked it and added some chocolate chips and the taste....was less than desireable. Even my husband who will eat anything that resembles a chocolate chip cookie wouldn't taste another. Sorry, I don't think I will make this again.

We really liked this sugar cookie. They stayed nice and soft even after a few days. I shared with some friends and they also liked them. I might try some extra spices next time. I think that would be really nice.
