This is essentially the same cake that my husband's father used to make. He was Italian and made them for family and friends on a regular basis. It was absolutely wonderful and so easy to follow.  The Marsala wine makes the cake. I also saved a few cherries to decorate the top and perimeter of the cake as well.  It turned out beautiful.  I took it to a spaghetti dinner where it was a wonderful hit.  Needless to say, we had none left to bring home.

This was okay, but I didn't care for the ricotta filling.  I think it would taste better with cream cheese or something less grainy.

Very authentic cake.  Ricotta is the traditional cheese to use and adds a special flavour and texture that you do not achieve with cream cheese.  I added some extra Italian Glace fruit - cherries, Clementines and figs in the mix and also for decoration.  Pistachios also added an extra crunch.  You only need a small slice  so this cake easily will feed 12 to 15 people.  Great for a special occasion.

I loved this recipe!  Very authentic.  Everyone loved it at the Christmas party...even people who don't usually eat cake.  I made my own pound cake as well.  What a hit!

Enjoy Italian Style...

Overall a nice  change from regular plain frosted cake!  I forgot to get ricotta, so used cream cheese. Made pound cake from scratch, (old fashioned pound cake) . Had more filling left after filling two layers, so should have put a thicker amount on!  Didn't have currents at my local grocery store, so added golden raisins in with the cherries. Overall very good!  Love the flavor the Marsala wine adds to the frosting and filling!  I may have added extra to both.. ?? cause I liked the added richness of the wine!   I'll be making this again with more 'tweaking' and actual ricotta to compare the flavor difference... I can never resist 'tweaking' recipes to my preferences when cooking, so gave 4 instead of 5.  And hate coming on and seeing the same recipes posted with hundreds of personal tweaks, instead of one recipe with comments on personal changes!  Is easier for me to just read through and decide how I want to adjust a recipe!
