We always called these "Colorado" Bulldogs but it is great.  It tastes like a milkshake like a Long Island Tea tastes like icetea... not really but kinda.  If you aren't so literal you can taste the comparison and I love them!!!

You have to keep stirring just to get everything to blend together.

here in colorado we call this a colorado bulldog, but the amount of cola is wrong-just a shot of cola --essentially this is really a white russian with a splash of cola.

I have to admit, I was drawn to this recipe because it was "faceless" AND it had such varied reviews.  I hate milk.  I won't drink it unless it's mixed w/a LOT of Hershey's syrup and ice.  After I made this (and I followed the recipe to a "T", even measure the milk and Coke Zero), I didn't even want to try it, as it doesn't really look good.  I did try it, and was pleasantly surprised.  It tastes kind of like carbonated chocolate milk, with a subtle cola undertone.  I really kind of dig it.  CHEERS, CHIRP!

Not like a milkshake, rather like a coke float. We call them Colorado Bulldogs. If you use root beer schnapps instead of coffee liquor, it tastes like a root beer float. Don't put too much cola, just a splash at the end.
