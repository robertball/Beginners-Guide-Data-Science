I was a tiny bit skeptical about this recipe because I'm not a terrible fan of refrigerated biscuits unless for biscuits and gravy. However!!! I was so pleasantly surprised! These were perfectly tasty, and I made them for my sister and brother-in-law and their family while visiting. So tasty, so easy to make, and the little kids could have a complete breakfast in one little muffin. I used silver cupcake liners to make them easier to hold and for them to transport on their trip home and have as little snacks in the car.

This is a really cute, kid friendly recipe! I made this for breakfast for my son's sleepover. This made feeding a group of kids really easy and quick! The only thing I did differently, was sprinkle the cheese on top instead of mixing into the egg mixture. We all thought this was a great breakfast- they reheated nicely in the microwave the next day and would taste great with crumbled ground sausage or ham!

This recipe was fun to make, and turned out terrifically. 

One slight modification I made was to brush the biscuit bottoms with vegetable oil, then fit them in muffin pans before filling. They slid right out of the muffin cups.

I'll definitely make this again!

It turned out really good but I should have had it cooked a little longer.

This recipe was good but we could've added more cheese, other than that this recipe is delicious.

Simple.  The wife loves these.  I try to stick to the recipe if I'm rating.  Only changes:  a bit of salt in the egg mixture, and I didn't have Borden cheese and used WM shredded cheddar.  I might spray the muffin tin next time.  Or line the tin with muffin cups.

I followed the recipe as written however I made my own biscuits using Bisquick. I think I will roll them out a little thinner next time but otherwise really tasty. I like them for a easy breakfast on the go. Quick zap in the microwave and you're out the door.

I made this today to test out the recipe before making it for a Thanksgiving breakfast. I added salt and pepper to the egg mixture but changed nothing else. Husband and I gobbled down three apiece. Great recipe.

These were really good! I didnt have bacon, so I actually diced up black forest ham lunch meat and used that instead. I also doubled the cheese because cheese is life and my boyfriend and I add extra cheese to anything that uses it anyway. :)

Overall REALLY good.

Pretty good indeed! Like the flavor and can even see additions such as geeen onion or lightly cooked bell peppers. Will Likely make again. I didn't use muffin liners so if you don't be sure to spray the pan well with cooking spray. I did save a bit of bacon to put on top with the cheese.

Eggs, bacon, and cheese! Three things that worked wonderfully in this recipe, and it was so easy to make. The Borden Cheddar and Monterey Jack cheese added so much flavor and cheesy goodness!  I just wish I could have fit more filling and cheese into each cup. Next time I'm thinking of making in a quiche pan. Will be making again!

I have to be honest, Mr. LTH and I preferred the extra filling made as a scramble to the actual biscuit cup.  That being said, I do appreciate the concept, and would make them,  for a morning tailgate or brunch event where you would like eaters to be able to "grab and go" and eat without need for utensils. 

I made as is, though I did choose to season the egg filling with sea salt and white pepper. 

For us,  I think a lighter, flakier, buttery base, like tuned croissants, would have been more palatable. These are definitely worth trying out for yourself!
