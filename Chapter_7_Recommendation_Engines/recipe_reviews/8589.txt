Very good.  To reduce the saturated fat in the recipe we used skim milk in place of the heavy cream and extra light olive oil instead of butter.  And it was still excellent.

I took some of the submitter's advice - used a little more wild rice, sauted reg. onions instead of green onions AND some minced celery, fresh sliced mushrooms, & shredded carrots.  Finally, at the end, I added a jar of diced pimentos. Ended up w/ a nice big pot of great tasting soup! I had a craving for this sort of thing and this recipe really hit the spot! Thanks Glenda for the recipe and your helpful hints!!

Looking over the recipe I knew it wasn’t going to be substantive enough;  that  I would be adding celery and mushrooms.  I sautéed those ingredients together with sweet white onion rather than the green onion, and added fresh minced garlic for extra flavor.  I love adding pimiento to my Chicken a la King and knew I would love it here too.  Poultry seasoning isn’t something I have at our home in Naples so I had to be creative with what I had -  a little Penzey’s Fox Point Seasoning (for those unfamiliar with our Penzey’s Spices in Wisconsin, Fox Point is a suburb north of Milwaukee),  some Montreal Chicken Seasoning and fresh chopped parsley, rosemary and thyme.  What I knew I wouldn’t like was the flour, knowing it simply would not be necessary and in fact, might even result in a consistency I wouldn’t care for.  I omitted it entirely.  Hubs is not a big fan of wild rice and I must admit I knew I would much prefer it mixed  with regular, long grain rice.  I used a 50/50 mix of both, simmering the wild rice in all broth, no water, for 45 minutes, then adding the white rice and simmering for another 20 minutes.  Even without the flour I needed to add more chicken broth for my liking. This was creamy and satisfying, and gratefully not too rich – NOT adding the flour was a good call.  Still, with all that’s going on with this soup, particularly with my additions, it still fell a little flat. No doubt adding some bacon and a glug of white wine would fix that right up.

This recipe is absolutely delicious and surprisingly easy to make.  It is very rich, which my husband really likes.  I make this all the time and it's gobbled up in a few days! Awesome recipe!!  If you're looking for a way to scale back, use regular milk instead of cream...it still tastes great.

The taste was pretty good, but the look of this soup once it cooled was *very* thick - kind of like mashed potatoes. If I make it again, I'm going to add much less flour/butter mixture so it will hopefully come out more like a soup.

Very good!  It definitely needs more rice.  I used 3/4 c. and would use even more in the future.  I cooked 3 boneless, skinless chicken breasts in the slow cooker all day with the chicken broth.  When I was ready to make the soup, I took the chicken out and shredded it and then strained the chicken broth to use to make the soup.  Tasty!  Thanks!

A bit rich... I would tone down the white sauce mixture, use 4tb oleo & flour & 2 cup milk instead, also didn't use pimentoes and added celery and carrots. No need to saute gr onions. This was delicious.

I used chopped sweet onion instead of green onions, and added 3/4 cup sliced fresh mushrooms instead of the pimintos.  Very good soup, great on a cold wintry day!

This was pretty good.  A little bland, but still a nice winter dish.  I added rice as advized by others and halved the flour and butter.  But, I thought it was still thick and added 2 cups more of broth.  I think next time I won't add the extra rice.
I should add that this had much more flavor the next day and I will be making this again.

Amazing! I know some cooks get a little upset when recipes posted are changed, but I combined ideas from two recipes as i like more veggies. I used 46 oz of chicken stock (costco) in lieu of water and poultry seasoning. I added three chopped celery stalks, 1 chopped carrot and 8oz of chopped fresh mushrooms to the onion sautee. Used half and half and skim in lieu of heavy cream - adjusted flour for desired thickness and used 1 cup of wild rice. It was a wonderful, hearty soup.

A wonderful recipe - even with the changes I made.  I made the mistake of making this recipe using a long grain/wild rice mixture.  Like another said, it turned out really doughy.  So I threw that batch away and made it again using 1 c. of egg noodles.  (A bonus of this recipe - it's really quick when you use noodles!)  I added carrots and shredded the chicken rather than cubed it.  It turned out to be a creamy chicken noodle soup!  I didn't have any poultry seasoning on hand so I just used a medley of spices (thyme, basil, rosemary, etc.)  It turned out great - even my picky eaters liked it!  Next time I'll try the poultry seasoning - I'm sure it will be even better.  Also, I ran out of cream after the first doughy batch and so only used milk for the second try.  It was still delicious, but I think the cream (even half cream/half milk) will make it even more smooth and creamy.  Anyway, thanks for sharing a wonderful recipe!

Made this as written, but I did add 1 grated carrot and a couple palm fulls of frozen peas after I combined the flour mixture with the rice mixture.  It made it a very colorful and tasty soup.

Excellent!  The second time I made it I added 1/2 cup of flour instead of 3/4.  It was not as thick which suited our taste.  Thank you for a great recipe!

This was a wonderful soup, though we made a couple of changes.  I added a little more chicken broth (3 cups), and instead of 2 cups of heavy cream, I used 1 cup heavy cream and 1 cup milk.  This made it slightly less heavy.  I also added a handful of dried mushrooms towards the end of the initial boiling of the rice, broth & water.  I also used cubed chicken breast, which worked well.  Overall, a wonderful soup that is highly recommended!

I think I need to make this again. Whatever you do, don't use white rice. It makes the soup really doughy, so I had to add water, and then it reduced the seasoning taste. I can definitely see how it has potential though.

This is a very solid and good recipe! I used 1% milk intead of heavy cream, since I didn't have heavy cream on hand. The flour called for made this soup a bit thick - in the future, I will use about half the flour. I did also use sweet onion instead of green onions. All in all, this is a very good recipe that I will definitely be making again!

This soup is so nice & thick! Perfect for bread bowls which is exactly what I served it in! I was crunched for time, otherwise I would've made these myself as well, but I picked up a 1/2 dz hard rolls from my local bakery, cut the center out & served it up with chopped green onions on top.

Mmm mmm good!!  I've made this using both egg noodles and wild rice...you can't really tell much of a difference.  My grocery store doesn't carry raw wild rice, so I used the heat and serve, boil in a bad type of soup...which worked great because I just added the rice during the last step with the chicken and pimentos and before I knew it, my dinner was ready.  It was so quick this way!!  I like to add 8 oz canned sliced mushrooms at the end, as well (sauteeing them with the onions, i've found, will cause them to absorb too much of the butter, leaving chunks of flour).  I use light butter and skim milk instead of the heavy cream.  I liked the idea of adding celery as other reviewers suggested, but I didn't have any on hand so I threw in a can of cream of celery soup when I mixed together the broth and onion mix.  Everything else I left the same...and it tasted GREAT!!  With the red pimentos, green onions, and white of the broth, this would make a wonderful christmas soup!!

Simply wonderful. I used homemade chicken stock for this soup with excellent results. The soup was so hearty, so rich and so flavourful. Give it a try! It will not disappoint!

This is really good.  I, too, decreased the amount of flour and used whole milk instead.  Also, used regular onions, carrots, and mushrooms.  Sauteed the onions, carrots, pimentos, minced garlic and seasonings then added flour.

I thought it was really delicious! I cooked brown rice separately and then spooned soup over the rice when done. I also added some sauteed garlic to the mix. Loved the flavor of this soup.

this is a great recipe and the only reason I strayed away from the ingredients list is because I have a child who has gluten and dairy allergies.  because of his allergies I ended up using brown rice flour in place of regular all purpose flour and I use rice milk instead of whole milk.  outside of those modifications I followed the recipe exactly as it is and it was a hit!  everyone enjoyed it from my uber picky husband down to my three children.   the only thing I would suggest and this is just based on my personal taste preference... I bumped up the salt to a full teaspoon and also the poultry seasoning because I like the sage flavors I added a little bit more of the poultry seasoning.  this recipe will be in my arsenal of soup recipes.

wonderful recipe--only changes I made was to skip the pimentos and replaced with sliced fresh mushrooms--increased wild rice to 3/4 cup and used my own homemade chicken broth!  Serve with homemade bread fresh out of the oven!

My husband and I really enjoyed this soup. I did add some v8 juice (which I always put in chicken soups) to the broth.  Also, I used only 1 cup of cream and then 1 cup of 1% milk. It was extremely easy to make with the rotisserie chicken I picked up at the store. Very quick. It actually took me about 45 minutes to get everything prepared and ready to eat. Not too shabby for such a delicious soup.  It's also good leftover.

Good soup, my husband wanted to rate it 5 stars. We were divided at the table between 4 and 5. Since I do the reviews, 4 won.

Great soup.  The sage really adds to the flavor.  I added some extra vegetables to make it a one dish meal but wither than that is was prefect.

Great soup, but more like a stew (which I prefer).  Husband makes this for me on cold days - we usually double or triple the amount of rice and then use skim milk and a bit of all purpose flour instead of cream.  It turns out great - thick, rich, delicious.

Absolutely delicious! I simmered my chicken pieces in broth & water til cooked, then cooled & shredded them.  Added 1 can water, then 1/2 c.wild rice + 1/4 c.pearl barley & simmered 30 min, then added 3 thickly sliced carrots & simmered 15 min more.  Then I added the roux - used 1 large chopped yellow onion in a combo of butter,butter substitute (ICBINB),&EVOO to reduce fat. Used only 1/2 c flour, then 2 c.skim milk. After adding that to soup & stirring to dissolve any clumps, I added chicken, 1 can mushroom drained (instead of pimentos) & 10-oz bag spinach - cook until spinach is wilted.  We had it for dinner along with oven-roasted sweet potatoes and it was awesome.  Made a big pot, which will let us enjoy lunch, dinner and lunch!  My husband rated this 4-star but enjoyed it a lot.

This is a great soup! However, I did add some things after reading previous reviews and my husband said he couldn't imagine it without the additions. I sauted mushrooms with the onions, and, because they produce liquid of their own, I was able to reduce the amount of butter. Also, I added some precooked white rice, which added some really nice body. Be sure that you wisk the flour roux into the cream really well.

Such a satisfying winter soup! I made a few alterations and it was still amazing. I replaced a little under half the cream with water to make it a bit less rich. Play with that, if you want a thinner. less rich soup. Still great! And I didn't have pimentos, so I just cut tiny pieces of red bell pepper in. The soup was on the salty side, so salt could probably be reduced. I loved it though.

Tweaked... Half and Half and two percent milk.  Added celery and celery seed.  Also dried tomatoes for color, instead of pimento.  As with another wild rice recipe... Mushrooms would help.

This was a great soup! Based on other reviewers, I only used about 3 Tablespoons of olive oil to saute 2 stalks chopped celery and regular onion (not green), and only used half of the flour. I used 2 cups pre-cooked wild rice. I added a can of mushrooms, used a combination of basil, thyme, rosemary and garlic powder.  Used 1% milk instead of cream.  I realize this sounds like a totally different soup, but this was an excellent jumping off point and it was tasty and fewer calories than original.

My husband made this recipe and we both agreed that it is terrific.  He used skimmed evaporated milk rather than cream.  I was a little bummed that the recipe had a whole stick of butter and will definitely reduce that amount when I prepare it.  It was a delicious recipe though and it will be on our table again.

I am a lover of wild rice.  This was a good recipe.  2nd time I omitted all flour.  Added canned mushrooms. Sautéed 3 cloves of garlic with canned mushrooms, green onions, and chopped red onions.  At first I thought it was too much butter, but after soup simmered it was just right.  Thank you.

This soup was delicious, but I used duck instead of chicken and vegetable broth instead of chicken broth. We loved the creamy texture and the nutty flavor of the rice. Only thing missing was some crusty french bread. Very easy to make, which never hurts!

Pretty good.  Mine was rather thick, but partly bc I used a pan I thought would be big enough but really wasn't, so I couldn't add the water.  I like thick soups, though, so it didn't bother me although hubs muttered a tad.  He laughed when I told him why it was so thick.  I didn't use a full 3/4 cup of flour; instead, I used about 1/2 cup.  I used regular rice that I had already cooked with vegetables, and I added celery and regular onions (no green onions here) and some canned peas near the end.  I forgot to look for pimentos in the cupboard; I would try next time if I remember.  This is a pretty decent soup and a nice comfort food on a cold winter's day.  Thanks for the recipe.

This soup was very delicious. After reading the suggestions, I tweaked it for myself by seasoning the chicken while it cooked, used 1 cup of heavy cream, 1 and 1/4 cup of rice, and a about 1/2 cup of flour. I think this makes the perfect soup consistency. I also did not have chicken broth so I used chicken boullion cubes and cooked it accordingly!

Super easy and great flavor! I used evaporated milk because I didn't have heavy cream, was still great. I also didn't have any poultry seasoning but I don't think it was missed. Will definitely make again.

Absolutely fantastic! I made the following changes that made it that much better:  I used the meat from a rotisserie chicken from the grocery store (i used all the meat from the bird to make the soup more of a hearty meal) added 4 fresh chopped carrots, some frozen peas and an extra half cup of rice and a little more chicken broth... this soup was sooooooo good!

Wow. Both my husband and I were raving about how good this is. It was pretty easy for something that turned out so good. I'm definitely doing this again.

This recipe was deceptively filling and very tasty. When I started the recipe I didn't think that there was going to be enough rice so I added 3/4 cup of basamati rice which turned out to be a good addition. Although it did not look appealing the next day, it was still quite good.

This soup is really rich. I kept having to add water to it when I reheated it, probably the rice. I probably won't make it again. Maybe try a recipe with less butter and less cream. Just a little too overwhelming.

Our family loves this recipe!  

Instead of mushrooms, I added some corn for color as well as omitted the pimentos.  I usually try to be true to the recipe, but my kids won't eat a lot of things...pimentos being one of them.  Thus, the reason for my change.  I still use the green onions, but do add some yellow minced onions as well.  I also add in some minced garlic, just a pinch.  I think next time I will use some shallots..just to see how it turns out.

My kids LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this soup and so does my husband.  It has become one of the "keepers," as we call them.

I had a terrible time getting this soup to turn out right.  I may be doing something wrong.  But even when it didn't turn out, it still tasted ok, it was just much more of a stew than a soup.

Absolutely delicious. I added a package of pre-cut mushrooms, and really enjoyed the addition. I may try to substitute something less fattening than cream next time, to cut down on the fat. But made as the recipe indicates, this is one amazing soup.

I had a little trouble with this when I added the flour to the onions and butter it became a dough ball.  I added some water and that didn't really help, so I went ahead and added the cream and spices.  I had to wisk it to get the lumps out and was worried that it wouldn't work out.  When I added it to the rice and broth everything turned out awesome.  My wife and I believe this is the best wild rice soup we have ever had!  I highly recommend this.

I mistakenly added this review to another recipe (Creamy chicken and rice soup) that I haven't made yet.  THIS is the soup I made and it was wonderful.  I doubled the recipe and was able to cut down on the thickening ingredients because it didn't need it all.  I didn't use pimentos because I didn't have any and no one missed them.  This was the best tasting soup I have ever had.  My whole family thought so.

This recipe was delicious!  I substituted the green onions with regular onions and sauteed them with shredded carrots and celery,  and I also added a little bit more rice.  The result was amazing!  I will definitely make this again!  (The soup turned out much more creamy and thick than I was expecting, but that made it even better.)

This soup had a great consistency, which I was a little worried about because of all the flour. I only gave 3 stars because so many additions were needed to make it really flavorful. I added mushrooms, onions, celery, and carrots, and I should have tripled the amount of rice. Might make it again with a few more changes.

I followed  this recipe exactly as written and it’s WAY TOO THICK! Like somone else said it was the consistently of mashed potatoes, I had to take some out and add almost 2 cups of water to even slightly water it back down. And it was slightly bland for our taste (which I know is personal preference and I tasted it before I added more water) so I added more of the seasoning salt and a couple more chicken bullion cubes to it.. . After that it was delish! But as written you should cut the rue part, the flour part,  at least in half.

First things first. Ditch the boneless skinless breasts! No wonder why some people gave this rec. bad reviews about not enough flavor, this is why, come on people! I think the soup came out great with my tweaks. You should do the same. 


Made my own chicken stock, boiled deskinned drumsticks in 9 cup h20 with onion, carrots, and bayleaf for 1 hour. Strain out the veggies, pull and shred chicken. Store 4 later use. 

As for the rice I bumped it up to 1 cup, I believe I used 5-6 cups stock. It took about 55 min to cook in a pot with a lid from another sauce pan.(not sealing)

Sautaed half a white onion and also garlic, in addition to the green onions. And only used half the spec amount of flour. 


When I combined everything I ended up adding additional stock to get a viscosity I was happy with . my 2 year old son could not get enough of it, Neither could I.

Really easy and satisfying. The flour mixture started to break down as I stirred it for the recommended 6 minutes over medium heat. It turned out fine but next time I'll cook the flour mixture for 3-4 minutes.

Fantastic!!!! After I added some seasoning. I kept it simple with some garlic, salt, pepper, and in the individual bowl I put a couple of shots of Tabasco(My wife thought it was fine as it was but thought it was awesome with the added seasoning.). My wife is gluten free so I substituted Gluten free flour. Which I had to keep adding cream to the flour because the gluten free flour clumped up instantly. I'm not exactly sure how much cream I used but I kept adding it until the mixture turn into a very thick sauce then put it into the pot. I also had homemade chicken broth I just used what I had on hand and considered the extra as water. I think I used a couple of cups of water to get the exact amount of liquid the recipe called for. I also threw in some mushrooms that were getting ready to go bad and wasting space in the refrigerator. Either way this soup was to die for.

I altered this recipe and just used it as a jumping off point. I think my method is a little more efficient and takes up less time. This is what I did....
I sautéed 3 chicken breast halves, cubed, in 2 TB of butter. I also used 1 leek, cutting off the root, the green ends, halving them, rinsing, and cut them into half moons until chicken is completely done and leek is cooked through. I also added 1 TB poultry seasoning and salt. Transferred to a large pot.
Back to the pan...melted 5 TB butter, then added 3 heaping TB of flour plus 1 regular TB and whisked until thick on medium high heat. Added 32 oz. carton of chicken broth and 3/4 heavy cream until blended. Added 1/2 cup green onion sliced on the bias and heat for a few minutes. Transferred to pot. Let cook for about 10 minutes to bring everything up to temperature and to incorporate flavors with the chicken. I bought pimentos but didn't add them because I couldn't get the lid off. Then I added 1 small jar of sliced mushrooms with juice, and a little over 1/2 cup of long grain/wild rice mix and stirred constantly uncovered.   If you don't stir, the rice will sink to the bottom of the pot, stick and burn. Stir until rice is tender - about 20 minutes. You're done! What I love about this recipe is the mild leek and onion flavor. Without this, it would taste a lot like my chicken and dumpling recipe.
The consistency is perfect - not too thick and not too thin. This will probably thicken even more after being in the fridge overni

It was ok but way too much flour. I'd say half or less would be good. The excess amount of flour kind of ruined the recipe. I think it's funny that in the instructions it says to add the flour until it becomes thick....mine was thick even after adding the cream.

I agree with others that the color was quite unappetizing, using 3/4 c flour turned it a grey color. I will cut back on flour next time.  I added 2 cups carrots (small pieces) which helped a lot.  It was a hit with everyone.  Served it with good bread from bakery, great and easy one dish meal!

I didn't change the recipe except to use homemade stock because I don't use canned or boxed stock/broth. It needed salt but that was prob because my homemade stock is unsalted whereas canned broth is high in salt.

I made this recipe exactly as given with one change - I used 1% milk instead of heavy cream.  Everything else I did exactly as the recipe says, and it came out delicious!  My whole family loved it and gobbled it up.  Some said it needed more salt and pepper, and we are thinking about adding crumbled bacon as a garnish next time I make it.  I think more rice would also be good.  The consistency was absolutely perfect - it was a thin cream soup.  Thank you for a wonderful recipe!

Fantastic!  I followed "Bonnie" suggestions and used sweet onion, added 3 cloves of garlic, sauteed a can of mushroom pieces I had on hand and a handful of leftover SuperBowl multi colored bell peppers.  3 cups of chicken stock and 3 cups of water.  1 cup of long grain and wild rice and about 5 cups of leftover bbq/rub flavored chicken breasts.   Wound up adding a couple more cups of water at the end as well, a bit thick.

Made this for the first time yesterday. My boyfriend and I really enjoyed it. I did follow the suggestion of others and use 1% milk instead of the cream, and added carrots. However, I did think it was lacking slightly in the flavor department so I added extra poultry seasoning and added some garlic powder. Otherwise, it was really good, will definitely make again.

Yum! This was really really good. I took the advice of other's and added a little more rice, I used whole milk and used yellow onion instead of the green. I used white rice and added some dried herbs to the broth and it was sooo good. My husband and I both loved it. Will definately make again.

this was delicious. i had a bunch of leftover shredded crockpot chicken to use up and this was perfect. i used red bell pepper instead of pimentos. i sauteed it with the green onion. next time i will saute the white parts of the onion, mushrooms, and red bell pepper and save the green parts of the scallions for garnish. so good. thanks for an easy recipe.

I agree with the review that said it's just like at Pannera Bread only this was better. I left out the pimentos, added a grated carrot to the broth while that was cooking the rice and, had no green onion so I used a yellow onion that was sauteed until just before it caremelized. I think the green onion would have been slightly better but I'd have to try it again to find out. I'll definitely make this again.
Thanks!

Excellent!  Was so sure it was going to be good, I doubled it with the following slight changes. Used wild and brown rice mixed, ommited the pimentos, cooked the chicken (leg meat) in a little garlic and used no fat half & half slightly warmed.  Will be freezing some so I'll see how that works out. Great flavor with a chowder-like consistancy which can be diluted. with water or milk
