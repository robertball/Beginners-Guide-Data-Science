i got this recipe in my email and tried it and I did not care for it. It tasted like cold cream of celery soup. it was definitely a soupier than what they show in the picture, probably because they say to add an entire can of soup. i expected a recipe from campbell's (which is presumably tested before it's published) to be a lot better than this.

I thought adding  cream of celery soup was an excellent idea!! I had more then 2 cups of chicken and I added apples, grapes (halved) and chopped pecans and adding the soup saved money and is a healthier choice than using all mayo! I did end up using a little more mayo than called for, but I loved the flavor of this!! Very good sandwich!! I served mine on croisants.

This recipe worked out great for me.  I had to make a large quantity and it turned out very well.  The sandwiches got gobbled right up!

This was okay but it was way too wet with that much soup. I added another cup of cooked chicken in order to soak up the excess soup. I mixed in a 1/4 teaspoon of dried dill weed in order to flavor it more. Next time I think that instead of adding dill weed, I'll add some sliced grapes.

I love this recipe.  It is very easy to make.  The first time I made it I doubled it and it turned out great.  It is very saucy but I like it that way.  Tonight I'm tryining it with cream of chicken soup.

This is one the best chicken salads I've ever had.  Try adding grapes and almond slivers for extra flavor.

It's good for a base which you can add more to. I only used 3/4 can of the soup, added another spoonful of mayonnaise, added some pickle relish with some sweet pickle juice, and added some of my favorite seasonings/herbs(pinch of ground red pepper, garlic powder, salt, and thyme). I personally think it's fine without the tomatoes and I can put the mixture on any bread that I toasted.

Good old basic chicken salad, works every time.  I use miracle whip instead of soup and I also added craisins  hard boiled eggs and a bit of mustard.  Good stuff.

This was a great basic recipe for a practical way to reuse a whole cooked/rotisserie chicken. The recipe is perfect as-is, but my modifications were: I only used about half the can of soup; I used onion flakes instead of chopped onion; I added garlic salt, halved red seedless grapes and chopped apples. I didn't add nuts like other reviewers because I found the chopped celery provided enough of a crunch for my tastes.

Loved this.  Had 4 cups of chicken (left over from chix parm and just scraped off the parm crusting).  Doubled soup (26 oz can is all I had), mayo and pepper.  Only 2 stalks celery and 1/2 onion - still had strong onion flavor but good.  Added 20 HUGE grapes that were cubed.  Kids and hubby loved it too.
