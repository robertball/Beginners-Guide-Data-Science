Salty. It lacked depth.  I liked the idea of a dressing for uncooked kale,  but this just wasn't good.  I will not be making this again.

Delicious introduction to eating kale! Very easy to put together after a long day of work. We had it with grilled London Broil, it tasted like we were at a steak house! Thank you for sharing. By the way sorry for the upside down picture, can't seem to edit it..

This made a really nice salad.  Nice change from massaged kale salad with olive oil.  Threw in some cherry tomatoes and red pepper flakes as well.

I love it! Simple and tasty.  I did what another reviewer did and added a pinch of ground ginger and an even tinier pinch of red pepper flakes. My new favorite way to eat kale! Thank you!

I really like the flavours, but I saut√©ed the kale with the sesame oil and soy sauce instead, threw some garlic powder in there too. Just a minute or two to take some of the crunch out. Easier in a pot instead of a pan. Very easy.

This was a great, simple way to get my greens in when I didn't feel like cooking. I grated some fresh ginger into my dressing as well. Thanks for the recipe!

I made this and really liked it, though I added some hot chili flakes. I will make this again.
