I used a mandolin for perfect even thickness, however they were burned on the edges and soggy in the middle. I think it could be my air fryer? Next time I will lower heat and increase time

First recipe I tried in my new air fryer. Burnt almost every single chip!
Used a mandolin to keep slices as uniform as possible.  Through trial & a lot of errors, had to adjust the temp down to 360Â°, and the time to 4 minutes.  The edges STILL burned.  Could only put in a single layer each time = 9 chips per batch.   :(
Took a very long time to cook two sweet potatoes.
I don't think I'll try this one again.  And we were so hopeful.

I loved these! My family thought they were ok. I would recommend using a mandolin to slece the potatoes as thin as possible. I did not use one today and some of the chips were not crispy in the middle but burnt on the ends. I ate the most anyway but the kids would not eat the dark ones. I also used canola oil. I served this with a maple yogurt dipping sauce from AR (equal amount of yogurt and maple,  pinch of salt, mix). Thank you for the recipe will be making this again.

I think I would try cutting them thinner. And I could only cook about 1/3 of the chips at a time. Tasted good though.
