Pretty tasty.  A cakey sort of brownie, but quite good.  I added some chocolate chips to the mix.  Mine sunk to the bottom, so you might want to try putting them on top of the batter instead to avoid that.

I used only 1/4 c of white sugar and 1 cup of losely packed brown sugar. The result was a lighter cake-like brownie that was not too sweet. The sugar carmelized on the tops and edges. The baking time was definately a lot longer. Make sure they are fairly firm, not gooey/bubbly when removing them from the oven. I'm not sure if i'll make these again, but they're pretty good.

Good cake-like bars.  Took a while longer than said on recipe to bake.  I prefer chewy bars with more butterscotch flavor but still very good.

This was a very dense spongy texture, but the flavor was great. A VERY sweet brownie, so it is eaten in moderation. Instead of the vanilla extract, I used Butterscotch, also I used plenty of walnuts ontop b4 baking, not mixed in, and they came out great. Very sticky, hard to get out of the pan. But overall good flavor, everyone loved them.

These brownies came out chewy and flavorless. I'm sad to say I'm not a fan at all.

I followed this recipe step by step and, even after 30 minutes in a preheated 350 degree oven still had hot mush.  A waste of my time and baking ingredients.

Very good. Needed to bake for a total of 40 minutes (10 minutes w/out foil as directed, 30 minutes with). I added chocolate chips after that first 10 minutes.

I didn't have a problem with them baking. I put foil over them after 10 minutes and baked them another 20 minutes. I will say they turned out to be the most beautiful brownies I have ever made. As for the actual brownie, to me they where not sweet enough. I made a vanilla glaze for them and that seemed to help. They are very cake like. Not sure if this makes a difference but I used a glass pan to make mine. I will try to make them again but this time use 1 cup of sugar and and just 3 eggs. I will also use a real frosting on them also. Not bad but it is a recipe you need to personalize. I think butterscotch chips in it would  help with the sweetness.It's good for a right before payday snack.

came out as hot liquidy mush.  Suspecting there is a typo in the recipe - perhaps 1/2 cup of brown sugar rather than 1 1/2?

Absolutely AWFUL!! I made this despite the low ratings and it was a big gooey mess! An hour later the center was still not anywhere near being cooked. Big waste of time and ingredients.

I really love the texture of these brownies they are so good. Yes they did take a while longer to bake than it says. After they are done I like to sprinkle powdered sugar in the top and it's a nice addition.

This recipe yields the best blonde brownies! I increase my ingredients 
by half with the exception of the eggs to make a large pan. I also increase the cooking time covered with foil to 35-40 minutes. When you take them from the oven they appear not done but let them cool on the counter for @ 30min. They are so moist & chewy!

Don't. Make. These. Came out terrible. 
I should have known when I saw FOUR eggs. 
I'm very upset I wasted my ingredients on this recipe. Not trying to be rude; just trying to prevent someone from repeating my mistake. Trust me.

I did cut back on both the white and brown sugars.  I substituted a small bit of whole wheat flour to hopefully bind the ingredients.  I baked my recipe a bit longer.  My brownies were spongy  dry and tasteless. I will not make this recipe again.

these brownies came out looking like cake. If there is a picture with the recipe that is what I am expecting my recipe to look like when its done. The picture is deceiving !! I am very disappointed !!
