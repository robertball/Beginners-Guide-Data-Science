These are unbelievably good.  I fell in love with fried pickles at the AllRecipes Southern Round up in Florida.  I never thought that I would be able to make these better than the ones that I had there but this recipe does it.  I was a little worried when reading the recipe beccause I always dredged my food in the flour first, then in the beer batter.  This recipe calls for just the opposite.  So, I compromised, I dredged in the flour then in the batter and then again in the flour.  I cannot believe how crispy this batter was.  Even after sitting on the table for 30 minutes or so the breading was incredibly crisp.  I am going to try using this recipe on fish and shrimp to see if it will remain crisp.  This is definitely my go to fried pickle recip from now on.  Thank you so much for posting.

Oh yeah, these were FANTASTIC! The batter was wonderfully crisp and delicious! Made as written and feel it's perfect as is. My only criticism is that there was too much batter for the amount of pickles specified. I had more pickles than called for and I still had some batter left. This would be a great batter for lots of different items. Served these w/ 'Quesidilla Jalapeno Spread' from here for dipping...Perfect match! My dad, who doesn't care for pickles (or fried food, lol) stopped by and I convinced him to try one...he ended up eating a few more than one, lol,  and said that they had very good flavor and crunch. I will def. be making these again! Thanks for sharing. :)

Made these at my local bar (easier to use their fryer than do at home). They disappeared like smoke. I use a little less flour (1 bottle beer to 1 cup flour) to make a slightly thinner batter, as I like to use sandwhich slices (stackers) as opposed to quarters.

I love fried pickles but thought I'd never be able to make them...Well I was wrong! These are superb! Once the pickles are coated in the batter, they're a little slippery trying to get coated with flour, but it can be done! These are amazing - I highly recommend them and will DEFINITELY make again!!

These are good Tinita, thank you. But I still prefer my simpler version of this. Equal parts beer and flour and seasonings of choice. Mix and let sit for 10 minutes or so. This creates a tempura like batter. Also, to make it less messy and easier, you can lightly dredge your pickles in cornstarch prior to dipping in batter.

ok, I use allrecipes ALL THE TIME in my kitchen and i often enjoy the results, but have yet to leave a review, but I felt I HAD to throw my 2 cents in on this particular recipe, I followed the recipe to a T and it was FANTASTIC i started out with 1/2 a jar as it said but after tasting one my boyfriend and i just went ahead and made the whole jar, they were wonderful,crispy,tangy and dipped in a little ranch dressing PERFECT, this is absolutely my new guilty pleasure craving, even just writing the review I'm wondering if i have the ingredients in the kitchen to make another batch :)  wonderful job and thank you for sharing.

Needs more flavor.  Makes way too much batter. Batter needs to be thicker.

These are awesome. Makes a lot more batter than needed for half a jar. Used the whole jar and still had batter/flour left over. These were crispy and tasty! Messy to make but worth it! Made with the quesadilla jalapeno dip from this site as suggested by another viewer. Yum!

ended up looking nothing like the picture, batter was way too liquid and did not stick to pickles. Ended up with messy slop and hot batterless pickles.

This batter is very crunchy!  But it does lack flavor, just something missing.  I tried this with generic brand pickles that were very thickly sliced and I know that was my fault, not the recipe.  But I did remove some fried batter from the pickle to tast on its own.  This would be a 5 star recipe if someone could figure out how to punch up the flavor.  I tried adding more pepper and garlic but it didnt seem to make enough difference.  Maybe just frying it in peanut oil would add flavor?

I had never had a fried pickle.  My husband asked me to make "fried dill pickles."  Huh?  Well ....ok... After reading the reviews I made this recipe with equal parts beer and flour. ( I made it with one cup beer and one cup flour.)  The seasonings were kept the same as written except I added a pinch of cayenne pepper.  I did use sandwich slice dills and drained them on a paper towels as to decrease the spattering of oil.  I suggest using the refrigerated (cold packed) dill pickles like Claussen or store brand of that nature.  (Just because they turned out soooo good!)  My husband requested thousand island dressing as the dip .. ( ketchup, mayo and pickle relish) He said to "Save that recipe!" I'm betting this batter would make great onion rings.

This recipe was pretty tasty. However, I did not use any beer but substituted I did add other ingredients and used egg, cajun mix, and flour.

I doubled the amount of seasoning and added cayenne pepper! I put some seasoning in the dry flour as well and it was absolutely delicious! These are the best fried pickles I've had!

Easy and good.   These were easy to make, and were eaten up in about 30mins..   

I used the whole 24oz jar to make them, and this recipe was still plenty of batter and flour.

Great recipe. I drained the pickles and dried them with a paper towel before breading and frying. The pickles were juicy and the coating was crispy!

I used a sweet & spicy dill pickle. I would recommend using canola oil. I also used a fryer. I had some difficulty with the first batch ( stuck together). I would add 1 T of cornstarch to the batter. Great taste!

This recipe and batter was great. Once I got everything ready the fry up was very quick. I also fried fresh sliced jalapenos as well using the same recipe and they were incredibly good as well. Definitely keeping this one saved.

I can't find my cookbook where I saved the recipe for beer batter that I usually use.  Came across this one and liked that it did not require eggs.  I cut it in half & eyeballed spice amounts, but it came out great!  Used it to deep-fry dill pickles slices, as well as stuffed zucchini blossoms & fresh green beans.  YUM!  (Stuffed zucchini blossoms with leftover vegan herbed mashed potatoes.)

Love this recipe, incredibly easy to throw together. I used Guinness Blonde Ale as my beer; I find that using a beer with a stronger flavor helps the batter stand out a lot more. I would recommend for this recipe, having more than a cup and a half of flour on standby for use after dipping the pickle slices in the batter you've made before frying them. That set of flour tends to get a little tacky and makes it harder for the batter to adhere to the pickles.

All in all, awesome recipe. I substituted seasoned salt with garlic salt, (and yes, I still added the garlic powder haha) and after they were done frying I draped a pinch of plain salt over them just for flavor. Love it. Thank you so much for this recipe. Plan on trying a variation of it for fish and chips shortly.

Also, to those of you  nay-sayers who say that it makes too much batter and it becomes runny; the key to any beer batter is to slowly add the beer in while whisking it after you've added all the powdered ingredients together. As soon as the batter loses its lumpy consistency, you're ready to go. Any more than that and it will, of course, be runny.

I followed the recipe and it was very good.,  My family loved it,  The seasoning was also perfect!  I didn't have regular salt so I used seasoned salt and it worked out fine!   I just need a good dip recipe now!

I felt they needed a little more flavor.  I loved the crispness of the pickles but it was kind of bland.   I didn't finish the batch last night because I wasn't impressed.  Today I decided to change it up just a little and they were 5 star.  I took the left over wet batter and added a touch of Kentucky Kernel seasoned flour and dipped them in KK as well instead of just AP flour.  Next time I'll just use the KK instead of AP flour.

We dipped the pickles in flour first, then batter and flour again. Absolutely amazing. We also used dill and regular cheese curds and it was delicious!! Highly recommend this recipe for any deep frying adventures! Cheese curds fried in a about a minute and a half -- definitely try making these!

The recipe was good but like a lot of others are saying, is lacking "something". I think that something is probably salt but not quite sure, but was crunchy and very good still.

Batter a lil too runny and needs a little more flavor but I can fix that. Thanks for the recipe :)

Very good! Instead of seasoned salt I added Creole seasoning. Will definitely make these again.

For years our family would search out fried pickles at street fairs and festivals.  We really liked this recipe.  As it is just my wife and I at home, I cut the recipe in half. That was more than enough to fix half a dozen medium sized pickles, and that was about our limit to eat.
   I used whole pickles cut into 1/2 inch thick slices, as I have found the thin sliced fried pickles can get overcooked and dried out.

A little tricky getting them to separate, but well worth the trouble.
