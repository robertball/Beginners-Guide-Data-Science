I hate to say this, but this is the worst spaghetti sauce recipe I have ever tasted...  It was VERY VERY bland, and WAY too much bell pepper for this size recipe.  Needs more tomato paste, salt, pepper, Italian Seasoning, and more oregano, basil, garlic and less soy sauce.

I am sorry to say that I did not find this recipe all that flavourful.  It had all the right stuff, but still tasted bland and uninteresting.  I think what it needed was a helping of tomato paste to help enhance the flavour.  I am going to give it another try and see what happens.

Just needed more sauce and not plain tomato sauce. I used an organic prepared tomato sauce from a jar (so like prego or ragu). Also added much more than 8oz for husbands liking. By making my own interpretation this recipe was a 5 gold stars to my husband and teenagers.
