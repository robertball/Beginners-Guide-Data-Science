Great, simple recipe - but it needs a lot of extra "kick"... 
I simply substituted my favourite flavour of Doritos (Spicy Nacho), and voila... A dozen different variations available JUST by stopping at the local convenience store! The chicken was probably the juiciest that I ever had - but was STILL lacking something in the flavour department... Perhaps I'll add some of my own spices into the mix next time ;);)

WONDERFUL!  Quick, easy prep.  Add crushed almonds to the tortilla breading for even more great flavor

Make the chicken with cool ranch doritos instead of corn chips and watch the chicken FLY off the plate! :)

Really moist chicken!  I marinated chicken breasts in the buttermilk for about 30 minutes prior to baking.  I added some parmesan cheese and garlic salt to the crushed tortilla chips.  Yum!

This was a very good version of crunchy chicken for those of us on a gluten free diet.  Next time I will only use 1 cup of buttermilk and maybe add a few more seasonings.

Unfortunately, this was very bland.  I soaked the breasts in buttermilk overnight, which made the chicken itself moist and tasty.  But the coating was dry and unappealing.  I chopped up the leftovers and made chicken salad.

It was easy to do. I did add several spices to the tortilla chip mixture - black pepper, cayenne pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, parsley and dill.  The one thing I did not like was how soggy the chicken/coating got on the bottom.

Okay, this is similar to the taco chip wings. It does need an extra something. I added cumin, onion powder, chili powder, and garlic powder.  I also dipped the chicken in an egg rather than buttermilk. I used both thighs and legs. This was just okay.

This was a good base recipe, but it definitely needs spicing up.  I baked as directed, then topped with a handful of cheese and warmed mango salsa (on this site).

This was very bland, and the tortilla chips tasted stale after baking on the chicken. If I were to make it again, I would add some spices, and maybe grind the chips into finer pieces.

Did not come out anything like the picture and was lacking flavor.

I used the Doritos for more flavor as another reviewer suggested and marinated the chicken in the buttermilk for extra tenderness and it was still just okay.  Edible, but nothing special.

It made 8 thighs, next time I would only use one cup of buttermilk and 2 cups of the crushed tortilla chips.  I ended up throwing out a bit of the ingredients.  I loved this recipe though.

I loved this recipe. The chicken turned out very tender and juicy. I also used cool ranch doritos instead of tortilla chips. The chicken was crispy on the ouside and juicy inside.
