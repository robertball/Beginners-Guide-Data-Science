I cut this recipe in half. I made this specifically to use in Hackin Chicken, which is also from this site. I only made two small changes--I sauteed half of an onion in a little butter before adding the additional sauce ingredients and I also added a half teaspoon or so of Liquid Smoke. This was exactly what I needed. Nice basic quick barbeque sauce.

We used this on grilled bone-in chicken breasts, and they were delicious.  This had just the right amount of zing, and the lemon really brightened the flavor.  Next time, I will cut back on the brown sugar, but I'm finding we're liking things less and less sweet these days, so that's a personal taste preference.

I made ribs with a dry rub and wanted a basic BBQ sauce to go on the side. I usually keep a bottle handy but I realized I was  out of BBQ sauce! I had all the ingredients so I made this one with a few  changes. I used coconut palm sugar instead of brown sugar,  I added a little liquid smoke, and I used chile sauce instead of the ketchup. This is a really good, simple BBQ sauce that was very easy to make quickly.

This is the best BBQ sauce ever. Sweet at first with a nice heat to follow. No more bottled sauce in our house!
