My 1st attempt and they turned out awesome.  I will be making these over and over.  I added about 1/4 cup of oats and let the dough refrigerate for about an hour and it was easier to roll into balls.

These are great cookies!! Especially for Whole-Wheat!!! Everyone loves them. The only thing I did different is I added 1/2- 1 cup oats. The dough was way to sticky before!

Made them exactly according to the recipe.  While having guests over, they burned as I ignored the baking phase.  Still had the gall to serve them up to the guests' kids, and, surprise, they loved them!  Burnt and all!  Their mother, who never bakes cookies due to previous experiences with burnt cookies, asked for the recipe!  She made them, and they turned out.  She is so proud.  They baked MUCH faster than expected, even with the convection oven conversion (I have a gas convection range).  Watch them carefully and you will be rewarded.  Taste wise, they're not bad for whole wheat.  On my second try today, the batter was very wet.  I did not even try to form them into balls but made drop cookies.  Took only 7 minutes to start burning.

My son just diagnosed with candida.  I am on the search for cookies that can use whole wheat flour and no sugar.  This worked great.  I used whole grain pastry flour and used 3/4 c agave nectar in place of the honey and brown sugar.  To compensate for these changes I used 1 2/3 c flour.  My son loved them.  I'll be making them again!

I altered this recipe a little to make them healthier and because I was baking for someone with a blood sugar control issue. I cut out the brown sugar and added 1/3 cup flax meal to the batter. They still tasted good. Healthy, but good. For someone who can't have sugar, these did the dessert trick.

These are absolutely wonderful! I used Splenda brown sugar blend to cut down on carbs/calories (but since I dipped them in melted chocolate, I guess I'm at least even calorie-wise). I also added about a half cup of rolled oats to make the dough a bit more manageable.

Am I the only person who couldn't make this recipe work? The dough was so soft, I could not roll it into balls. I finally added a cup or more of rolled oats, hoping to save the batter. They are cooking now. We shall see!

These turnedout great, my kids and husband devoured them right away.  They come out very moist and stay that way instead of turning crunchy, they way some cookies do.

These are delicious cookies! I did add dark chocolate chips and oats, as well as substituting splenda blend brown sugar for regular brown sugar. Next time, I will cut back on the sweetness slightly. Overall, I love these cookies!

I loved these cookies! I'm always looking for ways to introduce my kids to whole wheat and this definately will work. The only thing I added is 1/4 tsp. salt to the dry ingredients to possibly bring more balance to the flavors. Thanks VETTY430 for sharing such a great recipe.

I was disappointed when I mixed all the ingredients and saw nothing but a big gooey sticky mess in the bowl, I carefully reviewed the recipe to make sure I added the right ingredients.  The dough looks awful.  Anyway I used a teaspoon to drop the dough onto the cookie sheet and baked as directed and they turned out wonderful.  You need to drink a lot of milk with these!  I think next time I'll follow a tip from another reviewer and add some flax seed and oatmeal to firm up the dough a little more to make it easier to work with.  I also discovered that you can just stick the dough in the fridge for awhile, before cooking, and it firms up very nicely.

I made a few changes:
I used 3/4 cup agave syrup instead of the honey and brown sugar.  I also added about 1/4 cup more flour because of this.  Added 1/4 ground flax, 1 tsp vanilla, 1/2 to 1 cup quick oats, and 1/4 cup walnuts.  I really liked how they turned out, healthier cookies without the guilt!  They cooked pretty fast, only taking about 7-10 minutes.

"As is" they are little too sweet for my taste but that's alright, I'll just cut down on both the honey and brown sugar next time.  For my second batch I really altered the recipe using milled flax seed, wheat germ, pecans and a drop of banana extract.  BOY were those great additions!  The recipe doesn't "need" anything but it was fun making it healthier.  And they were easier to deal with once chilled a few moments in the fridge.

I'm type 2 so I've been looking for a healthier cookie recipe for when the craving gets too much to ignore ;) This is it! I made these last night and foolishly followed some other reviewers suggestions by cutting the honey in half and adding another 1/4 cup of w/w flour to make the dough more manageable. BIG MISTAKE! they tasted bland and the extra flour ruined them, making them so flaky and brittle that you couldn't even pick them up. Threw them all away after two cookies. Then I tackled this recipe again today and did it exactly as is except I also used Splenda Brown Sugar Blend in place of regular brown sugar, and it came out 1000 times better. I had friends over for dinner and they said they couldn't tell the difference between these and regular peanut butter cookies. So why 4 stars? Because I can tell the difference ;) But truly is an AWESOME, healthy, alternative to the fatty, carb filled, evil twin! Amazing for a whole wheat cookie.

We really liked these pb cookies! I added the suggested 1/2 c oats and 1/4 t salt and watched them bake. I still burnt the first batch but that's my signature move.

Scrumptious!  I used reduced fat Peanut Butter which cut down the calories by 30 and fat by 2 grams.  I'm thinking about trying applesauce instead of butter next time.

A very good whole wheat cookie.  Just be careful- they burn easily.  They turned out better on a stone then a metal pan.  I used my medium scoop because the dough was too sticky to roll into balls and I sprayed a fork with cooking spray to make the criss cross pattern.  Very tasty.  My kids loved them.

Just as the recipe said "quick and easy". The only thing I changed -because I didn't have any honey - was replace it with maple syrup. Yum!

This is an okay recipe. I had to bake them in two shifts, and I burned the first shift because I didn't watch them, and they cook much faster than 13 minutes. More like 10 or 11 in a regular oven. The second shift came out nicely, and the taste is alright. I don't think I'll be making these again with so many other peanut butter cookie recipes to choose from.

I have been making this for years and they always come out great. I make the recipe as-is and sometimes add some dark-chocolate chips. I use the natural style peanut butter, and I do find that the dough is sticky, BUT I use a small cookie scoop and then flatten them slightly with a fork. The cookie scoop is totally worth the investment (you can get wilton ones at craft stores for $3), and save a ton of time. I bake these for about 8 minutes and burning has never been a problem.

These cookies taste great! The dought was very wet and I had to add more flour to it. Like some of the other reviews said, they need to cook for way less time. The first batch burned. The second batch I only baked for ten minutes and they were perfect.

Good, but too much honey.  I used natural unsweetened PB, and a scant half cup of honey, and regular brown sugar.  The honey was pretty overwhelming.

Versitile and easy, with basic ingredients that are usually on-hand.  I subsituted white sugar and cinnamon for the brown sugar. Also, I used the Amazing Herbs brand "immune boost" blackseed honey, because that's the kind of honey I had.  It was the most delicious peanut butter cookie I've ever tasted (Alluhumma barik).  Very useful recipe. If you can get blackseed honey, it's worth a try- you can find it at most mediterranean grocery stores in the bigger cities or you can buy it online.

These are really good! I only had about 1/2 cup of peanut butter and I had to add quite a bit of extra four to really make the dough workable but all in all this is a fast and delicious recipe.

My husband could tell they were whole wheat. The next batch I went 50/50 white and whole wheat and he ate the with no complaint.

These are so yummy!! I used half of the butter suggested and for the the other half I used applesauce. I used all natural peanut butter. These were soft cookies. Oh YEAH! I sifted more than half of the wheat flour.. I got lazy and didn't feel like sifting the rest. These cookies freeze good also!

The dough was very soft which was not really a problem since I just did drop cookies.  The problem was they were very dry.  The taste was like the mixture of  peanut butter/honey that you make for a sandwich.  I don't plan on making them again.

I made this recipe just as written but added some carob chips .  This is just the kind of recipe I wanted, I would reccomend it hands down to anyone looking for a more virtuous sweet snack.  The only reason I didn't do 5 stars is because you really have to baby-sit the cookies during baking, do not leave the room!  They cross over from raw to burnt in about two seconds.  I would reccomend using a cookie sheet with an air pocket and I had to bake them at 300 to get them right.  I would also bake them one small sheet at a time to minimise any losses the first go through.  Seriously, I do a lot of baking so I know what I'm doing but the combination of honey and whole wheat makes for a quick burn.  Also they were a little dry which might be unavoidable, next time I might add some applesauce to try to get it moister like some people did but I think they might burn even faster then.  Hmmm.

Its wholesome and tasty too!! My 5 years old loves them. Dough wasn't very sticky as i was expecting it to be after reading reviews..however I added 1/2 cup oats, some flaxseed, almonds to add extra goodness to it..and let it rest for about 15 minutes. And yes, it cooks fast about 8-9 minutes is enough.This is going to be regular at my home now...

So glad I found this recipe. I absolutely love these cookies. I now make them in large batches so I can always have some in the freezer.  I make them with natural peanut butter and add a little bit of organic vanilla. When I don't have brown sugar on hand I substitute sugar in the raw and they still come out great. It is nice to know you can make something that tastes great without added chemicals or preservatives! My son loves them too.

These are great cookies.  As suggested by some viewers I added 1/4 cup of oatmeal, 1 tsp of flax seed, 1 tsp of vanilla extract and 1/4 tsp salt, cookies were done in 12 minutes and I have no problem roll them into balls.  I will be making this again.

Added 1/2 c. oatmeal and 1/4 tsp. salt with the flour as suggested by other reviewers.  Baked 10-11 minutes.  Super delicious with perfect texture!  Not too greasy, not crumbly at all.  Just a little crispy on the edges, chewy center.

Delicious but the dough is difficult to work with. Next time I will try refrigerating it for a while before rolling into balls and baking. I did try adding some oatmeal as other reviewers suggested since I needed them pretty quickly. This did make the dough easier to work with but I wish the cookies hadn't turned out so dry.

FABULOUS!!!  I used Splenda brown sugar instead of regular.  Took them out about 3 minutes before they were truly done.  Stayed soft and chewy in a tupperware for weeks.  (I tripled the recipe so had TONS)  I also give them to the dogs as treats.  They cant get enough of them either!

This recipe for easy Whole Wheat Peanut Butter cookies is awesome! I used the exact recipe, however, I melted my butter over the stove top (will not do the next time) with the melted butter the batter was more sticky. Using softened butter as called for in the recipe will probably change that ... I did not need to add oats to the recipe, the cookies turned out great, no burining, or sticking to the cookie sheets - I did alter the cook time as 13 minutes was the initial setting used for my first batch, but that first batch of cookies turned out a bit darker around the edges (but not burnt) So by altering the cooking time to 10 minutes made for a perfect bake ... The result was a lightly brown peanut butter cookie ... I also used Smucker's Natural peanut but instead of the regular peanut butter brands with hydrogenated oils .... The natural peanut butter has natural oil separation which made the transfer from jar to measuring cup to mixing bowl really easy.  Great recipe and I am so glad that it used wheat flour and brown sugar .... My boys loved the cookies! I will keep this recipe as a family favorite - healthy after dinner, or lunch snack! Great for children

i followed the recipe exactly other than the bake time (i have a gas oven and it burns everything if i don't watch it so i took them out at 11mins bc the edges were brown).  they were awesome!  but i wouldn't recommend them if you're not a fan of honey bc i can definitely taste the honey in them.  the kids loved them too!  i'll definitely make them again.

I made these and they turned out perfect. I had to reduce the cooking time to 10 minutes cause the first batch I timed them for 13 and they came out over done. They have a good flavor and since I used crunchy peanut butter they have bits of peanut throughout.

These cookies were delicious! I halved the butter but added 1/4 C milled flax. Additionally I was out of eggs so added a 1/4 C of Eggbeaters. Also we added chocolate chips. My very picky eater son was loving the dough and also the cookies. We will make this again and again.

My family didn't love these.  I don't think they are bad for what they are made of.  It is hard to get used to whole wheat taste.

Similar to other reviews I read, my dough was very wet. I was going to add oats like someone suggested, but decided to see how it would bake without. Very soft cookie. Will add 1/4 cup of extra flour and oats next time. Also added flax seed.

Good but came out a little bit dry.  I noticed that even in my electric oven, which is pretty good at keeping temps. even, they still tend to burn.  I liked them, but the family didn't, so I give this one only 4 stars.

Delicious!  Add oats, like the others said.  That thickens the dough.  Also, you can add chocolate chips, which makes them even yummier!  Make sure you let them cool completely, or they fall apart.

These weren't bad, but frankly the honey was a different taste that got old after a while.  If you want healthier cookies give these a try; if you want really great peanut butter cookies, the full fat version may be the only option.

This recipe makes delicious cookies.  I did place the batter in the freezer for about 30 minutes to make it firm enough to work with prior to baking.  The reason I give it 4 stars insead of 5 is that in order to be considered healthy it should have used light butter and brown sugar substitute.

We thought these cookies were wonderful.  I loved knowing that it used only whole wheat flour.  My family never could tell the difference.  Visually, they looked like the same ol' (unhealthy) ones I always made.  I added 1/2 cup of quick oats and used crunchy peanut butter.    My husband requested that we use this recipe exclusively just because of the hint taste of honey.  It made me smile because he didn't realize how healthy they were for him.

These were delicious.  The taste reminded me of a peanut butter and honey sandwich.  I only gave it 4 stars because the dough was sticky, even after refrigerating it overnight.  I used natural peanut butter for the cookies.  Next time I plan to omit the butter entirely.

After reading everyone else's review I tried this recipe.  I did as the recipe stated, but added 1/2 more of the whole wheat flour and the consistency was great. I also added the salt as mentioned. I find this to be a  recipe I can change a little more by using Splenda brown sugar to make a cookie recipe for a diabetic.

I was looking for another fun cookie to squeeze through my cookie press, and this was perfect. The ingredients worked perfectly as stated (although i made sure to use creamy peanut butter for the press) and went really nicely with the red-hot i pushed into the center of each cookie. Definitely a new favorite!

Wonderful recipe and so easy to make.  If you don't want too sweet of a cookie, then don't add the honey.  It'll cut the calories too.

I really recommend getting a small cookie scoop for this recipe.  You can get them at Linens N Things or Bed Bath and Beyond (OXO makes them) or Pampered Chef.  I felt there was too much honey in this recipe.  Next time, I'm going to reduce the honey to 1/4 cup and maybe only put 1/8 cup of white sugar in it's place.  Also, I agree that a little salt needs to be added.

I added oatmeal, flax, and wheat bran to this recipe since it was so gooey to begin with.  It really turned out well.  Very easy to make, my kids and nieghborkids ate them up and asked for more.  The honey taste if very strong but very good.  Like a peanut butter honey sandwich.  I will probably add some dried cranberies or raisons to my next batch.

I did 13 minutes for the first batch and they came out crumbly and dry. Taking them out a few minutes early makes all the difference if you are a fan of soft, chewy cookies. I also added a teaspoon of vanilla and a pinch of sea salt. Adds an extra layer of flavor!

Yum!  These were delicious.  I thought I'd try olive oil instead of honey and didn't add any additional sugar other than what was in the peanut butter.  I'll definitely be making them again.  They crumbled a bit after baking but after I chilled them they were great.

They were really good and easy to make, but I burnt the first batch because I put them in for around 13-14ish minutes like it said, and it was too much. I recommend putting them in for only 9 or 10 minutes.

I convert this recipe to low -carb by replacing the brown sugar with 1/2 cup 0 carb Truvia ( available at Walmart).  You can also use maple syrup instead of honey.   Delicious cookies!

These tasted a little like wheat , which is not particularly delicious with peanut butter. But they were okay. Will probably not make again.

I have been searching for a very long time for a simple peanut butter cookie and sadly this recipe still is not the "one". I followed the recipe exact, however needed to substitute the butter with butter flavored shortening due to dairy allergies (never had any issue with this on any other recipe). The texture of the dough came out perfect. I did refrigerate as I do with all cookie recipes before rolling into a ball and baking.

I think what threw this recipe off for me was the honey. I've cooked with honey in the past and found the cookies burn very easily. In this case I only cooked for 11 minutes, not the suggested 13 and still found my cookies too dark and/or almost burnt on the bottom. 

Overall I will try this recipe again as I loved the dough texture. I will switch out the honey next time with white sugar which will hopefully combat the burning and off taste

Using wheat flour takes some getting use to as far as taste. I added an additional 1/4 cup of the flour, because it seemed rather runny still. That maybe because I used natural peanut butter; I'm not certain. Overall though I think they turned out pretty good. Mine also had a slightly well done bottom. I'm not sure reducing the cook time would make it any better, because then the top would still be kinda gooey. I'm sure I'll make these again.

I did 2 cups wholemeal flour and a cup of oats...

maybe it depends on the peanut butter you have as to how wet the mixture ends up?

I also replaced the butter with coconut oil and added some apple cider vinegar to make it a healthier option,

very tasty!!! would make again.

needs more sugar! next time will double the sugar and will use molasses instead of honey.  it was so easy that my 10 year old son made these with very little supervision from me.  we used white flour cuz no WW flour on hand, and added a few splashes of milk before forming into cookies cuz dough was too stiff.  rolling into balls not really necessary.  these cookies do not spread much, so they kept a round shape anyway.  they came out very pretty and flavorful.

The taste of whole wheat is very strong.  It's all I could taste.  I used 2 eggs and 1/4teas of salt.   I used 1 cup of brown sugar because I didn't have honey.     The batter was soft but I used a cookies scoop, dipped in water first, and had no problems.

This recipe needs more flour. The butter and eggs and the added grease on the pan not only makes the cookies too soft to roll into balls it burns the bottom of the cookies I would add a tad more flour and possibly refrigerating the dough may be the only way to make the dough moldable.e. Also 13-15 minutes is entirely too long for such soft dough.

5 stars with following change.  Add 1/2 cup whole wheat flour for total of 1-3/4 cup.  Delicious. When I saw how gooey the dough was, I read the comments of others and adjusted the recipe.  Turned out perfect.

I had whole wheat flour, honey and peanut butter so thought I would try this.  I was expecting them to be more like a regular peanut butter cookie with stiff dough.  The dough was a little runny.  As others noted they did not know how they were going to get these to roll into balls  I to added about one cup of oats and then chilled in refrigerator.  I rolled the sticky little critters into balls and baked.  They are now my favorite cookie.  They baked up nicely and the flavor is delicious.  I also feel I am having a healthy cookie.  Thank you for this recipe.

Was hesitant at first but made it and came out great!! Added 1/4 cup oats because of recommendation but don't think its necessary. DO freeze for at least 10 minutes before forming balls. Very dry but extremely tasty!! Thank you

This recipe was actually good.  MY husband is very picky and likes his cookies very soft and chewy - and he approved of these :).  I added some chocolate chips and I did mainly whole wheat with some white flour because I wanted them to turn out good and was nervous with using whole wheat only.  Next time I think I will bake them less than the 13-15 minutes so they are extra soft...

I also found the dough way too wet and soft, perhaps its due to brand differences in margerine or pb. Anyhow, I had to increase the flour to 2 cups.

Despite the great ingredients and that the soft dough was not hard to handle - these were tasteless!  I added a pinch of salt as my mom's recipe calls for salt, but that wasn't enough.  They could have really benefited for 1/8 or more tsp of salt.  Froze the rest of the dough and have to figure out a way to spruce it up before baking again.

My great grandmother used to make these with a hershey kiss in the middle. I used this recipe because it's whole wheat but I cut the honey and brown sugar (I used sucanat) down to 1/4 c. each and the cookies were sumptuous. We don't like our cookies so sweet so these hit the spot.

I used Organic butter and Organic brown sugar in these, but cut back a bit on the brown sugar & honey because I don't like them overly sweet.  Plus I used natural chunky peanut butter.  My family absolutely loved them.

These were so dry my 5 year old would not eat them and we are a family that eats whole wheat.  Perhaps it was the organic peanut butter rather than the hydrogenated variety.

This is a good simple "healthy" cookie.  My 2 year old thought it was good.  I might try adding flax, oats, or substituting applesauce for some of the butter with the next batch.  Thanks for the recipee.

Not bad cookies.  You can tell they use whole wheat flour, but as someone who grew up with ww breads and other things, it doesn't bother me at all.  I guess it's the honey, but it's a different pb cookie taste than I'm used to.  These don't make a lot of cookies, so it was easy enough to try them.  I didn't bother rolling into balls; just used my small cookie scoop and plopped them on the pan.  the batter is a bit soft, so this may be the best way.  I still made fork marks on the cookies.  I bake a lot of baked goods for a friend's dad who needs to gain weight (neither bf nor I have that problem, unfortuneately) and I think he'll enjoy these.  Thanks for the recipe!

So tasty that my family didn't know they had whole wheat flour in them! And they'll NEVER know ;o) You see, once they know these things then suddenly they don't like the food any longer. So it has to remain my secret.  This recipe made it into my very own, personal, tried and true recipe binder in my kitchen. You know, those recipes that you turn to when you MUST please people?!

These are delicious little cookies!  And soooo fast and easy to make!  I substituted apples sauce for the butter and I didn't have any honey so I used 1/2 cup sucanut, (all natural sugar).  I also added a teaspoon of vanilla and they turned out beautifully!  I'll probably triple it next time as they won't last long!  :-)

Meh. These cookies tasted fine, but were a little dry. When I made the batch following the recipe the dough was too soupy, and certainly not moldable. So I had to add about a cup more of flour.

Delicious! I went by other reviews and added 1/2 c of (instant...all I had)oats and chocolate chips...WOW! Not too sweet, as I thought when I was making them...Boyfriend is scoffing them down as we speak.

This recipe was fantastic!!! I made them to take to a party and they were a big hit. I made a couple changes. I added half a bag of m&m's for fun and 1 cup of oats so that the cookies would be easier to roll into balls right away. Will definitely be making these over and over again.

I made it with agave instead of brown sugar and honey and it tasted a bit off, I use agave a lot so I'm not sure what it was.... but my 2 1/2 year old loved them, maybe it's because this is her first peanut butter cookie

This recipe was great and easy. I followed recommendations from others and added old fashioned oats, put the mix in the fridge for an hour to firm up, and used a teaspoon to measure the mini cookies. Couldn't even tell it was whole wheat flower or honey instead of sugar. Great recipe!

I would not make these again. Very wet dough. We still ate a lot of them. If you are looking for a better alternative to traditional peanut butter cookies go with this. But my suggestion is take in a few more calories and go all out. It is very hard to make a cookie taste good and be nutritious at the same time.

These didn't turn out for me. The recipe didn't specify natural peanut butter w/o sugar, and that's what I used, so maybe that was the difference. I even added chocolate chips to the batter after the first ones didn't have a great taste. It was definitely too much honey for us, although we use honey all the time. Soft, but sort of tough consistency. Error might have been on my part, though!

These cookies taste a lot like honey, so if you wouldn't like that overpowering taste, don't make them.  I think you could just substitute whole wheat flour in a regular peanut butter cookie recipe and wind up with a better product.

These were pretty good peanut butter cookies. They were slightly dense and very peanut buttery, but that's how I like them. The dough was a little dry and they didn't spread at all when I baked them, so I had to really press the second batch down with the fork. The only changes I made were I omitted the honey and my peanut butter was reduced fat. Maybe that's why they didn't spread?

I loved these cookies! I had to add 1/4 cup more WW Flour, but they turned out great. Even my kids loved them, and they are picky!
