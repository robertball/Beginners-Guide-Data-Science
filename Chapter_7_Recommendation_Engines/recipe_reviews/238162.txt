We really enjoyed this both warm and cold. I added the onion to the potatoes in the oven during the last 15 minutes of roasting to soften it up. Make sure to roast your sweet potatoes until they get some color from caramelization.

I added a red onion that I baked with the sweet potatoes and I brought the dish to a potato-themed pitch-in. It was a big hit. I've been receiving requests for the recipe all week.

Really enjoyed this. I added half a bag of frozen corn and some sliced, perfectly ripe avocado on top. Yummy.

Didn’t tell the family it had that Vegan label, and made it.  It was relatively easy to make, and everyone loved it!  I put the red onion in with the sweet potatoes about half way through cooking and softened them a bit, good idea.  Otherwise the recipe is great just as it is.  In fact, everyone asked if we could make it again so they could take it to lunch!  Don’t be scared by the title, this really is delicious.  Singed -from a Meat-eating person!

We love this salad! I have made it several times and it always turns out well. I don't really measure the veg, just stir it in till it looks pretty and the balance is what I like. I have added roasted corn, feta, slice avocado, or spinach...depending on what I have or what we are having with it. It is a very flexible meal and can be customized to whatever tastes! Thank you for sharing!!!

I used sweet potatoes as the recipe called for. My potatoes were almost white not the orange in the picture. Yams? I also put the cubed potatoes in a bowl and tossed them with the oil and spices . it seemed to coat the potatoes better and distribute the flavors. I used chipotle spiced chili powder instead of red pepper flakes
Also it tasted better a few hours after completing or even the next day.

Potatoes turned out great with roasting instructions. I felt  the finished dish lacked a bit of flavor so I added extra cumin along with the olive oil (even after adding it to the potatoes before roasting). Additionally I felt if needed more lime juice so I used 6-7 TBSP’s. Make sure to add enough salt and pepper for a bit more balance. The onion should be kept to a minimum or it will overpower the soft flavor of the potatoes and black beans. A great option for a vegan or vegetarian crowd.

Very easy, healthy and tasty!  I baked the red onion with the sweet potatoes since I do not like raw onion.

This surprised me. I mean I obviously anticipated it would be good, but WOW! And so easy to make. I used 3 normal sized sweet potatoes and sort of tossed in about the right amounts of seasonings and it was awesome. You won’t be disappointed.

This recipe is pretty basic but it is good. It (salt/pepper/cumin/cilantro/lime) can be adjusted based on the individuals taste.

Amazing base for so many possibilities!  I added quinoa for extra protein and fullness, fresh tomatoes for moisture to break up the beans, AND green pepper because it was burning a hole in my veggie drawer!  Sweet potato in salad adds such an amazing texture and brown sugar like flavor!!  Huge fan!  Would also be great with some corn tossed in.  *darn just thought of that*  *next time*

While not entirely with the theme of vegan, I added a whole pack of bacon and some hard boiled eggs and it also turned out great.

I also boiled the potatoes before roasting them, for a bit of crispiness.

I would check the potatoes at about 22 minutes. I cooked for 25 and they were a little overdone, but still tasted great. Loved the flavor!

I liked the dish very much.  It received mixed reviews  first time round so I made adjustment . Roasting of the sweet potato baked first then placed everything under broiler in a convection oven for 4 minutes. I put the cumin in the dressing adding a tablespoon of Orange juice and a teaspoon of  Samba Oelek  or Thai chili garlic  Everything except the Sweet Potato sat in the dressing onion beans etc so they could soak up the juice and add to it. It was worth it as the onion added flavor and the black beans gained some . Will continue to make

I only had one sweet potato but made the recipe anyway.  I loved the taste and the blend of flavors.  I served it over spinach and put some balsamic salad dressing on top.  Definitely will make it again!

Very versatile. Honestly I changed it a bit because of the things I had on hand (parsley, not cilantro; white not red onion; coconut not olive oil,pan roasted not oven roasted) but it still turned out great! I will try the original recipe in the future. (Also, adding a small dollop of Greek yogurt takes this to the next level if you don’t mind making it not vegan.)

Delicious. I doubled the recipe and served it over greens, and it made a whole dinner for 4 people, with crescent rolls on the side. I topped the salad with avocado. Yum!! Went easy on the onions, and cooked the onions with the sweet potatoes for the last 10 min, and I highly recommend this. More cumin is also a good idea.

Simple to make, and I had all the ingredients in my house, which is amazing. I would recommend soaking the red onion in water before adding it, unless you really like the onion flavor to be the first taste. I served this over quinoa. Delicious and I would definitely make again.

Simple, tasty, and healthy. I wanted to make something different for a potluck and chose this. The recipe turned out great. I omitted the chili flakes because my kids won't eat anything spicy. I also decided to add some zest from the limes, but probably won't do that in the future because it was a tad on the bitter side as a result. Overall, I thought it was excellent and I'll definitely keep this one in my collection.

I would cut the onion in half next time. It overpowered the rest of the ingredients. Also keep an eye on the sweet potatoes so they don't burn.  Otherwise the family liked it as a side with Chili Lime Chicken.

As others suggested, I threw the onions in with the sweet potatoes for the last 5 minutes. I made it a day ahead for weekend guests. It was good though I think I might have liked it better warm or maybe with a different bean. The cold black beans didn't quite hit the mark for me but overall recipe is good.

I made it according to the recipe and it was delicious.  The lime juice adds a nice zing, that plays well with the sweet potato and onion!

Made a different recipe but with my changes it was very similar to this one. I mixed 1/2 tsp coriander, 1/2 tsp cumin, 1/2 tsp chili powder with one lime juiced and one clove of minced garlic and 2 tbs olive oil and a handful of chopped cilantro. I roasted one small red onion with the sweet potatoes for 35 mins at 400 degrees. Then I combined them with the sauce and the black beans. Pretty good.

Really good. Followed the recipe exactly. Added a bag of frozen corn at the end. Delicious. I think it would be even better after letting the flavors chill overnight.

This is delicious! I used purple sweet potatoes and put hot sauce on top. I could eat this everyday. So yummy and quick to make.

Great recipe! I skipped the pepper flakes and also added more lime juice. My 10 yr old son loved it!

So good! I ate this as a main dish and it was delicious. The raw onions can be a little much, so next time I might roast them for a few minutes with the potatoes.

Absolutely wonderful! The favors blend extremely well and this salad tastes terrific warm or cold. We took it to a potluck and there were many requests for the recipe. Thanks so much for posting this!

This was SO good!  My husband loved it and he doesn't usually like sweet potato dishes.  I left out the red pepper but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  I highly recommend this one!!
