Made these with my 2 year old today- fun and tasty. We decorated several ways and found we really needed the frosting to make the sprinkles stick. Cute idea!

This was a great idea and fun to make!  Super tasty, although me and my husband agree it does taste better the next day.  Making stripes with the sprinkles was going to be very time consuming so instead I opted to spread sprinkles that had red white and blue and same colored sprinkle stars and still looked oh so cute.  I needed no frosting, but what I did do was press the sprinkles in before it hardened too much.  Refrigeration could also be an option after this but we didn't need it.  The other problem I saw was I ended up with many scraps that weren't big enough to make either little or big stars with, so we ate those first, that way we don't give those to guests :).  Definitely something to do only on special occasions but it was definitely tasty enough to just have the regular square cut outs on any day...that's why it gets five stars!

I thought cutting the shapes out was giogn to be difficult (we actually made mickey heads).  It really was pretty simple, and I was able to do it when they were still gooey enough that I was able to peice all the scraps back together to make sure I didn't have any leftovers.  

Definitely need to make sure you have a big bowl if you're going to go the microwave route though - I should have known the marshmallows would expand, just wasn't expecting them to expand QUITE as much as they did.

This was very good but a little tricky to cut  out the stars! This is a nice treat to eat when you are watching the fire woks! ;-)
