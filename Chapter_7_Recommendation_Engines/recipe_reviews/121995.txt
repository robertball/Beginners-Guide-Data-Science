I made this bread today and it came out really moist.  I decrease the sugar by a quarter, replace half the all purpose flour with whole wheat pastry flour, replace half the oil with a jar of apple baby food and use 2 bananas.  The carrot really made the banana bread different from other banana bread I made so far.

This is an excellent recipe. I was looking for a way to use up extra carrots - and I also had some overripe bananas so I was in luck when I found this.  I did make a few changes to suit our tastes and it resulted in a great alternative. I omitted the nuts and instead added equal amounts of raisins. They plumped up in the batter and were a lovely complement to the flavors.  I also wanted to add an oat streusel - we love that crunch... and so I just mixed 1/4 quick cook oats, 1/4 AP flour, 1 Tbsp of sugar, 1 Tbsp of brown sugar and 2 Tbsp of melted butter with just a dash of cinnamon. Mixed all together and crumbled over the top. It did slow down the baking time, needing an additional 10 minutes but the result was a fabulous moist breakfast type bread that still had a yummy crunch to the topping.  I certainly recommend this recipe!!!

Absolutely delicious.I added 1tbsp of rolled oats instead of nuts as I was making this for my kids and made as giant muffins instead of a loaf and turned out great.Even my husband liked them and he doesn't eat bananas or carrots!

I loved this one, but make a few changes. I used half white and half brown sugar, and added nugmeg, allspice and ginger. I also put more cinnamon with the bananas. I also folded in some currants that i soaked in grand marnier (oj would prob work too)for a half an hour with the carrots and some vanilla extract. i doubled the batch and used cupcake lined muffin tins and this made 30 muffins. Sprinkled some extra nuts on top before puting in the oven, but I used walnuts instead of pecans.  Great recipe!

This is a tasty, moisty bread and a great base recipe that is easy to modify. I fel it needed a little "oomph" so I make some changes.   First, I used brown sugar instead of granulated sugar to add more flavor and moisture, doubled the amount of cinnamon, carrots, and nuts, and added 1/2 cup raisins. Awesome! Kids loved them, too! Instead of using the recommended pan size I made muffins (bake for 18-20 mins). This is now my staple recipe for carrot bread.

This turned out great. We left out the nuts and made muffins instead of bread. This makes great muffins, my kids loved these and so did my picky husband. You can't tell it has carrots in it. For carrots I used baby carrots and put them in the food processor. Great quick healthy snack...

My family loved this recipe.  My 2-year-old is going through a very picky stage, yet he ate several pieces of this.  I left out the nuts and added 1/2 t of vanilla.  My first loaf is gone so I will be making another one today.  I plan to have this in the house all the time!

Update:  I made some today and put the batter in 4 mini-loaf pans.  I cooked them at 325 for 35-40 minutes and they came out great.

Oh my, this is a perfect recipe if you are looking to use up your ripe bananas. I absolutely love the texture of this bread and the flavor to boot! We made this just as the recipe called for and it turned out great!!  The top is my favorite part because it is crusty and firm, but not hard or tough....sooo YUMMY!!  We have tried a couple of other recipes for banana bread but honestly, none compare to this one!  This will be a regular in our home.  Thank you very much for sharing your wonderful recipe!

This is a great recipe. I made it as is -- except I added oats in place of nuts, as some suggested (and that is all I had in the pantry!). Will definitely make again.

This recipe produced a big, beautiful loaf that I made for Hubs to take to his fishing buddies.  I used half white and half brown sugar and added 1/2 t. of vanilla.  Next time I make this I want to try changing the process a bit.  I think I’ll add the bananas, carrots and pecans to the sugar/oil/egg mixture and then simply fold in the flour mixture.  That might make for less mixing at the end, which can often make quick breads such as this tough.  I can also see adding a small (8 oz.) can of well-drained crushed pineapple.  I didn’t get to taste this so I’ll have to go with what Hubs said when he got home - 5 STARS!!

As is the recipe was good but not spectacular.  It suited my needs to use up both some carrots and some bananas.  And it was moist and tasty.  But it needed something.  I think when I make it again, I would add more spices (nutmeg, cloves and more cinnamon).  I did use brown sugar for half the sugar.

I loved this.  It tasted similar to carrot cake, only healthier!  I used half dark brown sugar and half whole wheat flour.  Baked 12 individual squares for ~22 min.

I barely let this cool before I took a piece to try... the smells oozing out of the oven made me so anxious to try a bite! It was SO good. I loved the flavor. I made some cream cheese frosting to drizzle on the top - that made it taste like carrot cake! I will say the carrot cake flavor seemed to be less later in the day, you start to notice the banana more. But it's still a delcious bread, nonetheless! Pecans are perfect for this, so don't leave them out! I toasted quickly before adding them to the recipe.

Just made this last night and my husband said, "it tastes like Bob Evan's Banana bread!" I did adjust the recipes in the following manner: reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup, Use 1/2 teaspon of baking soda, 1/2 of baking powder, and split the flour between all-purpose and wheat flour.

Banana bread meets carrot cake!  What's not to like?  This came out very moist and delicious.  I did double the cinnamon and ended up baking it for 70 minutes.  It worked out great for me because I had some ripe bananas and a bunch of carrots that I bought on sale and was wondering what to do with.  I usually don't add nuts to banana bread, but I decided to add the pecans for this recipe and it was great - made it a lot more like carrot cake.

For health reasons, I used 1 egg, only 3/4 cup sugar, replaced half the AP flour with whole wheat pastry flour, and replaced the oil with apple sauce.  It came out really moist, and held together nicely, but with not a whole lot of flavor, and I don't believe removing the oil or reducing by one egg affected the flavor.  It never has before.  So I will experiment with spices and flavorings because the moistness was great and I like that it is a milk-free recipe.

This was an excellent snack for the kids to enjoy while they are on their Easter break!  They have gluten allergies, so I substiuted 3/4 cup white rice flour, 3/4 cup brown rice flour, 1/4 cup tapioca flour, 1/4 cup potato starch, and 1 teaspoon xanthum gum for the flour.  The bread came out mosit and delicious!  They couldn't even taste the carrots in it.  We will be making this bread for a long time to come!

This is very good!  I subbed applesauce for the oil, but then added a tablespoon of canola oil for moisture, and reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup.  I added 1/4 cup oat bran and 1/2 cup quick oats, used 3 small bananas and about 1 1/2 cups carrot.  I added 1/2 tsp baking powder and 1/4 tsp nutmeg, and increased the cinnamon to 1 full tsp.  Very tasty - I thought it would be carrot cakey, but I don't really taste the carrots - they just give it flecks of color and a subtle sweetness.

Very good bread! I used three bananas, two carrots, and pumpkin pie spice. It was devoured by my roommates, and I would make it again. My pan was strange dimensions but it still cooked in 55 minutes.

This is a keeper! Simple, yummy, and can clearly handle plenty of modifications. When bananas don't get eaten I just put them in the freezer, so they're always handy for something like this. I used butter rather than vegetable oil (I prefer butter or olive oil in my cooking), and walnuts rather than pecans (I like the bitterness of walnuts, plus I often have some handy because I make a lot of baklava). Came out GREAT at about 60 minutes in the oven. Thanks!

Delicious! I made a couple healthier substitutions, but otherwise followed exactly and it turned out great!

Excellent bread. Perfect amount of sweetness - not excessively sweet like some breads. I substituted raisins for the nuts & added 1/2 tsp. vanilla extract.

Wonderful!  I used 1 cup of white, 1 cup wheat an 1 Tbl of wheat germ since I'm giving this to my 18 mo son.  It's so moist and everyone in the house loves it!

Followed the recipe, but made into muffins so that it was easier for us to take in our lunches and used walnuts instead of pecans.  They turned out  moist and flavorful; although, they mainly just taste like banana bread.  That is actually the really nice part, you get the benefits of adding the carrot without a strong carrot flavor.

I made this recipe because I wanted to try using the leftover carrot pulp from the juice extractor....must admit this was a total success. I used the same amount of pulp than grated.  Will absolutely make this again...the kids loved it!!!  8 kids and a boyfriend tested this recipe so its a keeper!!!  Thumbs up Beulah =D

I love the combination of banana and carrots.  This loaf is so moist and totally delicious.  I baked this in a Pampered Chef stoneware loaf pan, it took me 75 minutes to bake, but it was well worth it...

I'm a big fan of this recipe!  I made it exactly as written, but added walnuts and coconut to the batter because I didn't have pecans.  I will make this over and over again.  I like that it has a small amount of oil compared to other carrot bread recipes.

I didn't find this bread to have a lot of flavour - neither banana nor carrot.  It was ok.....I think maybe it would be better with some raisins.  I do like the idea of adding grated carrots to banana bread to make it more healthy-like.  I'll probably try this recipe again when I have some carrots to use up!

Great recipe, my boys just ate it all up!  Only change I made was I used 1 cup of whole wheat flour and added 1/3 cup orange juice to moisten the w/w flour.  Also, I did not meausure but put in 2 bananas and one large carrot.  worked great!

My new favorite! I have food allergies so I used some flour substitutions with this - 1/2 c. rice, 1/2 c. spelt, 1/2 potatoe starch, and 1/2 oat flour, along with an extra 1/4 cup of banana instead of the carrot and nuts. It turned out wonderfully and was very moist. Thanks!

My family loves this recipe!  I've made it a few times and we run out of banana bread before our next batch of bananas are ripe enough to make more.  I've tried making other recipes from this website and this one is our absolute favorite.  Highly recommend!  This is the only kind of banana bread my 2 year old will eat.  And the bonus is she's eating carrots!  Ha Ha!

I thought this was good banana bread.  I used pre-shredded carrots, and substituted half of the oil with applesauce.  It is very moist, with nice banana flavor.  I will make this again when I have ripe bananas to use up!

Thanks for the unique recipe!  I was afraid the banana flavor wouldn't come out, but quite the opposite.  I ended up substituting 1/2 c oats for the nuts, added 1/2 tsp vanilla and 1/4 tsp each of cardamon,  cloves, nutmeg, and allspice.

Tasty recipe. Like another reviewer, I made them into muffins, topping them with granola and baking for 15-20 minutes.  Really nice way to use extra fruit and veggie.  Next time I'm going to add in some zucchini, too! Thanks for sharing.

Kids really liked this.  Used canola oil instead of veg oil and whole wheat flour. Liked the added carrot factor and a great way to use up over ripe bananas, I used 4.....great breakfast or snack.

This banana bread is awesome!! Its very moist and the carrot gives it an great flavour. I followed 3water's alterations and the bread came out perfect. I've also tried other banana bread recipes and they definitely don't turn out as good as this!

This is a great recipe!  I used it as a base, though.  I used half WW flour, half all purpose.  Half white and half brown sugar.  I added a splash of vanilla, a shake of nutmeg, 1/2 t baking powder, 1/2 c rolled oats and finally 1/2 c oat bran for added fiber.  I didnt measure the bananas, but used 4.  Everything else was the same.  The only issue I had with my changes was in volume.  I made one loaf and 6 muffins, which took 21 minutes to cook.  Next time I think I'll add an additional carrot or two.  Thanks for the delicious recipe!

Made this last night in mini-muffin tins.  Baked 20 minutes.  Pushed down center while still on pan, then removed.  When cool filled center with cream cheese frosting.  AMAZING!!!  Made 48 yesterday & almost gone already!

I have NEVER had so many compliments on a loaf of any kind. I was told that it was very light and fluffy, yet moist and wasn't too powerful with banana or too heavy like banana bread can be. I took it to a Strata meeting and it was all gone at the end..normally no one eats anything at these things!  For the most part I followed the recipe, however I did double everything in order to make 2 loafs. Here are the things I changed: I used whole wheat flour instead of all-purpose (it was still really moist) Instead of grated carrots, I blended them in my magic bullet (you could use a blender) with some water to make a puree (it took about one small bag of mini carrots..so for one loaf it would only need half a bag) Instead of pecans I did what another reviewer had done and I added Oats. I also added some flax seed (about 1 tbls to the doubled mixture) I also sprinkled brown sugar on the top before baking  It was faaaaaaantastic!!! Even my husband loved it...he thought I was trying to 'sneak' veggies in it so didn't want to try any..but he did. I really want to try it using less sugar so we can eat more of it, so that will be my next attempt.

i did make a few subs, but is wonderful recipe nonetheless.  i used carrot pulp left from juicing organic carrot juice, subbed applesauce for oil, honey for sugar, and added frozen cranberries, and doubled the pecans.  it was guiltfree delicious!

Yum Yum Yum.  So great.  Moist and tasty.  Used whole wheat flour and applesauce just for a little healthy kick.  So lovely with tea.

This bread is not only healthy and full of fiber it tastes amazing! I omitted the nuts and added oats in it's place, I also added a pinch more cinnamon than the recipe calls for. I will be making this bread alot more in the future!

Yummy recipe!  I used applesauce instead of oil,  and wheat flour for the white. I also added a tablespoon of cinnamon. I finely chopped my carrots instead of grated them.  I made 12 large muffins and one small loaf out of this recipe.   A yummy and healthy muffin!

I cannot eat dairy or soy so it was wonderful to find a recipe without milk or butter.  It was delicious and moist.  I added 2 T of steel cut oats instead of nuts.  Next time I will try cutting back on the sugar and add a little wheat germ and/or whole wheat flour in place of white flour for extra nutrition.  We always seem to have bananas that get too ripe so I will make more bread to put in the freezer.

I did not like this recipe, I even added extra Banana and I still did not like the Flavor, it was very dry.  First time ever we threw out Banana bread in my house.  I was so hopeful I love carrot cake and banana bread so I was sure it was going to be a winner, I was wrong!

i loved the idea of banana and Carrots but this recipe wasnt what i expected. I mean, it was ok, but thats it. Nothing spectacular. Maybe because i added a teaspoon of vanilla and 1/2 teaspoon of Rum Extract...?

Yummy! Really simple and hassle free. I only had one egg (forgot to chek for ingredients before making... oops!) so I substituted the other with 1/4 cup of milk. Also added a teensy bit of vanilla essence, and substituted 50g of white with brown sugar, and about 100g of white with wheatmeal flour. Turned out more cake-lke for me, I had to use a 9 x 13 inch rectangular tin instead because there was so much mixture! But I'll defnitely be making this again, it was deeeelicious (and healthy?)! Thanks for the recipe!

This bread is very good. I used pureed carrots instead of grated.  I also substituted 1/2 cup of the white flour with whole wheat flour and another 1/8 cup or so with wheat germ to make it a little more healthy.  I always have this bread on hand. My 10 month old loves it.

This recipe had a totally different taste than any other banana bread I have ever made or tasted...which was what I was looking for.  The combination of carrots and bananas sorta reminded me of corn bread.  Topped with crunchy raisin granola.  Would have made great muffins too.

Not too sweet, delicious and moist.  I only had 1/2 cup worth of bananas, so I only made a half recipe.  I got two small loaves out of a batch.  I omitted the nuts, as I made this for my son, who likes nuts, just not in his food.

I love this recipe, I make it all the time.  The only thing I would change is that you don't really need that much sugar, especially if the bananas you use are quite ripe.  Also I like using brown sugar instead of white.

I really like this bread, though I would like a stronger banana flavor, and I think the addition of vanilla would compliment it as well.  It's very versatile too.  I have a glut of winter squash from my garden, so instead of grated carrots, I used shredded winter squash.  It was very moist.  I took the suggestion of another reviewer and mixed all of the wet ingredients with the bananas, squash and pecans, and then folded in the dry ingredients for a one bowl recipe.  This is a keeper!

I too loved this recipe. I read other suggestions and too modified. I substituted about .3 cup flour with oatmeal, added walnuts instead of pecans, added chia seeds, raisins. Used only 2 bananas for this and a little extra carrot. Substituted some white flour with brown. My family loves it...told me never to forget EXACTLY how I made it.
