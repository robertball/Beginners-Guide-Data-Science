We all LOVED this dish!  With the exception of adding additional salt,pepper, and garlic powder (which I do on almost all recipes) I followed to a "T".  My 8 year old ate 2 huge bowls and I'm too embarrassed to say how much my husband ate.  Thanks for the recipe!  I will definitely be making this one again.

Let me preface my review by stating I've never heard of this dish before, so I have no basis for comparison as far as "authentic" goes.  I stumbled across it and thought it looked like an interesting ground beef recipe & decided to give it a try!  As I am the first reviewer, I really tried to not alter it.  However, I detest celery, so I did leave that out.  I also was forced to use dried as opposed to fresh parsley.  Everything else was the same (ok ok, I couldn't resist adding more garlic, as usual). It's pretty good!  It was a little bland for my tastes, but that could have been partially due to no celery and the dried parsley. I also used a sweeter red wine and I'm not sure how a merlot or cab would affect the flavor.  I added some sea salt when I served it and that was a nice touch.  Thanks, Woman Whisking, for a different way to use ground beef!

This is extremely Good! I made it as written except I added salt and pepper.I served it with white rice and yellow rice.I liked the yellow rice better.This dish has a very South American flavor to it.My 17 year old also loved it. She said it tasted like pepper steak.This recipe makes 8 generous servings if you use 2 cups of rice.

Was awesome! Made plain ol boring ol ground beef into a fancy dinner. The flavors were so deep, it tasted like something I would be ordering, not making. I loved this dish. Oh, and ps, leftovers were just as good.

I really liked this.  it was different than what I imagined it would be, but in a good way.  I made these changes:  cut recipe in half (4 servings), 2tbsp dry parsley in place of 1/2c fresh, whole can of diced tomato rather than half, added some cinnamon, no green pepper, beef stock in place of red wine, and I cooked the rice with it all after it was done simmering... to do this I added 3/4c rice and remaining 1.25c beef broth, stirred it together, then cooked until rice was done.  I like to mix rice in with things like this because it lets it soak up the flavors.

This was amazing! I cut it in half, used the whole can of tomatoes and left out the celery. Served over yellow rice. Hubby couldn't get enough! Try it with a few splashes of hot sauce, yum!

I am the submitter of this recipe and thought I would add a helpful hint:  Use a wine that is flavorful and one that you enjoy!  This can make the difference of your recipe turning out bland or packed full of flavor!    As the old saying goes, don't use a wine in a recipe that you wouldn't drink by itself!     :)

Very good, but very bland. I added salt, black peeper and two teaspoons of sugar. I served it over whit rice and thought of adding a can of tomato soup and serving it over elbow noodles. That might be a nice alteration.

This is an all time family favorite!!  It's delicious and easy!  I add yellow rice to the pot about 25 min before I'm ready to eat and let it absorb the liquid.  This is a great recipe!!

This was amazing! We replaced half a pound of the ground beef with chorizo and that really gave it an extra kick. We had leftovers for days and it tastes really good in eggs for breakfast.

This recipe was all right, and we enjoyed it, but it wasn't anything particularly special or interesting.  I did end up adding salt and pepper, which helped, but I don't think I'll be coming back to it any time soon.  I used the leftovers to make Moussaka.

delicious. only things i changed were using only 1 onion, a little light on the olive oil, 1.5 cans diced tomatoes, used only 5 eggs, and i doubled the red pepper. Also added salt and pepper a couple times throughout cooking. served over yellow rice.

Not a bad recipe but we found it very dry and a bit bland. Needed something extra for the flavour and texture.

Only additions were 1/8 cinnamon, only 1 TBL. dried parsley, 1/8 garlic powder. I don't think it tasted like anything special, a bit bland. I didn't serve it with rice, but it still reminded me of Hamburger Helper.

Followed the recipe almost to the "T" but at the very end we squeezed half a lemon on top. The lemon really kicked it up.

This was a great way to use ground beef differently. Served it with the Brazilian white rice and added more salt and pepper for tast. Also, I was glad I used extra lean ground beef because there wasn't much direction for draining the meat so I didn't. It was almost a little too greasy.
