This was DELICIOUS! I did follow the directions except, before I got started, I cubed up some chicken tenderloin strips, sauteed them in about 2T of evoo. Once it was about halfway cooked, that is when I started adding onion, garlic and then the peppers. Then I followed it from the recipe. My husband loves this soup! My sons love this soup! I will be making it again.
