Great for Valentines Day!  The recipe is alot quicker if you use a ready made angel food cake.  I let it chill in a 13 x 9 pan and garnish it with sliced strawberries.  It slices easily, so next time, I might use large cookie cutters in the shape of hearts to serve.  It's really good -- everyone loved it.

THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU!  This is exactly the recipe my mother used to make when I was a kid.  The entire extended family made her bring it for every gathering.  But unfortunately, she lost the recipe.  I showed her this one and it's the same!  I am so thrilled.  Not only is a piece of my youthful holiday memories restored, but I can now make this fabulous dessert.  Thanks Matthew!

I must have done something wrong with this.  The angel food cake turned into mush even though I thought I had waited long enough to mix it in.  Two different people said it looked like pink brains. Taste was ok, but the consistency with the mushed cake was not appealing.

I used fresh strawberries instead of frozen and used an angel food cake already made from the bakery.  This dessert was fantastic!  Make sure you let the jello combo gel up fairly well so you don't end up with mushy angel food cake.  Will make this again in the summer as it is light and fluffy.  Loved it!

Delightfully simple, light, and delicious! Made it to take to work; forgot to get a pic until there was only a little left...:) Like some of the other commentators, I waited till the Jello mixture (using less water) was the consistency of egg whites. Folded in the cool whip and then the cake cubes; put it in a 9x13‚Äù pan, spread a little more cool whip over top and garnished with fresh strawberries (sliced). Everyone at work loved it!

I love this recipe! It's the same dessert my grandma used to make. Make sure you let the jello and strawberries get pretty jelled before adding the angel food cake. I buy the baked cake from the store instead of making my own.

Mine was way too soggy. I think the water could be cut back. Strawberries hold a lot of water. Anyway, I would not make this again and take the chance on it being that soggy.
