I used a half turkey breast (bone in) for this recipe and it turned out moist and delicious.  I halved the herbs as well, and added pats of butter under the skin too.  Was done in 1.5 hours.  Wonderful!

This turkey was loaded w/ flavor. I cut slits all over the turkey & inserted  slices of garlic. I put butter pats under the skin & rubbed butter all over the turkey before sprinkling w/ the herbs & I  left out the salt entirely...it wasn't needed. The garlic permeated the turkey & added so much flavor. We all loved this...thanks! I served it w/ Buttery Cooked Carrots, fresh corn on the cob & Citrus Mousse for dessert.

I thought this was a GREAT recipe. I did make some necessary additions though. I cut pockets in the skin and added pats of butter. I also added garlic to the seasonings. It came out very moist and full of a nice subtle flavor. It was delicious and everyone raved about it. It was a very easy recipe and tastes like you worked really hard!

I was looking for something simple that I could throw on the grill while doing backyard work and this fit the bill.  It came out nice & tender, the kids LOVED it.  Thanks!

Delicious...did not change a thing, execpt, I spread 2 TBSP butter under the turkey breast skin, and then followed it with the spices.  I also cooked the breast upside down on the rack, so that all of the juices would run down into the breast meat.  My husband thought it was awesome!  Thanks for sharing this one.

This recipe was awesome!! Only changes I made was that I put the breast in a cooking bag and cooked it breast down.  It took exactly 2 hours to cook.  The turkey came out soooo juicy and the flavors were incredible!  This recipe definetly goes into my personal recipe file.  Can't wait to make again!! THANK YOU!!!

Excellent!  I did add some pats of butter under the skin and ended up adding 1 1/2 cups chicken broth after about 30 minutes and continued basting with more chicken broth throughout the 2 hours 15 minutes it took to cook my almost 7 lb breast.  It was moist, flavorful, and delicious.

My husband REALLY liked this turkey, but to me it was just "okay".  The herb flavor was just a little too strong for my taste.  Might make again, but I think I'll try some other recipes.  One plus is that it is very easy to make.

I gave this 5 stars because it is very good in relation to how quick and easy it is. I made 1/2 a breast and halved the spices. I added garlic and butter under the skin and cooked it in my clay cooker - it was done in 90 minutes and was very moist and tasty, everyone liked this one.

Good and SO easy.  I only added a little bit of seasoning salt (not near the recommended amount) and even then it was way too satly- my turkey must have been injected with a saline solution.  So watch out for that.

extremely easy with simple ingredients i already had on hand.  i sprayed my crockpot with pam, added a small boneless/skinless turkey breast and covered with the seasonings (i also added in a tablespoon of garlic powder), turning the breast to get all sides covered. my turkey breast came with a gravy packet, so i added that in place of the water to my pot and set it on high for four hours, when it had reached 170 degrees. I didn't baste the breast during the time it was in the crockpot and it turned out extremely moist. with some vegetables on the side, this made a very tasty meal.

This recipe was sooooooo simple,took minutes to prepare.  I did leave out the lemon peel which I think was a wise choice.  The turkey was very tasty and moist.

I made this recipe for my family on Thanksgiving.  We had two turkey breasts, which one of them I made the traditional way.  Everyone loved the herbed turkey so much better.  When splitting up the turkey to take home, no one wanted the traditional one.  Wonderful recipe.

Delicious. I cooked in the oven. Very tender and juicy. I did add extra butter under the skin of the breasts.

I made this exactly as written and the seasoning overpowered the taste of the turkey breast too much for my liking. I prefer an authentic "turkey taste" so this didn't do it for me. Completely changed the taste, but I'm giving it three stars because it was easy, moist, and my turkey-hating family members liked it.

We cooked this in our deep covered baker that is a stone and it turned out sooo juicy.  We also added some garlic powder as well.

Took the advice of others and cut back on the salt (1t.). Didn't seem like enough seasoning, so I added a little garlic powder and onion powder. Also put butter under skin and all over. Cooked breast-down. It came out so moist and juicy! Absolutely delicious with nice, crispy browned skin.

Very good, except next time I will not season with any salt.  The Turkey Breast I bought was already very salty.

As someone who has NEVER cooked turkey before, I must say: Fantastic Recipe!  I did listen to other recommendations to put small slits in the turkey and fill them with garlic.  I also buttered the turkey before covering it in herbs and it was sooo good!  I had to halve everything since I was using a 2.5 pound turkey breast, but it was still amazing!
