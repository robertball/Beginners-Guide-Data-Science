Yummy, Yummy, Yummy!  This salad is great and has so many possibilities.  I have made it with grilled chicken and grilled steak sliced thinly - and both were sensational!  Another option is shrimp or crab.  Once I was out of bleu cheese and I used feta and it was equally as good.  I will make this again and again! 5 big stars.

Easy and quite good. Defintely a repeater. Use a good crumbled blue cheese. I added very thinly sliced red onion, just a bit and thought it was a good option.

I've been making a similar salad to this for several years and I've been asked to bring it to potlucks.  I only use mixed greens, and don't use the lemon juice.  However, I do had a thin sliced apple (fuji, gala, etc).  This really adds to the flavor.  I do season the balsamic dressing with a little salt & pepper.  EXCELENT!!!

Wonderful recipe...love bleu cheese but don't like all the fat of a creamy dressing...this works perfectly!!  Have already used over and over.

Made for recipe group. This is an alright salad, nothing wrong with it, but nothing real special. I agree that the dressing left something to be desired... I would add a pinch of sugar, I think. After my first couple of bites, the dressing was a bit too intensely vinegary for me. Toasting the walnuts would be an improvement too. Still this is fine as a basic salad and I'll probably make it again, adjusting the dressing a little.

Recipe Group selection of 11/19/11.  I just made a test run as lunch for DD and me and we loved this, so it will be on our Thanksgiving menu.  I used white balsamic vinegar so there was no muddy look to the salad thjat you get with dark balsamic.   The walnuts play off the bleu cheese wonderfully - thanks for a great new recipe.

Recipe Group Selection:  19, Nov. 2011.  I really liked this salad, but I LOVE bleu cheese.  I made this in 2 individual bowls because I used feta cheese on my husbands (not a bleu cheese fan).  I toasted the walnuts to bring out the flavor.  The next time I make this I'll add dried cranberries, green onion and maybe a little tomato.  We both enjoyed the dressing - it is a little on the tart side.  Thought this was a good selection this week.

Made this for Recipe Group, and apparently we're in the minority, but this was pretty boring for us. Hubby said it was too vinegary, and I thought the dressing could use some more flavor (besides the flavor of vinegar). The salad part was good (what's not to like), but the dressing just didn't do it for us. Thanks for sharing.

Yummy. Sometimes I add cranberries. I never tried it with lemon juice, just oil and white vinegar. I sometimes use FIG white balsamic!
This is very versatile.

I gave this 4 stars because it was so fast to prepare.  I enjoyed the salad, but the dressing was lacking a bit.  I think I would like it better with the dressing from this site as well called Deliciously Sweet Salad with Maple, Nuts, blueberries.  That is not the full name, but you can find it if you search with that title.  I will make this salad again if I have had one of those really bad days at work, and I am too tired to prepare something more time consuming.

I made this for the recipe group selection of 11-19th, I gave four stars for being quick and easy on a hectic night. I used pecans instead of walnuts. It would be easy enough to throw in some dried cranberries which would make a great addition. The dressing was pretty plain and you could easily add some herbs to spark it up. I would make it again when in a pinch for time.

This is the Recipe Group Selection for 11/19/11.   If youâ€™re short on time, this recipe makes an easy and satisfactory salad.  The dressing is simple and quick to prepare, but I wished it had a little more complexity.

I just had this for lunch with a slice of homemade cheese and onion quiche. The only thing I did differently was to throw in a handful of arugula - I can't get enough of that stuff! The flavors work perfectly together. Thanks, Nan!
