I came across this recipe while looking for something to do with my fresh blueberries.  I made this recipe as instructed only I substituted fresh blueberries for the canned.  I put a pint of blueberries in a saucepan with about 1/3 cup of sugar, 1/2 cup of water and boiled for 5 minutes to thicken, I also whisked in about 1/4 cup of corn starch to help thickening.  I let it cool before spreading on the cream cheese layer.  After the bars came out of the oven, I let it cool enough so I was able to put it in the fridge -much easier to slice!! This is one of the best recipes ever!  I have never found a recipe my family loved so much using blueberries!  I think the only way it gets better is adding a big spoon of either whipped cream or cool whip - a big dollup!  I made it last night and I just returned from the store with more ingredients to make more!!!!

These are off the charts insane. I made three small changes--I added one cup of fresh blueberries (I really wanted to taste the blueberres) and a teaspoon of lemon zest AND I used pecans instead of walnuts, as we don't care for walnuts. We can't keep our hands off of them. Out of the whole batch, two "bars" remain. They are SO flipping good. Awesome pantry dessert/snack. We love these. I might try this with cherry pie filling and almonds next time. I bet that would be really good, too.

I made this for a family gathering. Everyone loved it. They liked the chewing crust. The blueberry and cream cheese was yummy. I used a butter flavored cake mix. I bet a lemon flavored cake mix would be good too. It was easy to make. I used a 10 x 12 pan and baked for 50 mins. I love fast & easy recipes.

Holy Blueberry Hill!! These are awesome! I did have to use some substitutions based on what I had (or didn't have is more like it). No canned blueberry pie filling. I made my own with 1 and a half cups frozen blueberries. Bring half a cup of water, the blueberries and 1/3 cup white sugar to a boil. In small bowl wisk 1/4 cup cornstarch in 1/2 cup cold water. Very gently wisk this mixture into the bluberries. Boil about 5 minutes. Wisking gently and often. Set aside and let cool completely. I also didn't have a boxed cake mix so I used an AR recipe (Cake Mixes from Scratch)for yellow cake. I used the entire (dry ingredients only) cake mix (with complete disregard to the blueberry recipe calling for 18oz. of cake mix.) Turned out great! Made a thick crust that was just right. I baked this in a 9x13in. metal pan at 325 degrees for 55 minutes. Let it cool on the counter then it went in the fridge for a few hours prior to slicing it up into squares. I can't say enough how good this is. Looks kinda fancy, too. Thanks for this recipe!!

You can't eat just one! My changes: We had a larger group, so I used a large jelly-roll pan (made about 35 servings). The crust was thinner, but everyone loved it! Also had to make my own quick version of pie filling w/ our fresh blueberries (see the comments above), and used only 2 C. of the conf. sugar, but it all came out fantastic! GREAT recipe - thanks for sharing!

Absolutely delicious!!!  Made in a 9X13 pyrex dish and baked 10 minutes longer.  Took to dinner at a friends house and everyone had 2 pieces.  I think next time I may try it with cherry pie filling and sliced almonds.

Definitely give this one a try!  It is wonderful!!  The 1st time I made this, I followed the recipe as written and loved it, but I like to play with recipes so the 2nd time I reduced the butter and added applesauce which worked, but made the dough stickier and a little harder to work with when spreading it in the pan.  Next time I make this I think I will try a lemon cake mix because that sounds good too.

Entered 09/14/09..What can I say? This is absolutely fabulous. For some reason, I had to leave it in the oven for about 10 minutes longer though. And I was wondering, does anyone know if this would freeze good? **Update**09/21/09..I made this this weekend using chocolate cake mix and cherry filling. I also cut the sugar down to 2 cups. So good...

WOW!  Very easy to make and looks so decadent!  I did use cherry pie filling, baked in pampered chef stoneware bar pan about 52 mins.  Drizzled melted chocolate over the top.  Great recipe.   Will make again with other flavors.

Didn't have any blueberry pie filling, so substituted cherry. Other than that, followed recipe exactly. The cake crust was a little overpowering, kind of like eating raw batter. Overall, pretty good, though.

I made this for a luncheon at school.  I came home with an empty pan!  Easy and delicious.  It's a new favorite.

These were just okay for me.  I used a lemon cake mix but otherwise followed recipe exactly.  They are very pretty but thin, hard to get out of the pan without slopping around.  I brought them for a bake sale and they sold out, and one person asked for the recipe.  But I probably wont make again.

Your kidding, right? Not enough batter to spread in a jelly pan. Tried in a 9 x 13. One hour later it is STILL baking. Center will not set. If it ever finishes it will be too late for the party.

Family loved this recipe. I made it according to recipe but used fresh blueberries instead and it turned out great! Makes a great summertime/fresh fruit dessert - it's a keeper!

I am making this recipe for the second time, and i am taking it to my church for a pitch in dinner.  It is excellent.  I would suggest adding a table spoon of lemon juice or some lemon zest to the cream cheese mixture, just to give it some zing.  This is really a treat.

This dessert was so good and so easy I will be making it over and over again!...I did use fresh blueberries, cooked with water, sugar and cornstarch then cooled instead of canned blueberries. I can imagine you could use different kinds of cake mix and different fruits too.

I completely changed this recipe to use what I had on hand, and for that new recipe, I give it 5 stars.  Substitutions:  white cake mix with almond extract added to batter, cherry pie filling, chopped almonds.  Omit coconut.  This turned out fabulous!  It was very pretty and easy to make.    I'd love to try the original recipe when I have ingredients!

A very bad experience. Could not get these to cook all the way through. Left them in the oven at a lower temp to try to get them cooked after the initial 45-55 minute time period and all that did was way overbrown the crust.  On to finding a better recipe....
