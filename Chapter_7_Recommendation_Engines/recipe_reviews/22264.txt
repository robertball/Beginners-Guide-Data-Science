I omitted nuts. This banana cake is OUT OF THIS WORLD. The caramel topping is a cross between frosting and glaze. I brought it to bubbling then poured over the cake and placed it under the broiler for a few minutes. I used more banana than the recipe called for and it came out very moist. (very ripe bananas as well)

Lightly fragrant, moist, and soft. But this recipe seems to be missing some flavoring ingredients. I subbed cake flour for all purpose, used 1/4 cup + 2 tbsp margarine, 1/4 cup less sugar, and sour cream for the buttermilk. Also added 1/4 cup raisins, 1/2 tsp vanilla and coconut extract and omitted the frosting, it's sweet enough as is. Next time I'll add some cinnamon and 1/4 tsp salt too. Also, the cake is much better a day or two after baking.

I made this recipe with my exchange student and it turned out wonderful!  I'm sure it would have been even better if I'd had a candy thermometer for the icing but, hey, it still worked out.  It was great even a couple days after and I'm not sure about after that because it became very addicting.

This recipe truly distinguishes a BANANA CAKE from simply banana bread. 

I baked mine in a 4 inch deep 8 inch round pan and just dumped all the batter in and it reached a little more than 1/2 of the pan. I checked at 3o minutes as the recipe recommends but the center was still soft so I slightly decreased the temp so it wouldn't brown too much and ended up baking it an additional 15 minutes or a total of 45 minutes.

I used cake flour instead of all purpose and added an additional banana and it came out GREAT!

No need for any glaze or frosting on this one.

This cake is absolutely moist and delicious! It looks quite professional and tastes even better the next day.  I made it yesterday and my family are ready for me to make another one.  My 2 1/2 year-old loved the frosting.

This cake recipe is delicious, very moist.  I used 4 bananas and used 3 cake pans for this one recipe. I extended the baking time by 15 minutes or when toothpick comes out clean. I made cream cheese frosting instead the caramel icing shown. Layered icing heavily between layers and on top. It taste like you would imagine Grandma's would taste, so home-made, moist, and rich.  Cream Cheese Frosting: Two 8 ounce Cream Cheese                                  Two cups Powdered Sugar                                  One Stick Margarine                                  One tsp. Vanilla Cream softened margarine, cheese, and sugar together Stir in vanilla  So Good! Enjoy!

WOW, is this sweet!  Too sweet for me, although my husband loved it.

I think I'll add some salt to the caramel frosting next time, to achieve more of the sweet/salty balance I associate with caramel.

Other than the excessive sweetness (which is just a matter of personal preference), the cake was very good - moist and extremely flavorful.

I made this cake according to the recipe, but added a chocolate ganache between the layers.  It was great!

This is the best banana cake I've had. This cake is so moist and delicious.  I used a 9x13 pan and cooked it a few minutes more but checked it every minute or so. My family loved it!---- RaynellW

I followed the recipe but I must have done something wrong as the cake was very dry.  I don't think I'll try it again.

To the owner of this recipe: This was super moist and the yummiest banana cake even though I totally messed your recipe and instructions up! 

I made this cake one evening and was going to serve it for my nephew's 16th Birthday. Well, of course, word came he wanted a cake from Baskin Robbin. So the cake was made already but not the icing. I thought well good I have this cake all to myself. Yes, I tasted it. Yes, it was so yummy, so moist.  In a day or so I had 1 row of the cake gone and decided I had better make the icing before it is gone.  Mind you I grew up with Penuche Icing, Caramel Icing or Maple Icing. My mom has now passed, so any help from her...nope. Albeit, I do think she and dad were laughing at me from Heaven. So onward goes my mess.

As I gathered the ingredients, for the icing I realized I had forgotten to put the egg yolks in the cake!! Oh no! Stupid me! LOL. too late now.

So I proceed. All was going well, I was cooking the icing and as it was boiling but not reaching soft ball stage? This was taking way too long now. I kept looking at the recipe instructions and one time I realized I had AGAIN forgotten the stupid egg whites. insert face slap! So I rushed to get them, and put them in the bubbly mixture! No No No No...don't do that! I now had candied egg white strips, the boiling mess ended up getting  black specks as I guess it was scorched, the temp never reached soft ball stage. Needless to say this was a disaster. It was not fit for anything other than th

Omitted nuts and substituted all purpose flour for cake flour for a fluffier cake as opposed to more of a bread like consistency with the all purpose. My kids love it!! The caramel sauce tastes like caramel from Sees. Sooo good. Next time I might add a little run ??

Absolutely fantastic. This is the first time I've tried making caramel frosting and it came out runnier than I expected, but no big deal, it still worked and tasted extraordiary.

I made the cake exactly as the directions said; however, the cake came out heavy.  Perhaps I messed up with the egg whites?  It is still very moist and my family loves it.  I also did as instructed on the frosting, but it came out chewy while hot and hard now that it's cooled.  I was hoping for the gooey caramel frosting like is posted on the page.  My husband and sons love it, so I'm sure I will make it again, but I may try cake flour next time and also will see if I can figure out how to make the frosting more of a sauce type instead of hard.

5 stars for the caramel sauce/frosting, 4 for the cake. I made the cake in a 9x13 pan and just used the caramel as a sauce to drizzle over it. I used lite soymilk instead of the evaporated milk and the flavor was still awesome. I used 1/2 WW and 1/2 AP flour for the cake portion, subbed oil for butter and flax for the eggs. Still a very good cake.
