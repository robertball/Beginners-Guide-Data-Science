Like the idea of all the healthy ingredients ( I am not vegan) but sometimes make vegan recipes.   However, no way would I consider using 1 tbls. of baking soda ....just too much and leaves a very strong taste.    Some extra baking powder and about 1 tsp. baking soda might work better.   Not the best vegan recipe out there but could be with work.

Really like these. Subbed apple sauce for the oil (1 to 1 sub) to make them fat free and Nutritarian friendly. Next time I will leave out the nuts and chocolate to make them even healthier.

I changed a few of the amounts (only half chocolate chip and half raisin / 1/2 walnuts - substituted dried coconut 1/2 cup and peanut butter instead of peanut oil as I didn't have any. You could easily cut the whole recipe in half as it makes a big batch. I made mini muffins and this worked well as they were moist but very tasty! I was really pleased with the taste and my children like them too.

Just a note these muffins are not sugar free! They may not have any sugar added but they have 42.6 g of carbohydrates which is a lot of sugar per muffin! Carbohydrates are sugar! Especially for diabetics this is very important info. Just be aware not all "no sugar added" is "sugar free"!

I think these would have been a lot better to me, if I was on a strict vegan diet. Comparing them to regular muffins, there was just way to many bananas. I didn't think they were dry, cake, or soft like a muffin. The centers were more like cooked dense bananas. The add ins saved these. I used 1/2 chocolate chunks and 1/2 milk chocolate chips, as it was what I had. I cut the raisins to 2 1 oz boxes and it was plenty. Additionally, I subbed flax meal for the seed. I didn't have the seed and didn't want to bite into them anyway. I added a splash of vanilla also to the bananas. I made 1/2 recipe and got 12 good sized muffins. I like that this was egg free, made with whole grains, and didn't have any refined sugar. However, chocolate chips do have sugar. So, it is a little mis-leading. I ate about 3 of them and 1 more was eaten. The rest got tossed after they sat and no one ate them, unfortunately.
