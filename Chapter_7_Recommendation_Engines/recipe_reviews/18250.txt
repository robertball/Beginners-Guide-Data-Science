This was exactly what I was looking for a great hot/taco sauce good enough for everyday use. Will double the jalapenos next time, and add more garlic too.

This recipe was outstanding.  If I could rate this more than a 5 it would be a 10 in my book.  I added a little worchestire at the end and more peppers.  My dad said (and he likes HOT sauce) this was the best he ever had.  He has tried them all too.  Very good!  I will keep this as my secret too. ha!

Without knowing the ingredients, my husband tasted this and said, "It tastes ketchup-y."  He's right.  It's much too sweet for us.  The ketchup really ruined it, in our opinion.  I added more cumin and some onion powder to cut the sweetness.  It helped, so the salsa is now palatable.  But I will never make this again!

It's a fine recipe, but it's not "Hot Sauce".  Any Texan will tell you it's "SALSA".  Hot sauce is a thinner, liquid puree consisting mainly of peppers, vinegar and salt commonly served in a small, long-necked bottle and used to enhance the flavor of foods.  Salsa, on the other hand, is a more coarse mixture of peppers, tomatoes, onions, etc. commonly used as a dip with chips or eaten with mexican food.

The was a very good idea on how to make salsa.  I usually make the fresh salsa but this has turned out to be much better.  What makes it even better is, after cooking and it has cooled, put some into a blender and you have an amazing taco sauce to add to your easy to squeeze bottle.  Very good!!!

Definitely NOT a hot sauce.  I even doubled the Jalapeno's and it didn't help too much.  It should be listed as a sugar ketchup recipe.

This is the best hot sauce. It does take a little time to simmer, but is well worth the wait. You can adjust the amount of heat with the amount of peppers you choose to use. This will keep in the fridge forever!

This is outstanding! Went a little heavy on the jalapenos, minced garlic and also added worcestershire. I cooked it down quite a while to get the consistency I was looking for and then after it cooled I pureed the daylights out of it. FYI I save the empty ketchup squeeze bottles and reuse them for my homemade sauces.

Absolutely brilliant and really  versatile. I've added spoons of  the sauce to soups. casseroles & stews.
 used it on it's own with pasta and added it to
 pasta sauce
I'm in the UK and this style of sauce is not commonly found here.
 I've passed the recipie on to many friends.
Thank you, Barbara!.

This hot sauce is a bit sweet from the ketchup, but it went well in the dip I made so no complaints from me!
