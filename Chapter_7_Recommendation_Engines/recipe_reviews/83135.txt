I used about a 5lb loin of pork and cut it into four pieces, rubbed with garlic powder, salt and pepper. Cooked on high for 5 hours, shredded it and put back in for an hour. For extra bbq flavor I added an additional 1/2 cup bottled bbq sauce to the pot after it was done. The whole family went mmmmmm after every bite! So good.

very tender and juicy!  Fell apart.  A little on the bland side, next time I will add additional items for more flavor.  Will make again.

An AMAZING recipe, except...I added balsamic vinagar, salt, pepper, oregano and 2 very large cloves of garlic run through a garlic press.  I did not put in the soda.  I then sliced up the pork and put it into a frying pan.  I then added enough B.B.Q. sauce to colour the pork.  I served immediately with additional B.B.Q. sauce.  It was AWESOME!!!!

very tasty, I shredded it with one hour left and tossed it back in to really soak up the juices.

This recipe was very tasty!  Next time, I will shred the pork and leave it in the slow cooker an extra hour so it can soak up the liquid.  Other than that, it was great.

Used a can of root beer instead. Delicious and moist. I drain most of the juices after cooking and then shred the meat and add the bbq sauce.  Served on toasted whole wheat sandwich thins with cole slaw and bean salad.  Family loves this, thanks!

this is a very easy recipe for pulled pork.  one caution is not to cook the pork too long.  i read in a bbq cookbook (dinosaur bbq) that lean pork gets really tough when it is overcooked, but that brining can help.  my boyfriend is a very "discerning" (read: picky) eater, and when he head that we were having pulled pork again, he rushed home from work!

This recipe was great! I used pork ribs instead of loin and I used a little bit more BBQ sauce than cola and a little less onion, but it was never the less amazing and flavorful. I did a dry rub before I put the meat in and I also followed the advice of others and put it back in the sauce after shredding it, its now my favorite bbq recipe!

This was okay. I followed the recipe exactly and the meat came out very tender and juicy but the taste was a little bland. Not sure what to add to give it more punch. Worcester sauce, maybe? Garlic? It was lacking something for sure.

I'm not all that fond of pork and I loved this. My husband loves shredded pork and so has had many different recipes and he loved this too! I followed the recipe, with a slightly smaller roast; only added a pinch of cumin. Delicious! We will make this over and over.

This was so super easy and delicious!  I did add a bit of Adobo spice to it just to give it a little something.. and I didn't really even measure the cola or BBQ (Sweet Baby Rays)-- I just dumped equal amounts of both on top of the loin and onions... the soupy part is the bomb!  During the last hour I slightly shredded it with a large fork and let it sit for a bit.  I will definitely make this again.

Followed recipe exactly,and shredded an hour before it was done.  Oddly dry,tough, still with liquid in the cooker.  Disappointing!  Had to muddle through but not impressed. Won't make again, sorry.
