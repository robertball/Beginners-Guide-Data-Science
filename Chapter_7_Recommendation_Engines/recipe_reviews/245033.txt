I'm sad to report that cutting in the butter by hand does not result in a workable product. It tastes good (not great but good), but it's too crumbly bc the butter didn't emulsify into tiny bits. I probably should've melted the butter into the dough when I realized my Cuisinart wasn't big enough. Can't take these to Thanksgiving, but we'll enjoy them for the tree-raising on Black Friday. Thanks for sharing! (P.S., I found these marked "Classics" in the AR magazine and was very surprised to get here and see that this recipe had never been rated. Bit misleading, had it actually been a classic I suspect someone before me would've mentioned that it doesn't work to just cut in the butter, ha!)

Good flavor and easy to make but the crust is way too crumbly.

Didn’t enjoy these. Made them for Christmas and only one got eaten. I think whoever ate the one passed the word that they weren’t very good. I’m an experienced baker and everything else I made (9 different cookies) were gobbled up. I mean they looked pretty but just weren’t that good.

These taste great! Easy to make also. They were in the dry side so I will use a little less flour next time but really good flavor. I didn’t use the cranberries because I made this after buying cranberry sauce at thanksgiving that no one liked. Crazy people liked the can of jelly type. So I heated up the Left over Ballymaloe and Muskoka sauces with a little homemade strawberry freezer jam until it was spreadable. Glad I could make use of the sauces no one wanted as they were very tasty but made with real cranberries not sugar and juice?? Anyway my husband is eating these Bars like crazy even if he wouldn’t eat the sauce at Thanksgiving.
