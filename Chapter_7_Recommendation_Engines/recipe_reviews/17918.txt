Quite simply put...wow! Left out garlic powder, because 1) it's not an authentic Italian ingredient (only fresh garlic is used in Italy) and 2) it would give an ersatz flavor. Doubled the basil and used milk for the liquid, to give a moister crumb. The result was a soft, perfectly chewy bread.  Dimpled  the dough deeply with my thumb after rolling out. Then, sprinkled the top liberally with chopped fresh rosemary leaves from the garden and lightly with coarse kosher salt, after painting with extra virgin olive oil. Then applied a mix of mozzarella, Parmigiano, and genuine imported Italian Asiago halfway through baking time so the cheese would not become overly brown. The result was ambrosia, a golden feast for the eyes and a delectable treat for the mouth. This is the real deal. Outstandingly simple and simply outstanding! To those who had trouble with the texture of the dough, either it's your yeast or your rising technique. Make sure to use only yeast that's new or that has been stored in the fridge/freezer. Also, do not dissolve in hot water, only lightly warm to the inside of your wrist. If the yeast has been stored in the freezer or is new, proofing is an unnecessary step. Proofing yeast does nothing magical like people think - it just "proves" that it's still good by bubbling. Do not allow the dough to overrise, (in other words, to rise so high that it sinks back down on itself) and ferment. Set a timer so that you don't forget to check on it. Light dough rises quickly.

I read this recipe twice and wondered how on earth the dough was supposed to rise without proofing the yeast first, and then I read the reviews and found that it has been a problem for many people who have made the focaccia.  ALWAYS proof your yeast!  Just heat the water to 110 degrees and stir in the sugar, then dissolve the yeast and let the mixture sit ten minutes or until your yeast mixture is nice and foamy.  Add the salt and oil, then your dry ingredients.  My focaccia rose beautifully, but it definitely needs some salt in the topping.  The next time I make it, I will sprinkle garlic salt before adding the mozzarella.  This is a great recipe, it just needs to be a little more clear for the cook who isn't all that familiar with bread baking.  Good luck!

Great flavor, but the directions could use some help!  I read some reviews that helped me.  I proofed my yeast with the sugar and (115 degree) water first for 10 minutes, then added the salt, oil, and herbs (using fresh basil).  Then I stirred in the flour (using one cup whole wheat flour, the rest unbleached white).  Kneaded for about 5-6 minutes, and let rise for about 40 minutes.  I then shaped the dough into a rectangle on a greased cookie sheet and let it rise for 30 more minutes.  Then I brushed on my olive oil, and sprinkled on my parmesan cheese.  Skipped the mozzarella, but I'm sure it's good that way too.  Baked at 400 for about 20 minutes.  Delicious!!!  Served with Rich and Creamy Tomaoto Basil Soup from this site, and a layered lettuce salad.  Beautiful!  I had no problems with it not rising, and it tasted light and yummy, even with the whole wheat flour.

Great tasting focaccia. Like many of the previous reviewers, I adapted the recipe for my needs. It was a hit with my family, but next time, I would add more than 1 tsp. of salt. I used 1 Tbs. (each) FRESH oregano, basil, thyme, & added rosemary. Also used 1 1/2 tsp. garlic powder, and added about 2 T. of some leftover pesto I had on hand. Placed all of this in my bread machine (dough cycle), and forgot about it. After the machine beeped, took the dough out and proceeded with the focaccia as instructed. Sprinkled cornmeal on the bottom of my baking sheet before placing dough on top, shaped, and used toppings. Sprinkled with the 2 cheeses, tomatoes, garlic, and olives. Baked in the oven at 450 F. Family devoured the whole thing! Yikes... ;o)

The herb combination is great. Use a little more salt (or sea salt) and a little less garlic powder. 

This recipe leaves two crucial things for focaccia bread.
 First, the water needs to be warm (110- 130 degrees ) when you add it to the yeast for the rise. 
 Second, after you punch down the dough, it needs to rise a second time for about 30 minutes. If you fail to let it rise again the bread will be too dense. 

It is also advisable to bake at a slightly lower temperature for longer, but the second rising of the bread will help to take care of that.

Fabulous! So delicious and easy. I added 1 tablespoon of salt instead of 1 teaspoon, sprinkled rosemary and sea salt on top of the bread and left off the mozzerella cheese. I also put a little cornmeal on the pan before putting the dough on. I served it with olive oil and balsamic vinegar to dip it in and it was just as good if not better then the focaccia bread I get from the bakery. It comes out flatter then most loaves (almost like a thick pizza crust) so you wouldn't be able to make a good sandwich unless you cut off a big piece and sliced it through the center. It would make a great pizza crust too. I can't wait to try that next time. Yum. No need to buy focaccia bread again!

This is such a great tasting, easy to make, bread!  I make the dough in the morning, then after it rises, I punch it down, throw it in a lightly floured ziploc, and put it in the refrigerator until I'm ready to make it!  It has come out great every time I've made it.  And my 2 year old loves it too! (And I even use 1 1/2 tsp. of garlic in the recipe!)

I have made this bread about 50 times and every time it comes out wonderfully!!!  It is so simple and fast and is sooooo moist and flavorful.  I like to add diced kalamata olives to the bread dough and top it with finely sliced tomatoes and grated parmesan cheese.  Today, I used it to make assorted finger sandwiches for my friends and they just couldn't get enough!  It was a beautiful presentation.  Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe!

This was the easies bread I have ever made. My children just loved it . My ten year old son didn't want to try it with the GREEN things in it but when he did he ate three pieces.
this bread is great with a salad and a glass of wine.

This made a very nice focaccia.  I have been making bread for years and I noticed some errors in the instructions.  If you are having problems it may be because you need to BLOOM the yeast in the water first.  Some others have called it proofing but when you place the yeast in water and it foams up it is blooming.  This is necessary because the yeast is in a suspended state when it is dried.  Only the "fast acting" powder yeast may be added directly to the dry ingredients. (this may have been what the author used)  After the ingredients are incorporated and kneaded you ferment (first rise),  then you punch down and do any scaling or panning (if you are making multiple products from the dough like rolls...)  after all that is done you PROOF the dough to double its size and bake it.  You will have some oven spring where it grows a little in the oven, and once it hits about 140F the yeast dies and the bread sets its shape.  good luck and don't buy any more overpriced artesian bread when you can make it yourself!!!

This bread turned out wonderful!  I let the bread machine do the work and followed the recipe from there.  I added some fresh rosemary in addition to the other herbs.  Everyone loved it!  Definately a keeper...

THE BEAT BREAD EVER. FAST, EASY AND DELICIOUS. GREAT WITH PASTA AND SAUCE THEN WIPE THE LAST FEW DROPS OF SAUCE FROM YOUR PLATE. THE ONLY CHANGE I MADE WAS TO LET THE DOUGH RISE AFTER SHAPING FOR 20 MINUTES. ALSO GREAT MADE INTO SANDWICHES. BUT THE EASIEST IS WITH OLIVE OIL AND BALSAMIC VINEAGAR TOO GOOD FOR WORDS. YOU WON'T REGRET MAKING THIS RECIPE. BUT DO DOULBE IT BECAUSE IT WON'T LAST

Easy, simple, fast, directions are spot on as far as directions go, ingredients are right on as well, however if you want more or less or wish to admit any of the spices it is very easy to do so, I used all but the Basil as my store did not have it in stock, and the bread turned out wonderfully.   If you have little or no experience with bread, this is a great recipe, easy enough to follow, with simple ingrediets, and fast enough that you will not lose interest.  As with all bread recipes, I suggest that you proof your yeast before using,since we really have no idea how old it truelly is, 1/4 cup of warm water and a teaspoon of white sugar, add yeast, stir,if it puffs up within 5 minutes it is fine to use, if not toss it out and get fresh, and I rise my bread in my microwave, I heat a cup of water in a glass measureing cup for 5 minutes or until boiling, the tuck it in the back and put my covered bread in and let it rise, it serves as a homemade proofing room, I can control, heat, and humidity during this crucial time and I always have perfect bread.  When your bread is finished let cool for 3 minutes, then bread with melted butter or olive oil and then place a dish towel overt he bread, you will always have a soft delectible crust, even your kids will eat every last crumb!

It came together SO quickly!!! I didn't have any cheese, so I rubbed on smashed garlic, salt, olive oil. Also, I did proof my yeast. Yummy!

This recipe turned out fantastic. I used suggestions from a few other reviewers. First, I proofed the yeast in warm water and sugar for about 15 minutes. Once the yeast was happily bubbly, I mixed in the other ingredients (ending with the flour). I used my Kitchen Aid mixer with the dough hook attachment to knead the dough. I transferred the dough to a plastic bowl (don't let it rise in a metal bowl - that can interfere with the yeast), coated in oil, covered, and then let it rise in my warm garage for 30 min (perfect rising temp out there in June). I punched the dough down, kneaded it again and added some sun dried tomatoes, and let the dough rise for another 30 mins. Afterward, I pushed the dough out into the pan, brushing with olive oil and sprinkling with coarsely grated sea salt. Half way through the baking, I added dried Rosemary and sprinkled with an Italian cheese blend. (The Rosemary is an absolute must.) My bread turned out puffy and light, and I'm making it again next weekend for a birthday potluck.

I gave this four stars b/c like others mentioned I think the instructions should be revised.  I proofed the yeast in water before adding the other ingredients.  After all mixed, I kneaded the dough for 7-10 minutes.  Also, I let it rise a second time (about 20 minutes) after I shaped it on the baking sheet.  And, like traditional focaccia bread, I made little wells on the top with my fingers before brushing with olive oil.  After those revisions it's pretty good, although it needs more salt.  UPDATE: I made this again and found the thyme to be overwhelming.  I would stick to one or two herbs and/or reduce the thyme by half.

Fantastic!  It did take a bit longer to rise, but it was worth the wait.  We liked it with the cheese on top.  I think next time I will put in a bit more garlic.  Otherwise, no changes needed.  This is a great recipe when you need a very quick dinner bread.

Very tasty! The spice mixture is fantastic and adds a wonderful flavour! One thing I might do next time is add the flour to a water mixture(spices, yeast, oil etc)instead of vica versa. I found the yeast was not dissolved properly which caused the dough to rise insufficently.

This is really excellent bread!  It smelled really nice when baking in the oven.  The only herb i added was basil which was enough to give the bread some really nice flavour. Anything more than basil is a bit too much. I took another readers advice and use 1 1/2 t of garlic powder. I reduced the temp time to 325 degrees as 450 was ridiculously high, but my oven might produce a bit much heat than the conventional ovens.  I preheated the oven for one hour before popping the bread in, as you do with most bread recipes.  I used baking paper in place of greased pan and took another readers advice and used garlic powder and basil so the bottom of the bread wasn't too crunchy.  Most excellent when served with olive oil and sea salt.  I let it rise for roughly 45 minutes and after all of this, the bread came out exceptional!
Definitely a winner.

I have to give this recipe only a 3, not because it wasn't good, but because it wasn't focaccia bread.  It looked similar, but tasted nothing like it.  I think it was the lack of fermenting for the yeast.  The recipe I currently use requires an overnight fermenting, which I believe gives the bread its unique flavor.  This bread was very tasty, very much like a pizza dough, which is what I plan to use it for next time.  I think it might also work well rolled into inch wide sticks for dipping in marinara as an appetizer.  While I think I'll go back to my old, time consuming focaccia recipe, I'll definitely keep this one for making pizza. (Since I wrote this I have used it for a pizza dough, and it was great.  My husband said it was the best homemade pizza I had ever made.  I've changed my rating to a 4.)

The best focaccia I've ever made.  Great with oil or just plain.  Additional suggestions: dice black olives and fold into dough just before baking.  I think next time I'll try mushrooms.  Thanks terri, you laid the groundwork for infinate focaccia possibilities.

So good! Almost better than garlic bread. I took the reviewer advise and proofed the yeast with the water and sugar then added the oil as I don't seem to have much luck baking bread without that step. The dough was a little sticky at first but smoothed out as I kneaded. I always use my microwave (not "on", of course!)to put my dough in to rise. I heated a Pyrex measuring cup of water and left it in there and placed the covered bowl with the dough in it and closed the door. It doubled in 20 minutes. The focaccia was both light and chewy. After it baked, I cut it into sticks with a pizza wheel. I am going to try the dough sans herbs and cheese to make "CinnaSticks" too. My family says thank you!

I've made this bread several times now and everyone just loves it. I use olive oil in the recipe instead of the vegetable oil and I also use wheat flour instead of the white.  Tonight I made it into a pizza and it was great.  I spread the dough out on a pizza pan and brushed it with olive oil and then spread the pizza sauce on top. I then topped it with mushrooms,red onions,green peppers,green and black olives,pineapple and topped it with mozzeralla cheese.  Very filling and it fed 4 adults easily.  It was done in about 20 min.  Very fast and easy.

Wow, I'm in love.  I don't need to know how to cook anything else.  I'll just keep making this over and over - it's that good.  I had fun with this.  I put red onion on the top, sprinkled it with sea salt, used more garlic powder and dipped it in olive oil.  SO GOOD.  I want to try it without yeast and with fresh garlic, because my favorite part was the crispy edges with lots of garlic.

Nice recipe, good flavor. Goes great with homemade soup. I will sometimes add sundried tomatoes as a topping for something a bit different.

This has got to be one of the best recipes I have ever made! It was quick, simple to make, and my son, who doesn't like to eat bread with a meal ate two pieces and then asked for another. I was even some short on the yeast but it turned out just great! Really a keeper!

This recipe was quite easy and delicious as many other reviewers state. I did follow one person's advice and I first mixed the water (warm to 115 degrees), sugar and yeast together in a bowl and let it proof for about 10 minutes to ensure that the bread would rise. This step was helpful and the focaccia did rise as a result. I also omitted the mozarella (I just didn't have any in my fridge) and so I added kosher salt and more parm cheese to the top of the bread. It was delicious. 
Also, per another review, after letting the dough rise in the bowl with oil, I shaped the dough on a silpat to prepare for baking - but I let it rise for another 20 minutes on the cookie sheet before baking. I then punched little holes into the bread (like focaccia normally has) and baked it for the 15 minutes. It was a hit!

This bread was ok.  It didn't really raise and it kind of tastes like a flavoured pizza crust.  I thought it was alright but my moms friends really liked it...

I'm not much of a bread maker without the bread machine ... this was so tasty and very easy!  It was as good or better than any restaurant.  We served it with cambozola cheese like they often do in the restaurant.  I give this a thumbs up!

I am a culinary arts student, more specifically a baking and pastry student, and my eyes scan over a lot of wonderful jump-to recipes daily. That being said, this focaccia recipe is a perfect go-to. The dry herbs need a little increase (I bumped everything to 2 tablespoons) as well as the salt (learn to taste your dry flour before adding wet ingredients to check for accuracy i.e. salt), but otherwise this recipe stands up. I sub'ed the powdered garlic for the real stuff and I tossed in some diced white onion for that boost of flavor. Top it with some grilled onions as opposed to the cheese for some low cal points and you're set to go. This bread is so good, I've made it four times this week. Bravo.

Should have read reviews first. It's been a long time since I made a yeast bread and the lack of proofing in the recipe didn't leap out at me. Didn't rise at all, obviously.  Due to this egregious error, this recipe does not deserve the near-five-star rating it has, as the recipe as written produces not bread, but a hockey puck.

Made this for hubby.  He loves this bread and I buy it for him all the time...saw this recipe and the little amount of work and thought...why not.  It turned out great.  I did let it raise a little longer than it called for.  Thanks for this easy recipe.

Just wonderful!! Everyone loves it. I make two and freeze one to have on hand. This is a real keeper!
Feb. 2010, I've been making this since I found it in 2001. Just nothing better out there than this recipe. So much you can do with it. As others have I've upped the salt and for me I have taken out the vegetable oil all together and just used a good olive oil for the whole thing. I use fresh herbs when I can or an Italian blend. I read a review about using milk instead of water, think I'll give that a try and see what happens. I've used any and all cheeses, whatever is on hand. What must be remembered is that this is a bread not a pizza (unless you are making it as a pizza) so go light on toppings, you want the wonderful flavor of the bread to come through.

I will never buy bread again!  I doubled the recipe and it turned out great!  I made this for a dinner and served it with marinara sauce and it disappeared in a matter of minutes!   A few Years later:  Yep, I'm back.  I made this bread again and took it to a dinner party.  I had to explain what it was, but after the first tentative bite, it was gone.  My neighbor asked for the recipe and couldn't believe how easy it was.  I make a marinara sauce by mixing oregano, rosemary, thyme and basil into a Hunt's pasta sauce can.

I have made this recipe 3 times within one week- my family and friends keep begging me to make it. I appreciate that it is so easy, fast and versatile. I made it into a round loaf after letting it rise once, then let it rise again. My family likes it sprinkled with kosher salt, garlic powder, & Parmesan cheese.  I also used it as a crust for homemade pizza- yum! Great alternative to traditional garlic bread!

THIS RECIPE IS PHENOMENAL!  However, I did change a few things about it. 1)  I left out the garlic.  I didn't want it to be packed with too much garlic, and I would not have used garlic powder.  I would only use fresh, finely minced garlic, if I did use it.  2) I added an Italian Herb mix ( it had a bit of mint, oregano, thyme ).  I also increased the pepper in it.   3)  I used warm milk instead of water....as milk softens the bread.     4)  I cut fresh rosemary ( 2 sprigs, without the twigs ) and infused the olive oil with them.  This was used to brush on top of the bread before going in the oven, and midway between baking time.  5) I let the dough rise for only 20 mins ( as the recipe suggested ) in a warm oven.  It makes for a fluffier, softer foccaccia.

I love love love this bread. It's so easy and SO delicious! I've probably made it about 12 times and love it every time. I sometimes use cheddar cheese if it's all I have on hand and it still turns out great. One helpful hint: yeast is very sensitive. When using it I always use wooden or plastic bowls/utensils and make sure the water is warm to ensure that it activates, if it's too cold it won't activate. However, if your water is too hot it will kill the yeast and your bread won't rise either. I've had both happen. All in all this recipe is simple and the bread will awe your guests! 

I made this again tonight using my new bread machine... I just threw all the ingredients in staring with the liquids moving to the dry ingredients, it turned out great!

Don't change a thing with this! This bread is the easiest thing I have ever made. I mix it all by hand and knead it for a few minutes. I like to work in about two tablespoons of olive oil while kneading and then put it in a happy spot to let it rise. After that, you just work it with your palms into the shape you desire and poke it with your fingers. I just brush it with olive oil and then poke it again and bake. With or without the cheese this bread is a timeless piece of tasty art!

To proof, or not to proof?  That seems to be the big question with this bread recipe.  I just made it for the first time, and I decided not to proof the yeast.  Instead, I made sure to use warm (about 110 degree) water.  The dough rose beautifully even in the short 20 minutes given in the recipe.  I did let it rise for another 20 minutes after shaping it on my greased pan.  I brushed the dough with olive oil and sprinkled kosher salt over it (I only used a tsp in the dough).  I then waited until the last five minutes of baking time to add the cheese.  I only used Parmesan, and it browned very, very quickly.  Next time I might wait until the last two minutes to add the cheese.  My five year old helped me make the bread, and neither of us could wait to taste it because it looked and smelled irresistible.  I have to say, it tastes wonderful and I can't wait to serve it to the rest of our family at dinner tonight so I can bask in their admiration.  ;)   I am already looking forward to making this again and playing around with the herbs and seasonings...roasted garlic might be a good addition!

Some of the reviews for this recipe surprise me, such as the last one.  My bread rose perfectly and was as far from a "hockey puck" as you can get.  It was light, delicious, and flavorful bread, and it doesn't matter to me whether or not traditional focaccia has milk or water if the recipe bakes up well.  I've made a number of different focaccia breads, my usual being Michael's focaccia from this site, and this was a slightly quicker, and still VERY yummy alternative, perfect for a Friday after work to serve my family with homemade soup!  I followed this to the letter, except added fresh rosemary and sea salt to the top of the bread.

Snaps for Terri! This was my first attempt at Focaccia bread & it was quite successful. Having read many reviews I was able to put together a recipe that everyone enjoyed. After the dough was on the baking sheet I let it rise another 30 minutes. After that I made wells with my finger in the dough & added crushed garlic to the  oil before brushing it on. Sprinkle with parmesan & mozzarella for a bread that rivals any bakery!

This is the best Focaccia bread recipe I've tried. I did combine the yeast with warm water & sugar first. I also let it rise again after adding all the ingredients on the top. I also add sun-dried tomatoes, black olives & fresh rosemary or basil to the top before baking. Also great dipped in olive oil & balsamic vinegar.

As many others have noted, you MUST treat this like a regular bread recipe!  Let the yeast proof in 110 degree water with sugar before mixing in all the other dry ingredients.  And, after you shape the loaf and add the toppings, you need to let it rise again for another 30 minutes before baking it.  My loaf turned out very light and soft on the inside, with a nice hard crust.  I added about 6 cloves of chopped fresh garlic to my dough.

I LOVE this bread! It is so easy, I never knew one could just whip up a focaccia like that. I have made it two days in a row now. I just used a parmesan/romano mix on top and no mozzarella to skip some of the fat and calories and the bread is still absolutely PERFECT! Thanks so much for sharing!

The focaccia is a great recipe if you lower the temperature to 425 degrees and use bread flour. Also, I used only 1/2 teaspoon of thyme because I felt the spice was too overpowering.  Next, I added a second rise for thirty minutes. Then, I  spread out the dough in a pizza shape and made wells in the dough after the second rise. I also added Roma tomatoes which was not part of the recipe.
      I baked the bread on a pizza stone.  I loosely covered the bread with heavy-duty aluminum foil for 15 minutes. Then I uncovered and baked for approximately 10 minutes.  I baked the bread for a total of 20-25 minutes instead of 15 minutes. 
     After baking, I cut the bread into strips and then cut the pieces on the diagonal. The bread was phenomenal with the changes. My son loved the focaccia. The bread is now one of my family's favorite breads. I would give this recipe a lower rating as written and a 5 with all the above changes.

The basic recipe is great so I gave this 5 stars; here are the changes I made:  I proofed the yeast before adding the yeast, water & sugar to the dry ingredients.  Used my stand mixer to mix it all up.  Increased basil to 1 tsp. and eliminated garlic powder.  Minced 3 cloves fresh garlic and let that sit in 2 T olive oil until soft and then brushed that over the top of the dough.  Added thin sliced tomatoes to the top and then sprinkled 1/4 cup fresh parmesan over the top for the last 6 minutes of baking.

I was wary because I'd only made focaccia once before several years ago and it turned out really dry. However, that was back when I first started making bread and really had no clue what I was doing so I went for it, hoped for the best, and was pretty pleased with the results. I agree with others, there's no need to proof yeast unless you aren't confident in it still being active, I had just bought mine that day so there was no need and I had no issues with rising. Anyone with new yeast who has issues with rise should keep in mind that adding liquid that's either too hot or too cold will lead to decreased rising. I ALWAYS checking the temperature of my liquid with a thermometer before adding to the yeast, usually between 110F and 130F depending on the type of yeast. Also, consider letting it rise a little before putting in the oven after punching down if you want it a little less dense. I substituted milk for the water (again, worried about dryness) and didn't have mozzarella so I just used extra parmasean. Also sprinkled rosemary, italian seasoning mix, and a tiny bit of sea salt on top. It was absolutely delicious and it seems you could add or subtract toppings and spices per your own taste. I will definitely make again, trying different variations. I did find that I had to add a little extra flour (a few tablespoons) after adding the liquid to make the dough a little less sticky. I'd say aim for a consistency like pizza dough, not regular loaf bread, and you'll be fine.

This bread is amazing and so easy to make!

I did make a few changes to this recipe though. I would suggest doubling the ammount of basil (maybe even more if you want), using milk instead of water and be sure to active the yeast (warm 1/4 cup of water to about 110 degrees, 1/4 tsp of sugar and mix the yeast up in it until it has doubled or more in size)

Also, I would add about a 1/2 tsp of salt to add to the top of the bread before it goes in the oven. Also, add the cheese on a quarter of the way through the cooking. Otherwise, it starts to burn. 

This is really good bread. I would suggest it.

This was wonderful focaccia bread.  It was very easy to make.  I made a few changes to our families liking.  I used rosemary in place of the basil because I was out and used less salt in the dough because I like to sprinkle corse salt over top.  Use an exceptional olive oil for great flavor, and, as one other reviewer mentioned garlic granules are not authentic italian and use milk instead of water.  I made one batch with fresh minced garlic and one without and they both were good!  I suppose the granules would be okay, but the bread seemed more "fine dining" without them.  This bread is very quality and impressive for dinner parties or a gourmet meal.  Make sure you know how to work with yeast so you get nice fluffy, chewy, risen bread.  Definatly will me making a lot.  Thanks for the great recipe.

Absolutely unbelievable.  I subbed milk for water, left out the garlic powder, and I added rosemary sprigs and finishing salt to the top of the bread after it had baked.  Served alongside a dish of oil, balsamic vinegar and red pepper flakes, this focaccia made an amazing appetizer.

Perfect Focacia!  I've made many other attempts and have never been happy with the results.  This recipe is wonderful!  I did have to let the bread rise for much longer than called for - perhaps 40 minutes.  I also poked holes in the top of the bread; sprinkled top with dried rosemary, drizzled olive oil over the top and then sprinkled with grated parmesan cheese.  Bread's texture was out of this world.

Agree with the majority of previous reviewers.  Great recipe, versatile, yeilds wonderful results with little effort.  Family loved CookinginFL's suggestion to make wells in bread to catch olive oil/minced garlic mixture.  Also followed other reviewers suggestions to add a little cornmeal to bottom of pan and to proof the yeast first.

I thought this was a very good bread recipe.  It did not rise like I thought it would so I may take others suggested and let the yeast, sugar and water combine for about 10 minutes (like other breads) before mixing in the other ingredients.  Other than that I was happy with this bread.  It was my first attempt at focaccia.  I will definitely make this again.

I omit the cheeses and use whatever topping I'm in the mood for on the given day. Rosemary works well. I completely ignore the instructions and make it more like the way that you would make bread. It turns out great.

This recipe is AWESOME, and also makes a fantastic pizza dough.  I just omit the cheese from the top and bake for seven minutes.  Then I add my toppings and bake until cheese is melted and it was amazing!

This is deLICious! I made the dough in the bread machine and finished it off in the oven.  Based on other reviewers' input, I increased the salt from 1tsp to 2tsp (I will not do that in the future).  Left out the thyme & did 1/2tsp oregano & 1/2tsp basil.  Used only olive oil.  Before baking, I topped it off with almost paper-thin slices of fresh tomato, some shredded mozzarella & parmesan cheeses, and also put some cornmeal on the baking sheet before laying the dough on it.  We dipped the bread in a mixture of olive oil & a really good quality balsamic vinegar with a bit of fresh minced garlic in it.  It came out great!

This bread does not rise properly if you follow the directions.  You have to proof the yeast first.  This should be fixed so others don't waste their time.  There are much better recipes for herb breads.

I took the advice of the other reviewers and dissolved the yeast in water and oil. I also preheated my oven, shut it off and then placed the bread in there to rise for about 30 minutes. The bread came out really tasty and did  not take too long to make either.

Delicious and easy!! I made a few adjustments to this recipie. I mixed the warm water, yeast and sugar together and allowed it to proof (become foamy) for 10 minutes. I then added the mixture to the dry ingredients. This will ensure that the yeast is dissolved and active. For herbs, I used one tablespoon Club House Italiano blend instead of the seperate herbs.  I also added crushed chilies. I omitted the grated cheese and used coarse sea salt to top the bread. Fantastic!! I can't wait to experiment with this recipie.

Just took this out of the oven and this recipe is a keeper! I added some hot pepper flakes to the recipe when mixing it, then topped the bread with some chopped kalamata olives before baking. I also sprinkled the top with coarse salt before baking and waited until the bread was removed from the oven before sprinkling on the Parmesan cheese (left off the mozzarella as I did not have it on hand). Thanks for this delicious, easy recipe, Terri!

Quick and wonderful!! Lots and lots of flavor! I put a pan of water underneath doing the first 15 minutes of cooking. This keep the bread really soft and from getting too crusty. I also sprinkle feta on top. Cheddar cheese and peppers are good also. One can really be created with this recipe. Next time I am going to mix sundried tomatoes into the dough. This is really a delicious recipe. It'll go good with your favorite salad, soup, or Italian recipe. Heck, it's just good all by itself! Because it was a very cold and snowy day when I made this, it took longer than 20 minutes to rise. I let mines rise until it almost double in bulk.

Easy to prepare, delicious and finishes fast :)
I made some modifications to the preparation though. The first time I prepared it, the yeast did not dissolve (you could see yeast grains in the dough), so it was a failure. Now I dissolve the yeast in warm water first and then mix everything else as in recipe. I shape it round rather than a rectagle, and let it rise that way. I also do not punch the dough down before cooking. This way it cooks puffier and softer. :)

I've made this bread for my family about six times in addition to entering it into the county fair and winning 1st place. Literally a winning recipe!
I followed the changes suggested by other reviewers and used 2 cloves of garlic in the place of garlic powder, substituted olive oil for the vegetable oil, and used milk instead of water. 
Also, I never proof the yeast and it works fine. 
When I'm going to be displaying the bread, I garnish the top with sliced red onions. Adds significant "eye appeal".

I told friends the other day I was making homemade tomato soup and a quick, easy focaccia to go with it.  I looked to see where I had gotten the recipe in case anyone wanted it.  Imagine my surprise to note that I have been using this recipe since 2002.  It's a great recipe for a side and I've been known to different herbs and cheeses on it.  It's always a hit!

I am NOT a baker. Or rather I should say I bake hockey pucks and door stops. This recipe is the exception! It was delicious and flavorful! The only changes I made were these:

- I only had Rapid Rise yeast on hand, so I used that
- I halved some of the herbs because I only had ground, not dried. If I had put in the full amount, I think it would have been too overpowering
- I allowed a second rise in the pan at the suggestion of some of the other reviewers and punched down a little with my finger tips to give it an authentic focaccia dimpled look before baking. 

It turned out fantastic! I will definitely be using it again!

After making the dough I divided it in half. The first batch, I made exactly as specified. The second batch I allowed to slowly rise to double - twice - and then a 20 minute rise in the pan. This took considerably longer but the difference in taste and texture is spectacular.

This is a very flavorful and relatively easy recipe. My only suggestion is to prep the yeast. I took the 1 cup WARM water and put the yeast in it for about 10 minutes. This activates the yeast ahead of time. Also, the suggested rise time is  inaccurate. It takes the dough about an hour to rise not 20 minutes so give yourself time. 

I added thinly sliced tomatos and rosemary to the top for extra yummy-ness. This is such a treat!

I like this quick and easy recipe.  I used juice from my crushed garlic tub instead of the powder, I also added more herbs than were called for. I found the bread to be a little doughy.  Which ultimatly caused some under cooked issues in the middle.  Perhaphs I needed to let it rise a little longer

I used this as a base for my bread, with some major modifications.  It turned out awesome, and gave this recipe the credit.  I used 1/4 tsp more salt, only a dash of garlic powder, 1 1/2 tsp of italian seasoning (oregano and thyme), 1 tsp basil, and 2 T veg oil.  I proofed the yeast in 1 c warm milk.  After it rose for 20 min, I spread it out on the baking sheet and indented with fingertips.  Brushed with melted butter instead of olive oil and a sprinkling of sea salt.  Bake at 400 for 20 min, cover if it browns to quickly.  After it's done, brush with 2 T more melted butter and sprinkle with Parmesan.  Will make again and again.  Great recipe for an hour homemade bread.

With the modifications of using milk instead of water, this was DELICIOUS! I spooned a light coating of tomato sauce on mine, sprinkled with fresh chopped rosemary and garlic, then added some shredded mozzarella in the last five minutes. Took it out of the oven and topped with chopped fresh basil and it was amazing!  Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe!

Yum.  Made it as written...but added lots of fresh rosemary, garlic, and basil to the dough.  Added sliced tomatoes to the top (brushed with olive oil) as well as a generous sprinkle of kosher salt.

Very quick annd easy recipe. I made some changes, though: I used 2 cups plain flour and 3/4 wholemeal flour I added a little extra water to compensate for the more absorbant wholemeal flour. I replaced the vegetable oil with olive oil. I added rosemary both in the dough and on top Instead of putting the grated parmesan on top, I added it to the dough. I made dimples on top of the bread with my fingers (my 2 year old helped :-) for that authentic foccacia look. I also sprinkled a little fine celtic sea salt over the top. I used instant yeast, which does not need proofing (I think that's what the recipe should call for, rather than active yeast). But I still proofed it. It gives it a little head start. Very tasty, but the flavour comes mainly from the herbs, not really from the dough which is quite normal for such a quick bread. Will make it again.

I have been making this bread for 5 years now.  What I now do is make it in the morning and let it rise all day in the fridge.  Then I punch it down, make a pizza with 1/2 and let the other 1/2 rise in the fridge for bread with dinner the next night.  This makes a great pizza dough and you don't have to add a lot of spice to your sauce cause its in the bread.

It's the best focaccia bread i've ever tasted. i use 2 tsp white sugar, and replace garlic powder, thyme, and basil with 2 tbsp freshly chopped rosemary leaves, i also replace water with milk. Before baking, i let dough rise for 10 minutes, and sprinkle it only with chopped rosemary and parmesan. This is the recipe you want to make again and again, i'll never look for another focaccia recipe, i've found the perfect one, thanks Terri!

It was hard on the outside, sticky on the inside, didnt tase very well and didnt rise after punching down the dough. No matter what you do with the yeast, it doesn't work for me. It was also way too sticky. Won't try again.

I used my bread machine to make the dough for this recipe.  It came out perfect!  It was way better than garlic bread to go with pasta.  It does have to be eaten right way while its still hot, it got really chewy and kind of hard after it cooled for a while.

I added the extra salt as other reviewers mentioned, don't do it, way to salty!  Otherwise the flavor was great, next time I will stick with the original recipe.  I also proofed the yeast (110 degree water, sugar and yeast for 10 min). Good stuff and easy too!

Very good bread Terri! After reading "bakergal's" review I realized that I totally forgot to mention the yeast proofing thing. No matter what a bread recipe says, I ALWAYS proof the yeast by pouring in warm water and the sugar. About then minutes later, it will be poofed and bubbly. Whew, I feel better now. Anyway, I used an Italian seasoning blend of the spices and Italian seasoned garlic powder. I'll be freezing this for my daughters birthday party next weekend to use for cheese fondue. Excellent and thank you!!

We made several batches of this "flat bread" on Christmas eve for all of our guests that were coming over on Christmas Day.  We paired each loaf with a tub of the Tuscan Cream Cheese Spread as gifts for everyone and it was a hit.  We made one very minor change: instead of making them into a rectangular shape, we shaped them into flat rounds.  The bread turns out very dense and the aroma in the kitchen is exquisite!  Very similar to the restaurant variety only better because you make it yourself (and can customize it by adding only the herbs you like.)  It's an excellent appetizer served with a small bowl of olive oil and balsamic vinegar for dipping or as-is with chunks of ham and aged cheese.  Simply devine with a hot bowl of tomato soup - the herb flavors in the bread enhance the tomato.  This definitely earned 5 stars!

I'm not a fan of parmesan cheese, so I left it off. I also played around a bit with the herbs, adding rosemary and oregano.

The first time I made this, I found that the oil made the lower crust too crunchy, so this time, after greasing the pan, I sprinkled on garlic powder and dried basil. It made a nice layer between the bread and the pan, and added to the taste. It's sinmply scrumptious dipped into olive oil and balsamic vinegar!

My husband ate this for days to come and this was my first attempt ever at homemade bread.  It didn't rise but I am sure that had to do with me.  Tasted just like something the pros would make.  I served it with another recipe from here called Alla Checca and it was splendid.

For those of us who don't bake bread, I was very disappointed in this recipe.  There is a similar one on this site that explains to proof the yeast and when it comes to mixing all together, you add water until the right consistency.  

The difference in the 2 is night and day!  The first doesn't rise and comes out like a thin, chewy, crackery type of bread.  The second doubles in volume and is light and fluffy, just like what I've had at Macaroni Grill before.

I'm not being critical, but please take into account not everyone knows how bread is made, just by putting the ingredients here.

I used one whole fresh garlic which is alot of cloves and minced it in my food processor, added oil and seasonings. Used whole wheat flour. Proofed yeast as reviewers suggested. Bread turned out great,sort of like the flat breads used with hummus. I salted mine out of the oven and even sprinkled some red pepper. It's the cajun in me. Delicious!

A fabulous and quick alternative to longer-rising recipes. The kicker is to make sure that the dough is left in a warm place to rise- I usually put it near the stove while it's preheating. Otherwise followed the recipe just as written and it rose nicely and baked up beautifully.

I made this tonite!  It was delicious and as previous reviewers said, it is very easy.  I had never used thyme before so I wasn't sure, only added 1/2 the called for.  I made a little bit of olive oil dip with rosemary and lemon and it was wonderful!

Simply wonderful! I do agree with other reviewers to proof the yeast. Salt deters the growth of the yeast, whereas sugar promotes it. This is why proofing is important when making yeast breads. So, I have made this several times with the original ingredients, and subsequent variations. Our favorite substitutes fresh minced garlic for the garlic powder, the addition of 1 teaspoon of crushed red pepper flakes for zip along with a ½ teaspoon of rosemary. Lastly we brush the top with lemon and oregano infused olive oil – super yummy!  Of course you can go pretty wild with this recipe, such as slices of red onion, sun dried tomatoes, fresh sprigs of your favorite herbs, etc. Great recipe as is with only the addition of proofing the yeast, as well as a jumping off point for creating other tasty variations! Thanks for sharing, it is a definite keeper!

Good, used all fresh herbs (Thyme, Basil, Rosemary) and fresh garlic. Let rise 30 minutes, then did a second rise once formed for 20 minutes. Next time I would add some sauteed mushrooms & onions on top.

For the first batch I didn't proof the yeast, and it did rise...eventually. Second batch--I dissolved the yeast & sugar in a couple ounces of the (warmed) water and let it proof while I was measuring the rest of the dry ingredients. It was already nice and foamy by the time I was ready to add the rest of the water and oil, so I didn't bother to wait the full 10 minutes. That dough rose quickly, and by the time I pulled it out of the oven, the first, non-proofed batch was finally ready to be punched down. The two results were basically identical, but since the non-proofed batch took triple the time to rise, I place my vote with the proof-your-yeast camp. I'm no chemist, but it makes sense that letting the yeast and sugar get to know each other before introducing them to the rest of the ingredients gives their process a headstart. That being said, I definitely didn't mind having two batches! The fam gobbled it right up! 2 batches x 3 people = 0 leftovers! Thanks for the recipe!

Made exactly as directed.  Good, but I found the herbs to be overwhelming - too many.  This was a quick, easy, recipe and it came together in a snap.  Next time, I think I'll scale back on the  herbs to just one or two and let it rise a second time prior to backing.  I only did the one rise and while it was good, it was a bit heavier than what I was hoping for.  Many thanks for recipe.

I'm never great at baking, but this has restored my families hope in me. They knew they were getting a light sausage pasta for dinner, but while they were distracted I was able to make this wonderful focaccia. No one had any idea why a pot of boiling water on the stove was filling the house with the aroma of herbs and garlic. Right off the bat, I'm a habitual recipe tweaker. I see a list of dried herbs, I instantly want to do everything I can to avoid it. So instead of using a bunch of stuff that smells like an ashtray, I used 1 sprig of fresh rosemary chopped up. 1 teaspoon of garlic powder just wouldn't cut it, so I used 4 cloves of garlic, minced. The pepper, I did about 10 grinds on a pepper grinder, and instead of water I actually used the juice from a can of tomatoes. I've been on a big pizza stone tangent the last few weeks, so I actually cooked my bread on the pizza stone, and it was a great choice. I preheated the stone in the oven, took it out and formed my bread directly on the hot stone (you can either chance it that your dough is oiled enough, or use corn meal to prevent sticking). Brush with oil and sprinkle salt. I held off on the cheese for 10 minutes, took the stone out, sprinkled some provolone, mozzarella, and grated some parmigiano on top. No measurements, just eyeball it and let it cook 10 minutes longer. Served with a good extra virgin olive oil and herbs for dipping.

SO Easy! I'm a serious wannabe baker but my biscuits are never flaky and my bread is usually rock hard. This recipe came out just right! Like another reviewer, I used milk instead of water and I warmed it up first. The first time I made it I actually used milk straight out of the fridge and it didn't rise at first. But even then, once I put it on top of the preheating oven it rose fine and came out perfectly. 
The only other big change I made was to use fresh herbs instead of dried and to include rosemary as well, since that's just what I think of when I think focaccia. Also, after pressing it out, you should dent it up with your knuckles (called "dotting" according to wikipedia) to keep in moisture. Also it's how they do it at bakeries.
So delicious!

Great, easy recipe!  The only changes I made were to proof the yeast as other reviewers suggested, and to use fresh herbs in place of dried.  I also left off the parmesan cheese and topped with sliced gourmet tomatoes.  I served this for breakfast with eggs and a little marinara sauce, and it was gone almost immediately!  Thanks for the excellent addition to my recipe book!

A great focaccia bread recipe, however, as others have pointed out, the directions need a little work. I proofed my yeast then mixed my dough, kneaded, and put in the oven on warm for 45 min. I put a large ramekin of water in the oven. I prepared my dough, DIMPLED it, and massaged olive oil on top. I then let it rise in the oven on warm for 20 min. I preheated the oven, sprinkled the cheese on top, and baked for 15 minutes. It came out perfect!

This is an excellent and most forgiving recipe.  Followed to a T, except I left out the garlic powder as per another reviewer.  Even with the omission, there was flavor to spare and the texture... oh, what a delight to bite into!  thank you for a helping me add a new staple to my Spaghetti dinner.

So Good! I threw all the ingredients into my bread machine. Once it was done I shaped into a rectangle, brushed with olive oil and topped with rosemary, crushed black pepper and fresh parmesan. We also like to dip into rosemary infused olive oil. Delicious!

This recipe is definitely a keeper, but only gets 4/5 stars because I had to make it twice for it to come out right.  The first time, I followed the directions as it was written.  My bread did not rise at all.  It was flat and dense... like a thick cracker, though the flavor was good.  The second time, I proofed my yeast and the bread came out wonderful!  My husband was so impressed with it... he had doubted my skills and thought I picked it up at some bakery.  I learned a valuable lesson, though: ALWAYS PROOF YOUR YEAST!

Next time we definitely will proof the yeast, as it seems that the bread was off in its rise. We substituted a dried Italian herb mix for the combo of herbs. Our mozz melted too brown for our liking but the flavor of the final product was great, save for a sprinkle of salt on top before baking. Thanks for showing us that bread doesn't have to be so intimidating to bake from scratch!

There is some confusion and debate as to whether or not the yeast should be proofed or not. The authors directions do not include this step. I try to follow a recipe exactly the first time I make it. However, reading some reviews by AR members who have experience in bread making and promote proofing "always" left me confused.  The bread itself is flavourful and great for indulging in bread dipping or for a nice pizza dough. I wish the proofing question could be addressed by our friends and advisers at all recipes.

This is a keeper! I substituted 3 tbsps of the water for sour yoghurt - and so didn't need a second rise at all. I did proof the yeast though. It would be a good idea to add the cheese halfway through baking - it tends to brown too much if you add it at the start. And as many others have said - do increase the salt a wee bit. Don't be afraid to taste the dough!

I went with the suggestion to use milk instead of water and I sprinkled coarse salt, fresh rosemary and thin slices of onion on the top.  Delcious!!

Wonderful Bread!!! Used half whole wheat flour and fresh garlic. Also let the dough rise for double the time as I wanted a higher bread...The best part of baking the recipe is my home smells just like a bakery, which is to die for!!!

I made this tonight with dinner.  It turned out great, very tasty!  It did not have the slightly tangy flavor that many focaccia breads have, which is the reason for the 4 instead of 5.  However I will make this again and next time use a more piquant cheese such as romano, or perhaps a blend including asiago.  I will also use shredded vs. grated.  I used an electric stand mixer.  Prior to baking I dimpled the surface and sprinkled on 4 cloves worth of minced fresh garlic, then drizzled on the olive oil and spread it around using a pastry brush. I baked it on a pizza stone for 10 minutes, then added the mozzarella.  The crust browned nicely and the herbs and garlic complemented the cheeses and olive oil quite nicely.  Even with the couple extra steps, I had this ready in less than an hour.  Family loved it.  Thanks for the easy recipe!

I'm just learning to cook bread, and this was good, but mine was kind of hard.  I put it on a cookie sheet since I wanted to make sandwiches, but I think next time I'll put it in a smaller pan so it will be softer and I can slice down the middle for sandwhiches.  Cheese sounded like a lot to me, so I cut by 1/4 cup, and I could have reduced cheese further. Excellent starter to play with - Thanks!!

This was great! I am new to using yeast so I wanted to start with something pretty easy. It turned out perfect and yummy! I made it two times once mixing in the yeast dry and once proofing it before I mixed it in. Both times it turned out exactly the same. Thanks for such a great recipe!

Delicious! I'd say "watch the timing!" as I managed to "over-ahem-crisp" the crust in places, so I might pull the temp back a bit next time. But there WILL be a next time! (This was delicious with caramelized onions & roasted garlic kneaded into the dough.)

I made this in my bread machine on the dough cycle. My husband and I tested it before dinner and half of it was gone in minutes. He says "keep this recipe!" I followed the recommendations of Baricat (thanks!) and used milk as the liquid, omitted the garlic, doubled the basil, and sprinkled with cheese half way through baking. I added a little romano cheese to the mozarella, parmesan mix which gave a beautiful golden brown color. I didn't have fresh basil for the top, but delicious none the less.

I made this bread to dip with olive oil and balsamic vinegar.  It was delicious, but I liked it served at room temperature instead of warm, it changed the density of the bread.  I messed up a bit by trying to reshape after I punched it down, it made for some weird layering of the dough, so make sure you just flatten it after punching down.  Overall was delicious!

Great recipe!  I add kosher salt, fresh rosemary and shredded parmesan cheese on top before baking.  I will sometimes make several small loaves and use them to make panini sandwiches.

This bread is awesome! you can mix the dry ahead throw it in a zip-lock and add the wet when you are in a hurry to make something filling and delicious w/o the rise times of regular breads. You can put whatever you want on the top and experiment if you like but its great the way it is. I have sliced this in half and added ham, mayo, or made grilled cheese with it as well. Nothing to complain about this is for sure. And smells great while baking.

I made this for my son's birthday dinner to accompany his favorite veggie soup.  It was a huge hit and super easy.  
The only thing I did different is that I put the yeast in the cup of warm water with the sugar and let it sit for about 5 minutes to activate the yeast.  
It was really fabulous!

Simplified the herbs, and added some balsamic vinegar and tomatoes, green onion, fresh garlic, and shredded Parmesan to the top.  Yum!  I also proofed the yeast in warm water with sugar for ten minutes.  When letting the dough rise, I let it go first for 40 minutes instead of 20, then flattened and shaped it into a rectangle AND poked dimples into it with my finger before letting it rise for 20 minutes more prior to baking.  I substituted 3/4 cup whole wheat flour for some of the flour and it still turned out deliciously light and fluffy- thank you for the recipe!

mmmm this was SO good! i made the dough in the bread machine and only had marble cheese in the house so i used that instead of the mozerella. It was still so good and so easy! i will definatly make it again! UPDATE: i made this again but added half a teaspoon more yeast. Ths allowed the bread to rise a little more and get a little thicker but it still kept the right texture of typical focassia bread. EXCELLENT. This is how i will make it from now on.

I love this recipe because of the ease in making and the great taste. I have past this along to my best friend who is not a
baker and she can't stop making it. I am now sending it to my 14 and 10 yr old nieces. I get lazy and just use Italian 
seasonings. My friend and I bake it as a loaf and use it for dipping in olive oil.
yummy.

This bread is NO JOKE! I made it with Whole Wheat flour and it was just outstanding! My husband and I flipped for it. It does have alot of cheese on top but it is just very yummy. The bread it not too thick or thin either. WOW! I will make it again.

This is now my favorite focaccia recipe! The only change I made was using my thumb to make small "wells/dents" in the dough before cooking and filling with olive oil. I have done this in the past with other focaccia recipes and really liked it. It helps to "lock in some flavor." Another thing to try: garnish with some fresh rosemary for an added touch.

Very good bread...proofed one packet of active yeast, added spices, roasted garlic and parm. cheese directly to dough.  Then added more garlic and a parm. cheese to top.  Slightly bland but I think I did not add enough garlic to the top, we like alot of garlic.  Served with roasted garlic potato soup and a salad for a lighter meal.

This is by far the best recipe for focaccia!!! I did proof the yeast prior to mixing in my bread machine and added extra rosemary, basil, fresh garlic and parm cheese to the dough. I'm sure this is going to also make an awesome pizza dough when I make it again this weekend.   Thanks for the recipe!

My family devoured this bread.  I mixed the dough in the food processor,omitted the garlic powder and mozzarella, used olive oil in the dough. I know I will make this often.  4 stars because it should be made clear in the instructions to use instant, quick-rise yeast rather than traditional, which would need to be proofed separately before proceeding with the recipe.

I thought this was just average.  I added more yeast and like others, it did NOT raise.  It was more like an herbed hockey puck.  It didn't resemble the kind of focaccia I am used to.  I let it raise a very long time and still no luck.  I don't know if it was as a result of doing the dough in the bread machine or what.

I just made this bread.  It just came out of the oven and I had some.  It is awesome bread.  It cooked a lot longer than 15 minutes in my oven and I'm still not so sure it was completely cooked.  Maybe I didn't thin it out enough. 
As I was reading the reviews I noticed everybody complained about it rising so I decided to try something different.  I followed the recipe as is and used the oven as my warm place.  I put the bread in a metal bowl, used the damp towel, and just turned my oven on for a bit to create that warm environment.  I had it at less than 200 degrees for less than 5  minutes.  It was just enough to warm the oven and create that moist environment.  The bread rose beautifully.  Took a little longer than 20 minutes, but it worked great.  I'll let you know how it tastes in a while!  Going to make the Creamy Garlic Chicken from this site to go with it.
BTW...I topped my bread with olive oil, garlic salt, italian seasoning,  parmesan and mozerella cheeses.

This recipe makes the softest, most delicious Focaccia bread ever. I always leave out the thyme, which I feel gives the bread an overpowering flavor. Also, do not add any extra flour to this recipe when you knead it. The bread will not be so soft if you do. Any stickiness goes away after you knead it 5-8 minutes.

Wow this is some impressive focaccia! This is my first attempt at making bread, and it came out really well. I dissolved the yeast into warm water and sugar first, then mixed it into everything else. I added rosemary and mixed some parmesan into the bread. I also let the dough rise an extra 10 min after I patted it down into the pan. I really loved how crunchy the crust is and how soft and moist the inside is. Next time, though, I'm going to up the quantity of spices and use fresh garlic instead of powdered. Cheers!

Edit: I just used this as a crust for spinach ricotta pizza, and WOW. It is GOOD! I just spread the dough out to cover the entire pan. I brushed the bread with garlic and oil, and then prebaked for 10 min. I then pulled it out and put mozarella, spinach, dollops of ricotta, more mozarella and lots of parmesan. Baked it another 5-6 min and wow. I'm thrilled.

very good. I also sprinkled a bit of coarse ground sea salt on top with the cheese which really brought out the flavors.

Thanks to all the reviews, here's what I got as my focaccia. Added fresh pounded garlic, no thyme but rosemary and upped the rest of herbs and spices, also sprinkles of hot chilli powder, together with a handful each of fresh grated parmesan and 3 cheese mix - all into the dough. Used olive oil in dough too. First rise 30 minutes, punch down and spread dough in 15x10 pan, rest another 10 minutes, then finger poked holes and brush olive oil and spread some coarse salt and a bit more rosemary on top. Easy, moist, crusty, yet slightly chewy cheesy tasty saltish bread; hubby gonna dunk in olive oil and also have it with creamy mushroom soup. Such a good recipe with loads of possibilities. Thanks much Terri, good one.

I have made this several times as well as made other focaccia bread recipes from this site and this one is my favorite.  I love the addition of of the herbs and garlic to the bread dough, although I do recommend adding fresh garlic or even some of the chopped jarred garlic in place of the garlic powder if you can.  

I made this to go with a lemon-spinach pasta recipe of mine and it was a wonderful, flavorful accompaniment.  I am looking forward to making a sandwich out of this bread as well.  I think chopped sundried tomatoes would be wonderful mixed in the dough as another poster suggested.

This was my first try at making bread.  To my surprise, it was much easier than I thought.  I followed the recipe exactly - next time I would increase the herbs.  I would have like more flavor.

This was really good.  Much better than the commercial focaccia breads.  I added fresh herbs from the garden (parsley, sage, rosemary and... basil) to the yeast during the final stages of my bread machine's mixing cycle.  I also used fresh garlic, rather than dried.  I used the baked bread with another terrific recipe on this site, Grilled Mediterranean Vegetable Sandwich.  Next time, I'm going to add a couple tablespoons of flax seed meal to the bread dough.  It helps reduce built up cholesterol in the blood vessels.

POSITIVELY YUMMY!  I used my bread machine to make the dough, then formed it into a pizza crust, oiled and cheesed it and pre-baked it, then added cheese, barbeque sauce sweetened with brown sugar and chunks of cooked chicken.  My husband had to have it two nights in a row!  The neighbors raved!  I also made this recipe up as a loaf in the bread machine and it makes delicious sandwiches. The bread machine loaf comes out best if you open the machine when the baking is about to start, brush with oil and dust with parmesan cheese.  We made the first few with peanut oil because we didn't have olive oil and it was scrumptious.  Every variation I have tried has been wonderful!

This was my second "real" attempt at homemade bread and it turned out well.  I was expecting a little more of an airy textured focaccia...like the ones at the deli, but this was still enjoyed by my crew.  I added a tsp of onion powder and a little more of every spice except the basil.  I also threw in some rosemary and parsley.  I forgot to brush the top with olive oil before I put it in the oven so the top was a little dry when I took it out.  I just whipped up a batch of garlic butter and brushed that on top before I served it.  Yummy.  Thanks for sharing Terri.

This was a good bread recipe.  Very easy and quick to prepare and it tasted great.  I did not add mozzarella cheese, but added some coarse salt and the parmesan cheese and it was great.  Of course, we dipped in olive oil just like the italian restaurants and it was fabulous.

Wonderful bread!  However, I am merely an amatuer cook and do not know all the nuances of cooking.  When I made this the first time I did not know the water needed to be warm.  Perhaps that would be a good detail to add to the recipie?  I had to wait quite a bit longer than 20 minutes for the yeast to activate and the dough to rise.  But when it was all over it was very tasty! Thanks!

Something isnt right with this recipe. I followed the instructions to a T and it turned out flat and uncooked on the inside and crusty on the outside, the first time. So I tried it again...with the same results. This isnt how fresh baked foccacia should taste.

I reduced the oregano,tyme, and basil by 1/2 and left everything else the same.This bread is so versatile, you can change spices to make it go better with types of foods. I even make a sweet cinnamon and brown sugar version.

This turned out really well.  I used the bread maker to make the dough and then just patted it into a jelly roll pan to bake.  I did have to omit the garlic due to an allergy, but I used onion powder instead and it worked well.  This is definitely a keeper.

I have been making this for several years.  As is, this recipe is fabulous.  I have tried it with milk as suggested in one comment.  This turns out great either way.

I like to top this bread with sun dried tomatoes, spinach, artichoke hearts, olives and any cheese that I have on hand.  But it is just as good with a little olive oil and some additional herbs with a little finely grated parmigiano reggiano.

no mozza, shredded parm instead. Try with minced garlic on top next time. Mix yeast with 110-degree water and sugar for 10 minutes, then add to dry ingredients. Add a second rising for 20 minutes after spreading into rectangles

Great recipe!  This was easy to make and produced a nice amount of really delicious focaccia bread.  I didn't even know that focaccia was something I could make at home, let alone make so easily.  In case it helps to know, I did not proof the yeast and I had only a "jack blend" of cheese for the top.  I also used fresh herbs!

I never realized you could whip up focaccia so quickly!  I'm not a bread baker, but thought I remembered reading somewhere about needing warm but not hot water so the yeast would work...so I just winged it and used warm tap water when adding all the ingredients.  BUT thank goodness I read the reviews during the 20 minute rise cycle...as others recommended, the warm water IS important, and it seemed many readers suggested a second rise cycle.  So, I guess I lucked out on the water, then after the first rise, I did punch it down, form it, then let it rise again for another 30 minutes.  Even with the extra rise, it still only took just over an hour.  I used 2 cups of regular unbleached flour and 3/4 cup whole wheat flour. I didn't have any mozzarella, so I used 3/4 cup freshly grated Romano cheese on top and added some sliced Calamata olives.  FA-BU-LOUS !!

I've made this recipe probably 4-5 times now and every time it is perfect!  I make it to go with a great tomato-basil Parmesan soup.  We dip the bread into the soup and it's fantastic!  I've not needed to proof my yeast, my bread always rises fine (of course my yeast is still fairly fresh). I just make sure the water is warm when I add it.  I also add extra herbs and cheese to the top, to suit my family's taste.

great bread with interesting taste, texture, and a wide variety of use possibilities. I gave the rise time more time-- about double and I sprinkled sea salt with the cheese on the top. This is a great bread for just eating or for use with any number of grilled sandwiches and I plan on trying it as a pizza crust in the future as well--- Thanks Terri.

Something about the dough wasn't right.  It never rose before I baked it, and it was too think after baking.  It had a great taste and smelled wonderful, but it just didn't have the right texture for bread.

Really really good!!!!  It really is as good as all the reviews say.  I made it pretty much as the recipe reads, except that I used milk in place of the water (warmed slightly in the microwave first).  I found it was a little too sticky, so I added a little bit more flour to get it to be a smooth dough, but I might not have measured the flour quite exactly the first time. (no one else mentions this as a problem) I let it rise a little longer than 20 minutes, but my kitchen was cool.  There is no need to proof the yeast.  works fine without doing this.  I also let it rise a 2nd time after placing it on the pan.  This is just standard yeast dough practice.  I will definitely make it again!  Next time I will probably use a little less dried herbs, just because my husband thought it was a little strong.  I also might try cooking it in a cast iron skillet  preheated with a little oil in the pan.  If anyone likes the cheese dippers from Mazzios in Oklahoma we think cooking it in cast iron would make it taste almost exactly like them.  Yummy!!!!

I like the herb combo in this so 3 stars. The first time I followed exactly and it came out flat with a very, dense, cake like texture but still tasty. Second time I proofed my yeast with warm water first, then added the herbs and other ingredients. Let rise to double, punched down and after putting in final baking pan I tried to let it rise again (with no success I might add). I topped it with fresh Parmesan cheese only and a little extra sea salt (personal preference). It was good but the bread was still  too flat and dense even the second time around. I'll keep the herb combo and look for another bread recipe. ;-)

This bread did not last an hour, nor did it have time to get cold. As a matter of fact, I think it didn't even last 30 minutes. Everyone loved it.

Bread is tasty, but as some others mentioned I think it needs a bit more salt, although some of my guests thought it was fine as is. I used the ingredients as written, but prepared it the traditional way of dissolving the yeast in the water.  Once the bread was prepared, I let it rise for a couple of hours before baking. It turned out well. I did not use the full amount of flour as called for and next time will not use more than 2 cups. I think this will help solve some of the denseness issues.

I read the reviews and made some adjustments to the recipe.  I put the sugar in with the warm water, let the sugar dissolve and then added the yeast.  I let it set for about 15 minutes so the yeast could bubble and foam.

I used 3 teaspoons of salt instead of 1 teaspoons since some reviews said it needed more salt.  I cut the oregano, thyme and garlic to 1/2 teaspoon each. Other than that I followed the directions.

The focaccia bread came out very good but, next time I'll only use 2 teaspoons of salt.  Also I plan to bake the bread for about 10 minutes without the cheeses, then add the Parmesan and Mozzarella cheese and continue baking for another 5 to 10 minutes.  The cheese on my bread ended up too brown.

While baking the bread, it made my kitchen smell like a pizza was baking.  :-)

This bread is pretty good.  I would have rated it 4 1/2 stars if I could because the bread is a little too dense.  Sometimes it gets a little undercooked, but overall it is great!  Not sure what I can really do about the denseness, so I might try a new recipe next time.

Awesome!  I did make a few changes though.  First off, as another reviewer noted, it's important to proof your yeast before everything else, in case your yeast is dead, that way you don't have to go through the trouble and find out it's not going to rise properly.  For the toppings, I used butter mixed with minced garlic instead of olive oil, Parmesan, and then left out the mozzarella (I just don't have any or else I might have tried it).  Great flavor!!  I'm pretty sure my husband is going to love it.  Thanks!

I made this to eat with seafood stuffed shells and it was the perfect herby partner.  I followed the recipe exactly except the baking method - I made the bread in an oiled cast iron pan.   Since there were only three of us for dinner, I plan to use the remaining bread for sandwiches today.

YUM.  Didn't change anything, except to proof the yeast first.  Let it rise 20 mins, punched down, shaped  on the stone, baked for 15 min. Perfect, and so easy!

Amazing! I tripled the batch - the first one just came out of the oven. I left out the garlic powder as one reviewer suggested and put minced garlic on top instead. The bread is perfect - crispy on the outside and light and chewy inside.

This was a big hit! I proofed the yeast in warm milk (not water) with the sugar and after about 10 minutes added it to the flour mixture. I used 3/4 c. whole wheat flour and olive oil instead of vegetable. I let it rise, punched it down, shaped it, and let it rise again. I sprayed it with olive oil and grated Parmesan cheese over it. It was done in 10 minutes. Delicious! 
It also works well as a pizza crust.

Soft and moist - there weren't even crumbs, the bread stuck together so well.  I decided to make this last minute and altered the ingredients to fit what I had on hand.  

I put all the dry ingredients in the food processor, doubleing the basil and omitting the garlic powder.  I used whole milk instead of water and warmed it in the microwave until 110 degrees Farenheit.  I added the oil to the milk and poured it all into the food processor while it was mixing.  I was really worried about not proofing the yeast, but it all turned out great anyway.

More changes to the recipe: I let the bread rise for 10 minutes after I put it on the baking pan.  I didn't have the cheese the recipe called for, so halfway through the baking process, I pulled out the bread and topped it with sauteed onion, garlic powder, and a light sprinkling of cheddar cheese.

The herbs, garlic, and onion made eating this bread a sensory experience.  The texture was perfect.  I'll definitely make this again, especially because it was less than an hour start to finish.

Comment about proofing yeast.  Not all yeast needs to be proofed in water first. Instant dry yeast is usually added directly to flour and dough rises fine without proofing.

I used the bread machine to make this foccacia.  It was really easy and turned out fabulously.  I used the foccaccia to make Grilled Vegetable sandwiches.  The bread was perfect!  I can't wait to use the bread in other ways soon.

Awesome Bread! I like to use this for pizza dough. Cut the dough ball in half before you knead and let it rise as two dough balls... then press really thin, but let it rise again for at least 15 - 20 minutes and after it rises, put your toppings on and bake as stated in recipe... It is delicious!

This turned out great! The texture of this bread is perfect; even hubby commented on it. I proofed my yeast with the warm water and sugar for 10 minutes, then mixed in the remaining ingredients. Did all the mixing and kneading in my Kitchenaid with the dough hook, then let rise for 30 minutes. I sprinkled a baking sheet with cornmeal, shaped the bread, rubbed with olive oil and sprinkled with a garlic/parsley/sea salt/parmesan mixture. I let the bread rise again while the oven was heating, then baked at 450 for about 12 minutes. Perfect!!

Great bread.  I made some changes to make it my own.  Used 1 1/2 cups white flour, 1 cup wheat flour and 3/4 cups flaxseed meal.  I proofed the yeast in 1 cup of warm water and 1 table sugar.  I added dried thyme from last year's garden and roasted garlic paste I made by by dry roasting about four cloves of garlic in a saute pan.  I omitted salt and other herbs and used olive oil in place of the veggie oil.  I did have to add about 1/4 cup more water.  Once risen and formed on the oiled pan, I poked the top, then spread with about a tablespoon of pesto sause.  I sprinkled with course sea salt and baked.  Came out great!

This bread turned out awesome.  I used it to make BLTA sandwiches for dinner and so I formed a longer and more oblong loaf.  It rose up just right for a nice hearty sandwich.  This will definitely be my quick go-to side bread and sandwich bread recipe.

So easy! I made this on a trial run and my husband was so impressed. I made it again a few days later when company came over and they kept asking where to buy it. I told them that I made it and they asked where they could get the kit. I felt pretty good about them thinking it was store bought. Will use this recipe over and over. It is delicious as is, but I think that I will try mixing it up so that I don't become a one trick bread maker. Thanks for this recipe!

I love this bread! I have made it many times. I usually use 1/2 bread (or A/P) flour and 1/2 whole white wheat flour. I also usually add a touch of honey.
I like that this can be made so quickly, but I've also made it earlier and let it rise a few times, and it was good like that too. I prefer baking this at 425 for 15 minutes, it gets nice & golden, but stays soft.
My children really love this bread as well. Thanks for sharing!

This is practically foolproof. I've made it five times already. The first time, I followed the recipe exactly. In subsequent bakings, I've played around with adding various spices and herbs (thyme, oregano, parsley, etc.) I do leave out the mozzarella because I don't think it's necessary. After baking, I also like to brush the focaccia with olive oil and sprinkle it with fresh sea salt. It's not necessary, but it does bring it from really good to nearly divine!

Excellent.  This will not let you down.  I did not use the mozzarella.  I do wish I would have used a little more salt in the dough.  Wonderful!

Thank you for saving my dinner! I had a recipe all picked out and put it in my bread machine only to find out that the dough cycle would be 2 hours... I had to be at dinner with the bread in 1.5 hrs. I isprinkled it with parmesan cheese (powdered, it's all I had) and mozza. Served with lasagna. It was great!

Awesome recipe. Used minced garlic instead of powder. No need to proof the yeast... you don't need to do that for focaccia.  That is part of what gives it the texture.

My family loved it and I followed one of the readers instructions and used milk instead of water. I used olive oil also. I put garlic,cheeses on the end of baking (bout 5 min before it's done. Yumm!

This was my first time to make bread without the “ol’ reliable” bread machine.  This turned out GREAT!  I’m glad I “proofed” my yeast because it ended up that my yeast was old and not good.  I went back to the store and got some new/ fresh yeast and so glad I did as the recipe was VERY GOOD!!  My Italian hubby said “honey, this is the best bread you have ever made”.  I finally told him it was my first one w/o the bread maker.  My kids really liked the bread too.  The only thing that I changed was to use milk not water and added the motz. Cheese the last 7 minutes of baking.  Thanks for such and great bread recipe and I look forward to my new world of fresh bread making!

Wonderful! Have tried several other recipes for focaccia and this by far is my favorite! Made exactly as written for the exception of asagio instead of parm on the top. Yummy!  Even for the inexperienced bread maker, this recipe is a no fail option! I will be making again this weekend for pizza crust. Thanks for posting!

My 11 year old son is our official breadmaker and this is the recipe he loves to make. The only changes he makes is he will sprinkle garlic, rosemary, and a little kosher salt on top of bread before baking. Every one loves this recipe and it sure puts a smile on his face to get rave reviews from our guests. Wonderful recipe!

Delicious! Skipped the mozzarella and just sprinkled fresh rosemary, parmesan and a drizzle of olive oil on top.  Smelled great baking in the oven too. Next time I'm going to try some chopped sun-dried tomatoes and mozzarella.

Exactly like a hockey puck. Flat, too many herbs, just not like a focaccia should be like. I'm totally surprised by the reviews because traditional focaccia usually has milk for the liquid.

Absolutely wonderful!  I have made this about a hundred times!  I always get perfect results.  It is also wonderful as a pizza crust (done in one hour!). I just use a large jellyroll pan and press it out to the sides.  I bake it for 5 minutes and then I top it with pizza sauce, veggies and cheese.

This is my new default recipe for dinner when I don't know what to cook...it's that easy.  You can put anything you have in the fridge on top.  This and a salad is a meal...or, in winter, this and soup is a meal.  I use Italian seasonings instead of all the individual ones, I make 1 cup of the flour whole wheat, and I use garlic salt instead of regular.  Oh..and I add cheese(s) during the last 10-15 minutes of cooking because it will overcook...not into crunchy cheese.  All my friends have asked for this recipe and they're getting rave reviews, too.

My only regret with this recipe is not making two batches. I prepared the dough as the recipe directed and had no problems with it rising. I used a roasted garlic oil instead of olive oil and I topped the dough with a mixture of parmesan, cheddar, and mozzerella cheeses. The bread turned out cheesey and garlicky with crisp edges. I was surprised at how easy it was to make. This recipe just made my permenant files.

An excellent recipe indeed. After reading a few of the reviews, I will remind everyone again that you must proof the yeast (ie. warm up the water and add sugar then slowly stir in the yeast - so that it doesn't clump) before adding the rest of the ingredients. Overall a great recipe, though just a touch bland, maybe a bit more salt next time I bake it.

Really good and easy to make. Placed in my bread maker per manufacturer rec. and used the dough cycle. It came out perfect and then placed on cookie sheet. I sprinkled with garlic salt and cheese per recipe. I baked and sliced horizontally stuffed c chicken, peppers, provolone cheese then placed on george forman grill. Wonderful

I had never made focaccia before and wanted to try it.  I was very surprised at how easy and fast it was, I followed the instructions and had no problems with it rising.  In the future I will leave out the basil until when I have access to fresh, though.  I can see this as a starting point to many different variations.

This was extremely easy to make.  I didn't read the other reviews and therefore didn't proof the yeast.  So after 20 minutes it had yet to rise.  So I set my bowl on the  pen oven door, cranked up the heat, and let it rise for about an hour (oven safe bowl of course and continuous monitoring for safety).  The next time I make this bread I will proof the yeast and cut down on the number of herbs.  I'd rather concentrate on a the flavor of a few rather than many.  Probably will use rosemary.  And on the second try I used rosemary and fresh garlic. It was so much better!

This was delicious and easy!  I did proof my yeast, but it very well may work without it.  (Water should be about 125 degrees if you are trying that)  I used olive oil in the dough rather than vegetable oil and did not add mozzerella (none on hand)  Looking forward to using the leftovers for sandwiches.

Very herb-y.  It really is only good fresh out of the oven.  But what bread isn't best that way?

This was very good. I made as directed except I left off the mozzarella cheese and added fresh chopped rosemary from my garden and a sprinkle of Kosher salt. The inside was nice and fluffy. We dipped it in olive oil and balsamic vinegar

I made this into a pizza crust.  I took other reviewers suggestions and used milk instead of water and real garlic in place of the granules. I also used 1/4 cup fresh basil chopped finely instead of the dried variety.  Pizza toppings were olive oil, fresh basil, sliced tomatoes, fresh mozzarella and a light sprinkling of oregano. Everyone raved about it.  One suggestion - cut back the salt to 1/4 tsp.

Very good!! I used fresh herbs (1 tbsp each) and fresh garlic (3 cloves).  Proofed the yeast as others suggested and then added the salt, olive oil, and remaining dough ingredients.  The dough hook on my kitchen aid made kneading a breeze.  Topped with sea salt and about 1/4 cup parmesan cheese (no mozz).  Quick and so tasty!

This recipe is very good.  I like to put sliced tomatoes and green onions on top under the cheese.  It's also a great bread for making calzones.  Fantastic!

This was delicious! I halved it, as there were only 4 of us eating, and I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil inside, to be healthier. It was really scrumptious! Certainly a repeat.

Awesome! Very easy to make, I throw everything into the bread machine on dough cycle and then bake it on my pizza stone. Kids love it! Reminds us of a local pizza shop's crusts- going to try that later this week!

Really really good!!!  I used half whole wheat flour for the recipe, just added a tablespoon more water.  It actually gives it a better flavor than just the plain white flour.  I also added 1/2 tsp rosemary to the recipe, and 1/2 cup freshly shredded parmesan to the dough.
My husband nearly ate the whole thing by himself.

This is a bit different from traditional focaccia, but if you want something fast & easy that a 3 year old will devoure this is it!  We loved this, expecially the cheese on top.  It's going to become a regular at our house.

This was exactly what I was looking for. I needed a simple focaccia for grilled panini's and this recipe was perfect. I only used only 1 1/2 tsp of italian seasonings instead of all of the herbs but I still used the garlic powder. It came out perfect and so easy. Thank you!!!

This is a family favorite!  We eat this instead of pizza.  I have topped it with a mild ajvar added feta cheese, olives, onions and mushrooms.  I  subsitute whole wheat flour for a much healthier version.

Absolutely fantastic!  I made it once as is, and then again as a pizza crust.  I omitted the mozzarella and baked it about seven minutes, added sauce, Italian blend shreded cheese, shredded Mozzarella, scrambled sausage, sliced olives, sliced mushrooms, and finished with more of the 2 cheeses.  I baked it again until the cheese melted and started to brown.  My boyfriend thinks it's much better than the pizza we order!

What a recipe! I used the Dough cycle in the bread machine. Then I put parchment paper on the baking sheet, put generous amounts of yellow corn meal, and shaped the dough into a circle. 1 T of oil was plenty for brushing, and I topped it off with rosemary needles, tomato slices, garlic slices, sea salt and grated parmesan. It smelled beautiful while it was in the oven, and when it came out, it looked absolutely wonderful! My family said it looked like a professional bakery-quality bread! Will definitely make again, especially to potlucks and parties!

It may be unnecessary to add my two cents as it's already a 5-star recipe, but WOW! I just took this out of the oven and it is absolutely delightful. I sprinkled more spice on top and substituted the bit of vegetable oil with olive oil. I also used 1 1/4 cups of wheat flour and the rest white. Amazing! THANK YOU!

I really wanted to like this recipe!  I substituted whole wheat flour and it came out pretty dry.  This is even after adding more water!  I think it has a good foundation but needs some tweaking.

Attempt 2 (3 yrs later): This time I did use fresh herbs and fresh garlic, and pretty much just guessed on those quantities. I proofed the yeast as recommended, and also used milk as my liquid. The flavor was MUCH better, more pronounced, with the fresh herbs. Next time I think I'll add a little more salt and more cheese, too.  Attempt 1 (July 2006): A good bread. Not too dry, but I feel like it needs more flavor. Next time I'll have to use fresh herbs. I did use crushed garlic this time, rather than dried. I'll have to add more next time. I proofed the yeast first like others recommended. I used King Arthur's white whole wheat flour. I added rosemary on top like some suggested. I think I was too skimpy on the cheese (I didn't measure it out), though. With fresh herbs, I think it'll become a new favorite of mine. Thank you!

Mmm.. lots of flavor packed into a thin piece of bread. Goes great with cream sauce pastas as well as dipped in balsamic vinegar/olive oil. ****UPDATE*** I made this as pizza dough (Thanks to the previous comment for the idea!) I made delicious leftover pizza! Rolled dough out thin, poked a few holes, baked for 15 minutes, then topped with pizza sauce (tomato paste, water, spices) and with sauteed mushrooms, onions, garlic, and a few marinated artichoke hearts. Then topped it all with mozzarella and baked until cheese melted. Yummy! Thanks for the versatile recipe.

This bread was fantastic! I doubled the oregano and basil. I halved the garlic powder and added 3 large cloves of fresh garlic. Instead of using veg. oil, I used olive oil. Like everyone else has suggested, make sure you proof your yeast with the warm water (no more than 110*), and sugar, for 10 min. This recipe was so easy, and soooo delicious! Even my kids loved it! Will definately make again! :o)

This was beyond yummy...I had a girls night at my house and thought this would be a nice start to our meal, I followed the directions exactly except I minced some garlic and spread it on top while it was baking b/c I love fresh garlic.  I served it with some balsamic vinegar for dipping and the bread disappeared!  I will make again for sure!

great recipe! i LOVE that texture! i used 1 tbs of salt instead of 1 tsp as someone mentioned that the bread wasn't salty enough. As for the herbs, i just threw in what i had on hand. Some rosemary, thyme, caraway, tiny pinch of cayenne. i also proofed the dough twice. Once in the bowl until doubled and then another time in the pan till the focaccia reached the top of the pan. It rose some in the oven. lovely bread, thanks!

The whole family loved the bread, they all said the herbs in it makes it taste extremely good. The aroma from the bread fills the house with such a great smell of herbs.

There is something truly special in making your own bread, from your own hands...I am just learning, and this was no exception!  I did activate my yeast in a half a cup of warm water with a tsp. of sugar before I added it.  The recipe wasn't real clear on that, and I am no expert, but it seemed logical…and it turned out fine.  I used herbs that I happen to have on hand and didn’t want to go bad, like fresh thyme and basil, and added some roasted minced garlic into the bread mixture (you can never have too much garlic in my opinion)!  I topped the focaccia bread off with some grated fresh mozzarella and parmigiano reggiano cheeses.  It was fabulous served with a glass of white wine, assorted cheese, and some fresh fruit!

Great bread! Has lots of great flavors! I added parsley, chives and sun dried tomoatoes. I didn't have dried thyme or oregano, so just used ground and it still turned out great! Great warm with butter! Yummy!

This was still really good, even though I over oiled mine and it didn't rise very well. Despite its dense texture, we couldn't stop eating it. I was out of Parmesan, but doing just mozzarella was good too.

This was delicious.  I doubled the recipe and it went fast!  Next time I will triple or perhaps quadruple the recipe!

I served with olive oil seasoned with basil, oregano, garlic and crushed red pepper.

Great recipe!  No problem with rising--no need to proof.   Just perfect!  Always start with good yeast.  Adjusted for my altitude (7720) and 15 minutes was perfect!  Browned up nicely!  Mange-Mange!

I mixed in my bread machine, used fresh garlic and only 2 1/4tsp yeast. After it rose in machine, I took dough out, let rest, shaped as recipe stated,let rise. Then dimpled it as most focaccia, and brushed with oil, kosher salt,sprinkled parm. Didnt use mozz.Baked quite nicely, but the cheese did get quite dark. My son loves focaccia dipped in herbed olive oil, he ate most of it, but he did say it wasnt as good as my regular.

This is good; we'll make this again. Just let your oven preheat to about 100 degrees for five minutes, then turn it off, and let the dough rise in there. After 20 minutes outside the oven and no rising, I went ahead and did that, and mine rose beautifully after that. It took 40 minutes total for me. Just make sure to keep an eye on it when it's baking in the oven; 15 minutes was a little too long in my case. I sprinkled a little bit of rosemary on the top of my bread too as well before baking it. Thanks for the recipe!

This was so good - what I did was placed a pot of boiling water at the bottom of the over and covered an oiled bowl with a damp piece of paper towel - I also heated the oven to 90* and let it sit for 40 minutes.  It rose to double its size.  Then I baked for 20 minutes, and added carmelized onions on top.  Really good.

I used KitchenAid to make sure I knead the dough enough.  I didn't bother putting the mozzarella.  It came out great.  It was risen as much as the picture, it was moist and soft and fragrant.  The key is to knead the dough right and also to provide good environment for the dough to rise.  Make sure to work in a non-drafty area.  Put the dough in a bowl, loosely cover with plastic wrap and either leave it by the stove or put it into the oven with a pot of boiling water to bring up the temperature in the oven to 80 degrees.  Within an hour, the dough should rise to your need.

People who complained about the dough probably didn't knead enough or let the dough rise.   This came out wonderful.  I added fresh sweet basil and put chopped onion and sliced tomatoes on top of bread.  I omitted the mozzerella cheese and put more parm cheese instead.

This was great my family loved it. The only thing I changed was added 1/2 red bell pepper. It was so good. Although the bread did'nt rise as it shows in the picture. But that must have been because of all the bell pepper. Overall it was great like a low fat pizza!

this was sooooo good!  i made the dough in my bread machine, and just used parmesan and olive oil on the top, after i punched a few holes all over with the end of my wooden spoon...allows the oil to seep in and make it moist!  thanks for an EASY and great recipe!

Easy to do and nice and fluffy.  Didn't put in the garlic, parmesan or basil (personal taste)plus had dentist next day!
Children had a plain focaccia without herbs.  Turned out just as nice.

Definately leave for 1 hour to rise to start with and remember to roll the dough out very thin as this bread rises alot.

The herbs made the focaccia taste and smell fantastic!! Remembering another focaccia I had in Italy, I added red onion slices and black n green olives on top of the bread, then sprinkle the cheese. I didn't have mozarella so I just used some other shredded cheese that I had, gouda or so. I wanted to know if it would still taste good the next day, but didn't get the chance since my boyfriend n his friend took only a few hours to finish it :P

Our family loves focaccia bread so I've been looking for a really great focaccia bread recipe for some time.  This is it!  It smells wonderful and tastes wonderful!  I didn't alter the recipe at all except to leave off the mozzarella.  (I wanted to be able to taste the bread on its own the first go around.)  Next time (and that will be today!) I'll try adding some rosemary and thinly sliced red onion as a topping.  I'm thinking this might also make a very good pizza crust.  

Oh, I also did the mixing and kneading in my bread machine on the dough cycle.  It doesn't get much easier than this for such great results!

One of the best recipes ever for this kind of bread.  Just remember to "fork" the dough like a pie crust once it is on the baking sheet or it will be puffy instead of flat.

I wanted a quick focaccia to go with my pesto, and this recipe did not disappoint!  It's even better the next day.  The only change I made was that I dissolved 1 Active Dry Yeast packet into the cup of very warm water and added the sugar to help get the yeast going.  Then, I mixed together the flour and herbs, adding the liquid yeast mixture last.  This is how I was taught to make pizza crust, and it's a great technique.

Very good and very fast.  You can easily fit it in with the regular dinner preparations.  Don't overbake--it toughens the bread.

Very Excellent Bread!  I made the Garden Herb loaf a couple weeks ago and that was great, but I must say in flavor that this is even better.  I love the flatbread style and is delicious with sea salt on top with melted butter.  I substituted rosemary for tyme. I also primed the yeast by allowing the yeast to soak for ten minutes in a cup of warm water and sugar.  Cuts up nicely into breadsticks as well.

Wonderful!  Just what I was looking for.  We like this for breakfast, too.  I leave out the thyme (not a favorite with us) and sometimes put garlic flavored oil on top with parm. cheese.  I also let it rise on the pan after kneading instead of in a bowl. Makes it a little fluffier, I think.

Just the best, and very easy too!  I make it without the dried thyme because I find the taste a little bitter.  Also, I use olive oil instead of vegetable oil.

This recipe was great! I added more herbs and put some very thin tomato slices on top. I also took the advice of another reviewer and put some more cheese on a couple minutes before I took it out of the oven. Thanks for the recipe!

This is a very good recipe.I added minced fresh garlic to the olive oil for the top for flavor.The cheese topping gets crispy,if you don't like that you should add for last few min. of baking.

My daughter (especially) loved this.  It went well with our mostaccioli.  It is very simular to Italian Herb Bread (from this site) but much quicker & easier.  A comment to a previous reviewer with the yeast problem, if you add warm water (110 degrees) to the mixture, your yeast will disolve.  Thanks Terri!

I've made this recipe twice now and it turned out differently each time for some reason.  But it was really good both times.  It makes great sandwich bread too, especially with the mediterranean veggie recipe on this site.

This recipe turned out great. The bread was as good or better than what you get in restaurants.  I used fresh oregano and fresh thyme instead of the dried.  Will definitely make again!

Just about what I was looking for.  I added thin slices of onion and green peppers to the top before I baked it and it just got better after a day or two.  I will try more variations the next time I try it.  Thanks so much!!

Ok -- I just pulled this out of the oven.  Had it with balsamic vinegar and oil, and also plain. I can tell you it won't last until dinner, which is why I made it.  EXTREMELY simple and very tasty!  I used Romano cheese on top because that's what I had on hand.  Excellent recipe.

What a fun and easy bread! Beautiful and perfectly risen on the pizza stone, a super thick pizza crust. I replaced water with milk, added a tsp sugar to proof the yeast, omitted garlic; otherwise followed directions, adding a second rise. Yummy! I let it rise in a 100° oven, which worked very well. Topped with olive oil, sauteed onions & peppers, and Mexi blend cheese. Would be good with sun-dried tomatoes too.

So very easy! Followed general ingredients except used cheddar, and 2.5 tsp Italian seasoning instead of other seasonings because I had both on hand. Added onions on one half because I LOVE them. Also added a little bit more salt. GREAT flavor and so easy! I followed the suggestion of others for a second rise after flattening out. Will definitely make again!

I did not have all the herbs, so I used 1 TBS of mixed herbs bought (and then did not know what to do with, so they sat in the cubard!!!) and sprinkled garlic sea salt over top as well as the parm. Took it ti a family dinner where it was scoffed right up.

I made this the other night to go with sausage and peppers.  This is my first time ever making this type of bread.  It was very easy to make using my Kitchen Aid mixer.  I did let it rise a second time after forming the rectangle but that's because my other dishes weren't ready yet and I wanted the bread to be hot.  The texture was great and the kids ate a bunch of it.  For me, I will try reducing the dried herbs a little bit, maybe add some fresh and just a little more salt.  The herbs were strong tasting to me.  But, like I said.. the kids loved it.

So easy and delicious.  I made it for  the first time  last night and my hubby, who maintains that he doesn’t like bread, asked me to make it again today.  I followed the recipe almost exactly - left off the cheeses and added slivered fresh garlic and black oil packed olives along w fresh rosemary to the topping.   Today I think I’ll use harissa and fresh oregano to spice it up.

Made it as written minus some of the herb seasonings. 
Wonderful texture, excellent taste I made mine to go with bruschetta so I kept it plain.   Super easy minimal risetime no special flowers perfect this recipe is a keeper.

I was looking for something quick and this fit the bill. I read several reviews and made some changes based on that. I used bread flour, I always do, and cut the herbs back by half. I didn't used the garlic powder, I'm not a fan, and instead I micro planed  three large cloves into the mix.  I threw everything into the KA and let that knead for 10 minutes. A second rise is a must, IMHO, for a light and fluffy loaf. I dimpled the bread, after the second rise and before adding the olive oil. The last change that I made was using Piccorino Ramano cheese, I thought that I had mozzarella and parm but I didn't. This was wonderful and I will be making it again.

It was an OK Focaccia. It didn't rise as well as I would like so think I'd try a second rising before baking if I was to make it again. Would make a very good pizza crust or base for appetizers though.

I did not really make changes to the recipe ingredients, but  I did change the process. Bread making is kinda like chemistry. Understanding the basics of yeast...warm water and sugar. I let the 3 ingredients sit for about 3-5 minutes. Followed by the flour/herb mix. 1st rise for about 20, then "punched" down and another rise for another 15. Lowered the temp to 450.  Came out perfect.

Just made this bread. Turned out great. However I will be altering it a bit next time. Double all spices including salt! Use WARM water so your yeast reacts to it. Let rise for 20 min then punch down then let rise for 15 more min. After stretching out to wanted size, stab with small end of chop stick, leaving small holes in the top.  Bake for 10 min before topping with cheeses and fresh basil if you have it. Use fresh parm not grated and sprinkle to cover. Then finish baking 8 more min. 10 would have been to much.

I followed exactly, except by using half unbleached flour and half white whole weat flour. The result was a dense bread that needed more salt. Had I read few reviews before making I would have let the dough rise a 2nd time after shaping and top with some corse salt.

I've made this several times and I've rated the recipe as written, using warm water . As others have stated, with modifications it is so much better! Increase garlic powder and other seasoning, and let it rest twice. Add cheese about half way thru cooking time.  Try it with roasted veggies, or jalapeños and cheddar cheese:)

This really is a great recipe that is very versatile. I like to make it when we have nothing defrosted and need a quick dinner. Only changes I made was following the suggestion of other reviewers about proofing the yeast first and second I add 1 egg to the dough and it makes, in my opinion, a nice improvement to the texture. When I bake it, I make it more like a pizza, where just before putting it in the oven I add some thin fresh sliced onions a little bit of tomato sauce and the cheese on top. Yum! It has become a favorite in our house!

This bread was really good.  I loved the texture and the thickness.  I mixed a Tbsp of Classico basil pesto with the olive oil to spread over the top then added the cheese and herbs.  It was delicious!  Thanks for sharing this recipe, Terri!

This recipe was so easy and tasted wonderful. I did the TBS of salt rather than the TSP, and it was just about right. I also let it rise a second time after I spread the dough on a baking sheet. The result was fluffy and flavorful. I received several compliments on the combination of herbs. The extra salt on top (as suggested by other reviewers) was a bit much for me. This will definitely be repeated for gatherings.

Easiest recipe ever. We used a dough only cycle on our bread machine to mix,knead and rise. The dough smelled delightful. Delicious and quick. We followed the recipe but I am certain for the toppings you could play around with it (add sundried tomatoes, onion). This is definitely a keeper!

I've never made bread before in my LIFE.  This was better than I would have ever expected.. I subbed Asiago cheese for the Mozzarella and Parmesan.  I highly recommend this recipe for someone with little to no bread baking experience as it is very simple!

Tried this because of the many rave reviews. Ended up using Italian seasoning instead of individual herbs, granulated garlic instead of powder, and even then, I halved the amounts for them.

This dough was DRY. 1 cup of water is in no way enough for this recipe. I had to add a bit more water, and even then, I should have added more. And the vegetable oil? Why? This is focaccia! If you're going to top it with olive oil, put it in it as well!

All in all, I wasn't very pleased with the recipe. It didn't rise enough, was too dense, and was too dry. I'll maybe try it again sometime, but add more liquid and fuss with it a bit more. But again..not expecting much.

This came out well with a few changes. I proofed the yeast in warm water with a little sugar first. About 1/3 cup of water (at about 100 degrees) plus a pinch of sugar gets the yeast rolling. Just subtract that amount of water from the recipe directions when adding all the other ingredients. I used olive oil for my veggie oil and add the salt only with the flour as salt can  the yeast if added too early. I used chopped fresh thyme and rosemary (about a tsp each) instead of dried herbs because I had them. Like earlier rating comments, I also did two risings and made the first rising 45 instead of 20 minutes. The texture is better.

Its a wonderful recipe. We followed the recipe exactly, and we could barely stop eating it, it was so good. If you are confused by any of the directions, there is a great video that shows how to make focaccia on here too. There was just enough oil to give it an authentic taste without being too greasy.

Also, I forgot to mention , I did this in 8"pan was wanting the bread for sandwiches.U can use either 8"round or 8by8"square pan.& also for fluffier texture don't punch down the bread much after 1st rise when u keep it on pan for 2nd rise.

Very tender, very good Focaccia bread. Easy to make. I always poof my yeast by putting it in the warm water with a teaspoon of sugar, mix it well and let it sit for 10 minutes until it poofs. If it does not poof, you know something is wrong with your yeast and you can dump that out and try it again. If it does not poof the second time, your yeast is bad or outdated.  At least you know this before wasting your other ingredients or time. This made 2 nice pieces. I divide the dough into two pieces and flatten to 1/2" and let rise til double. Then push your thumb in the dough to make some indention's and put your topping on and bake.

pretty good..i added the chopped red onion on top and wow that made it. And yes you MUST proof your yeast first.Also doubled the salt. I am so glad that I did those changes. I would make again.

Very fast and easy.  I did "proof" the yeast first, as others suggested.  I have also made it eliminating the cheese on top and sprinkling kosher salt on the dough instead.  Either way, it's delicious and excellent served warm and dip into olive oil.

Thanks for this recipe, Terri.  We loved the bread.  Having no Mozzerella in the house, I had to use Fontina cheese but otherwise I didn't change a single ingredient.  I did, however, change the baking method a bit as I do have in my possession both a pizza peel and a baking stone.  So I put some corn meal down on the peel first and then slid the loaf onto the hot stone, and it was done in 13 minutes to perfection!  I also used my food processor to mix the dough.  (Mix the water, yeast, and sugar separately and let it proof for 10 minutes. Put the other ingredients in the processor bowl, and then pour the liquid into the processor slowly until your dough ball is formed.) Your recipe is going into my "Tried-and-True" recipe binder!  Thanks!

This came out delicious! I didn't need to proof my yeast because it was in an unopened envelope that had not yet expired. I just made sure that the water was warm when I added it to activate the yeast and it turned out great! I also let the dough rise about 20 minutes longer than originally indicated before putting it onto the greased baking sheet. Will definitely be making this many more time!

Very good! I followed Baricat's advice, used milk instead of water. I didn't proof the yeast but I mixed it in with sugar/milk before I added all the other ingredients together. I forgot to warm up the milk I dunno if that made a difference. The dough didn't rise very much but the finished product was very good! I made a breakfast panini out of it.

I've made this twice and the first time it was the best bread I've ever made. The 2nd time was not as successful maybe I had a bad batch of yeast or something. Overall though it is really good. Thanks for sharing!

I am no baker but I made this yesterday with double recipe and it's all gone! OK I do have 5 kids. As a couple of them are quite fussy, can I add cheese to my dough to make a cheesy bread or will that just mess up the recipe?

This was such an easy bread!  I made this bread with my kids and it was such a hit.  I used cheddar instead of mozzarella since that is all that I had on hand but it still turned out delicious.  I'm really glad that someone posted instructions on proofing yeast because I'm not a baker so I would have bombed the bread if I hadn't have read that review.  I can't wait to try variations of this bread.  Thanks so much!

I love this recipe.  It's so easy and so good.  I've made it twice in the last week and it gets gobbled up every time.  I used real garlic instead of powder, and real basil.  I also added chopped up rosemary to the top and sundried tomatoes to it as well.

Great one to have in the bread arsenal.


I used half the yeast, and increased the rising time; (my preference: add 1hr at the front end to develop a sponge of the water, sugar, yeast, 1c of the flour - developes the yeast, improves flavor, kneadability/texture, then add the other ingredients and continue as per recipe). 


Like others have said, this is a great base for breadsticks, pizza dough (flatten more), focaccia dinner rolls (flatten less!!)


Cheese totally unecessary.


I wouldn't increase salt as others suggest - if you like it salty, just sprinkle more on top or dip in salted olive oil when eating.

Quick, easy and good.  What more could you want? Like others, I change it up a bit, when available I put fresh rosemary in mine rather than the dried herbs, and I leave out the powdered garlic. I don't put mozzarella on it either, just lots of fresh grated parmesean.  It's a great basic recipe, easily adaptable.

I am NOT a baker. But making this always makes me look like I know what I'm doing. Have made other recipes "proofing" yeast and they never come out this good. Love, love LOVE this recipe and oh so ez. Change toppings to whatever you want. Great with anything.

I have made this recipe many times and it's always good. I always tweak it with the ingredients I have on hand. I'll top it with different veggies, cheeses, sometimes pepperoni or grilled chicken, and I use tons of herbs. It's always guaranteed to impress and it's not so time consuming that it's impossible to make during the work week. This is really the best focaccia bread I've ever had. :)

Awesome recipe! This makes a very easy-to-work-with dough. Sprinkled the yeast over warm water and the sugar and allowed to proof for 10 minutes before adding the rest of the ingredients and mixing to combine. Then, used a Kitchen-Aid with a dough hook attachment to knead for about 8 minutes, and followed the rest of the recipe. I added a generous amount of fresh rosemary, which I highly recommend. I would love to try it with red onions and tomatoes next time! Could totally imagine using this as a pizza crust as well.

This was easy and incredibly delicious! The cheese on top did make it a little greasy, but it was so good! Tasted like pizza without the sauce!

Great. I always skip the cheese, the bread is actually great even without it.

This bread came out like a rock, I even let it rise for like an hour because after 20 mins it hasn't grown at all. I know it wasn't my yeast, as I made a different kind of bread with yeast that same day that came out just fine.  I tried other focaccia recipes that were much better so won't be using this recipe again.

I thought this tasted good, but it was really missing that rosemary and sea salt taste that I have come to associate with most focaccia. It was also much more dense than I am used to. After the 20 minute rise time, it didn't seem like much had happened. I have also never heard of putting all that cheese on focaccia. It was almost like making a sauceless pizza and I was even short about 1/4 cup of cheese. I liked that it was quick to make, and I am certain it will be gone quickly. Who doesn't like bread with cheese.

The entire family loved this bread!  I followed the recipe except for the mozzarella which I did not add.  It's a great bread for sandwich or soup. Will make it again!

This bread was delicious! I recommend sprinkling the bread with garlic salt before putting it in the oven. I didn't have basil, so I just used Emeril's Italian Herb mix. I will definitely make this again!

I'm in the camp of this recipes reviewers who agree that this recipe doesn't rise well.

The idea and the flavors are good, but there must be something wrong with the directions.  I have made some focaccias that turned out much better than this one did.

Still, it made a tasty bread, even though it was dense and only partially risen.

Very tasty as written.  I followed directions exactly and the bread turned out alright, without proofing the yeast ahead of time.  Since it is supposed to be a "flat" bread, maybe proofing the yeast isn't all that important?  Next time I will try proofing the yeast first to see if it makes a difference.

i followed the dough recipe almost exactly, including NOT curing the yeast.  it turned out REALLY good and i had no problem with it rising! i didn't have mozzarella or Parmesan --i topped with red onion, olive oil, more garlic powder, fresh tomato and cheddar cheese. Next time, I'm definitely going to add more salt,  and LOTS more garlic.  i think Parmesan will be a lot better than cheddar too! My husband really liked this (and he's VERY picky). I can't wait to make it again, except of course make it even tastier! :)

I heeded the advice of other reviewers and proofed my yeast first with the warm water and sugar. It rose wonderfully. I also added some italian seasoning and kosher salt to the top of the bread after brushing with oil. Came out very yummy and was gobbled up! Definitely adding to my recipe box!

This bread was quite easy to make & although we tried it for the first time as bread, with thin sliced onion added to the cheese mix, my husband is planning to use it for a pizza crust. I would definately use anything leftover (yea right) as italian bread crumbs for other recipes.

Fantastic! I am an intermediate cook, but definately a beginning baker.  I did follow other suggestions and wait 1/2 way through baking to add the cheese...a must for my oven.  This bread is great! Thanks for sharing this recipe!

I've been trying to work on my bread repertoire and really wanted to try a focaccia recipe. I made this bread, and while the flavor was good and the crust delightfully crispy, I wouldn't consider this focaccia because of the consistency. I was looking for something more authentic. If you are too I would find another recipe.

It was the first ever bread I made and it was delicious! However it didn't turn out the shape I imagined, it was huuge, so next time I will divide this recipe into two breads probably. I also added more ingredients on top: olives, thinly slices onions and more salt like many recommended.

This is the perfect accompaniment to an Italian meal.  I made it exactly as stated but I did proofed the yeast before adding it into the dry ingredients.  I thought the seasonings were spot on.  Also, next time I may omit the mozzarella just because I didn’t like the look of the overly dark mozzarella on the crust.  Easy, tasty - can't beat it.

I proofed the yeast with ½ cup of hot water 1tsp sugar for 10mins then added the oil and mixed it slowly with all the other dry items. I let the bread rise for 35mins and then cut it in to large bun sized pieces. Baked them at 450f for 18mins.

I decided as the lasagna was in the oven to whip together this bread. I am not much of a bread maker, but I have to say this turned out delicious and soft. I did make a booboo in oven temp. 10 minutes into baking the bread I realized the temp was only set to 325?!!?  I upped the temp and cooked 5 more minutes, an amazingly it still turned out. I topped it with chopped fresh garlic, cheese and sea salt.

Super easy to make! Bread turned out perfect. 

Didn't put too much mozzarella and had no parmesan but still tasted great! If not adding these cheeses, Salt can be doubled. 

Added red onions and chopped garlic on top. Yum!

Easy to make and really good!  My two young boys really loved it too!  I think you can add lots of toppings to it (sauteed onions, zucchini, etc.) to make more of a pizza.  I'm going to try this next time!

Good flavor and easy to do. I swapped out the water for warmed (110°) milk. Even if you stick with water, it should still be warmed to get the yeast going.  I also used one cup of whole wheat flour for some of the flour. It took more like 40 minutes for this to rise. I also let it have a second rising once it was pressed into the pan. Helps make it more light and  fluffy. I sprinkled with fresh Parm and kosher salt. No mozzarella. This bread was on the small side. No way it could serve 12 people. Well, it could but they wouldn't be happy about it.

Excellent recipe, and easy, even for someone like me who cannot seem to bake a single loaf of bread. The first attempt yielded amazing results, and it got gobbled up! Due to my drier environment here, I had to add, in small portions, another half a cup of water to have the dough pull together. Didn't add the garlic, not because it wasn't uh.. authentic, but because I forgot. Hah! It was full-bodied, flavorful, and the only other difference between the recipe and my bread was the olive oil I used. It was infused with lemon or somesuch - picked it up at a market day in Morro Bay. Perfectly delicious. I recommend a flavoured olive oil for this!

A favorite for gatherings or dinner parties.  I get requested to make this all the time.  I leave mine to rise in the oven at the lowest setting as it can be hard to find a "warm" place in Alaska...

My husband is a tough critic! After making this, he said I could make it to accompany our dinner EVERY night! I made it just as the recipes stated and it was AHHHHH-MAZING! :)

This tasted great and smelled fantastic! Served with California Grilled Veggie Sandwich, grilled asparagus, rotisserie chicken, and watermelon.

Delicious!  I made very few changes to this recipe.  I used Extra Virgin Olive Oil in place of the vegetable oil in the recipe.  I only used 1/2 tsp garlic powder and I didn't have any basil.   I used my stoneware pizza stone to cook it on.  Before putting it in the oven I poked it with my fingers to make little dents and then drizzled the olive oil on top instead of brushing it on.  I also sprinkled on 1/2 tsp oregano and thyme, and come coarse sea salt.  Topped with the fresh grated parmesan cheese.  I omitted the mozzarella.
This recipe  does turn out flatter than most, but is moist and delicious.  We dipped it in balsamic vinegar and olive oil.
This was a fast, easy recipe and I'm sure this will become one that I make often.  I can see so many potential varieties in it.

this is amazing!  Everyone i make this for raves about it.  It is requested constantly by my family.  I sprinkle garlic salt on it before the cheese goes on.  And you do not have to proof the yeast.  Just make sure the water is warm. I even made this as a pizza crust. My family loved it like this as well.

This recipe is excellent. The only thing that I did different was that I proofed the yeast (I heated the water and added the sugar and yeast and let it sit for 5 minutes) and I also added a tsp. of rosemary. I also omitted the mozzarella altogether and sprinkled the top with olive oil, sea salt and parmesan. This bread is great for grilled sandwiches as well as for dipping in olive oil with salt/pepper and garlic.

Good foccacia flavour, but not the greatest texture. Mine was fairly dense and dry - next time i would add the flour in increments.

I made this twice already. It's a great recipe. I was having a problem the first time with the dough not rising. My mom told me next time to use warmer water, and put the oven on just for a minute, shut the oven off cover the dough and put it in the oven. This worked perfectly the second time around. Added cheddar cheese and jalapenos on top. It was delicious!!

This is the first bread I've made that actually turned out tasty!  I followed the directions exactly (Using my kitchenaid mixer) except that I used olive oil instead of veg. oil (I didn't have any) and omitted the mozzarella cheese (again didn't have any).

It tasted great and was easy to make, the only change I made was I only used 2 cups of flour. The dough was way too tough with the extra 3/4.

I didn't have all the dried spices so I used Mrs Dash Garlic Blend, and it still turned out very well.  I'll try the recipe as written once I hit the grocery store again, but I think this one is a keeper.

I did end up proofing the yeast because I wanted a lighter, fluffier flatbread, but I'm not sure how much difference it made.  It was very tasty and chewy and the spices made it delicious!

A hit with my family although I pared back on the herbs.  I used about 3/4 tsp of thyme and rosemary and put garlic salt on top with the cheese.  Such an easy recipe you can modify it any way you want!!  I made a second batch right away, mixing diced jalapenos in the dough and topping it with shredded sharp cheddar. That batch was gone even faster! Great recipe, thanks!

I thought this bread was moist and tasty...I did let the yeast, sugar, and water sit for 10 minutes which helped the bread rise.

to make this easy I threw everything in my bread machine & if i didnt already know my water needed to be warm (110 degrees) this probably wouldn't have worked out so well because this recipe fails to mention that very important step which is partially  why I gave this 3 stars. I used half water, half milk for mine and added some rosemary because I love it in bread. Id recommended not flattening your bread too much, 1/2 an inch is too thin for me so I made my dough about 2 inches thick and added salt before baking. My husband and I liked this, it made yummy sandwich bread.

I didn't have any Thyme so I left that out.  I also added some kosher salt to the topping with the parmesan/mozz.  Delicious!  I served with some cheese and sopresetta as well as some olive oil/balsamic vinegar.  Tomorrow, I plan to use this for brushetta and my SO stated he would like to try it as a sub. :)  This was one of the quickest and easiest bread recipes I've ever made.  thank you!

Awesome bread. The texture and flavor were perfect; I make bread often and I'm not sure exactly what made this one different, but it's not the typical white bread! I used fresh herbs and didn't add cheese, but used the bread for dipping. I love that it doesn't take too long to make, too.

This was really tasty and my husband and sister loved it.  I followed someone else's recommendation and let the yeast, sugar, and warm water sit for 10 minutes before adding it to the flour.

My second try was much better than my first.  I proofed the yeast before adding the dry ingredients and used milk for the rest of the liquid as well as some minced fresh garlic in the dough. I sprinkled fresh rosemary and mozzarella toward the end of baking.  This one was lighter than my first try and the rosemary really made it.

This was my first attempt at making focaccia, and one of my very few times making bread without the help of my bread machine.  I was nervous, but this recipe went flawlessly.  I followed it exactly - the dough came together perfectly, rose in 20 minutes, and baked in 15.  This was the perfect side to our soup at dinner tonight.  Considering how easy and quick this was - I will be using this recipe often.  Now that I have the base dough, I will experiment with different herbs and cheeses!

great bread, but I left out the garlic powder, and sauteed garlic in olive oil to brush on top, tastes much fresher that way, you don't want your homebaked foods tasting like mass produced overprocessed generic supermarket creations. Go for fresh when you can.

You must activate the yeast with 110 degree water. Otherwise, The wife and I loved the bread and would have given it 5 stars.

This is quick and easy and it will definitely impress people.  I usually make it without the mozzarella and with the addition of sliced tomatoes (as well as real garlic instead of powder).  The recipe is very versatile.  Thanks!

Quick & easy and very good...  will measure dry ingredients in zipper bags to make it even easier for next time.  Rose fine - proofing is to make sure your yeast is good, not to help the bread rise...  if your bread doesn't rise, it is old or needs more time in a warm enough place.

I made this to bring to the neighbors last night.  As per other posters, I did proof my yeast first, and let it rise quite a bit longer.  I brushed the top with olive oil, sprinkled with coarse salt and fresh chopped rosemary, and added fresh grated parmesan the last couple minutes of baking (no mozza).  We dipped it in balsamic vinegar and oil and it was delicious!  My only complaint is that it was gone too soon!  I will definitely make this again :)

Fantastic.  Mmmmm....  We loved it.  I made it exactly as written this time.  lol  I will be trying it with thinly sliced tomatoes and roasted green peppers.  I doubled the recipe and it fit great in my large cookie sheet which I believe is 11x17.  It was the perfect thickness for both eating plain and slicing in half for a sandwich.  We got 22 inches of snow this week so I had lots of time to try many NEW recipes.

Not greasy at all! I added 1 small jar(10 oz)black olives(chopped), 1c. feta cheese and more herbs. I omitted the mozzarella on top and added more herbs instead. I let the dough rise for about 5 hours, shaped it, then let it rise again for another hour or so. Used my fingertips to make little dents all over the dough, maybe an inch apart, then brushed with oil and added more herbs. My husband really liked this.   This recipe is EASY, you can add whatever you want to the batter and then put more on top.

This was absolutely wonderful! I used all whole wheat flour with some vital wheat gluten added to help the rise. I also substituted honey for the white sugar. I will be making this again :)

This was great! If you have problems with the bread being flat you may want to check your yeast to make sure it's still good and make sure it's room temperature.  For toppings, I tried several things - on a few I did roasted red pepper and cheese, others rosemary and sea salt, more with several cheeses, and a few with carmelized onions from this site and blue cheese.  They were ALL great. Kids liked the plain cheese best but all the adults liked the the carmelized onions and blue cheese the best.

Here's what I do each and every time I fix this bread.  I make the dough plain, After the first rise I punch it down and put it on a cookie sheet and push or roll it to fill out the cookie sheet.  I then put the dimples in with my knuckles, let rise again to about and inch or more high.  Then I brush on good olive oil and sprinkle all over with seasonings that I mixed in a small custard cup or mortar, salt, pepper, crushed rosemary and garlic powder with parsley.  Sometimes I put anchovies all over or on half, depending how many like them, this is wonderful with or without anchovies.  This is how my Italian mother serves Focaccia now and while I was growing up.  This is also perfect to serve with dinner or use as your bread to make  sandwiches

Really good and easy bread.  I did not have any parmesan cheese so I had to leave it out and it was still really good.  A keeper.  The recipe fails to tell you to activate the yeast.

Fantastic, easy recipe for focaccia bread!  Loved that it only took an hour from start to finish.  Only downside is that the loaf only lasted a day!! Based on previous bread making experience and previous comments, I made sure that the water was warm, between 120 - 130 degrees Farenheit, when I added it to dry ingredients.  As I was using Fleichmann's Quick Rise Yeast, I did not need to proof the yeast.  As well, I omitted the cheese and instead brushed the top of the bread with olive oil and topped with rosemary and sea salt.  Got great reviews from my roommates.  Will definitely be making again!

absolutely incredible!  i added more fresh rosemary and the aroma filled up the entire house.  I made sandwiches with this bread for my vegetarian boyfriend.  i filled the sandwich with roasted eggplant and zucchini, mushrooms sauteed in butter with a mayo and minced garlic mix on both sides of the bread.  he told me this sandwich could be sold in a restaurant for ten dollars.  now when he is craving the sandwich he simply asks for the "ten dollar" sandwich.  enjoy!

I thought this bread was tasty. I made it twice, once according to directions, and the second time, letting it rise longer and using the hints from other people's reviews about proofing the yeast. I would say it was a little better with the longer rise, but not much different. I used it for the Grilled Mediterranean Vegetable Sandwich.

This is wonderful bread.  I baked it in an 8X8 stoneware dish because I wanted the bread a little thicker for sandwiches.  I can't have dairy, so I skipped out on the cheeses and it was still very tasty.

My first time making focaccia and it was a HUGE hit! The only thing I did differently: I put lots of shredded parmesan cheese on top before baking (didn't have grated parmesan or mozzarella at the time). It was excellent! Oh yeah, one more thing: I baked it on parchment paper on a large cookie sheet. Very easy!

All i have to say is - this bread is ab-so-lutely DEEELISHHH! Take it from a foodie: if you want to experience a "better-than-sex turkey BLT" sandwich, make your next one with this bread fresh out of the oven. And in case you take my advice... you're welcome ;)

Excellent and easy recipe. I'm not a bread maker and am very impressed with how light this bread is. Used 1/2 milk and half water and italian seasoning. Used an 8" cake pan to bake so it would be easy for a large party sandwich. Next time I'll make a large rectangle or 2 rounds as it turned out quite thick. Can't wait to make this again and add different ingredients and toppings! Thanks Terri!

In my opinion, this recipe is pretty good, but I didn't care for so many spices in the dough.  This is easily solved by just cutting back, so with a few more adjustments with the toppings, I think I will try it again.  Thank you for sharing!

Whether you've been afraid to try a yeast bread before or a seasoned baker looking for a quick addition to your meal, do try this recipe. Very easy to add and subtract cheeses, herbs and spices to suit your own taste and your menu, so go ahead and experiment! Serve with olive oil for dipping. A great quick bread that can be thrown together while dinner is cooking.

Very good!  I didn't put the mozzarella on it, but I did add about a 1/2 Parmesan cheese, some onions, olives, and artichoke hearts.  Big hit!

Nice easy recipe...I left out the sugar and added roasted garlic oil I make and used fresh rosemary in the dough. Drizzled with more garlic oil then baked and had this for lunch with a homemade marinara sauce. I made the dough in my food processor and rate this a 5 star recipe that's easy to put together and a hit for a snack.

you can use instant yeast no need to proof. I use an Alton Brown pizza dough recipe no proofing needed. It really works...

I threw the ingredients in the bread machine.  Cooked for half the amount of time and then added the cheese and baked for the remaining time.  Whole family loved it.  Made with the "Best Marinara Sauce Yet" from this sight.

Great recipe!Received many compliments, next time I'll double as there was none left over. The bread was perfectly light and bubbly with excellent taste and (as bread always does) left my whole house smelling wonderful. I didn't have mozzarella so I used a cheddar/jack mix to sprinkle on top along with the parmesan and it was great! I will make this one often!

I too wondered how this recipe would yield a yeast bread, so I took advice from many others who posted about this recipe. Yes, temper the yeast first. But otherwise, it is great. I brushed the top with my shallot-garlic-herb butter (melted) instead of the olive oil and OMG is it GOOD! My husband says I'd eat dog doodie if it's got cheese on it, but this recipe exceeded my expectations for flavor except for the rising issues.

This was delicious. I did wait to put the cheese on until it was halfway finished baking so that it wouldn't brown too much, but made no other changes. My wife says it tastes just like something that would be served at a very nice restaurant. Great recipe! Thank you.

Excellent!  I made this for Christmas dinner and was told it was restaurant quality.  I subbed roasted garlic for the mozz (smashed up in the oil).  I did not proof my yeast but was sure to add warm water to the mix.  This was deadly good and I'm sure would make an awesome pizza crust.  I will make this OFTEN - Thank you!

Delicious! I will definitely be making this again. Two things I will do differently: Mine was crispy after only 10 minutes. I think this is because I spread it too thin. So make sure you give it enough depth. Also, at the suggestion of some others, I put 2 tsp of salt in, but I really found that to be too much. Next time I'll use 1 tsp like the recipe says.

This is some of the best focaccia bread i have ever had. The only down fall of this recipe is that they don't tell you to heat your water or else the yeast won't work. I didn't know if it was specific to the recipe not to heat the water, but I didn't take the chance and I'm glad I didn't or else i would have flat dough. To enchance your focaccia experience, try Bread Dipping Seasoning by Dean Jacobs. I purchased this at Le Gourmet Chef and I love to put it in the foccacia bread as well as in my olive oil that I dip the bread in. I hope this helps!

This bread was super easy and quick to make and it turned out sooo good!  I messed up and added 3 TBS of olive oil to the dough (instead of just one of vegetable) but it still turned out good.  I just didn't brush it with oil or use cheese before I baked it.  I also used half wheat flour and the bread was still very soft.  I didn't have any problems with the bread rising without proofing the yeast.  Great Recipe!  I'll definitely make this again (but I won't mess up on the oil next time).

Made this exactly as written.  Both of my picky teenage boys commented on how much they liked this bread last nigt.  One even said, "That bread was amazing.  Make it again."  So, we're having it again with dinner tonight.  Bonus:  Baking this bread makes the whole house smell yummy!

It is my first try at focaccia and I made a mistake and added both vegetable and olive oil into the dry mix, something I didn't realise until I revisited this page one week later! Yet it turned out fantastic! Quite a fail proof recipe and the short time from preparation to table is what I am looking for. Many thanks, Terri!

Has anyone else used this as a pizza crust?  I have and it is really very good, if you like a thick crust pizza, which we do.  I also have made it with different cheeses and it is delish.

Didn't have basil so I used a teaspoon of rosemary instead. I used 1/4 cup of warm water (baby bottle warm), 1 teaspoon of sugar, and 1 tablespoon of yeast.  If the yeast mixture starts to foam, the yeast has been activated. It was too cold to let the dough rise at room temp. so I heated the oven up at around 200F for a couple of minutes.  Then turned it off and put the dough in.

This is the first bread that I've tried and if it turned out so well for a beginner then I must say it's a great recipe! The first time I made it was quite dense but that was because my yeast was very old. This time I bought new yeast and had crossed my fingers. The bread was soft and very tasted. We sprinkled cheese and chillies on top.

I really enjoyed this bread!  It smelled like a deli in my kitchen while it was baking and I couldn't wait to try it.  I didn't have thyme or basil, but it turned out great without the spices.  I would definately make this easy-to-make bread again.

Following other reviewers advice I proofed my yeast, and allowed the bread to rise for a full 40 minutes. 
The taste was fine, but the bread was still flat. Maybe I messed something up somehow, I'll defiantly try again because it was gone in minutes!

Wow- my first ever bread baking experience and it turned out awesome! I used special bread flour and it was so light and fluffy and crispy on top- the cheese really makes it great and the kiddos loved it!  We served it with chili and it was great for sopping up the leftovers!  Thank you for inducting me into the world of breads!

This recipe was phenomenal!  I made a few additions that I thought would ruin it, but it still came out great!  The yeast called for the water to be 120-130 degrees Fahrenheit.  I recommend trying that since I used warm water and my bread didn't expand to full size.  I also let the dough rise for 40 minutes.  I didn’t use the cheese suggested in the recipe, I used Italian blend, and that was just as good.  I’ll be making this again.

I have been making this for ages and just now got around to rating it.  It may not be 'traditional' focaccia, but it's perfect with spaghetti or lasagna or anything really.  My husband prefers the buttered-to-death Texas Toast you get in the freezer section, but I'm cooking, and this is what I make!

My family loved it. I thought that it was too crunchy and not soft enough because that's what I expected, but it was good. I did think something was missing though. There wasn't a special flavor to it... maybe more basil? I added minced garlic while kneading instead of garlic powder. Oh, don't forget some marinara sauce for dipping!

this is wonderful!  very easy, nice and chewy, great flavor.  i used fresh thyme and basil from our garden (ya cant beat fresh!) and made the dough in our bread machine!  reminds me of pizza hut breadsticks *in a way*.  this will be regularly made at our house!  (makes great breadcrumbs too!)

I made this just like the recipe said except I added a pinch of ground rosemary and didn't use the mozzarella because I didn't have any.It turned out crispy and delicious. I just had to stop my boyfriend from eating ALL of it before the lasagna was ready!

I really liked this recipe.  The only problem I had was that I left it in there for too long (not according to the recipe though) and the cheese got a little too brown for my taste, but my husband still loved it that way!  Thanks for the great recipe :)

I have barely any experience with yeast breads, so anything wrong with this is probably my fault.  The dough didn't rise like I was expecting, and I think I overworked it a bit.  The end result was a bit tougher than I had hoped, but still pretty yummy.  Boyfriend made panini sandwiches with this; I think it would be better eaten on its own, there's so much flavor in there already it really doesn't need anything else added to it.  A great recipe that will probably only improve as my cooking skills do!

This foccacia was pretty good, but I have had better. It had too much thyme, and besides that, wasn't really that flavorful. I would definitely recommend substituting some minced garlic for a portion of the garlic powder as well. The texture was very good though, and it was easy to make. I've made it twice--first as a foccacia and then as a pizza crust. I'll try experimenting with the herbs a bit next. This foccacia is worth a try!

My husband can not get enough of this bread. I've made it to go with pasta dinners and salad lunches... it's easy and wonderful. Oh yeah, the WHOLE house smells like an Italian resteraunt when it's rising and baking. Can't get that effect from a Yankee Candle ;)

My husband and I really enjoyed this. I proofed the yeast with half a cup of warm water and half a cup of flour. I also used a teaspoon and a half of Italian seasoning, and a teaspoon of basil, rather than all the individual seasonings. I can't wait to try this as a pizza crust.

This was so simple to make and took very little time. My family really loved this bread! They almost ate the whole thing! This was really great for something I threw together because I forgot to ask hubby to pick up garlic bread on his way home. This will be a regular on my table now.

This came out great in my bread machine (yes, you need to proof the yeast first) and made the best pizza crust I've ever made.  It makes the perfect amount for a standard pizza stone.  I use "Jay's signature pizza sauce" from this site. Mmmmm!

Makes /great/ bread! I did tweak the recipe a little, though - though I used fast action yeast, so I didn't need to proof it, I did leave the bread to rise for about an hour; and instead of the quantities of herbs mentioned (half a teaspoon of basil? come on!), I threw in copious amounts of whatever was in the cupboard. Oh, and I used wholemeal flour, just because. :)

We loved this.  We invited a friend over for dinner who has dairy allergies, I'm so glad we could use this recipe.  We only put cheese on half of it, so the rest of us could still enjoy the cheese.  It was delicious, especially dipped in olive oil and balsamic vinegar.  We will make this often.

Delicious! I crushed some dried rosemary and put it on top along with some large-grained salt. I left it on the counter of my house with a bowl of salted olive-oil and  the whole loaf was gone by the end of the afternoon!

An easy-to-make crowd pleaser! I served this as an appetizer with olive oil and balsamic vinegar for dipping. I also used coarsely chopped fresh basil in addition to the recipe's dried spices.  The dough keeps well for a few days so it's worth making a double batch and baking it as needed.

Wonderful!  Fresh bread in about an hour, from start to finish.  I proofed the yeast, used fresh basil, and put fresh garlic on top as suggested by others. Try making this with whole wheat flour--it's still delicious!

Loved this recipe! Was very simple and has turned out perfect everytime I have made it. We use it with dips and make a delicious toasted/grilled chicken sweet chilli sandwich with cooked slices of chicken breast, garlic butter, sweet chilli sauce, onion and red pepper. Will make again and again!!

I can't believe I made this! I proofed the yeast with a 1/4 c of water and 1 tsp of sugar, as suggested. Because of this I didn't add any more sugar and used only 3/4 c of water. I added one clove of minced garlic, along with the garlic powder. Instead of the vegetable oil I used olive oil. I forgot to brush more olive oil on the top, but the bread didn't care. It came out crisp on the outside, moist and chewy on the inside. I can't wait to try this one again with other ingredients like sun-dried tomatoes and olives. Thanks for an awesome recipe!

This recipe was fabulous!  I substituted fresh basil, and fresh garlic though.  I also took the easy way out, and let me bread machine do the work.  It turns out perfectly every time!  Everyone in my family loves this recipe!  Thank you for sharing it!

This was really good!  I made this tonight with homemade Pastae Fagioli soup and it was perfect together!  This bread smells so good while it is baking.  The only thing that I would change would be to add the cheese in the last 5 minutes of baking that way it does not burn.

This was excellent- great chew. The only change I made was to use about 3/4 C. of whole wheat flour, and it was still great. My only complaint was how dark the cheese got- next time, I will save the calories and unsightly presentation, and just leave it off.

I followed the recipe EXACTLY and my dough did not rise at all, but I still made it and it was horrible. I have made breads before so I don't know what I did wrong. I will try a different recipe next time maybe that one will work.

Instead of teaspoons of the herbs I used a tablespoon and the taste was awesome! This was my first time and it came out a little thin. After reading other reviews, I will definitely proof the yeast first as I had trouble with the dough rising. Can't wait to try it again!

This was good. I did have to add a little more water to get a workable dough on the amount given it was a little bit dry.It rose quite well and I topped with mozzarella and red onion rings. Went well with pasta salad. Thanks

The bread was quite tasty, but I agree with other reviewers, it turns out kinda flat. I followed the instructions and used the tips from others but still ended up with a thin bread.

Very good bread. I made the dough using my bread machine (on the "dough" cycle). I used about half the amount of herbs called for. I felt it would've been overpowering otherwise. That's just my personal preference. I like being able to taste the flavor of the bread with just a *hint* of herbs. 

I only used a small amount of mozzerella as well, and next time I think I will just omit it because it browned very quickly and made the bread less appealing. Delicious recipe though. Thanks so much, I'm very happy with it.

The bread was delicious -- i put fresh herbs, sun dried tomatoes, carmelized onions, and herbs on top... All i added to the dough was dried oregano... I thought the bread was a little dense (I had problems with the dough rising) -- but my chef husband thought it was perfect.  I would definitely use this recipe again!

I made 2 loaves of this for a party.  Not sure what I did wrong, but neither one rose (one not at all) much.  The flavor is really good, although I don't think it really needs all that cheese.  If someone can tell me what I did wrong, and how to get the dough to rise I sure would appreciate it as I would like to make this again.  I heated the water to 115 degrees, then dissolved the yeast in that.  I mixed all the dry ingredients in a bowl, then added the olive oil, then the liquid yeast mixture.  I kneaded for 5 - 8 minutes and let it "rise" for an hour in the bowl, then an hour in the pan, and still it didn't rise.

This is one of my standard recipes that I make at least once a week with various toppings. My granddaughter is especially fond of it with finely diced pepperoni mixed in the dough. I love having it for lunch with sliced tomatoes and olive oil. Yummy easy and excellent recipe.

Excellent bread! ^_^  I made this alongside a pasta dish and this was more  popular!  My mother, a person who hardly touches bread, ate half the  pan.  She loves it and so do I!  The only ingredient I didn't have on me was garlic powder, but I substituted real garlic instead.  I made this again, this time adding some fresh veggies such as mushrooms, spinach, and onion on the top.  It turned out wonderfully!  ^_^

This was very good and easy to make. I used a heaping tablespoonful of Italian Seasoning instead of the herbs, which made preparation even easier. I topped the dough with parmasean cheese and spritzed it with olive oil. It gave the bread a nice, brown color. The bread was a little on the dense side, but very tasty. I will make this agian.

Wonderful- I separate the dough after the first rise and make it into 4 rolls and let rise on the greased cookie sheet, that is going to be used to bake on, for about 45- 60 minutes. (They make excellent buns for sandwiches.)
I omit the cheese.

This didn't turn out quite right but I am quite certain it was "operator error."  I didn't knead the dough long enough cuz it came out biscuity tasting and 450 was too hot for my oven (or elevation or something) cuz it was doughy in the middle and too done on the outside.  It had a WONDERFUl flavor, so I think if I make it right next time it'll be a keeper.

Awesome recipe! I got a bit nervous when the dough didn't rise like a normal bread dough would, but I am not sure if it was supposed to. It had awesome texture and awesome flavor! Definately one to go into my permanent recipe file!

This was an excellent recipe!  Very simple, and it turned out wonderfully.  I used bread flour, olive oil in place of veggie oil, and chopped up some sweet onions and roma tomatoes to top it with.  The flavor is subtle, but excellent.  Thanks for a great recipe!!!

It had wonderful taste but i wanted a more spongy texture, i gave it the extra rising time and it still didn't seem to rise much . but for the amount of work it was very good.

No wonder this recipe has so many reviews and ratings! This is the best bread I have ever had or made! My fiancee helped me make the bread and he did a great job. We didn't have mozzarella so we used white cheddar and it came out crunchy, crisp, but chewy in the middle. We used a lot of herbs because we like lots of flavor. Thanks for the great recipe!

My friends and family LOVE this bread.  I have made this focaccia bread three times since first finding this recipe, and I plan to continue using it.  The dough needs to rise longer than 20 minutes, though, and I increased the garlic by 1/2 tsp and added 1 tsp rosemary to the dry mixture.  Next time I will try dissolving the yeast in part of the water to see if that helps hasten the rising process.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I needed to make a lot of foccacia bread for a church dinner.  I went to a weiner roast, got home late, and still made 4 loaves for the next day, and got in bed at a decent time.  The next day, everyone raved over how delicious my bread was.  We dipped the bread in Olive Oil and Balsamic Vinegar.

Yum! a quick and easy bread that is wonderful with dinner and makes great sandwiches the next day...if there is any left. A very good recipe to use if you are new to baking bread. I too proofed my yeast first instead of adding the yeast to the flour. I've been doing it that way for 30 years and have always had nice fluffy bread. I used olive oil in the recipe instead of veg. oil. I don't know if it changed anything or not. Since it was delicious I guess it doesn't matter. Topped mine with thin sliced red onion, green pepper and feta. I'm making more soon. Maybe today!

this is FANTASTIC! my friends loved this! i paired this with a recipe called "california chicken spaghetti" i found on this site, and it made for a great summer meal. the spaghetti recipe calls for feta cheese, so i took some of what was left over after topping the pasta and put it on a plate and added olive oil and pepper. this bread went great with the meal and my friends loved the feta/olive oil dip. they said they felt like they were in a restaurant - i highly recommend this one! it's quick and easy, and people will be amazed you made it from scratch!

Really easy and quick for a yeast bread--made wonderful pesto and fresh mozzarella sandwiches.  I also sliced some red onion and scattered them on top under the cheese.  I'll make this again--maybe add some rosemary or sundried tomato for variations.

Wow! Fantastic and so easy! This is the first "real" bread I've ever made, and it turned out better than any focaccia I've had at a restaurant. For those having trouble dissolving the yeast: pour warm water directly over the yeast after adding it to the flour mixture. Thanks for the great recipe!

Excellent recipe.  Absolutely fabulous tasting bread!  I made this to use with the Mediterranean Vegetable Sandwich that is also on this site.  It was so, so good.  Followed the recipe as written with the exception of adding some crushed red pepper.  This was easy, quick to make and tasted incredible.  Can't ask for much more with a recipe!  Thanks so much for sharing this, it will be made often around here!

Fantastic! Even my very picky daughter ate this. I added some olives (Green & Kalamata), after I pitted them, and made it into olive bread. Everyone at work thought I had been to the bakery.

This is a good basic recipe to experiment with. I let my dough rise for an hour, and I still ended up with really, really dense bread. I doubled the salt, and followed another reader's suggestion of putting a layer of spices and garlic powder between the bread and cooking sheet. Otherwise I don't think it would have tasted very good. I really liked the fact I could have fresh bread on the table in less than an hour. I also added about 3/4 cup of grated parmesan, and I still didn't think it was enough (though I didn't add mozzarella, next time I definitely will add another cheese). Also, next time I will really slather on the olive oil, the top ended up a little dry and floury, where I really wanted a nice slick surface like restaurant focaccia has.

This is a keeper. Every one loved it. Problem is that it does not last long. Be ready to make more.
I also added red and green peppers and onion on the top. Roll the dough thiner and make pizza with your favorite toppings or make into bread sticks. You can be creative with this one.

This is always a hit with any Italian dish or seafood.  I serve it with olive oil and balsamic vinegar for dipping.  I also double the rising time to make it extra light.  Easy and delicious, and it disappears in minutes.

This is a nice dense bread that I use a lot.  I sometimes use it for pizza crust, too.  I often alter the amounts and types of herbs or leave the herbs out altogether.  My favorite change is to top with a pre-grated 4-cheese blend.  It's a crowd pleaser!  It is super quick and easy!  Also, I love to serve this with roasted red pepper dip!

Tasted really sensational, and it must be easy if i can do it, trust me. One thing, should it be that dense? Didn't have enough cheese either, so i mixed the amount i had with a honey mustard salad dressing i had to hand, even i know enough to know it so worked ;)

One word to describe this.."Delicious".  What more can I say!  Made it last night to serve with spaghetti and I wound up skipping the spaghetti and just eating the focaccia and salad.  Thanks for sharing this versatile recipe.

A nice change with pasta. Very easy to make. My husband and I liked it. My teenage daughter thought it had too many spices. I will bake it again, but adjust the spices for my family's taste.

Instead of forking out money to buy all the herbs needed individually, I bought a spagetti bolognaise seasoning mix instead.  (Surprisingly, had exactly the herbs I needed!)  It turned out really well.

This one is a real winner.  It was wonderful.  I didn't put the cheese on top like the recipe called for.  Instead I served it with olive oil and basalmic vinegar for dipping.  It was a real hit.  So easy to make.  Easiest bread recipe I've ever made.  I was sceptical at firt becuase it didn't want you to add the yeast to warm water which is what i'm used to doing, but it came out perfect.  Will definately make again and again.

This was a wonderful recipe.  I was a little bit scared of all the herbs so I halved them except the salt and garlic.  It turned out wonderfully.  It is even better warmed the next day when the flavors have more time to mingle.

After reading about the strongness of the herbs I halved the oregano and basil, and omitted the thyme altogether.  Everyone in the family liked this very much.  I will try it again with more garlic powder and cheese, and full basil and oregano (and maybe thyme).  A really easy recipe.

This a fantastic and easy focaccia recipe!  I have made it twice.  An easy variation is to omit the herbs from the dough, keep the garlic powder.  Leave off the cheese and sprinkle fresh, snipped rosemary and sea salt on top.  Just like a certain chain itallian restaurant that always has long lines!

What a wonderful recipe.  I have never made bread before so I can guarantee it was easy enough for a non bread maker.  I did pray though because I had no idea what some of the bread terms were and it came out wonderfully.  My husband and I almost finished the whole thing. We dipped it in olive oil that we added a little salt and pepper to.  My 3 year old wasn't crazy about it but she liked the dipping part.  Thank you another great recipe!

This bread was a little to herby tasting.  Kids did not like it.  Next time I will try a little more garlic and a little less of the remaining herbs.  Nice texture and fairly easy to make, especially if you use dough cycle and mix in bread machine!

I proofed the yeast in warm water and added the dry ingredients to the liquid mix. Also added olives and sun dried tomatoes to the dough in the second kneading as suggested by another reviewer. Rested the dough again for 20 mins on the baking tray. Baked at 400F for 25 mins. Result was a soft and flavorful bread and family loved it. Although I feel it’s a little dense, which maybe due to not giving dough enough time to rise first time.
Will try again.

I really enjoyed making this bread. I am new to cooking and thought it was something I could attempt. It was wonderful. I made it as directed but just used a little less of the green spices. I also used a baking stone and cornmeal on the stone instead of a greased pan. Thank for for posting this one!  Mmmmm.

I have yet to put the cheese on top - but, it’s fantastic!  I’m sure the cheese would put it over 5 stars.  Doubled it without an issue.  I make this now almost daily as my kids sandwich bread - with deli meat.  They say it’s the best bread they have ever had - and honestly, healthier than store bought sandwich bread - and less expensive  - bonus!! I do work FT and still have time to make this bread at dinner time.  Super easy!!  Have made open faced sandwiches, or just with butter...it’s fantastic.  Plus, any herbs you have (or don’t have) work great!  Experiment and have fun with this recipe! (Rosemary is fantastic)

I made this bread. It's incredibly easy, even on the first attempt.  I  already had all the ingredients. It tasted phenomenal; even the next day!

I used my dough cycle on my bread machine to bring this together and allowed the first rise. I added just a touch more water and will try fresh garlic next time instead of the garlic power. I topped with kalamata olives, mozzarella and parm. So tender and delicious. The house smells ah-mazing!!  DH is gonna love this! Thank you for the recipe!

Great texture, and super easy to make!  Added some fresh rosemary, but skipped the cheese topping (this time). The loaf didn't last long.

This is a very good and easy recipe. I used milk (warmed to 120 degrees) rather than water, but I did everything else the same and did not have any issues with rising or consistency. I have also used the recipe as a pizza crust; it had a difficult time supporting a heavy layer of toppings, but it had much more flavor than a traditional pizza crust. Skip buying bread to accompany Italian dishes--this is too easy and delicious.

Wow, delicious! I tweak the recipe a bit. I approve the use first in water and skipped the powdered garlic, substituting fresh garlic. I preheated the oven to F1 70 with a cast-iron skillet inside, coated the cast-iron skillet with olive oil and put the dough in there to raise 20 minutes before baking. I skipped the mozzarella cheese and just used a sprinkling of Parmesan andA generous sprinkle of Florida style

Unlike other reviewers, I didn’t allow the yeast to proof for extra time. I followed the directions. I did ensure my water was between 99-105 degrees however. I increased the olive oil to 4 Tbs , two in the mix and two on top where I poked holes (using my fingers)  to to the bottom of the baking dish, and added sea salt. I omitted the garlic, used Italian seasoning and oregano. I also omitted the Parmesan and mozzarella. Delicious result!

Recipe needed tweaked. I made it twice. The second time was much better.

Changes.... Use 50% more yeast. Put 1/2 of the water (warmed) in a small bowl with the yeast for 30 minutes before combining everything. Also, double the salt (to taste).

Note: The dough won't rise much, that's the type of bread this is. But it should rise a little bit so that it is not a dense dough ball to bite into.

The next time I will add jalapenos!  :)

I am very VERY greatful for the "most helpful" and "most critical reviews. I have been trying to make a different recipe and did not understand yeast well enough.  I now understand, and this is the bread I have been looking for!! Followed the ingredients exactly except used real garlic instead. Perfecto!

I’ve seen a lot of reviews saying that the bread didn’t rise enough.  Focaccia is not meant to rise much.  I was skeptical about the amount of herbs the recipe called for and cut back on the oregano.  I shouldn’t have done that.  Next time, I will use all of the herbs.  I didn’t have basil so used some rosemary.  This is definitely a quick and easy bread and nice accompaniment to an Italian meal.

Easy and tasty! I mixed yeast and sugar in warm water until foamy then added oil, spices, and flour. Because I had time, I let it rise 2x before baking at 400 for 20 minutes. Very nice crust,  great flavor overall. My oldest liked better than my usual recipe, and this one is easier! Will be making again for sure.

Instead of using powder seasonings I used fresh ones! I put the oil on low heat to infuse the herbs and garlic! It was so delicious! I’ll make this again and again!

Made it like 6 times! A success everytime

Really easy. And really good. I added fresh rosemary to the bread, and topped it with sliced olives & more rosemary, but I think any combination would be great.

I made this foccocia for the third time.  This one is seasoned with garlic and rosemary.and sprinkled with fresh Parmesan and sharp cheddar.  I cut it into wedges and freeze it in plastic bags.  It adds something special to our weeknight dinners.

This was my first attempt at making focaccia, and I was a little nervous. It was so very easy and the end result was perfect! I would absolutely make this focaccia again!

I've made this with both one rise/punch and two. I found it tasted fine with one rise. I usually have to add more water than the recipe calls for. Just make it according to recipe and slowly add water as needed.

Since this recipe has been out here for a long time, and almost 1,000 reviews have already identified all the short-coming I came to find the two times I made this recipe:

1. If using "active dry yeast" (e.g., Fleischmann's or grocery store single use packaging) then it is imperative to proof/bloom/activate the yeast before adding to the dough/flour mix. Generally, 1/4 cup warm water in 120-130 degree Fahrenheit (48-55 degree Celsius)

2. Recipe also did not calculate correct dough proofing time. First time I followed recipe exactly and did not come away with the dough fluffiness I imagine. Second time around, I go with my try-n-true method: always first proof any dough mix to twice the size, punch down, and either allow second proof right in the bowl, or stretch the dough onto pre-greased pan that you'll be using to bake, and let it rise to fill pan before active baking.

Personally, I would also suggest try for at least extra 1 tablespoon of olive oil to give the bread a nice shiny finish.

Good luck to all, and bon appetit!

My family really loves this bread. We eat it with soup and spaghetti, sometimes just covering it with olive oil and sprinkles of course salt.  And, we often do toppings to create wonderful pizza.  I've mixed the dough in my Bread Maker when I am multi-tasking and done it by hand at other times. So easy either way!

Excellent! I made it exactly as directed. I should add that I have never made bread before without a bread machine, but this was easy so don't be afraid to try. I did not skip the step about measuring the temperature of the water. The smell while this is baking is out do this world!  This goes perfectly with the California Grilled Veggie Sandwich which is also from this site.

I modified the recipe a bit. I only had multigrain flour on hand, so used 2 cups of that and 3/4 of pastry flour to lighten it up a bit. I also veganized the recipe by using flax/chia egg replacement and omitted the cheese by using a bit of nutritional yeast instead. For the tops I put olives and rosemary on one, olives and nutritional yeast on another and rosemary garlic on the last with the herbs in the recipe in each loaf. This bread is so simple to make and SCRUMPTIOUS! I eat this bread plain, but it's FAR from being plain with all the flavour built up. I definitely recommend for an easy bread, I didn't even knead by hand at all, just my kitchenaid and it worked beautifully!

This bread was awesome! A real winner with my family. I didn't have any mozzarella cheese and had to use a mixture but it still tasted great. Definitely making this one again.

This is a good tasting bread. My husband wanted sunflower seeds in it. So I added about a quarter cup. Delicious with the herbs and cheese.

I put all ingredients in my Kitchen Aid mixer with the dough attachment, and proofed it in my warming drawer. Before placing dough in oven, I split the dough in half, and used vegan cheese on one side, and dairy cheese on the other. It was super easy and very delicious.

It tasted wonderful. But I let it rise like a normal bread (first for 1hr then 30 min) and it was a lot taller than the picture. I think the thinner foccacia is better for pizza crust and the taller for whatever. I will totally make this again, thanks!

It smells very good, I believe that the Focaccia Bread must be very delicious and attractive. I am so lucky to make it by following this recipe and eat it, I want to share it with my friends. And I think it’s important to let the dough sit.

Made as written, with exception of mozzarella. Turned out great! For the reviewers that said you can't proof yeastt using the recipe as written. Of course you can! Just warm the water a bit. I use many awesome bread recipes  that don't require proofing the yeast before adding flour, etc.  I only proof yeast  separately if it's approaching end of life.

I didn't get a very big rise with the first try.  I kneaded it some more and let it rise again.  Still didn't do much but  It really rose  when I put it in to bake.  Had good flavor and looked great. I will make it again.

Fool proof... and I'm a fool ;) ... I've tried it both ways, with and witjout a second proofing. Works any way you choose to go. Definitely needs more salt. Nix the cheese. Not necessary.

I made this using one half whole wheat and regular flour. Also, I rolled the dough a little thinner then recommended because I used this as the basis for the California Grilled Veggie recipe that is on this web site. The bread was easy to make and I will definitely make this again.

I no longer have a bread machine. Now I don't want another one. This bread is great. It is so easy. I made it exactly by the recipe. Perfect. (I did know to use warm water). Didn't need a second rise which is great for making the bread quicker. This will definitely be my go-to sandwich bread and dipping bread.

I did the shamefull thing and changed the recipe just a little.  Added 1/2 t. of citric acid to "sour"it , like sour dough.  Put onions on top and  it was fantastic!

Great recipe.  I have made it several time including once using rice flour when we had a friend who was gluten free over.  It still was awesome, which if you have ever tried to bake with rice flour, you know is really saying something.

This bread is so good and super easy. I proof my yeast first for 10 minutes. Then I add the remaining ingredients, double the basil, and 1/2 the thyme, I also add about 1/2 cup of chopped green olives in the dough.  I use olive oil instead of vegetable and minced garlic rather than powder.  After it rises I pat it to 1/2 inch & then let it rise again for 15 minutes.  After it's baked for 7 minutes I add grated Italian cheese and garlic powder to the top then finish baking for 8 minutes.

Delicious! Made it gluten free with a gf flour blend. Followed the directions on the yeast packet. It raised a little and had good flavor. Definitely would make it again.

I made this using my bread machine and OMG!! We would give this 10 stars.  Followed the directions and we could not stop eating or saying "this is good bread".  If you have not made this you gotta try it!

Dress it up, dress it down. Loved this. SO simple and very tasty. We warmed the water to 100ish before mixing and then allowed it to rise a second time for 20 minutes in the pan before baking. 
If you are having Italian or love thyme then recipe does well as is. We were having beef stew so it could have done without the thyme, or maybe just a pinch. 
That is what is so yummy about this recipe. It is very flavorful and easy to modify.
I have yet another new, super easy way to impress the family. Thanks SO much.

As other reviewers recommended, I limited the herbs and added 1 tbsp of salt, rather than 1 tsp.  (Rosemary, rubbed sage and black pepper.)  

This turned out incredible!!!!  I melted the mozzarella under the broiler right before serving.  Best focaccia bread I've ever had, let alone made myself.  Easy, too.  

This one is a keeper, because the bread itself was perfect and will be so versatile...I'm already dreaming up a Greek version with feta, kalamata olives, topped with spinach and red onions....mmmm.

I tailored this recipe to suit my own needs, but I can say that the original recipe is 5 stars. I had to add more water- maybe 1/2 a cup. I also used maybe 8 fresh garlic cloves that I mashed with a garlic press instead of garlic powder. A helpful tip I learned on this site, is to let the bread rise a second time for 20 minutes before baking. This can really help fluff up your final bread! I did not have thyme or basil. I added the cup of mozzarella to the dough instead of using it as a topping. I did top the bread with more mashed garlic cloves (I love strong garlic in my food), olive oil, and shredded parmesan cheese. I also really like to put cornmeal on the bottom of the baking sheet instead of greasing it. Although this time I was out of cornmeal so used flour and it worked out. Very flexible recipe. Also I always proof/hydrate my yeast even if the package says it's ok not to.  Happy baking!!

This bread was light, soft, airy, chewy. While the cheese crust on top was crunchy. These was so delicious, I will definitely make this again. I was making homemade pasta along with this bread and salad, so I did cheat a bit on your recipe to save time. 
Rather the adding all the individual spices, I added 1 T Italian seasoning, but skipped the garlic. Followed the rest of the ingredients exactly. Kneaded in kitchen aid mixer for 10 min. then let it rise for 20 min. WOW, I just can't believe how good it was! Four people pretty much devoured it!!!!! Thank you so much for this recipe, Quick, easy delicious yeast bread in under a hour,  who would have thought it.

Excellent and very very EASY to make. If you need some quick tasty bread for dinner, this is a great recipe. Also made a pretty good pizza crust as well, and if sliced into strips, awesome breadsticks. Will make again for sure.

I made it two different ways, first an herb version as in the original recipe.  It was fantastic and I'll make it that way again to go with Italian Wedding soup!  The second one I made a Jalapeno Cheese version and didn't pat it out so flat so it could be used easier as a sandwich bread.  It was fantastic also!  :)  Great SIMPLE and QUICK recipe.  I loved it!

Made this two different times.  The first time, I followed the recipe exactly as written and it turned out ok.  The second, I followed some of the reviewers' suggestions and it made all the difference.  Be sure to activate yeast in warm water and sugar first, and give the dough an additional rise after punching down.  It'll help the bread not become dense.

Just took it out of the oven and snuck a taste w butter while still warm. Heavenly! Proof the yeast and let rise a 2nd time like others have suggested. I went a little heavier on the herbs and omitted the mozerella. This will definitely be a new staple for us.

It was a great recipe, though the only thing I would say is to not use too much salt as others suggested IF you are topping with Parmesan Cheese. I made this mistake, however I still rate the recipe 5 stars because the bread itself is a great consistency and though I was a little hesitant about the size of the dough after letting it rise for the time given (seemed small), it did rise giving me and my boyfriend the feel of a thick crust pizza after it was cooked (which personally, I did not mind and rather looked forward to making delicious pizza's with this recipe). I do recommend adding more spices as others suggested. I overall only used 1 tbsp of Italian seasoning when it came to seasoning since it has basil and oregano already in it. 

I also topped mine with sliced olives and I would overall recommend this recipe for a nice dough that can be personalized and topped with other yummy ingrediants! :)

Delicious! The first time it was an utter disaster but it's because I doubled all of the spices and I think I just overloaded the dough. I also used cold water and it was a cold day so I think that contributed to the lack of rising. The second time I followed the recipe except I bloomed the yeast with 1/4 cup warm water and the sugar for 5-10 minutes while I mixed the spices. I added an extra teaspoon of kosher salt and a bit extra garlic powder along with some onion powder. But this time I didn't go overboard! I like to let my dough rise in an oven heated to 185 and then turned off, I also add a glass bowl of boiling water so the bread does not dry out. I did let the bread rise again for 30 minutes after forming it onto a cookie pan lined with parchment, which is needed due to the cheese. On top  I added a little extra crushed Rosemary I just rubbed between my fingers to break it up a bit, Parmesan and mozzarella and a sprinkle of kosher salt. I baked it at 400 degrees since I didn't want my cheese burning, and I'm glad I did. It baked for 19 minutes total and at the 15 minute mark I covered it with tin foil since the cheese was browned to my liking. With those little tweaks it was perfect! Beautiful, light, flavorful and delicious! This is a keeper and can be changed a million ways depending on the meal.

I absolutely love this!! I love to bake, mainly the sweet stuff. I decided to try something savory and this came out perfect the first time I made it.  The second time I made it I used the dough to make my own version of 'hot pockets' or "pizza rolls" with mozzarella cheese and pepperoni.  Tweeked the recipe a bit but I Loved It!

Love this recipe Quick, easy, delicious. It was a huge hit with my bread-loving family. I added an egg to the dough, and used Asiago cheese on top. I think it will be a very flexible recipe. I plan to try topping it with carmelized onions next time I make it. There will definitely be a next time.

I took liberty with the herbs suggested in the recipe, choosing to use a blend of Italian herbs which already consists of the ones listed here.  Unfortunately, I had no mozzarella cheese to put on it but some thinly sliced tomatoes, chopped olives, and diced onion made it a real treat. Great, easy recipe you can fit into your morning if you're not in a rush.

Have made 4 times now...and all 4 times were wonderful.  Taste great and looks amazing.  I did change around the types of seasonings and cheese and all came out delicious.  I cut the recipe 1/2 since there are only 2 of us.  I use rapid rise yeast and proof in the water( warmed) and sugar for approx. 8-10  min. then add all the other ingredients.  I let rise for approx. 30 min. and bake at 425 for 15-16 min.  I also bake on a preheated pizza stone. Nice texture, mine have not been too heavy.  Use as little flour as possible when kneading and shaping (try oiling surface and hands if necessary) This seemed to improve the texture for me. The bread is more of a flatter bread like it should be.  To those who didn't like this, then flatten out less and adjust your baking time if necessary. Fun recipe that you can make your own.  Thanks for sharing!

Turned out great. I modified as follows:
fresh garlic, not powder. 
I also used fresh herbs and added Rosemary. Didn't have thyme, so omitted. 
I used sea salt. I find most pizza doughs and foccacias taste better with more. So I used a generous 1 teaspoon. 
I also used honey rather than sugar, because I didn't have sugar. I'm guessing around 2 teaspoons. 

The recipe didn't mention warming the water, but this is a given. Yeast needs warmth to activate. I always use instant dry yeast, so letting it rise a second time isn't necessary. It turns out soft and delicious with one rise.

Finally, I added roasted garlic and chopped olives on top, brushed the bread generously with oil once out of the oven. This keeps the edges from getting hard. One last flourish of sea salt over the top. 

Everyone loved it.

I hate making bread, it always comes out like stone, but this recipe was easy and the bread came out wonderfully. It is crispy on the outside and soft inside. I used flavored olive oil on top and it was perfect. The bread is full of flavor. I skipped the cheese on top. Will make again.

I made this about 6 times so far and I think it's the best recipe I've found.  I always change something up just to give it some more flavor; my ultimate goal is to turn it into bread that tastes like pizza  :-)

I always use about 1/3 cup fresh minced onion and and 3 cloves of minced garlic and, instead of olive oil coating the top, I use Italian dressing.  I also use a combination of Mozzarella, Parmesan and Feta cheese because,well,  cheese.

I've been making this focaccia bread forever. But today I made pizza crust out of it, since I read this idea in the reviews. It was delicious! I made two pizzas, baked on my stone, as always.  I also let the dough rise for 1 hour, instead of the 20 minutes. After I formed the pizzas, I let them rest for about 20-30 minutes, only because was waiting for my daughter to wake up from her nap. Delicious!!!

made this twice and both times left out the cheese (just because I forgot to buy it). Absolutely loved it! so simple to make. Required some heavy kneading for a good 10 minutes to get the dough nice and soft. The first time I used less flour than the recipe stated and it turned out perfect and was so good with some olive oil and balsamic vinegar. Second time I used the correct amount of flour and the dough was quite heavy.

You can actually make this into a very nice stuffed bread. After it's risen, simply roll it out, coat it lightly with a melting cheese (I like Fontina), meat (Pepperoni, Salami, already cooked sausage, ect), vegetation (Mushrooms, already sauteed), and perhaps a little something wet, a sauce of some kind, if you so wish (I skipped it, but it IS popular in dishes like beef wellington.)

Spread the filling thinly, leave room at the edges, roll it quickly. Cook as directed.

I read most of the reviews and made changes as advised: 
- proof the yeast for 10mins
- added rosemary and halved the portions for garlic powder & thyme
- let the dough rise for 40mins, pouched down and let it rise for another 30mins.
The result was so so so good! 
Thank you so much for the recipe and all the feedback!

So, I made this last night to go with the butternut squash soup I made. This bread is to die for. Like others, I did proof my yeast, and only added fresh rosemary and oregano from my herb garden. I used both cheeses. But it is so wonderful. Great texture. Great flavor. This will definitely be my go to recipe. I even kneaded it by hand, which was super easy. Yum!!

Easy & delicious, I used up a bottle of Italian blend dried spices & a dash of granulated garlic, a few grinds of black pepper, sea salt, cane sugar, 2 Tb olive oil. Sprinkled the top with just some freshly grated Parmesan! Very easy to adapt to what you have on hand or if you have a flavor preference

Oh my... Apart the yeast problem that everybody addressed earlier, this recipe was MARVELOUS!!! I put a big tablespoon of salt, as i listened to comments, but it was a bit too salty for me. I put basil, rosemary, garlic powder and allspice, i didn't put cheese as I am allergic. This is by far the most delicious bread i made in a long long time. Thank you for sharing!! :)

Fantastic and easy recipe! I doubled it and added fresh spices from my garden then topped with smoked pickled jalapenos, garlic and eggplant that my husband smokes himself. I threw in some leftover jalapeno spam, tomatoes and some carmelized onions. I also did as other reviewers suggested and added the cheese halfway and it came out perfect. One other thing was I sprinkled some sea salt over the top after I rubbed it with the olive oil. Took one whole bread to our local parts store gang and they loved it. Mahalo for the great recipe.

I received rave reviews at a ladies bible study tonight when I brought this bread. Thanks allrecipes and Terri for making me look good! :) Watched chef John's video on this site and it was very helpful before making this bread for the first time. A sprinkle of sea salt on the top is delicious. Served as a sandwich bread for a cucumber sandwich. delicious

I tweaked it quite a bit. I used 500 gms of flour with four tblsps of olive oil and 400 mls of water with a lot more yeast than usual about 3 or 4tps. Kneaded it with lots of oil as well as a bit more flour and let it proove for about 45 mins then cut it in half and put it on two trays covered with grease proof paper and let it rise again. Then loads of holes later with loads more olive oil and then salt on top with rosemary and thyme.

This bread is amazing and so quick to make. I always proof my yeast first and then add all the other ingredients. I will always use this as my go to galic bread recipe.

This is super easy, and adjustable. I used some fresh and some dry herbs. I otherwise followed the directions in the recipe and had successful results! This is a great addition to your meal.

This was fabulous.  I didn't proof my yeast, and I just let the kitchen aid abuse it for a few minutes instead of kneading it.  I doubled the spices except the thyme, and I sprinkled a little salt on top.  This was so good, my family of seven devoured it in no time!

I made it as the recipe said - but drizzled with oil and sprinkled with cheese for the last few minutes.  Next time bake on parchment.

This was amazing! It was so easy, I will never be daunted by making focaccia again! I topped with a mixture of Italian cheeses, herbs, and tomatoes. My kids and guests were impressed. First night, we ate it w gnocchi, and I used the leftovers the next night to serve w chili. It made a huge pan.

I have made this recipe time and time again and it is always a hit. I always follow the recipe as it is a great blend of herbs. I have used it as a side with chilli, and as a stand alone appetizer with balsamic dip.  The last one I made I used chipotle infused olive oil to brunch it with and it added some nice heat. An absolute favourite recipe from this site.

According to some, proofing the yeast is an unnecessary step, while others believe it's vital...baking doesn't really come naturally to me so I play it safe and proof the yeast in warm water and sugar every time I make this. It's always delicious! I've made it according to recipe and customized it with what I have on hand...it's very flexible. I recommend adding the cheese halfway through so it doesn't get over brown. Enjoy!

Absolutely love it! Was so easy and quick to make this, there is little reason not to make this often! Only thing I did differently was to use 3/4 cup bread flour in place of all purpose flour and placed cheddar cheese on top instead of Parmesan and mozzarella.

I foolishly didn't read the reviews.  I knew I should have proofed the yeast first, but tried it as written, hoping I had found an easy bread. It didn't rise properly.  I will still use this recipe, but with a proper method.

This recipe is great for the most part, but I would recommend soaking your yeast  in some  warm water before using it (1/4 oz water per 1/4 oz yeast)and using real garlic instead of powder. If you are also looking for exactly how long to knead, 5-10 minutes will give you a nice smooth dough. Also to echo another person's post, a second rise is always crucial. 30 minutes worked. Thank you for an awesome recipe :). .

To say I love this recipe is an understatement.  Its probably my favorite recipe I have found on this site.  It is very simple, easily adaptable to whatever seasonings you prefer/have on hand, and it requires no bread machine.  Be forewarned though - once you make it,  you will be getting requests for this bread from your family every few days!

Too little salt. Needs plenty more, I'll try double next time. Okay otherwise, although I was expecting more flavor for all the herbs.

I was VERY unhappy with this recipe. I always like to try out versions of recipes I already master. But this one came out TOO dry, didn't rise well, and didn't look at all appealing. The herbs are spot on, but it just didn't work. And I DID follow the recipe! Thank you for your recipe input. But this one IS NOT for me.

This recipe is fantastic and SO easy to make! Because it doesn't take very long to put together, I'll be making it often. As Baricat suggested, I used whole milk (instead of water) to proof my yeast and used fresh, minced garlic (3 cloves) instead of garlic powder. I had fresh basil on hand, so chopped up about 2 T. of it instead of using dried. What a difference fresh herbs make. I can't wait to try this recipe for pizza dough!

Loved this recipe. Did things a little differently. I Did proof the yeast. Only had 1 pack of yeast which said it was 1/4th of a tablespoon...so i used that yeast. Used 1 cup of bread flour and one cup of regular ( all purpose flour). Used all fresh herbs that made it taste amazing! Did not use garlic powder, i used garlic infused olive oil and some minced garlic. I shaped the dough on the cookie sheet and let it rise for 20 minutes, pressed it back down and let it rise for another 20 minutes. Baked it at 375 for 20 minutes, then put the cheese on and cooked it for another 10 minutes. Let it cool on the wire rack. Move over Panera!!! This bread is amazing!

Usually when making good bread, it is kind of intimidating.  Not this one.  It is EASY!!!  And the aroma of all of the seasonings is wonderful!!!  Give it a try.  Thanks so much.  I will definately make this one again.

I used to bake in a NJ casino for 10 years, and we always made focaccia for the restaurants.  This recipe was very easy to put together. I warmed the water before I added it though because I was paranoid my yeast wouldn't rise.  The only herbs I wanted in it were the garlic powder, a small amount of parmesan, and fresh rosemary from my garden. I didn't want the mozzarella. I'm sure the listed herbs are good too, but I had to have rosemary.  It came out superb!  I really drenched it in olive oil after to make it irresistible!

Its great simple quick and easy. I didnt have all of the spices but i had italian seasoning so i used two tablespoons of that instead. I added  minced garlic after the olive oil  then a sprinkling of the spices then parsarum then a small sprinkling of mozzarella. Was great love it will make it again. Oh did proof the yeast and rose very quickly and easyly.

i made it twice this week! I use my bread machine to make the dough so its super easy and simple. First we had it as a side to our pasta then we invited a friend over and used it to make fontina and prosciutto sandwiches. It was delicious.I will say that it truly must be eaten right out of the oven to be able to appreciate it fully.

I followed the directions to a "T" and discovered this recipe has way too much spice for my taste.  If I make this a second time I will be sure to reduce the amount of the spices and totally omit the parmesan cheese.  Not a hit with my family.    I think this would make a fine pizza crust with a little tweaking.

I made this in my bread machine and it was a breeze.  I proofed the yeast with the sugar for 10 minutes first.  I did add 1/4 cup of milk powder and it came out so fluffy and delicious.  I caramelized sliced purple onion and put it on top with the cheese, but I did this after 10 minutes in the oven so it wouldn´t burn.

This bread will definitely be made more often in my house.  It is simple, easy to make and we made the double batch right off the bat because it was easier and it made sure that we had leftovers to go with dinner tomorrow.  All in all, I think when I make the double batch, I will probably end up halving the basil because it came out a bit too strong on that regard.  

However, decidedly a five star bread and so chewy and flavorful, it went fantastic with dinner tonight.

great for quick, herby bread.  This is my go-to recipe for a quick focaccia.   Tried it tonight with the milk instead of water as one reviewer suggested & using it for a base crust for a quickie home-made pizza.  It was a hit.

Nothing short of AWESOME!  I proofed the yeast before adding it to the flour and used honey instead of sugar.  I also used all olive oil instead of the veg oil the recipe calls for.  I also did a second rise.

AMAZINGLY tasty and easy recipe! I made sure to proof my yeast first and then add the rest of the ingredients. My house smells like an Italian restaurant right now and my 6 year old has devoured 2 big pieces already! Thanks for a great recipe!

Really enjoyed this.  We didn't proof the yeast, we followed as recipe indicated.  This tastes the closest focaccia we had in Italy (even including restaurants offering focaccia).

Mmm... nothing like hot bread right out of the oven! Super easy. Super fast.

I substituted olive oil for vegetable oil to give it more flavor. The garlic isn't very prominent. I'm not a garlic fan, and I barely noticed the flavor. Definitely increase it if you plan to use it as a garlic bread substitute. I also nixed the cheese topping.

I've made this recipe several times with consistent results. I have even doubled the recipe and it still came out great!

Excellent basic focaccia recipe!! Easy and very quick for a yeast bread so it's a great thing to make if you want fresh bread but don't have a lot of time or energy. The variations are endless. I just made a loaf where I pressed a bunch of green olives and grape tomatoes (cut in half) on top sprinkled with some romano. YUM!

Delicious focaccia bread.  The only change that I made was I used some fresh rosemary and left out the thyme and all of the other dry herbs (I did use garlic powder though).  It came out wonderful!

I subbed 1/2 c whole wheat flour. I felt it was too dense, and I wished the inside had more airpockets. It's not bad, but needs a few changes. Maybe real garlic clove/herbs? Maybe melted butter instead of oil? If you make this, add the cheese a few minutes before removing it from the oven, or your cheese will burn.

I made this recipe after reading the terrific reviews.  I followed directions except used a blend of mozzarella, asiago, and parmesan cheese on top.  It really turned out like pizza dough... baked without toppings!  I would caution be sure not to overbake, as perhaps 2 fewer minutes in the oven would have helped.  I may try again, watch the oven like a hawk, and try putting rosemary on the top.  This recipe was easy but not amazing.

This bread has a wonderful flavor and texture.  I used half the garlic and twice the basil.  I also mixed the yeast, water, and sugar first and let it foam a bit before adding the other ingredients.  I let it rise twice and punched it done both times before baking it.  It is so easy to make, I will do it again and use it for sandwich bread.  The seasoning possibilities are endless.  I may add sun dried tomatoes and black olives to the dough.

Okay, so this recipe was pretty good, BUT I changed some things which I think helped a bit. Instead of 1 cup of water, I used 3/4 cup of warm milk and 1/4 cup of warm water. Also, I added the 1 tbsp. of vegetable oil AND an additional 2 teaspoons of olive oil. My bread came out very dense and the flavor combination was quite warm, which I attribute to the milk and olive oil. :)    I have a food blog and I talked about this.

Yummy, fun and easy!  I replaced the oregano, thyme and basil with 3 tsp of Herbes de Provence and added chopped garlic.  I'd like to try adding sun dried tomatoes next time and maybe even another tsp of Herbes de Provence.

My dough didn't rise - but I know nothing about yeast and didn't proof it. Even though it didn't rise, I made it into focaccia flat bread and it was delicious.

All I can say is YUM. The only change I made to this recipe is to use warm water instead of cold which I think helped with the rising problem others commented about. I WILL be making this again.

Ok, so I am Bread Baking challenged, so I never try to make anything with yeast. i really wanted to make this so I did, followed directions EXACTLY, and yet, bread so thin. = ( All of the great reviews brings me to the conclusion it is probrably just me. It did taste alright, but it reminds me of pizza crust with a little cheese on it. So, I guess I will ban myself from making bread again, and at least it wasn't as bad as the time I made hamburger buns lol. All in all it was ok, just not what I wanted

I sprinkle cornmeal on the bottom of my pan to give the bread a crunchy, non-stick base.

This is a great, quick bread recipe. This is perfect if you want some homemade bread to go with your meal but don't have the hours of spare time to make it happen. Very tasty! Also, the point of proofing yeast is to make sure it is still active. If you are sure your yeast is active (you bought it from a reliable source yesterday), you don't need to. If you are improperly storing your yeast or it is old, definitely proof it. I have met many people who think that bread will not rise without proofing, but that is simply not true if you know your yeast is good. There are many other reasons bread can fail to rise.

I love this recipe. I had hoped to duplicate the Rosemary Focaccia bread from Wholefoods Market, and while this recipe didn't get the light fluffiness I was looking for it became a perfect fit for pizza dough. Crazy idea? maybe, but my family enjoys it!

This recipe was easy to follow and came out perfect the first time! I used regular active yeast and was sure to use very warm (120 degree) water. I used f2 cloves of fresh garlic instead of the garlic powder, dried rosemary and basil from my garden, and omitted the mozzarella since I had none on hand. The crust came out golden, and the bread was tender and flavorful. A perfect accompaniment for pasta tonight! This may wind up being my go-to for pizza crust. I will try doubling next time.

I used Rapid Rise yeast so I could immediately shape the bread and let it rise only 1 time.  I subbed fresh garlic instead of using garlic powder and used the herbs of my choice.  Very quick and easy and the family loved it!

I just pulled this out of the oven and it tastes great! I mixed the sugar, water, and yeast together first. Then dumped everything else in the bread machine along with the yeast mixture after it was foamy. I let the machine do the kneading, only about 20 minutes on the dough cycle and then let it rise. I got a french bread looking loaf, which is what I wanted. I'm going to cut it horizontally and use it for grilled veggie sandwiches. I omitted the mozzarella because the sandwiches are going to have feta cheese on them. I also used fresh oregano and basil from my garden. Thanks for sharing the recipe. I will definitely make it again.

Yum! I made this bread again today, and it came out even better than last time. I only kneaded for a couple of minutes and let the dough rise for 30 minutes. I set the oven to 425 and baked for 20 minutes. Before baking, I brushed the dough with sun-dried tomato infused olive oil and sprinkled onions, olives, sun dried tomatoes, and parmesan. My tomatoes burned so I will probably leave them out or put them on half way through baking next time. The dough came out sooo fluffy and soft! Delicious!

Great!  I proofed my yeast with sugar in 1/3 cup warm water.  Then I added rest of ingredients using 2/3 cup milk as an expert reviewer advised. Added rosemary, too.  I put a few sliced ripe olives on top, baked for 9 minutes, then added cheeses and finished baking.  I made one round loaf for dinner, and the other half of dough is in the freezer, waiting to be thawed, formed, baked, and split horizontally later for a fabulous gourmet Italian sandwich.  It's a picnic!

The bread produced is quite good.  It was personally a little dry, but I've only tried once, so maybe I'll take it out of the oven sooner next time. I also left out the mozzarella since I didn't have any.  The directions could be edited for novice bread-makers (like me - I read reviews and let it rise twice).  Overall, very good bread as it is, and it's easily tweakable with sun-dried tomatoes, olives and whatever your hungry heart desires.

Hard to believe, with all this stuff in it and on it, but the bread itself is kind of bland.

Very easy to make, but mine came out a little dry and the cheese got too dark on top.

I cooked this for the estimated cook time and it ended up coming out alittle burned. No biggie though, just watch the time. Even though the tops/bottems were burned, the bread inside was soo soft and chewy. Still was pretty good, I bet it will be better next time. I used milk in replace of water. I threw in roasted garlic into the bread, which left little tiny chunks of garlic in the bread. Soo tasty!

I gave this recipe a try and I'm afraid I don't care for the texture nor the spices mixed into the dough.  I've had focaccia in the past where olive oil and spices are rubbed into the top.  I think I like the spices on top better.  It doesn't overwhelm the taste of the bread.

This bread is fantastic!  I reduced the cheese topping by about 1/2 because I'm lactose intolerant.  It comes out great every time.  Thank you for a nice, quick bread!

Pretty good recipe. I added a lot more Parmesan cheese on the top because I was making it for friend who loves cheese. Overall, I'd use this recipe again. Simply wonderful!

This is a delicious, easy bread recipe which I've been making for years. I don't think it even needs the mozzarella, which I leave out to cut the fat. It's nice because it only rises once, and doesn't take long to bake or rise. I serve it with olive oil, balsamic vinegar, and herbs for dipping, although it doesn't need this either.

I never have good luck when making a bread that doesn't say to first activate the yeast so sure enough this came out dense as it didn't rise at all after the 20 minutes.  I let it rise for probably 40 minutes and just couln't wait any longer.  The flavor was nice although I did add some rosemary to the top with the cheeses.  I think I might look for a different recipe next time.

This is a solid recipe for focaccia bread. It lends itself well to allot of mods depending on ones own personal taste. Ilike others found it to need a longer cook time than what the recipe called for,,, And remember to proof the yeast!

My first time making focaccia and I think mine came out a little dense (prob my fault) but it's pretty tasty. I do wish I'd let it rise more. It would make a killer pizza crust!

I've never made bread in my life!  I followed the recipe and ended up with a gooey mess all over my table and stuck between my fingers! I continued though and baked it anyway and it came out ok.  It is fluffy but kind of hard.  I've never even had flat bread so I'm not sure if that is how it is suppose to be.  I'm also not a big fan of thyme so next time I wont use as much, and I'll also follow some of the reviewers tips on the yeast (I had no idea you had to mix w/ warm water first)  This is still a great recipe for beginners.

Incredible. I made this for dinner but my family ate it before the rest of the dinner was ready! It's easy, smells amazing, and tastes wonderful. I have made some changes. I put the yeast, sugar, and water in one bowl, and let that sit while I mix the rest. I also do only garlic salt instead of the other seasonings, applesauce in with the flour, and a little extra cheese. A lot of people have asked us for the recipe! IT's delicous!!

I made it tonight and my husband is loving it (We 're eatign it as I'm writing this review). It turned out great even though I'm very new to making yeast bread. My husband said it is the best bread he has ever had. I did switch few things though; I proofed the yeast, substituted self-rising flour for all-purpose, used 2-1/2 tbsp of Italian seasoning & 1 tbsp Herb de Provence, omitted cheese, added a pinch of groung pink peppercorn, and brushed with white truffle oil and sprinkled with coarse salt.We are also dipping it in white truffle oil YUM!!!. My husband requested that I make this bread regularly. THANKS for the great recipe.

Made 2 batches for a birthday party and the plate was practically licked clean. Four people asked for the recipe!  It rose great both times. You just need a warm spot and patience. I put it on top of the oven during the preheating and it was ready in about 25 minutes. Easy-peasy. 

Made one batch with regular white flour, the second with half white/half wheat.  I also used fresh minced garlic instead of powdered and it turned out great! Toppings of choice: sun-dried tomatoes, fresh herbs from the garden, black olives and fresh parmesan. Better even if made a day ahead so the flavors can meld together. YUM!

Excellent recipe, although I did follow the advice of some other reviewers and used milk instead of water.  

I also proofed my yeast in water for 10 minutes before mixing into the dough.  Then allowed dough to rise for about 40 minutes before baking.  

Came out awesome!  Thick, but still the right crumb for this kind of rustic bread.  Will definitely use for pizzas in the future!!

Quick, easy and yummy! I've tried several toppings(?) and my favorite is to brush with an olive oil, minced garlic and kosher salt mix before baking. Cheese is truly optional with this recipe.

Very good for how simple this was to make.  Made the following modifications:
Only did about 1/2 tsp of each herb, also added rosemary.  Omitted mozzarella, drizzled more olive oil on top when it came out of oven.

This recipe yields a wonderful, flavorful bread - that disappeared quickly :) Made a batch that was a bit thicker, it was used for school lunches. 

Also tried this recipe as a pizza crust - the results were wonderful. Added a lot of old time flavor to our pizza night.

I followed the recipe exactly, and overall, it was good. It came out a little tough and dry though. Maybe I worked the dough too much?

I love it s enormous flavor. but the texture is not as soft as the ones I ate at the resturant near my place. I think it is the rising time is too short to make it rise high enough. I will try this one again next time . Thanks for sharing.

I love my yeast breads and this turned out great. I didn't mess with the yeast, and it rose in the oven just fine. The browned cheese is how cheese is supposed to look when you put it on bread. I liked it a lot!

I threw everything in the bread machine and it came out fine. I didn't add the cheese on top, but I added more spices on top. Came out puffy and golden and ready for paninis! Great!

So good! This was a huge hit, and gone in one evening. I added a dash of rosemary to the dough, but otherwise didn't change a thing. Very easy to make, and tasty with a pasta dish. Thank you!

Wow this was good!  Unfortunately after I punched it down it didn't rise again, but it was still wonderful!  I used milk instead of water, and added rosemary.  Very yummy, will definately make again.

This is so tasty!  I've made it a number of times now.  I normally have to make two batches as the children devour it as soon as it's out of the oven.  Tastes great with exquisite pizza sauce by Angie Zayac from this site. I put the whole thing in the food processor for 2 min and then let it rise.  I think I might even try it as pizza dough!  Thanks for posting this recipe.

Good flavor to this dough....however it didn't rise much. Maybe my error. The end result was more like breadsticks.... very yummy! I also used this dough as pizza dough. Top with sauce (spaghetti sauce mixed with a little tomatoe paste), cheese, and other toppings. VERY YUMMY! Thanks!!!

Fabulous.  Great texture.  Sea salt sprinkling on top is a good idea if your diet allows.

I absolutely love to make this recipe.   I have found it to be quite versatile and have added a number of different toppings in place of the cheese; for example, my personal favorite is to add caramelized butternut squash and goat cheese.  Other toppings have included tomatoes and fresh basil as well as homemade pizza sauce and mozzarella.  Thanks for posting this recipe!

I make this when we have company coming.  It's easy and smells soooo good in the oven.  I like to have sprinkled cheese on top and then have marinara and olive oil for dipping afterwards.

I've never made any type of bread before, and though I did it all by hand, I found it incredibly easy. I needed a bit more water than the recipe called for (the dough was too dry otherwise), and I let it rise for 40 minutes instead of 20. I also proofed the yeast before adding it in. Came out great, but a bit dry and lacking in flavor. I'll try adding in some other goodies next time.

***UPDATE****

Gave this recipe another star. I decided to try it out again. I didn't use a bread machine and used butter instead of olive oil (and plan on using melted butter instead of vegetable oil when I make it again). Brushed the top with melted butter and minced garlic (fresh). Came out a bit flat, but it made some AWESOME breadsticks for dipping. So...another star it is.

This bread is so good!  I made the dough in the breadmaker, then patted it out onto a baking stone and let it rise a little before baking.  I did find that after 15 minutes in the oven the bread was perfectly baked, but the cheese was really brown.  However, I think it would be just as good without the cheese.  I think next time I'll just rub it with olive oil and sprinkle with coarse salt.

Can I rate it a 10?  I've made this recipe a couple of times and it's great! The first time I made it I used sliced olives and cheese on top. Tonight I didn't have any olives so I used italian spices and cheese. My whole family loves it. The only problem I have is there's never any leftovers!

I made this but just topped it with olive oil prior to baking....left off the cheese.  I used the bread machine to mix the dough.  I let it rise covered in my oven.

I didn't care for this recipe. I followed the recipe exactly and the bread came out dry and densed, nothing like focaccia bread suppose to taste like.  Thank you though.

Made this in the bread machine following the ingredients list and it turned out tasty, but not amazingly good like I expected from all the reviews. I might try it again, but it won't be a staple in my recipe box.

I love this Focaccia bread. The cheese came out a bit darker than I would have liked, but I am pretty sure thats my fault, lol. The recipe was YUMMY, and I would DEFINITELY be making it again.

This is so good!  It's not really like other focaccia bread I've had, so I'm not sure about the name, but the taste is amazing, regardless of what it is called!  I made the dough in my bread machine and used 2 TBSP of olive oil, and still had to add a bit of water to get the dough to come together.  It rose for about 1 hour, then I pounded it down and placed it on the baking sheet, on top of parchment paper.  I spread olive oil on top, then added garlic powder in addition to the cheeses.  Then I let it sit out for another 20 minutes.  It was SO good!  It would be amazing pizza dough, and I am going to try that the next time I make homemade pizza!  Try it, you won't be sorry!

This is absolutely fantastic.  I make it several times a week and we eat it as a snack in the evening.  Just dip it into some olive oil and balsamic vinegar and you've got quite the treat.  Thanks for sharing.

Excellent.  I did not use the herbs listed.  Instead, I sauteed onion and garlic and kneaded it -- along with mozzarella -- into the dough.  Yum!

Very fragrant, but dense It was quick and easy...I was out of active dry yeast and I used rapid dry yeast not sure if that made a difference.

This was pretty good although I'm still on the fence as to whether it is as moist as the focaccia bread I am used to.  My dough did not rise that much in 20 mins even though I prepped the yeast, but then again, the AC in my house may have played a role.  I will try this one again.

I used my bread machine to do the mixing on the dough cycle, then I let it rise an extra 15 minutes after shaping it on the pan.  It rose very high while baking, too much for a traditional looking focaccia but it tasted wonderful!  It did not need that extra 15 minute rise.  I will use this recipe again.  The focaccia made wonderful 'buns' for some grilled portobella mushooms, yummy!

Bread was good - this was my first attempt at focaccia and it turned out pretty well - served it with dipping oils.  The seasonings weren't as flavorful as I had hoped - will definitely keep trying!

I am so proud of myself...with your recipe (and the tips of other reviewers) I was able to make a wonderful bread that my whole family enjoyed! I proofed the yeast and played with the spices a bit, but didn't change anything else. This was my first real attempt at bread and I have to say I did a fine job! Thank you!!!

This bread was good.  I'm not dying to make it again except that it was fairly easy, used ingrients I always have on hand & was pretty quick to make too. Don't have to wait hours for the dough to rise.

Extremely nice.  I used onion powder, fresh rosemary and fresh basil rather than your suggestions.  Also, I tossed the prep instructions and mixed/kneaded/let rise as I would any loaf of yeast bread.  Wonderful aroma.

I've never made bread (without a machine : ) before, and thought this would be an easy way to start. I wouldn't have known to proof the yeast based on the recipe. Thankfully, I read some reviews first! The bread   turned out great, and was so easy. I added chopped kalamatas to the top, and played with the herbs a little.

I had my 12 year old make this the other night while I was putting soup together. He didn't alter the recipe at all. We did mix fresh chopped garlic with the olive oil to brush on top before baking. It turned out easy, very tasty and way less expensive then what you can get at the grocery store.

This was excellent!

NOTE: I heeded the advice of the other reviewers and proofed the yeast first, and then let it rise for about another half hour before punching the dough down and shaping it. For those who can imagine, it turned out just like the Boboli pizza crusts that you buy at the grocery store, but rose about twice the  height. 

Thank you for this great recipe and the tips from all of the reviewers - it was not only a major HIT at the office, but also a hit at my husbands job!

This bread was delicious!  I made it as part of an Italian-themed luncheon for my friends.  Since I didn't have any thyme, I left it out.  Next time I'll defintely add some because without it, the bread tasted like there was something missing.  I let it rise too long while I was preparing the other foods, so it came out a little bigger than expected.  My friends devoured it!  Great recipe.

Very tasty, but a little time-consuming due to the yeast.  Still, the results are so good; comprable to that of higher end resturants IMO.

My yeast had expired, so it didn't raise right.  I will try again but will review all the reviews before-- it seemed really dry to me.  Still, the flavor was good!  I'm sure I'll figure it out so it's just right for us.

I actually used this recipe to make a deep pizza base - it didn't rise - but it did make a fantastic thin crust pizza. The combination of the herbs and garlic were spot on - absolutely gorgeous. Perfectly crisp outside and chewy in the middle.  Not sure if I did anything wrong, but I will give it another go (well I am a terrible cook so I will give this 5 stars).

Delicious! I cut back a little on the herbs to see how my kids would like it. Huge hit! Next time I will add the full amounts.

I made this bread twice today.  I love it.  My step son who is a very picky eater loved it.  My nephew came down today and tried it and loved it so much that I had to make another batch, this time putting pepperoni on it.  They dipped it in warm pizza sauce.  I called it dinner.  They were happy and so was I.  It was easy and quick and very delicious.  Thanks

By far the best recipe for foccacia I have ever found! I have been using this recipe for two years now, and every time has been a success!  I love using it for calzones and homemade pizzas.

I love this stuff!! You can really fool around and get creative with the spices in it. Usually I tend to just have a shaker of Italian seasoning on hand and I'll add nearly a tablespoon of that instead of the oregano, thyme and basil. I've also put slices of fresh tomato and basil leaves on top along with the cheese before baking. It's more like pizza then, but really good. It says to serve it warm and it is best that way but I've also eaten it the next day cold and it was still very good.

My first time making bread! Very easy to make (I used a quisinart to mix the dough), smells wonderful while cooking. The dough didn't rise that much (even with warm water), and bread came out rather dense, but tasted good regardless. Wonderful served with olive oil, and presentation is wonderful with melted cheese on top. Will definitely make this again! Gave it 4 stars because it lacks the extra "oomph" that similar restaurant breads have...Missing something, but it is still very good.

A bit too "herb-y" for me but really awesome with ranch dressing. This was my first bread and I was pretty impressed. I thought I'd be smart and mix the yeast with warm water and sugar, thinking it would help it rise, It didnt. lol My dough didnt rise in the bowl at all, but somehow it turned out good. Thanks for the recipe.

I made this after using the website conversion option and turned into a wonderful sauteed chicken, mushroom and caramelized onion pizza, without sauce. Too much in the way of herbs for me but I plan to use this recipe again and adjust the herbs for my taste. And I love the ease of the recipe! No 'blooming' the yeast and only one rising is a major plus!

A keeper! I've made this a few times now and it is so easy and so yummy. In fact the last time I made it for company they couldn't believe it was homemade-how professional it turned out. The hardest part is getting the dough to form a rectangle and each time I make it this becomes easier and easier to accomplish. I highly recommend this very easy and scrumptious recipe!!

Appearance: Exactly as I hoped. Texture: Spot-on. Aroma: Out-of-this-world. Taste: A little too bland for my liking (but still very good). I will definitely make this again but will add a lot more herbs (fresh probably). I really like others' suggestions about topping with coarse salt; I think that would be wonderful. Thanks, Terri. Great recipe!

This is a great recipe for fresh hot bread in 45 mintutes. I had the same problem as other reviewers in that the dough hardly rose at all. It was good as a dense bread, but next time I may try rapid-rise yeast, or mixing the yeast and warm water and sugar to activate the yeast before mixing in the flour and herbs. I also found it a little bland. Overall, not mind-blowing, but a good quick solution for a pasta accompaniment. I'll probably keep playing around with it. Thanks, Terri!

I made this today. I soaked the yeast in warm water and sugar but it didn't really fluff enough. I would allow the bread to rise for longer then 20 minutes as it didn't rise enough for me. Also make sure u preheat the oven as soon as you start the mixture or it wont cook through. I added 3 tblsp of fresh thyme and 3 tblsp of fresh rosemary. I used about 4 tblsp of fresh parmesan and no mozzarella. It was delicious. I will make this again

Awesome tasty bread that I have made again and again!! I too let the yeast, sugar and warm water froth before mixing the rest in. I've also used this recipe as a pizza base with great success. Garlic bread version - split dough in two, scoring the tops and spread with with lots of herbed garlic butter and bake - simply delicious!!

I'm a college student so you can imagine how much i cook :)  Anyway, this looked really easy so i tried it and this is definitely a recipe for any beginner to try. It turned out great, i just didn't add enough herbs throughout. But everyone loved it and complimented on it's appearance too. Try it out!

We also loved this recipe!  It was nice to make it homemade as to buying it at the store. Let the dough rise a little longer than instructed... I also added fresh garlic cloves for an extra kick!Thank you for this great recipe!

Excellent! After finding this recipe we no longer have that old store bought garlic bread with our spagetti. This is a must at our house. And I've made it for a community event with raves.

Most requested recipe by my family!  Can change recipe by adding different ingredients as topping... fresh mushrooms, onions, fresh basil leaves... the combinations are endless.

This was such a good recipe.  It was so incredibly easy.  My 3-year-old made it with me; she had a blast.  I would have liked it to be a bit chewier- does anyone have any suggestions?

I made this bread today and it was so good. I sprinkled Kosher salt and fresh grated Parmesan cheese on top. I also let it raise again before baking it.  I will make this again.

Made this for a soup and salad dinner party, it was excellent.  Used Monteray Jack cheese because that's all we had, but it was still very good.

This bread was fabulous!  It browned nicely on top, and there was melted cheese underneath.  What an awesome combination.  And it was easy!  Thanks so much!

I thought this was good. It's denser than other recipes I have used before. I used fresh rosemary and pesto to put in the dough.

This is s such good bread. I was making Focaccia bread using another recipe but this is the best. My husband ate the whole loaf the first time I made it. My father thought it was better than bread from high end bakeries. Plus its so quick compared to other recipes the rising time is relitivly short. If I could give it 6 stars I would!! ITs great. I also use olive oil instead of vegetable oil. And I use as pizza crust dough.

I was having a bad cooking night, and it seemed I destroyed everything I touched.  I burned the cheese on this, and the bread still seemed to taste pretty good.  However, the dough didn't seem to rise much in that 20 mins that it's supposed to.  I don't know a lot about focaccia bread, so maybe that's how it should turn out.  Anyway, even with my faux pas, it still went great with spaghetti, and I will try to make this again!

This is the first time I have made focaccia bread and it was really good.  I left out the oregano and thyme and added a little rosemary mixture that I had.  I also added about 1/2 cup of cheddar instead of the mozzarella.  It was SO good and is great with a creamy pasta to dip the bread in!

I replaced 1/2 of the white with whole wheat flour. I also added lots more salt, per some recommendations: 1/2 T garlic salt, 1/2 T salt, and 1/2 T onion powder (Plus, my husband is a big fan of salt, don't ya know). I left off the cheese, thinking maybe we'd thrown some roasted veggies on it for dinner, but it's terrific as is. Definitely a keeper!

VERY easy and quick!!!  The possibilities of this one are endless.  I tried it without the mozzarella first (adding more parmesan) and immediately I wanted to experiment by adding everything else.  This recipe will be kept on "standby" as an addition to just about any meal.

Oh my gosh!  This is a great recipe! I made it on Friday with spaghetti and the three of us practically ate the whole thing! We loved it so much I used it as a pizza crust on Sunday for company (EVERYONE raved about it, even the kids) I made up the crust as usual, but didn't add the olive oil or cheeses to the top, then i baked it for about five minutes before putting on the pizza toppings, NO LEFTOVERS! I'm embarrassed to say I had never heard of this before seeing this recipe, but I am VERY glad i found it!  Thanks so much for a wonderful recipe!!

This is a wonderful recipe. Today I used the dough as a pizza base which was very successful. I have made it several times and it always works. I serve it with Hummus and a tomato salad as a snack.

I am always worried when working with yeast, but this was really easy. I used caramelized onions, roasted red pepper and a little garlic. It turned out great. This recipe is a keeper.

I am always looking for great recipes.  This one was excellent! "Anyone who has problems with this one doesn't know how to cook."(A quote from my twelve-year-old)I gave some to my  resturant critical brother, who now wants the recipe. He said it was very good. Keep it coming Terri!My babies did not get a chance to try it, because it was gone.

I made this with my 6-year old daughter and it turned out perfectly! Its hand-on and reasonably fast to prepare. We added diced fresh tomato, chopped black olives and a little feta cheese to the recipe just for fun. I can think of lots of other stuff that will work just as well. Try it and enjoy!!

Very easy. I let it rise longer than 20 minutes and it turned out fabulously. Stay fresh for a few days afterwards.

This is the perfect focaccia recipe! It's just what I've tasted in restaurants and soooo easy to make. I didn't have all the spices at hand, only basil, garlig powder and pepper, but it still turned out great! This is a 110% keeper! Thank you!

I always used to buy the focaccia bread mixes at the store but never again.  This recipie is far better that the mixes or any other focaccia bread that I have tried.  I really liked the cheese on the top!  Thanks Terri!

My 18 yr.old daughter made this for a special dinner and we all loved it, even me who is not a bread eater.  It is so easy and good it could be made for any meal not just a special one.

I found this recipe at 6.30pm and by 7.30pm it was on the table. I felt sure that it would turn out a flop like other yeast inclusive recipes I've tried, but it came out perfectly. I think next time I'll add sundried tomatoes too, and it will be even better! At last, a no-fail recipe I can whip up for and easy accompanyment to a meal, or a meal in itself!

This yeast bread is so simple to make and has so many possible variations you could make it every day. The only adjustment I made was adding more salt.

This is a great recipe!  We absolutely loved it, and I will be preparing it often.  My 2-year-old grandson even liked it, and he's extremely picky.  I prepared it on the dough setting on my bread machine, so it was super easy.  A keeper!

Just tasted it right out of the oven and it is delicious.  I did not add the mozzarella, but I think I will next time.  I think I will add some sliced garlic to the dough next time as well.  I also think it might need a little more salt.  It was very easy and quick and much much better than resorting to the canned garlic sticks!
