FABULOUS!  I took it to a church function and it was gone!!  I did two large tomatoes, 1 cucumber, green onions, 2 eggs, and 1/4 c. shredded parmesan...eveything that I had on hand.  I added the crackers last and after 2 hours they were soggy but still good.  SO EASY!

This is another comfort food for me. I first learned how to make this via Paula Deen(this is her recipe)and I make this about once a month. I usually add some Frank's and sometimes, shredded sharp cheddar. Make this right before you eat/serve it, it gets soggy easily.

Very good recipe (from Lady ahd Son's).  When I saw her make it....I thought there was no way that this could be good...was I wrong.  You do need to eat this right away...it does not keep at all.  Thanks for the recipe.

What a treat for my Southern family! Nice fresh, summery taste that's not spicy. Tastes like something my mom would have made when times were lean. This would have been 5 stars if not for the need for last-minute preparation. I doubled all the ingredients except the mayo, which I halved. Also added black pepper. I did assemble everything except for the crackers, then added those with each individual serving. I'd like to try this with sour cream instead of mayo, and serve as a spread for crackers of any kind.

This is phenomenal! Who knew??? I mixed everything except the crackers ahead of time. Crushed & added the crackers as we were lining up to eat. We loved it so much I'm making it for another get-together this weekend! Thank you!!!

Everyone, while they thought it was weird, loved it enough to have seconds!  I think I'll add crisp bacon bits next time.

I made this last night from The Lady and Sons cookbook.  I searched on Allrecipes today to possibly find a variation.  While it was definitely delicious as is and I'll make this again for sure, it needed a little something more.  Next time I'll add some chopped red onion and a few more shakes of black pepper.  I highly suggest using less mayo, you can always add more later if you need it.  As for potlucks, picnics, etc. it would be perfect - just bring the crackers separately in a baggie and add right before serving.  Taste and ease of prep = *5*!

this is a good recipe, i was looking for a different egg salad recipe that i could make with not a lot of ingredients (its the night before my husband and i usually go grocery shopping so we were running low) & i liked the idea of putting crackers into it before serving. i normally eat egg salad with plain potato chips, but didnt have any and the crackers were a nice substitute. i didn't have any tomato, & i used a white onion rather than green. i also added in some bacon bits & used light miracle whip to taste. it was very, very good! thank you

This is a great recipe.  It's been a favorite for a while from "lady & son's."  However, I add onions.  It adds just the right touch.  Also, crackers can only be added right before it is served!!! Thanks for sharing!!!

I used grape tomatoes and cut them in half, but otherwise made as is.  I was a bit leary of this, thinking the crackers were a weird idea and would get all mushy.  Well, it didn't get all mushy but it does definitely need to be eaten right away.  I thought it was way too much mayo.  I went ahead and put it all in because normally I think things are too dry and have too little of whatever dressing, but this was just too much.  I rarely say that.  It wasn't bad, but only a little was good... and I doubted it would be any good if I left the rest for later.  So, I won't be making it again.

With no offense meant to the submitter, I have to say this is the weirdest thing I've ever made. And that one word, weird, sums up this salad for me. It was interesting to try but I won't make it again.

My mom always made this for summer cookouts, so I grew up on this. I made it for my family and now my grand kids. (That is how long this recipe has been around!) Everyone loves it. The only thing I add that is not listed is celery seeds (not celery salt). This salad is not only good with BBQ chicken or pork, but is great along side a grilled steak. We always had a debate on whether this was better the next day or not. Some liked the soft crackers and melded flavors while some liked crisp crackers (soggy bread haters). I like both.

As a good southern girl, I had to try this.  I ignored the nutrition breakdown thinking I had eaten well all week and it would be a special treat, so reduced the mayo as others suggested then I halved the recipe for my husband and myself.  We both love all of the ingredients individually & in other recipes so I was confident it was going to be 'lip-smacking delicious'.  I'm sorry to say I was wrong. We didn't care for it. I salvaged the meal by adding a can of drained tuna but I will not make this again.

First time for trying a salad recipe like this one.  I actually made a small batch of this and a small batch of 'Cracker Salad' from AR.  My husband and the neighbor man both liked this recipe the best.  It is good and different.  I added the crushed crackers right before serving so that there would still be texture to the salad.

This is very addicting. The first couple times I made as is, but now I add a couple extra eggs. I suggest you make it with a cup of mayo then add more if you think it needs it.

I was extremely surprised at how tasty this was. It doesn't keep very well - it got soggy fast - and it might benefit from a little garlic powder, but it is still a very quick and easy little dish. Thanks!
