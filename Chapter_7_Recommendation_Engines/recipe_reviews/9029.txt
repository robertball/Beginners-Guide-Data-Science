I was so confused about how I was supposed to make this because, to me, when you say slow cooker I think crock pot. Obviously, in order to begin with it boiling I just went ahead and did it on top of the stove. I didn't have chili sauce so I used a package of dry taco seasoning and it was fine. But 6 hours of simmering boneless chicken on top of the stove (or in the crock pot) is WAY too long. I used bone-in thighs and after about 3 hours I had tasty, tender chicken. The ingredients are great and the flavors good, but the directions here cannot be trusted.

This dish has potential.  Unfortunately, the directions do not correspond with my slow cooker, and it cooked way too fast.  Fortunately, I rescued it before it was overdone and still had it for dinner.  The spices were missing some notes.  Needed salt, for one.  I'll have to experiment to get it to my own taste.  

Overall, great recipe.  You might need to fiddle with it in order to get it to cook right for your model of cooker.

the recipe turned out well, substituted chicken breasts instead of the thighs, used fresh & dehydrated red/yellow peppers, and couldn't find chili sauce so I used enchilada sauce.. instead of cooking the chicken first then adding everything, I just put everything in all at once and cooked it for the same amount of time. the family loved it :)

A little too sweet for my husband and me -- and I too found the recipe somewhat confusing.  I boiled the water, poured it onto the chicken in the crock pot -- then when the check turned white, I took most of the water out -- and added the sauces.  I cooked it for six hours, added 1-1/2 cups of uncooked rice and cooked it an additional hour.  I liked it more than DH, I liked the chicken -- but the flavor was too 'off' to be all that appetizing.  And was I really supposed to pour off the water?  It would have been way to 'soupy' if I hadn't.

Probably the best slowcooker chicken I've had to date.  Awesome to come home from work and have this mean ready for you.  I served it on rice.

I decided to change things up a bit while making this recipe. I cooked the chicken thighs in a can of diced tomatoes, then added the peppers and onions, left out the ketchup and chili sauce (keeping things simple and didn't have the chili sauce on hand). Served with roasted potatoes and broccoli.

I did not care for this recipe. It had no flavor to it other than a ketchup taste.  Will definitely not be making again.

This was simple, healthy and delicious over rice. I skipped the water and just threw everything in the slow cooker on low for 8 hours.  Paired nicely with thinly sliced hard sausage and red wine... reminiscent of Spain :)

This was so good. My whole family loved it. We loved it so much that we made it 2 nights in a row for our dinner guests. 
The second round I doubled the recipe, cut up the chicken into bite size pieces, which we preferred and added more veggies (corn, zuchinni). Thanks for the awesome/easy recipe!

I followed the recipe to the letter and found it was quite good. I shredded the chicken and served it over baked potatoes and then saved the sauce for another day which I again served over baked potatoes.
