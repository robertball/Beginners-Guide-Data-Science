Thank you so much for this recipe!  I’ve been searching for a vegan cake mix cookie recipe for some time after seeing “Grinch Cookies” on Pinterest.  Because it’s not quite time for the Grinch, we made monster cookies and I’m so thrilled with how they turned out! We chilled the dough for 3-4 hours before baking because I’m my experience I’ve noticed vegan cookies spread a lot if not chilled.  We used Duncan Hines white cake mix and vanilla pudding mix, and added a few drops of green food coloring.  They’re very moist and my 4 year old is ecstatic!
