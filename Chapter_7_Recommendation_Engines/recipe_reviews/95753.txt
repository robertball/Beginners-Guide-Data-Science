I tried this recipe today because it sounded good and I had all the ingredients in my pantry.  It tasted fine, I would make it again if I were in need of a quick meal, but I just found it okay.  I wouldn't go out of my way and plan on making it.  I found that it didn't come together at all, when you put it on your plate it just falls apart, it's just a bunch of cubed chicken and beans, there is really no need to put it in the oven, you could skip the tortillas (they're awkward as a crust anyways) melt the cheese on top of the stove and then maybe wrap it all in flour tortillas.  That would be better I think.  I would not make it to drop off at someone's house, it's just not that good; but it is an okay quick meal.

this recipe was really yummy. I did add a few things to it like black olives, 
I also put enchilada sauce on bottom of cake pan so shells wouldn't stick. And on tortilla shells spread refried beans on them put chicken mixture in and topped with a little more enchilada sauce. cilantro and  cheese

I made this recipe last week and I thought it was absolutely great.  I actually passed it on to my mexican friend who loves enchiladas but has a 2 year old and no time for prep these days.  It was so easy and it tasted fabulous, just like an enchilada, minus the time investment.  I love the idea below of substituting the tortillas for chips, that would make it perfecto!  It is definitely not a meal that you want to make if you're looking for something that looks pretty.  I did it in a casserole dish, cut it in to squares w/a pizza cutter and served.  It did fall apart, but I wasn't looking to impress with presentation, so that was okay.  I stored the rest for lunch all week and everyone at work kept asking what smelled so good.  The other thing that I love is that it is packed with nutrient dense ingredients that have lots of fiber, whole products and protein.  It's a perfect and healthy (if you go light on the cheese) family meal.  I give it an a+++

I LOVED this recipe. I'm new to cooking, so when I say this was easy to make. I mean it. The best thing for this recipe is to make sure you have all of your ingredients chopped up and ready to cook. Otherwise you might burn the meat if you’re off chopping more veggies. I also substituted the chicken with ground beef. And it was still great. One of the things I might changed about this is instead of having full corn tortilla on the bottom of the pan, I would make it have chips. Just because when I cooked it, it was hard to cut, as well eat. My family just ended up scraping off the tortilla and just using chips instead. Something to think about before you cook it. The taste was GREAT. And I’m a picky eater so to say that, it really means something. Try it! You’ll never want to lose this fabulous recipe.

i put chips on the bottom as suggested and next time would probably layer them throughout because this is just like nachos. delicious. instead of a taco seasoning packet i used cumin, paprika, chili powder and garlic salt. i'll add more cayenne next time. this is easy and yummy.

I really liked this casserole!  I made only one change to the original recipe - after reading the reviews, I decided to use the crunchy tostada shells (like a flat crispy taco shell), broken into 2 or 3 pieces and laid on the bottom of the pan instead of regular corn tortillas.  This came out to a nice crumbly corn crust for the casserole, and I can see how regular corn tortillas could probably be mushier and harder to cut if used. i will definitely use the tostadas again the next time b/c i really liked the flavor it added.  Otherwise I thought this was a great recipe as is.  I served it with a dollop of sour cream, salsa, and some diced avocados on top, and spanish rice as a side.  Easy, great thing to have in the frig for leftovers, something to leave for the babysitter, etc.  I made it for a friend who just had a baby and they really liked it, too, it's a comfort food type of dish.  I also like that is uses mostly whole ingredients, not a bunch of processed stuff!

So YUM! I used ground turkey, made my own taco seasoning (less sodium) reduced the cumin and skipped the cilantro. I layered this like a lasagna using enchilada sauce on the bottom and between the layers. I can't wait to have the leftovers for lunch today! Thank you Anne!!

This is good to use with pantry/on hand ingredients. I used only one can of organic black beans and omitted the kidney beans. I used my own homemade taco seasoning. I also used a corn-flour tortilla blend. This was super easy to throw together though it wasn't a huge hit, which was a surprize. It was quite dry. I think had I been thinking, I'd have added in some homemade enchilada sauce. This would make a good nacho topping. Just when it's baked, it's just....dry. I made my own casa (mexican sour cream) dressing over the top which helped.

This was really good.  The kids had a hard time with the pepperjack cheese but we loved it!  I used just Black Beans because we do not like kidneys.

My picky husband hates corn tortillas and he ate this twice. We don't eat black beans but I did add the refried beans like someone else had said. I didn't have the cheese they asked for but my family prefer cheddar cheese. It was soo good. Next time I will probably add some green chilies for some heat. Will definately make again.

Yes, funky indeed, as I didn't see much resemblance to actual enchiladas, (other than the flavors being of the Mexican-variety), but wow, did we woof this meal down! I would recommend not bothering w/ baking it at all and simply sprinkling your own toppings on it right out of the skillet. As most reviewers said, it doesn't really have a casserole appearance when scooped out of the pan, so it just seemed like a waste of energy and heat to run the oven at all. Other (small) adjustments -- I went heavy on the "Taco Seasoning I" recipe, used green and yellow peppers, used an 11 oz. can Mexi-corn, and only 2 cans beans. (Black & Red.) The end result, while sloppy to serve (don't forget the cilantro, sour cream, diced tomatoes and green onions!) is so vivid and colorful! I can't wait to eat the leftovers tomorrow wrapped in a warm tortilla or spooned over basmatic rice!

As I had already shopped and bought the corn tortillas, I cut them up and baked them to make "tortilla chips" and lined the bottom with that.  It worked! I also sliced the garlic to get more flavor, and added a couple of sliced mushrooms that happened to be in my fridge and needed to be used.  The kids loved it, I thought it was good (even better leftover for lunch the next day).  Hubby didn't like it though.  :(  He's hard to please anyway....

I made this recipe with my kids but didn't have tortillas so we used tortilla chips instead.  Turned out fantastic.  I served with a side bowl of olive oil vinagrette that had diced tomatoes, green onions and a little cilantro in it.  My kids loved it so much that the next day they begged me to make it again!  Good recipe

Great recipe. I left out the corn, and added some cooked white rice instead. I used some cumin and black bean sauce as well. Very yummy :)

I substituted corn chips instead of tortillas and added a can of enchilada sauce after reading the reviews.  The chips ended up being soggy.  Next time I will add them only on the top just before adding the cheese or not at all and just serve the chips on the side.  Overall the flavor was great and I loved how much fresh veggies are in this!

Very good and easy to make.  The spice was very nice and the veggies were just right.  Much better than the other enchilada casseroles that use the cream of chicken/mushroom/etc soups.  Thanks for sharing.

This was good! I followed the suggestions I read to use chips instead of corn tortillas. I also added diced jalapenos since we like spicier food.

I left out the corn shells on the bottom like other reviews suggested and I used deer hamburger instead of the chicken. It turned out really well. Anytime I can find a recipe that works well with deer I am sold. I also served it with corn chips on the side.

This recipe is AWESOME! My 7 year old had 2 servings and has been asking for it every night!I was looking for an Enchilada recipe when I found it. It is SO quick and simple. I left out the peppers and put in a bunch of olives. I have made it twice now in about a week and a half! I chop up onion, cilantro, tomato, and have lime slices to squeeze on top. Salsa,and sourcream for the sauce lovers! I will keep this recipe FOREVER! Thank you so much!

Absolutely delicious! I worried about the falling apart, but the cheese held it together fine.  I used colby jack.  I sprayed the dish and let it sit as I made it early.  I think the juices made the corn tortillas soft (I only had 8) I also threw in a chopped tomato.

I did not use Chicken I used Ground Turkey.  I also between each layer of tortillas I used Verde sauce.  I recommend Pace Salsa Verde sauce.  I also added Green Chiles to the meat mixture...This turned out to be a wonderful dish with my alterations...

This was a little bland and on the dry side. Adding sour cream and salsa helped a lot. I doubled the taco seasoning and know that was a good move.  Next time I will mix the cheese into the casserole instead of putting it only on top. I will also salt the chicken before cooking it.  Everyone did really like it, we just needed a little salt and moisture.

I gave this 4 stars, due to a few crucial modifications.  I brushed the bottom of a SS pan with olive oil and placed restaurant style corn chips around the edges and covering the bottom.  Used ground beef, seasoned with cumin, chili powder, cayenne, on the first layer.  Topped it with 2/3 veggie/bean mixture and added about 1/2 c thick salsa (I use Chi Chi) spread thinly along with about 1/2 cup of the cheese. I added a 2nd layer of tortilla chips, topping it with the rest of the veggie/bean mix and added sliced green olives, then topped with with the rest of the cheese.  Baked as directed.  Trick is to let it "rest" before you cut it. It was cohesive enough to hold it's shape, but not soggy from too much salsa. The chips stayed crunchy and I cannot wait to have it for lunch tomorrow.  All in all a good base for your creative individualism.  Thank you for sharing!

THIS WAS AMAZING! It made a lot which is good because I had some surprise visitors.  After reading reviews I did leave out the tortillas and lined the bottom with chips I also put chips on everyones plates for scooping.  I only used a red and yellow bell pepper which was plenty I think 3 of them would have been 2 much.  I also used poultry seasoning on the chicken along with the Cumin for some extra flavor.  Also I added a lot more cheese I was leary about Pepperjack but it really tied the meal together.  Thank you for this recipe I will continue to use it especially for potlucks as more of a dip with shredded chicken instead of cubed. mmmm

This is absolutely a new favorite for my husband and me.  I have shared it with several friends, and they and their spouses all love it as well.  My hubby and I decided to drizzle some green (jalapeno) salsa over our serving portions, and it added an entire new dimension to the flavor.  Yum!  We also served sour cream, guacamole, and red salsa alongside.  This is a keeper!!

This recipe tastes good, but there's nothing to bind it together. It's not exactly dry, but it's missing something. It called for a lot of garlic, which was okay for us, but might be a lot for some. I upped the spices and made sure my chicken was seasoned, but still felt it was lacking something to hold it together. I wondered it refried beans would work better, but I think there would also need to be cheese mixed into the recipe. Maybe hot sauce too - too much overhauling to try again :(

I really liked this recipe.  I think it could use a bot more spice but otherwise it was really good.  Don't use corn tortillas.  Use tortilla chips.

My husband loved this and I thought it was pretty good. A little dry as-is, but good once I mixed a bit of sour cream into mine. The corn tortillas were slightly tough and chewy - think I might modify that part of the recipe next time. I also added extra taco seasoning, cayenne and a little garlic salt to mine.

I love this recipe, as does all of my family and friends!  After making this a few times, I have added some things. I grate one large onion into the Chicken which adds some juiciness to the mixture! Along with the Cumin and pinch of Cayenne pepper, I use my own mix of spices' instead of a Taco seasoning-Chili Powder,Paprika,Garlic Powder,and,Salt to taste.  The last time I made this, I didn't add the corn but, put in one large fresh tomato.  I used 6 Whole Wheat Tortillas and just cut them to fit the bottom of my casserole dish.  The Whole Wheat ones add a nice texture to the dish-- they become softer than the flour or corn tortillas.After baking, I added a ton of fresh Cilantro and, it was fantasic!

This was okay, not great enough to make again. It needed more flavor - I definitely should have used more cumin (I ran out a little short of a tablespoon). I also didn't use pepperjack so it wouldn't be too spicy for the kids, maybe that would have added enough flavor.

My husband and I loved this recipe. I added green Chili Sauce to spice it up and it was even better. Yum. My kids didn't like it though. They are pretty picky eaters.

This was very easy to make and came out great! My friends loved it and I had a nice amount of leftovers for work. 

I also tried it with sour cream on the side and that was pretty good!

A family favorite, healthy and easy. I add the layer of fat free refried beans on top of the tortillas and before dumping in the rest of the casserole. This refrigerated very well for leftover lunches!

Simple and quick, without missing flavor! Even the picky eater finished his plate! 

We added three strips of bacon, which we cooked and set aside. Used the grease to caramelize the onions with the garlic before adding the chicken. Topped with a cheddar blend and the bacon bits. And I forgot the corn, but will add it the next time.

I did not have all ingredients and it still turned out great! I did not have black beans, only one can of  kidney beans. Also, my husband doesn't like peppers, so I completely omitted them. Just added more onions. I used taco seasoning and chili seasoning and I used chips instead of shells. I did go heavy on the cheese. I used super sharp cheddar and some sort of Spanish cheese we had in the fridge...... topped it off with guacamole,,,,,YUM!

Hubs and I really liked this.  Wasn't completely sure about it, but it sounded intriguing, and sometimes I just like to try something out of the ordinary.  I tried the crunchy tostada/chip idea as a base instead of the tortillas; used multigrain tortilla chips and just crumbled them in the bottom of the pan.  I added a bit of salsa on top, then carried on with the recipe until I realized I didn't have corn or pepperjack cheese, or even cheddar cheese.  The corn I just left out; for the cheese I used mozzarella.  I layered a bit to keep it together.  I really liked the results; it is kind of like a hybrid taco salad or something and we loved it with just a topping of diced fresh tomatoes.  It's a bit crumbly to serve--maybe refried beans could be used as a binder or something, but it is tasty and relatively easy.  I will keep this to make again.  Thanks for the recipe!

I have made this dish a number of times, and has become a family favorite.  I did take others' advise, and poured a small can of enchilada sauce in the bottom of the pan.  I add about 1/2 package of taco seasoning to my chicken breasts as they cook.  I follow the rest of the recipe pretty much as stated.  Sometimes, I add olives or green chiles, depending on what my pantry has.   But overall, this casserole taste great!

Very good! Made with white kidney beans and canned chicken. Put blue corn chips on the bottom of the pan instead and poured some enchilada sauce on the chips and then other other half of the 10 oz can  of echilada sauce in the mix. Thanks for the recipe.

I made this during the week and found that it was  a little more time consuming than anticipated but it may have been that it was my first attempt at making the dish which is generally how it is.  I made the dish as written and took the advise of another reviewer and omitted the corn tortillas from the dish and served with fresh made corn chips.  This was absolutely a meal made fun as titled.  The flavors were even more pronounced the next day.  This is a keeper.

This was delicious! I left out the tortillas & spooned it on to tostadas AFTER it was done baking. Topped off with sour cream, fresh diced tomatoes, shredded lettuce & hot sauce. Also goes great with spanish rice, mixed in or as a side.

This recipe was good...BUT! Most of the reviewers who said it was dry were right. I modified it by dredging my corn tortillas in hot oil...just in & out...just long enough for them to soften up a little.Of course, you have to pat most of the oil out before lining your pan. I then put a little enchilada sauce over them before putting in some refried bean and the rest of the ingredients. Turned out yummy and not at all dry! Served with Guacamole Salad & Cucumbers on side.

This was something of a departure from most of the cooking that I do as it contains a lot of beans. Despite looking heavy on beans the dish actually balances out quite well. This is one meat and potatoes guy that was impressed.

I omitted a few ingredients, and it was STILL amazing!  Because it was a side dish to be eaten with grilled  chicken and burgers, I omitted the Chicken. Because I am on a low glycemic diet, I omitted the carbs (corn and tortillas) . The pepper jack cheese really pulled the tastes together!!!

Quick,easy and very good.  I put salsa on bottom and topped with tortilla chips.  I used 1 package of taco seasoning mix with the other spices.  I was very surprised that my 22 year old loved it. He said liked all the beans.

I took one of the other reviewers advice and skipped the oven and corn tortillas. I halfed the recipe and made it in the frying pan but skipped the oil and used cooking spray. Then I spooned the hot mixture into mini pita pockets and sprinkled with a little shredded cheddar chees and served with FFsour cream for dipping. This was a very delicious lunch and I have plenty of leftovers for supper or tomorrow evening. I also love thay this dish is full of great stuff like beans and veggies. I will make this again without a doubt but I don't think I will try it according to the recipe. As always thanx for sharing.

Tastes good, doesn't 'hold together' like I expect a casserole to do. We enjoyed it with a little splash of Frank's Lime Hot sauce.

Gee, I thought this would be great but, I just didn't like it.  I made it exactly as written except for leaving out the cayenne and reducing the cumin to 1 teaspoon.  Sorry...I don't think I'll make it again.
