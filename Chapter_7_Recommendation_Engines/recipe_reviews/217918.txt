I live in an area in Central America where condensed soups are not readily available. I was looking for a quick and easy casserole recipe using chicken and rice but no condensed soups, and came upon this one that fit the bill perfectly! 
I only used half of the recommended sour cream and cream cheeses, and used real garlic (chopped) and onions, and no dill or parsley. The flavor of this recipe is really good! My hubby loved it! I used Don Julios hot sauce and it was fantastic. Not TOO spicy but just enough kick. 
I will say the recipe was a bit dry, but maybe if I had used the full amounts of cream cheese and sour cream it would have been less dry. When we have reheated it for eating leftovers, I add a bit of milk and a spoon of cheese and it's just plain good! I will make this again!

This was pretty good.  I don't think Id cook it again.  I doubled the recipe to feed a large family.  On the rice not being done, I covered the casserole when aluminum foil while it baked for 1 hour.  I then removed the foil and let it cook for 20 more minutes or until brown.  Rice was perfect.

Fabulous, I have made this twice in the last two days, by request!  The only thing I changed was I added 1/2 cup of chunky bleu cheese dressing and it was like eating wings!

I made this today for dinner. It's really tasty but it got a bit dried out. Some of the rice was a tad bit crunchy yet but I didn't want to bake it any longer. I didn't have onion powder so I minced up some onion, and I only put 2 Tbsp hot sauce because of my kids (hubby and I added more Franks Red Hot to our plates). I used neufchatel cheese instead of cream cheese and mixed light sour cream with a little regular. This would be pretty fattening to eat all the time but I will make it again! Very good.

I attempted to make lower fat version with "non fat" sour cream and low fat cream cheese - did not turn out well! If I attempt this again - I will stick with actual full flavor recipe

I always thought that the people who altered the recipe before tasting the original weren't giving the recipe a chance.  But, I'm pregnant and had some of what this recipe called for and didn't feel like portioning out the spices.  So, here's what happened:

 I grilled the chicken on the Foreman with fajita seasoning for flavor.  Put a bunch of pre-cooked rice in a frying pan added a Savory Garlic Philadelphia Cooking Creme, some chicken broth, and some Frank's Red Hot sauce.  It's fantastic.  

Now I can't wait to try the real recipe . . . though I am going to estimate the nutrition facts on my lazy interpretation.

Thanks, Samantha for the inspiration!

This has become a staple in our rotation.  So yummy!  Per other reviewers I don't cook it for the full hour so it won't be dry.  I also use sriracha hot sauce for the right kick.  Will be making this one often.  Thanks Samantha!

I used exactly what the recipe called for (hey, you only live once) and it was a bit dry.  I think next time I'll use a little more of each item and use low fat.  I used Franks Red Hot Sauce and overall it tasted awesome.  Just the right amount of kick.  I liked it and my husband did as well.  I will make it again.

The recipe sounded so creamy and indulgent!   I couldn't wait to try it.   I was very disappointed in it though.    It came out very dry and flavorless.   I love dill but you couldn't even taste it.    I would not make again.

Wasn't impressed with this at all. It came out very dry and some of the rice wasn't cooked. My family gave it a thumbs down. I was so hopeful too...

This was not for us. I think that making this with uncooked rice was my downfall. Had I cooked the rice, then mixed the casserole ingredients together and baked to warm through, I think MAYBE it would have been much better. As is, it was not edible. I'm sorry. Two stars only because it may be a recipe I'd attempt again.

I thought this recipe was pretty great and as Samantha said empty cabinets can inspire great meals! I undercooked some brown rice that I had on hand instead of using uncooked white rice. Since I cooked the rice, I was going to eliminate the chicken broth...but I decided to lower the fat content and cut the amounts of sour cream and cream cheese used (it was still very creamy). It baked up beautifully; I baked it for 35-40 minutes covered and served it with celery  for scooping. Thanks Samantha for your creativity!

I will make this again! I substituted minute rice for regular white rice and had no problems with it being dry or the rice being undercooked. I used low-fat sour cream and cream cheese and If anything, it was a little too creamy, I will probably cut back on the  amount of cream cheese for my husband's preference. Great recipe that I will make again!

Delicious.  Day before grocery shopping is always a creative dinner night and this was actually very good.  Easy to make and all ingredients we had on hand.  The hot sauce is definitely what makes this recipe so good - just enough of a kick.

This was not to my liking.  It was too mushy - felt like more of a dip than dinner.  Cooking the rice with all of the other ingredients may have been the problem.  Maybe make the rice separately and then pour the sauce over the rice?  Not even sure if that would help.  My husband will eat almost any kind of chicken with hot sauce and he did not like this at all.

I did not care for this recipe. I cooked it according to the directions exactly. The rice never fully cooked. The tabasco was way too over powering.

I made 2 changes...1..used minute rice (only to make sure rice is done)...2..after 50 mins cook time added panko crumbs mixed with butter for 10 mins to add crunchy top. This recipe is awesome...no “ crunchy rice” with minute rice...not “too creamy” it is great! Great Job!

My family really likes this recipe, especially my husband who is a hot sauce fanatic. I have made this recipe as is and it is great. However, because we're a family on a strict budget,  most of the times that I make it, I use frozen broccoli I've lightly cooked instead of chicken. It's really good this way too.

Love this idea!  I replaced sour cream, cream cheese, and cheddar with lower fat choices.  Increased the chicken broth to 2 1/2 cups, decreased the rice to 3/4 and added diced bell pepper, mushrooms, and shredded carrots and poured it all into a 9x13 baked covered for 50 mins and uncovered and baked 10 mins longer.  Creamy, spicy, healthy perfection!

This was just ok. I added 1/2 cup blue cheese dressing as one reviewer suggested. It had potential. I thought it was too much rice and not enough buffalo sauce. I will double the buffalo sauce next time and either halve the rice or double the chicken. Plus, it was a little dry. But that might be because I left it in oven to stay warm and maybe it got a little dried out. ??

Excellent, quick to throw together. Only changes I made was to add about a cup of frozen peas, and used a knorrs chicken bouillon cube dissolved in 2 cups of water.Covered with tin foil for the first 25 min., then baked about 15-20 min. more. Rice was cooked perfectly and not dry at all. Almost forgot...... I sprinkled some flavored breadcrumbs on the top, added a nice crunch. Will make this again.

I made my own chicken broth by boiling a chicken breast, which I put in casserole.  Unfortunately I didn't add salt to the water, so the casserole needed salt in the end.  I also added some fresh onion and mushrooms, some frozen broccoli, cauliflower, and spinache and a can of black beans.  I think it would have been better with more cheddar cheese and less cream cheese.

needed some vegetables. it was dry like many people commented. and the rice on the edges of the pan were crunchy. So, I maybe would cook my rice separate and serve it over rice. I would probably cut the cream cheese in half, add another can of chicken broth and add broccoli, maybe even corn and carrots too. It had a good flavor but definitely needed a little something else.

I used lowfat Greek yogurt instead of the sour cream & nonfat cream cheese as that's what I had available. I used Louisiana Hot Sauce but found that I still added some after cooking because it was more creamy than hot. I also added green beans & onions instead of onion powder. The rice on top was not cooking so I poured the remaining chicken broth (32 oz) in after it'd cooked for an hour. I let it cook for another 30 minutes & topped at last 5 minutes with a bit of cheddar & garlic pepper fried onions. Very filling meal.

It was great. I will fix again but I will cover and cook a little longer.  The rice was not quite done.
