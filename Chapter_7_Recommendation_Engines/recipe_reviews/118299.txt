If you were the sort of person who didn't share certain recipes with family and friends (thankfully I don't know anyone like that!) I could see this as one of those recipes -  the point being, this is just a perfect recipe which turns out perfect cookies. I can't imagine serving these to anyone who bakes without them asking for the recipe.  Loved its simplicity, with no added spices - just pure oat-y, fruity, nutty flavor.  I made no changes other than substituting a dried berry mix for the raisins.  I used a medium cookie scoop and flattened them just slightly. These are no wimpy cookies! They're substantial, hearty, soft and chewy gems that turn out looking like they came from your neighborhood bakery.  Add cinnamon or other spices if you like, but for me these are perfect just as is.

These are by far the best oatmeal raisin cookies I have rver eaten! You cannot go wrong with this recipe and it can be reduced to using 1/2 of each of the ingredients for a lesser amount.  I have made them 3 times so far. I had to  make a few changes as I am very cautious of sugar these days in my diet. So instead of 1C of both sugars, I used 1/4C of both and increased the raisins by a 1/4C. Also I shaped and froze the excess dough for anytime use. The first batch I baked as the recipe stated and the cookies were very sweet and chewy, delicious. I hope many try this, thanks.

These are very delicious! I made a couple of changes though, the cookie mix was very dry so I had to add 1 tbsp of milk. I also added 2 tbsp of honey, 1 tsp of cinnamon, 1/2 tsp of pumpkin pie spice(for a little extra pizzaz), and increased the raisins by 1/2 cup, and reduced the temp to 350 degrees. All in all, these are great and I would make them again.

Quite the tasty cookies. : D Very well thought up, I would just lessen up on the amount of shortening used. ( It's not the healthiest thing )

WOW!  Better than the promised excellence of a Paula Deen recipe I'd made previously!  Thank you for sharing...they turned out AMAZING!  I added cinnamon, substituted whole wheat flour and used Splenda brown sugar verses regular brown (remember to cut in half with splenda).  The batter seemed dry but don't get nervous, once cooked they turn out perfect.

I just took a batch of these cookies out of the oven and ate one right away.  They are by far the best oatmeal raisin cookies ever!  As someone else said -- chewy and soft.  My only addition/change was to add a teaspoon of cinnamon.

Fantastic!  This was just what I was looking for as it called for old fashioned oats instead of quick cook! They turned out crispy at the edge and chewy in the center, absolutely perfect!  (I used lard instead of shortning as it was what was in my cupboard)

Ok - I had to make a LOT of cookies for a holiday function and I couldn't spend a lot of time/money so I made these more festive by chaging the 1/2 c of raisins to 1/3 c raisins, 1/3 c dried cranberries and 1/3 c of chopped dried figs- they are GREAT! Nice recipe. Thanks

These were very tasty, the kind of cookie that develops its full range of flavors as you chew it, if that makes any sense!  They were especially good with the required cold glass of milk. I was not overly pleased with the consistency -- a little too flat & "crispy" for me -- but that may be a consequence of baking time. I didn't have time to play as I needed them for Christmas gift trays, but will try adjusting baking time when I make them next.

I used to work with Otis Spunkmeyer Cookies and this recipe is so close to their Oatmeal raisin cookies it's AMAZING! I add 2 tsp ground cinnamon with the flour and 1 extra tsp of vanilla. Don't overbake and to keep them chewy, slap the cookie sheet down on your countertop so the cookies flatten.

My husband made these.  He followed the recipe, withholding the walnuts because he doesn't like them.  These cookies are amazing. I just ate three straight from the oven and may go eat another one.

I used butter for the shortening, didn't change anything else except didn't add walnuts.  Hubby doesn't like raisins and this recipe didn't have alot (I might have added a few more) so he loved them!  Thanks Geraldine!

These are amazing ... added a teaspoon of cinnamon and used dark raisins instead of the golden raisins and chopped pecans instead of walnuts.  They are quite soft and chewy, if you don't over bake them.  I found it was helpful to leave them a few seconds on the cookie sheet before removing, or else they wouldn't stay together.

Exactly what I was looking for! Slightly crisp on the outside with that satisfying chew on the inside. I didn't find the dough dry at all as other reviewers have stated. I'm ashamed to say it because it's typically a pet peeve of mine, but I did alter the recipe a tiny bit. I tried really hard not to add any spices, but in the end, I just couldn't do it. Oatmeal raisin cookies need spices, darn it! I added 2 t. cinnamon and 1/2 t. nutmeg. I also cut the shortening in half and then added 1/2 c. butter, but that's a change I'd make to any cookie recipe calling for shortening only. The flavor is always better that way.

1/2 recipe minus the walnuts = 27 perfect cookies!  I snuck a (few) piece(s) of dough and was worried they would be too sweet, but after baking the amount of sweetness was just right.  Since this recipe calls for shortening instead of softened butter I was able to whip these up in no time.  A perfect sweet treat - I can't wait to try them warm with some vanilla ice cream :)

Perfect oatmeal cookies! I'm picky about cookies, and not the world's best baker, so I always get excited when a cookie recipe turns out great for me with no monkey business. Made as written, these are crisp and chewy and delicious! I made mine with golden raisins, pecans, and some dried cherries that have been kicking around. Excellent recipe - I'll use it for my oatmeal-based cookies from now on. THANKS!

WOW!  Just like I rememered it!  I took the advise of another reviewer and cut back on the sugar...2/3 cup each instead of a full cup...added 1/2 cup more raisins, omited the walnuts and added 1 1/2 tsp cinnamon, 3 dashes of nutmeg, and 1/8 tsp cloves.  FABULOUS!  Thank you so much for sharing!  This is the recipe of my child hood!

I was a little skeptical when I read all the glowing reviews; afterall, how exciting could an oatmeal raisin cookie really be? Well, these ones are oatmeal cookie heaven. What a great recipe. I replaced the shortening with butter, otherwise I followed the recipe exactly. These will be going in my children's lunchboxes on a regular basis. Thanks for the great recipe.

Wow!!!  These cookies are absolutely fabulous! A slight crunch on the outer edges and chewy on the inside, while maintaining a nice moistness...everything you'd expect from a really good oatmeal raisin cookie!  I used butter flavored shortening and added a tsp. of cinnamon just for a hint of spice and since I didn't have walnuts on hand I used a full cup of golden raisins. These baked up beautifully and made the whole kitchen smell divine! This is definitely a "go-to" recipe and one that I'll make again and again! Definitely have a cold glass of milk because you can't eat just one!

These were the best Oatmeal Raisin Cookies I've ever made!!!  I added a teaspoon of cinnamon just for spice, but honestly don't think it was needed.  They were not only delicious, but came out picture perfect as well.  Have already put the recipe into my "permanent" book!  Thanks for sharing :)

This is one of the best oatmeal raisin cookies that I have ever had.  My grandson is highly allergic to nuts so I left out the nuts and doubled up on the raisins.  I also add a little milk to the recipe because I found the first batch just a little too thick.  The dough was stickier and the cookies were softer.  Everyone loves these cookies.

This recipe is great! Did a few substitutions, put 1/2 cup each white and brown sugar, 1 cup of raisins, and 1 tsp. of cinnamon. Cookies came out delicious, I definitely will be using this recipe again.

Mmmmmmazing!!!!! This was my first time using shortening in a cookie, which I split with butter, an as I aunt proclaimed more than once, "these are the softest, most moist cookies I've ever had,"!!! I also added cinnamon an a dash of cloves, an because I was running low on flour added additional oats; best ORC ever ♥ thank you so much for putting it on this site!! Otherwise I prolly never would have found it

I'm a person who shies away from cookies since my previous attempts haven't turned out all that great. This one though, came out really well!  I would add some spice the next time round though.   I had to use quick cooking oats since we don't get old fashioned oats here, same for shortening, so used butter instead. They still turned out really well, so well infact, that my husband was comparing them to the best cookie shop in town!   Thank you so much!!

Just what I was looking for. They came out fluffy, and moist, and delicious. I used regular raisins and added more than the recipe called for, and I cooked it on stoneware

This made a very good cookie. I could not find golden raisins so used regular.   Did not make any other changes. I do think when I make them again I will cut back some on the brown sugar

These are excellent. One adjustment, didn't have brown sugar so used 1 1/2 C white sugar and that was enough. Threw in about 1/4C choc chips too, yum!

This recipe is amazing! I substituted margarine for shortening and added 1/2 tsp each of pumpkin pie spices and cinnamon. I also added more raisins (almost doubled). These cookies are crispy on the outside and chewy in the middle. Unfortunately I was going for chewy all over, but the taste makes up for it! Next time I will cook at 350 degrees per other users' remarks. Overall a fantastic cookie!

I read the reviews and tried this recipe because I love oatmeal cookies and this promised to be a good one.  I changed the recipe only by using Splenda instead of white sugar, still using the brown sugar and I used a dried fruit mix of cranberry, strawberry, blueberry and raisen.  It was a shockingly dry dough, but someone said to not let that deter me.  I put large portions on the sheet and baked them.  They fell apart like a granola.  Still very tasty but not a cookie.  I added a bit of milk so the dough would stick and continued baking.  They still turned out soft and chewy with a crunchy outside.  I will make them again, but not sure why my dough was so dry.

So GOOD! soft and chewy... real comfort cookies. I soaked the raisins in hot water before, and that made them a lot softer. The only problem was that they spread out and were not so pretty. Thank you!

This recipe was absolutely FABULOUS!  My husband wanted me to get a new cookie recipe, so I thought I would give this one a shot.  I made a few alterations, based on personal preferences, though.  Please don't flame me! :)  I used 1/2 cup butter and 1/2 cup butter-flavored shortening, and also decreased the sugar to 1/3 cup white and 2/3 cup brown.  Then before I added the eggs and vanilla, I put in a box of instant vanilla pudding (old church lady secret...sshhhh). I also threw in a teaspoon of cinnamon and 1/4 tsp. cloves to the dry ingredients.  This made for some wonderfully, but not overpoweringly so, spicy cookies!  Thank you so much for posting this recipe.  So delicious!

This is by far the best cookies that I have experienced.  The only difference was that I added butter instead of shortening and 1 tsp of cinnamon.  If you have not made these yet, give  it a whirl, you won't be disappointed.

I made these cookies tonight but I had found the recipe on a container of ShopRite brand Old Fashioned Oats and was very surprised to find it in allrecipes.com presented as an original recipe.  Actually I was looking for a better recipe than this when I came upon this.  They're just OK.  My husband liked them.  Didn't use nuts.  They look very nice and uniform.  I used a small scoop that made perfect sized cookies. Baked them for 15 minutes and that was perfect for color and texture. I'll freeze most of the batch until the "experts" (our grandkids) come to visit and let them rate them.

These have  to be the best cookies I have ever made. Followed the recipe to a "T" except I chilled the batter for an hour and used the middle rack position. Moist and chewy...picture perfect. Definately making these on a regular basis.

I made this recipe based on the high reviews. I didn't think it was that great. There was too much salt and not enough raisins/walnuts. I cut the salt and increased the raisins/walnuts on the next batch and it was much better.

YUM! I love that they are still super tasty this morning =) They maintained a crisp edges, yet chewy centers. I used butter and added some Craisins in with the golden raisins to give it a splash of color, subbed pecans for walnuts...and just a white chocolate chip or two on top of each for fun! These will go fast at work today, I am sure! --I refrigerated some of the dough when I was half way through and they stayed a little puffier, so that may be something to consider, depending upon how you want your cookies to turn out.

I lost this recipe and I'm so happy I found it on this site!  I have made this for years.  My mother always substituted almond flavoring for the vanilla which makes a wonderful cookie.  I think we may have cooked it at 350, I'll try that next time as I think 375 is a little too hot.  Thank you for the recipe.  It's like connecting with an old friend!

Excellent oatmeal raisin cookies.  They're sweet but not overwhelmingly so, and they are crispy, chewy, and soft all at the same time.  I used sliced almonds since I don't have walnuts (bf doesn't like them so I don't buy them anymore) and used regular raisins instead of golden, but otherwise followed the recipe.  I love golden raisins so I bet I'd like these even better if I'd followed that direction.  thanks for the recipe!

I've never been able to make an oatmeal raisin cookie that my husband likes until now.  Originally I used half margarine and half shortening, and I added cinnamon and nutmeg, the more taste the better.  I did add a little more vanilla but overall, I really liked this recipe.  I am trying the recipe again with just shortening, we'll see if it is just as good.

This is the best recipe! People are always requesting that I make them again.  Depending on the crowd, I don't add walnuts and use 3/4 cup raisins instead.  Also, I usually add at least another 1/2 cup of oats.  I did find that this only make 4 dozen cookies.

Cookies were okay. Not the best oatmeal raisin cookies I've ever had. Too much fatty shortening.
