This pork chile verde recipe is absolutely delicious! I am familiar with the dish, but I was concerned with the jalapenos peppers this recipe calls for making it too spicy. No worries needed, this had just enough "kick". I do recommend wearing disposable cooking gloves when you clean the jalapeno peppers to protect yourself from any accidental encounters with their lingering burn! Their aroma alone made it a bit uncomfortable to breath while cleaning and chopping them, but oh my, they were worth it! I thought the size of the cut vegetable in the end product might be too big, but they were perfect! I could not find the Swanson Mexican Tortilla broth anywhere, so I just used regular Swanson Chicken broth. Yummy!

Love this recipe!!! My family is always excited when the tortillas come out and this dish is on the table. Followed directions and it turns out perfect. I do substitute brown rice flour for white flour and yellow pepper for green because the greens are not always up to par in Alaska. Amazing!!

This was delicious! I didn't have the Swanson's Mexican broth but used low sodium Chicken broth and added some of my homemade Mexican seasoning.  It wasn't too spicy in fact hubby wanted it spicier so I gave some jalapenos diced just for him. He was a very happy man. We made tacos out of it but you can serve it over rice. Lots of flavor!

Really good!  Next time I'll double it because this realistically made 3 servings.  Served it in a bowl with corn tortillas on the side topped with a little sour cream and salsa.  Used low sodium broth, the broth specified in the recipe is not available at my store.  Left out bell pepper because I detest it and didn't have fresh cilantro so used dried but fresh would have been better.    Might leave some of the pepper seeds in next time to add a little more heat and would chop the peppers up into slightly smaller pieces but that is purely aesthetics.  Leftovers are going to be served tomorrow with fried eggs on top!!

I have actually made it 3 times now. My hubby brags about how "I" make it because this recipe is solo good.
Delicious recipe!  I always add extra peppers because we like a lot of heat. Have skipped the canned chilies the last 2 times and just added more fresh. And this third time I am trying some roasted tomatillos....it's on the stove now!

I failed to use green peppers, but wow! My husband's response - "Oh my gosh!" We both couldn't believe the delicious flavor and little kick it had. Spicy foods are preferable for me - yet he enjoys...but also tender bites is a desire. This is the perfect combination. Because my chunks of pork were a bit smaller than the recipe calls for, I didn't have to cook as long - was about 30min instead of 1hr. So easy to prepare. We will definitely make this a new "go-to"!

Adapted the recipe a bit, using an Allrecipes recipe for Salsa Verde. Added a bunch of stuff. Zucchini, Russet and red potatoes and lots of different peppers from the garden. Tomatillos were also from the garden. The sour cream was the perfect touch. Also made enough for an army! I love leftovers!

We've been making Chile Verde for many, many years with our own recipe. When looking for a simpler stovetop recipe we tried this and WOW! What a great, quick recipe. It is extremely flavorful and one of the favorites in our menu now. We haven't even gone back to our old recipe since the first time we made this. Fantastic!

So so yummy.  I had to substitute an Anaheim pepper for poblano peppers and added 2 tomatillos and it was spectacular.  I will most definitely be making this again with my substitutions.

Wow, super delicious. I skipped the jalapeños and used plain chicken broth. It was not too spicy at all and full of flavor. I thought it was a little thick and I had to add  more water during cooking so be sure to watch this. I halved the recipe and added 1/4 cup water to prevent burning.

Delicious! I used what we had, just poblano and jalapeno, and chicken broth. Omitted green peppers and canned chiles and still turned out awesome! We had it with rice, kids had it in buns. The trick is getting a good brown on the meat and the long simmer till it’s fork tender. I also added a little flour to the sautéed veggies before adding back meat and broth so the gravy was slightly thickened.

I used a package of frozen onions and peppers instead of fresh to save time, but followed the recipe to the letter otherwise.  AWESOME!  My family has asked for this again and again.

I didn't have jalapeños today so I added a bit of cayenne pepper. I didn't add the sour cream just put it on the side. I used my own homemade chicken broth. Family loved it! I will make again.
