One of the wonderful things about baby bok choy, aside from its taste, is its size and the beautiful presentation it makes. One perfectly cooked and seasoned baby bok choy on a dinner plate is almost like a bow on a package. I think those who are chopping this, or substituting mature bok choy, or those who are adding other vegetables are totally missing the beauty of whole baby bok choy for its visual appeal. Having said that, the simple seasoning and braising in this recipe makes this not only a beautiful and unique presentation on the dinner plate, but a delicious one at that. I used shallots rather than onion and added a little chicken broth, and found I needed to cook the little guys a couple of minutes less than directed to keep them crisp-tender and to retain their shape and color.  Impressive and very pretty!

This is excellent!  I made it exactly according to recipe, except that I used regular instead of baby bok choy, and it took a little longer to cook.  I waited until the white parts were almost soft, which took about 25 minutes, but the green parts weren't slimy at all, as mentioned in a previous review.  This is definitely a keeper!

I'm happily giving thes recipe a high rating. It was exactly what I was looking for. Something interesting and new, healthy and not very expensive, It sure was easy and quick to prepare and met the approval of everyone at my dinner table. I did add more bacon,(how bad can that be)as I needed to use it up. I probably added a little more garlic too. The direction of 1 tsp. of red pepper flakes is not too much for the average person but could be lessened for those with tender palates. The bok choy is a huge heap in the frying pan. Don't worry though, it will soon soften up and drastically shrink in size. Be cautioned - the bok choy must be rinsed very thoroughly before use. Lots of dirt hiding in the leaves. I guarantee you will kick yourself if you bite into a gritty forkful and don't get to eat this. I would like to start enjoying at least 1 night a week with a meal containing veggies only. This for sure will be on the menu. Thanks so much for sharing this one.

This is really great. Simple flavours and so easy. The bacon adds a wonderful salty flavour and I used mature bok choy instead of baby as that's all I had. With preparing this dish, I did as you would do for stir -fry, by chopping everything up beforehand. I also added 1 green onion, half an ear of corn and 1 stick of celery all chopped up because I'm always looking for ways to eat more veg. Totally delish! I did separate the stalks and the leaves and only added the leaves in the last two minutes. The stalks had about five minutes cooking time. Perfect instructions, too. Don't leave your pan on too high when you put the stalks in - your garlic will burn. Thankyou for a wonderful recipe that has left me with lunch tomorrow! Update: I have made this again, but added some mushrooms. This recipe is the bomb!

This was okay once I added about a tablespoon each of hoisin and black bean sauce.  I only had large bok choy which I had to chop so that may have been part of the problem.  The leaves became sort of slimy but the stalks were fine.  I will try this again using baby bok choy or I will either cook the stalks and then add the leaves just at the very end so they retain some texture.  It would have been great were it not for the texture which may have been my fault.

Yum!  I was looking for a new way to make bok choy and this one is a keeper!  I made few changes, i used baby bok choy cuz its more tender.  We didn't have any bacon, so i just stir fried some ham finely diced slowly to draw out the flavor.  We like our food highly spiced so I added some paprika and cayenne pepper to the red pepper flakes AND threw in a tablespoon of black bean sauce and a tsp of pureed chili sauce (found at your neighborhood asian food mart) to the mix.  Rave reviews all around my house!

This recipe was very good.  I made it for dinner serving 8 people (serving it only over rice).  I chopped up 2 packs of the store-bought bacon and fried it in the wok until the bacon was nice and brown, almost crispy.  I drained out all fat and left about 1 tblsp.  Didn't need to use olive oil, just because I thought it'd be too oily.  Also, I used just regular bok choy, instead of the baby, because that was all they had at the grocery store.  With those, I just chopped them up and threw them in and it turned out fine.  I seasoned to taste with hoisin sauce and extra black pepper, just because I love black pepper with bacon. Next time, I would like to try it with the baby bok choy, just because I know that they will come out more tender than regular bok choy.

very tasty and easy side dish to make. I loved the taste that the bacon adds to the baby bok choy. Baby bok choy is an easy vegetable to prepare. I cooked the bacon, chopped up, then set it aside. I used the grease leftover from the bacon with a drizzle of olive oil to heat up together. I added the baby bok choy stem, hard parts, to cook first. They take a little longer to cook than the bok choy leaves. About 2 minutes into the cooking process I added the leaves and stirred to combine everything. I added the bacon back to the baby bok choy and seasoned with a pinch of salt and black pepper to taste. I did not add any red pepper flakes since no one really likes it spicy. I was careful not to overcook the bok choy stems while leaving enough of a crunch. I ended up with nice bright green color that bok choy gives and wonderful bacon-y flavor with a crunchy texture! This was such a delicous side dish and it complemented the, "Chicken Fried Rice II," also from this website. This dish is easy to prepare and doesn't take but a few minutes to put together. A definite keeper to use again in the near future!

Found some very fresh and tender baby bok choy at a great price at the oriental market, so this will be the first of several new side dishes that I try over the next few days (there was a lot in the bag!).  First, I think some red bell pepper slices really would be a good addition and would really brighten up the presentation.  Next time, I also will check the bok choy at 2 minutes, as it cooked very quickly.  When I took the lid off at 3 minutes, it already was a little overcooked.  This should be the last dish that goes on the table because it cooled down very fast, and as the recipe writer said, "...serve piping hot."  I served this with chicken, but this would be a nice side dish to so many different entrees.   Definitely will be making this often, nice side dish and EASY.

Yummy! I too cooked the white parts first and then added the green after a few minutes. Great flavor! This was my first time cooking Bok Choy and we really enjoyed it.

I used regular bok choy, kept all the bacon fat in the pan, and used no olive oil. I cooked the white parts of the bok choy till they were barely tender and then added the green parts. I forgot to mince garlic before I started so I just added some garlic powder when it was almost done cooking. Very delicious!

super easy and very good.  I only had reg. bok choy on hand so I cooked the white part for about 5 minutes then added the leaves for about 3 more minutes with about 1 T. of water and it turned out great.  I used turkey bacon as well for a "healthier" alternative.

I served this with coconut rice and korean chicken (recipes I found here); the Bok Choy w/bacon was great. I added a chopped rib of celery with onion and garlic then when I added the bok choy I added a sliced roma tomatoe. A lovely dish be sure to use the bacon grease to stir fry.

This was absolutely delicious. I served it over a bed of rice with some soy sauce. The salt of the bacon and the heat of the red pepper flakes tasted so good with the crunch of the bok choy. This is a keeper for sure!

This is a very simple, quick stir fry. I'm not a big fan of bacon, so I replaced it with sliced Chinese pork sausages instead. I also used alittle bit of hoison sauce for extra flavoring. The little bit of crushed red peppers really do enhance the flavor of the dish. I will definitely tell my parents about this dish!

This was delicious. I've tried the original recipe and made a remix. The second time I used a Vidalia Sweet Onion and added hoison sauce. With some jasmine rice. Nummy! Both were DELICIOUS!

It was OK, my fault for using regular bok choy instead of baby bok choy. I will try it with baby bok choy as directed next time and see if the texture and flavor improve.

I have been meaning to rate this completely awesome recipe. One word, yum! I make it exactly as written and it is perfect. I love bacon, bok choy, red onions, garlic and red peppers so it just doesn't get any better for me. However, I wouldn't call any recipe with bacon in it "healthy".

Great flavor! Followed the recipe exactly except that I used regular bok choy cut up in pieces and it was very tasty! I enjoyed the heat from the red pepper flakes but for those who don't like their foods a little spicy they may want to add a little less red pepper flake then called for. Will make again!

Made as written.  Husband thought there was a little too much red pepper.  May eliminate it next time and use season salt instead of  plain salt.
Update: Reduced red pepper - still too hot for hubby.  Season salt didn't make any noticeable difference.

I had Bok Choy and have never used it before.  I enjoyed this dish and my 13 yr old daughter did too.  It all got eaten but no one raved about it. 
If I ever have bok choy again in the house (co-op fruit/veggies!) I will make this again.  Bacon makes everything good!

I used turkey bacon, garlic powder and salt, onion powder and salt, and left out the onion because that is what I had on hand. I used regular bok choy and also added some chopped green sweet pepper and  some paprika a for a bit of kick.
I sauteed the sweet pepper and the bacon for about 5 mins, and then added the bok choy stalks. I covered the pan for  3-4 mins to soften the stalks and then I uncovered the pan and added the bok choy leaves. I stirred the mixture for about 8-10 mins to allow the leaves to cook down to my desired doneness and for some of the liquid to evaporate a bit. Turned out very tasty. Going to serve it over rice and  baked pork chops.

Yum, yum!!! I did alter the recipe and I enjoy it even more (see below)!

Traditionally, I prepare bok choy with Asian flavors, and it is excellent with fish or another oriental dish. This recipe is a nice change. I just made it with a steak and potato dinner and it was a very complimentary veggie.

I did change the recipe a bit. Instead of cooking the bacon before hand, I started with the olive oil and added 6 spoonfuls of real bacon bits that i got at Costco (call me lazy, I know). I added in the onion right away. Instead of 1/2 of a small red onion. I put in a whole medium sized red onion. Other than that I stayed true to the recipe.

Beware: It is spicy!

Very tasty and quick.  The only change I made was to not cover the bok choy to braise it.  It was nicely dry and wilted.  It might also benefit from a dash of sesame oil next time. This will definately happen again.

I've never cooked with bok choy before, and decided to buy a head from the farmer's market and give it a try.  This was easy and pretty good.  I did add some additional vegetables to the mix and served it over rice as suggested, just to make it a heartier meal on its own.

I cooked this up for a friend and I for lunch and it was fantastic! I had large bok choy around so I used that since I usually use baby bok for my soups. I chopped up the leaves and cooked until they were tender enough. My friend is not too fond of spice so be mindful how many flakes you put in. Definitely a repeatable recipe in my books! Thanks for sharing!

Don't know if my pepper flakes are really hot compared to most; but this turned out really hot for me.  I will make this again because I really like the way it tasted minus the heat.  Next time I will use half of the pepper flakes called for and then it will be perfect!  Cooking time for everything was bang on.

I will make this again but with only half the amount of pepper flakes. The spiciness detracted from the taste of the bok choy.

This dish is pure genius.  Served with white rice and Indonesian Pork Satay from this site.  Wonderful meal.  Had no red pepper flakes - subbed with seasoning salt and garlic pepper seasoning.  I drained fat from the bacon off completely and added 1tbsp veg oil to wok.  I did not put the lid on, just stir fried until perfectly  done. Veggies used: asparagus, red onion and baby bok choy.

WOW!! GREAT recipe, although a bit too spicey for us, as written, so cut back on the red pepper flakes the second time around. LOVE bacon so added a couple more pieces and used all the drippings and added extra cabbage. Also added a little ginger. This is a GREAT recipe for Atkins and a nice change.

After reading all of the reviews I had my hopes set so high and wonder if I did something wrong since it was just not the bacony wonderfulness we were hoping for, but I followed the directions exactly.  Will have to try it one more time though... anything with bacon deserves at least two attempts at greatness.

Thanks for the recipe!
We got bok choi in our CSA (community supported agriculture) box today and I'd never had it before.  We used one medium-sized head and cooked one cup of rice to serve with it and it worked out just about perfectly to 4 servings.  

I substituted yellow onion because it was all I had.

This is an awesome recipe to make especially for someone trying Bok Choy for the first time. I followed the recipe and used 5 slice of turkey bacon chopped, some large bok choy, olive oil, red crushed pepper, minced garlic salt, onions chopped, and other seasonings to give it more flavor. When it was done I ate this wonderful recipe with some rice and I have to say it was ummmmm! Delicious!

Really really yummy.  I added celery and mushrooms per a previous review, and it was delish.  Made the mistake of leaving the bacon in instead of taking it out, but it was still yummy.  I used turkey bacon and canola oil instead of regular bacon and it was still yummy.  Make sure not to cook too much though, cause it gets watery.

I really enjoyed this.  I used regular bok choy chopped.  I used about 7 pieces of bacon.  I added two heaping teaspoons of hoison and then served over rice as our main dish.  It was healthy and delicious! I could see adding carrots, julienned.  Will definitely try again.

This was great!  I've never even eaten Bok Choy. i got it in my Bountiful Baskets.  I added corn, used a white onion, turkey bacon, Yoshita's asian sauce (just a bit for a sweet contrast), then at the end I stir fried rice into the mixture.  Awesome

Totally delicious.  If you like good collard greens, you'll love this (though I think this is even better!).  Very fast and easy too.  I just made it with 4 heads of baby bok choy (cooks down to nothing) and nearly ate the entire pot myself!

I used regular bok choy, increased the bacon a bit (everything is better with a bit more bacon) and everything came out great. I can see this making an appearance monthly at our table.

This was great!  It was the first time I'd used bok choy and was specifically looking for an easy recipe that I can have on the medically-supervised weight loss diet that I'm on.  I had to do a few substitutions, as I had 'regular' bok choy, not baby.  I didn't use bacon grease, but used 1 Tbsp of olive oil, which was plenty in my non-stick skillet.  Also used sweet onion, instead of red.  I added a little bit of water to help with the cooking/steaming of the bok choy, to make up for the lesser amount of oil.  Finally, I had some pre-made bacon bits, so I added just a little (maybe a Tbsp) as I'm not really supposed to have it on my diet.  It turned out great and we will definitely have this again!  P.S.  I used what I had for the red pepper, which was ground, not flakes.  This may have made it hotter than it otherwise would have been, I don't know.  But since we don't really like very spicy foods, I'll probably cut down on the red pepper next time.

Pretty good since this was my first time cooking Bok Choy.  I used baby bok choy.  My family really liked it.  I think it needed something to give it more depth.  Maybe a bit of white wine or oyster sauce.

This is very good, I didn't use as much red pepper flakes as called for and next time will cut down to 1/4 tsp. It was too hot and spicy for us but other than that a hit with everyone. I didn't have a red onion so used a little sweet yellow one.
Thanks for sharing this recipe.

This was pretty good. Quick and easy to make, and a different way to eat bok choy (which is what I was looking for). I wish it had a bit more sauce, so I'll probably work on that next time. We ate it over rice, so sauce would have been nice for that. :)

Wow! I've always enjoyed bok choy but had never prepared it myself until this. It was better then any I've ever had with my easy adjustments: I diced 4-5 thin slices of prosciutto and fried in a little olive oil until crispy and set it aside. Then I added a bit more olive oil to the pan and cooked the onion, pepper flakes and garlic as directed. But then I also added a few splashes of chicken broth to sort of de-glaze the pan and then settled the bok choy on top. The broth helped soften the vegetables and added lots of flavor while it simmered and steamed in the pan. The prosciutto was added back at the end and was a delicious and salty topping that was to die for. A DEFINITE KEEPER!!

I found this to be okay, but am not sure I'd necessarily make it again. I wanted to use up some leftover baby bok choy we had,  but ended up not having as much as I'd thought. Luckily we also had lots of leftover baby spinach, so making up the difference was easy. The spinach tasted much better in this dish than the bok choy, so I would use that exclusively if I were to repeat this recipe.

The bacon in the recipe adds a good bit of flavor to the dish. We made some slight changes--omitted the olive oil and used about three tablespoons of the bacon grease from a WHOLE package of bacon (you can never have too much bacon!). Also, instead of red onion, we opted for something a little milder since my hubby gets heartburn easily enough as it is, scallions. We basically created heart attack in a bowl with some leafy greens. Still, it was very good and worth it!

This is a great way to use up bok choy.  I used a large one instead of babies and the whole family thought it was delicious.  Even the teenagers didn't complain.  I used bouillon instead of plain salt and kept the bacon fat instead of olive oil.

Excellent!!
I received bok choy in my produce delivery and didn't know what to do with it. 
Allrecipes to the rescue!
I served this over rice and added some soy sauce.  I will definitely be making it again and I can see it working well with chicken or pork as well. 
Thanks for sharing.

I halved the recipe because it was just my husband and I. The only thing I changed was I only used 1/2 teaspoon of  pepper flakes I put in and it was spicy enough for us.

I made this recipe as written except used the mature bok choy. The red peppers were overwhelmingly hot. Plus, it needed salt. It didn't matter enough to put more salt on at the table - the heat made up for it. My husband, who loves spicy foods, finished the dish. I will definitely make the recipe again, but just adjust the spices some. Hubby can always add more!

we tried this with some bok choy from the farm share. while bok choy isn't my favorite, this recipe was easy and good.  we made it as-is on the recipe and it turned out well.

I thought it was great but I would add less red pepper flakes (about half) and maybe add a tablespoon of mirin.

I made this with what I had on hand... Baby bok choy, scallions and turkey bacon as substitutes.. It is DELISH!!   I am going to top it on tomatoes with fat free shredded  mozzarella and broil for a few minutes this time.. but as a side dish, this will be a keeper

Absolutely delicious and very easy.  Used mature bok choy since that's all I could find.  Next time I'll incorporate AussieMum1's suggestions and braise the stems, then add the leaves the last minute plus.  Look forward to adding other veggies as well.

This was pretty good! It IS spicy since you "bloom" the red pepper flakes in the oil, and then cook everything else in that oil; therefore it has an authentic taste. Is good with just rice or as a side dish for a meat entree. Thanks for posting this recipe!!

This was a great recipe! I received baby bok choy by accident in our weekly fruit and vegetable delivery.  I wasn't sure what to do with it until I found this recipe.  We will definitely be having bok choy again...on purpose this time!

It is my first time cooking bok choy so I was a little worried about how it may turn out. I've made some changes to the recipe and was delicious! I love garlic so I added handful of whole garlic cloves(not minced) and fried it for 1-2 min before adding the bok choy. As previous reviews suggested i devided it into two parts: white stems fried for 3 min than added cooked chicken and green parts of bok choy. Then cooked another 3min. I also substituted pepper for cayenne pepper. Served over rice. Refreshing dish!

This was fantastic! I did it a bit differently, chopped up and minced two red chilies, two garlic cloves, and two peels of leeks. After the bacon was finished, I added the teaspoon of oil, added the mixture to the bacon, and then added the bok choy. The entire dish is great with pho, or with simple chunks of chicken in broth. My family loved it, and I'll definitely be making it again.

My husband gives this 5 stars and I give it three...so we compromised on 4.  It was way too spicy for me, but that was what he loved about it.  We served it over plain quinoa which was good and while I enjoyed the flavor of the dish, my mouth and throat were on fire! ...my husband gulped it down.  Make sure you have milk on hand.

We really enjoyed this dish. I added thinly sliced radish too for a bit more color.  I only had bok choy on hand, but it turned out great. I cooked the stalks and radish for a few minutes before adding the leaves.

Great use of Bok Choy.  I used regular size.  A little too spicy though so next time I will just add a pinch of red pepper flakes.

This is very similar to 3 other recipes, so I combined all 3. I added carrots for crunch, used regular Bok Choy since I didn’t have baby, and also followed another suggestion and added the noodles to each portion because I anticipated leftovers. I added the flavor packet to the soy mix for flavor and poured over the cabbage early to soften it up a bit. Overall it was very good but needed something to give it some oomph, to make it memorable. Perhaps some red pepper flakes or some lemon or lime zest? Would make again.

Good way to use up some bok choy.  I halved the recipe and only used bacon grease - no oil.  I think it would be good with tomatoes.  While I enjoyed it, I think it could use a little extra something.

Easy peasy.. I used a small bok choy variety called mei quing choy I had on hand from my CSA delivery.  I also added chiken breast cubes to add bulk.  Served over rice.  Great meal.

Delicious! And so easy and quick to put together. The recipe is pretty spicy as written. For my personal preference, I will probably half the amount of red pepper flakes. Also, there was quite a bit of water at the bottom of the pan that hadn't cooked out by the time the bok choy was done. My first thought was to just transfer the bok choy to the serving dish with a slotted spoon to drain out the excess moisture, but a lot of the flavor would be left behind in that water. Next time, I'll try doing all the cooking uncovered.

Simple, quick, and tasty dish. The crunchy bok choy and crispy bacon coupled with the red pepper flakes made a wonderful combination. Cook the bok choy with the bacon grease and you won't regret it =)

Absolutely fabulous.  I added crimini mushrooms to the sautee (same stage as the onions), but otherwise followed the recipe as written.

This is so easy and good.  I decided to add Tofu to make this go a little farther and worked out great.  I first cooked the bacon, then I fried the Tofu until crisp in the bacon fat...then I drained and added the seasonings and Bok Choy. I have also added other veggies w/ this dish a few times.  Great recipe.

This is an excellent recipe. However I made it without the bacon because I realized that my bacon was still frozen when I needed to make the dish. (It still tastes great without it but I would rather have the bacon meat plus cook the stuff in the fat.) Also, instead of using olive oil and bacon fat to cook the bok choy and onions, etc. i used coconut oil. I also added fresh sunflower sprouts on the top to add a bit more green.

I used this recipe to try bok choy out for the first time.  It was really good.  I don't think bok choy in general is destined to be one of our favorite veggies, but we both liked the combination of flavors with the bacon and the kick of the red pepper flakes.  Thanks!

With our efforts toward adding fresh vegetables to our diet, I'm always looking for new recipes.  I had a half a head of Chinese cabbage and about 4 ounces of bean sprouts leftover and decided to modify this recipe with those ingredients.  The flavor was very good, just the right amount of spice for my taste.  Thanks for sharing!

This was actually pretty tasty - I always wanted to try to cook bok choy but never really knew how. I could not find baby bok choy in any of my local stores so I used the regular one which still came out great. I am going to keep my eyes out for the baby style.

It was ok, if a little bland.  I'm not sure what I'd add, but it definitely needed more kick.  A good way to get your greens though.

Thanks for this recipe, Shunpr.  It's a keeper for me.  I love the taste of vegetables cooked with bacon but was always frightened of doing it myself.  This was such an easy method and I followed it precisely.  I add a small fresh cut chilli instead of the red pepper flakes as these were all I had on hand.  I made the recipe a little lower in fat by using trimmed bacon, only need 2 slices and I used soya sauce instead of salt to season.
