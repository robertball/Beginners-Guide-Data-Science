I wish I could give this 4.5 stars, as it is very tasty. However, the crust is just a bit too thick and, well, spongy, I guess. I don't know how to describe it, but the crust is not what I had expected. I did make a couple of changes, but nothing that would change it dramatically. I wanted to make this in my 13x9" pan, so I cut the recipe to 45 servings. It was a little challenging to figure out the amounts of butter and vanilla in the crust and filling (the instructions didn't change when I put in the new serving size) so if you want to bake these in a 9x13" pan for 45 servings, you use 1 1/2 tsp. of vanilla in the crust, and 3/4 tsp. in the filling. For the butter, use 9 tbs. butter in the crust and 3 tbs. in the filling. I didn't want to use only pecans, so I used 1 1/4 cups pecans and 1 cup of walnuts. These were very tasty and buttery, but I'm not sure I will make them again.
