These were yummy and something a bit different than what I usually do.  I mostly followed recipe.  I browned lean beef, added taco seasoning, uncooked rice-added water to let rice cook in beef/seasoning until done to take on flavor of seasoning.  Once rice was finished cooking in beef mixture, I added cheese queso instead of cheese soup (because I had on hand and rarely buy cheese soup).  I then added refried beans.  I then placed  mixture in each tortilla.  I took advise of someone else and put a few spoonfuls of enchilada sauce on bottom of my 13x9 pan to avoid sticking.  (Pan held 10 tortillas, mixture made 16-so froze the rest for later.)  Poured rest of sauce over tortillas.  And then I used mozzarella and mild cheddar to top tortillas.  Baked 20 minutes.  Everyone liked it!!  Thanks for the recipe!

Great and easy recipe!  Only suggestion: spread a little of the enchilada sauce on the bottom of the pan; it will help to keep them from sticking.

My family really enjoyed this meal. The only thing that I changed that improved on it was I used velveeta cheese that I melted in the microwave instead of cheese soup

These are great exactly as directed with a side of sour cream! And MAN, do they make a lot of food! After putting about 1c of enchilada sauce on the bottom to prevent sticking, I put my filled tortillas in a 9x13 baking dish -- it only fit 6 of them and I had 1/3 of the filling and tortillas left over to make a fresh batch in a couple days or freeze. These are very filling, especially if you add the rice, which is a great way to stretch the filling on a budget. This is a keeper for ease, taste, and being budget-friendly with typically on-hand ingredients!

This was yummy this frist time I made it (following the recipe, but without rice). Second time, I did not have any cheddar soup on hand, so I just mixed in some shredded cheese. This time I also used rice and I added a can of green chilis for some heat. Rolled them, put it in a pan, poured enchilada sauce, them topped off with more shredded cheese. Delicious!

This recipe is crazy fast and easy.  I added half a package of taco rice to the meat/bean mixture. Personally, I think it needs more of a kick, perhaps green chilis would work for those who like a little heat.   I will definitely make again and again.

My family says they really enjoyed this meal. I added the rice, but I will not on the next attempt, so that I may enjoy it as well. It was rather thick. But everyone gave me a thumbs up with their mouths full, so I'm not complaining. I did double the batch but I see, one batch was enough for 1 dinner, now we have leftovers, but should me no cooking the next night. :) Thanks!!

I don't use the rice or soup everything else stays the same. I also only use 5 tortillas because we like them big and fat! Also don't forget to grease your baking dish a bit. These will stick. I  spray foil and cover these. We prefer the cheese to stay gooey and the tortilla to stay soft. I bake at 350 for 30 minutes.

Wow couldn't have been easier or tastier. Only 2nd time I have EVER tried to make Enchiladas they turned out scrumptious with plenty of leftovers. I changed this a tad added only 1/2 can of refried beans & then 1/2 can mexican store bought in the can rice. With the rest of mixture mostly as is it made a huge amount of filling for 12 large size white flour tortilla shells. I also chopped onions left them on the outside to add to final topping since one of my kids hates onions. I chopped some tomatoes/onions/lettuce & dressed the top with a shake of my fav. taco hot sauce & let each person choose what items they wanted on top. The soup worked perfect what an easy idea. My husband was in heaven he said you can make those again any time. Cool thing it truly is 1 pan stovetop to make the whole mixture which goes together fast after you brown the hamburger. I also see we can all change this up to fit our individual tastes if there is something you like in the mix just add it, you can't mess this up. For a newbie to making mexican food this was divne.. Would work great with pork or chicken also. I also opened a small can of chopped green chiles put those in the mixture.. Makes a large batch plenty of leftover for another nites dinner this week. Make sure to add some great toppings U like even some sour cream would be great. Looks just like you are serving restaurant enchiladas by dressing the top. Also make sure to let the pan sit about 10 min out of oven so it sets a tad. yum!

Yummy! My family ushally likes just plain burrios but I wanted to try something a bit different. We all loved it. I didn't have any refried beans or enchilada sauce so I made my own and it came out great!

These were fantastic!!  I questioned using the cheddar cheese soup but they turned out great!  I did use Spicy Refried Beans which gave them a little bite, will definitely be making these over and over!  A++++++  I topped with light sour cream and jalepeno peppers! YUMMMMY!  Can't wait to make them again!

This was easy. I cut this in half to use half a lb. of beef and ended up with 8 enchiladas. I cooked the onion in with the meat and only used a quarter as it was plenty for me. The soup made the filling very wet, loose, and hard to work with though so maybe a shredded cheese would have been much easier? I left the rice out. I didn't have enchilada sauce so I used mexican tomato sauce. I only had corn tortillas so that is what these got. AR Taco Seasoning I recipe made these just right. I didn't care much for the canned cheese soup though so I will use shredded next time.

I much prefer corn tortillas for enchiladas, but you must heat them with a bit of butter first to soften them. 
I also prefer shredded sharp cheddar to the cheese soup. 
Instead of the taco seasoning, try it with a bit of the sauce and some cheese mixed with the meat.

These were pretty good for fast, no fuss enchiladas. I'd like to try making some more from scratch next time. The things I did differently are: I omitted the rice, and topped the finished product with sour cream, lettuce and tomatoes.

We have never eaten enchiladas before and we tried this recipe. It was fast and easy and everyone loved it. The only changes I  made was I didnt add the beens, I actually spread them on the tortilla shell to hide them from my kids. And I used bulk taco seasoning and added less then called for, that way it wasnt so spicy! A new favorite in this house

Adding the onions was a terrible idea they really took away from the taste.  I suggest not using the onions at all; and just mixing the beef (after cooking) with the taco seasoning, beans, soup and rice, heat it in the skillet and serve as tacos, with tomato, lettuce, sour cream, cheese, etc.  The flavor was great in the skillet, but after baking the tortillas ended up being mushy and the enchilada sauce was overwhelming; it was much better before baking.

Did not like the flavor.  After reading maybe it was because of the cheese soup?  I won't be making these enchiladas again...bummer.

This was a decent meal but the ratio of meat was way off - at least for us. I made it with the 1 lb of hamburger, 93% lean. I started to add the soup and beans and thought that this was way too much. It would be more bean and cheese soup than anything. I only added 1/2 can of each and for us, I still would want more beef. I think it's just a personal preference. Otherwise, all I did different was I used Nacho Cheese Soup instead of plain cheese soup. I would make it again but with 1-1/2 lbs or more of burger.

I did not care for this recipe at all.  Since I don't care for cheddar cheese soup, I took another reviewers suggestion of using Velveeta cheese instead.  I didn't like the consistency of the filling (way too thick) and didn't care for the taco seasoning flavor.  I wont be making this again. :(
