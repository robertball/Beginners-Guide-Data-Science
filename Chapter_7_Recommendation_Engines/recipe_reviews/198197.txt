Because this recipe was so different, I was immediately intrigued. First let me say that I had decided from the get go to kick up the onion sauce. Instead of adding sugar, I brought out the sweetness by chopping the onions and then caramelizing them in my skillet with butter and added black pepper plus onion and garlic powders to the sour cream. So delish and it tasted very much like a yummy dip. My girls tried this before I did and immediately gave it four stars! They said the waffles tasted very similar to when we cut up pieces of Italian bread and mop it up in seasoned bread dipping oil. They were on point with the exception that the seasoning was in the waffle! So good! Altho we all thought this was great, I think this would make a better appy. I would cut the waffles into semi thin wedges and place them in the oven to crisp up. As I said, the sauce is thick enough to be used as a dip and I would just add my bacon into the mix. Paired with a spinach salad, Ash and Ty called this a really fun dinner. Thank you Ashley!!

My family couldn't get enough of these! I omitted the bacon, used only whole wheat flour, and used honey instead of sugar for the waffles and the topping.  After tasting the topping, I added a little mustard to help carry the flavor of the waffles!  Great recipe!

I made this for dinner but nobody liked it very much. The herb flavor was overwhelmingly strong and I couldn't bring myself to eat an entire waffle. I'm sorry to say, I won't be making it again.

I'm gonna be honest. It smelled REALLY good. I followed the directions to the letter, but the finished product was not in line with the aroma. I think it was too rich with herbs. They were overwhelming the rest of the waffle. If you decide to make this I would not use anywhere near the amount of herbs it calls for. My wife particularly didn't like the sauce either. It was a good try though.
