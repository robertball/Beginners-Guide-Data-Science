I recently tried the recipe for a wedding cake and it was positively wonderful.  I used crisco and as recommended butter.  The trick to not having greasy frosting is to whip the crisco and butter for at least 20 mins or until it is light and fluffy.  I also added additional vanilla flavor and almond flavor for a richer taste.  My recipe was modified to cover a cake that would serve 40 people. I had nothing but continous compliments and serveral request to make more cakes.  Thanks Jeannie

I used this (with a few alterations) to ice my parent's 50th wedding anniversary cake. I used salted butter and I also used evap. milk. I went with other suggestions to use less sugar (6 cups was best for our taste). This was so easy to make and it had wonderful buttercream flavor! Had enough to add raspberry glaze to it and made a raspberry buttercream filling for the French Vanilla anniversary cake. Was great for piping decorations and borders also. Highly recommended for those looking for a GREAT buttercream frosting!

I used this icing for my Mom's wedding cake this weekend, and everyone complimented on it.  I took other reviewers advice and whipped the butter and shortening for 10 minutes, and it had none of the greasy taste of shortening.  Also, if you use the butter flavored Crisco, the frosting will turn out very yellow-unsuitable for a wedding cake. I stopped at 4 cups of sugar for the main icing and then added one cup to the remining frosting for the piping.  It tasted great, looked professional, and held up well at an outdoor wedding.  If I even find myself doing another wedding cake (heaven forbid), I will use this recipe again.

I am also a big fan of Rick's Buttercream and use it as "my" frosting, but wanted to give this one a try. I was worried when mixing it up that it would be too soft for piping but it was fine. Note that this will yield more of an ivory frosting due to the butter, you won't get a pure white frosting. I definitely prefer the flavor of this frosting using butter as opposed to frosting in the Rick's Buttercream. I will use this one when I don't need it to be pure white.

Great frosting!  I used about 6 cups of sugar instead of the 8 called for.  And, I beat the shortening and butter for about 20 minutes before adding the other ingredients.  It turned out great.  Thanks.

I picked this recipe because it seemed really easy to make and it was my first attempt at buttercream icing. The result was awesome!! Very easy to make and I received so many compliments! I had enough icing to cover a birthday cake and 20 cupcakes. I creamed the butter and shortening for 20 minutes like a previous reviewer suggested. I didn't use all the sugar that the recipe called for because when I got to 6 cups I stopped and did a taste test, perfect for my taste(20 servings). This recipe will be used over and over and over again. Thanks!

This recipe is very similar to the one i use currently. I add a tsp of popcorn salt (or very fine salt) to take the sweetness off a bit. I also add an additional 4 cups of confesctioners sugar to stiffen it for piping decorations i.e. roses, leaves etc.

I made this recipe to decorate my son's birthday cake. It was great. It was very easy to make and use. I only made half a recipe and had enough for the whole cake and piping. This recipe held up extremely well. It didn't melt or run. This recipe was also very yummy. I put it on a chocolate cake and it covered it very well and you didn't see the brown. Everyone loved it a big hit that not only looked great but tasted great also.

I liked the texture and flavor achieved by using both shortening and butter. As I always do with frostings calling for shortening, I used hi-ratio shortening which is far superior to the grocery store variety. I also added 1/4 tsp. salt to heighten flavor. I didn't measure the milk, just added it little by little until I had the consistency I wanted for piping onto cupcakes.

Wow! This is fantastic frosting. I used butter flavored shortening and added about 2oz more milk to make it a bit creamier and softer. This is, by far, the greatest tasting frosting I've ever tasted.

Delicious frosting that was easy to make, took coloring well, and held up well to piping and decorating. It had a nice flavor that was sweet but not too sweet (made exactly as directed with half butter, half shortening that I blended for approx 15-20 mins before adding sugar to get nice and fluffy) and complimented the strawberry cake I used it on very well. will definitely use this recipe again!

I loved this recipe!  I decorate wedding cakes all the time and this recipe does not taste greasy and is very easy to work with.  It is a little sweet so I would start with maybe 4 cups of sugar and add a cup at a time until you find the the level of sugar you are comfortable with.

Absolutely THE BEST cake frosting I have ever made! I originally became "hooked on" "Ricks special buttercream frosting" on this site, and while it is still a great frosting recipe, I decided to try this one due to the great reviews. It has a much smoother texture and as of now, I will be using this for all my future cake recipes... it is just THAT good! I think creaming the butter and shortening together for 10-12 minutes had alot to do with the great consistency. (Thanks to previous reviewers who suggested this.) Also, I used half and half instead of milk. And I decreased the conf. sugar to 4 cups. (did not use the frosting for decorating, so as others have said, you may need to add more sugar for this). I also used just a tad less (butter-flavored) shortening (maybe 1-2 Tbsp.) as I like the buttery taste. I would highly recommend this recipe for anyone who likes a delicious soft buttercream frosting. Edited to add that I now replace the half & half with heavy whipping cream... makes the frosting so light & fluffy!

This recipe is great.  I used less sugar so it wasn't too sweet.  I also used evaporated milk and the frosting had a great, rich flavor.  Since I used the evap milk, I had to compromise on the white color.  I never liked buttercream frosting but now that I know what the "real thing" tastes like, I am a convert!

This is my go-to frosting for large quantities of cupcakes. I only used 3 cups of powdered sugar on these cupcakes and 3 tablespoons of whipping cream. With the very rich chocolate cake (Fabulous Fudge Chocolate Cake) is was perfect smooth and not too sweet.

Easy to make. Remains durable on the cake...doesn't melt, soak in, or run off of the cake.  Not as creamy as I'd hoped when reading the title of the recipe.  More like a "Mom's homemade frosting" than wedding cake frosting.  Very sugary, but not overwhelming.
Kids would probably like it!

This worked really well for me!  I let the butter and criso whip for about 20 minutes as was suggested.  I only added 1/2 the amount of milk but included 1/2 cup strawberry puree.  It was delicious.  I put it on top of cupcakes baked in ice cream cups and it was perfect! The frosting tasted a little like strawberry ice cream.  I had a ton left over... and have been eating it with a spoon since then.  Also, I was worried it was too soft, and wouldn't set up, but it set up very nicely.

This is a delicious tasting frosting and VERY easy to work with.  I was a little wary of beating it so long, but it did work so there was no greasy taste at all.  I must say that I wasn't exact with the measurement for the sugar.  I just kept adding it until it was the consistency and flavor that I liked.  It's not too sweet and very spreadable.  I found that I did not need to add any milk.  My only complaint was that the frosting never set at all which was fine since a three year old at the party "bumped" into it and I was able to fix it with no visible sign of a repair.  It simply spread right out even on the next day. For decorating purposes though, I might have used a different recipe so it would be stiffer. I will use this again for sure.

Holy cow, is this good!  I halved the recipe and it covered a sheet cake just fine.  I used skim milk and 3 cups of powdered sugar and mixed for 20 minutes on medium speed with a paddle.  It came out light and fluffy and marvelous.  I have to stop myself from baking a cake every weekend just to have this frosting!

I basically just halved this recipe and used all butter and no shortening. I used 3/4 cup butter, 4 cups powdered sugar, 1 tbsp vanilla bean paste, and 4-6 tbsp heavy cream. Perfect topping for my vanilla bean cupcakes. =) The heavy cream makes the icing light and fluffy.

Excellent recipe!!!  I used it to frost cookies and cream cupcakes and it was a HUGE hit!  Thanks to the reviewers who suggested beating the butter and shortening for 10-20 minutes, that really made the difference in taste!

Best Wedding Cake Frosting recipe I've found.  I search and tried numerous recipes for months.  My sister in law had decided I would make her wedding cake.  She wanted an autumn theme.  So the way I made this recipe was to use buttered shortening and regular pure vanilla extract in place of the original recommended ingredients.  It not only was as it delicious as the original recipe but held up well.  Her wedding was in the desert and the Frosting never melted or softened.  The color was perfect also.  She then had a separate reception two weeks later and I made a three tier Wedding Cake and the Frosting held well throughout the entire evening.   The cake was beautiful, and the frosting was delicious.  Guest kept coming up and asking if I was a professional cake baker and wanted to hire me....This Frosting Recipe comes out perfect every time.....

WOW!  I am so impressed with this frosting!  I made it exactly as written with the exception of "white" ingredients (i.e., vanilla and shortening).  I did have shortening, but it's butter flavored (the only kind I buy) and so the frosting didn't turn out white.  BUT WHO CARES?!  I was going for taste, not look.  I handed a beater to my husband and his eyes about popped out of his head because he loved it so much!  My only qualm is that this makes A LOT of frosting... I mean A LOT.  So, I'll use what I need for a birthday cake and then tomorrow I'll whip up a spice cake, add a little cinnamon or pumpkin pie spice to the frosting and use some there.  I still think that I'll have some left and if I do, I'll probably add some lemon extract and yellow food coloring and put it on a lemon cake and give it to the neighbors!  Next time I think I might scale it down a bit. Overall... easy, fast, wondeful texture, tasty and holds up well!

I have found my perfect frosting recipe! It held up to a warm CA day, used my mechanical gun with a variety of tips - each a beautiful sucess, and the flavor was smooth, sweet, and not greasy at all. I did cut back to sugar by 2 cups and used French Vanilla flavor. Thank you for this recipe, buttercream will never be the same for me again. Oh, and did I memtion the rave reviews from my guests when they tried it with my Strawbery yogurt cake?:)

Wow this really good! I used 9 cups of powdered sugar. I beat the shortening and butter for 15 min and that helped a lot!! Very good:)

I've tried several recipes in the past, this is not one of my favorites.  I made a double batch, and stopped after 9 cups of sugar.  I followed the advice of reviewers and mixed the butter and fat for 10 mins.  I added literally a splash of water because it already looked so soft.  The texture is something akin to whipped cream.  It forms soft peaks at best.  Like all shortening-based frosting, this leaves a feeling like there's a coating in your mouth.  It is NOT a crusting buttercream.  I'm sure it would have thickened up if I'd added more sugar but it would have been unbearably sweet.  This is for a wedding cake; luckily it's NOT an outdoor wedding and it does not require ornate piping.  Won't use this again.

This is a great icing, especially if you plan on piping the icing.  It holds up really well.  I did think there was a bit too much sugar for my taste, but you can easily reduce that like other reviewers suggest.  I wanted to make a chocolate buttercream for my little sister's birthday, so I added a box of instant chocolate pudding to the icing a a 1/4 cup of baking cocoa (so it's not too sweet).  This gave the icing a very nice chocolate flavor and still stiff enough for piping but soft enough to spread easily on a cake or cupcakes.

the recipe,as is, made enough to generously pipe frost 24 cupcakes.  I still had enough frosting to probably pipe out dozen more....day 1 frosting was excellent and so light and fluffy( i let it mix for 15 minutes and only used 6 cups sugar) by the end of day 2; frosting started to change texture and could definently taste the ingredients separating. overall, i loved it!! best when used immediately.

My two year old and I had a great time baking a cake for Valentines Day, and eating the frosting.  I made a half batch, but used 1 teas. vanilla, and 1/2 teas. almond extract.  The flavor was awesome, and the consistancy was perfect for spreading on the cake.  Beating the mixture for 5-10 minutes is key.  It thickens and creamy the frosting by adding air.  Also, I added a touch of red gel coloring to make it pink.  No lumps - perfect!

Great recipe. I was looking for an icing recipe that could withstand the hot tropical weather outside, but I stopped at 4 cups of sugar & it was just nice. Many of my friends don't want to eat sweet things these days. Thanks!

i was worried this was going to be too sweet, so I took the suggestions of previous reviewers. I doubled the shortening, used 1/4 c milk, and 5 cups of confectioners' sugar. I also added 1/2 tsp alm extract.  This turned out really light, not too sweet, and "this tastes like wedding cake frosting" (a comment from my husband who wasn't sure what i was trying to accomplish :)  I'll use this recipe again!!

My cake is the HAPPY BIRTHDAY NOELA cake posted pic. Very good and easy to make. I ddint really change much just the amount of shortening I used. I used 1 cup butter, and 1/2 cup shortening. I measured 6 cups of powdered sugar, but then just mixed in what I needed until I like the consistancy. I also added almond flavor instead of vanilla, just cos thats how she likes it. I used electric mixer to fluff it up. My mother in law raved about her birthday cake as did my family. I liked it so much Im gonna use this recipe for my daughters 16th birthday in a few week.

First time I tried a buttercream frosting and it was a hit! I follow the other reviewers' advice to lessen the sugar and it perfect suit our taste.  Though I was opted to make some slight changes since I couldnt find shortening...so I used salted butter instead as suggested by another reviewer.  Thanks for the recipe...will definitely use this again.  Though the color isn't pure white, I think I could still use this for my aunt's wedding cupcakes. :-)

Wonderful! Perfect every time I use it. Easiest recipe by far. The only change I made is I added 4 teaspoons of almond extract. I just like a strong almond flavor.

This frosting is amazing! This was my first attempt at making homemade frosting and I am very impressed with the results. The only thing I changed was, I added a few tablespoons of amaretto in place of some of the milk since I was frosting and Italian Amaretto Cream cake I made for my Father-in-laws 50th. My 4 year old and I couldn't stop dipping in for a taste :-)

For me, this is a keeper

I have definately had better buttercream. I did improve it by using raspberries and a cup of sugar and 1/4 water to make syrup. Let it cool and poured into the frosting. Had a beautiful fresh raspberry flavor. Husband enjoyed it.  I didn't really like it on its own but great for a base of adding fresh fruit flavors to it.

This is a great frosting for wedding or holiday cakes. It is very sweet, so I would cut the sugar by a cup or two.  Very fluffy and pretty, but not a very "flavorful" frosting.

Really sweet, but good icing.  Not recommended for decorating of cakes (especially if you live in Florida).  The butter melts the icing so that you cannot decorate with it very easily.  But, for a simple frosting, it was very good tasting.  Thanks!

I'm not much of a cake fan, but I prepared this frosting to use with "Happy Birthday Cake" from the allrecipes.com website.  In fact, it was a perfect match.  I'm not enough of a frosting connoisseur to know how closely this recipe compares to that found at the bakery, but it tasted close enough for me.  I can't imagine how sweet this would have tasted with the eight cups of sugar that it calls for.  Following other reviewer's recommendations, I only used 4 1/2 to 5 cups of sugar, and that was a great plenty.  It got rave reviews from my wife.

I never use shortening, only butter. This tasted way too much of butter & it was too watery. I found this out after I had put it in the pipeing bag or I'd have added more sugar to it to thicken it up, I iced my cup cakes anyway & put them in the fridge hoping that will do the trick. I chose this recipe because it had no egg, Im saving my last egg for another recipe. I wont be using this recipe again.

I've made several variations on this frosting over the years. In the summer I will use all shortening so it doesn't melt. I also like to double the vanilla extract (and add almond) to make it extra tasty!

Simply amazing! Light and fluffy took other's advice and beat butter and shortening for a min. of 10 min. For decorations like roses do not add the full 1/2 c. of milk makes the frosting too runny otherwise it was perfect!!  For filling between layers I added crushed Oreo's again simply delicious.

Better than Wilton's creamy and perfect. If I could give a 10 I'd give a 10. Suggest using unsalted butter.

This frosting is amazing and if you whip the shortening and butter long enough, Is super light and fluffy.  I used it for a small three tier wedding cake with just one batch.

Really liked this recipe.  I didn't have any milk so I used 1/2 & 1/2 and only had regular vanilla but it was fine.  I actually didn't like it until the next day.  Yummy!

Doing a wedding cake in two weeks and just did a mock up version, This recipes is great. I used evaporated milk instead and also only used five C of sugar and it was a hit with my family.  I also let the cake sit out for seven hours and the frosting has not run and the cake still looks good!

Tasted amazing but definately runny... I let the butter soften though... perhaps that was my mistake. Took fairly well to coloring gels. Although i had to use a whole thing of red for it to be red and then it tasted bad....all the other colors of frosting i made were amazing though

This is a definite crowd pleaser, it's basically my go-to decorator buttercream recipe, but on a larger scale.  It also works to use water in place of the milk, the taste isn't altered.

Used the ingredients for 1/2 the recipe and it came out scrumptious with plenty to cover a double layer 9" round cake.   It is important to whip the butter and shortening real well before adding alternately and in small portions the milk, sugar and vanilla.

This recipe is fantastic!  Cream crisco and butter well (few minutes) before adding sugar.  I too add a little popcorn salt.  Add PS one cup at a time and incorporate well with each cup.  Use all 8 cups!  Then, begin adding milk to your desired consistency.  It's awesome!

I found that adding butter makes it melt. I used it for my Senior Project. I added butter and it didn't come out the way I wanted it to. I wanted it fluffy but w/ butter it doesn't make it fluffy it makes it melt.

So good!  I used 1 t. vanilla & 1 t. almond.  I also beat it in my kitchen aid on high speed for 15-20 minutes.  It really gives it the "bakery frosting" texture.  I brought the extra frosting to work and my co-workers were eating it with spoons!  It's that good!!!

I wanted a softer frosting for cup cakes I halved the recipe, and then used only 2 cups of powdered sugar, and didn't have to use any milk and it was great, I did make sure to beat the shortening and butter together until they were light and fluffy like the other reviews said. I had 2 dozen cupcakes and more than enough frosting for all of them. If I had wanted a stiffer frosting for piping I could have used more powdered sugar, with excellent results. Thank you for a great buttercream frosting recipe, I will definately use this one again and again.

Very good. I wasn't sure about the shortening but I took the tip to cream the butter and sugar together before adding the rest.

This is my favorite buttercream recipe. I use this when making special cakes for family events. Holds up well to a variety of borders.I never measure the sugar. I just dump in the whole 2lb bag, then add the milk until its the right consistancy. I also use real vanilla, not clear, because I'm usually using this for birthday cakes and dont need it to be pure white.

This was excellent frosting.  I used all organic ingredients, scaled it up by 50% and put it on the wedding cake recipe submitted by Larisa Townsend.

I recommend letting your cake cool before finishing this recipe, so you can apply it immediately.  Goes very well with fresh strawberries!

My family usually doesn't do well with cake frosting because it's too sweet, but this recipe is great!  It spreads on nice and thin and isn't sickeningly sweet.  Not only that, but with a little powder meringue added it works well for decorating as well.

I, the frosting failure of the universe, was able to make a delicious buttercream frosting with this recipe. It is a first. I didn't even follow it exactly. I think I shorted the shortening a little... but even using this recipe as a guide gave me fantabulous results. Who knew shortening made frosting so good??!

This frosting is absolutely delicious! I used it on my husbands birthday cake. He loved it! I only used 6 cups of confectioners sugar though.  I used the frosting for a 9x13 cake and still had a lot of frosting left over.  I melted the remaining frosting and poured it over my cream cheese pound cake. I will use this over and over!!

This is definitely wedding cake frosting.  It was good, but since I was going to put it on a strawberry cake I decided to mix the strawberry glaze (that was suggested with the strawberry cake recipe) and it came out really good.  I was having trouble getting the strawberry glaze to thicken up enough, but when I mixed it with this recipeI didn't have any problem at all.  More than likely I will use this combination again.  Everyone at church just loved it.

This turned out to be really great for me, and I think it makes a huge difference in the type of butter you use. The first batch I made with a store brand butter which resulted in a "plastic-y" taste (for lack of a better word to describe it)... did NOT taste like butter, soI added a tsp. of butter flavoring to it, which helped immensely. Tasted exactly like buttercream candies. My second batch I made with a name brand butter and it even smelled better while mixing. Almost forgot, too... we didn't have milk or cream, so I subbed French Vanilla coconut milk creamer that I had on hand. Maybe that's what made it taste so good.

I needed a sturdier icing than what this recipe gave me the first time I made a batch so the second time I used 1 1/2 cups shortening and 1/2 a cup of butter instead and made sure to whip it 20 minutes (as recommended) using the paddle attachment to keep from whipping in too much air like I did the first time with the wire whip. Added the extract to the shortening and butter while mixing and ended up only using 5 cups of sugar (make sure to sift!) and did not add the milk. Came out perfect!! Very smooth and perfect for using with a heavy cake.

Image this frosting for a birthday cake and it was wonderful. It seems light and has a great flavor. Everyone had compliments for it and my husband said it tasted like what his mom made ( she is an amazing cook ). Will use it from now on. Love it!

Overall an average recipe. The sugar needs to be cut way down and all tat butter and shortening make it very greasy unless you beat them together for a good 15-20 min as was said in previous posts. For all the trouble I don't see myself making this recipe again, I think I'll stick with cream cheese frostings!

Scaled down to 10 servings.  I did not use all of the sugar recommended as I felt it was way too much.  I suggest you add half the sugar and then taste the frosting as you add more in 1/2 cup measurements.  I also added a dash of salt to take the edge off the sugar and balance the frosting out.  I used home made vanilla extract and bourbon in place of the milk.  Delicious on a spice cake!

I made this frosting yesterday to top the Wedding Cake recipe.  I followed the recipe but stopped at 4 cups confectioner's sugar and frosted a 1/2 sheet cake.  It makes a very tasty frosting.

this is a perfect frosting that gets lots of compliments...I use water instead of milk, adding a little at a time and beating well each time...makes it even lighter...yum!

Really good frosting.  I halved the recipe, which was exactly the amount I needed for 20 cupcakes.  I used it for the "Sweetheart Cupcakes" (from this site), piping it on in a big swirl.  I followed others' advice about beating the butter and shortening for approximately 20 minutes.  Others have said how sweet this frosting is - and boy, is it ever sweet - but in my opinion, that's what frosting is.  I didn't use the clear extract, and the frosting still came out very white.  I will definitely use this again as it was so easy to make and work with.

I had tried this recipe years ago and have adapted to something just a bit tastier.  I use one can of store bought frosting, 1 cup of shortning, 3 teaspoons of "cream of boquet" and 1 of almond extract plus the called for sugar. It turns out very flavorable and stands up well for the 3 tier wedding cake I had to put together.

This frosting is light, fluffy and delicious, and very easy to work with.  After reading the other reviews I added the sugar 1 cup at a time until it was just the right sweetness for my taste, 6 cups was good for me.  It did melt a bit in the mid day heat, so I had to decorate quickly and the refrigerate until serving time.  I will use it again.

Yummy! I made a coconut cake for my daughter's birthday. I used this frosting, substituting 1 cup of solid coconut cream for the shortening, and coconut extract for the vanilla, then added flaked coconut and it was sooooo good. It si going in my family cookbook for future use.

I was looking for an all white frosting and found this one.  As with any recipe I scaled the ingredients one by one to my family's own personal taste.  I used 1 1/4 C. Crisco, 3/4 C. Butter ( less to ensure I got white frosting), Dropped the Milk to 2 tsp.( wanted a thick frosting but spreadable) and the Confectioners' sugar to 3 C.  Originally, tried 4 C. but was still way to sweet.  As recommended by another viewer I whipped the Crisco and Butter individually and then together.  If I could rate the reviewers it would be 5 stars based on their advice however, I feel that something has been omitted in the recipe and rate it a "3".

I have tried buttercream frosting after buttercream frosting to match what I taste on the outside. But alas, I find them way too sweet! I cut this sugar in half and still found it still too sweet and the icing looked really shiny like shortening, which didn't matter so much since it was being covered with fondat. The search continues.

This turned out good.  It was a nice consistancy and had a good flavor.  But, I could taste something a little off, maybe too much shortening.  I used pure vanilla and the frosting was still very white.  I might add less sugar next time as others suggested and maybe less shortening.

I made this but used all butter and no shortening.  I had no shortening and didn't want to make a run to town.  I also only used 5 cups of powdered sugar.  I frosted the cakes (2 9 x 13's) and had lots of frosting left to pipe with.  Even after that I still had leftover frosting.  I will use again, but maybe cut down the serving size.

I just made the heavenly white cake with this frosting for my son's first birthday cake.  I decorated it with M&Ms but the frosting was WAY too sweet.  Perhaps I would try it with half the amount of sugar...I was happy with how firm the frosting came out and how easy it was to spread on to the cake but it was so sweet I didn't even want to save the rest of it.  4 stars for firmness + 2 stars for flavor = average score of 3 stars

good recipe, but instead of milk i used heavy cream ( 1/4 cup ) and also added 1/2 tsp. almond extract, used the full 8 cups of sugar. what i did was to the butter and crisco i added 1 egg, beat til it looked like mayonise, added the rest of the ingredients and beat on high speed of mixer for 10 - 12 min.

I would like to be able to give this a 4 1/2, it has a very good flavor, but I had to cut the milk in half and even when I did that I added an extra 1/2 cup to a cup of the confectioners sugar.  I did need a bit of a thicker consistency though because I was piping this on to cupcakes.

I used this recipe mainly for it's adjustable consistency and it served me well. Adding a little more powdered sugar makes it better shape-able to pipe in 3D designs like flowers.

I have found my new go-to! SOOOO easy to make and SOOOO good! just made a wedding cake for one of my best friends and used this frosting. rave reviews! Definitely followed the advice of others to beat butter and shortening for 20 minutes. As it is hot right now in AZ, I needed the full 8 cups (1 bag) of powdered sugar to make it thick enough to not run off the cake. Even with that I still had to do some touching up post transport.

Thanks for sharing this recipe!!!

Way too sweet. I even added less sugar.    Not very smooth.   I whipped it for a long time.   Not quite what I was looking for

Not quick;  need to mix butter & crisco for at least 15 before adding other ingredients.  For my typical purpose, a  cake, need only a half batch.  I prefer some almond flavor too.  Maybe a little salt.

I've tried a lot of recipes to find the right one for textured cakes. This is it! Just stating my own wedding cake business. So, it has to be good! It's not too shortening? tasting either-which I'm always wary of.   I do add a little extra vanilla to mine. Sometimes some almond flavoring. The trick to getting smooth frosting that doesn't pull is that first step: blend the butter and shortening until smooth! I didn't do that the first few times and, albeit still beautiful, the frosting looked a little thick because it pulled when spread. After the 3rd try, I finally got it! It was smooth as silk! And easy to fix dents and dings after delivery. I love this frosting for decorating! Note: because it is so smooth, you can't use it to make cake not slide on a cookie tray. Lesson learned. ??

I have made this twice in the last couple months and it's my new favorite.  Very spreadable , but still hangs together well.  I used 1 tsp. clear vanilla and 1 tsp. almond flavoring.  I used it to top the White Almond Wedding Cake that is also here on Allrecipes and EVERYONE loved it.  I think you could flavor it however you want.  Maybe raspberry next time. Thanks for a great recipe.

I made this for a 50th wedding anniversary cake, I followed the reviews that mention whipping the butter and shortening longer than normal. it whipped up nice and didn't taste greasy at all. I also used 6 cups of sugar instead of the 8. The party loved it

Made a ton - more necessary than a 3 layer circle cake. Way too sugary, my 10 year old sugar-loving son didn't even finish his cake, citing the icing was too sweet.  I agree that it was way too sweet. Won't make it again.

When I was small I couldn't wait for my parents to bring us kids home a slice of the wedding cake. I was in love with the frosting. This is the recipe that the Milwaukee School system uses for cakes. BUT...you have to beat the shortening and butter for at least 15 minutes. It changes the molecular value of the butter and shortening. When adding the powder sugar, let it beat another 15 minutes to add lots of air to it..Now.. I'm going to have to make a cake tonight, just to add this frosting.

Great taste! My first attempt at buttercream. I was able to pipe it with a pastry bag, but I would prefer it to be firmer next time. I halved the recipe, because I only needed to frost 24 cupcakes. It was a good amount. I didn't alter the recipe in any way other than only making half.

I doubled this recipe and frosted over 5 dozen cupcakes...and still have a good amount left for another project. I used my Kitchen Aid and beat the butter, shortening and sugar for 20 min and added the powdered sugar alternating with the milk. I substituted 1 tsp orange flavoring and 1 tsp lemon flavoring in place of the vanilla. The Almond White Wedding Cake is wonderful  with this icing recipe

I made this recipe exactly as the directions suggested. It drives me crazy when everyone rates but totally changes the recipe.  I did whip the butter and shortening for about 15-20 mins before adding the other ingredients for a smooth consistency. It turned out great! Everyone loved it!!!

This is my go-to buttercream icing recipe. I've used it many times, in many different types of weather, and it has yet to disappoint. Be sure to use real butter -- it definitely makes a difference! The only thing I change is to add one Tbls (rather than one tsp) of clear vanilla and one tsp of clear imitation butter flavoring. Also, you may want to add a little less milk as needed for piping or for using food coloring. Other than that, be sure to beat the shortening and butter together for at least 20 minutes before adding the other ingredients to avoid a greasy texture, and you'll have heavenly icing that will be requested over and over again.

This is an awesome recipe. I looked at previous reviews, used the evaporated milk, almond and vanilla essence. But because my two teenage boys do not like too sweet frosting, I replaced two cups of icing sugar with two cups of very fine almonds. Wow ! What a lovely texture and taste. I would not use the almonds for piping though.

Just finished making this, 1/2 recipe but exactly as given.  All I can say is the two one star reviews must have missed something, or accidentally used cornstarch instead of powdered sugar???  No way you can say this is tasteless, hold false reviews to yourself, please.  At least explain what you tasted and maybe we all could help.  If fact, look at 95% of the butter cream recipes out there -- they are almost all identical, give or take yield!!

I followed this recipe exactly and loved it.  My non-cake eating husband loved it as well!  I will used it always.

I made this icing for a test cake that I made for my bridal shower on the weekend. I am going to be making my own wedding cake and wanted to test it out first. This icing was delicious and I made it as directed except that I used vanilla extract and not clear artificial vanilla extract. It just didn't come out very white, which is fine with me.

Made this last weekend, it is fantastic! I made it exactly like it says, I mixed it for about 15 minutes and it was not greasy, it was lite and just sweet enough. My son said the best part of the cake was the frosting.

This is the first icing that I tested out for an upcoming wedding cake that I'm baking in several weeks. It's absolutely delicious. Everyone who tried it loved it, I'm definitely going to use it for THE cake. 
I followed the recipe completely with no alterations and it turned out fine, it was also very simple.

Amazing recipe.  I only used half of the listed sugar.  Any sweeter would have been too much for me.  I also "eyeballed" the milk just adding until I had the consistency I needed.  The key is absolutely to beat the butter (real butter) and Crisco for 20 minutes on one of the higher speeds.  This piped wonderfully.

This is a very good recipe for what I affectionately call it- lard icing (as opposed to buttercreme or the whipped creme kind).  I made a big discovery here...a box of confectioner sugar is 16oz, but that does not equate to 2cups in a box.  There is more in there!  So, mine came out too sweet and may be the pb. some of the others are having.  One box is more the right amount for a typical sheet or double layer, of course more if you are using it for decorating also.

To sweet for my liking... all i could taste was the shortening. It might have been the typed I use. But it was not good... I'm not much of a sweet person.

Wow! I finally made my own frosting that turned out correctly, I'm horrible at making frosting, I used the previous suggestion of creaming the butter and shortening for awhile, then I gradually added the sugar. then the vanilla and slowly added the milk, the only difference I did was to add a heaping spoonful of sourcream before adding the vanilla, which made it so I needed an extra cup of sugar and 1/8 cup of milk but it turned out tasting wonderful and with a fluffy texture. yum! No more store bought frosting for me!

This was a good frosting and I will make again.  I gave it four stars because it was initially way to soft for decorating.  After refridgeration it was a good consistancy.  I halved the recipie and maybe I should add the milk a little at a time.  I also think it needed more vanilla.  I will make again with those changes because it was a very good amount for decorating.

I liked the taste - that was really good. But I didn't care for the stiffness. I actually used this for a wedding cake that I was testing out. I couldn't create a smooth finish with this loose a consistency. And I certainly couldn't make flowers. I ended up adding some seedless raspberry jam and using it for filling on another cake. In the end, I would possibly make this frosting again, but would never use it for any decorated cake.

I used this on cookies, and it tasted great! My whole family loved it! As a plus, it saved in the fridge for weeks and still tasted good! Thank you for sharing this recipe!
