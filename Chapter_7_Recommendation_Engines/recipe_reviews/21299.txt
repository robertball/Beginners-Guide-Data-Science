Amazing.  You never would have guessed that this is made from tofu.  I made a macaroni salad with it and served it at the company picnic.  Not a single person guessed that it was a non-dairy mayo.  Great for my family who have severe dairy allergies

this recipe didn't taste like mayo...just tasted like tofu. So, i decided to revise it a little to make it taste like mayo. i looked at the ingredients for actual mayo and i added cream cheese, garlic, paprika, lemon juice and more salt. Pretty soon it tasted more like mayo. 
Nice try on the recipe though.

I can't believe this is tofu mayo.  It is wonderful.  I have tried fat-free and low-fat mayo but none were as good as this.  This has the added bonus of actually being good for you.  I can't wait to experiment with different spices for my next batch.

Great recipe!  I added 2 garlic cloves and a little bottled lemon juice and I used dijon mustard instead of mustard powder.  I also added an egg yolk because I like a slight eggy taste in my mayo.  I WILL DEFINITELY MAKE IT AGAIN!  It's probably even creamier when the tofu is frozen first, then defrosted.

Incredible!! I used dijon instead of dry mustard and added paprika, garlic powder and lemon juice. I didn't measure; just sort of eye-balled the extra additions. I let it sit in the refrigerator for a couple hours and served with the Fruity Chicken Salad and Quick biscuits from this site. Wonderful saturday afternoon meal.

really easy to make, and quite good too. it doesn't have the distinctive taste of real mayonnaise, but tofu takes on the flavours of whatever it's combined with. therefore, it still works!

My first thought was, if it is really that easy and that tasty, why doesn't everyone make tofu mayo? After tasting it my thought was, why the heck have I not been making this for years. I am not vegetarian but I like it better than regular mayo!

For those who are unfamiliar with vegetarian/vegan cooking this will not taste like traditional mayo.  However, this has been one of the best tofu mayo I've had next to the store bought.  The only change I made, like some of the other reviewers, is to substitute brown mustard for the dry mustard.  I saved this recipe and I feel it is definitely worth trying!

This does taste exactly like mayo. It's amazing! The texture is not like mayo, it's a little thinner and of course not as creamy but it is a great substitute for mayo and one I will be using from now on. Thank you so much for this recipe.

Used prepared brown mustard instead of dry and followed the recipe otherwise. This "mayo" is a keeper!

I was pleasantly surprised with this. As with most "alternative" recipes, I was not expecting identical taste. That being said, it was quite good. (I followed the original recipe.) After tasting, I used it in a chicken salad where mixed with other flavors no one had a clue it wasn't egg/oil based store-bought mayo. Only after it was entirely consumed did I reveal that it was tofu. Several folks wanted the recipe. I'll be using this in future endeavours.

I made this recipe yesterday and it was much better than I thought it would be. I used lemon juice instead of vinegar. I used a medium tofu and next time I would use the firm. I am going to play with this recipe and spices until I get it just right for me. Thank You.

I don't really get the mayo taste when I tried this, but it is tasty dip for veggies. I added more salt and mustard for a tangier flavor.

Tastes very similar to the tangy zip of that ooo Miracle Whip, which was just what I was looking for.  I love this mayo substitute.

I don't know if I did something wrong or what, but I tried so hard to like this recipe.  I just couldn't.  It smelled aweful and in no way did it have the same consistancy as mayo.  I just couldn't get past the smell.  I tried adding more things, cream cheese like another reviewer suggested.  Sadly, I ended up washing this down the drain.
