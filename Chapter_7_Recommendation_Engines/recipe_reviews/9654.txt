Although the recipe was easy to make, my cookies turned out hard. We like our cookies soft. Any suggestions on how to do this? I/we really like the flavour of this recipe and I would like to use it again. Thanks for submitting it.

The dough was very easy to roll and cut, and not having to chill made this recipe easy and quick to prepare.  I baked for less time for a more tender cookie, and frosted for valentine's day.  Adding vanilla or almond extract would probably make a more flavorful cookie, but these weren't too bad. Husband and kids loved them.

this recipe was quite easy to make but the end result was REALLY DISGUSTING. the cookies were rock hard and they were too sweet. i'd try making it again but i'd rather spend my time and efforts trying to find a better recipe.

The first time I made them, they came out good.  I made them with cinnamon applesauce instead of eggs.  But now they taste more like tough biscuits with sugar whenever I make them, whether I use eggs or applesauce.  Would more butter help?  I'm going to try that next time.

This recipe was extremely easy and yummy. We have 5 people living here and everyone one of them loved the cookies. They didn't come out hard for me, I had noticed a few revies said that it did... I thought they were excellent and definitely suggest trying them if you're short on money or time.

the cookie itself is not bad.However it is a bit hard,prefer a chewy cookie.I think some baking soda or baking powder might help with the problem.
It does need some flavor.Original batch was cooked as the recipe said,second batch cooked with 1/2 teaspoon baking soda and butter flavoring and the result was much better.A softer cookie with a rich butter flavor.

If you want easy good cookies then keep looking cause this is not the recipe for them.  These cookies are terrible if you do not want to waste butter flower and other materials do not make these cookies.  I cooked this recipe cause it looked quick and simple only four ingredients WOW simple then I tasted them and WOW they were terrible.  I followed every step and made them again they still came out terrible and I a fairly good cook.

This was an easy recipe, and the flavor is good (I added vanilla; however, the texture was more like a cracker, a Wheat Thin, perhaps.  Won't use it again.

I like this recipe because there is a lot of experimenting and changing u can do. If you aren't going to cut out shapes, have less butter, more egg and cook at 325 for 20min. They will be softer and have a cake-like texture on the inside.

I found that this recipe was very simple and easy to make.  The cookies turned out good.  Had to add more flour than called for, but other than that the family enjoyed them.

These were wonderful! Such easy cookies to make and if you make them nice and thick they don't get too hard. They also go wonderfully with cream cheese frosting! :)

This didn't turn out at all... I wasn't even able to get it rolled out... when I got the recipe finished it was just a crumbled mess. I accidentally added all of the eggs at the same time, that might have caused it ... even so, it wasn't good.

I chose to soften my butte to room temperature rather than melting it. Regular AP Flour has gluten in it...so the more it's mixed, the tougher it will become, but in order to thoroughly incorporate all the flour (due to having very few "wet" ingredients) I no choice but to mix...and mix. This in turn activated the gluten making it more tough. 
Nice effort, but I won't repeat this cookie.

Easy, Good, Soft.  I didnt even roll it out, I just put dough in my hand, squished it, and slapped it onto the pan. Turned out perfect, or what I consider perfect because they were soft & yummy.  Bland, but I'm okay with it, still sweet. It's like a tea cookie.
