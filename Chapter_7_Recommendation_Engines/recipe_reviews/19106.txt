This is the absolute best chocolate cake I have ever tasted!  It is so moist and decadent.  The only thing I do different is that I add more semi-sweet chocolate and melt it a little before adding it to the batter!  Tastes good even without frosting!

really really good! I made this out of desperation because I needed a cake and had no eggs. everyone loved it. I might try adding some baking powder to lighten it up. It was very gooey and yummy though. thanks!

We absolutely love this recipe for cupcakes. They are the moist cupcakes every.  We do add an extra tablespoon of Unsweetened cocoa but otherwise we follow the recipe exactly!

This recipe makes a delicious, moist chocolate cake, very easy to make because it only requires the use of one bowl and a wooden spoon (no mixer).  It is even better with the following small tweaks:  first, instead of water, use buttermilk for additional moistness and flavor;  stick with Hellman's mayonnaise, not a strong-flavored one like Cain's;  use Penzey's high fat cocoa powder and Ghirardelli semi sweet mini-chips for the richest chocolate flavor;  use a bundt pan greased and floured with cocoa powder instead of a 9 X 13 pan, and bake at 350 for 50 minutes.  Drizzle chocolate ganache over the top, or serve with a dollop of whipped cream.  The cake is actually even more moist and flavorful when it is two days old, so make it ahead of time!

This cake was moist, but did not rise very well. I will try it again just to make sure it was not the baker's error.

Delicious!! Very moist and rich. Family loved it without the icing on it. to me I thought it tasted like a cake like brownie. The box cake mix may never get used when I make chocolate cake.
