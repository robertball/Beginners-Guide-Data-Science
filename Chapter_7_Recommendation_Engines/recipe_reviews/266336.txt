This is a tasty jelly that I played with just a little bit to come closer to the seasonings I would actually use in a pie. I  subbed one cup of brown sugar for one of the cups of white sugar and added a tsp of vanilla, a pinch of allspice, and a pinch of clove.  This set a little looser than I would normally like my jelly but not overly so and it was delicious!

I made this recipe, but could not get it to set up.  I reboiled it added more pectin and still not setting up.  Never had this problem before with jelly.
