I used 1/2 c. vinegar and 2 1/2 c. because I don't like a strong vinegar taste. It turned out really well and this was my first time cooking a roast. The roast was perfectly tender and quite tasty...even better the second day.

I just made this recipe - it was my first pot roast ever - and it turned out great!  Soooo easy.  My husband rated it 5 stars :)  However, I do think that next time I won't use as much vinegar as the recipe calls for.  But other than that it was fantastic!!!!!

A really fantastic dish.  I used a cross-rib roast and halved the recipe, and it was still great.  I didn't have as much sour cream as the recipe called for, but I thickened the gravy with a little milk and cornstarch.

I have made this recipe before but with two important differences.  Instead of vinegar, use two large dill pickles chopped into 1/2" pieces.  The acdid in the pickles tenderizes the meat, just like the vinegar does but it adds a nicer flavor.  To all the other ingredients, add a package of dried mushrooms (boletus is best) that have been rehydrated in warm water.  This is really one of my favorite recipes.

Very good, as long as you like vinegary flavors.  The "gravy" was very watery, and not what i would consider gravy, but it tasted very good, and we sopped it up with bread like Gourmetfox reccomended.  Perhaps cooking it un-covered would make the gravy thick.

This recipe was too sour. The use of white vinegar was over powering. My husband refused to eat it. Now I have a lot of sour meat to eat on my own.

No one in my family liked this.  The meat was tender but it tasted like vinegar.  Maybe I should have cut back on the vinegar like another review had suggested.  Thanks anyway.

We liked this. It was a unique flavor. We added potatoes and used a fig balsamic vinegar and it came out very good. If we would have used white vinegar it would not have been very good. I would suggest any balsamic vinegar or at least a red wine vinegar . White vinegar is pretty harsh and is used often for cleaning coffee pots. ANY higher quality vinegar will improve this dish. We also doubled all the veggies. this recipe makes a lot of sauce. We reduced the extra sauce with some tapioca and it made a great sauce that we used on baked pork chops a few days later.

This sounded like such a winner that I almost invited guests ... thank heaven I didn't!  The only thing that can be said for this is that it tasted good BUT the appearance is AWFUL ... even after I stirred in cornstarch paste to thicken it.  Don't try this!

Rated after making modifications. Per the other reviews, I did a half cup of red wine vinegar and 2.5 cups of water.
