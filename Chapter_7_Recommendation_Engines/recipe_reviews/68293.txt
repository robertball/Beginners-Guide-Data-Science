Excellent recipe , as suggested adding cardomn is traditional as is using almond instead of vanillia. All norwegian cookie recipes are based on butter sugar almond and eggs.

I left out the butter extract and they were almost as good as my grandma's.  They are great!

This is an awesome recipe and delivered a very flavorful cookie.  We added 3/4 tsp of Cardamom for a little more traditional flavor.  We used a pizzelle maker, and they did not roll well but they tasted great!

Great easy to use recipe. Added a little Cardamom for an ethnic taste. Liked that this recipe used milk rather than cream and you couldn't taste a difference.

Great cookie!  Rolled nicely into cones.  I dipped the tops in melted chocolate and then filled with stabilized, sweetened whipped cream and mini chocolate chips.

I needed more milk and got two dozen big ones out of this...but they turned out very nice (if not evenly brown).  I did not use the butter extract.

I was thrilled to find this online, as it as close to my own Gram's as I could hope for.  Ditto on the adding almond extract and cardamom - made it exactly right.  No complaints about texture at all -- just right!  We have an ancient, well-seasoned cast-iron krumkaker iron, which no doubt contributed to the success.  : )

I didn't make any changes to the recipe. The krumkaker came out too sweet and chewy.

I added 1/2 tsp baking powder because I saw it on another recipe but I don’t think it was needed. I didn’t have butter extract and I used 1% canned milk. This was my first attempt making these and I think they turned out well. I’m sure I will make them again with the baking power next time.

Good recipe. We opted for cardamom instead of butter extract. I added an extra 2Tbsp flour, so they stayed together better during baking. This might be my measuring, or maybe the weather. We baked them for 52 seconds in my 2- krumkake electric cooker.

I made this recipe exactly as printed.  It was my first time ever making Krumkake.  The flavor was excellent. I did not use Almond extract or Cardamon. In all of my Norwegian cooking I have found very few recipes that call for either.  Cardamon is a bit more prevalent in Finnish cooking.  I didn’t have the cone firm so I rolled the cookie around a sharpie!  Taste the same either way!  Time to make another batch!!!  Yummy!

Wow. These were DELICIOUS! My hubby and the kids devoured them. I do not have a Krumkake iron so I used my pizelle iron. I think they would be thinner if I had a Krumkake iron. But in the end it worked well. Mt pizelle iron is electric and it to 1 min 10 sec to bake them.

not sure I like this recipe exactly as much as the one with the whipping cream, but it'll do in a pinch!
