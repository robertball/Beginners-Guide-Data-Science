I followed this recipe to the letter adding only chopped walnuts.  It was wonderful.  Not too dry, not too moist - like Goldilocks' porridge - "just right".  I made 2 loaves at once - one in a pyrex glass loaf pan and the other was a teflon coated pan.  The glass pan did a much better job.  Would recommend a glass loaf pan over a teflon one.

I have been experimenting with different banana bread recipes on this site.  This so far is my favorite.  I made this using 5 small bananas and the flavor was excellent.  My nieces and nephews devoured this in no time at all.  I did add 1 teaspoon of cinnamon and 1/2 teaspoon of nutmeg.  I will share this recipe with my friends.  Give this one a try - you will like it!

Thanks for the great recipe!!! This bread is fantastic -- and very forgiving for a "wide margins" kind of cook. I tossed all incredients together, eyeballing, used four bananas, because I had them on hand, and used sour cream, mixed it all up with a large salad fork (new home is very spare - all equipment in boxes). I had to add on about 30 minutes extra baking time (I suspect because of the extra banana) before my knife came out clean (lowered to 300 degrees after an hour), but in the end it was delicious.

Next time I think I may throw in 1/2 cup chopped walnuts. 

............. P.S. I used the Splenda/Sugar Baking Sweetener, rather than pure, real sugar, and my unwitting boyfriend was none the wiser. 

............. P.P.S. If you make extra, you can slice the cooled banana bread and pack in individual sandwich bags, then put all in a large freezer bag and you'll have snack-ready portions for whenever you want them. Take one out of the sandwich bag, pop on a plate in the microwave for 1 minute on medium power. It thaws and heats back up to almost as good as right out of the oven.

Thank you for the wonderful, classic recipe! I made it for the first time last week, and again tonight! Sooo good.

Outstandingly moist, with a tender crumb. The flavor is superb, as well. This is the recipe I reach for again and again, a true classic. Adding a few dashes of cinnamon helps to complement the banana taste. This bread freezes perfectly for up to 3 months, if wrapped in foil, then placed in a zip-lock freezer bag. Delicious!

The bread was really good but there was so much batter, I could have made two loaves.

very nice, moist bread.  i had to bake it for 1 hr 40 min until the center was set, which put a thick crust on the bread.  still tasted good.

Superb!  I even cut down on the butter a little and it still turned out great.  The people at my husband's work said it was the best banana bread they ever had.

this was pretty good. i was looking for a recipe like the one my mom gave me, which i lost..again! that one also included sour milk, except to make the sour milk you just mix baking soda with the milk for the sour milk and let it sit while you mix everything else. that is what i did with this recipe. i also mix the dry and wet ingredients seperate before putting them together.

Love this recipe. I've been searching for a good banana bread recipe for a while and found this one, I've made it a couple of times and have added extra bananas and nuts and it turns out great every time. The only change I've made is to mix the wet ingredients together first then add in the dry. I also sprinkle some sugar on the top before putting it in the oven to give it a nice sweet crunch (my mum always used to do that). Yum! ****I used 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar this time and didn't miss the extra 1/2 cup.

Now in fat free (almost :)! I replaced all of the butter with applesauce and omitted the sour milk entirely (didn't need the extra moisture.) Also added crushed walnuts. I've made this recipe the original way and the new way, and while removing the butter makes it a little less rich, it's quite good with the reduced fat.

Awesome recipe.....it was great to find it as I lost my grandmas and this is it to a tee. FYI....if you don't have sour milk, add 1 tsp vinegar to your milk and mix thoroughly.

I have been looking for a new banana bread recipe and this one is the BEST of the many that I have tried from this site.  I added 1 tsp. cinnamon, 1 c. chopped nuts and baked it in a 9x5 loaf pan for 1 hour...PERFECT...the crust and inside were just right, the flavor was terrific and the bread was good plain or toasted.  This recipe is a keeper! Thanks to Jeannie Meyer for sharing this terrific recipe with this site!

This is the best banana bread I have ever eaten. My husband loves it, and asks for it often. He says all other banana bread just does not taste as good, I agree. This banana bread is moist and flavorful, not too sweet. The recipe is perfect.

I have used the same banana bread recipe
for 20 years.  I tried MANY others without 
luck, until I tried this one.
I doubled the recipe and both loves were gone 
in a few days, something that my kids have 
never done with other banana bread.
This one is a keeper!!!

Average recipe, 3 star's for the original, still found it rather dry.
I reduced the sugar to 1 cup, only added 1/2 cup of milk and 1/2 cup of sour cream; and an extra banana. This makes a heavier loaf, with less rise but is very moist.

I LOVE this banana bread! I normally use a betty crocker recipe, but decided to try a new one.  Another recipe I tried on this site that had hundreds of reviews, did not taste good at all to me or my family- and I used a lot of bananas for that recipe!  I only had two overripe bananas, but decided to try this easy recipe, rather than throwing them away.  With less banana than called for, it tastes like a sweet bread with a taste of banana.  The texture is really wonderful in this bread- not too heavy, and not too dry or too moist. Perfect :)

This bread is simple but very moist, and really delicious with a little cinnamon and nutmeg added, or some brown sugar, cinnamon, and flour mixed and sprinkled on top. my favorite banana bread.

I've made it at least six times and it comes out perfect everytime. It does take a long time to bake, approx. 1hr 10 minutes. I now make it in small containers I can give it away in & bake them for about 35 minutes. Its faster and a great gift idea. I do not add any other seasoning/spices, I think its perfect.

It was delicious.  I had enough batter for 2 small pans. I threw in a half cup of pecans and it was superb. I also cut back on the sugar just a bit, since my bananas were overripe and sweeter than normal.

Grandma's Homemade Banana Bread was delicious! I was so happy that it made two loaves so I could share one with my parents. Next time, I'll bake it for less time, as the outside was a little more crusty/hard than I prefer.

Delicious indeed! I used this recipe to make muffins instead. I baked them for 25 minutes at 350 degrees. It yielded 18 muffins.
I used whole wheat flour as that was all I had.
I cut down the sugar to 1 cup.
I also made sour milk by mixing 1 tsp of vinegar to the milk and I let it sit for 10 minutes.
I love how it's a simple recipe and the results are so good! It also gives you room to be creative and add different spices or fruits to mix it up. I found that even with whole wheat flour, the texture was still moist and fluffy. Mmmm I'm waiting on my bananas to blacken so I can make another batch this week.

Wonderful!    I "snuck" in walnuts by crushing them so my son would try it-he loved.  Several of friends had it and asked for the recipe.
I found it baked more evenly in an 8" x 8" pan instead of a loaf pan.

I loved this banana bread.  My sis-in-law, who doesn't like anything, really enjoyed this.  I added 1/2 tsp nutmeg and 1 tsp cinnamon.  Howerver, I had no sour milk.  I made 1 cup of sour milk by adding 1 tsp of vinegar to it and letting it stand for 10 minutes before adding to the recipe.  I forgot to measure out 1/3 cup and used the whole cup of milk.  I added 1-3/4 cup more flour.  I was so worried it would be ruined, but it turned out great.  The best banana bread I have made so far.

very nice bread. IF YOU LIKE A NICE LIGHT AND FLUFFY LOAF THIS IS FOR YOU, IF YOU PREFER A DENSE AND HEAVY BREAD, IT PROBABLY IS NOT YOUR FIRST CHOICE.  I didn't have butter and used margarine and it still came out beautifully.  I did use 3/4 brown and 3/4 cup white sugar to make a bit of a darker loaf, and added 1/2 tsp. cinnamon as other reviewer suggested.  I don't generally like cinnamon in banana bread but I found that it did just enhance the banana flavor; not overpower it.  I will do this from now on.  The recipe yield as written needs more than an 8x pan.  I used my 8x pan, as it is intended as a gift to a friend, and also made a small loaf pan so I could taste and review.  I added nuts and chopped dates.  It is a very nice moist fluffy light loaf, not dense and heavy.  No dryness at all.  Very nice flavor.  Used sour cream in lieu of buttermilk.

I cannot make enough of this for my four boys (husband included).  They eat it as fast as I make it!  They love it for snacks, breakfast and as a base for fruit and whipped cream.

I had some friends say it was the best banana bread that they had ever eaten.  Thank you!  I thanked them to, but told them I couldn't take the credit and let them know where to find it.

Decent but way too sweet for me. I looked at some other recipes and some call fro only 3/4 cup sugar. I think that would be way better. Let the banana flavor be the star.

My family has been making this one for years and it's a nice, moist basic banana bread. Of course, if you want something really unique and different, don't try this (try peanut butter banana bread from this site...AMAZING). It's just a plain honest-to-goodness banana bread.

This came out very good! Just like another reviewer said, it came out not too moist or dry...just right! I made 3 mini loaves and only had to adjust the cooking time by about 7 minutes...they still came out great! Oh, and I didn't have any "sour" milk on hand and just used regular no fat milk and it did not effect it all all!

YUM!  Absolutely delicious. I was worried it would be too sweet, but it came out perfectly. My family and I finished off the loaf in one day so I'm making another. You have to use a 9x5 pan though, and not the size listed in the recipe, or it will overflow and make a mess.

Best banana bread ever! This is a great recipe! It was so easy to do, couple of suggestions though - cream butter and sugar 1st so there are no lumps of butter. Sift all your dry ing seperately before mixing into the batter. I used skimmed milk as didnt have any sour milk (or lemons to make sour milk)but it still turned out great! Great easy recipe! My boyfriend and his co-workers raved about it!  UPDATED(20th March).....As this was so good and was eaten so quick, I thought I would bake some more with extra for the freezer! This time I tried 1 1/2 cups all purpose flour and 1/2 whole wheat flour and 1 cup of white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar. I added an extra banana too(last time I only had 2). I was too scared to substitute applesauce for the butter this time as I thought it might take away the richness, but would love to know if anyone has tried doing that to lessen the fat content??????

Delicious! I made a few changes after looking at the reviews. I put in 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar, and it was still pretty sweet so I would maybe even only put in 1/2 cup of sugar total. I used regular milk instead of sour milk because that just sounded gross to me! And then I always add cinnamon to my banana bread.
Then, I spooned the mix into a muffin tin and baked at 350 for 22 min and came out with 16 delicious banana bread muffins! Overall it tasted great!

Delicious! I reduced the sugar to just 1 cup and used vanilla soy milk instead of the sour milk (that was what was in the fridge). Came out yummy and moist. Thanks for a great recipe!

Delicious! For some reason I never have good luck with banana bread, but this one was easy and the bread is fantastic! Only thing I did differently than recipe was use regular milk and a dollop of sour cream; I also added some cinnamon. Thanks for the recipe, it was great!

This is a great recipe. I forgot to change the temperature on the oven to 325 F since I used glass so I had to take the bread out of the oven before the top was fully cooked to prevent it from burning but the bread still turned out great. Thanks for sharing.

Delicious!! I took some advice from the others and made some additions.  I added 1 tsp. of cinnamon and 1/2 tsp of nutmeg, 3/4 TBS. of Baking Powder and I used Vitamin D milk instead of sour milk.  Turned out excellent!  Made it last night, and it's almost gone.  The only thing I would warn you about is to make sure you use a big enough loaf pan, I used a size bigger than the directions called for and it still dripped over the sides a bit, still turned out great!  Love it.  Thank you for the recipe.

I have searched for years to find a recipe that would measure up to the banana bread that my  grandma used to make and I have found it.  Just add a few ground nuts and a little cinnamon and I am sitting in her kitchen once again.  This bread doesn't last long at our house and I hope my grandkids have fond memories of their grandma's banana bread as I have of mine.

Amazing! I live in the south where my bananas brown very quickly, and i figured why not make some bread? This recipe was delicious. The bread is so moist and flavorful. I did use soy milk with 1tsp instead of lemon however due to my lactose sensitivity, but other than that i wouldn't dare change a thing!

Recipes took alot longer than 1 hour to cook. closer to 1hr 45 minutes (just a heads up to others). Taste wise, its pretty good, outside is crunchy inside is moist and soft, the way we like it. Only thing i would change next time is to cut back on the sugar a little bit as I think 1c. would be more than enough. Also dont mix all together at once, blend sugar and margarine, then eggs and milk, vanilla then flour and last step add banana's only until mixed in, dont over mix :) Hoped this helped :)

I've been searching for the "perfect" banana bread recipe for ages.  This is it!!  The only change I made was to use 1/2 the sugar and yogurt in place of the sour milk.  EXCELLENT!!

I doubled the recipe but used only 1 c. white/1 C. brown sugar.  It tasted good, but was a little rubbery in texture. I like the fact that you can dump all ingredients together. I replaced the sour milk with yogurt.

Since we'd just moved, my cookbooks and recipes were packed away, so I popped on here to see if I could find something similar to my grandmother's banana bread. Ingredients wise this came the closest, so gave it a try. It was wonderful! I did add 1/2 tsp cinnamon and also 1 tsp lemon juice -- really makes the bananas stand out!

I needed to use up 6 bananas and some outdated milk so I doubled the recipe to make 2 loaves. This seemed like the perfect recipe, but it was missing something in the taste dept....not sure what. Have made lots of BB bread in my time, and I am still trying to think of what this one seemed to be missing...maybe increase salt to 1/2 a tsp.?

Great Banana bread, whole family enjoyed it.  I did take one reader's suggestion and creamed the butter and sugar very well then added the bananas and sour milk before gently mixing in the dry ingredients.  This makes a lighter bread.  
p.s.  I added about 3/4 of a cup of chocolate chips which were a nice addition.

I have been searching for THE banana bread recipe and this is THE ONE!! I use Mexican vanilla when I bake and it was unbelievably full of flavor and moist.  The use of butter instead of the standard vegetable oil gave the bread a wonderfull richness.  I've now thrown all the other recipes away.

The name of this banana bread should be changed to "The Best Banana Bread Ever!" I am picky about banana breads--I never found one that had the right texture or had the right taste. This one is perfect! Sweet and moist, and if you want spices or anything else, you can add them to suit your tastes. I would love to try some of the other yummy looking banana breads on this site, but ever since I made this bread for the first time a few years ago I have the hardest time trying anything else! Fantastic!

Made this last night, and it's delicious. Just what I was looking for.  I didn't have sour milk, not did I know how to create it, so I used a little less than 1/3 cup milk, and added a spoonful of sour cream.  I also added cinnamon.  You may want to grease the pan a little more than lightly, I did lightly, and the whole bread stuck to the bottom.

Wonderful!! But, oooo so....sweet!  Of course my kids LOVE it, but a little too much sugar, I suggest cutting it in half!  

But it was so moist!  I used sour cream instead of the milk, threw it all in the food processor and blended, also, I added 1/4 cup of butter.  I will definately make this again w/ the modified sugar and it will then be a 6!!!

YUM YUM :)

This recipe is incredible.  Because I had an overabundance of over-ripe bananas in the freezer, I ended up X4 the recipe.  The turn out is a very nice not too cakey or heavy muffin/loaf.  I substituted the sugar and put 1 cup brown and only 1/2 cup white.  HINT:  instead of adding all the ingredients into the bowl at the same time, I do it this way so that the ingredients incorporated more evenly.  Whip the marg/butter and sugars together until creamy smooth, than add the eggs one at a time.  Now add the bananas.  The flour, baking soda, and salt should be sifted together into a different bowl, add this mixture than add the vanilla (I always free pour the vanilla, as you can never put too much in).

I'm always on the look out for a good banana bread recipe & this is my favorite so far. It has a nice texture & stays moist. I usually have problems with the crust getting too dark before the inside is done, but this turned out nicely, the crust was a deep golden brown & quite tasty! I followed the recipe to the letter, next time I will try some cinnamon & nutmeg. A great recipe!

This is a great recipe. No wonder it has been handed down for so long. It is very moist and full of taste. I used Buttermilk instead of Sour Milk. Turned our great! This is going into my personal recipe box. Thanks for sharing!

This tasted very good!  It started to get a little too close to the edge of the pan so I took an ice-cream scoop of batter out and made a muffin.  I also added a cinnamon-nut-brown sugar streusal-type of topping when it was half way done which gave it a little extra sweetness.  I will definitely keep this recipe.  Thanks!

Great simple recipe.  I didn't have sour milk so I substituted with normal milk and I used 1 cup of sugar rather than 1.5 cup, and it was still delicious.  Very moist inside, nice crust outside.

Very good basic bread. Did not have milk so I dolloped in sour cream, used a mix of brown sugar and white. Don't tell Grandma but I also splashed in 1/4 cup Spiced Rum by Captain Morgan. Wanted to bake the bread fast so used a muffin tin and baked for 20 min at 375 Degrees.

The second time I made it I followed the directions exactly. It was moist and tasted great. (I did have to bake it 20 minutes longer to finish. Maybe I'll bake it in two loaf pans next time to see if that helps.) But overall, it was fantastic. The first time, I used 1/2 brown sugar and added mini chocolate chips - very good but didn't want to rated a "modified version."

All I can say is, YUMMY!  This recipe was very simple.  I didn't have sour milk so I used sour cream instead.  I added a few dashes of cinnamon and nutmeg to taste.  I also mixed the dry ingredients separate and added them last.  Will definitely make this again!  Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe!

The bread was good for sure however very sweet. Maybe a tad too sweet and I had to increase the baking time by 30 minutes. Next time I will try cutting the white sugar in half and substituting in with brown sugar.

This is a great recipe. I have made it about 3-4 times and each time the bread was gobbled up in 2-3 days. I like brown sugar so I always subsituted a 1/2 c. of the white sugar for brown. I also prefer the mealy rather than moist taste so I overmix it. Lastly, I just mixed milk and a bit of vinegar and let it sit while I get the other ingredients out and measured to make sour milk. Will definitely make again!

So, I had three awful looking bananas (very brown and smooshy) and thought I'd try cooking up some banana bread instead of tossing them out. My wife has a recipe that she swears by, but it's really not that good, so I wanted to try a different recipe. I tried Grandma's Homemade Banana Bread, and wow, it's the best recipe for banana bread ever!!

Excellent banana bread!  I had a similar recipe that I lost and this must be it.  I did have to make some adaptations because I didn't have everything the recipe called for.  I used sour cream instead of buttermilk.  I only had 2 banana's and I recalled my old recipe using half brown and half white sugar, so I used that, too.  I also added some toasted and finely chopped pecans.  I did have to bake it in a 9x5 in loaf pan as there would have been too much batter for the smaller pan.  This tasted just like I remember; moist with a great texture and with good banana flavor (even though I only used 2 med/large bananas)  I am so glad to find this recipe again.  Thank you.

Lots of flavor but very sweet. Wish I trusted my instinct to cut back on the suger but wanted to try it as is first. Next time I will, plus I'll add cinnamon and nutmeg :)

I LOVE this banana bread!  The only problem I had was that there was so much batter that I had to leave it in the oven for an extra 35 minutes!  It's still delicious but the outside is a little one the "extra-crispy" side.  I also added 1 cup of chocolate chips to sweeten it up a bit :)

I have also been looking for a recipe like this similar to one my grandmother made years ago.  My father LOVED her banana nut bread and he LOVES this one too.  He asks for it constantly, so of course I make it whenever he asks.  Only change I made is the sugar - I go with 50/50 white/brown sugars and use 1T fresh lemon juice to sour the milk.  Thank you for a perfect BNB recipe.

This was wonderful! I usually don't like bananas, but I couldn't stop eating this batter. I soured my milk with white vinegar, added a cup of walnuts, cut back slightly on the sugar (1 1/4 cup), and added a splash more vanilla. It tasted delicious and had an excellent consistentcy! I will never need another banana bread recipe again.

I really liked the texture and moistness (I even added an extra banana) but I kinda felt like it was lacking something like cinnamon.  Next time I will add a little and see if that's the difference.  Overall pretty darn good!

This is my 'go-to' recipe for banana bread!  I make it low-fat by using 1/2 C. butter and 1/2 C. applesauce, and will use any flavor of yogurt instead of the sour milk.  I always add a generous dash of cinnamon and a sprinkle of nutmeg.  A handfull of craisins adds a nice change of flavor.

I can't keep any in the house.  It just disappears.  I use buttermilk for sour milk and I put walnuts in it the last time.  I used a pyrex loaf pan and it went way over the top of the pan, so I bought 2 and now, it's just perfect for 2 loafs.  Very moist and the flavor is superb. Thanks for this recipe.

This is the best banana bread recipe I've tried so far! Absolutely delicious and moist. I used 3 large bananas instead of 2. As others have suggested, I added 1/2 teaspoon of ground cinnamon and 1/2 teaspoon of ground nutmeg. Surprisingly, these spices didn't overpower the actual taste. I also added chopped walnut to give it a little bit of nutty flavor. It turned out great! Try it...

This was just an okay recipe for me.  I have been trying many banana bread recipes and have yet to find one that really stands out.  I found that I had to put it into a 9x5 loaf pan and then I cooked it for an additional 20 minutes and it still came out a little on the underdone side on the very bottom.  Go figure?

This went over very well with my co-workers!  I did make a couple of changes though - I ran out of oil so used the equivalent in unsweetened applesauce.  And, instead of all white sugar, I used half a cup of brown sugar.  I didn't have sour milk, so used 1/3 cup of warm milk mixed with 1 tsp of white vinegar.

Then, I mixed in 1/3 cup of coconut and 1/3 cup of chocolate chips.

I will DEFINITELY make this again!

This bread came out yummy.. I, like PIETZSCHE, used 4 bananas. I used 2 disposable foil pans size 8" x 3 7/8". I didn't fill them all the way and ended up with one a little bigger than the other.. The small one was perfectly cooked in the 60 minutes, the other took about 15-20 minutes longer.  I used 1/2 tsp of pure vanilla extract which turned out ok. I also used sour cream in place of the sour milk.. My kids love this bread. It is the first time I have ever made banana bread and it was so easy I am sure I will be making it again. Thanks for sharing Jeannie!

The taste and texture were great!  I used half brown and half white sugar and subbed commercial buttermilk for sour milk.  The texture is moist, but not more than other banana breads I've made/eaten.  The only trouble we had was that it made so much batter, that I could have used two pans.  I put it on a baking sheet in case it spilled over and I'm glad I did because it would have been a terrible mess if I hadn't.  Also a good thing about using the baking sheet under it:  the spilled part was just as tasty as the loaf and we needed the extra because my family gobbled it all up!  I had to bake it 75 minutes to get it cooked all the way.  I'll make it again!

Definitely the best b-bread recipe I've tried. I used leftover lemon yogurt instead of the sour milk and added extra vanilla, a splash of lemon juice, and 1 c of finely ground walnuts. We devoured it in less than 36 hours! Really good with about 1/2-inch thick layer of sweet-cream butter spread on it!!

Husband kept raving about this bread. I didn't add the whole amount of sugar. Only added 1 cup to this and it wasn't noticeable.

Saving this recipe to use every time I have some over ripe bananas. Very simple recipe and uses every day pantry items so I don't have to worry about having some special ingredient in the kitchen.

I added chopped walnuts and this added some additional flavor and texture. Very nice bread.

I just made this for my family today. It took a little longer than suggested to cook (about 80 min.) and I made two loaves, on with chocolate chips and one without. This is an absolutely DELICIOUS recipe, and no one can wait to have a piece with breakfast!!!

I thought this recipe was easy and yummy. I replaced the sour milk with sour cream and used just a little less butter (only 1/4 cup) and it turned out great. My boys loved it.

This is my 2nd time making this delicious banana bread. I use 4 bananas & add 1 cup of raisins. About 10 minutes before done, I sprinkle almond slices on top. I have experimented with other recipes, but none compare with this one. I have a nurse come in once every 2 weeks & she was here one time when I had just taken it out of the oven. We did our thing and when she was ready to leave, I gave her a nice thick slice.......response after she got home......this is the BEST BANANA BREAD I have ever eaten. So needless to say I have bookmarked it and it is now my go to recipe. Thank you for such a delicious recipe.

Very good but made an awful lot. Made two loaves instead of one. Too much for my family. Had to freeze some of it. Added nuts and sprinkled the top with cinnamon.

It was delicious! I literally just threw everything in a bowl and mixed it.  I did not have sour milk so I just used whole milk and it worked great. I also did not have a bread pan so I made it in my stoneware square pan and it baked well and for the same time. The only thing different I will do next time is add chopped walnuts or pecans!!! Very easy recipe.

i've tried many recipes until i came across this one and this is by far my family favorite...no more searching for that perfect homestyle banana bread for me :D  Followed the recipe to a T only adding 1 cup pecans (uncut) then cut myself and everyone just loves it.

This recipe is definitely not for ONE 8 x 4 pan. The batter that spilled over onto the bottom of the oven and the unevenly baked, still raw 8 x 4 loaf sitting on my stove are proof of that. Please correct this recipe. It is for TWO 8 x 4 pans or ONE 9 x 5.

love these, turns out fantastic every time! our Grandkids love making it with me! First thing i do is mash bananas and add to the sour milk, seems to bring out the flavor in them for a stronger banana taste.

After losing my own recipe I used for years in a housefire, I tried this one and it was really good.  I did not have any sour cream in the house so I used oil, also added chocolate chips and a tablespoon of cinnamon (my old recipe called for it) and it was really tasty.  rises nicely, nice texture...also made muffins (cooked for 25 minutes) and they turned out nice.  I have made this twice since and had equal success. This will be my go to recipe for sure.

The only change I made was to add a cup of chopped walnuts. I don't think I've ever had better banana bread. It was so moist and flavorful. Thank you so much for sharing this recipe!

HI i have spent all day looking for the right banana recipe, there was one on here a few years ago, that after you baked them you left it in a pan and put it in the freezer for about 2 hours. But i cant seem to find it. so i'm going to give this a try. but i'm going to make them into muffins. will let you know if they are what im looking for! Doreen

Very nice, I combined this with another recipe, subbing the sour milk with sour cream, and adding baking powder, cinnamon and nutmeg.  The best banana bread my family has ever had, they say!  Everyone took it in their lunch the next day.  Next time will have to make two.

I have tried so many banana bread recipes and this is by far the best. I added a little cinnamon, The recipe called for 1 1/2 cup white sugar and I used 1 cup of white and 1/2 cup of brown sugar. I also substituted sour cream instead of the sour milk.

I agree this is the last banana bread recipe you'll ever need! Awesome! This is the 2nd time I made it. First time, I followed recipe exactly - delish. This time, I doubled recipe because I had extra bananas. I added cinnamon and nutmeg like suggested, plus walnuts and made sour milk by adding 1TBS of lemon juice to make 1/3 cup of milk. Made half of batter in 8x4 loaf pan, 1/4 into muffin tops and rest regular size muffins to which I added chocolate chips in some and oats in others. Also used white whole wheat flour to give it a little more nutrition. Delicious again!

Really good, really flavorful traditional banana bread with a dense moist crumb.  A good banana bread or muffin is hard to beat right out of the oven and this one fit the bill.

Very, very yummy.  I didn't use sour milk and I used I Can't Believe its not butter instead of regular butter and it was very good.  A little chewy, but very good.

This was a great banana bread recipe! I used 5 bananas because I had 5 very ripe ones and I used 2 teaspoons of vanilla because I love a little extra flavor! Other than that I made it as stated and this is my new favorite banana bread recipe!! Thanks!

This was super easy to make and turned out much, much better than I expected. I accidentally used double the amount of shortening required (I used two sticks of margarine instead of one, because I got confused thinking that 1 cup = 1 pound = 4 sticks), but this happy mistake gave my bread (more like a cake, really, the bananas give it a dense consistency) into a crunchy golden topping. Serendipity is delicious!!!

I love this recipe. I've made banana bread before, but this was, by far, the best banana bread recipe.   I'm a bread baking newb, and I guess I got a bit confused by the sour milk. I used buttermilk, and about three and a half, almost four bananas, leaving in some big chunks.   I made it this morning, it is almost gone, and I will be making more tonight to give to family and friends tomorrow. :)

This is a very good base recipe for banana bread. I made a double batch, but only used 5 bananas (that is all I had).  I added 1 tsp of cinnamon, 1/2 tsp of nutmeg, and 1/2 tsp of cloves.  I poured one loaf and before pouring the other I added 1 and 1/2 cups of coarsly chopped fresh cranberries.  They are both very good.  To sour the milk I used a ratio of 1 tbsp of lemon juice for 1 cup of milk. I think next time i may leave one banana chopped and the rest mashed to leave chunks of fruit in the bread.

Although I love banana bread I've never made it before so I based my choice on recipe on the reviews. 

This was a big hit in my house!! I baked it in little cupcake trays for "easy access" and they were so moist and delicious. 

I modified a little as I did not have all of the ingredients; I used sour cream instead of sour milk and I used crushed cashews as my nuts, but it turned out wonderful!!!

Honestly this is a must-try it I had to put some away just to save some for lunches the next day!!!!

Really, really good!  A bit sweet, though, for my taste so I'd say 4 1/2 stars.  Next time I'll cut back on the sugar a bit.  I did substitute flaxmeal for 1/2 cup of the flour and used egg substitute instead of whole eggs.  A very moist, flavorful bread!  It's been out of the oven maybe 20 minutes and half the loaf is gone...I'm going to go hide a slice so I'll be able to enjoy some tomorrow.  Thank you for sharing your Grandma's recipe!

Yummy.  The only thing I would change is using smaller loaf pans.  I ended up with two flatter loaves, but still good.  Used brown sugar for most, had three bananas, so threw them all in, and increased the vanilla cause I'm not a good measurer (couple of glugs from the bottle).

Yummy! - soft and moist on the inside, crispy crust on the outside. I used 1/2 white sugar and 1/2 brown sugar, used a 9" x 5" glass dish, added about 3/4 cup finely chopped pecans and baked for 75 minutes. All of the batter was used and none spilled over the edges. Perfect!

We really loved this bread! I usually make a recipe as it's written the first time I try it, but I used some reviewer's suggestions and made some of my own modifications on this one. I toasted some walnuts, chopped them up, and added 1/2 cup to the batter. I half brown and half white sugars. I used sour cream instead of sour milk. I added some freshly grated nutmeg and cinnamon and some allspice to the batter. I had too much batter for an 8x4 pan, so I made 3 regular sized muffins with the excess. The loaf took about 75 minutes instead of an hour, but then it was done to perfection. Everyone who has had a slice of this loaf has raved about it. Definitely a keeper!

Good taste.  Makes 2 loaves.  A little more moist than I like.  Also had to cook about 15 min. longer than recipe stated. But overall, very good.

AMAZING! Not even my mother's bread beats this. I used buttermilk in place of sour milk, turned out great and 4 bananas. Also, I took advice of other reviewers and topped with brown sugar and cinnamon-sugar halfway through baking. Makes all the difference! Cooking time was about 1 1/2 hrs. for me. Defintely give this one a try!

I used 4 VERY RIPE (slimy) frozen then unfrozen bananas instead of the 3 it calls for.  I also just used regular milk.  Doubled the vanilla.  Everything else, I followed to a T.  My crust is just right--almost carmelized and the insides are nice and spongy and moist.  Deeeeeeeelightful!

This is an excellent recipe.  Very moist and full of flavor.  I've tried many other recipes, believe me.  My own grandmother had her own recipe for a moist banana nut that we've loved, but were unable to re-create.  This recipe is so similar, I would swear it's my grandmother's.  One variation I made:  I used 3/4c light brown sugar & 3/4c white sugar in my recipe and added 3/4c chopped walnuts and made sure my bananas were very ripe.

I added mini chocolate chips and walnuts to the batter.  The moisture level was perfect and the bread sliced easily.  It made one loaf and six cupcakes (too cakey to call them muffins).  I frosted them with cream cheese icing and they were fantastic.

Loved this recipe! Only changes were that I didn’t have any sour milk so I substituted plain yogurt and added a big dose of chocolate chips. Will definitely make this again.

This is my 2nd comment bc this is the 2nd day in a row that I've made this banana bread. My husband - shoot, my whole family is SO IN LOVE with this recipe and I can't explain how proud I feel everytime they take a bite and say "mmmmm". Today I doubled the batch. The only difference I did was butter the pan and then I sprinkled cinnamon sugar on the bottom and sides prior to putting the batter in. Oh, I also added a touch of cinnamon in the batter. Again, thank you so much for this wonderful recipe!!

Great! I added a light coating of raw sugar on top of the batter before I baked it and it turned out awesome. Not too sweet except the awesome top bite. Yum.

This is a great recipe! It's quick and easy. It yields a delicious loaf, however, I added sour cream in place of the sour milk for a richer flavor.  Also, I added 1 extra banana and walnuts.  Love the recipe.....it is now my new go!!

Great recipe. I tried other recipes before but it turned out dried. With this recipe, it came out great. I made the sour milk at home, instead of going to the store to get some. I just mixed 1 cup of milk with 1 table spoon of lemon juice, while I was mixing the rest of ingredients. It works perfectly.  I reduced the sugar in half but I added an extra banana. I used brown sugar instead of white and I added walnuts for a perfect texture. Now I just need to enjoy it with vanilla ice cream and I’ll be done. ??

I’ve made this recipe a few times now. The first time I followed it exact. It was nice and moist, but really sweet. Our neighbors really enjoyed it, but my sweet husband man and I don’t do well with overly sweet things. The next few times I played with the sugar and found 3/4c just enough with how sweet bananas are, but’s our preference. Added a little bit of cinnamon too just for kicks

I don't use sour milk,  just what I have in fridge. Always turns out perfect! Tonight I added fresh blueberries, even better!!
Been using this recipe for years, everyone always gives compliments. I also use a rectangular pan instead of a bread loaf, I  find it cooks through the center better this way.

This is a great recipe...the changes I made was using regular milk, not sour milk. I also used sugar in the raw instead of white sugar.
I doubled the recipe, it made two very large loafs... I probably could have put it into three pans.
This is always my "go to" recipe for banana bread.

This is moist and delicious. I did make a few changes. I used coconut oil instead of butter, so I needed to double the salt .  Also used equal parts baking powder and baking soda.  And last of all, threw in a small amount of chopped pecans (1/3 cup).

Very good flavor, easy to make. I made batter and added chocolate chips to one, nuts to another and then a plain one. All were very good. Excellent basic recipe for banana bread. I would have  given it a 5 but I think there might be better recipes out there. It calls for butter/margarine and I think I prefer oil based breads due to texture differences. I did add spices that I like as suggested by others.

This is a good recipe however in my opinion should be more detailed instructions. I make all sorts of sweetbreads so I'm used to doing it. But there are few things you need to do. 1st put a teaspoon of vinegar in your milk stir and set aside too sour (at least 10 mins room temperature). 2nd  cream together your butter and sugar then add (well beat) eggs,  mashed over ripe/blackened banana, sour milk set mixture aside. 3rd in a separate Bowl mix all of your dry ingredients once you have done that add dry mixture to wet mixture. ONLY SIR UNTIL MOIST! Oversteering will cause the bread to become dense and dry. I don't ever use a hand mixer when doing my sweet breads because it's easy to over mix. The last thing I did differently was I omitted the vanilla because the star of my banana bread is the banana. :) good recipe though

I make this bread at least once a week. It's the best banana bread we've ever tried. We replace half the sugar with unsweetened applesauce and it's so moist. Love it!

I doubled the recipe and got two 9 inch loafs, 12 mini muffins and 12 big muffins. I used 6oz of whipped cream cheese instead of sour milk. I also always add cinnamon, cloves and a little pumpkin pie seasoning to my banana bread for a little spice flavor. I used the  remaining 2oz of cream cheese and 2 extra bananas mixed with cream cheese frosting to make the muffins more like cupcakes. They were a hit with the kids and my husband took the bread to work with some extra frosting.... they requested more!!! Great recipe!!

Ok, I'm 70, an avid cook & baker, and darn if this isn't simply the very best banana bread on the planet! I added both chopped walnuts and sultana raisins and this was just delicious. My husband volunteered that it was the best banana bread he'd ever had and to make sure I kept the recipe. So this is also going to be printed out for a hard copy.

This is my new favorite banana bread recipe! It's a simple recipe that produces a fluffy, moist, and light loaf. Most banana breads are extremely heavy and hard to choke down for me, so I added a bit more soured milk and baking soda. I also put in a large teaspoon of cinnamon and an extra banana. To stop the bread from getting tiring after a couple bites, I tossed in a cup of raisins. It tastes fine without but raisins really take it to the next level. Beware: do not add nutmeg. I know other reviewers have reccommended it, but the taste of nutmeg will make the banana flavor too weak.

This is an awesome banana bread, tastes great, it's moist, and extremely easy to make. I found this recipe to be an incredible base for other flavor breads, recently I make some pumpkin apple bread. Instead of the bananas I just added diced apples and a couple tablespoons of pumpkin butter. Since I have been adding all kinds of fruits and jams to make all kinds of combinations.

I made this for my seniors card group. They LOVED it. I made a huge loaf and it was all gone within 3 hours among 7 people. I never even got a taste. I did not put nuts in because some of them have difficulty chewing them so I used raisins and they just gobbled it. Definitely a keeper and they want me to make it again.

This is my all-time most used recipe as long as we don't count Mac-n-cheese. I make it with however many bananas we have turning brown. Turns out great every time. It is very tender & lends itself to thick slices. Things that help me:
1. grease & flour the pan
2. beat the sugar, butter, eggs & vanilla til fluffy before adding other ingredients
3. add 1/2 bag of chocolate chips (for obvious reasons)
4. bake til toothpick comes out clean
Enjoy & get your slice before the family snarfs it all down. :)

I've been making this bread for years.  It is good as is but the last two times I made it I cut the sugar to 1 cup. It is still just as good! I actually like it better with less sugar and I have a ferocious sweet tooth! I also bake it in a 9x4.5" pan because it makes a lot of dough.

I just made this recipe when I couldn't find my favorite one from years ago. I used 5 good sized bananas, regular milk, a quarter cup of honey in place of 1/2 c of the sugar. I creamed the butter, sugar & honey together then the eggs. I combined the dry ingredients in a small bowl. I mashed the bananas in a separate bowl, added milk and vanilla to them, then alternately beat in the banana mixture and the dry ingredients into the butter mixture until it was all moist. 
I made 24 muffins, cooked at 350 on the convection bake setting, for only 25 minutes. I filled the muffin cups almost to the top. They came out perfect!

Followed the recipe as written and it does produce a  denser flavorful banana bread. I did have issue with the cooking time. It took about an hour and a quarter to  completely bake through. May split this into two loaf pans next time as it seemed like a lot of batter for one. Love that this is a pantry staples type of recipe that can be made without running to the grocery store.

I made this recipe using regular 2% milk instead of sour milk and added chopped walnuts,  a dash of nutmeg and cinnamon.   I also cut the sugar down to 1 1/4 cups. It was wonderful! And it didn't last long in my house. I'm going to try at using cranberries but no nuts....  Fun to play around with this great recipe!

I made it exactly as written- put walnuts in as I love nuts. It was moist, and delicious. Tastes just as good a few days out. It makes a good size loaf and stores beautifully.

I can't say I'll make this again. It was too moist and too sweet compared to every other Banana bread I have eaten. Still, if you like things very sweet, it is easy and quick, and also makes a good sized loaf.

I added cinnamon, an extra banana, and threw it all into one bowl and beat the heck out of it as instructed with my electric mixer. The butter was just barely softened, so I attacked it with the mixer until I had tiny little butter chunks. 
Couldn't find my loaf pans (Doggone kids,

Delicious. I did use four bananas just because I had one extra and they were not that big to start with. Also had self rising flour on hand which I don't normally but had bought some by accident. I used that. And I drizzled just about a teaspoon of molasses into the bowl before mixing everything up. And raisins. I added raisins. Baked for exactly one hour and it came out great. Will do again.

I followed the recipe did not add or take away. I did double the recipe since I had six very ripe bananas that I used my hand blender to get every lump out. I baked them t 350 for sixty five minutes. I actually should of testedd them at sixty as the sides are crusty. I used convection baking. The bread is moist and sweet and the best banana bread I ever made. Next time I will use one half cup less sugar. I did add chopped pecans. You gotta make this bread! Easy and fast to make ...one bowl baking!

Simple to make and the kids, family, friends and co-workers all love it. This is one of those that I am asked to bring with me often. I do make this as a desert bread and rather than flouring the pan, I *lightly* sugar my greased pan.  
I did find that if I put all the batter into one pan, the bread is very heavy and takes longer to cook so I typically split it up between 2 smaller loaf pans.

Left all of the butter out by accident, also substituted plain yogurt instead of sour milk. I made banana muffins with them and they were great! Moist but not crumbly, they rose well and got rave reviews from all my friends, one of whom is a chef.

I used 4 bananas and added chocolate chips. I baked in muffin pan and it turned out awesome. Also no sour milk on hand so I put a couple drops of lemon juice in the milk and let sit for a few,minutes. Kids and hubby loved then. Turned out moist and delicious.

I love this recipe. I also add chocolate chips , a dash of cinnamon or nutmeg and it gives it a good flavor.  The chocolate chips help keep the bread moist. I also use mini loaf pans. I butter them and then add sugar coating. Comes out crispy sweet on the edges.

I think this is a terrific basic banana bread recipe. I made a couple of modifications based on necessity. I realized while making this that I was all out of milk. I put in 1/3 cup of eggnog instead and a handful of chocolate chips. Because of this added sweetness, I cut the amount of sugar in half. The bread came out beautifully, with a thick and chewy crust and a moist center. I have a fast oven so I timed it for 50 minutes. However, it needed the whole hour before the knife came out clean. 
Next time I will make sure I have all my ducks in a row and try it without the modifications. I expect similar and good tasting results.

I used Pyrex dish and it turned out really moist.  I used Almond extract instead of vanilla (by accident) and it added that nutty taste which was good since I didn't have any walnuts.  I used a teaspoon of cinnamon too.  I would highly recommend this recipe.

I love this banana bread.  However, I did make one change.  I put 1/3 c. sour cream instead of sour milk.  And I added walnuts to mine.  It is a big hit with my fiance'.  I also had to cook it for about 20-25 minutes longer than stated.  Yummy!!!!!

This recipe produced a moist and flavorful bread! I cant say anything bad about this recipe! I did make muffins instead of a loaf. It does make a dense banana bread but dense in a good way! Its a keeper!

This is the best recipe I have found for Banana Bread.  I have had nothing but compliments on it - even from my Mom, whom I still call for cooking advice.  I usually double the recipe and it comes out great every time.  I usually get 3 loaves out of this recipe though, after I double it - more for everyone!

I adjusted this recipe a bit. Used Splenda Sugar instead of reg. sugar. and used applesauce instead of butter. I also added cinnamon, vanilla, & walnuts. 
I also made into muffins instead of loaf, as they are more convenient to take for lunches here. I baked same temp but only about 20-22 min. & made 2 doz. Wonderful flavor, lil heavy, but everyone loves them !! Thanx for sharing. This is an easy recipe, and seems very easy to adjust, it's a great recipe that I can't wait to try again and again. Enjoy.

Made this for my husband and he loved it. Used a little less sugar and baking powder instead of soda. Had to add 30 minutes to baking time and came out wonderful and moist.

Delicious, moist good ol fashioned banana bread.  Added Chocolate chips for the picky ones, and it is now a family favorite.  Will try with walnuts next time.

Thank you!

I made this recipe and it was too sweet. I am making the bread again and I have reduced the sugar to 3/4 cup. I had a request to add chocolate chips so I added 1 cup to the batter. Instead of a regular loaf I made 3 little loafs (5.75 x 3) to give to friends. Cooking time is 50 mins or a dry toothpick when inserted in center of loaf.

Hands down the best banana bread I've ever had.  I always add an extra banana because I love that real banana-y taste.  I've used buttermilk and made my own sour milk.  Both taste equally as good.  It makes too much for one loaf pan so I grease my bundt pan and throw it in there.  50 minutes in the oven is perfection!

I made this a few day ago and it was so good not spreading the word would just be wrong!  I will never use another recipe for banana bread again. Another reviewer stated that after bread cooled she sliced it down then put each slice in a baggie the all of the bagged slices into a freezer bag, well that was genius! Next time will double recipe for two loaves so we'll have one or now and one for later. Totally recommend this recipe.  Oh, the only thing I changed was that I used heavy cream instead of sour milk (cause i didnt have milk)and subbed brown sugar for 1/2 of sugar.

It was a good way to use up overripe bananas and sour milk. However, I prefer my banana bread more dense and less sweet. I really love sweet, so it is really unusual for me to say that.

This was great! I followed the recipe exactly. However, I like using muffin/cupcake pans so I kept the temp and placed a 1/4 cup of batter in each muffin section. They were done in 25 minutes instead. Eat them about 10 minutes after they come out of the oven. Still a little warm and amazing! Can't wait to make again.

Couldn't find recipe usually use so went looking for similar and settled on this because of the addition of the sour milk. Made the minor adjustment of using 1/2 butter and 1/2 veg. oil ( or 1/4 c ea.) and used sour cream instead of sour milk, since didn't have the latter. Always add nuts and blueberries cause hubby is disappointed without them.  It was superb.  Have a new recipe and sticking to it.

I make this all of the time! Huge hit! I add cinnamon and remove from oven about 5 to 10 min sooner, cover with foil to cool overnight, this makes it super moist!! Also add 2 more bananas than the recipe calls for and it gives it great flavor!  Favorite recipe by far! Have used for years and will pass it down.

I wanted to make two loaves at a time. So I doubled everything in the recipe, except the bananas and sugar. I only used 4 bananas total, and used a half cup less sugar. The bread turned out quite yummy! I took most of one loaf to work and it was quickly gobbled up. Everyone loved it. This was my first attempt at making banana bread and I was very happy with the results:)

It was sooooo easy to make and absolutely delicious. I recommend this and add Pecans even better! Made 1 1/2 loaves. I used my glass loaf pan and a smaller tin loaf pan. Made more than the regular glass can hold. I did cut the sugar down a bit, I only cut it by 1/4 c. but that helped.

Great recipe! I followed exactly except for one change: I used 1 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown. I also needed an extra 5 minutes to bake, that's it. This banana bread was super moist and delicious. Tastes amazing the next day too!

Easy to make. I didn't have 3 black bananas so I substituted the the third for a pear which I couldn't taste. I also subbed the sour milk for nonfat milk and vinegar. It was good!

Banana bread is my thing, and Ive been making it  for years, but decided to try this recipe. Even my picky chef husband loved it! I will be using this recipe from now on. THANKS! 
I experimented with throwing in a little wheat flour and ground flax seed. I cut back on the white sugar (by 1/2 cup), and opted for a little agave necter (2 tbsp) & two stevia packages. Delicious!

We love this recipe. I have made it several times. I did use cream that I added lemon juice to for the sour milk this last time. this gave a bit richer flavor.

It turned out great, used sour cream instead of sour milk, added walnuts. Only had 2 bananas so I used half a cup of crushed pinapple instead. I used only 1 cup of sugar also.(Don't like all that sugar)Made 12 muffins and a loaf of bread Perfectly moist.

This bread was perfect. I did add chopped walnuts to it but I have a feeling it would have been fantastic without them. Even my extremely hard to please family member liked it! Neither too dry nor too moist, I toasted mine in my little toaster oven and topped it with a tablespoon of Nutella for a quick and tasty breakfast treat. YUM!!!! Thank you for this recipe.

Delicious!  I added a teaspoon of cinnamon and half teaspoon of ginger and nutmeg, and omitted the vanilla.  Great, dense texture.

I've made quite a few banana bread recipes, and this one was excellent.  Loved the texture--springy, not too dense or heavy. I doubled the recipe since I had so many bananas--came out great. I added chocolate chips and chopped nuts.  Even tho I decreased sugar (1 cup instead of 1 1/2 cups), it was still too sweet--probably due to the addition of chocolate chips. I will decrease further next time.
My changes--substituted half the butter with applesauce to decrease fat (and it still tasted moist). Used some whole wheat flour in place of the white flour (1 cup WW and 3 cups white for a double batch). For double batch, 1 cup white sugar & 1 cup brown sugar. Used egg beaters instead of eggs. Added 1/4 cup ground flaxseed. Added chopped nuts and chocolate chips.
The only change I'd make is to decrease the sugar even more than I did...a little too sweet for my taste.

I gave this one 5 stars because my husband loved it!! But i didnt care for it. I used buttermilk instead of sour milk. I had to cook it longer about 15 minutes longer. I think next time i will try adding some kind of nuts.

Took this to work and got many compliments even from people who don't like banana bread.  I used one cup mashed banana.  I would advise creaming the sugar and butter first as the butter came out clumpy (however it still did well).  Best recipe out.  Making it again tonight and plan on putting almond flakes over the top.

Mmmm Yummy. I added cinnamon and extra bananas. I used 5 medium sized ripened bananas. I used 2 smaller loaf pans, and this turned out perfect! Great texture, and it really tasted like my Nana made it!

Yum, YUM, Yum - an awesome recipe!  And it's a compliment that I made it a second time a day apart on Christmas Day. It bakes up beautifully in mini-trays to take as gifts.  Just a note that it was made with buttermilk as a substitute for the sour milk and it comes out moist. I'll definitely be making this regularly.

I also added cinnamon and nutmeg to it ... if you tried crushed black walnuts instead or english walnuts it's even better.I then save a little to sprinkle over the top before baking. It's awesome.

Pretty good. I like my naner bread to have a different consistency (like coffee cake) and this one is a little spongey. But the taste is good. I used 1/2 cup of brown sugar instead of all white, and didn't have any sour milk so just used 1%.

Made two thinner loaves out of this recipe and my and my partner just finished off half of one in a sitting. Added toasted pecans and raisin, curdled soymilk instead of sourmilk... The BEST banana bread either of us have had. Thank you for you grandmother's recipes.

This was a pretty good banana bread recipe. I did add one extra banana I had to use up (4 total). Nice mild banana flavor, moist, not crumbly, tastes great warmed up with some butter.

This is an excellent recipe. The bread came out 'very' moist. I added cinna- mon, nutmeg, sour cream (I didn't have sour milk), & walnuts as suggested. I also used 3/4 C. brown suger & 3/4 C. white sugar.  I used 2 loaf pans since it seemed like there was too much batter for 1 & both loaf's were gone by the next day. I will definetly make again. Thanks Jeannie, for sharing.  Everyone loved it.

I really liked this recipe..it was easy and quick to do...Next time I will add a little less baking soda as I could taste a hint of it in the bread..my family thought it was perfect tho..
