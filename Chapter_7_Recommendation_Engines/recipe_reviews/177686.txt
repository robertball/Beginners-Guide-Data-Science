This recipe is quick, easy and has good flavor.  Although, instead of cooking in oil on a skillet, I breaded the chicken with Italian bread crumbs and baked it.  I prefer the flavor and texture of baked chicken.

I've now made this recipe twice: once as written and once seasoning the chicken before browning.  Seasoning the chicken first makes ALL the difference in this recipe!  I coated the breasts in simple salt and pepper, and that simple change changed the flavor from a 3 to a solid 4.5/5!  In lieu of the "Prego Traditional Italian Sauce" I use whatever I have on hand: Ragu's "Robusto Roasted Garlic" was an excellent choice, I must say.  Also, if you have a clove of garlic or garlic-infused olive oil (I used a little last time), that can add a good amount of flavor, too.

This is a great recipe-very simple without a lot of ingredients. Something "special" you can make even for an everynight dinner.

This is super easy and good! This will be my go-to recipe when I don't have much in the kitchen. I do recommend adding some garlic, Italian seasoning and to season the chicken while browning. I served this with some bow tie pasta and green beans.

Ok, I don't give out many 5's.  I usually base it on how many people in the house eat it, and everyone ate this dish.  My 5 year old grandson enjoyed it and so did my daughter, my picky 16 year old son ate it along with his girlfriend, and of course my husband and I enjoyed it as we do most things.  This was quick and easy.  I did bake it as my stove top isnt installed yet but it was still very good.   With the rest of the sauce in the jar, I made penne pasta so it worked out perfectly.

Loved this recipe! I seasoned the chicken with salt, pepper and a bit of garlic powder and it was delicious! Served over linguine with a side salad. Perfection!

This is an excellent recipe.  The only thing I did differently from the recipe was to bread the chicken first.  Excellent flavor, my husband raved all the way through dinner.  I served with simplified Pasta Alfredo: sauted garlic in a bit of butter, added some cream, black pepper, Parmesan cheese; heated then added pasta.  Stirred until heated throughout.  Excellent meal. I'll be making this recipe again.

This was very good + very easy to make! I added a bit more sauce then what was required, to go alone with the noodles I made as a side. I couldn't find Italian Prego sauce, so I used regular spaghetti sauce from my fridge + added an assortment of spices, and it tasted great! The sauce really retained the taste of the chicken well and was delicious on top of noodles. I'm always kind of afraid to make chicken dishes, but this one I will definitely try again in the future!

Ok this is quick and my children love it. I dont use Prego and I do add a little crushed garlic to the pan when Im browning the chicken breast. But my family is very Happy when I make it. Add Garlic bread and a Salad its PERFECT. Thanks for sharing.

Good for a quick and easy meal.  I actually baked my chicken breasts and cut them up instead of pan frying them, which was good because it added last fat.

Pretty good. Did bread chicken first. Have also added small can of mushrooms, frozen chopped onions, roasted red peppers and a little red wine to sauce. Have used same sauce but with ground beef or veal patties. For meat patties mix with garlic and Italian    seasonings. And don't forget the cheese in patty and  on top.

Very good and easy recipe to create. Next time, I might add more sauce and simmer longer cause it seemed like it burnt up all the sauce.

I made this dish last night.  I followed the recommendations of so many others and seasoned my chicken first.  I used 2 packs of Tyson "Trimmed & Ready" chicken breast, seasoned the breasts with heaping tablespoon of minced garlic, 2 Sazon packets, S&P, and ShopRite's Italian seasoned bread crumbs with parmesan cheese.  I cooked each side for 5 minutes, used Ragu's Traditional tomato sauce (the large plastic bottle), then followed the remainder of directions as written.  I served it on top of Barilla Plus Thin Angel Hair Pasta.  It was DELICIOUS.  According to my 14-year old son, it was "AWESOME!"  I will definitely be making this again.  **Tastes even better as a lunch leftover!

My husband made this for dinner and it turned out very good. The adults liked it but for some reason 2 of my children did not want to eat it. Then again I do have extremely picky children. I would make this again.

This was good and easy. Def add some spices to your chicken before browning. I also added garlic to the sauce. Served it over pasta. Nice meal for a quick week night dinner.

We love this but we pound the chicken thin and make it with Ragu Parmesan and Romano sauce- much more flavorful and we use fresh mozzarella and parmesan cheese-- easy and delicious!!

Surprisingly good.  I didn't miss the breading on the chicken, and I did sop up the browning oil in the frypan with a paper towel before adding the spaghetti sauce.

It was good and my kids loved it! However, I thought it was okay. I felt like it needed more flavor. I MADE IT with Ragu tomato basil sauce, but didn't add anything else. Next time I will make it with garlic cloves. I did serve noodles WITH it.

My family enjoyed this recipe and it was a nice change from plain old spaghetti with meat sauce. I did season the chicken before browning and added some extra garlic. I served it on spaghetti squash and it was delicious. Will make it again.

I cut the chicken breasts into medallions and used Chef John’s brined chicken breasts technique before following this recipe's instructions.  This came out perfect.  It was fast and easy and delicious.

This is great when you are watching what you eat since you skip the breading calories. But I really missed the crunch. Otherwise it was very flavorful, and you could experiment with different sauces.

I marinated the chicken in a salt-pepper-garlic-olive oil mix before cooking. Delicious.

I added kosher salt and garlic pepper (McCormicks) prior to frying them.  Absolutely delicious, restaurant quality meal and will make again and again.
