Very good, everyone loved it!  I would remind other cooks to make sure to use room temperature sour cream or it will curdle and use a whisk to completely blend the sour cream in.

This is just delicious!  Very fresh tasting.  My kids loved it.  We couldn't find black cherry jello so we used cherry and it was so good!  This is a keeper for sure.

This is a great recipe, and popular at a major restaurant chain. The key is let the jello thicken but not set completely, and then you gently stir the sour cream, so it flows like ribbons through the sea of jello. You may want to do the jello the quick set way. Also good with pecans instead of walnuts.

I made it for Thanksgiving and it was voted the best cranbery jello salad I have ever made (I try a new one every year).  Kids don't seem to like the nuts but all adults loved it!

Very easy to prepare and very good.  I used a jello mold and it looked beautiful.  I used cherry jello because I couldn't find black cherry.  I will make this jello every Thanksgiving!

This was a very easy and good recipe. I turn the mold out on a bed of lettuce which gave a very nice presentation at Thanksgiving.

It was delicious.  I did not make it with the nuts.  I added some purple grapes... and I thought that was good.

This was delicious.  I wanted to use cranberry jello but couldn't find any.  So I used raspberry jello and instead of hot water, I used light cranberry juice.  I didn't add the nuts.  Other than that, I did everything the same.  Turned out GREAT.  Yummy.  Will make again.

This was a nice recipes; however, it really does does like black cherry yogurt, so I'm not sure it's worth it.  It's definitely not an elegant dish for your holiday menu, but is an inexpensive, easy one that most people will enjoy (but, not love).

This did not turn out for me.  I couldn't get the sour cream to mix into the jello mixture completely.  The sour cream was slightly cooler than room temperature, maybe that was the problem.  There were small white solid bits throught the jello.  It didn't look appetizing at all.  I had made this to take to a potluck dinner, and I didn't take it, because it looked awful.  I tasted it later thinking that it probably tasted fine, and that the problem was just the looks.  The taste wasn't great either.  I normally like cranberries, but I just didn't like the texture of the cranberry sauce in the jello. I won't be making this again.

This has been a Thanksgiving tradition in my family since before I was born.  We have always lovingly called it "the pink stuff".  Not for everyone I suppose, but always been my favorite day after breakfast.

I used cream cheese instead of sour cream. I halfed it and topped it with cool whip.  Loved it.

Stir in the  cold sour cream and walnuts when the gelatin has almost set, return it to the fridge and let it set up. This recipe is wonderful, has been in our family for decades.  Even people who do NOT like cranberries take seconds! Any red gelatin works. I think it would be good with grape, too.
