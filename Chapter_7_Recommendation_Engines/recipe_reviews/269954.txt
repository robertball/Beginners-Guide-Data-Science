I used veggie broth instead of water and added double veggies. Very filling and delicious!

I made this exactly as directed- only thing I would do differently is perhaps use vegetable broth instead of just water, up the garlic and use an immersion blender to purée some of the soup before adding the mushrooms. I found it a bit thin otherwise.  Excellent base for future soup days, loved the sautéed mushrooms and the lentils add heartiness. Definitely will make again!
