So when I first showed this recipe to my BF he said "doesn't jump out at me."  I made it anyway and after his first bite he said "We're keeping this right?!"  to which  I could only nod in agreement since my mouth too full to speak.     I only made two changes.  I used 1/2 lb of fresh chicken sweet Italian sausage and 1/2 lb of ground turkey for the meat and layers of spaghetti squash instead of the pasta sheets.  I didn't think the cheddar would work, but that little bit of sharpness really adds something unexpected.

The blue and cheddar cheeses added something unexpected to this non-traditional lasagna and really perked it up.  The only change I did was substitute ricotta for the cottage cheese.
