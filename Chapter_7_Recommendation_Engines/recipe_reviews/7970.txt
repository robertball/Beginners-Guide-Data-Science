This was the best cheesecake I have ever had. It was easy to make, had easy ingredients, and came out wonderful. It was light, creamy, and just sweet enough. Everyone loved it and I plan to make 2 for Christmas! Try this cake...you will not be sorry.

Frankly, this cheesecake is exquisite!  I'm one of those cheesecake buffs, who will bake and bake until I find the one that suits my palate, and this recipe steals the show.  Birdlady,(previous comment), try the recipe again, you'll surprise yourself.  I tip my hat off to you Cathy, well done!

Aloha!

Tasted wonderful, but for some reason, mine didn't rise.  It was only a little over an inch tall, but it was tasty.

This recipe was the best cheesecake I've ever made!  I dressed it up by adding shaved chocolate and sliced strawberries along the outer edge.  I'm throwing my old cheesecake recipe out!!

This might be wonderful if you want a cakey cheese cake.  It was too heavy for me and didn't have enough flavor.  I believe that the taste did not warrant the expense of all the ingredients.

I think the cheesecake was awesome, but I think it had just a little too much lemon taste to it.  But overall, it was pretty good.

This was the first time I made any cake in a springform pan. This cheesecake had a nice smooth flavor but it was not the best I have ever had. I did love the shortdough crust better than the graham crust though. I shared it with a friend he said "The crust was off the hook! but the cheesecake was just alright"

Great idea with the crust bottom.  My family really enjoyed this one.  The cheese cake was nice and creamy.

It truly is "the best" I've ever made.  I made one for Easter dinner this year and everyone raved about it.  They enjoyed the shortbread crust and the rich flavor of the cheesecake.

I made this recipe for Thanksgiving 
I did not care for it. I feel after reading the reviews and how mine came out I either did something wrong. I followed the recipe to a T
so I don't know what I could of done wrong.

I made this cheesecake for Thanksgiving.  I always make a shortbread crust, as I prefer it to a graham crust.  I would give this five stars if it had more filling.  Next time I will double the filling so I have a higher cheesecake.  Mine was only about an inch thick in a 10 inch pan.  That being said, it was lucious.  Not too sweet, and with the dense cheesecake texture that I enjoy.  I do not like the cheesecake style that uses sour cream.  It was very lemony, but fresh and nice, not like an artificial extract flavor.  I didn't measure the lemon zest, I just used the zest from one whole lemon, so it could have been more than a teaspoon.  My dad especially enjoyed it, as he prefers less sweet desserts.  It reminded him of a German style cheesecake.  And I also liked the baking method, although I couldn't resist adding a pan of water to the oven.  This is the first cheesecake I've ever made that hasn't cracked on top.  It was really beautiful.  Double the filling, and it gets five starts!

perhaps I didn't do it right, but nothing about this cake was good (except the crust, which was yummy).

the cake itself was VERY lemony, and the texture was just not right.

I kept checking to make sure I was doing everything correctly and it LOOKED okay, but I was not pleased with the taste.(my husband liked it though).

As close as I've found to a New York style cheesecake.  Excellent texture and flavor.  Not overly sweet like some less authentic cheesecakes.

I have made this cheesecake several times and it is amazing. However, I do agree with doubling the filling part. I just made it again after a few years and forgot to double it so only have a 1.5 inch high cake, however it still tastes great. I swirl in dulce de leche with a skewer about half way through the cooking process & it is SO good.

I found this recipe several years ago and have made it many times. I have searched since childhood to find a cheesecake recipe that remotely resembled the one my grandma used to make and this one is nearly dead on. I absolutely love it.
