I had a girlie party a few weeks ago and this Sangria was a HUGE HIT!! I had to make enough for 48 servings...I used 1-4L bottle of Blush, 1-1/2 gal of pineapple/orange juice, 1-750ml bottle of MALIBU MANGO, 2 cups of sugar and 2-2L bottles of diet 7-up. I used orange slices, apples, black berries, strawberries and 2-20oz. cans of pineapple chunks! Even for my hardcore drinkers, this one was strong and SUPER YUMMY!!

Call me a lightweight, but this stuff was STRONG. I only used a cup of rum and was FEELING NO PAIN after a tall cool glass of it at a summer cookout. Great easy recipe, but I'll probably cut back on the rum next time so I can taste the red wine.

OK, this is one STRONG drink.  We had to mix it with gingerale before we could drink it - great flavor, but watch out!!!

Excellent!  I don't particularly like the rum taste, so I gave it a four star.  Also, I used rasberries instead of cherries, because cherries give you gas.  Be cautious, I was borderline drunk after a big goblet of it.

Superbly Yummy!  I (of course) made some alterations to the recipe, following others advice and what intuitively seemed right.  I used half watermelon rum (1 cup in each step), cut the sugar in half (though I think that it could have gone without having used the melon rum!), used frozen strawberries (not the best, fresh would have been better, for sure!), fresh apricots, peaches and pluots and the canned pineapple.  I used Orange Strawberry Mango juice (see? sugar would have worked!).  I used a magnum of Crane Lake cabernet sauvignon ($4!) and next time may try a white!  The gingerale was a MUST!!!  Too strong w/out...yummy, but dangerous!!  

Cheers!

This was excellent, a real hit at the party.  We just put the fruit in with the wine and juice instead of soaking them in the rum etc., but if you want more of a kick, go ahead and soak them.

This was great.  Very strong, so I doubled the wine and made a larger batch.

This was fabulous!  Not one drop was left half way through our party.  I added pears and orange slices.  Other then that, followed the recipe to marinate the fruit (I probably let it marinate about 12 hours) and it was delicious and POTENT!  Definitely 5 stars.

Strong? Yes...i added a dash of Sprite left over from the non-alchoholic Sangria I was serving. This was a hit! I modified it a bit and used kiwis and apples and the Rum (top shelf makes all the difference). I served this at my b-day party and I'm still getting requests for the recipe! Thank you!!!!

Very good recipe, but I only added 1 c. rum, and used fresh, diced peaches and blueberries for the fruit. Perfect!

I made this three weekends in a row and plan on making it next weekend for a bbq.  I love it and everyone I share it with loves it as well.  The only thing I do differently is add more fruit, but I think the recipe is fine the way it is.

We really liked this.  I added fresh pineapple, pears and kiwi to the strawberries.  We used non-alcoholic red wine as I had conscientious objectors at my party. For the rum I substituted as follows for each two cups of rum: 2 cups fresh apple juice, 2 T rum extract, 2 T almond extract, 1/4 cup dark molasses.  We loved this sangria, and everyone was trying to get me to let them take some home.  Fat chance, it is in my fridge.

I loved this recipe, but my friend got hammered after we drank it! So I guess it is pretty strong. I just used orange/lemon/lime slices....

Yummy!  I have tried making Sangria in the past and have failed miserably.  It is strong so be careful.

Made this for a family barbecue and it was my first effort at sangria.  Followed others suggestions and cut the amount of rum in half. It still had plenty of kick.  I also halved the sugar. It went over great with those who tried it though not everyone in my family drinks alcoholic beverages. I would definitely make it again.  Gingerale is a nice addition and sweetens it a little as well a dilutes it.

This was really very good.  I only let the fruit soak for about 6 hours or so and it was plenty strong.  We ended up topping each glass off with a little ginger ale which was delicious!  Thanks for the easy and yummy drink!

fabulous recipe!!! i omitted the cherries and also added the traditional orange/lemon/lime slices, and it was delicious! did everything else as the recipe stated and it turned out perfect. the best part is eating the fruit after the sangria is gone. ;)

This was fantastic!  I used half of the rum.  That was the ONLY difference.  It certainly gave us a buzz with half of the rum (can't imagine what it would have been like over here if we had it all!).  Had a Christmas family get-together and my biggest critic had several glasses of it!  :)  Would certainly make again!

This is great! I made as is the first time and it was really strong. Next time I halved the rum and it was still strong so I mixed with ginger ale. I've used red and white wine with great success.

We really enjoyed this sangria, however I did alter the recipe.  I did not have rum (where did that go?) so rum was totally excluded and therefore soaking the fruit was excluded, as well.  That being said, we felt this was a 5 star sangria recipe, as made.  Very, very smooth and refreshing!  Thanks for sharing this recipe, JILLJAMESON!
