I made this for the holidays using butterscotch chips.  I think I would have probably preferred the peanut butter chips but it was still really good.  Everyone that tried it thought it was really good and they were surprised by the "hidden" flavor.

I have made this fudge every year at christmas since I was a little girl. In my family it is known as Grandaddy's Fudge, as it was my grandfathers favorite christmas treat. Now, my roommate insists that I make her a double batch to take home to her family every christmas. 
It is the easiest fudge that anyone can make. I don't add the vanilla, and I usually add chopped nuts to it. I always keep it refridgerated to keep it firm.

It was okay. Nice smooth texture but I will add more chocolate chips next time. I found the butterscotch flavor was a little to over powering for my taste.

Very good, although I like my fudge a little firmer than this recipe produced.

this is by far one of the best fudge recipes i've used for my holiday trays.  i didn't expect to like it myself, since in general i'm not that fond of butterscotch, but i really loved this stuff... unfortunately for my thighs.

First I must say that I don't eat sweets, but my hubby does.  He said that he could not taste the butterscotch chips in this.  He also said that it was still pretty good.  I rated it a 4 because I had this in the microwave for 6 minutes and it still wasn't melted.  I was afraid that some of the chocolate may burn so I heated some water in a pot and put the bowl over the water until all was melted.  So what should have taken about 5 minutes finished up taking me about 30 minutes.  Thanks for posting the recipe.

Delicious.  Only change is I made it on the stove over a very low flame, removing from the heat just before the chips finished melting (they finish while you stir it).  I also used a splash of almond extract instead of the vanilla.  HUGE hit in our house.

Delicious, quick and clean-up is super easy. I made both peanut butter and butterscotch. Nice changes from the same-old, same-old fudge. You can't go wrong with this recipe.

I made this using the butterscotch chips and it turned out very yummy. It's a nice change from regular chocolate fudge. Very quick and easy to make, as well.

I forgot the vanilla and this turned out great, I really like it. I'd made a chocolate/butterscotch fudge recipe last month and I like the teste of this one better.
