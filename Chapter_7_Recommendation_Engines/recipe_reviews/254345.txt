A good addition to my Vegetarian repertoire. Looks so beautiful. Tasted delicious too.   I definitely will be making it again.

This was very good.  My husband didn't miss the meat, which is unusual for him.

Delicious, simple. I tweaked my recipe quite a bit to match family tastes for meat sauce, and we had GF lasagna for days!
