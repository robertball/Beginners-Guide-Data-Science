We usually make this on a large flatbread instead of a pizza crust.  It makes a great neopolitan like pizza that way.  Nice and crispy!  We sometimes add pesto too!  We do everything by sight.  Meaning we add as much cheese or tomatoes as we want so that it is never too cheesy or has too many tomatoes.  The bacon is great with all the flavors.

I definitely liked the ingredients (though I couldn't find chevre and made the poor choice of substituting feta). However, because the recipe doesn't say what size pizza crust to use, I ended up with too much topping on too small a crust, making my finished product WAY too thick with cheese and just a little overwhelming. I still can't say what size crust is meant to be used, but my advice is to get a really BIG one.

This is a terrific pizza.  The combination of ingredients is both savory and spicy, and the chevre cheese on top is to die for!  Thanks for the recipe.

Pretty dang awesome. Taste is certainly 5 stars, but the proportions are way off, so thats why I'm giving it the 4 star rating. I'll definitely be making this again.

Wow!  I've made this about 5 times now and every time, it is great!  I do made a couple minor adjustments...I use about 6 oz of a block of mozzarella cheese and shred it myself (MUCH better than bagged pre-shredded cheese, totally worth the extra time/effort, trust me) and a small log of goat cheese (4 oz), and this is PLENTY of cheese for us.  I don't measure the red pepper flakes, just sprinkle all around.  GREAT combination of flavors!!  YUM!!!

I made this for myself and my husband who is a chef, and we loved it so much we made it again the next night.  Love love love this! One thing to note is one bunch of asparagus lasted us through two pizzas, so don't chop it all at once, try half and see if you need more.

LOVE. anything. with. chevre! Did pretty much everything as is. My SO hates tomatoes so I only put them on half and cut the amount of chevre in half. Mixed some parmasan in with the mozzarella and chopped up a jalepeno* with the asparagus for more of a kick. I was hesitant about not using sauce - but I listened to a few of the other posts - and loved it without. Thank you! (*highly recommended)

not as good as some other pizzas but probably pretty healthy compared to some others. cut back on the bacon (used 2-3 slices chopped), cut back on goat cheese - 11 oz was too much! lightly sprinkled with goat cheese. bf gave it a 3 but i'd give it a 3.5 to 4

Love this pizza!!  I make it quite often since it tastes so great and it is quick and easy.  It's great for those nights that you need a quick meal but don't want fast food.

Very tasty pizza! I used a very very small amount of sauce and thought it tasted good that way.  I also reduced the amount of cheese.  This pizza is also great on the grill!

This was amazing!! Like one of the other reviews said, fight the temptation to add sauce. It really does not need any. I used the Valentino's pizza crust recipe from this website. I used 8 pieces of bacon, only 1/2 cup of goat cheese,and sprinkled 1 tbsp of basil on top of everything before going into the oven.

Husband wasn't interested in asparagus on pizza, so I just put it on my half. Yeah... it wasn't that great. BUT substitute the asparagus with some fresh basil, and I think you'd have a really really good pizza. I'm gonna try it next week.

Delicious! I only used 4 oz goat cheese, since I'm not a huge fan. It was perfect!

My husband loved this, but I guess i'm not a fan of goat cheese. It kinda threw me off. I also used canned asparagus b/c fresh was SO expensive...it wasn't the best idea. Over all, it was pretty expensive to make (asparagus, goat cheese, crust, etc.)

I made this pizza with a homemade pizza crust (a recipe from this site) and it turned out really good.  At first, I was worried because there was no sauce in the recipe, but the pizza actually came out tasty and not dry at all.  I used feta cheese in place of the goat cheese, and also used smoked bacon, which imparted an interesting flavor.  I served the pizza for dinner guests and they said it was "colorful and gourmet."

This was very good.  I cooked this on the bottom rack of the over so that the crust cooked to my liking withouth burning the cheesey top and I made half of the pizza without the goat cheese for those who really don't like it and so that the kids would eat it.  The kids really enjoyed it!  Can't wait to make this as a "nosh" for the next gathering I have.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was the best thing i made in a long time! You wouldn't think it would really be that great but IT IS! Just make it. and DO NOT substitute anything for the goat cheese. That is what made it so great. The only thing I changed was i added a little chopped onion but it didn't really need it.

This was delicious! I think a bigger crust would've been better because some of my toppings went to waste because they wouldnt all fit.

Excellent pizza and am looking forward to trying it in the spring on the grill when our asparagus starts growing.  Only addition I made was to cook some onions with the bacon.

I mixed up the recipe a little bit! First of all, I didn't have goat cheese, so I used mozzarrella cheese. ALso I added a bit more asparugus and much more bacon. I also used some alfredo sauce on the dough before I piled on the bacon and asparugus for extra zing! It came out DELICIOUS! Maybe next time I'll try the original recipe, but for now, I'm very satisfied with my little experiment!

I like that this pizza didn't have sauce.  I think we tend to over sauce a lot of tasty things.  I also tried it again, but only had Gorgonzola cheese, it was very good also...

Very good but make sure you don't overcook the bacon.  I use whatever cheese I have in the fridge.

Cheese Lovers- this is your pizza!  We shredded our fresh mozzerella and used Valentino's pizza crust from All Recipes which made this a 5 star recipe.  We baked the pizza on an airbake pan for about 30 minutes- the crust was slightly dark by the time the center baked, but it was still soft.  The longer baking time also helped bake out alot of the juices from the fresh cheese, making it less greasy.

Very good!! I did use 2 pkgs of pizza crust mix. I also substituted feta cheese for the goat cheese. The feta cheese that I bought was flavored with tomato and basil. I also used an Italian Cheese mixture instead of just the Mozzeralla. Only thing I would change is the amount of bacon; could have used more. Otherwise a very good recipe! I will make this again.
