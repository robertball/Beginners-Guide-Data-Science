I will never buy the packaged stuff again.  My niece came over and wanted some "hot chocolate" and I thought I would try this out.  The only thing I did differently was to use Ghiradelli cocoa powder instead.  It's my favorite kind.  Thanks for the post....definately a great way to keep warm in the cold wintery months.

It's amazing how people come to rely on packet stuff and forget what real hot cocoa tastes like.  Last time I made this for a gathering, people were saying, "What did you put in THIS?"  These proportions are just right for us:  not too sweet.  A good basic recipe, and you can ring the changes with marshmallows, or whipped cream, or a candy cane or cinnamon bark swizzle stick.

This cocoa was just OK until I added a shot of Bailey's Irish Cream.  I would give it 5 stars if Bailey's was in the original recipe!

I thought that this recipe was wonderful. It may be a little on the sweet side, but that's the way I like it! If you follow the recipe and stir and boil the syrup mixture for two minutes, you won't have anything in the bottom of your cup when finished.

My family did not like this at all. It tasted gritty and a little bitter. The store bought packages are much more tasty and a lot easier.

Delicious!  I've been making this quite a bit lately and it's the perfect hot chocolate recipe.  I sometimes add a dash of cinnamon for a different twist.  The measurments are right on.  Thanks Hershey's.

A little sweet for my taste, so I cut the sugar by about 3t,when I make this, otherwise, very good.Try adding some coffee extract to it! Yummy.

This isnt really a kid friendly thing (stove top recipe)... I dont know what happened for me but this was way too sweet and much too rich. I think it was just my taste, seeing that others liked this recipe. My cousin thought it was too sweet too. It may not be hard to make but instant hot cocoa is much easier...

The children really look forward to it when I tell them I'm going to make them a pot of this hot chocolate. Sometimes I make it for an after-school treat, or while they're relaxing to watch a movie. Or sometimes just to warm them up on a cold day. Topped with miniature marshmallows or marshmallow cream, it's terrific!!

Easy, really quick recipe for hot chocolate, and its just as good as anything you can buy in the store, if not better because you can add anything you want in it! Good with a little vanilla added too!

This was wonderful today on a rare, snowly day in the south. I substituted 1/2 cup of heavy cream for 1/2 cup of milk to make it even richer.

It was good but a little too syrupy.  I prefer my hot chocolate with more of a mellow chocolate flavor instead of the intense chocolate syrup flavor.  Good though, and my husband loved it.

I tried the "Microwave Single Serving" and was overally impressed with the results.  I found that I needed a little more sugar than what was called for (I added some brown sugar).  A keeper in my book.

I put a little less sugar and a little less vanilla flavor, and lo and behold, this hot cocoa tastes exactly like my favorite hot chocolate from Starbucks.

I had to make this twice, because the first batch went so fast!! My husband came in after a long cold day outside and wanted cocoa so I came to Allrecipes looking. This was a winner, hands down...thanks! It was delicious!

Super Yummy!  I made the microwave version and heated my first 2 teaspoons of milk and cocoa mixture for 15 secs to get rid of any risk that it could bubble over in the mic. I also added a bit of cinnamon to this recipe.  It was perfect.  I will deffinately make this again.

I had ran out of hot chocolate mix and then found this recipe and decided to try it.  I have never had such great tasting hot chocolate.  I will never again buy the mixes.

This recipe was the perfect touch to a cold day... I added whipped cream and cinnimon on top, and a few drops of vanilla. However, I didn't find it substanitally different from store bought, except it was definitely thicker.

Merry Christmas!

It's Christmas morning and I just made this for my family.  They liked it, I love it! I added a candy cane and melted it into the mixture at the end. It was a good addition.

It wasn't as "creamy/chocolatey" as I would have liked. Maybe I'll try it with real chocolate some day...

I don't care at all for hot chocolate, but cool weather is here suddenly and my husband requested some. Since I have never made it for myself, I don't really know how... until I found this recipe! He said it was great, much better than the packaged kind. Huzzah for this easy recipe! And you know what... I bet you could add rum, almond, peppermint, or some other flavoring
instead of the vanilla for a different flavor.

A simple hot cocoa that tastes creamy and nice.  It can be adjusted to whatever number of servings you want without problems.  Also, by making a syrup first you avoid getting "clumps" of bitter cocoa powder floating in your drink.

I'm partial to all things Hershey (having grown up 25 miles away from the city), so I think this is a pretty good hot cocoa recipe.  Good chocolate flavor.  One drawback:  very, very sweet.  I forgot the vanilla, but I'm not sure that would have changed the sweetness factor much.  Adding more cocoa powder to already made cocoa doesn't do much, so in the future, I will just use much less sugar.  Making the chocolate syrup first is a great idea.

This was so unimpressive.  I should've saved myself the trouble and used a cheap packet of hot chocolate mix instead, which would've been equally good, if not better.  I used whole milk and still felt this was a watery hot chocolate.  My bf approved, saying, "That's the way hot chocolate is *supposed* to be," but I say I will never make this recipe again.  Onward I search for a recipe that is more rich and creamy, preferably with a more complex flavor.

This was OK. I made the microwave version and it was very 'chalky' between the teeth. Maybe the stove-top version is better? I'll probably try a different recipe next time.

Adding the Bailey's made this a great hot toddy! Even without, this was by far the best hot cocoa I have ever had. Not too sweet, not too bitter, it was just right. Make sure you follow the directions exactly or it can become gritty.
