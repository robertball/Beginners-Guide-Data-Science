Really good!  The only change I made was to substitute toasted sunflower seeds for pumpkin.

This is a good salad and my rating is based on this version.  But my favorite way to have this salad is to replace the blue cheese dressing with a vinaigrette...preferably a raspberry viniagrette.  You can also replace the blue cheese with gorgonzola.  Try it and you will like.

No doubt about it; this is certainly a very unique salad. I wasn't quite sure what the purpose was of using a blue cheese dressing if the cheese was already in the salad. As another reviewer suggested, I opted for a raspberry dressing and sunflower seeds. The pumpkin seeds seemed a bit chewy for this. Either way, really delicious and thanks!

This was a good salad. I used a balsamic vinaigrette instead of blue cheese dressing. I also threw in some romaine. We found the pumpkin seeds to be too chewy (as another reviewer mentioned), so I would recommend sunflower seeds instead.

I liked this salad. Something different for a change. I made the recipe as written, then topped my salad with some sliced smoked turkey breast which added the perfect amount of depth to the salad....and also made it more filling.

This was quite tasty.  The grapes were what made the salad.  Will make again.

I really liked the grape and cheese together. I did use another dressing, because 1 TB of blue cheese is quite enough for me :=) Thanks for the recipe!

Loved the idea, but I made a few changes.  Took out the grapes and added cold, roasted pumpkin, swapped pumpkin seeds for sunflower and used homemade blue cheese dressing.  Perfect side dish for BBQ rump steak with a glass of unwooded chardonnay!

If you can find it, try smoked bleu cheese....delish.  I wouldn't use bleu cheese dressing as others suggest....a vinaigrette would not interfere with the bleu cheese, or overpower.

I use toasted pecans in place of sunflower, add red onion rings and use poppyseed dressing.
