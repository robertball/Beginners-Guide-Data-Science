I enjoyed this as a mid-afternoon snack! Good use for a banana that was on the way out, as well as the Nutella. The tortilla I used was honey wheat. I meant to buy plain, and when I went to return them, a girl at customer service described this recipe using them (and then I found it here!). So, I'm glad I kept them. I'll bet kids would really enjoy this as a snack. Very easy to make, too! Thanks for the recipe!

Doesn't get much easier than this! The kids gobbled these down when they got home from school. Very good.
