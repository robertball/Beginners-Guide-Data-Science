Very Very good onion sauce. Anyone who enjoys the taste of onions will want to make this. Works well for any dish that could use a little tweaking or to add moisture to a dry meat.
As far as adding calories goes, I'm sure one slice of rye to a entire recipe of onion sauce and then use a portion of it to your dish wouldn't add many calories if you think about it.:)

This turned out pretty good.  Left out the bread and poured over pork roast in slower cooker all day.  Thanks for the post.

Soggy?  What??  Sauce is soggy.  Bread is put through the food blender.  Of course it is going to be soggy.  It is sauce.  Reminds me somehow of German Style cooking.  I don't know why.  But yummy.  Bev

Fabulous sauce that my DH proclaimed to be outstanding. I chose to use a dark bread and served this over pork chops. For the reviewer who said the bread became soggy obviously did not read thru the instructions correctly as the bread becomes a part of the sauce; hence the reason for running it thru the food processor. Thank you Linda!

Rye bread turns out soggy (sp?) and adds too many calories to the meat.  Thanks anyway.  Love rye bread, just did not work for me

I made it as directed but left out the rye. It was good. I don't understand that people post that it is soggy, isn't it supposed to be a sauce as in the title "Onion sauce" not onion crunchy..lol

Excellant onion sauce made exactly as written! I was looking for a sauce to serve over grilled hamburger patties something to compliment the cabbage soup we were having the sauce was light and flavorful, served sourdough crusty chewy bread rolls to mop up the left over sauce! A fast easy dinner:)

I didn't have a food processor / blender available, so I left onions as is. I also used white bread and a pinch of flour. Final product was outstanding. I will definitely make this again.

excellent recipe - I cooked it a little longer on medium low and just waited for the onions to do their magic. As long as the onions are really dark - this recipe has endless (fantastic) variations. As an extra step, I ran the blended sauce through a fine mesh wire strainer - the sauce comes out velvety smooth. It took me about 45 minutes to make, but that was my own choice because I didn't want to have to watch the pan closely. 

As an aside - I used leftover bacon grease instead of butter. I used leftover beef au jus and Oktoberfest Bier instead of chicken broth to pump up the richness (and because that's all I had on hand.) However, I would discourage changing the rye bread - use real, dark, hard, weapons grade rye - I think it's the onion magic and rye bread that makes this recipe. The other ingredients are just extras.
