I know... that was my first thought, too: "Zucchini Cookies? You have got to be kidding me!" However, a cookie is a cookie so I gave these a go. Hello delicious! They were light, soft, chewy, flavorful, and gone! I left out the raisins (I'd rather be poked in the left eye with a shart stick than have to eat a raisin). These were awesome. Give them a try! Really!

Sooooo good.  Stayed with recipe, only some substitutions: used butter instead of margarine and threw in some flax meal and used half whole wheat and half white flour.  No cloves since I didn't have any.  Guests ate them up.  The lactating guest had four, and my children (2 and 4) loved them, raisins and all.  For some reason, I didn't trust they were done at 10 minutes (convection oven).  I left them in for 2 more, and some burned.  Refridgerated overnight, the dough looked all lumpy with sharp points, but when baked, puffed up to these completely round dome-shaped muffin top-like cookies, no matter how sloppily I dropped the dough shapes.  More of a cake texture than a drier cookie texture.  Zucchini didn't show up at all in the finished cookie, but I used a food processor for the whole thing and dumped all ingredients in rather than sifting them in.  What a time saver!  Thanks for the great recipe.

Very very good- Be careful not to overbake- Take them out when they still look slightly "doughey" in the center.  They also freeze very well.  No one will know these have zucchini in them!
Thanks for the great recipe!!!

A co-worker made a batch of these and I have to say, they are just about the most delicious thing I have ever tasted. Now I know what to do with all those zucchini's from our garden.

These were great! I brought them into work and they were gone in one day.  Great spicy note from the cloves. I used dried cranberries instead of raisins, and made sure not to overbake, as others suggested. This cookie was more moist than any I have ever baked!

The cookies were tasty, but it tasted just like zucchini bread, but without the best part of the bread, the middle! I make at least 1 loaf of zucchini bread a month and these cookies just tasted like the outside of the loaf. I'll pass on making this one again.

I left out the raisins in half of the cookies since I'm not a big raisin fan.  I than topped those cookies with a confectioners sugar icing.  SOO good, with or without the icing!

Wow!These cookies were much more excellent than I had expected. The edges were delicately crisp, and the center was like velvety cake. I used golden raisins and mini chocolate chips.

So moist we loved them! 
The first couple of times I made these I did not chill the dough for more than 20 minutes in the freezer. I made them another time and DID chill the dough (for an hour in the freezer once and 2 hours in the fridge) and it made a difference for the better in the way they came out. Taste was the same, texture was better. When I didn't chill them, the cookies came out flat (the pictures I posted) but tasted great. The chilled ones came out puffy and textured. Much prettier.

This is a great recipe.  I used butter instead of margarine but otherwise kept the recipe as is.  I would reccomend a few things though.  I would peel the zucchini before grating, as green bits in cookies aren't that nice looking.  I would also grate the zucchini more fine than I did.  It made the cookies a bit stringy in texture. (I will try the idea of another reader and use the food processor) Otherwise they were soft (almost cake like) and have a great taste.  I will certainly make them again, but will add a bit more of the cinnamon and maybe some ginger too!  Great first attempt!

a little bland, could use a little more cinnamon. But very moist and easy to make, a good way to use up your zucchini.

Cookies tasted delicious but I must have done something wrong.  Followed as directed and chilled overnight, the dough was very moist and the cookies came out almost flat.  Only thing I did differently was rather than shredded zucchini, I grated in my food processor, perhaps that made too much moisture?  Will make again using shredded zucchini.

So I under-baked these at 8mins because I was afraid to over-bake them, but, WOW, even though they were too soft due to my fault, the taste of these were SO delicious! My son who asked what the green stuff was was hesitant to try them, but when he did he ended up eating 4 of them that afternoon. I didn't put raisins because my son hates them so instead I added choc. chips. These were easy and I had all the ingredients on hand. I will definitely be making these little heavenly bites again but add a minute or two to the baking time.  Thanks for a yummy, easy recipe!!!! I actually sneaked one in before my breakfast this morning they were so delicious!

pretty good. I used craisins instead of raisins. These baked a little thinner than I thought they would. Otherwise a good cookie. The kids liked them.

The cookies taste VERY good - my only qualm is that they spread out a lot in the oven and consequently are quite thin (and take more space on the cookie sheet).

AMAZING!!!! Made exactly as written, and these are absolutely fabulous. The dough is extremely soft, even after refrigerating 5 hours. I pressed on, however, and was rewarded with soft, perfectly spiced treats. Because my kids love glazes and frostings, I waited for them to cool 5 minutes, then brushed a thick glaze (1 Tb soft butter, 3/4 cup powdered sugar, a dash of vanilla, a dash of cinnamon, and 2 tsp milk) onto the top of each. Waited a minute for the glaze to soften and begin to melt from the heat still in the cookies, then brushed the glaze to distribute thinly and evenly over the tops. For my taste, however, they were excellent just plain. So long as you know that these are soft, cake-like cookies and aren't expecting them to be at all crispy, you're going to love these.

I loved this recipe! And so did my kids. I would call this more of a bread cookie then a traditional cookie. I did change the recipe slightly. I used butter i/o margarine, i used 1/2 cup more flour because I added 3 Tbsp of Apple Sauce, and I removed the raisins (not a fav. of ours in cookies). These cookies didnt even last long enough to cool down! I'll be doubling the batch next time. To yummy!

EXCELLENT recipe and a hit with the family and neighbours. I substituted vegetable shortening for margarine, reduced the sugar to 3/4 cup and increased the zucchini to 1.5 cups. I also left the mixture in the fridge for almost 24 hours and I lined the cookie sheets with parchment paper instead of greasing them. Next time, I'm going to experiment with substituting dates for raisins and adding grated carrot to the mix.

I am not sure what happened. I followed the recipe to exact, and it didn't turn out good. It tastes fine, good thing I put white chocolate chips in it.. even better. If these aren't going to be eaten in a day, don't bother leaving them out the next. It was definitely a "cake" cookie.. it's cake that you mold the so called "dough" onto the cookie sheet.

My daughter loved these cookies- the husband said they were "pretty good".  He said that dipping them in whipped cream made them MUCH better and that would be worth a 4 star rating.

The taste of these "cookies" was great!  I was expecting a more cookie like texture but it was more like a muffin top.  I also added a dash of nutmeg and used butter instead of margarine as this was what I had on hand. Pretty good muffin tops :)

First time and it was a success! I didn't have any cloves so I substituted nutmeg which turned out ok I think. I made my portions as 16 large cookies so they ended up to be very filling desserts. Will probably make this again :)

Our favorite cookie now with the following suggestions from other reviewers! Shred the zucchini with shredder blade of food processor and then sprinkle kosher salt on shredded zucchini in strainer. After 30 minutes transfer the zucchini to cheesecloth and squeeze out the excess juices. I use 1 1/2 c white flour and 1/2 c whole wheat flour. Omit cinnamon, cloves, and raisins. Add 1 tsp vanilla and 1/2 bag of white chocolate chips. CHILL in fridge at least 1 hour. Bake 14 minutes (to just past golden) on parchment paper  and then squish down each cookie with a spatula. Remove immediately to wire racks. Makes 30 cookies.

Tasted good, but more like a cake or muffin top as others said. I purposely overcooked a batch until they were JUST past golden in color then I squished them down with the spatula as soon as I took them out, and the texture was MUCH more like a cookie. Those ones tasted better than the others. My husband liked them that way better too. Next time I'll try leaving out cloves and adding vanilla as someone else suggested, so I can add the chocolate chips! Thanks for sharing!

Deelish! The best cookies I've had in a long time! The only substitutions I made were whole wheat flour and real butter. This recipe is definitely a keeper!

These cookies were an enormous hit!  Thankfully I doubled the recipe.  I didn't see 'egg' on ingredients, so I inadvertently left it out.  Didn't seem to matter.  Already have a request to make them again, for me I'd prefer to cut the sugar a bit.  Substituted craisins for raisins and butter for margarine.  They were very delicious.

Tasty!  I used whole wheat flour and added milled flax seed.  Made 2 dozen and had to bake for 12 minutes.  Yum!  My hubby and 6 year old loves them.

I don't normally review a recipe - I just like to try them all.  So, this is a first for me.  I made the recipe as directed.  I baked them for 11 minutes, until the tops were no longer "shiney".  The first batch was almost gone before they cooled off.  So, the next batch I doubled and just got done making them. Did I fail to mention this was all in one morning???   These are some of the best cookies I've had in a long time.  Oh, I also used real butter instead of margarine because I don't have margarine in my refrigerator, but other than that, I used the exact recipe.  Excellent and thanks for sharing!

The indicated 8-10 minutes baking time is sorely inadequate. 13-14 minutes is the correct time. Also, 2 C sugar make them way too sweet.

These were good.  They are similar to an oatmeal cookie.  I made these twice and I prefer them without the cloves.  Also, I put chopped pecans instead of raisins because I don't like raisins in cookies.

These were very good.  My kids really like them, and they are not veggie eaters.  My only problem was that they fell apart fairly easily, but I did have to use an egg replacer instead of the egg because one of my son is allergic.  I will have to find a way to adapt the recipe, but the taste is great.

A nice soft cookie with the texture of a pumpkin cookie and almost the taste of zucchini bread. My husband doesn't like raisins so I used semi-sweet choc chips instead.  I wanted to use up my zucchini so I shredded instead of grated and upped the 1 cup to 2.It worked fine. I'm pretty sure they're tasty, I only got 1 to eat. Didn't move fast enough!

Great cookies!  My family, kids and friends all gobbled them up.  The only change I made was chocolate chips instead of raisins.  But everyone loved the cloves/cinnamon and that is the key to these cookies!  Delish.

Great recipe and cookies. I made the dough on Friday night and baked Sunday morning. They are still soft and cakey cookies but held together. I substituted 1/2 C. oats and 1/2 C. whole wheat flour for one of the cups of regular flour. Also I was out of raisins so I used craisins. Thanks!

Cookies came out great!! What a great way to use up some of the extra zucchini!!  The dough ended up being in the fridge for 24hrs before I got a chance to bake them, but I had no problems.  I made a double batch and put some in the freezer for later :)

I had never heard of zucchini cookies until I found this recipe and they were really good~ very flavorful.  I made them for a friend of ours who had given us several zucchinis from their garden and they really enjoyed them.  They first tried them in the dark outside and it wasn’t until they saw them in the daylight that they said, “wow I don’t even like raisins.”  So unless you’re looking you won’t even know the raisins are there.  I did make a few modifications to the recipe—I’m a vegan so I used Ener-G egg replacer instead of eggs and I also used 100% vegetable oil margarine.  I also used whole wheat flour to add fiber.  The vegan modifications make the recipe cholesterol free.  One tip I have-- be careful not to make the cookies to large or they will fall apart very easily.

These cookies are not pretty, but they are very tasty.  Make sure to not overbake.  I tried half the dough with chocolate chips instead of raisins, and, while the chocolate tasted fine, the raisins were much better.

Oh my gosh! These cookies are the best! I made them without the raisins or the cloves and they were delicious! My family ate them up as fast as I could make them!If you don't want them spicy don't use the cloves. Next time I am using blueberries. Zucchini blueberry bread tasted amazing so I'm guessing I can do the same with cookies and have it taste just as amazing!

Delicious!  I made some changes, but I'm sure they are amazing as is.  I substituted whole wheat for white flour, used real butter, omitted the cloves, and instead of raisins I used coconut flakes and dark chocolate chips.  They are unbelievably soft, fluffy, and moist.  Definite winner!

Wonderful !!!  What else can I say!  Made these for a potluck lunch today at work and they were gone in a flash and everyone was looking for more.  I loved the addition of the cloves in this.  Chopped walnuts would make a good addition, will try that next time.   Not only is this recipe easy and quick,  but a great way to use some zucchini.  Thanks for sharing, Marian !

Since its that time of summer when the gardens in Maine start to overflow with this versatile vege, this is a sweet treat with stealth vege for the kids. Perfect to use up those zuc's that sneek by and get a little too big. We add ground nutmeg and change to the "real fat" butter. And of coarse fresh free range eggs.

This is a great recipe for using up all the zuchinni that sprouts up over the summer.  I'm not much for a spice cookie, so I did not add the cloves.  I added a tsp of vanilla paste in it's place.  The cookies were delicious!!  I took them to our church gathering and received lots of compliments.  Thank you so much for a great recipe!

followed recipe except I added only about a half cup of raisins and I chopped them up (my family not big raisin eaters) and added about 1/4th more zucchini to accommodate the moisture.  My whole family loved them.  I couldn't keep my 15 month olds hands off the cooling racks.  My whole house smelled like Thanksgiving.  These are a new favorite at our house.

I've made cookies that are more bread-like than cookie-like before, but these were a very funny texture and consistency. They had no crumble to them whatsoever.  Someone else described them as muffin-tops, I think that's a better description, but still they're more like bread.  Texture aside, the flavor was good and although they didn't exactly get gobbled right up, my boyfriend enjoyed them.  I think I'll keep searching for a way to use up my zucchini.

The taste is good, but the cookies are soft as cake.  I like a cookie with a little bit of crunch...something that holds up to dunking in a cold glass of milk.

These were really good! I just took them out of the oven like 10 mins ago and had to try one! I like to call these muffin tops because they are more of a cake like cookie. I don't know if that's how they are suppose to be but mine were haha. I skipped the raisins and cloves and added grated carrots and a brown sugar, lemon glaze to the tops. Next time I might add some oats for a little texture or a tiny bit of topping like the kind on coffee cake. Yummy cookies!

These should be called Zucchini sugar cakes.  They were great and reminded me of old fashioned sugar cakes. I didn't have raisins or cloves, so I didn't add them, may be why I only ended up with 18 sugar cakes, I mean cookies.  Oh, I did use butter instead of margarine. I will definetly make these again.

I really enjoyed these cookies! Soft and moist - I did substitute nutmeg for the cloves and didn't use the raisins - like mini zucchini bread! YUM! Thanks for sharing the recipe Marian! This will use up my plentiful zucchini out of my garden :o)

My niece and nephew loved this cookie.  We eat them as fast as I bake them.  :-)  
I did add 1/4 teaspoon ginger to the recipe.  I think ginger goes well with the cinnamon and cloves. I also used canola oil instead of margarine.  I have already made this recipe 4 times and am getting ready to make it again.  Thank you for a great cookie!

Excellent!  A soft cookie resembling more of a cake than a crisp cookie.  I added 1 teaspoon of nutmeg.  I didn't use raisins since I didn't have any on hand.  You could probably use cranraisins too.  Also the addition of chopped nuts would be nice if one desired.

Thought these cookies were tasty and moist.  I made a few changes to make it a wee bit healthier...1/4 c butter, 1/4 c. pumpkin butter, 1/2 c sugar.  Used 1 c. whole wheat flour and 1 c. reg flour.  Other than that left the rest of the recipe the same.  Thanks for the recipe.  Next time will use applesauce instead of pumkin butter and reduce sugar even more. :)

These cookies were good not great(I followed the exact recipe).  Everyone said they tasted strange but good.  They had a cakey like texture that made it not seem like a normal cookie.  Would highly recommend to refrigerate batter overnight (I alway did 1 1/2hrs and they were runny when I but them on the pan).

These are very good when you have so much zucchini and don't want to see another zucchini bread.  For me, I think I'll use brown sugar next time to give them a darker appearance.  If you like a sweeter cookie you'll want to add a little more sugar or chips.  Great recipe!

These are very good!!  I did not add the raisins (my son is not a fan), but I did put some white chocolate chips on top of each cookie.  Also, instead of 2 cups all purpose flour, I put 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour and 1/2 cup whole wheat flour.  They are excellent and my kids are eating them up!

These cookies tasted great (and the batter even better), but they were the consistency of a bread, not a cookie.  Perhaps the recipe should call for baking powder and not soda.

this is a very good cookie for being made with zucchini.  I made it exactly as the recipe states, except I probably only left the dough in the fridge for 1/2 hour before baking them.  They didn't spread too much at all they rose up nicely.

GREAT COOKIE! No hint of zucchini, Just really moist, even after overcooking.. I blended my golden raisins  and grated zucchini into the egg, butter and sugar for a smoother cookie. Hit with the kiddos and adults alike

These cookies are fabulous!  I changed the recipe just a little.  I used the whole wheat flour like another suggestion.  I also put in some black walnuts.  My BF is wild about those walnuts and harvests and cracks them himself.  They did not overwhelm this cookie and really complimented the flavor.  Next I will try some choco chips or some craisins.  GREAT!

mmmmmmmmmmm good!  I absolutely love zucchini bread and this tastes just like it.  Although I wouldn't really think of them as a cookie, more like a little muffin top.  I am definately going to make these again.

Hope to change this recipe to a higher rating - they're easy to make, the dough tasted good, cookies puffed up excellently..  but at 8minutes, on parchment paper, at the temperature of 375 as instructed, they were burned black on the bottoms.  Of course I had to do two pans beside each other too, lol.  NOW I'll try what's left at a lower temperature and see what happens there!  (Can't say they taste good - as the bottoms are too black to even eat! :( )

So good - moist, like little muffin-cookies!  My husband and 2yr old daughter love them!  I used allspice instead of the cloves and they taste Great!
Can't wait to make some more to share with friends!
Thanks for a unique and tasty recipe!

Unfortunatly I had a not so great experience with these "cookies". If you are looking for a great zucchini cookies recipe- keep on looking. These arent as much cookies as they are puffy-muffiny-floury-cakey-thick blobs. Yes- they remained quite moist- but they're not cookies. I had terrible reviews all round on this one. I had my boyfriend complaining that they're not cookies- they taste too much like flour, they're thick, and not worth all the trouble. 
Sorry. I agree with him.
I will NOT be making these again. I gave it a 2 star, because although they're terrible, they're still edible.
Thanks.
and sorry.

These are delicious.  I love the spice!  I used whole cloves I broke up myself as I love clove.  I would like to make these with a wheat flour to add some bulk to them and more fiber.  They are just a little to cake-like for me.

Perfect zucchini cookies, just like Mom made. Texture is perfect too-like sponges. I did alter the recipe - used butter, a combo of whole wheat white/whole wheat pastry, added 1/2 tsp. vanilla and walnuts instead of raisins. So good!

These are very good.  Those who have had trouble with this recipe probably haven't cooled the dough in the fridge as the recipe tells you to do.  Make sure you only use 1 cup of shredded zucchini too.  They are cakey and delicious.

Tasty. I will make these again, esp. since I have a lot of zucchini from the garden. I might consider adding a bit of brown sugar to these next time. I felt they could have been a bit sweeter.

Eh, these were alright, but only just.  I omitted the raisins (I can't stand raisins!) but regretted it as the cookies were slightly bland.  Next time, I will add cranberries and raisins, (craisins, maybe?) and see if that helps.  On the other hand, my sister totally demolished them, so she'd probably give these cookies 5 stars!

Delicious.  I used half ww flour, about 3/4c sugar, and some nutmeg and ginger in place of allspice because I had none.  Also used half butter instead of all margarine.

Yum. These cookies were easy to make and taste delish. I added 1/2 tsp of nutmeg and replaced the margarine with butter. I also made sure to squeeze out as much water from the zucchini as possible. Will make again.

These cookies are awesome! Super easy too! The only thing is to make SURE that your dough is super chilled, otherwise they will come out super crumbly-but that was my fridge's fault so definitely 5 stars still!!!

These are ok- You can really taste the cloves in them (I made them as the recipe states)... I suppose if you like cloves a lot, these would be awesome for you! Otherwise, they're pretty good and I'm sure my family will love them. I'll probably make them again, but maybe next time I'll just use pumpkin pie spice in place of both the cinnamon and cloves.

Excellent cookies!  A great way to use up zucchini in the garden.  All 3 of my young boys love these.  I would double the recipe next time though because I made larger cookies and only got 24 out of this recipe.

These are very tasty and would never know there was zucchini in there - I made them exactly to recipe.  Only real complaint is that they turned out very cakey - so they fall apart kind of easily.  Won't make them again.

These were okay. I made them exactly as the recipe states except left out the cloves because I didn't have any. They just weren't anything spectacular to me. Not as good as zucchini bread so I think I'll just use my zucchini for that.

Great cookies...so easy to make.  I omitted the raisins just because I didn't have any.  I also did as another poster recommended and smashed the cookies down with a spatula as soon as they came out of the oven.  I liked that it gave them a more 'cookie' texture and less like a cake or loaf of zucchini bread.

My family loved this recipe.  They all said it tasted like a recipe we have for pumpkin chocolate chip cookies.  I would suggest peeling the zucchini before you grade it.  I didn't and it gave the cookies a greenish color.  All in all it was a great recipe.

What a great use of our abundant zucchini crop and a wonderful way to get my children to eat zucchini while they think they are having a "cookie".  

I used whole wheat flour and also added some oats.  I did not have enough rasins and so I added 1/2 rasins 1/2 walnuts.  They turned out great.  I also cut the sugar by 1/4 cup.  They were not very sweet but were still wonderful and tasty.

My husband and son loved them witout the raisins.  I added chocolate chips for my daughter.  She didn't like them.  Next time I make them with chocolate chips I'll omit the clove and add vanilla.  Cookies were very most & cake like.

I had lots of zucchini so I doubled this recipe and it makes plenty to go around. I also used walnuts since I didn't have raisins and they turned out great! I live at high altitude but these seemed unaffected by that. Will definitely make again, delicious and easy!

These turned out just as per other reviewers said - like mini zucchini loaves, quite cakey.  Still tastey though!  I'd probably stick to a zucchini loaf.

My family gave these cookies a big thumbs up!! I just changed a couple of things. I did half whole wheat pastry flour and half white and then mixed half white sugar and half brown sugar. They were excellent and my daughter said she couldn't even taste the Zucchini.

I made this recipe but had to add a little more flour than called for. Although, I did make with all organic ingredients so that could be why. The cookies were great. Tasted like mini zucchini breads. Variation: I added chocolate chips to the recipe and turned out great.

These cookies are strange, but everyone loves them.  Kind of a mix with a gingerbread cookie, to me anyway.  Great stuff, thanks!  Always looking for things to do with ALL that zucchini.

Though the flavor was nice, the texture was to "cakey". They were too soft and chewy for my liking.

I made some changes according to what I had in my cupboard.  I used raw sugar and wholemeal SR flour, so I didn't need baking powder. I only had 1/2 zucchini so I also added 1 small carrot. I also added some vanilla extract and cocoa. The second batch I topped with flaked almonds before baking, and the third batch I topped with white chia seeds. YUM! My new favourite snack! Thanks for sharing!

Love this recipe! I deviated slightly and didnt have time to chill the dough. Instead I melted the butter and exchanged raisins for mini chocolate chips. The melted butter puffed the cookies right up and they are the perfect texture!

I converted this recipe to gluten free, switched out the white sugar with coconut sugar and organic sugar, added a trace of chopped walnuts.  They were great, however slightly dry.  I contributed this to the fact that I'd wrung out the zucchini.   Won't do that next time.  Will make again.

I am pregnant and was craving chocolate cookies but wanted to make it a bit healthier for the kiddos and I. Saw this recipe and gave it a try. Substituted butter for margarine, nutmeg for cloves, and 3/4 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips for raisins. Will say this turned out delicious! Will be my go-to chocolate chip zucchini cookie recipe!

Super easy to make and tasty. I replaced raisins with chocolate chips (my grandson isn't too keen on raisins). I lined the cookie sheet with parchment paper that made cleanup a breeze and the cookies perfect. I baked the first batch for 8 minutes but it was a bit underdone. 10 minutes was just right. I think the chocolate chips made it a little too sweet, so I think the next time I'll try dried cranberries, or maybe reduce the sugar if using chocolate chips again.

Everyone said they were good.  Baked 9 minutes.  Soft with brown edges.  I put both golden raisins and chocolate chips in.  My son suggested to pick one or the other.  Kept in fridge before baking for about 2 hours.  Came out great.

My kids love these cookies (when made without the raisins).  They barely last a day.  To help give the cookies a nutrient boost, I substitute 3/4 cup whole wheat flour, 1/4 cup flaxseed meal, and 1/4 cup oatmeal for 1 1/4 cups of the all-purpose flour.

Good, healthy, low cal cookies. I liked the recipe, but cut down the sugar and added 1/2 brown sugar and 1/2 Splenda to total 1 cup. Also cut down the raisins to 1/2 and added 1/2 cup chopped almonds.

I didn't have any raisins,  They would have been great and given a little texture.  Very well received. Maybe cut back on the salt just a little.

These are yummy but are more like little cakes than cookies. As long as you want a very cake-like cookie, then you'll love these. I followed the recipe to a T except that I halved the sugar (they were still perfectly sweet), used butter instead of margarine, and omitted the cloves because I didn't have any. Oh, I did add a handful or two of chopped walnuts.

Very yummy! I was a bit skeptical, but I had tons of zucchini in my garden this year, so I tried them anyway and they were delicious! I didn't have ground cloves so used nutmeg instead and I made half with raisins and the other half with chocolate chips.

I have to say I was surprised how tasty these were! Made for the kids but I scarfed back a few as well. Used less sugar and craisins instead of the raisins but a seriously tasty cookie with the veggie being a bonus!

the batter for these cookies was way to thin. Maybe I should have squeezed the water out of the zuchinni before I added to the batter. It came out like cake but the flavor was good. Did anyone else have this problem?

These are the best cookies. The only substitute I made was I used butter instead of margarine and used chocolate chips in place of the raisins.  My family couldn't get enough of them and I even doubled the recipe.  The were gone in less than two days!
