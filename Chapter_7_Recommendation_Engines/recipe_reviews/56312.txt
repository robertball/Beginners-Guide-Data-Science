These muffins come out moist and delicious if a full cup of fresh pumpkin is used instead of 3/4 cup canned, and canola oil is used instead of vegetable oil. I also used 1/2 tsp cinnamon, 1/4 tsp cloves, 1/4 tsp ginger instead of pumpkin pie spice and they were not bland at all. They are much better eaten warm. They also freeze well.

I followed the advice of a previous review and used a full cup of pumpkin puree.  I also used one 3/4 tsp of cinnamon, 1/2 tsp of ginger and 1/4 tsp of nutmeg in place of the pumpkin pie spice.  These turned out moist and delicious, with the added bonus of being healthier than most muffins. Great recipe!!!

I am very happy with this recipe! I am 31 years old and have never been able to make a edible muffin, they are usually tough from too much stirring or tasteless or fall apart, etc. This recipe is perfect for people like me, it is easy and my favorite - adaptable. I like to experiment with different ingredients, especially types of flours and this it the one that I can use. I made the muffins last night, using a heaping cup of fresh pumpkin puree and 2 1/2 tsp pumpkin pie spice. I upped the raisins as well and left out the walnuts. Filled cups level to top as another reviewer suggested and they turned out very good, my three year old son loved them. I made another batch right away and used 1 cup of whl. wht. flour and half a cup oat flour, used chocolate chips instead of raisins and no walnuts.Again another heaping cup of fresh pumpkin and two tsp cinnamon, 1/2 tsp nutmeg and a heaping 1/4 tsp ginger. Turned out perfect. I can not wait to try this recipe with barley flour. Oh another hint that helped me alot was to stir the batter with a rubber spatula instead of a spoon and to fold the ingredients not stir! Thank you for helping me fix my "muffin mistakes".

Would just like to add that I have made another batch of muffins a few days later, only I substituded fresh mashed pears for the pumpkin - even better with this friut! I had to bake longer than recipe called for.

These are fantastic. I followed the recommendations of increasing the pumpkin and substituting half the oil for apple sauce. I didn't have spice mix so I added 1 tsp ginger, 1 tsp cinamon and half a tsp ground cloves and ground nutmeg. Best muffins I've ever made!

I was really disapointed in the results of this recipe. I followed the recipe exactly as it says and I was so excited because I really thought they were gonna turn out great because they smelled so wonderful baking. Well after baking them for 18 min. they were still not done so I added another 6 min. then they were done. I buttered one up and took a bite and was totally disapointed! They were extremely bland and had this dry 'wheat' bread taste. Not a moist and pumpkin-flavored muffin like I was expecting. I would not recommend this recipe to anyone. I'm sorry, but it's quite terrible! YUCK

I used 1 cup of pumpkin as many reviewers had suggested, and I left out the raisins.  The muffins were very moist and tasty.  I didn't think you can tell that they're made with whole wheat flour.

Very good! I use 1 1/2 tsp cinnamon and 1/2 tsp nutmeg instead of pumpkin pie spice. And 1/2 a bag of milk chocolate chip morsels. SO GOOD. Try it. Very easy. You can get 12 muffins out of one batch, but I like to double it and use the bigger can of pumpkin puree.  Also, if you fill the cups right up to the edge (batter is a little stiff) then it mounds up to look like a perfect little muffin. I also tried to make a loaf out of this and it didn't work so good.  Will stick with the muffins. Thanks for the awesome recipe!!

Loved this recipe - the muffin was so tender and light that you wouldn't even know it wasn't white flour!  This recipe was so easy that my 2 year old daughter was able to help me with it and she and I devoured them afterwards.  I loved the idea of soaking the raisins to make thm softer too, it really added a nice texture.  Again, I made only a few changes out of necessity. I added 1/2 tsp cinnamon, 1/4 tsp ground cloves and 1/4 tsp ground nutmeg b/c I didn't have the pumpkin pie spice, and I used spelt flour and pecans b/c that's what I had on hand.  But the recipe is so easy that I decided to make 3 more batches and give them to neighbors as gifts!  Thank you so much for this fabulous recipe!

I used a whole can of pumpkin and additional  cinnamon. They came out great! These were a good way to add fiber to my preschooler's diet.

My family and friends love these. I omitted the rasins and nuts and added chocolate chips. I did not have pumpkin pie spice so I added cinnamon, ginger, cloves and a pinch of nutmeg.

These muffins are delicious - 5 stars with the following revisions:     I followed other reviewers suggestions:  1/2 cup apple sauce and 1/2 cup light tasting olive oil/1 tsp cinnamon, 1 tsp ginger and 1/2 tsp cloves and nutmeg instead of the pumpkin spice/1 cup pumpkin puree instead of 3/4 cup.    I was short one egg, so I added an extra 1/4 cup applesauce.  I replaced the nuts and raisins with 1/2 cup (soaked) dried cranberries.  I cut the brown sugar in half as well as cutting the honey down a bit.  They are still plenty sweet!  Next time, I think I will cut the sugar down even more.

I made this recipe as written except I used a mix of spices in place of the pumpkin pie spice.  The texture, color and flavor were great.  Not too sweet, dry or crumbly.  I did mix in some fresh cranberries for a little bit of tart.  Really good, my young kids love them!

I think they are good as is, but my husband and I both agree that it would be a 5-star recipe if it incorporated some bran. The recipe just screams for bran to really complete it. The flavors are good--the pumpkin and honey flavors are unique and delicious together. My husband thinks the muffins are super sweet, but I think they're just sweet. Will probably look for another pumpkin recipe with bran.

These were great!  I tripled the recipe (if I'm gonna bake, I'm gonna BAKE), using the already mentioned entire cup of pumpkin rather than 3/4 (so I used 3 cups). I substituted apple sauce for about 2/3 of the oil, left out the rainsins and walnuts, and used a lot of cinnamon, cloves, ginger, and nutmeg instead of the pumpkin pie spice. I used a little bit of oatmeal in place of some of the flour (in a single batch recipe, it probably ends up being about 1/4 cup). Not only do they taste great, but they are beautiful!.

This was super good, I thought it was a little too sweet, I might cut back the sugar next time.  I used organic honey and fresh roasted pumpkin instead of canned, and added a bit more raisins.  My 4 year old ate them up.  :)

Oh my, these are soooo good! For some reason I didn't think I liked pumpkin muffins, but I had some pumpkin to use up, and I like to have healthy-ish muffins on hand for busy mornings, so I gave this a try and I'm so glad I did! They're delicious, very moist and not dense or heavy at all.  I skipped the raisins (just personal preference) but increased the walnuts, also added more pumpkin pie spice than called for and threw in a splash of vanilla. They took about 24 minutes to bake, but I suspect I made them a bit too big because I only got 11 muffins out of it. Thanks so much for this recipe, it's a winner!

I love a tender, moist and substantial whole grain muffin recipe and this one fits that description. Very flavorful as well. I added a 1/2 tsp ginger for a pumpkin ginger flavor, as well as chopped candied ginger in place of the raisins. Took them over the top, for me. Everyone at my house loved these muffins, and I'm happy to have another to add to our favorites file. Thank you!

I changed the 1 1/2 cups whole wheat flour to 3/4c whole wheat flour and 3/4 cup ground flax seed.  I also reduced the honey to 1/4 cup, and added only a single quick shake of salt.  The muffins were moist, plenty sweet for me, and had a nice nutty flavor.  I've made them several times and they are always moist and delicious!  Thank you for the recipe.

These are great!  I used 1 cup whole wheat and 1/2 cup all purpose flour.  The only other thing I did differently was that I finely chopped the walnuts and sprinkled them over the top of the muffins before cooking instead of mixing into the dough.  They are absolutely delicious, great texture.  A nice healthy snack to have on hand.

I have made these 2x already and both batches were great.  The 1st batch I had a bit more pumpkin and my cooking time increased accordingly.  The 2nd batch was to the recipe and they were great.  They are nice and moist and were good on day 2 & 3.

I  hate when people completely change a recipe and then review it, but since it came out so well here goes: I substituted 4 TBS of milled flax and one TBS of water to represent one egg and one TBS of oil.  I then subbed 1/4 c. applesauce and then just added the remaining 3 TBS oil and upped the pumpkin to 1 c. like suggested and these were outstanding! So moist and tasty! My 18 month old ate two in one sitting, great recipe!

I've made this recipe several times and the muffins come out TERRIBLE in a regular sized muffin pan but as MINI-MUFFINS, they're delicious and moist, and people RAVE about them.

These were moist, but VERY sweet!  I don't think it needs brown sugar and honey both.  Next time I might try cutting back the honey to like 2 or 3 tablespoons.  Also, I used dried cranberries instead of raisins (soaked them as directed) and they worked great.

I hate when people review a recipe and change everything about it BUT I wanted to show everyone how easy it can be to make a recipe healthier and it still come out awesome. I didn't have a raisins but I will use them next time. However, I used regular Splenda instead of brown sugar and used half a Tablespoon of molasses, cinnamon instead of pie spice, only a Tablespoon of oil and a Tablespoon of sugar free maple syrup then followed the other parts of the recipe. These were great!

Great!  I doubled the recipe to use a whole can of pumpkin, changed the vegetable oil to Walnut oil, and added some nutmeg and cinnamon in addition to the pumpkin pie spice.  Also, cut out half the honey and use unsweetened applesauce if you're looking to cut down on sugar.

We have made these several times now.  Tasty, moist, tender and always a sucess---even with tweaks here and there.  I add cranberries and pecans instead of the rasins and walnuts, bump up the pumpkin to 1-1 1/4 cups and replace 1/2 or all or the oil with applesauce.

EXCELLENT!!!!!  I made them exactly as the recipe specified, except that I used an entire 15 oz. can of pumpkin.  Oh, and I used toasted pecans instead of walnuts.  They are unbelievably moist and rich and DELICIOUS, not to mention healthy (as muffins go)!  I love these muffins!!!!

Definitely a "healthy" tasting muffin but that's what I was expecting.   Chocolate chips added a lot to the recipe.

Terrific recipe! Instead of adding sugar and honey I used 1/2 cup of light agave nectar and wow... they're good! Didn't have pumpkin pie spice, so I substituted 1 t. cinnamon, 1/2 t. nutmeg, 1/4 t. ground cloves. 

I'll be making these again soon. Thanks for the recipe!

They were OK, not much flavor. I would add more pumpkin next time. I didn't use oil, instead I used more pumpkin, and it still wasn't the pumpkin flavor I was looking for. For simple pumpkin muffins I just use a whole can of pumpkin and a box of spice cake and mix it together and that's it! I will just stick to my own recipe.

I made as suggested and used 1 cup of pumpkin instead of 3/4.  They were very good, but for my taste to moist and soft; I prefer a muffin a little sturdier, more substantial.  But they were delicious, great flavor.  I will definitely make again, but try to lower amount of pumpkin.

These were really tasty. I halved both the brown sugar and the honey, but next time I think I will cut out the brown sugar and keep the whole amount of honey so that it's not too sweet but keeps it moist. I like the fact that these muffins are whole wheat, I added wheat bran and flax as well. I followed other reviews and used 1 cup of pumpkin. I topped mine with pumpkin seeds and sprinkled cane sugar before baking and it was delicious!

I used 1 cup homemade pureed pumpkin but otherwise followed the recipe exactly, except that I had to omit the raisins and nuts so that my son could bring them to school for snack.  My 5 year old loves these muffins, although his younger siblings don't seem interested.  My husband and I both thought they were pretty good as well.  I'll bet they are great with the raisins and nuts!

These are very good and very moist for using whole wheat flour.  Only a couple of changes.  I used canola oil, upped the pumpkin to 1 cup,  used 2 teaspoons of pumpkin pie spice, and left out the nuts.  Baked them for almost 17 minutes.  If you are on WW they are 6 points if you make 12 standard size muffins.

Very good! Try using 1/4 cup molassas for 1/4 cup of the honey it's wonderful! *** Just made these a second time-realized too late I had no brown sugar OR honey (oops)- I subbed white sugar for brown and a combination of molassas and log cabin for honey-hubby says there better than the first batch!

These turned out very moist and flavorful!  I used 1.5 tsp of cinnamon and .5 tsp of nutmeg in place of pumpkin spice.  I also used olive oil instead of vegetable oil  I also used pecans instead of walnuts because I didn't have any.  I plan on making these again.  The kids really liked them too!

Just pulled these from the oven! I left out the raisins and walnuts, added 1/2 cup dark chocolate chips, and used unsweetened apple sauce instead of oil. Also used 1/3 cup of honey instead of 1/2 and increased pumpkin to 1 cup as others suggested. Fluffy and delicious- will make again for sure! This made 12 large muffins and 12 mini muffins.

Good muffins, very moist. I took the advice of others and used 1 C of pumpkin. I also used only a 1/4 C of honey and the muffins were still sweet enough. I will bake these again.

Good basic recipe, I used WW pastry flour, doubled the recipe, used 1/2 the honey, sub'd applesauce for 1/2 of the oil and added a lot of spices, pumpkin pie spice and cinnamon. I also used dried cranberries instead of raisins. My kids love these!

These are fantastic!  My family devoured these and asked for more.  After combing through the reviews I used 1 full c. of pumpkin (took about 10 mins extra baking time).  I added a splash of vanilla and sunflower seeds instead of walnuts since I didn't realize I was out until I started cooking (idiot alert!).  Very forgiving recipe and would be great with chocolate chips, various nuts/dried fruit etc.

These muffins were moist and perrrrfect! I only had a couple of tablespoons of honey, so I added a little agave for sweetness, and a scoop of pumpkin to make up for the loss in wet ingredients. I didn't have "pumpkin pie spice," so I added a bit of ginger, cinnamon and cloves. I had to use turbinado sugar instead of light brown sugar. I was worried about using all whole wheat flour making them dry, but they weren't at all! Thanks so much for sharing!

It was really good, I did follow the advice of others for the added pumpkin and using the three spices instead of the pumpkin spice, but ended up using 2-3 more tspoons more of the pumpkin spice to even smell it in the batter. They turned out great, and I also used applesauce instead of oil!!! Very yummy for this Clean Eating family!!!

These muffins came out soft, fluffy, and perfectly textured... and not especially tasty. It was really disappointing! I usually really love pumpkin everything, so I was surprised. I can't say why I didn't like it, but something about the flavor just wasn't right.

Simply awesome!  Moist and sweet - like a little cake.  White flour can be used instead of wheat, but I think I like the wheat best.  I increased the pumpkin to 1 cup and baked it just a little longer.  Don't skimp on the nuts.  We end up "sharing" with everyone .  We even had a person supply the nuts so that I would make them a batch!  Fantastic - freezes well too.

These were good but something was just a little off with the spices. I'd like to try them again but do some tweaking.

Very good. Halved the brown sugar. Increased to 1 cup of fresh, pureed pumpkin. Plenty sweet. Very delicious, except for one thing; tasted a little salty. Didn't see anyone else comment in the few reviews I read, but followed instructions carefully, so will definitely reduce next time.

LOVE this recipe...made many times and substitute applesauce for oil plus add ground flax seed. A little nutmeg and craizens add extra flavor.Made double recipe this morning and will freeze them to enjoy anytime!

My family loves these. They're wonderful to grab for breakfast or an afterschool snack. Delicious, moist and healthy! I double the recipe and they still disappear fast.

This one is just awesome! The muffins taste great when warm, will try it tomorrow to see how they taste cold. 
I used fresh pumpkin puree which i made by steaming the pumpkin a bit. I also did not use pie spice as i did not have any, i used some cinnamon powder, nutmeg powder and a pinch of clove powder. It took me a little more than 20 min to get well done muffins

these are delicious!  I added a full cup of pumpkin, reduced the amount of oil to 1/4c. + half of a 1/4c.
Added in more walnuts (which were almost ground) and raisins.  I also put in a little over a 1/4c. Bob's Red Mill golden Flax seed flour.  This ups the fiber and other health value.  They are perfect!

I am 90% vegan/10% vegetarian. Would totally make these again with these changes: agave nectar instead of honey, 1/4 c brown sugar (to make up for extra sweetness of agave) and egg replacer (1 TB ground flax + 3 TB water per egg; wisk together; allow to sit for 5-10 minutes; then use in place of egg).  So moist.

These are very nice! They came out moist and flavorful, almost like a cupcake rather than a muffin. I used whole wheat bread flour because it's what I had on hand, without ill effect. I used sliced almonds instead of walnuts due to a family allergy, and omitted the raisins because I didn't have any (although they would have tasted good and I wish I'd had them). I increased the pumpkin to a full cup for moisture and added 1/2 tsp cinnamon, 1/4 tsp nutmeg and 1/8 tsp each cloves and ginger.

These were great. I had to use dark brown sugar, but also added an extra teaspoon of spice. Left out the raisins and added an extra 1/4 cup of walnuts. Definitely a new family favorite!

Great muffins. I used the Pumpkin Pie Spice recipe instead of the store bought spice and added a dash of cloves. These are amazing. I will be freezing them for quick breakfast muffins. I also added 2 tbs ground flax seed to improve the health quality. These are excellent.

So easy and delicious.  I called it pumpkin walnut surprise, because I used semi sweet chocolate chips instead of raisins which was an unexpected treat!  Used only 1/4 cup oil with a single serving size of apple sauce.  Also used a full cup of canned pumpkin puree.  Note that this required additional cooking time.  Close to 30 minutes total.  These were a hit at work.  Thank you!

I love these and feel good about eating them. 
I did a cup of the pumpkin, added ginger and cinnamon, 1/4 c honey instead of 1/2 and 1/4 c oil and 1/4 cup applesauce..Not too sweet but moist.  I freeze them and keep them just for me with my a.m. coffee!  :)

I used this recipe as a guide but made some changes based on personal preference. I used finely chopped apples instead of raisins. I only used 1/4 cup of brown sugar instead of 1/2. I also substituted applesauce for the oil. They came out great! Taste hearty and are healthy!

These are awesome!  And so easy!  I did use 1 cup pumpkin and Epicure's Poudre Douce as I didn't have pumpkin pie spice.  Omitted the walnuts and used fresh cranberries instead of the raisins.  My husband said they were the best muffins I've ever made.  Next time I'll decrease the sugar and replace some of the oil with applesauce.  I think this could be a great base recipe with lots of possiblities for different variations.

I thought these were pretty good.  I baked them as mini donuts in my mini donut pan and passed them off as junk food to my kids.  They gobbled them up.  My one complaint was they were a little bland.

These turned out great for me. I did modify it to be vegan though as I had no eggs... Omitted the raisins, lessened the brown sugar to 1/3 cup, doubled all the spices, tripled the baking powder, added a full heaping cup of pumpkin, added in 1/3 apple sauce, took down the oil (olive) to 2 table spoons, no honey, added in 1/4 molasses, no walnuts either but I added a few dark chocolate chips so the kids would like them. I baked them in my mini muffin tin and served with a red fruit salad. Very nice.

I modified this recipe to be lower in carbs to fit my gestational diabetes diet. I used a whole can of pumpkin, omitted the raisins and honey, and added about 1 tsp vanilla. It doesn't satisfy the sweet tooth but it's a nice filling snack. Very forgiving recipe.

Family approved!  A very heavy muffin b/c of the whole wheat.  Definitely not for dessert after dinner, but a filling breakfast on it's own.  Add milk/juice & you're good to go.

yum! I wasn't expecting them to be so good. I doubled the recepie and used both honey and agave because I didn't have much of either. I didn't put the nut in, and used fresh pumpkin. Very light and not to heavy, I will definetly make them again!

I used some of other revewer's suggestions and did these changes: doubled the recipe so I could use a whole can of pumpkin, added half a cup of apple sauce, threw in some extra nutmeg and cinnamon, didn't double the sweeteners, eliminated raisins since my kids don't like them. I also like to fill my muffin cups to the top, so I ended up with 18 mufffins and cooked them a bit longer. They are very good. I already baked them twice and will continue using this recipe.

Great recipe!  Here's what I did to lower calories.  I made a double recipe with a cup of Splenda and a tablespoon of molasses for the brown sugar.  I used two cups of pumpkin from one I grew and cooked (wetter than canned).  I cut the honey in half.  Used half oil and half applesauce.  I only soaked half the raisins (did this by accident, don't know if it made a difference).  I did all the liquid in a blender and then mixed it with the dry ingredients.  Used paper cupcake cups sprayed with Pam.   These turned out almost perfect for my taste (even could cut down on sweetness and be happy).  The great thing about these is that they freeze great and don't dry out like some other things baked with Splenda.  This worked for me....Hope it helps someone else!  Craig

Delicious, light and fluffy.  Wow!  I did not have pumpkin pie mix, so I used cinnamon, nutmeg and allspice instead (about 3/4 tsp of each), AND I used fresh pumkin, which I blended with all the wet ingredients.  I also used chocolate chips, instead.  Great muffins.  I will make again, for sure.

Husband loved it.  Omitted raisins, had no pumpkin pie spice so used cinnamon and nutmeg instead, 1 full can of the pumpkin puree, instead of oil used applesauce, and some oatmeal.  Yummmm...

These were surprisingly good.  I love sweetening w/ honey instead of sugar!  It's a keeper :)

I made a few changes based on what I had on hand - used 1/4 cup pumpkin and 3/4 cup squash, 1/4 cup veg oil 1/4 cup applesauce and added choc chips instead of nuts and raisins.  These were delicious and easy in the food processor.  Love the hint of honey flavor but may cut down a bit next time.  Thanks for a great recipe!

wonderful!  The net time I will double it, as my can of pumpkin was too big for the recipe.  I don't think that I have seen one smaller either...but maybe I have never really looked!  Delicious!  Took exactly  the 18 minutes too.

great recipe.  made muffins, mini-muffins, and bread and they all turned out wonderfully!  canola oil was fine, and ended up using a little less oil, sugar, and honey which was really fine as well!

These muffins are awesome!  My kids really love them and they are super healthy!  The only change I made to the recipe was using 1/4 cup unsweetened applesauce and 1/4 cup oil.  They are very moist and great to make for the fall time or really anytime of the year!  I give them six stars!!!!!!!!!

I meant to make these with the 1c of pumpkin suggested by the other reviewers and totally forgot...  as a result they WERE kind of bland.  Next time I'll increase the pumpkin and spices.  I subbed half the oil with applesauce, used white whole wheat flour, and craisins instead of raisins and the texture was great.  Definitely a recipe I'll be tweaking and keeping.

I used the whole can of pumpkin (15 oz) because I hate having just a little of something left over that can't be used for anything else -and they turned out GREAT!! I figured, if you can substitute part applesauce for the oil, why not extra pumpkin? I'm glad it worked! From my research, both canola and vegetable oil are awful for you, so I used 1/4 cup of melted butter instead. The only other change I made was adding a bit more baking soda, so help with the extra pumpkin. I also followed others' advice by using cinnamon, ginger, and cloves (about 1/2 tsp of each -maybe more cinn.) instead of the pumpkin spice.

Good recipe, but not nearly as wholesome as one might think - so I made some changes to make it a bit healthier. I replaced the oil with 1/2 c. unsweetened applesauce and cut the brown sugar to 1/4 cup.  Turned out great.

Great recipe! 

I wouldn't go so far as to call it healthy, given the amount of sugar and oil but it sure is a tasty way to bake with wholewheat flour. The muffins rose really well and, unlike my previous experiences with w/w flour in baking, the  texture of them is really light and fluffy. The only change I made was to use  butternut squash (pumpkins can be hard to come by in England and canned pumpkin is only available in expensive stores specialising in American ingredients)- I boiled it and used a whole cup of the well drained puree.  

My husband was overly keen on the honey taste but I think that has more to do with the kind of honey I used - it has quite a strong taste. Next time, I will look out for a milder variety to use in baking. 

I will definitely be making these again! Thanks for the recipe.

I thought these were good, and took them to work and they were all eaten.  They don't really taste sweet or pumpkin-y, so if that is what you want, keep looking.  They are sort of bran muffin like, so if you can deal with that you might like them.  I did use a full cup of pumpkin like other reviewers.  I didn't use walnuts--didn't have them-but would probably be great with them too.

Great recipe.  I made some pretty significant changes though.  I used applesauce for the oil, no salt, 1/2 of the sugar called for and added 3/4 cup mashed banana.  They had wonderful flavor and were very moist.  The kids loved them.

These are AWESOME!!!  Thank G-d these are  "healthy as I just ate four.  I did up the pumpkin to 1 full cup and I also added 1 scoop of soy protein powder to sneak in more protein and fiber.  The plump raisens are wonderful (and I ommitted the walnuts for my husband).  These will absolutely be made again and again.

I've made them 3 or four times, omitting the raisins and walnuts, and they turned out great.  I did have to bake them longer than 18 minutes, but that could be just a difference in ovens.  Thanks for the low sugar recipe!

Muffins came out very sweet, tasty and light (ate while still warm).  I doubled the recipe and had enough batter to fill 24 muffin tins to the top. I omitted the nuts, and instead of pumpkin pie spice (I didn't have any), I used ginger, nutmeg, cinnamon and allspice. I also baked for 5 extra minutes. I used paper liners in one muffin pan and sprayed the  other muffin pan with cooking spray. The ones without liners cooked better.

Made these into Mini Muffins and used mini chocolate chips instead of raisins, applesauce instead of oil.  They were very good; moist, but fluffy.  They were much sweeter than my usual muffins, so next time I may try half the sugar and honey, just my personal preference though.  My husband and kids devoured them :)

I love this recipe.  They are moist and flavorful.  I did not use wheat flour, but regular flour.  I had to add a little more time baking them to get them done.  They were excellent, and not a lot of sugar.  My husband loved them.

Excellent and extra moist with 1.25 cups fresh pumpkin while going a bit easy on the sugar and honey.  Also works great with craisins!

I made this exactly as the recipe describes, except I just eyeballed the "pie spice" using ginger, cinnamon, clove, and nutmeg and I used fresh pie pumpkin instead of canned. They were very tasty. Next time I will add a few more raisins and walnuts. I will definitely make these again. They didn't have a strong pumpkin flavor, but still great!

This was yummy and felt it was a healthy muffin overall.  I ran out of oil and ended up substituting applause, which made less fat an it was still very good.  I personally think it needs the nuts or might try mini chips or raisens next time.

Good muffins! I used a whole can of pumpkin puree (didn't measure it so I have no idea if it's closer to 3/4 or 1 cup), didn't have pumpkin spice so came up with my own concoction of ground cloves, cinnamon, ginger, allspice, nutmeg. Very nice taste! Mine didn't rise much and kind of kept a lumpy looking shape. They are a bit chewy, but moist so no major complaints. Perfect sweetness in this recipe with the 1/2 honey, 1/2 brown sugar. Overall a great muffin, I will definitely be making them again.

Considering the healthier alternatives in this recipe (ww flour, honey to replace some of the sugar-and I used applesauce instead of oil) I think they turned out pretty good. Of course they certainly don't taste the same as some of the other pumpkin muffin recipes I've made recently that are full of fat and sugar. But I'm glad I made them and may use this recipe again in the future when wanting a healthier treat.

Perfect. I was looking for a pumpkin recipe I could use with my carrot pulp from making carrot juice. I used one cup of it, thinking it might be dry. I working. Good thing, 'cause I juice a lot of carrots.

These were great, my 5 year old loved them, and other than banana he doesn't like muffins much.  I made these with half whole wheat and half almond flour.  This worked out very well.  I also used applesauce rather than oil and didn't use any brown sugar (added a couple tablespoons of honey and extra cinnamon).  Not that there was anything wrong with this recipe, I just didn't have those ingredients on hand.  Even with some impromptu modifications, it was a great recipe, thanks for sharing!

These are so yummy. I added 1 cup of pumpkin and 1.5 teaspoons pumpkin spice, and subbed apple sauce for oil. They took much longer to cook for me, but are super moist and very tasty. Did not add raisins.

Ah-ma-zing! Thank you so much for posting this recipe! I do not eat wheat, but I substitute gluten-free flour for regular flour. These muffins turned out perfectly! My only complaint? They are TOO good! I've had 3 already!! I'm going to have to freeze them so that I don't finish the batch today!
For those making a GF version: I also followed other reviewers' advice and put in 1 cup of pumpkin, applesauce instead of oil. Other than that, I used a cup-for-cup substitute of GF flour. Yummmm!!

Very yummy!  I used Splenda/brown sugar mix and applesauce instead of vegetable oil.  I also used 1/2 cup quinoa flour in addition to one cup whole wheat flour since I had some, and 1/2 tsp more pumpkin pie spice than the recipe called for.  Used other recommendations to use 1 cup pumpkin purée and filled cupcake tin to the top.  So delicious warm and I don't feel horrible feeding them to my kids!  Thanks!

These were not overwhelming in spice as other pumpkin products.  These were light sweet and fluffy.  The honey wheat is a nice mix with the pumpkin.

Instead of a half cup of oil, I used apple sauce. I also used a whole cup of pumpkin as others have suggested.  I want to add Dom ginger next time.  Very moist and yummy!

Delicious, Especially when chocolate chips are used in place of the raisins. Good enough to satisfy a sweets craving for sure! I used half canola oil and half applesauce, heaping cup of pumpkin, and added a t. cinnamon along with the pumpkin spice. I also dumped in a couple Tablespoons of ground flax seed. Moist, healthy and so tasty.

These are the BEST muffins I have ever made.  I'd been looking for a good whole wheat flour recipe to make a healthier muffin, and this recipe is wonderful.  I used about 1/4-1/2 t each of cinnamon, nutmeg and ginger instead of pumpkin pie spice.  I used more pumpkin puree, about 8 oz.  I followed another reviewer's suggestion and replace half the oil with applesauce.  A couple days later, the muffins are still so moist and delicious!!

Wonderful moist muffin! Not too sweet. Just right for breakfast. I made some changes because I was feeding them to my 1 year old - omitted the honey, substituted 10 drops of liquid stevia and 1/4 c. whole milk. Also omitted one egg (I was out) and the nuts.

Yummy! Left raisins & walnuts out, per personal preference. Plan to make another batch today (first batch yesterday) and use less oil. Would be delish using a flour blend I've used in the past: equal parts wheat flour, ground flax seeds and ground oats.

These came out very good! I didn't have pumpkin, and cooked and mashed a sweet potato instead! I also left out the raisins, I am making them for a preschooler snack. The only other change I made was instead of half a cup of honey, I used half honey and half molasses. I baked them in mini muffin tins, and it took about 9 1/2 minutes for them to bake. Thanks! I will definitely make these again.

Amazing muffins! With a golden sugar crust and a warm, moist crumb.  Go wheat free and use spelt flour instead - they're really healthy and just as tasty!

Great muffins! Did what others suggested and used 1c pumpkin and more spices. Substituted chocolate chips 1/2c but could have got away with 1/4c. Decreased sugar to 1/4c, next time I will cut it out and just go with the honey.

I made these last minute for Thanksgiving. I didn't add the raisins or nuts though so the kids would eat them too. They were a hit!! I did cook them for about 20 minutes though but, i have an electric oven. I will be making these on a regular basis :-)

These were great and so moist!  I don't like raisins so I completely omitted them and I was running low on honey so I only used about 1/4 cup. I think that next time I may use only 1/4 brown sugar because these were a little sweet. Other than that these were just perfect and kept very well.

I love this recipe!  I've made it as written and it was very good, but with changes suggested by other reviewers they are wonderful!  I increased the amount and variety of spices, added additional pumpkin and cut back on the oil, used 1/4 cup molasses and 1/4 cup honey, and used 1/2 cup of flax meal in place of 1/2 cup of flour.  I also used egg substitute.  I hope there are some left when I get home from work!!

I took everyone's advice and added extra pumpkin and pumpkin pie spice. And I omitted the nuts because I don't like them and added a little more raisins. They were delicious and I had everything on hand! My 4 year old helped me make them and she loved them! The texture is a little different than other muffins, so I thought they weren't getting done at first but then I stuck a knife in one and it came out clean. That's when I realized they were just denser than I thought they would be, not fluffy really. But I don't mind that. I feel a lot better serving it to my kids than most muffins! I'd bet they would be really good with chocolate chips.

Made these muffins today....yummy! Skipped the raisins and used maple syrup because I did not have the honey. Also subsitituted the pumpkin pie spice with nutmeg, cinnamon and cloves. Very velvety and moist texture. I also used fresh pumpkin from the kids jack o lanterns!

These went over very well!  I replaced 1/2 c. of WW flour with 1/2 c. of wheat germ and upped the pumpkin pie spice to 2 tsps.  I also omitted the raisins and walnuts (allergic).  Great muffins, and easy recipe to play with.

I made this recipe this afternoon... DELICIOUS!   I added 1 cup of pumpkin as some other reviewers suggested.  The only other change I made was adding mini chocolate chips instead of raisins because currently I am out of them.  The muffins are super moist and flavorful.  I will make this again for holiday brunches.

I was not overly impressed with this recipe.   I have done a lot of baking/cooking (for 40 years).   I love to try new recipes.   This one was a little flat.   Maybe more spice is needed and I did not have raisins, but added extra walnuts (baked and sweetened ahead with a little maple syrup on top of stove).   This gets rid of the strong taste of walnut.  Still did not do it for my family.   I always share new recipes, etc.   but doubt this one will make the grade.  Lisa

I halved the sugar & honey, added oats, and used cinnamon & ground cloves instead of pumpkin spice. I also was generous with the pumpkin.  Turned out quite nice :)

Yay, whole wheat pumpkin muffins! There were delicious! I also used a whole cup of pumpkin and extra spices. I also added a tablespoon of flax seeds and a small chopped apple, and took out a couple tablespoons of sweetener.

Followed recipe except increased pumpkin to 1 cup and left out raisins- these are so dense, not at all muffin like. After the first batch I added a bit of extra flour to see if it would help, and it did but only a little. Not a bad flavor, but not the light fluffy muffin I wanted.

My kids thought the hole wheat flour made them a little too "crunchy" but when we doubled the pumpkin we liked them better!

Delicious and satisfying.  Made these with several of the other reviewers suggestions- used 1 tsp ginger & cinnamon, 1/2 tsp allspice and nutmeg since I didn't have pumpkin pie spice. I also only used 1/4 c. oil- and added 1/2 cup applesauce. Used the honey even though I don't like it that much but it isn't overpowering- neither is the whole wheat flour despite being used alone. Just the right amount of moist sweetness with the raisins.  Really enjoyable - a great recipe which I'll make again soon.

Loved this recipe! This are the small changes I made. I substituted olive oil for veg., used 1tsp cinnamon, 1tsp allspice, and 1/4 nutmeg. I also used 1/4 cup agave nectar instead of the 1/2 cup honey. Will definitely double recipe next time! so easy to make I made a second batch right away! 5 stars!!

Great recipe for low carb diet. I added more spice and full cup of pumpkin and split the sugar 1/2 brown and 1/2 sugar/splenda blend. Also added 1/4  of whey protien which made them light and fluffy. Very glad to have all the options in the reviews.

I had a sugar pumkin with some puree left over and decided to make this recipe. The muffins are so delicious that they are almost gone just a few hours later. My husband does not like raisins so I omitted them and honestly do not miss them at all. They were so quick and easy to make I'm sure I'll be making regularly this fall.

This was my first try at a homemade muffin and it was good! I was ecxited to try a whole wheat flour recipe and love the flavor of pumpkin.  I substituted half of the oil with applesauce and replaced one of the eggs with egg substitute to cut the fat. The recipe was still great. Very moist crumbs!  I think a light cream cheese glaze would be a great finishing touch if you want to splurge! I baked for about 20 mins.

These were very good!  Listen, if you don't like dense/wheat/honey type things, then you probably won't like these either... they ARE what the name says... LOL.  I subbed in all applesauce for the oil and upped the pumpkin and spices, and they were so moist and yummy, and amazingly healthy.  (to me 4 stars means GREAT, 5 means the absolute BEST, these are GREAT)

Moist.  I would use butter instead of oil to make them richer tasting.  Cut the pumpkin pie spice II on this website down to 1 tsp:  1/2 tsp cinnamon, 1/8 tsp nutmeg, 1/8 teaspoon ginger, and 1/16 teaspoon cloves.  Used raising, no walnuts.  Another recommendation is to top them with a brown sugar/oats crumble.  Probably won't make again.

AMAZING! Some changes I made: white instead of wheat flour. I didn't have any pumpkin spice so I used 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon, 1/4 teaspoons each of allspice and ginger. I omitted the raisins and walnuts, just because I'm not a huge fan. I had a huge muffin tin as well and this recipe made 6 big muffins and they cooked for around 28 minutes. I will make them again!

These are fantastic!! I made them with half of the honey the second time around because they were to sweet and also added wheat germ and flax seed. They did need to bake for about 10 minutes longer than recommended.  I can't stop making them.

These were very tasty! I used 1 tsp. cinnamon, 1/2 tsp. cloves, and 1/2 tsp. nutmeg in place of the pumpkin pie spice which worked out fine. I think  you could cut back on the sugar a bit... but otherwise really good.

Great recipe!!  I mistakenly read the pumpkin part as "3/4 can of pumpkin" so I probably added close to a cup and half, and it didn't matter.  Made them nice and moist!  I also added about a cup  of gloden raisins / raisins / cranberries and a good cup of chopped, roasted walnuts.  Very delicious and I LOVE that it is a whole wheat recipe.   I bet you could cut the brown sugar down even more and they would still be sweet enough.  Thanks for sharing!

Ok, I know it's not fall, but I had the perfect amount of pumpkin leftover from making "Irresistible Double Chocolate Muffins" to make these.  These are very good muffins.  I like the wheat texture and the mingling of flavors.  I used a full 1 cup of pumpkin and 2 tsp. of pumpkin spice (my own blend).  I didn't add the walnuts, and I think I like them that way.  I ended up baking them for 22 minutes.  I'm glad I added that extra tsp. of spice!  Very flavorful!

Great tasty holiday treat. I went a bit crazy and made a lot of substitutions and changes. I doubled the pumpkin, added 1/4 cup oats, replaced the walnuts with almonds, and subbed the pumpkin pie spice with 1 tsp cinnamon, 1/2 tsp cloves, 1/2 tsp nutmeg, and 1/2 tsp ginger. This was a great way to use up my leftover pumpkin from Thanksgiving baking. The moistness is terrific.

One of the best investments I EVER made is a $2.00 heavy duty ice cream scoop... makes it a cinch to fill muffin cups, so these yummy muffins are quite pretty! In fact, they look as good as they taste (no small feat, that), and when you use dried cranberries for the raisins...MMMM!

These hit the spot. I used 1C. pumpkin and 2C. whole wheat flour and baked them for 22 minutes. Cinnamon was also added and I left out the raisins. They are so good! My friend said that they would be good with cream cheese icing but I was trying to keep it "healthy." Very moist and satisfying. Thank you!

This was an immediate hit with the whole family! A shock when the husband got mad at me for eating the last one since it is a whole wheat flower recipe. We had made several batches of these and I never have all the ingredients on hand, but some things I found worked really well was replacing the oil completely with applesauce, craisins instead of raisins (the tang plays off the pumpkin very nicely), we double the fruit and delete the nuts (some nut haters in my family) and the first batch was with some leftover fresh pumpkin and the canned is not quite as good (but how often do you have fresh pumpkin around!). Ok, off to make another batch!

I made these without raisins and walnuts (didn't have them handy) and they turned out great.  My husband and kids ate them up quickly.  Will make again.

I used recipe for 24 muffins. I added extra raisins, used 1 3/4 cups fresh pumpkin puree, 3/4 cup coconut oil instead of vegetable oil, added 1 tsp vanilla, extra cinammon, 1 cup spelt and 2 cups wheat flour. It was amazing! I felt like I was eating mini pumpkin pies. We're going to use this w/ cream cheese icing for my daughter's 1st birthday party in a couple weeks. Yummy!!

They are wonderful:) Just wanted to let you know I just made these muffins and didn't have raisins so I replaced the raisins with craisins and I also used 1 cup of pumpkin. (I love pumpkin)   I am having company this Fall weekend and will be happy to serve these muffins.  God Bless.

I was scared when other users said to put in the whole can of pumpkin instead of just one cup, but I did it anyways and these came out perfect!!!  I used extra spice cause I really like pumpkin pie spice, these muffins were moist and yummy.  I'll make these again and again.

These turned out moist and yummy. I did make some substitutions: for half of the oil I used apple sauce; for the pumkin pie spice I used cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger, and allspice; for raisins I used chocolate chips; and for nuts I used granola that had a blend of nuts in it. I ended up with 17 muffins.

Awesome!!  I was looking for something healthy to do with some pumpkin I had and this was perfect.  Not one bit of white flour!!  Great! So moist and the perfect amount of sweetness.  Shared the recipe with my sister and now she makes them all the time.

This was a hit with me and my husband.  Couldn't even tell there was wheat in them.  I substituted canned pumpkin puree with homemade pumpkin puree and raisins with chocolate chips.

I've been looking for a good recipe for pumpkin muffins, and I've found it!  These turned out moist and delicious.

I skipped the raisins bc we don't like them, and I used a whole can of pumpkin--I never know what to do with the little bit that is left over.  I also used cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger and cloves as another poster suggested instead of the pumpkin pie spice since I don't buy that.

These turned out fantastic, and I was so excited about using whole wheat flour.

I made a few alterations based on ingredients I had...or didn't have...& these came out GREAT!  1st...I added a full cup of pumpkin.  Didn't have any pumpkin pie spice, so I added 3/4 tsp cinnamon, 1/4 tsp nutmeg & pinch of ground cloves.  I didn't have any raisins or walnuts, so, to jazz them up a bit, I made a topping for them instead.  I mixed together 1/2 cup sugar, 1/3 cup flour, 1/4 cup butter & 1 1/2 tsp cinnamon....sprinkled over top.  Baked for about 22 mins.  These were good hot & good cold!  Thanks for the base to a recipe that's fun to play with!

These moist pumpkin muffins are yummy and easy to freeze! My daycare kids love them and so do I. The recipe calls for pumpkin pie spice, but I use 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon and 1/4 teaspoon each of ginger and cloves, as another reviewer mentioned. To make them a bit more kid friendly, I have not tried them with the raisins and walnuts. Also, I just use 1/2 of a 15-oz can of pumpkin for one recipe. Swapping out the vegetable oil with unsweetened applesauce is also a good minor change to make if you prefer. I do not use liners and these turn out moist and a tad sticky. For me, one recipe yields 45 mini muffins or 15 regular sized. I use a cookie scoop to divide out the batter evenly.

Yes!  Really delicious!  Realized I didn't have any raisins after I had already mixed this up, but they still tasted great.  I used pecans instead of walnuts, 1/3 cup honey, and 1/2 tsp cinnamon, 1/4 tsp cloves, 1/4 tsp ginger in place of the pumpkin pie spice.  Perfect sweetness and spice.  Oh, also used a full cup of pumpkin puree and 1/4 cup apple sauce with 1/4 cup vegetable oil.  Perfection!

Made a double batch and cut the sweetness by cutting out the sugar (went with only the honey instead).  Also used fresh pumpkin puree.  

This made 12 big muffins.

These turned out really moist and tasty.  I went with what others' suggested and used 1 cup of the pumpkin puree, but I think 3/4 cup would have been better.  I can't eat raisins so I substituted 3/4 cups of chocolate chips instead.

A very simple recipe that allows for adapting to your own taste and preference, It was even better the second time I made.
I was out of honey so I used maple syrup instead.  And instead of allspice used more cinnamon, nutmeg, a little clove and ginger.  I love those flavors so I wanted MORE.  Kids gobbled 'em up so my toughest critics approved!

These muffins are wonderful! I especially loved that they are one bowl. Because we don’t have pumpkin pie spice I used a little cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger, and cloves and they taste delicious.I also put in slightly less sugar than the recipe called for.

I make a lot of muffins for my picky kids and these were among the best. I went a little short on the sugar and we didn’t miss it at all. My 4 year old daughter loved the pecans. But don’t get me wrong - adults loved them as well. These are worthy of a special brunch with foodie friends.

Substituted applesauce for the oil and used ~2 tsp white sugar instead of 1/2c brown. Used a little over 1c of pumpkin puree and added a dash of cinnamon. Mini-muffins took 13 minutes. Made some without nuts or raisins and my very picky 2 year old scarfed 2 down immediately. Made others with pecans and topped with crystalized ginger and they were fantastic! These are a little bland without nuts or raisins. Try crystalized ginger! It makes a huge difference.

This is a great recipe! I made it accidentally with 3/4 can of pumpkin, instead of 3/4 cup but they were delicious and moist. I also sautéed the walnuts in butter and a little maple syrup on the stove before I added them to the mixture. I didn't have pumpkin pie seasoning, so instead used cinnamon, ginger, allspice, and nutmeg. Loved it!

I cut back the sugar to 1.5 T, cut oil to .25 cup eliminated the honey, and added .5 cup water.

Really good!  I took the brown sugar down to 1/4 cup and did 1/4 c oil, 1/4 c applesauce instead of all the oil.  My kids love em!

Absolutely loved these! I give only 4 * because, the way it's written, they're too sweet. Omit the sugar altogether. Just the honey called for is enough. I was looking for a recipe for my leftover squash (butternut). This was perfect. I did use a few drops of vanilla, and had to make up my own pumpkin pie spice (cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg). I blended all the wet ingredients in a NutriBullet first. I only use sprouted spelt flour and it didn't affect the consistency. These were so moist. I don't know how anyone can say they're dry. Definitely making them again.

I followed the recipe exactly. I served it with bonnie's fruit dip (from this site) and my kids thought they were eating candy. I knew it was  a great recipe when my anti-whole grain anti-squash husband said they were delish----never even suspecting healthy things were hidden inside.

Love this recipe! It's not too sweet and not cake-like. The only change I made was to add a teaspoon of cinnamon because our family likes that flavour. Thanks so much for a great recipe!

I used 1/2 cup of natural applesauce and decreased the oil to 1/4 cup.  As others suggested, I used a heaping cup of pumpkin.  With the increased liquid level, these did take longer to bake, probably an additional 6 minutes.  The outcome, a very moist and healthy muffin.  I will make these again.

I love adding dark chocolate chips.

Worked perfectly with fresh pumpkin from the garden. Love that it calls for whole wheat flour (and it wasn't heavy at all- light and fluffy). Perfectly spiced and sweetened.

These tasted really good but the texture was a bit strange. I think it was the pumpkin. The next time I made these, I used the leftover mix from making pumpkin pies, and it turned out a lot better, texture-wise. Otherwise, very good, moist enough and filling.

Pretty good. Kids liked them too. Good thing I seriously heaped the pumpkin pie spice or these would not have had much flavor. I might even add in some ground clove next time.

Absolutely delicious. I subbed a few things to cut a few calories, like 1/4 cup more honey for all of the brown sugar and 1/4 cup apple sauce and 1/4 cup Canola Oil for the Veggy Oil. Definitely making these again.

I accidentally forgot the vegetable oil for half and they still came out good, the other half (2 batches) I added applesauce instead and they came out even better. I used less honey than called for and I bet you could use bananas and less sugar for a healthier version.

These were good. I chopped the walnuts finely and added an entire 15oz can sweet potato puree. I also added about a tsp and half of pumpkin pie spice and left out the raisins. Last I added about 1/4c quick cooking oatmeal. I was pretty bummed because after I put them in the oven I realized I forgot to add the oil. Turns out these were still good without it. I made mini muffins baked at 350 for about 20 mins. Made about 30 of these when the muffin tin was filled to brim before baking.

So yummy  and seemingly foolproof and I am typically unsuccessful at my muffin endeavours.  Combined the advice of a few using cinnamon, cloves and nutmeg instead of the pumpkin pie spice, used 1/4 c apple sauce and 1/4 c canola oil instead of 1/2 c veg oil, omitted the walnuts in favor of chocolate chips and used 1 c of pumpkin puree instead of 3/4 c.... PERFECT!

Great base recipe. I did use all of the honey but replaced the brown sugar with stevia to reduce overall sugar. I used a cup of cooked fresh pumpkin from our jack-o-lanterns. :) I added some quick oats for a bit of texture. Ran out of oil, so I used melted butter. Oh, and I added about 1/2 teaspoon vanilla.

These are healthy and fantastic! I used homemade puree from our garden pumpkins (and bumped it up to one cup as suggested), tripled the cinnamon, and added 1/8 c of bran. The kids and hubby love them! They are moist and fluffy at the same time....an odd combination that totally works!

My batch of muffins came out perfect!  They were very flavorful and moist.  I followed the recipe as is except I used coconut oil instead of vegetable oil.  Careful not to overbake- I probably baked them for 19 minutes and used a toothpick to test doneness.   I think if you wait until the "top springs back when lightly touched" it might be too late. This has been added to my favorites!

I doubled this recipe and used an entire can of pumpkin (15 oz). Substituted 1 small mashed banana for one of the eggs,  1/2 cup apple sauce in place of 1/2 cup oil, skipped the raisins and used pecans instead of walnuts.  Delicious!!  Even the teenagers loved them.

I loved the flavor of these. I followed others' online advice and used 1 cup of pumpkin instead of the 3/4 Cup. I also didn't have honey but subbed organic Blue Agave I had on hand (subbed according to Epicurious.com)
I also used replace vegetable oil with Walnut oil I had on hand. And I used pecans in place of walnuts (I thought I had all the needed ingredients and found I did not after I began the mess making.)
I followed Epicurious' instructions for subbing the agave- which stated to lower the oven 25 degrees and increase cook time. When I filled the muffin pan it actually made 15. The 3 extra muffins actually raised better (in emptier muffin tin), which tells me they liked the hotter temperature. I am planning a 2nd batch right now , while I have the messy kitchen, and plan to NOT lower the oven temp even though I will use Agave. I also plan to sub dried cherries to this batch for a change.

I made these but I didn't have enough whole wheat flour so I used 3/4 c whole wheat and 3/4 c white flour. I omitted the raisins and used chocolate chips (1 Cup). I used 1 cup pumpkin and added another 1/2 tsp cinnamon. They were so moist and tender. I will make these again. Fall and pumpkin just go together. Yum.

These were delicious!  My 4 and 1 year olds loved them too!  The only change I made was to use 1 full cup of pumpkin.  They are moist, flavorful, and a little addictive!  I will definitely be making these again!

These are a staple in my house - they never last long. The kids devour them, and love helping me make them. I double the recipe and use a full can of pumpkin. Also skip the raisins and substitute the oil for apple sauce or coconut oil, or a combination of the two. Delicious!

Soooo good!  I doubled this recipe because I wanted to use an entire 15 oz can of pumpkin.  I plan to freeze half of the 20 full size muffins....if they last long enough!  I followed the recipe except I substituted unsweetened applesauce for the oil.  I also used half maple syrup half honey because I ran out of honey.  Some of the best muffins I have ever made.

Delightful!  As in very light in texture for wheat & pleasant to taste! We separate the batter 3 ways & put butterscotch chips in 1/3, semi sweet chocolate in another & walnut & raisin in the last.  ALL were yummy!  Also increased pumpkin to 1 cup.  Finally I made a mistake & used pumpkin pie mix pumpkin instead of 100% whole but it didn't matter!

Delicious and healthy! I made several substitutions:
used 1 cup of pumpkin instead of 3/4 cup, 1/2 cup unsweet. ap sauce instead of oil, 1/4 cup of quinoa flour instead of 1/4 ww flour, pecans instead of walnuts, agave syrup instead of honey (didn't have any on hand), no raisins, and halved the sugar amount. Turned out light tasty and not too sweet.

Like some others,  I added a full cup of pumpkin and instead of allspice I added a tsp of cinnamon, a half tsp of ginger and a half tsp of nutmeg. I left out the raisins and added pecans. I made 6 large muffins instead of 12 so I had to bake them about 5 minutes longer.  They were absolutely delicious!

This has worked well for me with gluten-free brown rice flour and added xanthum gum (3/4 tsp per cup of flour for quick breads). I also used agave nectar. Just love how moist they are. My husband who expects gluten-free to be dry did not know they were!

I followed the recipe amounts with fresh squash (cushaw) and I thought they were fine with that amount.

Try chocolate!  This muffin recipe is great with chocolate chips.  Rather than the 1/2 cup raisins and 1/2 nuts, I used a whole cup of chocolate chips.  I never thought chocolate and pumpkin sounded good together and then I tried it at a party...yum!  I came to this recipe with the specific hope of finding something I could modify for chocolate chips.  :)  Also, coconut oil in place of vegetable oil and maple syrup instead of honey both make great replacements.  I decided to try them as they are the ingredients I keep on hand.  Lastly, I've used flour and whole wheat flour.  Both turn out well, just different.  As would be expected, the whole wheat just has a heartier taste.

This recipe is very good.  I love how healthy it is, and I even amped that up a little further by substituting applesauce for all of the oil, as well as flax seed for one of the eggs (which was mostly because of a shortage of eggs).  Like others, I used a full cup of pumpkin, and I substituted individual spices (cinnamon 1tsp, nutmeg 3/4 tsp, cloves 1/2 tsp, allspice 1/2 tsp) instead of pumpkin spice.  Finally, I used pecans instead of walnuts because they were what I had on hand.  Made half of this into mini muffins, which made 24, and then 6 regular muffins.  YUM!

I made these just as written and they were great. The cooking time was increased by 5 minutes.  You would never know they were 100% whole wheat.  I made a second batch subbing half of the oil with applesauce.  The cooking time was spot on with that adjustment.
~Update: I made this again only a little more heart healthy.
I substituted 4 egg whites. Reduced the sweetener to 1/4 C of brown sugar and 1/4 C of honey. I always use at least 3/4 c raisins.  Plenty sweet and wonderfully moist.  For mini muffins reduce cooking time to about 13 minutes.

These muffins are easy to make and my husband says they're delicious! I made one batch with whole wheat flour following the recipe for him. I made a second with half the sugar and used King Arthur gluten free all purpose flour for me. Being gluten intolerant I sometimes feel cheated — not this time. This is a great fall recipe, definitely a keeper!

These are really good! I made a double batch and followed the directions exactly, except that I didn't have any pumpkin pie spice on hand so I improvised with nutmeg, ground cloves, ginger, and cinnamon. The flavor is good. They do taste a little "healthy" because of the whole wheat flour, but I think that's a good thing and makes them perfect for breakfast as well as dessert. The real test will be to see what my toddler thinks of them tomorrow. If he likes them this will definitely be a keeper since I am sure they would freeze well.

I was really surprised how good these were! Very moist and tender and Yummy!  I sub'ed unsweetened applesauce for the oil (Hint-I keep the snack cups of it just for baking, one cup is 1/2 cup applesauce. I added some vanilla and more cinnamon, and the extra pumpkin as others suggested.

As written, didn't think these were so great. The did 1 c. White flour and 1/2c. Whole wheat flour and that made all the difference! Also added a 2T. Applesauce and 1/4 t. Cinnamon.

Excellent! Toddlers were to eat them so instead of unpasteurized honey, I used maple syrup and I replaced walnuts by chia seeds.

Really great tasting muffin!  I too used 1cup pumpkin per batch, and used 1tsp cinnamon, 1/2 tsp ginger and 1/2 tsp cloves instead of pumpkin pie spice.  My 11yo son loves them too.  Tripled the recipe and froze a bunch.

We loved these muffins! I ground soft white wheat and oat groats (because I ran out of wheat), added some extra spices - cinnamon (3/4 t),  and a 1/4 t each of allspice, nutmeg, and ginger. I used a heaping cup of squash that I had baked and frozen - I was worried that this would be too wet, but it turned out just fine - I did have to bake for *much* longer (10-15 minutes, extra). We used chocolate chips instead of raisins. Yum. I will definitely make these again. I think the sugar could be cut back on a bit, so I'll try that next time.

Amazing! I didn't put raisins or walnuts in there but i added a couple teaspoons of wheat germ and flax seed. I also made a oat crumble for the top combining  oats, brown sugar and melted butter. They tasted store bought!

These were very easy to make and the kids and husband loved them.  They were quite moist and just sweet enough.  I followed the recipe as written.  We will add these to the muffin rotation :)

These were good, but a little too sweet. I followed the recipe but omitted the raisins and walnuts. I imagine if I had added raisins the muffins would have been even sweeter. I'll make these again, but next time I'll use a little less brown sugar and honey.

I had some pumpkin leftovers so I thought to give this recipe a try. Well, these are FANTASTIC. Moist and flavorful, but still fluffy and yummy. I followed the recipe exactly, except that I used white flour by mistake, and mixed light brown and dark brown sugar. I had no spice mix so I used 1/2 tsp cinnamon, 1/4 tsp ginger, 1/4 nutmeg, and a dash of ground allspice. Also, I didn't have any walnuts, so I substituted with chopped hazelnuts, and with all these adjustments they still turned out wonderful. The baking time is 100% right, I took them out the second they were done and left them to cool down in the pan. I wish I could give this recipe 6 stars.

These muffins were excellent. This was my variation on the recipe:

1) I substituted canola oil for vegetable oil to cut down on fat 
2) I added 2 tablespoons of ground flaxseed meal for extra fiber and Omega 3's
3) I used a whole cup of pumpkin puree to make up for the addition of flaxseed meal and for added moistness

One could also use a 1/2 cup egg substitute in place of the 2 eggs called for in the recipe.  This will reduce fat content even further and eliminate cholesterol.

Very easy and delicious recipe. I decreased the sugar and honey to 1/4 c. each and it was plenty sweet. I added 1 tsp. vanilla and used ground walnuts instead for those (little kids) who don't like chunks in their muffins but need the nutrition.

Such an easy recipe!  The muffins turned out moist and flavourful.

I changed the recipe slightly to suit my tastes: 1 full cup of pumpkin pie filling (and then omitted the pumpkin pie spice); added 1 tsp of cinnamon; swapped the raisins for dried dates; reduced the sugar to 1/4 cup (as the dates added sweetness); and swapped the honey for maple syrup (the real stuff, not aunt jemima).

My next batch will use coconut oil instead of vegetable oil - yum!

I had to bake the batch for approx 23 minutes to ensure they were done.

These are freaking amazing but I followed some recommendations from other reviewers.  I followed the recipe but added a big dash of cinnamon and a dash of nutmeg on top of the pumpkin pie spice.  I did homemade pumpkin puree and did a cup from what I froze last fall (I froze in 1 c portions for pumpkin pancakes, cookies, etc).  Instead of oil I did 1/2 c apple sauce (from the store but it's apples and ascorbic acid only (Vitamin c-I get the "all natural" "no sugar added" kind always or make my own).  I didn't do the walnuts because we're allergic but instead did 1/2 c chocolate chips.  When you eat them after they've cooled just a bit the raisins and chocolate chips are kind of melted in to the muffin.  These are seriously TO DIE FOR and I think the amount of spices I used perfectly enhanced the flavor.  GO MAKE THESE NOW!!!!  You won't be sorry!  I think these make a great breakfast and are pretty darn healthy!

I used a little over 3/4 cup and it looks like that was the way to go, based on what others have experienced.  The muffins took a little longer to bake, no big deal.  These are not overly sweet.  Will try to cut the oil next time.  Well done! *thumbs up*

I made these as-is which I always like to do when trying and rating a recipe.  The only exception is that I did not have raisins and used dried cranberries instead.  My family LOVES the usual pumpkin muffins I make but these were great and a welcome change from my typical white flour-sugar pumpkin muffin recipe.  They have a wonderful hearty, kind of earthy, texture using the whole wheat and I loved using the brown sugar and honey - they really added great flavor.  I put the nuts on top instead of inside so they toasted.  These are yummy still two days later.  Will definitely make again!

I made these using the substitutions recommended by other reviewers with one cup of pumpkin and using applesauce instead of oil, but found them to be overly dense and doughy (no matter how long I baked them). I will try them again as per the original recipe, since it looks so promising.  There is no distinction between using regular whole wheat or whole wheat pastry flours, but I think I may try the pastry flour.

Works well when converting to gluten free.  Just add a little apple sauce to keep the moisture.  Also works well with reduced sugars.

I just baked a batch. following the suggestions, I used a cup of pumpkin, the ginger, cinnamon and nutmeg for the spice and filled each muffin cup to the top. (makes 11 muffins that way)  very moist and filling. Will substitute 1 mashed banana for the oil next time and see how that comes out. overall good muffin.

Moist, tender, delicious--and actually healthy! Used a heaping cup of canned pumpkin, and a mix of cinnamon, nutmeg and ginger for the pumpkin pie spice (not sure exactly how much, as my toddler was helping). I mixed the batter gently with a rubber spatula. Could've used more raisins, didn't add walnuts but I think they would've been tasty as well. I had enough leftover batter for 1-2 more muffins, so I baked it up in a small, round glass dish I had, coated with cooking spray.

Delicious!  Only change was to use a dash of cloves/nutmeg/ginger and a healthy dose of cinnamon in place of the pumpkin pie seasoning.

Great base recipe that I could change up to suit my needs. I had to make a lot of substitutions to cut back on sugar and to use the fruit I had on hand. Thank you for sharing your recipe.

leave out the raisins, subtract half the nuts, and use nutmeg instead of pumpkin pie spice. I would rate it 50 stars if I could!!

I loved these!  I put chocolate chips in the first and second batch but left them plain in the third.  I also used applesauce in place of oil in my second and third batches and left out the honey for a lower calorie muffin.  Compared with the first batch in which I followed the recipe, they were slightly heavier and slightly less sweet, but still amazing and something I am happy to give my kids for snacks.  They love them.

This recipe was okay, nothing too special. I probably won't bother to make it again since there are so many other pumpkin recipes to try. I do like that it used whole wheat flour though to make it a bit healthier.

Delicious!  I used whole wheat pastry flour (it's ground more fine than regular whole wheat flour and is available at Walmart), substituted Craisins for the raisins and threw in a couple of handfuls of quick oats.  Cook time was closer to 21 minutes for me.  All in all, very good!

These were soooo yummy!  I made them with applesauce instead of the oil, and didn't add the nuts (due to an allergy) or the raisins. They were so moist and good.  Let them cool off a bit before tasting so that the flavors can marry.  My family of 5 ate these all up in a day, so I am making more this morning.

My nine year old daughter and I just made these muffins! They are great. We used a whole can of pumpkin, half of the honey with half Lyle's Golden Syrup.   They are moist and delicious--a perfect fall treat for rushed mornings...

I didn't have any walnuts, so used grated carrot instead - I know, a strange substitution - but it actually worked really well.  Just had to increase baking time by a few minutes.  The kids don't know they're eating veggies and enjoying them too!  The 2nd time I made them, I followed the recipe a bit closer - no carrots!, but still no walnuts, added a full cup of pumpkin as others suggested - and they turned out perfect.  I still had to increase the baking time by a few minutes.

I used a whole cup of fresh cooked and pureed pumpkin and these were really moist and light. You can't even tell they're made with whole wheat. DH adores pumpkin and I'm not that keen but we both enjoyed these.

Delicious!  I subbed unsweetened dried cranberries for the raisins and pecans for the walnuts, and used my own pumpkin spice blend which contains cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, ginger and mace.  Also used fresh pumpkin puree.  The muffins came out so moist, flavorful and tender.  Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe!

I used cinnamon instead of pumpkin spice and sunflower seed and dried cranberries because that is what I had.  As Rachel would say- delish!  Also I only had a six muffin pan and I am impatient so I put the other half of the mix in a loaf pan and that worked out sorta...:)

These were great considering how healthy they are.  I used apple sauce instead of oil, no raisins or nuts because my kids don't like them, and added extra pumpkin like other reviews said.  Very good!

Delicious!  But, I have to admit, I had to make a few changes because they were way too sweet for me.  I cut the honey down to 1/3 of a cup and the brown sugar by 1/2.  My husband would prefer chocolate chips, but I think the raisins keep it healthy!  I have also used squash baby food instead of the oil, and they came out pretty well - very sticky to the muffin paper.  Next time I'll use the small container of baby food with a bit of olive oil. Great recipe!

These are great. My almost 4 y/o son and I just made them. I didn't have brown sugar so we subbed white and molasses (which I had on hand for some reason).  We used half butter and half applesauce for the oil and a little more than a cup of pumpkin puree. We also used cinnamon/sugar that I had for cinnamon toast (I was out of just cinnamon) and ginger and nutmeg. I just dumped some in, no idea how much.  Made 1/2 with raisins, 1/2 without and got about 15 muffins.  The kids are begging me for more and my hubby said "OH MAN" when he tasted one right out the oven. These are a keeper!! Next time we might add chocolate chips and one batch we will add a little oatmeal. Thanks for the recipe!!

I really enjoyed these, although I did make a few changes.  I used a heaping cup of pumpkin.  Also, instead of pumpkin pie spice I used 3/4 tsp cinnamon, 1/4 tsp cloves, 1/4 tsp nutmeg, and 1/4 tsp ginger.  And I used chocolate chips instead of raisins and nuts.  :)  YUM!

Fantastic!  I bumped the pumpkin up to 1 cup, and didn't have enough honey (just added a few tablespoonfuls), but they turned out with nice flavor, dense but moist.  Also didn't have pumpkin pie spice but I added some part teaspoonfuls of cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg and cloves.  I didn't bother to soak the raisins and they came out nice and plump regardless.  I can't believe how tender the muffin is for all whole wheat flour!

Yummy! These turned out to be more moist and pumpkin-tasting than I would have thought with the whole wheat. I used the 3/4 c. pumpkin like the recipe said and it was perfect. I made them last night and we warmed them up for breakfast this morning and my whole family loved them. Good source of protein and fiber!

This is a great whole wheat recipe.  They were very moist and a lot sweeter than I was expecting.  They were dense but that is normal for whole wheat recipes.  I have only tried them hot out of the oven but my 4 and 2 yr olds loved them as much as I.  I used a full cup of pumpkin, added some unsweetened crushed pineapple (drained) that I needed to use in place of the raisins, and only a 1/3 c honey.  Took about 5 more minutes to cook than called for.  I might add a little more spice next time.  Thanks for the great recipe.

Great! I doubled the pumpkin spice and also added some cinnamon, nutmeg and a cinnamon/sugar mix that I have and they turned out great. Everything else stayed the same.

I took some of the suggestions by adding applesauce and halving the oil and adding 1 cup pumpkin.  They were moist and delicious.
