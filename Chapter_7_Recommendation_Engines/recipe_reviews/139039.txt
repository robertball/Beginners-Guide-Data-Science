This was delicious great for leftovers the next day as well!  Didn't use as much dressing as the recipe called for, think if I had used the entire amount it would have been an overpowering taste.

Always looking for different, creative and delicious recipes and this one is fabulous.  Guests witih discriminating tastes raved about this salad at the recent graduation celebration celebration of my son.  Bravo Laurie!!FYI - The flavor of the marinated artichoke hearts is key - found the very best ones at Costco.

The ingredients are all items we like, but the dressing needs to be changed.  I don't know if it was the worchestershire, but did not care for it.  It almost needs some type of sweetness or something.  Any suggestions?

This Salad was fabulous and easy.  I ran a 188 mile relay race and needed a nutritional, easy salad that I could pack in a ziplock bag.  I used whole wheat pasta and subsituted the asparagus with spinach leaves because i'm not a big fan of cold asparagus. Do not change the dressing it was perfect! I used 12 oz. package of pasta and doubled the chicken and the dressing was the exact amount needed.  My team RAVED about the salad!  It was easy on our stomachs and gave us lots o energy for our race.  THANK YOU so much for this awesome recipe!

I would give this 5 stars, but I made modifications that improved it---loved the basic recipe, but needed more mayo and I added extra seasoning (Mrs. Dash) and fresh ground pepper. A very nice salad!

I made as directed except did not use almonds. A very nice blend of flavors.  It may be a little dry - may add more mayo next time.

My family loved the dressing - I thought it was perfect. We will definitely be keeping this recipe. I doubled all the ingredients EXCEPT the dressing. I also replaced the asparagus with fresh spinach because I didn't have fresh asparagus on hand. I mixed all the ingredients (except the pasta and balsamic dressing) and squeezed half of a fresh lemon over it & tossed (instead of 2 teaspoons of juice) Then I mixed the balsamic dressing with just the pasta, really so I could see if it was as bad as people thought. It was fine so I then mixed the pasta with the rest of the ingredients. I thought the cranberries added the perfect amount of sweetness to the dish. The flavor combination was right on for us, we loved it!!! but if your not doubling the ingredients I would recommend not using as much dressing as it calls for it may be too overpowering.

Loved it.   I omitted the bacon and the worcestershire sauce.  Added organge juice since I didnt have a lemon.   Added some sliced raw garlic.  Added the sauce at the last minute and it was wonderful.

Delicious recipe but I did modify it by adding some toasted pine nuts and a sprinkling of parmesan cheese at the end. Also I lightly dressed it with the dressing. I didn't use it all. So many possibilities with this recipe.

Like the photo shows, I added baby spinach.  I also used walnuts instead of almonds and added green onion and black olives. This was very good.

Delicious! I was out of bacon, so I added leftover diced ham from Christmas. I will be making this salad again because I love the combination of the ingredients. 
Thank you for sharing this recipe!

Extra mayo and you can play w everything else. I doubled the recipe and brought to a gathering. Everyone had seconds or thirds!  The asparagus was perfect!
