I have actually never made this exact recipe, but I use it as a base to make  sugar-free banana cream pies for my dad.  It works WONDERFULLY.  I simply replace the sugar with Splenda and the vanilla with banana extract,a drop or two of yellow food coloring, then pour the filling over sliced bananas in a sugar-free cookie crumb crust.  Chill it and top it with sweetened whipped cream.  My dad LOVES it and after tasting it, my aunt asked for the recipe so she can make it for my uncle, who is diabetic.  If you know how to make a custard, this recipe is practically fool-proof and HIGHLY adaptable.  5 stars!!

Excellent, very rich.  The only change I made was to incorporate 1-1/2 cups of the coconut (untoasted) into the custard filling, followed by the egg whites and whipped cream.  Sprinkled the remaing coconut (toasted) on top of the pie before serving.  Will definitely make again!

This is the SECOND pie I've ever made.  I was a little nervous, but this pie turned out BEAUTIFULLY!  

There was a little snafu with the whipped cream - I think I used too much or whipped the cream too long.  The pie was still one of the best I've ever had.

This pie is super rich -- a total coconut luxury!  It is also INCREDIBLY versatile!  The brandy can be switched out for any flavoured liqueur, and fruit would easily be used in place of coconut.  I can't wait to try it again with strawberries - YUM!

One thing I'll do differently: add more jam.  I love jam and I'd like it to shine through a bit more.  Happy baking, friends!

Love Love this recipe .  It's so much better than a standard custard pie.   I have made it with the apricot and without, both ways are awesome.

I made the pie gluten-free by using almond flour and crushed rice chex for the crust.  For the filling I followed the instructions exactly. I did use a thermometer to make sure the mixtures were at the  correct temperature.  When I made it a second time I found that using a double boiler for the egg yolk mixture was easier to manage on the stove then poured it into a large bowl. The recipe does take some time of constant preparation but well worth the love and attention. Allow several hours or day before to set. It is delicious, light and smooth, will be my go-to dessert recipe.
The recipe makes a lot more than will fit in a pie shell. I used the remainder by crumbling more of the base ingredients in the bottom  of 3  stemless wine glasses, spooning in the filling then topping with mandarin pieces and toasted  coconut for an elegant dessert.
