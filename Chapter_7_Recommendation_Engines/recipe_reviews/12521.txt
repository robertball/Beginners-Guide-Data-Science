Thumbs up! Good recipe. Very easy and can be made with ingredients on hand. Best made with fresh fruit. 
I was a little hesitant just spooning the fruit on top of the batter and not having a topping to place over the fruit, but soon realized the topping comes up over the top of the fruit almost encasing it.
I did as another baker did and added a tablespoon of orange juice and sprinkled just a little bit of cinnamon on top of the fruit (peaches & plums) and then sprinkled some brown sugar on top once the fruit was spooned over the batter and it turned out fantastic.
Thank you! Excellent recipe.

Absolutely my favorite dessert recipe I have found thus far on this site.  I was really afraid...never having made cobbler before and trying it out for the first time with company over for dinner.  It was fabulous.  Company loved it and asked for the recipe.  I didn't have any peaches, but used apples instead...all I had on hand.  Thank you for the post....delicious.

I used fresh blueberries instead of peaches with great success.  Good recipe.  I will definitely make it again.

This was so easy and good. I just recommend adding additional fruit. I used fresh peaches (peeled and sliced) but I wish I had almost doubled it.

This was the hit of the party. It was gone way before the birthday cake! I really wanted to use only apples, but I wasn't sure what type would work best, so I used what I had on hand which was only 2 granny smith. I had a lot of fresh plums I recently purchased, so I mixed them with the apples along with a dash of cinnamon, a tablespoon of orange juice, and I don't know why, but a squirt of lemon extract. I spooned over the batter, and sprinkled brown sugar on top. Everyone LOVED it! I will definately make this one again and again!!! Thank you for sharing this receipe.

I haven't ever made cobbler before, but I had some blueberries and 2 nectarines that needed to go...YUM, I'm not at all sorry that I decided to try this out.  Even with my goofy fruit combo, it was still delish!  Thanks Lenna!!

This recipe is so easy! I love cinnamon, so I put a tsp. in the batter. And I also tossed my apples in a little apple juice, cinnamon and walnuts, then used all of the mixture, for more moistness. I will definitely make this again, and will try other fruit as well.

This was great for a family funeral.  I made up 8 large pans and they were gone inside of 10 minutes!  I have weekly bakes of it to my friends and family. Although I got smart after the first mass baking and now they purchase the ingredients for each one they want.  I would be broke otherwise!  

We maserated the fruits beforehand with sugars and liquor to the taste of the person who wants one made.  I am the baker in the family.  

Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe!

Quick and easy yes, but that's not enough to please me if the end result is nothing notable.  I thought it just acceptable, Hubs didn't care for it at all. I guess we were both put off by the batter part, which wasn't particularly good either in taste, texture or appearance. We also would have preferred more fruit, less "dough."  Not worth the splurge in calories, so we didn't.

There was no taste to the apples and the consistancy of "cake" was rather unappealing.

Rave reviews from my eaters who were celebrating a friend's birthday.  I saved some of the peaches back, made a glaze with them.  I also made homemade ice cream.  

One square of cobbler, one scoop of ice cream beside the cobblrt, a spoonful of glaze on both the cobbler and ice cream, sprinkled a little cinnamon on the ice cream and a spray of canned whipped cream on the cobbler.

Certainly a $5+ dessert at some restaurant!

With the abundance of fresh summer fruit, "Fruit Cobbler" caught my eye.  My daughter and I followed the recipe as directed including the peaches.  Because my daughter loves berries, she asked if we could mix in some assorted berries.  In they went.  I like nectarines, in two went with the peaches and mixed before adding to the batter.  The Taste and texture of the mix of fruit and berries was so DE--LICIOUS!!  Thank you Lenna for such a versatile cobbler recipe.  The hardest part of this recipe was deciding on "WHAT" fruit or berries to add to this recipe. My topping was a little scant, probably because of the extra fruit, so I will up the batter 1/2 more next time.  IT'S A VERSATILE KEEPER!

Wow! This was really good and gone in 1  day! I had a 32 oz bag of tropical fruit blend in my freezer (peaches, strawberries, pineapples and mangos). I just added them frozen. I had no idea how it would turn out, but it was great. My kids all wanted more, but there wasn't any left.*I topped each serving with vanilla ice cream. Will make again!!!

This was so delish! Simple to make, very few ingredients, which was great! I did not change a thing...plain and simple! I made it using fresh peaches and that was the only time consuming part of this cobbler...the peeling and slicing. Those people who used fresh fruit (peaches, pears, apples, etc.) need to slice them on the thin side in order to avoid them being "uncooked". This avoids having to cook them beforehand. Absolutely wonderful! I can't wait to try this with fresh picked apples this fall! Thank you for sharing this marvelous recipe!

This was soooo easy and really good!  My only complaint was there was not enough crust, I'll double it next time.  there were crispy places and cake-like places in mine.  And I'm not sure if it was the pan I used or my oven or what, but the 55 minutes called for was not enough, I had to cook it another 40 minutes, but it's really good with vanilla ice cream on top.  Great recipe!

Followed the exact recipe, took to a Summer BBQ/pool party and was the hit of the party. Everyone raved on how delicious it tasted. Didn't bring a morsel home. Will try next time with home picked blackberries.

I'd never made a cobbler and was wary about not mixing anything together, just pouring the fruit on top...but it worked :) I used peaches and raspberries...soo tasty!

delicious cake-like cobbler!  i used canned peaches to save time.  to compensate for not using fresh, i added 1/4 teaspoon of cinnamon and sprinkled the top with brown sugar.  this is the best tasting dessert that ive made from this website so far.

This recipe was a FLOP!! 55 minutes meant a piece of burned crust with the consistency of rubber. It was edible, but that does not mean tasty in the least. Turned me off cobbler.

Even thought there seem to be plenty of great reviews for this recipe, I will never make it again.  I used peaches and plums and was extremely disappointed in the taste.  My family usually gobbles up everything I bake....not this time....it still sits in the fridge; will probably end up throwing the rest of it out...Oh well, live and learn!  I still don't understand how it could have won first place in a contest...

Wow, this was the easiest cobbler I've ever made and it was also one of the most delicious.  It's very versatile - I would imagine you could use just about any fresh or frozen fruit you have on hand.  I used a bag of unsweetened peaches and a bag of unsweetened mixed berries.  A little more fruit than the recipe called for, but ended up being perfect.  I ran out of milk, so I ended up using 1/2 milk and 1/2 half-n-half.  This is a really fantastic, simple, and flexible recipe.  Thanks for sharing Lenna!

Excelent Recipe (I did peaches, raspberries, blackberries).  For best effect, prepare (slice) the fruit in a bowl first.  Add 1/4 cup to 1/2 cup of the sugar to the fruit, as well as 2 tablespoons of orange juice.  This (sugar and acid) will leech out the natural juices and sugars of the fruit, and intensify the fruity taste creating a much stronger fruit punch to the cobbler.  I served, and before I could get extra desert plates, my guests were taking seconds.  HIGHLY reccomended.

Definitely a crowd pleaser.  It was delicious as is, but I'm going to cut back on the sugar a little next time... especially if the fruit is already sweet.  Melting the butter first and pouring the batter on top creates a nice crisp bottom layer.

Now I know why your son won 1st place with this recipe. It should get 1st, 2nd and 3rd because no other recipe can come close to the deliciousness his one has! I've always made a cheater type of cobbler with a cake mix and fruit...and it was good enough to not look for one from scratch. Plus, I am all about "easy" recipes...the less work, the better. But, I came across this one a few days ago, and decided to make it last night. And I'm happy to say I will NEVER make another cobbler recipe besides this one again. It's phenomenal!! And it really wasn't any more work than my "cheater" recipe. My fiance works nights, and gets home very early in the morning, and he found it in the fridge. Needless to say, he left me 1 helping (a small one at that) for when I woke up, lol. I used canned peaches since I didn't have fresh on hand, and I cannot imagine this tasting any better had I used fresh! I added a mixture of flour, brown sugar and butter to make a crumbly topping on this, and no other changes, and added it during the last 30 mins of cooking. It turned out perfect! I wouldnt change a thing. Thanks so much, Lenna, for this easy and delicious recipe! It's definitely a keeper!

This was a super simple recipe! But like some others, I changed it just a tad.  I used a quart of fresh blueberries, and soaked them too (like another gal did) awhile.  and I put a crumbly topping on top before baking, consisting of 1/3 c. margerine, 1/2 c. brown sugar, and 3/4 c. flour, crumbling it with a pastry blender.  It turned out excellent! Thanks for the recipe!

I made a few changes; 1 tsp cinnamon in batter, sprinkled w/ cinn. sugar 10 min before finished cooking, only used 1/2 the juice PERSONAL PREFERENCE.  Thanks for another quick delicious recipe!!!!!

I was looking for a quick fruit dessert to make, and I found a winner in this recipie!  I used a 12 oz bag of frozen raspberries and 8 oz of frozen strawberries in juice(sweetened and thawed) mixed with aboout 1/3 cup sugar and a tbsp of cornstarch.  This formed a delicious syrup on the bottom of the cake.  I only baked mine for about 45 mins, and it turned out being just what I wanted.  It was a breeze to whip up in no time at all, and your house smells wonderful while it's baking.  Thanks Lenna for a quick and easy homemade dessert!

This was pretty good. I like the pie crust version of cobbler better but family liked it. I used blackberries and peaches because that's what i had on hand!

we used plums from our tree, and the cobbler was the best we ever had! I served it warm with home-made vanilla bean ice cream.  It was a hit! Thanks for sharing! Diana

I made this for a special brunch last week and I'm sorry I did. Chewy texture and not enough flavor. Most of my guests left the majority of their dessert on the plate and of course no one asked for seconds. :0(

This is an excellent recipe!  Very quick and easy to prepare, it was moist and not overly sweet.  I made it for a women's group meeting and handed out two copies of the recipe.  I used canned peaches and mangos for a little tropical flair!  I'll definitely make this again and again.

I also made this with plums, and it was so good. I was a little skeptical about pouring the batter over the melted butter and being told NOT to mix it, but it all works out when it bakes.  Really good basic recipe that I am looking forward to playing around with other fruits.

I made this with homegrown apples, I didn't like the idea of adding dry uncooked apples to the top so I cut up and boiled 6 small apples with an apple core utensil in about 1/2 to 3/4 cup water, sugar and cinnamon to taste until soft, not mushy or falling apart. At the end I took some of the liquid out and mixed with a teaspoon of corn starch to thicken up the juices. Because I put sugar with the apples I only used about 3/4 cup of sugar for the crust. Before baking I sprinkled the top with a little more cinnamon.
  I can't even tell you how amazingly delicious this turned out!  My daughter, her friend she brought home from school and I sat down and each had a nice big piece and the kitchen smelled heavenly!   This is a wonderful treat to make when the kids come home from college...very appreciated!

I thought this had a very cakey consistency.  It was ok, but not my personal favorite.  I used nectarines and some raspberries.

WAAAAAY too sweet! Maybe if you used something tart, like cherries, instead of peaches it wouldn't be so bad, but we didn't like it at all.

I have made this with blueberries, and mixed berries, both times with whole wheat flour and it is a great easy dish. I would recommend sprinkling a little brown sugar on top. I didn't do this the second time and it was a little tart tasting.

Simply amazing!! I had never made a cobbler before this one and now it is all I will be making from here on out! I followed recipe exactly except that I only used apples from a friends farm, so not sure what variety, I cooked them slightly in butter, brown sugar and cinnomon on the stove before placing them on the cobbler. This is a keeper at our house!!!

I followed the recipe exactly but I used a frozen fruit medley. I was very disappointed in the flavor of this. It was not very good at all. Pretty bland. Aside from that it was easy to make but I will definitely not make this again.

A reliable and simple recipe - all ingredients are usually on hand. The only part of it that takes a little time is peeling and slicing the fruit. Serves up very nicely fresh out of the oven with vanilla ice cream. I used a combo of fresh apples and frozen plums. The plums added some nice colour to the cobbler.

I made this to top apples - it was delicious! I only realised half-way through making it that there were no eggs, but it didn't make any difference.   It was even better cold, later! ----- Have made it many times, since with a variety of different fruits. Consistently awesome! Family loves it!

LOVED IT!!!!!  This will repace my old cobbler recipe. So easy too.  I used probably 6 cups of peaches and a touch of blueberries.  Some of the peaches were a tad hard so I sprinkled the tiniest bit of cinnamon sugar onto the fruit - maybe 1/2 teaspoon.  Perfecto!!  I'll be making this again, and again, and again.  Thanks!

Wow, we loved this recipe!  Mmy husband and I ate half of it right after it came out of the oven!  There are so many good things about this recipe, but the best is that it doesn't have tons of fat!  I used fresh peaches and sprinkled a little cinnamon and brown sugar on top.  YUM!  I can't wait to make it with other kinds of fruit.

W-O-N-D-E-R-F-U-L Just baked this up, and although I love the biscuit type topping on cobbler, I thought I would try this one this time, and loved it.  I could have used less sugar, since my peaches were home grown and really sweet naturally. But this is easier than the biscuit topping and nice for a change.

It was good; not great, but good. Added 1/2 t of almond extract, still kind of nondescript.

This is a great recipe and don't let the, "DO NOT MIX" warning scare you. I had my doubts, but it worked. This is a keeper for my family. Thanks!

I left out the vanilla and added 1/2 tsp. almond extract to the peaches and sprinkled cinnamon overtop.  Delicious!  Thanks for the great recipe!

We live in Shanghai, China and I tried this recipe with the local apples and sprinkled cinnamon on the top before baking.  It was fabulous and very easy!  Will definately keep this recipe on the top of my list!

Love it! My only changes to the recipe are to add a third of the sugar and splash of lemon and orange juice to the fruit. I let the fruit sit and marinate while I prepare the rest. I've used both thawed frozen and fresh fruit with great results. So yummy!

I used two cups of fresh raspberries, two cups peaches. Then, I made a pecan crunch topping with some brown sugar, ginger, and cinnamon. It baked up beautifully. Waiting for my boyfriend to come over so we can try it.

Very good. Tried with berries, whole wheat flour, and olive oil instead of butter. Pan just needs a thin coat of oil to work. I think I waited too long between making the batter and adding the fruit, seems like the batter set up a bit and didn't 'engulf' the fruit. Still delicious, just not as pretty at the end. Loved it, can't wait for peach season!

I expected the crust to end up on top but the apples stayed on top. I used Splenda instead of sugar and it was very good once it cooled. I'll be making it again.

This was a great recipe, I used 4 cans of fruit cocktail, drained and removed the grapes. I followed the recipe measurements and instructions, Do Not Stir! And after 20 minutes baking I lightly sprinkled the top with cinnamon/sugar and cooked for 30 more minutes, came out wonderful! Soooo Good, you have to try this one!

This was great!  I never made cobbler before, but had a bunch of plums to get rid of so I thought I'd give it a shot.  It turned out perfectly!  I added a vanilla glaze because the plums were a bit tart and it made it even better!

I used fresh blueberries.  The flavor was really good---but the texture a little dry.  I think an extra splash of milk would do the trick, especially with dryer fruit.

I've made this numerous times with blueberries, strawberries, raspberries and peaches.  It always comes out great and my picky family loves it! If you're short on the fresh fruit, mixing in preserves or jam works well too. (I mixed about 2-3 T of Jam with a little warm water to loosen it a bit to compensate for my shortage of fruit (about a cup short). Usually this dessert doesn't last through the night! Definitely a keeper!

really easy to make, and super tasty. I only made a few changes. I added a little more vanilla than the recipe calls for, and then threw a packet of instant oatmeal on top of the fruit before baking to give the dish a bit more texture. this is a great all-around recipe; it works wonderfully with apples, peaches, raspberries, and blueberries.

Amazing! And incredibly easy to make.  I made it for Mother's Day.  There were four of us and we each had a serving after lunch.  I told my mom she should take the rest home.  By the time she was ready to leave, there was nothing left! We all picked at the leftovers until it was gone.  Soooooooo yummy!

To make a mistake with this recipe one should be a very bad cook. I followed it through and read some of the others reviews just to see how I could use apples instead. I used fresh apples, 4 in total, and the result was amazing. I liked this recipe because it didn't ask for tons and tons of sugar. It's still sweet and no need for more sugar in any cobbler.

Love this recipe!!   And actually, you can use any kind of fruit you like and it can be fresh or canned.....the cobbler always turns out wonderful!  I leave out the salt and vanilla but use a whole stick of butter (to melt in pan).  Tonight I'm making one with fresh apricots!!  :)))))))))))

Excellent and easy is how I would describe this... especially when using fresh persimmons from my yard.  Tip - make a sauce in a food processor of approximately one cup of the persimmons with a little sugar and water.

So yummy!! I made it tonight and it was a hit. I used more than 2 lb of apples. We do not like cinnamon so I made it plain but still it's so delicious. I can't wait for my husband to taste it... Thanks so much Lenna for sharing this recipe.   Rochtur

I followed the recipe to the letter, and it turned out beautifully. .  I used 12 small-to-medium sized peaches, not very ripe (I tried a few pieces raw and they were quite tart). I was concerned how the cobbler would turn out, but there was nothing to worry about! The cobbler was just sweet enough, the fruit didn't turn to mush, and it really was just right.

This is more like a fresh fruit dump cake than a cobbler.  Not that that's a bad thing, just don't expect a traditional-type cobbler.  It was very good the day I made it (with fresh peaches and blueberries).  It got mushy by the next day, though.

Very good!  I wanted to try this recipe right away and only had apples available, so I sliced them and sprinkled sugar, cinnamon and a little nutmeg on them then proceeded with the recipe.  Before serving, I topped each serving with vanilla ice cream.  Everyone truly enjoyed this simple but tasty dessert.

The cobbler/crust part was wonderful.  I used fresh peaches and the peaches didn't get completely cooked.  Next time if I use peaches I will cook first.

Absolutely wonderful!!  I made it using fresh strawberries and it was incredible.  My son is allergic to milk, so I altered the recipe and used Vanilla Soy Milk and Fleischmanns unsalted butter and it was still incredible!!  Great recipe for my family!

Very good; however, I did make a couple of changes.  To cut the sugar, I used a little less than one-half cup sugar and a little less than one-half cup Splenda.  I probably ended up with about 3/4 cup of sweetener instead of the 1 cup called for.  A second change was to reduce the vanilla by about half.

This dish goes very well with vanilla ice cream, especially if the cobbler is warm or even hot!

This was very easy to make.  At first I didn't like it very much, but after the second bite it grew on me.  It was a little rubbery, but not too bad.  I was going to give it a 3, but my husband really liked it and I found myself going back for seconds, so I guess it was better than a 3!  Served with vanilla ice cream.

This is such an easy recipe! My family loves it, and it's perfect to take to barbecues. I am a pie crust lover myself, but my family likes this cakey version. With the sweet batter you don't have to use much sugar for the fruit. Thanks for the great recipe!

I just made your cobbler last night for my husband & myself. He really liked it. It was a breeze to make. I didn't add anything for the first time making it.I may try can peaches next time to have some juice. It will go in my recipe book to try at work.

Super versitile.  I have made with peaches and apples (separately).  I was really pleased.  I made it in the crock pot.  I think I need a new crock pot because it cooked unevenly.  I can't wait to try it in the oven!  :)

I made this cobbler with pears and dried cranberries and my husband loved it. Me on the otherhand did not care for it as much. It wasn't the fruit filling, but the cobbler part that didn't sit well with me. This cobbler didn't have the usual brown sugar topping that I am used to in other cobblers that sort of make the cobbler caramel-like and crunchy. Since HE loved it, I give it 4 stars.

This turned out absolutely amazing! The texture of the cobbler was perfect, and it was just as light and moist as it should be. I used apples because they're my favourite, and this recipe with it's basic ingredients, was simply out of this world... not to mention how pretty it looks :-)

I substituted 24 oz. of fresh blackberries (washed and drained well) for the peaches. It was delicious.  Next time, I'll use only 18 ounces...think that would be plenty.  Warning: I wouldn't serve this to formal company, because it really stained our teeth and tongues!

Very easy to prepare. I peeled my peaches and added 1 teaspoon cinnamon. It could of used a little more juice though. I will use this recipe again. It will work great with different fruits.

Very easy and tasty.  I used 2 bags of frozen cherries and it came out just wonderful.  I will use this recipe again for other fruits as well.

This is the best cobbler recipe I have ever made.  I used blackberries, and it turned out FABULOUS.  I'm sure you could use ANY fruit, and it would be good.

Great way to use plums!  Using only enough butter to coat the bottom of the pan is a great low-fat option.

In the oven now and smells wonderful. I had nectarines. The batter did not seem "battery" enough with 1 cup milk a Just peeked in oven and it's looking good! Next time I will add chopped walnuts.so I added a bit more and then put over the melted butter. Also added cinnamon.

Such an easy and good recipe.  I have made this recipe several times with different fruit/berries.  Most recently I made it with blueberries and gluten-free flour for a friend,  and she described it as "amazing."  I use the leftovers for breakfast and sometimes add a little half-and-half.  Yum!

This is really simple to make and has a great consistency and flavors. I used fruit cocktail for something different. Next time i make it I'm going to add some pecans or walnuts and a crumble topping.

This was the best cobbler and very easy to make. My family loved it and it was gone before the night was over.  The next day they asked if I could make it again.  The only change I made was I used mixed fresh berries of strawberries, blackberries  and raspberries.  I will definitely make this again.

It was extremely easy to prepare which is a plus.  But the cobbler was really gooey. Although I did get compliments when the dessert was served, I don't think I will make this recipe again..

This was the easiest and best fruit cobbler I've ever made.  I used fresh peaches which I cooked a little just till juices came then thickened it with 2teasp. of cornstarch added fresh cherries and fresh blueberries uncooked. I just threw them in with the peaches.  It  was really great. I did sprinkle with brown sugar as others suggested.  everyone really enjoyed it.  I thought it was better than pie!!!!!!

So yummy! I’ve used thin sliced apples with cinnamon, peaches, pears, and combinations. I usually top it with a quick oat crumb topping and serve with whip or ice cream. Much preferred to apple pie.

I followed the recipe exactly as written. I used peaches. The peaches were the only thing that my kids ate. The bottom layer never rose above the peaches, but turned into a rubbery cake.

Thank you Lenna for this wonderful easy recipe.  I made it with a combination of peaches and plums with gluten free flour.  I followed the recipe as written except for the flour but sprinkled some pecans over the top half way through the baking process.  Very very tasty.

Quick prep time and good consistency but I found the flavor to be bland. I'll try cinnamon and some brown sugar next time...maybe oats too for texture (or maybe just go back to a crisp recipe).

This was great! Super easy to throw together, and very tasty! The flavor is a tad light, but that's not necessarily a bad thing... a little vanilla ice cream on top made it perfect. I used thawed frozen cherries in mine, and to my dismay found that I was short about 1/4 cup from the amount of fruit the recipe calls for (I also halved the recipe, next time I definitely need to make a bigger pan!!). However, it still baked great, kind of like a big, SUPER moist muffin. I do feel, as another reviewer suggested, this would be better with more fruit. I *was* short on the fruit, but it was only 1/4 C, and I feel like even if I'd had the full amount the recipe listed, it would still be more cakey than cobbler-ey. Regardless, it is very good, and I will definitely make this again! Thanks for sharing!!

I tried this recipe with apples that were pre-cooked for an apple pie, so they already had sugar and cinnamon on them.  I used a pyrex glass dish to cook it as that was the only 9X13 inch pan that I had.  I found that with using a glass dish to cook it 55 minutes was way too long!!  I only left it in the oven for about 35 minutes and at that it was a little burnt around the edges.  However it was really really good!!  I also sprinkled a litte white sugar on top of the fruit before putting it in the oven.  The only thing it was missing was a big scoop of vanilla ice cream on the side of it!!

I made this recipe with blueberries and peaches without any alterations for my neighbor.  She called me asking for the recipe, said it was excellent.  She suggests having some vanilla ice cream on hand!

I made this with apples, lemon juice and lots of cinnamon. I also added vanilla to the dough. I had a lot of dried apples on the top - they didn't sink into the batter, as I had expected them to, but it was still very delicious. The dough was great!  I might have used a smaller pan than what was called for, so that may have been to blame. I used coconut milk kefir instead of milk. This recipe reminded me of bread pudding with baked apples.

Made this with some peaches and nectarines that  were getting a little over ripe.  Added cinnamon, nutmeg and 1/8 cup sugar to the fruit.  Had it for breakfast the next morning.  It was a hit with my picky son.  Thanks.

Moist, delicious, we used this for a birthday treat, it was perfect, like a cross between cobbler and cake! I am a health nut so it's sweetness was perfect. We used peaches & blueberries & of course whipped cream!

This was really easy and very fast to put together for a last minute dessert. Not counting cutting up the fruit (used fresh peaches and strawberries) it took 10 minutes to whip up and get in the oven. Taste wise , well it was a little bland , and peaches aren't very sweet so the best bites were the ones with strawberry in it , would double or make all strawberry next time. Also I added a oatmeal/brown sugar crumble to the top and thank god I did because the base was good but nothing spectacular and the crumble made it taste like a 5 star dessert. Just base and peaches I'd give 3.5 stars , with strawberries and crumble 5 stars. I added the crumble 20 minutes before it was done baking.

This is the first cobbler I've made and it came out excellent.  Since it is just my husband and I, I halved the recipe and used a 9x9 pan.  I also added cinnamon to the batter, used 1/2 peaches, 1/2 blueberries and mixed some brown sugar with the fruit before I spooned it over the batter.  So easy to make and awesome taste.  My husband's comment:  "Why did you half the recipe?"

I didn't care for this recipe at all. The cake was spongy and not very flavorful. It also didn't resemble any type of cobbler I've had in the past. Like other reviewer noted, it was more like a dump cake.

I just made this tonight using nectarines and it was delicious. Like others, I put a tablespoon of OJ over the fresh fruit with a sprinkle of cinnamon. A little brown sugar on the top added a nice touch. I made mine in a 8x8 dish and it was perfect. May want to remember to peel the fruit.

Very good.  This is more like a cake than a cobbler though.  I used thawed frozen cherries along with the juice and cut back the sugar to 3/4 cup.  It was still too sweet for me so the next time I will cut the sugar back to 1/2 cup.  I like more of a butter flavor also so I will add butter extract in addition to the melted butter.

Yum!  Honestly, I wasn't expecting it to be as good as it was due to its simplicity.  I used apples and tossed them in apple butter because I thought they needed a little moisture.  I also sprinkled some brown sugar over the top before putting it into the oven.  We had it hot out of the oven and wished for some vanilla ice cream to top it with! Even without ice cream, I was impressed.  I will be making this again!

This was a great recipe.  I used semi-thawed peaches & raspberries because the tree fruit isn't ripe yet.  Worked out very well.  I think I'll add a little more vanilla next time.  I think you could use probably any fruit for this.  Super easy.  Thanks for the great recipe!!

This was a very easy cobbler with basic ingredients that I always have in my kitchen. I used fresh cherries and it was very good.  Not the most amazing cobbler I've ever eaten, but good enough that I'd make it again, especially if I just want to whip up a quick dessert.

I was really happy with this recipe! It works with all kinds of fruit-for example, I made 2, one with fruit medley and the other with only strawberries. Yummy! A quick and easy dessert with items you already have hand.

Loved it!  I used fresh blueberries instead of peaches.  I macerated them for about 15 minutes - I would suggest that you taste your fruit first to see how much sugar you might need to add to it.  I only made half the recipe because it's only my husband and me eating it, but it turned out so well that I should have made the whole 9x13 pan.  The dough tastes sweet and vanilla like.  My husband and I both thought this was great!

I'm giving this 3 stars b/c the basic cobbler is great ... I used fresh peaches, cooked for an hour, and it looked gorgeous, but the fruit wasn't as well-cooked as I would have liked ... I would definitely cook the fruit first if I used this recipe again ....

I made this for my family. At first I wasn't sure if it would work, but I was amazed. Instead of fresh peaches, I added frozen peaches that were thawed out. Just add a little ice cream on top and it is fabulous!

This is amazingly wonderful. I have consumed half of a 13x9 in under 24 hours and am embarrassed to face my husband because of it. I used canned peaches which were on sale...can't imagine how yummy this will be when I make it with fresh summer fruit. I am going to also try it with a bit less sugar if I use canned fruit again.

A little "blah" I thought. I used fresh green apples and threw in a little cinnamon, but it was still disappointing.

This is a wonderful recipe. It adapts well to other kinds of fruit, as well.  The crust is crunchy and lovely where the butter has been around the edges.  I highly recommend it.

I was looking for a recipe with fresh peaches since our peach tree yielded a bunch of little peaches this year. I made this cobbler because it seemed easy. It was. I added 6 cups sliced peaches as another reviwer recommended, and I added 1 tsp vanilla instead of a half. At first, I thought it was a little too sweet. But by the second helping, it tasted better. Warmed and with vanilla ice cream, it was very tasty. Thanks for the recipe!

This was pretty good. I added some cinnamon and brown sugar for a little extra flavor.

Tastes great!  Sprinkles the peaches with a bit of cinnamon and nutmeg.  Next time I will either double the amount of peaches or 1/2 the flour mixture.

Made this recipe exactly as written although I added in a handful of mixed berries which I had in the freezer.  It was wonderful.  Wouldn't change a thing!!  Thanks.  This is a keeper

This was SO EASY and it came out perfect. I happened to have organic peaches from my uncle's garden, and I threw in some apples, apricots, and blackberries too.

I added 4 oz. of cream cheese to the butter, an egg to the batter and made this with 5 cups of fresh rhubarb, microwaved with 2/3 cup of sugar.  Scrumptious.  For those who like rhubarb, you'll love this!
