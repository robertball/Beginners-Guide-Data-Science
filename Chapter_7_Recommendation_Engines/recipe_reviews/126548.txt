I quite liked this one. I mixed it with some cookie dough at the very end to make home made cookie dough ice cream and it tastes just like a major fast food resturants cookie dough concoction (and I should know; I used to work there!). 

I will definitely be making this one again, and again, and again. The mix in options are endless! Going to try Oreos next.

Made this last night and topped it with hot fudge from another recipe on here. It was delicious.

Absolutely loved the simplicity of this recipe. Wanted to be sure it was creamy and so substituted heavy cream for all the cream. Added the condensed milk and 1/2 tsp. of cinnamon oil (in place of the vanilla) for a wonderful taste treat. My husband thought this was a little sweet and a little strong but I thought it was perfect!! Wish I could give it more than 5 stars!!
