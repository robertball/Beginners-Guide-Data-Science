I put the gizzards in a slow cooker with chicken broth and cooked all day on low. When I got home from work the gizzards were very tender. I then added two packages of chicken ramen with the flavor packets to the slow cooker for another half hour until the noodles were done. Very good and very easy.

It took a lot longer to cook until tender.  In my kitchen, 90 minutes.
I diced one small onion and added it to the reserved liquid and simmered 15 minutes before finishing step 2.
All in all, a very enjoyable meal to prepare and eat.  A side salad with it made a delightful meal.

I didn't have ramen so I took 1/2 cube of chicken bouillon with 1/4 diced onion and let it cook with gizzards. I then cooked rice with 1/4 of chicken bouillon and garlic to accompany the gizzards.
