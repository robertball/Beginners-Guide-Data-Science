This is delicious, but try this lone out.  I have used apricot jam instead, and, it is the best.  I make my apricot preserves from canned apricots and Splenda in place of sugar.  Helps to keep the calorie count down too.  It's all simple and very, very good.

Really, really fun. I served it for Valentine's Day breakfast, since it's basically cheese blintzes with whipped cream: breakfast food! This is a labor-intensive recipe, but it can be broken up into steps. I made the crepes first. Cooking them all took about an hour; I think I got 22 total. I wanted to use the filling to frost the exterior as well, so I used a whole 8 oz tub of mascarpone and about 4 Tbsp butter to help it firm up in the fridge. I also wanted to cut down the sweetness of the jam, so I changed the filling. Here's what I did: creamed the room-temp butter and 1/2 cup sugar, then beat in the room-temp mascarpone. I used a food processor to grind a packet of freeze-dried strawberries into a powder, then added that to the filling. I whipped two cups of cream (increased from 1.5 cups) in a separate bowl until soft peaks, then folded that in to the strawberry filling along with the vanilla. Despite increasing the amounts, I didnâ€™t have enough for the outside of the cake and barely enough to cover every crepe. Once I'd stacked the crepes, I let the cake chill about half an hour. I whipped another 1.5 cups of cream with about 2 tablespoons of sugar and used that to frost the top and sides. I let it chill overnight, and it was ready to go this morning! I think it tastes much better at room temperature rather than straight out of the fridge. This would be great for Mother's Day brunch.
