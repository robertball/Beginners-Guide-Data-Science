This is flat out unbelievable!! I added an extra tablespoon of brown sugar (my wife doesn't like it very spicy)and used Crystal Hot Sauce.  The combination of hot sauce and brown sugar makes a wonderful glaze.  I didn't know hot sauce and brown sugar went so well together.  DEFINATELY WILL MAKE AGAIN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

OMG!  By far, the best salmon dish that I have ever eaten!!  This recipe exceeds all other restaurant salmon, too!  My sister came in town to visit and rather than go out to eat in frigid temps, we stayed in and made this dish---we were blown away by how great it tasted.  Don't be intimidated by the amount of hot sauce...it really mellows with the baking.  I will be adding this to my regular dishes.  My kids didn't mind being guinea pigs with this recipe!

this was just delicious! I took a little less sugar and butter to reduce the calories but it was still great. I also added a little fresh ginger, which made it even better. Thanks for the recipe!

This is super tasty! The salmon flavor does not stand out very well, but if you don't like fishy flavor you might like this. Yummy.

We loved this recipe.  In fact, we’d rate it in our top 10 favorites (so far) on this site!  We followed the recipe as written.  Any previous reviewer who’s commented on the quantity of hot sauce being excessive is using the wrong type of hot sauce.  Find a hot sauce (we use LA Gold) which has a spicy taste in addition to heat.  There’s a big difference.  5 stars +++++++

We enjoyed this recipe for the most part, but I felt that the flavor of the hot sauce really masked the flavor of the salmon. This recipe would be well-suited for a person who isn't crazy about salmon.

BAD BAD BAD.  I don't know how this gets such high ratings, unless the secret is in what brand of hot sauce you buy.  I used Louisianna Hot Sauce and all I could taste was that, along with a fishy taste now and again.  My fish turned out kinda mushy too and I even cooked it for 30 minutes.  Yuck.

Excellent.  

I work with the chef who created this recipe.  I was dubious as to the thought of Hot Sauce and Salmon--sounds like it would overpower the natural taste.  I can assure you that it did not.  We used Crystal's hot sauce, followed the recipe, and were very pleased with the results.

I was looking for a non-soy sauce based salmon dish.  This looked promising because I had all the ingredients and I love spicy food.  I'm sorry but I didn't care for it at all.  I have variety of hot sauce and couldn't decide which one I should use so I used half hot wing sauce and half Asian rooster sauce.

More like 3 1/2 stars.  I could handle the hot sauce; that I liked.  It was the sweetness level that I didn't care for.  I'd be apt to drop the brown sugar amount down if I were to make this again. I also didn't taste anything else other than the hot sauce and sugar. Just okay.  Thanks, though, for letting me try!

Easy to throw together and usually served with a salad and bleu cheese/ranch on the side.  We think it's Delish and it has been requested over and over.

I could not find hot red pepper sauce, so I used the closest equivalent I could find which was Chinese-style fermented chili paste with black beans.  The result was slightly sweeter than the original recipe intended, but it was nonetheless slightly sweet, rich, and oh so delicious.  The rest of my family also agreed.  This is a great recipe which will be worked into my family's diet with ease.  Thanks!

This was a nice change in pace from what I normally find to do with my salmon. However, I didn't have a 2lb fillet, so I decreased the ingredients proportionally. Nor did I know from reading the directions (maybe it's stupidity) whether or not to take the salmon out of the marinade and place it on another pan or just cook it in the dish it marinated in. TAKE IT OUT -- it's been a week and I'm still trying to scrape the burned sauce from the pan (And yes, I did use a smaller pan for marinating since I had less fish). But overall the flavor wasn't bad! Definitely something I may come back to after a while. :)

TOTALLY AWESOME!!!  Loved everything about this recipe...I followed the directions exactly (although I am not sure if my pepper sauce was the same kind, I used Sriracha Hot Chili Sauce).  Only downside....I should have doubled the sauce recipe!  SO GOOD!  You must try this!!

It was good, I enjoyed the flavor.   However, from reading other posts I thought it would be much more mild in heat.   So I gave this to my husband and now he has the hiccups, he gets them for days from spicy food.   I will make it again but next time less hot sauce (Tapatio) and more honey.

I thought this was very tasty, but way too hot (and we like hot food..)...and I only used 1/3 C of hot sauce.  My 4 year old couldn't even eat it.  Next time, I will go down to 1/4 C of hot sauce.

Just made this for dinner. Excellent. I chickened out at the last second on the amount of hot sauce ( Louisiana hot sauce ) and used only slightly less. I assure you it's not too spicy. My five year old loved it. Thanks for a great recipe!

This was amazing! Even my 7 year old son enjoyed it. I switched it up a little, and made the marinade with 1/4 cup hot red pepper sauce, and 1/4 cup chinese chili sauce (we like our food a little spicier), otherwise I followed the original recipe. It turned out fabulously!

Great! I served with white rice and egg drop soup.  We also ended up using extra sauce for drizzling and dipping. We loved it. Note: I am not a huge hot sauce fan but no need to worry about heat, I made just as recipe read. Note2: if you are wanting a strong salmon flavor in this recipe the salmon flavor itself does not stand out very much but the texture of the fish makes it.

The sauce on this salmon was phenomenal. I don't have an asbestos tongue, and the spice level was hot, but not too hot. The flavors married wonderfully and the sauce kept the salmon moist. I served with microwave brown rice and green beans. A delicious dinner with a beautiful presentation in half hour.

This was very good!  As with some of the other reviewers I was skeptical about the amount of hot sauce, but since I like spicy foods I tried it anyway, and it was terrific!  Made it just like the receipe.  Will definitely make it again.

I think the Marinade overpowered the fish flavor. I would probaly use less hot sauce next time and make sure that the temp of the hot sauce is less spicy. We like spicey but it was overpowering

I followed the recipe directions, but I was not a big fan of the marinade. I didn't like how the hot sauce (I used Crystal) and sweetness mixed. They really overpowered the fish. My husband thought it was okay, but I won't be making it again.

This was the best Salmon dish I have ever had.  I did not alter the recipe at all. My husband does not like fish at all, but he devoured this dish.  Thank you for a great recipe, I will be trying again and passing on to others.

I was dubious about using that much hot sauce but since no other review mentioned it, I thought it would be ok. Should have gone with my instincts. I like spicy foods, but the hot sauce overpowered the flavor of the fish. May try again with about a tablespoon of hot sauce.

Very tasty dish. The hot sauce is there but it's not overwhelming due to the brown sugar. I put the recommended amount of sugar didn't want it to be to sweet. It was amazingly easy to make. Will definitely be a repeat.

This recipe was easy to make and is tasty. I have used it on other types of filet and it worked out great.

I make this allll the time...I have tried it with tilapia & swai as well and it is always great! It is a staple fish recipe and I just use regular old Frank's hot sauce. I also use bottled lemon juice instead of fresh and its still great. Only change I make is I season the fish before I pour on the sauce. I serve it with broccoli & mashed potatoes and it is always a hit! Thank you for giving me a consistent, awesome fish recipe!

This is a great addition to your recipe collection! The salmon comes out sweet and also a little, tiny bit spicy. Nothing too overpowering. I personally omit the green onions but otherwise this recipe is good to go as is - just make sure to use Franks Red Hot sauce or something similar for the best flavor. Enjoy!

This fish recipe is really really good!!!  I made this ahead of time and ended up marinating the fish for about a day before baking it.  The spicy kick is well balanced with the sweet.  I can't taste the lemon, so I am not sure what the purpose of the lemon is.  I eat it with fresh green onion and red onion.  I am sure it's great with cilantro as well.  Yumm!!!! Thank you for posting this recipe!

I made this last night, exactly as written and we loved, loved, loved it. We eat a lot of salmon and my husband is very fussy about how it is served, so I wasn't sure how he would like it. I said maybe next time I would marinate it, then grill it, and he said it was brilliant the way it was. As there are only two of us, I cut the recipe in half and used hot wing sauce and YUM, YUM, YUM. Thank you so much for this recipe. It is definitely a keeper.

I am very inexperienced in the kitchen, so whenever I cook my fiance gets a little nervous.  He was SO impressed by this salmon, and even said I could make it for a dinner party.  Best of all, it's easy.  You could vary the amount of brown sugar to make it more spicy or sweet.  I'll probably make this once a week.

I made this with my homemade hotsauce so I knew it was going to be way too spicy for me. Husband, however, likes things hot so I threw a finely diced jalapeno in with the green onions. He really enjoyed it. Thanks!

I was so excited to try this recipe based on all the great reviews, but I ended up being disappointed with it.  Not sure what happened to mine, but it didn't turn out too great.  I made it for 3 servings and followed the recipe exactly.  It didn't have much flavor and the salmon taste was overpowering.  I couldn't find LA Gold or Crystals hot sauce, so maybe that was my problem.  The bottom was also oily.  Next time I will try to marinate it overnight and maybe try it with tilapia or shrimp instead.

This recipe was very good. 
In fact, this was the first time that I cooked a filet of salmon. I'm trying to learn how to cook and this recipe will definitely stay in my recipe box.
I stuck to the recipe except for a few things. I added lemon concentrate to the sauce because I didn't have any fresh lemon. I cut up one green onion and it was about a 1/2 cup instead of 1/4. I coated both sides of the fish with olive oil (lightly) I actually added the onions, salt, and pepper to the fish before the sauce (but that's because I left the sauce on heat too long and had to put it in the freezer to cool). I marinated the fish in the glass pan with the sauce overnight. My roommate and friend thought it was good also.
