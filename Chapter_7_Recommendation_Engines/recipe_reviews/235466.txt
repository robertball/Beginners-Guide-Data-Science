I am thrilled to be the first review of this recipe (minus the recipe submitter). I took her advice and added a 28 oz. can of diced tomatoes along with a pound of Italian sausage. I did use venison in place of the ground beef because this is what I keep ground venison around for and the only other change I made is that I subbed one of the green bell peppers with 2 large jalapeno's (one with seeds and one without). I was hesitant about the allspice but it worked nicely. This reminds me of my moms chili but she uses tomato paste and I much preferred the tomato juice and diced tomatoes. This makes a pretty thin chili (just how I like it) so you'd need to reduce the liquid somewhere if you are the kind that likes a fork to stand up in it. Loved the addition of beer and this will be my go to chili recipe for now. Thanks for sharing!

I recently changed this a little by adding a 28oz can of diced tomatoes as well as 3 hot and 3 mild italian sausage to add flavor.  I did not drain the tomatoes but I did in fact leave the lid off and it made it way more thick and way better.  You can add cayenne or jalapenos as well if you like it really spicy.

I loved where cincychic was going with this.  Great recipe,  I cooked it as is but stayed low on the liquids (I like me chili chunky).  Will continue to work this recipe until it's just right to my liking.  Good stuff here!

I did not care for this recipe. I made it exactly as stated and consider myself a good cook. We love to try new chili recipes but there was something off for us, I'm guessing the allspice.

Hubby liked this. Me, not so much. I love dark beer but this was just a 
Tad  too bitter for me. Added additional sugar, but still did not season to my taste.

Made this for New Years Day. Everyone loved it. Since we had a varying age group, I cut the chili powder amount in half.  I also made it the day before and refrigerated it overnight which enhanced the flavor.
