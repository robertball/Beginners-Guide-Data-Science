I was a little afraid to try this recipe, because it only had two reviews and they weren't really good. However, I had everything on hand for it. I noticed both reviewers said it was bland, and that salt and pepper were missing from the ingredients. So I added kosher salt and pepper, paprika, and thyme to the flour. I also salted the onions and garlic as I was cooking them, and it seemed to be the touch it needed. This was excellent!! My 5 year old loved it!! And he doesn't like anything. :) We are gonna add this to my list of favorites.

I made this and did enjoy but looking back, why not cook the onions and the garlic before the chicken? I believe that would solve some of the 'needs more flavor' type comments.....! Always in retrospect, right? Next time!

Quick and easy weeknight supper.  I agree with the more seasoning required.

I did as the other reviewers suggested and made the onion/garlic  first and added salt and pepper.  Was delicious!  Will make again.

I made this for lunch once, following the recipe, adding salt & pepper while cooking the onions.  The second time I added seasonings to the flour (rosemary,  thyme, sage, salt & pepper),  used about 1 1/2 times the garlic, replaced the onion with shallots and I added a thinly sliced poblano pepper (before it went bad).  Much more tinkering and it will be a different recipe but I will make this again.

Quick and easy with common ingredients.  I added a pinch of himalayan sea salt. My husband and I loved it.  Will definitely make again.

I tried this recipe and it was pretty good but you have to ensure that you salt and pepper your chicken before cooking it.
