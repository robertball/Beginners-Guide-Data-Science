Low sodium broth, or homemade broth + low salt or no-salt-added peanut butter will greatly lower the sodium content. of this recipe.

Made this tonight, exactly per recipe, with sushi rice. It was alright although it mainly just made me crave a local Thai restaurant. It's not very spicy. I think it could be improved, but I probably won't make it again. If I were to make it again I'd cut back on the beef broth. The sauce was a bit thin.

We loved this. The flavor is very mild - not at all spicey.  Worked wonderfuly with a peanut noodle dish and a super spicey cucumber salad. I didn't peel the potatoes before chunking them up which helped them hold up to the long cooking process. This will be a go to meal on busy weeknights.

I cheated a little-- I added a little bit of cayenne for kick and cashew paste to make it a little thicker, then served it over rice.. super easy and yummy!

Great recipe, the only alteration I made was using a low-sodium broth and cutting back a bit on the sugar. I added a bit of spice by chopping up a couple of dried red chillies and it worked out pretty good.

For reviews who stated this recipe is bland, I researched MUSSAMAN curry: it's supposed to be a RICH,  MILD curry. Caveat Thai mild is not USA mild! This recipe is a solid base and can be 5 stars (maybe not Thai 5 star) with a few adjustments:
When browning meat: add garlic cloves & pepper of your choice ( I used 5 dried chile de arbol). Tip: If chiles are not cut open exposing seeds it really lessens the spiciness. 
High quality peanut butter matters!! Use fresh grind or an unsweet type (I used "Tree of Life" crunchy PB). I used a generous helping of PB and increased coconut milk by about a 1/2 can. 
To the crock pot I added: 1 stick cinnamon and 4 dried lime leaves (Keffir if you can find), also kept those dried chiles in. Added 1 more large fresh garlic clove to pot with 1 hour of cook time left.  More optional pot adds: white pepper, tamarind paste, fresh lemongrass (I didn't have these on hand). When cooking is finished discard the chiles. 
SERVING TOPPINGS: try pickled ginger, cilantro or roasted peanuts. 
I chose to serve steamed broccoli and carrots on the side with this dish.  The whole dish was flavorful, rich and super delicious.  I will make it again!

Good, but not great.  Really lacked flavor and heat.  I'll use it as a base again, but it needs something . . .

I left the beef broth completely out of this recipe.  Maybe it's my slow cooker (it's an old one), but adding that much liquid usually makes the final dish come out thin and bland.  That being said, without the beef broth, this was wonderful.  Nice and thick and creamy.  I added some red pepper flakes for heat and we enjoyed it over rice.  Thanks for the recipe.

Great slow cooker recipe.  I used vegetable broth and fried crispy tofu to make this a vegetarian meal. Hard tofu cut into cubes, tossed in Bisquick, bread crumbs and pan-fried in a garlic butter.  I threw the tofu in about 5-7 mins before the cook time was over to get some curry flavor on them and still keep them crispy.

loved this recipe and so did my husband! the few steps to prep before going into the slow cooker wasn't as "time consuming" as I initially had thought. I accidentally forgot the garlic, but we didn't notice at all.. we used udon noodles to accompany the curry, it was so good and will make this again and again!

Delicious!  I wanted a thicker sauce so used about a 1/2 cup peanut butter and only 1 cup beef broth. I served it over Jasmine rice. This recipe is a keeper.

Very happy with how this turned out. I modified the recipe a bit: I used chicken instead of beef, and added 4 small tomatoes an hour before the slow cooker was done. The chicken was soft and juicy, and the tomatoes added a nice little tang. served it with white rice and some sauteed greens.

The only substitution I made was red curry paste in place of curry powder, and my husband said its the best Asian dish I've made. Just the right amount of heat. The sauce is thin, but not any thinner than if I ordered it from our favorite Thai place. This recipe will definitely become a staple for our house.

This was terrific!! My husband usually orders this dish at our local Thai restaurant and you could tell he and the kids loved it because it was the quietest meal we've had in a long time (kids aged 6,3,&3!)!  I ran it in the crockpot for 3 hours on high and it came out fine. I added baby carrots 1.5 hours in and most of them were cooked perfectly but some were still a little crunchy. I served over coconut rice and it was Amazing!

After reading other reviews, I added a dash of cayenne for spice.  I also used chicken stock instead of beef broth simply because that's what we had in the cabinet, and I thickened the sauce with corn starch at the end because it was really thin.  So delicious!   I think it would have been a tad bland for my taste without the cayenne, but it was fantastic with it!  Next time I would also add more potatoes.  Yum!

I loved this! Changed a few things - first browned beef, then added garlic, just for 30 sec (and more, about 5 or 6 cloves), in the slow cooker, then sauteed onion for a couple of minutes in same pan and put in slow cooker. Also substituted about 1 tablespoon of curry powder with spicy red curry paste, which added a lot of flavor. I had more beef , more like 1.5 pounds, but still reduced the broth by about half. End result was delicious! I forgot about adding the peanuts, but that did not matter and I sprinkled dish with fresh cilantro

I used two medium sweet potatoes and two carrots instead of regular potatoes and light coconut milk and it turned out great.  The calories are about 40%, fat about 20%, carbs about 60% of the original recipe.

I made it with two large chicken breasts in stead of beef, curry paste instead of powder, more potatoes to feed a couple more people and didn't have time for slow cooking because I didn't plan ahead so just cooked it over the stove in about an hour. Served it over coconut rice made in the rice cooker with a can of coconut water, water, sugar and a little salt. It was AWESOME. It was nice and creamy... always my favorite!!!

We made this recipe using chicken and chicken broth instead of beef.  It turned out great.  It wasn't as spicy as I might have wanted and I will use a bit more curry next time..
