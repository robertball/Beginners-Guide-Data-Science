A nice recipe.  I love carrots just the way they are.  This recipe might get those on the fence about carrots to give them a try.  I don't think I would use fresh from the garden carrots for this, as they are usually pretty sweet.  But it does help perk up store bought carrots that don't tend to be as sweet.  Thanks!

Absolutely delicious!  My family ate this up like it was going out of style.  And so easy!  I made it as a side to go with Maple Salmon and garlic mashed potatoes.  Will definitely make again! I cut out one tablespoon of butter, and it turned out just as good.

These were excellent! I made two small changes - had some baby carrots that needed used, so I used those, and I added about 1/4 t. cinnamon. Even my 3.5 year old asked for seconds!

Simple, but sometimes simple is the best! I've made these several times now, and every once in a while I have a moisture problem with the carrots that prevents the glaze from getting thick. Just add some more brown sugar and cook it a little longer in the "glazing step" and it'll be fine. Top it with some chopped parsley so it's beautiful! If you don't have white pepper, black pepper is nearly the same (a little stronger)..white pepper is pretty much used to prevent black specks in your dish, which isn't a problem here with the darker glaze.

This is a good base recipe. I confess, the 5 stars are for the results of my alterations. I used half honey & half brown sugar. I used the zest & juice of half a large lemon. And I added 1/4 tsp of ground ginger. Yum!

This is one of my favorite recipes for carrots.  I got my children and grandchildren to love them.  To make a change in the flavor pallet I add a 1/2 tsp cinammon, 1/2+ tsp vanilla, and a dash of nutmeg.  It becomes mock glazed yams and goes great with chicken and dressing and savory green beans.

I made this tonite for dinner and it was super easy and delicious.  The only thing I added as a tsp. of cinnamon and I used baby carrots without cutting them up.  My whole family said to make it again.

The flavor is fantastic! Know that if you're using baby carrots (as pictured) vs carrot sticks as noted in the recipe, simmering for 10 minutes will leave them still quite crunchy in the middle.

I'm not a huge fan of carrots but I loved this recipe!  Sure easy and quick, and a great way to add some flavor to any meal.  I didn't make any changes at all- I was even able to get my picky two year old to eat some, which is always a major plus!

I have always made glazed carrots the traditional way.  Cooking raw carrots in butter and sugar until the carrots were done and the sugar/butter carmelized.  But you always had to watch so carefully at the end because the sugar could burn from one minute to the next.... This was so much easier, and they tasted just as good.  Thank you

Liked the recipe as it, but next time will double the butter/brown sugar glaze.  Family liked the dish very much, and it's different than the ho hum veggies that I usually prepare.

Very good, just enough sweetness without losing the taste of the carrots. Just before serving I sprinkled a sliced almond/dried cranberry mixture on top.

I liked them but they weren't anything for me to rave about. I'm not sure if they needed more of something in order to avoid them drying out. the glaze is ok, but if they are sitting in a dish for some time they seem to dry out. They taste fine.. like carrots. I will make them again, because I love carrots.

Very quick and easy. I like it... Will add more butter and sugar next time though... Also best to cook it in a medium sized pot rather than a big one.

This was a big hit! I cut my carrots longer than pictured, mainly for aesthetics and added a tiny bit of maple syrup to the glaze (just because I had it, I don’t think it needed it). It turned out really good! The sauce thickened after it sat for a bit, so I probably should’ve gave it some time before serving. Oh well, now I know for next time! I will definitely be making these again.

Brought for Christmas and was a hit.  I did end up adding a little more butter and Brown sugar just be a use it didn't look like enough sauce.  Not much .more and probably would've been just as good without adding.

I basically doubled the amount of butter and used baby carrots. Margarine also works as a substitute for butter.

Before any recipe goes into my personal home cookbook it has to pass the test as is according to the original recipe, other than that I adjust to make it acceptable to book worthy. I can honestly say I tried it three times as written and it was heaven in your mouth all three times. I highly recommend this, especially for how easy of a side this could be to complete that meal of yours that is just missing something.

I prepared a single serving, cutting the recipe to one-eighth. (Thank you, AllRecipes, for the scaling service!)

I used fat whole baby carrots (as pictured) and simmered 10 minutes. They were not quite as tender as I wanted; I think a few more minutes would have improved them.

I did not stir the carrots continuously, but periodically as I was doing other final meal preparations. Otherwise, I followed the directions exactly.

That said, the recipe was as simple as described, and very tasty - just what I was looking for.

This recipe is so easy and delicious! I used fresh carrots out of the garden, no white pepper because I didn’t have any. 
My husband loved them as did I. I will definitely make these again!

We liked our carrots to be a little more tender, so after the initial simmering of the carrots, we put them in with the glaze and covered the carrots for an additional 5-7 minutes to get to a more desirable tenderness.

I'm usually a fan of carrots by themselves, but the sauce was a nice touch!

I cut carrots in 1" pieces and followed recipe exactly with the same exception that I grated some orange peel for a little bit of zing.  White pepper makes a difference and I recommend you stick with it.

So I'm a Adult who hates the taste of cooked carrots and i doubt the glaze would hide that taste, I Add 1 tsp sugar, salt and chicken powder seasoning when boiling & after draining, butter with brown sugar, i probably add less brown sugar as i added sugar to the water. The best carrots i ever consumed :)

This recipe is very easy to make. Made it for Christmas dinner with the family, everyone liked it. Only gave it 4 stars because I'd prefer the flavor to be baked into the carrots. Next time I'm going to try partially cooking the carrots, make the glaze and then bake for a while. But the recipe is still good as is.

It was fast and easy to make. I took it over to the family Christmas dinner, and everyone seemed to like it. I will likely use this recipe again when I need a quick and simple veggie dish to add to a meal.

This was so easy and so delicious! I made it as a last minute side for Christmas dinner and it was a hit!! Not too sweet, just enough!! You can add a little extra salt/ and a little less brown sugar if you want it even less sweet. I recommend this recipe!!

These carrots are the bomb!  I added about 1/8 teaspoon ground ginger and 4 tablespoons orange juice (heavy pulp).  I steamed the carrots until they were fork tender, melted the butter and added the brown sugar, oj, pepper, and ginger while steaming the carrots, then combined them in a bowl then arranged them on a serving platter.  I got major 'yums' from my family.

My raw carrots were bitter, so I added extra sugar and some maple syrup. Also there was liquid / melted butter in the bottom of the pot. I poured it off, let it cool,  whisked in some corn starch and stirred back into the carrots. A bit more simmering to thicken and the result was a nice glaze that adhered to the carrots to  help counteract the bitterness.

It was okay, not nearly as brown sugary as I thought they would be though. Next time I would add more brown sugar. Otherwise they were good.

I used not just water but also ginger beer (which I made a couple weeks ago). I also used multi-colored “organic” baby-ish carrots, so there was purple and gold, as well as the standard orange ones. That was sexy; the water I strained out from the earlier step turned out purple and gingery.

These were really good, my husband who is a savory guy even loved them. We will add them to our rotation. As another reviewer suggested, I added some cinnamon and we used large carrots in chunks so it took a bit longer than written.

I made this using the suggestions of a few reviewers, including a bit of added cinnamon and less sugar for garden carrots, but I used a scant 1/4 c. pure maple syrup instead of brown sugar. Delicious! Will certainly make this again. Everyone loved it.

Excellent; husband had 3 helpings.  I microwaved half package of baby carrots 'til tender, the glazed in a skillet with the butter and brown sugar.  Will definitely make this quick, easy and delicious recipe again.

Simple and sufficient brown sugar to enhance the carrot sweetness without turning it to candy.  My 18 month is a huge veggie fan already but gobbled this up before anything else on her plate.

Pretty good! If you find the sauce to be too syrupy at the end, just sprinkle a little flour on the carrots and mix them in.

I made this exactly as the recipe said, except no white pepper. It was excellent! I used brown sugar, but I might try it with maple syrup next time to cut down on the sugar.

I made these for  Christmas today and they were just OK.  I used  baby carrots and followed the directions exactly.  The carrots didn't have much flavor.  Will not make this again, just too bland.

I give this recipe 5 stars because it's quick, simple and good. Not too sweet, not too pretentious and ingredients can be found at any kind of grocery store anywhere worldwide. I substituted the brown sugar with real maple syrup because the syrup was close by, salted the water I boiled the carrots in and kept everything else the same. It was the first time I used this recipe and it came out perfect.

Delicious! I am not generally a fan of carrots in any way, shape, or form, but I enjoyed these. You can hardly go wrong with butter and brown sugar, but that little hint of white pepper takes it over the top. I will definitely make these again.

Too much butter, sugar. Carrots were over sweetened to my taste. Even my kids (ages 9, 13) didn't care for it, and they're usually pretty good about eating their veggies.

I love these. I like to pull my carrots out when they are still firm. Once you return it to the sauce plus the resting time they will cook up some more. And I boil up my sugar and salt sauce not sure if that was mentioned.

I made the recipe as written.  When I got to the glazing step the glaze was thick and sticky like I would expect it to be, with a good flavor.  But, after cooking the carrots in the glaze for 5 minutes, as directed, the glaze was thin and watery and did not stick to the carrots.  Another reviewer suggested adding more brown sugar when this happens.  I might try this recipe again and try this tip.

These were allright but I probably won't make it again becaus the glaze was runny and was much better with some spices (cinnamon, ginger, and allspice).  I liked that the carrots are pretty firm, other recipes call to cook the carrots much longer and you get mush.

I made this for a large family cookout.  I used 15 lbs of carrots, and they were gone before the ribs, steak, burgers, and salads/side dishes.  Everyone loved them - from the adults clear down to the little ones.  Sometimes simple is definitely best!  Excellent dish!

I picked this recipe because it looked like a good, quick, and easy recipe for glazed carrots. My problem is that the actual instructions were too "easy." There's no detail in how to make the glaze. I've now tried making it twice and both times ended up with a giant caramel wafer and had to use a different recipe at the last minute.

These turned out great.  Just for fun I used multi colored and they were fun.  For something different give them a try in the delicious recipe.

This was delicious! I followed the recipe as is except I had some cinnamon/sugar mix that I had in my cupboard that I sprinkled on top. I only had a small bag of baby carrots to use. Next time, I'm making at lease twice as much.  I sending this recipe to my son and his wife to try. It was so easy and so delicious!!

I made this completely last minute as part of a Christmas Turkey meal and everyone loved them! I don't eat veggies, so I didn't try them. They were so easy and I didn't change anything, I will definitely make them throughout the year (mostly for special occasions since they're not very healthy!).

Excellent recipe and super easy using only three ingredients.  I  cheated and used canned baby carrots.   Drained them well, put them in the pot with butter and brown sugar until the sugar was bubbly and carrots were coated. (Left out the salt and pepper as canned vegetables already have salt.)  Removed the carrots to a Pam coated baking dish then reduced the sauce mixture to desired thickness.  Poured over the carrots coating all of them well and set in the oven under the broiler to further caramelize.  Watch closely or they will burn.  Next time I might add some crushed red pepper for that sweet and spicy flavor.  Yum!

This was way too sweet. I like sweet glazed carrots but this was over the top for my family. I will try it again but will definitely cut back the sugar and see where we end up.

I  looked at other glazed carrots recipes and ended up adding a teaspoon or two of rosemary.  I also added a lot more salt and pepper to accommodate my specific taste.

Amazing taste, main thing I changed was the onions. I diced them instead and cooked them in the butter for a few minutes. Really helped bring out the flavour. 

Another thing that helps is they type of cheese you use. Watch for what is on sale in your area and if possible use old cheddar cheese. I sprinkled some parmessan on top after. Everyone loved it!

Made these tonight with dinner. They were great. I did cook them longer in glaze to allow it to soak in carrots. I enjoy cooking different recipes and I will use this one again.

Really good! I added a little bit of cinnamon as suggested by other reviewers. Didn't have any white pepper but I used ground black pepper and it worked just fine. I was pleasantly surprised how nicely this amount of glaze perfectly coated such a big amount of carrots. Made this as a side dish for a meal cooked for four people. We have plenty left over but I'm not complaining!

My kids eat meat like it's going out of style but this time the vegetables, this recipe, was the dish they couldn't get enough of. I sliced regular sized carrots so they are like disks (vs cutting long sliced). I boiled till they were to the tenderness we like (slightly hard but not crunchy). Next time I'll use less butter and more brown sugar and some cinnamon, like other reviewers have suggested.

Very easy to make and great just as the recipe is written but also leaves room to alter it to your own family's taste. I added a dash of cayenne pepper and just a tad of nutmeg to it. It turned out sweet and savory with a tiny bit of heat in the after note. I feel like the nutmeg added a savory note to it.  I make these just as the recipe states when I'm feeding people who don't care too much for hot peppers. This will definitely be a staple recipe to use up carrots from our garden. I have even made them with frozen crinkle cut carrots when I'm in a hurry and they're still awesome.

I didn't use white pepper, just a touch of fresh ground black pepper.  my 3 yr old daughter, who hates carrots, ate 1/4 cup!  I also didn't use baby carrots.  I used a mandoline slicer to cut them thick, on the dias (at an angle). made if faster to cook and reduced the "carrot" flavor. even my 5 yr old son who REFUSES ANY veggie, tried and ATE one slice!!!  now THAT'S a great recipe!!!

I tried this recipe and loved it! I added ginger paste and black pepper since I didn't have white, but it turned out great! A simple recipe with great flavor. It went over well with my husband, and he's a meat and potatoes kind of guy! It's a great way to introduce new vegetables to a picky eater.

Made this for our Christmas dinner and everyone just raved and there was nothing left.  It went round and round the table until nothing was to be had.  I doubled the recipe and  also used a bit of added honey.. This will go to a pot luck for sure.

I read others reviews.  This is a great go to recipe but I just gave it 3 because it's basic.  If you have a family with a simple palette (mine) this one is for you!  However, if you have a more adventures (i.e., cooking family) I would follow the recommendations of others and include a little cinnamon, nutmeg, perhaps honey, maple syrup or even cook down some dark rum like you would with sweet potatoes.  It was nice to please the picky eaters with this dish.  I used light brown sugar - I think dark would be too strong and over power the taste of the carrots.

I made this recipe for my sons wedding reception.I made enough to feed 90 people.  I have to confess I used canned carrots and everyone raved over the them. I have a request to make them again for Thanksgiving. We will definitely make this recipe over and over again.

Really good. My husband and two sons don't usually like cooked carrots but they liked these. Made it with organic carrots (orange, yellow and white carrots)

Would have been significantly better with more temperature guidance. Sugar got way too hot and started to caramelize.

Good! But it took a lot longer than 5 minutes to get a thick glaze.

Super easy and gives the carrots just enough added richness and flavor to not be bland.

Just a little touch of added sweetness, not overpowering. I preferred to steam the carrots until almost done. I then combined the remaining ingredients in a pan, added the carrots, sauteed for about 5 more min and topped with parsley. These were very good, but I'd personally like a bit more flavor (garlic powder, seasoned salt?). Thanks for the nice, easy recipe!

I followed the directions exactly as written and there was no glaze, just a few hard blobs of brown sugar and melted butter. I will not be making this recipe again.

How could anything you put butter and brown sugar on Not be good? Steamed fresh carrots w/ 1/2 tsp of white sugar is a staple around our house.

Delicious recipe.  I steamed the carrots (personal preference), and then added them into the butter sauce to glaze.  Sweet with just enough spice. Yum!

I loved the simplicity of this recipe, although I did reduce the brown sugar by half, which seemed to be the perfect amount of sweetness for my baby carrots.  Thanks for the recipe, trishthedish!
