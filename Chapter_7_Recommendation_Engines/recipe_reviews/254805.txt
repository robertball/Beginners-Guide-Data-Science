Not my favorite. Batter was watery and flavor was lacking.

Delicious!  I could see making these smaller and serving them as a side dish to just about anything. The flavor is fine as is, but I am gonna try to play around with them maybe adding some cheese or other spices. They reminded us on potato pancakes, but with zucchini added.  All in all, this was a great little recipe and one I will be making again~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

Instead of making these in the waffle maker I fry them in a cast iron skillet. using a small amount dropped the skillet. Sometimes I add a dash of Italian seasoning.  They freeze well so I make a double bath and freeze. I use them instead of hash brown for breakfast, as a side, left over pasta sauce on top, sour cream........ endless ideas. The Grandkids love them.

I made these. The first waffle, didn’t stay together at all. So I made the next waffle very full, realizing that they probably won’t run out of the maker. It didn’t... but the waffle still fell apart. The taste is just ok. I will probably play with this recipe, adding some cheese maybe and more of a batter of the potatoes. Then I will just make pancakes, as I hate cleaning my non stick waffle maker as much as I have to this time. ??

I made them this morning, and since we didn't have any tart jam, I whipped up some strawberry jalapeño salsa, and that went really well with sour cream to top them!
