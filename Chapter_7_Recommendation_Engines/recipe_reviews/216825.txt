I was surprised at how good these actually were. I used green onions and butcher bacon (its a bit thicker). Make sure that you let the cream cheese reach room temp. They came out soft and chewy and addictive! My 1 year old ate three in one sitting. Enjoy!

Absolutely loved these! I sauteed the onions in the bacon greese to give them a little more flavor and take out some of the bite. Will for sure be making these again.

These were good but I altered a few things.  1st - I used the pilsbury dough sheet and log rolled it, instead of crescent rolls.  I sliced it before baking for 10 min at 375.  Much easier and more consistent size for presentation this way.  I added more bacon and shaved parm instead of grated.  The entire group loved them!  Will make again, for sure.

This recipe was awesome! I went over to an aunt's house and made this for a family gathering while almost my whole family was there. I have a little cousin that is a very picky eater and asks alot of questions when he eats things. I was so unsure that he wouldn't like this that I didn't even offer him any.Well he asked to try it and he loved it. My whole family was shocked. Before I went home his mom asked for the recipe. After the dish was gone I still had some ingredients left except for cream cheese. Well my little cousin begged his mom to go to the supermarket and get more cream cheese so I could make more like right away. My family loved this dish and we make it all the time now. The only difference was that we didn't use onions. Oh and once I made them the second time I used regular dinner roll biscuits instead of crescent rolls. I was surprised that the children in my family even loved this dish.

Great recipe! Very rich and a bit salty from the bacon, but the flavor is awesome! I did use less onions though- the called for amount seemed too much- especially if you don't sautee the onions first.

Made this for a New Year's Eve party and the guests loved them. Assembled them several hours ahead of time and stored in refrigerator. Then baked at the party for a few minutes longer than recipe called for while visiting with friends. It's a keeper - thanks for sharing!

These were good, but I felt like the crescent roll overpowered the filling.  It was hard to roll up enough filling to balance out the crescents though.

This is so easy and makes a great snack/appy.  I made it for gameday food while watching football, and we loved it.  I used the chive and onion cream cheese, and omitted the onions, and it was great!

I've been making these for years, and everyone loves them.  I often use 1/3 less fat cream cheese and reduced fat crescents to lighten them up a bit.  I gave up pork several years ago and now substitute 'Bacon Bacon' from Tastefully Simple in place of the bacon (and skip the onion).  They would also be good and healthier with turkey bacon.

Made these for a party. Tried one out before I put them in the container. It was really good but when I got to the party they were on the soft side. Keeping in the container to the party they got steamed so the crescents got soft but were still good. Its still a keeper.

This was an absolute hit at a friends party. Though I made some distinct changes. I used a thick cut of Bacon, real shredded parmisan cheese,  I also cooked the onions with garlic and a touch of olive oil till the onions were translucent. It added a sweetness while accentuating the natural smokiness of the Bacon. Over all an awsome base recipe, especially with how is it is to customize.

Thank you.

Yeah, couldn't stop eating these!!  I did saute onions in the bacon grease after frying the bacon.  And I found flavored cream cheese instead of adding parsley to regular cream cheese. So amazingly good!

I used the flat sheet dough and cut it in half.  Once I finished the mixture (which I wish I would have sautéed the onions in the bacon grease first), I laid out the mixture and rolled the dough around it like a log.  I sprinkled the Parmesan cheese before cooking and cut them into bite size pieces.  It was a little bit onion strong but good none the lesd

My guests really enjoyed this easy, quick recipe, but  I think it would be better and be more satisfying if ham or turkey was added to the recipe.  Mine were ready after 10 minutes.

Awesome.  They are always gone before I get the chance to eat any :)  I use a little less onion, but that is just a taste preference.  Or sometimes onion powder instead of using any onions at all.  My family always asks for them.

I loved this.  Made it for a church social.  I found garden vegetable cream cheese and used that instead.  Yummy!  Also agree with the other poster, makes a great dip for crackers, etc.

These were tasty but I agree with another reviewer that the crescent roll over powers the filling and getting enough stuffing in them is hard.  Still good though!

Although yummy stuff in the filling, there was too much dough/bread. Probably won't make again. However, might make the filling to spread on crackers!

It's perfect as is! No suggestion. These go so quick. I could eat them all myself. They are delicious and so quick and easy! I've been asked for the recipe by my family members and it is always a hit!

I made these for a dinner party. Everybody LOVED them and while I was making them I discovered the filling would make a killer dip. I did have to season the filling as it was a bit bland. I would recommend these to anybody who likes bacon, cream cheese and crescent rolls.

I have made these many times with only cream cheese/chives and onions and just bacon, and they are so good. I can't wait to make them this way, its sounds wonderful.

These are great and everyone always eats them up quickly.  The only variation I do is cook the onions in the bacon grease after cooking the bacon.  It makes a little difference but it tastes even better!

SUPER AWESOME! Would recommend that you make double the filling - so it completely fills the "mini" Crescent rolls. Any left over after that can be baked and used as chip dip!

These are delicious, and they were a huge hit. Next time I make them, though, I'm going to add green chiles, just for variation. 

Variations I made this time:
1. Onion powder for the minced onions, because we're not huge fans of the onion texture in this house. The flavor was still good. 
2. Shredded Parmesan, rather than the powdered Kraft stuff.
3. Sprinkled the top with sesame seeds before baking.

I made this according to the recipe, and as many of us are familiar with, had some challenges. The dough amounts in particular were too little to make something that wasn't completely messy. As my guests were more interested in the taste, it went over quite well & I'll keep the recipe and tweak it to make more dough, and a slightly less liquid mixture.

They were very easy to make and super delicious! They only thing I did different was sauté the onions in some of the bacon grease.  I think raw onions would have been too strong.  Everyone in my Sunday school class said they were delicious and wanted to know what was in them!

I really liked the smoky bacon flavor in these rolls! The filling can be made in advance, but you’ll need to heat it up slightly before spreading it on the dough.

I made this for a dinner party and it was a hit.  Everyone liked it, including my husband who can be somewhat picky. I did not make any changes.  However, it did take me longer to make then expected.  The crescent rolls were difficult for me to work with.  If I make this again, I think I will do what others suggested which is to make it in a roll and then slice it.  This is my first review ever!

I made this to take to friend's house for a Fourth of July Celebration. However, I was running late, and didn't have have to bake the crescent rolls, so I simply used ritz crackers. It turned out just fine.

Excellent!! Tonight's pre-Thanksgiving get together was a success! Many requests for recipe. I used some green & some sauteed onions.
Thank You! To the recipe poster & to Trac689 because she reviewed this in 2011 & said she uses the pillsbury refrigerator pie dough. That I had!! And personally easier for uniformity/cooking time.

I have never seen anything fly off the plate as fast as these did.  I was in a hurry so didn't cut the crescent rolls in half and so doubled the filling amount but it didn't matter.  Cooking time was the same and they were delicious.  I chose to sauté the onion (I had green onion on hand and 1/2 cup uncooked made about 1/4 cup cooked) since kids were present, as other reviewers suggested.  Amazing!  I will definitely make again.

I made the recipe as printed for the first round.  Found the filling a little too chunky to spread nicely.  For the second batch I put the filling in the food processor and it made for a much more spreadable ffilling.  I like some reviewers idea to sauté  the onion in bacon fat before adding and will try that next time.  All in all, a very delicious bite!

I made this for a get-together with friends.  They all raved over it.  It went very fast.  I followed others suggestions and sautéed the onions.  Instead of cooking the bacon, I bought the precooked bacon that is already cut in small pieces.  Great taste!  I will make this again.

These were really good. I did take the advice of sauteing the onion with the bacon. However, I didn't think there would be enough filling for 32 of these, so I only used one package of crescent rolls. Next time I fix it, I will double the cream cheese and parmesan, leaving everything else the same, so I can make enough to fill all 32 that the recipe calls for.

I made these for a group of 30 teenagers having a progressive dinner. These were by far their favorite appetizer. I did not make enough because they loved them so much. They made comments after dessert at the last house that they wished they could come back and have more of these.

Fantastic!  We made these for Christmas and everyone loved them.  I skipped the onions, because I don't care for them.  And I used Oscar Meyer bacon bits, because I was feeling lazy about crumbling real bacon.  I'm finding excuses to make them again.
