Saw this recipe this morning, and decided to make it.   These scones were very delicious. Just finished one with a cup of coffee.  Not too sweet.  Perfect.

Delish!! I love that this is more of a British Scone with the inclusion of eggs. Crispy on the outside, soft, buttery and flaky on the inside, couldn't get any better texture wise! I made the buttermilk with lemon juice and milk as I wanted more of a lemon flavor. And they baked for 25 minutes in my oven. I didn't add the nuts either, so I used extra cranberries and served with a dollop of lemon curd. One tip, make sure to space them out at least two inches on the baking sheet as they spread and puff up quite a bit. You might want to make two batches as these will go fast!

These are delicious! I just ate more of them than I care to admit with tea. :) I didn't have hazelnuts so used almonds instead, and added 1/2 tsp almond extract to the batter. Other than that I didn't change anything. They were done much, much earlier than 30 minutes, though--after 15 minutes they were almost overdone.

These were okay. I had hoped for much better results based on the reviews but they were just  average.  It seems there was a bit much liquid for the amount of flour. I'll give them another go and reduce the eggs to just one or use less buttermilk.

I've made these three times, they are great with a cup of coffee or tea. I used 1/2 cup whipping cream with a table spoon of lemon juice in it instead of buttermilk twice and used sour cream once and dried cranberries but keep forgetting to buy hazelnuts, both methods seemed to work fine, 30 min seems too long, more like 20/22

This recipe is just wonderful - definitely gift-worthy.  Wouldn't change a thing.  (I did use dried cranberries, without soaking them in advance.  Still fabulous.)
