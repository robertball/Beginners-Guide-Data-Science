I made this twice, the first time with the egg and the second time without and I definately reccomend leaving the egg out if you don't want the meatloaf texture!  It tasted great and will be making it again!

A truly excellent take on the standard burger-on-a-grill. I won't bother with the telling you what I added or subtracted... most grillers have their own "special" ingredients that they swear by...
I'll mention two things that seem to be a recurring theme. One is cooking the bacon and the burger together. This is caused by the thickness of the bacon, and the heat of the grill. If you're using standard grocery-store bacon, then you're probably fine with a high-heat grill; however, if you're working with a thick slab bacon, you might want to slightly lower the grill temperature and give the burger time to catch up with the bacon...

The other issue is how the burgers hold up on the grill., and this is partially due to the binding proteins in the egg. If you're following the recipe and using 1 lb of hamburger, then only use 1/2 an egg. Once you've got it mixed in, form into patties, and let rest (covered) in the refrigerator for at least an hour... longer, if you have the time.
Even so, they're still a bit tender on the grill, so make sure that you preheat the grill, then scrape the grill with a wire brush. Finally, put some veggie oil on a paper towel, and rub down the grill, just before cooking. This should keep the grill slick, and reduce the chance of them breaking apart.
With the exception of reducing the egg by 1/2, I would strongly recommend that you try this recipe, as written. Even if you're not of fan of onions, you just might be surprised at what you taste... keep the

I dont know what JVDMD did wrong, but these burgers are absolutely fantastic!  I made them for a dinner at our annual cottage family reunion and they were a huge success!! Everyone raved, and every last burger was devoured.  Even my aunt, who eats nothing, ate THREE!! They were honestly the best burger I have ever eaten, at home or at a restaurant.  I must admit I did make a couple changes, but that was only to suit the tastes of my family (We LOVE garlic).  I was using about 6lbs of groundbeef, so to the recipe I added 3 cloves of garlic, a dash of Clubhouse Garlic Plus seasoning, and a dash of oregano.  I added less Worcestershire sauce, and omitted the ketchup, instead adding a spicy bbq sauce (exact amount unknown but greater than the amount of ketchup called for).  I also left out the Parmesan and added extra cheddar, onion and black pepper.  Once again, these are the most delicious burgers!!!! Thanks so much for the recipe!! ^_^

Juicy, but the burgers have to be handled with care.  To ensure crispy bacon, cook it to soft stage before using on the burgers.  This also helps reduce the amount of flare-ups from excess bacon grease.

My boyfriend and I loved these! I chose to cook them in a skillet though, as I was afraid the bacon would stick to the grill or fall off. I wrapped them from top to bottom, rather than around the sides. Frying them slowly made the  bacon come out just right, and the meat cooked through. I put Swiss cheese on them, with dijon mustard and mayo...YUM!! Will definately make again!

I loved these. A lot of people wrote that the bacon took too long to cook. We did not have that problem. I just bought some cheap bacon from Aldi and it worked great. Plus, my husband laughed at making 6 burgers from a pound of meat. He made 3 burgers instead and really they were perfect size. Great recipe!

May sound crazy - but I make these with cream cheese instead of cheddar and/or parmasean, bread crumbs and more pepper!  I mix up the meat without the cheese, roll into ball and burrow a teaspoon or so of cream cheese into ball, flatten out into patty, wrap the bacon and grill!  Juicy & Yum, Yum, Yum!!

Juicy it is but the burger does not hold together well and the bacon does not get very done standing on edge like that. Need to adjust the recipe to discard the bacon after the burger is cooked and do something to make the meat hold together better.

These are fabulous! Word of CAUTION: Do you have a water bottle nearby for flames/flare-ups from bacon grease. These are the juicest burgers ever! I think I will put some foil down & poke holes in it next time...

While watching a cooking show I had seen someone prepare burgers like this...I hoped that there was a recipe like this on here...and I got lucky.  These are delicious.  We omitted the ketchup, but followed everything else.  Will make this again and again.  Thanks for the post.

Just made these! Soooo gooood! I made quite a few changes however and simply used this recipe as a base. I omitted the parmesan and replaced with extra cheddar cheese. I omitted the egg as another had suggested. (My family does not like meatloaf.) I used dried minced onion (approx. 3 TBLS) instead of fresh to cut down on time. I also added onion powder. I cooked and crumbled bacon and mixed in with the raw beef to make grilling easier. I replaced the ketchup with our fav BBQ sauce. Everything else I used as listed. If you like BBQ sauce, cheese, and bacon on your burgers this is the way to go. It's all your favorite things rolled into a patty. Certainly everyone likes their burgers the way they like them but I hope this can be of help or advice someone!

Great recipe, will use it this weekend.
Regarding oiling the grill prior to cooking the burgers. If the grill has been properly preheated, most if not all oil will burn off. I find if I lightly oil the meat, burgers or otherwise, it is less likely to stick. I use the spray-on type, works very well on chicken.

A good idea to pre-cook the bacon...Whatever is to your liking. For the "so -called experts," don"t take your self description seriously.  Many may not like your advice.  If you tear a recipe apart,  and you are in the minority, then there must be something wrong with your method of cooking.

We really really liked these.  Hubby LOVED them.  I pretty much doubled the recipe with 2 lbs. of ground beef and made 6 patties.  I did follow other's advise and cooked the bacon a bit before wrapping.  I did only have 1 piece of bacon for each burger, next time will have 2 pcs ready for each patty. 
As for those who rate and then state" i will not make these"  well, then don't rate it.  Some people appreciate others opinions and honestly, appreciate a recipe like this to help them think outside the box.  Don't be such a food snob - it is what it is.

This had a good flavor yet when I wrapped the bacon around them the bacon burned to a black crisp so I had to throw the first ones away and make the bacon separately. Yet still a good burger!!! I recommend cooking the bacon separately unless you know how to do this already.

This recipe is awesome.  I don't care for ketchup so I used bbq sauce, but other than that and doubling the recipe this was awesome as is...so moist and tender.  Also it did not have the meatloaf consistency as one reviewer stated...the egg amount was just fine!  My family thanks you...will definitely be on the menu again soon!

These are delicious.  I didn't change a thing and they turned out perfect.  I did only get 4 burgers though.  Definitely a man-loving recipe.  My husband and father loved them and ordered them up for next weekend again.

These were the best homemade hamburgers I have made/tasted. The only thing I changed was to cook the bacon and cut it up and mix in with the hamburger meat. No messy grill! I will make these again!

Any time that I do a recipe with bacon I flash cook the bacon in a skillet under a press first. This starts the cooking process and it always comes out fully cooked in the recipe.

Very good recipe.  I will make this again.  I left out the egg because I was not using lean ground beef and the burgers still came out super juicy.  I did use an egg once with another burger recipe and it does give it a meatloaf texture like another reviewer mentioned, which I wasn't a fan of.  I did not have a fresh onion so I used 1 tablespoon of chopped / dried onion flakes and had no bacon either.  My boyfriend does not like cheese on or in his burger so I tried sneaking in only a 1/4 cup of sharp cheddar cheese.  Just a little over a pound of meat made 4 burgers that fit perfectly in your standard hamburger bun.  The taste of these burgers is a bit onion-y so if you like that it shouldn't be a problem.  I think I will cut the onion back a little (use 1/2 a small onion or 1 teaspoon of flakes instead).  I also cooked these on a pan on the stove on medium heat about 4-5 minutes on each side.  I can't wait to taste how these come out on the grill.  I may try a couple of cloves of fresh garlic in the future and see how things taste substituting the ketchup with some A-1 steak sauce.

I found this burger recipe on this site many years ago. It was a huge hit with a group of about 25 teenage boys. Of course I had to adjust how many ingredients I used. I followed the recipe. It has fabulous flavor, no doubt about that. But the bacon didn't really cook very well. So what I do instead is cook the bacon first. Then I chop it up and toss it in with the rest of the ingredients. You get the same flavor and there are no toothpicks to have to take out afterwards either.

I don't see the point in making hamburgers any other way.  I left out ketchup, and I didn't have an onion, but I would definitely put onion in if I had one.  I imagine they're fantastic either way.  Don't require much for condiments.  So good.

These turned out pretty well for us. I did not add the egg... don't care much for that meatloaf-y texture myself. I upped the  ketchup somewhat, added a squirt of mustard along with a couple cloves of minced garlic and a touch of tabasco.If you dice the onions up  finely instead of chopping into  chunks, there should be no problem with the burger staying together...
unless you try and make six burgers out of a pound of ground beef. We've always done 3 with this recipe. I also serve the bacon on the side now, with lettuce and tomato. Have tried it the other way, and don't see much difference, except for alot of grease. Thanks for the recipe.

I mixed this up early in the morning with all ingredients as listed, even tho' I lied to Hubs and told him I would honor his request not to include the Parmesan.   (As an Italian who pretty much uses Parmesan cheese like salt and pepper, I've been lying like that to him for years.  He's never noticed, unless he's lying to me too)   After spending much of Memorial Day (my birthday) planting our garden and preparing to head out of town early the next morning, I finally sat down to enjoy My Favorite Chocolate Martini and didn't notice that when it came time for Hubs to grill the burgers he had forgotten to wrap them in bacon.  And then he overcooked them to boot.  But guess what - in spite of omitting a key ingredient, BACON of all things, and in spite of a rare instance where he did not grill something perfectly, these burgers were perfectly delicious!  Even more evidence to support that was that my "keep the beef pure and simple with just salt and pepper" hubby thought they were  pretty "D" good too!  WITH the egg, which he opposed.  And WITH the Parmesan, which he was clueless about.  I'm thinking the Worcestershire sauce had a lot to do with that.   I am looking forward to trying these again, with the bacon and cooked to a perfect medium-well.  And when I do, I'll again follow the ingredients list exactly.  (By the way, I had mine with a Sriracha mayonnaise I ordered online.  Awesome good)

We had these last night and the burgers were delicious! I did omit ketchup as someone else stated and 1/2 egg. Too, I used some chopped red onion plus some chopped yellow onion. Delish!

Great for a meatloaf...if you want burgers...leave out the egg,it only makes a mess...add bacon on top,leave out the salt.

These were pretty tasty!  I did not use the egg as I have an aversion to using egg in hamburger and therefore I did have a bit of a problem with the burgers falling apart.  I did not have enough time to chill the burgers before grilling, so next time I can try that.  Otherwise, they got great reviews from all who ate them.  The catsup and worcestershire sauce caused them to have a bit of a BBQ flavor and they were very moist and flavorful.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

I liked these but the rest of the family didn't care for them so much. My husband says there is too much going on in the meat, he likes to taste the ground beef. He also doesn't care for the fact that the bacon isn't really crispy. I even tried cooking the bacon a little before grilling, but it never got crispy. ((If I am going to make the extra step of cooking the bacon prior, I would rather just make it really crispy in the pan and top the burger with it.)) It was decent to me but not enough people in my family cared for it to have me make it again.

These turned out great! I added some minced garlic and cooked them on the forman grill for about 8-9 minutes. They were still very juicy. I will be making this again.

AWESOME!!!!  I made them small, and put them on hawaiian bread, kinda the size of a white castle.  THEY WERE THE BEST EVER!!!!! (Make sure you use a less fatty meat though, like ground round.  I made them with it and they were excellent.  My friend used ground chuck, and they were really greasy.)  Thank you!!

Hamburgers were very juicy!  Took advice from other reviewers and precooked bacon in microwave to insure it was crispy.  I also added a clove of garlic and some oregano.  Delicious!

Burgers are my fiance's favorite!  When I made these, he told me that this was the best burger he has ever tasted! I did add "garlic plus" and "Montreal steak spice". Thanks for sharing the recipe! I will definately make again!

Small changes.  After reading other reviewers comments, I left the egg out of the meat mixture. However, after meat (I used only 1/2 lb. to make 2 burgers) and bacon were cooked to desired doneness, I layered the top of the bacon-burger with pepper jack cheese and then "fried" the egg (2 of them for DH and me) and placed the fried egg over the bacon cheeseburger and continued to layer all that goodness on a bed of greens with thick slices of tomatoes.  We are on a low carb diet and this was perfectly wonderful, sans the bread, of course.  The burgers are full of delicious flavor and ours turned out very much like the burger with egg you get at a famous restaurant known for their burgers!  Great recipe and I will definitely do this again.

Made these today for a family Easter dinner and they were a huge hit! My hubby wanted to make BIG burgers, so we ended up adding a little more of everything and they tasted wonderfully! The only change was I used mozzarella instead of cheddar because that's what I had. Also, instead of wrapping only the outer side of the patties, I wrapped the bacon around the whole patty, which worked great! They were juicy and very tasty! Will be making these again!

This was definitely a hit- even my five year old whom I usually have to beg to take even a bite of meat enjoyed it and exclaimed 'this is really good!'.  If you're looking for an easy and tasty burger recipe you just found it!

Really great burgers! thanks for the wonderful recipe! I used a mix of 1/2 ground turkey breast and 1/2 ground pork since I don't eat beef. Added fresh parsley, 1/4 cup bread crumbs and topped burgers with coleslaw...REALLY delicious! Entire family loved them!

Family loved this, I also substituted bbq sauce for the ketchip and added 1 clove of garlic.  I refrigerated for an hour before I fried these on the stove and they stayed together with gentle handling.  I soft cooked the bacon and cut each strip in half and wrapped them from top to bottom.  I cooked the side of the hamburger where the bacon met first and it stayed together without toothpicks.  My husband was surprised these were not grilled.  Will make them again.

Very tasty burger. I did not use the egg, because we didn't want consistency of meat loaf as described in other posts. Substituted Sweet Baby Rays Bar-B-Q sauce for ketchup.  Added a bit more bacon and everyone loved the taste it added.
Will be adding this recipe to my list of favs.

My whole family(including my 4 yr and 6 yr olds) loved these burgers!  I did leave out the egg and cooked them a little bit longer (mine might have been a little thiicker).  Loved them-thanks for sharing the recipe.

Excellent flavor and easy to do.  We did not use tooth pics as it was easy to wrap the bacon around the burger.  My eight year old especially loved it.  Served with tomato slices and lettuce on the side.

GREAT RECIPE! One of THE BEST burgers I have ever had and all my kids loved it too!!! I altered it a little, used ground beef, ketchup, worcestershire sauce & seasoning salt. And next time I am going to put bacon on the sides & across the top, I think that would make it turn out perfect!

Absolutely the BEST hamburgers I have EVER tasted!
I changed up the recipe a bit. I doubled the recipe, and added one pound of ground beef and one pound of ground pork! I had to add some ritz cracker crumbs so the burgers would stick together better. 
I also used the new Kraft shredded romano 3 cheese parmesan. 
DEFINITELY need to have a water bottle on hand as the fire in the BBQ is insane! 
I also made homemade hamburger buns with Knorr Garlic Plus in them.
These are the most flavorful, tender, and juicy burgers EVER! I will never make them any other way again!

This was great!  I doubled the recipe but only used one egg.  I also used less salt as shredded cheddar is salty and makes up for it.  Seasonings were right on target and complimented the beef nicely.  I got 9 good sized burgers (about 4 oz.) from 2 pounds of meat.

I used deer burger instead of the hamburger as that is the only meat we eat and it was excellent! It's definitely on our keeper list!

Tho these tasted wonderful, they completely fell apart and had to be eaten that way mounded in rolls. Thought they'd be worth trying again maybe w/ some bread crumbs?

Wonderful! Only thing I did different was use Colby/Jack cheese and shredded Parmesan cheese. Didn't have  Cheddar or grated parm. Will certainly make these again. Next time I'm going to try without the egg. My opinion, it wasn't necessary. Thanks Jan.

I have never reviewed a recipe before, but I had to rate this one.  All I want to say is that 5 of the 6 people who ate these burgers last night said they were the best burgers they had ever eaten - anywhere! The sixth just said "yum".  Thanks Jan for the new BBQ staple.

Nothing too special to me...although I did not wrap them in bacon....not sure how much flavor that would have added. maybe alot, to me these were OK burgers, but rather blah.

These are the best.....My husband has been begging for me to make them again. The only thing I did different was brown the patties in a cast iron skillet then bake on a rack to finish cooking. I didnt want them to fall apart....I did cook the bacon half way first to make sure it was done.....wonderful...

Very delicious!!!! a lot of onion but great taste!! I cut the bacon in small pieces and added half teaspoon of smoke flavor mixed with the rest of the ingredients. I cook them in a grilled pan. What a good result, my husband loved them and he really hates onion texture. Oh, and omitting the egg was a good tip too.

While these had really good flavor they came out really thick and hard to eat.  The burger tends to be the width of the bacon you use and that's just a little too thick for my taste.

This is a great recipe to add the "wow" to your hamburgers. I didn't have the onion on hand, so I threw in about three-fourths of a Tbs of onion powder, which worked well. I actually  cooked them on the broiler in my oven, about 5 minutes for each side on medium heat(watching carefully that the bacon doesn't singe). That worked nicely, but next time, I will be sure to make the patties "extra flat", as I couldn't press them down as I would have on the grill.

This receipe is absolutely wonderful!  The only change I made was to cut down the amount of onion from a whole one to about 1/4 of an onion.  Otherwise I followed the recipe closely, even to grilling the burgers 5 minutes per side.
My 17 year old son could not stop telling me how good they were.  He must had told my 5 or 6 times!  And my husband liked them very much too.  I will be making these a lot....and for company too.

This is a really yummy burger to grill. The only adjustment I made was to put the cheese in the center of the raw patty instead of mixing it through the meat. Makes a little surprise middle bite and I like a meaty burger without the distraction of cheese throughout.
Very good recipe!

These burgers tasted just like meatloaf - in fact, my husband ate it in a bowl like meatloaf b/c it was falling apart.  I wasn't really impressed by the taste and they didn't hold together.  Wouldn't make again.

These are great.  Even my sister who despises bacon ate one and was surprised by how flavorful and juicy it was.  If you are a big texture person, this may not be the recipe for you as it is kinda like meatloaf in a patty but it sure tastes wonderful!!

My husband didn't like the idea of wrapping the bacon around the burgers so I cooked it separate and we just added it along with our other fixings.  The flavor of the burgers was awesome!  Thanks for the great recipe!

these are the greatest hamburgers ever!! the flavor is great.  i've substituted bbq sauce or steak sauce for the ketchup for an extra kick and it's wonderful!!  i also ran out of gas on my grill the night i was to prepare these, so i broiled them (flipping them over once to crisp the bacon) and they turned out just fantastic!!

I forgot to review them when I made them before . All I can say is these are on the menu for Father's day for my burger loving husband . The best combo I've had for a burger . Going to pick up some gourmet cheese buns at Sobeys to go along with them . For those having trouble with them falling apart make sure your grill is good and hot and don't flip them to soon , let them brown up on one side first .

I wasn't sure what to expect but this is one of the best burgers I've EVER had. We had no "meatloaf" texture to our, but they were cooked to well done. Surprisingly, they were still moist! These are no fail.

I have been making this recipe for years and love it. Here are a few changes I make: instead of ketchup use BBQ or hot sauce (sometimes a combination) you must use fresh garlic and fresh basil. HUGE difference and makes the burgers! Also go crazy with the cheese :D I now make only these for my family. They're so good store bought just don't compare. One more thing they freeze great! I make about 20 at a time. My husband also prefers cooking them from frozen as they hold together better.

If you have access to a food processor, process the hamburger, bacon, onion, egg, ketchup, cheeses and seasonings all together.  Incorporating "ground" bacon gives the burger so much flavor.  I got this idea off a "Man vs Food" episode.  I keep "ground" bacon in my freezer to add whenever we have hamburgers:)

The taste of these burgers was really good but, as others mentioned, they completely fell apart on the grill.  We ended up scooping the meat onto a bun.  I followed the recipe exactly except that I partially cooked the bacon and added it to the meat mixture instead of wrapping the bacon around each patty.  If I make this again, I think I will try cooking them on my George Forman griddle to cook them from the top and bottom at the same time so I won't have to flip them over.

These hamburger patties made a mess of my grill!  They just kept falling apart as they cooked.  I finally pulled them off the grill and finished them off in a pan.  They taste ok, but more like a meatloaf than a burger.  I think I'll stick with the old fashioned way.

These were really good but not the best burger I have ever had. The bacon and cheese were sort of lost in the grilling process. They were very moist and flavorful.

very good!! I have company coming over for a bbq tomorrow, so I just made a trial burger....oh yum!!! even fried in the frying pan, it was very good!  I'm not going to be worried about serving these at all.  At first, I thought it would be too heavy on the onions, but it tastes great... Only changes I made, were I used mozza as well, and I omitted the worsc. sce and swapped with bbq sauce... thanks Jan for the great recipe!

Excellent flavor but I will mince the onions next time as the kids wouldn't eat them (texture of the onion in the burger).  I also used 1/2 ketchup and 1/2 bbq sauce.  I used turkey bacon and it didn't cook well for me.  I took them off to continue to cook them and then used them on top of them burger once done.

Very good. I try not to change much, but I don't use hamburger only turkey. It's generally drier because of low fat content but adding this recipe....it is moist and very good.  
Will use again.

Tried this for dinner tonight - really good.  We do bacon wrapped hot dogs, so I thought why not try bacon wrapped burgers.  I followed suggestions of other reviews and left out the egg (and added garlic, because I like garlic) - the bacon really changes the burger - very moist & good flavor.  Was able to make the burgers just the right size for the bacon to wrap around just perfectly, using one toothpick to secure bacon to the beef - when wrapping the bacon, you could change the size of your burger to match so you don't end up with bacon wrapped on bacon, which will be hard to cook.  Watch your burgers on the grill so the beef and bacon don't burn - although some charring will/should happen.  Unlike regular burgers, don't let them sit for too long or you'll get burnt burgers.

Oh Wow!  The only thing I changed was to take out the egg and WOW!  My husband usually manages to make our burgers well done which usually means very dry.  But even after him doing that, these were still moist.  I hate well done burgers but this recipe made them totally tolerable.  Thanks!

Nothing wrong with the flavor of these but it's just not a burger.  It's like eating meatloaf on bread (I assume because of the whole ketchup/egg thing).  And the bacon doesn't get crispy no matter how you wrap the burger.  Just cook the bacon separately and add it on top later.  And unless you're looking for mini burgers only make 4 patties at most out of a pound of meat.

These burgers are the bomb! The only changes I made were I used 1 1/4 lbs of ground chuck and 1/2 egg. I used Sweet Italian buns. Definitely keep a spray bottle of water handy while grilling...you will have flare ups for sure!! I added a slice of American cheese right before pulling them off the grill. The onion flavor in the burgers is amazing!! Just had one left over and it too was awesome! This recipe is definitely a keeper!! Thanks Jan!

These smelled so good before I cooked them and tasted great to! I cooked these for my husband last night with 3 modifications. I added one clove of garlic minced, substitute the ketchup with Italian dressing, and added a couple dashes of hot sauce!
I have one suggestion... reduce the egg to 1/2 per pound.

Restaurant quality burger! No more dry meaty burgers.  I like my bacon crispy so I cooked it before and added as a topping.  Served with curly fries and on a toasted bun. Success!

I followed the recipe to the letter and the burgers came out very moist.  The flavor was good but just a little bit milder than what I'd hoped.  I think next time I'll allow the hamburgers to rest in the fridge for an hour or so to get a bolder flavor.  All in all this is still a good recipe!

I just made these and I'm currently eating them.  I completely underestimated how good these were going to be.  The flavors are blended together well and subtle enough that you can't pick out a specific flavor.  It's very juicy and very very good.  I left the onions out (because I don't like onions) and I left the egg out (just because I read in one of the review that adding it gives the burger a meatloaf texture and it's better without the egg).  This is by far the best recipe I have actually made on here.  I highly recommend it as either an entree or an appetizer/party food.  Delicious.  Thumbs up.

Fabulous recipe, they come out so juicy! I left out the egg and ketchup, because I thought it would be too much like meatloaf (my husband hates meatloaf). I also added in a half (1 oz) package of mesquite marinade mix (made my mccormick) and the flavor was excellent!

Pretty good! Almost too rich though with the bacon. I think next time, I will cook the bacon by itself and then add on. The bacon took forever to cook on the hamburger.

I followed the recipe and the burgers turned out very tasty. Some reviews said the bacon was undercooked but I didn't have that problem. I will be making these burgers again for sure.

I don't have a grill so I seared the burgers on a pan and then baked at 350 degrees for 15 minutes. They were really juicy and flavorful. They do tend to crumble so you have to handle them carefully and make sure you make a tight patty. I used precooked bacon and just folded it over the patty rather that go around the circumference of the patty with it. I didn't even need a toothpick.

Awesome burgers but I found the bacon needs extra time to crisp so I bbq'd on medium and flipped the burgers every 5 minutes for 20 minutes and they turned out great!

This was exceptional, I did everything as said in recipe, I used 4 LBS of ground lean so I multiplied each ingredient by 4 and frooze the rest for later.  My only addition which really turned out great was 1 cup of quick cooking oats, because I froze these I did not use the bacon.  However these are the best ever with bacon and without!   Thank you for such an amazing burger

Wow! I tried a bite before I added ketchup and mustard, my son did the same. I put the ketchup and mustard away and we ate it with only a toasted bun. Definitely did NOT need anything more. I am not real big on hamburgers but these are great! My 16 year old son could not stop raving about these burgers. Can't wait til my boyfriend comes over after work tonight so he can try them. Thank you for the recipe!

This was indeed an exceptional burger but it does have its issues. I had a really hard time keeping the bacon wrapped on it and kept having to re-stick it back on. Use multiple toothpicks I suppose. Also, even though I pan fried the bacon for a the first couple of minutes to cook, it was still very chewy and not quite done. I did cut the egg in half to ensure the burgers stayed together and that worked. I will certainly do this again with some tweeking.

My husband said these were the best hamburgers he ever had.  I didn't even have bacon on hand for the recipe!  Based on other reviews I also did not mix in the egg since I don't like burgers to be too meatloaf-like.  A little harder to shape burger without the egg but the chedder cheese mixed into the meat was key to keeping it so moist.  Hubby keeps asking me when I'm going to make them again.

MMMMMM yum! Next time I won't bother with the bacon. I'm sure it is a must for people who love bacon, but it was hard for me to work with because the grease dripping from it as it was cooking kept flaming up the grill and my burgers got a little too charred. I think the burgers would be equally delicious without it, so will make it again with that modification.

Its been years since I tried making home-made burgers - I am so glad I used this recipe. I stuck with the ingredients to the letter, however I was a little nervous about putting them onto the barbeque as the last time I made burgers I'd cooked them in the oven, so I tentatively put them on with a piece of foil under with small holes in it - they did start to break up at the edges slightly I took them off the bbq and transferred them onto a baking tray and put them into the oven at 400oF for about 20 minutes - the result was amazing - they held together perfectly and the taste was superb - next time I think I might try pan cooking them - this recipe is a keeper for me - thanks!

Made these for July 4th. Huge hit. Here is a suggestion. I used a piece of 5" PVC pipe as a mold and depressed the center. They cooked up perfectly.

My family LOVED this recipe.  Just a few changes - I precooked and chopped up the bacon into bits then added to the meat mixture before forming into patties. I used BBQ sauce instead of ketchip (like others suggested) and I cooked them on stove instead of BBQ. Next time I would leave out the cheddar and melt it on top because it felt like most of it "leaked" out while frying.  This was absolutely DELISH!!

Wow!!!  These are fantastic!  I only used 1/2 egg so that it wouldn't crumble and skipped the cheddar since I was making cheeseburgers.  The only bummer is that I chose to cook the bacon separately and we ended up eating them without it because I forgot all about it.  But they were still the best burgers I've ever made and no, I didn't have any issues with the texture.

Very good!  I tried to put the cream cheese in the middle like someone suggested and it was very messy.  I used my indoor grill and did pre-cook the bacon. Hamburgers were delicious!

These were really flavorful and juicy. I used mozzarella cheese because that was all I had. I just threw everything but the meat in my food processor and mixed it with the meat. I also chopped the bacon separately, cooked it and added that to the mixture. I used a pancake mold to shape these into hearts, and popped them in the freezer for a little while before grilling so it wouldn't fall apart. My picky husband loved it!

My boyfriend gave these 2 thumbs up. Followed the recipe, but also added crushed red pepper flakes, cayenne pepper, and italian seasoning. I precooked the bacon for just a few minutes before wrapping it around the burgers, just to make sure it would be cooked through at the same time as the burgers. Next time I might skip the egg, though. I'm not sure it was necessary. Thanks :)

very good.  I will use again.  I did make my burgers too thick and the bacon was burnt by the time the hamburgers were done so I will need to remember to make them thinner next time.

I made these the other night. They were delicious. I used very lean hamburg. So I added an extra egg to hold it together more. I had to cook a little longer than 5 minutes. But mine were thick and had the heat on low so that I wouldn't get to many flare ups. My husband raved about these. Told me to make more and freeze so we would have on hand.

Loved this. I didnt use bacon because I cannot eat it, but they were terrific even without, though Im sure the bacon flavor would be dynamite! Also, I cooked them in the frying pan.. and unless you want them on the raw side, be sure not to make the burgers too big otheriwse it takes forever to cook and the obvious happens. Burn outside, rawish inside. 

I cannot wait until summer comes, I want to try these out on the grill!!

I made these with ground turkey and may I say: Yummy!  I was craving these burgers for days to come after making them. Even my picky eater 3 year old ate them with a smile.

SOOOO YUMMY AND SOOO JUICY! We omitted the onions (icky! lol) and left off the bacon. I was out of Parmesan cheese but used Romano instead. These were delicious! Hubby loved them. This will now be THE hamgburger recipe in our house

We did not really care for this recipe.  As others stated, it tasted like meatloaf, and not a hamburger.  If you are looking for a meatloaf on the grill recipe, this works.  I also had trouble with it sticking to the grill grate.  Maybe omitting the egg would help.  The bacon was good!

I wish I could give this a negative rating. It didn't even look good when mixing the ingredients together; wouldn't hold together on the grill; and just didn't taste that good. What a waste of ground sirloin.

Fabulous burgers! We wrapped the bacon around the outer edge of the patty instead. Flavor is amazing. We made these burgers for friends and it was a hit! Definite keeper! Our new favorite burger recipe!

Made these several times as written, very good but fell apart. Finally took other reviewers advice and left out the egg and onion. Still delicate on grill, but held together with some care. I liked them with the egg until I made them without, much better without!

I have made this burger over 10 times already, every time its awesome. Don't use any eggs, so the burgers stays together better. I also add 6 extra bacon's to the meat itself, I cut the 6 extra bacon's into little pieces and mix in the meat. So much better!

This hamburger was amazing. I made 4 quarter pound burgers and my family loved it! My younger brother said that i could open a restaurant with this recipe. I've eaten many different burgers and i could say that this was one of the best burgers i've ever had. I will be making this again soon.

Overall, my family loved these burgers apart from the quantity of onion (personally, I love onion, so these were great, but the rest of the family wanted just a little less). I had to broil these (grill is under a foot of snow) but they really did turn out great; very juicy and tasty.

Now that I've made this per the recipe, next time I think that I'll try BBQ sauce in place of the ketchup and replace some of the onion with garlic since I think that that will suit the family's tastes overall. Still, an excellent recipe - thanks for sharing!

These bacon wrapped burgers were very good.  Moist and full of flavor.  I did find that the bacon did cause a lot of flames on grill due to the fat.  But, they were excellent.
Thanks for sharing...

Good hamburger.  I think making the burgers up early in the day and letting them sit in fridge helped hold the burger together when they were grilled.  Used turkey bacon because that is what I had on hand.

YUM!  I used crumbled bacon and mixed it right in with the meat before cooking. I also switched to shredded Monterey Jack cheese, which was delicious.  We fried them on the stove and everyone loved them!

Excellent hamburger- Easier to chop bacon & partially fry & add to hamburger rather than wrap. Pepper Jack Cheese is also good with this & BBQ sauce rather than ketchup.

The issue I read in Sous Andy's review is true about the burgers falling apart but only if using lean meat or ground lean turkey. With the 85/15 or the 80/20 mixes you shouldn't have that problem or at least I didn't. It was when I used the 93/7 meat to fat mix. Is a good burger and can't go wrong with bacon! I also tried adding the beacon inside the burger. Good flavor but the bacon was not crispy at all, the texture was not one I found enjoyable. I also added some sauce near the end and used a lot of wood for smoke. Everyone loved the added smoke flavor. I have used both Hickory and Pecan. Everyone loved the smell and flavor so much that they ate the burgers with nothing else added. I always at the least add Mustard but they were right! They were juicy with excellent flavor with nothing but the burger and the bun.

We did not use the egg, added about 40% extra ingredients since we used 1.4lbs of ground beef.  This was just fantastic, cooked it on a George Foreman Grill.  We used the oven-fresh-seasoned-potato-wedges to go with it.  Don't plan on using store bought patties anymore, as long as we have the money.  Thank you for the recipe!  =)

The mix for the burgers themselves was awesome! Great flavor. I had a minor issue with the bacon not cooking enough, but I had to use my George Foreman grill as we just moved and our grill isn't put together...maybe if I par-cooked the bacon first, then wrapped them around the burgers they would be amazing!

I was looking for a new hamburger recipe.  My crowd is very picky and loves the burgers I have been making for years but I was bored making the same thing.  This recipe was a huge success and the verdict is - make these ones from now on!

These hamburgers are absolutely the best. I have made this several times sometimes even without the bacon, and they always turn out great.  My son's favorite as well. Thanks for this!

Hmmm...tasted like meatloaf with a greasy strip of fat (and it had been tasty bacon).  I'll stick to good ol garlic burgers (soy sauce + garlic)

All we can say if you haven't tried this, you should! I used 1 pound ground sirloin, and instead of parmesan cheese used motzerella, it's what I had on hand, used already cooked bacon, added a couple  crushed garlic cloves,  these burgers were goooood and juicy! I only got 4 burgers out of this, so next time and there will be a next time, I will double the recipe!

The burgers were only average - they fell apart quite easily while cooking and didn't have enough flavor for me. Also, the bacon didn't cook quickly enough, as did the meat, so it wasn't crunchy enough. I think next time I'll just make my regular burger recipe, make the bacon and slap it on top!

Very good burger. I didn't have bacon but needed a good hamburger recipe. This is a keeper. I didn't use the egg because I don't like the texture that results when you do that (which is soft and mooshy).  I would also say there is a good deal of salt in this recipe. That's something I might cut next time. Between the salt, the worcestershire and the bacon...LOTS of salt.

Excellent burgers. Very juicy and lots of flavor. My 8-year-old asked for seconds. I had thicker cut bacon on hand so I did cook in the microwave for a few minutes before wrapping around burgers and it was perfect. If using a thinner bacon, you probably wouldn't need to do this. Will definitely make these again!

These were something else!  And I mean that in a good way! Man -- not for the faint of heart when it comes to eating a fatty meal, but seriously...my family DEVOURED these.  I wrapped the bacon all around the patty - not just the edge, but top to bottom.  I also cooked these on our big electric skillet so they were basically fried in the bacon!  Yum!

These were excellent. When I was forming the burgers, I realized that they were going to fall apart on the grill. So I placed the hamburger mixture back in the bowl and remixed adding 1/2 cup of plain bread crumbs.

Awesome burger.  I tried this once and the burger was literally destroyed.  The second time, I cooked on low to medium heat so the bacon cooked at the same speed as the burger.  I also lightly oiled the grill to keep the burgers from sticking because they are VERY fragile at first.  Sticking them in the freezer for 20 minutes worked good at keeping them together also.  And definitely have a bottle of water handy during grilling because they will burst into flames constantly from the bacon grease.  After that, they came out perfect for me.  Thanks a ton for the recipe Jan. =)

Loved it! We don't have an outdoor grill, but the flavor was great right off the frying pan. I think I'll take other reviewers' suggestions and pre-cook the bacon a bit next time. We got pretty splattered!

Absolutely awesome burger! I wanted to do something besides the traditional onion soup and this recipe is spot on. It adds great flavor to plain old beef. If you're looking for a ton of flavor or kick, it's not exactly that but doesn't claim to be. It's just a great tasting burger.

I made some changes based on others' suggestions and our own tastes. I used 2 lbs of meat, half ground duck and half ground  beef. It really added some great flavor! I substitued bbq sauce for ketchup, omitted the cheddar and put pepper jack on top. We didn't have any problems with the bacon. My husband said they were the best burgers he's ever had and I had to agree. There were no leftovers! I'm making this again tonight for a friend...I'm drooling already just thinking about it.

These were very good!  I followed the recipe other than using minced garlic and onion powder instead of the real thing (I was out).  I had no problem with the consistancy, but I also cooked mine on the stove becuse it was too cold to grill.  I tried both wrapping the bacon around the edge of the burger and top to bottom - both worked, but having it around the burger I had to shape it around the patty so that it would cook evenly.  I added some sauted mushrooms when they were done, absolutely delicious.

"This is the best hamburger you have ever made mom!" Those were the sentiments of my 13 year old son this evening as we were eating dinner. The only thing I did different was to leave out the parmesan cheese as suggested. These were truly the juiciest burgers ever. I panned fried them and served them between sliced french bread. I then lighlty browned the "buns" in the pan. Thanks for a great recipe!

Very easy and good. Use spicy BBQ sauce instead of ketchup and no chedder cheese.  Did not have bacon, so didn't use that either.  Makes good size patties.

I made it in my skillet and it was still great. While the cheese melts out a little it was till very good. I just added a slice when I put it on the bun. I also suggest that if you do use a skillet, cook the burger in a little bacon grease and you wont regret it!

These were fantastic and very flavorful.  I made these per the recipe except for 3 things: 1) I don't have a grill so I cooked them with some olive oil in a flat pan (I think it's called a griddle pan?), 2) I sauteed a red onion to put on top of the burgers, 3) I salt & peppered each side of the patties. Next time I will try some garlic, not because I think it needs it, but because I love garlic.

Very good.  A little on the "rich" side but good.  Made them exactly as recipe called for but didn't use the bacon. (didn't have any in the house)  I even made up extra ones and have them in the freezer.

Not sure why this had such high ratings, we thought it was very bland and followed the recipe exactly.  Very Moist, but bland

My husband is very picky and does not really like bugers so when I told him burger for dinner he was not looking forward to it. BUT to his surprise, first I left the bacon on his because he loves bacon and he LOVED it. He said the bacon did not dry the burger out. Just a wanring when grilling though the bacon makes for an awful lot of fat drippings. I only made 3 burgers instead of 6 like the recipe calls for but I burnt one when i was not playing close attention.

This is a great recipe.  A nice change from using the onion soup mix.  I didn't wrap the bacon around burger as others said, I think it's more of a cosmetic thing.  Couldn't really taste the cheddar in the burger so next time I'll just put slices of cheese as usual.  
All in all though, very delicious.

These burgers were really good. The only thing I didn't do was wrap it up in bacon, didn't have any on hand. They turned out nice and juicy and the entire family loved them. Will definately make these again and will try with the bacon too. Thanks for sharing this great recipe.  Update:March 11, 2009 This is still our favourite and only burger recipe. I made them a few days ago and pan fried them this time as I ran out of propane for the BBQ and they are just as good. The bacon definately is a must as it adds so much flavour. It also makes it look more fancy like a filay mignon. YUM YUM YUM!!!

This recipe is a keeper. We used green onions instead of a regular onion. We also dressed with baby greens and radicchio, tomato, dill pickle slices, mayo, ketchup, purple onion rings, and spicy-sweet mustard.  All served on buttered then toasted light wheat buns.  We pulled the bacon off after cooking the burgers nine minutes on the Forman grill.  The bacon wasn't crispy, and we did not want the added fat.  Also, we used only the egg yolk, not the white.

I really enjoyed the flavor of these.  I had a problem with them falling apart on the grill.  My husband thought they had to much onion flavor, but I used a 1/4 of an onion.  My picky 13 year old ate them up with no problem.  I will make them again, but I think 1 egg was to much for a pound of burger and that is why they fell apart.  Great flavor.  Thanks for the recipe.

These were excellent!! I cooked them on my stove top grill that fits right over my burner.  I normally buy the microwavable bacon so instead of wrapping it around the hamburger (I was afraid it would burn) I topped the hamburger with a slice of cheese and added the bacon on top.  My bf said a "good hamburger" doesn't need condiments to make it taste good.  Needless to say he didn't add ANY to his burger.

These were really good, but if you try to make 6 patties out of 1 lb. of ground beef, they aren't thick enough to wrap a slice of bacon around (unless you make them very very small like meatballs).  Making 4 burgers from this recipe might make it easier.  This is why I gave 4 stars and not 5.  Taste was wonderful.  My husband used the word meatloaf while eating it though :(

I was looking for a good cheeseburger recipe, and these were perfect. I made the bacon separate, as people were sayin it took longer to cook, besides I didn't wanna have to deal w/ wrapping them around the burgers. They had a good flavor. I left out the cheddar cheese, and melted a piece of cheese on top when it was almost done. Will make again.

My husband thought that these burgers were fantastic, but didn't like the bacon (which created an inferno in our grill and didn't add much in the way of flavor).  Though similar to the flavor of the burgers I usually make, I found the onion flavor in this recipe a little too overpowering.

These were by far the best burgers I have ever eaten! I made them for my European in-laws who had never eaten an American-style hamburger and they were absolutely blown away! This will definitely be made again! And a tip to keep the bacon in place: wrap each strip tightly around the burger and pin each at its end using the toothpicks. As the bacon cooks and shrinks, the toothpicks will hold it in place.

These were incredible!  I partially cooked the bacon on my indoor grill first.  Luckily I grilled a few pieces extra, because once you start cooking the bacon, it shrivels up and I needed an extra piece for each burger to cover around the patty.

All the tastes in this recipe are better combined in the conventional method.  Bacon and beef do not cook at the same rate.  There is no good way to regulate the medium-well burgers or the rare ones.  The combination of textures is better when left intact (cheese, onion, bacon on top).  The ratios are nice, but just do the burgers like Jimmy Buffet would.  I have tried many recipes for cheese and onion inside the burger, but none of them beats the old-fashioned way.

These were great!  My family loved them!  I served them with homemade onion rings and added some barbeque sauce and an onion ring on the bun with the burger. (My favorite bar and grill does this).  Definitely a make again when I have a little extra time to assemble my burgers before grilling!

We just finished eating these...all I can say is WOW! I topped mine with a little KC Masterpiece bbq sauce and fantastic flavor! I'm not an onion fan, so I used 1/2 a small Texas sweet onion minced fine and left out the egg. As good as take out if not better and all at home! I used precooked bacon strips. Thanks for the awesome burger.

I have a couple testimonials for this recipe.  First of all...my family and a couple friends LOVED these burgers.  My son said during dinner, "I put salt on everything and I didn't even think of salt or ketchup for these."  Second, we HAD to have the same dinner the very next night!  I followed this recipe exactly as written here.

Very tender and juicy.   I did however use angus beef instead of ground beef.

This recipe not only makes a good hamburger, but also an awesome meatloaf.  Moist and tasty.

This was a good receipe, but not nessarily great.  I think the onions made it drop a star.  It tasted like a normal hamburger.  I guess if it was grilled outside on a pit, it would have tasted better.  I used the George Forman Grill.

this is definitely going into my recipe box. my girlfriend and I just finished eating them, and they were wonderful. I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of the Parmesan cheese, which i didn't have. I topped it with mayo, lettuce, and a slice of American cheese and served them with a side of french fries. Talk about a juicy burger. We ate 2 each and managed to save 1 each for later. I make burgers often, being that its quick and easy and i'm on a college student's budget, but these are by far the best burgers i have eaten  to this day. I wasn't able to grill them though, so I baked them in the oven on 350 for about 20 minutes. I will try the grill as soon as time permits. Thanks for this excellent recipe.

These were delicious. For a spin on them I sliced patties in half before grilling and placed a slice of onion in them, then reshaped into patty and grilled.

These were great! I made these ahead of time and took camping.  They were fantastic cooked over the open fire.  The only thing I did differently was that I wrapped the bacon top to bottom vs. around the outside.  I cooked them slow so the bacon would not get too crispy before the hamburger was cooked.  Definitely will make again!

These were amazing! I made them without the bacon and they were still delicious. I didn't have any Worcestershire sauce  so instead I added more ketchup and some soy sauce. These were extremely easy and wonderful.

It was good, but not knock-your-socks-off great. I couldn't forsee the bacon staying on the hamburger, or how to eat it with it literally on the side, so I put it on the top, which worked just fine for me. Other than that, I kept the recipe unchanged. Have made twice and good both times.

These are insanely delicious.  I made the mixture then cooked them in a skillet.  I cooked the bacon separately and used it as a garnish along with lettuce & tomato.  A good bacon will really set it off well!  My husband is crazy about them and the all recipes site.

I made these in a frying pan with a lid because here in Ohio it's too cold in February to go outside to grill.  It takes a little longer than 10 min. to cook, but these were so good.  We burnt the top of our mouths because we could not wait to eat them!

Delicious!  I didn't have any worchestershire sauce (but will use next time) and my bacon didn't quite fit around the burgers, because I like them thinner.  Thanks for a yummy new burger recipe!!!

HOLY COW!  These burgers were awesome!  I am from Louisiana so I always add Tony Chachere's creole seasoning and cayenne pepper to everything I cook so mine came out really spicy...just how I like my food.  Plus I added a slice of cheese on top after cooking, and I cooked mine in a skillet pan.  My husband was a little worried when he saw me making them because he is a very picky eater but after his first bite, he starting going on and on about how great they were.  He ate two large burgers!  Thanks for the recipes!

Extremely good. My husband said as far as hamburgers go this would be hard to beat. High praise coming from him. My five year old loved them too. Here are the changes I made. I was out of cheddar so I used mozzarella. I didn't have Worchestshire sauce so I used A1. I broiled these in my oven. On a broiling pan at 400 for about 40 minutes which was a touch too long. Thank you Jan.

Fast, easy, ingredients I always have on hand. This will be my new go to burger recipe. I'm sure they would be good even without the bacon. To my pleasant surprise my picky kids who won't eat anything with seasonings loved these!

Followed most if it but I'm a N.O. Girl! Where there are eggs there's bread crumbs. My subs were Parmesan bread crumbs, my fresh seasoning blend ( onions, red, yellow, green bell peppers, celery, etc) no ketchup, teriyaki sauce instead. Used bacon and fried burger in pan on med high heat for 4 mins on both sides and let stand for at least 5 mins. Super juicy and flavorful. The applewood bacon gave an amazing flavor.  Also used butter Pam and 3 tbspns of canola oil to fry.  My roommate wanted to slap me. Dressed with cheddar in bottom bum and pepper jack on top. No cheese mixed in. I know this all over the place but if you use these subs I promise you will create what I call the Po Man MoBetta Burger.

I made these burgers for a BBQ when friends were coming over. I wanted something more than a plain burger. It was a hit. I added some diced jalapeno to the mix as well. I prebaked the bacon for a few minutes, till about 1/2 done; and wrapped the burgers fillet mignon style. Everyone raved about them.

Juicy, taste great.  Used BBQ sauce instead of ketchup and my husband decided to cook the bacon separately since he thought it wouldn't hold on well when being grilled and might take too long to cook.  We like thick sliced peppered bacon and it was divine on these burgers!

burger was good, but the bacon didn't crisp.  It was cooked though.  Also made very small burgers.

Well this recipe passed the test! My family is really picky and they loved it! Yes the bacon took a bit longer to cook but the results were perfect! Next time I may slightly cook bacon first then wrap around patties.

Made these tonight but i baked my bacon in the oven 375 for 30 minutes and then crumbled it into the meat mixture. I left out the egg and ketchup to avoid a meatloaf taste and added BBQ sauce. Also added some additional seasoning to the patty. The bacon made the burger so juicy. My husband loved them, will make again!

I was very unsure about all this at first. This is the first meal I have made that didn't involve a microwave. I figured out somethings about this though. A. to much egg, B. not enough ground beef.

I personally hate onions, but I went with them cause that is what the recipe said and I thought "sure why not?". I found that if you don't wrap them in bacon, they fall apart while trying to grill them. I used measurements to make 12 burgers, but at 2 pounds of ground beef I only managed to get 9 patties that were just a bit smaller then a medium size. I would suggest getting 2 1/2 pounds of ground beef, it's always better to have some left over, then not enough. Getting back to the onions, when I diced them up into small little bits (and cried my eyes out). I didn't even notice them when I ate it, and omg... maybe it was just because I had made them, but one of the best burgers I have ever eaten. First time in years that I was at a cook out making burgers, and they weren't bland and average.

Even as a noob cook, the patties that had bacon wrapped around them came out intact and usable in a burger, the other 2 patties just fell apart but made great finger food. I made the mistake of not buying enough bacon, miss counted how much was in the pack.

Very good, but leave the egg out or they will crumble and fall through the grates of the grill!
I crumbled the bacon and added to the mixture.

I found the flavor was excellent.  My only complaint was they were a little dry.  I was concerned that the bacon wouldn't be cooked if I cooked them any less, but next time, I think I would try shorter cooking time anyway.

This was awesome! I didnt change much at all other then I whisked the egg and only use maybe a 1/4 of it because of other reviewers saying it had a meat loaf texture with all of it and I used pepper jack cheese.  I also didn't use ketchup or bbq sauce both of which have sugars in them that give you that lovely charcoal meat. i do add a bit about 2 minutes before its done otherwise it burns to the meat.  Thank you for this recipe the bacon was amazing!

Usually, I just prepare the ground beef as instructed in the recipe and leave out wrapping it in bacon. Be careful to watch them while cooking, they're a pyros best friend.

I made these without the bacon because I didn't have any, and left out the onions because I don't like them in my burgers.  My husband liked them so much we had them again 2 days later.  I used extra lean hamburger because the cheese adds enough fat.  They were very tender & juicy.  Worchestershire adds a great flavor.  Thanks!

I'm giving these a "5" because my husband LOVED them.  However, to me these totally tasted like White Castle (especially once I put my American cheese on top).  I probably won't make these again unless my husband asks.

Wow, I've never made a burger this good.  They were a big hit with the guys and I think I have my new signature burger recipe.  I used Jack Daniel's instead of ketchup, which added a great deal of flavor to the burgers.  Absolutely worth a try!

First, I still have yet to officially bacon wrap these.  I keep forgetting the bacon until I'm half done cooking everything.  However, the burgers themselves are still delicious.  My husband has requested that I make them this way every time.  The bacon just ends up being an optional side.

I made these the other night for my boyfriend and I and they were absolutely fantastic. I pre-mixed the patties and let them sit in the fridge for several hours, and that helped a lot with them staying together. I started cooking them on the stove (I don't have an outdoor grill) and it was kind of nerve wracking because of the bacon grease, but I just scooped some of it out during cooking and it wasn't a problem. I was afraid they were burning, because they got very black on the outside, but it was just the cheese cooking and it made them sooooo good! I also cooked two of them on my george forman grill, and while it was much easier they weren't as juicy. Wrapping the bacon around them tightly(I used 2 pieces each, one didnt go around all the way) really makes it easier to flip them. I hope you all try them, thanks for the recipe Jan!

They were okay, but they did have a meatloaf texture. Next time I will try it without the egg. They also tended to fall apart. Do NOT cook these in the oven or stovetop. The bacon grease seeps off and causes the meat to burn. Also, it helped cooking the bacon a little beforehand, otherwise the bacon wouldn't cook all the way.

These burgers were good but not as good as their rating. They were very moist but I would have to agree with cutting back on the onion and maybe cooking the bacon and crumbling it into the meat. I would recommend after they are formed to put them back in the fridge for a few hours so they don't fall apart as you put them on the grill. I may try adding chopped mushroom and liquid smoke the next time I make them.

Very moist without being meatloafy (and I added the egg). I did cook then crumble the bacon in just to give me piece of mind that it was indeed done. Everything else was made per the recipe. This is my new burger recipe. Thanks!

I made this as described and it was really good. Here comes the but. “but if you like blue cheese and ranch add crumbled blue cheese"1/4 cup" instead of the cheddar cheese and then "1 pack of ranch dressing mix" instead of the parmesan cheese. follow the original recipe. For the finish / Grill some sliced portabella mushrooms and sweet onions to top off your burgers.

Yummmmm.  I made a double batch, only substitution was Heinz chili sauce instead of ketchup (hubby's favourite over ketchup but essentially same).  I made a couple smaller ones for the kids, and they were awesome, my 5 year old had seconds and 3 year old ate it up!  No flare ups, no toothpick burning off, no bacon falling off.  I wrapped in bacon, toothpick in, flatten it down a bit to press against bacon for secure fit.    I was so proud of myself : )

Try pre cooking the bacon to avoid flareups and to get crispier...or use the already cooked bacon you can buy at the grocery...it works great.

Amazing! I don't normally eat grilled burgers at home mainly for lack of knowing how to create a juicy, great tasting one. I gave this a whirl and WOW! My husband and I put a little Sweet&Hot Mustard on our buns and really enjoyed it. I've been asked to make them for a family cookout already! We follow the recipe as it says and never have a problem with the burgers falling apart and the bacon cooks fine. Just make sure they are packed well and it will be fine.

I give this 5 stars because the only mistakes were mine.  I doubled it to cook for six based on some other reviews that it wasn't enough. I cook for a crew of boys with mens appetites.I believe this was probally the correct amount however keep the burgers small so that they will be easier to flip on your spatula so that they don't crumble. Taste was superb. The only thing I really changed other than making them to big my fault,  was to had a tsp of chopped jalepeno, bbq sauce instead of ketchup and some garlic powder and yes I did add 1 egg for the 2 lbs I think you need that to bind it I did not get the meatloaf consistacy others felt (prob the bread crumbs they added) Very Good Thank You Jan

VERY GREASY.  This was just an okay recipe.  I think it would have been better to cook the bacon on the side and add it on top of the patty.

Juice and delicious! I was craving hamburgers and this recipe met all my taste bud expectations. I couldn't get the bacon to stay wrapped around the patty the way it was suppose to be done, so I ended up wrapping two pieces around the entire patty the other way. It worked out swell.

These turned out really good.  They fell apart on me a little bit towards the last couple patties.  But I didn't use a lean meat.  So I'm sure the bacon plus that fact contributed to that some.  I will try a leaner meat next time.  Full of flavor so not many "fixins" are needed (not even a slice of cheese).  Thanks!

These were good however they didn't cook up well. I cooked these in a pan and they came apart really easily I think I need to somehow make the meat stick together better. Otherwise pretty good. Thanks

These burgers were very bland and fell apart on my George Foreman...If I ever made these again, I'd have to add lots more seasonings and about half the onions.

Okay hamburger.  Cooked on stove, Used thin sliced turkey bacon i/o pork bc/we dont eat pork and the flavor seemed to clash with the beef and was far too soft.  Overall flavor was quite bland and had too many onions (even though i cut it down quite a bit).  Im not even sure what the cheeses did in the hamburger since we couldnt really taste it.  Okay recipe, bf didnt like it, I doubt I'll make again.

My fiance and I both love these burgers! The first time we made it exactly as the recipe says, and realized it called for way too much onion. When I make these burgers now, I use only half a chopped onion. I also use monterey jack instead of chedder. I love how tender the egg makes the burgers but be carefull and when you grill the burgers, be sure to use a sturdy spatula to flip the burgers or they can easily crumble on you.

Wonderful! The burgers were a big hit. There is not a single thing I would change. Follow the recipe as is and you won't be disappointed.

Although I didn't wrap the burger with bacon, as I just added strips on top, this is a scrumptious burger! I used fresh onion rolls for the buns and they were devoured up.

Great recipe! I was planning on grilling some burgers and decided to cruise allrecipes.com for some new ideas. Glad I came across this one as I happened to have all the ingredients on hand. I melted some freshly shredded cheddar on top of the finished burgers and they turned out great! The bacon really adds to the flavor much more than topping an already cooked burger with it. I'll definitely do this again.

mmmm this was one of the best burgers i've ever had!! My hubby thought there was to much onion, but i LOVE onion,so i thought it was fine. Couldnt taste the bacon much, so next time i will cook the bacon seperate and add it on top. Also added cheese to mine, because you can't have a burger without the cheese!!

Very Good.  You should still marinade them in something though.  I left out the bacon.  Next time I will make the patties, and soak them in some marinade for a few hours before grilling.

yum! these hamburgers were a hit :) I made them exactly how the recipe stated, except I didn't use the egg because I don't like using eggs in hamburgers. It was the best hamburger recipe I have ever made and let me tell you, my family loved them! I will use this recipe when making hamburgers from now on. Thanks so much!

These were the best darn burgers ever. I even mke them all the time without the bacon. The only thing I added was a packet of ranch and a packet of beef/onion soup mix. They are always perfect.

My husband can be a little hard to please at times, but does love these burgers.  As suggested by others, I do leave the egg out to keep it tasting a little less like meatloaf, also added 1 tsp spicy steak seasoning and 1/2 tsp garlic powder to suit our tastes.  Great recipe - thanks!

I made these for my husband and I also chopped the bacon and put it in the meat instead.  They didn't stick together real well but with extra care it works.  Next time I won't put shredded cheese in because it didn't add much and my husband smothers his with cheese anyway.  Thanks for the recipe!

Very good!  I didn't think I had toothpicks so I didn't get to do the bacon. I also added BBQ sauce instead of ketchup.  The only thing is that a couple of them fell apart on the grill because of the cheese I guess.

These were very good.  The only thing I did differently was to cook the bacon separately and put it on top one the burgers before serving them.  I also cooked them on the stovetop.  They came out great!

The only reason I am giving this 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the difficulty in having the bacon and hamburger cooked fully at the same time. This burger is great without the bacon actually, great cheese flavor. The only thing I changed was adding a tablespoon of dried minced onion instead of fresh and a 1/2 tsp. of garlic powder and I omitted the egg. Overall had great flavor.

These are the most flavorful burgers I've ever had, and I am picky about my burgers! For flavor I give 5 stars; I've been trying to find the right mix of onions and egg to make sure the burgers don't fall apart on the grill, so for that I give 4 stars. Last time I used about 1/4 c or 1/3 c onion, chopped fine and then rolled in paper towel and squeezed to remove as much of the liquid as possible plus 1/2 beaten egg; the burgers stayed together better but still were a bit delicate on the grill. The flavor of the onions is subtle but that special something, so don't worry if you're not an onion lover, go ahead and dice them small and include them. You won't taste "onion!" -- you will taste flavor. I don't wrap in bacon b/c I'd rather have my bacon crisp, so I cook it and then top the burgers with bacon. For the ultiamte decadence, use Neuske's bacon from Wisconsin; you will never, ever want to go back to grocery-store bacon. (Buy at some butcher shops & specialty retailers, or order online. Expensive but absolutely worth it.)

My family thought this was the best hamburger they had ever had. My dad and my husband are usually so picky about everything and they loved this recipe. I am making it again this week because everyone keeps begging for it. I did cook these on the stove because it was storming outside and they still turned out perfectly.

I don't know why people are so excited about this burger.  I love to make hamburgers and have eaten some really good ones.  This was not one of them.  It was good enough to keep eating, but wasn't anything special.  For someone willing to try, use some honey and a pinch of cayenne pepper--those two may help it out.

If I can get all three of my children (14,11,11) to agree on a food item, it has to be good!  It was moist, juicy and downright delicious!  This will definitely be a burger we cook more often.

This is the only hamburger recipe I use now, with a couple of changes:  I do not use the parmesan and I have yet to wrap them in back (although I'm sure it's delicious). Full of flavour, they are the best homemade burgers I've come across.

Yum!  I just added diced onions to the mix to make it complete.  It is now a staple at our house.

The recipe tasted great exactly as is (though we omitted onions because neither of us like them). The meat had tons of flavor. The burgers themselves came out OK, but they kept falling apart (our meat was not very lean either) and the bacon kept igniting on the grill. I don't know if the ingredients caused it to fall apart or what, but we'll definitely be trying this again.

These were wonderful! I din't have bacon or onion. I substituted onion powder and it turned out great. I doubled it except for the egg and this made 8 nice sized hamburgers. I don't know how 1 lb. of hamburger can make 6 patties. They were very juicey and did not fall apart while cooking. This is a keeper!

I skipped the bacon.  The onions were a bit too much for me and the kids.  Next time I may use onion soup mix instead of chopped onions.  Overall I liked them and they were quite good.

I doubled the recipe and used a combination of extra lean ground beef and ground pork. Also, used turkey bacon instead of pork bacon to further reduce the fat.

These turned out quite excellent. I received rave reviews from my family.

we really like these burgers the only issue is it totally doesnt work (the bacon) if you don't have toothpicks. We haven't had toothpicks any time we've made them yet so I don't know how well it works with them.

YUMMY & JUICY! I used an indoor grill (it is winter in AK) and moose hamburger. I substituted A1 for the ketchup. I only used an egg YOLK vs the whole egg. FINELY chopping your onion will also help the ingredients to bind together. Next time I will add the cheese on top, as I love CHEESEburgers. Fantastic!

I LOVED these burgers, though my picky little sister said they reminded her of my meatloaf (which she isn't too fond of).  I added 3 cloves minced garlic and 2 tablespoons breadcrumbs because it seemed a little too moist upon mixing, and cooked them on a skillet with about 10 minutes at the top rack of the oven at the end to get the bacon cooked.  There is definitely a strong onion flavor, which I think is good, but depending on your own preferences you might want to decrease the onion.  They came out perfectly juicy, and the bacon really lends a great flavor.  Next time I make these, I will probably cut the onions finer and cook the bacon a bit prior to wrapping the burgers, just for ease of cooking.

This was great. Very moist and had a nice flaver. I put more Wor. Sauce in than called for and also added about 3 cloves of minced garlic since we love garlic. A couple of my burgers burned on the outside where the bacon was so next time I will probably use thick sliced bacon so it doesn't burn up. All in all, we liked it. 5 stars BABY!!!

It was delicious!!! I haven't changed a thing except substituting onions with shallots (I had to use them up). Burgers turned out full of flavor, juicy inside and crispy outside. Bacon definitely adds to this recipe unique taste and presentation.  I even ate this hamburger without bun and other regular burger stuff. It made a grate dinner just with the salad on the side.

I thought these burgers were very good but I made a big mistake - i used a 90/10 hamburger meat and should have used a less lean meat.  In my honest opinion i thought they could have used a little more taste - because without the bacon the taste was just ok.  But I also didnt put the grated cheese in the burger we put it on top after the burger was cooked so that could have made a difference (I couldn't find my cheese grater).  We will definitely try this recipe again but i will do it exactly as it says.  Oh and one last thing i omitted was the egg there was no reason for it.

Loved these burgers.  I made them following the recommendations of Meagan Williamson (front page) and made Belles Hamburger buns to go with them (also from this site).  The combination was wonderful!  Will definitely make again.

Tasted ok but not really any better than a plain burger. Couldnt really see the advantage in mixing ingredients like chesse and onion into the patty rather than just sticking them in the burger sandwich. Also i dont really see how the sloppy mixture was supposed to sit on a grill without falling through and i also dont know what kind of long-ribbon-like rashers of bacon this cook uses that can wrap around a burger. I had to cook it in the oven on a tray with the bacon sat ontop of the burger; the only way it was physically possible to cook this crazy recipe. All in all probably not worth bothering with.

These burgers are delicious and very well-seasoned. The only problem I encountered was that they didn't hold together well when it was time to flip them on the grill. Other than that, it's delicious and the recipe is a definite repeat!

The bacon took forever to cook, next time I would half way precook the bacon or something, to speed it up. the rest of the burger was done.

I made these the other night and they turned out fantastic.  My husband has said, more than once, that these are the best burgers he's ever eaten.  I would agree with him, so I'm making them again for dinner tonight.

Good taste, but not great. I used onion powder instead of chopped onion, a five-cheese blend instead of just cheddar, and did them in the broiler. I also left out the salt. They were nice and juicy, no problems with falling apart or bacon cooking unevenly or burning. My husband thought they had too much Worcestershire flavor, so I'll reduce the amount next time. Maybe they'll be 5 stars when we do them on the grill.

WOW...what a burger! So juicy and yummy! My husband who loves burgers admitted that these are by far the best burgers he has ever tasted. I second it!
This recipe has become our standard recipe which we will use again and again. Thank you for posting it!!

These tasted sooo good!  I thought that maybe a little rolled oats could be added to the patties so that they are a little less likely to fall apart.

Loved this recipe.  I did not use the egg, added a little garlic & used Lipton onion soup mix instead of chopped onion. Cooked the bacon & placed it on top of the burger. The entire family loved it, including my daughter who is not especially fond of hamburgers.  Will use this every time.

I didn't have bacon, but they still came out pretty good. The patties shrunk a lot after cooking so I would suggest forming larger patties than usual. There seemed to be too much "stuff" in the burger though. I like mine a bit more meaty.

Like others I did not use the egg to avoid the meatloaf texture.  I substituted the ketchup with steak sauce.  I used 1 small onion with 2 lbs of ground chuck.  I didn't use any bacon and I just put on a slice of cheddar when they were done.  The burgers were very good and juicy.  But, they need more flavor.  Next time I'm going to try some cayenne pepper to give it a little kick.  With a little spice this would be a 5 star recipe.

My husband found this recipe and made them for me one night.  I loved them!  They were so juicy and yummy!  We made them for a family dinner and everyone requested we make them again when we all go on vacation this summer together.  Also, we prefer them with BBQ sauce on them.

Loved this.  However, my husband preferred regular drab hamburgers.  Go figure!  Younger son & his friends loved them too!  They look great & I wouldn't be afraid to make them & serve to guests.

My family didn't care for this recipe. I tried to cook these on the grill and they completely fell apart. They were much too moist to hold together. We ate them like a steakburger but they taste was just okay.

Good, not wonderful, but that's probably because I messed it up a bit! I didn't have an egg, forgot the ketchup, used onion powder instead of onion, and accidentally used maple flavored bacon (that flavor was *certainly* out of place!) So, I'm not the best cook, but this recipe was good enough to make me want to try again... That must mean something!

Excellent. Just got done eating these and they were so good. I doubled the recipe and ended up using a lb more of hamburger as they seemed too mushy. I have more hamburger mix left so I'm going to pan fry them tommorow. I used seasoned and garlic salt + a little garlic powder. I was nervous they were going to fall through the grate so I froze them while the grill was burning and didn't have any trouble with them. They taste like grilled meatloaf with smokey bacon.

LOVE LOVE LOVE this recipe. A HUGE hit with my husband. Three years later and we are still using this recipe!  Instead of salt and pepper, I use McCormick Montreal Chicken Seasoning and leave the bacon off...these are the perfect burger.

These were the best!  I made them for a family get together and no one could get enough.  I also made them with turkey using the same recipe and they were great as well.

I could not believe how moist and juicey these burgers were!!!!!!  I did not mix in the two cheeses.  I put a slice of cheddar on near the end of cooking.  We also put 2 slices of bacon instead of one per burger.
I'm sure that was a heart attack waiting to happen but we won't make them too often!!!! GOTTA TRY!

These hamburgers were excellent!  I made them in advance and froze them.  Took them out of the freezer and right to the grill.  I'm making them again this weekend!  Thanks for a great recipe!

Great recipe.  My husband requests this over and over again.  The only change he initially suggested (I'm not kidding) was to add two pieces of bacon instead. We now refer to it as the "hot cross buns" burgers.

I'm giving this recipe three stars because I thought they weren't bad, but my husband found the combination of two types of cheese plus the bacon made them heavy and "fatty" tasting.  I won't be making these again, but I think they're worth trying at least once to decide for yourself if the taste and texture works for you.

This was an excellent recipe.  I followed it to a "T". This will definitely be in my meal rotation from now on.  I also made a few without bacon for my non-pork eaters in the family.  With or without bacon, they all raved!

These burgers turned out amazing. My mother used to make hamburger patties with a slice of bacon wrapped around the edges. I was thinking about her when I went in search of such a recipe. This recipe is my mom's on steroids! Absolutely delicious. I didn't have Worcestershire or ketchup, so I substituted salsa.

EXCELLENT! The hamburger patties were very flavorable.  I'm not an experience griller so for a beginner my family was very pleased.  I followed the recipe just as instructed and I will definitely make it again.

Very tender, juicy, and tasty!  We all really loved this   burger.  My husband did not enjoy cooking it. His complaint was that it was hard to get the bacon done without oercooking the beef. I made the patties small to fit small buns and used thick bacon. I recommend that you use thin bacon and/or precook it part way before you wrap the burger.  The burger was a little  crumbly. Wrapping the bacon over the top and bottom like an X ,instead of around the side helped to keep it together.

Grilled meatloaf and not particularly good meatloaf at that.
Weak flavor, except for the bacon which overwhelmed the meatloaf patties.

These burgers are an absolute hit!  Moist and tender.  I've taken to making 5-6lb of meat, forming 5oz. patties, then freezing them.  So easy to take out a few and have a wonderful meal.  
I'm tailgating in a few weeks, and will drop the size of the burgers to a "slider", and grill them.  Can hardly wait!

2018 - these are the hit of our tailgate parties!  Make ahead and grill on the flat-top!  Freeze uncooked leftovers, and they are still great!  (I do leave out the bacon wrap, as it's just not necessary.)

Made this as directed. Note, use thin bacon and you will NOT need the toothpicks. The lean meat needs the bacon juices and the thin bacon molds to the shape of the burger perfectly. Very tastey. Made it for the 4th of July party and ran out of burgers long before everyone was done with seconds. WOW! Never happened before! This is a keeper.

I haven't made this yet...tonight for dinner.  however, reading the other reviews..i am going to take OUT the egg and add some italian bread crumbs..just to see if it holds together a little better ...also i am going to precook the bacon, just a little to give it a headstart...make so its still flexable enough.  So wish me luck and i will be back to share how it turned out!!!  thanks

Love these burgers!  My fiance bought thick cut bacon so just in case, he fried the bacon in a pan just for a few minutes to make sure it would be fully cooked along with the burger.  Other than that, we made the recipe as stated.  Delicious!

I didn't make the burgers from this recipe, I just seasoned some burgers from Omaha Steaks (thanks mom and dad).  I used 2 strips of bacon per burger  with one toothpick each and was pleased to find out how well this worked.   This is how I will make bacon burgers on the grill from now on.

So stuffed! I had so much fun making this and it turned out great! I love the way the egg gives the burger that added texture. I topped it with pickled jalapeños because they're my favorite but other than that I would not change this recipe.

A great recipe. I left out the cheese cause.... Next time I'll double the bacon.  Everything is better with more bacon. The secret here is to dial down the heat on the grill and flip these burgers many times. Don't burn them. Thanks for sharing the recipe.

While I can see why some might use an egg, I 86'd it. The burgers did crumble just a smidge but it was a fair trade off. Also went with bbq over catsup, tasted great, upped the L&P a dash, used a grass fed beef which came out well. White Oak Pastures if you want the name. Used the cast iron grill pan by Lodge. I cooked them about 8-9 minutes flipping once, results were med rare to med just like we enjoy. 

Memo to home cooks...let the burgers rest for a good 5 minutes to allow the juices to return into the meat, trust me will up your burgers a good notch or two.  The recipe is great, will add a lot of flavor to your burgers. I cooked the bacon separately and also went with blue cheese, personal preference.  Will make again

I made this and even my picky eaters loved it.  I used 93% lean meat and doubled the bacon.

It was great, I made it with Green peppers, adobo, and eggs. I wish maybe I should of added more of the recommended seasonings to make it taste sweeter.

I have made these several times for my family, and this past weekend, I served them at my wedding.  They were a huge hit, got many, many compliments.  My husband doesn't eat beef, so I usually make these with turkey, chicken, or pork, and they are all equally delicious.

I made this burger and it was very good. I didn't use the egg in my recipe because I read other reviews and they recommended to not use an egg. I also used thick bacon and the bacon cooked quickly but the burger took longer to cook, so I would recommend using a lower temperature. The burger also seemed to have too much onion in it, so I recommend using about half of the amount in the recipe.

These were the best burgers I've ever had! Usually when you grill burgers, they have a tendency to dry out a little. Not these! Juicy, flavorful, and simply unbeatable!!!

hint when making larger burger patties - after patted out, poke a hole with your finger in the middle.  As it cooks and shrinks up the hole closes and the center cooks more evenly!

These were not the best burgers I have ever made, I tend not to add liquid ingredients to the burger because it tends to make them fall apart. I do admit I cooked it inside (it's January) in a grill pan. The burgers barely held together, and I was not going to add bread crumbs to better hold it together. The bacon was not crispy and the burgers to me were crumbly, will not make this again.

Extremely moist and juicy burger.  I took another reviewer's suggestion and left the egg out.  I love cheese so I added Parmesan, mozzarella and cheddar cheese.  I also added ketchup, frank's hot sauce and smoked paprika to my mixture.

These are yummy. I've found it difficult to find a homemade beef patty recipe that actually tastes good and this one does. I give it 4 stars as I find the process of cooking with bacon wrapped around them too difficult, I just cook the bacon separately and serve it on top.

We did not particularly care for these. THey are difficult to cook as the cheese in the beef gets stuck to the grill, even using cooking spray. Also, the bacon was not cooked by the time the burgers were done, leaving us with semi-raw, chewy bacon to contend with at each bite. I won't be making these again.

This was really good. I followed the advice of some reviewers and chopped up the bacon and cooked it first, then mixed it into the raw meat and grilled it. I used ground turkey.  Believe it or not, we couldn't taste the cheese.  It was the best burger we've had in a long time.

These are the best burgers ever!! I made them exactly as stated in the recipe but since I only had thick cut bacon I pre cooked the bacon in the oven at 375 degrees for about 15 minutes. They have awesome flavor and are sooooo juicy and easy to make. Husband loved them and I will be making them again! Thanks to the submitter!

Was looking for a way to improve plain old burgers and tried this last night.  I doubled the recipe and also supplemented BBQ sauce for ketchup.   I also only used 1/2 small onion ( puréed) for the double recipe and I did use 2 eggs and about 1/4 cup Italian flavored breadcrumbs (to prevent burgers from falling apart).  My family (including my 6 yr old and 15 month old son) devoured them (no bacon on theirs)!   My husband enjoyed as well but suggested omitting bacon next time leith double recipe I froze remainder of them)!  Thanks for the great recipe!

One of the best home burger recipes I've ever come across.  Bacon not required  I skip the fishy sauce and replace it with soya sauce - and omit salt.

I thought the taste of these was pretty good, but I really felt like I was eating a mini-meat loaf instead of a hamburger.  My husband felt the same as well.  I tried this when looking for a "gourmet burger" recipe.  The flavors blended well together, but I think next time I will focus on what my dad used to call "a good dew" to put on top of the burger, rather than adding in ingredients.  This was tasty, but I would categorize this as grilled meatloaf, not grilled burger.

These were great.  Wanted a burger base, just to give me an idea os measurements...dead on.  This worked well for 1.5lb of meat.  I added a little xtra Worcestershire...give it a tangy kick.  Left out the Egg.  Great burger base.  Topped with blue cheese!

These are some of the most fantastic berguers you will eat! Watch out with the cheddar though as the flavor can get a bit overwhelming (especially if you put cheddar slices on the burger. I usually cheddar called for in the recipe by half.

Great recipe! I had an extra pound of ground beef and used 4 tablespoons of hickory BBQ sauce instead of ketchup, added 2 tablespoons of dijon mustard, replaced the onion with 5 minced cloves of garlic, didnt use the egg but crushed up blue corn tortilla chips instead and added an extra half cup of shredded cheddar. Great inspiration!

These burgers tasted great.  They took only a few minutes to throw together with my teenage daughter.  We made the burger patty exactly as written, but had no bacon to top them with.  I am sure they would have been even better with it! They turned brown quickly so we reduced the heat so that they could cook more slowly.  I suspect it was because of the ketcup, worchestershire, or cheese.   Thanks for the recipe.

These were really good.  I used very low fat (96% lean) ground beef which usually makes for a pretty dry burger but this recipe really made it juicy.  I completely missed the ketchup in the recipe, I'll try it next time.  I'm not sure that the bacon did much but it tasted good.  I don't think I'll make a traditional hamburger ever again!

Without a doubt, the best burgers I have ever made. I added a tsp of cayenne and used white cheddar. We served these for Super Bowl and got more compliments than I have ever received.

Oh, this was delicious!  The only complaint I had is similar to ones others have had.  The bacon doesn't seem to get cooked quite right.  This burger compares with the hamburger recipes I have always used. I didn't think anything could compete, and this stuff is pretty close!  Thanks Jan!

OK burgers, but bacon gets rubbery and inedible. Had better burgers I've just seasoned myself with whatever concoctions. Interesting idea, but really falls flat.

Delicious taste!  I did have the same problem as some others with them falling apart because they were so moist from all the wet ingredients.

These burgers were fabulous. The flavor is wonderful and they are so moist. My bacon did get very crispy but the moistness of the burgers evened that out. My fiance even liked them and he only likes plain burgers, just meat with salt and pepper. He really enjoys them. It is just the two of us, but I made it for 6 servings and just froze the rest and they also turned out wonderful!

I had to make sure to press the burgers very well with the bacon already wrapped around them. Then added the toothpick they stayed secure on the BBQ. The men loved them. Just be very careful to remove the toothpicks before eating!

First off this does not make 6 burgers.  It makes 4-5.  When grilling, I had severe flare up problems, likely from the bacon grease.  The toothpicks actually caught fire and burned away.  The burger did not stay together well-  of 5 1 fell apart beyond hope of rescue, and one nearly so.  Of the ones which survived, the flavor was good, but I didn't get the cheese.  I would leave it out and put some on top next time.  I'd also cut down on the amount of onion, but it did make good filler-  without it this would make 3-4 burgers instead of 4-5.

I made these burgers but only had precooked bacon in the house. So I was unable to wrap the burger in the bacon. I made the recipe exactly minus the cheddar cheese and just added bacon on top. I also added ketchup, mayonaise, provolone cheese, lettuce, and, tomato to the tops.

I omitted the bacon but kept the rest of the recipe the same. I used buffalo instead of beef. The first time I tried it with half as much egg (one egg for double the recipe) and the burgers fell apart. The next time I tried it with all egg, but burger still fell apart. I will keep looking for a recipe that will hold my buffalo burgers together.

Good recipe, we enjoyed them. Since I had the oven on making Cheesy Ranch Potato Bake also from AR, I just threw them in the oven for about 40 minutes. I got 4 burgers out of the mixture. Almost like little meatloaves. Crossed the bacon on top so it looked good too. Thanks!

Great burger, very moist. I warmed up the bacon so before putting on the grill. I think I'll try without the egg - eggs tend to make the burger prone to falling apart.

We love this burger.....the only burgers we now make....we make them the night before our parties and i think the resting in the chill chest over night helps with the yummyness....we even make them for our camping trips (all ready to go just slap them on the grill and we dont have to worry about having yucky meat hands where its hard to wash your hands)....we have made them with little twist here and there never the same burger twice but always great and  had been a big hit at all the get to gethers we have cooked for.

This was good but I made some changes.  Instead of grilling I pan fried them and I fried the bacon separately. I didn't have any cheddar cheese so I just left that out but I used pepper jack on top of the burgers.  I also diced up cilantro and added that into the burger mix.  This came out really good!

Mmmmmmmmm!!! thaks for the recipe, was sooooo good! I have followed anothers recipes but i did not like the results, ... this one is the best!!! In my case I added bread crumbs, a pinch of oregan and some chopped parsley (sounds weird, but tastes good, my mom does at Mexico).  I like learning to cook, is amusing and satisfactory!!

Hubby rated these 4*. But, I did not like the mess they made of my George Foreman grill. A great, big, awful, cheesy mess. Crusty, melted cheese everywhere because these were far too wet. I'd add half a cup or even more of fresh breadcrumbs next time. Taste is nice.

It was pretty tasty but I still prefer a regular burger with some onions and cheese on top of it.

This tasted good, however, I had trouble with the bacon wrapping all the way around the hamburger patty, and then it gets even smaller as it grills, and then it falls off completely! Kind of a pain!!

Wished we'd have pre-cooked the bacon.  This was a cut above your regular burger.

I made this for my family, and they liked it and said they would want it again.  This actually says a lot since they are decently picky eaters.  I loved the recipe, but this is no suprise since I love onions.  I found this recipe easy to prepare and cook.  I found the hamburgers to have just a little extra flavor to them, and I loved it.

My husband rated these burgers 3 stars and said, "Next time just make me a regular hamburger."  I have to admit that these burgers were very moist (maybe to moist)and the taste was O.K., but it was the texture I didn't like.  It's back to regular hamburgers for us, sprinkled with steak rub.

Didn't need a bun - catsup or anyother toppings - yummy all by itself.  I tryed a bit of catsup - it killed the flavor.  Will use over and over.  Also used my Foreman grill.

It was good, but not great. There was too much onion and you need to dice the onions very small or else they fall out of the patty all over the grill.

MMMM Baby! These hamburgers came out juicy and delicious. I made about 50% more than the recipe called for and made bigger patties, which required longer cooking times. I didnt cook them on high, like the recipe called for, for fear of burning the burgers. They came out a little on the rare side but that was fine with me. I nuked one for 1min. in the microwave for lunch today and it was just as good as it was off the grill yesterday. Still very juicy.

These burgers came out very good. I changed a few things in it though, I used minced onions, a little more worchester sauce, and I also used an all-purpose seasoning.

We really enjoyed these.  We did them in a skillet and can only imagine how much better they would be on the grill!  I did have to add a little bread crumbs and they still were very "wet".  If I were doing them on the grill, I would have added more as otherwise they would have fallen through the grates.  I served them with homemade fries and the meal was a hit.  I fried up some mushrooms too, however, I forgot to add them to the burgers so I can't comment on how the'd be together.  :(

No grill available so I did them in a skillet. Cooking time was long and bacon wasn't crispy enough. Nevertheless, the taste was excellent - no need for condiments. Served them on large sesame buns accompanied by Cesar Salad on the plate. Would definitely try on the Bar-B next summer - probably would rate higher.

Unless I was missing something I only got 2 medium burgers and 2 shrimpy burgers that didn't fill the size of the bun. Next time I will make 3 per pound. But this aside it was FANTASTIC! Very moist and tender will definitely make again.

Very tasty burger,good recipe, Only issue I had was keeping the bacon on the burgers I tried it three different ways. 
1st I wraped it around(bacon came off)
2nd I wraped it over and under. the burger( bacon stuck to the grill, came off  and made a mess )
3rd I ground the bacon to a puree and added it to the mixture.( now I am well known for my juice tasty bugers  among friend and family and tailgaters).
Ps leave out the salt and  or cheese You will have salty bugers

What a great burger! The whole family loved it!!! I used microwave bacon, as that is all I had on hand and just added it to the top when the burgers were done cooking. And we added another slice of cheese on top. I'm adding this to our favorites. Thanks!

These were very good burgers, but I am giving them 4 stars because I couldn't keep them together! We had to throw one patty away after it turned into ground up hamburger on the grill pan. So I may add oats or bread crumbs next time to help them stay together. I put the bacon on top of the burgers instead of around them (only had pre-cooked bacon) but we didn't even need cheese or condiments on top they were so good!

These burgers are delicious and one of my favorites!  We used 1/2 ground chuck and 1/2 ground sirloin to make up for the the ground beef.  Turns out really well with great flavor.  Will make over and over!!

These turned out fantastic, I grilled the hamburgers, then wrapped the bacon in foil on the grill.  Awesome.

These hamburgers were great. I forgot to put the tbl of ketchup in. The recipe is for six but I only got three and I had 1.29lbs of ground beef.

These burgers are very good and I love how simple the ingredients are.  I've made them for a family gathering and everyone loves them.  My only problem is cooking them too long to cook the bacon because then you can't keep the burger's pink in the middle which is how we like them.  But - GREAT FLAVOR!!!

These were so yummy!  My family loved them!  We made them for friends and they loved them as well!  I left out the egg and wrapped the bacon on the top in stead of around so that it cooked better. Thanks for the recipe!!

Awesome- just phoned my family and told them that I will put them in awe when they visit- my brother and dad can't wait. I made them a bit thick so I had to cut my small kids patties in half but they ate it all.

These were so yummy! We didn't think 1 pd beef would be enough, so we used 1 1/2 pds instead. Wonderful recipe, thankyou for sharing! This is going in the recipe box!

These burgers were very good.  They certainly did not last long here.  The only change I made was to used dried diced onions (I ran out of onions) instead of fresh ones.  Also, we grilled ours with woodchips to enhance them with a nice, smoky flavor.  I also used extra thick bacon, which didn't cook as crisply as regular would, so I'll use regular bacon next time.  I will certainly be making these again.

These were delicious.  I did not use onion because my husband dislikes onions.  I did add some onion powder.  The burgers did not fall apart and the bacon cooked up fantastic.  These will be made a number of times this summer.

A very tasty  change from plain burgers.  Also a good solution for low fat hamburger (that tends to break apart on the grill) or hamburger previously frozen (same problem).

Made the burgers inside on the stove.  I thought they were pretty good!  My husband thought they were okay and that they tasted like meatloaf.  Try for yourself, not a bad recipe!

I always add spices to my taste so I suggest you do the same.  These are some of the best burgers I had.  My son reheated the leftovers when he got home from work they were already refridgerated.  He too thought even reheated it was the best ever.  I say give them a shot!

These burgers were absolutely delicious!  After finding a pound of burger in the freezer on a weekend when I was babysitting 3 kids, I decided burgers would be perfect.  I used turkey bacon instead of regular bacon 'cause that's all we had, but it also helps to make it a little better for you.

I'm going to give Jan 4 stars on her recipe.  YES - the burgers were especially tender and moist.  The problem was that they were a bit bland.  Happy with the juicy, unhappy with the taste.

I have had these cooked on the grill yesterday which was pretty good, but today I used my George Foreman grill to do just one, and it came out fabulous.  It was so juicy and delicious. I cooked it for 5 mins in the grill, then opened and put a slice of cheese on top.  I skipped the bacon both days, too much extra fat...

This recipe is delicious! I normally am not a fan of hamburgers but this one is very tasty. I don't like onion so I added onion powder instead and I added more parmesan cheese. I didn't put bacon around the burger but it still tasted awesome. I have a hamburger press from Tupperware which made them really easy to form. My husband thought that they would crumble on the BBQ but they didn't (I think because of the cheese holding them together). They have become a staple meal in our household!

The recipe was a good blend of flavorings, we used 95% Ground Round and found it somewhat dry - like our burgers a little juicy.  Will try this again, but will either use a 85-90% Fat or I heard if you blend in ice chips to the meat patties prior grilling it moistens them.   Will have to let you know.

An absolute hit with every member of the family (husband, picky 5-year-old, and the 3-year-old)!  Super moist and delicious!

This is great!  Thank you so very much. I cut back on the onion and added some fresh chopped mushrooms. It made three large burgers. I used two strips of bacon for each. We loved them!

These were some really good hamburgers. We had trouble with the bacon part, though. I used center cut bacon and it wasn't long enough to be wrapped all the way around the burger. So, I just cooked the bacon inside the house. Even doing it that way, these were still wonderful!

We made these today, grilled them this evening and the whole family votes thumbs up! While the mixture was "marinating" in the fridge hubby sneaked some bread crumbs in the mixture. Not sure I liked that, but the taste of the burgers was great. I added one tbs of A-1 steak sauce, some garlic powder, 3/4 cup of sharp cheddar cheese and used 1 1/2 lbs of ground beef. My all time favorite burger recipe from this site is Blue Cheese Burgers (I used feta) but these are very good. Thanks for the post. It's spring time here, ladies and gentlemen: Start Your Grills!

I loved this recipe. I have a hard time keeping homemade burgers from drying out on the BBQ but these burgers were super moist (must be all the cheese). I omitted the bacon and it was still delicious.

Appreciate your sharing this great recipe, Jan!  Made them a couple of times.  Last time I used feta instead of cheddar and parmesan and they were still so awesome.  A keeper!
