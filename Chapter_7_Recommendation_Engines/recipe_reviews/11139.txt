I substituted Pecans for this recipe and made them on a Sunday and brought them to work on Wednesday, and got so many compliments.  They are delicious -- some one said, "Oh, good, there will be more tomorrow."  Definitely a five star recipe.

I made this recipe as part of my holiday cookie baking. It sounded good and it was a change from all of the chocolate confections. Unfortunately, they just weren't that appealing and most of them were still left after Christmas.

VERY sweet candy-like balls. I couldn't wait to refrigerate the apricot snips overnight so I skipped that part and made them right then. I think they turned out fine!

This was a faceless recipe and I decided to give it a try since I had all the ingredients on hand.  Very pleased with how the recipe turned out. This is an easy to make recipe - which can be considered a candy as well as a cookie.  I recalculated the recipe for 12 servings.  I used the food processor for chopping the nuts, wafers and coconut.  A very nice Apricot Confection that would dress up a tray for special occasions.

Absolutely delicious; not a cookie I would make everyday but it is a pleasant change from the regular cookies--dried fruit is a nice change to the usual texture and is awesome when you can eat it in two or three bites! a real keeper; thank-you for the lovely recipe.

It was too gooey to hold shape into balls even after adding more crushed wafers to give it texture.
