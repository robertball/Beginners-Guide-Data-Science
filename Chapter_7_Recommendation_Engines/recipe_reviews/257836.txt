The main reason we purchased the airfryer was for french fries. They are crispy outside and fluffy inside. The fact that they are healthy keeps them on the table weekly, whereas before we only ate them on special occasions. They are truly a delight. The kids and their friends even know how to make them on their own and have stopped eating greasy fries from fast food joints. This recipe is spot on down to the minute.

I used a different Air Fryer and it works well with other brands. Lawry's seasoned salt is nice too.

Excellent! I think I may have cooked them a tad too long but will shorten that the next time I make these. SO good! Thanks for sharing this.

Very impressed. For such a simple recipe it was delicious! My family loved it. I double the recipe for my family of 5 and added a squirt of sweet and spicy bbq sauce. Added some homemade french fries and this was a hit. Easy weekday dinner. Will be making this again for sure. The double recipe left enough for after school sandwiches for the kids. Yum!

Made these as my first air fryer recipe.  I need to get used to the fryer, but for my first attempt, I thought these were really good. Not greasy at all. Definitely needed seasoning.

we are new to air baking and found that the first batch of fries were slightly greasy and the bottom of the basket wasn't cooked or brown as shown in the photos.

I added old bay to mine. Took a little longer to cook cause I think for my first time had too many fries in basket.
