Pretty good.  This is a good recipe to have on hand if you don't have time to marinate.

Big thumbs up from the family when served.  We added mushrooms to the remaining sauce and served it in a gravy boat.

Was extremely hesitant about using BBQ sauce on steak, and even more concerned with using tomato soup as it might be too sweet.  The kids really enjoyed the steak, the adults were not as impressed.  We all missed the usual method of cracked pepper, garlic and a bit of liquid smoke.  Props for having a nice glaze on the beef, but this didn't do it for us.
