This makes a great cookie - my husband asked for another batch and it's hard to find a recipe he likes better than his mom's!

OMG!  When the man in the house says 'keep that recipe' - it's a top 5 keeper!  Fabulously easy; I baked them 11 to a sheet - 4 on the outside and 3 up the middle - giving them a bit of room to spread.  Used a basic cookie scoop and packed them a smidge generous.  Baked them 13 minutes per tray - and I put the upper rack 'up' a level.  Came out chewy, not crisp (and I think these would be good crisp, too).  I used dates and pecans as listed, but I'm positive that chocolate chips would be good as well.  I'm putting this one in the holiday rotation this December.  I expect my mom will be looking for the recipe.

Deeelicious! I used all butter, chocolate chips instead of the fruit and nuts, and subbed 1/4 c ground flaxmeal for 1/4 c of the flour. Got to love hidden goodness. These will be a new favorite cookie in our house.

Great Cookie! I substituted chocolate chips for the raisins and left out the nuts. Cookies have a nice chewy texture and the coconut adds nice flavor. I think this would be a GREAT bake Sale cookie :)

Did I miss where the egg was added?  I beat egg and added same time as milk. I substituted half the flour w/ whole wheat flour, and instead of shortening, used 1/2 c. butter and 3/4 c. coconut oil.  Also, I used sucanat instead of white sugar.  Creaming the shortening/sugar doesn't quite come out the same, but the cookies were still great!

These were really good and chewy, just like the name says.  I omitted the coconut though since I didn't have any, but I think they'd even be better with coconut next time.

Loved it!  I didn't have butter flavored shortening so I used 1 cup regular and then 1/4 cup stick of butter (margarine).  I didn't have dates.  I used butterscotch chips and pecans.  I know oatmeal cookies are usually flat so I don't punish this recipe for that.  I was looking for chewy and these do the trick!  If I could only find a fat, chewy oatmeal cookie I'd be happy!  ;o)

Sorry but I thought these were very bland. I wouldn't make these again!
