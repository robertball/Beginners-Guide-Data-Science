I only used 1cup of sugar and it was still a little too sweet. I still loved it.

I made this using canned peaches and razberries,(it's what I had). it was divine. once my husband got a hold of it he devoured the whole thing. I made an adjustment on the crust, I used pkgd cinnamon rolls for the crust. just made it that much better!

Great pie! However, I agree with the other reviewer to cut way back on the sugar...and add a touch of salt to bring out the flakes.

This was so easy and so delicious! My family has requested it be added to the Thanksgiving desserts menu along with the other usual pies and goodies. Although this will be one of my go to pies, along with the Cherry Berry pie from this site.

I used fresh peaches and fresh raspberries and reduced the amount of sugar in the recipe.  It was a BIG hit

I only used 1/2 cup of sugar and it seemed to be just right.  Not too sweet and not too tart.  I used frozen fruit, as the recipe indicated, but I had to bake for an additional 20 minutes at 375 degrees.  Super simple recipe and delicious result.

Very good and easy. I reduced sugar to 2/3 cup total, but I had more peaches than raspberries and prefer pies to not be too sweet. Took a little longer to bake but turned out great, thanks!

Pie was delicious and the easiest I've ever made!! I would recommend covering the edge of crust with foil sooner or using lattice method because the top crust is slower to cook with all the juices. Dessert was the quietest 10 min all day. Ha!

This is my favorite pie. It's both tangy and sweet. Easy as . . .pie!  :-)
