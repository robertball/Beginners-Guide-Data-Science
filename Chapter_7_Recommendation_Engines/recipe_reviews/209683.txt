I whipped this up last night figuring I could pass it off as ‘noodles and sauce’ to the kids. Boy, what a hit! They ate it without complaint, and even had seconds. I took the leftover noodles and garlic bread to work today and shared some with a coworker. This recipe is going in to the rotation.

I made for dinner last night. Very good and my family all loved it.  I could see where you could speed up the process a bit by using jarred spaghetti sauce with the ground beef instead of the tom. paste and envelope of sauce...but it was very good.

This was good.  Next time, I'd probably just mix everything together (instead of doing layers) and pour in to the pan.  It would just save some time with probably a similar result.  I probably also wouldn't simmer the sauce for so long to cut on time it takes to get it to the table.  Worth a try!

this was pretty good.  I did use a can of spaghetti sauce to make it quick and easy.  I mixed it together instead of layering it.

It really does taste like lasagna with sour cream!  I, too, just threw everything together and baked it; simple, easy and tasty.  And the leftovers are wonderful!  (Just be careful if reheating in the microwave.  You might want to use a lower power.)

This recipe was not bad, but it is nothing special.  I'm surprised at all the great reviews that made it sound so outstanding.  It has very little flavor.  Followed the recipe closely, but ended up sprinkling garlic and Italien seasoning over the top, b/c it was just too bland.  Also, used to extra cheese trying to "liven" it up a bit.  Will not make again.

This was just ok for me.  The family liked it, but I think it can be changed a little and will be even better. I didn't care much for the package spaghetti sauce seasoning.  Next time I will use tomato sauce and stewed tomatoes or use a jar sauce.  Also, some cheddar cheese will add more flavor.

We enjoyed this dinner - it was simple and satisfying.  I did cheat and just used a jar of spaghetti sauce instead of the water/seasoning packet/tomato paste combo.  Instead of doing the layers, I just mixed it all together and then baked it in the oven.  I did add a little extra seasoning when browning the meat (some steak seasoning) and adding some garlic powder to the sour cream mixture.

My family and I didn't love the flavor of this dish.  It was a little too tangy and overwhelming.

I was in a hurry one night so didn't have time to bake it so I cut down on ingredients and made it on top of the stove.  This is a possibly for a quick dinner:  Boil 4 oz. rotini or any noodle while cooking beef in large skillet, drain beef. Add one jar of spaghetti sauce, cover and simmer.  Add cream cheese, stirring til mixed thoroughly. Drain noodles and stir into beef mixture.  Sprinkle with parmesan cheese and shredded cheddar cheese, cover until melted.  Serve with salad and garlic bread.  It's similar to lasagna, but very quick.

My husband made this and he LOVED it and I thought it was Ok.  I would recommend not layering the ingredients and mix them all together, I think this would help it be more consistent.  Our daughter ate it and thought it was pretty good- she gave it 4 stars.  I added a lot more cheese to the top of it, because we are huge cheese fans :)

I thought this was good.  It's easier if you mix it all together instead of layering it.  The cream cheese was hard to spread over the sauce. My kids liked it and wanted more.  I also used more cheese then it called for.

Awesome!  Everyone in my family ate it.  Takes a bit of time to prepare with a spaghetti packet for the sauce (which I didn't even realize was a thing).  Makes the sauce taste more authentic.  If you have the time, definitely worth it!

This looked like something my Grandmother made about 40 years ago, a great memory of her, I thought. Wow, I was correct! Not too fancy, but that was not the point. Good, and filling, and miraculously, something that my picky kid not only wanted to try, but ate and then begged me to save so she could  eat the leftovers.
I did save them for her, and  I made a version the following evening with 1/2 lb ground Italian sausage and almost a whole bag of fresh baby spinach for me and my husband.  Husband and I loved both versions, and the kid ate her leftovers and some of our new casserole, so we are all  disgustingly full, and so very happy.
Thank you, this was just what we needed on a  cold, January evening!

Made as the recipe stated except I used my own homemade spaghetti sauce, as I had just made a large pot this morning. This was excellent! I was searching for a recipe to use up the last bit of cream cheese and some left over pasta, and this was amazing. Will definitely be making again.

Just OK but my husband loved it. I have been making a similar recipe, a stuffing in bell peppers for years.  That one was easier as it had tomato soup.  In this recipe, I used ground turkey, used cilantro in place of parsley, pepper cheese along with Parmesan, and added black pepper.  Maybe next time I will mix everything together.  I was worried the sauce was too thin but it wasn't.  Lots of steps = lots of dishes.

This was easy to make. I would have liked the cheese to be more spread out. It seemed clumpy. I think if I make it again I would mix the cheese mixture in with my noodles and then layer. I added some garlic. My boys liked it but my bf said it was missing something but couldn't put his finger on what.
