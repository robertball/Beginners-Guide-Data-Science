I was very skeptical about this dish...I don't really know why but intially, it didn't appeal to me.  However, I made this per my boyfriend's request. He asked me to make a pizza-like dish without having to make actually make a pizza or the ones that have the noodles in it. I used italian sausage instead of beef, added a chopped green bell pepper, and instead of using 2 pkg biscuit dough, I had a can of "Pillsbury Grands" = which are large and thick. I split the refridgerated biscuits horizontally in half and layered them, following the remaining instructions. Its a little salty for my taste (not sure why????) but good and my boyfriend really seemed to enjoy this alot. Although I'm still trying to figure out where the saltiness came from (the sausage perhaps?) overall, it was pretty good and I might make this again when my boyfriend has a craving for his "pizza dish." Thanks Ginny.

A great inexpensive way for a quick pizza. However, I made just plain cheese and it was very good. I've found that it turns out better in a glass baking dish since a metal one browns it up on the bottom a bit more and quicker before the topping is done. I've already made this multiple times and will continue to.

We love, love, love this recipe!!  We "have" to have it at least once a week (if not more).  This is something I can prepare the night before, and hubby puts in the oven right before I get home from work.  My daughter has to have at least 2 helpings (unusual!!).  I have slight variations:  I use plain 'ole tomato sauce (2 8oz cans) instead of pizza sauce, and put italian spices in the meat or the sauce.  I also don't use the sausage we use regular pepperoni.  I also cut up onion and green pepper into tiny pieces and cook with the hamburger, as well as using the food processor to chop up a can of mushrooms and putting them in the sauce.  Absolutely no one noticed, and they still gobbled it down.  i used cheap biscuits they worked great.  And I made it with the biscuits cut up and not cut up, I prefer cut up, it's easier for the kids.  All in all, a wonderful recipe!  Definitly on my list every week!!  thanks!

This was tasty and I was surprised how tall it rose. I used 3 "7.5 ounce" cans of biscuits. Use only 2 if you prefer a thinner crust. For those of you who had problems with the crust drying out too much, be sure to cover the ENTIRE crust with, especially the edges and corners. Also for those who thought the crust tasted like too much like biscuits, use the old fashioned (non-flaky) biscuits rather than the buttermilk ones. TY and will keep this in my file!!!

I've made something like this several times before, but lost my recipe and had to look up the temperature and time. This is pretty much fool proof. I just dump everything together in a bowl and spread it out in a 13x9 inch pan.  I don't bother with layers and it turns out really nicely. You can add any ingredients you want to this, my favorite being bacon (already mostly cooked through to loose a good amount of the grease) onion, and ground beef, with a little bit of the cheddar cheese mixed in with everything as well as on top. Super easy and good.

Loved it!  I was out of mozzarella, so I substituted Colby Jack and it was awesome.

This is a delicious and easy favorite for this family on the go. Since my husband and 2 sons all like different pizza toppings, I solved the problem by dividing the ingredients into 2 deep dish pie plates and had one "adult friendly" and one "kid friendly" dish. Baked a little quicker and worked out great. Thanks Ginny!

I, too, was skeptical about this recipe, but it is now a family favorite.  Look for Walmart brand biscuit as they are the only ones I have found to have no trans fats.  I vary the toppings every time I make this, but even my young nephew asks for more.  It's amazing.

I made this without the ground beef - just layered the quartered biscuits, then pizza quick sauce, then mozzarrella, then pepperoni (with onions and mushrooms on the grown-up's side). It was DELICIOUS and very easy!! The kids and dad loved it, and I will definitely make again.

Excellent. I didn't use mushrooms and I cut down on the olives and onions for my families tastes.  I didn't cut the biscuits either.

The idea of this pizza is really great.  I brushed the tops of my biscuits with garlic butter and italian seasoning. I topped it with italian sausage and pepperoni and green olives. My 8 year old daughter said this was the best pizza EVER and my husband absolutely loved it. I love how this can be changed up with a variety of toppings...I will definitely be using this one again as a base and do some expiermenting with other toppings too.  I bet this would make a good dessert pizza with the apples drizzled with a glaze...hmmmm

This was an excellent deep dish pizza that my whole family loved, especially my 3 & 5 year olds.  It wasn't "gormet" enough for my husband for five stars but it still hit the spot, and it was EASY to make!  I substituted ground sausage for the beef and "Country Biscuits" for the buttermilk.  I also skipped the onion, black olives, and mushrooms.  It tasted good with the slim toppings, but I'll be experimenting more with this pizza - it's definately got the base to handle it (no soggy dough).  This is a keeper for our family.

I have not made this exact recipe but I wanted to share a little hint because I have been making this for years. If you bake just the biscuits in the pan for the first 10-20 minutes or until they start to rise and get a little golden brown on top, then take out of the oven to add the toppings and return to the oven to finish cooking until everything is heated through and the cheese is melted, the dough cooks better and is less gooey. I have been making this for years and is a fun and easy recipe. We are going on vacation this week and I plan to make it because it is filling and everyone likes pizza.

My family loves this pizza!  Do not make my mistake of changing the amount of sauce, like I tried once - I used the entire jar(we like pizza saucy) and the result was that the biscuit "bubbles" remained uncooked.  We enjoy this for lunch several times a month.

Pretty good for a fast pizza.  I didn't really like the salty biscuit flavor, though.

We love this.  Its fast and easy to put together, and the kids can help.  Its forgiving too, so if you are missing or adding an ingredient, it still comes out tasty. Warm, cheesy, filling, and fairly inexpensive.  We've made several pans of this ahead of time for get togethers, and everyone likes it.  My only change is to get plain biscuits, not buttermilk.  Flavor is much better that way

We've made this dish for a long time and it's a total favorite!  We mix the cut up biscuits in with the sausage, pepperoni & sauce mixture and then turn it into an ungreased 9 x 13.  Super easy and a great hit with the kids.

Yummy and really easy to make..I wouldn't really make any changes to this next time, except for maybe cutting down the recipe to only using 1 container of biscuits instead of 2. It seemed as though 2 was a bit much for the pan..other than that, great recipe, my boyfriend loved it!

Yes, its just tasty.  But, you might as well make lasagna or something.  This is something that hcildren would love.  THe bisquits did make it taste good.  I cooked the bisquits for 8 minutes before everything on top of them.  And I seasoned the beef and the sauce.  I only used beef, pepperoni, and chopped onion and green peppers.  THis is more of a kid-friendly recipe.

A knock off of the classic pampered chef recipe called Bubble Up Pizza. I used homemade spaghetti sauce instead but it is super yummy.

I was pleasantly surprised by this one.  I'm home with just my two 12-year old sons this week, and have been trying to fix things that they would like, so I thought I would try this.  Guess what?  Mom likes it!  I used sausage instead of ground beef, because I had it and seasoned it with garlic, onion, italian seasonings, salt and pepper, and I left off the vegetables since I was spoiling the boys.  I also used some leftover marinara sauce (my own recipe) from meatball subs earlier in the week, rather than pizza sauce.  They liked it, too.  I gotta admit, I never would have thought to do something like this.  Love the imagination involved here!

This is an excellent treat. We LOVED it!!I used bacon instead of pepperoni and only 1 can of biscuits. Sprinkled Mrs. Dash Italian blend on top of the biscuits along with parmesan cheese, before the meat sauce.  Also, I used pasta sauce and added sliced up zucchini.  It turned out wonderful!!  I will definitely use this recipe again and experiment with different toppings!

Really good. I quartered the biscuits and just mixed everything in a bowl and poured it in the pan casserole style, kept the bread from drying out and made it extra tasty! Thanks.

I made this with my little guy yesterday for lunch and we loved it.  We didn't use the ground beef and I added a few veggies to the adult side of the pizza.  I loved the amount of "dough" because I love thick crust pizza, but if you don't I would probably decrease the amount of biscuits used.  This was fast and easy and will definitely be made again!

I changed the toppings but followed the method. :) I used green peppers, pizza deli meat (ham, pepperoni and salami), and all mozzarella. I'll definitely make this again because not only is it delicious, it feeds a crowd and is very inexpensive!

I used to make this with my kids when they are little. Now I have an 8 year old in my life and she likes to help make in when she comes over. This is a really great recipe to get kids cooking in the kitchen because it is easy and fun to make, not to mention that it tastes great too!

We are a family of pizza lovers, and all of us agreed that this wasn't that good. It was quick, and tasted okay, but there was too much dough to topping ratio. I will stick with regular pizza. Thanks.

Love this recipe.  My mom has always made this and it's a HIT!  We mix up the quartered biscuit pieces with the sauce and toppings.  I put all the ingredients in a big bowl, mix, and pour into the greased 9x13.  Love it!

I'm a vegetarian and my kids don't like anything chunky in their sauce, so we just use sauce and cheese but it has become a favorite in our house. Thanks for sharing!

I loved this and my kids thought it was great.  However, I suggest using 1-1/2 package of rolls, the final dish was too tall for me and the cheese almost fell off the pizza.

I made this last night, and it's an excellent recipe! I dumped an entire 15 oz. bottle of Ragu Pizza Sauce on it since I didn't find a 12 oz. container and it wasn't too saucy. Draining the browned beef and pepperoni is a step worth taking, the end product doesn't have a greasy mouthfeel. The chunks of biscuit dough take on a nice and surprisingly strong pizza flavor! I was afraid they might be bland and gummy, but following this recipe step by step worked out very well.

This was very very good...the family gobbled it all up.  This will be a frequent meal around here now I think.  I baked for 25 min.   I should have done 20...and maybe a lower temp.?

I loved this recipe when I first saw it in Quick Cooking magazine (now Simple and Delicious magazine). I've been making it for my family for years. Its agreat recipe and easy to adjust for different tastes. Everybody loves it. I even made a classic pizza version and taco pizza version for a family gathering. yum!

This was easy to make, and my kids loved it for lunch.  I baked this in a 9-inch springform pan to make it easy to cut and remove from the pan.  Did not use the olives or mushrooms, since my kids don't like them.

This was really good! my one suggestion is to use less biscuit dough, one tube at most, and just squish the dough so that is covers the bottom of the dish. I didn't do this and found that it didn't quite cook all the way through. Makes excellent left overs!

I love this recipe.  To cut down on cooking time, I bake the quartered biscuits in the greased pan for about 10 minutes, then I add the toppings (including cheese) and bake for another 10 or until the cheese is melted.  I make this recipe about once a week because my fiance loves it and it is so easy to make.  We've experimented with ingredients a lot, and also made an Alfredo version of the recipe with Alfredo sauce, chicken, bacon, onions and mushrooms.

The concept of this intrigued me so I decided to make it for an after school snack. I made it with bbq sauce,chicken and pineapple!  I mixed the pineapple with the chicken and sauce, spooned it over the cut up biscuits making sure to brush some extra sauce over the exposed biscuits. I used fresh mozzarella and some left over pre shredded cheeses. It was instant hit with my kids and myself!! I will definitely experiment with again!

Based on other ratings I was hoping it would have more flavor by adding additional seasonings, sauce, etc.  Nothing helped.  It was bland, dry and had very little flavor except for the over-powering taste of the refrigerator dough.

I think I first made this after hosting a Pampered Chef show and it was called a Bubble Up pizza made in their stoneware.  I also make it using salsa instead of spaghetti sauce and add items I'd put on nachos or a taco like onion, green peppers, black olives, and a blend of shredded Mexican cheese.

I used a can of Grands biscuits, Prego sauce, cut up canadian bacon, pepperoni, green peppers, onions & mozzarella cheese.  It was delicious and we had very little left over.  The kids couldn't get enough of it.  Served it with a salad.  Easy & quick weeknight meal that satisfies!

Close to the the recipe my mom made when we were kids. In hers you mix sauce with the biscuit pieces instead of the meat, and coat the pan with cooking spray and cornmeal to keep from sticking.

I did this a tad different that makes it AWSOME, mix the bits of dough up with the sauce mixute to keep it from sticking to the pan and makes it all around saucy! I used 2 and a 1/2 jars of ragu pizza sauce since i had one left in the fridge from something else. I will still try with just puouring it on top but think its better mixing it up.

It was okay...it didn't "wow" me.  Cut it in quarters, used pepperoni and ground turkey (I'm plain like that) followed the exact directions.  Everything was done (dough), but it wasn't like ooohhh gotta make this again...lol, nice little snack I guess.

Super simple to make and really yumy. I think I will make this again but without the pepperoni as it added a lot of grease and not much to the actual dish.

Husband doesn't leave any leftovers when I make this. Be careful what type of biscuits you use, though, because some will make the crust too sweet. I'm still experimenting to find just the right type of biscuits for us. Overall, great concept & recipe, though!

Very easy and versatile recipe -- I omitted the meat and just used some thin sliced onions and green pepper and topped with reduced fat mozzerella and mexican cheese blend -- just like regular pizza you can top any way you like -- looking forward to making this again. Thanks for the great idea!

My boyfriends' family has made this dish for a long, long time and we love it! It's perfect for us college students especially when pizza does eventually get old. You can actually put any type of meat into the dish. I actually made this last week and money's been tight and all we had was the pizza sauce, 2 biscuit pkgs, sausage, and cheese, I decided to throw in the only other thing we had, green beans! It was amazing! Next we're gunna try pineapple and sausage, one of our favorite pizzas.

I was pretty pleased.  I used a ceramic dish instead of metal and the bottoms of the biscuits came out just right.  I didn't do the whole meat sauce thing, I just used tomato sauce and put the cheese on, then threw on some onions and broccoli.  It turned out great.

Really didn't like this. The biscuit was way overdone by the time I pulled the final product out of the oven, even though I followed the directions exactly. The toppings seemed disproportionate. I managed to eat one slice. Thought about experimenting with other toppings, but it's really the biscuit dough that's the issue...

Love the ease and flexibility of this recipe.  Throw whatever pizza toppings you want in it.  It did come out a bit doughy for me (thus 4 stars), so I think I would either bake the biscuits some before adding the rest of the stuff or leave the whole thing in an extra 10 minutes.

The recipe definitely has alot of potential and was a great idea but there are a few errors in this recipe. First the biscuits didnt cook all the way through. so I cooked it longer and burned the other ingrediants. I would revise this recipe so that you start cooking the cut up buscuits in the oven 5-10minutes before adding the meat mixture and everything else and cook it for the given length of time. When everything is done add the cheeses. and cook a few minutes. It will taste better if the buscuits are cooked.

Absolutely loved it! And if you don't have refrigerator biscuits, an comparable amount of Bisquik mixed according to directions works just fine!  We used Turkey burger and Turkey pepperoni, and fresh mushrooms, green pepper, onion and sliced black olives.

I had some ingredients in the fridge that needed used and this was the perfect solution. I sprayed the top of the biscuits with a little butter-flavor spray oil and sprinkled on some powdered garlic. I used the tip to mix the sauce and topping ingredients together before spreading on the biscuits. It made it much easier to get even coverage. One of the ingredients I needed to use up was leftover spaghetti sauce made from this site's "Spaghetti Sauce Mix" - I'll never buy pizza sauce again. The concept is the winner - it's pretty foolproof with substitutions. You don't need to be a kid for this to be a favorite. :)

The idea is good, however my family and I did not like the biscuit-y taste. You are better off buying the pizza dough in the tubes right next to the biscuit dough and just making a normal crust with that.

This was one that I was hoping would be much better then it ended up being. My children would not eat it and it was quite dry. It did however fare well reheated for lunch the next day according to my husband... I will not make again.

Easy and very good---too good if your know what I mean! I used the cheapest buttermilk biscuits available. Also used less than 1 ounce of pepperoni diced very small.Used 15 ounce can of pizza sauce. Used italian sausage instead of ground beef---browned and rinsed it very well. Turned out great, most certainly not dry or doughy.

I made this last night for my family and it got mixed reviews. It was very easy to make, but it came out dry. I liked it, but I think next time it will taste much better if I add more pizza sauce just before I add the cheese.  Also, I think I will try adding some other veggies like broccoli and green peppers.  Thanks for the recipe, it was a cinch to make, even for a guy like me!

This was an excellent recipe!!!  I made it yesterday for Valentine's Day and my honey had 3rds and he took it for lunch today.  It reminded me of a Chicago style deep dish pizza.  We're vegetarian, so I eliminated the meat and used lowfat cheese.  It was so good and best of all, it is incredibly quick and easy!  Will definitely be making this again. Mmmmmmmm!

Doesn't get any easier or tastier than this! My ten-year old makes this for dinner and it's become a family favorite. We heat up a second jar of pizza sauce and serve it on the side for dipping.

I made this last night and its more like a 4 1/2 star recipe because of how my "dough" the biscuits end up making when they puff up, but then I love dough so I guess thats okay! I left out the meat since i dont eat it, and it turned out fine without it. Mother-in-law asked me for the recipe so that was a good sign! I loved how simple this was to throw together.

I think our oven is overly hot because I baked it for 25 minutes and it got a bit overcooked. All in all a very easy recipe and husband approved!!!

My kids and husband loved this!  I tried turkey burger and turkey pepperoni to save on calories.  I chopped up fresh onion and mushrooms. I also did not add any olives.  This was a huge hit and I would make it again.

Really found this unlikeable.  I was hoping with all the ingriedients this would taste better, it still tasted like canned biscuits, which I do not care for.  Son ate it, daughter wouldn't touch it. Will not make this again.

IF you toss on the toppings, no additional baking time will make the diference - I am at 45 min now. The taste is good but biscuits are meant to be exposed to the heat, As pizza, this is very poor and there is not bubbly anything.

I made this for a football game party I went to and it was a big hit with everybody. I used ground pork sausage instead of beef. I cooked the onions with some chopped fresh mushrooms in olive oil and layered, Pillsbury Grand biscuits, meat mixture, shredded moz. cheese and topped with the mushrooms and onions. Cooked it until the biscuits were starting to brown and was bubbling. So easy to make, would make a great dinner meal also.

Maybe I'm being a little harsh on the ratings here. It was eatable but nothing special to it. My daughter is 6 and LOVES pizza just as any kid does and she didn't like this recipe. I think the biscuit dough was just a little bit too much breading for her since she's not a bread lover to begin with. I know. She's weird. :-)

This is really good. I didn't expect it to be as good as it was considering it was canned biscuits. I used 3/4 lb ground round, canadian bacon diced instead of pepperoni, and seasoned the beef as it cooked with a bit of garlic powder, dried minced onion, salt, a pinch of sage and Italian seasoning. I made easy pizza sauce II for this and so I only had 8 oz can's worth of sauce, which was fine for us and I think I will do it the same next time too. I used an Italian blend of cheese, parmesan, and colby-mont. jack blend. I had a lot of half used packages to use up. My husband remarked how good this was and ate 3 pieces and was going for 4 but stopped to save some for his lunch tomorrow. This would be easy to personalize adding or leaving off any toppings you like.

My family and I didn't care for this recipe.  Too much crust and it just felt so unhealthy eating even though I put a lot of vegetables on top.  I would not make this again.

Meat sauce was good but 14 oz. can of pizza sauce is not enough. Biscuits ruined the dish. cooked for only 20 minutes wo cheese and 10 minutes with cheese and the biscuits were burnt on the bottom. somewhat dry. very disappointed with this recipe. Not sure what to do with the leftovers...

Very good recipe. I added Italian seasonings to the meat while it was browning, and doubled the cheese, and skipped the onion, mushrooms & black olives. It was delicious & had the whole house smelling wonderful! I think I will add a salad with it next time, and also do the onions & maybe green peppers.

Love this recipe.  Have been making it for years.  I always cook the biscuits completely first, as doughy crust is a BUMMER.  I also lay a layer of cheese down before putting the sauce on, as cheese is hydrophobic and can prevent some of the sauce from soaking into biscuits.  I vary the ingredients each time.  Always turns out great.

This was ok for me.  My family liked it.  I'm not a huge fan of the refrigerated biscuits but I thought with the other ingredients the taste would be somewhat masked, it wasn't.  The recipe also needs more sauce and cheese.  I would recommend increasing both by at least 1 more cup of each.  If I used the amount of cheese and sauce listed in the recipe I would have given 1 star.

My BF and I really liked this, it was something different and it was quite tasty.  I added ground turkey and cooked the onion with the meat and I used regular spaghetti sauce.  I only used 1 can of buttermilk biscuits in a 8x8 dish and cut them in half then I kind of smooshed them together, then added mozz cheese on the biscuits then I added the meat/sauce mixture on top of that, then I added more mozz cheese on top.  Next time I will try different toppings.  Yummy!!

I used 1 pkg Grands biscuts cut into 8ths and italian sausage and pepperoni and one 14 oz jar of pizza sauce. The biscuit pieces absorbed a lot of the pizza sauce and were perfectly cooked. My husband and I found it VERY salty and a needed a little more sauce.  According to the other reviews i would say it came from the Italian Sausage.  I will try it next time with ground beef instead and some extra pizza sauce.

This recipe has easily slid into our bi- weekly menu plan.  I have one of the pickiest eaters on the planet in my family and even he will eat this.  My family chooses to half the ground beef quantity and add half-a-dozen (or so) slices of crumbled bacon and a few more personal favorite items on half. This is super easy and it is a sure-fire hit with even the pickiest of eaters...  trust me!

this is a great recipe...especially for kids!  my only suggestion would be to double the sauce.  i LOVE, LOVE thick chicago style pizza crust, but this was a little too much crust for me.  i think some extra sauce would make it perfect for our taste!

Delicious, my whole family loved it, including my picky husband.  I used Italian sausage and I put my onion in with the sausage while I was browning it.  I added oregano and Italian seasoning to the sauce.  Instead of mixing the pepperoni in with the sauce I layered it on top.  I will definitely make this again.

I tried this recipe and thought it was too doughy.  I didn't use the meat (vegetarian), but did add extra cheese.  I think even if I had used the meat it would still have tasted like too much dough.

This is so easy, and my husband really liked it. I just used cheese for one, and pepperoni for another. Not wonderful, but an easy and cheap pizza alternative!

I made this recipe for the first time tonight, and it was good, but the next time I make it, I am going to try using  only one can of biscuits. For my personal taste, I think it was to much biscuits. Other than that, it was a good recipe. I will make this again!!

For me this was just okay, but my daughter loved it. She is a pizza girl and when I make 'not so good' pizzas she lets me know- Equally when the pizza is great she says that as well and she just simply loved this. I did substitute the ground beef for italian sausage and added monterey cheese. I also sauted a big of green peppers and garlic and added as a pizza topping.

Very good. I made it with all our favorite pizza toppings. Then, the next day, I used all the leftover toppings (3 cheeses, sausage, mushrooms, onions, green peppers), added cream and eggs, and it made the best quiche!

loved it! we went bare-bones, just the biscuit dough, hamburger, sauce, and cheese, but i did use a jarred spaghetti sauce with mushrooms included. (only about half the 26oz jar, saved the other half for dipping/dressing!) i sprinkled garlic powder and oregano over the biscuit dough before spreading on the meat + sauce, baked as directed, and used a mexican mix (non-seasoned) of shredded cheeses. the whole family loved it! we've decided to call it 'pizza lasagna,' as that's what it really reminded us of.

I can't believe I'd never seen this recipe before!  The easiest wasy to make a "pizza" that will feed the family.  I could easily put different toppings on different sections of the pizza to please everyone.

This was great. It was fun to make and had a great taste. I went the max on the baking time and the crust over cooked a little. I'll cut the baking time when I make it again.

I have been making this for years and my family loves it! It is a nice change from traditional pizza.  If your family likes Mexican, try my Salsa Bread recipe that is posted. It is very similar to this awesome recipe.

Followed recipe exactly. Family gave it 4 stars because they thought that it needed more sauce. I agree and will make again, but with more sauce. Very good recipe and easy to make.

I was worried about the crust on this one, but it turned out great. My family really enjoyed this recipe. The only substitution I was made was ground turkey for the beef. We really enjoyed it and we will fix this again and again!

Loved this!  I'll definitely make it again.  My husband said that this is comparable to a deep dish pizza (heavy on the crust).  This can be customized just like any pizza.  We omitted the veggies and added bacon.  Not great for the waistline but it was delicious.  Also, this was sooo easy.  This recipe is a keeper.

This is fantastic! My mom used to make it for me as a kid. This recipe is slightly different than mine, but you can change it up. All you need to make sure you have are the biscuits, pizza sauce, and cheese; everything else is up to you. If you are in a bind and need something easy and fast without sacrificing on flavor this is the dish for you!

My family LOVES this pizza. I use Italian Sausage rather than the ground beef and make one end with only the sausage and pepperoni for the kids, and load the veggies on the other end for me and my hubby. Even better warmed up the next day!

I sprinkled the biscuits with Italian Seasoning and Parmesan Cheese before putting the mixture on.  This is the second time I've made it and it was way better with the seasoning and parmesan sprinkled on the biscuits.

As others did I used one package of biscuits and I think that was plenty of crust and used crumbled sausage instead of hamburg.  I will probably make this again since my hubby liked it so much.

I would call this more of a casserole than a pizza.  It was different, but good.  I would probably make it again.  Don't forget to grease that pan...I did and it was a tough clean up!

This is really good.  I made this for supper last night. My sister stopped over and I told her to try it, and she said it was soooo good.  Thanks for a great recipe.

Nice change from the usual. I used exquisite pizza sauce from this site which was a nice touch. Overbaked mine a little so watch it close or it's dry.

I'm sorry for giving this such a low rating.  This recipe sounded so good and with all the good reviews I was sure it would be delicious.  Unfortunately my family did not like this at all.  The topping was delicious, but the biscuit crust we all disliked.  It just didn't taste "italian".  Maybe some garlic bread would work better instead of biscuits.  Anyways, I won't be making this again.  Thanks anyways.

This was good.  Make sure to drain your beef or it will come out very greasy!  You could add onions, peppers, etc. It's a lot like eating deep dish pizza.

I just made this for dinner and didn't care for it.  I couldn't get past the "biscuit-y" taste.  I am glad I tried it as I've always been curious about this recipe, but I won't make it again. Sorry.

Wow, this is good! I usually make from-scratch pizzas on a pizza stone, but I was in a hurry and happened to have the ready-made biscuits. I used Ginny's biscuit method, but jazzed it up with pesto, pepperoni, mozzerela, feta, and olives.  Once out of the oven I topped it with lots of red-pepper flakes and romano chesse. YUMM!

This one is a big hit with the kids.  Although mom and dad like it too.  My kids ask me to make this every week.  I try to make it alittle bit healthier by using the low fat biscuts and instead of the hamburg and pepperoni I subsitute chopped steamed broccli and a can of mushrooms. They dont even notice the veggies under the sauce and cheese. Thanks.

I've made this many times now and it's my kids favorite meal.   SO easy to put together and alter ingredients to suit your taste.   I like how soft the 'bubbles' are and it's not overly saucy.

I made this once and it met with lukewarm reviews.    I thought about it, and tried again with crescent rolls instead of biscuits....I would say the family raved, but they were actually too busy gobbling it up to comment.

Try making this with the larger Grands biscuits. I think it makes a richer crust adults may prefer and kids love it either way. My seven year old picky eater loves this recipe.

I was thrilled with this recipe.  It made a warm, gooey pull-apart treat that was quick and easy but still yummy and satisfying.  Keep these ingredients on hand for those evenings when you'd love to order in a pizza but know you shouldn't.

This was really easy and tasted great!  I used ground sausage instead of ground beef and didn't bother cutting the biscuits in quartes.  My husband gets excited every time I make it!

I altered the recipe slightly....the kids won't eat onions, and I don't like ground beef, so I left that part out.  I poured the sauce over the biscuits and added my own toppings and cheese, and everyone loved it!  Even my picky hubby wanted more.  I had to make some for lunch the next day.  Thanks so much for a new twist on an old favorite.

Great tasting, easy to make, easy to customize the toppings.  Would make a great appetizer or snack.  Just forwarded it to my daughter and make copies for my co-workers.  One of the best receipes I have tried in a long time.

I think that it was too gooey, the dough wasn't done to my liking.  Next time - I think I will try to make it in a cast iron fry pan and change things around so it's more crispy crust.

Really, really good. My family enjoyed it a lot. We don't like a lot of sauce on our pizza so I tossed the biscuits in some pizza sauce then partially baked them before topping. I also used 4 cans of biscuits and baked in an 11x15 because I have 5 hungry mouths to feed.

I made this and omitted the veggies from it since it isn't my taste and added sausage. I also used two jars of pizza sauce since it was very dry with only one. It could have been the brand I bought, though. When you make this, be sure you don't use jumbo biscuits. The first time I made this, the biscuits weren't fully cooked. I used regular ones this time and it came out perfect!

Instead of using pepperoni, I used maple sausage and added pepper sauce in the chunky onion tomato sauce (that I opted for) to give it a kick.
My vegetables consisted of one Pablano pepper, a half of green pepper and mushrooms.
And my special ingredient that pulled the entire pizza together were pomegranate cranberries! It was the star of the show! The sweetness from the sausage and cranberries and the spice really brought the entire thing together. 

If it wasn't so salty I would have given this 5 stars. It's a tasty "grown up" pizza to serve to guests....hope this review helps :)

I totally intended to make this as written, but when I got to the store  a premade pizza dough ball with italian seasonings was $1.50 and so was One can of biscuits so I went the pizza dough route and it turned out GREAT!! I did one lb of ground turkey seasoned with onion and garlic powder,,with one green and one red bell pepper, a can of spaghetti sauce which I would NEVER use for pasta, but for this turned out perfect, and a lb of shredded sargento pizzeria cheese. Cooked it in a glass 9x13 pan.   Super tasty, husband approved! definitely going into the rotation!!

I changed this up a bit but overall it was ok.

If you don't want to use premade dough make your own.

Changes:
Used 3 10 oz cans of dough and did not cut it up
Used pesto instead of pizza sauce
No onions
ground turkey
added artichokes 
Used low fat and fat free cheese
turkey pepperoni

This "Bubble" Pizza Recipe was a "Bust"!!! I doubled the size for a party used meticulously prepared toppings with a generous hand and doubled amount of cheese using a blend of mozzarella cheddar and fresh parmesan. Unfortunately the only flavor you could taste was the commercial biscuit dough. Needless to say- expensive ingredients for a pizza that my hound dog wouldn't go near.

I made this last night it was alright. I would definitely ONLY make this pizza if you are a fan of a thick crust. I am a thin crust fan so the biscuit crust did not impress me. My other guests who like thick crust pizzas enjoyed this very much. Just a warning to all my thin crust pizza fans!

I folllowed the suggestion from others and baked the biscuits 10 mins before putting the rest of the ingredients.  This would have been really good but the biscuits turned out hard as a rock!  Next time I will prepare this recipe exactly was written so hopefully the biscuits will be more fluffy.

Quick, easy and surprisingly good!  The biscuits made a good crust.  We used muir glen pizza sauce which is slightly sweet yet spicy. I added garlic salt and italian seasoning on top of the sauce then topped with mozzarella, romano, parmesan and asiago cheese. My kids are cheese pizza kids. Possibilities are endless. It stuck to the bottom though so be generous with greasing the pan.

We like this recipe for a quick and tasty weeknight meal or when I have cans of biscuits that need to be used up. This recipe is also nice because you can change up the ingredients according to what you have in the fridge or what you like. The possibilities are endless...Thanks for sharing. :)

My kids really liked this.  The only complaint I have isn't even with the recipe...I overdid it with the biscuits so it was a little too doughy, but that was solely my fault.

Just okay.  My family didn't care for the sweet-ish taste of the biscuit crust.  For a quick homemade pizza, I will stick to a Boboli crust.  Sorry!

My hubby and I really enjoyed this dish. Nice change from traditional pizza. I did add salt, pepper, Italian seasoning and onion to my ground beef when browning. Just added a little taste to the meat.

I've made this many timeswith various toppings, and it always turns out great.  I usually leave half with peperoni or ground beef and cheese for the kids, while the other half is piled high with veggies for me and my husband.  It's far from a gourmet recipe, though I can't see how anyone would expect that based on the ingredients.  However, it gets five stars from a busy mom with three picky kids!  It also adapts nicely to Weight Watchers.

Made this for a fantasy football party and everyone loved it.  It was a little doughy for my husband but he is a thin crust pizza type, otherwise went over well.  Very easy to make with what ever ingredients you have available.  Thanks

The kids enjoyed this recipe but it wasn't a great hit.  I loved it.  Next time I will use regular biscuit dough instead of the buttermilk dough and I will chop  the onions into smaller pieces.  The onion pieces were too large.  The mushrooms didn't go over that well either but I liked them.  Ultimately though I cook for the kids so I have to give the rating based on what they like.  I will make this recipe again though with a few small changes.

Pizza tasted very good.  However, the dough was a little thick for me.  I only ended up using 2 packages of 8 oz. refrigerated dough vs. 2 packages of 12 oz dough.  If I made it again I would try to use 1-12 oz. can of dough.  It did taste very good- would make again!

This is really good and definitely a kid favorite.  My son enjoyed helping me make it.  We used fresh mushrooms, sliced red onion, and Boboli pizza sauce -- it was great!  We also added some pancetta to the meat mixture since I had some in the refrigerator.  You can't mess this recipe up!

It was good, the kid's loved it.  I love thick crust, but I have to agree the was a bit much even for me.  Needed more cheese and "toppings".  I added some olive oil to grease the dish and sprinkled garlic powder on it before adding the dough.  Probably will make again, but not often.

My husband & I love this recipe!! I started making it a bit more healthy by using turkey meat instead and real pepperoni. I also cook the biscuits that I cut into 1/4 for about 5 minutes before placing the topping on. Then I bake at 350 for 15 minutes and put the cheese on top and bake an additional 5 minutes. This helps helps the bottom for getting too brown and the middle cooks perfectly! Umm

My family loved this!  I used generic biscuits but accidently purchased the ones with butter.  A delicious mistake!  The boys loved it.  Looking forward to utlizing different ingredients plus it is easy to 'omit' ingredients like mushrooms that the youngest doesn't like.

This recipe is so easy. You can use the biscut crust and add what ever toppings you desire.  I did use half butter Grand Biscuit and half buttermilk.  The butter biscuit were a little too much.

Lacking flavor.  Need to add spices.  My husband accidently bought grand biscuits and felt this gave it a slightly odd flavor.

This was really good the first day but wouldn't have it as left overs if there is even any left!  I only used one can of biscuits.  I flattened them out and put them in the bottom of the pan.  I used pork sausage also.  We'll make it again!

I found this recipe a couple of wks ago and have had it once a wk. since. My kids love it!  The only things I do differently is, I use regular pepperoni instead of ground and I bake it in my pampered Chef cookie bar stone but instead of just two cans of biscuits I use four to fill the pan up.

Good if you eat it right away.  You do need to cook longer because the dough doesn't cook thoroughly.  Not good to heat up again and eat.  Dough is gooey. I used sausage instead.  Needs the flavor.  Not sure if I will make again.

This was amazing, my boyfriend loved it.  I used some green peppers and some sausage mixed with the beef.  Great for a kids dish.  I will make this often.

We all enjoyed this! I used 2 cans of Grands which are 16.9 oz ea, so I made 2 separate pizzas in smaller pans.  I used pork sausage and canadian bacon with 1/2 can of pizza sauce and about 1.5 cups cheese in one, and the other was chicken, bacon, red onion, and 1/2 jar parmesan garlic pasta sauce with 1.5 cups cheese.  YUM!  Would have also been good to add mushrooms and artichokes in the latter one.  Thanks!

I've been making bubble pizza for years and this recipe is almost identical to mine. The one different thing I do is cut the biscuits into quarters and place them into a bowl. I pour the pizza sauce over them to make sure every piece is sauce covered. I then add my ingredients. You can use anything you would normally put on your pizza. My kids prefer just cheese and pepperoni. My husband and I enjoy adding meat and veggies. Thanks for reminding me of a great recipe.

So easy and delicious, definately a keeper. I cooked finely chopped onions and garlic (to hide from kids) in the meat. No mushrooms for us, but added more olives. Thank You for sharing this recipe!!

I would give this 3 stars as just a pizza recipe.  However, because this was different, easy, and dare I say - fun - I give it 4.

Easy and tasty. I think it would be more simple to use a can of refrigerated pizza crust but if you don't have that the can biscuits tastes great, just a little more work.

My family loved this recipe.  I thought it was a little bit too much biscuit(and not enough sauce) for my taste.  However, husband and kids said for me to make it again.  So, it is a keeper!

This the first time I've done a review of a recipe. This Bubble Pizza was wonderful.It was quick and easy. I used the grand bisquits and I had enough for a 9X13 pan and a 8X8 square pan. For the small one I only used the meat and cheese. The kids don't like the onions and mushrooms so it was great for them. The adults couldn't get enough of it. They asked when I would make it again. I gave them the recipe so they can make whenever they want. Thanks for this one!

I call this "pizza you can eat with a spoon".  it was surprisingly  good. I didn't use ground beef. I used sausage  and mushrooms instead. I sauted the mushrooms a little  before putting them on the pizza. I also had to doctor up the pizza sauce but that is personal preference. Everyone liked it so much that there was none left. I will make  it again.  Next time I will add different toppings.

I just made this recipe for my 1st time. I actually halved the biscuits and they still rose nicely..I added my own favorite toppings and it was really good to my surprise quick and easy and luckily I already had the ingredients. Husband and nephew liked it will make again and try other ingredients.

Very good, a quick & fairly easy change of pace from regular pizza. The only change I made was to use sausage instead of hamburger, and I cut it down to 1/2 a pound (didn't want to use a lot in case it didn't turn out). 2 out of my 3 kids liked the biscuit crust, which is about the best I can hope for!

I am giving this recipe a 5 for the concept of using rolls as a crust. I add my own toppings after that.

This is one of my favorites!  My best friend made it for my goddaughters and passed it to me.  I now make it as often as I can for my husband and I, and I can't wait for our kids to love this as much as my godchildren do.
I make it only with mushrooms and put sliced pepperoni on top of the cheese at the end.  Delish!

I was shocked at how good this was. I made it for the kids so only used sauce, cheese and pepperoni. Definately quarter the biscuits. Unfortunately it is extremely salty but does NOT taste like biscuits.

Made this dish for a friend who after a couple bites said "This is really good! What is it called!"  I used hot italian sausage instead of ground beef!  This recipe is definately a keeper!

This was pretty good! It's very easy and can be prepared ahead of time. I used ground chicken instead of ground beef to reduce the fat content. I also reduced the amount of cheese and it was better than I expected. Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly. It's definitely more of a casserole than a pizza. I'll probably make it again.

FANTASTIC!! I made this for a teenage party of boys and they ate it up. Had to make only one change....used 3 tubs of biscuits instead of 2. Ended up making 3 pans of diffrent toppings and it was all gone. Thanks! Will make this again I'm sure.

This wasn't a big hit with us. My son, who loves pizza, just scraped off the topping and ate that.I made this recipe exactly as written and I found the topping delicious, but the crust just to biscuit-ish. I find myself tempted to scrape off the topping on the leftovers and make calzones or something.

I love the ease of this recipe and the kids loved the taste.  A good recipe when you have extra kids eating at the house.  I have made this a couple of times and we personally like it with spicy Italian Sausage and an onion.  We only add black olives to half the pizza and omit pepperoni on the other size (kids!!!)  But that's whats great about this recipe.  It's so versatile.  I think I'd love it with green peppers and a few jalepenos too.  We also use just mozzarella cheese and some parmesan.  We will definately make this again.

I was kind of excited for this recipe because I have heard of it before, but I, myself wasn't so impressed.  I gave this recipe 4 stars because the kids all gobbled it up faster than I have seen them eat before.  They also had seconds.  A rarity.  
It wasnt what I was really looking for, but hey, if they ate it up like that, I will add it to my book! Thanks for the quick kid fix!

I made this with a heavy, stoneware baking dish (all I have), and I think perhaps that is why it turned out a bit doughy.  It's definitely not a mind-blowing dish, but as a student I appreciate that in about 15 min. prep time you have a decent meal.

I really liked this, DH could take it or leave it and my granddaughter just picked the toppings off and ate them. I really wanted this to be a big hit at my house because it was so easy to make but unfortunatly it wasn't. I have picky eaters so I can't blame it on the recipe. It's a quick filling recipe that I would like to use often but will probably only use in a pinch.

This recipe is an A++.  I'm a working mother and this was so quick and easy.  It tastes wonderful and it is so filling.  One thing I changed: I didn't cut the biscuits, I just layed them down and it turned out perfect.  Thank you Ginny.  I will definately be making this again.

Really fun and easy!  I substituted some hot italian sausage for the ground beef, and added some Italian seasonings to the meat mixture.  Sauted the onion and some bell pepper to put on top.  Other than that, followed the recipe.  Wish I'd had this when my kids were little and all they wanted was pizza.  Thanks for a great recipe Ginny!

This was really good.  Just as good toasted the second day.  Will certainly make again.

My husband, two dogs, and cat, hung around drooling the whole time it took to put this together.  They paced the kitchen for the ten minutes it took to cool.  I tried sausage and a jar of spaghetti sauce, and I shoulda stuck with burger cause it was a bit salty, but it is going to be a keeper in household.

This was really liked by my six year old. My husband and I found it a bit too cheesy but other than that it was good.

This is really easy! I'll change the toppings next time to 1/2 and 1/2 so everyone gets what they like. How nice for something this quick and easy after work!

Changed the toppings to suit our fancies, and loved it.  My husband's favorite food is pizza and he likes this better than my pizza with crust.  Definite hit!

Mixed reviews on this one.  My husband really enjoyed it but surprisingly my kids did not like it.  They did not like the taste of the biscuits.

I used only pepperoni, with 70% reduced fat, and also used reduced fat mozzarella cheese. My family loved it, and it's really simple to make!

This was a great and flavorful recipe.  However, I thought there wasn't enough meat for the amount of biscuits.  Next time, I'll probably increase the ground beef to a pound and a half.

This was pretty quick and easy! My daughter loved, and my husband ate all of the left overs! (almost the entire pan!)  He won't quit asking when I'm going to make it again!
