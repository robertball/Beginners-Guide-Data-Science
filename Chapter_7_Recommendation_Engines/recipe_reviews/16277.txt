This IS chess pie as far as I'm concerned...EXACTLY as I enjoyed it as a child in TN. I had this recipe (handwritten from my mother)when I left home in the early 80's...lost it along the way somewhere.  Glad to have it again.  In the past month or so I've made about a half dozen chess pies - I simply cannot resist sharing with my less- (or not-at-all-)Southern friends and loved ones.  They've all turned out spot-on perfect.  Rave reviews all around (Southern, Not-so-Southern, Not-at-all Southern friends alike in their compliments!)  Thanks to Clair for sharing!

I doubled this recipe and made two pies.  Good thing!  This chess pie is EXCELLENT!!  Just like my grandmother used to make.  Don't over cook.  Once the center sets, it's done.  I've definitely added this one to my recipe box!  Thanks.

I baked this pie for the 35 minute time limit.   It definitely needs to be cooked for at least 1 hour.

35 minutes????? You are probably reading this review because you followed the directions perfectly and it came out a liquid mess with a hard crust on top, right?  That is because it absolutely needs to be baked at 350 for ONE HOUR! not 35 mins.  I have a brand new WhirlPool Accubake oven and it works great-so for all the reviewers who said it only takes 35 minutes, please tell me what kind of oven you have that baked this pie in 35 minutes so I can run out and buy one! Mine is an electric oven, so do you all have gas ovens? Would that make that much of a difference anyway?
That is why I gave this recipe 3 stars...After I baked it, it came out good, but it was very frustrating to have to figure the time out for myself!

I give this 5 stars because its great. I was so tired of asking people to make me a chess pie or buying them at the store. I saw this today and made it today as well. Guess what it turned out perfectly! The only thing is instead of 35mins cook it for 55mins. Perrrrfect!

So easy, and the first time a chess pie that I made actually 'set' and was edible.  I did leave in the oven for about 55 minutes.  Will make this again.

I have searched all over for this recipe.  My neighbor across the street used to make this pie when I was a little girl and I loved it.  It was the first thing I learned to cook.  I lost the recipe and she has long since moved away.  My husband and daughter just love it. Thanks.

I think it was a great recipe; quick, easy, and tasted great.  Even my picky son now claims this to be his favorite pie.  While some ovens may bake this in 35 minutes, mine took 55 minutes to set up perfectly.  Everyone should read the directions and stop complaining about the length of time it takes.....your directions plainly state "35 minutes or until set."  Thanks for sharing a great recipe.

i made this recipe for one of my Thanksgiving pies. I read a whole string of the reviews on the recipe, and every one with the exception of one, said that no way did it cook in 35 min, that it took at least and hour. So trusting that, I didn't check it at 35 min,.. it burned. So I made another watching it carfully, it came out beautiful and delicious in 35 min on the DOT. So I think the difficulty is that those people maybe didn't pre heat their oven. Mmine had been on 350 for many hours cooking the turkey. When it came out, I cooked the pie. So be advised, mine came out perfectly at 35 min. Make sure you throughly pre-heat your oven and watch it carfully. You will be rewarded with a terrific pie!

i didnt enjoy this pie too much. first off, it didn't seem to me like it was enough filling for the pie shell, it was less than a half inch thick. and i could really taste/feel the cornmeal in every bite. im really not even sure what the cornmeal does to the pie. the acutall taste of the pie was good. it was nothing special. i wont be making this one again

I have never tried this before so i dont have much to compare it to. I like the oven preheat for about 30 minutes before i put the the pie in.  At 35 minutes the pie was very runny. I baked it for almost an hour and once it cooled and chilled it cut well but the crust broke up quite a bit.  Its very sweet and unless someone requests this pie I dont think i will make I think i would defintely bake it for 1 hour or a little more but i would follow the suggestion of another reviewers and cover the pie with foil so that the crust does not brown or burn.

I'm SHOCKED at the amount of people who say this was done in 35 minutes! Next time I'm definitely going to bake it an hour. Ours was like pudding with a hard top. Even after being refrigerated all nite the consistency was straight pudding. Bummer because the flavor was good. I would seriously recommend baking for ONE HOUR.

This tastes like a cross between a pudding pie and a custard.  I added a cinnamon meringue to the top, and this pie came out great.  I have to admit, I had my reservations at first. Unless we try new things, we are stuck every holiday with the same boring choices. So surprise someone with something new and tasty.

We loved this!  Yes, it's sweet, but chess pie is supposed to be, right?  35 min was perfect.  This was quick, easy, and had a great flavor.  Thanks for the recipe : )

this pie is awesome, my dad loves pie, my husband hates pie, and custard. but  they both went raving mad over this one. i did it with homemade crust. i had to cook it a little longer than the recipe said, and covered it with foil so the top didn't get too dark, but otherwise i followed the recipe. it was perfect. i don't even like chess pie, but i love this one. making it again today as a matter of fact.

We were living in North Carolina in the late 90's a school friend of our son's came over around Thanksgiving with this pie. We all had a piece it is quite sweet but we all really liked it. A few days later she came back with the recipe. Two years later we moved back to the west coast, that Christmas Eve I made this pie I didn't tell anybody after Dinner when everyone was mingling around I was watching my Nana (Grandmother) while she cut a piece of this pie she topped it with a little whipped cream took a bite and closed her eyes and smiled, then she sat the plate down and said who made the "Old Fashioned" Cream Pie? I didn't know she was talking about my pie some were saying "not me" so I walked over and said "Old Fashioned" Cream Pie she said yes this one (holding up her plate) Oh I made that, she said well you just took me back to my childhood Thank You. She said all the adults called it "Old Fashioned" cream pie and I just love it. I make this every Thanksgiving and Christmas and the whole Family loves it. I will say I think it needs almost an hour to cook from my experience.

I tasted this exact pie nearly 50 years ago when my mom got it from her sister. 
We lost the recipe many years ago. We tried various recipes, but none were the one we remembered.
Today, my memories came back.
Thank you for the best chess pie ever. Wonderful old fashioned southern baking at it's finest.

This is the perfect pie. I have been making pies for over 60 years and had lost my Chess Pie Recipe. This is it. Mine was given to me by a neighbor who had had it handed down to her through family. Follow the recipe exact. I use an immersion blender to mix

as i read on a couple of reviews, the pie should be baked for at least an hour unless it sets before then. I had to check it several times to keep it from burning. otherwise very easy recipe.

I;ve never had chess pie, but I was craving a pie and I had all the required ingredients on hand already. The only thing that I didn't have was the white vinegar and I used rice wine vinager instead. Well, it was super sweet! Sweeter than I thought it was going to be. Also, my pie took about an hour to be prefectly set too. It got crunchy on top and it was very good.

Very good recipe.  I've never tried chess pie before, and saw a recipe at my mother-in-law's house.  I looked up recipes on line when I got home, and this one had similar ingredients.  I'm glad I didn't read the reviews before hand.  I let it cook exactly 35 minutes and let it cool about 20 minutes and it is definitely set!  It was so easy too!

The pie was great... My 2yr. old kept asking for more... and he is a very picky eater. My mom could not stop eating, she said it was the best chess pie she had eaten. I made no change to the receipt, it is wonderful as is and I am very picky about desserts. Thank you!

Great pie, and super easy to make!!  I was looking for a recipe for "somethin' sweet" with ingredients I had on hand, and stumbled over this.  I did have to cook mine about an hour to get it to set, but will definitely make this again!!!

This is the same recipe that my grandmother used to make when I was a little girl back in the 50's.  After her death, we found this same recipe in her old wooden box of recipes.  She died in 1992... When I make these pies I always remember with a smile how they tasted when I was a little girl....  
I made 2 of these for Thanksgiving and out of the 6 pies at Dinner these 2 were the only ones that was eaten.... The family loves them too.....

This is a great recipe, the ingridients, measurements, everything else is correct except the time. It needs to be cooked for about 45-50 minutes, otherwise, it will be a gooey mess. 3 stars, due to the fact that if you cook it for 35 minutes, it's not how it's supposed to be.

I just added some cocoa and some pumpkin, because I was trying to make it more for Thanksgiving.  It was very good and would probably be awesome without these added ingredients too.  I'll try it that way, next time. I love these simple desserts.

This was the first time I have ever made chess pie, but I had a friend request for me to make one,so I made two instead..lol.. I made the first one regular and the second I made Chocolate . I followed this recipe to a t except for I melted a little chocolate unsweetened squares and added it to the chocolate one. I cooked it for the exact 35 minutes and it turned out amazing. I will definitely be making this again. Thanks for sharing this recipe.

It needs milk of some kind (evaporated, whole, or buttermilk) in it to make the custard. This is not the best recipe for chess pie. I also agree that the cooking time takes more like an hour. It was edible, but I would not use this recipe again.

this pie was not good at all.  1 tablespoon is too much vinegar unless you want the pie to taste tart.  Also to say cook for 35 minutes or until golden brown is an understatement.  The top will be golden brown, but the pie still is not ready.  It was so embarrassing to find out the pie was runny when the people I baked it for cut into it.

I will be honest, I have not made this recipe, yet.  But it is exactly like the one I have misplaced.  It has been in our family for generations.  The vinegar is important because it adds just a bit of bite to offset the sugar.  Make sure you cut small pieces.  Large ones are too sweet to eat.  Enjoy! Go with the longer baking time, but keep an eye on it.

I liked this pie, but I have had better. The custard pie that is better came from this site too.  It's called Grandma's Coconut Pie.  I love coconut custard pies, but my husband doesn't not, so I make one with coconut and one wthout and it is so GOOD!!!

I'm not a big chess pie fan but I made this for a friends birthday and she loved it. It was simple to make and goes well with French pastry pie crust (found on this site). Very sweet, if that's what you like this is excellent. I've never had a better piece of chess pie.

I baked this at least 40 minutes but it did not set up.  I *thought* it had when I pulled it out (because the top was firm to the touch) but it was just a hard, glass-like crust that formed atop the liquid inside.  I tried eating the bottom pie crust, but it just tasted like super-sweet vinegar.  This was a total disaster.
