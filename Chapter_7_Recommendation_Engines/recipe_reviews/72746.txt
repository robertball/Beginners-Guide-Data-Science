Everyone scarfed these up first at a recent reception I hosted.  I figured out a way to make them smaller.  Do not separate the triangles when you remove the dough from the can.  Smush the perforations together so that you have 4 rectangles.  Using a pizza cutter, slice the rectangles in the middle (the short way); then slice those rectangles from one corner to the opposite.  Now you should have 4 smaller triangles.  It makes way too much filling.  I doubled the recipe and ended up with twice the amount of filling needed.  I would definately make these again.

I hate to give such a negative review, but I rely so much on these reviews as I decide on the recipes I'm going to make, I want to be honest with mine. So here goes...
The bottom line is this recipe lacks flavor.  I made three batches of the crab mixture, and it never did taste very good. I followed the recipe for my first batch and it was extremely bland.  I added Worcesterhire sauce, garlic powder, minced onion, green peppers, extra cheese, and crab meat to my second batch and still, it lacked flavor.  In my third batch, I added a ton of hot sauce and that didn't help.  Maybe there is just too much bread and too little crab mixture.  I don't know, but this recipe just didn't work for me.  Sorry.

This recipe has a lot of potential but just needs a couple improvements.  I should note that these were devoured (I served them hot as an hor d'oeuvre) and I got tons of compliments.

I made them exactly as directed, with the exception of following someone else's idea of cutting the crescent rolls into smaller squares.  They still turned out fairly large for "finger foods" so next time I'm going to cut the dough in circles, fold it half and pinch the dough pierogie/ravioli style.

After hearing the filling was a tad bland from my official taste-tester, using the left-over filling I added a ton of Frank's Hot Sauce, fresh grated parmesean cheese, garlic powder, and s&p.  Nuked it and served it with crackers.  Now this was A HIT!!  

I will definitely make this again, but make the above changes to the filling.

This was good. It did lack flavor and I did add garlic and S&P to it. As for the extra filling, I bought 2 cans of croissants and that solved the problem of having extra.

Good recipe. I used imitation krab :) (shredded really well) and these were fine. Use regular crescent rolls and regular cream cheese, NOT LITE(they did NOT taste good this way!). I added some onion powder and a dash of hot pepper sauce for some flavor. Also, chive/different flavors of cream cheese works really well, too. Thanks for the recipe.

This recipe was really easy to make, but I thought it lacked flavor. Maybe adding onioons or mushrooms would give it more taste.

I have made this five or six times now and it is always a hit.  I usually end up having to double eat to satisfy everyone!

I like the idea of this recipe but the filling needs a little something more. I added pepper and some green onions but will use a little paprika or a stronger cheese next time.

I was skeptical when I first mixed it up, so I added some chopped jalapeno and green onion. Improved it a little. I also made some with shrimp, jalapeno & green onions, no shredded cheese just cream cheese and those tasted better. After I baked them (crab) they were much better but we still had to dip in cocktail sauce. I'll play around a bit because we love crab. Try the shrimp!

This might be good also using frozen puff pastry dough instead of the packaged crescent rolls. A little more sophisticated yet just as easy and tasty.

Very easy and pretty good.  I agree these would probably be better in a puff pastry.  Adding some avacado would probably give it a little more flavor as well.

Wonderful! I made these for a Mother's Day brunch and they were a hit. I used the crab meat now available in pouches similar to tuna by Chicken of the Sea and was pleasently suprised (in quality and $$). Will make these again.

I used a whole can of crab meat and did them as pinwheels instead.  But they were really good and probably would have been great the original way just less "crabby".

They tasted awful. I used imitation crab maybe it would have better with real crab.

I made this recipe for my annual New Year's party. They were gone almost as soon as I took them out of the oven and I even doubled the recipe.  I do agree that it would be nice to have a way to make them smaller, but they are great either way.

These were very good and sooooo easy to make. I used imitation crab and put two slices of jalepeno pepper on them. This recipe will be made at every get together we have.

Very good but not a "wow".  Fool-proof and tasty - could use more flavor but I would definitely make for company because I don't think you can mess this one up and they taste good.  For a cocktail party, I would try to figure out how to cut up the dough to make a bite-size appetizer - these are large for hors d’oeuvres (the size of a crescent roll).  As suggested, the leftover mixture made a great spread for crackers (actually cracker - I stuffed my rolls pretty full).
