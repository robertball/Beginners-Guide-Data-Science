This was absolutely delicious! I don't think I would've known it was venison if I hadn't cooked it myself!  For all of you hunter's wifes who aren't wild about venison...this one's for you!!!

Super good!!  I used canned spaghetti sauce instead of tomato sauce!  I also left out the green pepper, but put in a can of diced tomatoes!  Simply seasoned it how we like it, baked and served!!  We really enjoyed this dish, and next time I may add fresh mushrooms and use regular spaghetti noodles rather than thin!

Great tasting!  I cooked the meet and sauces in a stew pot then served it over brown rice.  It was a good twist on pasta or rice with meat and sauce.  The spices complimented well.

Not bad.  Next time I will add more spices.  Maybe some minced garlic and a bay leaf.

I made this for my bf and family and they all loved it! I couldn't even tell that it was venison. Although I used ground venison instead of cubed, I added a can of diced tomatoes and switched in jar of spaghetti sauce instead of using tomato sauce. I also added extra garlic, mushrooms, and used lots of cheese on top. Also, if you like more sauce you may want to make extra on the side because when you bake it there is not a lot of sauce left over. It was delicious!

We loved this! Due to what we had on hand, I used ground venison instead of cubed venison (and cheddar cheese instead of mozzarella.) Everyone devoured this. Our guests couldn't tell it wasn't your average beef-type spaghetti!

Made this last night and it was delicious! I pretty much followed all directions except I used a mix of spices I had on hand, used a jar of spaghetti sauce (reviews said it was a tad dry using just 2 cans of tomato sauce),  added diced tomatoes, used ground venison, and used extra cheese since my family loves cheese. 
The next day the leftovers tastes even better.
Will be making this again!!
