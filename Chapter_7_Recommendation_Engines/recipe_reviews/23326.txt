For 25 years I have been using the recipe off the Libby's label with the addition of 2t of pumpkin pie spice since my family enjoys a spicier pie filling. I wanted to try something different this year, so I tried this one. I made both recipes, fortunately, because most of my guests preferred the Libbys. The only redeeming feature of this recipe was the ginger whipped topping.I couldn't get beyond the texture of this pie.Next to the Libbys recipe, it seemed like it never set up properly. It wasn't real firm. Maybe it was just us, but this recipe seemed toooo creamy. (and sometimes that isn't a problem) But I probably won't make this one again. Too sweet and too creamy. Wow, to most cooks, that's never a problem. Now I know its just me ;)

Great recipe in general but I made a few changes to the filling.  I only used 3/4 cup of brown sugar and instead of heavy whipping cream I used a 14oz can of sweetened condensed milk.  Also instead of pumpkin pie spice I made my own spice mix with a combo of cinnamon, nutmeg and ginger.  Just a few shakes of each and you're good to go.  The crust is fabulous and so is the topping (add more sugar though). Two thumbs up and rave reviews!

This pie was awesome!!!!!!!!!

It was very rich and delicious!!  I wished I had made more!

I used E.D. Smith Pumpkin in a can and followed this recipe. And also used pre-made frozen crusts to save time.

I made this pumpkin pie at Thanksgiving and it was really good! I thought it had a great balance of spiciness and sweetness- not at all too much in either direction. I had the same problem as one of the other reviewers- in that it was not finished cooking in the amount of time listed in the recipe. It took about 20 extra minutes for the knife test to work. However, when it was done it was very good. I think the whipped cream needs a little bit more ginger.

This pumpkin pie was pretty good.  My sister and I are not big pumpkin pie eaters but we both liked this one.  It has a sweeter taste than most pumpkin pies.

I used this filling for my Thanksgiving pies.  (I still don't make the crusts because I feel they are a bother; and also why compete with the "doughboy"?!)  Everyone loved it and I will definitely make it again!  Jan H.

I had some problems with this receipe.But to be completly fair, this was my first attempt with a pumpkin pie. The crust was hard to roll out which I think could have been avoided if there was a notation to chill first.  Also it seemed to take forever to bake well over 50 min.( my oven is new and the temperature is correct.) Wainting for Thankgiving to try....

Very easy to do. I used premade Pillsbury pie crust. Brown sugar makes it into a darker pie. The ginger whipped cream was okay, but my family liked the pie better as is.

Good tasting pie.  It took much longer than the recipe states to cook in oven, it was never (knife clean). But once cooled it does hold together.  The ginger whip cream is great. FYI-I did not make the crust (I cheated)!!

Best tasting pumpkin pie I've ever had. And it's so simple a child could make it. I did refrigerate the dough for about an hour before rolling it out. No sticky mess at all. It was perfect. I've now made 3 and will be making more this holiday season. Thanks!!

It just took too long to bake and my crust was soft in the middle.  If I were to make it again I would plan on having it in the oven for 80-90 minutes.

This recipe is terrific.  The only thing that I would reccomend is that you make a quarter cup more crust because I think that you will need it...

This was amazing!  Everyone that tried it said that it is the best pumpkin pie they have ever had!  I did alter the whip cream by adding a tablesoon more sugar than what it calls for- everyone especially loved the whip cream, so I guess that was a good decision.  This is a new tradition for our family.

Even with a store-bought crust (I used Wholly Wholesome's tradional pie shell) this was delicious!  It was on the sweeter side, so if you don't like your pie overly sweet you may want to put a little less sugar in.  Next time I'm going to try this with the ginger whipped cream-- but even without it was fabulous!  I don't have pumpkin pie spice, so I substituted 1 tsp cinnamon, 1/2 tsp ginger and 1/2 tsp cloves.

Slightly mixed reviews on this recipe.  Everyone said it was very good, but you never know when they're just being polite (except for my husband who never seems to believe in absolute truth).  Got one "best pumpkin pie I've ever had".  I thought it was a little too sweet with little other flavor.  Ginger whipped cream was ok, but not as special as I thought it would be.  I didn't make the crust in the recipe as I made up my usual crust and put it in the refrigerator to chill before I went to look up a recipe for the filling.  Just looking at it, though, I think I would make a little more than the recipe calls for as it seems fairly skimpy.
