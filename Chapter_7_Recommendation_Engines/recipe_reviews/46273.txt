I liked this- but we reduced the pasta a little and had to add some sour cream (ran out of creme fraiche).  I liked using the creme fraiche with this- I've never used it before.  The broccoli and ham added so much to the dish.  I agree with the other reviewer that it could use some garlic though.

This recipe has potential.  I added a clove of minced garlic to the sauteed onions to give the dish a little pizzaz.  1/2 cup of creme fraiche isn't enough for all that pasta; I used 1 full cup AND 1/4 cup sour cream.  A little shredded cheddar cheese might also be a good addition.  Overall, this recipe has a nice presentation and texture, but the flavor is quite unremarkable.

I had been looking for a way to use my extra creme fraiche, but unfortunately I didn't think it gave enough flavor to the meal.

I really liked this!  I recently moved to Sweden where creme fraiche is in abundance and I have enjoyed finding recipes that use it.  I used about 1 1/4 cup creme fraiche based on the prior reviews and I loved the subtlety of the creme fraiche with the ham and broccoli.  I also added about 1.5 cups of fresh sliced mushrooms to the sauteed onions for another flavor element but I think it would be good without.
