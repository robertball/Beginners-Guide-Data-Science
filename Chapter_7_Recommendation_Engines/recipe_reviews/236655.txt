@Doriezitro Those white chunks are mozzarella cheese diced. This was really good what I did was cook noodles according to package directions. I had some barilla sauce so I sauteed my own thinly sliced onions with a bulb of garlic. I'm half Italian what can I say! After the sauce simmered down a while I rolled fresh basil and sliced it up. Mixed the sauce with the noodles then tossed with mozzarella. Took the slices of basil and scattered over the pasta. Voila! It was quick and delicious served with garlic bread kiddos ate it up.
