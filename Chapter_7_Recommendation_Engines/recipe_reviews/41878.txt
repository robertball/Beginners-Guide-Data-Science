The flavor was really good (better leftover) but the cooking time is off.  I think this should be cooked for 3-4 hours because the lentils were really not done after 20minutes.  Plus then the flavors could really mix in

I spent a semester studying in Seville, Spain, and the woman I lived with made sopa de lentejas almost every week.  I wanted to try my hand at a lentil soup, and this recipe brought back tops of memories from my days in Spain!  A previous reviewer was correct in saying the soup needed a few more hours, so that the lentils would get tender and the flavors would mixed.  I transfered the soup to a crock pot, let it stew for a few hours, and it turned out great!

Even better the next day.

Really good recipe and defintely better the next day.  The only change I made was to add an additional can of tomato sauce & some Italian seasoning, just to give it a bit more flavor.  My son is a picky eater and he loved it.  My husband wasnt fond of the lentils (there are quite a lot) so when I make it again, I would probably do half as many lentils & maybe add some carrots.  Thanks for the delicious recipe :)

This stew turned out wonderfully!  I used Turkey Kielbasa to make it a little lighter and the sausage flavour was infused throughout.  Will definitely make again!

My fiancee is from Spain and though this recipe is quite different then his mom's it still deserves 5 stars. So delicious! I prepare it almost exactly as stated in the recipe except I double the onions out of personal preference. As other reviewers have noted, the recipe requires about an hour of simmering in order to get the lentils soft throughout. It's become a regular in our household and though it requires a bit of time to cook, it requires very little prep time or babysitting.

This recipe makes a large pot of thick stew. If you don't like lentils don't try it. Keeps well. The sausage really adds a ton of flavor. I did omit the onion (picky eaters). I'll be making this soup again sometime this winter:) Thanks for posting.

Great basic recipe, I just spiked it up a bit with extra garlic,1/2 red pepper, and 1/2 teaspoon of Dijon mustard. Great dish.

Loved this soup! So simple and quick. I didn't have any sausage in the house, but it was very good. We had Parmesan cheese on top.

This was a great stew however I used turkey sausage instead of polish sausage.
We also added mushrooms, a small green pepper and an organic seasoning.  
it is fantastic.  
great recipe!

Usually, I won't rate a recipe if I've changed it at all, but I made a few tweaks to this one, which was probably wonderful as listed.  First, since some people thought the lentils were hard, I started them simmering in chicken bullion while I prepped the rest.  I also chopped and added a small bunch of kale I had to use up and a sprinkle of cayenne pepper.  We were thrilled and couldn't stop eating this.  Fantastic!!!

Maybe if you soak the lentils in water for a while before adding to the pot, they will cook up quicker.  I can't wait to try this recipe

This was the first time I had ever had or made lentil stew. My husband was wanting more beans and lentils in his diet to help his BP. It was pretty good. I think maybe lentils are something for my family to get used to. This was an easy recipe, and one I will probably make again!

This was great !   I left out the potatoes because there was enough carbs, and instead of polish sausage, I used italian sausage (oven cooked).  Fantastic !

I  halved recipe.  It would be better with 1/2 the amount of lentils.  Tomato soup or sauce, and italian seasoning.

I'm confused about the previous review because anyone who has made lentils knows that it takes less than 30 minutes to reach tenderness.  They must have used some legume.  My go at this recipe was easy and I achieved the delicious results promised within the given cooking time.

I've cooked lentils (plain) in the past and my Redneck hubby was less than thrilled so I was taking a chance trying this recipe.  HE gave it 5 stars!  No need to say more.

This is amazing. I was looking forward to the even better taste of day 2, but there may not be leftovers. I tooknad ice of other reviewers and starts by simmering the lentils while cutting up the vegetables.  But then had to run errands, so finished in the slow cooker for two hours on high. My variations: used turkey kielbasa, fresh cut tomatoes and added fresh parsley and cilantro since I had them on hand. Also added carrots.  A nice taste from the get go.

Very good!  My husband lived in Spain for four years and had bugged me for ages to get a pressure cooker and make lentils.  I finally got the pressure cooker and used it for this recipe.  My husband said that it didn't taste like what he had in Spain, though it was "kind of similar", but he still loved it.  He keeps asking me when we are having this again.  I threw everything in together and pressure cooked for 30 minutes.  I will probably do a little less time next time -- maybe 20 minutes -- as it did turn out a little mushy.

Really good, but after reading others’ comments, I decided to just go ahead and throw the lentils in at the beginning of the cook time. Super! But I left out the meat until the last 20 minutes ....and I added some carrots. And when I tried it when I was adding the salt and pepper... it seemed rather bland. So. After a lot of salt, I decided to add about a teaspoon of curry powder and probably 3/4 tsp of cumin. Just to add, you know. A little ‘something’. Served with rice, but I think that’s a poor choice. The rice takes away from the dish, unless you want to add more salt! Anyway, this is a pretty good dish and I would make it again... maybe add a dollop of plain yogurt or sour cream on top as a finish? Add some hot sauce? (Sorry, I’m eating the dish as I write!) yummy.

This is in my regular rotation of soups.  Sometimes I add celery  or other root vegetables.   Everyone I have served this for loves it.

It was a good recipe but I felt like it needed a little bit more flavor.  I added cumin and a little turmeric.

I used veggie Kielbasa (since we are a family of vegetarians) and added some oregano, and it was tasty!  It was also very easy.  I didn't have to cook it for hours, probably because I didn't add the salt until close to the end of cooking time (salt can toughen beans and lentils).  I also want to try it without the veggie sausage for a good, comfort-food kind of stew.

i made a black eyed peas version of this stew. i used fresh plum and cherry tomatoes instead of canned.  i also added some cumin, chili powder, and paprika. and i did cook it for about 4 hours. it was perfect. DELICIOUS!

1/31/12 So I just re-visited this and this time I added celery, some coriander, cayenne pepper, a can of cream of chicken and a can of chicken broth, chopped carrots... I left out the sausage this time, but I bet apple chicken sausage would have been nice...  As the soup was finishing up, I mashed around the lentils a little with a ladle and ended up getting a bit thicker consistency, which I loved.  I still really liked it and actually, it was even more delicious the next day!

Great recipe.  I went by the recommendations of the other reviewers and cooked the lentils for an hour.  Also, since I cook for my kids who can be a little picky at times, I substituted the diced tomatoes with 2 cans of tomato soup.  Very easy to make with ingredients I keep around the house.

Delicious! Like other reviewers, I think it needs a lot more time. I added some chopped carrots. I also cooked the onions and carrots in a little olive oil before adding the other ingredients. It's almost like Grandma used to make! :o)

I thought this was a good, hearty meal.  Our guests said it reminded them of a stay in Chile, where lentils were often used.  I followed the recipe, but instead of covering with only water, I added a can of reduced sodium beef broth and 1/2 cup of dry red wine, then enough water to cover.  This made the soup very flavorful.  I also added quite a bit of salt and pepper, which I think improved the flavor.  In addition, I added about 1/2 cup of carrots, since I had them in the house.  I use turkey keilbasa for a healthier meal, the flavor was good, but the texture was a little rubbery.  Next time I will use Polish sausage.  Yes, the cooking time should be increased, but doesn't need to be several hours.  I thought the soup was perfect with about 50 minutes of simmering.

This was really tasty, I made some of the changes suggested by the other reviewers, I added the lentils at the beginning so they cooked a little longer and used some turkey sausage instead. I also used tyme, entirely by accident because I wasn't paying attention but turned out great! And there is tons, I think I'll be eating this all week.

Fast and tasty. The only changes I made were to add an eight ounce can of plain tomato sauce and substituting chicken broth for the water.
