These were good and easy too make!  I added 1/4 tsp of cinnamon, which was really great! I made these for my grandpa's birthday and he liked them.  But he doesn't usually get too excited over anything, so I'm not sure how much he liked them.. My brother on the other hand couldn't stop stealing them!  He kept coming into the kitchen trying to steal my grandpa's cookies!

This was exactly what I was hoping for. I made the following additions.

I added a pinch of salt, 1/4 tsp real almond extract, 1 tsp cinnamon and sprinkled the tops with white sugar. 

They are just sweet enough and perfect when you want something quick and satisfying.

Note: if you don't have dark brown sugar you can use light brown with 1 T molasses (ratio: 1 cup to 1 T molasses), Make sure you press down nice and firm with the fork if you want those deep indentations.

DH and son loved them. Half are gone before I've finished writing this and they just came out of the oven.

OMG.  Seriously, this is one of the best,yet simplest, cookies I have EVER had.  My husband was stuffing his mouth with them and simultaneously asking me to make more.  And he is not a big cookie person!  I chose this recipe because I had everything on hand and it was quick.  Only difference I made was that I added a 1/4 teaspoon of cinnamon. SO yummy!  Thanks for this keeper!

very nice recipe. I made a triple batch. First batch I made as called for, very very good. second I added ginger and allspice, has a nice bite to it and thirdly I chopped cherries up very small and added to the dough with a little cherry juice from the jar. Awesome.
 You add anything to these and they will turn out very good. 
This recipe is a keeper and one that I will use many times over

What attracted me to these is there's wasn't any special ingredients I had to run out and get. However, I didn't have dark brown sugar so I used light instead. I also added some cinammon, like a previous reviewer suggested. Came out wonderful!  Even after cooled they have a nice crunch to the outside and are nice and chewy on the inside. I will make again for hoidays or just for fun!

Very good! I doubled the recipe and ended up with five dozen cookies, half of which I used to make yo-yo cookies with strawberry jam.

These turned out very good. I ended up with 23 cookies and they were done in 15 minutes. Nice crispy crunch to them yet chewy in the center. A very simple recipe to mix together when you don't have a lot of time and nothing special you'd need to have on hand.

Great cookies and very easy to make. I made mine bigger than the recipe suggested, only getting 12 nice size cookies and the texture was perfect.

When I saw the photo of these cookies it brought to mind some coconut cookies I bought long ago that I think were made by Mother's brand.  So I decided to use these as a base and see what I could create.  I used only 1/2 tsp of vanilla and added 1 tsp of coconut extract.  I added 1/2 cup of shredded unsweetened coconut after stirring in the flour.  I skipped sprinkling the sugar and baked for 15 minutes at 325.  They came out great and my house smells yummy.  My husband had just walked in as I was taking the first batch out and he gave them five stars.  These will become a staple in the cookie rotation.  Many thanks, John, for a real keeper!

I thought these were VERY good!  They were chewy and delicious.  Very nice because of being tight on money and not having much of anything fancy on hand.  Thanks for the recipe!

Oh, we all thought these were great!  Insanely simple, crunchy on the outside - soft & chewy on the inside.  As so many others mentioned, I added 1/4 t cinnamon and 1T of molasses as I only had lt brown sugar.  Took all of 6" to throw together, no need to chill dough, and they baked up perfectly in 15".  Simple, clean, fresh flavors - I didn't find them bland in the slightest.

Excellent cookies. I have tried this twice using some of the suggestions others have commented on. First batch, since I had light brown sugar instead of dark brown, I added a little molasses (about 1 TBSP) and 1/4 tsp cinnamon. Next batch I added the cinnamon, added 1/4 tsp almond extract with the vanilla, but forgot the molasses. With both batches, I added honey roasted chopped pecans. I'd have to say the way I did it originally was better. The almond extract covered up the subtleness of the cinnamon. For the next batch I try (definitely soon!), I might add some mini semi-sweet chocolate chips along with the pecans.

Tasty little cookies.  I took the advice and added the 1/4 t cinnamon, only problem was I doubled the recipe and forgot to double the cinnamon.  Very faint, but still good.  Reminds me a bit of a Biscotti.  I would like to make these without the baking soda and play around with the spice to get it more like a biscotti.  Thanks for the unique recipe.

These were great! I didn't change a thing. I may add a tad bit of salt next time, since I used unsalted butter, but they don't really need it. A nice, simple, tasty, crispy, chewy cookie.

Recently, I was looking for a new cookie recipe, and came across this one.  I was excited in part, because of the reviews, and in part, because I had all the ingredients.  I baked two batches, 1 adding pumpkin pie spice, and the other, adding cinnamon.  While they didn't taste awful, they didn't taste really great.  After spending that much time baking, you want them to be really good.  I mostly bake for my husband and son, so they will have cookies in their lunches when they go to work.  They both said the same thing - "O.K., but nothing really special."

This brouht back memries of the neighborhood ladies in the late 50's.They gatherd often in our rare front yard .Our house a little cottage was in the rear property .Because our yard was huge the woman gatherd to discuss many things.Recipes were a priorty .Any recipe with a kitsch fraze name was a hit.Sometimes up to 16 kids played while the moms worked out life.This was a favorite pass along recipe .With cloth diapers and old blankets waving in the breeze of clothes lines .Rosy cheeked children ran a muck and this was a great recipe. Its baking in the oven as I write . Its a five star oldie.Thank you emensley for publishing! grandma c of winfield Ill.

I have made these a couple of times, now.  The first time I made them exactly as the recipe stated.  The second time I added 2 teaspoons of ginger, just to spice them up a bit.  We loved them made this way and I will probably use this variation in the future.  However, they are delicious made either way.  These cookies have a lovely soft texture, with a slightly crunchy exterior.  They are very easy to make and use ingredients most of us always have on hand.  A great cookie as is, but also easy to customize and tweak to suit your own personal tastes.

These are good by themselves, simple but somehow not boring.  The really amazing thing about them is that they are the perfect tea cookies!  If you make these, you must try them along side a nice hot cup of Earl Grey.

While the cookies are SO easy to make and turned out perfectly cooked in 15 minutes, they were bland.  I used light brown sugar instead of dark, which was probably my issue.  Because I didn't use the required ingredients, I'm giving it a 4.  Next time, I will use the dark brown sugar or add the molasses and see how they turn out.

This is now my favorite cookie EVER. It's like a blondie in cookie form. AMAZING! I made it exactly as written and I wouldn't make any changes!  These are not bland at all. If you have had blonde brownies, these have the same texture and flavor. Chewy, sweet, and almost like caramel on the inside. Crispy outside. Perfect cookie.

A quick and easy cookie. Moist. Not a whole lot of flavor but the brown sugar made it a nice coffee cookie. I used turbinado sugar for the top which gave it a nice topping.

Love the simplicity. I added about 3 tsps of ground ginger and some salt (I used unsalted butter) and got plenty of positive feedback. Thanks!

These are quite good, they stay soft.   I think they would benefit from an addition thought, perhaps a nut or chocolate chips

I had to use light brown sugar, and added 1/4 tsp of cinnamon and a dash of nutmeg, plus used only 1/2 tsp of vanilla extract, and used almond extract for the other 1/2 tsp. I drizzled them with chocolate after they had cooled. They were supposed to be for work... but my family ate them ALL before I the end of the day! I loved that it didnt involve a lot of ingredients, I already had everything in my pantry.. and it took no time at all to whip up the batch! I will def be making these again!

Delicious!  I loved how they were so easy to make and contained ingredients I typically have in my cupboards.  I added cinnamon to the mix and rolled the cookies in a cinnamon/sugar mixture before baking.

I tried this because nobody in my family likes chocolate and everything was on hand. This cookies was delicious!! I accidentally added half a teaspoon more cinnmon than intended. But that made it even more delicious! It turned out very crunchy, but I will definitely make it again.

These cookies were absolutely delicious. I must admit thou; I did add 1/4 teaspoon of cinnamon to the batter as well as 1/4 teaspoon of almond oil. Every thing else I did as stated.
  Wow, I could hardly constrain myself from wanting to eat the entire batch all at once. This says a lot since I am known for my chocolate loving sweet tooth. This was by far the best cookie recipe I have made and the easiest as well!

If you read a review about the cookies being unflavorful.... it was RIGHT. They are still ok, but they are just missing something. I added cinnamon in the second batch, which helped, but still not that great. These are they type of cookie that would go well with a cup of tea, but on their own they are pretty bland.

Sooooo easy!  I'd give them 10 stars for that.  Taste wise they were a little too bland for me, but my kiddos loved them.  Of course, they have sugar in them and they were called "cookies", which is usually enough to get a positive response.

These were easy to make because all of the ingredients are usually found in anyone's kitchen. I found that sprinkling lots of sugar on them makes them taste alot better. I also added a little bit on cinnamon to the batter. It tasted wonderful.. These were super easy and tasted good. I will most likley make these again.

Delightfully simple recipe .... was in the mood to make cookies for dessert, but didn't want to have to go to the store for any special ingredients.  Voila!  Perfect recipe!  Nice flavor .. not overly sweet.  If sweeter is desired, some sugar sprinkled on top would do the trick.  Great with a glass of milk....the ultimate test!

What a great recipe!  My cookie jar was empty and so was my white sugar cannister.  These were simple and tasty and saved me a trip into town!  Used ingredients exactly as listed but I only baked mine for 12 minutes.  Thanks for sharing!

Great cookies! my only tweak was adding a touch of Almond extract and it turned out amazing! This was my first time ever baking cookies and thanks to how easy it was as well as how good the cookies were, I will be making these again for sure!

I reduced this recipe to only 2/3 of its capacity because I only had about a 1/3 of a cup of butter, and it worked out fine (it might have a bit more egg - how do you figure out 2/3 of an egg? - but I think that's OK).  Turned out perfectly. Nice and simple, with everyday ingredients - I will definitely make this again (maybe with a touch of honey, some cinnamon, and a thinly sliced almond on top???)

Very easy to make and foolproof! wonderful recipe for playing aorund with other ingredients. I may also, as suggested try a second batch by adding some cinammon. Interesingly enough, I ended up with 40 cookies instead of 21... i may have made them smaller but still they came out great :)
