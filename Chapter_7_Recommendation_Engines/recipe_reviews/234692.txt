I added a heaping Tbsp of Better than bouillon vegetable base to the 4 cups of water.  I prefer it to the chicken and it added a lot of flavor.  Thanks to the other review  that the Korean curry powder contains a thickening agent, I added my curry powder (no thickening agent) to the pot when I added water and vegetable base. Gave it some time to absorb into veggies.  Used 2 Tbsp of cornstarch to thicken . 
I tried  2 Tbsp of curry powder but might use a little less next time.  It was good and enjoyed it.

I did some research before making this as I could not find the Korean curry powder recommended in the recipe. It turns out it is a mixture of spices and thickeners. So I substituted 1 tbsp. Mild Curry Powder from allrecipes and 2 tbsp flour. We thought it was good but a little bland as we are used to hotter curries. I will make this again but add 2 or more tbsp. of mild curry powder next time.
