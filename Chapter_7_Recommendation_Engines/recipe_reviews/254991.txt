I am this soup's biggest fan. It is on our table weekly. Probably one of the most versatile and easiest recipes around, you can't screw it up. I've made it using chipotle paste when I was out of ground. I've subbed tofu for the turkey, too. I have found that making the broth way ahead of time, even freezing it, then adding the squash a few minutes before serving, really brings out the flavor. I add sliced avocado and it gives the soup a cool, smooth touch. I've even added guacamole and never even got arrested. This soup rocks! Thank you for the recipe.

This light-tasting soup is a great use for leftover poultry, and it comes together quickly from common pantry items.  I did not have any turkey, so I used chicken.  That was my only change to the recipe, and I believe in soup, turkey and chicken may easily sub for one another.  The cilantro garnish is a good idea, and it adds a fresh flavor dimension.  Thanks for the idea!

Loved this recipe! I used ground turkey instead of diced turkey and browned it while broth was boiling. Will make this one again.

The chipotle pepper gives it a nice kick.  Nice use of the butternut squash.

Delicious!  Did a few different things.  I cut up chicken breasts and browned.  Cooked onion and garlic then added some red bell pepper and the celery to it and cooked a little more.  Spiralized the butternut squash and then cut that in smaller pieces approx 1 - 2 inches long.  Don't like chipotle or cilantro.  Used more regular oregano, some basil, pepper, paprika and cayenne, all to taste.

I just got a new spiralizer so was looking for new recipes.  Since I had left over turkey this was the perfect recipe.  And my family all loved it.
