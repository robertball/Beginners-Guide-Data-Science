This recipe is almost identical to my Grandmother's.  She also added 1/2 tsp of cloves, 1 cup of walnuts increased raisins to 1 cup.  I make them for my brother's birthday - it's a family tradition.

These are tasty and addictive - I couldn't have just one or two!  The only change I would make is by adding a bit more raisins next time (and I will definately make these again).  Thanks for sharing these tasty little morsels!

EASY,EASY,EASY, and something this great shouldn't be sooo easy!  THANK you for a recipe I'm sure to turn to often.  I love oatmeal and raisin, so I did make a small substitute.  I replaced 1/2 cup of flour with 1 cup oatmeal flour that I blended up in my food processor.  The oatmeal flour makes a chewy cookie, and is more soluable, so it takes a cup to replace 1/2 cup of flour. yummy!

I tried this cookie recipe with my 7 year old daughter because she had to make a healthy snack for brownies and needed me to help her with the cooking. Very simple recipe, easy to follow, no rolled oats (which was perfect for us) not to fond of rolled oats, and they tasted marvelous. The only thing different is that I soaked the raisins for 2 hours before making these cookies to make the cookie moist. OTher than that...we had a great time making them and my daughter received her cooking badge. Great cookies!From Saskatchewan

These cookies are delicious and absolutely error proof. I didn't have enough brown sugar so I substitued one cup of the brown sugar with white sugar. I think this is why my cookies came out much fluffier than those pictured above. My flour was also half whole wheat, which made for a healthier cookie. Even though I had to referigerate some of the dough and bake it into a second batch today, both batches came out beautifully. Surely, my cookie tin will be empty again by the end of the day.

These are excellent cookies!  I did make a couple changes, however.  I didn't have any shortening or real butter so I substituted 3/4 cup canola oil and added 1 teaspoon vanilla extract.  After adding the milk the batter was too thin to make drop cookies so I just poured the batter into a 9 X 13 pan and baked them until they were light golden brown.  Delicious!

I put a twist on this recipe by using cranraisins and walnuts in them. They were soft a chewy and wonderful.

This recipe was a lifesaver.  I had an inhuman craving for oatmeal raisin cookies, yet I had no oatmeal.  I made this instead and boy was I satisfied.  So satisfied, in fact, that I ate most of it as batter before I cooked them.  Alas, I did not receive a cooking badge for this.  :)

Wow, incredible! I love them because they are so easy to make. (I can't eat them due to diabetes) My husband and son loved them because of their taste. They loved them too much, in fact. Next time I will freeze half of them before they gorge themselves again! I've never seen cookies disappear so fast!!!

Wow these are really good...I thought they would be lacking in flavor but the brown sugar/shortening combo is dynamite. I added more raisins and even added craisins...just what I had around the house. SOOOO GOOOOOD!! And they even came out pretty :)

I changed this recipe so much that I feel guilty rating it, but it was yummy.

I ran out of brown sugar so i substitued a cup of maple syrup for 1 of the cups of sugar

I didn't have enough raisins so I added some choc chips

i didn't have shortning so i used canola oil

the dough was pretty thin so i baked it in a 9x13 cake pan

but my boyfriend said it tasted like banana bread (without the banana) that his mom used to make.

i named it cookie cake

These were okay.  Not really anything special about them, except that you don't need baking powder to make them (I was out).  I would only make them again if I needed cookies and was out of baking powder.  Not bad, just not spectacular.

Wow! These are great!  I added 1 tsp. pumpkin spice to the cinnamon because I wanted a spicier bite.  Glad I did it. I also took the suggestion to soak the raisins in egg.  Now, all I have to do is give them away so I don't eat them all!

I made this exactly as written and I don't know what I did wrong,  but I think nothing .  Yes, these are flat, not puffy. They stuck like glue to the pan, even after letting them cool.  They are in the oven now on parchment... They tasted very blah to me, certainly not spicy as indicated.  The sad part, I doubled the recipe.  I guess lesson learned, try before doubling.  Grrr.  What a waste of good ingredients.

I'm not sure why, but the first batch was really flat and spread out into one large cookie. So I made the rest into a batch of muffins. The taste is good, but the lower rating is because they just wouldn't come out as cookies.
