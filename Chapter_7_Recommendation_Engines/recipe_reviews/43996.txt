I'm surprised to admit that this is pretty good!  I hardly ever cook from cans and was a little weary about the ingredients in this stew, but after cooking in the crock-pot for over two days the flavors really blended together to make one hearty and healthy stew!  I added LOTS of crushed red pepper to spice it up a bit.

This recipe is definately a 5 star recipe for ease and versatility. I often saute ground beef and just freeze it for future use. With the beef presauteed this would be a VERY quick easy meal. Seems like a cross between baked beans and chili. You can add or omit as you see fit. I sauteed the ground beef with garlic, onion, coriander, cumin, chopped carrots and chipotle peppers. Then threw in the beans, tomatoes, and corn. I also added a can mild chilis. I served it over brown rice, but it would be good over potatoes too (maybe cowboy mashed potatoes from this site).

My 12 year old son was the cook for his Boy Scout campout, and he took along all ingredients, except for the onion.  He got rave reviews from the other boys as well as the adults, and there was enough to feed another starving patrol.  Another hit on the campout was the dessert,campfire banana splits cooked in foil with chocolate chips stuffed in(from this website).

awesome, you can spice this recipe up, or leave as is for a good soup/stew on a cold night.  I added various spices, and a can of diced tomatoes, whole potatoes, an extra can of green bean and a can of peas.  Will make again!

This was very good comfort food and extremely easy to prepare.  Can feed a crowd.  I did use frozen green beans and corn, increased the cooking time a bit.

I found this stew very delicious and filling, and it was a recipe I was able to put together at the last minute with simple ingredients I already had in my kitchen.  I didn't have any canned corn, so I used a 16 oz. bag of frozen corn and it worked just fine.  I didn't drain the kidney beans to make up for the water that would have been in the canned corn.  I didn't use a separate skillet to brown the ground beef--I simply browned the beef and cooked the onions together in my stew pot before draining and adding the remaining ingredients.  I used 1 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper, and that seemed to add just the right amount of seasoning.  Good stuff!  Nice alternative to chili.

So good!  I did add a clove of garlic and some minced jalepeno's for extra flavor; probably use more garlic next time.  Used about 1.5 cups of frozen corn and gr. beans in place of canned.  Served it with mexican blend cheese and sour cream on top.  Ohhh, yummy.

I didn't think I'd like this but it was very good. A typical scout camp meal. In keeping with tradition, I added a little ketchup on the side! Very fast, easy and good. Not fancy, and also a good traveling meal as you don't need to use any fresh ingredients.

Took this in a crockpot camping and served it with Tostitos Scoops as a dip/snack!! I think I may have used diced tomatoes instead of stewed though just because I didn't pay attention to what I was buying! It was a definite hit!

Excellent "quick-fix" that everyone loves! I added a drained can of mixed vegetables, instead of the green beans, and just before it finished cooking I added a handful of egg noodles.
Men & boys loooove this dish! For a change in flavor, consider adding curry powder too!

I ran into this recipe one night while trying to throw together something hearty for dinner. I did not have a can of stewed tomatoes and instead used 2 cans of Rotel tomatoes and 1 small can of tomato sauce. WOW, super delicious! Will definitely make again.

Really simple - really yummy!  We had to leave the beans out because of an allergy in the family, but I'm sure it's even better with them!  Definitely recommend this recipe for camping!

My stepdad used to make this stew for us as kids. I like his recipe a bit better. He didn't chop the onions, instead he cut them into eighths and peeled them to the core. Also some potatoes and carrots chopped and tossed in really adds some texture. He also used quite a bit of beef broth as most of it would evaporate with cooking. He let the stew sit in the fridge for two days and then cooked it for a whole day in a huge pot, but crockpots work as well.

Suprisingly good for the effort needed.  I like things hot so I used salsa (hot) in lieu of the tomatoes, but other than that stayed pretty true.

This stew is quick, easy, delicious and filling!  I added garlic and a half jar of jalapeños because it was cold out and a spicy stew was just what I wanted.

This is the stew my body has been craving. My mother used to make this for me as a child, and my son-in-law, an Eagle Scout; reintroduced me. I love this with a not too sweet cornbread.

I thought this stew was awesome. I dont care for stew with tomatoes in it but this was delicious. I substituted Rotel's "Hot" version, added two cut up russetts and some peppers. AWESOME!

I have made this several times now.  It is easy and flavorful. I made a little addition of 1 large can of tomato paste and use italian seasoning instead of the oregano. Everyone gets a chuckle at the name but love it when they taste it.

This is a quick fix, warm dinner.  I substitute frozen veggies for canned.  This is a meal with a little imagination you can add what you have in your cupboards.  ie chili beans instead of kidney etc.  We all love it.

Not bad tasting, but probably would not make again.
