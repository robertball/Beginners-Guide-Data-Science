followed this receipe to a T and after I added the whip cream, the whip cream did not get stiff, beat it for over 1/2 on high speed it remained just thick.  I really think something is wrong with this receipe.  I think the cream cheese and sugar should be beaten separtely and the whip cream whipped until stiff in a separate bowl, and then after the whipped cream is stiff add it to the cream cheese mixture. would like your comment

I thought this recipe was very easy to make.  I didn't have any trouble getting it to get thick.  I did make a couple of adjustments.  I increased the sugar to 2/3 c. and added a little bit of vanilla.  I love the graham cracker crust so I made it extra thick.  I also make it in a 9" square pan.  It was delicious!!  For those who had trouble getting it thick, make sure that you have "heavy" whipping cream.

This was the BEST no bake recipe I have ever found. I made this in no time at all ..over Christmas and have not stopped making it! Never any problems with it not thickening, it is a tasty treat every time I have made it.

I just love this recipe and so does the rest of my family. I have used it so many times I have memorized it. I have a few quick tips for it though. #1 whip the cream first before mixing, #2 use 2 TBL spoons of vanilla and less lemon. #3 double the sugar amount, #4 serve a day later after it has time to sit it gets a really great texture

I've made this recipe twice now, with great success each time.  The only thing I changed in the recipe was that I used a container of frozen whipped topping from the store instead of the whipping cream, and I added extra cinnamon (my favorite spice) and 2 540ml cans of filling as I could hardly taste the 1 can of filling the first time I made it.  I always use a 9x13 pan for this, and the crumb mixture is just the perfect amount.

This easy and delicious recipe too me 28 minutes to make, and I plan to use this as a base for a recipe I've been concocting in my mind.

OK so this was pretty good. I took it to work and got a few greats and a few its ok but a bit too fluffy/soft.  I thought that this would be good for hot weather so that the oven doesn't have to be turned on.  However, this is not something that can sit out for even a 1/2 hour, IMO.  I would think that gelatin, jello or maybe even instant pudding would add to the stability or maybe the dreamwhip solution some have mentioned.  Bottom line is the flavor was good only change I made was a little vanilla and a bit more sugar.
****** UPDATE
I had some leftover so I stuck it in the freezer then pulled it out 2 days later.  Once it completely thawed in the fridge the texture was better and the flavor too - now I' m not sure if it was the freezing or if ageing - maybe try making this more like 2 days in advance and perhaps storing in the freezer a bit.  Iâ€™ll give this one another whirl. PS  - I served the cherries on the side did not top with them, thought it would be too soft to hold them originally.

I am an accomplished chef with my own catering business as well as a nurse at the local hospital.  Although most of the cakes I make take 2-3 days to finish, I was asked to make something last minute for a collegue's birthday who loves Blueberry Cheesecake.  The basis for this recipe was very good, but I did change some things as suggested by other reviewers.  I doubled the cream cheese and increased the white sugar to 3/4 cup.  I also whipped the cream cheese with all the ingredients EXCEPT the heavy cream which I whipped separately until stiff and folded it into the cream cheese mixture.  I also used Tyler Florence's recipe for Blueberry Topping.  Since this cake was a surprise, it sat in the pan in my car from 6:30 am until 2 pm (cold temperatures here in NY).  Not only did this cake unmold perfectly, it kept its form beautifully.  It was the rave and everyone requested the recipe.  Good Job, Thank you!

The taste is very good, there's no doubt about that. BUT no amount of chilling got the cake to form - I resorted to freezing it and thawing for a bit before serving. Any ideas on how to make this good recipe great?

I tried this recipe out at a potluck and everyone loved it.  I too added 2/3 c. of sugar and I made sure that my whipping cream was very cold. I also chilled my bowl in advance. I omitted the lemon and added clear vanilla instead. For a topping I crushed snicker bars and drizzled melted chocolate chips and caramel. It was Delicious:)

My daughter and I made these for dessert, and after taste testing the mixture, found it to be a little too bitter and added another 1/3 cup sugar......that made all the difference!!We served them in individual shells, and ended up with 12, they were very good and sooo easy, thanks for the recipe.

I made the crust with cinnamon grahams. I baked my crust at 350* for eight minutes until brown. I also used reduced fat cream cheese and two teaspoons REAL vanilla flavoring instead of lemon juice (my husband does not care for lemon-tasting cheesecakes). I made my own topping for this cheesecake (Supreme Strawberry Topping, which is also from this site. I doubled the original recipe to make enough to fully cover the whole cheesecake.) This turned out FABULOUS. Looks like it should be on the cover of a magazine! Don't let this cheesecake fool you, even though it's made with half whipped cream, it's still very rich. Smaller pieces are the way to go. NOTE: For those who wonder how many graham crackers will make 1 1/2 cups, a rule of thumb for me is one whole package (sleeve?) of graham crackers. EDITED REVIEW: For those who have not made this yet but are thinking of making it, let me make one suggestion. If you can, wait to put the topping on the cheesecake until you serve it. I didn't think that me putting my homemade topping on top was a big deal, until I took it out of the cheesecake pan. The cheesecake kind of collapsed because the topping was heavier than the cheesecake (which is totally a "duh" moment because of course it is, it's made with whipped cream!). It was still really tasty but hard to get pieces cut out because it looked a mess. We also thought this would make a GREAT frozen cheesecake.

I am a High School Foods teacher and i have used this recipe with my students.  One thing I can offer to the folks who had a hard time getting the recipe to set up is to tell you what I tell my students. Your saliva will break down the protein in the cream cheese and the whipping cream and will not allow the product to set up.  No licking the beaters or sneaking fingers into the mixing  bowl!  If you start over and have not completely cleaned all utinsils  and equipment the same thing will happen!

My BF made this cheesecake for me as a surprise for my birthday.  He had never even heard of a spring form pan before!  He followed the recipe exactly, and it was awesome.  Everyone who I was kind enough to share a slice with loved it.  Thanks for sharing the recipe :)

I did what a lot of others did - 2/3 cup of sugar, double the amount of cream cheese, and half of the whipped cream. I used fresh lemon juice as well. The cake came out fabulous. I'd recommend freezing it for the first half hour then putting it in the fridge - mine set perfectly and was SO SO SO tasty with the adjustments.

You can play around with the amount of cream to suit your taste.  The trick for me is soften the cream cheese in the mic....use a low or defrost setting and it makes it nice and soft to blend in the sugar and lemon juice.  In a separate bowl whip the cream very stiff, then add to the cream cheese mixture. You should get no lumps this way and also should firm up in the fridge.  I also bake the crumb mixture...brings out a nice flavour and crispier texture.

I ADORE the fact that this recipe doesn't have awful-tasting and chemical-laden Kool Whip in it like most no-bake cheese cakes do. Thank you from the bottom of my "real food only" heart!

This is a fantastic recipe!  The second time added 2 tbsp. of instant vanilla pudding to the cream cheese. Also, I took the advice of whipping the cream until soft peaks formed,dbld the sugar. Doesn't the lemon help it thicken (like curdle)?Or is it an acid that keeps it from thickening?I like the taste of lemon and vanilla. The possibilities are endless with this recipe.Thank you!

This may be one of the best cheesecakes I have ever made.  I was having a houseload of people so I made this in advance and put it in the freezer, because I had so many things to prepare and it was outstanding!  Just thaw for approximately 15-20 minutes before serving.  Remember to whip the cream and fold in already whipped.  This could be why some are having difficulty.  This easily deserves a 5 star.  I used Raspberry pie filling as the topping and drizzled hot fudge sauce on top before freezing.  Next time I will make with Cherry pie filling as recommended.  This one is definitely a keeper.

It's easy to make, I halved the recipe and put into the pre-made six tart graham crust things from the store.  They made nice little mounds. :)   I'm only giving it two stars because it needs waaaay more sugar than the recipe says.   Right now it tastes like whipped cream topping, so I had to add more sugar to make it taste nice.  Other than that, five stars for the easiness of this recipe! :)

This cheese cake is so easy.  I often have trouble with baking cheese cakes as I always manage to not get it on time and it cracks a little at the top but with this no bake cheese cake there was  no cracking and no worrying it wouldn't be done.  I just did it in the evening and served next day for dinner with topping of choice.  It was delicious and was even asked for the recipe.

Excellent no bake recipe and so easy. For those who seem to have trouble getting their cream to whip here is a suggestion:   make sure that your bowl is grease free and that it is cold and also the beaters.   I think trying to make this in humid weather may be a problem.   I also know there are stabilizers you can buy for whipping cream so you could check them out.  Thanks again for a super recipe.

My experience: I whipped the cream first and then added the cream cheese the first time.  This resulted in small lumps of cream cheese in the filling.  I would recommend doing it the other way around as I did the second time I made the filling.  Whipping cream stiffens easily, it's not a problem like egg whites can be.

Followed the recipe exactly as written and all turned out very well. The pie filling did tend to run after removing the spring-pan sides. Also, I used a 9" springform pan and it worked well, not sure that an 8" would hold all the filling. Great recipe.

The problem with the recipe is that the whipping cream is twice as much as you need. The DreamWhip recipe on the box is exactly the same as this one except it only calls for 1/2 pint of DreamWhip (or 250 ml)  . . this recipe says to use 500ml or a pint.  Try starting with 1/2 the amount and continue to add to taste/texture. Whipping it beforehand is a good idea. I agree with adding a bit more sugar and vanilla to the cream cheese as well.

Made this for my guy's birthday. He liked it. Only thing I changed a bit was just adding 2 crumbled Snickers bars over the top, then drizzeled chocolate sauce over the top. It set well after being in the fridge over night.

This was okay, but I prefer the Eagle Brand no-bake recipe, pretty much the same except you use Eagle Brand sweetened milk instead of whip cream and sugar! Easier and quicker with better results. Everyone loves this one with or without a topping.

I use a recipe similar to this one but if you only add the sugar as this recipe states it is not sweet enough. I add 1 can of sweetened condensed milk and 1 tsp of vanilla extract. It will make this recipe perfect with the right amount of sweetness.

The BEST!! no-bake cheesecake ever!!!  my only doc. recommendations are to double the sugar, and an extra 2 Tbsp. melted butter and i omitted the lemon juice(i was fresh out)  but all in all, this was by far the best cheesecake ever!  I had to make 2 of them back to back for my husband.  To make it extra fluffier, whip everything together longer til the mix becomes very stiff, almost like making your own whipped cream

I am going to give this 5 SOLID stars for EASE of making.  I used a pie plate and gingersnap cookies w/butter for the crust and followed the recipe to the letter the first time.  NEXT time I will add more sugar and less whipping cream.  I did not have any issues with whipping the cream into the cream cheese mixture.  To "avoid" any lumpy texture you have to whip the cream cheese and sugar FIRST then add vanilla and lemon juice--whip well THEN add the whipping cream.  I have to admit I would not be as happy if I had to use a hand mixer with this.....I have a Kitchen-Aid mixer and with it's extra power the cream cheese whipped beautifully with the whipping cream for a smooth, light texture.  BUT.....this one's a KEEPER and will be going into my "camping recipes" because anything no bake is GOOD!  THANKS FOR SHARING!

Great recipe.  Although I was worried since so many people had trouble getting it to set up.  To solve the problem, I simply replaced half of the cream with water mixed with gelatin.  Worked perfectly and the cheesecake was awesome!  I actually made it with Splenda and put it in little cupcake containers for individual size portions.
Thanks for the recipe!

Tasted very good, but didn't give the real cheese cake taste, it had too much cream.  I will make it again though and I do recommend it.  Very tasty.

I tried this for New Year's Eve and it was delicious!  I did make some adjustments based on what other reviewers said.  1) I whipped the heavy cream separately. 2) I increased the sugar to 2/3 cup and mixed it with the cream cheese and lemon juice. 3) I added 1 tsp of unflavored gelatin to the cream cheese mixture. Then mix the whipped cream into the cream cheese mixture using a wisk attachment until just incorporated. I also made a chocolate crust, using 20 crushed oreos in food processor, then processed 3 tablespoons of unsalted butter and pressed it into a 10 in springform pan (bake the crust for 10 min. at 350). Let cool then fill.

Loved the recipe! Had to make changes only because I didn't have everything.  only 1/2 pint heavy cream-so i used 1/2 & 1/2 to make the differnce.  beat the heck out of it and fluffed up nicely.  :)  everyone loved it! even my hubby who doesn't enjoy sweets.

Okay, I followed several suggestions for this recipe but it is absolutely fabulous. First off, I used a shortbread crust from a recipe I found on here. Second I spooned some hot fudge sauce that another reviewer suggested over the top of the crust, just a thin layer. Then I doubled the cream cheese and added two tablespoons of vanilla and put in 1/2 cup of sugar. Make sure you fold the whipped cream in and don't beat it with a mixer! Then I put some strawberry pie filling on the top and put it in the fridge overnight. Oh wow is this good! I made this for company along with another recipe for a double layer pineapple upside down cake, thankfully this one turned out because the double layer pineapple cake was a disaster! Kudos to all the others for the great suggestions and thanks for the submitter for giving such an awesome starter recipe to work with!

YUM! Next time I will double the crust because I'd like it a little thicker. Had no prob with whipping cream because I used a glass bowl that I put in the freezer for about 20 minutes to whip it in. I did that separate from the cream cheese then folded them together with the sugar. Set up fine. Great for a quick fix. Let is chill in fridge for about 18 hours before we ate any.

I really enjoyed the ease of the preparation and my family really enjoyed it. There are only two comment that I would make. It is that even after an overnight stay in the refrigerator the cheesecake was still soft which made it a bit difficult to cut into pieces. Also, next time I make this I may only use 3/4 of the cream because the cream taste did take away from the cream cheese. This might also make the cheese cake firmer. But overall I do enjoy the cheesecake... Thanks for the recipe!

It was my Best Friends Birthday and he said he didn't want anything.  I said well what do you want to eat?  I'll make you your favorite food, Whatever.  He found this recipe handed it to me and said "make me this,  I Love Cheesecake, there thats my birthday present"  Okay I thought I've never made a cheescake before this will be interesting.  Funny enough, it's like it was meant to be.  I had everything on hand.  Whipped it up in a jiff.  It was awesome! The hardest part was having to wait for it in the fridge.  We waited about 3 hours couldn't do it any more. We should have, cause it was still soft, but it was still good.  I will definitely make this again!! Maybe this time I'll wait.

I made this for a family gathering and I had numerous comments on how great it was.  I topped it with peaches and I did my crust a bit different.  But it is so light and just sweet enough!  Will definitely make  this again.

Just a suggestion, if you use canned fruit, make sure you DRAIN it. Pie filling is fine just the way it is. Good recipe!

Liked this recipe a lot! Because I dislike pie-filling and canned fruits as dessert toppings, I added some spices to the filling. Cardamom, vanilla extract, cinnamon, allspice and nutmeg (in descending order of quantity added) made a HUGE difference in a filling that tasted just too much like cream cheese (even for a cheesecake).

this was ok for a base recipe to modify to our tastes, i used the 1/3 less fat neuf cheese instead of cream cheese, 1 container of fat free frozen whipped topping, lemon juice, and white sugar, but had to add powdered sugar about 3/4 cups. I did not have any trouble with it being thick at all.  for the crust; 1 package of grahm crackers(not whole box, 1 package out of box) 1/2 cup brown sugar, 1/4 cup melted butter and cinnamon and baked crust for 10 min in 375 oven, it turned out crispy... we'll see how it tastes later :)

This is a very simple very good quick no bake cheesecake.  I also used a ready made pie shell, however, I used 1 inner package of dream whip which I prepared myself (and added 2 tbls of powdered sugar and 1 tbls vanilla to) and threw that in the freezer INSTEAD of a pint of whipping cream.  While that was chilling, I whipped 2 room temperature packages of light cream cheese with 1/3 cup of powdered sugar and 1 tbls vanilla and the lemon juice.  The key is to really whip the cream cheese smooth before adding the whip cream. This set up perfectly, was amazingly thick and creamy and had great flavor.  My daughter LOVED it!

I have tried this recipe twice, the first time round it was runny. The cream cheese and whipping milk did not mix well at all. It was liquid with bits of cheese floating around. I dump it in the freezer and ate it as ice-cream. Taste was great tho. I tried it again after reading all the reviews and this time the texture was excellent. I live in Singapore its hot and humid here so what I did was to beat the whipping cream till stiff in a frozen bowl and put it in the fridge and did up all the rest of the ingredients before I fold in the stiff whipping cream with the cream cheese mixture. I mix well it real well to avoid getting lumps of cream cheese+sugar and plain tasting whipping cream.

Absolutely simple and fast.  This came out excellent and I had no issue with it thickening up at all.  I did chill a bowl and mixed the whipping cream first and once it was thick I just added it to the cream cheese and carried on.  Thank you - I will be making this again I am sure.

Just the taste i'm looking for.  Not too sweet but just perfect.  Everybody loved it so much that my husband actually asked me to make another one after serving this at our party.  I also added chopped walnuts on the crust which made it more extraordinary!  Really love it!

This tasted so great!  I whipped the cream before mixing with cream cheese(beaten too). Added 2 T vanilla and 2/3 c sugar. Reminded me of frozen lemon cream pies my dad would buy when we were kids!  Wow! I will add more lemon next time!

Really good cheesecake!  I modified just a little..used 3 things of cream cheese and 1 1/2 pints of heavy whipping cream, 2/3 cup sugar and a sprinkle of gelatin (to hold together).  Other than that the recipe was the same.  I followed the directions exactly, no need to seperatly whip the heavy cream, dumped in same bowl as cream cheese.  Crust exactly the same!  I covered mine with blueberry topping and it was delicious.  Even my kids enjoyed it - and they are very picky!  Will definilty make again!

This was one of the best No Bake Cheesecakes I have ever made.  I allowed it to "rest" in the refrigerator two full days.  It was high, light and fluffy.  I used three 8 oz cream cheeses and the full pint of heavy whipping cream.  It was great.

This is a wonderful cheesecake.  As some had problems with this setting I added another 1/2 package of cream cheese but it really didn't need it.  I whipped up the whipped cream first, added the sugar to it then blended the beaten cheese and whipped cream together.  Topped all with a can of cherry pie filling.

Super easy and tastes good, so I recomend it anyone who wants to make something yummy without putting much effort into it... personally I don't care for "no-bake" cheesecakes... I was just short on time... so I couldn't make a real, honest cheesecake... however this will do for tonight... all in all a good so-easy-it-takes-the-fun-out-of-it recipe... (It's not fun unless you have to work for it!)

Great no-bake to throw together! First time I made this, I also had issues with getting it just-so. I substituted the white sugar with confectioners (icing) sugar. With the whipped cream, I used the 35% m.f. cream, whipped that until soft peaks started to form, then added in one package of vanilla instant pudding powder. Mixed it all together, and it turned out beautifully! I also did not add in the lemon juice, because it is an acid, it really shouldn't be used in this recipe. If you want a lemon flavor, use lemon extract. I just used 1 tsp of vanilla extract because I had the pudding powder. Also, I omitted the crust, and poured the cheesecake over a cooled chocolate cake I made. It was awesome! Gone within minutes!

My mom and I made this cheesecake and topped it with the caramel apple pie filling from the "Apple Pie by Grandma Ople" recipe (http://allrecipes.com/Recipe/Apple-Pie-by-Grandma-Ople/Detail.aspx), instead of cherry pie filling, for a family get together. Everyone jumped for a piece and wolfed it down!

THIS BY FAR WAS THE WORST CAKE I HAVE EVER MADE. I DID EVERYTHING AS FOLLOWED. THE LEMON JUICE OVER POWERED THE CREAM CHEESE. I NOW HAVE A CHEESE CAKE THAT I CAN DRINK. LOL SERIOUSLY PEOPLE IF YOU REALLY WANT A CHEESE CAKE DO NOT MAKE THIS ONE. MAKE A NEW YORK ORIGANAL INSTEAD.

This tastes wonderful, but is nothing like cheesecake as texture goes.  I would definitely recommend freezing to get it to set.

This was quick and easy and I took the advice of other reveiws- 2/3 cup sugar, 1 1/2 cup heavy whipping cream (whipped before adding- make sure the beaters and bowl are way cold too), added vanilla.  It was not as solid as the other cheesecakes that I've made, but it wasn't soupy either.  I also used a nilla wafer crust (made in food processor, easiest way  to make crust).  It didn't have a super cheesecakey taste.  My husband said he liked it, but I made it Sunday and there's still half in the fridge.  Usually cheesecake doesn't last in our house this long.  The best part was not having to use the oven.  To sum it up, quick and easy, made a few changes, tasted good but wasn't the best cheesecake I've ever made.

I wish I would've read some of the reviews before trying this recipe.  I couldn't get it to set up either.  The flavor was a little bland, so I too added xtra sugar, and some vanilla, plus a bit more lemon juice.  It just wouldn't set up, was very soft.  But, that flavor turned out  great with xtra additions.  My squeeze didn't care that it needed eaten with a spoon, it tasted so good. Don't think I'll try this one again tho.

Great, easy no-bake recipe.  I also doubled the sugar, and I used Tofutti cream cheese.  Like a  light, creamy no-bake cream cheese pie filling, exactly what I was looking for.  The graham cracker crust is quick and easy, and I topped it with raspberry preserves.  Good either chilled in the fridge or frozen (like cheesecake ice cream).    Now if only they'd make soy cream...

I made this with my preschools students using pre-made mini-crusts for our Mother's Day Tea.  I live in Taiwan so the trick is to make something that is not too sweet to the Taiwanese.  The kids and the moms loved it and were asking for the recipe!

I have been making this recipe for years - I made it for my daughter's first birthday and I now have it out for her 8th birthday - it's always her request!  It's delicious and easy.  I too add a touch of vanilla but otherwise, depsite being someone who uses recipes as 'base' ideas for my cooking, I stick to this recipe pretty faithfully!  EVERYONE always comments how delicious my cheesecake is and no matter how much I make, theres never any left!!  Thanks for sharing Debbie Clark!!

I cheated and used a ready made chocolate pie crust.  I didn't use the lemon juice but I doubled the sugar, added 2 TBS vanilla and crushed Oreos.  There was enough filling for two pies.

The cheesecake was just FABULOUS! It reminded me of the slices of cheesecake I've had at the Cheesecake Factory. I'm not kidding - it was THAT good. Plus, my husband, who doesn't like cheesecake, actually ate a whole slice - and then asked for a second serving, which was quite shocking, considering he never prefers cheesecake for dessert! He is a now a cheesecake convert and now loves cheesecake (at least this one). THAT is the true power of this recipe.

Loved it & so did my husband. I used the suggestion from another review to use frozen whip topping instead of the heavy cream. Yum! Then, I used the chocolate Graham crackers for the crust. The remainder i sprinkled on top.  then i placed sliced fresh strawberries on top instead of anything canned. Anything fresh is always good. Considered sliced bananas but had plenty of strawberries.

Loved it! It was super easy, and it wasn't too dense (which my husband hates). For those who couldn't get it to set, I would guess you didn't beat the cream long enough. I did add a little vanilla to the cream cheese. Ours turned out perfectly. We didn't have any cherry pie topping, so we drizzled chocolate and caramel topping over it. YUM! This is a definite keeper.

Fixed it as written except 2/3 cup sugar.  Had absolutely no trouble getting it thick doing it exactly as written.  It couldn't be any easier to make.  My issue is that it's more whipped cream than cheesecake, both in taste and texture.  On taste, it was kind of like cheesecake flavored whipped cream.  On texture, I waited to put the topping on until the next day, but the cake still couldn't handle the weight.  It's easy enough that I will try again, but next time I will probably go with 3 packages of cream cheese, and 1 cup of whipped cream.  It just needs more heft.

Very easy recipe. Had no trouble getting mixture to thicken. Final product was very pretty. Very bland flavor, tastes like whipping cream. I used more lemon juice than the recipe called for and still bland and tasteless. Not worth the calories which is a shame since the finished pie is so pretty. Three stars based on ease of recipe and attractiveness of pie.

Turned out perfect with a few tweaks suggested by other reviewers. I chilled my glass bowl and mixers and beat the heavy whipping cream seperately. In a seperate bowl I mixed the cream cheese and 2/3 cup of sugar, lemon juice and added some vanilla. Once well mixed I added the whipping cream and mixed. Mixture was nice and thick! And the taste was delicious!

Just tried this 3 hours ago but made some adjustments because a few ingredients were not available at the store: i used two 9" graham cracker crusts instead of making my own, 2 cans of table cream (Nestle) instead of heavy whipping cream, and used a cup of white sugar. I transferred the table cream to a bowl, left it in the freezer for a couple of minutes so its cold, then blended it with the cream cheese mixture to ensure fluffiness. I also chilled the pie before putting my blueberry filling on top. It yielded two pies and my boyfriend cant stop eating it! Thank you for the original recipe!

This cheesecake is a good start to something amazing.  Instead of graham crumbs, I used oreo cookie crumbs and made the crust according to the directions on the box.  I doubled the sugar to 2/3 cup and used 1 tsp. lemon juice and 1 tsp. vanilla.  I then added 2 cups of pureed frozen berries (measured frozen) and omitted the cherry pie filling.  This cheesecake was light and fluffy and absolutely delicious served slightly thawed.  The biggest problem was that it melted as soon as it warmed up!  Next time I will try the recipe as is and see what happens.

I have made a similar no bake cheesecake, but I beat lemon jello into the cream cheese, then add whipped topping. It makes a light, fluffy cheesecake like dessert without all the fuss of baking. I've added blueberries, cherries, strawberries, and other fresh fruits for variety.

Absolutely amazing! My whole family loved it 4th of July, still getting requests for recipe or for me to make it.  I made them in the mini, individual shells.  For Labor Day, I doubled the fresh lime jusice, and they were Key Lime Pie Cheesecakes. You gotta make these.  Freeze them, then defrost. Thx for the great recipe!

This recipe was extremely easy! I didn't have the issue with the whipping cream, but as I had read previous reviews I added it slowly while whipping, I too added the extra sugar, and as such it has turned out perfect. Delicious....and worthy of ruining a diet over. ; )

I've been making a similar cheesecake for years. This is a very good recipe. For 2 packages of cream cheese, may I suggest replacing the heavy cream with one large and one small container of Dream Whip. Also, increase the lemon juice to 4 teaspoons and the sugar to 1/2 cup. Chill for at least 4 hrs.

This is a great cheesecake. It does not have the same texture as real baked cheesecake but I found it to be firm enough and hold it's shape. The graham cracker crust was absolutely delicious. I found this recipe to be easy enough to make. To hurry up the process of making this dish I softened up my cream cheese in the microwave carefully so it would be soft enough to whip up, instead of waiting all day for it to become soft. I would have given this cheesecake 5 stars but the heavy whipping cream does give a whipping cream after taste in your mouth and that was the only thing that bothered me. I found that pouring cherry pie filling over it helped cover up this taste. My husband loved this and would eat it everyday if he could. He is not easy to please all the time with food so I was glad to hear that this is a keeper!

This cheesecake was really good and easy to make. I added an addtional 1/3 cup sugar and a bit of vanilla as others had recommended.  It set up nicely and everyone at our Friday night Bible Study enjoyed it. My one suggestion is that it be made a day ahead of time as it is firmer today than yesterday. Someone in our group told me whipping cream needs 24 hours to set up and I believe it.  Overall, great recipe!

This was lurvly....I didnt take a pic unfortunately, only made a lil mistake, i whisked until stiff but then i think i over beat so the cream cheese didnt set as much as i would have liked but was still yummy...Tip, soon as mixture goes stiff stop mixing... Also for fruit topping i made berry topping with strawberries, blackberries and rasberries. Put fruit in pan on medium heat add sugar to taste, berries will make own juice..warm through until sauce thickens, when cool pour on top of chilled cheesecake or pour sauce on each serving. Berry Sauce is delightful and is also super with most desserts esp Ice Cream

This cheesecake is awesome! I did make a couple of adjustments. Instead of the heavy cream I used 1 envelope of dreamwhip that I beat seperately and then added to the whipped creamcheese and I doubled the sugar to 2/3c. I will make this for all of my get togethers! Thanks for the recipe

This recipe is great, and although I changed a few things it still came out Yummy. We never have left overs of this cheesecake and I also make this for people at my husbands work place. I changed the Lemon Juice to 3 Tablespoons, 1 Tub of french vanilla cool whip Instead of the cream, 1/4 cup of sugar, And one can of Apple Pie Filling as the topper And if mix seems to thick just add a little milk as you are mixing. This is a Super Easy and Quick Pie/Cheesecake to Prepare and we Love it....Thanks All

This was the best crust we have ever eaten, however, I couldn't get the cake itself to set up.  I wonder if it would have set better had I whipped the heavy cream separately or perhaps used cool-whip instead.  It had a "foamy" type of texture to it as well.  I also added more sugar than the recipe called for.  Ah well...practice makes perfect! :-)

Thanks to other reviewers, I used another 1/3 cup of sugar. Also, after I began making the dish I realized I only had half of the heavy cream that I needed, so I added a healthy spoonful of sour cream to make up for it. I couldn't tell the difference, taste-wise, but it never did set up very well, it was more like cheesecake soup. I figure that was due to the sour cream, tho?
I gave this a high rating because it was actually very delicious, super easy, and my family loved it, even eaten out of ice-cream bowls!  
I will definitely try this again with the correct ingredients.

I sent this cheescake to my husbands work and have been getting compliments ever since.I freeze the cheescake, cut it up into bite size pieces and drizzle melted milk chocolate chips on it.  Almost like the store brand but a lot creamier, and freezing the cheesecake makes for easier cutting.

I replaced the canned cherries with crushed graham crackers mixed with brown sugar (same mix as the crust minus the butter) I covered the top and sides with the mix. Delish!

Easy, peasy.  I didn't put a topping on it, I put the toppings in a separate bowl and let my guests choose which topping they wanted to use. Cherry, blueberry, strawberry, carmel, pecans, and cool whip. They really loved it.

Super easy, light and fluffy! I had to change the quantities into metric though and thought my conversion was for too much whipping cream but it is really, really good! Makes baking simple, and since theres no cheesecake here in this sleepy little Mexican fishing village, they think itÂ´s super complicated... LOL!

I now use the whipped cream cheese (instead of the traditional blocks), add vanilla powder to the crust, and almond extract to the batter. I have also made it strictly following the recipe.  Both versions are fabulous.  Instead of fruit topping I warm up some hot fudge sauce.  It's a big hit!

We loved this, it was so creamy, but not too sweet.  (We prefer desserts that are not overly sweet, where you can taste all the ingredients and not just the sugar.)  This makes a large batch, so I ended up splitting it in half and pouring it into two store-bought graham cracker crusts I had in my pantry.  I can buy all the ingredients I need for $8, and get 2 delicious homemade cheesecakes just the way I like them!  Be warned, however, that I tried making another batch using whipping cream I'd frozen,and it did NOT turn out well.  So this recipe will definitely call for fresh ingredients.  Well worth it, though.  I'm going to buy enough ingredients for a double batch and give them away for everyone's Labor Day cookout desserts, lol.  Thanks for sharing your recipe!

I made cheesecake stuffed strawberries using this recipe and it was perfect! I made a mistake and forgot to add the heavy cream. I realized this the next day. It was probably ok because I wasn't eating this on it's own, but stuffed into something. Good to know for next time should I not have heavy cream on hand.

Super good and easy recipe for a quick cheesecake fix
. I would give it 5 stars, but I think the amount of cream is off. I used 1/2 cup heavy cream to the 2 boxes cream cheese. Maybe the full amount of cream (whipped separately from the cream cheese and folded in) is good if you like a fluffy texture and less cream cheese flavor. 
I like a denser, richer feel, so the 1/2 cup was perfect for me. 
I doubled the lemon juice and as many reviewers suggested, used 2/3 cup sugar. Great flavor, nice and thick. I didn't whip the cream first....just poured it into the cream cheese mixture and whipped for about 3 minutes. Really like this recipe, and will use it often. Thanks!

This recipe was just alright for me. If you are looking for a light fluffy filling, this is for you. Skip it if you want a rich filling.

The first 2 bites were fine.  But after that I felt like I was eating straight-up butter.  I guess it was too rich for my taste.

I sometimes use whipped topping, the 8oz found in the freezer section of the supermarket, instead of whipping cream, and it doesn't need the long refrigerator time. When I used the recipe exactly, I add 1/8 more sugar.

I added nutmeg to crust and then the crust really pops out with flavor. I also added vanilla to the filling to enhance the flavor. I do cream the cream cheese and sugar before I add the other ingredients. I also added 1 package of unflavored gelatin to the mix. It caused the filling to stand up when cut.  The second time I made this I tripled the recipe and   put it on a 12x17 sheet pan for a party and got rave reviews.

I made this sugar free by using a brown sugar substitute in the crust and splenda in the cheese cake part.  I served the cherries on the side since I couldn't find a sugar free brand.  It is not like a baked cheesecake, but was delicious.

I made my own GF tart crust and changed the filling upon others recommendation. I whipped the cream first and could have served it right away. I added 1/2 cup sugar. I also added 2 tablespoon vanilla. I then divided the filling into three. To one of the three I added dark chocolate chips. To the other I added key lime juice and the third, I left as is. I ate the key lime with no cherries, the chocolate chip one I added cherries, and the lemon one I added fresh blackberries, raspberries and strawberries for a morning tart. From this one recipe I got three different desserts using small tart crusts.

This is the BEST no-bake cheesecake I have ever made.   I topped mine with drizzled dark chocolate and dark chocolate dipped strawberries.   It was a HUGE hit.  I made the recipe per the instructions.

Love this recipe, it was so simple and easy to make. Tried this recipe with a little alteration, upped the sugar to 2/3 cup and substituted 8-10 oz of sour cream in place of the whipping cream and it worked wonderfully and received rave reviews.

I basically followed the recipe, but made it slightly easier for me by doing the following.  It was really yummy!  

1.  I used a store bought graham crust which I sprinkled brown sugar and cinnamon on.
2.  I used a full container of Cool Whip rather than heavy whipping cream.
3.  I used 2/3 C. Sugar instead of 1/3.
4.  I covered the top with lemon custard that is handmade by my grocery store, but I imagine any custard or filling would work...

YUM.  I couldn't wait until dessert to try it!

This was VERY good! The only complaint I have is that it tasted like it had a little bit too much cream cheese. Other than that, it was VERY delicious! I used this for the Fourth of July, so I made a star out of sliced strawberries and placed blueberries around the outside. I topped it off with a little bit of strawberry syrup. VERY good!

EASY!  EASY! EASY! I followed the directions as written and it came out perfectly. I did increase the sugar to 3/4 cup and added 2 tsp. vanilla. If people had trouble with the batter being thin, they must not have read the directions. It is important to read all the words in a recipe and then to do what it says to do!

My family begs for this cheesecake, it is so good, and always gone so fast. Yes, I cheat and buy the already made graham crust... but the rest is just too easy. For those who had trouble getting it to set right, you have to blend with an electric mixer for a bit, keep mixing until the desired texture. We love this recipe!!!! Make it once and you'll be hooked too!!!!

I cheated a bit - but judging by how the beaters taste - it looks and tastes good!    First, I used a graham cracker ready crust.  I also halved the recipe - except for the sugar which I kept at 1/3 cup.  It filled the crust perfectly.  No issues with it being too runny - it was nice and thick!

This is awesome Cheesecake, light and tasty!  I used an extra package of cream cheese and froze the Cheesecake for a day before taking it out and letting it thaw in the fridge, maybe thatâ€™s why I had no trouble with it not setting up.  I used the Strawberry Supreme Topping from this site for the toppingâ€¦wowâ€¦ delicious.  I will definitely be making this again!

Per other reviews, I beat the cream by itself in a chilled bowl then folded into the cream cheese, plus I used an add'l 1/4 C sugar. Used an 11"x7" pyrex dish and decorated as a flag w/ fresh  strawberries & blueberries. Thought I'd need a layer of cool whip, but it was white enough for background as is.  Will make again next 4th of July.  Light and airy, but firm enough to keep its shape.

This does not taste like cheesecake nor do I find it particularly taste on its own. I had no problem with the texture- i did beat heavy cream seperately then add it into the cream cheese. 

This is basically a glorified frosting.

I use splenda instead of white sugar, well I actually used the Walmart brand (Altern). I usually don't like things really sweet, but this did need a little more sugar, around 2/3 cup rather than 1/3c. The texture is lighter than regular cheesecake, not so heavy. I topped it with blackberries (each cut in half). This was for our bible study and everyone loved it!

I think it's a keeper too.  The texture was smooth and the taste rich but I whipped the heavy cream separately (a lot) and then added it to the softened cream cheese and lemon juice mixture.  Before chilling it to set up it would have been thick enough to eat.  I also increased the sugar to 2/3 cup.  Adding jello would probably make the texture like typical cheescake but probably isn't necessary.  If you are looking for a strong taste, this is probably not for you.

Tried it and it was execellent... I followed the advice from others and added gelatine to the mixture, it made the cheesecake hold better. Though I didn't think anything was wrong in the amount of sugar( I think you're suppose to put 1/3 cup white sugar AND 1/3 cup brown sugar)... Definitely a keeper! :)

It sounds good, you can also use 1 in a half cups of cream cheeze and it comes out the same, also i make my own topping, in order to do that you take 1 1/2 cups of frozen or fresh fruit- of your choice, and half a cup of water, boil the fruit until it no longer has shape and its un-frozen, then you make yourself a roue, which is 2 tablespoons of cornstarch mixed with 2 tablespoons of water, add to the fruit mixture, and let the fruit mixture get more gooey

My family really enjoyed this recipe.  One thing I adjusted was, I added the left-over plain yogurt and used less of the cream cheese. It was so delicious that I made twice in the last 2 weeks already!  By the way, I didn't eat them with any topping as cheesecake itself had a lot of taste!  Thanks for the recipe!

i made this cheesecake last night and i can not wait for my family to try it! this is my first time making a no bake recipe and i thought it went very smoothly and quickly. i ended up adding another 1/3 cup of sugar and a splash of vanilla after i read through the other comments and tasted it myself. i think it really elevated the taste. i also ended up switching the cherry pie filling for raspberry pie because iâ€™m not a big fan of cherry. also, i got pre done gram cracker crust (9 inch) in chocolate flavor at the store and didnâ€™t even use all the filling so i made two and each was topped with a 12 oz can of filling. again, i cannot wait you try this new recipe. ????

One of my families favorites. I used heavy whipping cream and it thickened up just like it's supposed to. I'm wondering if the people that are having a problem with this aren't using heavy whipping cream. Maybe they are using something else and that's why it's not getting thick. I did add some lemon zest the second time I made it along with using three blocks of cream cheese because I wanted it to taste more cheesier. That's just a personal preference though. The original recipe is delicious and easy.

Made this but swapped the cream with cool whip dessert topping. Amazing!!!! My guests and husband said it was restaurant quality! I topped with strawberry pie filling.
I have mini cheesecakes with orange juice, orange zest and orange extract whipped into it. Delicious! Like an orange Creamsicle. Can add red + yellow food colouring to make it orange. Topping with mandarins once set. Also making mini blueberry pie filled topped cheesecakes :)

Absolutely the Best! I used 1/2 the lemon called for and made up for the quantity with vanilla. For beginners: watch when you whip the whipping cream ... just until fluffy because over doing the whipping will turn your whipping cream into a delicious butter...and unusable in this recipe. Many wonderful reviews on this cheesecake. It will be my go-to cheesecake from now on. For topping, we used huckleberry jam. So good!

Delicious! And I put mine in muffin tins with strawberry preserves on top and I had enough filling left so I just crumbled 6 graham crackers (so this one would be crunchy) in a 9 inch square pan, added filling on top then topped with the cherry pie filling so got two desserts out of this recipe. Love timesavers!

I made this into a sugar free cheesecake and it was very good. I did make a few adjustments, just personal preference, there is nothing wrong with the original recipe. I used 3 pkgs of cream cheese and added lemon zest as well as lemon juice. I used granulated sucralose instead of sugar and blueberry topping. I had no trouble with it thickening after I added the cream. I did not feel the need to whip them separately.  Thank you for this easy and tasty recipe.

The cheesecake needed a lot more sweetener.  With all that whipping cream, it tasted like a giant slice of butter, with a slight sweet aftertaste.

Super easy, creamy, and delicious. I love that you don't have to whip the cream separately. I've made a few no bakes in the past, and this one is the best. I also increase the sugar to 2/3 of a cup.  I never have problems with it setting; I whip with an electric hand mixer for about 3-4 minutes and it gets very thick.

Since my oven is not working I went looking for no bake desserts when I found this one. OK I admit it.  After reading some reviews I chickened out and used the whip topping instead of the whipping cream. Cream cheese is always easier to work with when it is at room temperature.  I beat the cream cheese quite awhile in the KA then folded in the topping by hand and had no issues with it setting up.  I used an 8" springform pan and it came out quite tall and very fluffy.  I didn't do the fruit topping for the test run but this does scream fresh strawberries to me.  I will be making this again.

I followed recipe with a few exceptions;  I added a few tablespoons more of sugar and lemon juice.  I think more lemon juice would bring out a bit more tartness.  Otherwise it is truly delicious.

This was my first time making a no-bake cheesecake and I will definitely make one again using this recipe. I used other reviewers' suggestions to double the sugar in the cheese and cream mixture, cut back on the lemon juice and add a couple teaspoons of vanilla.

Made this lastnight. I used 2/3 cup of sugar instead of 1/3 cup like some people suggested. I also put crushed Oreos in it. It was ok. It set up perfectly over night but just doesn't have much cheesecake flavor. Taste more like sweet whipped cream to me. I'll try a baked one next time. My son loved it tho ??

I made this exactly as written and had problems with it not getting stiff/thick.  I wish I had read the reviews first, but I was in a hurry:(   Next time I will add more sugar and try whipping the cream before adding it as some of the reviews suggested.  It was still good however, and extremely quick and easy compared to the baked styles.

Made this cake for the first time and I was happy with the result! I followed the recommendations to whip the cream separately and then fold it in the cream cheese mixture, and I think this really made it airy and fluffy. I didnâ€™t add any extra sugar since I donâ€™t really  have a sweet tooth. It came out delicious. I let it sit overnight in the fridge. However, since I live in a tropical area, the cherry topping were starting to drip over the minute it came out the fridge. Since I love this recipe and I donâ€™t want to add more cream cheese to hold itâ€™s shape, to prevent it from melting next time Iâ€™ll freeze it at least 15mins before serving. 
Also, I recommend putting parchment paper at the bottom of the pan you use to remove it from the pan for serving. Even though I used a pan where the side were removable, cutting from the bottom of the pan made it break apart easily (the crust). Next time I wonâ€™t use cherry pie filling either, because it was just a bit too running for me (again because of tropics). Iâ€™ll probably use fresh berries and make my own topping. Or maybe even add the topping when serving.

I'd love to rate this a 4.5 stars.  It's not quite as good as a baked but it IS quite delish for nobake.   I am handicapped and standing is difficult so I took some short cuts. Everyone seemed pretty pleased with the pie.   I followed a number of other reviewers suggestions: 
I whipped the Heavy Cream, with twice the sugar that the recipe calls for, until it peaked beautifully and set it aside. 
 I added a 3rd bar of room temp cream cheese and prepared the three and the lemon juice per instruction.  This provided enough filling to make two pies in standard store bought graham cracker crusts.  
I chilled the pies for a couple of hours before topping one with a can of unsweetened cherries.   By request, I'm making this again tonight.

Hard to review this one...  5 stars for taste, for sure.  5 stars for being easy.  But it really tastes nothing like a cheesecake.  Whatever it is, it's good but it's not cheesecake.  Also, if you're having a problem with it thickening or stiffening, substitute powered sugar for granulated sugar.

5 stars for flavor. 
Eye appeal?  Meh...about a three. 
This won't stop me from making it again. 
It never firmed u p really nicely. As soon as I removed the ring is began spreading out. The recipe called for an 8" to 10" pan so I used a 9" thinking right in the middle would be fine. 
I have an idea the spreading was caused by the fact I used lo-fat neuchaftel in place of full fat cream cheese.

Your search is over! This is the best no bake cheesecake recipe. Anyone complaining that they canâ€™t get the cream stiff is not using heavy whipping cream. Itâ€™s so easy to make my kids love to help. I do like to add extra lemon juice and a tsp of vanilla as others suggested. I also cut the sugar down to 1/4 Cup. Top it with fresh berries and itâ€™s the perfect summer dessert!

While this turned out to be a nice dessert, it was in no way cheese"cake" ... the filling set up like a cheesecake-flavored pudding, even after 5 hours in the fridge. It had good flavor and the crust was delicious, but very disappointing as a traditional cheesecake.

Followed recipe, ended up with cheesecake soup. Froze it for about 2 hours, then put it in the fridge overnight, woke up to it spilling off the plate, thank goodness I put a pan under underneath just in case. Not a good recipe.

I used others suggestions and whipped the cream first, added a little vanilla and then whipped the cream cheese seperately and 2/3 cup sugar and added the cream back in. topped it with homemade cherry pie filling from this site. very yummy! Will make again!

Very easy and very delicious! I will be making this again. 
Soon. 
I'm thinking an upside down version in 4 oz wide mouth mason jars would make for a fun dessert and easy to travel. I would put fruit on the bottom and then loosely put the Graham cracker base on top as you wouldn't be able to pack it down on the cheesecake mixture.

I made a couple of modifications to the original recipe. I used a ready baked crust (chocolate) rather than making the graham cracker crust and served my fruit topping (from fresh strawberries) on the side. I followed the recipe for the filling as written and, while it was good, it was a bit bland compared to other cheesecake recipes. It definitely needs the fruit to complement the filling. Be sure, as well, that your cream cheese mixture is blended thoroughly; I had a few chunks of cream cheese that did not blend well despite being at room temperature.

I didnâ€™t use the crust recipe, just melted chocolate and almonds, pressed into the pan and refrigerate.  I mixed everything together but the cream, I whipped the cream separately, and just before it started to form, whipped in the other ingredients.  It was very light and fluffy.  I am giving it 5 stars because although it wasnâ€™t really what I like, tasted like it was supposed to taste, the consistency was spot on, and the people who did like it raved and raved about it.

Everytime I make this, it never lasts long. I soften my cream cheese a bit and I also use cool whip instead of heavy cream. It makes it lighter and fluffier.

This is the BEST cheesecake recipe ever! The cheesecake came out perfect. The crust was delicious too. I doubled the ingredients for the crust so that I could put it into a 9 x 13 pan. I didn't need to double the cheesecake ingredients. It was the perfect!

Fantastic and so easy & quick to make! We are on our sailboat in the Bahamas and I was having company for dinner and wanted to make a no-bake cheesecake.  It was divine.  I didn't change anything on the recipe.  Used a store-bought graham cracker crust.  Didn't have electric mixed on board, but my potato masher worked just find and also had a whisk to beat the whipping cream mixture with. This is great for family or friends!  Served it with decaffinated coffee with cream and a liquer in the coffee for dessert.

This was my first time making a cheesecake. This recipe  is so easy and delicious! I allowed the cream cheese to soften and added a couple of teaspoons of real lemon juice. I used a chilled bowl to whip the heavy cream. Then, I added the cream cheese to the cream and added a tsp of vanilla. It whipped up nicely and was so creamy. I used frozen cherries  from our cherry tree this past summer, to make the sauce. It was the best  tasting cheesecake!

I honestly think i like this one better than the baked version!  I did double the sugar to 2/3 cup and i lightly whisked the whipping cream before adding it in, enough to just get some nice airy bubbles in it.  I made this for a 2nd Christmas desert, and for the first attempt at it, it turned out perfect!  Definitely will be making this more often!

I made this amazing cheesecake, but I changed some ingredients... I added 2 table spoons of lemon zest to the filling. And I used ready and whipped cream...I used confectionery sugar instead of white sugar. It was light, fluffy and creamy, yet firm and consistent :)

This was a great dessert but I should have stuck with the recipe. Some reviewers suggesting adding more cream cheese which just made it overkill with cream cheese. The vanilla is a nice touch to add. This comes out really nice looking and elegant with the topping. Stick with the actual recipe but whip the cream separately and fold it in like other viewers suggested. That works perfectly. Yummy.

I made small changes the second time but the first  one came it great.  The secret is leave it more than over night. We found second day was perfect both taste and texture. But texture was great from start.
The second time I did add a tsp of vanilla and was awesome.

You have to add 1/3 to 1/2 cup of lemon juice to make the pie thicken. It's acidic and reacts with the condensed sweet milk. Plus it also helps kick back the super sweetness of condensed milk also. I make this all the time never have had my pie not set up. I also add a tiny bit of vanilla.

Delicious! A family favorite. My kid's always want me to make this for their birthday instead of cake. It's so easy to make as well. Thank you!

Beautiful, fluffy and easy. We did add vanilla. We did not put any topping on. Not very flavourful but everyone still loved it.

This recipe is absolutely amazing! I added a little bit of pumpkin pie spice to the crust for a more complex, spicy flavor. I didn't add as much lemon juice, just one squeeze from the bottle. Don't forget vanilla extract! A splash is good. Also, if you want an airier cheesecake, whip the cream first, then fold it into the cream cheese mixture. I've made this recipe tons of times, and it is foolproof. I promise.

It tasted delicious although the heavy whipping cream did not stiffen so the cake was very liquidy. I also added 2/3 c of sugar instead of 1/3 c, and melted chocolate into the batter. I would definitely make again- but with sweetened condensed milk instead of heavy whipping cream.

Followed the recipe and like a lot of you it did not firm up. I put it in the freezer and it firmed up after a 20 min thaw  it was good but the crust was still semi Frozen. I'm going to make this again but I'm going to use 3 packs of cream cheese half of the cream, I'm going to mix the sugar and cream cheese together then I'm going to fold it into whipped cream, no lemon add vanilla. I'll let you know

I did and follow every ingredients that's written on this recipe, yet I still failed to make the cream cheese thick and stiff. I always get it getting like heavy liquid creamer more than stiff and thick cream. I thought maybe because I keep changing the speed of my mixture from low to high speed and back to low speed. In addition, so far after days (maybe 2days) it finally become cheesecake, even tough still can't use fork to eat it, the cheesecake that I made still eatable and still delish.

I usually bake cheesecakes but I didn't have much time on my hands, I was worried that the flavor wouldn't live up to that of a baked one but I was delightfully surprised, this was wonderful. I did add an extra 1/3 cup of sugar as some reviews suggested. I also drizzled caramel and chocolate and topped it with pecans for a turtle cheesecake :)

Made this for my daughter's birthday. It turned out great!  I did increase the sugar, as suggested in the reviews. I also baked the crust for 8 minutes at 425 degrees, then cooled it before filling.

Really easy and super fast for that last minute desert! Make sure the whipped cream is really cold, like straight from the freezer. It doesn't tastes as much like a regular cheesecake as I might have like, you can really pick out the whipped cream, but it was very good all the same. I layered mine with graham crackers and rhubarb compote in a mason jar for individual cheesecakes and it worked great. I'll keep this recipe on standby.

I followed this recipe to a T and for some reason it did not thicken up. The flavors of the cheesecake was good however the minute I removed the springform pan the cake fell. Very embarrassing!! I'm on the fence if I will make this again.

This cake has very good flavor, but like others on here, I couldn't get this to set up. I didn't add the topping,  right away,  I had to freeze it to get it to set, and serve it right away. Will try another recipe next time.

It was a great hit with my family and friends. I didn't need to adjust the sugar because it was already sweet with the cherry toppings. But I took some other reviewers suggestion and mixed the heavy whipped cream separately but I did it with 2tbsp of powdered sugar into it. And 1TBSP of Vanilla extract to the filling. Next time I'll  count down on the sugar.

I made it according to the recipe and it ended up looking fine but when I took it out of the spring form pan, and cut into it, it was very soft. I had to use a spoon and it didn't hold its shape at all but ended up as a blob on the plate. Also, too sweet for my taste. will not be making it again.

Amazing! Can't imagine why any one would not like this recipe or find it easy to follow. I am really not a good cook, but I served this for a group dinner and everyone raved about. Absolutely melts in your mouth. I did add the extra sugar (actually used splenda) and whipped the cream separately as someone suggested and it had wonderful texture and held together perfectly. Great for my diabetic husband who loved it.  Will be making this a lot!

It was my first time making no bake cheesecake and this was really simple. The only changes I made was more lemon juice, lemon zest, bit more sugar, chocolate chips and put it over brownies instead of the graham cracker crust. Just baked the brownies in the springform and let them cool. Then put the cheesecake mix on top to chill. Very tasty. ??

A keeper, and with no eggs. I used 3/4th of the whipping cream, and used 2/3 c sugar (beat into cream cheese) for the filling. I baked the graham crust at 350 degree F for 8 min to keep from crumbling. I also accidentally left out the lemon juice and it was still great. Let it set for 24 hrs and it was perfectly set. Only thing I might change is to double the filling, or increase by half.

I've not even made it I would just like to say.  There is a huge difference between whipping cream (what this calls for)  and "whip" or "whipped" cream.  Two completely different animals. Whipping is an ingredient whipped is a topping. Could be why people are having trouble with it setting up

I am not a fan of no bake cheesecake but I think this is the best one I have had.  I think others have cool whip in it and you can taste it.  I had no trouble getting it thick enough.  It was a nice light summer dessert and easy to put together. The only thing I would do different is put it in the freezer for a while to set.

I altered this a bit, used chocolate cookies crushed with 2 tablespoons of sugar and butter for the crust. For the filling I used only 1/2 teaspoon of lemon juice and 1 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla. Added a thin layer of fresh cherry filling on the bottom, added the filling and chilled about an hour. Added cherry filling on top with thin lines of chocolate syrup, chilled again for 2 hours. Lady friend said it was sinful and had me make one for her to take to work.

I think 1/3 cup sugar is too little for this recipe so I double it, then taste, then adjust to my personal taste.  I also don't put quite so much brown sugar into the crust.  All this is infinitely adjustable, I think.  I also whip the cream separately in a chilled bowl and then fold into the cream cheese mixture.  It sets up in a few hours and has a wonderful, soft consistency.  Very happy with the results.  I use this recipe as a guide and adjust as I feel like it.

It's a great and easy recipe! I used a smaller 6" springform pan though and I added a little more cinnamon to the crust. Since I didn't get any brown sugar in small quantities, I substituted it with regular sugar. Turned out great.

This recipe yields a huge amt of filling. I tripled the amount of sugar. That makes it a hint of sweet, it will not be overly sweet. It seems ridiculous but about 3/4 cup of sugar was perfect. Follow the other reviewers' advice, do your room temp cream cheese, sugar, vanilla, lemon FIRST, set it aside, then stiff peak your whipping cream and gently mix the two.

I made this recipe as is the flavor was okay but the cream cheese texture was off it never got stiff and I was not able to cut it. Next time I'll try it with powdered sugar and whip the whipping cream before adding it to the cream cheese.

Love this recipe, I follow the original almost exactly. The only changes I make are to double the sugar and add just a bit of vanilla. I do NOT mix the whipped cream separately from the cream cheese, not at all necessary! It will thicken just fine and I've made this several times. This is always a huge hit at potlucks and with the family. This is a heavenly, creamy cheesecake with a lot less work required than a baked one. Try it! Oh yes, and make sure to freeze before serving, it will thaw quickly once out.

Made this for the first time 2 days ago and it was wonderful!!! I did make 2 small changes.... I added vanilla extract as other reviewers suggested and used strawberry topping on top instead of cherry. The texture is wonderfully smooth and delicious! So easy to make, will be making this again & again. Thank u for the great recipe!!

This was fantastic and easy, and I'd never made a cheesecake in my life. I did add a couple teaspoons of vanilla and upped the sugar a little from 1/3 cup to 1/2 cup, tasting as I went, and it was still lightly sweetened. I made another for a friend, mixing in some purÃ©ed bananas. The banana one was great, too, topped with fresh bananas, pecans, and a little caramel sauce.

My mom and I loved this recipe so much she wants me to make one again. I have to say, I had five slices of this cake in a single day.. definitely gonna make this again and again!

I'm not a fan of cheesecake and had never made one myself. I was nervous to try the baked type since it was for my 18yr old's birthday, so I went with this recipe. I used a round cake pan since I didn't have a spring form pan, and only ended up using about 3/4 of the graham cracker crust. For the filling, I added 2/3 c sugar per comments, and rather than whipping cream I folded in a container of cool whip after the cream cheese, sugar, and lemon juice were incorporated. At the last minute I decided to fold half a can of cherry pie filling into the cream cheese mixture and let it set up like that, serving the rest on the side for those who wanted more cherries on top. It was still pretty soft when I served it but we put it in the freezer and will probably just take it out 10 minutes before serving the next time. The boys loved it!

Taste was okay except that it just cannot hold its shape... more like melting ice cream.  Maybe I should freeze it as suggested.

My oven crashed and I received a special request for cheesecake from my nephew.  THIS RECIPES IS AWESOME!  I took suggestions from a few reveiwers. Definetely whip the HEAVY whipping cream first in separate bowl and add to the cream cheese mixture when suggested.  Make sure you purchase the heavy whipping cream.  Add one to two teaspoons of vanilla and double the sugar.  The recipe will be stiff enough.  I did place in the freezer for a half hour.  If you add cherries on top don't use alot.  I will have the cherries available on the side as suggested. Add a few for garnish. This recipe is light and fluffy and can not sit out it must be refrigerated.  

Enjoy

Tired of the baked cheesecakes that almost always crack? This is much better! Easy to make, not too sweet or dense. You can add any toppings you'd like.

It's like a pile of whipped cream on a base of sugar. Easy to make and looks nice, but otherwise pretty disappointing. Might try this again with no added sugar to base and change the ratio of cream cheese and cream.

I tried this recipe, it was not thick enough, I tried saving the batter by adding a table spoon of flower *silly me* and I think it's because I used an electric stand mixer, or our tin of whipping cream is bigger than the one used in this recipe, or I'm a really bad baker. but I think the recipe needs some modifications witch is not my skill so.....

This is the best no bake cheesecake I have ever made. It's easy little mess and the taste is to die for.
People who change the recipe should not leave reviews, as you are leaving a review for this cake not one you adapted. Have given this recipe out to many friends. Love it.

Used oreo crumbs for base (directions on box). Omitted lemon juice & also used low-fat cream cheese. Whip cream separate!!! (I only used about 2/3 of it) Added half of the cream cheese mixture to crust. Let cool. Then add most of some melted semi-sweet chocolate (about 4 ozs), sprinkled in blobs. Then add rest of cream cheese, smooth, & use a knife to swirl. Used fresh strawberries to cover top of cake, and drizzled remaining chocolate over them. My guests said this was the best cheese cake they'd every tried. Thank you!

This is so good! It firmed up nicely for me. I was craving cheesecake and didn't have the patience for my usual one, so I just put it in a bowl and ate it. It hit the spot. Just one thing, it definitely needs some sort of topping or mix in, otherwise it tastes too cream cheese-y. I tried different things, and found my favorite was chocolate chips mixed in, and then some chocolate syrup on top. Yum!

It was very easy to make, but I don't think I'd bother again.  It tasted like cream cheese with a little sweetening in it.  Very bland, no tartness and I even threw in a little extra lemon juice.
I did not put the pie filling on top, because I don't like that type of thing.

LOVE THIS RECIPE!!!!  
Quickie substitution - store bought graham crust...
Low carb / diabetic substitution - Splenda instead of white sugar
Fresh fruit instead of pie filling on top...

This was ready in no time and sooooooo much better than the "cooked" version I made previously!!!

I followed the recipe exactly. Make sure to beat the cream cheese till smooth, to avoid lumps. I had previously made a homemade carmel topping and canned my own apple pie filling. Once I poured the batter in the crust, I spread the carmel topping on top then spread the apple pie filling on top...hence a carmel apple cheesecake. It was good!

I made this for New Year's.
We wanted a very light Cheesecake, and this was amazingly delicious and light.  
First, a sleeve of graham crackers is no longer enough for a cheesecake pan (downsized packages!) so I added a handful of pecans to the graham crackers when I ran them through the food processor.  Wonderful, nutty addition without taking over the recipe with pecan flavor.  
I followed the advice of others and used 2/3 cup sugar in the batter.  I started by gently warming the cream cheese and then hand mixing it with the sugar and I used only 1 T of lemon juice and 2 T of vanilla bean crush extract.  
Then, I whipped the cream in my mixer with 2 T. of whipping cream stabilizer (kingarthur flour has it).  This helps thicken the whipping cream a little and then I added in the cream cheese mixture.  
I layered half the batter on top of the crust, then drizzled on a slightly warm chocolate ganache, then the other half of the batter, then more ganache drizzled on top.  
Perfection!  Light and rich, but not overpoweringly rich.
This is our new "go to" cheesecake recipe, for absolute certain.
Thanks, Debbie!

I tried this recipe and oh my gosh... So yummy!!! I made a few adjustments with the crust by adding grounded cashew nuts and increasing butter to 1/2 cup... Turned out to be the best cheesecake I have ever made!!! Yehey!!!

Just made this with 2 packages of neufchÃ¢tel (1/3 less fat) cream cheese and a few splashes of vanilla extract because I'm out of lemon juice.  Used a hand mixer for just a few minutes.  Thickened up great and formed while I was smoothing into the pre-made shortbread pie crust!  Going to put melted cherry real fruit pops on top - don't tell anyone :)

This was an easy recipe to follow.  This recipe calls for whipping cream, not to be confused with whip cream.   I did take the advice of another reviewer and put an extra 1/3 cup of white sugar.

I have never seen a cheesecake recipes that didn't call for at least 1tsp of vanilla.  I made it as the recipe stated but it just tasted like very slightly sweetened cream cheese. 1/3 cup of sugar is not enough to sweeten the cream cheese and whipping cream. I ended up scooping out the crusts and adding more sugar and the vanilla.

Delicious. I used 3 pkgs of cream cheese though, and added a pkg of gelatin (highly recommend this tip from another reviewer) to hold it together.  It was devoured.

Good basic recipe, but definitely needs some modifications.  Here's how I got it to turn out perfect...I only used 1/2 pint of the heavy whipping cream, and then added 2 cups of cool whip.  Used 1/2 cup of sugar total, plus 1 tsp of vanilla extract, and an extra squeeze of lemon juice. Poured mixture into the cooled crust, let refrigerate for 6 hours, and then drizzled homemade raspberry sauce on top...AWESOME!!!

COMPLIMENTS! This is the very best no bake cheese cake I have EVER made. Not just I, but everyone at my large dinner party could not stop raving. It is now number one on my list for perfect treats. Thank you chef! The photo does not do it justice. I put cherry filling on top and it looked divine!

The absolutely best "no bake" cheesecake recipe EVER. I will never step foot into another Cheesecake Factory again. All it takes is a little tweaking of the recipe and you can turn this into any flavor or style you'd like. It is amazing! It's also so very quick and easy. Literally took me less than 15 minutes, including the gathering of ingredients. You can't go wrong with this cheesecake recipe. I added an extra teaspoon of "fresh" lemon juice and substituted 2/3 cups of sugar. It is divine.

Great cheese cake, but really needs the pie filling on top to sweet each bite or its too cheesy.  I wouldn't at all suggest just having it as a toppingless cheese cake like the picture. Also, it's pretty light and as other reviewers have mentioned, it doesn't stand up when the springform pan is removed. Better in a dish.

I made this today.  I agree it needs more sugar.  I mixed the cream cheese when it was just softened enough to mix with the sugar, lemon and I added one 1 tsp vanilla.  I tasted as I went and added extra sugar to taste.  I also added a little sugar to the heavy whipping cream and whipped it in my stand mixer.  I chilled the bowl and whipping attachment so they were nice and cold when I whipped it.  Also, make sure to use real whipping cream, not half and half.  And shake the cream good before you start whipping it.  Then, don't stir the whipping cream in with the cream cheese mixture but fold it in.  My cheesecake was firm enough to serve right away without allowing any set up time. Of course, the longer it sets the better the flavor.

My mom has made this recipe for Thanksgiving and Christmas EVERY year and it is AMAZING!!! I always lick the bowl even though I'm a grown woman. I'm thinking about making this recipe in my kitchen this year just to see if I can measure up to the wonderfulness of this recipe. Thank you for creating this because without it, my family wouldn't be able to enjoy this lovely cheesecake!!!

Great recipe. I added a teaspoon of vanilla to the completed mix after tasting it first.  I also beat the whipping cream first to make sure it whipped properly and the rest was a breeze. All I had was chocolate crumbs and the  sugar stood out so I baked it for a few minutes. Thank you for sharing the recipe, Debbie!

I covered it with fresh blackberries and it was simply wonderful, I also cut back the sugar a little. Easy recipe to follow. I'm very unsure why others didn't work out mine was a huge hit and so fresh and light!

It was pretty good, but not fabulous.  I didn't put any topping on it, so maybe that would have made it even better.  I also left out the lemon and added key lime juice.  I love stuff tart.  I think I should have put more in though.  As for the texture, it was perfect.  Just how a no bake cheesecake should be.  Over all, it was what I was looking for so I'm happy :)

Wonderful!  The cream made it so light and yummy.  I used a 10" springform, and the crust came out a little thick, might use less next time.  Also, thought the cake could have used a bit more sugar, tasted more salty than sweet.  Also used the Supreme Strawberry Topping on here and tripled it to cover the entire cake (look for my review on that page).

This is an extremely easy cheese cake to make.  I like my cheese cake a little sweeter so I increased the granulated sugar to 2/3 cup.  I also like a bit more cream cheese taste.  I think he next time I make it I will add another 8 oz pkg of cream cheese.  I may need to increase the sugar to one cup.  then use a 10 inch graham cracker crust, if not using a springform pan.

this was a very nice and easy cake. For the base, I used a chocolate cookie recipe that I have, which I made in the shape of the bottom of the pan and then baked, then put the cheese cake on top. I added banana slices to the cake. It was tasty but very very rich and sweet! Next time I'll try to tone it down a bit somehow. Thanks!

Excellent recipe, very easy to make.  I made my own strawberry glaze to put on top and it was delicious.

Tastes good, but doesn't firm up well at all. More like a creamy cheese pie.
