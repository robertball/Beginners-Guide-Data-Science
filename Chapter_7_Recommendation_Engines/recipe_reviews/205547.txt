I cut this down to four servings for the Actually Delicious Turkey Burgers, which is also from this site. I cut back the salt to just a pinch as we're trying to cut back quite a bit on excess salt. Great hamburger seasoning. Wait, TURKEY burger seasoning. I'll use this often. (Oh! I also used Splenda Brown Sugar Blend instead of plain brown sugar.) EDITED: I use this now as my basic go-to grill seasoning. Works great for us.

I mixed 2 t. of the seasoning into 1 lb. of hamburger before making into patties.  When cooking I sprinkled each patty with the seasoning. I plan on using on other meats too.

This is great for grilled hamburgers!  I usually just use a bit of Montreal Steak seasoning, but I was looking for something different and this was perfect.  I cut the recipe in half for just over a lb. of hamburger. I cut back a little on the paprika, but other than that followed it exactly. The burgers had a very nice flavor. This is a definite keeper and I'll be making some up and keeping it in a little jar to have on hand for grilling over the summer months. For a different twist, try using smoked paprika vs regular...

Wow!  I think this was the best hamburger I've ever had!  I know lots of things come into play when making a good hamburger.  I used Costco's organic ground beef (85/15) and added 2 teaspoons of seasoning per pound (, as other reviewers recommended.  I'm not sure why Stacey did not include information in the orginial recipe, considering this is a critical piece of information.  "Season to taste" is hardly an option!  Anyway, I used a hamburger patty press to create 6 oz. patties.  We grilled these on a propane grill.  We would normally use a charcoal grill but since we were cooking for a large crowd, it wasn't an option.  Everyone snached these up fast.  Even the kids!  Thanks Stacey!

I make this up in bulk (64 servings!)and keep in an airtight jar.  It's great for most dishes that call for ground beef or ground turkey.  I've used it as a starter mix for chili, meat loaf, and meat+ casseroles. About 2 tsps per lb of ground meat is usually about right for me.

WOW! This was soooo yummy! I never knew a few spices could change a hamburger so much! I have never been very good at hamburgers, but I am NOW! If you are worried about the cayenne pepper and black pepper making it spicy, don't worry, it's not. SO tasty!!!!!!!

I have been eating hamburgers for over 40 years so that right there makes me an expert right? Seriously this seasoning recipe is the bomb! I have never used anything before except maybe garlic powder and salt and that just made it taste like garlic podwer and salt. This is the perfect mix for some reason. Every bite was incredible. I made the recipe here without any changes. I made the burgers three times using this mix. The first time they were good but the next time I used more on each burger and they were really good. Tonight I put a lot more on the burgers and wiped it all over with my fingers so every part was covered. They were finally great! Now I know I need to be liberal with how much to put on and the burgers will blow you away. I liken the taste to Longhorn's bacon cheddar burgers. They use something called Prairie Dust on their burgers and some of their steaks. Thank you for this recipe.

I was looking for a change to my hamburger recipe.  I only made 4 patties out of the mixture, in case we didn't like them.  Needless to say, my husband and I didn't care for this recipe -- and my husband eats beef cooked in any way, shape, or form! I ended up mixing the rest of the mixture with more hamburgar and ingredients from my own recipe -- they were so much tastier.  Based on the reviews, I really wanted to like these.  Sorry Stacey:-(

Wow seasoning was amazing. I did add extra garlic and onion powder and it was superb. I broiled these and added swiss cheese during the last 5 minutes. A keeper for sure, thanks so much.

IT WAS A GREAT CHANGE TO OUR HAMBURGERS.  THE ONLY CHANGES I MADE WAS DECREASE SALT TO 1 teaspoon AND INCREASED THE BROWN SUGAR TO 1 3/4 teaspoons.  I USED 1 3/4 teaspoons of this seasoning, WHICH I MIXED INTO 1 POUND OF GROUND BEEF; THEN MADE INTO 4 HAMBURGERS. COOKED IN MY GEORGE FOREMAN GRILL.  I WILL BE MAKING IT UP AGAIN!  THANKS FOR SHARING:)

I made this for a Sunday afternoon hamburger BBQ. It was good but I did not use enough for my taste, it was also a bit mild by my standards (jalapeño peppers are a bit mild for my taste). This was just right for my wife and son. Next time I will add more or punch up my serving with some habanero or other pepper.

This seasoning is great! I didn't just use it in my hamburger (which was why I made a batch of it in the first place) but I added it to all sorts of things I was cooking: meatloaf, stew, even in vegetables such as corn! My husband raved about the corn! I DID just add a pinch of cayenne instead of 1/4 tsp since my daughter does not like anything spicy, and she liked this as well!

Oh WOW! I didn't actually use this on hamburgers, but on little chuck tenders. I reduced to 4 servings, mixed it up and put on a little plate, then pressed each side into the mixture before cooking on a stovetop grill pan to rare. Probably ate about 4 times what I would've if I'd just sprinkled it on a patty, but oh MAMA was that tasty! What a delicious, little bit spicy/lot of flavor way to make beef taste special. Definitely using again!

I doubled the garlic and onion powders - and I used SMOKED paprika.  I liberally added the seasoning into the hamburger, and also sprinkled liberally as they were cooking on the pan. Oh my gosh, the burgers were AWESOME.  I could see this seasoning working well with blue cheese as well.

Great taste without being overpowering. It was nice that everything was on hand and easy to put together. I mixed it into our hamburger patties and after formed sprinkled just a bit more on the top before rubbing just a touch of oil onto the burgers. Very good!

Since we have kids, I reduced the black and cayenne peppers. I also added finely minced onion to the burgers. I used 2 tsp per pound of ground beef as someone else suggested. Our burgers were excellent, and I can't wait to use this seasoning again.

Stacey, Stacey! How did you come up with this seasoning? it was delicious to me and my family. I Googled burger seasoning and your recipe stood out first. It was because All Recipes is my go to site, but I never thought someone would actually have a seasoning recipe here. I was anxious to try it due to great reviews. 

Let me tell everyone that reads my review it was very good! If you are the type of person that loves strong taste and salty food, this isn't the recipe for you. It is a subtle flavor and the brown sugar sneaks up on you just as you are about to swallow…Yummy!  I must say I didn't have any onion powder on hand and I didn't want to use the salt. I left the salt out, because my family and I are health conscience. Surprisingly my family and I did not miss the salt at all. It was great the way it was. 

I used this recipe for seasoning on ground turkey. If you eat ground turkey, you'll know it can have a tendency to taste bland. This seasoning will be used all of the time. Before I found this recipe I used Lipton onion soup mix, which is too salty. Stacey, thank you for sharing this recipe.

This was fantastic. Added 2 t. of seasoning to 1 lb. of ground beef. Mixed well and let sit in the fridge for 30 minutes. Made into four 1/4 lb. patties and sprinkled more seasoning on the top before cooking on the GF grill.

I rarely eat burgers but acquired some humane, grass-fed beef at a farmer's market a couple of days ago. Organic, non-lot beef is less fatty so can be less flavorful than the majority of the mass-produced beef out there. The addition of Stacey's seasoning, plus a bit of steak sauce, yielded the BEST burger in memory. My partner said so (with a mouth full of delicious beef) and I immediately agreed. Our 17mo is often suspicious of new foods so we fed him earlier and I offered him a bite of my burger - he ate 5 bites! Thank you, Stacey. We will be using this spice mix in the future :-)

I mixed this up and made hamburgers with it on New Years Eve... they were fabulous.  I used 2 tsp per pound of ground meat, and the burgers tasted incredible.  Not only will I use this again, I plan on keeping some of it on hand...

Made this for memorial day burgers and it was great! Very savory and tangy. I also added some of my other favorite seasoning and the combo was great. Grilled the burgers and put avocado and pineapple slices with the rest of trimmings (swiss cheese, lettuce, tomatoes, mustard, etc) and it really hit the spot!

I used 1 tsp Sea salt instead of 1 1/4 regular, 1 tsp brown sugar instead of 1/2 tsp , and 1 tsp garlic powder instead of 1/2 tsp. I mixed it as directed and then added it all to a mixture of 1 lb extra lean ground beef and 1 lb lean ground turkey along with some A-1 sauce. This was excellent! Thank you

I added half of a small onion that I diced really small.  I added them all to the meat and formed patties which we cooked out on the grill.  DELICIOUS.  i am not an onion fan but my family loves them so I chopped them up super super small.  I could taste them and it was amazing but didn't have the texture that I dislike with onion.  These were probably the best burgers I have have ever had.  Not sure what in the seasoning stood out but I will defnitely be making this many times this summer.

This is now my only seasoning I use in Hamburgers!  I cut the paprika down and increased the brown sugar, added granulated onion and garlic.  My whole family LOVED this seasoning.  I tried it on a whole chicken I roasted in the oven and it was wonderful!  I now am making this seasoning in bulk so I have plenty on hand for other meats, stews, and meatloaf!

Did not have and didn't reallly want to use cayenne pepper for this, so I just doubled the brown sugar in the recipe.  I used the entire recipe mixed into about 4 pounds of hamburger meat along with 3 eggs to hold it all together.  I had made the burgers a bit thicker and bigger than normal and my husband commented on how good they were despite being so thick.  This recipe was great.

I'll never make a bland burger again. I would cut back on the salt by a 1/4 tsp next time, it was a touch too salty.

Quick to toss together, but needs more flavour. I halved the recipe and the amount was just right for the amount of meat I was using. I also reduced the paprika a bit as it seemed a little excessive. I think increasing garlic powder and brown sugar would help, but it needs a little bit of green (herbs!). If you want that smoke-y  backyard bbq taste, add a bit of liquid smoke.

All I can say is WOW! I love this mix of seasoning. It really gave the hamburgers a great taste. I just tried it a few mins ago and I can say I'm going to keep it on hand like salt and pepper.

I created this recipe after being tired for tasteless burgers.  I triple the seasoning when I make it and sometimes add a bit more brown sugar to the recipe.  The brown sugar caramelizes when you sear the hamburgers.  Yummy!

Great!  I needed something simple but flavorful and this surely fit the bill. Will be doing it regularly.  You do have to experiment as to how much you want per patty. I simply rubbed the mixture on each side. Three patties with probably two patties more to spare. Just make a bunch and keep it in your cabinet.

Great on burgers. The only thing I did not do was use the brown sugar. I don't like sweat meat, but I also added fresh onion and bell pepper and celery to the hamburger as well. This will make great turkey burgers too. 4 stars because I change the recipe to my taste and I didn't use your instructions. But I'm sure your is very good. Thanks for sharing I'll be using it more often.

Good way to spice up a burger - it had a nice kick! We mixed the 5 servings for 1.40lbs of lean turkey, which made 4 burgers. We also added 1 egg to the mix because we didn't want the lean meat to be dry. Turned out moist and yummy. Sprinkled the last 3 servings on top of the burgers. Cooked on the grill to perfection. Would use again, thanks!

Scaled to 4 servings. But only added a pinch of sea salt. Made chicken burgers with this....1lb extra lean ground chicken breast, 1 small onion an 2 cloves garlic minced (sweated this out in a lil evoo), bout 1/4c grated parm, and some panko crumbs to bind. Really good and flavorful. Thanks!

This was pretty good. I followed the recipe and added 4 tsp to a pound of ground beef then I sprinkled a little more on as it was grilling. I also added finely chopped green onions from the freezer. I think I might try reducing the paprika or adding a little of something. To me it was just a little off, good but not great.

Thank you STACY!!!!!  This was great.  I seasoned 2 pounds of beef and added this in.  I made 10 burgers.  It was the best.  Love a spicy kick, but it wasn't overkill spicy either.  it almost tasted grilled. What a great yet simple way to improve the typical burger!

Love this mix. I've made it many times. I use half the recipe for 1lb meat. I used w/beef or turkey. I have used regular and smoked paprika. Also I use only 1tsp salt. Super flavorful, low sugar and salt. Thanks for sharing this recipe!

I really love this seasoning. I swear I now prefer my own homemade hamburgers than to pay $5 for a burger at a restaurant that has no flavor in the meat at all in comparison. I like to make a container of it and scoop out 2 tablespoons anytime I want to season another pound of hamburger meat.

I followed directions exactly with  making the blend. I did however mix the seasoning into the meat while I was forming the hamburger patties as I usually do. This spice mix gave the meat a good flavor. I plan on using again. Thank you for the receipt.

This recipe is great.  I didn't have any Cayenne Pepper but I added 1/4 cup of Worcester sauce.  I mixed in 2 lbs of ground beef and it was great.  I plan to make some more and using on different meats to see how it tastes.

Excellent & I hope to use it on non-meat items as well. Individual preferences aside, I HIGHLY recommend using smoked paprika. Just cut the amount by at least half as it is more potent than regular paprika.

Tried this recipe today. Best hamburger I have ever had. I made some changes as I didn't have any brown sugar on hand. I substituted the brown sugar with sugar in the raw. I also got out my Ninga blender and chopped 1/2 green pepper and 1/2 red pepper. I sauted the peppers in 1 tablespoon of olive oil briefly, drained the liquid and added the peppers to the hamburg along with 2 teaspoons of the seasoning mix. Much to my surprise, the burgers came out perfect. Will never eat a plain burger again.

I have entered the realm of a low-sodium diet and this blend (minus the salt) was a terrific seasoning for hamburger.  I grilled the burgers and the flavor was as good or better than the days when I added a packet of onion soup mix!

This is a great hamburger seasoning. It adds just enough spice to add flavor to a burger without being to overpowering. Make extra to have on hand. I will try in meatloaf using this seasoning in it too. Excellent

This makes burgers delicious! We like our food REALLY flavorful so I used 1 tsp of each of these ingredients and added 2/3 of the mix to 2 lb of hamburger meat, also with some Worcestershire. I used the other 1/3 of seasoning mix to sprinkle on top of the patties before grilling. SO GOOD!

I added these ingredients to a package of ground beef that was a little over a pound. I just guessed how much of everything and added to my liking. The burgers were a hit, even with my picky three year old.

This is the best seasoning for anything with ground beef! I use it in hamburgers, meatloaf, and meatballs.

I got tired of boring, tasteless premade patties (got from Omaha Steaks,) so I tried this.  I did make a teensy tweek.  Instead of just Salt, I used Garlic Salt, and instead of just Paprika, I used Spanish Paprika.  Omg!!!  I will be adding this to my spices.  Aaaaaamazing!!!!  The heat is not obnoxious, so even my teen who is sensitive to spicy loves this.  It's perfect for the tender tongue that wants to have a little culinary adventure to "spice" up their life.  If you do want to torch your tastebuds, then definitely add more cayenne pepper.

Loved it!!! I use it all the time for my burgers now. I leave out the cayenne pepper because my family doesn’t care for spicy food. Recommended it to other family members as well.

I wanted to find something simple that added a good burst of flavor to hamburgers. This was easy to put together using spices that I always have around in my kitchen and it was delicious! The brown sugar was a surprisingly pleasant ingredient.

I was looking for a spice blend to perk up our hamburgers and this was absolutely on point!!! I reduced the salt a little and used grass-fed beef and grilled the burgers by basting them in garlic butter. My husband declared that these burgers were the best he's ever had from our grill and we've been married 35 years!

I appreciate that this recipe confirms my natural instinct to combine garlic powder, onion powder, paprika, salt, and pepper as seasonings for most of my grilling projects. I wasn’t sure that I was doing things right until I came across this recipe. The problem I had was not being able to figure out good proportions for each ingredient. Thanks to Stacey for giving me a good base from which to start. I’m doing a Leto-inspired diet right now, so I leave out the brown sugar. I also use smoked paprika instead of regular. I also double this recipe and put it into a container for later use. Missing this into ground beef prior to making patties (about 2 teaspoons per pound) yields extremely delicious burgers.

My family loves the flavor of this mixture but we have found that it takes quite a bit to actually be able to taste it. Usually put about 2.5 teaspoons per pound place sprinkle across the top of burgers. I have also started adding about 1 teaspoon of dried basil to the mixture

I've used this recipe for several years. This is the exact same recipe on the copycat site for Fuddruckers hamburgers. It's a good basic recipe. 
I changed it up to the way our family likes it and we use it consistently.

This was delicious. We sprinkled on top and bottom, using about half, and cooked turkey burgers with a little oil in a cast iron skillet. Only small change was to double garlic and onion to taste. But I think it would have still been great with no changes (we just love those spices). Thanks for sharing!

Instead of using hamburger I used pork ribs.  I substituted my own dry rub  and bbq sauce for the soy and pickles for Worcestershire.  It was great.  Thanks Stacey.  

Not far from what some of you psycho's post.

This is soooo good! I make it for my family and we put it on burgers, pork chops, steak, and more!! I put less cayenne pepper in it because they don’t like spicy food. It’s really good and I recommend it for anything and everything!

i just sprinkle it on burgers and steaks when I make them. I have been using this recipe for 2 yrs now. I double the garlic powder because I love garlic. Gives great flavor to meat!!

The family loves it and says it's a keeper "as written."  Next time though, I will decrease the black pepper to about 1/2 tsp only because to me that one flavor stood out from the rest and I'm not overly fond of it; just my own preference. I mixed about 1 tsp seasoning mix into 1/2 lb. of ground sirloin prior to pan frying in a T of unsalted butter, then had some of the mix on the table for each to add to taste. It was surprising how much more flavor just that little bit added. Thanks for a super recipe Stacey!

We liked it. I didn’t add too much heat since my kids were eating. My picky 6-year old didn’t care for it though. Made extra and stored in a shaker for next time.

My son, who really only likes thin fast food burgers, devoured two homemade cheeseburgers with this seasoning. His friend had one as well, and said it was the best burger he's ever had in his life. Super happy I found this one! I made more, quadrupled the recipe and put it in a sealed container for future BBQs.

I was looking for a hamburger seasoning that was not as salty and/or peppery as the Montreal-type. This was it for me. Ate my burger without cheese or bun for the first time ever, it was that good! Thanks for sharing, Stacey! Especially loved that I had all spices on hand...

This has a good flavor that blends well with the usual condiments.  I fried the hamburger pattie in bacon grease. I  didn't have brown sugar so I mixed a very little molasses and white sugar together.  Smoked paprika would be good in this recipe too.j

DELISH!  I gave  4 stars vs 5 because there was no instruction on ratio of seasoning to meat. 
Thanks to other reviews I did 2 tsp. Seasoning mixed with 1 lb of ground sirloin and then sprinkled a little on top of each patty.  They were sooooo tasty! 
Fresh Brioche roll with your favorite toppings recommended! ??

I made this seasoning today for Mother's Day for my hamburgers. It was great!  I used the two teaspoons per pound of meat as recommended by other reviewers. I highly recommend these!  It's a nice change of pace from the old Lipton soup packet burgers.

Just made a batch of this for some pork burgers. Was out of cayenne but substituted Chili powder for it. Also added 1/2 tsp. of celery salt and did white pepper instead of black. Turned out awesome. Will be making this often

Followed the recipe but used a commenter's advice to use one Tb per pound of beef.  SO good!  I've used this mix in four batches of burgers throughout the past year and it's my favorite.  The last time I used it, I added a dash of Worcestershire and I think it was a good move, but I like my burgers to have a lot of flavor, so it might not be for everyone.  either way, this recipe is my new go-to.

I like just plain grilled burgers.  The taste of the meat.  I thought I would give this a try.  It was very good.  Following what some reviewers said, I mixed in 2t of seasoning per pound of meat.   This seasoning just like the rub I use when I smoke ribs or pork shoulder.  The rub, I use, has a bit more salt.  So rub your ribs down with this.  Sprinkle it on chicken or pork and grill away.

My husband and little brother in law liked them. Don't know if anyone else had this realization but we did notice this is Fuddruckers burger seasoning recipe. Haha.

This was a nice quick seasoning that used stuff I had. I used 2 teaspoons for every pound. I may do 3 next time plus tweak the formula just a bit. Think it might need just a pinch more salt and perhaps twice as much brown sugar. I would like to see how the sweet and savory works out. The paprika gives grilled burgers a nice smokey flavor and the cayenne adds just enough heat. In all, not an overwhelming overpowered season. Adds a bit of flavor where you need it.

Its very good, I double the garlic and onion powder, and use New Mexico Chile powder instead of cayenne.

Very flavorful... got lots of compliments from barbecue guests and my husband kept saying how tasty these burgers were... I do cut down on the cayenne a bit. I add an egg and sprinkle of breadcrumbs for binding. Let it sit with the spices for a few hours.

This adds such a great, and versatile, flavor. Aside from halving the salt, I follow it as written and it's wonderful on burgers (beef, turkey, even soy patties), chicken, and pork. This is now my go-to seasoning!

I've made this recipe about 4 times now, and my whole family loves it! We use about 2.5 teaspoons/pound. I have smoked paprika and it makes the flavor in our opinion!We do like a touch more salt, leave out the cayenne, but make the recipe as is other than that. I serve them with any kind of plain potatoes, and the hamburgers' intense flavor combines well with them. I'm making this mix in bulk now.

Delicious! We tried it last night. I only added 1/4 teaspoon salt because it was too salty with 1-1/4 teaspoon. Each to their own...

Mixed in with ground chuck and grilled burgers. It adds a nice rich flavor to the meat. Will keep in fridge from now on for very flavorful seasoning. Glad I found it!

Good basic seasoning, similar to Freddy's. Use 2 tsp. for 1 lb. meat, mixing well, and sprinkle a little on each patty before grilling/frying.

I searched for this seasoning out of desperation - I ran out of my usual McCormick's hamburger seasoning. Well, McCormick's no more! This is SO GOOD, and easy, too!! Per other reviews, I used two teaspoons to season one pound of ground beef. I used most of the remaining seasoning to sprinkle on top (we like a lot of flavor). Perfect!

My family loves this!  We are big burger eaters so I have tried different recipes over the years.  This spice mix is our favorite.  I combine the ingredients as written then mix the entire batch into 2# ground beef.  It's a tad spicy but you do want to taste the spices, right?  My 12 year old, who does not like spicy hot food, has asked for Spicy Burgers for her birthday dinner today.  Happy birthday, Ruthie!

I'm not sure if the four stars count for this recipe since I did have to alter it for lack of ingredients.  I used minced garlic instead, since I didn't have powder, and chili powder since I had no paprika.

It was spicy so I can't give it to my daughter's who are sensitive and still no word on my husbands opinion, I'll get that later tonight, but I enjoyed the 'kick' it gave.  It smelled like taco seasoning though it didn't necessarily taste like it.

Update:  I did this again and used the recipe as said minus the garlic (I forgot)  tasted great!  It wasn't as spicy this time though because I used more hamburger meat but it still had a tiny kick.  I'll double the recipe next time when I double the meat again.

Very disappointed in this seasoning. Really dried out the meat and I had to add Worcestershire to bring it back into an eatable form. Very spicy as well. If I ever try it again, I'm going to substitute all the paprika with a few dashes of hot sauce.

I didn't add the brown sugar cause the thought of sugar on burgers just don't sit well with the family. And some ppl maybe diabetics and I wouldn't wanna mistakenly hurt someone. It was good with everything else and I added my own spice and we loved it.
