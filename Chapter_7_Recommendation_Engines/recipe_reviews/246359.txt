Recipe turned out great. Followed the exact recipe and it exceeded my expectations. Served it with pasta and spaghetti sauce on the side. The next night I made hoagie sandwiches and it tasted even better.  I will definitely make this recipe again.

I have always loved sausage and peppers but have always had trouble pulling it together, until I used this recipe.  The addition of the diced tomatoes really did the trick.  This is an extremely basic recipe, any level cook can make it.  This is some quality grub!  My daughter, who doesn't like peppers, loved it.

Made it with a few changes. Cooked the sausages whole until almost done, added the onion and minced garlic. Sautéed until onions were nearly soft, added the peppers. I didn't have the "flavored" diced tomatoes so added 1/2 t each of dried oregano and basil and 1/4 t of pepper flakes to a can of diced tomatoes. Added this to the sausage, onion and peppers. Heated completely then served on a hoagie roll. Quick Family Favorite. Peppers were perfectly al dente and not mushy.

Great, simple recipe!  My grocery store didn't have the sliced,frozen sausage so I used Johnsonville Italian sausage links instead. Because my plan was to eat them as a hoagie, the links were perfect for that.
I have made sausage, peppers, and onions many times, but this is the best recipe by far. The only thing that is different from my version is the diced tomatoes!  That put this recipe to another level.   The tomatoes  pulled everything together perfectly. 
This is my new recipe :-)

It was very good. The second time I made it I added a can of tomato and green chillies and served it over rice. It was great the tomato and green chillies gave it a little kick!!

The only change I made was to use a loaf of garlic bread, which I had gently heated and place sausage and peppers on the roll.
I topped filling with shredded moz cheese as did not have provolone.  This is a keeper.

Served on lightly toasted hoagie rolls.  Both of us started with a half and ate a whole.  Sliced up Johnsonville mild Italian sausage and cooked first before adding 1 red pepper and onion.  No olive oil.  No red pepper flakes.

So easy and very good! A little too acidic for me, so I added a little sweetener. I also had only the regular canned tomatoes, so I added garlic, basil, and oregano to the skillet to taste.

1-16-20 ~Since I always have Italian sausage in the freezer and bell peppers in the fridge, this is a handy and easy dish for me to make.  For this recipe that called for a specific type of pasta sauce, I just used some pasta sauce (which included black olives) that I had leftover from another time, and it proved to be just enough to use here.  I added a glug of red wine to the sauce and tossed this with some penne pasta.  Nothing not to like here.

Substituted a can of tomato paste instead of diced tomatoes. Also added a 1/4 stick of butter to the olive oil.

Tasted awesome. Can’t go wrong with Johnsonville sausages and this recipe is simple. I used the ingredients, left the sausages whole and slow cooked it for about 5hrs.

I made the recipe as written but probably let it sautee in the pan on low for 10 minutes longer than the recipe calls for.  Served on higher quality sub/hoagie rolls.   I was worried the taste of the sausage was going to be overwhelming, but everything blended together well!  This is going to be a weekend/comfort food go-to!

The recipe turned out great.  I used extra onions and assorted peppers and sautéed mushrooms for extra flavor.

I made this with precooked chicken sausage instead of the one the recommended and it was great! I had it with yellow rice on the side and use it to meal prep for the week. Such an easy recipe that you can tweak to your liking

Perfect the way it is! Good low carb meal without the hoagie. I used a spicy sausage and it was terrific! Definitely a keeper

I used Johnsonville Hot Links because that is what I had  on hand while camping.  Some folks ate it on bums and  some on rice left over from another meal. It was hearty and a hit and very easy in the camping setting. I will definitely make again.!

I did not use the red pepper flakes since we don't like spicy dishes and it was fantastic!  Served it over rice.  I would definitely make this again.

Not a big hit in my family. Quite bland in flavour. I suppose with tweaking it might be OK. We are not a family that craves heat and spice but this needs help. It may, however, be a nice way to introduce small children to more complex flavours.
