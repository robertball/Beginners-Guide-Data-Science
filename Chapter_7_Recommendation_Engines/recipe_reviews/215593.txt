I tried this and it tasted pretty good, a surprising mix of ingredients you wouldn't expect together, but well made.  The problem I had was that the vegetables were pretty soggy once they had sat to cool for a while.  I would recommend that you make sure the peppers are dry before stuffing them with the eggplant mix.     ... I think it may also be good to try this with raw peppers.  I might do that sometime :).

We loved this salad!  I did cut the peppers in half and use them more like boats.  My children didn't care for it as much, but they don't care for bell peppers.

This is an interesting salad, which I liked.  I followed the directions and taste-wise, I just thought it needed a bit if lemon juice to brighten the sauce.  It was easy enough to roast both the peppers and eggplant and even to peel them, but that is where it stopped being easy.  It was hard to I get the seeds out of the pepper, keeping it intact and then it wasn't rigid enough to stand to be stuffed.  The next time I will cut the peppers in half lengthwise and seed before roasting and use more smaller eggplants, with fewer seeds and just pile the filling in the pepper halves.  But I will make them again - thanks, Asli!

We enjoyed this recipe but tweaked it to make it more flavorful.  To the chopped egglplant I added salt, pepper, chopped fresh mint and parsley. To the yogurt garlic mixture, again some fresh mint.  Placed stuffed peppers over a bed of fresh salad greens and sprikled all with a bit of sea salt and fresh lemon.  YUM!
