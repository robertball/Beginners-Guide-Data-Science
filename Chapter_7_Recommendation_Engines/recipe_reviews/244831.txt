This bread was good. It came out moist and flavorful. I used 4  smallish overripe, frozen bananas that I thawed in the microwave. I doubled the vanilla and used a heaping teaspoon of cinnamon. My main issue with it was that I had to cook it for 75 minutes and put foil around the edges the last 15 minutes. The edges didn't burn, but they were very dark. I used the butter spread sticks, and I think they worked well in the bread. I was skeptical about using the spread on the pan instead of my usual Pam spray, but the bread came out fine with no sticking or burning.

This recipe was OK. I was pleasantly surprised at the ingredients list for I Can't Believe It's Not Butter brand spread but was disappointed at its lacking flavor. It held well in baking but considering this recipe calls for 1 cup of 'not butter' and one stick of butter is equal to 1/2 cup... I'd rather stick (no pun intended) with butter in baking. A great deal of spread has to be used to substitute for butter. I let my bananas fully ripen, followed the recipe, and added chopped walnuts. This recipe was extremely easy to prepare. I had no issues with sweetness as other users had complained but they did state their bananas weren't riped enough. I'm not sure if it was my oven but I needed to cover the bread with foil for the last 20 minutes of cooking time. The banana bread was lacking in flavor. I believe this was due to I Can't Believe It's Not Butter being made of cooking oils and butter being made with sweet cream. Banana bread is so common that it's hard to impress people with anyway. Points to them for attempting a recipe that nearly all cooks claim their recipe tastes better. I am glad I gave this recipe a try but doubt I would make it again.

This was a good basic recipe and lacked in flavor for us. This is not a sweet bread at all so if you like sweeter breads this might not be for you. I wish I would have used more of a ripe banana so that might have been part of the problem. Normally I used overly ripe bananas in my bread. I was impressed with out moist it did turn out.

We really enjoyed this. It wasn't as sweet as I expected but had a good flavor to it and took no time at all to prepare.

Perfect. I made this for my son and husband. It disappeared  quickly. I also made a small 1/4 pan for myself using my vegan soy free spread and egg replacer. I have food allergies . It came out perfect too!

I added chopped peanuts to the top of the batter before baking and otherwise followed instructions. I'd probably add a touch more salt and cinnamon next time, but loved the tenderness of this bread and how much banana was infused into each piece. The I Can't Believe It's Not Butter spread blends very easily into the batter.

This was a good banana bread. It seemed a little on the dry side but wonder if my bananas were not large enough. It went together quickly and is a great way to use up those leftover bananas.

This is a great banana bread recipe.  I was skeptical about using I Can't Believe It's Not Butter in the recipe, even though I use it daily as a spread.  I was raised by a mother who taught me that you only ever bake with butter - it was like a commandment in our house.  So hence my skepticism.  But I was pleasantly surprised.  This recipe came out crunchy on top, soft in the middle and had just the right amount of banana flavor.  I baked for 60 minutes at 350, then put some aluminum foil loosely over the top because I didn't want the outside to burn, then put it back in the oven for another 10 minutes.  It was perfect!

This turned out great for us! I used frozen bananas and doubled the salt. I also added some chopped walnuts to the batter. My loaf took about 75 minutes to bake, so the timing for me was a little off but other than that we loved it! I've never baked with ICBINB and I was pleasantly surprised. Thanks for sharing!

I was skeptical about baking with ICBINB as I always opt for real butter but the result was amazing. This banana bread was delicious!!! The perfect texture, so moist and a little bit crispy on the outside. I dusted it with some confectionery sugar to decorate it a bit. This recipe was a hit with my family.
