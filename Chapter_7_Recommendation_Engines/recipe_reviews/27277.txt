These were horrible!  After making them, we just threw them in the trash.  This recipe was just a total disappointment.

My husband and I thought these were awesome!  Very close to my mom's regular "refrigerator" cookies.  I took the dough and rolled it, and refrigerated it before cooking.  Used Splenda Brown sugar.

These cookies were the best!  I put all the dry ingredients in a large bowl and mixed well. I used splenda brown as well as white sugar replacements. Then I cut the butter in with a pastry knife. I then added a 1/3C egg whites only and the vanilla, then blended with a spoonula until everything was moist then stirred in the chopped nuts. Used my cookie scoop to make sure the cookies all came out the same then flattened them with a fork chilled in ice water.  Next time I make these I am going to try and double the recipe as I can't seem to keep up with the demand for them.

My husband and I loved these. Wish they were fewer calories. Neighbors thought they were good, but not great.

I made these with my few pecans that i had left ... worried that it would be a waste of precious, rare pecans, ( not a plentiful crop and very expensive in SC this year ) ... I forged on!  So glad I did! These cookies are so good and so easy too!

I went into these cookies thinking of the flavor of my chocolate chip cookies in which these are not. but, they are tasty! I added chocolate chips because, well, I love chocolate. good recipe!
