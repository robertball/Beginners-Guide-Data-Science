Just because their sugar free don't for get the carbs in the flour. I'm diabetic so what I do is use 100% whole Wheat flour. I put in 1-3/4 cup WW flour and 3/4 cup AP flour to help bind it. I make an old Swedish spice cake from scratch and for spices I use 1 tsp. Cinn. 1/2 tsp. nutmeg, 1/4tsp.allspice, 1/4tsp. clove, 1/4 tsp. ginger. taste great get a lot of compliments on it.

These cookies are like muffin cookies, very delicious with the raisin in it. Definitely sugar free, I am going to try next time to use a little vanilla in it. And gluten free flour.

The only reason I gave this 4 stars was because I added crushed walnuts to the rest of the batter,  a 2nd batch and put in pecans along with the raisins.  They retain a chunkier shape and when kept in the fridge, are even better with tea!  They definitely need the extra umpf to the recipe to make it a tastier and less flat cookie that is more sponge than cake-like.  And with the liquid stevia, you'll never know it's not made with sugar!  I'm diabetic, and finally found a cookie I can snack on that I like!

Not bad, I used honey instead of artificial sweetener.  If I made them again I would add more spices, needs a bit more flavour for me.

I really like these. They taste great for being sugar free. As others have said, they're kind of fluffy like muffins. I did add walnuts though they'd be great with or without. I will definitely be making again.

I have been making these for years for someone with diabetes as a Christmas treat. I spilled something on my original recipe and thankfully I found this.

I recently discovered I am diabetic, and I felt in serious need of cookie with my afternoon cup/mug of tea. This is a great , so thank you. I substituted the raisins for dried cranberries. I think they could use a bit more spice; like a bit of ginger or allspice. Please keep these kind of recipes coming.
