This was absolutely the best shrimp scampi ever! it was simple, yet fantastic! If you follow the recipe its great. I threw some feta cheese on top of the shrimp before broiling it. You shouldn't rate the recipe based on your experience with it after changing the recipe. Its unfair for those who haven't tried it yet to consider it with a bad rating based on your recipe instead of the original one.

Great recipe for scampi. Tossed the brandy/wine mixture with some angel hair pasta, parmesan, red pepper flakes and poured the olive oil/shrimp over the top. It turned out great! The key with the shrimp is to fully butterfly them, dry them out using a paper towel, flour them and refrigerate before sauteing. Good luck and happy eating

This wasn't bad but I have had better. I added more garlic. I also thought it needed some lemon and maybe a little butter.  I will not make again.

I have ordered shrimp scampi in restaurants plus I have also made it myself several times, but this recipe, by far, beats them all!!!  It really does melt in your mouth.  Subtle crispness on the outside and sooooo tender inside....yummmmmmmmm!  :)

This was delicious!  Instead of the brandy, I added a little half & half, white wine & flour.  Topped w/ fresh parmesean cheese.

I wasn't overly impressed with this recipe. It wasn't bad, but I felt like it was missing something. I will try it again, and maybe tinker with it a bit.

Update (9/10) - I made this again, adding green onions and some lemon juice (1/4 lemon), and loved it. I also let the shrimp sit in the flour mixture about seven minutes before sauteeing, and added one small diced roma tomato to the garlic mixture - to imitate the scampi made at a restaurant famous for it's cheesecake. Thanks for the recipe!

Good but not the absolute best. I made no changes to the recipe followed it percisely. It has great texture and flavor. I suppose I was hoping for something more garlicky and buttery (shrimp scampi served at Red Lobster). I'll keep searching though. I won't add this to my regular rotation but I will keep it handy.

Very delicous.  We added 1 T lemon juice at the end.  We used butter instead of olive oil. No brandy in the house, but still very yummy.  How to chop fresh parsley???  Trim stems and cut parsley using kitchen scissors in a small, tall sided bowl.  Makes the chopping process so much easier.  Will make again and again!

I thought this was great. Me and my husband loved it. The only thing different I did was add the zest of 1 lemon and the juice of 2 lemons after sauteing the garlic. I also grated 3T. fresh parmesan over it before broiling it. Yum! Thank you.

Good but not "absolutely the best". The flavor combination is very good. The only substitution I made was Scotch whiskey instead of brandy b/c I didn't have any brandy, and some diced purple onion in place of the shallot. some other reviewers who served over pasta commented on it being too dry. I too served on pasta but doubled the wet ingredients and it did help some. I might venture to do even a  little more next time. When I do make this again, I will omit dredging the shrimp in the flour, it end ups mushy in the oil, OR....I will place the broiled shrimp on top of the pasta and then drizzle the sauce over the pasta and shrimp right at serving.

Grneyedmustang's adjustments should defintely be made:   "I made this again, adding green onions and some lemon juice (1/4 lemon), and loved it. I also let the shrimp sit in the flour mixture about seven minutes before sauteeing, and added one small diced roma tomato to the garlic mixture"  I further added a smidgin' of tomato paste -- not sure if I'd do that again and if you try, limit it to 1-2 teaspoons I'd say.  Other good advice here was to completely butterfly the shrimp -- it's not a hard and it's a great effect.  I used non-stick pan and thus didn't have much pan scraps to flambe.   I ended put a little more white wine over the dish after the flambe.  THIS IS A SHOW-STOPPING STARTER.  Your guests will flip!  Consider making more!  (I also added some scallops, those for 2 min. instead of 5.   *Great!*

This was the best I ever had but I added one cup of sharp cheddar cheese, four tablespoons of balsamic vinegar and about a half cup of heavy cream, a quarter cup of corn flakes and put it under the broiler. Excellent!!

Oh my.  I made this for dinner tonight and it was really, really, good! I made a few modifications though:  I omitted the cayenne and salt to the flour and replaced it with Old Bay seasoning.  I used 1 lb of shrimp, but kept all other ingredient amounts the same.  I used 1/2 olive oil and 1/2 butter; I used fresh oregano, 1/4 cup white wine, no brandy and about 2 Tbsp of lemon juice.  During the wine/brandy step, I added the fresh herbs in at the last minute and then poured everything over the shrimp. The last thing I did was to sprinkle crumbled feta cheese over the entire dish before broiling. The end result was out of this world good!

Definitely not the best shrimp scampi...the breading of the shrimp is unnecessary, adds extra carbs and cals and does nothing for the flavour.  Much prefer Shrimp Scampi Florentine from this website.

I've made this recipe at least a dozen times. I have been under seige for the recipe and party invitations are contingent upon me bringing "my" shrimp scampi. Be cautious - you may become a social appendage to this recipe!

LOVED this.  I added two tomatoes with the garlic and shallots, green onion and sauteed spinach on the side with shallots, garlic and olive oil.  I added the cooked spinach in with the shrimp and the garlic and shallots.  I served it over Noodle Roni (as goofy as that sounds) angel hair pasta.  It is a tasty boxed noodle and was wonderful with the shrimp.  Family LOVED it!

An excellent version of scampi. I changed it a bit by using a mixture of clarified butter and olive oil instead of straight olive oil, added a few more cloves of garlic and mixed in about 2 teaspoons of lemon zest with the garlic and shallots. Also used the parsley as garnish rather than cooking it.    There isn't as much sauce as other scampi recipes I've made so it's really not meant to be served over linguine or rice the way I do with other scampis.    Definitely a keeper.

This turned out to be a very tasty dish. I took the advise of others and added 1/8 cup of real lemon juice in with the wine and brandy to create more sauce and 2 Tbsp of unsalted butter to the olive oil when sautéing the garlic.  I served it with saffron jasmine rice with fresh chopped cilantro.  Delicious! Everyone really enjoyed it...even my picky teenager.

Awesome!  Only change I did was use 1/2 a small onion b/c I had no shallots.  Cooking this is fun and the results are amazing.  This recipe doesn't recreate a sauce...so if you want one prepare a butter sauce.

I served with angel hair pasta...buttered with parm cheese.

GOSH.... how can someone "change" the recipe and then rate it ??? if you FOLLOW this recipe it gets 5 stars.. if you use pasta etc and change it you can NOT rate it based on your expierence.

I could not believe how good this was.  Here's a few tips:  This recipe goes really quick - have all your ingredients pre-measured and ready to go.  This will not produce a lot of sauce so you may want to plan to have it "with" instead of "over" something. I think I should have made rice pilaf or something that would not compete with the main dish.

This is the closest match to a certain restaurant scampi that I've ever made. It was very good. It will definitely be one of my favorites.

This recipe is awesome , i was a bit worried about setting kitchen on fire but flames died quickly no problem....My fiance who loves shrimp scampi said its the best he has ever had and he orders it most times we eat out at restauraunts he also used to work in 5 star restauraunt and the chefs would cook it for him !!! This is the best he claims , the worst part is now he is spoiled and wont take me out to eat to get it because this is really YUMMY THANKYOU for such a fast and easy way to make my fiance amazed that a woman who never even ate shrimp scampi that has 5 small children can cook better than a chef 10 STARS*************

Nom nom! I omitted the cayenne and instead added Cavender's Greek Seasoning to the dredging ... then substituted butter for half of the EVO ... finally, and always, more garlic. Delish!

I too used less flour, and the sauce came out rich, creamy and flavorful.  The white wine added a little zing.  Next time I might add a little lemon juice as well.  Look no further for your scampi recipe!

Good, but not much sauce. Thank God I only cooked shrimp until pink otherwise they'd been tough. I got the 20 shrimp in & it was time to start turning them over.  When returning to the pan to heat it was for a minute. Didn't put under broiler also because it would've made the shrimp tough.  We did serve over pasta after making more sauce.

I make this at least once a month and the family (even the picky boys) love it.  I use more garlic and sprinkle some parmesan cheese over the shrimp and it really taste incredible.  Thanks for the recipe.

Wonderful! And, it was awesome flavor. I used green onions, instead of shallots. I didn't have any brandy or wine, but the taste of the shrimp came out fantastic. I added a little parmesan bread crumbs to the sauce and tossed it with the organic pasta....it was simply fantastic! My husband said WOW! on the first bite...Thanks so much, this is definitely a Keeper!! :)

Very tasty. I only gave it 4 because I had alot of flower bits in the sauce. Next time I might just not flour them.  And I had to add some lemon and crushed red pepper to perk it up. Every one loved it. Thanks for sharing.

Mmmm...this is wonderful! Next time, though, I'll try omitting the flour dredging and put those spices directly into the olive oil (w/o the flour) That seemed like an extra step and time. I'll also try less olive oil, and try more of a stir fry. My store had no shallots, so I minced 1/8 cup sweet onion, which was fine. I remake only the recipes we love, and this is one of them. Fabulous! Thanks, K. Mitschke!

I will make this again, and again, and again!  If you are looking for a Red Lobster type of recipe, this is not the one.  However, this is a scrumptious meal.  I added butter to the oil, and that worked well.  Next time, I will put a tiny bit more garlic, but this is my personal preference.  My kids looooooved the shrimp and ate them all!  They also loved watching the fire in the pan (I had fun setting the alcohol on fire ;-D)  I served the shrimp with a side of buttered pasta. Yummy!   This was wonderful.

This is an outstanding shrimp recipe.  I had extra people so first I browned some cod cakes and placed in over and then did the shrimp as  specified - what a great combination.  Everyone raved, they think I am a genius!

I love this recipe! It's simple and delicious. I try to make a little extra sauce with the shrimp so that the pasta (I use linguine) gets covered nicely. Excellent recipe!

WOW!  This dish was amazing!!  I did make some changes.  Instead of brandy and white wine, I used tequila and marsala, and I used yellow onion instead of shallots.  I am originally from Louisiana, so I like my food with a lot of spice, and this was popping with flavor!  They were very crunchy and had an amazing flavor.  We used very large shrimp and ate them plain instead of over rice or pasta.  You have got to try it!

We tried this with shrimp and it was great, but expensive.  To economize, one night we substituted chicken and now it's my all time favorite food.  I love it so much my boyfriend makes it at least once a week.  I've used it in salads, on angel hair, and a la carte. Everyone should try this recipe!

Was bland, even with extra garlic. Not enough oil remained to blend the spices together well, and certainly no sauce for anything other than the shrimp. Only thing I could really taste was the cayenne pepper. Followed recipe to a tee, this is the first time I've been let down (and embarrassed serving this) by an allrecipes recipe rated so highly. Not what you would expect for a true shrimp scampi.

just delicious. i couldn't ignite the brandy with only 2 tablespoons, so i added a bit more and then ignited, then i reduced it a bit in the pan before pouring it back over the shrimp. I also added just a few shavings of parmesan over the top before broiling. It was beautiful and an unbelievable hit at our dinner party.

YUM YUM!!  This was great, tasted like it was from the well known italian restaurants.  I added parmesan after cooking.  BEWARE...you will reek of garlic and burp garlic after consuming.  This dish will impress your friends. BTW, I am Italian.

I followed the recipe by the book and it turned out fair. Needs double the garlic and about 4 tablespoons of butter along with the juice of one lemon to spice it up.  I made a quick garlic cream sauce for the pasta and topped it off with the shrimp.  Turned out pretty good.  The recipe is a good base receipe to jump off with.

Absolutely delicious! Everyone in my family loved it - even the kids! The recipe didn't call for it, but I added a splash of lemon juice. I served it over a bed of pasta and we all enjoyed it.

I wish I would have taken a picture to submit because I thought this was beautifully presented on the platter. The flambee was fun, but this was not the "absolutely best shrimp scampi." I will not make this again.

Out of this world, I used extra jumbo shrimps and cute them in half, then I added more white then what the receipe called for plus I added fresh lime juice after it was cooked to take a bit of the garlic taste away, and i did not broil it at all. I served it over linguini. It was excellent. My fiance stated that it was better then the shrimp scampi at the restaurant we go to. :>)

This was good so I will give it four stars. The only problem I had was the amount of sauce it makes.  The shrimp absorbs all the oil so you are just left with 2T of wine and 2 T brandy. I used all wine (no brandy on hand). It was so dry so I added a half a stick of butter and that brought it up to speed. Just a suggestion. Good overall tho'

This shrimp recipe was great.  The only thing I changed was the flour.  I used rice flour.  It makes it crispy and light.

This was a dynamite recipe. I didnt have shallots so I went with the green onions which turned out kind of crispy. Also,I changed the end a bit and sprinkled crushed macadamia nuts prior to broiling and a little salt. My family who doesn't like shrimp is begging me for a redo.

This was really good, my husband says "absolutely the best". I couldn't get the alcohol to ignite, but it tasted fine anyway, great flavor. I will use larger shrimp next time (less peeling). I served it with buttered angel hair pasta and a salad.

YUM!!!  I followed most of the directions.  I only used one pound of shrimp, since we actually made this for two but I kept the other ingredients the same.  I didn't cook the shrimp for 5 mins, probably closer to 3, since 5 mins seemed like a lot.  I added the white wine and not the brandy and didn't bother putting it under the broiler.  I'm not sure what that adds.  I served over whole wheat linguine (added a bit of olive oil over it first) and topped with some crushed red pepper and fresh parmesan.  Not too time consuming and very tasty.  We will definitely add this to our regular rotation!

This recipe was delicious as is but, I decided to "tweak" it a bit.  I added a little sprinkling of seasoned bread crumbs and Parmesan cheese to the recipe, as well as extra garlic.  I also splashed in some additional white wine and brandy, then served it over  linguine.  Wonderful!

I'm pretty sure it was the shrimp, not the recipe, but you really need to get fresh shrimp.  Whenever I buy frozen shrimp, the recipes don't quite come out right.  Will try this again with FRESH shrimp...

This was a great dish!  My husband and I both loved it.  I added more garlic and more like 3/4 cup of white wine and a 1/4 cup or more of brandy and I nixed the whole catching the alcohol on fire idea.  Unlike some other reviewers, I did not feel it needed any butter but maybe that is because I added the extra wine and brandy (!)  Definitely a keeper!

This was delicious- probably the best shrimp dish I have ever made.  I served over linguini....and if you do that...it helps to double the brandy and wine to make a bit more sauce.  I served a tomato salad with fresh mozz. cheese on the side.  Hubby loved it.

Not bad.  However, it lacked pizzaz.  The flour tempered the flavoring and I think it needed at least triple the garlic.  I will try it again, but will use butter with the olive oil and more seasonings.  Jim

I hesitated to try this recipe simply because of the goofy name, but I am glad I did.
It is excellent.  If you are looking for a very garlicy version of scampi this is NOT the recipe to try.  The flavors are very subtle, and I thoroughly enjoyed every tasty morsel!  Any time I had made scampi before, I cooked the shrimp in the sauce, so to fry them first and pour the scampi sauce over the shrimp was different for me.  The result, however was wonderful, producing a very tender yet crispy shrimp under the succulant sauce.
I will be making this recipe this weekend for our best friends and can't wait to see what they think about it!

This is the best scampi!! I like my scampi with a thick sauce that envelopes the shrimp, not thin and watery, and this fits the bill. I did change a couple of things to fit my taste though. I sauted in butter, added more garlic, omitted the brandy, and added lemon at the end. Still fantastic and yummy. Can not wait to make it again.

I made this last night and it was delicious!  My whole family loved it!  I thought the coating on the shrimp was just perfect and the cayenne pepper made it very tasty.  The only thing I didn't use was brandy because I didn't have it.  I served it with whole wheat pasta.  I didn't have enough sauce left over for the pasta so it was a little dry.

This was extremely tasty.The boyfriend kept eating the cooked shrimp before the meal was finished. He's giving it a 5. I didn't have shallots so used chives and it was delightful.  While not the scampi dishes I have made and loved before, it was really good.  I cannot wait for leftovers.

we fell in love with this recipe the first time we tried it.  I usually add a bit more garlic since we are garlic lovers, but its easy and tastes so good that it absolutely is the best shrimp scampi.  We usually serve it with a pilaf and a nice salad or broccoli.

Truly a wonderful recipe! Instead of flaming the liquors, we just added it to the sautéing garlic/shallot etc. mix. Also, we put it over angel hair pasta with a tiny bit of extra olive oil poured on top. Superb!

I tried it as prepared in the recipe and thought it was good though a bit dry. So I added 3 cups of Ragu tomato sauce. It was awesome with the combination of the sauce and the shrimp!

This really was fantastic!   I squeezed in the juice of one lemon, added some capers... and then before putting it under the broiler I topped it with some freshly grated parmesan reggiano cheese.  I'll definitely make this again!

I registered on this site just to rate this fantastic recipe. It was absolutely the best shrimp scampi I've ever had, and it received raved reviews at my Christmas Eve dinner table. I took another reviewer's advice and added some lemon juice into the mix (1/4 lemon) but didn't change anything else. I was not deterred by those who said it wasn't saucy enough. You don't need "sauce" to add to this delicious scampi!

This tastes just like the shrimp scampi we all fork out 20 bucks for at the better restaurants. Now we don't have to!! : )

This was to die for as written. But, I think that I improved upon it by doubling the amount of sauce and substituting Frangelico for brandy.

With a few revisions, this recipe is absolutely delicious!  I replaced the white wine with lemon juice and added a few extra cloves of garlic.  This dish will be served again at my table!  Extra yummy!

This recipe had a lot of flavor, but it was almost too rich and intense! I was expecting something a little saucier, too. I think it would be great with a light tomato sauce, but alone it seems to be missing something. I might experiment with this recipe again because the technique was fun!

Didn't really care for this one.  My shrimp came out mushy/gooey because of the flour.  I may try this one again b/c of the other rave reviews and will adjust my review.

This was really good, but not worth going out and buying brandy and white wine (unless it's bottles you keep on hand).  I agree with some that the sauce got too absorbed.  A little butter would help.

Delicious dish! I used 2 tbl of olive oil and 2 tbl of butter, half and half in lieu of Brandy, and served with lemon wedges. I did the same thing with Jumbo Scallops - served them over California rice with a salad. So good I plan to impress the in-laws next time they come!

Really great flavor.  I added green, yellow, and red pepper and scallions, plus more wine.  It added some color and veggies to the dish.  I also liked the shrimp with the flour mix on them.  It's a winner.

This really is the best shrimp scampi!  My husband and I loved it. I made it with the frozen already peeled shrimp and it was still melt in your mouth tender. Thanks! Bit time consuming because of fiddling with the fresh parsley. Does anyone have a quick easy way to mince parsley?! Will definitely make again!

This was a delicious version of the dish. However, the wine and brandy evaporated almost immediately upon pouring it into the pan.

Cooked this just tonight and it was great! We had the shrimp by themselves with steamed broccoli on the side, but these would be real good over pasta, rice or a salad too.

These were definately not what I expected them to be.  I followed the recipe and even went out and bought brandy for these - now I have to find something else to use it for. When I think of shrimp scampi I don't think of breading.

I was not incredibly impressed with this recipe, either. I agree that it was missing something...in my case, any sauce? My favorite part of this dish was the angel hair pasta I served it on, which was tossed with just a touch of fresh cream and parsley beforehand. For instances where this does yield sauce, however, I'm sure that would need some improvisation to prevent it from being too greasy. I may try this again with some modifications for move flavor, but the recipe is a good start.

This was a very good recipe! I didn't use Brandy or wine because I didn't have it, but I did squeeze half a lemon in after the spices were ready and added about 4 tablespoons of cut-up butter on top when I broiled it.  I will definately make it again, but I might try omitting the flour so it could be more saucy.

This really is a great shrimp scampi recipe. I did think there was too much parsley though, so i'll cut down on that next time. I'll be making this again, and I definately recommend it to others!!

Without a doubt the best tasting shrimp I have ever had.  I added another clove of garlic and it didn't overwelm it.  the only thing I didn't do was broil afterwards for fear of drying them out, everyone loved it and asked again for it this week.  Enjoy

This recipe was great!  I used Old Bay instead of cayenne pepper and also added some lemon at the end.  The shallot, parsley, and white wine were delicious, and I used more butter than olive oil.  I thought it was pretty easy to make and came out very tasty!

Great recipe.  I added a little touch of my own, however.  Try adding a little bit of Ms. Dash's Spicy seasoning to the flour mixture, and breadcrumbs and grated parmesan on the top when broiling.  We're big garlic lovers, so I thought that this recipe could've used a bit more garlic.  Overall, GREAT recipe (goes gret with a Sauvignon Blanc)!

My life is better for eating this scampi. Thank you very much. This is a definite way to impress that significant other who thinks you're cooking stinks.

This was a fantastic starting point for me. I have to cook gluten free, so was a little concerned. The differences I used were, replaced all purpose flour with rice flour, tripled the garlic, the juice of 1/2 lemon and about a tbl of zest to the saute,  added chopped fresh spinach, and small sliced roma tomato to the shrimp prior to putting under the broiler, I also used red cooking wine instead of the brandy because I was out.  Over all husband, 18 yr old son, his girlfriend and my 14 yr old daughter loved it. I made a double batch to have for lunches tomorrow, but as there is none left we will be having sandwiches. :)

I've been looking for a great scampi recipe, and I think with a little tweaking this might be it.  I followed the recipe to a T, with good results.  I'm not sure the flour is completely necessary, and next time I would definitely double the sauce.  I think I'll try this one again...

Average. I felt like it should have had a little lemon added to it, and maybe some garlic powder in the flour mixture. I think I will give it another shot with some modifications.

I fix shrimp scampi often but this was the one my husband deemed as the "Best Scampi" you've ever made. It was fantastic. The only alteration I made was to add a pinch of salt to onion and galic saute. THANK YOU!!

Really good flavor but mine was a bit doughy from the flour.  Next time I will try bread crumbs.  I used the very sweet Maine shrimp.

The name caught my attention....it wasn't the BEST Scampi I have ever tasted, however, it was pretty darn good and so simple and quick to make!
It did not take the 40 minutes quoted either. Much faster. It makes an elegant, quick, wonderful tasting dinner!  I added just a few capers....

the name of this recipe doesn't lie. i omitted the parsley, oregano and shallot because i didn't have them on hand. i also sauteed the shrimp in butter (mmm) instead of olive oil. this turned out wonderfully; it tasted like something i'd be served at an expensive restaurant. THANK YOU!!!!!!!

I am not a seafood eater but my husband is. Always felt guilty about his love for shrimp and lack of every getting it at home. Thought I'd surprise him and found this recipe, crossing my fingers on it being good. Other than cleaning the shrimp (my first time ever!)I was able to quickly put this together before he came back from a golf outing. While he got started grilling the Jack Daniels marinated steaks, I started the scampi. Imagine his surprise! He loved it and said it was the best scampi he's ever had! He's very honest about things like that,but it was truly confirmed when he called his parents to let them know about the wonderful dinner he had!

although not the traditional "scampi" I've always made, this is without a doubt FABULOUSLY different from the "average" run of the mill recipes I've used.  I agree with some of the reviewers, I almost always make MORE of the sauce to pour over it especially if you are going to serve with any kind of pasta.  We like the extra sauce to mop with bread or the pasta.

My Fiance LOVED it.  Told me to make it a keeper, and that's rare for him.  Left out the brandy and used green onions, my store was out of shallots.  Turned out very nice, served with a parmesan pasta and some vegetables.  Tasty, but I will use a bit more herbs/garlic in it next time. :)

Added fresh lemon juice and butter to the sauce.  Tossed the sauce with angel hair pasta and did not put the shrimp under the broiler because I didn't want them to become too tough.  Good but not the best scampi I have had.

We butterflied the shrimp, used pre-cooked shrimp....flavor was outstanding.  We followed the recipe as-is.  Wish we could give it higher than a five-star rating.

This was delicious. It gained flavor after setting a while. I think I will cook it next time without flour.

Because of the way I made it I'm only giving it 3 stars, but will make it again and will most likely revise it as it's really a good recipe. I forgot the oregano so that left out some of the flavor. I also put it over too much angel hair pasta so the sauce got sucked up. I do think, though, that there's not quite enough sauce, even if I had used the right amount of pasta. Kramnodrog had a great suggestion about butterflying the shrimp and refrigerating them, but you also need to really make sure you knock off the excess flour or else the sauce will be much too thick. I added sun-dried tomatoes and threw some broccoli into the pasta pot just before it was done, both of which added a nice dimension and color. I really want to try it again but somehow increase the sauce without adding a whole lot more oil...perhaps using chicken stock.

My husband thought this was really delicious, and so have some guests lucky enough to have it too.  I never have brandy so I skip the flaming and broiling part and add extra olive oil on the pasta.  The flouring of the shrimp really adds some thickness to the sauce!  Delicious!

I used fat-free half & half & had to add a lot of flour paste to the mixture, & I also added more garlic, but this was really good & easy to make!
My boyfriend said it was the best shrimp dish he had ever had!

Very good although the coating of the shrimp with the flour mixture can be skipped.  Didn't really do much to the flavor.  Needs more olive oil.

I added juice from a whole lemon, 1/4 c. butter, 1/4 tsp of pepper flakes and 2Tbsp of capers to the last step of directions and omitted baking. I added all ingredients and did a quick warm up sauté before souring over pasta. I was surprised at the flavor. Absolutely the best scampi my guests and I ever had. I will use this recipe from now on. Thanks!

Breaded shrimp scampi is a new twist for me. The family liked it (I added Parmesan prior to broiling) but wished for more sauce. I don't keep brandy on hand so I doubled the wine. So maybe next time I'd add butter and a squeeze of lemon. Will probably make this recipe again, altho the breading part adds time.UPDATE: April 2015 This recipe takes more time then most others, but the result is worth it. I added 1/2 stick of butter and then tossed the shrimp with pasta. A squeeze of lemon on top is the finishing touch.

This recipe turned out really good.  I used a 1/4 cup olive oil and 1/4 cup butter and a finely diced the shallot.  I also increased the garlic to six large cloves.  For the pasta I used 9oz of fresh angel hair and tossed it in a pan with 1/2 tbs of olive oil, another 2-3 cloves of garlic, 1/3 can of fire roasted tomatoes (with juice) and about 2 tbs of finely chopped fresh basil.  I served it with roasted asparagus with parm.  It was better than I expected and I certainly make it again.

I never made scampi before, and selected this recipe because it looked pretty easy and purported to be "the best."  Then, as I'm cooking, I see it's telling me to light things on fire. Give me a break!  Plus my husband complained that the shrimp isn't supposed to be breaded.

This was really good but not the best scampi ever.  It is a very good recipe on its own. I just don't think it's a scampi recipe.  I'm giving it four stars because I did really like it and will make it again.  It's just not scampi.

This tasted amazing and we didn't even have all of the ingredients!  I didn't broil the shrimp since I didn't have the wine or brandy.  But we did serve it over Uncle Ben's wild rice which went pretty good with it.

I used regular French mustard since I didn't have Dijon handy, I started with 1 TBSP of mustard but it smelled so good in the butter mixture I ended up using more.  Also used 3/4 C butter and 1/4 C of white wine.  Sauteed about 2 TBSP of onion with butter before adding all other ingredients to it.  The sauce alone was such a big hit that my mom who's on the Atkin's diet ended up having two slices of bread for the sauce.

I definitely did something wrong! Mine ended up somewhat gooey. Probably should have shaken a LOT more flour off as well as refrigerating it for a while so that it would stick to the shrimp.  Will try it again though, it has promise.

I am not sure if I did something wrong, but this was only so-so. I served it with rice pilaf but would use plain rice if I were to make it again as the rice overpowered the scampi.  I like my scampi a little "saucier".

This recipe was tasty, but much work. Then the flour from the shrimp came off and made the sauce rather thick. Although is tasted great, I might keep the list of ingredients and combind with another recipe with less steps.

A great recipe. Coating the shrimp in flour gives the sauce a bit of extra body and the shrimp more flavor. Brandy can be ommitted. Lemon, garlic, and wine can easily be adjusted. The best!

Very good. I was a bit disappointed in the quantity - three adults ate the entire dish in one sitting. If you have a few guests, make a double batch or it will be a tiny yield for such a long ordeal!

This recipe was very good.  However, I would have liked a little more "tang" (e.g., lemon or salt flavor).  There was too much oil - I might try sauteing with more white wine next time.  I served the shrimp alone as hors deurves and they all went!

Delicious!  The pasta itself is a little naked for my taste.  I read in one of the reviews that they tossed the pasta with the brandy/wine mix with some parmesan and red pepper - Yeah, that probably would have made it even better.   This is definitely a do-over.

We loved this recipe, a different twist on scampi. We had fried a bit of bacon for salad and started the sauté with the leftover bacon grease with the olive oil and a bit of butter. I had no brandy but used a blended whiskey (yum), added some lemon juice at the end and threw some parmesan cheese on as we served it on some pasta. Not too much pasta because the shrimp became the main character for the entre. Wedge salad and garlic bread completed the meal, Heaven!

I made this recipe for my grandma's birthday, and it turned out great. I added some scallops, and I also caramelized some onions with a red bell pepper and tossed the scampi with it. I used four tbsp White Zinfandel instead of the white wine and brandy because it was already open in the fridge, and I didn't want to find real alcohol. I topped it with half a lemon's worth of juice, lemon zest, and parmesan. I definitely will make this again.

Took advice from other people who commented and added 2 tablespoons of lemon juice (fresh). Also didn't have brandy so I just used 4 tablespoons of white wine. I couldn't light the alcohol on fire, I'm guessing because I didn't have the brandy. Otherwise the recipe was the same, and came out fantastic! This was my first time cooking shrimp and it came out perfect. I was very easy and relatively quick. I highly recommend!

I LOVED this - it was tasty and incredibly easy. I would like to have more of a sauce with it though.  My husband does not like the breading (but I did because of the texture and it held the cayenne flavor to each shrimp). Whole family agreed it was very tasty and all would eat it again.

I thought this recipe was especially greasy and bland.  I give it 3 stars only because I accept some responsibility for possibly not doing something correctly.  My husband liked it better than I did, but I thought it needed something.

flavor is great, but needs more sauce. Try maybe the chicken stock and some wine for that, the flavors are so attractive, the stock and wine should not take away from the "flavor".

Followed someone else's suggestions to toss brandy/wine with angel hair, and it came out pretty decent. Too much garlic for our taste, and one family member actually had to leave kitchen as they were sauteeing. Took advice of same person and butterflied and refridgerated shrimp prior to cooking. Had no problem with flour as others who did by not taking this advice. Alot of work overall though, and I am not sure I would make again, although mayber I would consider doing again and sticking 100% to recipe's directions and see if I can get it to 5 stars.

I made this recipe without reading the other reviews (big mistake), I ended up adding more wine and a little chicken broth to make more sauce.  I think there is too much flour in this recipe, and the sauce seemed kind of bland.

I have never heard of shrimp scampi made without lemon juice and perhaps sliced lemons. I will go back to recipes with lemon juice, white wine and always butter. Also capers are a great addition.

I was very disappointed! After following the recipe exactly, at the end there was no liquid for the pasta.  I measured everything as instructed but the sauce completely dried up and the pasta had no flavor.  I would not recommend this.

My son brought his new girlfriend home to meet the parents and wanted something light, but homecooked for dinner. I made this shrimp scampi recipe and it was a huge hit. Definitely something to "Mies en Plas", but very easy and quick to make. I did add freshly squeezed lemon juice to this recipe - most shrimp scampi has a lemon.

This was a hit! I used my wire rack for the dredged shrimp and wound up wishing I had another one to drain them on after sautéing - they were a little oilier than I would have preferred. But so good! I didn’t like the smell of the wine we had on hand (and was scared of lighting it on fire), so I just added a little butter to the oil and sautéed plenty of extra garlic. Put shrimp on fettuccine, garlic on shrimp, poured what little oil was left over top, and squeezed lemon juice on everything. Could basically live on this.

Will definitely be easier to make the second time around I was a mad man making a mess in the kitchen but it turned out delicious . Very flavorful and juicy. Not sure I will be using the flour next time.  Went great over some Alfredo too

Started this as written, but after tasting, added a LOT of minced garlic and also a shake of lemon juice. LOVED the red pepper in the flour mixture, it adds a nice kick. Tossed it all into pasta and it was a hit!

This was delicious! Because some reviews stated that there was not enough sauce I made a butter sauce with 1/2 cup butter, some garlic, lemon, and wine. I put this sauce over the pasta before I placed the shrimp on top. Also, sprinkled grated Parmesan cheese on top. Excellent dinner with a green salad and garlic French bread toasted.
I should have taken a picture because it looked so tasty too.

This is the best Shrimp Scampi ever! I listened to the other reviews and was careful with the bread crumbs. I've made it three times now and had great results all three times.  The family said it is a new favorite!

My husband and I really like this.  One of the things we like most about it is that it is not drowning in butter but still has awesome flavor.  Followed the recipe exactly.

This one deserves this title. 

I changed it a bit by adding some of the left over flour mixture to the pan for making the sauce, and used herbs de province instead of oregano.  I added 2 more tablespoons of brandy to give it a sweeter flavor.

It really IS the absolutely best shrimp scampi-
I've now made it three or four times and it has always been a huge hit - I also make this with angel hair pasta and a green salad...
Thank you so much for the great recipe

The shrimp tasted good, but I prefer a little more sauce with my scampi. This uses hardly any liquid and no butter, so there's not much to go over the noodles.

Why oh why didn't I take a photo? It truly was a masterpiece ! It looked beautiful and tasted spectacular! The bag of shrimp i had was a little larger that what was called for in the recipe so  I increased the other ingredients but followed the procedure of the recipe.  Why change perfection?  I did use 1/2 butter and 1/2 Olive oil and increased the amount of garlic and red pepper.I have never made any recipe that couldn't benefit  from more garlic! I served the scampi over thin spaghetti . We both LOVED the meal and will be proud to serve it to guests.

It would be a lot better if you didn't cook the shrimp for 5 mins, then put it in the oven to cook again. I'm a seafood gal & I know you cook shrimp for maybe 30 sec on 1 side then, the  other....it literally doesn't take long to cook these lil critters.

I doubled the liquid plus added 1 T butter and 1 T lemon juice. Let floured shrimp sit on a rack for 10 minute to set the flour before sautéing.

This is the best Shrimp dish I've ever made.  It's ridiculously easy and fairly quick.  A few times I didn't have Brandy so I've used whiskey or sherry instead and both times turned out amazing, like with the Brandy.  It's really just a little kick to pour over the shrimp.  I make this dish with a side of quinoa and steamed veggies.  It's truly the only seafood dish I make that even my kids devour and ask for seconds.

This was DELICIOUS!! As we were removing the shells and deveining the shrimp I squeezed a little lemon and added some zest to the shrimp. I also added some garlic powder to the flour mixture. After I fried the shrimp and removed them, I added some cooking sherry to the garlic and fresh herbs and a little more lemon and sauteed it all up... It was SUPERB!! We served it over whole wheat angel hair pasta.. YUMMMM. I can't wait to make this again!

Great flavor but too dry to serve over pasta the way we normally do. Probably would have been better as a main along side rice pilaf as suggested in the description, but since the picture showed pasta that's what we did. We had to butter the noodles to add a little moisture. I also added some lemon juice based on other reviews. I added extra garlic and used dried parsley since we did not have fresh. We also did not have brandy in the house. The closest thing to white wine we had was Marsala, so we tossed that and the shrimp back in the skillet and skipped the igniting and broiling.

Followed the recipe as written.  Shrimp were soggy and the breading didn't adhere to the shrimp properly.  Very faint garlic flavor.  Very limited sauce too so forget putting this over pasta.  Hardly any sauce.

Excellent flavor, although I had trouble getting the shrimp to sautee up without all the mixture falling off. In the end there was not a lot of sauce to go overtop, and it seemed dry. May try again with more wet ingredients?

I wanted a shrimp recipe that included brandy and this worked but I would have like something more with a little more sauce. I guess that I could have added more white wine. 
I loved the lightly breaded and pan fried shrimp the best! I dredged the shrimp in a gluten free potato and garbanzo bean flout and it turned out perfect. 
I used cilantro and lemon instead of parsley less garlic and and a chopped porcini mushroom and butter.
Next time I make I will use more white wine and add a little thickener for a nice sauce.

Very good recipe as written.  But, one thing I do different (which still sticks with the ingredients), is make the flour mix in advance in a container... and toss the shrimp in it well before cooking it, and put it in the fridge for a while.  Might look like a goowey mess when it comes to cooking time, but that flavor gets into the shrimp.  

Now, for those that say "this isn't a scampi because scampi isn't breaded!"... Ummmm Scampi is a very small Lobster caught off Norwegian shores.... soooo.... If you are using shrimp you aren't close anyway.  But... I'm not close to Norway... soooo... I love this dish with Shrimp!
