Really good! I cut back on the velveeta a bit and added additional shredded cheddar and also added some salt pepper and garlic powder to the eggs. Other than that made as instructed. Very tasty and easy recipe good for any time of day:)

I cooked the bacon and potatoes both the night before (I used potatoes O'Brien adding additional onion and peppers). In the morning I whisked the eggs and sour cream poured it over the potato mixture arranged the bacon on top and shredded the Velvetta. Cooked it and served for a holiday brunch along with a different breakfast casserole for variety. Everyone liked it a lot the only complaint was as it cooled the Velvetta had a slightly rubbery texture. If I had used shredded cheese that may not have happened and it was a very minor complaint. I have been asked to make it since and I think "most" people will really like it. I loved making this and the other casserole ahead so I had time to visit while they cooked.

We just finished a dinner of this recipe. I followed the recipe exactly as I always try to do for the first time. While it was easy to do a plus and I had high expectations I can not recommend this recipe. It was boring to eat. Filling yes. But texture and interesting flavor no. There are many recipes on this website that have the same ease but have complex and interesting flavors and textures. I will use them.

This was ok but it seemed like the proportions were off. It was very thin and taste was kind of blah. It seems to me that it should have more hashbrowns and definitely some salt and pepper.

This was good. I used potatoes O'Brien so didn't add the peppers and onion. Just put the potatoes in the bottom of the casserole. I needed more potatoes than what it called for. Topped with the cheese which I cut back a little but shouldn't have. All in all it was pretty good.

Pretty good. The recipe says mix the cheese with the veggies but in the video it is sliced on top. I followed the video but if I make it again I'll follow the recipe. The cheese didn't spread out like I expected.
