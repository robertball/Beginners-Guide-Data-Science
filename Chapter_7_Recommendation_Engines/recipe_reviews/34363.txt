This was very good, however the next time around I will do a few things different. I will get the dough as thin as possible and make the strips for the braid smaller and thinner. Also I will add a good bit more cheese. I did need an extra set of hands to help pinch the sides together while laying on the braid. I did do the egg wash and it came out golden brown, looked beautiful and tasted great.

Very easy and delicious.  I sautéed a small onion, 2 cloves garlic, and 1/2 TBS of italian seasoning to add to the cheese/pepperoni filling.  I only used 1lb of refrigerated pizza dough.  I put the filling in, and rolled it up like a traditional stromboli.  I'm sure the braiding would have been decorative, but I didn't want that much bread, and wanted to make this an easy recipe for a weekday.

I made these tonight for dinner, and they were a huge hit! I made my own dough, and I didn't have enough pepperoni, so I added some other meats. I also added saute'ed garlic, onion and bell peppers. After baking, I brushed the tops with garlic butter, and sprinkled with parmesan cheese. Thanks for sharing!

DELICIOUS!! Stomboli is my husband's favorite so I made this with my grandparents for a test run...want to make it for his birthday!(He's a Jersey Boy, so it's gotta be GOOD!!) We made our own dough and left it in the bread maker too long, so it was hard to stretch it! Nor could we braid it, so our stromboli looked like a gigantic calzone! Also, 20x8 IS HUGE!! We could only stretch our dough to 15x7 and had to call more family over to help us eat it! Like others, we spread garlic butter over the top before baking and used the new Kraft Parmesan/Asiago/Romano grated cheese on top of that...SOOO GOOD!!! My aunt was picking the grated cheese crumbs off the plate-it's very yummy toasted! The only change I recommend besides making it smaller, is adding a lot more pepperoni and more cheese :) Will definitely be making this for my husband's birthday!!

This is a great recipe.   I recommend using the pillsbury croissant dough for the bread because it fluffs up nicely and tastes so much better than some of the other frozen breads you can get.   I stretched the dough out long ways and then made layers (wrapping the dough around the ingredients like a pizza pocket).

Easy and delicious!!! I added cubed pepperoni and cappicola with tons of cheese and sauce.  My son was able to make his own, he added garlic salt/oregano.  I also made one with broccoli/peppers/onions, etc.  Customize...it's great!!!!!!!

Very easy recipe and came out great.  However, next time I am not sure I'd do the braiding on the top.  I am not sure I did it right and there was so much bread on the top.

I made two modifications to this dish. #1 I brushed a Tuscan oil seasoning on top of the bread, which definitely added more flavor to the bread. #2 I used pizza sauce for dipping.

I love recipes that can be improvised, and this is one of them. I used refrigerated pizza dough and divided it in half to make two different Stromboli. I made one with Italian sausage and pepperoni, and one with Italian sausage and pineapple. I also added diced onions and red and green bell peppers to the sausage while sautéing. After assembly, I brushed them with garlic butter before baking. The baking time and temperature was perfect! This is a great “sit in front of the TV” meal!

Wonderful recipe! I didn't change a thing. I used a Publix deli pizza crust and added sauteed mushrooms to the filling. I also rubbed the crust with butter during the last 5 minutes of cooking. Thanks for the great recipe!!!

My husband absolutely raved about this!  Easy & delicious, a keeper.  I cut the recipe in 1/2 (plenty for the 2 of us as a meal) and bake time for my oven was 25 min.

Very fast, tastes great! Just remember to take the dough out to thaw in the morning. We did some minor changes the second time we made...omitted the extra oregano, the ground is too strong. Maybe crushed would be okay? Added more cheese, brushed loaf with a beaten egg to help the parmesean stick and give it nice color.

This was a huge hit and so easy.  Added mushrooms, onions and bell pepper and the flavors were delicious.  This will become a regular at our house.

I used pizza dough and added thinly sliced  cooked steak with additional cheese to the second  stromboli.  A second stromboli was made because the first just lacked something.

I altered the recipe some. I used 1/2 lb. of sausage in addition to the pepperoni and pizza sauce rather than spaghetti. I also used an italian cheese blend rather than the mozzeralla and added minced garlic. Delicious!

this was pretty good. I think I didn't stuff it enough with the pepperoni and cheese. It was a little too much breading. I will try it again though and add more to it. I'm sure it will be better. My husband loved it though!

Thanks for the dinner idea! I used french bread dough from the grocery store bakery, and added a little garlic powder to the top before baking. My hubby dipped his stromboli in extra spaghetti sauce (warmed) and enjoyed it. I prefer pizza--less bread and more toppings. If I do it again, I'll add more veggies and use thinner dough.

I made these last night for dinner. I used the refrigerated pillsburry pizza dough because that is what I had. I just the dough down the middle and filled them with the toppings we wanted and then folded them. I used an egg wash on the top as other reviewers suggested. They turned out perfect! I plan to make these again. They are easy to make and you can make them any way you want.

Yum! I added extra sauce on top before baking, then added extra cheese 5 minutes before it was done. Delicious!

Update: We've found that adding some cooked pork sausage makes this stromboli absolutely irresistible! Also, after making it dozens of times, I've found I'm completely happy without the bread braid on top, and sometimes I mix a little shredded cheddar with the mozzarella.

My family enjoyed this. I had a box of Hot Roll mix in my pantry I needed to use so I used that instead of the frozen dough. And I added some canadian bacon. Next time I will add veggies. Instead of braiding the bread I cut slits on both sides and then layered them over each other. It gives the braided work but without all of the extra work.

Our stromboli actually came out looking like a calzone. lol. We couldn't find a loaf of frozen bread dough so we ended up buying a refrigerated french bread loaf in a can. It was really hard to roll out, my husband had to help me with it and he was getting so frustrated and in the middle of the process he actually even said "we are never making this again." lol! So we ended up just made a really flat circle and put everything on one side and then folded it over and pinched it together. We used a really thick deli ham instead of pepperoni and we used an italian blend cheese instead of just mozzarella. I definitely used way more than the recipe called for. We also basted the top with butter and sprinkled italian seasonings on top. We also didn't put any sauce on it, but I did dip my stromboli into some italian ragu sauce. It was absolutely wonderful and while eating my husband said "ok we are gonna have to make this again." haha!
It was really easy to make and there is just so much you can do with it besides pepperoni. The italian seasoning made the recipe though. Thanks to all of you who mentioned it. I don't think it would of been as good without it :)

Totally excellent idea! I bought ready to bake french bread and stuffed it with turkey-pepperoni and genoa salami. Then added both cheeses. It was amazing!

I love pizza in any shape or form but braids are cute and presentable. I like herbs mixed in with the parmesan.

Pizza lovers - this is for you!  I served this at an after Christmas gathering (a gathering of some very picky eaters).  I made two of these and wished I had made 4 because between 10 people they were gone in about 5 minutes!  Delicious! I used Ragu chunky vegetable spaghetti sauce for the filling and fresh parmesean.

I made this last night for my roommates and me and it was excellent.  The only thing I changed was the amount of sauce (I'm not a big fan of sauce) and the addition of garlic butter and Italian seasoning.  Very good and very easy to make, even on a budget!  Thanks!

My family really liked this, but I just didn't care for it too much.  The bread was pretty thick, so it was more bready than filling.  It was good bread though, I used Rhodes.

This stromboli was very good!  I did a few things different.  I used pizza sauce, added sauteed mushrooms and onions, and brushed an egg wash on the outside with basil for a nice golden crust.  It looked very nice esp with the braid.  I would make this again!

Using frozen bread dough for homemade pizza works wonders! I'd never tried it before. I've found that these days I just roll out the dough for a regular pizza crust instead of rolling up (one less step), but the stromboli rolled up is really yummy too! Sometimes it's a little hard on the outside, but I like the simplicity. SO much better than those refrigerated pizza doughs.

Yum!  I made with cubed ham, onion, and mushrooms.  I used Pillsbury French bread dough.  Boyfriend and I both loved this, I will make again.

This has been one of our favorites for many years.  It is so adaptable to any of your favorite fillings.  I like to saute some sliced onion, bell pepper and mushrooms lightly, or fry up some crumbled Italian sausage.  We also have put leftover ham slices, olives and hot pepper rings.  Fun to let your kids make their own too.

Oh.My.Goodness!!!  Tastes like the YUMMIEST pizza EVER!  I really, really enjoyed this and would definitely make it again.  I made the dough in my bread machine (just used my calzone recipe) and it worked great.  I sprinkled a little fresh basil and parsley on the tomato sauce that I used and it was super-tasty.  Thanks!!

I left out the peperoni. I made one with just sauce and shredded mozzerella cheese and one with sauce, cheese and vegetables. They came out great! I used "Pizza Dough II" from this website for the crust and it turned out great!

What a great recipe! I used it as a guideline, omitted the oregano and parm. cheese. Added garlic salt and browned hamburger. Baked for about 20 minutes then basted the top with butter as others had recommended and sprinkled some shredded cheese and a little more garlic salt on top, EXCELLENT. Will absolutely be making this again!

Yummy, this is a keeper. Great flavor and so easy to make. My family loved this, something that they can agree on at the dinner table. I agree with previous post that Rhodes frozen bread dough is the BEST! Thank you!

mmmmmmm, very yummy right out of the oven! my boyfriend remarked he would've preferred about twice as much meat but still managed to devour his dinner without hesitation. i only rolled out about half of the braid dough to cut down on calories (it was a cinch to made 4 cloverleaf rolls with the remaining dough) & my stromboli still looked scrumptious! thank you arrenia!

Quick and very simple recipe for those on the go evenings. I used Pillsbury pizza crust in the tube which made it very easy to roll out. I also added Italian seasonings and Parm cheese to the filling and used fresh mozarella. I brushed the top with an egg wash and sprinkled on more parm and seasonings. Delicious Arrenia and thanks!

great flavor - had a hard time rolling out the dough and braiding it so I gave up and put two flat doughs together - it wordked - but a lot of bread.  Next time I think I'll do one loaf and fold.  But it was a big hit anyway!

this is definitely easy enough to make and the kids will love it, but to me it was just bland.  I think I will try it again and add italian seasoning to the crust before adding the ingredients.  I'll update and let ya know how it was.

I used refrigerated pizza dough, but I had trouble trying to braid it and ended up just giving up and pinching it all together. There was too much bread and not enough filling. I would use more cheese next time. Though I'm not sure there will be a next time, it wasn't worth the effort.

I thought this was a good and easy recipe for a first time stromboli attempt. I used the refridgerated pizza dough from Pillsbury - I was not too crazy about it. I will not make that mistake again though. I do suggest adding a lot more pepperoni and cheese. Otherwise, it was a great recipe worth trying and I will make it again with minor changes.

My daughters BF comes over everytime we have this for supper, they all love it.
I don't use the spaghetti sauce in the stromboli we use pizza/spaghetti sauce for our dipping sauce.  
Always a crowd pleaser and not a pricey meal either!!

I don't know what went wrong, but I had WAY too much dough and it didn't even cook all the way through inside. Not very good at all, maybe I made an error but I don't think so, I followed the recipe exactly. Won't be making ever again but thanks for the recipe anyways! It was fun to make! Just not so much to eat. :]

I used Italian pizza seasoning, and a five cheese blend, as that's what I had on hand. Ok, so it didn't turn out nearly as attractive as I had been hoping, but it tasted good! Thanks, Arrenia!
