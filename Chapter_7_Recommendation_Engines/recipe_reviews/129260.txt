The tapenade was delicious the marinade not so much. I would reccomend someone use a favorite mexican type marinade if anything instead. Also, do not eat for leftovers!! The avocado turns into an unappetizing flavor.

I was a little apprehensive but decided to give it a try. My fears were completely unjustified, as it turned out to be delicious! I loved the tapenade and thought the lemon marinade went well with it. One tip: for this one it is a must to use FRESH INGREDIENTS.

an excellent mix of flavors. one of our favorites. the lemony marinade blends well with the avocado and capers.
