Just eh....Family said it was just OK, and no one went back for seconds.  The flavors are all very strong and pungent.

This was such and tangy and delicious steak meal! I am not usually a steak or mushroom person, but this made me want to eat both. My husband and I loved this meal AND it is a very easy meal to prepare! I used feta instead of Gorgonzola, but otherwise did everything as directed.
