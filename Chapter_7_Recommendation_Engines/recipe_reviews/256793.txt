THIS IS A VERY GOOD DIP. But it could use some spice added to it like HOT SAUCE or Pepper Flacks

Super easy to make and it was the hit of the BBQ I took it to.  The only deviations that I made was I used Trader Joes taco seasoning and I made my own refried beans (lard free) in my pressure cooker.  No spice to speak of so if you want to bring the heat you will need to add some pepper flakes or fresh/pickled chilies.

This is really good-love bean dip & this is one the best I have tried!  It makes a huge amount, so perfect for a crowd.  Word to the wise-use sturdy chips, as the cheese on top gets tougher as it cools.  Love this-thanks for sharing!

Could you put anymore cheese in this?!? It was so good! Great combination of flavors with the beans, cheeses, taco seasonings. All of it came together. I even took some leftovers and put them in tortillas to make quesadillas. Everyone loved it and it's so simple.

This was really delicious and easy. I am the only person in my household that likes beans and everyone that tried this dip loved it! It does make A LOT of dip.

Oh man was this ever good. I added a second can of chiles, and to be honest would have liked a third. Agreed with the other reviewer who mentioned a sturdy chip. Once this stuff starts to cool down, it gets difficult to manage. Still, so good I don't even care if I have to eat it with a spoon.
