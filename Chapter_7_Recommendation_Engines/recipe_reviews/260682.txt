10.17.17  I didn’t have any English mustard, so I used Dijon.  The bay leaves brought very good flavor to this soup, and the texture was spot on creamy.  Cauliflower is not a bold-flavor veggie, so I wasn’t surprised when I found the soup’s flavor a bit weak, so I did add more cheese and more salt and pepper.  I used the slow cook feature on my Instant Pot® and was happy with the way this recipe turned out.  And it is indeed easy to make, a definite plus!

This is a good base soup, but I made some additions for added flavor.  I caramelized the onions by sauteing them first.  I made a split between chicken broth and veggie broth, both low sodium, so I could control the sea salt I added.  I added about 8 grinds of sea salt.  I added 10 grinds of black pepper.  I also added a nice yellow curry powder and smoked paprika, both 1 tablespoon each.  I used 2 cups of shredded sharp cheddar for more flavor too.  I also like using the immersion blender, as I think it makes for easier clean up and a smoother and more controlled blend.

Must grate cheese yourself. Pre-packaged shredded cheese has an anti-caking ingredient which causes it to congeal in things like soups and sauces. Tasty and easy soup!

To save time, you can eliminate the final step of pureeing the soup, by using  fresh riced cauliflower in the soup.  It cooks faster and there is no need to transfer hot soup to a blender to puree.

I cannot believe how EASY and FLAVORFUL this is, with so few ingredients!!!  One easy tip—-use a stick blender while it is in the crockpot and you won’t need to worry about pouring hot liquid into a blender. It’s so smooth and creamy, you might think it is a cream based soup. Yummy!!

I doubled the recipe, except for the chicken broth because other reviewers stated the  soup was runny and not creamy.  This was an easy recipe .  This is a good recipe for cauliflower lovers - which I found out that I do not really like cauliflower.  I topped off the soup with bacon bits and cheese.  I wouldn't make it again as the entree, but  I would make the recipe as a side dish.

Super easy to make and absolutely delicious. I used a smoky sharp cheddar. So good! Crumble a little bacon on top to add color. I’ll make this over and over again.

This has potential.  I added some curry for a bit of flavour.  Next time I would add less broth (too runny), more curry, more cheese and more cauliflower.  The  whole family enjoyed.  Will make again.

This was easy and very tasty.  I’m glad that I made it.  I used 1/4 tsp horseradish because I didn’t have English mustard in the house.

It was like water. I thought it would thicken up, even after I added corn starch it was still like water. It was a waste of good ingredients.

Made as directed, the cheese curd.  I would add the cheese after the four hours.  I would sauté the onions for more flavor.

Cheese didn't melt, rather it kinda of coagulated, and when blended, it never turned creamy.   Leftovers were worse,  it was like wet sand.

This sounded so good, but it is not.  the ingredients are fine but cooked together just not right.  I can't even say why.  I will not be making again.  I used some great bouillon and it still had such a negative taste.

I made this and it was terrible. The cheese curdled and it was bland.
