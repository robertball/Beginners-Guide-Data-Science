decided to try this recipe because we had an abundance of canned apricots and didnt know what to do with them.  this is quick easy and ooo sooo good.  I as well as a few others in the household dont tend to like apricots but all of us really enjoy this recipe ALOT!  The recipe can have any spices added to it as well as other canned fruit can be used in place of apricots or with them.    Shared this with many others already and make it readily.  Thank You

My husband and I had something like this on our honeymoon (a B&B) that we LOVED. Only change was that I used crushed honey graham crackers to cover the top. Also, an 8x12 dish seemed too big to layer it, so I used a smaller one. Wonderful!

Okay. I didn't care for the taste, but my husband enjoyed it. Not overly sweet, which I think he liked, since he's not a fan of sweets.

My mother in law has been making this for years.  I am not a huge fan of apricots, but this is one of my favorite recipes she makes!  Very good & perfect for holiday menus.

Family favorite of ours. EVERY holiday dinner includes this dish and we all love it. Never any left overs! I usually add another layer and make sure there is a good layer of crumbled crackers on the top. We look forward to this dish every holiday!!

Good recipe but really aired on the sweeter side of taste. 

Goes well with baked root vegetables.

It just doesn’t get any easier than this.  I loved this, but my husband just thought it was ok thus the 4 star rating.  This is a wonderfully easy dessert that isn’t too sweet and company worthy.

This is one of our annual traditional dishes during the holidays.  We love it with ham, and also roast beef.  This is a great dish to let little ones help assemble and since they all demand it every year, they are all eager to help.  The key to the success is a low temperature oven, for a long time.  Do not cover and just let the dish caramelize as it bakes.  It is sweet, a bit chewy and takes the place of cranberries or even dessert.
