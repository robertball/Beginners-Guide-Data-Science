This is a reply to a reviewer below.  To keep your lasagne from becoming watery, drain the noodles very well and blot them dry.

This recipe is so simple and easy to make. My husband and I loved it!  I suggest adding ground beef with the sauce to make it more meatier, otherwise I followed the rest of the direction. Thanks

Very good, but it turned out watery.  Could it be because I used fat free cottage cheese?  Any suggestions would be appreciated, because I really liked this.

I did a few things differently.  I couldn't bring myself to use American cheese, and I made a mixture of 1/2 ricotta and 1/2 cottage cheese.  I also added some ground beef, otherwise I didn't think it would have enough taste.  Rating is because I changed so many things.  Thanks for the post.

This was yummy, ooey, and gooey.  I made a couple of modifications:  I used ricotta, not cottage cheese, and just dumped a few dollops here and there.  I left out the American cheese entirely... it's already such a cheesy dish that you won't even miss it.  I sprinkled some bottled parm on the top, which fine as a substitute for the fresh.  I didn't use meat-flavored sauce, but I threw in some soy crumbled beef substitute to make it a vegetarian dish without seeming like a vegetarian dish!  

Also, the composition turned out better in the metal baking pan I used than in the ceramic casserole dish.  Not sure why, but it was less watery in the metal pan.

There should be a law against using cottage cheese in lasagna.  I made this last fall and it was really good... with ricotta.

This was great. My son (who is a very picky eater) loves this lasagna. I only made a few changes, I didn't have any spaghetti sauce with meat in it, so I used regular sauce and added meat (1 lb. ground turkey). I also used more of the shredded cheeses than the recipe called for. I will be making this again.

This was awesome!  Everyone loved it.  I did alter it just a little.  I mixed the ricotta cheese, italian spices, and eggs together and let it sit in the refrigerator to marinate for at least 2 hours.  It was wonderful!

Wonderful dish.  I replaced the American cheese with Provolone and the Cottage Cheese with Ricotta and it turned out wonderfully.  I even added some zucchini on the first layer to sneak it in.

Really good recipe! But I didn't have the heart to use cottage cheese or American cheese in lasagna, so I left out the American and used ricotta in place of the cottage cheese. Very simple but nice!

Too many noodles.  Not enough sauce.  Not very flavorful.  I've got a LOT of leftovers.  Want some?

I first want to say that I don't believe there was enough sauce or cheese for this recipe.  If I were to make this again, I would buy more sauce and cheese.  There was also way too much noodles.  I threw away half of them because they couldn't be used.  A half a box would have been fine.  With that being said, I think this was way too dry.  I think not having enough sauce made it that way.  I also added meat to my sauce which good thing I did or I really would have hated it.  I think next time around, I'll find a different lasagna recipe.

This recipe is great!! I have been making this lasagna for well over two years and it is my husband's favorite. The only thing I have stopped doing is putting in the American cheese. There is so much cheese already that we don't even notice the difference!! Thanks for the great recipe!!

I left out the American cheese but I also left out the cottage cheese, not because it didn't sound good but because the hubby dosen't like it.  I just added way more of the other cheeses, added ground beef, and fresh Parmesan cheese (to me the fresh really does make a world of differrence)!

I used ricotta instead of the cottage cheese.  I added a whole head of garlic, oregano, and garlic salt but it was still kinda bland. Definately worth making again.

One of my new favorites. I love cheese, but I still thought the lasagna would be a little bit lacking without meat. I was wrong, tasted great.

My boyfriend was wanting a lasagna and he was so happy with this one.  (He's a picky eater, but he loves cheese.)  Very tasty!  I even swapped some cheeses for others, but I can't remember which ones.

I didn't like the taste of the American cheese in this...it really stood out to me.  I enjoyed it otherwise and the family ate it and enjoyed it.  I will stick to my regular lasagna recipe with the meat left out.

This was very easy to make, and delicous. My husband and son and father all loved it. I'm sure it will become a regular on our meal list. The only thing I will change is to add more cheese. We are cheese lovers and I think it would have been better cheeser.

I never thought I would say this, but there was almost too much cheese.  I thought it was a little bland, but it was something different from regular lasagna.

I made it to take to an employee recognition day at my office, and I was searching for something that a co-worker of mine would eat since she eats little to no meat. I passed the recipe around my office and made it again for my parents. This has become a family favorite!
