I used Comstock MORE FRUIT Cherry pie filling. I like lots of fruit. Also, used two 9 in. round pans, so I could give one away. I lined the pans with waxed paper, so I could turn them out before putting the nuts and glaze on.   2nd review:  I now have used a Lemon Cake mix, and lemon pie filling.  Then sprinkled a generous 1 C. of thawed frozen blueberries on top. I have lots of pecans so normally use them.  It turned out great!!    Also, tried a jelly roll pan one time. Too much batter for that = it ran over the sides when baking.

Made this cake yesterday for our teachers' breakfast.  I used a yellow cake mix and apple pie filling.  Had to bake it 45 min. instead of the 35 as stated in the recipe. Made the icing and put it in a sandwich baggy, cut the tip off and drizzled it diagonally on the cake. It tasted wonderful and was perfect for breakfast/brunch. The presentation was beautiful too.  This was the cake everyone loved and wanted the recipe.

WOW!! This is awesome..at least with my changes. I omitted the eggs, water and sour cream and prepared the cake as instructed on the box and then added the cinnamon. I also used a yellow cake mix and blueberry pie filling. Soooo good, I really cant tell you how great this is. Boy am I glad to have leftovers!

Our son, who lives in Minneapolis, will be spending the night with us tonight as he will be on a brief business trip in Wisconsin.  I wanted to have a sweet treat for him but because I am on crutches following knee surgery I am unable to cook or bake right now.  Hubs is already filling in for me for dinner (he's a great cook!) but he also good-naturedly agreed to bake a simple coffee cake for me, even tho' he's never baked a thing in his life. I think he turned out a beautiful and delicious cake with this recipe! (See photos in my profile) I had him bake it in a Bundt pan rather than a 9x13, and it was perfectly baked in 50 minutes.  The cake is moist and rich, even tho' there is no fat added other than the sour cream (he used full-fat).  And the cinnamon does a fairly good job of masking that characteristic "cake mix taste."  If a complete novice like Hubs can turn out such a beautiful and delicious cake with just a little guidance and supervision, it suggests that this is a relatively fool-proof recipe for something that deceptively seems more sophisticated. This will be a repeat, especially for "emergencies!"

Made this for a covered dish.  Everyone loved it.  I used a lemon cake mix with blueberry filling. Will make it again soon, this time for my family.

I made these for Easter brunch. They were wonderful. I had to bake them longer than suggested and I used chopped pecans on top because that's all I had. I also used apples instead of cherries. It turned out great. I will make these again. Thank you

I want to give this 2.5 stars.  This would be great for a church function where you need a dessert that is easy and fits in a pan and looks cool and doesn't cost much to make.  But I wouldn't make this for a distinguished guest, because it's just not very impressive.  The cake is only as good as your cake mix.  A little cinnamon doesn't make a cake mix great.  And a can of pie filling doesn't taste fresh no matter what you do to it.  But did we eat it all?  Yes.  And the kids loved it, because they love cake.  So, the rating depends on what kind of recipe you need.  functional: 4 stars.  taste: 2 stars.

I made this coffee cake with a white cake mix and strawberry pie filling. I was hoping that it would be a keeper, but... it just wasn't that good. I typically add ingredients in an attempt to make a not-so-healthy recipe healthier. I wanted everyone to enjoy this recipe, since it was made for an Easter gathering, and so I decided not to modify the recipe at all. I used strawberry pie filling because everyone loves strawberries in our family. It was moist, and it did have an interesting texture with the toasted, slivered almonds and icing topping. But the flavor was kinda bland and no one was all too impressed with this dessert. That's just us though, you may like the recipe, so don't let my review deter you from trying this recipe.

Very good! Make sure you let it cool entirely before cutting, otherwise all the filling will quickly ooze out.

I made this for a family Sunday dinner.  I used blueberry pie filling and everyone loved it.  It was very tasty and disappeared quickly.  I will be making this again!

I was disappointed with this recipe. It turned out beautiful but I expected it to be a wow and it just didn't live up to expectations.  It was okay but not something I would make again.

My mother made this Easter weekend and I loved it. She got the same recipe from the Kraft Food Magazine and followed the instructions. I think it would have been better with lemon filling. But, this is a keeper and is extremely easy to make.

I made this for the teachers at school and was doubtful.  They raved that it was wonderful.  I never actually tasted it but their reviews were grand.

I REALLY wanted to like this recipe, but just couldn't do it.  The cake didn't look very enticing to begin with.  Then, after it cooled, I put a lid on the cake pan and put it in the fridge.  The next day the cake was wet and gooey.  That may have nothing to do with the recipe, but it was a total turn off.

YUM!!! So good. I baked mine in a Bundt cake pan... layer of cake batter, layer of pie filling, layer of cake batter. Baked at 350 for about 50  minutes. Worked out very well. I topped with toasted pecans, just because that's what I had on hand. Thanks! :)

I made this tonight and it turned out very good! Instead of cherries I used a can of apple pie filling, I thought it all would of turned out better had the apples been sweeter. Over all very good and my kids love it

I was drawn in by the allure of an easy payoff, with just 5 ingredients to mix together.  It was beautiful to look at (I made it in a bundt pan), but most unfortunately, it tasted very much like the boxed mix that essentially it is.

This was disappointing. I used yellow cake mix and blueberry filling and didn't add the icing/nuts. The cake looked like it would taste good, but it was not that great. Texture wasn't too good either. I would not make this again.

Delicious, quick and easy! I omitted the nuts (my family is allergic- poor me!) and it was still wonderful. I will keep this recipe as a sure thing!

The first time I made this, I followed the recipe exactly.  I give it 3 1/2-4 stars as it is.  It's a good "base" recipe.  To make it 5 stars, I made the following modifications:  I used 3 egg whites, no yolk.  I added 1/4 cup unsweetened apple sauce to moisten the cake up.  I also added 1 tsp vanilla and 1 tsp almond extract to the batter.  Finally, instead of using milk for the glaze, I used lemon juice.  The lemony taste compliments the sweetness of the powdered sugar.  After making these modifications, I give it 5 stars.

I really don't know what is going on with some people! I got this same recipe out of Kraft's cookbook and I made it (I didn't put nuts on it) for my husband's friend. and they loved it! They keep talking about and was wondering when I was going to make it again. My mom taste and she hates coffeecake because some coffeecake is dry, but she loved this one. it was moist and really good. Some people just won't say that they did the recipe wrong and it didn't turn out right. This recipe is a winner in my book.

This is my go to recipe. It is quick, easy and delicious. I always get asked for the recipe when I bring it somewhere.
You can mix it up by changing the flavors of pie filling.  It's pretty too, and although I make for breakfast most of the time. It is good any time of day or night.
