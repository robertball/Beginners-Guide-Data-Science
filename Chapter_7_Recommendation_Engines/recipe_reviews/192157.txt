This is an easy, stick-to-your-ribs meal.  However, I would recommend one change.  If you use raw potatoes, the peppers burn before the potatoes are cooked through.  I microwaved the potatoes for a several minutes, and then I peeled and sliced them.  Cook the potatoes on medium high heat, then turn down the heat and add the peppers and sausage.

This is "giambotta" in Italian, which is where I would guess the "Jumbutt" came from. It is one of those recipes where you may throw just about anything in the pan. Leftover cooked meat, any vegetables, eggs (or not)--whatever. We always toss in some peppers, onions, pepper, fresh basil and oregano, but it's not absolutely necessary. It's great however you like it.

I used ground pork (cheaper by the pound than buying pre-seasoned "rolls of pork sausage or sausage links) that I seasoned using a seperate recipe for italian sausage. I used two red bell peppers and omitted the green (we just don't care for them), I used the last two organic red potatoes I had on hand (that I parboiled quickly--as I just stink at hashbrown potatoes when the potatoes are raw) and because I had extra vegetables I needed to use, I also added in fresh minced garlic, chopped onion, sliced mushrooms and right before adding the eggs, chopped tomato. Right before serving, I sprinkled the skillet with sharp white cheddar. Very cheap to make and I was able to stretch my skillet to feed four extra hungry people and make it a little healthier to boot. GREAT brinner side. I topped mine with a little homemade salsa. VERY, very filling. I am quite thankful for this recipe as it really saved my behind today.

I made this 20 years ago using hotdogs in place of sausage. An Italian friend taught me the recipe back then. I was looking for something simple to make for dinner tonight and came across this recipe. I had forgotten all about this dish. I'd never heard it called by this name though. Whatever it's called it's simple and satisfying. Thanks for the reminder.

My husband loves this!  I usually make it with a little less bell pepper, but I throw in other things like a zucchini or a couple chile or jalapeno peppers.

We used turkey sausage and cut out the eggs (husband doesn't like them).  It was just like a kabob to us.  Might make it again with the eggs to see if it helps. Potatoes needed more time to cook, they were a bit raw.

Made this for breakfast with a few additions and 1 subtraction.  First added another sausage, only 2 potatoes, some real bacon bits, some fresh spinach and some mozza cheese on top. I parcooked the potatoes in the microwave too for 4 minutes...good hint, went much quicker! Hubby loved it..when I asked "can't talk eating, he said...mmmm!"

I used Turkey sausage to make it a bit healthier but other than that I followed the recipe. I served this for my in-laws and they really liked it. I liked the combination of everything in one dish. I'll keep this one around for sure.

I suggest you cook and reserve the sausage, add the oil if needed and cook the potatoes, once the potatoes are almost done add the peppers.  I also added some diced onion and used yellow and orange peppers.  If you dice, instead of slice the potatoes they are easier to toss around the pan and cook fairly quickly.  I only used 2 large potatoes and that was more than enough.  I think Grandma might have been saying Jumble Skillet Scramble.   Thanks for sharing your grandmothers recipe, Julie.

Pretty good.  An quick, excellent stick to your ribs, throw what ever you have left in the fridge kind of meal.  I used onions, peppers, courgettes and a cubed leftover baked potato.  I also added some spices.
