I'm the creator of this recipe - which is actually really good - if you don't follow the instructions I wrote down.  I definately reused the "saltwater" one time and it came out really nice - so I wrote it down- but never again has it turned out at all- so if you'd like to try this recipe - discard ALL salted water and it will turn out just fine!!!  All Recipes will not let me edit the recipe - since it's already been published.  Basically ignore the part that says "reserve 1/2 cup" - throw it all away and rinse rinse rinse the salt off!!!  It also says Kosher salt - it should be Coarse salt - or Pickling Salt.  Massive typo on my part.  I like things to be fairly salty - but it's much easier to add a wee bit of salt at the end with a salt shaker to your own personal taste.  My apologies to anyone who tried the original version that was published - believe me - I tried to edit it.  It wasn't until now could we review our own recipes. Mistake 1 - Coarse Picking Salt not Kosher Salt Mistake 2 - Do not reserve any of the salt water Mistake 3 - I didn't emphasize how important it is to rinse all the salt off the vegetables. Mistake 4 - When it's time to drain everything - you can just use a plain 'ol collander over the sink.
