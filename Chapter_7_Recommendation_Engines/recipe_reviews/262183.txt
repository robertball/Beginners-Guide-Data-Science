Very tasty.  Didn't have whipping cream (don't use) so the 2 % milk was just fine.

Terrific way to prepare steak.  I followed the recipe as written with two exceptions:  1. wildideabuffalo.com sells buffalo tenderloins, which I used, in a 5oz. size, perfect for this recipe.  Wild Idea's mission is to restore the Great Plains one acre at a time by farming buffalo in a humane and environmentally and ecologically sound manner. Their meats are delicious. 2. Not having any bourbon, I used Crown Royal. The results were outstanding, and the recipe has gone directly into the special guest file.
