1.13.17   I used my Twist-n Sprout Brussels Spout corer (Christmas gift) for the first time, so getting a bowl of brussels sprout leaves was effortless.  I wanted to plump up the cranberries, so I rehydrated them in a little boiling water for a few minutes. Instead of the cinnamon pecans, I garnished with some toasted slivered almonds which I had on hand.   Very, very nice salad with lovely presentation and just the right amount of sweetness.  Definite remake here!

Thank you for this delicious simple recipe that could be morphed into an infinite variety of tasty salads.  I broke out my mandolin and sliced the sprouts into a lacy vs. leafy texture.  I had a bag of "salad topping". Comprise

I made this salad for Thanksgiving.  The flavor was lovely, subtly sweet and it was interesting to serve brussels sprouts raw.  I made the salad (including adding the dressing) a day ahead and I'm glad I did.  The dressing definitely helped soften the sprouts.  It was easy to put together.  The most time consuming part was de-coring the sprouts.  Next time I may just try a bag of shredded. Also, the amount of dressing was perfect, none left over. My only complaint is I felt the sprouts were still too chewy.  I may try a quick blanche to soften them a little more next time (like I do with my cold green bean salads).  And there will definitely be a next time; we really enjoyed this salad.

Love another yummy brussels sprouts dish! Went with blanching them first (good heads up members). Pulled out the mandolin to shred them b/c coring was taking toooo long. The syrup was a little too bold for me so I'll probably use honey or agave next time.  Will also add some jalapeno to the mix!  A great new salad option.

Wow. Wonderful light salad! I received rave reviews from the family picnic!! Only thing I changed was I blanched the brussels sprouts leaves for less than 15 seconds and then straight into an ice bath. Made the sprouts less bitter. Also I don’t care for cinnamon so I use regular slice lightly salted slivered almonds!

I made this for my family that aren't fans of brussels sprouts fans.  My husband wouldn't touch it, but my three boys and I really like it.  I would definitely make this again.

This was really good. My husband isn’t a brussel sprout fan but said, “You know it’s good when you want seconds of brussel sprouts.” The only thing I changed was the almonds.  I didn't have the cinnamon ones so I made a batch of whole sweet and spicy almonds and added those.  Delicious.  Served with salmon and for lunch the next day I put the salmon over the left over brussel sprout salad and it was delicous.

suggest mixing all ingredients except for syrup.  Add syrup 1 teaspoon at a time until sweetness desired.  1/4C Way too sweet.  May also need more oil to that much vinegar.
