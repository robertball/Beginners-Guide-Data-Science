This was my first try at making runzas, but I found the dough recipe way too wet. I ended up using six cups of flour and then a considerable amount more for rolling. But it turned out nicely. I also rolled my dough about twice as big because 4 x 4 made tiny appetizer style runzas. I wanted a meal sized runza. But that worked too. I through a half teaspoon of pepper into the meat mixture but next time I'll spice it up a bit more. It was a bit bland for our taste. But I'll definitely make these again!

I liked this recipe because it included the steps for making the bread as well as the filling (rather than using store-bought dough). It was also simple enough to customize a bit. I halved the recipe and this worked for all ingredients except the flour: I found I needed to use about 2 3/4 cups of flour to get a nice, roll-out consistency. I also used the full amount of yeast. Followed the rest of the steps, except I added salt, pepper, and a few dashes of Worcestershire sauce to the meat and put half a piece of American cheese into each Runza. I also added an egg wash and a pinch of salt on the outside of each roll for golden brown deliciousness. Just YUM. Thank you!

I really tried to stay true to the recipe, but ran out of flour!  So I used 2 cups flour, then added corn flour, rye flour, and buffalo flour till I got to a workable consistency.  I also threw in some peppers to the meat just to use them up.  I thought it turned out well, almost as good as the church ladies that make them back home

These. Were. AWESOME! The only thing I did differently was use 2 teaspoons of salt and 1 tablespoon of caraway seed, because I love caraway with cabbage, it might not be for everyone. I also brushed them with an egg wash. If you have never tried these, this in my opinion is the recipe you are going to want to use. A good stone ground mustard goes excellent with these.

I made it dairy free by putting 2/3 cup almond milk instead of powder, and increased the flour to 5 cups of bread flour.  They turned out great.

Mom made these when I was a kid. I never knew where she got the recipe since that was before internet. She never said what was inside, so imagine my surprise now when I saw it was cabbage! 

I followed the recipe, except  I used frozen bread dough. I could have rolled them a little thinner as I had a pretty good chunk of plain bread on the bottom. 

They were great, and I froze the extras.
