I liked this cookie and would recommend it for a Christmas tray. The combination of 2 chocolates, pecans, and cranberries went well together as suspected. I used sweetened cranberries and chopped a Bakers white chocolate bar, due to preferring the texture of white chocolate that has cocoa butter actually in it. Just baked they reminded me of a chewy chocolate chip cookie. Later, as they cool and are iced, they start to take on a mini bite sized scone taste. I honestly liked them without the icing, but it adds that holiday look if need be. I found that the icing equaled 1/2 tsp per cookie, if that helps. I didn't need 54 cookies. So, I used the change servings button and changed the recipe from 27 to 9 servings. I was able to yield 18 cookies, or 1.5 dozen, making that change. I baked them on a parchment lined sheet pan sprayed with PAM cooking spray. They took 14 minutes to bake.

I loved this recipe. A very good "Christmas-y" cookie, definitely.

Yummy & festive. I used almond extract in the icing and pistachios instead of pecans...the greenish color on the outside of the nuts looked really pretty with the icing and cranberries.

These are DELICIOUS~~~!!!   So easy to put together and very versatile!  Any nut would work, raisins, cranberries, chocolate chips, whatever your tastebuds desire!  I used Walnuts, Cranberries, White Chocolate chips, and a handful of mini-Milk Chocolate chips.  I added a drop of lemon extract to the glaze -- delish!!!  I thought afterward that the white chocolate chips could've been melted and used instead of the glaze also!  Making another batch tonight!

We skipped the icing, sweet enough already for our family.  Still delicious.  I also replaced the margarine with butter.  Definitely a keeper.

Very good cookie.  I opted not to do the glaze on top, as my family and I don't care for cookies to be too sweet.  Perfect as is, without, although I'm sure they might be prettier with it.  My cookies needed to bake 12 minutes, just fyi.
