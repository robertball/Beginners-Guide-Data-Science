Excellent.  Also used stew meat which yielded tender flavorful dinner with little or no fat.  Cooked potatoes in water and residue from browning meat and added them and carrots about one hour before baking done.  Just great.

Doubled the recipe - eliminated oregano.  Ribs were very flavorful and tender. Cooking liquid became fatty and would have to be de-greased for use as a gravy, which I did not do (although I am sure it would be delicious)

I didn't personally like this recipe.  Beef ribs are extremely fatty, and the wine, beef broth and oregano didn't lend that much flavor to the dish.  You can't even make gravy from the broth in the pan because of the fattiness of the ribs.  The meat was, however, very tender but I had to get it away from the fat!!

I just made these for the Allrecipes Allstar challenge and they were exceptional.  Both my hubby and I gave them 5 stars.  The meat was tender and juicy, the sauce delicious.  I did make a couple of small changes.  I thickened the sauce a little and I added onions at the beginning of the cooking time.  Will definitely make these again.  Thank you for posting the recipe.

Very tender.  Forgot the oregano but that did not make it bad, will remember it next time and make it better. Served it with garlic mashed red potatoes and the gravy it made was nice on them. Will use this recipe again.

This is one of my favorite dishes, with the changes noted.  First, you need to use short ribs.  they are one of the most flavorful cuts of meat period and the point of this dish is to slow cook them so they are very tender and cut with a fork. delicious.  2nd, double the wine/lemon/beef broth so that you have a lot of liquid to simmer the meat in.  Use a tall narrow pan to cook it if available.  in order to make the sauce thicker (which i believe it needs), make a roux to thicken it.  i like butter/flour (~1/8 cup butter, 1/4 cup flour). once the dish is completely finished cooking and ready to serve, add the roux until the sauce is a little less thick than gravy.   Finally, i like to serve this dish over sushi rice, thou mashed potatoes certainly do make plenty of sense to me :)  It would work over egg noodles also.  Enjoy.  Everyone i know that has had it this way loves it.

Loved this recipe! Leftovers were even better because I could skim out the fat. The only thing I left out was the lemon juice because I didn't have it and salt because I don't use it. I thought the bacon had enough salty flavor. I did add a small onion with the bacon.  I cooked the ribs for 1 hr 20 mins and they just fell off the bones!  Will definitely make these again!!

this turned out great! I've struggled to find a good recipe for short ribs and this was perfect! I didn't use red wine only because I didn't have any on hand but otherwise I followed the recipe. My husband loved it so this one will be going in my recipe box!

I had never made short ribs before, so I was a little unsure about taking this one on. To me, the flavors were fine- that wasn’t the issue. I just don’t think the short rib was the right cut of meat. I followed the recipe exactly, and it came out dry and chewy. I actually love beef fat (I’m weird- I know), but even the fat came out almost inedible.

Wasn't very tasty, had to add a lot of salt to get some flavor. Ended up also using a dab of BBQ sauce on my plate.
