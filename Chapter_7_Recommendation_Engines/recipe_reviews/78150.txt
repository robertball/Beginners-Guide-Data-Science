Dee-lish-us!

This recipe was my first experience with collards greens.  And am I ever glad I bumped into it.  I love to cook with beer and wine, and we were given a nice big bunch of collards from a friends' garden.  So I thought, "what the heck!"  
So, so, so glad I made this recipe.  I've made it three times so far in two weeks.  I double the cayenne since my wife and I like things on the spicier side.  I used chicken broth for one meal, and used vegetable broth for another.  All depends on what you like.  Both can be used.  I think the ingredients that really have a major effect on the flavor is the bacon and the beer.  I used a Stout beer for my  dish.  Nice and foamy, and thick.  Great, great flavor.  I also used 'real' peppered bacon from my local butcher.  Not that Oscar Mayer .  (My apologies to Oscar Mayer, but there is worlds better bacon out there.)  =)

THANK YOU FOR SHARING THIS RECIPE!  It is  easily in my top 10.

OMG! So good! I added a little lawry's season salt. Duplicated with frozen black-eyed peas-they were good also.

This recipe turned our really well.  I make collard greens often and the beer added a great flavor.  I changed two things in the recipe: I ended up using a package of salt pork instead of the smoked pork chop (the brand I use isn't very salty and ends up more like a thick cut bacon) - the other thing was to add about 6 drops of Chile Oil to my browning onions.  I like my food a little spicy and this did the trick.  This recipe is very easy and even my friend who hates cooked spinach like this.

Easy recipe, pretty good flavor.  I added more cayenne than called for because I like the spice:)
 Thanks!

Like GAgirl I thought I made dang good "greens" but this gets the blue ribbon.  I used it (minus the pork chop) for turnips and greens and it's now the "house recipe."  Only thing I'll change next time is to reduce the amount of cayenne just a smidgen.  I told my 91 year-old aunt about it and she (who taught me how to cook greens and still cooks for her son and his family) said "well, I'll just have to try that."

Thank you for sharing this recipe!!
I make this all the time now. I never use packaged bacon. Get the bacon from the deli dept. st your local grocery store. It's alot thicker and better tasting. I used a malt beer, but that's because I drink malt beers. It was just as good.

Being from the South, I thought I knew everything there was to know about making "greens"-however, the addition of the beer made them sooooo much better!  Great recipe!!!

This was a great recipe even though I ended up not having all the ingredients. I'm guessing cooked to the T it would be 5 stars. I had to forego the smoked pork chop (went bad in my fridge) and the onion (ran out!) so I ended up using a little extra bacon, cooking the greens w/the bacon grease, beer and chicken broth. IMO the beer really made the dish unique and flavorful. I also used cayenne pepper (probably more than 1/2 tsp) and added Lawry's seasoned salt as well. I can't wait to try it with the pork chop and onions!

I have made this several times and it is always great. Sometimes we use a little ham and some liquid smoke if we don't have bacon. I also cook the greens for less time since we like them a little less mushy.

I've made this recipe twice and wasn't that impressed.  The greens were just ok to me and didn't have too much flavor, we at them though, not to say they were terrible.

Yum, yum, yum!  This recipe was amazing.  The only changes I made were using salt pork (based on another review) instead of the pork chop and eliminating the bacon and using pre-made bacon pieces.  I fried a chunk of the the fat from the salt pork instead of using the bacon and then fried the onions and salt pork pieces in the grease (and tossed the extra fat after frying).  I also added a generous amount of hot sauce (Texas Pete!) to give it more of a kick.  I will definitely be making this again.

These are GREAT.  I've made them several times.  My kids never liked collards until I cooked them this way.  I prefer to use boneless smoked pork hock instead of the pork chop.  Also I add one packet each of 'Sazon-Goya Con Culantro Y Achiote' and 'Sazon-Goya Con Cilantro Y Tomate' along with the cayenne pepper.  Sometimes I also add sliced cherry tomatoes.  Always buy a 6 pack of Guiness brand beer in this.  One bottle for the collards, five for the cook....DELICIOUS!

Delicious! I'd noticed this recipe a couple of weeks ago when I was looking for something a little different to do with the collards growing in our garden.  I made it because at the time I had a six pack of beer but only one can of chicken stock.  I used some pork I'd set aside for stir fry rather than a smoked pork chop.  And, I put the recipe together in a large pan then transferred the ingredients to a large oval crock pot.  It was done in 2.5 hours on high.

This was my first time making collard greens.  I actually did not think I even liked them before, but somehow got a craving for them.  

This recipe was wonderful!  I attempted to guesstimate the cayenne pepper measurement, and got a bit heavy-handed, so they were pretty spicy, but it grew on me!  I enjoyed the burning sensation.  :)  

I will certainly be making these again, although I won't be taking the leftovers to work, since everyone thought I was having a liquid lunch!

I had never cooked collards before but I like how this recipe turned out. I had to make some substitutions since I did not have everything on site..I used a small amount of cured chorizo sausage in place of the meat and it added a nice flavor. Don't think I'll be making these greens again, but not because of the recipe. They just didn't bring me the "southern comfort" I was looking for.

I used a dark, malty porter called Blackjack (Lefthand Brewing Co) for this recipe and it was fantastic.  Smelled great while cooking.  Use pork sausage instead of chops...and serve it in/with tortillas.  This recipe rocks.

I thought this was a great improvement on my normal stir-fried or boiled collard greens. I did not add the bacon. Added a couple chopped up fresh jalapenos to kick up the heat a bit, used a light beer...in retrospect, probably should've used a beer with a little bit more flavor (something sweet, a chocolate stout perhaps).

Next time, make the collards, drink the beer. The beer made the pot likker (note Southern spelling) kind of fuzzy. I also substituted Louisiana hot sauce for the cayenne because it's easier to control the amount of "hot" you want, and the vinegar adds its own element. Good dish, but save the beer for the cook.

If you don't have a smoked pork chop, you can omit it or replace it with pretty much any other kind of pork, like diced ham or Italian sausage.

Greens are one of my favorite vegetables! Borrowed a beer from my sweety pie and these came together in a heart beat! I was having smoked meat with them so I left out the pig parts, but did saute them in bacon fat. Thank you JAVONNES!

Didn't have pork (which probably didn't help) so cooked with extra bacon (Collards were still a little tough after 45 minutes. Next time I will try using a different beer, including the pork and will cook in the slow cooker for a couple of hours
