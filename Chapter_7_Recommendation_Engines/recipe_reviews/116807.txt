Excellent! Yes, the cooking time is clearly off for the steaks...ours took about 9 minutes per side on medium high heat(it was a thick one.)

Kelly, I was happy to see a ribeye recipe here that was not marinated.A ribeye is a very tender tasty steak. I would marinate less tender steaks but not ribeyes.I am making these tonight over applewood, sprinkled with a charcoal seasoning and grilled portabellas.Dot with butter when finished. Yum!

Grilled the steaks. This was a yummy recipe but I think the sauce got a little salty. Next time, I will use a low-sodium broth and Portabello mushrooms.

Very good! I didn't use rib eyes :( I had eye of round steaks. This was a very good recipe anyway! Loved the mushrooms. For the sauce though I didn't have beef broth so I used 2 T chicken stock and 1 T Worchestshire Sauce. Thanks for the recipe.

Used this recipe for Christmas Eve dinner and the steaks were wonderful!  My steaks were pretty thick so I browned well in butter, then moved to the oven at 300 for 10 min or so, which I made the sauce.  Sauteed fresh mushrooms in butter, removed the mushrooms, then sauteed chopped garlic from the jar, and combined both with some water and beef bouillon granules for the sauce (added a bit more butter :).  Next time I will put the steaks in the oven for only 5 min or lower the oven temp as they were more on the medium-well to well-done side, but still juicy, flavorful, tender, and delicious.  My daughter scarfed it up and asked me to definitely make these again.  Thanks so much for a 5 star recipe.  Yum.

I have never purchased rib eye steaks before, but bought them because my grocery was having a really good sale on them. Not knowing what to do with them and no access to a grill right now, I decided on this recipe and was not disappointed. These steaks were so tender and tasty. My garlic got a little overdone, but that was my fault. Next time I will be sure to clean out my skillet and turn down the heat after browning my steaks. I browned them for about 5-6 mins. per side for them to be medium to medium-well. Very good!

I was looking for a recipe in order to pan fry the chuck eye steaks that I just bought at our local grocery store for $3.99/lb. (Chuck eye steaks are well marbled and are very similar to rib eyes, but much lower priced!)  This recipe did the trick.  I used Penzeys Chicago Steak Seasoning instead of the salt and pepper to season the steaks and it was out of this world.  This recipe is a great alternative to grilling.

These ribeyes were good, and I think the mushrooms added a really nice flavor. As long as you have a good cut of meat, these will turn out to be great.

Good way to cook the steaks, but the mushroom/garlic did not turn out well.  As sonther reviewer stated, the burnt garlic taste hurts the experience.

Delishish! The only changes I made were I used jarred mushrooms and minced garlic.
Soo good!

Loved this dish.  Easy to make, in record time, with great flavor from the mushrooms.  We used portabellas, sliced.  I added the garlic back in with the beef broth.  It did take 7-9 min per side to cook the ribeyes.

Made this for Sunday dinner with baked potato and salad.  EVERYONE loves it!  Best steak I have ever cooked.  I used minced garlic and sliced mushrooms from a jar.  Still turned out great and was very easy to make. 5 STARS!

Good flavor! Although, I couldn't really taste the garlic. Maybe I will add more if I make this again.

This recipe was very appealing to me, I am not a steak lover by any means, however DH would eat steak three times a day, if I fed it to him. I made this recipe exactly as written, and I thought it was a wonderful change from the typical marinated steaks. I will make again, but this time warn DH that there is garlic    shivers mixed in with his fresh sliced mushrooms..OOPS! (And he is not a really big garlic lover like I am). Thanks for sharing your wonderful recipe.

These turned out really well, I didn't change a thing except the cooking time.  (I think 2 minutes per side must be a typo - they are still raw at that point)  I liked the addition of the beef broth, it gave it a little extra flavor besides the garlic.  Thanks for the recipe!

My husband said it was better than the Outback steaks he's had.  I was a little worried once I took the steaks off the pan and started cooking the garlic (I used 1 1/2 tsp. of chopped garlic from a jar)because it started getting a little burnt, but it just made it more flavorful! I will definately use this again.
