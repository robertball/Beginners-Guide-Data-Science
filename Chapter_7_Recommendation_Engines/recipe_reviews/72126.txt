My husband and I made these last night with 16 pounds of peaches.  My parents have fruit trees, so I needed to find a way to easily use up a lot of peaches and we've already made peach preserves, so this was it.  I've never had pickled peaches, but these are excellent.  Just the right amount of spice, but we wound up with a lot of extra liquid when putting these in the jars, which I prefer to not enough any day!  My four year old daughter had 3 peaches this morning when I was just trying them to see how they tasted.  Thanks for a great recipe, I'm sure we'll make this next time there is another bumper crop of peaches.

2008 Update: Our peach tree produced a record crop this year and I made these with a friend.  We used over 100 pounds of peaches for this recipe and are excited about our stash.(and tired too! :))  For each 4 pounds of peaches you can plan on getting about 4 pints (2 quarts).  We multiplied the fruit by 5 for every batch we made (20 pounds) and only multiplied the syrup by 4 and still had plenty of liquid for canning.  Again, an excellent recipe--especially if you have a lot of peaches you need to use up.

This was my first time making pickles peaches and they are delicious. I did mine in halves and added an anise seed pod to each jar along with the cinnamon stick and cloves...so pretty!  My mom said they were just  like her grandma used to make :)

My daddy just loved these!!.  I had remembered my uncle and my daddy talking about my grandmother making these and how much they missed them. Boy was daddy happy when he opened the jar!  He said this recipe was a keeper.

It's exactly like my mother used to make.  She used white cling peaches and they were wonderful.  Point of reference, I'm now 74 years old and this is the first time I've seen this recipe.If any of you have access to white cling peaches, I urge you to try this recipe.  I'm sending it to my daughter in law.  They have a very small (personal orchard) orchard with a couple of peach trees, among the apple trees.  I hope she will give this a try.  Thanks for warming an "old" gal's heart with this bit of nostalgia!

I have never eaten pickled peaches besides the ones they have sold at grocery stores.  I decided to make these because they looked really good.  These were simply amazing!  My grandma wanted the recipe, and we're making them tonight for the second time.    We put two cinammon sticks in each jar and left them overnight.  We couldn't stop eating them the next day, and cleaned off eight peaches in one day.  Thank you for this recipe.  I'll be making these for Thanksgiving.

This was so easy and tasted great, even if I looked in my cinnamon jar and found nothing there. So I put in some powdered cinnamon and just threw in a handful of cloves. Still great. Don't think they'll last long, so have to make another batch!

This recipe was my first try at canning and because of it's simplicity it (incorrectly) made me assume all canning was going to be a breeze. This is my second year using this recipe and my batches get bigger each time. My husband loves these and gets rather grumpy when I share w/ friends. I find it helpful to keep in mind that one pint jar will usually hold two peaches. Yes, this recipe does give you extra syrup. Today I made five batches but only made three batches of syrup. I know 23 pints of pickled peaches seems like a lot but once you taste them you'll understand why they go so fast.

I've not canned pickled peaches before. Are these peaces left whole with the seed inside? I don't see anywhere mentioned to slice or pit the peaches before canning. I'm confused about this.

Beyond fantastic!  I had some fresh ginger so sliced that up too.  Added cloves, cinnamon, ginger to spice bag and boiled with peaches (cut up peaches).  Did a small batch of 4 cups.  Need more peaches!

These were very good, they came out slightly tangy, but not overwhelmingly vinegary.  A nice changeup from our traditional canned peaches.  Thanks!

I loved this recipe and some jars to our Church sale.  Great success.  I only took 'some' because some turned brown.  I need advise as to how to correct that.  Anyone?

SIMPLY AMAZING FLAVOR! I USED APPLE CIDER VINEGAR, 3 C SUGAR,5 LBS PEACHES, 2 CINNAMON STICKS EACH & ADDED THE CLOVES ALONG WITH PEACHES. I STILL NEEDED MAYBE 1/2 LB MORE OF PEACHES AND  HAD TO ADD A LITTLE H20 TO ONE JAR.  THE 4 LBS ONLY YIELDED 3 FULL QUART JARS BUT I WANTED MORE PEACHES PER JAR.  THANKS FOR SHARING. DELISH!

These were absolutely delicious!  And Easy!  The only thing I changed is I only used 3 cups of sugar rather than 4, and it was plenty sweet for me.  The only other thing that I would change, that someone else here mentioned as well...I'll probably double or triple the fruit for this recipe's amount of liquid.  There's ALOT of syrup in the jar, and as tasty as it is, I think I'd like more peaches than syrup.  Other than those two mods...these were as close to perfect as you can get.

Spectacular!  I canned these for the first time two years ago.  I tasted while making, and I was instantly in love.  I refused to give away any jars, but finally relented to one for my father on his birthday, and one for my doctor that saved my life...BUT THAT'S it.  I hid them in my laundry room craft cupboard.  
Yes, they ARE that good!  Never had them before that first canning day.  Making them again right now, and wholeheartedly expect to hide these as well.  

P.S.  My grown son found one of my jars in the cupboard, and proceeded to consume almost the whole thing in less than three minutes time!  I made the huge 2 QT jars, too!

These are fantastic!  I've never had pickled peaches before, but they are amazing.  It's like peach cobbler just without with cobbler.  I don't like a strong clove flavor, so I just boiled the cloves with the pickling juice instead of putting one in each peach.  Amazing.

Great recipe! This was my first time making and trying pickled peaches. After reading a few reviews it decide to follow ELISAW's suggestion due to the amount of syrup leftover. I mare 5 lbs of freshly picked peaches and was able to canned 6 pints, 2 of which I added a star of anise due to a review I read but sorry, I was not a fan of that. Today I opened a left over jar that I had in the fridge and after eating the delicious peach that was left in the jar I realized that there's one serious problem with this recipe. That is that I wish I could pack more peaches in each jar. :) thank you for sharing this recipe and I'm looking forward to going back to the farm to pick more peaches, I want to make more on top of trying other canning recipes. Once again, thank you.

Pickled peaches sounded strange to me, but I'll glad I made this.  We love slicing these up and putting over ice cream.

These are awesome. Just like my Mom made when I was young.  My 91 year old sister was thrilled to have them again. The only change I would do next time is to cut back on the cloves.  They turned out perfect.

I made this today  so I haven't actually tasted the "finished" product...but tasted the syrup and peaches before I processed them and they were delicious.  I tripled the fruit (12 lbs) and 2.5x the syrup and still had loads of extra syrup.  Next time I will only double it.  My yield was 8 pint jars and 2 quart jars, but I think I overfilled a couple of them so it should have yielded a couple more pint jars.

Meh at best.  Flavor was just "off" and also wayyy too sweet, and I have the biggest sweet-tooth on the planet.  I will keep looking

Left out the clove altogether. Turned out just like my grandmother used to make. About to make another batch.

I've never had a pickled peach or made any, until I seen this recipe!  It's a whole new taste for peaches!  My granddaughter told me, it was Christmas in a jar!  I did do one thing wrong from the recipe...I didn't have any cheesecloth so I just put the spices in the pot and then into the jars with the fruit.  This made very, very spicy peaches.  They are still very good, but I would not advise doing this.  My daughter just loved them, something new and different for the table!

These peaches are delish! First time I have had pickled peaches but will not be the last.  There is plenty of syrup so I just kept adding another batch of peaches to use it up.

I used apple cider vinegar instead. For the cloves, we put them in a tea ball, since the clove seemed a bit strong. For the syrup we added 3 cups of sugar and 1/4 cup of honey.  Tastes just like how grandma use to make them!
