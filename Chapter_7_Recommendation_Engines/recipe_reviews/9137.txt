I make a very similar GBC. 

I usually use 1 1/2 cans of condensed cream of mushroom soup and 3 cans of green beans to get a better consistancy. I also mix in mild cheddar cheese. I also top the casserole with cheese & the french fried onions. 

Also my bake time is longer than the 30 mins (likely due to the increased beans n soup). More like 45 mins. 

Everyone likes the way I make mine so no complaints here!

Try this recipe with Cream of Chicken soup as a substitue or in addition to the Mushroom; guaranteed hit!  I make it every year and its the first dish gone!

We really enjoyed this recipe. I did substitute sour cream for the milk, and added a tiny bid of chopped red onion just for flavor. Thanks for sharing!!!

Be sure and thaw the green beans first (just put them in a colander and run some hot water over them).  I used lowfat soup, skim milk, and added 1/8 tsp. pepper.  Perfect!  Thanks for the recipe!

My fiancee wanted green beans with dinner last night and I was looking for a quick and easy recipe to dress the beans up a little bit.  This recipe was a winner.  It just took a few minutes to put it together and I already had all the ingredients on hand.  It was so simple, but tasted wonderful.  Exactly what I was looking for.  The only change I made was not to top it of with onions at the end.  I didn't want the onions to overpower the green beans.  Thank you for sharing this recipe.  It will become a favorite in our house.

Delicious!  Always on the table for holiday dinners.  I have used Cream of Celery soup and Cream of Chicken soup.  It's all good but I like Cream of Mushroom best.

Quick and simple. Easy to throw together, Yet as tasty as any other green bean casserole I've had. Some times I add a bit of sour cream to this recipe and/or grated cheese. I make this all the time.

This is a great recipe because it is so easy. I use 3 cans of beans, a handful of shredded cheddar and I add about 1/2 tsp of Onion powder and 3/4 tsp of garlic powder to the wet mixture before mixing into the beans...I find this adds a ton more flavour.

Classic recipe. I substituted the French-friend onions by some pan friend onions to cut back on the fat. The baking time needs to be far longer than 30 minutes. After half an hour, the beans are still very crunchy and half frozen. It took almost 1.5 hours before it was well done. However, taste was very good when it was finally done.

It was great.  I added some salt as well - I had company over when I fixed it.  My guests said it was the best green bean casserole they had ever tasted.

I make this all the time! I use fat free milk and often add cheddar cheese and/or bacon for extra flavor. If using frozen green beans, make sure to defrost them first!

I have been making GBC since I was a child but looked up a recipe for this past thanksgiving. We were going to be having a lot of guests and I wanted to make sure the GBC was the best it could be. Even though it had great ratings the small changes to my original recipe didn't amount to much improvement. You can drop the milk and just add 1 can of cream of mushroom for every 1 can of green beans and get similar if not better results. Of course add the pepper. I gave it 3 stars because while there was no complaints there were no compliments either. I have in the past made it with croutons or bread crumbs on top and it tastes just as good. If you don't have the french fried onions in your pantry don't hesitate to substitute.

Doubled this recipe and used half cream of mushroom & half cream of chicken soup (celery soup would also work great) because my nieces hate mushrooms. They never knew they ate some!

Rinsed and thawed the green beans a little first.  Mixed this up the night before (minus the fried onions) and kept in fridge.  Added onions and cooked the next day.  I substituted sour cream for milk and didn't like that taste so next time I'll try with milk.

Rinsed and thawed the green beans a little first.  Mixed this up the night before (minus the fried onions) and kept in fridge.  Added onions and cooked the next day.  I substituted sour cream for milk and didn't like that taste so next time I'll try with milk.

awesome recipe...     I like using fresh string beans. Boil them until they are almost done and then use them for the casserole.     I also like using cream of mushroom soup with garlic to give it more flavor. I add a can of sliced mushrooms to the mix too (4 oz).

I made this for two different family Christmas parties and it was a hit!  I still can't believe how easy it was to throw together.  I used frozen french cut beans, thawed and drained and replaced the milk with sour cream.  We had to travel and had limited oven use so we threw everything in a crock pot.  I cooked for about an hour on high, turned it down to low for an hour and kept it at warm while we served it.  I will be making this again and again.

Instead of regular Cream of Mushroom soup, I either use Garlic Roasted Cream of Mushroom Soup or just add some garlic powder when stirring up the casserole.

yummy and easy. I did 2/4 milk and 1/4 sour cream.  It is a good base to play from. I add some Red Pepper for flavor and real grilled onions for a fresh taste and I LOVE onions.

Used cream of chicken and fresh green beans (boiled them first so they would be soft.) Quick and easy recipe. Bf loved it.

good recipe!  Be sure to use enough green beans, though... my turned out a little soupier than I'd like, but I didn't quite have enough for the huge batch I was making.

I liked this recipe, although I found it to be a bit too creamy.  I think I'll add more green beans next time so it tastes like a legitimate vegetable side dish and not another fattening side dish! :)  (Even though I used low-fat cream of mushroom soup!).

This is the 'standard' recipe, one of my old standbys, especially for holidays and potlucks.  It's super easy, cheap to make (maybe $6-8).  Do note, however, if you're a pig like me and use a little extra on the french fried onions,  this is super-fattening (15g in the soup, the box of onions, 84g).  Unfortunately, I'm not the best at self-portion-control, so it is probably good that I only make this for 'special' occasions, in general!

A CLASSIC - it is always requested for holiday dinners.  I like this dish because it is easy to prepare ahead of time.  I will often mix it up the day before a big dinner and I guess that the frozen beans thaw a bit in the refrigerator that way.  Even if I bake it right away, I have never had a problem using frozen beans.

Delicious!!  This is the best green been casserole I've had.  Simple, yet everyone at the table loved it.  I'm going to use this with broccoli next, I'm sure that will be excellent too.
Thanks for the great recipe.

I made 20 servings on this recipe for our Thanksgiving luncheon at work. I used 18 oz of french fried onions (more than the recipe called for because I like to cover the entire top) and about a cup of milk. The recipes for 20 servings calls for 2 1/2 cups of milk but I chose to use only 1 so the casserole wouldn't be too soupy. I got many compliments and everyone seemed to love it.

Fresh chopped asparagus can be substituted for the green beans.  Do not cook the asparagus ahead of time as it cooks perfectly in the oven.  Sauted green peppers are also a great addition.

I used precooked frozen beans and this was a great recipe to use up a bag of frozen beans that had been in the bottom of the freezer, will most certainly make again.

A nice, basic green bean casserole. We used fewer dry onions than the recipe calls for, since I thought the onion taste would be overwhelming. Cream of mushroom soup works great in this recipe.

I am on a very limited budget, and needed something good for a potluck yesterday. It also needed to be quick and easy due to making it after church for an afternoon dinner. This was PERFECT ! I added small pearl onions , used condensed milk from another recipe I was making, and about 1/2 of a ham steak (diced) mixed in. I used 2 cans of french cut green beans, (drained),  but it seemed a bit soupy, so I also added 1/2 bag of frozen french cut beans for consistancy. I used 1 1/2 cans of the french onions mixed in, (3 oz cans). Baked for 45 min due to added ingredients, then sprinkled some shredded cheddar and remaining french onions on top. Return to oven for an additional 5 to 8 min. Delicious ! This was the first empty empty dish up there ! Everyone loved it ! I will make it again for a Church potluck next weekend !

A wonderful, classic, GBC recipe. I've only made it once so far, but after reading some of the reviews, next time I might try mixing cheese in, and adding more soup/beans. The onions definitely are a must-have. You won't have leftovers! :)

This is similar to what I make...but for added flavor I add pieces of bacon on top.  This is a favorite for all my relatives.  I make every Thanksgiving and Christmas.

Very simple and quick recipe.  Make sure you season it well.  If you have any dairy adverse eaters, you might want to use less milk--will be just as good.  This tastes even better a day or so later.

I wasn't impressed with this recipe.  I thought it was much to bland and the green beans turned out crunchy.  I should have taken the advice of other reviewers to thaw the green beans first or used canned green beans instead.  Next time I'll also add a little salt and maybe less milk so the cream of mushroom soup doesn't lose its flavor so much.

Try it with the cream of mushroom soup with garlic and some fresh garlic and chopped onion. Then it's 5 stars!

I made it with fat-free cream cheese and sour cream and it still tasted great!  Also sprinkled mozzerella cheese on the top and broiled in the oven for a few minutes to give a nice crispy and cheesey top to it.

I personally dislike green beans, whoever, my kids and husband love this.  I took the suggestions of a few different reviews. I add 1 tsp of garlic powder and 1 tbsp of soy sauce. I cut down on the milk a little bit and use a bit of sour cream.  I add sauteed mushrooms or a can of the sliced mushrooms.  My 8 year old loves it.  Asks for seconds!

I made this using cream of chicken instead of mushroom, considering I don't care for them. I also added a cheese blend and cheddar fried onions with the milk and cooked for 40 minutes. It come out excellent.

It's hard to go wrong with green bean casserole. I followed the recipe verbatim and this made an excellent tasting (and easy to prepare) side dish. This would possibly be even better with fresh green beans.

Classic and yummy, but not as flavorful as I would have liked.  I had to add quite a lot of pepper.  It feels like it's missing an ingredient...
