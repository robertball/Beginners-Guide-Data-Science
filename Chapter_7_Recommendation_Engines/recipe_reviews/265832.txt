This turned out pretty good. It was a little too sweet for our taste so next time I might use a tomato sauce instead of the ketchup. All in all good recipe and one that is super simple to make.

i think if i got the thighs with skin and toasted it under the broiler to make it crunchy it might taste perfect.

Not much.  Too tangy.  Chicken turned out too tough.

The sauce was excellent!  As with all my recipes I changed it up a bit.  Put some onions and peppers at the base of the casserole dish, used some Chinese 5-spice as a rub and baked a little longer.  My family is older so threw in some crushed red pepper for a LITTLE zip, not much.  Delicious!

Not gourmet, but just a wonderful blend of flavors for a family dinner.  I used a half of chicken and cut into pieces.  I did everything they said except I left out the onion.  I can't imagine it would have made it any better.  EASY, especially when we are all cooking so much vs making reservations!  I served with jasmine and wild rice and broccoli .  If you are looking for a quick dinner with a bunch of taste, this is it!!!

Perfect meal for a busy night. I thought I had apricot jam in the fridge and was wrong it was orange marmalade. So I used that instead. The glaze was a little sweet but over plain long grain brown rice it balanced out nicely. Delicious!

I gave this 5 stars cause it was pretty tasty and EASY. Some nights that's more than enough;-) You could even prep the chicken ahead of time make the sauce and start cooking as soon as the oven preheat after you get home. Per another reviews advice I used tomato sauce in place of ketchup and I'm glad I did it would have been too sweet for us. I also used a bit more soy sauce but I love soy sauce so I just cut back on the salt before baking the chicken. Made lots of sauce that was great on rice. Will make this again for an easy good family dinner. Thanks!
