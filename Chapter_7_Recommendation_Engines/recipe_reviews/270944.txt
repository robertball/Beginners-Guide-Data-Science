I reduced the sriracha to about a teaspoon (we are delicate) but followed the recipe exactly as written otherwise. I don’t know how many recipes I’ve tried trying to get this exact taste and texture but my search is over because this is perfect. The only thing we did wrong was eat it too fast - we didn’t let it cool. But when we were eating the rest out of the instapot like cavemen, the sauce was amazing. Adding to my life forever.

Typically, the first time I will try a recipe as written,as I did in this case. Then tweak it to my taste. The only changes to this one next time will be to cut back on the sriracha a bit. Only because my wife isn’t as big into spicy as I am. Tasty...

Fussy recipe. Easier to saute chicken in a frying pan. The sauce however was very good.

It was delicious! Even my kids liked it. I made sesame giner rice with it, And added more Siracha and Honey to the recipe it was very good. I would recommend this.

I made this dish this evening in my Instant Pot, (3qt. version).
It was delicious. I will make this again.
To start with I halved the recipe because I am only cooking for one. I substituted Tabasco for Siracha. I am not a fan of Siracha. I also added 1TBS of Red Pepper flakes, because I like it spicy. 
I served mine with white rice, and some stir-fried veggies. This will be a go to recipe because it is easy to make, and very versatile if you like to experiment.

I raised my eyebrows a bit at this being an instant pot recipe. But I thought, why not.  Now while the sauce itself is great, this doesn't belong in an instant pot.  It burned.  Why?  Because of the sauce being a very sugary sauce.  While looking at the reviews it may have worked for others, for me though, it didn't.  So be cautious.  Some things unfortunately just don't work well in an Instant Pot.

I liked it. Left out the sriracha because my wife doesn't like spicy and just added some hot sauce to my rice before spooning the mixture over it.

I thought this was really good. I added just a little hot sauce because we aren’t big on spicy. I might also add more honey next time as my husband thought it could have been sweeter. But I liked it just as it was.

Made the recipe as is - great flavor!  Right after the cooking was done I added cut up raw broccolli and red peppers and stirred it around for a minute so that they got cooked a bit in the heat. Veggies had perfect texture with a crunch!

Made exactly as written. Got the burn notice on the instant pot before it would even pressurize. Tried again and got another burn notice. By then it was cooked, but it was flavorless so I will not attempt this one again. Bummer!

This is the first recipe I made in my new instant pot. I, and my family, thought it was wonderful. I did not have fresh garlic or Sriracha, so I substituted powdered garlic and about a 1/4 cup of chopped up jalapeno slices. Very flavorful and just enough kick. My son said it would have been better with the Sriracha, but I was impressed. I will definitely make this recipe again.

This came out really good and the whole family enjoyed it. I used 1 tbsp of Sriracha and tapioca flour instead of corn starch. The texture of the chicken and sauce was great. I was easy to make and I’ll definitely do it again.

Great recipe!   The only change I made was to add some red pepper flakes because we like spicy.   This is my new favorite chicken recipe.  Thanks so much for sharing!

This was fantastic! I did however alter it a bit-  1/3 cup honey, 1 Tbls Sriracha sauce, and 1 Tbls Sesame Seed Oil. Otherwise I made it as is...my wife couldn’t wait for leftovers!

Made as directed without changes. Delicious! Unfortunately calorie wise, since this is fried, not great for those on a diet!

Delicious!  I didn't have any sriracha sauce but it still had great flavor.

Used chicken thighs and it came out ok.  The sauce could us a bit more spice, ginger maybe. Will be making again. Very easy.

So much flavor!  I lightened up on the sriracha for the group I was feeding, but I plan on going spicier next time!  Easy and a crowd pleaser!
