I make double the recipe,  minus mushrooms, add 1/2 chopped green bell pepper, 1/4 cup dry minced onions, 8 eggs, regular mayo not sweet. 
Season with salt, and Tony Chachere's. WOW it is good. Cook 45 mins.

I used red bell pepper instead if mushrooms.  My husband thought it was surprisingly sweet.  I didn't notice that so much.  I also used triple cheddar cheese because I couldn't find double.

This is a great recipe that my whole family, including my picky toddler, loves! I like to add finely chopped ham to the quiche as well. I don't usually measure my vegetables, I just guess at what looks about right, and it always turns out delicious!

Loved this recipe!  For mushrooms, onions, broccoli I just filled up my 1 cup measuring cup all the way which is a little more than a cup.  Also I used Kraft Fat Free Cheddar Cheese and added some Kraft (Low Fat) Pizza (Moz & Provolone Mix) Cheese so it wouldn't taste funky.  Love this!  My Dad who isn't a fan of quiche because of seasoning/salt overload, loved this!!! :)  Have 2/3 left, and look forward to eating it later this month!

I followed the recipe to a T and it was perfect!  I also used farm fresh eggs which made it all the better.  I will make this over and over.  I'm sure it is amazing with different ingredients added as well!

I agree with a previous commenter that you don't need a deep dish pie shell -- I had to add more egg mixture to fill it up.

I really enjoyed this one.  I did add extra cheese on top after it came out of the oven. Definitely needs a deep dish crust.

This recipe was good! My mom wanted the presence of more meat though, so we may use sausage crumbles next time. 

This recipe is a keeper!!!

This was my first time making a quiche and it turned out pretty well.  I didn't have Miracle Whip on hand so I had to use reg mayo.  Other than that I followed the directions exactly and we all enjoyed it.  I have one child that will not eat eggs, but she ate every bite of this.  Thanks for the recipe!

Only 4 stars as I did switch out some ingredients. I have never made quiche before, and this turned out great! It was the answer to "What's for dinner?" when I had only a hodge podge of ingredients.

My changes: I used half of a red bell pepper instead of the mushrooms, and I substituted regular Best Foods Mayonnaise for the Miracle Whip. Also I used a standard frozen pie crust, not deep dish. 

Mine almost burned when I cooked it for 40 minutes, so I would suggest checking it at 30 minutes.

Would have been great as is, but I had to use what was on hand.  No mushro0oms.  Add cup of Cauliflower.  Steamed cauliflower and broccoli in microwave then added them to the onion saute.  used half mexican blend cheese and half cheddar.  Regular mayo.  Mixed in ground pepper.  Deep dish crust (filled it just fine)  Added extra cheese on top 10 min before it was done.

My first (very) successful quiche...went with what I had on hand, no mushrooms, but added finely diced green pepper cooked with the onion (red and white sweet onion) reg mayo, sharp cheddar...and I doubled it to make two.  Fabulous and easy to work around what you have. baked up firm and wonderful!

First time made and tasted quiche. Easy to make and I loved it!  Wow.  I put in a mix of co-jack cheese.  I think you could probably put what ever cheese you like  in it.

Thanks for the recipe! I used refrigerated pie crust, not deep dish, and it turned out perfectly--probably depends on the size of eggs you use.  I also added ham, chopped green pepper, and chopped provolone.  This was my first quiche, glad I found such a versatile recipe.

The only changes I made to this recipe were that I used mayonnaise instead of miracle whip (I hate miracle whip and never buy it) and I made my own pie crust. This turned out far better than I expected. I had some friends over for brunch and this quiche was a big hit. It was gone long before the other meaty quiche I made. I am usually not a fan of broccoli in Quiche, but I chopped the broccoli into small pieces so it wasn't overpowering. I also used sliced baby portabella mushrooms. DELICIOUS!!!!

FYI - I needed the deep dish crust - it was almost brimming over. The only changes I made to the recipe were I did not have the mushrooms, I used a 10 oz. box of thawed/drained chopped broccoli. For flavor I added black pepper, two garlic gloves and a little bit of chopped fine basil and parsley from the garden.

I've made this recipe many times using the exact measurements in the recipe, but changing out vegetables with what I have on hand. 

Today I doubled the recipe using onion, sweet peppers and broccoli.  The ingredients filled 2 9" deep dish 
pie crusts. 

It's a great recipe, easy and quick to make. My family loves it.  Thank you for this one!

Made it today for my church group. Everyone loved it! Had to add a little more milk,it was very thick. I think I'll try cooking some red pepper with the other vegs to give it some color.

Perfect w/changes, but probably a perfect original. Didn't have mushrooms on hand, but added 8oz chopped ham and a little jar of pimentos for additional color. I used up some half and half instead of milk, and my crust was not frozen. I seasoned w/Italian Seasoning. Added about 15 extra minutes cooking time. Don't tell Mom, but this was the best quiche I ever tasted. Will probably use exact changes next time, depending on what's on hand. Thanks for the recipe!

Very good!  I made exactly as written except used real Mayo and shredded sharp cheddar, since that's what I had on hand.  Next time, I would add some salt and pepper to taste before baking.  I am adding this to our rotation!

SO GOOD!!! Thank you!!! I have researched other versions of Broccoli Quiche and a common problem reviewers had is that the broccoli makes the quiche a bit watery. The fact that you saute the veggies first before baking prevents this.

Very tasty!  I did use canned mushrooms and regular mayo, as that is what I had on hand, but it was still very good.  I also added some chopped red and green bell pepper.  I was able to fit it all in a regular pie crust, no need for a deep dish.  I also only cooked it for 30 minutes, but my oven tends to run hotter than normal.

Worked pretty well. Super easy.  The family was quick to offer alternative ingredient suggestions.  Will most likely modify the next time around. But there WILL be a next time.

Horrible. I have tried many, many quiche recipe's on this site that are much better. This had absolutely no flavor at all. Very bland and a waste of ingredients.This one is definitely not worth even a 3 star rating. Sorry.

I made this for my family.  Used a little more steamed broccoli than called for and also added a bit of cooked, drained bacon.  Used real mayo instead of miracle whip.  My family really liked this and it seemed more healthy than other quiche recipes.  Thanks!

Just tried it- I made one cheddar broccoli and another mushroom spinach. The deep dish crust seemed to work just fine. I was a little worried at first after reading other reviews. The crust was a bit crumbly at the edges- you'd probably want to place it in a pan or larger dish to carry. Easy to make. My coworkers enjoyed it too!

After having yummy mini quiche at an office function a few days ago, I decided to make one for our family dinner last night. After looking up this recipe, I was happy to see that I basically had all the ingredients but would have to swap out some of what was required for what I had on hand. I used shredded sharp cheddar and parmesan cheeses, and added a teeny bit of bottled crushed garlic and some fresh parsley .

I hadn't made quiche since high school cooking class and my teenage daughters were buzzing around the kitchen teasing me by asking if I knew what I was doing. Well, when I took that bad boy out the oven, my hubby and aforementioned teasing daughters were saying 'Hmmm!' because it looked so yummy and didn't even want to wait to let it set! When I cut and served it up, the family LOVED it and came back for seconds. 

This morning we had just enough left over to heat up in the toaster oven for a delicious breakfast. The kids were disappointed when it ran out so tomorrow I'm going to use the second pie crust I have and whip us up another one. This recipe really is foolproof and so simple! Also, like I said, leftovers make for a really quick, nutritious breakfast. Thanks for the great recipe!!!

Took this to a pie party.  Wanted to make a pie that wasn't sweet and this worked out PERFECT!  I used thawed out frozen broccoli.  Worked just as good.

It is an excellent base recipe! I substituted shittake mushrooms for regular mushrooms and added some spices (garlic powder, parsley, salt and pepper) and then it was amazing.

Made this yesterday morning for breakfast. This is the first time I've ever made a quiche and it was so delicious! It was quite easy, too. About 10mins of prep, then I cooked it right away. Will definitely make a couple to freeze over the next few holiday weeks. I will say this, it is a great base recipe. I think you could add probably use any veggies you like. I would also say, at least for my oven, 40-45 minutes is too long. I set the timer for 35 mins and it was too golden brown. I think 25 mins would have been perfect. Will definitely be making this again soon!

Really great recipe! I used mayonaise made with olive oil instead of miracle whip and added one slice of 1/2 inch thick cut ham. Made my own flaky pie crust and it turned out super yummy. Wonderful!

Great base recipe.  I used regular Mayo (not a fan of Miracle Whip), regular cheddar/colby/monterey jack cheese, a little red bell pepper, and a generous amount of freshly ground black pepper.  The filling was the perfect amount. It received rave reviews from my husband and kids.
