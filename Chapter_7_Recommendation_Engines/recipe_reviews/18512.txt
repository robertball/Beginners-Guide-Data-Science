This is a simple recipe but I had a hard time working with it.  I tried to braid the ropes but they kept breaking (even after adding a bit more flour).  I finally just put the "snakes" ina coil, being sure to wet it as I went and it came out fine.  A little lopsided but the family was impressed on Thanksgiving that I had made the bowl.

Very hard time forming bowl and tasted like a brick of salt. Other than that it was awesome!
