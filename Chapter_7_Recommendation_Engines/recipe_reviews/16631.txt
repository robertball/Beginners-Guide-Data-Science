My husband is from the East Coast where coconut custard pie is popular. Here in the Midwest, coconut cream is the coconut pie of choice. Since I can't purchase a coconut custard pie out here, I have to make them homemade. This one is his favorite so far. It is easy to make and comes out creamy and very tasty. I usually do not have the whipping cream on hand, so I just use one and one half cups of evaporated milk instead of the one cup it calls for. I also use just 1 tsp.of vanilla. I thought the one and a half might be too overpowering. Before putting in the oven, I sprinkle a few tablespoons of coconut on top of the custard. I also sprinkle a little nutmeg on top. Besides tasting great, it looks very appetizing. Hint: brushing your pie crust with a lightly beaten egg white, helps to keep the crust from getting too soggy. Also, I use an unbaked pie crust..saves time and that is what most recipes call for with a custard type pie. Thanks Celia for a great recipe!!!

Update: I have begun making this with a total of 3 cups of milk. It seems to make for a bit creamier pie. I used whatever combination of milks/cream I have on hand. Even using 3 cups of whole milk it turns out great. I recently came across a great tip to help you from overcooking your custard. Overcooking it results in it watering out. I now use a quick read thermometer and bake the pie until the center is 160. This has been working out great!!!! So far, no more watered out custard pies. :-)

I made this pie twice and each time it got rave reviews. I added just a little more vanilla and a bit more than a pinch of nutmeg. There is something I want to mention though. The first time I made this recipe I spilled the filling getting it into the oven. I've since used a 4 cup measuring cup and poured it into the shell on the oven rack. I don't know if anyone else had my experience, just wnated to help anyone who did.

Served it at Thanksgiving to Coconut Custard experts. It was fantastic.  It was gone after the first round of pie was dished out. 
 I suggest adding a 1/4 to 1/2 more cups of coconut for coconut lovers!

This pie is very easy to make and comes out great!  I have tried several coconut custard pie recipes and this one is by far the best - it took a little longer to cook in my oven (closer to an hour) but turned out fantastic and received many compliments.  Plus, it only took about 10 minutes to throw all the ingredients together and get the pie in the oven.

Very good basic coconut custard recipe. Next time, I think I will add a little more nutmeg, and slighlty more cocunut. I used a unbaked pie crust, and it was fine. I only had to bake it for 45 min. as stated (I was prepared to bake it longer because of some of the other reviews). I will be making this one again!

This is the first time I made this and it turned out great.  I don't like coconut, but I made it for my boyfriend and he loved it, it's his favorite pie.  He said it was better than store made.  Will make again.

This pie turned out great. Following the advice of others I added a little more coconut. Next time I might add a splash of coconut extract to liven it up more. Great pie! YUM.

Nice little pie.  Being a diabetic, I made some changes to try to lower the carb and fat count.  I substituted a low cal sugar blend for whole sugar, used skim milk instead of whole, used a lite version of whipped cream, and used fat free evaporated milk instead of the higher fat regular. The pie came out just fine.  My husband loves custards, and he couldn't tell that I made the ingredient alterations and really enjoyed it.  These small substitutions allow me to a  slice satisfies my sweet tooth!  Will make again!

Growing up in the south I had always had regular coconut pie and my wife being from New York City she wanted me to find her a Coconut Custard Pie recipe.  I located this recipe and I was worried because it was her favorite pie growing up.  I followed the directions to the T and it turned out wonderful.

This was exactly what I was hoping for!  I've grown up with what I think of as the New England version of this pie, and I found this to be a "stupid easy" recipe for this pie.  It's not too full of coconut, not too "eggy," the perfect sweetness, and it has a very nice mouthfeel.  I was very happy with it.

SUPERB! I am from Philadelphia, and moved here to SC 15 years ago and that's about how long it's been since I had a coconut custard pie! My wife said it's good as if not better than what we got in restaurants! Thanks so much! OH...by the way, I made a mistake with the whipping cream and evaporated milk...I switched the amounts by mistake, and it still came out great! You can't mess this recipe up!

I have been making this pie for years for my husband, and this is the first chance I've gotten to rate it. Of all of his pies, this is his favorite. He can't get enough of this, and begs me to make it in the "off" season. it's definitely become a holiday staple at our house, and an added benefit, is you can use the filling in custard cups, instead of a pie crust for your more elegant dinners.

Very good.  Had to cook about 20 min longer than the recipe called for.  Added more nutmeg than the recipe called for.

My family enjoyed this a lot.  However, I think I am going to tweak it a little bit.  Like other contributors, I found that 35-40 minutes was nowhere near enough time.  It took a full hour.  Therefore next time, I will not pre-bake my pie crust.  I also added about another 1/2 cup of coconut.  Yummy!

Really easy to make. I forgot the Whipping cream but it turned out awesome. It did seem to overflow in the pie crust though and I suggest leaving it in the oven for about 10-15 minutes more. Other wise it was excellent and everyone loved it! I even made a different recipe so we had a taste test and this one won hands down! Thanks :)

I was looking for a coconut custard pie recipe and wanted one that would not only taste great but be easy to throw together.  This is it.  I have already made it three times. I followed the recipe as stated and each time it turned out perfect for taste and texture.  Don't pass this one up if you are looking for a tasty, no hassle coconut custard pie.

Oh. My. Gosh. I LOVE this pie. I love coconut cream, but had never had or made a custard pie, and it turned out perfect. The tips in the reviews about cooking to a temp of 160° were perfect. I was searching for recipes to use up milk, so I used 3 cups of milk milking ended up having too much for one pie and not enough for two, so I made some more and ended up having three. I took one to my event, shared one with my family and ate the third by myself...  -_-   I used fine grated coconut so it  floated while baking, making an awesome 2 layer custard. Yum!

I cut down on sugar thinking that it's going to be too much since I used sweetened coconut; but once cooked, it needs an additional sugar. Next time I'll follow the right amt. of sugar. I will also cut down on milk/cream next time since following the recipe yielded too much for just 1 pie crust.

Very easy and good. Pie did take about an hour to bake. Has anyone tried to substitute coconut milk for the whole milk? Just an idea. I did not use any nutmeg, as I really don't like it and also didn't think it was needed.

Mine is in the oven now so I can't review the results until later. However, if you use more milk and more coconut like some of the reviewers suggest, you'll need another pie shell. I have way too much filling. I poured it in a small bowl and am cooking it now.

The only comparison I have is Entenmanns's! but I really didn't like this. It was so eggy or something......
I really love coconut custard. I have to find a better recipe.

I did not alter any ingredients, and this pie is to die for! However ... be patient and wait until it's cold to try it. MUCH better that way! I did use an UNBAKED deep dish pie crust (which it filled nicely) and found that it took more like 45 to 50 minutes to bake. I live at 5,000 feet, so that may have been due to the altitude. 

I had never made a coconut custard pie before now, and have always loved the Sara Lee version ... but this is SO much better! And EXTREMELY easy. Yummy!!

Great recipe!  Easy to make and very tasty!  I followed others' suggestions and added more vanilla and more coconut.  The pie came out creamy, thick and absolutely delicious!  I used the cream cheese tart dough for the crust and it was fabulous!  :)

This recipe was easy and pretty good.  It didn't taste quite like I expected but that might have been my inexperience at making pies!    I don't like coconut too much but the husband loved it.  The only change I made was to substitute additional evaporated milk for the whipping cream, which I didn't have.

Very easy, added more nutmeg and vanilla extract, cooked in the frozen pie shell with out pre baking, and cooked about ten minutes longer.  This pie was simple, and yet delicous!

This made a beautiful texture. It did take 50 minutes to cook but came out beautifully. It was a big hit. I did sub in Splenda for sugar as another reviewer mentioned.

Love coconut custard and this is my go to. It comes out well every time. Very custardy and slightly eggy, in a good way. And of course the coconut flavor comes thru very well. I add more coconut because I love it. It's relatively easy to make and hard to screw up. Highly recommend.

I used evaporated milk, whipping cream and half and half (3 cups total). A tad more nutmeg, cinnamon and coconut.

Much better tasting and general consistency than other pies just using milk.  Best recipe I've found on this site for Coconut custard pie. You can always add more coconut if you like, but we found this to be just the right amount. Great pie.

Did not like this recipe. I made it for my husband, the coconut lover. He said it was too "eggy" and not sweet enough. I agreed, the custard portion was too gelatinous.
