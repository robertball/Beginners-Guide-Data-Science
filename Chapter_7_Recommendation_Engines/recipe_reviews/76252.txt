This was my first Gingerbread recipe, and it turned out great.  The flavor was very good and the amount of cinnamon was perfect.  It did not turn out as well as it could, but that was due to pulling it out of the over a little too soon, so stick to the time frame.  I will deffinately make this recipe again and again.

I can't believe this is made with Splenda!  You'd never know it was low-calorie!  I made it for Thanksgiving and everyone loved it.  Also, if you make it in a couple loaf pans instead of the bundt pan, you might be less inclined to put some sort of (not so low calorie) topping on it; that's what I did.  I was very skeptical of baking with Splenda but I will definitely do so again in the future.  The only other change I made was to add 1 tsp. of ground cloves.

Amazing!  Easy, delicious and low-calorie.  We had this last night (with a very light orange-flavored glaze) and it was huge hit.  I used 3/4 cup of egg substitute instead of the 3 eggs.

I made this cake for my TOPS(take off pounds sensibly)Fall Rally. There were almost 200 people there and that cake was the biggest success there. It was the best ever, I will definitely make it over and over again.

Great cake!  My family loved it.  I used less molasses, all I had, about 1/2 cup, and it still came out moist and delicious.  I put a powdered sugar/almond extract glaze on the top, takes away some of the low-cal appeal, but it was a tasty addition!

I put this recipe through the WW recipe-builder and it came out at 4 points per serving. Not bad. If you substitute Egg Beaters for the whole eggs, it goes down to 3 points per serving!

My husband did not think he would like anything but the Betty Crocker ginger bread recipe of the 50's, until we tried this one.  Now we will enjoy gingerbread more frequently as this is a great cake with much more healthy ingredients.

I made this cake for my family, it was great. Then I made it again and this time I put sugar free jello cream cheese pudding in the middle and it was fantastic. I used a bundnt pan. No one new it was sugarfree

The cake on its own (as directed here) IS a 4-star, as others have said. However, if you make a creme fraiche glaze (1/2 cup creme fraiche mixed with 3 Tablespoons Splenda) and drizzle it over the top, it becomes a clear 5-star winner. People in my office begged me to make it again and NOBODY believed it was sugar-free! It didn't affect my diabetic husband's blood sugar much either, which is important to us.

I joined the recipe email club in 2005.  I received this recipe in time for Christmas that year.  I had been looking for a Gingerbread recipe since my Grandmother passed away in 1996.  This is the closest I have come to hers and without all the calories.  I have been baking them for the past 2yrs for my family as Christmas gifts.  They all enjoy it as much as I do.  Thanks.
