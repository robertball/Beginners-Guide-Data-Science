I went looking for a new banana bread recipe for a change from what I usually make. I was hoping that I could find one that I could add diced pears to, as I  couldn't find a Pear/Banana Bread recipe. This was the one. What I did was half the amount of the bananas and add a can of drained, diced pears. I also used pumpkin pie spice instead of using the different spices called for in this recipe. Yum. This impressed my husband, who normally dosen't care for banana bread. I'll for sure be making this again. Thanks for posting the recipe.

So yummy! Not a strong banana taste, which I liked. I added some brown sugar in with the white sugar to make 1 cup. If I had had enough, I would have used all brown sugar.
 I also made only 1 loaf and then put the remaining batter into mini bunt pans. Baked at the same time. Bunt muffins were done in about 23 minutes.
 So Good!

This was pretty good. I was out of brown sugar so I chose this recipe since it just used white sugar. The spices add a really nice flavor and the smell was fantastic while it was baking. I made one small pan and 6 good sized muffins. Next time I will add some walnuts to the batter since we like it with nuts. In my husband's words: "Hey, that's not too bad at all!" Thanks!!! :)

I've been looking for a great banana bread recipe that includes spices like cinnamon and nutmeg because so many out there don't have them. This was an awesome recipe! I don't have a loaf pan for some reason (I need to go buy one!), but I did as another reviewer suggested and just used a 2-quart square baking dish. Perfect!! I only had 3 bananas, but I thought it still turned out phenomenal. Also, I did as a couple other reviewers suggested and did 1/2 sugar and 1/2 brown sugar. I will be making this again and again!

I used five bananas because I had them and didn't use cloves because I didn't.  Used a mixture of brown and white sugars.  My loaves were done in 37 minutes.

This banana bread was great! The spices add a nice flavor, different from the standard b-bread. I put the batter in one pan and baked for a little longer. I also added 1 cup of walnuts to the mix. Tasty!

I did make it half brown sugar, half white sugar. But I'm sure it would have been delicious either way. This is the perfect banana bread!

This is the best recipe I have used! The banana flavor came through very well (I skimped slightly on the cinnamon), and I put all of the mix in one 2qt pan instead of 2 separate loaves. I added 10 minutes to the bake time bc of this. It turned out perfectly!

great and easy recipe! Lots of banana flavor and spice, plus it was very moist. Not overly sweet either. I added 1/4 c of wheat germ and 1/4 c of flax seed to the flour before mixing it with the wet ingredients for added nutrition. Thanks for the recipe.

Delicious and moist. I also split the sugar into brown and white, added chopped pecans, and sprinkled sugar on top before baking.

Finally, a banana bread recipe which calls for SPICES that, in my opinion, are definitely lacking in more traditional banana bread recipes. I mixed all my dry ingredients together, including spices, and then mashed my 4 small, overripe bananas with a couple pinches of brown sugar, vanilla, a few shakes of cinnamon, and about 1/4c applesauce. After combining the eggs, I added a combo of 1/2 brown and 1/2 white sugars. In lieu of melted butter, I opted for 1/4c canola oil and 1/4c applesauce and whisked well. I then added my dry ingredients slowly, using a mixer. I also tossed in some pumpkin pie spice just for good measure. Using a single greased 9x5" loaf pan, the batter fit perfectly. The only downside was that at 350 for 45 minutes, it browned too quickly, so I had to use tented foil to ensure a non-burnt loaf. However, the middle still wasn't done, so I popped the loaf in for another 15 minutes, and turned the heat down to 325 and used the tented foil again. Next time, I'll just bake at 325 since my oven runs a little hot and increase the time a bit, watching closely that it doesn't brown too quickly. I love spices in quick breads and this one was really good!

Great recipe. I used half brown and half white  sugar as some of the other reviewers suggested. Also added about a 1/4 cup or so of chopped walnuts.

I thought this bread was great.  Banana bread should have spices to taste great.  I gave it four stars because I thought it could use even more spice flavor so I added more to my taste, but overall a moist delicious bread.

I've made this recipe twice now with wonderful results each time.  First time was strictly following the recipe as written and it turned out well.  I did need to add a few minutes to the bake time but the final result was great.  The second time I made a few changes based on dietary needs and what I had in my pantry.  I used Bob's Red Mill All-Purpose Gluten Free Flour, 1 cup of brown sugar (no white sugar at all), and added one half of a bag of Nestle Dark Chocolate Chips (not semi-sweet, but those would work), and 1.5 cups chopped pecans.  It was delicious!  I did need to add 10 minutes total to the bake time and because I had forgotten to add the xanatham gum recommended when baking gluten-free the loaves were flat on top but the taste was wonderful!  Very moist, spicy, and delicious treat.  Great with morning coffee or after dinner.  I did use 2 8"x3" loaf pans.  I have not yet tried making muffins.  This is my go-to recipe for banana bread now.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Love this recipe.  I make one pan as written and add mini chocolate chips to the second to keep both kids happy! If bananas are real small, I'd add an extra.

OMG absolutely delicious!  I followed the recipe directions, but used all brown sugar since I was out of white AND I added a tiny bit of oil (so small, that I didn't even measure it, probably about a tablespoon).  The mixture had just seemed too thick, but the two loaves came out perfect.  They ended up baking more like 60 minutes.  After the first 45 minutes, I lowered the oven temp since I was worried that the edges were getting too brown.  The first loaf was completely gone in no time.  Will definitely use this recipe again.  Loved that it was not so "plain" as traditional banana bread recipes.  Thanks.

A yummy banana bread with very nice spice combination. In my opinion, a great bread to make if you're looking for that fall/winter "welcome to my home" smell or for when your spouse comes in from shoveling snow!

What a wonderful recipe.  My husband and I are not fond of banana bread.  I had bananas that I needed to use and I found this recipe.  Very light, not at all heavy like banana bread can be.  The spices are just enough and you still taste bananas.  I made just one loaf in case we didn't like it.  I added three bananas to the one loaf.  Worked out great.

I love this recipe and have shared it with many friends.  Because I like strong spiced flavor I add heaping spoonfuls of the nutmeg and cloves.  It is also great with nuts and raisins if you have them.  Thanks for a great recipe!

5 Stars! This is my new banana bread recipe. I made 15 batches last weekend to give away. I am not the biggest clove fan, so will omit it in the future. Also, used brown sugar instead of white as a personal preference. Easy, moist and yummy!

Very Good!  What a wonderful taste and texture.
I did make a slight addition to this recipe.  We like nuts in banana bread; I did not have any walnuts or pecan but I did have some honey caoted candied peanuts.  I chooped 1 cup of peanuts and stirred them last just before pouring batter in loaf pans.
Really good.

I went in search of a banana bread recipe because I had several bananas that were over-ripe and I hated to throw them away.  This version was very tasty.  I like banana bread with walnuts, but I was out of them so I added chopped pecans instead and it was still delicious.  I will definitely make this one again.

I love this recipe and throwing out all the others.  I did make two adjustments.  The first was making 1 1/2 batches.  This was due to the pans I used (tea loaf size).  The second change was the sugar.  I used 3/4 cup each white and brown sugars.  Super easy, moist, yummy.  Thank you for a great recipe!

Wonderful banana bread. I'm not usually a fan but made this for my family. I actually liked it! Not a whole lot of banana flavor and the spices were a great addition. I added cardamon as well and used 1/2 white sugar and 1/2 brown. Will make this again.

Way too much clove.  I guess I like traditional banana bread better.  Save the spice for pumpkin or zucchini.

Mine turned out great.  I would add nuts (personal preference) if anyone else in my family would eat them.  I made mine using half whole wheat pastry flour.

Great recipe! This is an easy recipe to make variations on for different results. I used a full cup of brown sugar, added some mango and included ginger too add some extra spice. The loaf turned out perfectly and I know it's not going to last long in my house!

This was really good! I did half and half brown and white sugar and used pumpkin pie spice instead of the different ones. I didn't have enough butter so I used applesauce to make up the difference. My kids loved it! We took the second loaf to their day care where it was promptly gobbled up by everyone! Thanks!!!

I love this recipe, I did make a change and some addtions to it to make it my own, but was so good I have to share. I substituted the butter for 1 cup applsauce,I also did half brown half white for the sugar. I also added 1 cup oatmeal and a half-pint of light whipping cream,and ! cup of crushed walnuts, this needed to cook a little longer than 45min. about an extra 15 min. or so. This was SO DELICIOUS!!  Great warmed-up with a spat of butter.I give it 5 stars,now.

I just made this bread --it's a favorite at my house. I like it beacause you can make 2 loaves in one session of baking. One to keep and one to give away. The spices are a great combination and my 3 daughters gobbled it up. They said it tastes like Christmas. I always keep the overripe bannanas in my freezer and thaw when I have a reason to bake. With this recipe....it's easy to find that reason Yummy!

Fantastic recipe. This makes a great muffin! I added 1/4 cup of whole wheat flour, in with the remaining 1 and 3/4 cups of white flour to give it some fiber. I also added 1/2 cup dark chocolate chips, and 1/4 tsp more cinnamon. Fabulous!

Very good. Kind of a cross between banana bread and pumpkin bread in my opinion. Great way to use up bananans in the fall when you want that spicy flavor.

This was very good, I didn't have ground clove so I used 1 1/2 tsp pumpkin spice.  Also used applesauce instead of butter.  Added an extra banana and used 1/2 splenda.  Very moist, great flavor.

Delicious recipe, Jennifer. Thank you. So easy to make. I used 1/2 cup brown sugar & 1/2 cup Splenda. Also, I added 1/2 tsp ginger, since it goes so well with the cinnamon, nutmeg & cloves. I figured the ginger wouldn't hurt anything.

I thought this was just ok. I've had better. It really wasn't very moist and it didn't rise much. Actually, I made one loaf and used the rest of the batter as muffins and the muffins rose ok but the loaf didn't rise at all. Really strange. I didn't change a thing in the recipe. I usually tinker with recipes but since I haven't made banana bread before I just made it the way it was written. It was dryer than other banana breads I've had before and not fluffy at all. I didn't really like the spice flavor either. However , It did make me crave pumpkin pie! These weren't inedible I just might try to find a different recipe that is more moist and doesn't have the "spice" that is kinda strange with banana.

20 STARS!  Absolutely perfect!  Moist, yet somewhat fluffy and very flavorful. Great by itself and I found out it was very good with a little cream cheese icing.  (Doesn't need the icing; I had some left over and thought I'd try it.) The recipe is so simple and at the same time it seems versatile.  I may try adding other fruits, substitutions, etc...  But I'll definitely be making it as written, too!!

My bread machine banana bread recipe was bland-bland-bland, so I went looking for a new one. This is definitely a keeper! Haven't done any modifications yet, but next time might try the pear addition that one one reviewer mentioned.

Delicious! I usually don't like when the original recipe is changed but I did use 6 bananas instead of 4. Everything else kept the same. Both loaves were gone faster than it took to make them. Thanks!

This is my first attempt at quick bread, and this recipe was a HUGE success.  The only deviation from the recipe was that I added 1C of pulverized walnuts.  This bread is SUPER moist and very flavorful.  I am very excited to create this bread again.

I wanted a little change from my banana bread and I came across this one. My 2 and 3 year old LOVE it. I has a wonderful wormness from the spices and is very moist. Easy to make too..
thanks, Anna,Adam & Alex

Yum!  This was fantastic.  I used pumpkin pie spice because that's what I had on hand, but otherwise made no adjustments.  Fabulous!

I used pumpkin pie spice in place of spices.  Tastes delicious but was only 2" high.  Next time I will make one loaf instead of two!

Yes I made changes. 
I used 5 banana's and only just mash them so about pea size bits in the batter, soft butter not melted and coconut palm sugar instead of regular sugar. I doubled the cinnamon and nutmeg plus added a 1/4 tsp of ginger.
I then made regular muffins, bite-size muffins and with what I had left over I baked in my 6" cast iron frying pan. 
I'm now freezing some to take to my parents. YUMMY!!!

Absolutely love this banana bread. It is my husband's favorite and when I took it to work for our holiday cookie/pastry xmas exchange, everyone raved about it. I add walnuts as a personal preference and I've also made it sugar free w/Splenda for my mother in law who is diabetic. Thanks for sharing this recipe! :)

This is my go to banana muffin recipe.  I don't like banana myself, but my husband and 5 year old love these.  I substitute 1/2 cup hemp protein for 1/2 cup flour and my son doesn't notice the difference but it increases the protein.  I give him these and fruit for quick breakfasts and don't feel guilty!

I added one cup of roasted, chopped black walnuts. I could not find the bread pans, so an 8"x11" baking dish was used. 15 minutes additional baking time was needed. The bread was so moist & delicious. Definitely a make again recipe.

I thought this was a pretty good base. I used a cup of brown sugar and would cut that down to 3/4 cups because it was a little too sweet.  I would increase the spices as well but overall,  this was an excellent bread.

Mmmmm, this is sooo good! I only wish I had the 4 very ripe bananas, but all I had was 3. I personally Love cinnamon, so I doubled it, used the 1/2 tsp of fresh grated nutmeg, and I didn't have the ground cloves. The spices are all about preference, make it your own! And please, Use Very Ripe Bananas! It really does make all the difference!

I'd easily make this recipe again. Although, I might try adding a bit more spice. Then again, I didn't have any cloves to use. I let it bake about 50 minutes or so and it turned out perfectly bready.

I cut the sugar and put a half a cup of sugar and 1/2 a cup of brown sugar and then I threw some dried baby fix and with my flour mixture. My sister loves raisins and she loves dried baby fixed and she said that this was better than the one I made last time with the raisins..

DELICIOUS!! I’ve never had such a delicious and perfectly balanced banana bread!!! I added pumpkin spice and ginger instead of  nutmeg because I was out and it turned out perfectly balanced still... it’s a great recipe! My kids and husband devoured the first loaf!

I was ready to toss two overripe bananas, but I'm happy that I came across this recipe instead! I halved it using one 8x4 pan. I also added about 1/3 cup chopped walnuts, reserving some for a topping prior to baking. Since all ovens run different, I always check something earlier than the time indicated. I checked mine at 35 min, and it was ready.  This had great texture and flavor. The spice combination is wonderful. (I'd even try increasing them just a tad.)  With the fall season ready to start, this was especially good. Jennifer, thanks for this super recipe.

Very tasty and moist.  I made a few changes - substituted allspice for the cloves, added 1 extra egg and substituted olive oil for the melted butter.

Delicious banana bread! I also used 1/2 brown sugar and 1/2 white sugar, and topped one loaf with walnuts. My pans were 9x5 so it made 2 shorter loaves, and they were done in about 35 minutes. My son loved it with peanut butter in the morning.  Will definitely make again!

Sorry but we weren't fans of this recipe. The spices took away the banana flavor, and the bread just tasted like a spiced loaf. This recipe sounded good and different but I'll  stick to my own banana bread recipe.

Easy recipe for a beginner like me!  I added walnuts and used cupcake liners for 1/2 of the recipe as I only had one baking pan. I also substituted allspice for the cloves.   It was moist and delicious.

Awesome recipe!  I've made banana bread for 30 years and I can't believe that I've never thought to add spices to it.  The cloves/ mutmeg/ cinnamon/ vanilla all sounded like A LOT, but it was fabulous.  My sons gobbled it up.     Being insulin-dependent diabetic, I am always a bit nutrition concious, so I used only 1/2 the butter and 1/2 the sugar.  As always, it still turned out rich and moist and tasty...... bananas are the magic ingredient for that.

This has been my go-to recipe for banana bread for the last 6 years. I make it exactly as written. I also add chocolate chips when I make a loaf for me, and walnuts and white chocolate chips for my husband. In fact, I'm surprising him with a loaf tomorrow, as he's worked all weekend and deserves a treat!! My house is gonna smell so yummy!!!

I made this for a bridal shower where some guests had food allergies or intolerance. Here are the changes I made:
1 1/2 cups Aldies Gluten free flour blend plus 1/2 cup plantain flour instead of regular flour, 1 tablespoon flaxseed meal plus 3 tablespoons water as replacement for egg (this is a per egg recipe). This turned out delicious and even non allergic people asked for recipe and took some home.

I could have used 2 cups of the Aldi flour but thought my bananas might not be ripe enough to have a good flavor. This turned out awesome!

A very delicious and fragrant  version.  I tend to get plenty of bananas from friends and usually end up making banana bread to share. I used the smaller triangular bananas as they are less sweet and used pumpkin spice in place of nutmeg. I used a bunt pan since it was the only one on hand and will definitely this recipe again. I may add some crushed nuts on my next attempt.

Everyone loves this bread when I make it! I have people ask for the recipe all the time. I was making muffins and left the baking powder out once by mistake.  Ended up with "cookies" since the bread didn't rise but it was still delicious. Easy and tasty!

I have been searching for a better banana bread recipe & this is it!  Most other recipes have been so bland.  I did omit the ground cloves (because I didn't have any),used a combination of white & brown sugars, and I only had 3 bananas so I did add a can of chopped pears.
This made 1 loaf pan, 2 mini loaves & 6 muffins.  I loved them in the muffin style (great for breakfast) and they have already disappeared!  Loved the spice & moistness--will make again!

Wow! Followed everything and it came out perfectly. One pan I left alone, on the second I added walnuts and mini chocolate chips on the top. Came out awesome. Either way the spice is what was missing from all the other recipes I've tried in the past. This one is a keeper and new family favorite. Thanks for sharing this!!!

This is the best banana bread recipe EEEEVVERRRRRR!!!! If you like any of the spices that are called for, you will TOTAL love the flavor. The only substitution I made was instead of a full stick of butter(1/2 cup) I used half a stick & 1/2 cup of applesauce. It was ridiculously moist with an awesome blend of banana, clove & cinnamon flavor.

I didn't have cloves so I didn't add it and saw someone split the sugar half and half with brown sugar so I did that. We made muffins as I am living in Grenada and my oven does no heat to 500+ in about 20 minutes no matter what you set the dial to! So bread is out of the question, but muffins with a bit of opening and closing is doable! We'll definitely make more!

I love this recipe just because it uses 4 bananas, which happens to be about how many I typically have laying around! I tend to include almonds, my favorite nut, double the cloves, add in 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper (because I'm evil like that), and substitute Vanilla Nut Butter flavoring in place of the vanilla (a trick I picked up from my Grandma and it makes ALL the difference!!)

My husband is vegan, and I was missing a few ingredients, so I slightly modified this recipe and it came out delicious!  To make it vegan, I substituted a 1/2 cup of water for the 2 eggs and 1/2 cup Earth's Best buttery spread for the butter.  I was missing the 1 tsp vanilla extract, so I substituted with 2 tsp spiced rum.  I was missing cloves as well and simply left them out.  My husband, our friends, and our 1-year-old all loved the bread! I will definitely keep the recipe on hand for a go-to holiday bread.

This is a very moist bread.  Liked this because it didn't call for nuts and had some extra spices which were nice. I mashed the banana up just enough and it was nice having some pieces of banana showing throughout the bread.  I used 2 large ones.  I only made one load so I cut the cooking back to 35 mins and it was perfect.    Will make again and next time I might even add some more cinnamon.

If my measurements were more in line with the instructions, this may well have been 5 star.
I really liked this. It had a sweet, crispy crust with medium (not heavy, but still moist) inside.
My preference would have been more spices, but the listed spices are a happy medium for more tradionalists.
I had 5 small bananas and could taste them just fine.

My "changes" were 1 cup brown sugar, an extra egg white, and a little extra melted butter(was there so I tossed it in.) 
I worried that I might need to add more flour, but it worked out just fine. 

I made 1 loaf and the rest went into muffins.

House smells fantastic as a bonus.

This is a Wonderful Recipe!,  the spices are just right for me.  My usual recipes for banana bread are too bland, so this recipe is moving to the top of the list.  The crust was a little crisp, just like I like it and the interior was smooth and moist.  My hands were bothering me tonight so I didn't get the bananas mashed as finely as I usually do.  This has left small half mashed pieces of banana throughout the bread.  It made for a difference in texture between the bread and crust that made this banana bread a pleasure to eat.  Thanks for sharing!

Love this banana bread! Next time, I won't put in the cloves though. I found that the clove flavor was a bit over powering. Still very good though.

I could taste no banana in this recipe. I added walnuts which we like so the recipe made 3 loaves. . I won't make it again.

I will definitely be making this bread again. I made it last night and woke up today to find half of one loaf gone. I'd say my man either had a very large breakfast or took a bunch to work with him. Needless to say, it is a winning recipe. I did not have ground cloves, so I substituted with allspice.
