I made this salad for Easter to go with our ham.  It was very good and nowhere as sweet as I thought it would be - which was good. Instead of pineapple tidbits I used crushed pineapple and left out the celery.  Everyone enjoyed it, even my 6 year old who hates all things vegetable.  I would definitely make this again.  Great recipe!

This one brings back memories of childhood. My mom used to add a tablespoon or two of peanut butter to the dressing. It made for a nice variation. We don't care for marshamallow in anything. I left those and the sugar out of the mix. I felt the raisins, pineapple and carrots themselves were sweet enough. Thanks for sharing.

Have never had marshmallows in a carrot salad before and I 8+) liked it. The only change I made was to use crushed pineapple instead of tidbits. Very good will be make aging.

Sounds odd, but since it got great reviews and 5 stars I decided to try it. It was a hit!! Very good. I didnt use celery since I didnt have any, and I would have to say it wasnt missing it. Tasted great without it. Thanks for the great recipe.

Yummy.  Served this with spicy chicken enchilada soup.  Nice contrast and it instantly put out the 'fire'.

Thought this salad was a little tasteless.  Wasn't quite sure what was "creamy salad dressing".  Is that Mayo?  Next time might use cole slaw dressing.

Wonderful salad, both pleasing to the eye as well as the palate! I did substitute Splenda for the sugar, and used crushed pineapple as that is what I had on hand. This is definitely a recipe that I will use again and again. Thank you, Carol!

This was a little dull, maybe because I didnt add marshmallows but with the addition of shredded coconut it improved it alot

I found this recipe just a touch too sweet for my tastes. If I make this recipe again, I will leave out the marshmallows and maybe add some sunflower seeds and a touch (a drop!) of toasted sesame oil. Takes a fair bit of time to julienne that much carrot too!

I made this for a group buffet. Pealed and cut carrots into thin coins instead of julienned. Added 1/2 inch cubes of baked ham to the mix. It was good, but wish I had used the julienned carrots to save time.

I followed the recipe as written.  I used mayonnaise for the dressing.  I used pre-shredded carrots.  I added the marshmellows right before serving so they wouldn't get soggy. The salad was really yummy--sweet and fresh.

I did not put celery in it.  I added honey instead of sugar.  Next time I want to try with diced apples.  I put in half as much mayo as the recipe suggested and only 8 oz of crushed pineapple (drained).  It was delicious!

I did make this, everyone liked it.  I figured out that creamy salad dressing was Miracle Whip, I left out the sugar.
