So YUMMY and so EASY. I had a Tomato Bisque at a restaurant & loved it so much that I needed to find a recipe to match. This is definitely the taste I was looking for.

Another great recipe and so easy to make.  I pureed the tomatoes, added the cream, basil, garlic, dash of salt and rice for substance. The family loved it!

Wonderful! I slightly pureed the tomatoes so that it would be the right consistency. And added way more basil, garlic powder, a hint of mint, and a hint of cayene pepper. It is so good and filling!

Am I the only person who had problems with curdled soup?  It still tasted wonderful, but didn't look or feel appetizing.  I followed the directions, but as soon as I added the cream it curdled.

I've never made a Tomato Bisque before and this one turned out great! It was very filling. I pureed the stewed tomatoes to make it easier to eat and dip my warm wheat french toast in it. It was YUMMY-LICIOUS!

This is a great starter you can really have fun with. I used fresh cilantro AND basil, a little minced garlic and fat free half and half.  I think the possibilities are endless here. I might even add rice next time

This recipe is amazing not only because the soup is wonderful but the time to make it is only 10 - 17 minutes. We added some fresh basil as well as the dried basil more to add some color than anything. It turned out fantastic!

I gave this a three stars because the recipe as written is really bland. But it does offer a lot of customization to your tasts. But if you don't know what you like in bisque that's really hard to say. I made this recipe taste good (for me) by adding cayane, paprika, minced onions, minced garlic and chili paste (with 2 bay leaves for good measure). It was way to bland after I tasted it without altering it so I tossed the above in.

Its really good, sorta like what my mom used to make.  I used a can of evaporated milk instead of cream for a lower fat version.  I would have given it 5 stars but silly me, didn't take it off the heat when I added the milk and it split.  It looked unappealing but still tasted good. I added a bit of fresh ground pepper to it as well.

I just made this today and it was wonderful.  I had tomato bisque soup for the first time about 2 weeks ago and loved it!  This recipe was so easy and it leaves a lot of room to play around with so you can really make it interesting everytime.

I like how the recipe leaves room for playing around with it.  My husband and I took turns tasting and adding to it.  Next time I'm pureeing the tomatoes and this goes excellent with provelone and pepperoni grilled cheese too.

Quick and easy! I used diced tomatoes and put half in the food processor to make it a bit smoother. I sometimes add garlic and what ever else is around, but not a must. It is still great with the 3 ingredients listed.

Very good and I added salt and lots of pepper.  Chopped tomatoes, otherwise it would be very difficult to eat.  Thanks for the recipe.

I was a little scared trying this.. with so few ingredients or instructions... but it turned out great!  I  increased the servings to 12, so ended up using 3 28oz cans of stewed tomatoes,  a small carton of heavy cream (about 2 1/2 cups) and 4 or 5 teaspoons of fresh chopped basil.  I followed the advice of another review and added pepper, garlic powder and some fresh ground sea salt for seasoning.  I hadn't pureed, so just took out my mixer and used a few times to chunk up the tomatoes.  I got rave reviews from my family... smelled great as it simmered (that fresh basil!) and with grilled cheese sandwiches, it was the perfect Sunday dinner.

Only change: I blended the tomatoes (not liquidy, but pretty smooth texture and few chunks in the end)

Let me preface this with the fact that I HATE tomato anything... lobster bisque is as close as I will get, and I'm still picky about that.  I made this recipe in a large crock pot in the morning, and when 12:00 rolled around for a school luncheon, it was "perfect" (so says everyone else).  I was VERY happy to not take any home after school!  I'm sure it was great!  (It doesn't always matter to me if I like it - it matters that the crowd is pleased!)

Amazing!  I made minor excellent changes.  I put olive oil in heated pot with half of a minced garlic clove and grated onion before adding canned whole tomatoes.   I also added 3/4 cup of "minor's" chicken broth and added fresh basil to heavy cream and half and half cream.

Ok so, I am trying to simulate a Campbell's Tomato-Basil Bisque that I purchased @ Costco. They rotate stock often and so there is none available.
I only had 1 can of store brand stewed tomatoes (they were a little hard) but wanted to try this recipe out. I did need to tweak a bit but I think it's going to morph into a good substitute.  
I hydrated 1 teaspoon dried onions, added them to 1 pat butter and cooked for a minute or two, then added about 1/2 t dried basil. Added the tomatoes and cooked 5 minutes (as I mention hard tomatoes will up that time to 15-20 minutes)then pureed with immersion blender.  Then I added some a shakes of garlic powder, couple grinds fresh black pepper, 1 t chicken bullion, 1/2 t sugar, more dried basil & used about 3/4 cup 1/2 & 1/2 as I didn't have heavy cream.  
Now I know that is a lot of tweaking but simple ones and as I said I already had a certain taste in mind.  We sampled 1/2 of recipe and will refrigerate other half to see how the flavor develops.

For 3 ingredients, this was quite good.  I used fresh basil and added a little cilantro, salt, and pepper.  My husband said it could've used more salt.  Note:  I used a 28 oz. can of peeled, crushed tomatoes, instead of the 2 cans of stewed tomatoes, and the consistency was fine and I didn't have to puree or blend anything.  The next time that I have leftover heavy cream, I will make this again.

Very easy. I made this for two so I used 1 can of italian style stewed tomatoes then stirred in 1/2 cup of half and half, pureed and added about a tablespoon of dried basil, tsp. of kosher salt and lots of fresh ground black pepper, a two dashes of garlic powder salt and about a 1/4 tsp of crushed red pepper. It was easy and delicious! Thanks :)

I made it for a soup supper at church and not a bit was left.  It is sooo easy I almost felt I was cheating.  I added a little extra basil.
