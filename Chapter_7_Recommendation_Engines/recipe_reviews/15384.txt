Not as good as I expected from the reveiws, although not bad either. Could use more thickening. I found myself adding salt as I ate it. There is a big problem with the cooking instructions -- it says to add the dairy to the soup directly, but if you do so, it will immediately curdle and clump. That can be avoided by simply taking a bit of the hot soup liquid and mixing it with the dairy in a small bowl, and then adding it back to the soup.

I make this exact recipe all the time and its really wonderful. The trick to thickening it is to mash some of the potatoes. Using a hand blender or food processor blends the bacon and onion as well, which really helps with the flavour, especially getting that right amount of salt. I usually remove several cups of the potatoes once cooked, blend, and return to the pot. That way there are still some chunks of potatoes left. Also, avoid rinsing your potatoes after cubing them, as the starch will help the soup to thicken as well.  Great recipe!

I substituted chicken broth for the water, omitted the bouillon cube, and added a pinch of cayenne pepper and this was delicious. A great quick meal on a cold night.

GOod, nice flavor.  I used 3 onions and 5 potatoes.  The recipe calls for perhaps a bit too many onions.  Next time I make it I will use 2 or less onions.  And use a big pot!  Taste overall is very good.

I LOVED this soup! Husband - who isn't a big potato fan - thought that it was pretty good. The only changes I made were to use canned chickie broth instead of water, and I didn't bother with the egg yolks. I very nearly used heavy cream instead of sour cream, and I am so glad I didn't. It was so delicious! I will definitely be making this again. Thanks, Rita!

This was an instant hit with the entire family.  We all loved it.  Even better with a handful of grated cheese sprinkled over each serving.

I discovered this recipe about 2 years ago when my husband had oral surgery and could not eat solid foods.  I was looking for something really hearty and satisfying and this really delivered.  I used an immersion blender to make it smooth enough for him to eat-perfect!  I have since shared this recipe with several people who were on liquid diets and it is always well received.  I don't always add the eggs, it's good both ways.  Tonight I'm going to try substituting leeks for some of the onions.  I almost always use more bacon than is called for in the recipe.

The soup is over all very good! It needs to be thickened a little and some spice's added to it but over all it was very good.

We loved this!  I added lean deer sausage and it was perfect.  I can't wait to get more sausage and make it again next year.   I did'nt use the egg yolks or parsley and instead put cheddar cheese on top along with the bacon bits.  This is a perfect base to add what you like and make it your own.

I made this recipe tonight according to most of the directions, I used Knorr vegetable bouillon mixed with the water called for in the recipe according to the directions (1tsp/cup) and added some finely chopped carrot for colour.  It was FABULOUS, my husband and I loved it and I will definitely be making it again.

This is a delicious soup recipe base--streamlined, tasty, and nutritious. Thanks, Rita! 

I modified this recipe to create my first successful cream soup. I don't eat meat, and so substituted finely sliced garlic, green onions, and minced celery for the bacon. I started by sauteing the yellow onions, added the celery and green onions, and then added the garlic after the onions had softened so it wouldn't burn and become bitter. I didn't have bouillon on hand, but the vegetables made up for it. I added salt to taste to replace the salt from the bouillon.

I substituted plain yogurt and a dash of lime juice for the sour cream. 

I took the advice of another reviewer and added several ladles of the hot soup to the separate bowl containing the egg/yogurt mixture. I mixed that well, and then returned the mixture to the hot soup pot. 

I took the suggestion of several others and added cayenne pepper. My partner loved it! The cayenne pepper is a keeper!

This could use a little more seasoning than the way it is written.  Also, it does not reheat well.

This is a GREAT base recipe! Definitely needs you to add spices to your own tastes (I added garlic, a sprinkle of cayenne and some other various spices). Really great. My whole family including my picky 3 year old loved this. Excellent.

This soup was too strong for my taste when I served it in its original chunky form, as recommended. However, I added some water and pureed it in a blender so that the richness of the potatoes could balance the tartness of the sour cream...it was still a bit too strong for me, but vastly improved. Recommendation: add the water a little at a time until you reach your desired consistency and taste. You don't want to overdo it - once it's in there, you can't take it out. Also, I made it without the bacon and it seemed just fine.

Great - was fun to cook this!!  For the liquid - I used 3 cups water and 1 and 1/4 cup of evaporated milk.  I also was out of bouillon cubes - so just used a lot of salt/pepper/beau monde seasoning.  I let this soup simmer for an hour on low - with lots of stirring.  I also decreased the sour cream - I only had 1 cup!!  I mixed dried parsley in with the egg yolk/sour cream and let sit before mixing with the soup.  Deeee-licious!!!

This is very good indeed.  I made this with English bacon and it's excellent.  I used  a pack which is actually six slices.  As I had no sour cream, I used thick yogurt, and it came out very very nicely indeed.

Thanks so much for sharing, Rita!

It probably tasted a LOT better with bacon, but seeing that I did NOT have bacon in the house, I used cheese and various other spices. The recipe itself tasted a little bland, but once I added SALSA to the mix, it was great! My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed it! We use the food bank for the time being, and we get a LOT of potatoes and onions, so this recipe is a delicious, quick, and easy meal!

I had high hopes for this recipe. When I was in high school, I had an operation that required my jaw be wired shut for 6 weeks. So all my food had to be liquid and my father used to make me a nice mixture of bacon, eggs, potato with milk. I was hoping this recipe would be like it. No luck. I substituted half and half for the sour cream. The result was a pastelike tasteless mass whose only flavor was of too strong onion.

I have been looking for a delicious potato soup to replace my Panera addiction (Their quality has been too inconsistent lately and it isn't available every day). I've already tried many recipes, and I'm sure there may be others that are equally good, but I believe that once you find what you've been looking for -- stop looking! This recipe intrigued me because of the unusual (to me) use of sour cream and egg yolks, as well as the amount of onions (which I love in soups). The recipe was very easy, although I did make a few changes based on what I had in the house and/or personal preferences: I used almost a pound of bacon, 3 cans of chicken broth instead of the water and bouillon cube, and some pepper and sliced garlic. It is the most delicious potato soup that I have ever tasted, and I thank you Rita, for sharing it. The sour cream, egg and large amount of onions that you used for this recipe must have been the ingredients that put it over the top!

Very tasty. I didn't add the eggs. I used some celery and cabbage, which I saluted with the onions. I used vegetable broth instead on the water and bouillon. I also added ham diced up after I added the potatoes.

Not a bad recipe at all. I changed the vegetable bouillon to chicken and added some cut up, boneless, chicken breast. I also increased the potato count and decreased the onion.  Came out real good on this cold day. The only other thing I will change next time is to decrease the butter. You already have the fat from the bacon. You really don't need that much butter. Just saying.

Not a bad recipe to start with.. I swapped out bacon for homemade polska keilbasa, used nonfat yogurt instead of cream and eggs, and seasoned with red chili, garlic, salt and pepper. I left my potatoes in cubes and thickened with a little flour and butter/sausage fat. I used chicken stock as my base and added some shredded cheddar, mustard and apple cider vinegar to cut the richness. Delish!

Delicious! My wife and kids were very pleased. I also added some asparagus, and instead of parsley I chopped up some spinach to add some vitamin A. I also added salt as well.
