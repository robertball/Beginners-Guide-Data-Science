Tasty, but super salty (I am a salt lover). I even used over a pound of ground pork, but the salt is really just too much, so next time I will def cut that back by at least 1/2. Other than that, this had really nice flavor...I also added in 1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes for a bit of spice, and that was the perfect amount for us.  I rolled mine into balls and baked them @ 350 degrees for about 15-20 minutes. The family enjoyed these and I would def make them again (reducing the salt, of course). Thanks for sharing. :)

So thankful for this recipe! Just started Paleo and breakfast is the most confounding. These sausages are a lifesaver! They're delicious and portable. I didn't have any turmeric which was a bummer because I really liked the nice color in the picture. I also put them in the oven at 350 for 20 minutes because I wasn't patient enough to fry them up. Bravo! Will make again for sure.

Good recipe. I only use 1/2 tsp of salt and would recommend omitting the turmeric as it stinks up the house when cooking the sausage.

if i would have followed this blindly it would have been way too salty.. this was more of a 3.5* recipe.. Turkey Breakfast Sausage (on this site) is my go-to recipe but i wanted to try something different.. i used ground turkey for the pork.. cut the salt in half.. used ground sage for the dried and quartered the amount.. bf said it was okay but likes Turkey Breakfast Sausage more.. ty for something different
