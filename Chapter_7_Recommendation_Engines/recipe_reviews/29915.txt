WOW, this recipe is great! In case you didn't know, quinoa (pronounced keen-wah) contains more protein than any other grain. Since it also contains a good amount of lysine, it is a complete protein. I made a few changes to the recipe - only had organic beef stock (in the box) and dried herbs. Used a couple of green onions and two cloves of garlic. Also added a little ground pepper. Great and easy way to serve up quinoa. Note about rinsing or soaking: normally, quinoa has a bitter saponins coating that is removed by soaking it or rinsing it. Most of the quinoa sold in the USA has already had the coating removed so rinsing is not required. But best check your source!

I loved this.  I used organic quinoa, so it had to be thoroughly rinsed so that it wouldn't be bitter.I sauteed the onions and garlic before toasting the quinoa, then threw it into a rice cooker with the broth and seasoning to finish. Amazingly good.

I had never heard of quinoa before yesterday. I heard mention of it on TV, so I thought I would learn more about it from the Internet. Everything that I learned pointed toward quinoa as the most nutritious grain out there, so I had to try it. I followed the direction of others and really enjoyed this dish. I began by melting the butter and sautéing the onion and garlic for two minutes. Then I added the quinoa and returned to the recipe. I chose to use chicken broth instead of vegetable and decided to add some shrimp seven minutes into the simmer. Once I got past the strange texture of this grain, I really enjoyed it. I will make this recipe again. Trust me, you don’t have to be a health nut to enjoy this recipe. (By the way, it took about 25 minutes or more for the grain to incorporate all of the liquid.)

Very good.  Made a few changes.  Cooked the onions when i was toasting the quinoa.  Also added in diced red pepper.  Before simmering I added in all the spices except the parsely.  After simmering I added in parsely and lemon juice.  But VERY good!

3 out of 6 of us are gluten intolerant.  I happened upon this recipe and it has forever changed our life!  My husband (who is not a celiac) LOVES this recipe and has requested I find as many recipes as I can about quinoa because it's so healthy.  I do sautee the onion and garlic with the quinoa and I use water and GF ckn. bouillon instead of the vegetable broth.  Love, love, love this recipe!  Thanks for the great rice alternative for my whole family.

Nice alternative to rice. Used low sodium low fat chicken broth - there was no need to add additional butter or salt to make it tasty. The texture is similiar to wild rice, which my son doesn't like so he wasn't a fan, but the rest of the family and the neighbors loved it. Will definately make again.

This recipe is excellent!  I watch the glycemic index of foods I eat, and quinoa is a low GI food (35.)  I've been looking for recipes for quinoa to include in my diet, and this was a great addition!

Difficult to find tasty quinoa recipes, but this is a good one!  I didn't have vegetable broth, so substituted chicken broth instead and omitted the onions (husband hates them).  I have made this countless times and passed the recipe on, too - always turns out delicious!

My first time trying quinoa. This dish had great flavor! I sauteed the onion and mushrooms (which I added) before browning the quinoa, and it was a good move. Update: I've tried this same recipe with bulgur and it was fabulous!

Very good, but I'm confused about the rinsing.  I've looked at other recipes that involve toasting the quinoa first and they don't mention rinsing.  I checked out a site that sells it and they say they pre-rinse so the consumer doesn't need to.  Guess it depends on the kind you buy?

This was delicious!  I halved the recipe because I 'thought' it would be just me eating this.  I too sauteed the onions (red because that was all I had on hand) and garlic before adding the quinoa.  I made this as a last minute thought...so I had to use dried parsley and didn't even have thyme on hand.  Used chicken broth and instead of lemon juice I used a couple of good shakes of a lemon seasoning blend.  When most of the broth was absorbed I just kept it covered and off the heat heat and it was a perfect combination of creamy and crunchy.  I can see the possibility of adding lots of different veggie combos...peas, carrots, etc. to make pilaf.  Very versatile.  And I should have made the full recipe because my 12 y.o. tried it, loved it, and ate most of it.  Thanks so much for sharing!  (oh yeah...I rinsed the quinoa well before adding to the butter by putting it my cone shaped mesh coffee filter and running lots of water over it...easy!)

I love this side dish.  I've made it as least 3 or 4 times now. If I don't have either fresh parsley of fresh thyme, I've used dried and barely noticed the difference.  I think it is better with fresh lemon juice, but I used bottled lemon juice when I don't have lemons on hand.  I like my onions cooked, so I cook them in the pan before I add the quinoa.  I did notice that the cook time for the quinoa seemed a little short to me. I ended up leaving it on the stove for at least 5 more minutes until it was tender and the quinoa had at least doubled in size.  Thanks for the delicious recipe!

The taste and ease of this recipe deserves 5 stars- I marked it down just because I changed it a tad, and it took a bit longer than 15 minutes to cook...  I rinsed my quinoa first, then "toasted" it with the butter, garlic & onion.  It never really toasted though, probably because I had to rinse it first. I used Chicken broth and think that if you are rinsing your quinoa- 2 cups of broth is definitely too much- I will make this again with 1-1/2 cups.  I added the Thyme, Parsley, Lemon juice, salt & pepper at the end and it tasted amazing!  My hubby even went back for 2nds! :)  Thank You!

My first experience with quinoa and I wanted to try it because it is suppose to be a "power" food.  I was not impressed.  It is fairly expensive and is so tiny it's hard to keep track of--measuring, cooking and eating.  This recipe did not have much flavor.   There are better things out there.

A great intro to Quinoa!  This was my first time cooking quinoa.  I used red quinoa and it worked great.  I took some external advice and soaked the quinoa in water with a TBSP of apple cider vinegar for about 15-20 minutes before rinsing it.  I also cooked the onion and garlic with the quinoa before adding the broth.  DELISH!  I will definitely be eating this stuff more often!

you should mention rinsing quinoa well. It has a natural insecticide that will taste bitter if not rinsed.

This was out first time trying Quinoa.  We really, really liked it.  This recipe is a very good one, and we will be eating this more often, as it is a low glycemic index food which is good for diabetics.  Thanks for this terrific recipe.

I didn't care for this, but it could be just because I don't like quinoa - it's the first time I've tried it. I cooked the garlic and onion before mixing it in the quinoa, maybe that was the problem? I found this recipe didn't have much flavor.

I made this dish on Sunday night and was very impressed! I've never had Quinoa before but seen it on the Dr. OZ show (he highly recommends Quinoa) and thought I would give it a try. Found your recipe, made it and loved it.  Just saved the recipe to my box so that I never lose it. Thank you for sharing!

My second quinoa experience, and this turned out very good!  I didn't have fresh parsley or thyme, so I used dried (1/3 of the amount).  I didn't add the salt, either, because my broth was salty enough.

This is very nice.  I started with the butter, and added the onions and spices along with the quinoa- sauteed for about 10 minutes.  Quinoa never did brown.  I didn't have fresh thyme so used 1 tsp of dried and a generous pinch of dried rosemary.  Then I used low sodium beef broth because that is what I had on hand.  I cooked it exactly 15 minutes then let it set for about 5, still covered but off of the heat.  I liked it then, so I added a can of sliced mushrooms.    Re: rinsing- I covered it with cold water, as I had read elsewhere, but the liquid was clear- so I just rinsed it a couple of short rinses with cold water then cooked it.  I'll try it again and probably add carrots to the sautee pan for color.

We LOVED this and will be making it again and again!  We are still pretty new to eating Quinoa and I was almost giving up on finding a good recipe when I found this beauty.  I followed the recipe and tweaked it just a bit after reference to other comments and using up veggies from the fridge. 1 c quinoa, 2 c vegetable broth (I will use 1 3/4 cups of it next time as its a bit too soft for my liking with 2 cups), 1 diced med carrot, 1/4 red pepper, 1/2 orange pepper,  1 packed cup of fresh spinach, 1 small shallot, 2 cloves garlic, 1/2 tsp lemon juice, 1/2 tsp dried thyme. I cooked the veggies w/garlic & shallot and lightly toasted the quinoa, it really adds a nice flavor to toast it. I then added it all into rice cooker with veggie broth, lemon & thyme & a bit of salt. You might want to make extra just to have leftovers with this one!

This was our family's first time trying quinoa. All but our 6 year old daughter loved it. The only changes I made were instead of tossing the onions in after cooking, I sauteed them with the quinoa. I also added the herbs while simmering, and I substituted the parsley for sage, and the vegetable broth for chicken broth. It turned out wonderfully... I can imagine if I had followed the original recipe, it would have been equally as delicious, as this is as quinoa is as versatile as rice. DELISH!

First time trying quinoa and I'm in love. I cut the oil in half and sautéed the onion with the quinoa, like someone suggested, then added the garlic with the broth. Making this again...

I used chicken brother because I had it on hand and no thyme because I had none. I cooked the garlic and onion with the quinoa and added the parsley and lemon at the end. Turned out great!

A note to all those who ask, yes you can use a rice cooker. Same proportions and everything. And a note to the Quinoa commentator, grains are seeds, just like Quinoa. I couldn't imagine not frying the onions first on this recipe, but it is a recipe that you can change however you like. I added in Pine Nuts!

Excellent!! Very, very tasty. The only think I did different was after I added the broth to the quinoa I also added the onion and garlic so it would soften up.  Just a preference.  My husband loved it!  Will be making again soon.

This was our first time eating Quinoa and it was amazing, I will continue to use it especially for its health benfits. The garlic explodes in your mouth and definately do not leave out the splash or more of fresh squeeze lemon juice, it gives it a tangy flavor giving it a boost. I used the dry herbs and it came it great my family wanted more. This will be our new side dish. Thanks Sal this is a great recipe

Fantastic!  I sauteed the garlic and onions, removed from pan, then browned the quinoa.  The thought of raw onion and garlic were not appealing.  I used ckn broth so no salt was needed.  Can't wait to try this same recipe with buckwheat groat or spelt.

I make Quinoa on a regular basis but some of my dishes are quite cumbersome and time consuming, so as an Easter side dish where I needed a large portion I though this recipe would fit the bill  Conceptually, it's great.  Veges, Quinoa, seasoning.  But there's just something about the combination that doesn't work.  I followed the recipe to a T, only adding some finely chopped red bell pepper for color, but it was a flop.  The bites tasted good but there was an after taste that was terrible.  I think it was the thyme, though it's odd because I generally like time.  Can't pinpoint it but put it this way, no one could get enough of my other dishes and this one was left with barely a dent taken out (by regular quinoa eaters)

My husband and I both enjoyed this.  I stir fried the onions and garlic and some sweet bell pepper along with the quinoa.  I used chicken stock instead of vegetable stock the cause that was what we had in the house and omitted the lemon juice.  My only difficulty was that it required considerably more cooking time than the recipe stated.  I checked it after 15 minutes and found that the water was only 2/3 absorbed and the grain was too crunchy for my taste.  I simmered it another 10 minutes and it tasted good, but there was still considerable water in the bottom of the pan.  As it happened, I let it sit covered for another 20 minutes before it was time to serve.  After all that sitting, the water was all absorbed and it was delicious.

This was delicious!  I've been disappointed with other quinoa recipes, and I thought this one would turn out similarly, but boy was I wrong.  I didn't have vegetable broth so I used water instead, and it still turned out amazing.  Ate this with "Zucchini with Pecans" from this site and it was fantastic.  I will definitely be making this again!

This was so good!  I never thought of cooking the quinoa in chicken broth.  The only thing I might do differently next time is saute the onions before adding them.  I will definitely make this again!

It was my first time trying Quinoa.  I used Red Mill Quinoa so I did not rinse it.  I thought it sounded strange to add the ingredients at the end after cooking the quinoa so I sauted the onion and 2 cloves of garlic before browning the quinoa.  When it was simmering I tossed in the salt & thyme.  Only when it was finished did I add the parsley and a quick squeeze of lemon.  (I used Turkey broth leftover from Thanksgiving).  My result was a very bland quinoa.....maybe throwing in uncooked onions and garlic as recipe states would have helped with favor? However I cannot imagine eating it with raw onions and garlic. I will not make this again, however I will continue to experiment with quinoa.

I made this for the first time tonight and loved it. I sauteed the onion and garlic in olive oil first. I also substituted half a teaspoon thyme for the fresh. The result was a wonderful side dish that will definitely appear on my table for dinner again.

As others I sauteed onions, garlic and mushrooms and also added prawns.  Instead of 1 Tablespoon of butter, I used one teaspoon of olive oil to make it a bit healthier... Delish and a definite keeper in our household.

Like others, this was my first time trying quinoa.  The bag said it was prewashed, so I didn't rinse it.  Maybe I should have and it wouldn't have tasted so bitter to me.  Or maybe I just don't like quinoa.

I sauteed the onions in butter first, then added the quinoa to toast, followed by chicken broth (didn't have vegetable).  Tasted wonderful, but added strained/diced tomatoes for an extra kick.  YUM--kids even liked it!!  Excellent recipe Sal, thank you!!

This is a great recipe.  The flavors meld very well together.  I didn't saute my garlic and onion first and glad I didn't.  The onion gave the dish a mild crunch.  The heat from the hot quinoa cooks the garlic and onion anyway.  The combination of textures is what makes this recipe great.  I did however make this with no-chik stock (vegetarian) and also put lemon zest instead of lemon juice.  The zest gave it a nice look and also the freshness that lemon is used for.  I will make this over and over again.

So simple.  I threw in some finely chopped carrot to simmer with the quinoa.  I do not, however, use the dash of lemon use.  Instead, I add a pinch of Emeril's BAM.  Very tasty and looks like you went through more trouble than you did to prepare this.  This is a go-to side for me, suitable for any protein or just by itself.

I did not care for this recipe.  I followed the recipe to a 't' and this was flavorless.  All I could really taste was the broth which was not good standing just as it was.  Disappointed.  I'll try not to take it out on the quinoa.

Good recipe.
Quinoa is a Gluten Free grain, making it a nice change from rice. Also doesn't over cook as easily as rice. It can be used in just about any recipe as a substitute grain. Try it in Tabouleh instead of bulgur wheat.

Wonderful recipe!  Used chicken broth instead of veggie broth b/c that's what I keep on hand, and toped with a little drizzle of olive oil before serving.  So good my husband has asked for it again!

My first time making and eating quinoa. I took it to a family gathering. Those who tried it liked it. The dash of lemon really brightens it up. It's a keeper and so simple and quick. The only changes I made, I used chicken base and dry minced onion. :)

Fantastic!! A quinoa side that even my kids will eat!! Have tried many other recipes before and none were tasty enough or too complicated for a Monday night side. Only change was that I sauteed the garlic and onions before toasting the quinoa! Thanks!!

My husband and I are not naturals in the kitchen.  However, we were able to create this delicious side dish easily!  Easy to make, a healthier side dish option, and packed with great flavor!  I think next time I make it, I will add the onions in early to brown up with the quinoa.

I just couldn't get past the weird texture and flavor of quinoa.  I'm sure this recipe is fine otherwise.  I did find it weird to put raw onions and garlic in here, so I sauted it.   I cooked mine exactly for 15 mins and it seemed done to me.  Anyway, I was also worried about the sodium content of the veggie stock along with the added salt so I used water.   All in all I'll probably give up on quinoa.

A great quinoa side that would complement many different main dishes. I used dried spices (on hand) and added them when it was simmering. The kids ate it without complaining, which is rare with quinoa.

Wow!  I had never eaten quinoa before and since I am trying to eat healthier I thought I'd give this recipe a try.  I subbed olive oil for butter as a healthier choice and did add more lemon at the end just because I love lemon.  I also followed the advice of others and sautéed the onions and garlic first before adding the quinoa.  I followed the rest of the recipe and it was amazing.  Thanks Sal for such a great recipe I am hooked on quinoa now!

I loved this recipe but I found the thyme a little overpowering.  I followed other reviews to saute the onions at the beginning and I added some orange pepper to the onions.  I tasted it to see whether it was done and loved the flavour.  Once I added the thyme, garlic and parsley and tasted again though, it wasn't as good.  I will definately make again but leave out the thyme.

I also sauteed the onions and garlic. Used chicken broth, dried parsley, sea salt, and mixed in a large tablespoon of apricot jam (this was a side dish with apricot and honey glazed chicken). I guess I totally changed the recipe but I'd never made quinoa before and was very excited with how well it turned out.

We enjoyed this. It was the first time either of us had quinoa and I was glad I chose this recipe. It's easy to prepare and has great flavour. I will definitely make it again as it is a nice change from rice. I sauteed the garlic and onion in the butter with the quinoa as some of the other reviewers said to do as I wasn't keen on the idea of raw onion.

very tasty! Although i think the chopped onion should be minced or maybe fryed till soft before mixing with the Quinoa becuase the chrunchy onion texture over powered the soft Quinoa i thought. Otherwise, exellent flavor!

I cooked the onion and garlic with the quinoa to add some extra flavor. There was just a flavor that was missing from this dish. When I warm it up tomorrow I'm going to try adding some cumin to it to spice it up.

I wanted a little more excitement from this recipe, so I made some changes and it came out really well: I used olive oil instead of butter.  1 cup broth, 1 cup water.  Skipped the parsley cuz I hate parsley.  I add about a 1tsp curry power to the liquid before it boils.  Then add about a 1/3 of a cup frozen peas with about 5min left to cook.

Delicious.  I sauted the onions and garlic first, then just added the quinoa to it.  I also sauted mushrooms and celery with the onions for added vegetables and flavour.  Also, i replaced 1/4 cup of the stock with white wine.

Wow!  I made quinoa last year and didn't really like it, but I had half the box left so decided to try this recipe.  It is amazing.  I added fresh basil, and lots of diced veggies (tomatoes, mushrooms, onions, garlic, bell pepper, and zucchini).  It was a huge hit, and I'll be buying quinoa again and again just to make this recipe.

This is a delicious recipe and my whole family loved it.  I took the advice of other posters and sauteed the onion and garlic while toasting the quinoa.  It also tastes great without the lemon.  Since it's winter, I used all dry herbs and added them with the liquid.  This has gone into regular rotation at my house.  Thanks!

This was pretty good, but it had waaaaay too much onion in it!  When I make it again, I'll use at least half the onion.  Maybe even less.  Otherwise, it was a good recipe.

Remember to rinse Quinoa several times before cooking. Helps to eliminate the natural bitterness.It has a natural coating of saponin. I found some organic brands to be less bitter. to use as fresh sprouts soak in warm water for 35-40 minutes. Yum.

Made this last night to go with roasted Swiss chard (another wonderful recipe from this site) and it was so good! I settled on this one since I had evertyhing it called for in the recipe and it was fairly quick to make.  I even had fresh thyme which was lovely in this! Only thing I did not put in was onion, the Swiss chard had a LOT of onion and I did not want to overdo.

I am loving Quinoa and always looking for new ways to fix it.. it is so healthy and filling.

I just made this for dinner, and it was a hit! Super delicious. I cooked the garlic and onion (until softened) in a separate pan with olive oil, then I added salt, pepper, crushed dried thyme and rosemary to it, then when the quinoa was done cooking, I added the onion "mixture" to it and it turned out great!

This was a tasty healthy recipe! Didn't have veggie stock, so I used Chicken. After melting butter, added the garlic and onion and sauté until onion became translucent. Then proceeded with remainder of recipe instructions. I will make again.

My husband's nutrionist recommended quinoa to substitute for his usual pasta and rice.  This was quick and easy to prepare, but more importantly, delicious.  Can't wait to try some other recipes.

I really love how simple this recipe is, it provides a nice base to play with.  Instead of vegetable broth I use low sodium chicken broth and add about 1/8 cup more, I omit the parsley and add about 1 tsp of black pepper.  Also, about 5-10 minutes before the quinoa is done cooking, I add chopped zucchini and squash and let it cook for another 10-15 minutes covered.  The vegetables cook so perfectly due to the extra 1/8 cup of broth and this makes it a complete side so I don't have to make a separate veggie dish.  Enjoy!

My favorite way to cook quinoa.  I sauteed the onions and a bellpepper with the quinoa.  I read some complaints on the bitterness and to fix that you soak it in water for about 30 minutes

I made this tonight without the herbs and with water instead of broth and it was fantastic. Toasting the quinoa made such a difference. My only problem with quinoa is unless I rinse it, it's sandy. That's a turnoff for me. Next time I'm rinsing, then draining well.

This is a great recipe for a basic way to cook quinoa, and change up the ingredients to your taste! I used low-sodium chicken broth instead of veggie, so I didn't have to add the salt. I also cooked the onions with the quinoa, and opted for fresh grated ginger and fresh chopped basil instead of the parsley and thyme. I also added 1/2 teaspoon more of garlic (because who doesn't love garlic?!). I served it with steamed broccoli - overall an easy, quick, SUPER TASTY meal!

This recipe turned out delicious but I had to make some considerable modifications. First of all, toasted the quinoa for 5 min. is too long. Even at a low heat it will burn and start popping out of the pan. 3 min. is more realistic. Amount of broth needed is more like 4 cups instead of two. (I used chicken broth) Like others I added the garlic and onion while the quinoa cooked to enhance flavor. Instead of parsley I used cilantro and it was very flavorful. All in all a great recipe but less time browning the quinoa and more liquid are needed.

This was delicious!  My 6-year old ate it right up.  Since he doesn't like onion pieces, I pulverized the onion in my MagicBullet and cooked it with the qunioa.  Turned our great and will make it again!

It added a good flavorto the quinoa, but the thyme was a little too lemony for my taste. We added some cilantro, and that seemed to add a good taste also.

This was a nice change from rice.  I changed the method by including the onion while toasting the quinoa.  Raw onion in the pilaf didn't appeal to me.

I added cooked multi-colored peppers, onion, and garlic to the quinoa once it was browned.  I did not have fresh parsley or thyme.  Therefore, I added the dried seasonings.  This was a wonderful dish.  My husband did not care for it (but he ate it...), however, our sons enjoyed it!  I agree that the lemon juice seems to perk up the flavor.  Thank you and I will make this again!!!

This quinoa was pretty good.  I didn't use any butter or toast my quinoa.  I made it according to package directions using the broth in place of water.  I didn't have fresh thyme so I used about 1/4 teaspoon of dried and added it toward the end of the cooking process of the quinoa along with the garlic.  Used only about 1/2 of a large onion and the lemon gave it a nice touch.  Added a dash of black pepper too the mix too... will make again! :)

This was my first time making quinoa, and I must say, it is very good. But I didn't follow the recipe exactly: I sauteed the garlic and onion and then toasted the quinoa. I found the end result a bit bland, so I recommend adding triple the salt, double the lemon juice, and triple the thyme.

a terrific quinoa rec., particulartly due to the fresh herbs.  don't be intimidated by fresh herbs, just wash them when you get home and let them dry on your counter.  next day just stuff them into little freezer bags.  then they are good to go in whatever amt., etc.  must cook for hubs who now is on a low chol diet so this is very appreciated.  omitted butter in lieu of evoo.

I was initially nervous about how this one would turn out being that it has raw onions and garlic in the dish. I thought it may have overpowered the dish. However, to my delightful surprise, it was amazing. I will be making this recipe again! Thank you for sharing!

Made quinoa for the first time and thought the preperation was pretty quick and easy (browned quinoa first then added garlic/onion until translucent before adding the broth) but after it was cooked, I gave it taste and it was bitter! I then realized that most of quinoas require rinsing it first! ooops! Well besides from experiencing the bitterness, the texture was something I would have to adjus to.

I give this four stars only because I cooked the onion and used dried herbs. A wonderful recipe. My husband is from Ecuador and loved it! I don't think you can get a better review than that!

First time cooking quinoa...maybe I over did it...really mushy, way too garlicky and oniony (sauteed onion and garlic in butter first).  Husband thought it was pretty good...but the leftovers stayed in the fridge until they had to be thrown out.  Thank you anyway.

This was my first time making quinoa, and I can easily say that this is probably my new favorite recipe!  I added the chopped garlic to the butter and sauteed some broccoli, shiitake mushrooms and sliced carrots instead of the onion before toasting, and it came out fabulous!  I also added some black pepper and garlic powder to the broth before cooking in addition to the parsley and thyme.  This one is a keeper!

If I were to make this again, I would sautee the onion and garlic, then add in the spices and parsley, and cook it all together with the quinoa. Adding it all in at the end didn't work well in my opinion. The raw onion and garlic were too overpowering. The recipe should direct to rinse the quinoa first (if it is unpolished, which it typically is). If you don't, this dish will be awfully bitter.

This was a nice change from a normal rice pilaf and very easy to make.  As another reviewer suggested, I sauteed the garlic and onion first and then added the quinoa to be browned.  I think next time I will experiment with adding some other spices to it.  It was really good, but needed just a little more flavor.

Very tasty.  Used organic chicken broth and switched out the onion for a smaller quantity of green onion.  Also added some diced Pink Lady apple for a little crunch.  I'm pretty sure anyone who likes couscous will find this quinoa recipe very versatile.

I did not care for this recipe.  And I'm considered a health food junkie.  Couldn't handle the aftertaste or texture.  IF..I ever make this again I'll have to hide the taste with more seasoning.  Perhaps stirring in hummus or salsa or pickle juice.(?)

Excellent recipe.  I've been looking for healthy alternatives to potatoes and rice and this was perfect.  I sauteed the onion and garlic before adding the broth, and I didn't rinse as some people suggested and it was just fine.

Great recipe.  For those who asked, quinoa needs to be rinsed of the bitter saponin coating unless otherwise directed on package labeling.  I measure what I want to use, soak it in a large cup of water for 20 minutes, dump it in a mesh sieve and rinse before proceeding by mixing it with some oil in a skillet and stirring periodically over medium heat to brown it lightly and bring out the nutty flavor.  Once browned a bit, I add enough hot water to exceed the top by about a 1/4 inch, cover it, lower the heat, set a timer for 15 minutes, turn the heat off at that point and let it sit with the cover on for another 10 minutes.  If I want it drier, I just remove the lid, turn on the heat and stir it until more water evaporates.  At this point I can refrigerate it so it's ready to go for any recipe.  It freezes well at this point, too - just be sure it's fridge-cold before freezing since the steam from warm food is what causes the proliferation of annoying ice crystals.   I keep a container of plain cooked quinoa in the freezer at all times so I can scrape some into oatmeal or scoop out some for a salad topper, etc.  It separates easily with minimal microwave power.  Amazing, nutritious, versatile stuff.

First time cooking quinoa, I used butter and put the onions and garlic in to cook with the quinoa. I used chicken broth to boil in and added some fresh thyme, cumin and cayenne pepper. Towards the end I added corn and peas. Very good alternative to rice.

Very good.  I saute'd the onions and garlic first as suggested by another rater.  I used chicken broth because I didn't have veggie broth.  We had it with Basil Pesto Chicken from an online blog - It was a really good dinner.

I did not care for this recipe. My husband ate his but didn't want it for lunch the next day (that never happens).  I don't usually toast it before I cook it; not sure if I want to try that again. :-( 

It seemed lacking in flavour, except that it was a bit bitter, even though I thoroughly rinsed the quinoa before cooking it. I am not sure I want to use the red variety again, at this point...

This was really tasty. I made a few modifications. To make mine a little healthier, I used butter spray instead of butter. For the broth I used reduced sodium chicken broth, it really adds to the flavor; I omitted the 1/4 tsp salt because it really isn't needed with all the other spices. I will definitely make this again.

Did same as other readers, sautéed garlic and onions before adding quinoa. Turned out well but, even though my husband went for seconds, just don't think quinoa greatly appeals to us.

I used dried rosemary in this I had no parsley.  Used a teaspoon in grinder with red pepper garlic salt and black pepper.  Shook with lemon juice rice vinegar a spot of grape seed oil and finely sliced onion.  Took a serving portion of the quinoa dressed lightly with the potion. So fine!

I've made this recipe many times. I always cook the onion and garlic with the quinoa. I also add about half a cup of sliced carrots and a bell pepper and instead of veggie broth, I use chicken.  When the quinoa is close to done I add some frozen peas. i think the vegetables make this dish so much tastier and more satisfying! I eat it more as a meal than a side but it is great with salmon! I think I may try adding some broccoli too next time.

This was ok, maybe needed more ingredients to add some flavor. Will make it again.

First time cooking quinoa and it was very tasty. Hubby said this recipe is definitely a keeper.
Didn't have fresh parsley so rehydrated 1.5 teaspoons in a small bowl.

I used this recipe to experience quinoa for the first time and I LOVED IT! It has a great comforting flavor, but light at the same time. I did saute half an onion first and then added the quinoa and garlic to toast. Used chicken bouillon and water for my broth, fresh thyme, and no parsley because that is just what I had on hand. This is a fabulous recipe that is going into my recipe box for future uses.

Perfect side dish!   I did use chicken broth in place of the veggie broth since that is what I had in the pantry.  My only other minor changes: switching the fresh herbs (I used basil & oregano) and using grapeseed oil instead of butter to keep it dairy free as well as gluten free.  My 2 yr. old grandson loved every bite!  Thanks for sharing your recipe!

Added extra spices and some lime juice, too. It was great on it's own as a side, but this goes especially well with a "saucy" meal... something that can been soaked up in the quinoa to add flavor.

Adds great flavor and seasoning to this dish.  I often add something crunchy, like nuts. But the flavors stand on their own.

The first time I ever made quinoa it was HORRID. Clearly I did not have this recipe. This is so good. I love the texture and the nutty taste that the quinoa gets when you toast it. I love the flavors and everything about this recipe. I did alter it just a little bit though. Instead of vegetable broth I did half and half chicken and beef broth and I used dried herbs instead of fresh. I only did this because I didn't want to run back to the store. 

This recipe has renewed my faith in quinoa. It may be all I eat from now on.

It was good. I left out the parsley and the thyme and sauteed the onion and garlic first. After it was boiling I put the whole thing in the oven for 375 degrees in a covered dish and let it cook for 15 minutes. It came out perfect, mild taste and not overwhelming. One of the kids liked it, the other did not.

Great side dish!  I like quinoa, but I usually have it as a base for another meal and never on it's own as a side.  It was delicious!  I added a diced green pepper.  I did not add the lemon juice.  I also didn't use fresh herbs, but dried herbs.  I feel that it makes more than 4 servings.  This is a side dish I will make again!

It is probably just personal taste but we did not care for this.  Initailly,  I used chicken broth to cook it in and it tasted great.  So I was really excited to add in all the other ingredients and see how much better it would be.  Unfortunately, I was disappointed.  Even though we do NOT eat bland food EVER, we felt like this was better with just the broth.  Maybe it would have been better if the other ingredients had cooked in it for a few minutes.  The taste of the dish was just not our thing.

This is simple and delicious.  I have tried several quinoa recipes but this one is the best so far.  I made a few modifications based on ingredients I had on hand.  Substituted chicken for veggie broth and used cilantro instead of parsley.  Like other reviewers I also sautéed the onion and garlic before combining.  But overall, yummy, easy, and a limited number of ingredients make this a goto quinquennial recipe.

Pretty good... I made this recipe exactly according to instructions although I used 1 tsp of dried thyme rather than 1/2 Tbsp of fresh thyme. The flavor was a little bland for our tastes, but was helped by a few extra squeezes of fresh lemon juice, a little more salt, and a sprinkle of fresh Parmesan. One great aspect of this recipe is toasting the quinoa, which added some personality to the dish.

As I have never used quinoa before, I was hoping this recipe didn't turn me off from it, and it definitely didn't!
I bought Kaniwa but followed all the same directions.  I sauteed the onion and garlic first and then reserved it in a separate bowl.  Served this atop halved acorn squash and it was excellent!

I thought the dish was decent but I would definitely make adjustments to it when making it again.  First, the store was out of vegetable broth and only had mushroom broth (I think it was a good addition).  I roasted a red pepper in the oven and tossed it in at the end.  I bought and added thyme as stated in the recipe, but I will definitely leave it out next time.  I will also throw in some other vegetables as well (peas, carrots).

Really good! I cooked the onions and dry seasonings with the quinoa rather than tossing it in afterward. I actually ended up tossing it with roasted garlic parmesan broccoli and it turned out awesome, but it was seriously tasty by itself. I made it for my husband to bring to work with his lunches this week, but I might have to make more to eat at home!

This is my first time trying Quinoa.  I actually really liked the texture and I'm sure I'll be experimenting with it more.  I really didn't like the flavor of this recipe.  I served it with a tilapia dish and this was really overpowering.  I was looking for something with a brighter, fresher flavor, and given the ingredients of this recipe I thought I'd get that.  Maybe it was the vegetable broth?  Perhaps water would've been better.

Excellent Recipe!  I made it as a side dish to go with some pan fried haddock and it was the perfect addition.  So much so that my kids asked if I would make it again.  This will become a staple in our house

This is the first time I've made Quinoa. I followed what others did and cooked the garlic and onion while toasting the Quinoa. I used olive oil instead of butter and it was good. I used fresh thyme and parsley and after tasting the finished product I decided it needed a bit more flavor. I fine chopped some raw onion and added it at the end like the original recipe calls for. 

Overall - if you don't like Quinoa, you won't like this. But if you've never tried it I would say this is a good starting point. 

I will make it again cooking the garlic and onion first but leaving a little onion on the side to add at the end. Thanks for the recipe!

I have made this a couple of times now.  It is really yummy.  I did saute the onions ahead of time since we don't like them too raw.

I've loved quinoa ever since discovering it and this recipe does an awesome job of bringing out the nutty flavor. Next time I might press the garlic instead of simply chopping it and try either less onion (my small onion probably yielded 1 C) or red onion.  Really complimented our steak with whiskey sauce well.

A nice, healthy side dish that doesn't compete with the other flavors in your meal.  I did saute the onion and garlic in the butter for a few minutes before adding the quinoa and broth, but other than that I stuck to the recipe.  I'm always looking for new ways to use quinoa because I use it as a protein source so often (I'm a vegetarian), so this recipe is a real gem for me.  Thanks for sharing!

This is a great base recipe...I would, however, leave out the salt. The broth contains more than enough for the recipe.

As a vegetarian, I substituted 'Better than Bouillon Vegetarian Chicken Flavored Base' for the broth and this was UNBELIEVABLE.  I only had dried herbs, so I no measurements to use them, I just used what I thought would suffice.  Did I mention this was unbelievable?!

this is excellent!! i made with chicken broth, and i also cooked the onion and garlic. i can't stand raw onion, and this didn't seem like the right recipe for raw garlic either. the thyme in my opinion really makes this dish excellent!! i also added a couple of grates of fresh parmesan cheese. yummy!!!

This was my first attempt at quinoa and I LOVED IT. Even my picky 12 year old ate it and didn't gag :P I didn't have any fresh herbs on hand (shame on me!) so I used dried Italian seasoning instead, and probably more garlic and lemon than was called for, but it was delish. I will definitely be making more of this and less of the processed white rice I've become so addicted to. Thank you!!

Quinoa Side Dish Haiku: "I love quinoa's 'bite', such an earthy, tender taste. Easy, hippie food!" My family's not the biggest fans of quinoa, but w/ the delicate addition of thyme, lemon, parsley and garlic, they couldn't get enough of the stuff tonight. Mine took closer to 25 min. to absorb all the liquid, and as a preference since I know that I wouldn't have liked the raw onion mixed in prior to serving, I softened the garlic and onion in the butter before adding the dry quinoa. While not screamingly-flavorful, this recipe's an easy way to prepare a healthy side dish.

Loved it. Used a bit of dried thyme because I didn't have it fresh. I also used chicken broth instead of veg broth. In my opinion, the lemon is NOT optional. It made this dish fantastic. No leftovers!

I could not stop eating it!! Wonderful! I used chicken broth and dried parsley since thats all I had. I used lemon thyme and lemon juice and thats definately what puts it over the top. The subtle lemon flavor is lovely but still lets the unique taste of the Quinoa come through. Highly recommend it.

This was delicious!  I used less butter and reduced fat/sodium chicken broth and I sauteed the garlic and onion before toasting the quinoa.  This was perfect and I will definitely make this again.  Thanks for the great recipe

I'd never had quinoa before and this was a great introduction to a whole new grain! I used two green onions instead of a regular onion and dried herbs still tasted great.

This is a great basic side dish that lends to a lot of additions, if wanted. I used olive oil instead of butter and threw in a few sliced mushrooms at the end. The lemon juice is almost a must as it really brings out the thyme.

My family is NOW eating Quinoa!  I have been trying different recipes that would meet my families approval and this is the one!  Thank You so Much!  I did as others suggested and sauteed the onions and garlic in butter before browning the quinoa.  Excellent!

Simple and delicious. I used 2 tbsp of beef boullion powder in lieu of vegetable broth (dissolved in 1 cup of hot water + another cup of plain water). I didn't use onions but the fresh thyme really made the dish GREAT! I still rinsed my quinoa (which was tough in itself) til the water was mostly clear. Next time I will use a little less water to cook because I didn't dry them after I rinsed and I could tell they had retained a bit of water. It did take maybe 25-30min to cook on low which was fine since I wasn't in a hurry. This is a really great and simple recipe, I'm happy I found something yummy and healthy to change up my white rice diet, lol. And since I'm part Peruvian, I feel a bit more connected to the ancestors :)

This is possibly the best quinoa dish I've tasted and made yet! The fresh herbs really add such a great flavor and my family gobbles it up...usually with no leftovers. I now make this at least once a week and have made a double batch for lunches. Tastes great as a cold side as well!! (btw I used a shallot instead of onion and opted to not use any extra salt)

Definitely a keeper!  Great quick-n-easy quinoa recipe that I'll use again and again.  I used red quinoa instead of the standard beige, and it looked rather Christmassy with the bits of parsley.  I used fresh lime juice instead of lemon at the end (only because I happened to have lime), and that really perked it up, I think.

Family loved and so did I. I had to use dry parsley and thyme and chicken broth, that is the only reason I didn't give 5 stars, because I didn't make it exactly the same.

Tasty, tasty, tasty. Definitely first saute the onions in the fat (I used olive oil) for about 5 minutes, then add the garlic and stir until fragrant.  Add your quinoa and let it cook with the onion mixture for a bit (like risotto) before adding your broth.  This will make a more cohesive flavor base, and not leave you with raw onions at the end.  The lemon juice gives a nice bright flavor.

I've made this several times now, and it consistently turns out great. The only substitution is that I use chicken bouillion plus water instead of vegetable stock. Just enough flavor, but easily adaptable to add your own touch. Thank you for the great recipe!

This was our 2nd try with quinoa and am so glad we didn't quit after our first try.  This is an excellent recipe.  I used chicken broth only because I was out of vegetable broth and followed the rest of the the recipe as written.  Will definitely use this one again.

Yummy side dish.  Sauteed the onion and garlic in the butter before adding the quinoa and broth.  Added a few green onions at the end.  I added the salt even though I was using chicken broth, but it wasn't too much.

INCREDIBLY GOOD DISH!!  I love quinoa and this recipe is a simple and very flavorful dish.  I skipped the toasting step and it still turned out great.  I chose to use chicken broth and I sauteed the onion and garlic prior to adding it in which both worked out great.  Definitely a great dish for anyone new to quinoa.

i'm not sure about the whole adding raw onions and garlic in the end thing. i thought those flavors really overpowered the dish and i wasn't able to make out the subtle nuttiness of the quinoa that i usually enjoy. i might try this recipe again, maybe next time sautéing the onions earlier. i do enjoy the crunch that the raw veggies give though, so i may try to use celery or bell peppers to replicate that.

A wonderful recipe for quinoa. I love quinoa, but have been having a hard time finding a good recipe for it. I sauted the garlic with the quinoa as others recomended, left out the onions, my husband is allergic to them, and added the mushrooms. I didn't have fresh herbs so I used dry ones. I also added diced carrots and chicken to make this a main dish. I absolutely loved it. I was so glad it turned out so good because I went ahead and doubled the recipe.

We made this for Passover, and it was delicious! I used parve chicken broth instead of vegetable broth and that added a lot of flavor. I also sauted the onions with the butter in the begining to soften them, and I added the garlic right before adding the quinoa. Even my H liked it!

Yummy!  A very quick and easy alternative to rice.  This would be great using any combination of herbs/spices.  I'll definitely make this again.

Delicious!  I added the onions and garlic to the toasting quinoa at the beginning, and used dried spices (I didn't have fresh on hand).  I have already made this twice!

Cooking quinoa was very new to me and I had been looking for a recipe that didn't scare me out of trying it...I'm so happy I found this one!  I cooked this for my family and they all LOVED it.  Quinoa is a healthier alternative to rice and this recipe was so full of taste and easy to make that it will become a staple in our weekly meals.  Thanks!

Unbelievably delicious. Everyone always asks me for the recipe. The herbs and garlic and butter really provide a nice fresh flavor to the otherwise fairly boring grain.

Great recipe, though I skipped toasting the quinoa in butter since I didn't want to add butter to the dish.  I used red onions and they were a nice, colorful addition to the dish.

I'm pretty new to quinoa and this dish looked like a good way to prepare the grain.  I used olive oil instead of the butter, and chicken stock instead of vegetable.  It took a very long while for the liquid to be absorbed by the quinoa, so much so that it made the grain rather mushy.  The dish had a very nice flavor to it and I think the lemon juice really made it taste light and fresh.  Also, I added the onions as stated in the recipe and thought the crispness they added was quite nice.  Will try again with less liquid.

Excellent alternative to the brown rice that we usually eat.  I used margarine (i/o butter), chicken broth i/o vegetable, and I sauteed my onion and garlic before adding.  I dont like eating raw onions and garlic and I think that sauteeing them first is a must.  I also used dried thyme and added dried basil as well as a little salt and pepper, I didnt have any thyme on hand.  We had this with salmon and a large green salad and it was the perfect "light" meal.

very good healthy grain alternative - will make a fan out of most who try it.  I used dried thyme and possibly too much at that - next time would try fresh - great!

We really liked this quinoa dish.  I substituted ghee, turkey broth, and onion, and used dried herbs because that's what I had on hand.  It was very tasty and ended up like a pilaf.

I made this recipe to and absolutely loved it! I was in a bit of a rush, so after I cooked the quinoa, I just added lemon juice and some fresh garlic. Love, love the texture and nutty flavor.

I have never made or eaten quinoa before, and thought as a side dish this would be a good introduction. I should have known, given the omission of sauteeing the onion and garlic (really, you never meant for these to be added raw, did you?) After dinner and looking at the reviews more closely, I discovered that quinoa must be rinsed/soaked first. This might have been good to know before cooking this dish. Never again. Goodbye quinoa, skip this dish!

I'm always on the look out for a new twist in serving quinoa.   This recipe did not make the cut.   Found it very bland and leftovers are not moving at all.   I'm forcing it down because I hate to waste food, but this is very mediocre.

Made this dish last night and really enjoyed it. I also sautéd the onion and half a red pepper.  Tossed in a hand full of pine nuts at the end with the lemon juice. Turned out great!

This was my first attempt at making quinoa.  I really liked this dish and so did my sons, so that means I will be making it again.  I also cooked the onion with the quinoa.  It was even better the next day!  Wonderful, delicious dish.

I thought it sounded a little plain so I added 2 stalks of celery chopped fine, 1 cup asparagus cut in chunks and 1 Tbsp. Mrs. Dash Original Blend.  We loved it.  If you don't have asparagus you could add another vegetable.

Just tried the recipe for the first time, made a couple of changes with seasonings, also I used organic coconut oil to saute. Definitely going to be a favorite side dish.

More like 2 stars for us but trying to be fair since I did not use fresh herbs.  I imagine fresh would make a huge difference.  I also sprayd my pan with olive oil instead of using butter.  Really not very good but could be better if using fresh herbs nd butter I suppose.  Will not be making this one again.

This was my 1st time making quinoa and we liked it.  I like the fact that it is a healthy option to other side dishes like rice or noodle dishes.  The fresh ingredients made all of the difference.  I will try more quinoa recipes after trying this introductory recipe.

I'm not giving this 5 stars because it is as good as a greasy cheeseburger or a delicious pasta in cream sauce.  However, I was looking for a very healthy meal and this quinoa paired very well with my ginger and cilantro baked talapia.  I cooked red onion with a mix of red and regular quinoa. Added the garlic and cooked for 30 sec before adding chicken broth.  I did add fresh parsley and the lemon juice.  It was great with the fish and a side of steamed Brussels sprouts.  This was a very low fat meal but so high in complete protein that my hub and I weren't snacking this evening.  I will make again.

First time I've prepared quinoa, and this was a great recipe for my first attempt.  I did make a couple of changes, but only because I had to use what was in my pantry, plus my husband doesn't care for chopped onions in dishes.  I used chicken broth (reduced sodium) instead of vegetable broth, sauteed the garlic with the quinoa, and used about a 2/4 tsp. of dried thyme.  Since I couldn't use diced onions, I added lots of onion powder (poor substitute, but...)

This was a very flavorful recipe.  I also used the changes suggested by others by sauteing the onions and garlic.  I can see adding all kinds of veggies to this and it being a whole meal.

This recipe was a big hit with the adults but not my kids. This was my first time cooking and eating quinoa and I was impressed. I agree with the other posts that the garlic and onion need to be put in the quinoa when browning. I used the garlic fresh and it was too potent. I had no trouble browning it and it really helped the flavour. I used the full amount of broth (chicken) and let it cook until it was all absorbed. I found that using the full amount of broth made the serving of quinoa go farther. I will make this again.

I used olive oil instead of butter, sautéed the garlic and onions with the quinoa, and used a can of chicken broth. I also added a dash of garlic salt.  The squeeze of lemon at the end lightened up the dish. There were no leftovers!!  Thank you so much for this recipe. It's a great basic recipe that allows for easy modifications. This makes eating healthier so easy.

Really good!! I honestly forgot all about toasting the quinoa, haha, until after I put the broth in! I did saute the onions in the butter first. Added chicken broth because that's what I had. Used about 1/2 tsp of garlic powder because I had no garlic, and added some freshly ground black pepper. I didn't have fresh thyme, but did have the parsley. This took closer to 30 minutes to cook. I added about 2 tbsp of lemon juice at the end with the parsley and this MADE the dish. I loved the tangy lemon. I seriously had to force myself to stop eating it!

LOVE! This is a wonderful and flavorful side dish! I just recently started using quinoa, and was testing the waters for ways to prepare it. My only changes to this were adding in the garlic at the beginning, so it toasted with the quinoa, and adding about 1/4 cup of lemon juice instead of a splash. It really kicked it up a notch.

I really loved this recipe! I'd eaten quinoa before but I wanted to change it up a bit- this looked really good. I rinsed the quinoa before cooking, and added the onions with the quinoa until brown. Then I added the garlic, and I added water because I didn't have any broth available. I also omitted the thyme because I didn't have any, but it  was still delicious! At the end I grated 2 garlic cloves and added it when it was done cooking, plus the lemon juice. It was AMAZING!

This was very good...I added extra onion and sauteed the onion and garlic first before adding the quinoa.  I didn't have fresh herbs so I added 1 1/2 tsp of parsley and 1 1/2 tsp of thyme and it was exceptional.  I didnt add the salt or lemon juice - it was perfect just the way it was.

Loved It.  I too sauted my veggies (gr & red peppers, yellow and red onions, and celery) before adding the quinoa.  I also used chicken stock.  Instead of adding salt, I sprinkled my portion with Maggi...didn't use the lemon juice.  I will definitely make this again...and the best part, it's easy to change things up with recipe.

Loved it! Eating leftovers as I type this. I have been looking to try this for a long time and was finally able to last night. I didn't have vegetable broth, but used chicken instead. I was happy that my husband liked it because I struggle with finding side dishes for him other than pasta - he isn't a rice fan.

Quite good!  I love making quinoa dishes as it's such a healthy grain.  I forgot to rate this one as I made over the weekend.  Scaled the recipe down and ended up grabbing red quinoa out of the cupboard, so used it.  The fresh herbs add a nice touch and keep it simple...nothing too overpowering going on in this recipe.  Love the squeeze of fresh lemon juice!

Yummy! I added some extra seasoning to spice it up a bit, as I found the original recipe just a bit on the bland side.

I made this for the first time tonight for my husband and our two dinner guests.  It was a HUGE hit. So tasty and easy to make.   I made a double batch and have just enough left over for me to have for breakfast in the morning.  I'll definitely be making this side dish again.

This was a good, basic side dish.  I felt it needed a bit more flavor though.  We'll definitely make it again and will play with seasonings.

DELICIOUS!  However, I just realized I am allergic to quinoa...apparently that is possible and YES I did rinse.  This is a great recipe and I am sad to not be able to eat it again...

I get the concept here: it's kind of like tabbouleh but with quinoa instead of bulgur wheat. My family really didn't like this recipe, though, and unfortunately it was our first try at quinoa. If you try this, start with adding no extra salt (besides what's in the broth), and add a little extra lemon.

This wasn't very good. It was edible but I wouldn't make it again. My husband said it tasted like broccoli... prob b/c of the veg broth.

I made it as directed and loved it then I cooked it all up in one pot and liked it better and it was easier.  Sautee the quinoa, add a large onion chopped and 2 carrots chopped fine and sauteed more.  I added one 14 oz can chicken broth instead of 2 c vegetable brothand the seasonings.  This was fine. I figured the large onion added enough moisture.  Cover and cook 20 min.

The raw onion absolutely overpowered the quinoa.  I didn't think this tasted very good, just barely edible.  I even used half an onion instead of a whole.  This recipe needs a lot of work.  I'm really at a loss why it's so highly rated.

5 stars for the blend of flavors, as the flavor of this dish was wonderful...but unfortunately the rest of my family did not like the texture of quinoa.  I will try substituting brown rice for quinoa next time to see if that goes over better.

Never tried quinoa before, but it is listed in the p90x recipe book.  Used olive oil instead of butter, and used green onions instead.  Excellent!!  This will be a staple in our household instead of rice from now on.  Nutritious and delicious.  Can't ask for anything better.

I have never made or eaten quinoa before and this was really good.  I did saute my onion and garlic with the quinoa in the initial step because I don't like raw onions, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  Very good healthy side dish -- this will become a side dish staple for me.

Wow it's so good.  This was my first time to cook with quinoa.  I liked the suggestions to saute the onion and garlic with the quinoa. Served it as my main dish for dinner with broccoflower as my side dish.   I love savory dishes for breakfast and I will be eating this for breakfast as well as for dinner.  It would be perfect for a brown bag lunch.

This is a great basic quinoa dish that you can add just about anything to from extra veggies to shrimp or chicken.  I used olive oil instead of butter and I suated my onions and garlic while toasting the quinoa.

I will make this recipe again. I cooked the garlic with the quinoa rather than adding it at the end since it can give me heartburn. I didn't have fresh thyme on hand so I used some dried. I tossed in chopped green onions with the parsley at the end.

This was AWESOME...very simple and clean tasting. Even my picky 14-month-old LOVED it (hallelujah)! She cleaned her plate and wanted more! Will definitely make this one again and again.  I used chicken broth instead of veggie broth, other than that I stuck to the recipe verbatim. Thanks!

I gave this 5 stars because it tastes great hot or cold. I used beef broth because I was serving with lamb, it was great! The next day we ate it cold and I added feta, loved it! A very versitle dish.

I was specifically looking for a simple recipe so that my husband and I could try quinoa.  I followed other reviewer's suggestions, and satueed the onion and garlic in the butter and also used chicken broth.  Also, I made sure to rinse the quinoa first. This recipe was very easy to make and I thought the result was delicious.  I will definitely make this again and I have already recommended it to a friend.

First time making and eating quinoa. Excellent! I am on a diabetic diet and am trying to eat healthy grains and just eat healthier. This works well into my program. I made the recipe for myself to enjoy later but I couldn't stop eating it after cooking it. It was wonderful. I did put in the lemon juice and recommend it. I had a hard time finding quinoa in our local grocery store and got it at a food coop. It is expensive but worth the money. I also rinsed it well before cooking. I must say that I like it refreshing and a nice change from rice.

This is a fantastic, easy recipe and it was almost better the second day. We're not huge onion fans so instead I chopped up some cherry tomatoes and added them at the end. It was a good substitution.

This was pretty good! It was my first time making Quinoa and I think it was a success!    I made it with the addition of chicken broth and bell peppers and I would definately recommend at least trying it.

I sauteed an onion and garlic before toasting the quinoa, and then added water (had no broth on me) with a bit of onion soup mix. Afterwards, added mint and chopped walnuts to the rest of the ingredients and a bit more than a 'dash' of lemon juice. I'm at risk of eating the entire thing by myself right now.

Great "change of pace" side dish with a light flavor. I served it with "Chicken Breast Stuffed with Blue Cheese" which was pretty rich and the quinoa helped balance it out.

Excellent dish. I add triple the onion, and appreciate that the onion is raw. I use red onion, and lots of fresh garlic. Thanks for a great recipe.

I thought this recipe was a little weird at first. I thought I would give it a try. Eating the first couple of bites it doesn't taste bad at all and it seems like a better alternative than rice.....I will make it again in the future.

Really great!  I used home-canned mushroom stock instead of chicken or vegetable and added 4 oz. of fresh mushrooms with the quinoa.  Used green onions instead of regular and it was a huge smash last night at dinner.  We had seconds!  Hubby doesn't care much for rice but loves this and it's so much healthier!  Thanks, Sal, for a great idea!

For a whole grain alternative, this is a great dish. I used chicken broth and did not add salt or any herbs/spices. I served it as an entree with two salads (one organic mix lettuce and the other cucumber). My family loved it and we'll be making it again...soon, I'm sure! :)

My first time making quinao. Had too much onion and way too much thyme for my taste (I did use fresh as the recipe called for).  I sauteed the onion and garlic along with the quinoa and used chicken instead of vegetable stock.  I'll make quinoa again using the basic methods in the recipe but will use less onion and switch the thyme for some other seasoning and probably throw some addtional veggies in.

I tried the recipe as given and found it a little bland.  The second time I added the garlic, onion, and lemon dash with the vegetable broth to let it all cook together.  Much improved.  I served it topped with shrimp (prepared separately) and loved it.  This will be added to my regular rotation for meals.

This was my first quinoa experience.  I used roasted garlic chicken broth because I'm not a veggie broth fan. I had a shallot so I substituted for the onion.  I sauteed the garlic and onion when I was toasting the quinoa.  Forgot to add the thyme and it was just fine.  My 6 year old loved it, despite saying it looked like fish eyes and frogs eggs!!  I thought it was very good and will definately make this recipe again.

I have been bored with the same old side dishes. This one is a great alternative. I loved it hot and cold. I was reluctant about the raw onion, but the heat takes away the onions bite &  was the perfect amount of crunch.

In preparation for a Sunday dinner, tried to take a short cut and steam quinoa in rice steamer, but after 30 minutes, much of the liquid still hadn't absorbed. Just placed in fridge, and returned a few hours later. To my surprise most of broth had absorbed. Placed in microwave for a ~3-5 minutes, but in the end had to strain. Used a couple more tablespoons of a light butter  just to add a little more flavor and moisture. Used dried spices, in addition to adding salt and pepper. Came out great.

I really enjoyed this recipe, but next time that I make it I will decrease the onion slightly. It was the perfect side dish for summer veggies and chicken. Thank you so much for sharing!

I made quinoa my first time with this recipe and I"m very pleased.  I did saute the onions for 5 minutes, then the garlic for 1 minute before I added the quinoa.  Also, I had to cook it about 20 minutes so maybe i cooked it on too low of temperature but it turned out very well.  I served it with some leftover cut up chicken breast and steamed veggies which we very much enjoyed.  I will definitely make this again.

Very tasty.  I added the onions and garlic in the saucepan while toasting the quinoa.  I also used half  low sodium chicken broth and half white wine instead of vegetable broth.  It came out really good!  As it is easy to make, I will definitely be adding this recipe to my go-to recipes.

I love this recipe! As a fairly new convert to quinoa, I was looking for a way to make it that would be super flavorful, and this was it! The first time I made it I added the thyme, but since then have left it out as the recipe doesn’t need it. This recipe is fantastic when made with either chicken or vegetable broth.

As someone who is both gluten intolerant and diabetic, rice is a no-no and finding side dishes that I can eat and my family will enjoy is no small feat. But this is the perfect side dish! My family raved. I did add diced red pepper but followed the recipe as it is otherwise. They've already asked me for this again! Thanks!

Used beef broth (had no chicken broth) and used onion pwdr vs chopped. It was quite a flavourful dish. An unexpected taste really. Yes, I would make it again.

I don't really have go-to recipes; I'm always experimenting with what's on hand. But I'd like some healthy, simple recipes that are good enough to repeat over and over. This one makes that list! Excellent flavor and fun texture. Only subs I made were apple cider vinegar instead of lemon juice, and I subbed in some Creeping Charlie weeds to augment my sparse parsley. Thanks for a keeper!

This recipe is simple and good. Changes I made: I did not have fresh thyme or parsley so I used dry (making the necessary changes in amounts for dry). I also followed other reviewer and sautéed the onions in the butter. I can't wait to make this again. I plan on adding some veggies to it next time. Thanks for sharing the recipe :-)

This recipe was delicious!  I did sautee the garlic and onion before adding it to the quinoa and used dried thyme, a little garlic powder and some parmesean cheese.  Just personal preference on the changes.

This is perfect for a side dish or Lunch entreé. I've paired it with chicken, salmon, pork, and steak. I've also just taken it as is for lunch! One suggestion, my husband and I found the taste to be rather bland using the vegetable broth so we have used chicken broth to give it a little flavor boost.

I saw one reviewer made it in their rice cooker, so I did that as well, after I had sautéed the onion, garlic, and quinoa.  When the quinoa was done, I added some chopped spinach.  I also made the "Arkansas Green Beans" recipe from allrecipes.com and after tasting them I mixed the two together to make one marvelous tasting dish.

My whole family loves this recipe, even my little kids who can be quite picky when they feel like it. I didn't have everything on hand so the only thing I substituted was chicken broth for vegetable broth. I loved using the fresh parsley and thyme! I am so glad to have found a delicious healthy quinoa recipe!

Great easy recipe. Only changes I made were cooking onion and garlic from the beginning in the butter to soften them. and I tossed in the thyme as it was cooking instead of after.  I also added some steamed broccoli which I broke up with a wooden spoon so that it was in very small pieces, almost blended in with the texture of the quinoa.

This was easy to make. This was the first time we have tried quinoa. It's like a better version of cous cous. We'll be making this again, it's a nice change of pace from our potato and rice based side dishes.

I have made quinoa multiple ways, but my husband has never actually liked it... until THIS!  I make it just as the recipe calls, except sometimes substituting dried minced onions out of laziness : )  If you are looking to cut down the fat for THM lifestyle, simply sauté it in a small amount of coconut oil spray!

I used olive oil instead of butter, cut out the salt completely, used a low sodium vegetable broth, and dried herbs. It was pretty tasty. Maybe a tiny bit dry but I didn't use much olive oil and it sat for a second or two on the stove top so I will blame my culinary skills on that. I really appreciated the flavor of the onions and garlic with the quinoa.

This was my first time making and eating quinoa. I am a picky eater and was kind of scared to try it, but I found it to be pretty good and I look forward to experimenting more with this food.

This was my first attempt at making quinoa not out from a box mix and we loved it!   I sauteed the onion & garlic at the beginning before adding the quinoa to it because I wouldn't have liked it crunchy.  I used chicken broth since it's all I had and was serving it as a side dish with chicken.  I stirred in only salt & parsley at the end.  Will definitely be making again!

I've been looking for new ways to make quinoa and came across this.  I rinsed my quinoa because the package told me to do so.  It's definitely more flavorful using the Vegetable Stock instead of cooking quinoa with regular water (I used Rachael Ray's Vegetable Stock).  I used the optional squeeze of lemon.  I liked the combination of flavors.

Made this as a side for Pork Ribs Piquant and it went over great. I used rice as I didn't have Quinoa and chicken broth instead of the vegetable broth. I also sauteed the onion and spices in butter then poured them into the rice.
Will definitely be looking for Quinoa when I shop so I can make it more authentic.

A new favorite in our house. I add vegetables sometimes or top with chicken or beef to make it a meal.

I spoke words tonight that I never thought I would hear myself say: "This quinoa is really good." Like someone else said they did, I cooked the garlic in the same pan when I toasted the quinoa. I caramelized the onions separately, but in retrospect I guess I didn't have to do that-I just could've cooked the onion and garlic in the same pan. Oh, and I didn't have any vegetable broth so I used chicken broth. The quinoa was definitely *not* quicker than rice-took more like 20 minutes. But if you want something a little healthier than rice or potatoes, or just want something different, give this a try. At first I didn't like the firmer texture of quinoa, but now I love it.

This was a great, light, summery dish! It went very well with lemon salmon! It would be good hot or cold.  The only change I made was to do chicken broth instead of vegetable broth, which I did due to what I had on hand, but also I think it tastes better. I finally have a quinoa recipe I enjoy!

SO GLAD I FOUND THIS RECIPE!!!

So many times I've attempted to cook quinoa and have failed miserably. This recipe made me feel like victory is mine! A couple of changes I have made to make this recipe better. I toasted the quinoa with a tablespoon of butter and a teaspoon of olive oil. I after 2 minutes of toasting the quinoa I added the diced onion. After dumping in the vegetable stock, I seasoned it heavily with sea salt and lemon pepper. I ended up having to cook the quinoa closer to 18 minutes as opposed to the recommended 15 minutes to have all the liquid absorbed. I didn't have thyme so I omitted that. Will definitely make again!!!

Great recipe - I followed a couple reviewers changes, using garlic olive oil instead of butter, chicken broth instead of veg, and dried seasonings, onion powder, pepper, etc. Mine also needed much more time than suggested to fluff up, but I expected that. Great way to add variety to a sometimes boring side dish! I served it with salmon and asparagus, and it went very well together.

I LOVED this recipe (after a simple change). The reason I gave it 4 stars is because I had to slightly change it. I sauted the onions and garlic in the butter before  adding the quinoa and then added the quinoa and continued to saute everything together.  I tried it the other way (as the recipe instructs) and the taste was quite different.  If you're new to quinoa this is a great way to introduce yourself to a great power food.

Very flavorful! I used vegetarian chicken broth (found at Whole Foods). I topped it with whole cashews for dinner with a side of broccoli.  Yum! Will make it again!

I made this as a side for a turkey.  My turkey got done cooking early, so I took some of the turkey broth and substituted for the veggie broth.  This turned out very tasty.  I'm thinking of using it for this years holidays, as a substitute for stuffing.  (I also used dried herbs because that is what I had available)

This was a great alternative to rice.  As others suggested, I first cooked the onions and garlic in the butter a little before adding in the quinoa to toast.  I used chicken broth instead of vegetable broth.  Like rice, I cooked it until the liquid had been absorbed.   It was really good.  I had guests for dinner, and it was their first experience with quinoa. They loved it, as did my husband.   Thank you, sal.

I have had quinoa before but never was overly impressed with it, but I think only had it undercooked so when I tried this recipe it makes sure it is fully cooked & it was wonderful. I'm actually going to be more careful in the future cooking other recipes with quinoa due to how great the quinoa was in this recipe.

This is really tasty.  I made it with chicken stock instead of the vegetable broth since that is what I had on-hand.  Also cooked the onions with the quinoa as suggested by another reviewer.  The only criticism I had was that it felt a touch under-spiced, like it needed a few more herbs, more garlic, or a touch of curry powder or something to add a bit more flavor.  Still, really good dish that I'm going to make again and see about tweaking.

I absolutely love this recipe. I also sauteed the onion and garlic. I put in basil as I had no parsley on hand, it was very good. I make enough to have leftovers as I like it cold as a salad. I stuff avocado with and it makes a very healthy and tasty lunch.

The onions are much too powerful in this dish. My advice is do not make with raw onions, cook them first. Braggs Amino's saved it.

This was my first time trying quinoa.  I've heard the flavor of quinoa described as "nutty."  I think it has kind of a funky, bitter aftertaste.  I used chicken stock instead of vegetable broth, and dried parsley and thyme.  After tasting it with the lemon juice, I decided to add some crushed tomatoes to mask the flavor.  Much better.

I gave this only 4 stars because I don't care for the veg broth. I made this with the veg broth and that was all I could taste. I think it would be really good with another broth. I am hoping to try it again soon! Thanks for the recipe!

Love this!! So easy - and I grabbed as a way to use some herbs from the garden but I get rave reviews. Sometimes I mix in sauteed mushrooms and eat as a vegetarian main dish.

This was perfect and the lemon was great, also added a dash of white wine.  Served with salmon one night and chicken another.  This is a very versitile side dish and healthier than rice or mashed potatoes.  Thanks!

I agree with everyone.  This is a simple, tasty, and healthy alternative to couscous/pasta/risotto.    The only change I made was to add the quinoa, then onion, then garlic to allow each to toast a bit before adding the broth.

This recipe was so easy.  The only thing I did differently, was to add the minced onion to the quinoa and broth as it simmered.  Also, I used vegetable boullion cubes with two cups of boiling water for the broth and brought it back to a simmer.  At the end I added a little parmesean reggiano.  Absolutely excellent, almost like a risotto.

This is good, but it's not very memorable.  I like quinoa because of the interesting texture, but I don't think this will be my go-to quinoa recipe.  I sauteed the onion and garlic in the butter before toasting the quinoa and I used dried thyme instead of fresh.

I was not a fan of the quinoa. If you like it then this recipe would be good. It was my first and last time ever making quinoa. I just couldn't get past the texture. OTherwise the spices called for make it a good dish.

I was afraid to try quinoa...it looks like bird seed!  However this recipe is fantastic and full of flavor and I have made it several times in the last couple of weeks.

i sauteed the onion and garlic ahead of time as suggested which probably improved the flavour of this dish, but unfortunately i still found it to be quite bland.

Really, really, delicious. I've tried making quinoa a few times in the past, but no other method I've tried has made me come back for more, and more. If you are interested in incorporating this super-food into your diet, this is a must-try recipe.

The best quinoa dish I've had - I just made it and I can't stop eating it!  The only change I made was to use chicken broth, as I didn't have vegetable broth on hand at the moment.  I also REALLY liked the lemon juice it it - it rounded out the flavor of the onions beautifully.  Will definitely make again!

I'm not feeling it.  Bought a huge bag (3 lb!) of pre-washed organic quinoa at Costco as I thought it might be a nice addition to my daughter's gluten free diet.  As recommended by many, I sauteed the onion and garlic, then added the toasted quinoa to cook, prior to adding the other ingredients as instructed.  This was not a big hit in our home.  I'm not sure thyme is the best herb for this dish, or maybe it is just that we don't like quinoa (a textural thing).  I'm not one to give up easily, so I am now on the search for some other recipes.

Excellent side dish.  I didn't have the thime, but thoroughly enjoyed it anyway.  I switched chicken broth for the vegatable broth and sauted the onion and garlic before browning the quinoa.  Will make again.

Yummy! I came across this recipe yesterday and had it today with asparagus and salmon...wonderful! My husband liked it after the first couple forkfulls and said we should incorporate it into our diet more. I did like other reviews suggested and sauteed the onion and garlic first.

You can buy pre-rinsed quinoa.  Quinoa is great.  I would make some substitutions and deletions such as skip the butter and use chicken stock instead of vegetable to make it healthier.  But good nonetheless.

I love how this dish is so simple and delicious, and also how it can be modified in so many ways to suit individuals tastes and what's available in the pantry ;)    I've used it as a side-dish and also for lunch.  It was awesome!

This recipe rocks. Using broth to cook the Quiona makes all the difference. I always use vegetable broth to make it vegetarian but no one, not even my meat eating husband complains. I make this almost every week!

I'm new at cooking Quinoa and after reading reviews I made a few changes.I toasted the quinoa without the butter till brown and starting to pop.Then added sauteed onions and garlic.I used chicken broth ,salt,pepper,  parsley and lemon. I think it would be great with shrimp and soy sauce,It has the taste of shrimp fried rice.

Good way to use the quinoa. I added the onions, garlic and herbs along with some mixed veggies and raw shrimp about ten minutes before the cooking time was done. You could do so many variations of this basic dish. Thanks!

It was good, but not as good as the quinoa and black beans. I used chicken broth and put in onions and garlic, it felt like it just needed something more...wasn't sure what to put in it since I'm pretty new to cooking with Quinoa.

Super easy, yet very good! It's very important to rinse the quinoa before using it. Otherwise, the dish will taste bitter.

This is an excellent introduction to Quinoa.  You couldn't beat it's nutritional value and it's a great change to the typical potato or rice sidedish.  However, one huge change it calls for - LOW SODIUM chicken broth.  I used regular and it was entirely too salty.  Other than that, it was awesome!

This was fantastic. I used organic quinoa, coconut oil instead of butter and cilantro instead of parsley. I probably added more salt than the recipe called for, but I did it by taste, so I'm not sure. I also squeezed 1/4 of a lemon into the quinoa about 5 minutes before it was done cooking. Overall, this was fantastic, simple and really easy to make with ingredients I always have on hand.

Great!  I made some modification though.  Instead of butter, I used 1 tbl of olive oil and sauteed the garlic and onion until they just started to get soft.  Then I added a small can of sliced drained mushrooms, quickly sauteed those and then added the quinoa.  I cooked it in a beef broth instead of the chicken to complement the mushrooms.  After it was done, the last thing I added was the parsley.  Fantastic dish!

Wow! I've always liked quinoa for the health benefits, but thought the taste was strong and slightly bitter. But the broth (I used chicken stock) and the herbs seemed to mellow it. We'll be having a lot more quinoa!

This was quite tasty. I served to Mom and Dad for a lunch side dish and it was all eaten. I really liked the flavor.

Very yummy!  I love quinoa, it's a very nice alternative to potatos/rice.  This is nice served cold.

This is my first taste of Quinoa.  I was looking for something that could be a side dish as well as a breakfast treat.  I used a low fat/low sodium free range chicken broth and minimal herbs and flavors.  That way I can add some scrambled egg beaters or honey in the am and bis of veggies for a side.  Rockin!

I used organic chicken stock because it was all I had on hand, and I halved the recipe because I only had a little left.  Unfortunately I didn't have any garlic or fresh herbs.  Next time, I would add a little more liquid, let it simmer longer, and brown the garlic and onion first.  I will definitely make this recipe again because it has a lot of flavor and is very healthy.

Very easy and healthy!  I used chicken stock and cooked the quinoa in my rice cooker with the onions and garlic.  You could really taste and smell the thyme as soon as it was added to the quinoa, so be sure to use fresh.

Very good recipe.  This was my first time trying quinoa and I was pleasantly surprised.  It has a very interesting texture which I really enjoyed and it also smells a bit like peanut butter. I substituted chicken broth for the vegetable broth and sauted the onion and garlic before adding it to the quinoa.  I'll be making this again.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This was a tasty recipe. I browned the onion and garlic with the quinoa as recommended by others, and I added mushrooms. My husband would still prefer rice to quinoa, but I loved it!

Great recipe! I added in an entire zucchini, pureed-  it added some nice moisture and colour! Also, next time I would add in the garlic a littler earlier because the flavour was very strong. Tasty!!! Thanks for the recipe :)

Loved it! I doubled the recipe. I was out of garlic and broth, so I added 1 Tbs. pesto and 2 tsp. chicken seasoning for flavor. Also used added finely chopped celery and carrot with other vegetables. Stirred in a little parmesan.

I liked this recipe a lot and will probably make it again.  It's flavorful but light, and easy to make.
