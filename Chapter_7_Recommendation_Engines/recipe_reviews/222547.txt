I used a good local beer in this cocktail, Appalachian Ginger Beer. One of the best goshdarn cocktails I've had in a LONG time. This might just be my new favorite drinks.

I use Goslings Rum, then I squeeze some fresh lime over the rum and ice.. I add the ginger beer , shake and stir serve over fresh ice...and one more squeeze of lime...but the real way to make it look "dark n stormy " is to pour the ginger beer over the ice then pour the rum it creates a dark cloud .... It looks cool but the first sip is all rum ..

Please take the advice about using Gosling's Black Seal Rum and Gosling's Ginger Beer. This is a great drink with the proper ingredients. It is one of my favorites.

This recipe deserves a 5 star rating if you use Gosling's Black Seal Rum (80 proof). I was introduced to this delicious cocktail many years ago when I vacationed in Bermuda and it is my favorite adult beverage.

This drink starts out with a wallop, then grows on you!  It's delicious --as my friend Ann said, "a good sipping cocktail."  And such an attractive drink, too!

I used Myers dark rum (arguably the best) and Bundaberg ginger beer (you can get it at World Market). Not bad. Moscow Mule is better. I can find better uses for ginger beer and rum.

Traditional with Goslingâ€™s ginger beer and dark rum poured on top.  Do experiment with other ginger beers.

I loved this, quick and easy. We had spiced dark rum on hand so that is what I used.  Have made it several times.

An excellent simple cocktail with a good bite! Add lime juice to suit. First had this in Bermuda, with Gosling Black Seal Rum. This is the original and best rum for the purpose, hands down. The local ginger beer is from Natrona Bottling Co., and is the best I know of in the area. Difficult to get, however.

My very favorite mixed drink of all time.  Always brings back memories of my vacations years ago in Bermuda.  I remember sitting on the deck at Glen Coe watching the wind surfers clutching at their sails as I sipped quietly in the sun.  I agree with other reviewers who suggest using Goslings Black Seal rum.  It is the best!

If you play around with different rums, preferably dark or spiced, there's a special taste that develops between the ginger beer and the nice(r) rums (try Zaya or Old Monk, my favorites!)
