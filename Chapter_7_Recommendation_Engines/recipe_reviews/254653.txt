The only change I made was using saskatoons instead of blueberries and I made 18 out of this recipe.  That being said, I should have made 24 out of this recipe.  Even make 6 more than the recipe called for, it tasted like there was too much dough and not enough fruit.  It was a good dough, but not really flavorful enough to carry  this.  Blueberries are a relatively bland fruit, as fruits go,  (saskatoons are very similar to blueberries), and with the bland batter and mild fruit, it just lacked flavor.  I might try it again, but will definitely have to doctor it up a fair bit for my taste.
