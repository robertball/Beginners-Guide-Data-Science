Ya know what bugs me? So many people down rate a recipe and post all of the alterations they made and don't even try the recipe as written and the recipe it's self gets a lower grade than it deserves! I made this recipe just as written and it was absolutely wonderful!! Delicious, perfectly balanced flavors and perhaps the idea of baking the chicken is to reduce the fat from pan cooking in oils. The idea of cooking the pasta in the chicken broth with the seasons and lemon juice is brilliant because it really holds in the flavor! Wonderful, We love it!! Not to be petty, but it's really rediculous how so many discredit a recipe they don't even truly try because they make all of the changes, they're only rating their own recipes. Kudos for sharing this recipe, it's great!! Five stars from my family.

This was incredibly simple and very tasty. The only thing that I did differently was instead of baking the chicken. I cubed it and seasoned it with lemon juice, garlic powder, and pepper in a bowl. Then saut√©ed the chicken in a little bit of oil. It was much quicker than baking it. After the pasta was ready, I made sure that not ALL of the broth had cooked into the pasta. The little bit of broth mixed nicely into the cream when I added it to the pasta. I made sure to let the pasta mix with the chicken a little while before adding the cream. I didn't want to add the cream when the pasta was too hot for fear of curdling. Otherwise this was a fantastic meal. 

My boyfriend believes he could eat it EVERYDAY. I have to agree with him. It will be on the menu at least every week.

this was a great inspiration dish. i made some changes to it. First, i cubed 3 b/s chicken breasts and put them in a bowl and i poured about 1/4 cup of lemon juice over it, about a spoonful of minced garlic, 1 tablespoon of lime juice, and about 1 tablespoon of lemon-pepper seasoning and i browned it in a skillet over med heat. After I finished the chicken, i transferred it to a bowl. In the same skillet, i cooked chopped mushrooms & red bell pepper in it. then put the chicken back in w/ the vegs. I followed directions for the pasta, I used multi colored spiral pasta. After the pasta was done, i threw it in w/ the chicken mixture and poured about 1/2 to 1 cup of the broth in and added 1/3 cup of milk & 1 tablespoon of butter (in subitute for the cream). It was DELICIOUS! Next time, I'll use cream to make it more "creamy" but this dish was very light and delicious. the lemony taste was subtle but strong enough. I love it. It's a keeper!

This recipe could be made so much simpler.  It was a strange way to cook pasta with broth, lemon juice, and spices.  I sauted the chicken and added fresh broccoli, artichoke hearts, and sundried tomatoes.  It made it taste yummy.  I think it would have been boring with just chicken and pasta.

I have been making this dish for a few months now and it has become one of my family's favorites!  The only things differently that I do is that the pasta is done in about 10-12 minutes and I do add some broccoli in at the end of cooking.  Also, to simplify even more, I use a package of Tyson's fully cooked diced chicken breast (sautee, heat, and pour it into the pasta).  This is such a quick, easy, and absolutely delicious meal!

Very yummy, though I changed the cooking method a bit. I made a roux with butter and flour, and and made this into a thick sauce. Instead of seasoning the breasts, I just put all the ingredients into the sauce. I also added some white wine and a little lemon pepper. Oh ya, I cut the chicken broth down to only 1 can as I wanted a really creamy sauce. I then put the whole, uncooked chicken breasts into a casserole dish, and I poured the sauce over them. I cooked them at 350 for about 25 mins, and then served it over seasoned linguini. We had Steamed Zucchini (from this site) and Garlic Bread Fantastique (also from this site) with it, and it went perfectly. Very tasty, will make again. Thanx alot for this great recipe!!!

This is absolutely amazing.....I didnt have rotelle pasta so I used angel hair pasta. Instead of baking the chicken, I tossed it in flour and fried it in a little olive oil and butter. My family loved it and will make this again soon!

This was okay.  It wasn't exactly what I expected, but we altered it a bit and would try it again.  Like everyone else, we didn't bake the chicken, but just did it on the stovetop with some olive oil.  We also added a bit of chopped onion and fresh garlic instead of powder.  We only cooked the pasta for about 10 minutes and made sure to leave a bit of broth in the pan to mix with the cream.  We also lightly sauteed mushrooms and asparagus spears and added those at the end.  Served with a salad, this is good, but required some alteration.

This was a great recipe that tasted both fresh and very satisfying; my husband agreed.  I did not have heavy cream but used half & half instead and we found it to be heavy enough without being too rich.  This is perfect meal to go alongside a salad!

This is absolutely amazing, easy to make and on the rare occasion there are leftovers, they're gone by the next day!!!!  I use a little extra lemon zest to kick up the lemony flavor.

I basically used this recipe as an inspiration and made some changes to suit my purpose and taste.  I don't really think I would have loved it as written.  I used fresh minced garlic in place of the garlic powder and added about a cup of white wine to deglaze the pan after the shallot and garlic cooked.  I let the wine reduce till almost gone and then added about a two cups of chicken stock.  I then added about 4-6 tablespoons of fresh lemon juice and 1 tsp of lemon zest.  Let that reduce to about half and added about 1-1 1/2 cup of heavy cream (I didn't measure, just a guesstimate).  Once it was thickened a bit I mixed it with the cooked pasta.  I then added about a cup of reserved pasta water to thin it out a bit.  I also made sauteed scallops and shrimp instead of chicken.  Topped with chopped fresh parsley and parm.  Yummy!!

One of my co-workers brought in lemons to the office today.  So when you‚Äôve got lemons don‚Äôt make lemonade, make this dish!  I prepared it as written and it‚Äôs quite delicious!  Honestly, with the bright lemon flavor of this dish, I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd change a thing.  I know I will be making this one again and often, thanks so much for sharing it with us.

Update: I've now made this four times, once while camping with friends, instead of fresh lemons I used lemon juice and it still got rave reviews!  To say I have an addiction to this dish is putting it mildly! LOL!

Definitely lemony and creamy, and this was super easy to make, especially since I had baked a whole chicken the night before and just chopped some up to throw in. It was really very bland, to me, upon first taste. I added some dried basil and oregano, then some salt (I used reduced sodium chicken broth) and more black pepper. Still needed something, so I added a bit of cayenne. Not a total waste, because after my alterations I liked it better, but I won't make this again. Although, the pasta step was really interesting! It made the rotelle really soft, and some of it stuck to the bottom of the pan, but this was a new way of preparing pasta, for me. 3 stars as written, 4 with my alterations. It DID satisfy my urge to cook, which is great!

I agree with Rachel Dobbs, it bugs me that people give a recipe a low rating when they didn't even cook the recipe!!!! I cooked this dish exactly as written. Did I add some fresh chopped garlic? Yes....Did I add some oregano and Basil? Yes.....BUT, I did not change the recipe and it was a darn good dish!!! What also bugs me is, people claim to be cooks and have a lot of experience in it but, thinks its strange and don't understand why you cook pasta in Chicken Broth??????? I have worked in some of the top restaurants and that is one of the many secrets that give dishes such awesome flavor!!!! Would you really want a pasta boiled in salted water or pasta boiled in Chicken Broth water???? I know which one I would like!!! And yes, I baked the Chicken as was instructed and that was the juiciest and tender Chicken!! Yes, sauteing it up with some olive oil and garlic would have been quicker and tasty BUT, it wouldn't have been near as tender and juicy as baking it! Thank you very much Lisa for this recipe!

Good weeknight recipe. Basic ingredients & quick. I used the Foreman grill vs. baking the chicken. Added sundried tomatoes & artichoke hearts, which were good but not necessary. Peas could also work.

Inspirational recipe!  I wasn't able to follow the exact recipe as written.  My substitutions, leftover chicken strips, bottled lemon juice and chicken soup base.  But, trust me, the spirit of this recipe was here!  This recipe will now be on regular rotation in my home, as written or with alterations.  Fantastic!  Thank you for the recipe.  :)

I thought this was very tasty. I liked the cooking method for the chicken in the oven, my chicken turned out perfect! Instead of heavy cream, I just added about 3 ounces of reduced fat cream cheese to the noodles (once you turn the heat down, stir stir stir, and the cream cheese will melt right in), along with some 2% milk until I liked the consistency. I also added 2 pressed cloves of garlic after the noodles finished cooking. This dish certainly begs for your personalization... in my case, it was the addition of parmesan! I think artichoke hearts would also be very good. :) We will certainly make this one again.

My family loved this recipe.  But baking the chicken posed a texture problem, the chicken was to "creamy."  To fix that, we marinated the chicken in lemon juice for one hour, then grilled the chicken.  Very good!

I thought this was delicious, but you REALLY have to be in the mood for lemon.  My husband wasn't a big fan of the strong lemon taste.  I would make this again, but I would leave out most of the lemon juice and just squeeze it over the chicken.  I don't think it would be bland because the chicken is seasoned really nicely.  I added sliced mushrooms for a veggie.  Thanks for the recipe!
UPDATE: After a few tweaks, this is now my husband's favorite recipe!  I leave out all of the lemon except squeezing some on the chicken, and I add quartered mushrooms and a cube of frozen spinach.  This is a great way to get in some veggies without having conflicting tastes.

This is a decent pasta dish. As some other reviewers suggested, it is a little bit bland, but I enjoyed the subtle lemon flavor, which helped cut the heaviness of the cream, and I enjoyed the bite of the pepper in the sauce. I doubled the sauce ingredients because I wanted to cook a whole-pound box of pasta (I wanted leftovers for later in the week).

Helpful hints: I had free time on the weekend, so I baked the chicken ahead of time. Saved me so much time when I finally made the pasta dish during the week after work! 

I did not cook the pasta until all the broth had evaporated; "normal" pasta cooking time was more than enough, especially since the pasta continues to cook in the cream sauce later. 

When I drained the pasta, I reserved the chicken broth. This came in handy later when I wanted to thicken the sauce--I added a bit of cornstarch to some of the broth, then added the mixture to the sauce. I also added about 1/2 cup grated parmesan cheese. This made a thicker sauce that coated the pasta much better than only the cream had. 

Next time I make this, I will add some fresh diced tomatoes at the very end, both for flavor and for color. This meal is kind of "beige." Overall, though, quite tasty and could be a great side dish with a few tweaks.

This was so good!  Who knew pasta with a cream sauce could taste so light and fresh!  The lemon flavor was very prominent and tasted delicious.  I used reduced sodium chicken broth instead of regular.  When it was all cooked, I tasted it and it seemed like it needed something so I topped it with a sprinkle of parmesean cheese and that really put the finishing touch on.

Amazing!!! This was so good and very simple to make. I used thin spaghetti for the noodles (it's all that I had) and used half and half for the heavy cream to save on some calories. Still came out amazing. I added some mushrooms that needed to be used up (sauteed them with some garlic), and also a splash of white wine. This is incredible, thanks for the recipe!

This is so flavorful, you would never know it is so easy to make. Reheating leftovers (if you have any!) is tastier if you add a little more cream for moisture.

This is AWESOME.  I grilled the chicken instead of baking it, and accidentally cooked the pasta at high heat so all of the liquid didn't absorb (I drained it), but it still tasted great.  Will definitely make this one again!!!

This was very good and easy to make.  The only modification I made was, I used 1 Cup of fat-free half & half, instead of the heavy cream.  I use fat-free half & half in place of heavy cream for all my recipes, and it works jsut the same, but without all the calories.

my hubby raved over this but i thought it was just so-so.  i think i will add more garlic if i make it again.  i also think it would be better with angel hair than with a shaped pasta but that may just be personal preference.

This was so flavorful!  To suit my taste and use what I had on hand, I didn't use garlic but added some chopped onion and red pepper.  I subsitituted the cream for fat free half and half to keep the fat and calorie count down and since I had fresh basil, I chopped a few tablespoons of that and added it after plating.  I also added a little bit of parm cheese.  Thsi is one dish I'll serve over and over again.

This was very tasty. Like other reviewers, I opted not to bake the chicken. I dredged pieces of chicken in flour and then sauteed them in a little bit of oil to get them nice and brown. I also added a bell pepper and some onion. I'll definitely make this again! My husband and my mom loved it!

great recipe. Made a couple of changes though. Substituted the cream with one tablespoon of salted butter. I had sauted the chicken in veg. oil with other veggies. Made the pasta in mushroom soup & added the chicken to the mixture. Before serving, I added the butter+ milk & mixed well so that it doesn't become too lumpy.

This was a really nice change. The flavors really came together in this dish. My family gobbled this up with no problem. I did add a little more lemon (personal preference)but other than that, nothing else changed. It's one of my favs. Thank you.

This doesn't need to be baked in the oven. I made this using Boneless skinlees thighs. I cooked it in a skillet and followed the rest of the recipe as closely as possible. It's quite good. I will make it again soon.

This recipe is perfect the way it's written.  There's no need to make any modifications.  The only thing that "could" be changed without compromising the recipe is leaving out the chicken and just having the pasta.  A great recipe, well worth the prep time!

I know it's cliche, but if I could give this 10 stars, I'd give it 20! Absolutely divine! Only 2 things I changed because I had to was I used a chicken soup base added to water instead of chicken broth as I was all out of canned broth. I also added broccoli at the end. Just perfect! I've made it 3 times at my husband's request! Perfect recipe. Loved it!

I made this exactly as written.  It's very good, very creamy and lemony (hence the name).  The whole family loved it.  And, in my opinion, the only thing it needed was salt.  Next time I make it, I will probably reduce the lemon juice a tad... but that's just a matter of each persons taste.  
Good stuff.

Excellent recipe! Simple yet very flavorful. I used fresh garlic as I grew my own last year and have a lot on hand. Other than that, I followed the recipe to the t. My husband can be a bit of a picky eater and he LOVED this. Definitely a keeper that we will prepare often. Thanks so much for sharing!

The flavor on this is great. I rarely cook with cream, so the sauce is a real treat. I do find the texture of the pasta a bit offputting- I actually prefer my noodles on the softer side, but this is so soft I had to stir it with a silicone spatula. It's also very white (to be expected, since it is a cream sauce), so I tossed some roasted broccoli in for color.

OMG! I am usually one to take a recipe and make changes to my liking but, reading the comment about keeping the recipe as is...I decided to stray from the norm and actually follow the instructions. This is an AWESOME recipe. I was not convinced that the flavor would be enough but, I was completely wrong. So good. Lighter than thought...even with the cream. The only thing I had to do differently was add more stock as I was cooking because I only had penne pasta and it needed more moisture. Thank you! I will make this again...and again.

I love this recipe. It's simple to make (my boyfriend, who is not an experienced cook, can make this perfectly!) and so delicious. The acidic quality is not too overwhelming, and the lemon and cream mix perfectly! The only thing I did different was use a bit more broth to cook the noodles in. Thanks for sharing!

We really enjoyed this! It has a fresh lemon taste without too much cream. Made it as written for the most part.   Didn't have heavy cream so used 3/4 C milk and 1/4 C butter (will work on decreasing this when I make it again). Used just over 1/8 C lemon juice in pasta (glad I did, afraid that 1/4 C would have been too much). Used 2 frozen chicken breasts that I cooked in a pan with a drizzle of olive oil and the ingredients in the recipe instead of baking.  I used Ancient Harvest gluten free Quinua pasta. It was great! It didn't take the full time for the water to be soaked in. After stirring in the chicken, the pasta started to break apart, but it wasn't mushy at all.   My husband even said he would eat this again (which says a lot!!!) Thanks so much!

I omitted the red bell peppers and added mushrooms and zucchini. I also cooked the chicken on the stove top. This recipe was amazing! My new favorite dish. May I suggest eating this dish with some homemade pesto bread. Really a divine meal! Thank you for this great recipe.

Very good! Has a nice lemoney flavor!  The only changes I made were: - Marinade cubed chicken in lime juice, and lemon and pepper spice. Then cook it on the stove with a little olive oil, baking takes too long and you don't sacrifice flavor at all. - If you follow the recipe, and wait for the pasta to soak up the rest of the broth, you'll end up with mushy pasta. I cooked the pasta no different than usual instead of the water it was the broth/lemon juice infusion.  - Added broccoli to the pasta at the very end.When the pasta is ready I strained the pasta with a strainer, and under the strainer I put a bowl to collect the soup.  - After straining, I returned the pasta to the pot, added the cooked chicken, and then added 1 cup of the soup. Then mixed the cup of heavy cream thoroughly through the pot.  It was creamy and a perfect consistency and stayed true to the basic flavors of the original recipe. I used limes, because that's all I had, but I actually think it tasted better than using lemons! And it wasn't too strong.  It may look odd when it is cooking, but the flavor is so unique and unlike any pasta you've had!! So don't be discouraged by the cooking method!

Great recipe but I did change it quite a bit.  I used Gnocchi in place of the rotelle, also added baby bella mushrooms, peppers. fresh basil and onions.  The basic ingredients were the same, I just needed more vegetables.

This recipe was very simple to make, however it did not suit our taste buds. It lacked flavor and tasted mostly of cream.  My husbands rating is 0 stars - he totally did not like it at all. If I had cooked my noodles until the liquid absorbed they would have been mush.  I did end up adding additional vegies to help with flavor to no avail. I do appreciate the ease of this recipe but think it would need way too much tweaking to make it appealing to us.  I won't be making this again.

I thought this was absolutely wonderful ... I used lime instead of lemon (boyfriend doesn't like lemon), and did half cream/half skim milk, but it was absolutely divine! I didn't do the chicken in the oven, tho' ... I sauteed it in a large pan with the juice and other ingredients, took it out, deglazed the pan with some of the broth, then added the rest of the broth and all that ... it was great ... thanks!

delicious! I did the roux base like another "rater" with melting a stick of butter and stirring in a half cup of flour. When it thickened completely I added the chicken stock and seasoned with the garlic, salt, lemon juice and lemon pepper. whisked in the cream at the end and it thickened nicely without curdling. I even added a bit of spinach. poured it over the pasta and cooked chicken. yum!!

Excellent recipe!  It was far too hot to turn on the oven, so I sauteed the chicken instead of baking it.  The only other changes I made were to sprinkle a teeny bit of salt on the chicken while it was sauteeing and I used spaghetti instead of bowtie pasta because that's what I had on hand.  Thanks for a yummy, simple recipe!  I'll definitely make this again and again.

This is fabulous! I used shredded, cooked chicken that I had leftover. I also added sauteed mushrooms and asparagus tips. With the bright lemon flavor it tasted just like Spring! We will have this one again.

Good recipe. I followed the recipe, except didn't include the lemon zest. I thought it might be too lemony. I also threw some parmesan cheese on top before serving. The lemon gave a good, but not overpowering flavor. All of the family enjoyed (even my picky 3 yr. old asked for seconds). Now that deserves 5 stars in my house!

i was originally going to follow jamies suggestions of completely changing the recipe to try it out but then i read another review saying that it was perfect as is so i left it alone.. and boy am i glad i did.  the ONLY thing i changed was i added a little bit of lemon pepper seasoning to my chicken before i baked it and a little lemon pepper in the broth and on top and some parmesan cheese sprinkled on top.  this dish is so freaking good.  i dont know why it doesnt have a 4.5 rating at least.  will definitely be making this in the future.. it'll give me something different to do with my chicken breast other than alfreado all the time.  yum yum!

I would give this dish 5 stars if I didn't think that it had WAY too much lemon. I love lemon, but it was just far too strong here. I followed this recipe exactly as it called for, but I think next time that I will severely cut down on cooking the chicken in it, only put a few tablespoons into the broth, and use 1/2 tsp, maybe even a 1/4, of zest to top it off. And I never could find any rotelle pasta anywhere, so I just used thin spaghetti. That worked fine. Otherwise, everything was fantastic!

Refreshing twist! Liked that the sauce was not too heavy. We added portobello mushrooms and spinach. Was expecting more of a lemony punch but the lemon flavor was very subtle. Also, needed more seasoning. I did like it for a nice switch!

Leave the recipe as is. All these people talk about how they changed this and that but didn't even try it the original way so they have no idea how good the original recipe is. And adjusting spices is just for everyone's different taste buds. Doesn't make or break anything. Thanks for a great recipe.

Prepared it exactly as written and this dish was amazing! I've got a lot of picky people over here, but EVERYONE ate it!! Only substitution was that I used mafalda noodles (ribbon shaped) instead of rotelle.

I didn't much care for this recipe. It was edible, but the flavor did nothing for me. The only change I made was to swap shrimp for the chicken. With that I didn't bake it I just pan fried it quickly. I probably won't make this again as written. I feel there are so many other things I could do to make this better and that would just be a new recipe. Examples would be to omit the cream and replace with wine. Use fresh garlic in place of powdered. I would add mushrooms, tomatoes and scallions...

This was an awesome recipe.  My family loved it.  The only changes I made were to add half and half rather then heavy cream.  I also added a little fresh chopped dill.  I will definitely make this dish over and over again!

I made the recipe exactly as written.  Overall it was tasty and I liked the intense lemon flavor.  However, it found it to be way to greasy.  I will make again, but will next time try using evaporated milk instead of cream.

Taste was very good, but all of my liquid did not absorb.  Needed more pasta or less liquid. I drained the remaining liquid as my pasta was getting way overdone!!  Next time will add some sauteed red pepper ? for color?

I'll be making this again for sure. I made it as written only with the addition of pecorino romano cheese at the end. However, I do have to say that 2 cans of chicken stock was too much and the idea that pasta takes 25 minutes to cook is incorrect. When I make it again, I'll use one can of stock and maybe a little water as needed. I also thought the cream use was excessive. Maybe 2 ozs (1/4 cup) is all you need with the chicken stock that's already in the recipe. 1 cup of cream adds 88 grams of fat to an otherwise healthy dish.

This recipe is great. I did cut the lemon in half and I used just lemon juice outta a bottle. I make the noodles in this recipe for other things, without the cream. It's a flavorful way to make them and never fails. Thanks for sharing!

Absolutely five stars.  This was just the right amount of lemon. My husband and I loved this and I will definitely make it again.  The ONLY thing I did a bit different is I also seasoned the chicken with Lemon Pepper because it is my favorite spice.

This was pretty easy to make.  My husband loved it, I thought it was a bit bland, and my kids only liked the chicken part.  Maybe capers would taste good in it.

This was a delicious dish. I followed the other raters advice and omitted the lemon zest.   We all felt the amount of lemon in the dish was just right.  This is a perfect casserole meal for a cold winter evening.

This was simple to make, and fairly good to eat.  My toddler gobbled it up.  However, I thought it was a bit too lemony - if I make it again I will either omit or lessen the lemon juice when boiling the pasta, or I will omit the lemon zest and give it a try.  The chicken had great flavor, so I think the lemon on the chicken is a must while baking, it came out moist and perfect.

Delicious!  I was a little hesitant about the cup of cream (I can hear my arteries hardening LOL) but it really made the sauce.  Loved the fresh lemon flavor.  I used farfalle instead of rotelle (personal preference).  I could have actually skipped the chicken and just had the pasta and sauce.  Can't wait to enjoy the leftovers tomorrow.  Yum!

This is delicious!!! If you like lemon you will love this!! The only thing I would recommend is doubling the ingredients.  Oh, and I cut grape tomatoes is half for a bit of color.

This is a super versatile and yummy pasta dish. I cooked the chicken in the broth and then removed it to complete the recipe, adding it back in(cut into pieces) at the end. Cooking the pasta in the broth worked very well and made for easy clean up. My family loved this meal!

This was great!  This made a nice, light, and refreshing meal!  I served on the side some homemade honey wheat bread and it complimented it well.  I did make a couple additions.  I seasoned the chicken breasts very well and seared them in the saute pan first.  I then drizzled them with the lemon and finished them off in the oven.  I sauteed some onions and garlic before making the sauce, scraping up all the "yummies" the chicken and onions left behind.  I also added in some fresh broccoli.  The lemon flavor was very light and made the dish!  I used fat free half & half in this to lighten it up and make a nice healthy dinner.  Sprinkled with parm. cheese on top and some extra lemon slices on the side for squeezing and it turned out to be a delicious meal!  Thanks so much for the recipe!  I will be making many more times!

Excellent gourmet weeknight meal!  To save time, I cooked the breasts whole in a sautee pan with oil and butter, then removed the breasts and added the broth, lemon juice and pasta to the same pan.  I LOVED cooking the pasta in the broth, it really added to the flavor of the dish!  I also added chopped tomatoes which were delicious.  This is such a versatile recipe, and is a definite "keeper"!

OH. MY. GOODNESS.  This is AMAZING!  I followed everything to a perfect T on the recipe (because of a reviewer's post) and I am SOOO glad I listened to that advice!  The chicken baked in the oven was so moist that I will be using that method to bake chicken from now on!  The method to cook pasta was AWESOME too!  I had a little doubt about this recipe but thought I would give it a fair chance!  I was FULL before I sat down to eat dinner because I kept "taste testing it" while cooking it!  SO good!

Made as directed, pasta was complete mush, sauce did not thicken and was extremely bland even after later adding more pepper and garlic powder.  Kids liked it. Husband tolerated it. I like the idea, but need a different recipe.

Made exactly as written and it was extremely bland.  Nice creaminess, but just...blahh.  The leftovers were a little better tasting than the first day, when the pasta had absorbed all the sauce.

This is an excellent recipe!  I followed it exactly, but used brown rice rotelle pasta and added wild mushrooms.  It was great.  My husband loved it.  We will definitely be having it again.  I think the key is cooking the pasta in the broth and lemon - really adds to the flavor.  I also didn't have any heavy cream, so I substituted it with skim milk, a small amount of butter and a tbs of flour.

I'm sorry but this recipe as written was unappealing to us. Besides the fact that there was no color in this dish, it just didn't have great flavor. After making, plating, then tasting it, my husband and I took our plates and scraped it back in the saucepan. I then added (as some reviewers suggested) broccoli, artichoke hearts and sundried tomatoes...along with a little salt. After cooking for about 5-7 minutes it was now visually appealing and tasted so much better.

I couldn't see simmering my pasta for that long since I was using tortellini which cooked in 2-3 minutes, so It was a little hard to judge this recipe; Over all the flavors were ok but the sauce was missing something;  I sprinkled crumbled bacon and parsley on it and it gave it something extra imo.

This is an EXCELLENT recipe, my dinner guests LOVED this pasta and said that it was even better than Italian restaurant pasta!  I followed the recipe exactly except I added mushrooms and broccoli and used fettucini pasta.  The lemon flavor is perfect--not too strong and not weak.  Will make this again and again.
UPDATE: I've made this with salmon and we think it's even better than with chicken!  This recipe makes me look like a gourmet cook!

Great flavor...I did make a few changes.  Just for simplicity sake..I actually cut my chicken into pieces and cooked over stove top (1 tblsp. EVOO) and then added my seasonings (took about 10 min.).  I cooked my pasta as noted below and to cut some of the fat, I used half and half vs. heavy cream.  DELICIOUS!

We found that our result was way too lemony.  I would certainly try it again, next time cutting down on the amount of lemon by quite a bit.  Perhaps our lemons are just bigger and/or juicier than those used in the original recipe?  In any case, my daughter was completely put off and asked me to never make  this recipe again.   Of course the caveat there is that young people have sensitive palates.  So, if you are feeding this to your kids, definitely watch your lemon!  If you're palate is old and worn out, juice it up!  But...taste as you go.  Apparently mine isn't as worn out as I thought!

I normally take my photos with the leftovers... but we ate this all up so fast that I didn't get a photo! My 5 year old dips everything in ranch, but ate 2 helpings of this without ANY!!! My changes: I used 1/2 cup cream and 1/2 cup milk (simply because I needed to have some cream left for my coffee in the morning) and I cubed the chicken and sauteed it rather than baking. After the chicken was cooked, I added some sugar snap peas and sauteed them quickly, then added the pasta, cream and zest. SO GOOD and so pretty w/ the green peas and yellow zest! I would serve this to company!

Wow, this was so good. Defrosted enough frozen boneless, skinless chicken tenderloins to equal amount called for in recipe. Squeezed the lemon juice over them and sprinkled with garlic powder, let sit for 1 hour then cut them up into bite sized pieces and cooked them in a little oil in the frying pan while making the pasta. This is so good I could eat it every day. You won't be sorry if you try it.

I love this recipe!  After having it a few times, here are my changes- Sautee the breast with lemon, garlic powdier, pepper and shallots.  Cooking the pasta in the broth and lemon juice is the best part of the recipe.  So tasty.

Tasty!  Easy!  And the whole family enjoyed it.  I had to improvise, not having any cream (I made a roux and it worked just fine)...and I was a teensy bit short on lemon juice and supplemented with lime juice...and I also didn't cook any chicken, I had a couple of leftover pieces which I chopped up and dumped in at the end...and I plopped a handful of frozen peas, too...  I'm looking forward to trying the real recipe--the "worked all day and didn't have time to go to the store" version was very well-received and the proper preparation can only make it even better.

I thought this recipe was delicious.  I followed another reviewer's advice by cooking the chicken on the stove to save time.  I also added some spinach at the end with the cream.  I think this dish would be good with different veggie combinations.  Will definitely make again.  I also think this will make a good leftover.

We will be making this again!!  Subbed evaporated milk for heavy cream.  Also roasted whole chicken with garlic, rosemary & lemon halves in cavity.  Used meat from chicken and some of the drippings to flavor sauce.  Did NOT need extra garlic salt.

EXCELLENT!Didn't alter this recipe one bit. Made for 40 tonight and not a bite left and received RAVE reviews! Tons of flavor and EASY. OK, did change the method of cooking the chicken...boiled the chicken breasts for some homemade broth and added spices to the water. Almost a one dish meal! Be sure to undercook the pasta a bit if you are not serving right away or becomes too soft. Delicious!

Wow! This recipe was surprisingly easy and even more surprisingly delicious. The flavors all blended nicely together and contained a ton of depth. I made it for my boyfriend and I for dinner about a half and hour ago, and he swears it is the best thing I've ever made.  I followed the recipe almost exactly to a tee, with the following changes:  I grilled the chicken instead of baking it (just because we prefer the taste)  but I kept all of the seasonings the same. The chicken on it's own was delicious enough to be devoured.   Also, I used chicken bouillon instead of broth, but that was just because we were out. I am sure it tastes even better with broth.  We also used about 1/8 cup more heavy cream, but that's because we felt it was an itty bitty bit thick.   I think everybody, beginner or expert, should try this recipe. It will not disappoint!

Pretty good recipe, will make again. Teenage daughter said "its the bomb!"  I sauteed the chicken with some onion and garlic instead of baking it.  I also added an extra can of chicken broth and about 3/4 cups more cream (actually used half& half).  I would have liked it more lemony so next time will double the lemon juice and zest.

I made a few to many revisions, but it was still great. I sauteed the chicken with a little flour on the chicken. My family likes a lot of sauce, so I increased the cream and the chicken broth.  Next time I would probably cook the pasta in water and then add it to the sauce.  I thought the sauce had a little startch taste to it, but not bad.  I increased the lemon and it was a little much.  I made a bed of spinach in a bowl and poured the recipe over it and it was great.  Next time I will not put quite as much lemon.  The family liked the creamy sauce a lot.

Holy smokes this was delish!  I used a lot of the suggestions made by Jamie, added garlic and sauteed yellow, red and green peppers along with the diced chicken instead of baking it and used 5% cream and it was really good and will definitely be at the front of my cookbook!

I made a few changes: 1. Instead of baking the chicken, I cubed it, sprinkled it with lemon-pepper seasoning, garlic powder, salt, and pepper, and then sauteed it in a little olive oil. 2. I added some peas in the end because I felt like it needed some veggies. 3. I substituted like 1/4 cup of the chicken broth with water, just because I ran out of broth. Next time, I think I would substitute even more (maybe 1/2 cup) water because the chicken broth flavor was a little too strong for me... I really liked this recipe - it was super-easy to make, and flavorful but understated. I wouldn't expect to find it at a resturant like other reviewers have said, but I think it was great for home cooking, especially considering how ridiculously simple it is to make. My boyfriend loved it (and he is very picky).

This is a yummy recipe.  I browned the chicken breasts in the skillet with a little oil, then placed in the oven to cook entirely.  I then added sliced freshed mushrooms and sauteed.  Finally, I added a chopped roma tomato and capers to the skillet with additional lemon juice.  Once the chicken was cooked, I added the chicken and the pasta and tossed.  I have tried this recipe with and without the heavy cream. It is good both ways!

This was really yummy!  Very Refreshing.  We didn't bake the chicken, instead I made a marinade (with lemon juice, a bit of lime juice, white wine, olive oil, garlic, pepper, basil,  and lemon pepper) and my husband grilled them.  We also used bowtie pasta.  Even before we added the cream the pasta was incredible!  I can't wait to try w/ out the cream and used some veggies scampi style.  YUM!!  I did try to add brocoli to it but it got over cooked.:-(  But both my husband and I agreed that it wouldn't have tasted good with the brocoli.  Thanks so much!

I made this recipe as stated, although I just eyeballed the seasoning. I did add some fresh rosemary since I wanted to use it up and added some grated parmesan on top.  It had a great flavor and is easy to make. The pasta came out excellent, never made it that way before. I think this recipe could be a good base, would be great with asparagus or other added veggies. Thanks for the recipe.

This is the second recipe from this site that I've tried and I'm not sure what everyone is raving about. We changed to egg noodles because we didn't have the rotelle pasta.
Texture aside, we couldn't taste the garlic or the chicken broth. The lemon juice was completely overpowering.
As neither of us could eat it as is, we just added some Ragu Parmesan sauce to it, but even that didn't fully mask the lemon. If you're looking for something that is reminiscent of chinese take out lemon chicken sauce/taste/awesomeness, keep on looking. :(

Simple. Flavorful. Feels healthy to eat even when you're full, because it's THAT good; you will scarf it down. Followed recipe exactly and it came out better than I even expected. Was surprised it didn't use salt but the lemon mimics the flavor and balances the dish. Used asparagus as exampled, but think most, if not all green veggies would be delicious as a side dish with this recipe. Will become a household dinner staple in a home full of picky eaters.

This is super delicious. I cubed my chicken and saut√©ed it with a little vegetable oil. I also doubled the pasta and the sauce ingredients to feed my larger family. I love lemon! I will certainly be making this again.

I loved this. It was very simple. The only thing i did was cook my chicken different. I poached my chicken instead and shredded my chicken. But it was amazing. I dont cook much and this was simple to follow.

This is definitely a recipe to stay in the cook book. It was off the charts! I didn't try it with any alterations, just as the recipe said. This is definitely a recipe to eat a crowd.

I thought this was amazing and mouth watering.  I am a lemon fanatic.  The other members of my family, however, found this to be too much lemon flavor.  If I were to make again I would reduce the lemon juice and reduce or eliminate the lemon zest.. for them... I guess.

I made this exactly as stated and thought it was awesome. Whenever I ask my husband his opinion of my new dishes and he responds "it's restaurant quality" that's a 5star rating for the dish. The only thing I would do different is add a vege into the pasta (broccoli, zucchini, maybe asparagus) to make it an even easier dish. Thanks for this recipe.

Like others, I doctor up many of the recipes I see here, but I followed this one to the letter.  I've have made it 3 or 4 times, and it is dee.lish.us!  Nothing needs to be changed.  Of course me and my sig-oth love chicken, pasta, and lemon anything, so this was an absolute winner for us.

Much easier than I expected!  Delicious.  Everyone LOVED it!  I was intimidated by the pasta in broth, but it was easy! 
Also baked chicken, cuz that was easy.  Added the asparagus, as photo, a little to late to the broth, cuz that was easy...that was ok to do right?  I was following recipe, I thought that part might have been left out.  Thanks for a great recipe! I'll be using it over and over. Loved it!
(Can't lie, I didn't have heavy cream, so I used light cream, didn't have rotelle, used elbows. Can't wait to try it with rotelle, but think I'll stick to light cream.)

This is a wonderful dish, and fairly easy to make.  So, give it a try if you're a novice in the kitchen. You just may surprise yourself!  It's delish!  I followed the recipe as written; did not make any changes.  My husband raved about it!  Next time, I will add the asparagus as shown on the photo.  And I'll remember to make some garlic bread too.  Oops!  But this is definitely a five-star recipe, and I'll be making this many more times!  It's good enough and easy enough for a weeknight meal, and it's so good, you'd be proud to
serve it if you're having folks over for dinner.  Yum! DON'T CHANGE A THING!  IT'S PERFECT THE WAY IT'S WRITTEN!  It bugs me, too, as Rachel Dobbs states in her review, as to why folks don't try the recipe as written first, then, if you want, make changes and let us know.  But only AFTER you've tried the original recipe first!

This pasta was really good.  I used rigatoni b/c I had a half box in the cupboard.  I think the next time I make this I will check on the pasta sooner and take it out before it gets too done.  Then I'd add the cream and reduce the sauce some - i had a lot of broth left over after the pasta was done and that might have to do with the type and amount of pasta I used.
I also marinated the chicken in the spices and lemon juice for about 30-45 minutes and then grilled it instead of baking it.  This gave the dish a little color, as baked chicken breasts are so white and they would have gotten lost in the white sauce.
And as another review stated, I think I'd slice the chicken and top the pasta with it instead of mixing in bite-sized chunks.  I think the presentation would be much more appetizing.
Topped with Parm - YUM!
thanks for the recipe Lisa!

I very seldom change a recipe because I like trying different dishes, that is the reason recipes are posted. This was delicious and as usual I did not change a thing.

I have to agree with one of the above posts.....it seems most change the recipe before they even try the recipe as it is!!!    I cook my pasta in broth, spices, etc...   That is where it will get it's flavor.  This recipe is fine just the way it is.... try it at least once before adding things "your way".    Very delightful dish the way it is!   - Ellen

I must admit that I was a little skeptical of all the lemon but the cream toned it down to a very nice light flavor. The only thing I added was onion powder to both the chicken and the pasta but the rest of it was left the same. Very delicious recipe and something my picky husband loves! :)

mmmm this was yummy!  I used 1 cup almond milk instead of cream, since I try to avoid dairy and want to eat healthier, and it still came out really good. I also used whole wheat rotini and it was great! I can only imagine how good it would be with the cream! I also added 1 pack of sliced mushrooms, and next time I think I will add another pack (2 packs total) and maybe some baby spinach for some color and an onion for more flavor.  I also followed someone elses suggestion and instead of baking the chicken in the oven, I cubed it and sauteed it with the lemon juice, pepper, and garlic powder.  mmmm, this was so good and I will definitely be making it again!!

Fabulous dinner...I added some fresh veggies and topped it with some fresh grated Parmesan cheese. I also used my home made broth. Thank you for this wonderful recipe.

Great, quick meal!! I did end up adding a tsp or so of corn starch to thicken the sauce.... but I think that might be personal preference. I was leary since it didn't have all the extra goodies that we usually like... peppers, broccoli, etc. but it was tasty as is! And I'm sure could be modified to include veggies for a spin-off if you have them on hand! This one will be a keeper for us!

Really I'd give this recipe 3 and a half stars. I think it was good and quick... I did make it though with the shredded canned chicken breasted which I cooked separately. I felt it needed something so I added a little celery salt and dried dill I thought that made the flavor explode...

My family LOVES this dish! I tried it the way it was written the first time and then changed it a little bit the second time. Now I cut the chicken into pieces and saute it with green onions, garlic, a little bit of olive oil and about 1/2 tsp of garlic salt and a little lemon. I also add a lot of lemon juice at the end after the noodles and chicken have been mixed because my family loves the taste of the lemon. I also usually use whatever pasta I have on hand. Its a simple recipe and we have it at least once a week.

Very tasty! Made as written other than adding fresh broccoli to the pasta and chicken broth and using half and half instead of heavy cream. We will definitely make again as it was very easy and tasty.

I made exactly as written and thought it was delicious. My even pickier husband, 3 year old and 5 year old ate it all up. I am gladly adding this to my regular recipes, but I will play with it a little to reduce the amount of heavy cream to save calories. I do admit the color is kind of bland so I will reserve this for family use but do not think it looks great enough (fancy enough?) for guests.

I loved it.  The whole family enjoys it and it's a great and easy weekday meal.  It's easy to add veggies to it, too.  We have made it with broccoli and asparagus.  Any pasta will work and I always make extra because it's always gone!

I was so excited to try this recipe - I love lemon chicken. I found this recipe to be bland. The lemon did not blend well with the other flavors in the recipe. It just felt like this recipe was lacking something (I can not put my finger on what it was).

Yummy! I made the recipe, just as laid out, but added one thing: cooked broccoli. I was making some broccoli as a side dish, and decided last 5 minutes to throw in after the cream and lemon zest. Love, love, love it! Will make again.

I use this website ALL the time, but this is the first time I've felt compelled to write a review.  I've now made this 4 or 5 times, my husband and kids love it, I am obsessed with it.  It's so good.  I stick with the the recipe given (other than using rotini pasta and don't measure my garlic or pepper) and it's a hit EVERY time.  My favorite recipe, hands down.  Thanks so much for the recipe.

This dish was amazing!  Mine turned out pretty lemony, but we liked it that way.  You might want to reduce lemon a touch if you are not looking for a lot of lemon flavor.  I did add some oregano and pan fry the diced chicken because I was on a time crunch, but it turned out just fine.  Thank you so much for such a great, unique recipe!

I thought this was a great recipe. I just added salt to the broth and 1 tbsp of capers. Then when I added the cream I just pour in a liberal amount of grated parmesan cheese. Yummy!!!

I would have rated it 5 stars, but the cooking time for the noodles is wrong (change "25 minutes" to "the amount of time directed on the noodle package").

For those who find it bland, you probably used a lower salt chicken broth.  Just add some salt, and it will spice right up.  Also, try using fresh or minced garlic instead of garlic powder.

Once you get over the fact that it is a lemon-garlic cream sauce, this is really quite good.  Some people aren't used to cream tasting sour unless it's gone bad, so you may have to tell yourself "it isn't bad" for the first few bites the first time you try it.  My boyfriend had that issue at first, and now it's his favorite sauce.

If it ends up too thin, it's probably because you used just a little too much broth or cream, or not enough noodles.  The amount of liquid in the recipe really needs to be precise to come out properly, so using a 32 oz box of broth or a 6 oz package of pasta makes a difference, but it's easily fixed.  There are lots of ways to thicken it: add a pat of butter, 1/2 cup parmesan cheese, some cornstarch (pre-mixed with a little cold water), or a flour roux.

PLEASE NOTE: I am only rating the sauce & noodles, not the chicken.  I make roasted lemon chicken, and we always have leftovers, so I now use the leftovers with the sauce/noodles in this recipe to make something a little different the next night.

This was a wonderful recipe!  I made this when my in-laws were in town and everyone raved.  The pasta had such an incredible flavor with being cooked in the chicken broth and lemon.  This had the perfect amount of lemon flavor.  It was subtle.  I added sauteed onion and diced tomatoes (drained from a can).  Other than that I made it exactly as written.  I will definitely make this again and I can't wait to eat the leftovers tomorrow!

I over cooked the chicken which was a downside but cooking the pasta in the chicken broth was a great idea and it really enhanced the flavor.  I'll definately use that tip again.  maybe a little more garlic but a keeper for sure.

I've made this recipe twice now, and it turned out delicious both times! The first time, I accidentally used garlic salt vs garlic powder (I'm a beginner...), but it still tasted great! I love this recipe and I'll definitely use it in the future, thanks!!

My husband gave this 5 stars, and my picky 3-year old loved the pasta. I found it to be a bit too salty, but I think that was because of the chicken broth I used. This dish is easy to prepare and I'll be making it more regularly.

Delicious!  I found this as I was looking for something different to cook for dinner.  At first I was a little nervous about making it, especially since I didn't have heavy cream on hand!  Instead I used 1 cup of milk, 3 tablespoons of butter and 1 tablespoon of flour to thinken it up.  Turned out pretty well, can't wait to try it with the cream :)

After reading some of the reviews I decided to alter this recipe as well.  I used all the same ingredients, minus the chicken broth and lemon zest.  Here is what I did:  cubed the chicken breast, seasoned it with seasoning salt, garlic powder and onion powder, sauteed it in oil, added fresh squeezed lemon juice after it was done and let it simmer, meanwhile the noodles were boiling (used bowtie), took meat off the burner to cool down a bit, drained pasta, mixed pasta in with the meat, added the heavy whipping cream, parsley flakes, cayenne pepper, shredded romano and parmesan cheese, and boy was this good!

not bad...we definitely thought it was bland though. i used 12oz of pasta but didnt change anything else. cheese makes a world of difference. i didnt think it was too lemony at all (like some other reviews stated), if anything i thought it could use more...anything to give it more flavor

This is wonderful! I had never cooked pasta this way so I was a bit leery but it turned out perfect. The husband said this was the best thing I ever made. The second time around I used whole wheat egg noodles (to avoid a trip to the grocery) and added some fresh baby spinach after combining all ingredients. Love this dish!

I made this exactly as the recipe called except i used 12 oz. of penne pasta - which i don't' think counts :-) Anyway, the 12 oz was barely enough to soak up the chicken broth so i would recommend using more pasta than it calls. This dish was excellent and super easy to make.

Easy and so good. Picky teenagers loved it! I substituted whole milk for the cream and it still came out yummy. (I thickened the sauce with 1 or 2 tblsp of corn starch mixed with water). Baking the chicken added to the flavor, so don't skip this step. Thanks for this unique and delicious recipe!

This was good; rather kid-friendly I think. It was a little bland for my husband, altho my kids did eat, they thought a little too lemony. I liked it, but I think it needed some vegs added, so next time will try that and adding a little salt as well.

This was fantastic. Even though I will make some changes next time, I am still giving it five stars because the flavor was so perfect. Next time I will not cook the pasta as long as I did. By 17 minutes of cooking it was already getting mushy.  That is my only complaint about the recipe. The flavors were amazing! I seasoned the chicken as suggested and then pan fried it. I added the cream to the pan to first scrape up the bits and chicken juices, then added the pasta. Wow was it delicious. Even with the noodles falling apart, it was amazing.

Wonderfully simple but beautifully blended flavors. Garlic, Lemon and Chicken with a depth of flavor only possible by cooking the noodles as recommended. Try it and you'll love it!

This was delicious!!  I added a little extra chicken broth and only 1/2 cup of the heavy cream to reduce the fat a little.  I also forget to put the lemon zest in and it was still good.  We sprinkled a little Parmesan cheese on the top.  My husband loved it so much he took if for lunch the next day.

This dish was fabulous! My husband loves lemon flavoring so I added a little more lemon juice as well as lemon pepper seasoning to the chicken (which I cut up and sauted with onions and garlic rather than baking for 40 mins - it was faster and added more flavor). I also added steamed broccoli and lemon pepper seasoning to the dish when I added the heavy cream. My husband said it was the best lemon chicken dish he's ever had! Thanks for helping me impress him!

This was fabulous! I followed this exactly, and was thoroughly impressed. Then, because i like veggies in with my pasta, i sauteed mushrooms, garlic, zuchinni, and broccolini together and threw it in with the pasta and chicken at the end. YUM! My husband said i could make this ANYTIME! :D

This was yummy! I followed the recipe exactly. For a side dish I made asparagus. I used the broth leftover from the baked chicken and just added frozen asparagus. Baked it uncovered for 10 minutes on 400. Same dish and everything!

I really thought this would be better. I love lemon with anything. This just didn't mesh with the heavy cream and broth. I may use this recipe and just omit the lemons. The only think I could taste was bitter lemons. No one in my house had more than 1 bite.

This was good. My family of 6 (4 children) liked it, so I will make it again. I used Land O Lakes Fat Free Half & Half instead of cream. We put a little parmesan on top too. Peas and/or tomatoes would be nice additions in the future.

Mmmm...delicious just the way the recipe was written.  I used what I had on hand and substituted 3/4 cup milk and 1/4 cup butter for the heavy cream (suggested as a substitute on another website).  Thanks for the great recipe, even my kids loved it.

I've made this recipe several times as written.  However, today it was a little different.    My oldest son was home from college and we ended up visiting a little too long.  So, I picked up a rotisserie chicken from the take home department of the grocery store and used that instead of baking the chicken.  It cuts the time down significantly.    I cleaned/cut up the chicken while the pasta was boiling.  Whipped it together in a little over half an hour- start to finish.  Delicious as written and great as modified!  Served with roasted asparagus and some crunchy sourdough.  Practically perfect.  Plus hubby enjoyed the dark meat addition.

I made this last night.  Everyone really liked it.   I used less lemon juice, as was suggested by other reviewers.  I also sauteed the breasts in olive oil and minced garlic because my oven was being used and this was quicker.

Let me start by saying that when I served this meal to my family, my 10 year old son said, "Mom, this looks like a fancy meal you would get at a restaurant!"  The meal tasted as good as it looked!  I did do a couple things differently.  My husband is allergic to poultry, so I used shrimp for him instead.  I seasoned the chicken and shrimp with the garlic powder and lemon pepper, then cooked them on the grill.  Also I used angel air pasta in place of rotelle.  I kept everything else the same, and the meal was a hit!

Four stars because the recipe has no color. Some mushrooms, tomatoes, peppers, artichokes, etc, make it fresher and more delicious. It was not as lemony as I expected--still lemony, but I expected an overload. Of course, you could always grate more zest.

This was pretty good (and not too lemony, as a few other reviewers mentioned).  It was missing something, though, and I can't put my finger on it.  I followed the recipe exactly.  I'll definitely make this again as soon as I figure out what flavor/seasoning is missing!

Very different and unique flavor. I followed the directions exactly how it is written, no variations needed! Turned out perfect, husband loved it and 2 year old asked for me for more! The chicken was great, I couldnt stop snacking on it before I added it to the pasta. It had great flavor.  Served with Green Beans and buttered french bread. Hit the spot, will be making this again and sharing with my friends and family. Thanks for posting this recipe!

Wow, it is very good. My only issue is that the lemon comes through almost on the heavy side. Which normally wouldn't be a problem, but my husband isn't a big fan of lemony flavors to begin with. I think the next time I'm going to be halving the lemon mixed into the pasta and seeing where that gets me.  one other thing that I did. I actually had seasoned the chicken the night before and let it marinate in the lemon juice for almost 24 hours before it was cooked. wow... Hubby and I tasted the chicken before adding it to the pasta and it was lemony and yummy enough to stand on it's own!

This pasta was very good and light tasting.  I took other reviewers advice and cut lemon juice in half.  I added a small 9-oz. box of frozen chopped broccoli and cooked it with the pasta.  Hubby loved it and asked for me to keep recipe to make again!

This is a interesting lemon pasta. The sauce is not spicy or zangy like many lemon pasta sauces. Almost like a savory sweeter sauce. I liked it, but it does have a tad too much of a lemon taste. I would reduce the lemon juice to half the amount to keep it more savory and less lemon curd tasting. After I added more garlic and salt it tasted better. However, this was pretty good and interesting to taste.

I love that this is a cheap, easy and quick recipe!! I keep most of these ingredients on hand. I used egg noodles, used lemon juice instead of real lemon and substituted heavy cream for 3/4 cup of milk and 1/4 cup of butter. I cut up the chicken and fried it with a little bit of oil. A bag of mixed veggies is great to add in or as a side.

This was one of my favorite pasta dishes.  I followed exactly EXCEPT I used frest chicken tenders; less chopping.    I squirted almost two lemons on it and put in a ziplock to marinate for an hour.  I added a drained can of artichoke hearts and baked as posted.  Follow the pasta directions exactly but I ended up adding a little more broth than called for a little less time cooking maybe 20 min.  It was really good and got rave reviews at my house.

My husband LOVED this. I sprinkled a bit of parmesan on top, and next time we decided we must have garlic bread too.

Absolutely delicious!!  Whole family loved it!  The pasta with that cream sauce is to die for!  This is a keeper and will make the pasta as a side dish also.

This was wonderful!  I added a bit of dill (one of my favs) and a hint of heat with cyanne pepper.  Also, instead of cream, I added 1/2 and 1/2 with bit of flavored cream.  I used Coffee Mate's Italian Sweet Cream, but just a bit.  All of thoes flavors are quiet potent.  Excellent rec.  Thanks.  This is a keeper!  I text'd my b friend and told him I will be making this soon!

I added 2tblspn of butter to the pasta when adding the heavy cream.  I also used wheat pasta, I think it is more important to get the pasta to the correct firmness than all of the water being absorbed.  The dish was good, I will marianate the chicken next time.

I liked it. I added shredded parmesan on top when it was served. It was a little too lemony, but I was pleased with how the flavors blended. Will keep it in my recipe box. My 3 year old ate all of it so because of that it's a keeper.

This was EXCELLENT!  My hubby loved it and said the only thing that would make this better is adding some white wine somewhere (not sure yet).  Might try incorporating some next time.  What a neat way to cook pasta!  So flavorful!  I cut the chicken breast halves into bite size pieces.  I made a marinade of the juice of 1 lemon, 2 tsp. minced garlic, and 1/4 tsp. black pepper and marinated the chicken for an hour or two.  I then cooked the chicken over medium heat until the juices run clear.  I sprinkled the chicken with Montreal Chicken seasoning and lightly browned.  I then prepared the sauce as written. I also added peas and some parmesan cheese to the cooked pasta along with the chicken.  Everything else I did the same and I THANK YOU LISA for the great recipe!!

Good recipe, though the lemon flavor is a bit overpowering.  Slightly scale back the lemon zest, or use less juice.  Nice creamy texture, and the baked chicken accents the pasta well.

At last! A recipe that can be reduced easily to feed two people! Very akin to alfredo; in fact, I could barely taste the difference. I accidentally used rigatoni pasta and used evap. milk instead of cream. As another reviewer pointed out, the noodles did stick to the pan, but that's not a huge deal for me. I will use this recipe instead of alfredo now! Thanks for posting!

Excellent!  I suggest slicing chicken in to long thin pieces rather than cubes.  I also threw in asparagus and red bell pepper with the pasta for just a few minutes.  The veggies absorb a lot of flavor and adds a nice color variety to the dish.  I've added this to my regular rotation.  Thank you so much!

This was really good!  Lemony and creamy.  

I made it last-minute when I had an unexpected extra person at dinner.  I especially like that it can be put together with things that I usually have on hand -- pasta from the pantry and frozen chicken breast with lemon juice. (I didn't have fresh lemon, but it was fine.)  My husband liked it, and I'll definitely make it again!

This was good! My husband went back for seconds, so that is always a good sign. I did cook my chicken before hand for times sake. But other then that I followed the recipe. I did add a little less lemon juice, and wished I had added even LESS because it was too sour for both of us. So will do that next time. Loved the idea of cooking the noodles in the broth, tasted great.

Had a fresh lemon from a friend's tree, so I gave this a try. Much better than I expected.  Nice change of pace.  I did add about a cup of quality parmesan to the sauce.  Husband claims to hate lemon chicken, yet there were no leftovers.  Try it!

OMG!  Easy and delicious....  can't get any better than that!!!  This one's definitely a keeper!  Maybe even a once-a-weeker!!  Yep, it's that good!  And I made it just like it calls for...  w/one small exception..  I had to use regular lemon juice throughout the recipe because I didn't have a fresh lemon.  I started off just tasting, but then kept on tasting and had to MAKE myself stop eating for fear there wouldn't be any left for when hubby came home from work!

Probably more of a 4 and a half stars but really yum!  I followed the recipe exactly except that I just sqeezed 1/2 the lemon onto chicken to bake and 1/2 into broth.  Also at the end I added about a half cup fresh grated parmesean cheese and about 2 tbs. minced Italian parsley just before serving and it tasted great.  You will be surprised at the creamy lemony flavor and how fresh and light it tastes.  I just served with some green peas and a favorite wine for a deliciously different dinner.

I grilled 4 chicken breasts dusted liberally with a salt free lemon pepper. After cutting them 1/4" slice I mixed them into the pasta with the zest of one lemon and a 1/2 pint heavy cream. The flavor was delicious, but the sauce could have been a tad thicker.

I fix this tonight and the family really enjoyed it.  I had to increase enough for six but it worked out well.  The lemon zest gives it a flavorful but light taste that everyone loved.
I served it with steamed broccoli and salad.
Thanks for a great meal.

This was a pretty good recipe, it definitely needs more seasoning.  I used garlic and garlic salt.  Sautee'd the chicken and didn't follow the pasta recipe, although I can see where it would taste good that way.  I did add a can of chicken broth to the chicken after it was cooked and let it simmer for awhile.  I doubled the pasta as we have a big family and like leftovers for lunch.  I added the cooked pasta to the meat and let it cook until it abosobed most of the broth.  I also used 2 cups of half and half instead of the cream.  I thickened it a bit with flour, but I really don't think I would have needed to, and actually in the end more half and half or milk would have made it much better as it got a bit dry.  All in all, pretty good, but I will try some things different the next time as it really needed something more.

I thought this recipe was great overall. I was thrilled with the method of cooking the noodles in the chicken broth, and took other recommendations to cook the chicken via stovetop.  My only complaint is that the chicken flavor was a little overpowering, although it could be the particular broth that I used.  Next time I intend to do something along the lines of a 50/50 broth/water mixture for cooking the noodles, and perhaps adding some stock as needed to the rest of the sauce.  Very tasty overall though!

Delicious after a few changes: I up'd the amount of garlic (I love garlic), added red pepper flakes (gave it a little kick) and used half anf half to lower the calories.  Also threw is what frozen vegetables I had along with some capers.  

hint:  I added too much lemon zest and put in a teaspoon of splenda which balanced it out.  

Save time and saute the chicken (after cutting into bite sized pieces) in a skillet.  Was more moist that way too.

Thanks for an easy recipe.

Good heavens, this was one of the most unique & delicious dishes my husband & I have ever had. When preparing the noodles, I was unsure if the lemon juice I poured in the pan would be too much. It just felt like too much. However, I decided to trust the recipe & the creamy sauce was absolutely perfect. My husband has already made me promise to make this dish again! Thanks so much for posting.

This is a very good recipe! My husband tends to be on the picky side~ he took left overs to work the next day and when he returned from work..he gave me his blessing to do it again anytime. It is a keeper thank you!!!

This was really good.  We only give it 4 stars because it was too lemony for us.  But, I think this is because we followed the advice of other reviews and cooked the chicken in lemon juice rather than bake it.  I will make it again, but cut the lemon.

Very good stuff!  I did make a few changes -- one of which I regret.  Because I had overloaded the roasting mix with both lemon and garlic, I omitted the lemon zest from the final pasta boil.  I do think this lessened the overall lemon impact.  I also added one chopped red bell pepper and a small bag of frozen asparagus spears (the latter with each  frozen spear snapped in half).  These two additions were good choices.  BF said he thought snowpeas would also have been good; this recipe allows (and requires) the addition of a veggie (even frozen green peas would have worked).  I also substituted nonfat evap milk for the half-n-half.  Seemed to work just fine.  Really, really good, and a nice change from tomato-based pasta sauces!  Thanks

I was very dissapointed with this one.  I was left with a lot of the liquid that the pasta was cooked in.  The pasta was done in half the time that the recipe calls for.  If I had cooked it for the full time, even on a low setting, it would have turned into mush.  I found the dish lacking a depth of flavors, so I ended up adding parmesan and butter.  I should have just made a good alfredo sauce with the addition of lemon.  I think this dish needs some rethinking.

Yummy!  I didn't have any cream on hand, so I just added 2/3 cup mile with a Tbl. of melted butter.  It turned out fine, but I'll use cream next time.  My husband like it because it wasn't "too heavy".

I added feta cheese at the end and let it melt into the sauce.  It thickened the sauce and gave it a little more texture.  Great recipe!

I didn't have much time in the kitchen tonight so I browned bite-size pieces of chicken, and added a small chopped onion, garlic and lemon pepper. Then I added the broth, let it simmer and reduce a little, occasionally sloshing in lemon juice until it was how I liked it (I used bottled lemon juice as that's what I had) then added the cream. We had it with angel hair pasta. Great recipe - really zesty! Will definitely make again!

We love this recipe but one thing we have done to lower the fat content is to use about a cup and a half of nonfat yogurt and a quarter cup of milk mixed together instead of the heavy cream and we add bell peppers and onions.  We also grill the chicken with lemon pepper seasoning.  Love the recipe!!!!

I am not a strong cook but made this and it came out pretty great. Followed recipe but the end result was a little bland. I thought the lemon may be too much but I hardly tasted it. my husband loved how moist the chicken was but ended up adding some salt and Tony seasoning to give it a bit more flavor. Would probably marinate chicken next time and add red bell peppers, mushrooms and spinach.

I found this recipe like four years ago. I can‚Äôt tell you how many times I‚Äôve made it because it‚Äôs our absolute favorite meal. The only thing I changed is that I make it with bow tie pasta because once that was the only box of pasta I had on hand and we both loved it, so that‚Äôs what I make it with now.

Meh. I thought from the reviews that this would really be a hit, but even after adding butter and parmesan and basil and lots of extra garlic, salt and pepper to try to up the flavor, it was pretty bland. Each person put a good bit of salt, pepper and parmesan on their individual servings yet it was still pretty tasteless. Perhaps if I tried a recipe like this again I would add some veggies into the pasta itself (asparagus, mushrooms, tomatoes) and generous portion of either fresh rosemary or fresh basil.

Giving this a 5 even though changes made. I cubed the chicken and seasoned for a couple of hours prior to saut√©ing. I suggest that you use more seasoning than recipe calls for. I added broccoli to the pot while pasta was cooking. Also used 1/2&1/2 instead of heavy cream. A very hearty, rich dish. I used 4 cutlets, 1 lb of pasta, 1 lb of broccoli and about 1 1/2 cartons of chicken stock. This was enough for 6 people.

We doubled the pasta, spices, and lemon, but used less chicken. It seemed to work a little better for our tastes. The perfect ratio of chicken to pasta. Great recipe! We're adding it to our weekly staples.

Followed the recipe exactly. It had way too much lemon to the point no one could eat it. I love lemon but this was too much.

This is really good basically as is.  You just have to know basics or else I can see how it could turn out bland.  I used boneless, skinless organic chicken thighs, as breasts could easily be blander and dry out.  I am very picky about how I use chicken breasts - it could've worked but I wasn't in the mood for it! Lol. I also used half n half vs. the cream, as cream thickens more and is heavier.  We like a lighter sauce, but that's a personal preference.  Two details that probably matter: definitely use fresh lemon juice, and use a good chicken broth for optimal flavor and nutrients.  I used a homemade bone broth.  Lemon flavor isn't too strong, but adds a really nice touch.  It is especially important if using breasts.  Otherwise, this was cooked pretty much as written.  It's a keeper.

Taste was delicious. I did have a problem though with the noodles... to cook so long as to soak up all the liquid made my noodles soggy and break so there we no longer attractive. Maybe next time I won‚Äôt cook as long or use a stronger noodle. (I should put this disclaimer I am a bit of a novice but I can usually follow a recipe)

The whole family loved this, and it was so easy to make. The only modification I made was to use penne instead of rotelle. Otherwise, I did exactly as the recipe stated. Cooking the pasta in the broth and lemon juice is genius. The only thing I might do different next time is make extra!!

I cut down on the cream and added lots of fresh spinach at the end, which just wilts right into the dish nicely.  Love the creamy lemon flavor.  Delicious!  Might add sun dried tomatoes next time, too.

Great tasting easy recipe. Everyone loved it. I needed to double the pasta and broth.  Since it was summer, I cut the chicken into bite size pieces and saut√©d in a pan with butter until done. Soooooooo good.

I really liked this! I cubed chicken breasts and seasoned them with garlic powder, lemon juice pepper and lemon pepper before sauteeing them over the stove (would not have been against baking the chicken, but my oven was broken!). I then cooked an entire box of pasta instead of half and used almost 4 cans of chicken broth and half a cup of lemon juice with the seasonings. After almost all the liquid was absorbed I tossed the chicken with the pasta and then slowly added one cup of heavy cream- doubling the cream would have been way too much for me even though I doubled everything else! After letting sit for awhile it was so amazing- creamy, not TOO lemony and really tasty. If you want to add other veggies, etc. feel free. I think that this recipe is great as is but also forgiving for those of you who need more.

I enjoyed this dish! It is very simple to make and could adapt well to additional seasoning if desired. Due to food allergies I use gluten free pasta, coconut milk in place of cream and my own homemade organic chicken bone stock. This works well with leftover roast chicken too. I will be making this again!

Very tasty, will make again. I baked the chicken on 425 for 25 minutes. In my experience, this makes for more juicy chicken.

Excellent.  Followed the recipe except I grilled the chicken breast instead of oven baking (I just prefer grilled.) Otherwise followed the recipe as listed and will definitely make again.

I made the recipe as written, but when I tasted the pasta with the cream, it was very bland. I added some salt, more garlic powder and a little more lemon juice and pepper. Still didn't  have any distinct flavor (bland) and was drying out as the chicken took longer to bake. I added 1 tbsp of unsalted butter and cheese, (about 1-2 ounces of Trader Joe's soaked in Syrah). That small change made a BIG difference! Husband went back for seconds! ??

I have made this twice and will make it again soon.  Those who suggest sauteing the chicken may be trading speed for tenderness, a choice I would sometimes make.  I will not drain the excess liquid from the noodles before adding the cream and lemon zest next time.  I believe a smoother sauce will result.  I have used both rotele and rotini noodles and don't really think it matters.  Next time, I may try a penne rigate.  I doubled the recipe last night with exact doubling of ingredients.  Worked fine, with no changes.  I was sure that the chicken broth was too much but amazing absorption/evaporation occurred in the last 5 minutes.  Do not drain the liquid that remains, as I cautioned, above.  I served this dish with a make-your-own fruit salad buffet with choice of honey-yogurt or a champagne vinagrette dressings.  Only breadsticks were available.  Both red and white wines were offered and worked well.

Wow! This reminds me of a recipe from Nordstrom's Cafe called Salmon and Asparagus with lemon cream. I added salmon on the dish at the very end and some fresh Parmesan. I also doubled the recipe to feed a family of 4. Will make again!

I thought it was really tasty but unfortunately my kids thought the lemon flavour was too strong.  Likely won't be making it again because of that.  I followed the recipe exactly.

This dish was a big hit and I'll make it again.  Tried to follow the recipe but used fresh garlic as I don't have garlic powder on hand. Plus, we prefer the flavor of fresh garlic.  I doubled the liquid and pasta so I could easily feed the whole family.

Delicious! I love this meal! I think it's a new family favorite. My only critique is that the lemon flavor is a little too strong for me...but I think that's personal preference. I just use a little bit less lemon juice and a little more broth. I also salt the chicken before baking.

M family loves this, we have it at least once or twice a month. I bump up the lemon because that is what fits our taste. I also cut the chicken into bite size pieces and cook it in a skillet adding the finished pasta and sauce to the skillet to finish it, even my picky kids love this. Wonderful dish, thank you for sharing it!

I loved it the first time made!! Then had a guy try to make with me and messed the order of lemon in the boiled broth. It came out not as good as before, therefor I agree to leave the recipe as is. I am going to add some broccoli about five minutes before I add the heavy cream though.( just adding a veggie for kids, not changing anything though for sure).

If this recipe were a symphony, the lemon taste would be more than a subtle English horn but less than a blaring trumpet.  I read the various reviews before trying this and think I fall into the "don't mess with the basic recipe camp."  I mixed in some mushrooms (which, truth be told, neither added nor detracted from the final product); otherwise, I was true to the recipe in every way.  The only question is whether the presentation would be improved by leaving the breasts whole, serving them on a bed of pasta (as opposed to chopping them up and mixing them in with the pasta).  I wish I could make the visual appearance jump off the plate with the same boldness as the flavor of the dish itself.

Just follow the recipe and you'll be delighted with the results.  What a great way to cook pasta...more flavorful and easier than the traditional method of boiling and straining.  One less pot to clean.  I'll be serving this yummy dish to family and guests.  Have already distributed the recipe to foodie friends and relatives.  Thank you!

Some of the recipes that I've found on here can really be bland but not this one! This was really good as written. The only thing I might add next time is some veggies. We like broccoli and mushrooms. I love the lemony taste and it wasn't overpowering at all. Love this recipe!

I tried this recipe the other night and made exactly as written, but I forgot the lemon zest.  It didn't have much of a lemon flavor without it.  It wa still a good tasting dish, but I will definitely try to remember that step next time.  The sauce was vrey thin though, despite adding some cornstarch to try to thicken it up.  Still, I would make it again.

Surprisingly tasty. Added broccoli at the end, and saut√©ed the cubed chicken rather than baking, but the recipe would have been just fine without these alterations.

I just made this last night, and I think it's going to be added to the official "repertoire" of pasta dishes at my house!  

My alterations - I didn't have a lemon or zest, so just used a bit extra lemon juice.  I also sauteed the chicken.  I used bouillon instead of broth (measured out to the same amount).  I added broccoli and red pepper at the end, to provide some veggies and give it color.

Personally, I was surprised with how this turned out.  The lemon was subtle, but definitely present.  It was a thicker sauce than I expected, and the cream balanced out the sourness of the lemon perfectly.  It was a hit with both myself and the fella.  The only thing I would probably add in the future is a little more salt.  We both had to salt at the table.  Otherwise, if you follow the directions and make reasonable substitutions, it's a very delicious and easy dish to prepare!

Great dish just needed some love. I marinated the chicken a day before ( pick whatever marinade you like) then grilled the chicken and cubed it up instead of baking it. I added some Italian cheeses and a pinch of rosemary to the sauce. I also used a different type of pasta ( choose whatever you like) since their recommendation was hard to find.

Incredible recipe!!  Thank you for posting it.  I made this using some left-over pasta, and did make one change to the recipe.  I marinated the chicken breasts in the lemon garlic for about half an hour before cooking them.  They were so juicy, so tender, so tasty, that we ate until we could hardly move.  My cream sauce was fairly thin, so we just poured it over the chicken.  We eat a lot of chicken, but this was so bright, so rich tasting, and so easy that I think we have found a new favorite.  If you are looking for a really good alternative to plain old regular, you MUST try this.

Because I had chicken stock and not broth was the only change I made.  This was well-received by two teens and a tween! Definitely a keeper!

I love to make this dish. I first found it over a year ago and made it exactly as directed then. Not being a huge fan of chicken, I use Andouille Sausage or sometimes broccoli. I slice the sausage and brown it in a frying pan and then follow the other steps as directed. Delicious dish!

I liked this recipe! I boiled the chicken in water & canned broth with probably 1/4 cup lemon juice.  I added penne pasta to the boiling broth/water.  Then made a roux with butter & flour, letting it brown a bit before adding enough half & half to make it smooth.  I added the chicken/pasta/broth to the roux & mixed it well, then added a bit more lemon juice, zest & frozen peas.  Everyone enjoyed it!

Yummy. I didn't have any cream so I substituted whole milk with a bit of cream cheese and added sliced mushrooms & asparagus. It turned out great and was scarfed up by everyone. I love recipes that use a lot of lemon and its zest.

Really liked it! I accidentally was a little heavy-handed with the lemon juice, so mine was a bit more zesty than I think was intended, but still a hit! After tasting the finished recipe the way it was written, I decided to add some fresh chopped basil which I thought added a little extra deliciousness. Will be making this again, and plan to experiment with adding vegetables.

This recipe is a great base. I slow cook my chicken and then shred it before putting it in. I also add all sorts of vegetables- broccoli, sauted onion, red pepper, and mushrooms are my favorite to go with this.

As is, this dish was strikingly delicious. The lemon flavor is there in gobs; I didn't put in all the chicken, maybe 2.5 breasts. I would say that it could use a little less lemon, but it's a preference thing, and I couldn't even begin to tell you how much to take out. The lemon flavor saturates the dish on the 2nd and 3rd days, so try to enjoy it as much as possible on the 1st. This is a great tasting dish, a must try.

I tried this recipe exactly as it is laid out and it was easy and very delicious! One of the best chicken pasta recipes we've had (my husband agrees). We do have a lot of family with dietary restrictions, so I made the recipe a second time with a couple substitutions- I used full-fat coconut milk for the heavy cream, brown rice noodles, and an organic chicken broth. The flavor was a little different than the original recipe, but just as delicious. This is truly a great recipe- dietary restrictions or not! It is so hard to find recipes that are easy, delicious, and good for those with a lot of eating restrictions. I think the best thing about this recipe is the way the noodles are cooked in the broth with the spices and lemon juice. Definitely a keeper!

Made exactly as written and it was absolutely DELICIOUS! My husband went back for thirds because it was so, so good! Only change I made was that I used penne that I had on hand. Truly excellent!

I just finished it. This was so easy and extremely flavorful. Like others I cubed the chicken and put it in a bowl with the some about 1/2 cup lemon juice, garlic powder, pepper, fresh minced garlic and a pinch of ginger. When the chicken was done I drained most of the water and added some frozen broccoli, amazing !!! I will definitely make this again, maybe with spinach next time.

This is a delicious pasta dinner! It has a very strong lemony taste, which I liked. However, there was an overwhelming amount of chicken so I would use two breasts instead of three next time.

I loved this recipe! I really loved the zingy lemony flavour with the creamy pasta garlic chicken combination! SOOOO delicious and incredibly easy!  Made it as is, with the exception of the pasta because I couldn't find the rotelle. Used penne rigate instead. The only comments from my family, were: needs more sauce; it's too lemon-y. I may try to accommodate my husband by making it even MORE creamy next time, but I found the amount of lemon just perfect. We'll be making this one again.

I was trying to make the recipe as written, however, I forgot to put the 1/4 cup of lemon juice in the water with the pasta, so I put it in after.  It was quite lemony but still good.  I would make this again.

5 Stars based on the variations I made.  I do want to try the original sometime, my husband however, isn't supposed to have heavy creams and such with his heart issue.  Plus I will admit, it sounds a bit bland, but am willing to give it a try.

That being said, I used shrimp instead of chicken (yummy!) and cooked the pasta as directed.  The pasta turned out great and did take about 25 min.  Instead of cream I used 1% milk mixed with some low fat greek yogurt.  Then added in a little Parmesan cheese, onion, and asparagus that I had cooked in the oven.   Both my husband and I loved this and will become a regular meal!

Very good!  I liked cooking the pasta in broth. Makes perfect sense to me. In spite of the creaminess, I didn't get that've heavy full stomach feeling I get when eating say an Alfredo type sauce. This was very good!

I made an account just to review this recipe... I have had great success with recipes from this site but the noodles cook for so long that they become mushy and the dish ends up tasting like chicken broth. We threw in some Parmesan which helped a little but all in all it was a sour chicken broth mess. Yikes

This was one of those recipes that served as inspiration for me to play around in the kitchen - I could tell the basic recipe would be too plain for my liking.  I added some oregano, parmesan, basil, and extra lemon (unlike other reviewers, I actually thought the lemon flavor was too mild).  I also used angel hair instead.  Once I made a few tweaks, this dish became absolutely amazing.  My husband gobbled it down and he generally doesn't care for pasta.  It's a keeper.  Next time I'll likely add some veggies to give it some color, but otherwise it's fantastic.

I made this exactly as per the recipe to be able to review it fairly.  We found this very bland but I think with some tweaks mentioned in other reviews, it could be a good starting point.  As it is you could taste the lemon mildly but not much else.  It needs more flavour.

Loved it!!!  I used more lemon and I added a bit of sour cream at the end.  I also pressure cooked the chicken because it's quicker and produces extremely tender chicken.  I'll be making this again!

This recipe was OK. There's definitely a lot of potential for it to be great, but needs some adjustments before that. That being said, some people probably really like the super chicken brothy taste of the sauce so obviously this is totally subjective.  If I were to make this again, I would just totally skip the boiling pasta in broth portion of this recipe. I would make the pasta regularly and prepare the chicken broth separately but with half the amount because as I said, for me it was wayyyyy too chicken broth tasting. I also used fresh garlic and saut√©ed onions and red pepper and added the cream and chicken to that. Overall, it wasn't bad but definitely not a 4 or 5 star dish.

Yummy! I used angel hair pasta and I used 1/2 cup evaporated milk as I didn't have any heavy cream. I sauteed the chicken instead of baking it. I will definitely be making this again!

With all the rave reviews I was certain this would be a winner but we found it to be just so-so; very little flavor going for it.  I followed the recipe except added some broccoli during the last 7-8 min. of cooking.  Without the broccoli it would have been really bland.

Simple and very flavorful. I doubled the recipe and it can serve a family of 4, 5. Also, I sauted about 6 sprigs of asparagus until semi-soft but with some crispness and add. Or, I add 1 can of artichoke hearts, diced. Both veggies, asparagus and artichokes, blend well with lemon.

Please, make this EXACTLY as it states and I promise you, the flavors ar soooo wonderful together!!!  I made sure to used a fresh squeezed lemon on the chicken breasts and used lemone juice from a bottle to add to the pasta.  Added some asparagus to it at the end, and it was a huge hit!!  Kudos to the person who shared this!!!

I liked this. Simple with not too many ingredients. Only change: I used thin cut chicken breasts and started the broth first, really cut down time to cook.

Rachel Dobbs is right.  I do not mind reading little tweaks to a recipe, but I do not think you should rate a recipe unless you have made it as described.  Then, if you like, make it again with your tweaks and tell us the result.  But to totally reconfigure a recipe is not fair to the original cook.  I have not made this recipe yet, but it sounds great, and I will make it just as indicated.

Tart, salty, creamy. Sooooo good. I did change it up - no garlic powder or pepper (just a little garlic salt and pepper after putting it on the table - each person chooses), only added the lemon and zest after it was cooked, and I always use chicken I've already cooked - or I just gently boil some chicken. I also use linguine or spaghetti and less chicken broth.

I just made this and its wonderful. I was looking for a simple chicken dish to make with the supplies i had on hand. I did make some small changes, mostly because I didn't have everything, and there were very small changes. I didn't have a lemon, so i just used lemon juice, and I only had one can of broth , so I had to use chicken bullion and water to make up the difference. It still came out wonderful. I also added oregano, only because I like that on with my pasta dishes, and after i tasted everything, I did add some steamed veggies. I try to get those in every meal anyways. I would defiantly make this dish again. So very easy to make. And also would be easy to alter to taste. Some seasonings to give it a kick, if thats what you like. Some cooked down spinach to help fill it out and add those veggies. Its a must make for everyone, and I did not find it had to much lemon, and i love lemon. If you do, leave out the zest. Or if you are like me and love lemon, add more juice and zest. I will next time

This recipe "needed something".  Salt, for sure, but maybe something else. It was just bland.  It has promise, though.  I'd like to mess with it again.

I really liked this pasta dish!  I pretty much followed the recipe except for substituting a different pasta I had in my cupboard, and took the spice measurements as guidelines.  Great dinner and looking forward to leftovers tomorrow :)

I made this last night and we loved it! The only thing I changed is the time on the pasta, as mine was perfect in about half the time. Other than that, I made no changes. I was skeptical at first with the way the pasta is prepared, but I'm happy I didn't shy away from following the directions. It was delicious. This would taste great with some artichoke hearts or fresh mushrooms, but it is also great the way it is. This will definitely be included in our regular rotation!

It was good, but not great. Like others, I thought it lacked something. I tried adding Parmesan cheese, which helped. Then I added a little salt. That made a world of difference. I did follow the recipe as written, except I used bottled lemon juice. As I cut up the baked chicken, I sneaked a bite. It was wonderful. I may just make the chicken next time.

This was sooo easy to make.  I cut the chicken breasts into tender sized strips to make it easy to cut into smaller pieces after baking.  Added zuccini and mushrooms just before the chicken and heavy cream.  Sprinkle with a little Parmesan cheese and dig in!!  I also prefer Penne Pasta...it worked perfectly!

Delicious. I follow the recipe pretty closely. The only thing I changed was the type of pasta. I think chicken tastes much better when baked than cooked in a frying pan. I will also be cooking pasta in broth more often now. This was so easy! I can't wait to make it for my boyfriend!

I really loved this recipe the only thing I will definitely do next time is less lemon juice in the broth... a lot less. Even my sister who loves lemons thought it was too much. That's the only reason why I'm not rating it 5 stars. Other than that I thought it was amazing. I will definitely be making this again.

I kind of feel like I shouldn't rate this recipe, b/c I made a couple alterations and it didn't come out very good. The only alterations I made was to use whole wheat pasta, b/c that's all we buy, and half and half instead of heavy cream b/c I couldn't find heavy cream. Is heavy cream the same as heavy whipping cream that you use for baking? I didn't think that would be the same thing so I just got half and half. But everything else I followed the recipe exactly and it just wasn't good. I wonder if the wheat pasta gave it a weird texture and flavor. But I didn't really care for the lemon taste either. I won't make this again. It was edible, but definately not great.

Delicious!  I did brown the cubed chicken in a little olive oil instead of the oven which saved time.  Also, instead of cream I used 2% milk and it worked out fine.  At the end I tossed in some freshly grated parm cheese and about 2 tablespoons of fresh chopped basil.  Very good and super easy!

This was very good - light and the perfect amount of lemon flavor.  I used penne pasta and only 16 oz of chicken broth because that is what I had on hand.  The pasta only took 20 minutes but came out perfect.  You need to watch this part closely.  Both my husband and I felt it needed a little  something else - maybe some onion and/or parmesan cheese, mushrooms, or a vegetable.

Seriously wonderful--one of the best recipes I've tried lately. A very different, lovely taste. I couldn't for the life of me imagine what this would taste like but it came out really wonderful, and light for a cream sauce. I substituted 12 ounces of broccoli for chicken, and that was very nice, too, for anyone out there looking to cut down on meat. Next time I'll have to double it if I do it this way. Thanks so much Lisa for a wonderful recipe.

Excellent recipe and a huge hit with the whole family, including the kiddos.  I add whatever green veggie I can such as broccoli, kale, etc., and it tastes just as good while adding a bit more nutritional value.

SOOO Good.  Husband instantly LOVES it.  Our 5 year old likes it too.  AND for the picky eater 7 year old in our home, I just cooked the chicken and then cut off and saved some plain.  Ditto with the pasta, I set some off plain before I mixed in the cream and chicken.  Be sure to cook down as much as possible to make for a creamy sauce.

This recipe is outstanding!  I'm not a huge lemon  chicken person, but my husband was requesting some sort of lemon chicken over pasta.  I found this recipe, and am in love!  We will be making this at least once a week.  I might also try something a little different using the cooking method for the pasta from this recipe.  The flavor of the noodles just being cooking in the broth, garlic powder and pepper was so good that I may even try making the pasta again as directed in this recipe, and throw in some grape tomatoes and fresh basil towards the end.  Serve it with a little freshly grated romano cheese, and voila!

Excellent! I followed the exact receipe but cut down the portions to half for 2 servings. I love baking, it's much less oil and tasty! My husband and I enjoyed this easy, quick and yummy dish.

LOVE this recipe. It is one of my new favoritesand my family loves it too. The first time I made it, I followed the recipe exactly. It turned out too "lemony" for my taste so the next time I made it I left out the lemon zest and it turned out perfect. Just so you know, I am able to get 1/4 cup of lemon juice using about 2 large lemons. I buy 3 lemons for the whole thing. I've also varied the amount of chicken based on what was available (anywhere from 2-3 regular chicken breasts) and it turned out just fine. I also use whatever pasta I have on hand. I would recommend trying it!

I made this recipe exactly as written except I added some paprika to the chicken and I used half and half instead of cream to reduce the fat.  It was delicious and I will definitely make it again.  However, next time I will leave some of the broth unabsorbed to make a creamier sauce and I will add some vegetables to give the dish more dimension.  Maybe some wilted baby spinach or some asparagus. Thanks for the great recipe.

Needed a little more garlic powder / pepper to the finished dish. Also added butter to taste... the chicken would have been better if grilled instead of being baked and then added into the dish... definately a keeper though...

LOVE this recipe. I did cut the cream down to 3/4 of a cup, but it's personal preference (I'm not a fan of creamy sauces).  This makes the lemon taste a little stronger, but we love citrus so it's fine for us.  This one is being moved into our regular dinner rotation.

This recipe was great! I did cook the pasta for only 10 minutes instead of 25 so it wouldn't be mushy, and added a few artichoke hearts and sauteed mushrooms at the end.  All in all, a really good meal!

The only reason I'll make this again is because my kids really liked it, but it will not be made often: I used shredded chicken and fresh lemon. This is way too lemony and if I hadn't made it myself, I would have thought it was tuna (due to flavor and not just texture).

I really liked this recipe, especially because it's just so different from the usual chicken dish. I forgot to buy the rotelle pasta, which would have been perfect for this dish, so I had to use something else I had handy. I'm sure I'll make this dish again.

This was a good one.  I ended up cutting the chicken into bite size pieces and mixing it in with the pasta.  I also threw in some baby spinich and that was a nice touch.  Overall, I liked this one.  The kids liked it too.

This should definitely only be served as a side dish. I made it for dinner tonight, and we all enjoyed the first few bites and after that it just didn't taste right. So a few bites as a side would be okay, but I wouldn't ever serve it as a main dish again. It just wasn't very good, a disappointment because I was really looking forward to it.

I love this dish! It does had a lemon cream flavor. I love lemons plus I have a lemon tree so I will make this again. I added onion, broccoli and cilantro I used any pasta I had on hand. LOVE IT. But it didnt take 25 mins for the liq to asorbed way less. So do keep your eye on it and stir so it wont burn.  Thanks for sharing and God bless!

Very solid, easy, low-calorie meal. I truly enjoyed how easy it was and how I didn't need to chop for one night. If I were to do it again I would make a few changes but that certainly doesn't hurt the rating since we all have different tastes.
 
My only "con" was that I didn't think it was as full-flavored as I would like. The chicken was good but the pasta lacked a little flavore because of the lack of sauce.

Everything else though is perfect. Relatively cheap, simple, quick....loved it.

Very good, followed the recipe to the letter.  I did find myself salting it liberally at mealtime but that's probably more my tastes than the recipe.  The photo threw me for a loop though, made me take extra time finding the rotelle in the store :P

Eh...this was alright.  I took the advice of one reviewer and didn't change anything because they original recipe was amazing, but if you like an infusion of flavor this dish isn't for you.  It wasn't creamy and pretty boring.  I'm glad I tried it before serving it to my husband.

This was a very tasty recipe. Thank you Lisa! It is wonderful as is, or to add some color and a bit of veggie flavor I added some diced roma tomatoes and about 2-3 cups of steamed small or chopped broccoli florets, my family loved it!

I LOVE this! I made some homemade rigatoni from the semolina and egg pasta recipe from this site. I also cooked cut up chicken in a pan, I like the crust on it. I used real garlic, peppercorn, paprika and rosemary. I also added some onion. Personal preferences. I deglazed the pan with lemon cello. Reduced that with the lemon juice and some lemon zest. Added the chicken broth then added enough cream to thicken it to my liking. I poured this over the cooked pasta...homemade pasta takes two-three min to cook in boiling water and did not know if it would be over cooked doing as stated in recipe, I like my pasta a little al dente. Also put some grated parm on top.  I still give it five stars even though I changed the original recipe to suit my tastes. I do not look at recipes with low rating, would be a shame not to try this one. I always read the reviews and I ALWAYS tweak recipes.

Delicious!  One of the first things I will say is this dish is quite heavy & hearty, I don't personally feel that 4 servings is accurate, I'd say it's more like 6, but obviously that depends on what kind of an eater you are.  I made some very insignificant changes that I don't believe affected the taste, so I'm sticking with 4 stars (and actually would give it 4 1/2 if that were an option), but I will discuss my changes to be fair.  I don't like "thick" chicken, so I pounded my breasts, which also allowed the cooking time to shorten to about 25 minutes (yay!).  It does say to lightly grease pan, I greased mine well with butter, which I think added to some browning and carmelization on the bottom (which eliminated the "whiteness" of the chicken that many complain about).  That combined with the pepper seasoning gave the chicken a nice color.  Also, because so many stated it was too lemony, I left out the lemon zest at the end after I tasted it, I didn't personally think it was needed.  Also, I cut up some asparagus and added it to the pasta/broth during the last 7 min of boiling, and then threw in some cut up tomatoes at the very end along with the cream.  I just like veggies in my things, and I liked the added color.  But my son ate it sans veggies (as written) & it was still yummy.  Lastly, I only used 3/4 c cream, which was sufficient (I felt guilty enough already!!).  I loved it and so did my very picky kids!  Great dish, try it just as is, you won't be disappointed.

Absolutely delicious!  I made it exactly as the recipe called for with no variations, and it turned out delicious.  In my opinion, it didn't need tweaking.  My husband LOVED it.  I will definately be making this again and again.

I've used this recipe with wheat spaghetti a few times and it turns out amazing each time.  I usually use minced garlic instead of powder and chicken stock instead of broth.  I omit the lemon zest and use a "homemade" version of heavy cream (mixing melted butter and milk with a teaspoon of flour) instead.  Excellent citrus recipe for pasta, hands down!!!

After reading the raving reviews, I was looking forward to this dish. I was disappointed and so was my family. It lacked flavor. I may experiment with it and try adding some capers. It was not very appealing on the plate either.

Wow!  This is awesome.  My family could not stop carrying on about how flavorful it was.  I made it pretty close as directed but swapped out real garlic for the powder and bottled lemon juice for the real lemon.  I also used whole wheat pasta.  This will definately be a regular at our house.  The portion sizes are very large.  Actually is more like 6.

Delicious! I was even asked to make this again!  We love chicken sprinkled with lemon pepper, and this is a great "homemade" version, as opposed to using the powder in the jar.  I follow this recipe exactly and it comes out wonderful!

My family loves this recipe. The only pasta I had was mini penne. I used 3/4 of a box, doubled the sauce recipe and added more garlic. I also stirred in all the drippings left in dish with chicken. I skipped the zest. It was creamy and the flavors were perfect. Def. make it again! Jacklie

I made this for company and doubled the recipe.  Everyone loved this, my daughter-in-law who is usually a light eater, couldn't stop herself from having 3rds.  I did have to add just a bit more cream.  Very easy to prepare and then put together just before dinner.  It is a keeper

I am not the best cook in the world, but I found this recipe easy to follow and it came out delicious. My pasta cooked a little quicker than anticipated so I removed from heat and returned to heat when the chicken, cream and zest were ready.

Really good! My entire family loved it, including my 9 and 6 yr olds. Didn't have garlic powder, so I added a seasoning salt I love. To make lower fat, I used fat free 1/2 and 1/2 and while I am sure using heavy cream would have been wonderful, I loved it without the fat.

This was very good. I used chicken tenders which cut the baking time in half. I didn't have cream so used a combination of half and half and whole milk and it still turned out fine. Husband loved it. Downside is that it lacks color- maybe next time I will add broccoli in with the pasta?

I'm giving this 2 stars. while it's a wonderful lemony, creamy chicken dish idea... it turned out totally bland after I followed the recipe to a T!! Needs S-A-L-T..(shame on me for not recognizing this before I served it up!) more lemon rind and may a sprinkle of basil on top  to finish off?

Great recipe!!  I did however cu the chicken up and sauted it  in the same ingredients and added red and green peppers.  This really added a lot of extra flavor.  I also added a tsp. of jalps to add a zing. I mixed it in with the chicken. Sounds crazy but it was good.  Will absolutly mke this again!!

Yummy!  I added some lemon pepper to the chicken & cooked it in a skillet instead of in the oven.  Some things could be added such as broccoli, mushrooms, tomatoes, or asparagus but I made it with the chicken & pasta alone & it was great!  Will definitely make again!

I have made this recipe several times and have never changed a thing with the exception of using angel hair pasta instead of rotelle.  My family absolutely loves this.  This is my super picky three-year-old's favorite dish.  I made this once for a large family function and quadrupled the recipe.  It worked really well and everyone begged me for the recipe afterwards.  I will continue to make this again and again.  Delicious!

This was good, but a bit bland. Next time I will double the lemon and the garlic. The pasta turned out nicely cooked as is. 1 cup of cream was WAY too much for me. I will use 1/2 a cup next time.

This is a great recipe! It's a once a week dinner for us now! I originally made it as written, but as a busy mom of 4,  I needed to make a quicker version. I use precooked chicken and leftover noodles,but I always use the ingredients in the recipe for the sauce. I do add broccoli, but not because the recipe needs, my kids just love broccoli.

This was so delicious, I used half and half in place of the heavy cream, and was very satisfied, the pasta has so much flavor, cooking it in broth really makes a difference.

Good flavor but next time I will boil the noodles first and add them at the end, they did fall apart. I used penne pasta. I also cut the lemon juice to 1/8 cup and it was just the right amount of lemon flavor. I seasoned the chicken breast, baked it uncovered at 425 for 30 minutes then took it out of the oven, covered it with a tight fitting lid and let it sit for 5 minutes. I always bake my chicken breast like this and it turns out perfect every time. Will make again.

Great dish. I added red and yellow bell peppers and used bow ties instead of rotelle. I also added some crushed red pepper for a little kick. I did not bake the chicken. After reading other reviews I decided to save time and just cook it in a frying pan with some italian dressing and white wine.

This recipe was great!  The lemon is a little strong but I love lemon so it's ok with me.  If you don't like a lot of lemon I would recommend halving it. I made a few adjustments, I omitted the chicken and added sauteed mushrooms with the broth and fresh basil at the end.  I also  really wanted to make homemade pasta so I just reduced the broth with the mushrooms. I added the pasta to the broth and cooked it for a couple of minutes before I added the cream.  Delicious!!!

A good recipe.  I cut the chicken in cubes and fried it with onion, lemon juice and fresh garlic so the chicken would absorb more of the flavours.  I also blanched peppers and broccoli and added them to the dish at the end.

I made this and it was great. However, I didn't let the pasta cook for 25 minutes, because it was starting to get soggy after about 15 minutes (package says to cook 8-10 minutes). So I just drained off the liquid and saved it for the next time I make this. Then I added about half the cream.   So I have a question- if you cook the pasta for 25 minutes, won't it get soggy? This recipe has such good reviews and no one seems to have done what I did, so I'm curious.

i made this for dinner tonight. it was delish! i did take some people's advice and cut back on the lemon juice. i also made it vegetarian by substituting the chicken broth for vegetable broth and using quorn fake chicken. even my little 21month old daughter cleaned her plate! ill definately be making this again.

This had a very distinct, but not overpowering, lemon taste which I found light and delicious even though it was a cream sauce.  Very good as is, but next time I plan to use chopped fresh garlic as well since we love love love garlic.  I served it with a side of sauteed zucchini and it was a yummy meal!

I made this recipe almost exactly as written, the only thing I changed was that I also made a rue of flour and milk only because I had no heavy cream.  I thought it was an excellent recipe, the lemon wasn't overpowering, and all the flavors combined very nicely.

I made it just how it was written except I didnt bake the chicken. It was just ok, nothing special. Maybe I'll make it again. Not a  big hit.

I cooked the chicken earlier in the day (I'm sure you could cook it, then keep it in the fridge for a day or two to make it, if you want). Too much pepper and make sure you cook the noodles long enough!  Otherwise, this was a success!

This was fantastic! I was all out of Chicken so skipped it and it was still very good. Just the right amount of lemon too. I served it will Salmon and asparagus on the side and it was a perfect combination.

I cooked the chicken at 400 degrees for 30 minutes to save myself a bit of time. Chicken was still excellent.   My husband is a meat and potatoes kinda guy, and not too into pasta. I made this recipe hoping and praying he would like it.... Chicken was perfect and the noodles were fabulous... He actually wished there was more sauce and more noodles (WOW!). This recipe is a repeat. Excellent.

this is a great recipe....I augment it slightly so that it takes less time.  Instead of baking the chicken in the over, I put a little olive oil in a frying pan, along with the pepper and squeeze a lemon over it and cook the chicken in a frying pan.  Just saves a bit of time

Very simple and tasty! I sauted my chicken in oil rather than baking it to save time. I also added some broccoli and cauliflower. The broth/spice/lemon juice mixture gave the pasta an awesome taste!

This recipe was fantastic! I halved it, and added 2 tablespoons of cream instead of 1/2 cup, but I followed the recipe to the letter otherwise and it was exellent, and very simple.

I thought this dish was amazing. It was delicious and really easy to make. I had to make a few last minute adjustments (no garlic salt and rotini instead of rotelle ) but it still turned out great. Mine didn't take as long as the recipe suggested but that's not a bad thing. My friend said it was a little too lemony but I thought it was perfect.

This was, by far, one of the best dishes I have found. It's so simple, and SO delicious. Also, I'm not one for leftovers (I actually refuse to eat almost anything that is leftover), but I ate this the next day, and the next day! I was glad I made so much! Note: Using fresh lemons makes ALL the difference!

I cooked the chicken in the broth as well to save time. At first I wasn't so sure about this recipe, but after it sat for 15 minutes and the flavors melded together it was awesome! I used a little less lemon juice on mistake. You could add extras like tomatoes, etc., but this is very good as is.

Very tasty! It has a good mix of tangy and saltiness. I personally would add a bit of carrots or mixed vegetables, but my husband said he likes it just like it is.

Quick and easy. To save on dishes and time, I just sauteed the chicken with the spices in the same pot I made the sauce in. It was a great switch up from the usual pasta dishes we have here. Definitely want to try it with red peppers next.

I believe you have to truly follow this recipe as written to fully be able to grade it.  Super easy, time effective, flavorful, and EVERYBODY loved it!! I loved how the pasta is cooked and you really can not grasp the flavor of it all unless you follow the directions. Cooking the chicken ahead with out the seasoning, or trying to saute it on the stove top risks both the flavor and the moisture of the chicken.  Five stars from this mom & hostess.

Despite all the rave reviews, i found this to be boring. Thats not to say that this was bad because we finished it but it definitely wasnt creamy enough and was lacking some kind of veggie. I followed the recipe exactly. Average at best.

I enjoyed this recipe.  I think next time I will add some veggies in with it as suggested by other reveiws.  I had to get a bit creative with cooking the pasta.  My family is GF, so I used spelt pasta.  The spelt pasta is more delicate and could not stand up to the 25 minutes of cooking.  So, I scooped it out earlier than that.  Other than that I followed everything as written.  Maybe some brocoli next time.

This was sooo....Good! WOW! Our family loved this! Used Lemon Juice only (had No Lemons) Used half & half (instead of heavy cream). Also used some fresh garlic on chicken. I think this would be good with broccoli in it too. I think I will try that next time.

I used fettuccine.  I love the way the pasta absorbs the lemon/chicken broth flavors.  Except for the lemon zest, I followed the recipe exactly.  I will def. make again.

This recipe is so refreshing.  The lemon flavor is just right (although I must confess that my husband and I LOVE lemons).  I have cooked this twice now, the first time as it is written.  The second time I replaced the heavy cream with crumbled goat cheese.  It gave it a tangier flavor, plus saved a few calories along the way.  Very tasty!

Excellent dish!  Very easy to make and extremely flavorful.  I was expecting it to be quite tasty, but not THIS tasty.  Thanks so much!

Nice and easy, delicately flavored dish.  I used light cream and penne, because that's what I had on hand.  A little fresh parmesan on top didn't hurt!

Love this recipe.  I grill the chicken and then slice it and serve it on top of the pasta.  I make this dish for new moms and it's always a hit!

I love this recipe also.  I followed it as directed and it was delicious.  I would not skip boiling the pasta in the broth/lemon mixture.  It really infuses the flavor into the noodles.  Wouldn't be the same without it.  I am going to add some tomatoes and peppers to the mix next time.

I made this recipe exactly as it is written and it took about an hour to cook.  It was very easy to make and turned out to be extremely delicious!  The only thing I will do different next time is I plan to use less chicken because the three chicken breasts called for in the recipe seemed to be too much for my family.  Definitely give this one a try!!

This was excellent. I had to alter some things with what I had on hand-but this recipe led to an awesome dinner. I had some precooked chicken strips on hand I wanted to cook, so I let those simmer in chicken broth and lemon juice with garlic pepper and green pepper and onions in a sauce pan while I cooked the noodles as described in the recipe. I didnt have cream so I added skim milk (all I had) and butter to the noodle mixture instead. It still thickened up, and let me tell you, this was excellent. And because the chicken was precooked, this dinner only took me as long to cook as the noodles did. I did alter this recipe-but only because I was looking for a recipe where I could use the little I had on hand-and this did the trick. I highly recommend it, and cant wait to taste it with cream!

I had printed off this recipe and bought all the ingredients--was planning to make it for dinner.  I got home later than planned and found that my fifteen year old daughter had decided to surprise me--dinner was just being placed on the table!  It was excellent!  She followed the recipe exactly--Thanks for a great recipe!

I made this last night as part of a surprise dinner for my girlfriend and thought it was excellent.  Served with a caprese salad, garlic bread, and a locally made chardonnay, it made for a wonderful meal.  Cooking the pasta in the chicken broth helped to give it great flavor and the lemon added a very nice touch.  I will definitely be making this recipe again.  Given how simple and tasty the pasta element was, this would be a great recipe to combine with already prepared chicken leftovers.  I'll be eating some of the leftovers in about an hour for lunch and already cannot wait to make it again soon.

Good basic recipe, but turned out WAY too lemony.  My two year old wouldn't eat it, and she LOVES pasta.  IF I try this one again, will definitely halve the lemon, either cut out adding to the chicken or to the pasta water.

I love this recipe.  I had never cooked pasta using this method, but it works.  I had to add a little bit more broth to my noodles.  I recommend adding broccoli.

Excellent, excellent, excellent! I used grilled chicken from the night before - otherwise followed the recipe and also added some sauteed asparagus spears and mushrooms. The lemon taste was perfect and not too overpowering (which I think is because we used grilled chicken)

Nice dish.  I used quite a bit of lemon pepper for extra lemon flavor.  I also added red pepper flakes for a bit of a kick.  It was very good!

I loved this pasta! Cooking it in the broth gave the noodles soo much flavor! I added a little more lemon to the dish because I love it so much and also just cooked the chicken on the stove because it was quicker. I can't wait to make this again...i think i'll try either some asparagus or maybe broccoli mixed in to make the dish even better!

This is VERY lemony. My husband and I both like lemon chicken dishes but he ate leftovers instead of eating this. The flavors would have blended pretty well if the lemon wasn't so overpowering.

This was way better than I expected. I thought I would have left overs but my boyfriend and I ate it all up! This recipe didn't leave the pasta drenched in a heavy sauce, but gave it a light flavor. In stead of  rotelle pasta, I used multicolored spiral noodles and substituted milk and butter for the heavy cream.  I will definitely make this again!

My family loved this. My only issue was with the amount of black pepper - I used 1/2 tsp, and that was still quite a bit. I also used a covered stone baker to bake the chicken in the microwave in 7 minutes - it make for much quicker preparation.

We really enjoyed this.  It was something different, refreshing, and delicious.  My 3 year old took one bite and said, "I like this food you made, Mom, I'm going to eat it all gone!"  It's going into the rotation.  I loved the way the pasta was cooked.  I think I'll even make pasta like that and serve it alone as a side dish sometime.  Loved it!

Great recipe - hubby and I both loved it.  I did saute the chicken versus bake it, but it was still great as written.  I can't imagine changing anything else about it.  We will definately have it again and it not only be a family favorite but a company favorite as well.  Good going Lisa!

I thought this was heavenly! I used half and half to cut calories and then had to cornstarch the sauce to thicken it but that was my fault, I should have just followed as written and to hell w/the fat! THis will become a regular in our house.

This recipe was great. My husband loved it! I did make a few changes though. Instead of baking the chicken i cooked it on the stove top and sauteed it in the juice and seasoning. I also used lime juice and a little bit of orange juice in addition to the lemon juice. I also added some white wine and let that simmer for a little bit.It was very very good. The only other thing I added was some fresh tomatoes. I changed a lot but it was a very good recipe.

Excellent recipe for something different with chicken plus a good one dish dinner.  I baked the chicken as directed and it was very moist.  I did substitute half and half for the cream and the sauce was still yummy.  I added mushrooms and peas to mixed reviews. The mushrooms were good and I would add again but the peas weren't so good but I won't lower my rating for my adjustment.  Chicken could be baked ahead of time or you could even use left over chicken.  If you love lemon this is for you!

This was delicious.  i did prepare slightly different by using fresh garlic and sauting the chicken on the stove.  i also added whole mushrooms to the chicken as it cooked.  Kids liked the chicken but were not too sure about the pasta...they don't know what's good usually!  LOL!

We didnt like this much, I made it with whole wheat pasta and I that was a mistake. I followed the recipe to a tee and the pasta would just not cook properly. I gave it three stars because I think its worth another try with regular white pasta!

Great recipe!  I cooked the chicken at 375F for 12 minutes, flipping once because I wanted to speed up the process.  I only had to cook the pasta for 15 minutes, not the 25 stated in the directions.  Will definitely make it again!

This was absolutely delicious.  It tasted as if it came from an Italian Resturant.  I had heavy cream that was about to expire and had no idea what to do with it. When my husband comes home from Afghanistan, he will think he stopped in Little Italy.  Thanks for posting this receipe.

I'd give it a 10! Followed ingredients exactly but did saute some mushrooms.  I made this after work so the only change I made was to cook the chicken in oil in a frying pan to speed things up. I can't believe how wonderful the pasta tasted cooked this way - could taste the chicken broth and the lemon!! I can't stop talking about this dish.  This would be very impressive as an appetizer! Thanks submitter!!!

This recipe was so tasty!  I found it a couple weeks back and have been looking forward to a time when I could make it.  That time was tonight!  I stuck pretty closely to the recipe.  I sliced the chicken in short strips and sauted on the stovetop.  I also used a lemon oil I had for the saute.  I took others' advice and kept just a bit of liquid in so I could have a little more sauce.  The one thing I should have done was keep an eye on the pasta.  It didn't seem to take 25 minutes and I may have cooked it just a bit too long.  Otherwise, I am really impressed that something so simple can be so flavorful!

This is so good, I can't get enough of this pasta dish. I used tri-color rotini and cooked the chicken on the stove because I was running out of time. Turned out fanastic, even great heated up the next day.

i felt there was way too much cream, so i didn't end up eating most of it.  the rest of the flavour was really nice though, so i'm giving it a 4 knowing that next time i'll omit the cream and have the nicely flavoured pasta and chicken alone (sampled the dish before adding the cream and it was pretty delicious).

Very creamy and satisfying - nice blend of flavors.  I prepared the recipe as written, making only 1 change - I added about one tbsp of capers just before serving.  Husband and I both enjoyed it.

I really liked this recipe, the lemon pairs well with the cream sauce and chicken. It was very easy to prepare and the citrus adds a nice kick to it. My husband thought it was too lemony. I will make it again with less lemon for my family but I thought it was very good as written.

The sauce was very tasty, tho it came out very runny.  The rotelle was way, way overcooked and mushy. I used boneless pork instead of chicken and that was  tasty.  I also used "Penzey's Centennial Seasoning" instead of lemon pepper...it's much tastier.  We poured the  runny pasta and pork over the  steamed brocolli that  was going   to be the side.  I served it in bowls  and my 16 year-old daughter said "good glop, mom.  Next time, I will use  a bit  less stock  and hold  some back to  stir in if needed.  I'll also use a penne pasta as I think it will hold up to the process better.  Overall very tasty and will work with it again.  There is a lemon pasta sauce on the site that is nearly the same-just reduced a bit longer.  Nice starting point here...

We weren't a huge fan of this recipe.  While it made a nice hearty dish, I would describe the taste as "odd" and not quite right.  I love lemon in just about everything, but probably wouldn't repeat this combination.

Great recipe! I read previous reviews and decided to pan cook the chicken instead of bake it. I heated butter in the pan and added the chicken, seasoning with garlic powder and lemon pepper seasoning. I also added a large red bell pepper when the chicken was almost done cooking. The noodles were great, in addition to the cream I purchased some half and half because of all the reviews saying that it was too dry. I didn't experience this at all, the noodles were moist and flavorful - just be sure to watch them, I'm not sure on the exact time but it wasn't very long until they were done. Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe was quite good as is.  The sauce was relatively simple to make, and the pasta was flavorful and soft in just a few steps.  I loved using chicken broth instead of water - delicious!  My changes to the original recipe were minimal.  We used angel hair rather than rotelle because boyfriend is somehow opposed to rotelle or penne pasta.  Because of this,  though there were two and I used only 1.5 breasts of chicken, I maintained the recommended portion size for the sauce because angel hair tends to suck up liquid rather quickly.  I think the recipe is quite good as is, but to make this a truly special dish, I would follow some recommendations from other reviewers.

This wasn't particularly creamy. It tasted strongly of heavy cream and lemon. The whole thing was a bit dry. I've been making an average of 2 or 3 new recipes from this site each week for the last 6 months and this was the first time my husband said, "You can't give this 0 stars, can you?"

Best discovery on here so far.  Perfect as written here.  Very creamy and the lemon gives it a very unique and surprising kick.

My family really liked the flavors in this dish.  My husband especially liked the lemon and the kids all enjoyed it.  The only problem I had was it got a little dry and lost some of it's creaminess.  I might play with the amount of broth and cream to keep it more moist.  But the flavors were great and it will be on my repeat list.  Thanks for sharing.

You really have to baby sit the noodles.  I left mine alone for 2 minutes and I had to soak the burned pan for 2 days.  I salvaged the unburnt noodles and finished the dish.  It was missing some kind of veggie in it.

I added artichoke hearts but otherwise made it by the recipe. We used fresh lemon and I think that's really critical to the flavor. It could use some color but I think I would get that with a side of steamed brocolli. It was kind of gooey but who doesn't love a gooey pasta fix?

This is a pretty good recipe - just adjusted a bit to help suit my families tastes. Will make again but only every once in awhile, not going to be a regular.  
I, like others, cut up and cooked the chicken in the frying pan.  Tons of garlic, pepper, and added some red pepper flakes.
Cooking the pasta in chicken broth was a FANTASTIC change and idea!!

Wow, this was good! I did make some substitutions using items I already had in my pantry. Instead of garlic powder I used garlic salt, I used rotini instead of rotelle, and I added garlic butter to the pasta, broth mixture. It came out wonderfully!

I love quick, easy recipes because i'm very busy, but i commit to cooking dinner at least 4 times a week. I made this recipe for dinner tonight because my friend asked me too and there is absolutely NONE left. Everyone loved it. I did put my own spin on it, adding tri-color bell peppers and onion. I also added a little season salt, and since I only had 1 can of chicken broth, so I added a cup of water and a boullion cube. It Was Great!!

This was pretty good.  Took another member's suggestion and added mushrooms and red bell peppers.  It was a little too lemony for our taste, but definitely a keeper.  Next time, I think I'll cut back on the lemon juice and add artichoke hearts along with the mushrooms and red peppers and chicken.

I am not sure what happened with this but here it goes.  All I did different was cook the chicken on the stove top.  I tried to cook the pasta like directed, but it would have been a huge mess of mush.  I poured over 2 cups of broth off when the pasta was done and left the rest and made a sauce.  The flavor was good, but when a box of stock is over three dollars this turn into quite a meal when over half the box is wasted.  Next time I'm going to just cook the pasta in water and then make a sauce out of thickened stock and cream with the spices.  Maybe I screwed up something up but I really don't think so.  My vote is for good flavor but bad pasta instuctions.  Maybe someone could lend a hand and tell me what the deal is.

I'm a huge fan of pasta dishes and this is now one of my favorites with out a doubt. You get the satisfaction of a cream sauce with out the heaviness. I followed the directions for making the pasta as the recipe called for but I changed the chicken instuctions. I sauteed the chicken until cooked through with a clove or two garlic, splash of white wine and chunk of butter (EVOO would be find too,) then added asparagus pieces, and sliced mushrooms. Mixed the pasta and chicken together, added the cream and a handful of shredded romano cheese for extra flavor. It was fantastic! My husband doesn't care for pasta and if he does eat pasta it's never a cream sauce... and he loved this. I was shocked! Mine did lack "color" but that's just because I don't care for most veggies that would have added color. ANY VEGGIES would work with this recipe. Just customize it to your liking.

I followed the suggestion of some others and cubed my chicken and cooked it in a pan instead of baking. It didn't take nearly as long this way. I also steamed broccoli and added it once everything was done. It was excellent!!! I would add mushrooms but my husband hates them.

I agree this was a great inspirational dish.I marinated the chicken in the lemon juice overnight.Then I cubed the chicken, put a little oil in a pan, with some minced fresh garlic and pepper. Cooked the pasta in the chicken stock (yum) Then just added the cream, broccoli, and some more juice of the lemon.Next time I will add even more broccoli. It was great!! My husband loved it too.Totally making this dish again and again.

I used that is inspiration. I marinated the chicken breasts in Romano Basil dressing, salt and pepper and lemon pepper seasoning. I sauteed the chicken in olive oil with garlic. Then I made the sauce with lemon juice, half and half and chicken stock, adding cornstarch as needed to thicken and dried oregano and Italian seasoning. I roasted a pan of veggies (cherry tomatoes, broccoli, red and green bell peppers) and threw that in with the pasta and sauce and topped with grated Pamesan and fresh basil. So delicious! I had rave reviews all around! I used whole wheat pasta which helped the sauce stick.

My family isn't crazy about the flavor of lemon, so I used half the amount the recipe called for in both sections of the recipe (chicken and pasta), following the directions for cooking the chicken on the stove top.  The finished dish was still wonderfully flavorful and my 5 year olds even ate seconds!

I did make some changes to this recipe - as others did - but the thing I love about it is the cooking method for the pasta. If you make sure to keep the temp to a low simmer - it works amazingly well. It's not al-dente - but perfect for fettucini. I cook pasta like this quite a bit now, as I can put it on and do other things while dinner is getting ready. It's worth figuring the temperature and pasta out! As for the rest of it - sauteeing the chicken makes it faster, cut the lemon juice a tad and you can add onions and green peppers to the sauteeing chicken. I taste the sauce right before serving and if I happened to have gotten a sharper lemon flavor than I wanted add a pinch of sugar. Also you can change the falvors of this - I've done an asian version with pineapple juice, snowpeas and soy.

Yummy. Made several modifications based on the ingredients in my CSA box today and what I have on hand. My family is away so I tried making this for 1-2 people. Marinated 1 sliced organic, free range chix breast in several glugs of white wine, juice of 1 lemon, lemon pepper and 'lemon peel' from the spice aisle. Sauteed a large clove of organic garlic, 4 fresh, tiny, organic pearl onions in Pam. Added 1/2 c. each diced organic red peppers and mushrooms. Added the chix, wine etc. Sauteed for a few minutes. Added 1 c. or so of organic chix broth. Cooked for a few more minutes. Meanwhile, boiled off 1/2 pound of Orecchiette pasta. Drained. Added 2 glugs of half and half to the chix mixture. Added that to the drained pasta. Seasoned. Yum, yum yum!

This was pretty good. Although, I think it needed some color and a maybe a vegetable too. Next time I will use the tri-color rotini. Asparagus would probably taste good in this recipe or a variety of bell peppers. I would add a little salt next time too. Definately saute the chicken instead of baking, it's much quicker that way.

I thought this was great.  Like others, I sauteed the chicken with fresh garlic and pepper rather than baking it. I added some white wine to the chicken broth before cooking the pasta. At the end when I was stirring everything together, I tossed in a handful of parmesan (I only used about 1/3 cup of cream). This was a nice twist on the standard alfredo - it got nice and creamy even without a roux. Next time I'll experiment with adding mushrooms, red pepper, or whatever veggies I have on hand. Definitely a keeper!

I followed this recipe almost exactly and really liked the results.  I really love the fresh, clean flavor of the lemon.  The only thing I did differently was I cubed the chicken, seasoned it with salt and lemon pepper, sprinkled some lemon juice over it and then browned it in a pan.  I only gave it 4 stars rather than 5 because even though I used tri-color rotini, the dish still really begged for some color.  I think next time I will add some halved cherry tomatoes and maybe sprinkle some lemon basil over the top.

really really good pasta dish.  only thing is that the cooking time is about 10 minutes too long for the pasta.  i did add broccoli and also sauted the chicken with lots of garlic and didn't add garlic powder to sauce.

The lemon sauce is to die for!! I may consider adding a veggie of some sort next time (possibly asparagus)...great just the way it is though.

I followed parts of the recipe and parts of other reviewers comments.  I marinated the chiken and then sauteed it.  I didn't have any problems getting my noodles (I used Penne) to absorb the broth mixture although I wish I had.  The lemon flavor in the noodle is so bitter.  There was barely any "lemon cream" sauce to speak of so I added Cream of Mushroom (all I had) and a lot of fresh Parmesan Cheese.  I'm still not sure if I like it or not.  My 2 year old does, strangely.  We'll have to see what the man thinks when he gets home from work.

We liked this, but next time I'm going to use less lemon - it was a bit overpowering. The pasta was done before it soaked up all of the broth. I was afraid it'd be too dry if I drained all the juice off, and, as a result, it turned out almost like soup! I also added fresh broccoli. I'll probably give this another shot.

It was bland so drained the remaining juice from noodles. I cooked crushed pineapple with butter in pan, added yellow, and red peppers for color. Lemon juice and mixed in with cream and cream of celery and juice from pan .... nice!

I really liked this recipe.  Cut the chicken in cubes and marinated in lemon juice, garlic and pepper and then sauteed.  Followed the rest of the recipe exactly.  Wish the sauce was a little thicker but all in all I thought it was quite yummy !!

Good.  Just short of great -something missing...  Maybe next time I'll try it with some toasted pine nuts tossed on top?  Definately NOT light, as another reviewer commented, but a good, quick pasta.

I hate to go against the majority here, but this was awful.  It might be really good without the lemon, but with the lemon, it was just disgusting.  I won't be making this again...very disappointing.

I just made this recipe recently for my husband and myself. It is delicious, very easy to make, and was well-received. A couple of suggestions: to prevent an all-white dish, use colorful pasta and add vegetable like broccoli. Also, I would suggest marinating the chicken and then saut√©ing it or grilling it. The texture of the baked chicken wasn‚Äôt as good as it could have been. Otherwise, I will definitely be making this again!

The only reason I'm giving this 4 stars (instead of 5) is that mine turned out quite salty when I used 2 cans of regular chicken broth.  (and I like salty things generally, so if I say it was salty, it was!)  Next time I'll use a can of low-sodium broth, and a can of water.  I'll also add more garlic (and probably use fresh minced), because I really love garlic and it didn't have quite enough for my preferences.  I might try it with the yogurt/milk combination next time also, but it sure was good with the cream.  This is definitely a keeper; I'll be making it again.  Delicious.

This recipe was easy to make and created a fairly average chicken but a wonderful lemon pasta. Next time I will definitely add some veggies and perhaps use something to thicken up the sauce a bit. Overall this dish was very good.

This is sooo good.  Rarely do I find something that we all like, but this was good for both my husband and myself and both the kids.  This was like something I would order at a restaurant.  It didnt look so fantastic, because it was all white.. but this is great.

This was SO GOOD! Creamy, lemony but not too lemony, and completely divine.  I think next time I will add some chopped roma tomatoes and maybe even some artichoke hearts - this is such a nice change from your traditional cream sauce w/pasta recipe.

I'm not sure about this recipe is was quite good.  I found it reasonably lemony but no garlicy enough, I think it would benefit by using crushed garlic instead og garlic powder.

Very nice dish - we love lemon and have a whole tree of them so this was right up our alley.  I did saute the chicken on top of the stove with the lemon juice, more garlic and a little cajun seasoning.  Other than that, followed the recipe exactly.  Needed a little extra salt, but wonderful flavor and a new way to fix chicken.  Thank you Lisa!

Although I had some doubts while preparing this, it turned out very good. I thought the lemon and garlic were kind of strong, but when the cream was add it toned down the stronger flavors. I also prepared some garlic toast to serve on the side. If you like lemons, you'll love this.

Had to use an extra can of broth for cooking pasta.  Also added lemon pepper for extra flavor.  Was still a bit bland.  Needed veggies too.

Almost a bit too lemony...but very good! I'll just use a bit less next time. Would be great served with a veggie!
