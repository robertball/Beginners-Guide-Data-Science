This tastes really better than I expected! Everyone loved it. I used toasted walnut pieces instead of hazelnuts and it turned out great!

We were under-whelmed with this salad but I may try the recipe again because I don't think my apples were the best quality (not all that cruncy or crisp) altho I just purchased them that day for the salad. Also I purchased French Vanilla Cool Whip great for pie but perhaps not for the salad. I think the recipe should specify the type of apple or at least specify whether to use a tart or sweet apple. Next time I will use tart and maybe more dates.

I liked the idea that this recipe used dates rather than raisins. I liked it but my family wasn't crazy about it. They thought the dressing was a little off and didn't care for the dates.

I didn't have the whipped topping so I just added a little agave sweetner to the mayo & sour cream. I also added sweetened dried cranberries. (I know significant changes but I read the reviews...) We really liked the salad this way. And yes it is important to have crisp juicy apples. Mine were sweet.

Looks good but you lost me with the frozen whipped topping - I'll try sub suiting yoghurt and sour cream.
