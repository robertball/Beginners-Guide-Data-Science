These are delicious, but need a little work. Making only one batch in a twelve muffin pan is WAY too small and the cooking time is not long enough. I would recommend making two batches of twelve muffins, or one batch of muffins in the jumbo muffin pans, and cooking them for even as long as double the time. Also, definitely use the muffin liners because spraying the pan does not work well for these muffins. Other than that, these are amazing muffins! They taste great.

Used to put in Easter-goodies basket for my family and my future in-laws. Followed the recipe exactly. I did (2) 6-muffin batches in the normal sized muffin pans but next time I would do (3) batches. Also, I just guessed and used a box white cake mix because I was not sure what "all-purpose baking mix" meant. These turned out great. Everyone loved them. They were soft in the center and the streusel topping was yummy! Will definitely make these again.

One of the best muffins I've eaten or made!  They are extremely moist and just GOOD! :)  The only thing I didn't like about them is that they come out pink because of the cherry filling, otherwise they were fantastic!

I have made these twice and have loved them both times.  I did bake them for longer than listed.  Also the topping is a little heavy so the muffins tend to cave in a little, but they taste great. I will be making them again.
