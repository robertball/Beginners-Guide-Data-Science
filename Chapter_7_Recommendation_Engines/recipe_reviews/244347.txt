Weâ€™ve made this for many years! My moms recipe has Western dressing in it instead of the cream! Everyone loves it!

Love the simplicity! Out family has been making this since our grandmother passed down the recipe. 

Possible substitutions for the heavy cream: sour cream, more ketchup or BEER :o)

This was fine - nothing spectacular. Adding about 1/2 teaspoon each of garlic powder and onion powder added some flavor.
