For people who prefer not to use powdered milk or a bread machiene:

Use 1 and 1/4 cups milk.  Heat milk til scalding and add butter.  Set aside til lukewarm, add honey and sugar.  Proof yeast in mixture then add salt and cornmeal.  Gradually stir in flour and kneed for 8-10 minutes.  Cook in 350ยบ oven for 30-35 minutes.

Works great!  Thanks for the recipe.

This was a very good wheat bread. I had to add about 1/3c more flour.  I will reduce the sugar and  honey next time by half, as I found this bread a bit sweet for everyday use. I don't keep cornmeal in my pantry, so I used 1/4c of Red River (or sunny boy) whole grain cereal. I love hearty whole grain breads, and this is better than any other bread machine loaf I have made from my bread maker.  I did my last rise out of the machine, basted it with butter, and baked at 350f for 25 mins next time I will bake at 325f for at least 35 mins, as it was a bit under done, but the crust was quite dark.  I also made a second batch, and divided it into 12 dinner rolls and baked at 325f for 35 mins these turned out perfectly. Thanks for a great starter recipe!!!

This is great bread, very moist.  I enjoyed the corn meal crunchy crust but I usually make it without the corn meal and instead add more whole wheat.  My kids especially love it this way for their peanut butter and jelly sandwiches.  I feel great giving my kids such healthy bread!

This recipe was AWESOME.  I grind my own grain so I used freshly ground wheat and cornmeal; and what I came up with was a moist and delicious loaf. Thanks!!!!!

The best flavor of any whole wheat bread I've made. My 13 year-old daughter had a piece this morning, plain bread with nothing on it, and asked if I would make it again. That's pretty high praise. Thanks!

This recipe produces a great light textured wheat bread.  The corn meal gives added goodness to texture and taste.  I made a few minor substitutions such as using powdered buttermilk for regular powder milk, 2 cups of whole wheat flour plus 1 cup of bread flour.  My only problem was I used 3 teaspoons of dry yeast which was too much with the bread flour.

This is the best bread recipe I've ever tried, and it's good to know that healthy stuff is going into what we eat everyday. I substitute 1 of the TBSP of margarine for 3 TBSP of flaxseed to give it an extra boost of healthy stuff. Subbing more than 2 TBSP margarine for flaxseed results in a denser bread, so I wouldn't recommend that.

I loved this recipe!  I was a little worried about the 100% wheat flour not rising enough so I added about 1/2 tbsp of vital gluten.  I also ended up adding about 1/8 cup more flour to make the dough the right consistency.  Oh, and I mixed the dough on the dough setting of my bread machine, then put the dough in a 9 X 5 bread pan to rise and baked it at 375 degrees for about 30-35 minutes.  I think this was the best whole wheat bread I have ever made.  Thanks!

Delicious! I used 1 1/4 cup milk instead of the water and milk powder, and only a teaspoon of salt and no sugar. I made the dough in the bread machine and then formed them into 13 rolls. Let them rise after shaping in a warm place. I baked them at 325 degrees for about 18 minutes. I will definately make these again! *UPDATE: I made this recipe into a loaf and baked it for about 25 minutes. It's to die for! I also used 1 cup + 1 Tbsp milk and 3 Tbsp oil instead of the margarine  and water/milk powder this recipe calls for.

Mmm....wonderful! I like to play around with the ingredients a bit. Sometimes I add more cornmeal, throw in a quarter cup of oats, add a few tablespoons of wheat germ, or substitute the honey with molasses. This recipe is flavorful, versatile, and beautiful!

WOW. I just made this bread and it is so good. I used dark molasses in place of the honey and only 2 1/2 Tbsp lt. margarine (I used Smart Balance) and it turned out a beautiful, dark brown, robust flavored bread that rose up nice and high. The molasses gives it a really neat taste. THANKS for the recipe!!

I increased the serving size to 16 and made the recipe with my stand mixer.  I put it in two 8X4 inch pans and they turned out beautiful.  I like the smaller loaves for toast.  Beautiful recipe, will be making often.

I made a 2-lb loaf of this bread last night and most of it was already gone this morning.  This is a good, easy, flavorful bread with a nice texture.

I did decrease the honey almost by half and used a light margarine (Shedd's Spread) to save calories, and the bread was still good.

Delicious! I prefer to bake in oven, so I did dough cycle on breadmaker, baked oblong freeform loaf at 325 degrees for 30 minutes. So moist, chewy, and satisfying. I didn't add the 2 Tbsp. sugar, and it was still sweet enough.

Except for using milk in place of powdered milk and water, butter in place of margarine and Bob's Red Mill 7 grain hot cereal with flaxseed in place of cornmeal, followed the directions of this and Theinsanechef.  Allowed to rise quite some time and cooked at 325 - needed almost an hour to reach 190 degrees internally.  Thanks for sharing!

This is definitely a keeper! So tasty! Nice moist texture and easy to boot! I made it without the cornmeal since I didn't have it. Next time though, I'm going to try just one TB of sugar. I thought it was a tad too sweet for regular sandwich bread.

It didn't need so much sugar! next time i'll only use either the honey or the sugar. Also I think I will let it rise just a little bit because it didn't rise for me. On a good note it was really really moist! I will make this again.

I tried this recipe twice and both times the bread was super dense and didn't rise... It's not the yeast, I tested it. So, I can see that the taste is good, the cornmeal definitely adds a lot to it. But for me, super dense and then, very crumbly.

My first time baking a loaf of bread and it looked so beautiful coming out of the oven I was thrilled! It rose beautifully and after letting it cool I cut a piece and toasted it. It tasted as good as it looked with a satisfying slightly crunchy texture lent by the cornmeal. I was over the moon! That said for those of you like myself who will be oven baking your bread due to lack of a bread machine or pure preference (see review posted by theinsanechef for oven baking recipe changes) As well If you have a kitchen aid Mixer, use your doug hook and general baking directions that can be found at www.ehow.com (how to make doug with a Kitchen Aid Mixer); You'll want to bake it at a lower temp than the recipe calls for and for a little longer. I did 325F for 35 minutes as a previous poster had suggested lowering the temp (her bread was still raw in the middle as well but dark on the outside) and my bread was still a bit raw about a third of the way into the loaf. I would still do the 325F as it came out nice and brown, but I think it could use another 15 minutes. I'll try it and post my results.

Really good bread my whole family loved it and the whole wheat. I followed some other reviews and added 3 tbs of flaxseed and 2 tbs of butter. To add more nutrients I also added 3 tbs of oatmeal to the recipe. I soaked the oatmeal in water for 5 minutes and then drained it and added it. I also recommend putting the bread on 1.5 lbs loaf and not the 2 lbs because it is more moist. I will be making this bread every week. NO more store bought bread!!! Thank you.

I'm not sure what all the fuss is about over this recipe . . . the bread came out as described (a very dense whead bread with a bit of crunch from the cornmeal.)  Probably just not my family's cup of tea.  Too heavy for us.

This recipe turned out really well for me, I used my bread machine and let them rise for about 30 minutes and than baked at 325 for 17 minutes.  I did not think they were too sweet.  
I have been looking for a whole wheat roll recipe and this is definately a keeper.

I didn't use a bread machine, but did add a few more tablespoons of flour. It was great, texture and flavor.

This is Amy's new favorite: a piece of this toasted with butter tastes like Davenport Bakery whole wheat bread!  We made it the first time with proofed active dry yeast.  It makes a nice loaf in the bread machine that has the right density and size to cut for sandwiches.

It turned out quite dense, but that's what I expect with 100% whole wheat flour.

Deliciously soft, sweet and ever so crunchy (thanks to the cornmeal addition). I used the dough setting on my machine and then made the dough into rolls. Very pleasing for 100% whole wheat! I'll be keeping this recipe for sure.

This was the best whole wheat bread I have made (I'm new to bread making.) I left out the sugar.  It was moist but it was also very crumbly when I brought my sandwich to work (I had to eat it with a fork.)  I'll keep it as a breakfast bread and continue hunting for a sandwich bread.

Nice but too sweet.  The crust also got pretty tough pretty quickly.  I had to add over 1/2 cup more flour to make it more like dough than batter.  I did fluff the flour and sweep off the excess when measuring though so perhaps had less flour than really called for anyway?

Wonderful! It stays moist for several days in an airtight container. I didn't have regular milk powder so I used buttermilk powder instead and it tastes great! Everyone Loves This Bread!

I made this with oatmeal instead of cornmeal and about 1/3 to 1/2 C extra flour, half soy milk / half water and no milk powder, 1/4 C sugar and 2 T honey, and set the bread machine for a 2.5 lb sandwich loaf. Excellent! The whole family loved it.

This is my go-to wheat bread. Absolutely love how easy this is, and it turns out great EVERY time! Don't put the bread maker on wheat setting. Just don't do it... Love this recipe, use it all the time, exactly what i was looking for!

Incredible recipe! I changed some minor things about it to make it lighter and tastier:
1.Replace the water with milk and eliminate the powdered milk.
2.Cooked it as the picture shows: 6 good sized rolls, great for soup.
3.Replaced 1/3 of the whole wheat flour with bread flour.
4.Cook @350 for 33-35 mins.

Perfection!

This has become my favorite bread recipe and I make 2-3 loaves a week. I use dry buttermilk powder for the dried milk and substitute wheat germ for the corn meal. I also add 3-4 teaspoons of vital gluten. Excellent loaf!

Bread was low rising, which I expected, it lacked flavor and had a crumbly texture.  The recipe would probably work better with 1 1/4 tsp of salt, this will yield a slightly higher rise in the loaf (if you use the original recipe) as too much salt will kill the yeast. Adding 2 C. Whole Wheat flour and 1 cup white bread instead of the 3 Cups Whole Wheat flour will definately yeild a better loaf with less crumbling. 4 Tb of cornmeal was plenty for me. Adding the ingredients from the bottom of the recipe to top will also help keep the salt from direct contact with the yeast.

I made this last week and am making again today.  I left out the butter last week and it was still great.  Today I will make it according to recipe with the exception of decreasing honey to 1/4 c. Next time I plan to use part cornmeal and part ground oats.  Very yummy and almost sugarbuster legal.  Oh, also I use whole wheat pastry flour in the recipe.

First, the lazy instructions provided do not help make this bread better since whole wheat flour sometimes has to be treated differently than regular flour. Take this down! unless you provide with real instructions on how to make this!

This is a simple and delicious recipe for wheat bread.  I only used 1/2 Tbl of sugar and for the cornmeal I used a mixture of cornmeal, flax seed, and chia seed.  I also subbed 1/2 cup oatmeal in place of 1/2 cup of the flour.  It's a forgivable recipe that lets you add extras to your liking.

The bread did not rise well. I make bread regularly, and I prepared it in my bread machine. All my ingredients were fresh. I might try it again, just to see if it was a fluke. The texture was pretty good. Way too sweet, though. I will leave out the suger if I try it again.

I don't have a bread machine, so I did this in my mixer and baked in the oven.  I could have done something wrong in mixing the ingredients, but this bread didn't rise.  Very dense dough, but I like a dense bread.  Even when I baked it it didn't rise much at all.  I make bread all the time and have never had a problem with it rising, so I don't know what happened.   I am still giving this 4 stars because it probably would have turned out different with a bread machine.

My guess is the original recipe was made for lower altitudes where the flour amount is decreased. Living in Calgary, where the altitude is higher, I needed to use more flour. (About a third cup) I made this last week and the buns are gone so today I'm making a double batch! Beware, it may rise so high it will lift the lid of your breadmaker off! I am making them into buns again plus one loaf as my breadmaker does not do a good job on the baking side of things.   Thanks for this wonderful recipe. I love the addition of the cornmeal.

I loved this bread...adjusted, thanks to the reviewer who gave directions, because I don't have a bread machine.  I let my mixer mix for about 8 minutes, left out the cornmeal.  My family LOVED it!  The texture was amazing, too! Thanks!

This is a great recipe! I made a few changes to adjust to my own preference: I don't like sweet bread so I omitted the sugar, reduced the honey to 2 Tbsp and added 1/4 cup of flaxseeds. The cornmeal gives a really nice texture. I will definitely make this again.

One of the best wheat breads I've tried. A perfect, big loaf. Used less honey & sugar and it was still sweet. I always add Vital Wheat Gluten to my wheat breads. I've also figured out with my bm, I have to use the rapid yeast & the rapid cycle. Really nice loaf.

I used this recipe as the dough for some sweet rolls I made, and thought it worked pretty well. I liked the texture and flavor. Even with this being used as a base for sticky buns, you could still taste the honey. I made the dough by hand but had to use quite a bit more flour. I also added 1 1/2 t of gluten to make sure I got a good rise from the dough.

By the time I finally got to bake the loaf of bread, it no longer even remotely resembled the recipe.  I had to add gluten to it...1 tbsp.  I also had to add more flour.  It may have been due to the humid weather we have been experiencing. Without "real" directions, I had to make educated guesses and a lot of help came from all the other reviews.  I did not use a bread machine. I never had any luck with these. I just used my Kitchen Aid and oven.  The recipe had a lot of potential. It was indeed a very dense bread even with the gluten added. Also, it called for too much honey.  I left the sugar out and it still was VERY sweet.  I know you need some kind of sugar for the yeast but I think I could have gotten by with even less of the honey. The website needs to distinguish breads as either bread machine or oven baking.  I am going to try this again when our hot/humid summer is gone.  I have hopes for this recipe as I would very much like to steer away from the use of any white flour.

This is our new favorite bread recipe (and we eat a lot of bread!).  I have a bread machine but still make this into 8 mini-loaves or 12 muffins and it works great.  The cornmeal adds wonderful texture... even though I used applesauce instead of fat.  I serve this at dinner parties and everyone loves it!

Veganized it and baked in the oven. It was wonderful. 1.25 cup soymilk scalded. 3 Tbs Earth Balance melted in milk and Agave Nectar + sugar dissolved. Once 110 deg F was reached added yeast and let proof x 10 minutes. Mixed wheat flour, 3 Tbs vital wheat gluten (I like this to increase chewiness and rise), 1/4 c cornmeal. Stirred in as much of the flour mixture as possible and finished of the mixing/kneading part in the stand mixer with dough hook. Put in oiled bowl, covered x 1 hour. Formed into loaf shape, let rise x 1 hour again. Then Baked at 350 deg F for 35-40 minutes. It has this chew and crunch combination going on that is fantastic. Also, its a nice sweet treat with just a little Earth Balance. Thank you for the recipe!

We don't use powdered milk or margarine so I used milk and olive oil. That was all I changed.I used the whole wheat cycle on the bread machine. The loaf came out hard, dense and only 2,1/2" high. It's not my yeast; that is working perfectly on the loaves I regularly bake. I'll not be wasting freshly ground organic grain on this again.

This is the best whole wheat bread recipe that I've ever tried.  I made the dough in my bread machine and then made rolls with it. Also did not have corn meal and used oats instead. Very good.

This was a good whole wheat bread. I really liked the addition of cornmeal; it gave the loaf a satisfying "crunch." Out of personal preference, I skipped the sugar, and the finished loaf was definitely sweet enough without it. I did convert the recipe for  the oven, since I don't have a bread machine. Thanks for a tasty recipe!

I have made this recipe twice using the dough cycle and baking in oven. I did not change anything the first time and it turned out too sweet and did not rise very well. The second time, I omitted the sugar. That was the only change. I got a nice light fluffy loaf of 100% whole wheat bread. I did not add gluten flour to either loaves. I have been making whole wheat bread for my Granddaughter for two years and it's the only bread she likes. I  feel that adding half white flour or one cup of white flour defeats the purpose of making whole wheat bread. With two and 1/2 teaspoons of yeast in this recipe, it should rise very well. Those that add gluten have an even better chance to get a light fluffy loaf without adding white flour. It is my understanding that white flour turns to sugar in your body, who wants that? Thanks for the recipe, it's a keeper.

If I could give it an extra star, I would!  This is the best whole wheat recipe for a bread machine that I have found.  It was fluffy, moist and had awesome flavor.  Definitely a keeper!

10/08 I had to add another note.  I was making this one night (without my glasses) and accidentally used oatmeal instead of cornmeal and it turned out just as good.  Some times I even split up the two and do half oatmeal and half cornmeal.  We LOVE this recipe!

This bread was fantastic!  I followed the instructions with one exception, I used corn syrup instead of honey.  We're just not big honey people at our house.  It rose well, it looks lovely, and it has a wonderful whole wheat flavor.  We will definitely have this again our house.  Thank you!

What a great recipe!  This is the only wheat bread my family will eat now.  I added oatmeal instead of the cornmeal because my family has a texture thing.  The only problem I had is that I like to slice the bread and then freeze it.  When I thaw a piece out it tends to fall apart.  Someone suggested adding gluten.  Any suggestions?  If I need to add gluten, how much?  Thanks for any input.

This bread turned out great,although a bit sweet for my taste.  Next time I will try leaving out the sugar.  I used my bread machine to make a dough and then allowed it to rise & baked at 350 for 25 minutes.

This tastes good, and that counts for a lot.  You can really taste the honey.  However, at least in my bread machine (with fresh yeast), the loaf came out small, dense and underbaked.  Make sure to put your machine on the darkest crust setting.  I really enjoyed it but it looked like a bump on a log!

This makes a very good whole wheat bread, even without a bread machine. I kneaded for the standard 8-10 minutes, and I had to add a bit more flour than the recipe called for (about 1/4 c. I guess, and for the extra I used all purpose white). I also used about 1/4 c. gluten to help it rise. I let it rise three times, and I baked it for 35 minutes at 375 F.

This is a great basic recipe.  My two-year old loves it with cream cheese or for making grilled cheese.  I do have to add quite a bit more flour, though.  I slice it as soon as it's cool and keep it in a gallon-size zipper bag in the fridge.

For now I'm giving this three stars.  The lack of manual  instructions is frustrating, especially for those of us who don't want to use a bm.  Thanks to the user who posted non-bm instructions!  The flavor is ok, but a tad sweeter than what I wanted.  My bread didn't rise at all, but I think that is probably my fault: I only had 2.25 tsp of yeast, and I didn't let the dough rise after kneading.  I will be trying this again, though!

I love to slice this thin, and then toast it on the dark setting.  The cornmeal really stand out then, and makes a great crunchy, satisfying piece of toast.

I've never had much luck getting whole wheat bread to turn out like fluffy sandwich bread, but this one did great.  I substituted in a cup of bread flour the first time, and half cup the second time- I had to let it rise a little longer the second time, but it still turned out light.  Also I always use wheat gluten and dough enhancer with my whole wheat flour.  I used the wheat dough cycle on my bread machine, then let it rise in a bread pan and baked at 350 for 30-35 minutes.  It turned out great!  I like the sweet flavor.  I didn't have any honey, so I just used sugar.  This is my new standard bread recipe.

I have been making bread for over 20 years, the last 10 with a bread machine.  I LOVED this recipe.  It turned out a perfect loaf, had a wonderful texture and was very moist.  Highly recommend it.  Think I will try putting cornmeal in some of my other recipes.

Good wheat bread. The bread was very dense and heavy. The taste has a nice light honey taste. When toasted the crust has a nice crunch. My son liked this bread alot. I thought is was a litte heavy, but the taste was very nice. I may try to lighten this loaf up a bit.

This was a good recipe.  I probably wouldn't make it again though.  For some reason I didn't like the cornmeal element.  I made this by hand, with advice from another reviewer.  This a good recipe to try out because it doesn't use up much of your ingredients if you happen not to like it.

Perfect height with a beautiful texture. Couldn't really notice the cornmeal but there was a strong honey taste. I will make this again but probably add some flax and sunflower seeds to make it a bit more interesting.

It does have a dark crust but it just shows you are eating well! I really liked the crunch from the corn meal however it dries out pretty fast.

After a dismal failure at a whole grain recipe, I came searching and found this one.  It turned out great!  My only modifications were to decrease the cornmeal to 1/8 c and add 1/8 c oat bran.  Also, I added 1 TBS gluten flour for each cup of wheat flour.  This I could probably decrease next time.  But!   A really yummy, easy recipe!  Thank you!

This recipe was fantastic.  We are trapped by a winter storm in NC and I did not have all the ingredients.  I substituted maple syrup for honey and old fashioned oats for the cornmeal and it still turned out wonderful.  Thanks for this foolproof recipe!

The fuss for me is the fact that, of all the wheat, white, whatever bread machine recipes I've tried, this is the only one that didn't end up like flavored lead. It made a truly perfect loaf. I substituted one cup of white bread flour for wheat, and had to add an additional quarter to third cup during kneading to get the right dough consistency.

Awesome bread, very easy to make. I did it by hand though just as instructed by insanechef. Next time for a more sandwich type iโll Reduce honey and add oats and some additional grains for topping. But def no more store bought bread

This bread is a keeper -- it is perfect for sandwiches and for toasting! Due to the many comments indicating that the recipe produces a bread that is too sweet, I omitted the sugar and reduced the honey to 1/4 cup. This change makes a slightly sweet bread, which is what my family prefers. This 100% whole grain bread is soft, light and moist -- bakery quality, definitely! I will continue to make this for my family.

This recipe was totally useless to me. I'd love to be able to make  whole wheat rolls that look like the ones pictured. I do a lot of baking.  But this recipe then stops dead after the ingredients list, and its only instructions (re mixing, kneading, rising, etc.) are all summed up in two words "press start". Which is totally dopey.  Does the author of this recipe think that bread machines are universal? Far from it, and frankly I'd never have one! Get real! Bob Bridge, Ensenada Mexico

I had high hopes for this bread after reading so many of other users reviews.  I added 2 tsp of gluten flour (couldn't find vital wheat gluten), upped the yeast to 2 3/4 tsp.  But still, the bread came out dense, hard and flavorless.  It seemed to rise until the punch down in the bread machine, then it never rose again.

I absolutely loved this recipe.  You could easily reduce the honey, as it is quite sweet for everyday bread.  My 8 year old, however, did not like the cornmeal texture.  I have also made it with oatmeal and molasses instead of honey and cornmeal.  Add some gluten (available at health food stores) for more rise and more protein.

Do not use whole wheat "graham" flour in this recipe.  It won't rise.  You must use a finely ground whole wheat, or you must use a mixture of white and wheat.  I used graham (knowing what would happen, sigh) and added a little extra yeast in an attempt to compensate -- nope.  It's been almost 24 hours and it's not rising.  In other recipes where I used a combination of white and wheat I didn't have this problem.

I rated it only 4 stars because the crunch from the cornmeal wasn't as present as I had hoped, and the loaf turned out rather heavy (but it wasn't a dealbreaker because I was after a seriously hearty toasting bread).  I am not a fan of sweet breads, and this one was not overpowering (just on the edge).  A good recipe, I will try it again, maybe cutting the whole wheat flour with some white flour to lighten the loaf.

This is the most delicious whole wheat bread I have made. I followed "theInsaneChef" and also did not use the bread machine. I used the Kitchen Aide and let it rise twice and then baked in the oven 350 degrees for 35 minutes. I will try adding flax seed next time.

I followed the recipe exactly, but result was very heavy, dense, small loaf.  I proofed the yeast so I know that was not the issue.  Smelled and tasted great, just very heavy.  Will try again, maybe add some vital wheat gluten to lighten it up.

This bread was excellent!  I used the KitchenAid and oven method.  I scalded the milk, added the butter, then let it sit until it reached 110 degrees. Then added to the yeast to the mixing bowl and let it set for about 8 minutes until frothy, adding the remaining ingredients (salt last). I did add ground flax and an oatmeal/barley mixture. I will use olive oil next in place of the butter.

I did not get to make this as I would have liked to (had some trouble with the bread machine and yeast measurement) but I think it came out pretty much like it should have. I would not make it again so I won't ever know. I just don't think I like using  whole wheat flour for the whole thing, I would prefer half regular half whole wheat.

This bread is super-easy to make and has a delicious nutty-crunchy texture.  The only unfortunate thing is that, like all homemade breads, it gets stale quickly.  Plan to eat it in within 2-3 days.  It's wonderful when sliced, drizzled with honey, and eaten while still warm.  Mmmmmm...
