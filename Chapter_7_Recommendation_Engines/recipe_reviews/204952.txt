Fabulous! This a wonderful marinade for grilled chicken. I loved the idea of using fresh citrus juice! I did add some minced garlic - the equivalent of about one clove just for good measure. I pounded the chicken down thin as instructed and poked it with a fork. I put everything into a ziploc bag and let it go for 8 hours. It smelled great and tasted even better. It's sweet, yet has just a mild kick with nice citrus flavor. Plus the chicken has a beautiful color to it. And, as the submitter suggested I served it with warm tortillas, homemade salsa, guacamole, and warm black beans topped with a dollup of sour cream for a Southwestern flair. What's great about this recipe is you could easily take this and add some cumin and curry (1/4 tsp. each) to the marinade then serve with couscous to give a Middle Eastern flair. This is a definite keeper!

This was everything we expected it to be as it was yummiliciously citrusy and quite flavourful. However, this isn't too great to eat on its own (according to me), and would do justice if added to salads, or served on tortillas with salsa. Whilst I'll keep that in mind next time, I think I will also add some chopped cilantro to the marinade....and perhaps allow the chicken to sit in the marinade overnight. Nevertheless, good recipe. :) Thanks Osider760!

I'm always on the lookout for easy grilled chicken recipes and this one is just right. Made this tonight for the first time, LOVED it! Served with grilled sweet potatoes and a tossed salad w/Balsamic vinaigrette. The dinner was just perfect for Florida summers, and it WAS better than El Pollo Loco, as another reviewer mentioned. I'll definitely use it for a taco filling with just some cilantro, jalapeño, onion and queso fresco. Yum! Hubby suggested the marinade would make a great reduction, and I agree. And such a versatile jumping-off recipe - it could work well with a little pineapple juice or extra honey to give it an island flair. I halved the recipe for 3 people, omitted the coriander (didn't have any) and used full amount of red pepper for kick. Biggest surprise - we could taste each citrus component. LOVE THIS RECIPE! Call me goofy, but I think it would make superb fish tacos, too.

Made this for the Recipe Group. Good strong citrus flavor.  I left out the honey as I didn't see the need for extra sweet and didn't baste.  If I had had some fresh coriander I think that would have been better as the coriander powder didn't seem to add much.  I'm always throwing garlic in grilled chicken marinades, so it was good to be restrained by the recipe.  It had a nice clean, fresh taste.

I was surprised, but I did like this.  I served it with a baked potato.  The citrus flavors was a refreshing change for a bbq chicken.

This is so far the best marinated grilled chicken I have made!  Love all the citrus flavors, so refreshing.  Went perfect sliced up on a nice big salad :)

Made this for the Recipe Group:  26, March '11.  Loved this citrus flavored chicken.  We had it hot the first night, right off the girll and it was very good.  I really enjoyed it the next day cold and chopped on a salad.  My husband reheated it for dinner and commented that he thought the citrus flavors came through even stronger than the first night.  This was marinated for about 10 hours.  Not sure what coriander is - but could only find whole coriander.  I just broke/smashed it up with the back of a spoon.  This will be great to use during the summer months and definitely worth putting in your recipe box.  Thanks Osider760 for sharing.

We really enjoyed this.  I marinated my chicken for over 24 hours due to a change in plans so I was a little worried, but it was fine.  I didn't baste because I was afraid I had saturated the meat so I cooked the remaining marinade down and drizzled it over the cooked chicken.  The balance of flavors was spot on crisp and clean.  Thanks for a nice change of pace.

Made this for the Recipe Group, what a burst of citrus flavour! I marinated the chicken about 3 hours, and because of the dang cold and snow here, I ended up broiling the chicken instead of BBQ'ing but it still turned out fabulous.  The chicken was moist and very flavourful and I loved the hit of the red pepper flakes.  I didn't have any oranges but I did have a grapefruit and used one half of it along with the lemon/lime.  I will definitely make this again...

I made this recipe a while back for the recipe group. It was good, but the citrus was a bit much for my taste. I used the leftovers in salads, which was better. Hubby really enjoyed it, though. Thanks for sharing!

I like this chicken as it gives fajitas a nice change.  Will be making again, but will probably add just a smidge more red pepper flakes.  Thank you for sharing!

WOW!  This will be a now be a regular. 

Made 1/2 recipe and had more than enough for marinade and basting.

I  marinated for 4 hours in plastic bag in refrigerator, then allowed it to come to room temp for 1'2 hour before grilling.  Also let is set for 15 min after grilling.  

Thanks for the recipe.

This is a tasty and easy recipe. I added more pepper and chili flakes for more spice. A great compliment with all the citrus. Enjoyed feeding this "Charger Chicken" to my Raider Fan husband. Oh...he loved it!

This was good as a base but was not to our liking on its own. We kept saying it needs some kind of sauce to help balance the citrus. I may make it again but definitely would add a sauce.

I enjoyed this and yes it is very citrus-y. I didn't have wildflower honey, so I used clover honey. I agree for me it needs just a tad more heat so next time I'll add a bit more

I didn't care for the chicken too much but my hubby loved it. I told him to not expect it again, but if you are really into citrus you should really like it. Just not my personal favorite! Worth a try!! Thank you.

Not nearly enough olive oil to balance the citrus in this marinade. It was like eating a sour patch on steroids.

Very good chicken recipe! I made it without the lime, and I browned it on the stove then baked it, rather than grilling it, and it turned out great. Definitely want to make this again .

This is a good marinade for boneless chicken cutlets. I wanted to give it more stars but it lacked that  wow factor. It is a good basic citrus marinade. I served it with Spanish yellow rice , black beans and sautéed red peppers and onions.  A side of sliced avacado completed the meal.

A lot of work that lack much flavor. Sorry. I really wanted to like it. We don't have a grill, so I used my indoor one - maybe that's why?

This was pretty good.  My only mistake was forgetting to make it ahead of time, so I could only really coat it in the marinade (also forgot to set some aside to baste with).  Next time I will plan ahead a little better.  Other than that, didn't change a thing.

I made this and it was delicious.  I did not brush the chicken with the reserved marinade i sliced the chicken and put it in flour tortillas  and put some of the marinade on chicken before i added some mango salsa.  yummo! next time i may add some dark rum to the marinade.

Made it exactly as the recipe states.  It was tangy and delicious.  As a plus i used the leftovers to make a delicious chicken salad.  Will definitely make it again and be sure to have "planned overs:, yum!

Loved the citrus flavor.  Made it exactly per the recipe but marinated it overnight.  Added the barbecued chicken sliced to a lemon fusilli dish so it paired very nicely with the lemon pasta dish.  Will certainly make  it again to put over salad.

I knew as soon as I saw this recipe that it was going to be very good. It certainly didn't disappoint! It was delicious, and will be made many more times! I loved the citrus flavor with the chicken. I followed the marinade recipe as directed. I would add more red pepper flakes the next time I make this. I noticed a very small "kick" from the amount of red pepper used in recipe, but I'd like more. I don't eat food that is too spicy/hot, but I do like to notice that the red pepper is there. One cook recommend pounding the chicken breasts to make them thinner. Instead of that I used a thinner cutlet. It was great for cutting down the cooking time, but next time I will use a full size chicken breast.  Excellent recipe! Thank you for sharing!

Yummmm.  I accidentally bought only half of the ingredients for the citrus, so I halved the chicken and marinated the rest in a store bought sausage fusion dressing.  Due to time constraints I pan broiled the chicken and served it with Fried Rice-a-Roni  and frozen stir fry veggies.  A good dinner!

Tasty flavor but not overwhelming.  I almost didn't pound the chicken but I'm glad I did.  Served with guacamole, but some family members ate it with a sweet barbeque sauce.

Very good.  I made mine with via Sous Vide and did a very hot sear on the grill.  It was spectacular and very juicy.  

If you Sous Vide this, you can cut back on the zest.  It may overpower the rest of the flavors and add more bitterness.

This was really good! However I did add cilantro and garlic powder to the marinade, so that may alter the true recipe. It probably would not have been as good without it.

I hate to rate recipes when I make changes. However, due to good allergies I used mango / pineapple juice in place of orange. It was great!  The taste was bright and was moist. 
Will definitely try again

The marinade sounded, and is, good so I decided to try the recipe.
Followed recipe as written.  Not impressed with the results.  Will try again with longer marinate time and maybe use the vacuum sealer attachment on the Food Saver.  If going to use for tacos or salad I will try slicing  to serving sizes then marinating.

I marinated the chicken for about 4 hours.  The citrus flavor permeated the chicken but was not very strong. If I made it again I would increase the time to gain a stronger citrus taste.  A good but average week night dinner.

I prepared to batches of this today.  Round one prepared as written except I used local Avocado Honey.  

Round two, I HAD to add fresh garlic and lots of it in the marinade and also for grilling.  

My group liked both but the garlic version went first - as we are all big garlic lovers.  

Overall a great easy grilling recipe - and being in So. CA, we grill all year long.  Thanks for sharing.

Really good and flavorful - different taste for chicken (citrusy), at least for our kitchen.  Really easy. Had one piece left that made great sandwich the next day.

I loved the concept of this recipe! I read some of the reviews and also added garlic, cilantro and a little balsamic vinegrette for some extra kick. It really made the chicken pop! It was also very juicy! The whole family loved it!

This is remarkably similar to a marinade/BBQ baste I have used many times for salmon filets. The 3 fresh citrus zest and juices with a little garlic and honey is a great combo.  Looking forward to trying with chicken as the submitter suggests.

I did not use red pepper flakes and coriander but all the rest
and it was a wonderfull marinade. The meat was very tasty. My 12 years old daugther asked me to make it again soon !
It had really a great taste.

We love citrus with chicken, but, the orange seemed overwhelming to me and I didn't get a lot of the other flavors coming through.  It also seemed a little sweet - probably the combination of the orange juice and the honey.  I would have liked more of the lemon and lime juic coming through.   I do agree with another reviewer that on it's own I wasn't a big fan of this chicken, but, I ate it on a salad the next day and it was very good.
