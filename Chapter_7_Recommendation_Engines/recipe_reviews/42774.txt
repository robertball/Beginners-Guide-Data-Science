GREAT BASIC RECIPE, JUST A FEW CLARYFICATIONS NEEDED...  You may be wondering if the cheddar cheese should be melted or grated or chunked... well, I've tried it all 3 ways... grated is fine, just increase the butter by 1/2 cup and increase the salt by 1/2 teaspoon, at least.  You can tweek this recipe as you please as far as pepper, garlic salt, add'l seasonings, etc., add hot water or more melted butter to make it pliable.  I've done this cutting it, like it reads, and also, by rolling balls and crushing them with a glass to flatten.  The skys the limit as far as flavorings...  I perfected this to use in my Christmas Baskets this year.  In a vaccuumed package, these crackers will last a month or more...  don't be afraid to wet the dough, until your comfortable with it, thats the key.  Happy Snacking!!

Years ago when I pregnant with my youngest daughter, my doctor had just informed me that I had yet another "toes first" baby and that I was going to have a scheduled C-section again. With that, he handed me a sort of cheddar cracker. I could taste the cayenne and something crispy. I loved them and have been searching for a similar recipe since. I found this purely by accident yesterday and although some of the reviews were less than favorable, I decided to give them a try. Not that this is going to be of much help because I didn't measure anything, however, you experienced cooks out there will know what I mean. I used whatever shredded cheddar I had left over and put it in the food processor. I added my butter, a lot more cayenne than called for, some seasonings and about a third cup of flour. I pulsed and kept adding flour, a little at a time until it looked right. The dough was nice and moist and easy to handle. I also folded in a single serving of rice crispy's. I made them more like quarters and baked for about forty minutes. They were excellent and very much like what I had eaten in Dr. Cohen's office. Thanks Adrienne for a really good start and for the extra five pounds I probably gained yesterday munching on these little goodies. The kids and hubby loved them too!

Very good!! Not what I expected though, these are not like crackers you purchase in the store. I used my hands to knead the dough so it would form a ball. I made mine the size of 50-cent pieces and baked them for 20 minutes.  I used cajin spice since I didn't have any white pepper.  I also cut the slices,placed them on the cookie sheet, then used a small cookie cutter to make "cracker people".  Next time I will add bacon-bits.  I will use this recipe again! Yum-Yum!! OK, I added real bacon bits and they turned out fantastic! I entered them in our State Fair and won 1st place! I cut them out with a "doughnut holer" but I didn't roll them very thin.  I love to snack on these!!

These pennies are good.  Mine were pretty crumbly but had a big cheese taste.  My son didn't care for them, but that was a while back.  Maybe I'll give them another try in the future...see if he's changed his mind.  Thanks Adrienne.

Very crumbly.  There was no way that these were going to roll into logs.  I rolled them in hand and pressed them into rounds.  I didn't see any need to grease a baking sheet, as these are heavy in butter and the fat in the cheese.  I rated them well overall, though.  Very tasty!  They taste great with garlic and onion powder mixed in.

After reading the reviews, I made my own version of these crackers.  They turned out very well- a little spicy, and nice and cheesy.  Here's what I did: Blend 1 cup all purpose flour, 1/4 t garlic powder, 1/4 t paprika, 1/8 t cayenne pepper, and 1/2 teaspoon seasoned salt in food processor.  Add 1/4 cup cold butter that has been cut into little cubes.  Pulse until the butter is well incorporated and the mixture looks like crumbs (you may need to scrape the sides of the bowl with a spatula).  Add 6 ounces shredded cheddar cheese and process until the cheese is blended in, scraping with the spatula if necessary.  Dump the mixture into a mixing bowl and add about 1 tablespoon of milk.  Mix it in with your hands and add more milk (1/2 tablespoon or so at a time) until the dough just comes together.  Then roll the dough into marble sized balls, put on a baking sheet, and flatten with the bottom of a glass.  You an experiment with different thicknesses.  Poke each cracker with a fork a couple times so they don't poof up when being baked.  Sprinkle each cracker with a little kosher salt and press the salt in.  Bake at 350 for about 15 minutes (depending on the thickness of your crackers), until the bottoms are a little toasted. Excess dough can be put in the fridge until it's time to bake, or if you accidentally add too much milk refrigerating the dough will make it easier to work with.  Enjoy!

I'm a grown up but I thought this was a fun recipe to make and tasted good to eat.  I would suggest that for older kids and adults you might want to increase the salt and cayenne pepper a bit or experiment with other seasonings.

As suggested by another reviewer, I ended up just breaking pieces of dough and kind of flattening out to the shape of a penny.  I added water to the dough, because I had a crumbly mess with just the butter.  That probably messed up the dough by doing that, but just the melted butter did not work.  I was the only one in the house that did not care for these, and part of that may have been frustration.  They're not terrible, and if you have a lot of patience these may work for you, but I doubt I will make these again.  Sorry.

Tasted like Cheez-its, but not as good.  Was more like a meal than a dough, and would not form logs without much handling.  Maybe more spices, very sharp cheddar, and adding a bit of water to make more doughlike.  They look cute.

Made these exactly as directed.  My dough was super crumbly so I added hot water and it took about 1/2 C to get it to stick together.  Baked for 23 min and they weren't very crispy so I added 5 more min.  I didn't want to burn them so I took them out.  We tried them but found them to be bland so I tossed them with a bit of garlic salt and they were much better.   To me this was alot of butter with no reward.  If a recipe calls for a stick of butter I am expecting indulgent...this just didn't have that.

I read the reviews BEFORE making the recipe, so I did as follows: 1 and 1/2 sticks butter, added 2T water, cut flour to 1 and 3/4 cups.  My kids absolutely LOVE these, but I have to say for my taste they are pretty bland.  Cooked up fine, but the flour taste is a bit overwhelming.  Next time I will try to add a pinch of garlic salt or some kind of seasoning to drown the flour taste - the additional water was necessary to keep the dough together, so I would definately add that step to the recipe.  Good basis to start off with, though.  Thanks for the recipe, am anxious to put my own spin on it - the kids are gobbling them up like they're chocolate!  =)

YUMMY! This made a WONDERFUL recipe for my VERY picky Kiddos. We made this to go along with the Labor Day theme!  I would suggest however, cutting the flour down to 1 3/4 cup, using 1 and a 1/2 sticks of butter melted, and adding 2 T. of water to the mixture otherwise it is too dry.

I wasn't very impressed either...I tried to cut the recipe in half so maybe that was part of the problem.  But it was way too dry without the added water and not as tasty as I thought they would be.  Like other reviewers suggested, adding other spices probably would have helped.  Thanks for sharing, though.

The dough was a little too dry, I agree that it didn't want to roll up into a log and am not sure refridgeration would have helped.  I think next time I will use a lot more cheese and up the pepper.

Kind of boring and a lot of work.  They didn't work with just the melted butter so I put them in the food processor and added water until it was a workable dough.  I also used whole wheat flour.  I doubt I'll bother trying again.  Sorry.

I don't know if mine turned out like the recipe called for.  They sort of reminded me of little mini cheddar biscuits.  Like others, I found that my dough was really just a bunch of crumbs when I finished, so I added some hot water, which helped everything come together.  Also like others, I could not "slice" this dough to save my life.  So I just rolled small balls and thumb pressed them.  These were ok, and I'll eat them, but they weren't compelling enough to make again.

These came out more like a shortbread cookie than a crunchy cracker.  It was a bit dry for me.  I used 1/2t cayenne and it was WAY TOO much.

I had a little bit of an issue making the dough firm. When I used the butter according to the recipe, the dough was very crumbly. I added another 1/4 C melted butter and it worked fine. Also, it says to chill it if necessary...and it was! What I ended up doing was spliting the dough in half, popping it in the freezer for a few minutes, and then taking it out, wrapping each half in plastic wrap, popped it in again for a few more minutes, and then pulled each one out and rolled it into a penny roll that way. It worked out great. Once they were rolled, I popped them in again for a few minutes to chill, then cut as directed. They baked great, are slightly crumbly, but still really good!

YUMMMMMMMMMMMMM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  these were so good!  true, it was difficult to get the dough to work, but i just kept adding milk until it was ok.  you don't even have to roll them into logs, you can just flatten them.  wow, i'm definately making these again, and i'm making a double batch!

This recipe was simple to make, but unfortunately we were disappointed with the results.  We added extra salt, cayenne, and sharp cheddar cheese as well as garlic powder.  Dispite all of the additions, the pennies were bland as could be.  All we could taste was flour.  We were really excited to try this recipe out, but we will not make it again.  Thanks for sharing and sorry for the poor review.

These were really easy to make and tasted fantastic.
Home made cheese pennys are so worth the effort.
But I made a few adjustments to the recipe , since I am Mediterranean I added , paprika, feta cheese and a couple of different cheddars, I also added a bit of spices and herbs to make them really tasty.

I tried just adding half a stick of butter but it was too crumbly, so i took other reviewers suggestions and added 1 stick of butter. However, it was still a little crumbly, so i add milk till it was right, and it turned out DELICIOUS!

Dough was dry and bland.  A good starter recipe which needs some work.

Yes, these are delicious after you spend another 40 minutes fixing them. If you get lucky.

I've made these a few times and it impresses my guest that I've taken the time to make crackers. These are better than what you can buy.

These were pretty good. I put in Chili Powder instead of Cayenne.  It turned out real well.

I was looking for a kid-friendly snack recipe, and this was IT! The littles all helped to knead the dough (I used grated cheese, and added an additional 1/2 stick of butter, as the dough was way too crumbly to work with without the addition of the extra butter) and roll them out. The kids had fun with these, and they were delish as well! Next time, I'll use dill, instead of the cayenne.

Tasty. Like most I found this recipe to be to dry to form rolls and in need of more cayenne pepper.  I will try it again using less flour and a little water.  I pressed the dough out on the counter like making scratch biscuits and used a melon scooper to create quarter size coin.   Also using extra sharp cheese makes for better cheese flavor.

After reading the reviews I cut down on the flour to 1 3/4 cups and also added garlic salt.  Pretty good.

Fantastic recipe! I added a bit more salt (about a 1/2 tsp) and about the same amount of Mrs Dash's Table blend to the dough. They tasted just like Gold Fish!!!

Really easy to make, they get scooped up fast. Great bite sized snacks. Nice to serve alongside mixed nuts and olives at a cocktail party.

I have tried 2 times to make these.  The recipe sounds delicious but I think that there must be something that I am doing wrong.  So, my rating is as much on myself as the recipe.  They are too crumbly when I make them and I have tried to add more butter and even water to make them easier to handle.

I just finished making my first batch and they're great. However, I goofed when I went shopping and picked up the wrong cheese (Mexican mix instead of Chedder). I used the Mexican Mix and omitted the cayenne. Next time, I'll try it with chedder. As for now, I just hope they last til Easter :-)

Very close to my grandmother’s recipe. I added chopped rosemary, cayenne and Worchestshire sauce. I would suggest starting with 1.5cups of flour and adding more as needed. Also I just pinched small bits of dough off and rolled them into balls that I flattened on the cookie sheet, as the dough I ended up with was too dry for rolling into a log. Finally I would use parchment paper or silpat instead of greasing the cookie pan, there’s enough butter in the recipe that you don’t need to take that step.
