This was simple to make & tastes delicious!  It's hard to find a good Jerusalem artichoke recipe  (esp. one that doesn't require peeling).  I substituted non-dairy organic cream-based sauce base for the cream + vegetable stock for both the butter & the chicken stock, to make a vegan version -- turned out great!

Pretty good recipe! I caramelized the onions until they were light brown and tossed in a couple of cloves of garlic when adding the potatoes and artichokes. I thought this added some nice depth.

This soup is delicious. I had no brandy, but added several garlic cloves, also a touch of nutmeg.  I used my immersion blender to puree.

Wonderful recipe. I love making soups and even though I had never tried Jerusalem Artichokes before, it sounded interesting. It was easy to make and delicious. I will definately make it again.

Not sure if I did something wrong, but I found that the Jerusalem artichokes did not soften enough to puree smoothly - I even simmered them for an additional 20 min before trying to puree them.  The texture was too rough for a cream soup and unfortunately, this kind of ruined the soup experience for me.  Outside of the texture - the taste was good - different but good.

I used shallots instead of onions, yogurt instead of cream and left out the brandy. A wonderfully delicate flavor, and very easy too!

Wow, my family loved this soup.  I made it less rich by using 2 tbs butter instead of 1/4 cup and whole milk instead of cream.  I used vegetable broth, and dry sherry instead of brandy.  I also added 2 garlic cloves as suggested.  We found it to be creamy, hearty and filling with a slightly smokey flavor from the sunchokes.

A classy soup. I used cognac instead of brandy ans skim milk instead of cream to cut the fat, and it was still very rich.

Our family loves this soup!  I don't use the cream, flour or brandy, but I do add garlic.  We top it with shaved parmesan cheese and it's delicious!

This was delicious.  Though  my kids weren't fans.  I did add garlic to it.  And put Parmesan on it at the end.  It was a very homey/earthy soup.  Oh and if you want more flavor or spice--red pepper is good with it.

I made this delicious soup for the first time yesterday.  It was amazing!  My whole family absolutely loved it!  I did quadruple the recipe though, so it took a lot longer for everything to cook, of course.  We added some smoke paprika. It is also pretty rich, but delicious!  Oh!  And I sauted the onions before I put them (saw that someone else on here did that, and thought it was a great idea...although I don't think it really made that much difference because of how you cook the potatoes and artichoke in the butter).

I tried this recipe - but it came out too bland and the cooking time needs to be doubled. The artichokes came out way under cooked. 

I recommend cooking at low for at least 20 minutes, followed by 4 minutes, then 10 minutes at the end. This was to make sure that the Jerusalem Artichoke cooked through. 

Also I added spices  - oregano, marjoram, thyme - which is sorely missing in this recipe. If I had known, I would have followed another recipe that included using Bay leaf. 

In the end I had to add way more pepper, salt, unsalted butter, and some soy sauce to get any flavor. The parsley was a nice addition and my husband thought it was fine, but I was really disappointed.

I would have like a little more artichoke taste.  I did use the pound of Artichokes that was suggested.

This recipe needed a lot of added seasoning after the cook that in retrospect I would have wanted to add while cooking the potatoes and sunchokes.  I used fresh nutmeg while cooking the potatoes and chokes, added Essence, ground Rosemary, cayenne, poultry seasoning after the cream.   I also added some leftover ham prior to puréeing and more finely diced after puréeing.  Sunchokes have a sweet flavor and the purée was a little gritty, but a tasty way to use an obscure produce.  Be prepared to cook your chokes and potatoes longer than the recipe calls for. I cooked them covered for about 12 minutes and uncovered for another 12.

This is a full safe recipe.  Whether you use less butter, don't use exact amounts or decide not to blend the soup one still ends up with a delicious meal.  Lovely.  I considered using some macadamian nut oil and less butter but will try this next time.

This is absolutely delicious. I omitted brandy and only used whole milk, instead of heavy cream. 
Some review mentioned that the taste a little bit bland, which I disagree. I really enjoy the hearty and subtle taste of Jerusalem Artichoke.

Oh my gosh was this good!! I did add some garlic to the onions, but other than that I followed the recipe as written. I wish I had more Jerusalem artichokes now!
