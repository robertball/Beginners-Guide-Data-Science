You must be a leek fan to enjoy this. It isn't bad and an easy breakfast to make ahead. The first time I made as it written and didn't like how raw tasting the leek was. The second time I made it, I cooked the leek first in a skillet till it is tender, then poured in the eggs to scramble together. I prefer that better.

I liked it.  It was cheap, filling and flavorful.  It wouldn't be a stretch to add other veggies like sauteed spinach and mushrooms to it.  I will definitely make this again.

an easy way to use up leeks when it seems like a shame to throw even that little bit away! takes about 10 minutes to make and is a nice quick dish.

I tried to like this, but the leeks were just too strong. Maybe it would work with half a leek.

Such a simple recipe but very tasty.  I opted to saut√© my finely diced leek in butter and then added my eggs.  I also added a bit of grated Gruyere as I scrambled the eggs.  Since I used home made sauce I omitted the garlic.  This, a green salad and fresh bread made a very satisfying supper.  Nice job GRRL_THANG
