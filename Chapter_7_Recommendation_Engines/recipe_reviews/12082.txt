This tastes like a pie that my mom would make!! The only thing I did differently is that I actually roast my pecans in butter first before I put them in the pie. My mom did this as well, and I like the way it makes the pie taste.

Mom had made pecan pies for years and they were very sweet, but at Christmas she asked me if I'd fix one for my brother. I got this recipe instead because you said it wasn't as sweet. I made this pecan pie (my 1st) and it was great. I did put 3/4 cup brown sugar and used light corn syrup (mainly because it was the only kind I had and didn't want to go to store in mid pie. I also threw in a few extra nuts. My mom said it was great (It had been so long I don't think she knew the diffence between the recipes until I told her, but it was a big hit with everyone at Christmas

Last year my Dad moved from Texas up here to NY to be closer to his children.  His family is originally from the South.  When he was asked by my sister if he had a favorite dessert he would like for Thanksgiving, he said he would like a Pecan Pie, but he was sure she wouldn't know how to make it.  Well, determined to make my Dad's favorite, I got on "the Net" to find a recipe and found Mike's.  His sister came in for Thanksgiving too (another Southerner).  They both commented that this was by far the best pecan pie they ever tasted.  I had to admit it was the best I ever had too, because I never had or even baked one before.  I had always heard how rich they were.  We heated up the pieces and put French Vanilla ice cream on them...Thank you Mike!!!...BTW...I ended up making 2 of them for Christmas last year, and there wasn't a single piece of crust left of them by the end of the evening.

I'm a professional baker with over 10 years experience.  This recipe was given to me about 8 years ago by a customer who thought this recipe would be great for me to use instead of the one I was given in culinary school.  After a few minor tweaks here and there, and my own homemade crust, this is the best selling pie I've ever made.  It's also a family favorite, and has converted my dad, who didn't eat pecan pie because it was always too sweet, a HUGE fan of it.  I don't know what kind of dark corn syrup the user who thought it was too bitter tried, but this pie is an enormous hit with my family, friends, and my clients.  If I don't have dark corn syrup, I substitute with 3/4 c. light corn syrup and top the cup off with molasses(spray the glass measuring cup with cooking spray to make everything come out easier).  I've also only chopped half the pecans, add them to the crust(not the custard), pour the custard in and top the pie with the whole nuts(randomly, not necessarily in a pattern).  The pie cuts easier with chopped nuts, but the whole nuts on top make a prettier presentation.

WONDERFUL!!  Not too sweet, just right.  I added 1/8 cup of condensed milk and 1/2 stick melted butter.  I changed the flour amount to 2 and 1/2 tablespoons.  I am fromthe south and this is the best pecan pie I have ever had!!

This was my first attempt at a pecan pie, and I have to say this recipe was very easy, and quick too. I read all the reviews, and glad I did, for I had light, not dark corn syrup, so I just used half a cup of brown sugar in place of half the white, and used the full amount of light corn syrup. Came out great, taste wise...I over baked the crust a bit, but still really tasty...Thanks Mike, my hubby loved the pie!

we really liked this pie! note: not sifting the flour did not have bad side effects. I roasted my nuts in Imperial butter before adding them into the mixture. I also added 1 tbsp. of Kahlua liquor, which it complimented so well. I roasted half-sized pecans and then placed them one by one on top of the pie for decoration. Then when the pie was almost ready, I brushed a lil' bit of beated egg white over the pecans to give it a shiny look. Simply marvelous! :)

Made exactly as written.  Was delicious warm, and even better out of the fridge the next day.  My husband thought it was the best pecan pie he ever tasted.  Similar to what other reviewers found, my pie did take about 70 minutes to bake.

This is it!  I was recently in Houston and brought home a Brazos Bottom Pecan Pie from Goode BBQ, a major Houston institution.  Now that pie did it for me.  My teen granddaughter ate some and proclaimed she was going with me on my next trip back home.    Well, she had some of this pie for Thanksgiving and said this was better.  I won't claim that, but it is dang good.  The change I made was brown sugar instead of the white.  I also buttered sauted the pecans.  I recommend making the pie crust instead of ready made.

I made this recipes as written, and added some Jack Daniels as was suggested, and I loved it!  I normally don't eat Pecan Pie, I just make it for others in the family that do, but even I enjoyed this.  Great recipe!

What's not to like?  This tastes like everything I want in a pecan pie, only better, because I added 1/2 cup of Amaretto instead of 3 tablespoons...

Especially good in a shortbread crust!

I used light corn syrup since that is what I have in the pantry and it was great. I used pecan halves and slightly chopped them. My son loves pecan pie and he had 2 pieces after school today!!  I also cooked for about 10 minutes longer because it was too liquidy after 55 minutes. Will make for Thanksgiving!!!

So I'm not much of a baker but this turned out to be wonderful!  I took the suggestions for substituting brown sugar for white, using light corn syrup instead of dark, and cooking 70 minutes instead of 55.  Purely out of inadequate supplies, I ended up using about 3/4 cup light corn syrup and 1/4 cup of regular maple pancake syrup the second time I made this.  The maple syrup added a fantastic scent and flavor.

I made this at Thanksgiving a couple years back and it was my 1st attempt at pecan pie.  I'm not crazy out pecan pie in general, but my hubbie loves it and he loved this version too.  Homemade pie crust makes all the difference in a pie.  Once you get good at making your own crust, you'll consistently impress people with your pies.

I used a graham cracker crust, i blind baked it for 8min first so it would'nt get soggy.  The filling was just the right amount, so i would'nt use a deep dish crust like the recipe calls for.  I don't think it would fill up all they way.  Also, the "not too sweet" description is misleading.  It was REALLY sweet, i even used salted pecans!  But, pecan pie should be!

This was "the best pecan pie we have ever had".  I received complements like that through all of Thanksgiving.  I am making it again for Christmas.  I am not a big pecan pie lover because they just seem like a pile of sugar but this one actually tasted like pecan - like it should!  My husband was so excited because this is his favorite kind of pie.

I give this 5 stars because my family enjoyed it emmensely and my husband, being the pecan pie expert, raved over it! I think my 9 inch deep dish was too deep since it didn't fill enough and it took nearly 70 minutes to cook.  I will try it with a smaller dish and pecans halves since I feel the chopped reduces the flavour of the pecans.  Sure to be a regular in our home!  Thanx!

This is the only pecan pie recipe I'll use now.  I've made it over and over again and everyone loves it.  Last time I made it I added 2 tablespoons of Crown Royal whiskey but didn't think it did anything to improve the flavor.  I didn't notice any difference.

This pie is good, not overly sweet but I think 55 minutes is too long to cook it. Mine came out a bit too chewy and I cooked it for 50 mins. I thought the filling would be more uniform, less clumpy. Good flavor, though I could definately taste the stronger dark corn syrup flavor.

I've added this to my staple of recipes, and I get glowing reviews!  It's not too sweet, which kept me from making(and eating)pecan pie for years.

We did not care for this pie. My husband had one piece and then we ended up throwing the rest away. I didn't realize how much of an impact dark corn syrup would have on this and it was pretty substantial. It turned out to be very bitter and just not the kind of pecan pie we enjoy. I will stick with making pecan pie with light corn syrup.

This pie is exactly what Mr. Valek promises. "not overly sweet... easy to make, and great served warm with a scoop of vanilla ice cream". I took it to a get-together at a friend's and everyone loved it.

My mother used to make a pecan pie that my husband loved, but since she lost the recipe I've been looking for one that tastes like hers.  I liked this pie- normally pecan pies are too sweet and gooey for my taste, but hubby just gave it an "okay" and said it wasn't sweet enough for him.

I thought it was okay. My daddy LOVED the nuts - but I felt as if it still should have been baked a little more and, personally, the inside was like eating a sweet dough. But others seemed to like it:)

Great recipe !  I made one for Thanksgiving and should have baked three !  My fifteen year old son, who wouldn't even eat pecans has decided that this is his favorite pie....Go figure.  I'll look forward to making a couple more for Christmas.  Thanks you.
