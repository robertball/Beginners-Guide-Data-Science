This is actually called "Texas Sheetcake" where I'm from (Austin). I've also seen it called California sheetcake. You can put it in cookie sheet and make the cake pieces thin (which seem like brownies I guess). Oprah had a version of it on her website once but it didn't have the cinnamon. It's great with the special frosting.

I think I am addicted to these. I bake them ALL THE TIME! I love the combination of chocolate and cinnamon. And they have a very nice chocolate taste which surprised me since there is so little cocoa.

I leave out the cinnamon and use strong brewed coffee instead of water. Excellent brownie.

This brownie is exceptionally easy and quick. It has more of the consistency of cake than a brownie but is very moist not too sweet airy and delicious with a cup of coffee or a glass of millk. Great for a little quiet time treat for yourself!!!

Really moist and delicious but nothing like a brownie. This is a basic chocolate cake but a really good one. I recommend this. I can't tell you how moist this was. A substitute for buttermilk is regular milk with a 1/2 teas. of white vinegar added. I used this instead of buttermilk.

I made these for Super Bowl and we were all a bit disappointed in them. Nothing like brownies! It made a moist cake but the flavor was weak almost like I had omitted something or done something wrong. (I bake a great deal however I did double-check myself and to the best of my knowledge followed the directions exactly.) The chocolate flavor wasn't very strong at all and was almost over powered by the cinnamon. In my opinion it needs more cocoa powder and possibly some other adjustments. If you are looking for a fudgy brownie or a texas-style chocolate cake this isn't it! The frosting was very good however I had to add more milk to make it thin enough to pour/spread over the cake and everyone agreed the frosting was the best part!! I won't make this again.

I don't like supermoist chewy brownies. By the picture that went with this recipe I knew I was going to make something more cake-like. The cinnamon/vanilla flavor was a nice twist on the chocolate flavor. What you call these is a matter of perspective. Here in Venezuela brownies are moist but cakelike and cakes are terribly dry. Whatever you want to call these they're moist and sweet enough for me and taste good.

I actually baked these in muffin tins and put cream cheese icing on them. I'd thought they would bake up flat like a brownie but they looked just like cupcakes. Took them into work and now I'm expected to start bringing in cupcakes regularly. I just can't figure out the texture. Too dry for a brownie but too dense for cupcake. Whatever it tastes good.

I gave this 3 stars not because it wasn't good but because the title is somewhat misleading as many others have said. The definition of "brownie" in my cooking dictionary states: "Brownie: A cake-like cookie usually containing chocolate and often covered with nuts." This recipe isn't "cake-like" it IS cake. I guess I'm just used to Texas Sheet Cake in its usual thinner form. A 9 x 13 pan makes a tall mouthful. I also prefer the TSC chocolate frosting that is prepared in a saucepan.

Did not like the combination of cinn with choc..I even reduced the cinn to 1/2 tsp. Just not what we liked. I also tried coffee instead of water for more choc taste. I only gave 3 stars because this is not brownies it is cake and I was looking for brownies.

Not good. Sorry. Might be a fine chocolate cake but there are better recipes for that out there.

A wonderful CAKE recipe. Not brownies. If it were baked in a large jelly roll pan it would be more like a brownie.

Well perhaps I don't know the meaning of the word 'brownie' - but it tasted like a brownie to me. I loved these they have a nice vanilla flavour that compliments the chocolate and cinnemon. I will definitely make them again.

Like many other reviews said this is more of a cake than brownie. The edges get crisp and brownie like but the middle is definitely cake like. I didn't have buttermilk and just used skim milk instead and it turned out fine (maybe this is the reason for the cake like consistency but maybe not). The cinnamon is a nice touch for a different flavor. I made this with the Texas Frosting as recommended. This was great for a chocolate fix and fairly easy to make just not brownie enough for me.

Very nice cake--but definitely not a brownie. Next time I'll double the cocoa as it is not very chocolaty. The frosting was quite tasty. I melted the butter in the microwave and then stirred the powdered sugar vanilla and milk in with a wooden spoon. It had a nice melt-in-your-mouth texture.

The outside was hard and very chewy and the ingredients did not mix so I had clumps. It also has no flavor whatsoever.

Definitely agree with other reviewers that this is not brownie...it is cake! I thought it was OK. Easy. Husband liked though. I think I will continue to look for other such recipes.

In a 9X13 pan this is more cake than brownie. Great flavor and moist but not a brownie. I did use the frosting recommended and used buttermilk and cinnamon in that.

Very good and very moist. If you want brownies this is more like a cake. It was chocolately enough for me but still a very good dessert.
