Ok, this was a fantastic recipe to start with. I only made a few minor changes:
1-I lightly breaded the chops before browning, as a matter of fact I did not egg wash them, I just coated with flour & then browned.
2-I chopped an onion & threw it into the pan to saute close to the end of the chops browning. And then put the onion into bake with the chops.
3-I used a small (14.5 oz) can of diced tomatoes instead of tomatoe sauce.
**NOTE when I tried this recipe I used about 1/2 inch thick bone-in chops & it only took about 30 min NOT 1 hour to bake so keep an eye out.
This dish was wonderful served with rice on the side, you can even spoon some of the liquid from the chops pan onto the rice.....Try this recipe, you & or your family will thank you for trying it !!

I always cook pork chops on the stove, so rather than getting another dish dirty, I used the browning pan, put on a tight fitting lid, reduced the heat to low and cooked for 45min. A simple recipe made simpler!

Love it. LOVED it. But of course, I made a mistake. I mixed all of the ingredients together and added a tsp. of worcestershire sauce then just slathered it on the boneless chops. I then poured the tomato sauce over it (a larger can) and baked it for the recommended time. It was fantastic. My husband and I had the leftovers the next day over rice. We had both the dinner and leftovers with Brussels sprouts and it was phenomenal. Great recipe, thanks a million, this will go into the recipe box as a winner! ;-)

This was SOOOO good.  When I first showed my husband the recipe, he said he wasn't so sure of it, but then again, neither was I.  I was looking for something easy, and different.  This was SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO good.  I thought it may have been too much liquid, because I used really thin pork chops, but I still followed the recipe to a tee, and it worked out perfectly.  I didn't cook them in the oven for an hour, since they were thin chops, I kept an eye on them, and probably only needed to cook them for about 1/2 hour before they reached 160 degrees.  The sauce reminded me of my grandmother's home made barbeque sauce.  DELICIOUS!!  Thanks!

You're right, Laurie...my Mom's original recipe called for fresh chopped celery, but my kids never liked the texture. Celery seed is a great addition. Also, I forgot to mention that covering the dish tightly in foil helps keep the chops moist.

Wonderful!!  I use thick, lean pork chops and I don't care for mustard, so I leave it out.  The chops are not dry at all.  The sauce comes out slightly sweet from the brown sugar, but spicy enough because of the pepper.  This goes absolutely wonderfully with the recipe for honey roasted red potatoes found on this site.

Very good chop recipe. Overall my family liked it alot.  Meat was moist and had a good flavor. I played with the ingredients abit.  Used only half of the brown sugar ( actually used a dark Molasses sugar ) added some worchestshire sauce to the tomato sauce, topping the chops with one sliced onion and afew minced garlic cloves to kick-up the flavor of the sauce some.  Was very good served with mashed potatoes,green beans and fresh fruit.  I will make this again.

Ok maybe a 3.5. The pork chops were very chewy and tough.  I think if I were to make this again, I would forget about precooking them altoghter.  This might be something I would do in the crockpot instead.  After 20 mins. in the oven (350)the internal temp. on my boneless chops was 170 degrees.  I was very worried about the sauce, after adding the fresh lemon juice, it tasted like cocktail sauce.  But in actuallity, the sauce was the best part of this recipe. Thank you for sharing!

This was delicious. I didn't have dried mustard so I mixed dijon mustard with the tomato sauce before I pored it over the chops. I also added some minced garlic and onion. I will definitely make this again!

I received many compliments on this recipe.  I only used about a tablespoon of olive oil and used pasta sauce in place of the canned tomato sauce.  The pepper gave it just the right amount of spiciness for us.   Thank you Kate!

I didn’t feel that this recipe deserved four stars.  I only modified the recipe by swapping tomato sauce for diced to tomatoes.  Either way, the internal temperature was reached way before the hour (more like ½ hour) and thus I had to thicken the sauce in a pan on the stove.  I wouldn’t say it was bad.  I was intrigued by the fact that such a simple recipe got such a strong rating for a “quick fix” meal, and thus was looking forward to the practicality of making this in my rotation.  I will make again, when considering pre-prepared meals or delivery though.

Best pork chops I have ever made (according to both of my boys and my wife). The lemon juice, brown sugar and mustard blended perfectly with the tomatoes. I did tweak the recipe slightly because I wanted to saute everything in one pan on the stove.  I used petite diced canned tomatoes intead of tomato sauce because I like my sauce a little more chunky.  I also added 1 small sweet onion finely chopped, 1 tablespoon chopped garlic and 1 tablespoon dried basil.  I mixed all the ingredients together because I wanted to ensure that all the flavors blended. After browning the thick chops, I reduced the heat to low and poored the sauce over them covered and let simmer for about 20-30 mintes until juices ran clear. Perfecto! Served this with brown rice using the sauce to top the rice.  We are already are discussing when we will make these again next week.

I love this recipe!  I have made this many times and found that I like to double the sugar and mustard.  I also add italian seasonings to the tomato sauce before adding it to the dish.  Yummy!

super delicious! I did a few tweaks, using a tablespoon and a half of prepared mustard instead of dry (didn't have dry), added a tablespoon of cooking sherry to the brown sugar mix, and another two or three tablespoons to deglaze the pan. I cut up some onions and mushrooms and popped it in the pan as another user had suggested. I also used spaghetti sauce (garlic and onion) in place of plain tomato sauce and added a few shakes of basil and some sweet cream butter. It was amazing!

This was yum! Next time I might halve the brown sugar as it was maybe a bit too sweet, but we overall enjoyed this meal. I served the pork with brown rice, peas and corn on the cob. The pork remained very tender and did not become chewy.

Really good and easy and the pork chops were actually tender. Would make one change - this recipe has too much black pepper, which makes it too spicy for the little ones palette. Will use 1/4 teaspoon next time.

These came out so yummy!  Loved 'em!  Tender pork chops in a sweet barbecue-style sauce.  The recipe is perfect; I only made a few minor adjustments because I was cooking 6 boneless pork chops.  I used a 15-ounce can of tomato sauce, and doubled the rest of the ingredients EXCEPT the water...that I left at 1/4 cup.  I baked them in a 13"x9" pan.  Served them with Betty Crocker roasted garlic & cheddar mashed potatoes, and bagged coleslaw with a homemade coleslaw dressing.  The extra sauce from the pork chops even tasted great on the potatoes!

This was a fabulous recipe!!  I made a few small additions and changes to it that gave it even more taste!  I dredged the pork chops in egg and flour then in bread crumbs before browning them!  I also chopped one large onion and sauteed it with a clove of garlic then poured it over the chops after the brown sugar mix, but before the tomatoes.  Instead of tomatoe sauce, I used 2 cups of diced tomatoes.  Cooking the chops for 40 minutes covered with tin foil produced a much moister and more tender chop! I served it over rice!  My 4 1/2 year old son ate an entire chop and rice he liked it so much, and he fights about eating everything!  Thanks Kate for the AMAZING recipe!!!  It is now a family favourite!

My 95 yr old aunt has made this recipe passed down from her mother and I have been searching for it for a couple of years.  The only difference is hers calls for 1 tsp. celery seed, which I add.  This is yummy. We refer to them as "country pork chops".

I was underwhelmed with this recipe.  It was not terrible, but the thick pork was a bit tough and the sauce left much to be desired.  My husband called the dish "pork meatloaf" because the sauce was so similar to ketchup.

I really didn't like this recipe. The sauce was way too runny. I found the sauce to be very bland and the chops were very dry. Maybe if you baked it for much, much longer to thicken up the sauce and tenderize the meat a bit. Maybe this would make a good all day crock pot recipe. I wont make this again.

Amazing delicious what else can I say about these pork chops!!! I got board of the same old same old way to cook these pork chops and then I came across this recipe and said hey why not some thing new. I have tried new things before and not liked them. This was different, even my two year old loved it and he is a picky eater!!!!!! I even passed this on to a relative to try and she LOVED it too. How ever I did add a few things like chopped white onion and finely chopped garlic and a few spices basil and oregano to taste. Thank you for sharing this recipe with all of us I know that it will be used in our house more often then apple sauce.

For some reason my pork chops came out dry and tough. If I made these again I'd leave out the water (I basically made boiled pork chops). Also, I'd reduce the cooking time to about 40 minutes. The seasoning was good. I didn't have any dry mustard so I used cumin instead. I also only had a small 8oz. can of tomato sauce so I coated each chop with sriracha for some extra zing.

This recipe was good but not great.  The meat was cooked a little too much in the middle.

Very simple and tastey! I used a can of flavored diced tomatoes (so next time I'll leave the water out) and I put sliced onions ontop for added flavor. Next time I will be doing this in the crock pot, it is an awesome crock pot recipe! the meat just tenderizes and soaks up the juices. The flavor was very good! I think i will serve it with butter & chive noodles next time or a rice pilaf would be nice too.

Made these for New Year's dinner and they were PERFECT!!   I made 16 thick chops for 9 people and only had 4 remaining - they were such a hit...very flavorful & extremely tender.  I took the advice of reviewers and added poultry seasoning, thyme, mixed up salt, diced onion & green pepper to the sauce.  I browned them in a roasting pan on the stove top & finished them in the oven.  The alotted cooking time was perfect as written in the recipe.  WOW what a great pork chop!!  Everyone requested the recipe & cleaned their plates...little old ladies went back for seconds.  These chops go great with the sauerkraut casserole recipe on this site.

This recipe is great!! Loved the sauce.  I added onion, garlic and some thyme.  Turned out great.  I also cooked the porkchops on the stove top instead of the oven.  Too lazy and didn't want to dirty another pan. Definitely a keeper.

Awesome recipe.  I followed another reviewer's lead and did this all on the stove.  I didn't have the dry mustard powder and I added a tsp of Worcestershire sauce.  I sprinkled both sides of the chops with the sugar, pepper and salt before I seared them.  Then I seared them quickly on both sides, reduced the heat to low and covered them with the rest of the sugar, salt and pepper mixed with the juice and tomato sauce and let them simmer until done.  YUMMMO!

These were tasty and moist  but...... Next time I will leave out the added water. It made the sauce a little thin. I added chili pepper flakes for a little more pizzaz. I will make them again though.

This recipe turned out be so delicious! It was also very simple to make. I followed it exactly for seasonings and cooking, except I just added a chopped onion on top of the pork before the sauce was poured over. Thanks for the excellent recipe!

We loved this!!! I followed the recipe but, I made a couple; of adjustments... I  used 1 T. oil, 1 1/2 T brown sugar, no salt, and 8 oz can of sauce.  Instead of the 1/4 c. water I put 3-4 T water in the pan after browning the pork and added it to the dish at the end! I also used pork sirloin steaks, instead of chops!!!

Great Sauce, can use a bit of spice via jalapeno or chipotle powder, or cayanee, etc.  The cooking time though is WAY off.  This is probably done close to 30min for most of the avg grocery store pork chops.  I cooked 50 and it was way over done.

Loved this recipe. Don't like using too much oil. So basically seasoned the mixture with the brown sugar mixture and lemon juice and let it marinate overnight. Then I added the tomato sauce and cooked them as directed. Came out great.

Very good; husband loved it but chops were almost an inch thick and I felt they could have used some extra time or perhaps they had cooked to long....  Easy prep and would make again.  Thanks for the recipe.

Fantastic!  I did not change a thing, except instead of 2 tbsp. dark brown sugar, I used molasses.  It turned out wonderful!  I might even try this with a pork loin :)

Wonderful recipe.  I will most definitely make this again.  Even though it wasn't necessary, I did make some changes.  For 6 chops, I sauteed 2 red bell peppers, 2 green bell peppers and 1 lrg onion.  Once the pepper/onion mixture is softened, to that, I added a 14.5 ounce can of diced tomatoes and a 10 ounce can of tomato sauce.  I browned the chops and prepared the remainder of the recipe as described.  Once the chops were browned, I poured the tomato pepper/onion mixture over the chops.  I covered the pan and let them simmer a good half hour.  It turned out fantastic.  My husband asked when I was going to make this again.  Next time I make this, I will prepare the chops in the oven as described as I think the chops will then be a bit more tender.  Truly wonderful recipe.

This is a great recipe on pork OR thinly cut chicken. If you don't like pepper very much then use half the suggested amount. I also excluded the mustard a few times and it turned out fine - otherwise I followed the directions exactly and it was great. Very quick and easy - a bi-weekly staple in my home!

These were good...but could have used a little more flavor. The tomato sauce made them moist. This is a great recipe to build on.

Loved this recipe! Really delicious and a hit with the hubby and kids.  Just a helpful hint - if you do not have dry mustard, you may substitute the 1/2 tsp of dry mustard with 1/2 tsp of prepared mustard or 1/4 tsp of crushed mustard seed:)Enjoy!

This recipe was a refreshing change to standard cream soup pork chops! I did use diced tomatoes instead of tomato sauce, because hubby isnt crazy about tomato flavor. He is a very picky pork chop eater, and he liked these. I thought they were good.

My husband loved this recipe. I put my mexican touch adding a 1/4 cup jalapenos salsa that my husband loves. Even my children liked it. I made 10 pork chops, and the baking time was 1 hour. They are juicy tender chops, mmmm . I'm sure this recipe will become a favorite for my family.

This is a nice and easy recipe, great when you are in a hurry.  The flavor is nice and you have most of it on hand.

Delish! I forgot the lemon juice but was able to use my Nonna's home made tomato sauce. (When I figure out how to make her sauce I will let everyone know.) The chops I used were not that thick so I only baked them for 1/2 hour but they were still unbelievably moist.  Thanks Kate.

I followed the recipe exactly and found it to be ok. I would eat it again if it were served but I would never ask for it. Tastier than a plain pork chop but a bit too tomato-ey even with the added spices. It was tender, though. Other than the tomato flavor, though, I didn't think there was a big taste off it. I was a little disappointed as the other reviews for it are so high, but I guess it could just boil down to individual preference.

This was excellent. I did add onions as another reviewer suggested and I thought that was a good idea. I also did the tsp. of worcestshire sauce which gave it a pleasant tanginess. Overall, this was a winner. I ended up cooking my chops alittle too long since they were on the thin side but if I had used thick chops like I was supposed to - it would have been even better. That's what I'll do next time!

Sauce is delicious but I changed recipe a bit.  Season chops with salt, pepper, garlic powder, then dredge in flour, dip in egg and then bread crumbs.  Fry in 1 TB oil about 2 min each side.  I then took ALL the ingredients and added the celery seed, mixed them up and poured them over top of chops in covered casserole dish.  I LOVE this recipe.

I used splenda (same measurement) instead of brown sugar. I don't like mustard, but used dry mustard anyway. I didn't taste the mustard at all. I used leftover tomato paste with a little water to make 10 ounces. It was a great sauce. Kinda sweet yet peppery. And I loved how much there was.

Yum Yum Yum!  Great, quick, easy, and I had all ingredients on hand.  I did, however, have to substitute regular mustard for dried mustard, but it still came out delishous!  Hubby loved them.  Will make them again and again.  Thanks!  Jen

For this recipe, I only had 3 boneless chops (not thick, not thin).  The sauce made the chops moist and tasty; the sauce itself, didn't do much for us. The chops were in the oven for about 45 minutes and came out nice and tender.

Nice and quick.  I didn't have dry mustard so I subbed for dijon, which turned out pretty good.  I added diced tomatoes instead of tomato sauce and light brown sugar since I didn't have dark. All of us liked this pretty well, but agreed that it wasn't special per say, but tasty none the less.

I'm not a huge fan of this recipe.  The tomato sauce washes out a lot of the flavor from the spices and I get better results when I use an egg coating and spaghetti sauce.  Worth a try though, the brown sugar was a good idea that I'll use in similar recipes.

This recipe sounded really good from the comments, but I didn't have tomato sauces so I followed the suggestions of another commenter to use diced tomatoes. It did not work out well. There was too much water and therefore no sauce. I will try again with original recipe.

This was really good. I didn't have it in the oven for too long as some reviewed as suggested. I'm always afraid that my pork will be overdone but after about 30-40 minutes, my chops were moist and delicious. I used really thick center cut pork chops. I also used honey dijon mustard in place of the mustard the recipe suggested and when I combined the brown sugar and the mustard, I mixed it together with the tomatoe sauce and then poured it over the chops. I will definitely make this again. *****

This is delicious and so easy.  I browned the boneless chops in fry pan and cooked in same pan covered on top of stove at low simmer for about 30 mins.  Very tender and so good! Also, I added 1/2 cup chopped onion.

This was really good! I just made it to suprise my bf whose on his way home from work. I think it will be a pleasant one. I actually used sloppy joe sauce instead of tomato and I subsituted the salt with garlic salt.I made simple sidedish of steamed broccoli and cauliflauer and it goes well with the dish. On the downside, I don't think it needed to cook for the whole hr. its a little tough,and when I make it the next time around I don't think I will use the water it did'nt seemed necessary.

okay, I hate to burst everyone's bubble,but this was not that great. I bought the best thick boneless pork chops at a local market, followed the recipe to a tee, bought a big loaf of crusty bread and made garden fresh peas which my husband loves. Well, the sauce was tasty but the chops were dry and not tender. Maybe this would be better in the crock pot. Probably won't make it again.

This was easy, very tasty and the sauce is really good over rice! I made some changes to better fit my family's needs: I used 6 rather than 4 chops, Used a larger casserole dish to accomodate. I left out the dry mustard and added a pack of onion soup mix and some garlic to the tomato sauce. I used 1/2 cup brown sugar. I also used 2 cans of italian herb tomato sauce. I baked at 350 for 1 hour. The sauce was a bit runnier than I expected but was absorbed well by the rice. Next time I wont add the 1 cup of additional water I added, which really should have been 1/2 cup to begin with. I will make this again soon, and maybe add some pineapple chunks and a bit more brown sugar.

I made this last night for my family. We absolutely loved it. Everytime I make pork chops they always come out dry and tough. This did not. I read the reveiws first and I also added a few things to it. I added stewed tomatoes, becuase that is all I had. I also added basil and garlic powder. I had to layer the pork chops because my terracotta pot is small but they came out nice and tender. The is definatly a keeper. Love the sauce. I fried up some Gnocci's in garlic butter and my husband loved the sauce poured over them. I might try this with chicken and see how it comes out. Thanks for the recipe.

The only change to this recipe was I used garlic, basil @ oregon tomato sauce because that was what I had on hand.  I would rate this a bit lower than 4 stars but my toddler absolutely loved it - she asked for more three times.  I served it with fingerlng potatoes and yellow beans - which of course she did not eat :)

it was good but was lacking flavor. It reminded me of a dish my mom made growing up..tomatoe sauce, green peppers, onion, garlic and chops. It needs a little something though...we added salt but I don't think I'll be making this one again. I served it over white rice and along side of steamed broccoli. Theres just to many scrumptious pork chop recipes out there these days! Personally...it was a nice change instead of regular ole mushroom chops, but my husband was not a big fan.

I made these porkchops for my husband and teenage daughter tonight and it went over pretty well.  It was easy to make and quick.  I used very thick pork chops, like 1.5" and they turned out beautifully.  My husband said that they were juicy and fell apart like pulled pork - he said this would be a good recipe to convert to a pulled pork sandwich.  I did use roasted garlic pasta sauce because I didn't have regular tomato sauce.  I will pick some up and try making it again and see if they up the rating.

I followed the recipe exactly and it came out moist and yummy. My husband loved it, my only complaint is that the tomato sauce tasted a bit like ketchup, and I personally hate ketchup.  Otherwise, a great different way to serve pork.

Great flavor! I decided to try this recipe in my pressure cooker. I still need to tweek just a bit, but, it turned out well, and the chops were really tender. I used a little chicken stock in the bottom of the pan instead of water, and cooked 2 pork chops for 15 minutes. I need to add just a bit more chicken stock as it evaps in the cooking, but, the recipe was still very moist. Thanks for the recipe!

This is a nice variant from the mushroom soup pork chop recipes that have been dominating in our household.  This is a great recipe that produces a tender, moist pork chop.  The only thing I did different was add a teaspoon of garlic seasoning and added 2 tablespoons of lemon juice instead of one.  Thanks for a great recipe!

These came out very moist, which is always a plus for pork chops!  I will add more garlic next time when cooking the onion.

Easy recipe and the pork chops come out very moist.  I used the really thick-cut chops and baked them for 1 hr. and 15 min. They turned out perfect.  I'll definitely fix this again.

Excellent recipe.  The pork chops were moist and tender, and the sauce was good.  My family loves spicy food, so I added some red pepper flakes it was perfect.

My boyfriend and I loved this recipe. I used lime juice instead of lemon, left out the mustard, and used thin cut pork chops (bumping the cook time down to 45 mins). It was a hit!

I'm not sure what all the hype was about with these. I used spaghetti sauce like some suggested, and added garlic and celery salt, but they still turned out rather blah. I wouldn't make this again

I was looking for a recipe with a southern flare and this is it! Great recipe and very fast to make despite the cook time. Also easy because most of the ingrediants are staplesin your pantry. This is a hit with my family.

These were good. I used a home made Marinara Sauce (had no canned tomato sauce.) While browning, I added both granulated onion and garlic. To the brown sugar mix, I added a shake of cayenne pepper and the celery seed recommended by another reviewer.
I also used chicken stock in place of water. Chops were a bit less tender than I had hoped for, but the flavor of the sauce was excellent. May try doing this in the crockpot next time.
Thanks, Kate!

These chops had a pretty good taste. I thought I wouldn't like it because I am not that crazy about tomato sauce recipes. My husband liked it. I will probably make it again, play around with the ingredients to give it a little more kick. Not bad though.

I was pleasantly surprised with this one. I didn't have any dry mustard on hand so I used dijon. I also used this with 8 thin pork chops and the sauce amount was perfect. It thickened beautifully. I served the chops with, and drizzled the sauce over, roasted garlic mashed potatoes. Good comfort food!!

I did as some had and substituted pasta sauce for tomato sauce.  I probably should have left out the water because it was so watery that none of the sauce stuck to the chops, which also meant the seasoning didn't either.  The meat was tender and moist, but the flavor was kind of bland.  It tasted like pork chops with pasta sauce.  Won't make this again.

Great dish!! It came out so good and even my kids liked it, which is a small miracle.  The pork was so nice and tender, and usually I dry it out something terrible no matter how hard I try not to.  I used pasta sauce in place of the tomato sauce, and I didn't have any lemon juice. But it still tasted great!  It's our new favorite dinner.

Really enjoyed this and so did my family. Based on other reviews, I modified it slightly - added sauteed onion and garlic, omitted the water, and used pasta sauce. I actually prepared this early, covered with foil, and let it sit in the fridge all day before cooking. The sauce was wonderful over rice. Will keep this one and make again.

This was really good and easy.  I breaded the pork chops before browning and added button and portobello mushrooms to the onions.  It was really tastey and had lots of good sauce.  It reminded me of chicken catchatorry.

This was one of those days that I was running around like a chicken with my head cut off, making many mistakes---and it still turned out very good! I didn't have brown sugar, so used white. I forgot the lemon juice so put it in after the sugar mixture. I did add onions, garlic and celery seed as suggested in other reviews. It reminded me of a dish I used to make with cabbage, pork chops and tomato sauce. A tasty comfort food. Thanks Kate

My husband and I did not care for this recipe. It reminded me of pork chops cooked in a refined ketchup.  Even with our thick chops it only needed to cook for 45 minutes.  It was not unedibe but we won't be making it again.  The kids liked it, though.

Ok, so I did forget to add the water. Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly. I don't think the water would have changed anything. Tomato sauce plus brown sugar equals ketchup. My family thought they were eating pork chops with ketchup. That's ok if that's what you want to serve, but I would have just put ketchup on pork chops and baked to save the prep time and the homemade tomato sauce. Not terrible tasting, and the kids liked it, but not what I had expected.

Made these last night, tried it on stove, took long time. But, was good. My sauce was runny, but what it lacked, was my own fault, not the recipe.

I think the cook time needs to be watched/trimmed - or you need to be careful not to brown them too long before hand. Not sure where my mistake was, but my thick (1.5"-2") chops ended up dry and I baked them covered with tinfoil being sure to seal it good.  I had dry pork chops in 2 inches of liquid after 60 minutes.  The sauce was tasty and thickened on top of the chops, will use the sauce again.

Love this dish. I had friends over unexpectedly the night I tried it and they loved it also, even asked for the recipe.  I took some advice from the other reviews. Will definitely make this again!

This was good, but not my favorite pork chop recipe. It felt like it was missing something, like onions and green peppers.

This recipe was absolutely delicious.  I used a can of diced tomatoes rather than the sauce and light brown sugar instead of dark, both just because that's what I had on hand and wanted to use them up.  It still turned out wonderfully!  In fact, even if I use sauce in the future, I will still add some diced tomatoes as it added to the texture.  I would cut down on the pepper a little.  It was a bit spicy for my kids, but if you like a small amount of kick it is good.  I wasn't sure about a tomato sauce for pork chops, but it was great!  And super easy.  I love this and will make it again - maybe even for company!

I thought this recipe was very good!  My husband loved the sauce and how tender it was!  I will cook this again for my family and future guests!  I added regular mustard from the fridge since I didn't have the powder kind.  I also added onions since we love them here!  Thanks for the great recipe:)

My husband really liked this. He said it was tender and tasted great (I don't eat meat so I have to take his word for it). He said that it didn't need all the tomato sauce so next time I will just use it in the pan for moisture and flavor. For those that complained about it being dried out, you have to keep foil wrapped tight on top. There is no way to dry out meat with all this moisture if you keep it wrapped.

I had never thought to use tomato sauce w/ pork chops. This recipe was a BIG hit, although I used what I had on hand (leftover pasta sauce/ketchup for the tomato paste). I also used a lot more brown sugar (b/c i love it!), and cooked the whole thing on the stove top to save a little time. I browned the chops at the bottom of a pot, rubbed them down w/ the sugar mixture, then added the sauce and simmered for maybe 30mins. The chops were surprisingly tender and absolutely delicious! My bf said it was the best thing I've ever cooked!

This was great! Easy to do, very tasty.  My 4 & 3 year olds really liked it.  I didn't have enough tomato sauce so I used ketchup also and was still great.

I just made this for the firt time tonight using 6 thin/medium bonless chops and followed the direction except i added in a bit of garlic powder and extra lemon juice. Plus i only had 8 oz of tomato sauce instead of the 10 it called for but it was the best pork chops i ever made.. So tender i served it over white rice and had a oven baked potato on the side. My whole family loved it even my very picky husband who normally hates pork.. So this is awsome and i will make it again.. Thank you so much...

We thought this tasted great and we would like to have it again soon. Served it with baked potatoes, grilled zucchini and a salad and this worked well.  As per others suggestions, I added a tsp of Lea & Perrins, a little bit of tabasco, celery seasoning and garlic powder. I also only cooked it for 45 minutes.  Thanks for the recipe!!

I was skeptical of this recipe at first because I wasn't sure the kids were going to like it?!  After much coaxing they tried it and loved it!  My hubby, who is also a picky eater loved this!  My family will make this a regular at our table!

Yummy!! The only thing I did different was using pizza sauce instead of plain tomato sauce and it was fabulous, gave it a bit of extra zip. Thank you for this recipe I love it. I like a few others was skeptical at first but it's awesome.

My kids are into a more sweeter sauce, so I added sugar to the tomato puree we had (didn't have tomato sauce in my pantry).  Also, added a touch of worcestershire and garlic to the mix that went on top of the chops.  My chops were about 1/2 thick with bone in and they took about 35 minutes.  Tender, juicy, and no leftovers.

I am not usually a fan of pork chops but, I really enjoyed these pork chops. It definitely had a kick which was a good thing. For the tomato sauce I just used a jar of pasta sauce since that is what I had and I really liked it that way.

I think the sauce for this was very tasty. I omitted water and used a can of diced tomatoes with italian seasonings, and I also seasoned the pork with some garlic salt before I browned it. I didn't give it a 5 because I think this would be better suited to a chicken recipe, not pork. This could be my taste buds, but pork in this way just isn't my thing. Other than that, it was tasty. I served it with some pasta with peas sauteed in butter in garlic. I think I will try this next time with some chicken breasts.

i love this recipe... my family does too just a hint to those who think its too bland, add some extra oregeno or buy a can of diced tomatoes with oregeno or italian seasoning to put on top with tomatoe sauce (*omit water when doing this) and it turns out with a thick nice sauce. I think the lemon juice is the real kick, the pork is always so tender and yummay!

Wow!  I made this for my husband and I last night with only 2 pork chops instead of 4.  I left the other ingredient amounts the same and added some spagetti spices to the tomato sauce.  It turned out great, just watch your baking time... it is a lot less with only 2 chops.

I am always a little nervous when it comes to pork chops, since they like to dry out on me so often... But, this recipe was great!  I was a little skeptical about all the liquid (afraid it would dry out the chops), but it was great with some pasta to soak it up!  The chops were actually moist and even my father-in-law, who is the world's worst critic when it comes to dinner enjoyed them!  Thanks so much!

Using 10 ounces of your favorite tomato-y spaghetti sauce (I used Classico Tomato and Sweet Basil), helps the sauce from becoming ketchup-like. The extra flavoring from the sauce helps to make the dish even more flavorful.

I made this using thick loin chops. Chops were nearly overlooked at 25 mins.  I browned them in a cast iron pan and baked in same pan.  The tomato sauce tasted too strong of canned tomato   If I make this again I will increase the seasoning add it to the sauce and add chopped onions, cook it in a pan on the stove for 20 mins then pour over chops.

Fantastic! We used pork steaks instead of chops, and when everything was cooked, we decided next time we'll make 1 1/2 of the recipe because it probably would have been better with more sauce. But definitely a five-star recipe, LOVED it.

Good, easily adaptable recipe for those on a low-fodmap/paleo diet. I have fructose malabsorption so I can't eat anything with garlic or onion and sugars are just best left avoided. I used palm oil shortening for my frying oil (doesn't go rancid at high cooking temps like olive oil, but you could use garlic-infused olive oil too to give a little more flavor), skipped the sugar altogether (but you could use a little maple syrup if you wanted I suppose), and I made my own tomato "sauce" by pureeing a can of organic diced tomatoes in my blender and sprinkling a little basil and parsley. I also sprinkled some Parmesan on the chops before serving. Probably too bland for most folks, but if you have fructmal, you're already used to that! As far as cooking times and heat instructions, I followed them exactly and our pork chops came out delicious and moist. So thankful for recipes like these! Will be adding to our week-night menu for sure.

I was looking for something with a difference and tried this recipe. It was sumptuous.I had no tomato suave so I used the ragu pasta sauce. The garden combination style. That gave it a.m.extra kick. My family loved it.

Best Pork Chops EVER!! I use regular mustard, and added 1 tablespoon of water to the sugar mix, then brushed it on the pork chops. It tastes better. AND instead of tomato sauce, I used Italian sauce. It gave it more of a zesty taste! So yummy!! Great recipe though!!!

I loved the sauce. I did a little change but not much. I didnt pre-cook the pork chops. I doubled all the spices except the salt. (not big fans of salt) I left the water as is but also doubled the sauce. It was delicious. We didnt have to fight over the sauce; there was just enough. (not too little and not too much either) The pork chops were nice and juicy. Very good taste. Definitely going to be doing this again. The whole family loved it.

I loved this recipe!  My picky family of 2 small kiddos and my hubby thought it was just okay.  Then again, they are pretty basic eaters...To save on dishes, I cooked the chops in a cast iron skillet and just put the skillet in the oven to bake.  Since I used a bit more oil (about an inch high in the skillet), I didn't drain and omitted the water.  Also, the chops only took about 45min to bake (maybe I cooked them too long in the skillet on top of the stove).  At any rate... they were fabulous.  Not dry at all (dry meat is an absolute PET PEAVE of mine!!!!).  Served with brocolli rice au gratin and sweet green peas.  Definately a repeat for us!  Next I'm trying crockpot chops to see if they turn out just as tender and juicy as these.

The pork turned out very tender and the sauce had good flavor but not quite enough "oomph" for me.  I'll definately try again but with some garlic and maybe paprika.

Tried this tonight and was definitely satisfied. I also floured the chops before frying and baked for about 45 mins.  The chops were firm but not dry, I will definitely make this again!

This was a great recipe and so easy!  I doubled the brown sugar mixture and added a small can of baby peas for a little addition.  Served with white rice, this was a huge hit for dinner!

Yummy! This recipe has a good flavor and just the right amount. I used chicken instead of pork chops. My 3 yr old ate 3 chicken breasts, he never eats like he did with this dinner. I also served it with rice. Thanks for the great and SIMPLE recipe.

THE PORK WAS VERY TENDER BUT LACKED FLAVOR. THE SAUCE LEFT ALOT TO BE DESIRED. WILL NOT MAKE THIS DISH AGAIN.

The pork was nice and tender, but we weren't wowed by the sauce. It was fine, but nothing outstanding. Thanks anyway!

I couldn't find a 10 oz. can of tomato sauce, so I used tomato soup. I doubled the recipe. We loved it, but next time I would cut the amount of pepper a tad and NOT add the water. DH loved the sauce as "gravy" on his mashed potatoes.

This was only ok.  To be fair I did use stewed tomatoes instead of sauce and also added chopped onions.  It just didn't have much taste.  I will try again using the pasta sauce as others have suggested.

I can't tell you how many times I have made these pork chops. They are incredible. And a crowd pleaser as well!
