I substituted orange juice for sherry used part whole wheat flour part brown sugar and added flax seed meal. Love this recipe because it IS so adaptable & still tastes GREAT!

Great tasting bread! I used 1 cup whole wheat flour instead of all unbleached flour and sunflower seeds instead of walnuts. I'm glad I waited a day for the full flavor development!

I loved the sherry soaked fruit and the allspice flavor of this bread but I found it a bit dry and dense for our taste
