I like this recipe! It's got so many of my favorite things. All that it was missing was garlic, so I added that to this recipe. I served it with a cannellini bean salad. The texture was really creamy, and the flavor quite earthy and mellow. I'm sure that replacing the olive oil with duck schmaltz might have helped! I don't think I would have missed the garlic had I not added it. I will make this again. It makes a very quick meal if you throw it together in the morning and bake it when you get home from work.

I just finished making this recipe and I added 2 - 3 large minced garlic cloves, 10 oz. bag of stemmed & chopped baby spinach, 2 regular
matzo and 2 wheat matzo and it came out really good.   It definitely needed the garlic no question about it.

This could be used for a breakfast, lunch or side dish with dinner.

I tried this - just out of curiosity. I've never had a kugel. I followed the recipe - the only substitution I made was cilantro instead of parsley (I don't like parsley). It was okay, but a little bland for me. Kind of like a quiche, but not quite (it has no milk or butter). I know it's probably not "kosher" but I would have added shredded cheddar - that might have been the missing "ooomph" that it needed to be amazing. Thanks for sharing - I learned a little bit about Jewish culture by reading about this recipe in the magazine and then trying it myself. :)

Wasn't bad, needed extra salt.  Texture was a little weird but I used whole wheat matzo so that may have had something to do with it.

Our family loves this one. I use pareve chicken flavoured stock rather than the real stuff. We like a bit more flavor than parsley gives, so I add a generous handfull of dill. My vegetarian son devours this.

I made this recipe for the first Seder, and I was very happy that all at the dinner liked this new addition.  It was easy to make , and will definitely be in my menu for next year. Marcia M.
