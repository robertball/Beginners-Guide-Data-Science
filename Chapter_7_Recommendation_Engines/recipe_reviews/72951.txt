These burgers turned out perfect.  I added some monterrey jack cheese to the mixture and left some without onions.  Will grill these again maybe stuffed with swiss cheese and canadian bacon!

I too changed the servings to scale down the recipe.  I made it for 4 people and used bacon in place of the ham.  This was great!  Next time I will use Pepper Jack Cheese. Everyone loved these.  Will make again for sure.

Used crisp cooked bacon pieces instead of ham, used Swiss cheese then added a slice of Provolone on top.

Holy huge! I cut down the recipe for 1 pound of beef, and still made 4 burgers with it. Instead of stuffing the burgers, I mixed the ham, cheese, etc. into the beef and just cooked them indoors (it's been snowing for days here). Hubby said they were his new favourite and I'm inclined to agree!

We just loved these! We made them much, much smaller maybe totaling 1/3 pound of beef per burger and of course cooked them for a lot less time because they were thinner.  Even at 1/3 pound total they were plenty big!  You can cut the filling ingredients in half and still have enough.  I used the scaling function and changed it to 2 servings and that fed my family of 5 with leftovers.

These were awesome, but they were HUGE! I could only eat 1/2 of one. My husband loved them, and is able to eat a whole one! Thank you for the recipe!

Very tasty. Scaled down ingredients so not such big portions. Added fresh chilli & chilli powder instead of hickory. My husband loved this burger "the king burger". Will make again.

My family loved this recipe.  The only problem was the burgers were MASSIVE (the recipe will make 4 to 5 burgers with 5 pounds of meat)!!!  I'll make again, but on a smaller scale.

Excellent! After reading all the reviews on this recipe, most reviews mentioned the size of the burgers as being massive so I decided to mix the ingredients into the meat instead of stuffing them. First I mixed the Worcestershire with 1 garlic clove and used a chipotle pepper (instead of hickory seasoning) in a blender and then mixed it with the hamburger. Then mixed the cheese, onion, mushrooms and crisp bacon (in place of ham) with the hamburger meat. Divided the mixture into 1/4 lb patties and grilled. While grilling I brushed the burgers with a homemade chipotle BBQ sauce and added a slice of cheddar cheese on top. Served them with all the trimmings and chipotle mayonnaise. The chipotle peppers add a nice spicy and smokey flavor to the hamburger. 
"The best burger I have ever tasted" were the comments from our guests. Excellent recipe and will definitely use again.

These were great as the recipe was written, except that I couldn't find the hickory by me, but will see if my market can order it. I also tried them with sauteed onions, bacon and cheddar and they were simply maaaaahvelous! Everything certainly is bigger and better in Texas!!!  I passed this recipe on to my sister outside of Amarillo and she said they were great...thanks!

Really good idea and despite sounding fiddly with a patty maker they are so easy to do, all the family liked them and they'll be made again and again. Thank you for the recipe.

Absolutely wonderful. Served the mushrooms on top of the burger with a slather of adobo mayonnaise. A nice twice baked spud to totally ruin the diet and steamed corn on the cob. A toasted onion bun made it even better. Thanks for the recipe.

My husband and I made these over the weekend for my parents, and we altered the recipe just a bit. We left out the ham since we're not fans of it, and replaced the cheddar cheese with swiss. We sauted the mushrooms and onion together with a lot of minced garlic (YUM!) and then placed the mix in between the patties with a bit of shredded swiss. Then after the burgers were done, we put swiss singles on top... YUM! I couldn't find hickory seasoning, so we used Mrs. Dash's hamburger seasoning to cut back on the sodium and it was quite tasty. My dad is usually the burger grilling king and is picky about his burgers, and he scarfed his down! We will definitely make these again. They are a lot of work, but SO worth it. Next time we're going to try stuffing with Rotel tomatoes with green chillies, jalapenos, and pepper jack cheese!

These hamburgers were huge!  I had a hard time sealing them closed, but they turned out delicious.  Everything melted together in the middle.  I could only eat half of one though.  Wowsers!

These were some of the best burgers I've ever eaten.  It makes 1/2 pound burgers which is way too big for a regular hamburger roll, so we ate it without.  The onions were still kind of crunchy after grilling, so maybe sauteeing the mushrooms and onions before hand would take care of that.  Also made these by just combining all ingrediants and making smaller burgers, rather than pocketing the ingrediants.  It was just as tasty.  Definitely a keeper!

These were huge burgers, but I scaled the recipe down to make two. I didn't use hickory seasoning (couldn't find any in the store) so I substituted it with chili powder and they were good. I also substituted the chopped cooked ham for cooked bacon and the cheddar cheese with blue cheese. I sauteed the onions and mushrooms a little before dicing them. Fresh kaiser rolls and we had ourselves a delicious meal.

Its a great recipe but the fat and sodium content are VERY high... I would substitute healthier ingredients and its good to go for our family...leave out the ham, reduce the cheese, smaller burgers..

Talk about a thick burger! I had to cut them so the kids could get the burger in their mouths! I didn't have some of the ingredients this recipe called for, so I adapted to how we normally season burgers.  I added 1 package ranch dressing mix to the ground beef, and stuffed the burgers with mozzarella cheese, ham, sauteed green peppers and onions. I slow grilled them on my charcoal grill. Cooking them this way, allowed the burgers to get done, but not burn. Great recipe!

I love these burgers. I add cayenne pepper, crushed red peppers, onion n garlic powder to my meat though. Also add some Tonys Cajun seasoning. Cut out the mushrooms n ham n just use cheese. They are delicious.

Awesome, that was awesome! That is exactly what my husband said after finishing this burger. I left out the ham and mushrooms because he just wanted cheese and onion. Both my husband and son loved this one! Thanks so much.

These burgers were awesome!  I added an onion/mushroom soup mix instead of the hickory seasoning & it turned out great!  I had no problems with these falling apart.  Will make again!!

I didn't add the mushrooms since I don't like them and we didn't have any hickory seasoning, but followed the recipe other than that and these burgers were awesome!  My husband loved how big they were (they actually fit our buns!) and I couldn't believe how good they were with the filling.  I'm sure we'll try out new combinations, but this one was great!!

This recipe originally was to serve 10 people so I changed the conversions to serve 4. This is an excellent stuffed burger recipe. I could not find hickory seasoning and not even sure what it was. I used a Gourmet Burger seasoning blend in place of it that is made by Weber Grills that was really good. I also added a 1/2 jalapeno, minced to the filling ingredients.

They were pretty good as far as flavor goes - but being that it was too windy outside to turn on the grill, I used my indoor electric grill; it was a greasy. No matter what temperature I put it at, the outside always burned before the inside was done. Much of it was probably because of the lack of a real grill, but I don't think that I want to find out.

Good. We substituted mozarella, fontina, and pepper jack for cheddar cheese for some of the burgers. Wanted to try something different. The Pepper jack and Fontina work better than the cheddar. But it's all up to personal taste of course.

I had high hopes for this burger but, okay to start the recipe for the stuffing it makes way to much. The burgers they tasted no different then a regular burger with the proper seasoning, and if you made the burgers thin to hold more of the stuffing the burgers ended up dry, to thick did not hold much stuffing  and you had to cook longer. Now with that being said I have a suggestion if you wanna make the same amount of the stuffing then add 2 pounds of the ground beef to it add 3 more tablespoons of the Worcestershire sauce and add 3 more teaspoons hickory season. Now make medium size burgers follow your instructions and enjoy. Or cut your stuffing mix down and make bigger burgers and still add the Worcestershire sauce and hickory. Remember this is my opinion.

I found that the burger could have used a whole lot more flavor.  If I decide to make these again, I will definitely bump up the hickory seasoning.  It was just ok

Our favorite way to make burgers.  A little hard to keep everything inside, though. Cheese usually starts to melt out.

WOW! YUMMY! I added bacon bits in addition to the ham, fresh garlic, hickory BBQ sauce, an egg and bread crumbs. The only trouble I had was keeping the burger from falling apart, but this may be because I have never made home-made burgers before.

Although I am a vegetarian, I made the stuffed burgers last night for family. They were huge! I substituted the hickory seasoning with chili powder as well and evryone seemed to enjoy them. Great recipe!
