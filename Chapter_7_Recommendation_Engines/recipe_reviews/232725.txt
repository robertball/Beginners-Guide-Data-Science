This is not an authentic jerk recipe but I think it is a good sauce. I decided to post after reading Beatrice's comment. A better alternate oil would be canola oil for those with peanut allergies. It is lighter than peanut oil, better for your health and doesn't over power other flavors.

Super easy and very bright, tasty flavor. I only gave it 3 stars because it is totally different  than any Jerk Marinade that I have ever experienced (even in Jamaica). So although it was tasty, it was not what my family and I were expecting from Jerk Flavors. Thanks for sharing!
