Yum! I mixed the lemon juice (1/2 cup) and seasonings together and marinated the chops for an hour rather than just dipping. I crumbled the feta and added it to the chops after I plated, and it melted just enough by the time we ate. I served them with Greek Lemon Roasted Potatoes and asparagus lightly poached in roasted garlic chicken broth. Fantastic!

If you are looking for an excellent pork/feta recipe PORK CHOPS w/ FRESH TOMATO, ONION, GARLIC & FETA (from this site) is the way to go.  It puts this dish to shame.  The key is to use thick cut chops.

Wow!  This was fantastic.  I actually took all the ingredients (just one lemon tho and more olive oil than recipe asks for) and blended them in a zipblock and let the porkchops marinate in the bag for a couple of hours.  Then I cooked the dinner according to the recipe and added all the ingredients all over again to the meat in the pan (less one lemon).  I minced the garlic, rosemary and basil and it turned out like a pesto, then rubbed it on top of meat. My husband raved about this meal as did I! It was sooo good.  I think the marinating the pork made a huge difference!

Execellent!  Lots of flavor.  Family enjoyed it.  I didn't have enough lemon juice (only about 1/2), but didn't need an entire cup.  Having the extra would make dipping easier.  I will definitely make this again.

By far, the best pork chop I have ever eaten. This is amazing and it will probably become one of my staple foods. I used a fairly well-seasoned cast iron pan and they seared beautifully. I used the jarred minced garlic with a little bit of it's juice. Wonderful!

Here are my changes: did garlic powder instead of minced, doubled the herbs, combined herbs and lemon and marinated chops for about an hour, had thin cut pork chops so I cut the time down to 2-3 mins per side - once I flipped them over I added the crumbled feta and let the cheese melt while the other side was cooking to prevent over-cooking them.  Then I let them sit for a about 5 mins covered.  Very easy and fast and tastes amazing!  I've made these before without marinating and they weren't as good.  I highly recommend marinating them - makes the flavors pop!  Served with long grain & wild rice w/ chopped red pepper and onion, and corn.

Delicious!!!!  The chops I used were really thick, so they needed a bit more cook time.  I ended up throwing the lemon juice in the pan to simmer until done...used the pan juice as a salad dressing.  YUM!

Definately loved these!  Then again, anything with feta is fantastic!  We made the recipe as-is and it had wonderful flavor.

TIP: After removing the porkchops from the skillet, mix in about a tablespoon of water and a teaspoon of lemon juice to the skillet and stir around the drippings - heat to a boil... and then pour that into some already cooked white rice.  It is a GREAT side dish with all the flavors of your pork chops.

Ehh, it was okay. I love feta and the combo was pretty good with the pork chop, but I wasn't blown away. It will be one of those "if that's all you have left in the refrigerator" recipies for me.

Unbelievable!  I used just-picked garden-fresh basil and rosemary, only needed juice of 1/2 of a large lemon for dipping, but poured the remaining lemon into the skillet as feta (used plain) was softening.  Be sure to scrape bits from skillet to top chops.  Mine were about 1/2" thick and boneless so I seared them about 3 mins/side and addtional 3 mins for feta.  Moist and mouthwatering.  Felt like I was dining out!

These are excellent flavors that blend well together. For extra lemony taste, try adding a few shots of lemon pepper. The feta was delicious on these chops. Thank you for the recipe!

Quick, easy and delicious.  I made exactly by the recipe other than cutting back a couple of minutes on cooking time since my chops weren't really thick.  I can think of all kinds of little variations that I want to try too, maybe add some diced baby port mushrooms or finely diced fresh tomatoes for garnish.  Thanks for sharing.

I also had to double herbs. I am not sure how much the lemon juice added to the taste. I would note to keep the heat on medium so as not to burn the herbs.

This was great! Everybody enjoyed it a lot. We used fresh basil and plain feta and it turned out really nice. I poured the remaining lemon juice in the pan with the pork and it helped keep them moist. I only used half of the amount of lemon juice and it still seemed plenty.

I love this recipe, but when I cooked it according to the directions, it came out overcooked and the feta cheese wasn't melted.  I made it a second time, but this time, once I turned over the pork chops, I went ahead and put the feta cheese on it then.  It seems to take about a good 10 minutes or so for it to melt.  (so, after the first flip, put on the cheese and cover)

These were excellent! I used fresh rosemary and added minced garlic. I also marinated them for a couple of hours first. Served it with a modified version of Greek Style Potatoes on this site. Great dinner!

I used the exact ingredients, then marinated my chops in the mix for about an hour.  I pounded the chops thin, layed the feta cheese in the middle & rolled them up, layed them in a roaster & poured the remaining marinade over, covered & baked in the oven. So full of flavor, even my fussy non-meat eating 12 year old went back for seconds!

For the ultimate in flavor, I highly recommend marinating the pork chops in 1/2 the lemon juice and double the herbs for one hour.

this recipe had a good start, the herbs, garlic and pepper on the chop is really good.  I was a bit disappointed in the cheese, it did not melt as I imagined that it would. although that may be my fault by using to much cheese. I will be trying this recipe again so it did not put me off.

Along with the Easy Arugula Salad this was a great main dish for our "Greek Night"! Next time I won't buy the thick Pork Chops and I'll double the herb rub mixtre. Try this -- it had a great flavor

Followed the directions although added more spices to our liking and used fresh basil vs. dried.  Moist and tasty - feta takes longer to melt so be careful not to overcook.

Nice blend of flavors, but cooking time needs to be cut down, otherwise the chops will come out too dry.

This was nice.  The recipe just didn't blow my mind, but it was nice.  I added Worcestershire sauce to the chops with the lemon juice and did a great sear (had to add butter for that and furthermore, who browns meat with raw garlic on it?  It would have burned to awful bits of black bitter--I used powdered.  Overall, nice, just not a repeat.

I am giving up on pork chops - they always come out tough.  I thought this recipe might be different, and I even followed several reviewers' ideas about marinating for a few hours.  Still not good.  Wish I knew what I'm doing wrong!

We loved these!  I placed my pork chops on a plate and let them marinate a bit in the lemon juice before putting them in the skillet.  They turned out very juicy and tender.  I added the feta cheese after removing the chops from the skillet and plating them.  Yum!

I have made this recipe many times now and even shared it with others.  Everyone has enjoyed.  It's a great way to change up boring pork chops with some really full bodied flavors.  Goes great with potatoes or just a tossed green salad with vinagrette dressing!

Really liked these. It was a nice change to have Greek style pork instead of chicken. I have made this a few times and I have to say the best was when I marinated the chops (as others suggested) and then barbequed them. The flavours with the grilling were deliciously enhanced.

This was delicious and very easy! I used fresh rosemary and basil instead of dried, which was wonderful, but I think it's the feta cheese really makes the dish. I only had two lemons (not nearly 1 cup of juice), but it was plenty. I served it with roasted potatoes, grape tomatoes, and asparagus. I would definitely make this again :)

Wow! I was a bit nervous about using Feta cheese, since I'd only seen it on the shelves at the grocery store before I made this dish with it...it was an excellent surprise! This was fantastic just as it was written--minus two pork chops I guess. We had this for supper tonight, and it smelled fantastic, tasted fantastic, was just all around fantastic. But, here's the catch: I felt that there was only enough seasoning to make the two chops that I made...for four chops, I would probably double it. I might also cut back on the cook time about 2 minutes on each side. I had some fairly average thickness pork chops, and I felt that they could have cooked on a bit lower heat for just a bit less time before adding the cheese (it would probably be the same amount of time total, I guess I would just shorten the time on one side and add the cheese earlier.) Have I mentioned this dish was fabulous??!

I got this as The Daily Dish and I needed to use up some feta cheese. I really enjoyed how fresh and easy this was. I didn't have rosemary, so I used some oregano, which worked nicely. Also, I didn’t use oil, and I used a nonstick pan instead. This would probably be good on the grill, too. Thanks!

I really enjoyed this recipe.  I think that next time I will buy a pork loin and slide it into medallions and proceed with the recipe.  I didn't change a thing and wouldn't - it's delicious as is.

WOW. I can't stand pork, and I used a really cheap piece of meat, but this looked so good I had to try some. Sauteed some onions first in some olive oil, then covered the pork in lemon juice plus a bit of soy sauce, really rubbed all the spices possible on the pork, cooked, sauteed some basil, tomato, and garlic plus the onion, topped it all on the pork plus some feta. MMMMMMM. This is a combo with the other pork/feta recipe on the site, with some alterations.

These were amazing. Instead of feta cheese I added sundried tomatoes on top. I also added fresh basil instead of dried basil. The pork was really juicy and flavorful.

These were fabulous!  Even my fussy eater of a fiance liked them!  I used plain feta, McCormicks All Purpose Seasoning, basil, sage, and garlic powder.  Tossed some potatoes with olive oil and the same seasonings, popped them into the oven on 450 for 15-20 minutes while I prepped the chops, browned them in olive oil about 3 minutes on each side, and finished everything off in the oven together another 10 minutes or so.  I will definitely be making this again.  THANKS!

Great recipe! Lots of flavor. Didn't need near that much lemon juice, however, and needed twice the amount of herb mixture.

As per one of the previous reviews , I marinated the chops in lemon juice. Found it a little tart so will try making these by dipping in lemon juice only. The spice mixture is good though.

These are AWESOME, don't be dismayed by those that say otherwise.  I marinated my chops for 3 hours.  After searing for 7 mins each side I noticed they were not at an internal temp of 145 degrees....so I cooked covered for about 5-8 mins.  Then put the feta on and covered for a few more mins.  I topped with parsley.

This was so good.  I chopped up the pork into bite size bites and just threw everything into a fry pan and sauteed it, adding the feta at the end with enough time for it to melt.  It was amazing.

This was so good! The only thing I did different was to brush the lemon juice on to the chops rather than waste an entire cup of juice. I had to use RealLemon, as I had no fresh lemons, but it was still good. I also didn't have the sun dried tomatoes, but we didn't miss them. For some reason, the feta didn't melt much, but it didn't matter. This is a keeper!

I used fresh sweet basil and fresh rosemary. The tart feta blended wonderfully with the flavors of the herbs. I'd make this for company.

I love all the indredients, but the feta overpowered the flavor from the herbs and the pork. I think it would be rather nice without the feta.  Perhaps paired with a side that uses some feta, like a beet salad.  The feta on the meat didn't work for us though.

This recipe was just okay. I like all of the ingredients for it so I figured it would be awesome. I think this recipe would be better suited for chicken.

This was DELISH! Next time I will marinate the chops in spices and lemon juice, but this had a lot of flavor.  I also added chopped sun dried tomatoes and sliced mushrooms.  I sauteed those in the pan for the last couple minutes the chops were cooking, and they added a lot of flavor!  Thanks for the recipe!!

This had a fabulous taste, and I didn't marinate it.  In fact, I only needed to use 1/4c lemon juice.  More would have been a total waste!
I used fresh basil (1 Tbsp).
I served it with salad and noodles w/ mushroom sauce.

I wanted this to be better. I will keep the idea of it, but will work on making it come together better. The herbs have nothing to stick to, so when you rub them on the meat, they cling a bit, since it's moistened by the lemon juice, but then you're instructed to sear the meat, which only seared the herbs onto my pan. There's no deglazing, so that's where they stayed. I'm going to play with the flavors and find a way to marinate the meat to get more saturation.

Pretty good! Ir was definitely different.  The feta cheese makes the dish...without it, the chops would have been bland!  Will make this dish again.

We had this for supper tonight, with some pan-fried potatoes.  The pork chops were very flavourful, and we all enjoyed the dish.  Would probably make again.  Tip: Resist the urge to put on extra feta cheese - a little is all that is needed.

I'm not a big rosemary person so I only used a little and still the flavor was excellent.  This is an easy weeknight meal.  I'm not sure why it calls for 1 cup of lemon juice.  I had plenty leftover.  Next time I will use 1/2 cup.

This recipe was SOOO flavorful! I did make some small changes to the recipe, though. I marinated the chops in the lemon and spices for about an hour in the refrigerator. I also added minced garlic and oregano per another users recommendation. The feta never actually melted, but it definitely gave the pork a nice little flavorful punch. I'll definitely be making this again! It's great for a change of pace.

Nice change from the ordinary.  I agree with others about not using so much lemon juice.  Just put about a quarter cup in a bowl and add more if needed so that you don't waste so much.  I would make his again!

Pork chops are usually so dry. These came out very moist.  I prepared them as instructed and put them in a large skillet and put in the oven with  foil for about 1/2 hour before serving.  I also added some tomatoes to the pan to give it a little more flavor.  It was good.  I'll make them again.

I thought this was only okay. I didn't have any basil on hand, so I used Italian seasoning instead. And I definitely didn't need the entire cup of lemon juice. My boyfriend and I thought it was a nice change, but we will never make this again.

Just made this for dinner.  It was great.  My husband claimed it was the best pork chops he ever had. I only had 1/2 cup lemon juice on hand, but, it was enough to dip in.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly.  Yum...

We liked this alot. I served it with sliced potatoes and salad and apple sauce. I tried to stuff the cheese in the pork chops but I bet the taste is the same for ones taht are just covered with it. Probably would be easier. Very tasty however.

OMG! My whole family loved this recipe, even my 3 daughters who must have ketchup wtih their pork chops!  I followed the recipe to tee except for the feta, all I had was low fat, but I added some basil to it and it was perfect!  I will definitely make again!  My husband is still commenting on how good it was.  Thanks for sharing!

We love this recipe!  I make my own feta, basil, and sun-dried tomato mixture and I think it does make the whole recipe a little bit more flavorful.  I usually serve this with a Greek or Caesar salad and some sauteed green beans.

Great recipe - higly recommended! I only used the juice of 1 lemon for 3 large chops, worked just fine and gives that really Mediterranean flavor. I served it w/cous cous, very nice match.

This is an awesome recipe.  A few simple ingredients, easy to prepare and the final result was fantastic.  I didn't use a full cup of lemon juice, but just sqeezed out one lemon and as I was only doing two chops this worked well.  Thanks for a great recipe.

This was very tasty and flavorful. I will definitely make it again.  Only next time I will allow 10-12 minutes for the Feta to melt. I expected it to look more like melted cheese than it did. Maybe that was my problem. The chops were a little dry because of it.

Really good - 7 minutes was a little too long to cook them though.  Reducing the cooking time, making the chops a little more tender = 5 stars!

I followed the basics, but made some changes. I didn't have any rosemary on hand, and I left out the lemon juice and used plain feta. I used Italian seasoning instead of basil, since that's what I had. Put the seasoning on the chops, browned them in butter for a bit, then added chicken broth and covered the pan. Took the chops out when they were done and added garlic and a little more Italian seasoning and pepper...reduced the broth a bit and added some cornstarch and water. I added a bit of cooked spinach in the sauce and on the chops and then topped them with feta. Turned out well. Thanks for the idea!

This was very easy to prepare and I didn't change anything including the cooking time.  It was right on the mark.  I wasn't crazy about this dish but my partner liked it alot.  If you like the ingredients you should definitely give it a try.  Thank you submitter.

This was a tasty and easy way to do chops.  I made these three days ago only changing the dried rosemary for fresh chopped rosemary and my husband just asked me to make them for dinner again today.  We had them with baked potatoes and Smothered Green beans - another recipe from this site.

The spices certainly compliment the feta cheese. This will become a staple in my house. Thats saying a lot since I'm a southern gal and if its not fried we aren't sure how to handle it.

My DH loves Feta cheese so I was very excited to try this recipe. He loved it! His only critique was that he thinks it would taste better with chicken.

This was a great quick and easy recipe. I made some slight adjustments: I used canola oil instead of olive oil and cooked the chops in a cast iron. I used crumbled feta without the basil and tomatoes, and added way more garlic. Great flavor, I will definitely make this again, however I will probably tenderize the chops next time, and use only 1 large lemon.

The pork chops were tender, flavorful and juicy.  The feta I had didn't have basil in it so I added a tsp of basil pesto to the top of the chop along with the sun-dried tomatoes.

I enjoyed the flavors and I went with marinating over night in a large Ziploc bag as I had really thick pork chops.  I could see using this marinade with other meats and even seafood without the feta cheese.

These pork chops are amazing! My husband asks me at least once a week to make these for him. I did do what another person suggested and I rub the spices on the chops then I marinate them in 1/2c. of lemon juice for about an hour, and the flavor is wonderful.

This was a very good and easy recipe. I used pork tenderloin pieces instead of chops, Started cooking the pieces in the skillet for 2 minutes on each side and then but the skillet into a 400* oven for 20 minutes until they registered 170*. Delicious!

This was awesome!  Very easy to make (on a day when grilling was risky) - I also marinated in the herbs and lemon juice for one hour.  Delicious, tender, moist and full of flavor - the house smells wonderful!  Elegant enough for company but easy enough for a week night.

I'm usually not a big fan of pork chops, but since my husband loves them I have to make them occasionally.  I made these tonight, and I LOVED them!  The flavors just worked perfectly together, and it was super easy to make.  My husband might get pork chops more often now that I have this recipe!

The pork chops came out amazing!  I changed it recipe up a little just because of personal taste and what I had on had. I marinated them for about an hour before cooking.  The fresh lemon juice makes a big difference. I also added italian dressing when I marinated them and used garlic powder instead of fresh garlic.  They were so good and I will be making this recipe again and again.

Wow!!  My husband and I loved it.  I kept wanting to eat more even after I was full.  Very moist and the flavor is zingy enough to be yummy but not overwhelming.  I'll be making it again soon and for company.  Because I knew we liked lemon, garlic and pepper, I put the oil in the pan then added extra garlic and pepper to it as well as 1/4-1/2 cup of the leftover lemon juice.

Restaurant quality! I use dried or fresh basil and sun-dried tomatoes with plain feta in mine - the more intense tomato flavor is excellent.

This was very tasty.  We love feta in our house so we put a lot more on than called for.  My toddler really enjoyed it too.

We love Greek food, so I was delighted to find a new, great sounding recipe to try.  Unfortunately, even upon taking other reviewers' advice and marinating the chops, they were quite tough. We loved the flavors, so I may try to modify this recipe for my crockpot.  Thank you for submitting!

This was easy to make and my two year-old actually liked it! (I liked it too). I used thin fast fry pork chops and should have scaled back the spice rub a bit. I will continue to make this exactly as it says... just a little lighter on the spices! By the way, sundried tomato and basil feta is yummy!! Thanks.

The problem with pork chops in general is that they are often too dry.   I like the flavoring of these pork chops and the feta cheese was great, but they were still dry.   Sometimes I think the best way to cook pork chops is with Shake and Bake because that coating tends to seal in the moisture better than most other things I have tried.

I should have listened to the other reviewers and marinated this, but due to lack of time, I didn't. I followed the recipe exactly except I used fresh rosemary. This dish wasn't bad, the flavor was good, what there was of it. I think it just was lacking becuase I didn't marinate it. If I make it again, which I might, I will definitely marinate the meat.

Per the suggestion of other users, I also marinated the chops in the lemon juice and herbs, for about 45 minutes.  The flavor was so delicious and the meat turn out so moist...even when I reheated the dish for lunch leftovers!

I took the advice of others and let it marinate for a while.  I added diced onions to the marinade and threw the whole mixture into the pan halfway through cooking the pork chops.  It was really good poured on top.

Quick and easy.  I used fresh rosemary and basil from my herb garden.  Instead of dipping the pork chop in lemon juice, I drizzled it on top.  Very tasty!  Will make again!  Thanks MBC!

This was pretty good.  I did marinate the chops in the lemon juice with spices for about 30 minutes prior to cooking.  Also heavily sprinkled them with garlic powder, basil, salt, and pepper while they were cooking.  Topped with feta during the last minute or so.  Served with Roasted Potatoes with Greens.

Yum! I am fairly new to the cooking world (26 years old, yes it's sad) and this was the perfect starter recipe! I would have added cut up fresh tomatoes and onions to the skillet- but that's a personal taste! It went really well with Uncle Ben's wild rice and iced tea... great summer dinner! :-)

My husband doesn't like pork chops so I used this recipe with real lemon halves and grilled chicken slow on the BBQ. I put the lemon halves on top while they were cooking and they squeezed out a great little lemon sauce. SO VERY GOOD. I love this recipe.

This was a great base recipe that can be adjusted according to what you have in your cupboard. (I love recipes like this!) I used Penzey's Bouquet Garni mixture of savory, rosemary, thyme, oregano, basil, dill, marjoram, sage, and tarragon. I did not marinate in the lemon juice due to a lack of time, so the pork chops got a couple of quick squeeze of lime juice (all I had) and then in the fry pan for a quick sear. I really liked the citrus on the pork chops. (Who would have thought??) (The spices added a little flavor - but did stick to the fry pan.) Of course, no feta available - and substituted parmesan. The pork chops were moist - and very tender. Thanks for sharing - I had no idea I would enjoy this dish so much!

My wife and I loved this one, the lemon and sun dried tomatoes toped with the feta cheese was a very pleasant combination. I have added this on to my favorite pork chop recipes.

This was an AMAZING dish that my entire family LOVED. I had to modify it some(the amount of ingredients and increase the cooking time), as to feed my large family, but it was still GREAT!! This is a dish that I will be fixing regularly. What a simple, yet tasty dish!! It tasted gourmet!! YUMMMMMMMMMMMY!

Excellent recipe. My family enjoyed it very much! As several revievers mentioned, I marinated the pork in a mixture of lemon juice and spices for about an hour, which infused it with even more taste.

the pork chops were great! the feta was a perfect addition. I served it with some creamy garlic and feta mashed potatoes and it was perfect. the leftovers sure didn't last long. without measuring the feta, I think I added a little extra, but the more the better!

Very flavorfull recipe for pork chops. We didnt have any basil and tomato feta cheese to use, instead we used regular feta. We cant wait to try this recipe again with the basil and tomato feta.

I would give this 5 stars, but I didn't exactly follow the recipe.  I used oregano and rosemary, marinated the pork for about an hour and used lots of plain feta.  I think next time I'll follow the advice of the reviewer who deglazed the pan and used the drippings on rice.  It seemed a shame to waste them!

VERY tasty - I love feta but not a big meat fan. This was so tasty that I ate way more meat than usual.  My young, picky, kids did not care for the seasonings.

Yummy, but I didn't use any of the lemon juice.  I used pork tenderloin that I cut into thick slices and rolled into the herb mixture.

This was an excellent dish! My husband and I are big fans of Feta especially in a sauce served over meat. So this was a good recipe for us. We also loved the blend of herbs. So very yummy! My kids even ate it without complaining ;)

My husband and I loved this one.  My daughter wasn't real fond of it, but only because she didn't like the layer of spices on it".  The aroma while cooking this was heavenly and it tasted just as wonderful.  I served with steamed brocolli and red potatos with butter and parsly.  I will definately make this one again.

It was a tasty change in the weekday menu, however my husband comment was : "it was not the best thing you've made". He's my ultimate food critic. It was lacking something; it was just not that interesting.

Loved the recipe!  My family of picky eaters all liked the flavor and the pork chops disappeared for once.  Stuffed the chops with some of the cheese and it added an extra layer of wow to our thick chops.  We will use it again.

A tasty and easy to prepare pork chop recipe. Like others, I reduced the amount of lemon juice - I used less than 1/4 cup. I used fresh basil and rosemary (both chopped very fine). I will make again.

I am always looking for something different for pork chops, and this was good. My children didn't like it, but it was good for the hubby and I.

This was SO good! And easy. I'm not that big on pork chops, but now I have a good reason to make them more often. Thanks for the great recipe!

This was just okay, I used center cut chops and they were a little tough.  Might give this recipe another shot with a different cut of pork or chicken.

These were wonderful for dinner tonight. I don't normally make pork chops since I find most recipes bland or requiring some creamy sauce. These were very tasty and no cream sauce! I am adding this one to my recipe box.

Delicious!  If you choose thick chops you have to up the heat a bit and cook quite a bit longer.  A meat thermometer helps!

I didn't change a thing with this recipe (which is unusual for me!) and it was fantastic! I served it with a recipe for Garlic Broccoli Spears that I found on this site, and the fiancee RAVED about it. I'll be making this one again soon!

This was acutally pretty good.  I loved the color with the spices, cheese, and sun-dried tomato on top.  Feta takes quite a bit of time to melt so be sure not to over cook the pork.  I added about an extra teaspoon of the spices b/c I like to really taste my spices.  Will probably make again.

Delicious flavor! The only thing I would change is the cooking time.  The chops came out a little tough from overcooking.

This was just okay.  I only dipped my chops in the lemon and the lemon overpowered the meat.

These were okay--I thought they needed more herbs and my husband informed me he likes his pork chops plain.  Easy to make.  Probably won't make again.

Very simple to make, omitted the feta cheese and served with steamed jasmine rice.  Delicious!  My only suggestion is to reduce the amount of lemon juice, using just enough to soak the chop. Thanks for the submission!

Wow. This was tasty. My only regret is that I didn't tenderize (pound) the pork beforehand. I just forgot to. Soooo good, though.

This was really good!  I bought extra thick chops so I cooked them longer.  I shouldn't have - I think if I followed the directions exactly, they would have been perfect.  Even though mine were a bit dry - the flavor was very very good!

I haven't used a lot of feta cheese before, but these turned out really great, and gave extra kick to already great pork chops.

The only reccomendation I have is use fresh herbs instead of dry. Spread them on and they will stick like a paste.  This was the best chop recipe I have made yet.
