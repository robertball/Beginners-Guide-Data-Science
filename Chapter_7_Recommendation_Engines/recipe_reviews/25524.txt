This is addictive with a few changes. I made as written, but it was way too much citrus....sour. I doubled the tuna then and added fresh ground black pepper. Ate with Ritz crackers. Sooo good and I even forgot the dill weed. I added about 1/2 tsp dill weed in the morning and it is beyond delicious!!!!!!!!!!!!! Try it with my changes! UPDATE: we ate a half batch so fast so the next day I made a double batch. You have to go easy on the citrus since not all lemons and limes are the same size or as juicy. I also used fresh cilantro instead of dill weed.

It is a good recipe and easy to make. I did not have green onions and used parsley and thyme instead. Also I omitted olive oil. The result still tasted good with crackers and carrots!

As written, it was 1 star because the citrus flavor was overpowering and the rest of it was bland. But I added another can of tuna, more dill, a few shakes of hot pepper sauce, onion powder, garlic salt, parsley paprika and salt. With all the seasonings and the citrus diluted, it was yummy.

Close to what mom made when I was growing up. She always served it with Fritos which is a really good combination. The olive oil really makes this!  I added some heafty shots of pepper sauce.  Yummy!

I liked this. As written, it was too tangy and didn't have enough flavor. I used only 1 small lemon and 1 lime, and that was plenty tangy. I upped it to 2 green onions and garlic salt instead of plain salt. I made a mistake and only put one 6 oz can of tuna and thought it needed more tuna. However, after reading the recipe again, I realized it said 12.5 oz can, so I added another can, and that was plenty. I ate this with crackers and tomato slices for a light lunch today.
