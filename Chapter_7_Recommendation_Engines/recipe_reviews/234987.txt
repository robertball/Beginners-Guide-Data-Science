Made this for Christmas, reduced servings to eight and made it in an 8 by 8 inch square baking dish! Everybody loved it, didn't have any unsweetened cocoa for garnish so I made chocolate curls from a large chocolate bar with a vegetable peeler!  Definately try this recipe! You won't regret it!

I haven't ate it yet, because it's in the fridge, but I wasn't a fan of the recipe itself. The milk mixture was really liquidy. But I accidentally got ladyfinger cakes and not cookies, so when I dipped them in the coffee, it broke when I took it out. So instead I placed them in the pan and poured coffee over them. DON'T MIX UP THE COOKIES AND CAKES!!! This tip might save you money and time in the long run.

Great recipe! I layered ladyfingers as suggested, but I added an outside wall of ladyfingers around the serving bowl as well. Added a lot the presentation.

This was my first attempt at Tiramisu, and I thought that it turned out well. It was fast, and easy. No electric mixer was necessary, because I used whip cream instead of whipping the cream myself. I used vanilla waifers instead of lady fingers because they were not available at my local grocery store. I dunked them, but in retrospect I would have also sprinkled Baileys over the top to make the cake even more moist and delicious. I disagree that there was too much sugar in this recipe; I might even add more next time! Cool Whip makes a great topping :)

THIS IS A REALLY GOOD AND EASY RECIPE, I GAVE IT A 4 BECAUSE I THINK IT HAS TOO MUCH SUGAR.  NEXT TIME I MAKE IT, I WILL REDUCE THE SUGAR TO 1 CUP.  BUT OVERALL, IT IS SIMPLE AND TASTES GOOD.

This was really liquidy and cloyingly sweet. I didn’t know if I was supposed to put the milk in after soaking the cookies or not so I just did.  I’m not a fan of this at all but I’ll give it 2 stars because it was fun to make with the kids.
