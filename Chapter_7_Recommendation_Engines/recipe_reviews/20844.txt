I doubled this recipe for two servings. I used frozen strawberries because I wanted to omit the ice as well as lactose-free whole milk. My kids both liked this, though my oldest thought it needs more strawberries. This turns out a very thin strawberry "smoothie" so keep that in mind when you make this.

What a great milkshake! And all i did was add all the ingredients into a Thermomix for 30 seconds and you have a brilliant milkshake!. I've tried some good shakes in my time but this has to be the best! Thanks

I added a scoop of strawberry ice cream, a little cranberry juice and pinch of sugar to it. It didn't have too much taste but it was okay.

This was a little bland. It needs to be sweeter.

A good healthy alternative to milkshakes; this is really more of a smoothie. It wasn't quite as sweet as I like it to be, so I added a splash of orange juice. I loved the vanilla-honey aftertaste; it made it seem much more like a milkshake. Yummy and healthy; I would make it again.

This milkshake was pretty good. I had to add 1/3 cup of sugar on top of everything else to make it sweet enough. I made four servings, but they were really big - enough to fill a tall glass. Each serving calls for one cup of milk, and I was supposed to put in four cups. My KitchenAid blender wasn't big enough, (which is pretty big!) so I could only put in two cups. Very filling, however! Thanks.

I used the basic recipe but used fat free milk and some splenda instead of the honey to make it less calories but still had the great taste......

It's pretty good, but I had to add more honey to sweeten the deal.

I used 1 1/2 Tablespoons of sugar instead of honey and kept everything else the same. I love it, tastes like strawberry shortcake.

Very strawberry-y.  I added some extra honey and sugar.  A different taste from milkshakes made with ice cream.
