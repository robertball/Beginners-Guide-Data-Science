Well to be honest....I made this as a joke on my family. I know but we have an evil streak when it comes to our humor! But let me tell you...it is wonderful! The joke was on me! I used self rising flour and omitted the soda and salt. I didn't have any buttermilk so I just used 2% instead. Other than that I didn't change a thing. Oh I rinsed the kraut many many times then I took kitchen sissors and cut it up very fine. My kids won't eat coconut because of the texture...I was trying to avoid that. It almost looked like a chocolate mousse when I poured it into the pan. I didn't know what to expect. But the house sure smelled good. It cooked for the full 45 minutes. Afterwards I trimmed the top so I would lay flat on my pan. I didn't tell one about the kraut and the kids went to town on it! You can see the kraut just a bit but not too much. They loved it. Very moist and good especially warm. We won't frost this one...and I'll be sure to make it again and again. This one is very much worth a try!

Do not be scared! Live a little and step outside the box; these are fantastic! I followed the recipe w/2 minor alterations: 1. I made as cupcakes (baked for right around 20 min a batch and the recipe made 30 cupcakes for me) and 2. I never have buttermilk so I used the milk (1% at our house) and vinegar substitution. I should probably make it known that I'm NOT a from scratch cake fan; I tend to prefer Duncan Hines box mixes so I baked these more for the novelty of the sauerkraut w/low expectations...well they certainly exceeded the low bar I had set! These are great! great flavor...I'm not sure what the sauerkraut does (some bites I felt I could get the barest hint of sauerkraut but maybe it was all in my head) but these are def worth trying! I frosted w/butter cream (butter cream II from here actually) but next time I think I'll try w/either a cinnamon-y or a caramel or a PB or a mint frosting (the possibilities are endless!) thanks to the suggestions of wonderful RE members.

I had to try this because I love sauerkraut and the thought of putting it in a cake just tickled me. I was saddled with the task of making a cake for a going-away party for a co-worker and thought I would make this as a revenge of sorts. I very roughly chopped the sauerkraut because I was going to put coconut frosting on the cake anyway and figured that if anyone got some stringy bits they would just think it was coconut. Nobody suspected anything. I got nothing but rave reviews. Even when I got a piece of what I knew was sauerkraut and bit into it all I could taste was chocolate. This cake is so delicious and chocolatey. I recommend it to anyone who wants to try something different!

The thought of putting sauerkraut into a chocolate cake was crazy but the taste was amazing. This recipe makes a excellent cake and a must try. I topped it off with a coconut frosting and if my wife didn t tell our guest that it had sauerkraut in it they would have never known.

I made this cake yesterday mostly out of curiosity. I followed the recipe except I used half dark and half lite brown sugar. I used a chocolate frosting and baked it in 2 9" round cake pans. It was simply delicious! Keep in mind when choosing a frosting the cake itself is only mildly sweet. We loved the unique texture and flavor of this wonderful cake. I will make it often!

The idea of sauerkraut in cake is revolting...but you HONESTLY cannot taste it in here. It being in the cake has about the same affect as putting applesauce in. I nearly tossed my cookies at the thought of me seeing a strand of kraut in my cake so I put it in the food processor before adding it and I liked that a lot better. I frosted this with a coconut/pecan icing and everyone liked it. I would have given this cake a 5 because it was really moist and had a nice soft texture but it just wasn't very chocolately.

Didn't care for this one.  My kids weren't fooled and immediately thought it tasted strange and wouldn't eat it.  My hubby liked it, but he is from Wisconsin and LOVES sauerkraut.  Maybe it would be less tangy with a lesser amount of sauerkraut?

Made for my husband for his birthday and he really enjoyed along with my boys. Nobody in my family particularly likes sauerkraut but curiosity got the better part of me and I wanted to see if anyone would notice. (They were very suprised when I told them) Will definetly make again. Thanks Jane

I've made this quite a few times - and my family loves it! (although my brother only until he found out about the sauerkraut - the third time I made it -now he won't touch it!)

I made this for an Oktoberfest get-together with friends... everyone gave it rave reviews and were surprised to learn there was sauerkraut in the recipe. Unfortunately I have an allergy to anything chocolate and couldn't try it. Would definitely make this again.

This was the BEST chocolate cake I have ever made! It baked up beautifully too. I used 2% milk ilo buttermilk and Smart Balance 50% butter sticks ilo butter. I made it for a coworker's birthday and they love German Chocolate. I topped it with homemade frosting from another recipe on this site (that I changed a bit) and the result was FANTASTIC! YUM!

This recipe is a keeper! I don't remember the last time I had a chocolate cake that was as moist as this one. It appealed to the adults in the house because it was not overly sweet. Took the advice of other reviewers and used a coconut-pecan frosting so no one noticed the sauerkraut in the cake. I knew this was a good recipe when hubby had two slices after dinner and then told me to put two in his lunchbox. Just a note I made it in two nine inch round cake pans and it makes a good size layer cake great for any occasion! Great recipe Jane thanks for sharing.

This was a very moist cake. The sauerkraut really does not impart a flavor just the texture of "coconut." The cake itself is somewhat flat and chalky. If I were to use this idea in the future I would add the sauerkraut to another cake base (e.g. box mix cavity maker cake).

I made this recipe mostly out of curiosity because I couldn't imagine sauerkraut in a cake. But it was very good! I chopped the sauerkraut so that it wasn't long and stringy. It had the consistency of coconut which went well with the German Chocolate frosting. Very good and I would make it again!

This was a really moist delicious chocolate cake. I served it to colleagues and they all loved it -- no one could believe there was sauerkraut lurking in there. I'll definitely make this one again.

this recipe makes wonderful mini bunt cakes. I love the sceret ingredient. My co-workers loved the cake anf fliped when the found out that it was sauerkraut in the cake. I add more sugar to make the cake sweeter. Am going to try to add German Chocolate in place of the regular Cocoa Powder. I had a proble with over baking make sure to be accurate with the baking time.

I didn't care for this recipe. I had trouble getting the sauerkraut to mix well (even though I did chop it first) it tended to clump. The end result wasn't very chocolaty. I was intrigued by the sauerkraut in the recipe but I won't make this again.
