I tried making this recipe in cupcake form instead, and it turned out great!  Just grease and flour the muffin tins, and only bake it for 15 min. at the same temp.  It makes 24 cupcakes, but make sure you ice them once they've cooled, or else they get REALLY messy!

MMMmmmm!!! These were the most delicious banana bars! I followed the directions and ingredients for the batter to a "T". The bars rose up a bit while baking and smelled like "bananas" in my house. They were done in 35 minutes. The bars had a light brown color with flecks of maraschino cherries baked in. I set the bars aside to cool while I made the frosting. Instead of vanilla extract I replaced it with banana extract for more banana flavor. I added the confectioner's sugar, to taste, and the milk, to desired consistency. After I frosted the bars I sprinkled some finely chopped walnuts. The bars were moist, flavorful and just banana-y good! The bars look and taste more like a light and airy banana cake (not bread). The banana flavor is pronounced in the bars complemented by the sweet maraschino cherries. I couldn't taste the pineapples and forgot it was even in there. The frosting is light, buttery with a banana-y flavor. It is sweet without it being overly sweet. I found the directions, baking time and servings all spot on! I think the next time I bake these I will add a little more cherries. This was an absolute joy to bake and eat.

These are incredible banana bars.  I took these to the teachers' lounge at school and had several requests for the recipe.  They are very moist, and all of the flavors work so well together.  I topped my piece (I always try to sneak one piece) with hot fudge sauce, and it was wonderful.  One of the best banana recipes I've tried!

These are terrific! I only made the cake and we ate it without frosting and they didn't need it. I did double the cherries and next time i'm going to add 1 cup of chocolate chips.

Pretty good.  I added 1 cup of chocolate chips.  I couldn't taste the pineapple that much and I wish I had doubled the cherries.  I like the frosting and enjoyed these bars in general.

The recipe took longer to cook about 45-50 min & was not good!  Too sweet & doughy.  Very disappointed.

Yum! I added a little extra pineapple and it was STILL hard to taste!  I also put regular cream cheese frosting on it to save time but added crushed pineapple, chocolate syrup, nuts, and cherries to the top as a garnish that really helped bring out the whole theme/flavors.  Also, i only baked it for 30 minutes and it probably could have been taken out a little earlier than that (i used an aluminum pan and electric oven)!  Really yummy though. My husband loves it!

I will definitely make this again. Just love it. I followed the recipe, except I used cream cheese frosting from Pillsbury, and added chopped walnuts over the frosting.

Super easy to make... I made no changes, except to add a bit of food colouring to the frosting.

A yummy banana cake.........while the flavor of the bananas over-powers the taste of the cherries and pineapple, they still add an interesting texture and color (the cherries do) to the cake.    The frosting is good too.  I will make this again sometime in the future, though the calorie content makes it  a treat for special occasions where it can be shared with many others.  Guess that's my way of saying that it was too available for me to eat it, since there're only the two of us in the household!   Back to counting calories......

omg what an amazing recipe, tasted just like a banana split!  I followed the recipe exactly, just quartered the cherries instead of putting whole ones into the batter.  I needed a little more icing than the recipe called for, so I just added a little more of the ingredients until the taste and consistency were good.  I added walnuts on top of the icing while it was still warm, then after that cooled I drizzled Hersheys hard shell syrup on top and added more walnuts.  The only con of the recipe is that the bars were really messy, next time I'll leave it in the fridge for a few hours before serving to see if that helps.  A must try recipe though, perfect for summer. :)

These didn't work for me.  Followed recipe to a "T" and they were mushy and bland in the middle.  Too bad, I had high hopes for this one!
