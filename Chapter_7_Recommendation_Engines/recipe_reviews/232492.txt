Quinoa is so healthy! I did a little adjusting to make this an organic recipe. I didn't have apple sauce so i put a Pink Lady, un-peeled, into my food processor & pulsed, then I added the bananas & pulsed some more. I used all organic ingredients & substituted Sucanat for the brown sugar. Sucanat is dried sugar cane juice, an organic brown sugar. Pulsed everything in the processor till the dough was throughly mixed & then stirred in the chips by hand. I'm a little anal about the look of my food so i used i scoop. The cookies don't spread when they bake, so for the second batch, I flatted them out. These cookies are a KEEPER! So good! Thanks...

Super easy to bake! I recommend giving them a bit more texture with some nuts (pecans, walnuts, hazelnuts, cashews, or Brazilian) and add some hemp seeds or sunflower seeds. If you want them a wee bit sweeter, just add more coconut flakes and use one cup of chocolate chips instead of 3/4 cup. Enjoy!

This was a super easy recipe to make! Any chance I can make a healthier version of something I do it! I didn't have any applesauce so I substituted it for vanilla and honey Greek yogurt. Turned out amazing! Will definitely be making these again soon!

I'm giving this 4 stars, not only because I loved the cookie, but because the recipe turned out exactly as stated.  My only change was to use dried cranberries instead of chocolate and I added some cinnamon - both of which was just a personal preference. I always keep a container of cooked quinoa in the fridge so I used 1-1/3 cups because I didn't have to cook it up first. I made the first batch 9 cookies without the berries to see how they would cook up. They do not spread so you drop as many on your cookie sheet as you want.  I preferred them cooked in a little mound, makes them crunchy & chewy.  I see some reviewers said the batter was too thin. I had no trouble with mine at all, and the bananas I used were quite large.  By the time everything was together it looked like a thick oatmeal coconut batter. (altho I did mix wet ingredients and dry ingredients separate, then mix together) I think the difference may be in the measuring technique between users.  If the flour, and to some degree the oatmeal, is more aerated the batter will be thinner. Liquid measure is always more exact. Personally, I always scoop my measure cup into the container and then level off. If you have a problem with consistency then just add a bit more dry ingredients as you might be measuring differently than the person who posted the recipe. An FYI, 1/4 cup of apple sauce replaces 1 egg in baking recipes, in case you don't have apple sauce; and I always use a rice cooker for my quinoa 2:1 liquid:quinoa

I made these cookies following the recipe to a "T", with two small exceptions. I added about 1/2 cup of raisins and split the flour 50/50 with AP and organic whole wheat. They aren't the prettiest cookies, but they're quite tasty considering they have no eggs or butter. The texture is like a chewy muffin and I wouldn't recommend adding any more chocolate chips or sweeteners- they were plenty sweet for me. Going to freeze them as the recipe made 31 cookies! I will make these again.

Loved this recipe and the results! It was so easy to make (I guess just a bit longer to make since you have to cook the quinoa) but I did as the recipe said and just dumped everything in a bowl and mixed. No sifting, not extra bowls, then measured and cooked! I thought they tasted really good and my kids (ages 5 and 2) did as well. Warning though, they did smell like quinoa when baking, but didn't taste like it when cooked. Even the raw dough was delicious! Thanks for the recipe!

OMG!!! These JUST came out of the oven, and they are absolutely the BEST! I made this recipe exactly as called for ! Wouldn't change a thing, but will vary it next time to maybe adding more pieces of apples, and raisins just because I like them. They baked perfectly!!!! Thank you so much for this recipe, my bag of Quinoa has been sitting in my cupboard for awhile unsure of what to do with it now I know the GO TO cookie recipe for awhile! :)

This recipe is better than expected.  I searched forever to find a way to get quinoa into my diet.  This recipe is one I will keep.  I have tossed boxes of quinoa before due to recipe failure!  Not this time.

I was impressed with how easy these are, however I got almost 40 cookies out of one batch. The recipe says a yield of 18.....must be huge cookies as mine were average size of a packaged cookie.  At any rate it just gives my family more goodness.  They are nice and crunchy on the outside and chewy on the inside. My daughter really liked the raw batter and I am sure she will be pleased with the finished product.  Like another reviewer, I didn't have any applesauce so I just peeled an apple and pulsed it in the processor with the banana and peanut butter. I also substituted the brown sugar for coconut sugar, added in all the remaining ingredients and pulsed until well blended.  Yum!!

Great recipe for healther cookies for kids. It taste like a granola bar. I added 1 cup cornflakes to add some texture and firmness to it because the mix was on the mushy side. I also adjusted the flour to 1/2 cup AP and 1/2 c. Wheat flr. 
Overall, good healthy cookie. unfortunately, my 3 year old didnt like it though.

These are great! I ended up using almond butter on my second batch and adding walnuts and raisins and using oat flour instead of AP flour. Both batches were amazing and gone within a day. Thank you for the recipe!

I actually really like these cookies. The reason for 3 stars is that as it is written, the dough comes out more like a batter than a cookie. I had to add more flour and oats to get it to the right consistency. But they are delicious and a hit with my kids!

These cookies are a hit!  My daughter and I are always on the lookout for healthy snacks for the family.  This fit the bill nicely.  The kids (and the rest of the family) love them! 

I agree with others that the 18 cookies must have been huge.  I used a melon baller to scoop them and made at least a couple dozen.  They were not around long enough to be counted, though.  I also adjusted the bake time due the the smaller size.  12-13 minutes was plenty of time.

A final note.  My husband does not like peanut butter, so I substituted cashew butter.  I think any nut butter will do.

The cookies are delicious.  I did not pack down the brown sugar and I only added half the amount called for of chocolate chips and they are plenty sweet. I added 1/2 of chopped walnuts and 1/4 hemp hearts as well.

These are delicious and healthy. I wanted to incorporate quinoa into my 1.5 year old’s diet and saw this recipe on the app and made it, we all loved the cookies. And it’s so easy to make for a busy mom.

These are very good!! I followed the recipe exactly except for the banana.  Mine were just ripe so I only used 1. They turned out beautiful golden brown but were moist in the middle. I will definitely make these again...May let the kids try the next batch! ;)

My husband loves these cookies which is surprising since he doesn’t like quinoa.  I used vanilla yogurt instead of applesauce since I didn’t have any. Instead of the sugar I used 3/4 tsp. of Stevia.  The second time I have added some cranberries.  Think it might give it a nice taste.

These are easy to make and this recipe lends itself to lots of different add-ins and variations.  Thanks for a great way to make a healthy, filling snack/dessert!
I used one cup of leftover quinoa. I also subbed 1/2 soft whole wheat and 1/2 AP flour and didn't use the full amount of coconut.  Added some walnuts, too.
My batch made 35 cookies and baked for 20 minutes with multi-rack convection oven.

Holy wow, these are delicious!  The first time I made them, I didn't have any applesauce so I used a little extra banana and some coconut oil, and they turned out amazing.  I have also made it as written with applesauce (along with adding walnuts), but I think I prefer the texture and moistness of the version with coconut oil.  I have also found that they do not need 20-25 minutes of baking time, and that a few minutes less is best (18ish minutes), but maybe I am making my cookies extra small.  The texture is very unique and makes me feel like I'm eating a muffin top!  Thanks to the original poster...this one is a definite keeper!!!!

Excited to make this, then realized I didn't have any plain quinoa, just a Sprouted Rice & Quinoa Blend.... but I used that anyway and they are fantastic. Sprouted rice just added some different texture & colors but didn't affect the taste at all. Will definitely make again, though I'll try with almond butter (too peanuty for me). Great base recipe for adding nuts, dates etc. next time too.

These came out great! Texture was a bit mushier than I expected, but baked into nice, soft and chewy cookies. Left out the coconut since I didn't have any, but these are already so flavorful from the other ingredients.

Loved this recipe. I didn't change anything but I did add flax, chia seeds, pecans and hemp seeds to it. And it turned out awesome. I did use whole wheat flour as well instead of white. This cookie recipe will not only be a keeper but a regular in my house!

Being the health nut that  I am,  this already healthy recipe I altered slightly to increase nutrition by adding 
2 tbsp ground flax, doubled the quinoa to 2/3 cup, changed the flour to 1/3 cup white flour, 1/3 cup wheat flour and halved the salt quantity.
Then folded in a mixture of chopped cashews, peanuts, raisins and little chopped apple pieces.
An unusual recipe this was from the start for me but I give it FULL 5 stars for its healthy factor and its versatility and ability to experiment with to  make many different flavored cookies from this  cookie base.

Come out good, at least I like it! It is soft inside, not sure if it supposed to be or not.  I modified it a little, instead of apple sauce I put 2 apples in microwave for 3 minutes and then blended them with bananas. Also I did not add peanut butter, but I added cranberries and crushed pecans.  Come out a lot of cookies!

I did not think this cookie was going to taste as good as it did.  Very yummy and fairly healthy.  I did add more chocolate chips than the recipe called for, 1.25C vs. 3/4 C.  But overall, this recipe is a winner!

These really are fantastic and are easy to make slight modifications to. They are now in our favorites collection. Hubby actually decided they'd be better named kitchen sink cookies cuz they have so many really good ingredients worth mentioning (they were a hit at a party). 
My mods were basically adding less sugar and making it turbinado sugar instead of brown sugar and topping off the cookies with a pecan, one each. 
I must have made mine smaller.... a double batch yielded almost 6 dozen cookies.
YUMMMMMMMMMM!

Followed the recipe exactly and these turned out really well.  Very easy to make and the kids made short work of the results.  I would have gone five stars, except that there a few other recipes that asked for in the house a lot more that are healthier and tastier so in comparison ...

No butter, no oil? Doesn't get any better than that! Followed recipe to a T.  First tray I 'dropped' onto sheet with cookie scoop, second one I flattened slightly with a fork as another reviewer suggested as they do not spread.  The consistency either way was great - and as an added bonus, even my teenagers liked them.  One batch does make quite a few, I think I got 32? Will absolutely make again.

I substituted the brown sugar with pure maple syrup.  I also added a little cinnamon and made half without the chocolate chips.   In the spirit of all of the recent election promotions, my 10 year old son said "My name is Ryan B***, and I approve of these cookies"
That sounds like a thumbs up to me.

These are delicious!  I didn't have any applesauce, so I pureed a fuji apple  (skin on) with the bananas in my food processor.  Also, I left out the chocolate chips and added a handful of raisins and chopped walnuts.  Baked for 20 min., and they came out perfect.  I will definitely make these again, and experiment with other ingredients like other fruits and nuts.

OMG! These were amazing! I didn't have a few of the ingredients like peanut butter so I ninja'd three kind bars, I also had to use coconut extract instead of real coconut and chocolate syrup in place of chips.... My cookies came out so amazing regardless! I can not wait to make them with all the right ingredients!!! Then they'll be to die for! Seriously, this was a really great recipe I can't wait to try again! Highly recommend!

I made this recipe as written and was quite pleased--interesting flavors; much more "complex" than the average cookie.  I'm also looking forward to trying different combinations of fruits, such as cherries, blueberries or cranberries.

mmmmmmmm so good!!!!
I made a few changes as suggested by other reviewers and these cookies turned out great!

I used 1/2 white flour and 1/2 wholewheat flour
Added 1 tsp cinnanmon
1 cup raisins 
1 cup cornflakes.

I mixed all dry ingredients together then added to the wet ingredients (i guess old habits die hard!)
Baked at 350 for 12mins.

I made 32 cookies but could probably strech to 40 easily as mine were medium sized i think if i used a teaspoon to drop them onto the tray i could probably get a batch of 40 at least.

Everyone loved them (even the picky eater)these are definately a keeper and are going into my recipie folder.

Good recipe will make again! Consider cutting the time to 15 minutes. My first batch was burning on the bottom by 20 minutes. 15 minutes is perfect. I used red quinoa and instead of using all purpose white flour I used Bobs Red Mill whole wheat pastry flour for the whole amount. Turned out great. My son and husband are picky and reject healthy food and LOVED these. Gone in seconds...

Absolutely delicious!! I used PB2 peanut butter to cut down on fat, and dark chocolate morsels instead of semisweet chocolate chips.  I was able to make 50 in a batch and after entering the ingredients into My Fitness Pal, each cookie came to 85 cal.  All 4 of my daughters AND my husband loved them!! Thank you!

I added less peanut butter to mine, and did half quinoa flour and half regular. Also used 85% dark chocolate bar, crushed into chunks. Came out delicious and had the taste and texture of a high quality health bar. Great for breakfast on the go.

Very tasty!  The cooking times were a bit long for me... Even at 19 minutes they were slightly burnt, otherwise I'd give it 5 stars. I wish there was a good alternative to the brown sugar... Maybe I'll try some molasses and honey next time.

Good!  Darn good!  I added a cup of crushed cornflakes (Honey Nut to be exact).  I think next time I will replace the chocolate chips with cranberries and see how that goes….maybe throw in a few white choco chips too!  Thanks for the recipe!

Great recipe!  I substituted chopped dates and golden raisons to make 3/4 cup for the chocolate chips.  I added 1 cup of walnuts, 1 tsp of cinnamon, and 1 cup of grape nuts cereal.  Sweet and crunchy--really good!

These cookies are awesome! My boys (both under the age of 4) loved them and kept saying "Mmmmm,mmmm" the whole time they were eating them. I didn't change anything, but I did mix the wet and dry ingredients separately before combining the whole thing. I had some leftover quinoa that was already cooked, and I read online that quinoa quadruples when cooked, so I added 1 & 1/3 cups of it. I also cooked and mashed my own apple for the applesauce, and used whole wheat flour. As other reviewers had indicated, I also got 36 nicely-sized cookies out of this recipe but I think I could have stretched it to 48. Thank you so much for posting this recipe! It will be a family favorite for sure! I love that it sneaks fiber and protein into dessert without the fat. Next time I am going to cut back on the sugar and see how that works out.

Excellent recipe ~ A little bit crunchy from the oats, a little cakey. Great flavor ! Added a touch of cinnamon and nutmeg. YUMMY !! Will be a staple in our house for sure :o)

Delicious! I made the recipe exactly as written with one exception: I used 1/2 C of chocolate chips. I got 24 cookies out of a batch but could have stretched it to 36.

Decided to make these for my niece who has a nursing infant and is trying to delete dairy and chocolate from her diet to see if it helps him with his upset tummy.  So half were made without the chocolate chips. I followed the recipe as written but added some chips after baking half of the batter.  They were awesome even without the chips and I love chocolate in my cookies! I forgot about this recipe and made them again. I didn't have shredded coconut so I put some chocolate covered pieces of coconut in my food processor.  These cookies are awesome!
