I made this tonight and with a few minor tweaks, mine turned out fabulous! My advice: START WITH A ROUX as others have suggested. I melted some butter, sauteed diced garlic and onion, added some flour, and then whisked in the broth and milk (I used equal parts broth and milk - makes it more creamy). Add pumpkin and bring to a simmer. I didn't want mine to taste like pumpkin pie, so instead of the cloves and cinnamon, I added white pepper and cayenne pepper. These two really rounded out the savory flavor and gave it just a hint of heat. Also, plenty of grated parmesan cheese! I didn't want to stop eating it. Will definitely make again.

LOVED LOVED LOVED this recipe! I could eat it everyday it was THAT good! Even my DS said I should make this at thanksgiving. I love pumpkin ravioli and this just reminded me of it kind of inside out. I can't wait to try the sauce  with cheese tortellini! I made a 16 ounce box of pasta and it is all gone! no left overs! Thank you for a great recipe. will treasure this one!

Good, not great. I also thought the sauce should be a bit creamer. Mine came out a bit soupy. However, it was easy, good, healthy, and inexpensive. Definitely worth a try, and you might love it. My mother could not get enough of it and thought it was fantastic. I used minced onion instead of onion powder and olive oil in place of the margarine. I think if I made this again, I would start with a roux as one of the other reviewers suggested. I could see kids liking this as it has a mild flavor. I also increased the servings to 8, which called for a full pound of pasta, a full can of pumpkin, and 2 cups of broths -- much easier measurements. I don't know why the recipe is written for 3 people. Seems like a odd number and throws all the measurements into odd amounts as well.

Yum! This was very good! I used some fresh pumpkin puree that I had in the freezer - and I think I may have used more than what was called for.  I added a little ground sage, just because I love it with pumpkin or squash, and extra parmesan.  This could easily be made more decadent with cream or butter - maybe starting with a roux for the sauce - but I appreciate that this is a pretty healthy dish as stated!  Thanks, ConnorsMom!

Mmmm, so good.. I used a tablespoon of butter and doubled most of the spices (probably tripled the nutmeg) as per others' suggestions. Served with shells instead of penne so as to really soak up the flavour and it was perfect!

I really wanted this recipe to work out, but it didn't. The sauce was way too soupy. I would recommend making a roux before if you are daring enough to try this.

Made this to serve tonight as a side dish to a roasted chicken. I read some of the other reviews and was worried about it being too thin or soupy as they refer to it. I decided to use evaporated milk instead of the skim. I use this in macaroni and cheese always for a creamier thicker result. I was also prepared to cut back on the broth. I made it as written only subbing evaporated milk for the skim and added about 2/3 of the broth. I let it simmer and it kept thickening, and I continued to add the broth. Eventually, I did add all that the recipe called for. As another reviewer suggested, I simmered it for longer, maybe 20 minutes, very slow simmer. With the evaporated milk and the longer simmer time it will get as thick you you want. Just simmer until you like the consistency. Very pleased with that. I doubled this, even though tonight it is for a side dish serving 2. It should be nice for tonight and some for lunch tomorrow, minus what I tasted. :) I used fettuccine, because I like it better. My husband usually prefers penne, but he's not home now and not cooking. Either would be nice. I tried it before adding the cheese, and didn't love it. The cheese needs to be there, even if you just add it to the top. It's a nice change from red sauce or Alfredo and very autumn-like. Thank you Connorsmom for sharing!

This was a great way to use up extra pumpkin and make a low-cost meal with things I generally have in my pantry. After reading reviews I decided to add some caramelized onions to this. I substituted veggie broth for the chicken broth, plain soymilk for the milk, cheddar for parmesan, and skipped the margarine and onion powder. Some reviewers have mentioned that this was too soupy. I cooked this down for a while and also added extra cheese which seemed to combat that issue. I will certainly make this again and would love to do so when I have some sage in the house to add to the sauce. It was almost like inside out pumpkin ravioli which is one of my favorite dishes when we go out to eat. I'm so glad I can get something close to it at home without a huge amount of work.

This was great!  I modified the recipe after reading other reviews.  I used 2 Tbsp. butter instead of margarine and made a roux from 1/3 red pepper, 1/2 vidalia onion, 2 cloves garlic (all minced)and 1 tbsp. flour.  I added 1 c. each of half&half, chicken broth and pumpkin puree and let simmer on low-medium for about 10-15 minutes until sauce was nice and thick. I used more savory spices:  nutmeg, sage, thyme, ginger, black pepper, cayenne pepper, (about 1/4 tsp. each-- a little more ginger and sage for my taste) to taste, and a pinch of ground cloves I added the 1/4 cup parmesan cheese.  The last few minutes of cooking I added grilled chicken breast 1 cup diced (you can add more if you like.)  I served over whole wheat rotini pasta...yum!

Love this! I made some alterations...I left out the margarine but used 2% milk. I also went a little heavier on the spices and added a tbs of brown sugar...

I served over egg noodles and mixed in some cottage cheese....very satisfying lean dish...

I also made a roux, which u should do anyway. Half & half instead of milk, real butter, no pie spices, extra cheese, & I added browned Italian sausage & fresh parsley & sage. I'm sure it's good as printed also ;)

I have not tried yet but the pumpkin puree part sounds a lot like my recipe for pumpkin soup. I would recommend either making a flour rue first with some butter and adding in pumpkin puree with condensed milk and maybe a little chicken broth to loosen if necesary. I would also balance the pumpkin pie spices with a little dried sage to give it a little savory note.  Top with toasted slivered almonds.

I made this as stated, except for the replacement of chicken broth with veggie broth. I liked the creaminess of the sauce and the parmesan cheese, but it just seemed a little plain overall. I don't even know what I would change. Anyway it was OK. Thanks for the creative recipe :)

This was way too bland. We ended up adding about double of the spices and it still needed extra cheese. I will not be making this again.

Doubled entire recipe and pretty much quadrupled all the spices, plus added sage to taste and subbed a dry white wine for 1/4 cup of the broth to round out the flavors. Used heavy cream instead of milk and margarine, hey it was going to go bad in my fridge and it tastes AWESOME! Served over Barilla veggie pasta (macaroni, though would work with any pasta) with grilled chicken breast. AMAZING new Fall entrée, with my additions!

Surprisingly good! I didn't have pumpkin so I used canned yams, and it turned out great. I also used multi grain pasta and it really complimented the dish well! It was nice to have something different from your everyday pasta!

This was wonderful. I loved everything about this recipe. It was the perfect blend of savory and warm, and the pumpkin provided a hint of sweetness to the sauce. 

Great for a weeknight meal.

This was amazing. I combined several other reviewer's ideas such as starting with finely chopped onions sauteed in butter. I used soy milk (because that's what we have) and added a splash of heavy cream that was on hand. I subbed sage for the pie spices, which made the flavor more savory.  I didn't make a roux but stirred a tsp of potato starch (we're gluten free) into about 1/4 cup of chicken broth, then added it to the simmering sauce. It didn't get thick but added some body. When I combined the sauce with the brown rice pasta I used, the pasta soon absorbed the sauce and it looked a lot like mac and cheese. I also totally spaced out adding parmesan, but the result was still fantastic.  It's probably just as good made as directed but I gotta say, I LOVE a recipe that can be successfully modified. Next time I will sauté asparagus and mushrooms to go with it. Thanks ConnorsMom, I'll be making this a lot!

Yummy! I have made this before (from a different recipe) and it was definitely not as good. This was very good, though I did cook the sauce a little longer than recommended and I think it helped thicken it some. Also, I had to use dried minced onion b/c I didnt have onion powder but it didn't seem to make any difference. I used pumpkin puree that I made - last fall and kept in the freezer - from a buckhead (?) pumpkin. I think the type of pumpkin puree will make a big difference in the flavor!

It was a nice alternative to the "typical" pasta dish, but I thought it was a little bland.  My 13yo daughter didn't care for it.  I might try it again for myself, but following the advice of another reviewer who started with a roux, and changed the spices up a bit to include cayenne.  Thanks for sharing something different, though because variety is the spice of life!

This just wasn't for us.  I thought it was far too peppery and without the Parmesan cheese it's just bland.  My sauce was also quite soupy. I think it has the potential to be a really good sauce, but I'm not in love with it enough to search it out.

This recipe needs tweaking so the sauce doesn't come out too thin. It needs more spices too.

I should start out by saying that I adapted this a bit, based on other reviews, and while it was good, it still seemed to be missing something. Perhaps a bit more savory to counter the spices? I don't know. Here's what I did:

I sauteed onion and diced ham prior to adding ht rest. I doubled the pumpkin, used 1 c. broth (already very liquidy!) and 1/4 cup milk, added 2 TB. of plain yogurt to amp up the creaminess, doubled the salt, pepper, and onion powder, and used 1/4 tsp. of cloves, nutmeg, cinnamon, and ginger. I think it got a bit clove-y for my taste. Next time I'm going to keep working on the spice combination.

Recipe was amazing. Started out blan but added a few spices. As others stated, I started with a roux to make the sauce thick and less soupy. I sautéed onions, garlic, carrots, and 1 small sweet pepper and then added some cornstarch to make a nice roux. I then added low sodium chicken stock, pumpkin, and soy cream. For the seasonings I used salt, pepper, garlic powder, pinch of nutmeg, pinch of cinnamon, cayenne pepper, fresh parsley, a pinch of sage and ALOT of parmesean cheese. I served it over wheat bow tie pasta. Really really good. Next time I think I will add roasted chicken or some type of chicken sausage.

I made some alterations and it was creamy and delicious!  I sauteed diced onions, garlic and butter in a pan first.  Then I added 1/2 cup chicken broth and 1/3 cup coconut milk (unflavored/unsweetened) and cooked over medium heat for a few minutes.  Next I added the pumpkin and spices (I used about 1/4 teaspoon of each spice and added ground sage too).  It was really easy, healthy and I will definitely make it again.

Love this dish!  I did add-on a bit.  Sauted two sliced leeks, asparagus spears and field peas with evoo (substituted margarine).  Tossed it with all remaining ingredients and topped off with crushed black pepper.  Extra healthy!

I enjoyed this dish, my kids weren't to thrilled with it though. I doubled the recipe and used a whole can of pumpkin and a pound of pasta. I thinned out the sauce with a little cream since I was using more pasta. Thanks for the recipe.

I enjoyed this recipe, but I modified it a bit. I used the Roux that Megamuffin said to add and it tasted great. I also added about 1/4 cup of maple syrup and that added a bit of sweetness.  Update... This time I did not begin with a roux but instead added freshly shredded Parmesan cheese to thicken up the sauce and let it simmer for another 5 mins. Delicious! Either way is great.

This was awesome!!  I added a head of cauliflower (chopped) and increased the sauce slightly to accomodate the cauliflower.  I omitted the cloves (personal prefrence) and added a little garlic powder.  It looks just like mac n cheese and my 5 yr old LOVED it!!!  The spices don't make it taste like pumpkin pie at all, its very yummy!! :)

This was a great base recipe. I made a few tweaks to it, added chicken, used heavy cream instead of skim milk, sauteed onions instead of onion powder, and added mushrooms and green beans. Super simple to make though, and I will for sure make it again! I'll have to remember dried cranberries, so I can add those in too!

This is a great base recipe for pumpkin pasta. I ended up making a roux and adding bouillon cube to it, then adding the pumpkin puree and spices to that until I had the desired flavoring for the sauce. Added sausage and fresh onions instead of onion powder. It was very good and relatively inexpensive to make. In the future, I think I might add some white wine to the sauce.

Needed a dinner idea and had bow-tie pasta homemade pumpkin in the freezer, and this recipe came to the rescue!  I gave it four stars only because I followed the advice of the others and among other things, started with a rue. Added chopped onions, garlic and fresh ginger along with the other spices in the recipe. Also added some thyme which was great in there. Oh, used half-n-half rather than milk. Lastly I tossed in a handful of kale that was hanging around and VOILA! a simple, cheap & excellent dinner. We'll definitely be putting this one in our meatless-Friday dinner rotation. Thanks much for posting this!

I really liked this recipe. I made this with some Delicata squash that I steamed, then pureed. I did think it was a bit soupy at first, but I stirred it into the pasta and let it rest for a bit and the soupiness was totally soaked up. I also added some Swiss Chard sauteed with garlic, and would recommend adding garlic to the recipe whether you add the greens or not. Will definitely make this again. Thanks ConnorsMom

Moving this recipe into my fall rotation & will repeat without changes to the recipe. It has the pumpkin pie spices without the sweetness normally associated with pie. Would definitely be good to serve to a child.

Delicious! I’ve made this several times now, and like some other reviewers, I prefer to make it more savory by omitting the cinnamon, cloves and nutmeg. I’ve also found that starting out with a roux with the butter and flour before adding the rest of the ingredients, makes the sauce creamier.

I give this 3 stars for ease of preparation, nutrition and the fact that it is fairly inexpensive to make. I followed the advice of others and made a roux which gave it a nice texture. As for the taste, the seasoning just didn’t meld for me. I tried to salvage it by adding more but it just didn’t work. I won’t be making this again, but I will continue to search for similar recipes.

Like others. I think this might be an acquired taste. It’s weird to me but others think it’s great. I’m not about the whole sweet pasta. Reminds me too much of a pie.

I had just pumpkin pie spice that I used instead of other spices in recipe, which I don't measure things when cooking so I would say I went by taste and it all turned out good enough that I will be making again.

I liked the idea of this sauce, but I wanted something savory. I kept a couple things but changed the recipe and made my own version.  Mine uses smoked paprika and a couple dashes of Cayenne pepper, plus some fat free sour cream to tame the heat but keep the flavor.  I will submit mine later.  BUT if you're looking for a sauce that your child will like, because this is a sweeter sauce, your child will probably like this better than my version. :)

Gave it 5 stars after quite a few changes.  For sauce I melted 2 T. butter and sauteed a small ch. onion and 2 ch. garlic cloves until onion was soft.  Then I added 1 T. flour and cooked it for around 1 min.  Then I whisked in 1 C. chick. broth, 1 C. fat free 1/2 & 1/2 and 1 C. pumpkin. Then I added 1/2 t. ground ginger, 1/2 t. sage, around 1/4 t. cinnamon. I did not add cloves.  I let it simmer for around 10 min. just until it was the thickness I wanted. I added in some cooked ch. pumpkin spice chicken sausauge. I grated parmesan cheese over pasta after it was on our plates.

Even after adding sauteed garlic and onions and adding more spices including sage and cayenne I found this to be blah. I love pumpkin and really wanted to like this. Maybe needs smokey sausage.

I made a roux first as others have suggested and used the recipe more as a guide instead. To start, I fried some bacon, added a little butter, then onions, garlic, celery and diced bellpeppers. Once the veggies are fragrant, I coated them in flour. I used evaporated milk to start making the roux. I also saved a cup of pasta water in advance and dissolved a boullion cube while it was still hot, then poured it slowly to the roux. And I added grated parmesan and quezo de bola (ball of cheese). Once I got to the consistency I liked, I mixed in the pureed pumpkin. I thinned the sauce down with some water, then seasoned with salt and pepper to taste. I saved some of the celery leaves as garnish.

I did make the recipe as stated it is VERY bland. I did use 1/4 c evaporated milk instead of nonfat it does make it thicker. A lot of people said it was a thin sauce evaporated milk is the key to the thickness. I added the 1/4 c & kept adding a little at a time till I got the sauce I wanted.  I added the parmesian cheese to the cooking sauce. I added 5 tsp of brown sugar. Handful of shredded sharp cheddar.With this tweaking it came out awesome. My daughter is a vegetarian I tried the recipe because of her.She said it was great. I am happy I found this recipe it gives her something else to eat.

I'm sorry!  I really wanted to like it, but, although edible, it was very bland.  Neither my husband or kiddos went back for more and we ended up with a ton of leftovers.  I tried to doctor it for another meal but alas, this just isn't for us.

Guess I prefer my pumpkin in a dessert or bread. Kids wouldn't eat it, and I don't blame them. Recipe was easy enough to follow and I first made a roux as suggested. Just not for us unfortunately.

I started with sauteed leeks finely chopped instead of onion powder and used chicken broth and reduced it down to strengthen its flavour and didn't use the milk and margarine ( who uses margarine any more?) and I put in a dollop of goats cheese instead of parmesan (to make it dairy free) and a a few tbsp of balsamic reduction, now it has a little kick and a deepened flavour.I also added diced chicken.

I used about 1/8 cup of plain greek yogurt instead of the milk and a bit of cheddar instead of parm.  But I still topped it with parm and a little crushed red pepper.  Also, instead of all the different spices I just used salt, pepper, and pumpkin pie spice (which isn't sweet actually).  I didn't think it was soupy.  I would like to have added some crumbled spicy sausage, but maybe next time.

My husband and I thought this was one of the most original, delicately flavored recipes we had tried in a long time. I wanted the sauce to be thicker, so I replaced the chicken broth with a Tbs of bullion. Otherwise I followed the simple recipe to a T. I used home-grown pumpkin, so that could be why we found the flavor so delicate.

This is SUPER easy and so YUMMY! 
I did make a few slight changes... I started with a roux, as suggested by a few others. I also used fresh onions(instead of powder) and fresh pumpkin puree. -Super simple to make, btw... Cut a pumpkin in half, take out the seeds, place it face down and bake it for about an hour @ 350. Then you just scoop out the innards and put them in your food processor or blender. Voila!!
I also added a handful of baby 'bello mushrooms and some fresh rosemary. SUPER YUMMY!! Thank you for sharing!

I substituted light cream for milk.  I also added brown sugar and agave nectar.  I used pumpkin pie spice rather than the individual spices and kept adding to taste.  I made it with bowtie pasta.  My kids really liked it.

I loved this pasta, I did not have the time to puree pumpkin and used pumpkin pie filling instead, it was a little sweet, but we all loved it. The sweet actually tasted good with the Parmesan.

I made this treat for my wife who I knew really wouldn't like it 'soupy,' so I changed the recipe in the area of chicken broth, nonfat milk, and margarine. 

I made a roux of 2 tbsp melted butter, 2 tbsp flour, and 1/2 cup whole milk; cooked it a couple of minutes to thicken, then added the pumpkin and continued heating while mixing it well.  Then I added only enough chicken broth to get the consistency I wanted.  All of the seasonings were added as suggested in the recipe. 

I joking call my wife a 'food snob' because she really likes flavorful food, and plain dishes DO NOT get a favorable review. This Pumpkin Pasta was a HIT!  She really liked it!  Definitely will make again.

Was ok - nothing special. Will probably not make again.

For me it turned out pasty and bland.  I tried so hard to get it to be more flavorful that it was almost overspiced on top of the blandness.  The bites with plenty of cheese were the best.  Started with a roux as advised by others, but once I added the pumpkin it was just a battle to get it to taste like much while trying not to let it get too thick.

Doubled recipe. I thought it was bitter and bland.  I am going to add more chicken broth and honey and turn it into soup. I will then add some pasta.

Well, I had to modify it a bit, as I had no chicken broth. So I used Condensed cream of chicken soup, and a bit of water to equal 3/4 cup of broth + 1/4 cup milk. I was also out of cinnamon. This turned out wonderful, and made a great lunch for me and my 4 year old
