This base recipe resulted in an absolutely delicious broccoli cheese soup. I really like two things about this recipe. First, it uses natural cheddar instead of  processed cheese. Second, it used a variety of vegetables to add depth of flavour, not only broccoli, but potato, celery, onion and carrot. That said, I did do some things differently from the recipe. Of course, I added salt and pepper. I also added about a teaspoon of thyme (dried) and a large pinch of nutmeg. I cooked the vegetables  for longer than  20 minutes to ensure they were tender, and also cooked the flour and butter roux for 1 to 2 minutes to ensure there was no floury taste to the soup. Served with crispy garlic toast for a lovely warming dinner. Thanks!

Such a tasty recipe.  I have made it 3 times.  I know my husband likes it when he starts chopping vegetables for me.  I stuck to the basic recipe without any changes.

This was very good! I used a chicken base in place of the bouillon so played w/the amount a bit. Added salt & pepper, to taste. I liked the addition of the potatoes & carrots w/the broccoli!

Delicious! I also added cauliflower and bacon. I made the rue by saut√©ing the onion in bacon drippings. I omitted the potato and added extra cauliflower and broccoli. Will be making this recipe again!

This was a great recipe and it's really easy to make. I did change a few things to make it better. I added cauliflower and bacon, it took it from great to wow!  I also upped the amount of water to 3 quarts, the bouillon to 5 cubes, the cheese to 3 cups and the milk in the rue to a full cup. Don't forget the salt and pepper since its not seasoned at all.

One of the things that I love about making soup is that a good basic soup recipe is very adaptable and forgiving, so you can make adjustments according to your tastes and what ingredients you have on hand. This is one of those recipes. It will work well even for beginning cooks, can be adapted as you wish, and is absolutely delicious. I started with this recipe as my guide but made some changes: I didn't have any celery, so that was left out. I added about 3/4 cup of frozen corn, some minced fresh rosemary, about a cup of diced lean turkey ham, and a generous amount of fresh ground pepper. I wanted to reduce the calories and fat, so I reduced the butter by a third, the cheese by one half, and I used almond milk (plain - don't use sweetened or flavored almond milk for this) instead of whole cow's milk. I'm sure the full amount of butter or cheese would make a really rich soup, but we did not miss it at all. Even with the lesser amounts of butter and cheese, this soup was delicious. With all of these changes, I ended up with about 10 cups of soup, a healthy 166 calories per cup, just under 10 grams of fat per cup, and very satisfying and filling. Pair with a salad and you'll have a wonderful healthy meal full of fiber and nutrients!

We enjoyed this soup...even my Veggie hater. I followed the recipe, but changed one step. I knew one of us would not eat it with vegetables in it so I boiled them in chicken stock for about 35 minutes To make them very soft. Then I pureed them with my inversion blender until it was smooth. A blender or food processor could be used instead to make the puree.  The result was a good base for the soup, and helped to thicken it. The carrots gave it a color similar to cheese. Voila! All vegetables hidden. I followed the rest of the recipe as written.  Ingredients I changed were few. I chopped the broccoli stems and  used only one third of the broccoli heads with the vegetables 
I boiled. I cooked the remaining broccoli heads in the microwave and them put them into the soup after I pureed.  I had 2 Oz of processed cheese product to use up so I put it in. The soup didn't need it though. It was rich and creamy and had a better cheese flavor before I added it.next time I make it I may add some herbs.

I followed it almost exactly only to add more milk and pepper at the end.  I also used my blender to puree it but next time I will leave it a bit chunkier than smooth.  I love it and fixed cornbread to go with it.

Very flavorful.  I used this recipe very loosely, but I think the creator had a lot of good ideas. It's an easily modified soup.  I used twice as much broccoli, homemade frozen chicken stock, and leftover frozen mashed potatoes (cleaning out the freezer!).  I added a few cloves of garlic and added some thyme and celery salt (since I didn't have celery on hand).  I know it doesn't seem like followed the recipe but I did follow her directions for preparing the "broccoli stock", the roux, and when to add the cheese.  Oh after I made the "broccoli stock" I blended it all up (helps if my daughter can't see individual veggies to pick out).  It was very good and I'd make it again, but next time I'd use less cheese or maybe none and just sprinkle on individual bowls.

Very flavorful, easy and stocked with vegetables.  I didn't measure the vegetables, just eyeballed them, and used homemade chicken stock rather than the bouillon.  I liked that this had milk rather than cream.  Thanks, Janna for sharing your recipe.

I thought this was very good. I substituted chicken broth for the bouillon as I did not have the cubes and I prefer chicken broth and added water too. I pureed it a little bit as I like it a little smoother and thicker. Basically, all the components were there and it turned out great. Loved the idea of the carrots and potatoes. It just adds that much depth to the flavor and consistency. I will be making it again.

I have made this many times. My whole family loves it. My kids are very picky, so I admit I replace the celery and onion with onion powder and celery salt (cringe). One of my go to favourites and freezes well too in case you want to double the batch.

I really enjoyed this recipe, mainly because it left a lot of room for creativity in the flavor department. I was out of potatoes, so I didn't add any obviously. It's really good with two or three spoonfuls of pesto, I find that basil and garlic go really well with broccoli based foods. I added more salt, as well as a few other spices: as thyme, sage, and nutmeg. What spices you add, and how much, really depend on your taste.

This turned our pretty good.  I love that it's not to rich.  It's like part broccoli cheddar soup, part potato chowder. I really like that. Next time I would add ham or clams to this.

I love a good broccoli and cheese soup, but finding just the right recipe has been difficult.  Maybe it's  because I grew up in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan that this soup really speaks to my soul.  I was looking for  a good soup to use up a bunch of holiday leftovers and this certainly did the trick.

This was exceptional! I followed recipe exactly except that I left out celery because I don't like it and used low sodium buillion cubes because I'm on a low salt diet. Lovely for a winters day.

I followed the recipe as directed but would suggest less potatoes, if any, and add more broccoli. Also, smaller carrot bits next time and I think that would make it taste more like a broccoli soup rather than a cheesy vegetable medley.

This soup is excellent.  I love broccoli cheese soup and adding the other veggies and the potatoes made it very hearty and yummy.  I seasoned it with salt, pepper and garlic when it was done and it was perfect.  My husband and sons loved it.

Just wow!!  Simple and quick, which is very important to me, and I only added cilantro, smoked 0, and a dash of my dear friend Tony's hot pepper powder.

I followed the recipe almost to a tee. The only thing I did differently was use chicken broth instead of bullion cubes and I cooked the roux a couple of minutes before adding the milk. I also added salt and pepper. It tasted blah. Like nothing. I added bacon bits to liven it up. Then ended up adding garlic cheese croutons for some taste.

I made this using frozen potato cubes, frozen chopped broccoli, and a bag of frozen carrots, onions and celery (soup starter)...so quick and easy.

I didn't have any celery so I added extra broccoli, potatoes, and carrots.  I also used chicken broth instead of water and bullion cubes.  Finally I seasoned it with some garlic powder.  This was a huge hit with my husband and son... Both went back for seconds.  Will definitely make this again.  Very easy.

I really enjoyed the depth of flavor though I added 1 too many bouillon cubes after reading a a few reviews about needing more salt. Ahh well. I'll be making this again!

I sauteed the onions & garlic in butter then added bite size chicken thigh pieces & cooked through, put aside. Simmer/boil the vegetables in chicken stock, then puree half or all of it. Add the chicken bag in, the veggies, then the cheese.

I used 4c vegetable broth and pureed it (to get the veggies past my kids).  It was plenty thick and didn't need the sauce.  I kept the milk for creaminess and also added garlic, salt and pepper.  Oh, I also used sweet potatoes.  Great recipe that is very flexible and a MAJOR HIT with my kids!  This is a new staple in our house.

Simple and quite tasty. I had some cubes of cheese leftover from a party, so I substituted them for the shredded cheddar (mix of cheddar and pepper jack), and I had vegetable broth on hand so I used that in place of the bouillon and water. It seems like it would be so easy to adapt to other vegetables.

I used a grated sweet potato instead of white potato. I also used velveeta and 4oz cream cheese instead of cheddar. Fantastic.

We used chicken broth rather than the cube. Next time, I will add another 2 cups of broccoli because it really came out as a cream of veggie soup more than a cheesy broccoli soup. However, we did enjoy it and there will be a next time. Thanks Janna.

Didn't follow the recipe exactly but it turned out liked a broccoli cheddar soup from Au Bon Pain or Panera Bread! I doubled the recipe. I used two chicken bouillon for the doubled recipe but added seasoning salt, kosher salt, a little paprika and a dash of cumin. Also, used a little less cheddar. Should have added more broccoli. I like broccoli.

Very easy recipe! And it turns out really great everytime - although I make it slightly different every time the base is definitely a great place to start! 

Most recent additions:
I used a beef broth instead of bouillon, just because it's what I had at home but it was just as good. 
I also added a red pepper and some extra spices of choice, to add to the taste - recommended.

Love this recipe. I used Better than bouillon concentrate
Instead of regular bouillon and added fresh diced garlic. Such a big hit family wanted it again a couple days later
