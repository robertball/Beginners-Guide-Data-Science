I made this for my father-in-law and I was surprised how well it turned out.  I just couldn't believe this "no flour" cake. It was very good but you really need to like pecans !!!

My husband and I love this recipe. We ate 1/2 of the cake in the first day. It seems to be full of protein with all the eggs and nuts and not many carbohydrates similar to angel food cake. We put strawberries on it and that was great also. Try it for a light summer dessert.

This was okay, but nothing to write home about. I wouldn't make it again, but everyone ate it. Too much trouble for not a very tasty cake. The information at the top of the recipe is incorrect--ground nuts freeze very well. So does the cake, if you can't finish it in a reasonable amount of time.

this cake is great! i used a 9x13 inch pan instead, and it only took 30 min in the oven (still at 350). 

my only problem with this cake is that i cant find aa good icing for it...  maybe some kind of maple frosting would be good?
