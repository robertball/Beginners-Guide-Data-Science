This was ok. It was very sweet and kind of missing something. Next time I would make it a 1/2 cup of soy sauce instead of 1/4 like the recipe called for. Sesame seed and green onions on top after they're cooked might also help.

My teenagers agreed these were the best I've ever made. Followed recipe exactly, but didn't have time to marinade. This one is a keeper!

These were very good and very easy to make.  I marinated them for one hour, but next time I think I will marinate overnight.  I doubled the ingredients and the flavor was spot on!!  They weren't overly sweet and the soy sauce did not overpower the other flavors.  I did add a little season salt and pepper, but that's just because I like my meat seasoned. My husband had seconds and thirds!  He'll be looking for these most weekends.  Thanks for a simple and delicious recipe!

This was soo yummy! Everyone in the family loved this chicken. I followed the recipe but I used garlic powder, onion powder and yellow mustard instead. I found that with this recipe that the chicken tasted better with the chicken seasoned with pepper and season-all. One thing about this is that you need to make the marinade a second time half way though to pour over the chicken during and after cooking. It really caramelizes nicely and really brings out that flavor. This will be a family classic at dinner time at my home.

Fantastic flavor! I didn't have time to marinate, i just used it as a sauce on top. Added a little cornstarch (mixed about 1 Tbsp with about 1/3 c water and stirred it in). Coated the wings for the last 20 min of baking, and reserved some sauce for extra dipping.

These came out great.  I let them marinate for 1 hour and the chicken had plenty of flavor.  I will be making them with boneless chicken breast chunks next time.

These were some of the best wings I've ever made. I didn't have fresh garlic so I subbed powdered. Yummy!

Was amazing made it twice.  I did however use the big chicken legs. Marinate over night then put them in a roaster. First one I tried it I left the skin on. Second time I took the skin off then pierced the flesh and it absorbed the flavour whole lot more. Once cooking was done turned the left over sauce into thinker sauce and put it over top to make it just a bit more sticky. Everyone loved it

WOW! These are absolutely amazing! Even my pickiest eaters devoured them! It's hard to find a recipe that 2 adults & 5 kids love, but we found one! The only thing I changed is I added 6 cloves of minced garlic & no need to marinate. I think this cut the sweetness down but it was perfect. They completely fell off the bone & melted in our mouths! I made white rice for a side & poured the leftover sauce on it & made the rice unbelievably delicious! This is a keeper. I can't wait to have the leftovers tonight!

These were so good!  My picky husband loved them!  I didn't  chop up an onion - I just added a handful of minced dried onion.  I did add a few shakes of hot sauce to the sauce, but I don't think it was needed (didn't hurt it though).  I probably marinated in the sauce for about 2 or 3 hours and then poured everything into a non-stick aluminum foil lined pan (trust me - line the pan and spray it!).  I baked for 30 minutes at 375 (I had other  things in the oven baking), flipped them over and baked another 30 minutes.  Perfect!!!

My family loved this recipe. I didn't have the mustard powder, so I used 2 teaspoons of regular mustard. It came out great.

Made these for a get together at my house and everyone loved them.  Great recipe!  Can make spicier if you like or add Dijon mustard to take away some sweetness if you think that they are too sweet.

This was delicious! My boyfriend loves this meal. The only difference was that I seasoned the chicken before I put the sauce on top. This has become one of my usual household meals.

These wings were ok - I felt like they were missing something, such as grated ginger or maybe some hot pepper flakes.  They were almost a little too sweet and I think they needed something to offset the sweetness.  They weren't bad at all, just lacking something.

Chicken wings aren't really my cup of tea however I decided to make them since my fiance loves wings. These turned out delicious. Followed the recipe exactly the only thing I did differently was making twice the amount of sauce. Used half for baking and poured half over the wings once they were ready to serve. Added a tiny bit of corn starch to the sauce I poured over the wings to serve to make it gooey.

Made it numerous times following exact recipe and was great. Last night It was too hot for the oven so instead I deep fried the wings plain just as they came after soaking and cleaning them then tossed them in the wok along with the sauce (followed same recipe for sauce)for about 20-25 mins!!!! Was AWESOME

Made per directions except I added chopped hot pepper. Wasn't enough heat so I added cayenne pepper. Turned every thirty minutes. Got a nice caramelization. Very tasty and tender. The pepper added some heat but not overpowering. Made with a cauliflower purée.

Excellent recipe, although the wings turn out a bit sweet. I added 4 dried chilis for a bit of a kick, and it worked perfectly. Also, I poured the marinade in a zip lock bag along with the wings and left them in the fridge for 3 hours.

I used this marinade on chicken breasts I cubed for kebabs and I was great!  I added a bit of garlic powder to amp up the garlic flavour. I had left over marinade, so I poured it over salmon the next day and grilled it.  It also turned out great!  Will definitely use this recipe again and again!

We were disappointed in these wings.  Despite marinating these overnight for dinner the next day, they were very mild and lacking in flavor.

Best honey garlic wings I've had. I set some sauce to the aside in the sauce pan, when the wings were done in the oven, I thickened the honey garlic sauce and poured them over my wings. That gave it the nice dark sticky texture I wanted.

This is definitely a new favorite for the family. First time I made it gone in less than one day. I’m one hundred percent going to make this again and again.

I followed the recipe exactly and marinated 3 hours, turned out super gooey and delicious. My toddlers absolutely devoured them and hubby loved them too. Definitely a keeper.

I read reviews before baking, added more soy sauce, cut on sugar. I made it for a birthday party, it was a big success.

Tried on chicken breasts.  Marinated for 8 hours.  Good flavor.  Not really one of my favorite chicken dishes but was worth a try.  No one said it was great, but everyone did eat it.  I think the sweetness was a little more than expected.  It was above average, but not super.  Hence the 4 stars.

Extremely tasty. I made this with drumsticks and thighs as this is what I had on hand, a half recipe of sauce which was more than enough.

I made this!
absolutely delicious.
instructions were easy to follow and everyone loved it.
My only reservation with this is that it is not juicy when you keep it a day or two and rehat because i had some leftovers. I still enjoyed it!
takes so long to bake too about 90 minutes but really good taste.
the taste is so good.

VERY delicious! I added 3 teaspoons of garlic powder in place of the fresh, omitted the mustard, and only marinated it for an hour and a half. The meat was juicy, while falling off the bone. I will be making this more often!

I did make a change...instead of marinating them overnight....I pre-cooked wings in the oven till well done. Then I thickened the sauce with flour over low heat. Placed the cooked wings in a large bowl and tossed them in the thickened sauce. Turned out very delicious. Kids said it was better then any they have ever tried in a restaurant!! Oh...I also left out the onions.

OK.  People at my party didn't really eat them, but that could have been lack of awareness it was there - I served a lot of food and didn't realize how many vegetarians were present.  I baked for 30 min at 350, then started to run out of time so cranked the oven up to 375 and it took about 20 min more min to get to 165.  I then kept in a crock pot for the party.

This recipe turned out perfectly.  I used drumsticks instead of wings and even my picky eaters enjoyed it.   However, I would call this more of a sweet onion sauce than a honey garlic sauce.

After I had committed myself in making this recipe I realized I did not have any honey.  So I made the recipe anyway with light agave nectar.  It turned out wonderfully and the family agreed.  Sweet & sticky, loved it.  Thanks.

I followed the recipe as written except for garlic powder instead of fresh. I ended up with a thin broth that was neither tasty or tangy. We thickened the sauce and it made it a little better. Won't be making this again any time soon.
