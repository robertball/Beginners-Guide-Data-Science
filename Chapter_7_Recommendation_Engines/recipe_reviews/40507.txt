This recipe was a very good base recipe to work with.  I didn't give it a five because I made several adjustments to it which I believe greatly improved the flavor.  This is what I did:  I cut the chicken breasts into medium sized chunks, seasoned the chicken with the juice of one lemon, salt & pepper (to taste), and several dashes of garlic powder and cumin powder.  I cooked the chicken completely on the stovetop until no longer pink.  I put this on top of the spinach mix.  The only things I changed in the spinach mix were adding one heaping teaspoon of minced garlic, a dash of hot sauce,a bit of ground black pepper and using a bag of shredded cheese called "6 Cheese Italian" which I find more to my liking.  I find Swiss cheese to be too bland.  For the bread crumb mixture, I used bread crumbs seasoned with pecorino romano cheese.  They were regular fine bread crumbs because I didn't have coarse bread crumbs.
Since I had cooked the chicken completely on the stovetop, I placed the casserole in the oven for only 35 minutes (uncovered), and it turned out wonderfully.

I substituted cheddar cheese for the swiss, and it was very good!

This recipe was so easy to cut in half to serve 3-4 people.  I used orzo instead of the white rice - one cup uncooked orzo:
1 cup uncooked orzo
2 cups chicken broth
1 cup water
1 tbsp olive oil

Put olive oil and orzo in 2 qt glass dish; stir until grains are thoroughly coated.  Add broth and water; in the microwave, cook on high for 5 minutes and then stir.  Cover, but leave gap for steam to escape, and cook on 50% power for an additional 15-20 minutes, or until liquid is absorbed.

Also, I used provolone cheese instead of swiss, using 4 slices over spinach layer and 4 slices over chicken.  I sprinkled the buttered bread crumbs over the cheese.  It was very good!

Everyone that said this was bland just needs to doctor it up a little.  This was excellent!  I added two cups of fresh broccoli cut in small florets, 3 cloves fresh garlic, and 1/2 cup parmesan to the mix and the topping.  Also, I seasoned the chicken with parsley and garlic powder in addition to the salt and pepper when sauteeing.  My family really enjoyed it and it had a lot of flavor.

This was really bland.  Really bland.  It's edible, though.  I think I will have to cut up the chicken from this dish and make sandwiches.  The top crust was the best part and I may use that part of the recipe for a different dish.  Ironically, this dish had neither cream nor paremesan cheese, the very elements the explanation of this dish said were basics to chicken florentine...  That should have been a clue.

This recipe is the best!  Even the kids enjoyed it.  I mistakenly purchased  dijon/mayo & used   it along w/ cheddar cheese in place of the swiss cheese & it was perfecto!  It was soooo good, I had the leftovers for breakfast the following day!!!

Easy to make but very average in taste.  I guess it did  get my husband to eat spinach, that's a plus.  I cubed and browned the chicken and just added it to the rest of the mix.

I thought this was good, but I over-baked it and it turned out a little dry. I added a few more spices to the rice mixture and used Cheddar for a little more kick.

Good recipe. Not for those who cook light...dish is kind of heavy and not light in calories.  But overall tasty!

I thought this was a great recipe! I substituted the Swiss cheese with Monteray Jack cheese. Even my 1 year old grandaughter loved it! I'm looking forward to left-overs for lunch today!
