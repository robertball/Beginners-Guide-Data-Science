Everyone at my Christmas party wanted this recipe.  I added 1/2 russian dressing in place of 1/2 mayo. It was great with cocktail rye bread

I make this recipe using 1- 8 oz brick of cream cheese instead of the mayo and only 8 oz of sour cream.  We also add 2 tablespoons of ketchup to get that thousand island look and taste.  I also heat it in a fondue pot or small crock pot for about 2 hours on low before serving, instead of in the oven.  Thanks so much!!!

I have made this recipe over and over again.  I have put it together the nightbefore & stored it in the fridgerator and then cooked it the next day.  Everyone has raved about it - I have given this recipe out over & over again.  Great for a quick gathering.  I wish I could give it more than 5 stars!!

This is my recipe, recently I made it and added about 1/2 cup of thousand island dressing to the mixture before baking, it gave it a little zip.  Just thought I'd add that. :)

Great recipe.  I made this recipe for a candel party last night and it was a hit.  Many guests asked for the recipe.  They liked it because it was different and it tasted great.  I agree with doubling the amount of Thousand Island dressing as suggested by another reviewer.  I served it with the rye crackers and with Triscuits.

Not the best Reuben Dip we've had.  Results came out too 'runny'.  OK if you're sitting around a table "fondue style", but too messy to eat standing at a party.

I love this dip! My mom made it for years and now it's one of my favorites too. We usually spoon the dip onto individual rye chips and bake them into perfectly portioned finger foods.

This is very good. I made a few changes because of personal taste. I used cream cheese instead of the mayo and sour cream. I also did not blend this in a blender. I just mixed in a mixer after chopping the corn beef up. Then i put this in a small crock pot and put the cheese on top. It was gone very fast. Thanks for a great recipe.

I adjusted the recipe some to fit what I had.  I used a whole can of corned beef, a 12 oz. can of kraut, 12 oz. swiss that was deli slices that I chopped before putting in the processor and I only had 1 tablespoon of horseradish - It did need the whole 3 tablespoons...I would have given it a 5 star if I would have made it with more horseradish.  It was good, and even good re-heated.  Ate it with rye crackers, and even people who didn't like sourkraut said it was good.

It was nice to have a "different" dip.  Make sure you use shredded cheese, or you'll end up overheating the dip to have a nice consistancy.

Very good. I did think it had a bit too much onion. But my husband ate it like there was no tomorrow. Served it with Rye Triscuits. Thank you for the recipe.

The flavor was a little bland, and the corned beef was too minced.  I will look for another recipe.  Thanks anyway!

it was ok... I added the 1/2 cup of thousand island dressing as suggested but still thought it needed something else, maybe more corned beef?

I didn't care for this recipe.  I think it needed more corned beef and the consistency wasn't what I expected.
