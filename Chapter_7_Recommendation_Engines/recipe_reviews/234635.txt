I had company coming for dinner and don't want to go to the store.  I had 5 cups of frozen, unsweetened sliced peaches (fresh from the farm last summer) so I didn't use berries.  It was wonderful and so easy!  Will be making this again and again!

I made this for work and it was well received.  I used all frozen sliced peaches and mixed the cornstarch, sugar, and spices  all in with the peaches.  One hint I saw from another recipe that I think helped with this one is that i put a long strip of paper towels between the lid and the crock pot to catch the cooking condensation - and I changed the towels when they appeared to be getting pretty damp.  This helps the crust crisp up and not be soggy.

This is so easy and so good! I bought some frozen mixed fruit that had peaches, strawberries and grapes in it. I also added raspberries. Made it the same way as described but did not add the brown sugar. The fruit and the cake mix made it sweet enough. It is great to have a dessert that is simple to just throw together and then forget about it!

I made this for dessert when I had company over. I used 5 cups of frozen mixed berries, and the same quantities of the spices. I used only enough of a package of spiced cake mix to cover the fruit, and this was a huge hit. I got Breyers Natural Vanilla ice cream to put over it... Even my husband, and parents, who don't like sweets loved it.

I canâ€™t believe how easy slow cooker dessert is!
The only changes I made were using 2 small cans of pine apples and half the cake mix. 
My husband found it too sugary so the next time I did not add brown sugar.

I made this exactly by the recipe. The simplicity of ingredients and fool-proof outcome will keep this on my favorites list. Everyone raved about it & added some vanilla ice cream to their cobbler. Yummy!

We had a super bowl party & I decided since I had a big bag of frozen mixed berries I would try this recipe & it was a huge success!!  I Had never  tried to try a baked type item in the slow cooker, it was worth a shot. I told everyone they would be my test team & they gobbled it up! Will definitely use this recipe again. I did place folded paper towels between the lid & cobbler & it did keep the cobbler crispy & brown.

This mushy. I used all peaches and a spice cake mix but everything else according to directions. I used a casserole slow cooker for over 3.5 hours.

This might be my first review! Yum, yum, YUM!! Only used peaches as I thought the mixed fruit was a bit much. Omitted the nutmeg on availability alone. Used 1/2 a box of white cake mix.

It was so easy! And it was delicious. But who would have know how hard it was to find a spice cake mix.

Made this! delicious. Have corn allergy in the house so I used flour. Also did not have cake mix so I used Krusteez Oatmeal Scotchie cookie mix. Awesome with the oatmeal! Enjoy. Will make this again.

I made this "too easy to believe" slow cooker dessert....! But I used a french vanilla cake mix instead of yellow or white, just added another layer of flavor to it..!

It was very easy and sooo good! I used apples instead of peaches or berries. I think the cinnamon goes good with the apples.

If I do it again, I will either make berry or peach but not together. The cinnamon mixture just wasn't great with blueberries.
