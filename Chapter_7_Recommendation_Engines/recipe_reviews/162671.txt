Found this recipe while looking for something different to do with beef stew meat. I was attracted to it because of the spices and how different it sounded.   I had to modify it somewhat based on what I had on hand.  I didnt have an orange, so added a tiny bit of lemon zest.  The only diced tomatoes I had on hand had green chiles in them so I used it. It actually made it quite nice with just a tiny spicy bite to it.   I made this in the crockpot and let it cook all day.  I didnt have any boiling onions so used regular yellow onions,  roughly chopped.  I removed some of the liquid after it was cooked and thickened it with flour and added it back in and let it thicken.  We ate it over buttered egg noodles and we all loved it.  I will be making this again.

I saved this recipe last fall (the ingredients were intriguing), but the numerous cooking steps/timing turned-me-off:  So, I used a slowcooker.  Omitted olive oil, butter, water, chopped onion. I heated all ingredients (used 1.5# stew meat) on stove (to give it a heated head start ) then placed in slowcooker.  Wasn't sure if the can of diced tomatoes was supposed to be drained or not, so didn't drain and omitted the 1/2 cup of water.  I added boiling onions a top of other ingredients, an hour into cooking, so they wouldn't become mushy.  Used pearl onions (as stated in recipe) the second time I made & we liked those better---stronger flavour & sweeter than boiling onions.  Cooked on low for 4.5 hours, however it may have been ready in 3.5-4 hours:  The meat was extremely break-apart tender.  At the beginning of cook time the aroma reminded me of pumpkin pie (no, it doesn't taste a bit like pie)!  This dish is very tasty with a nice, mellow combination of spice and orange zest.  The sauce is very thin when prepared in a slowcooker, but simple to thicken.  Served with sticky rice but egg noodles, or potatoes (mashed or otherwise) would also be a complimentary starch.

Dee-licious!  The orange zest really added something, so don't leave it out.  I had 1/2 lb less beef than needed for the recipe, so I used only 1 Tbsp butter and 1/2 lb of pearl onions. Too lazy to peel fresh so I used the frozen pearl onions and still tasted great.  I ended up cooking most of this yesterday and refrigerating overnight, then cooking the pearl onions tonight and simmering them with the reheated stew. Came out fine.  My only suggestion is that though the gravy is wonderful with those spices and the wine etc., there would barely have been enough if I'd used the full 2 lbs of beef, so you might like to increase your liquid.  Thank you for a tasty recipe.  Nice change from my usual beef stews. Served it with broccoli and mashed potatoes, but it would be good with noodles or those tiny European dumplings.

Wanting to use up a package of stew meat, I came across this recipe.  I browned the meat on the stovetop, but then added all the ingredients to the crock-pot except the pearl onions.  I cooked on low for about 6 1/2 hours.  With one hour left, I add the thawed (frozen) onions.  The onions were hot at serving time.  I served this over brown rice along with a salad, 7Up Biscuits and 'Southern Peach Cobbler' from AR for dessert.

YUM!  This is soooooo good.  My husband didn't like it but he has boring tastebuds.  If you like alot of flavour this is the answer!  I served it over rice with a side dish of steamed asparagus, grape tomatos and fresh paramsan cheese.  The recipe is on this site somewhere.  Drink the leftover wine with your meal - Recommend Fat  Red!  :O) *hic*

very good. I wasn't crazy about it the night I made it (hubby and kids were), but I loved it the second night after it had a chance to mellow in the fridge for awhile.

This was good, but not our favorite meal.  We made it exactly as stated and served it with noodles.  It is just a bit sweeter than we like, though everyone happily ate it they didn't feel it was worth the work to make it again.  However, IF we do make it again we are going to try adding potato and carrot, which my family feels will better compliment the sweetness than the noodles.

Great flavor! I did change some things to simplify the recipe. I browned all the meat together with the garlic and onions in a wok, covered. Then I added the red wine, cinnamon, nutmeg and sugar. Instead of orange zest I added ~1 tsp dried orange flakes. I added the complete can, undrained of diced tomatoes and instead of the water, I added beef stock to add flavor. When I make this again, I think I will omit the pearl onions. They were tasty but they were a lot of work to peel and not essential to the meal. I might replace them with some other vegetable like green beans. I served it over egg noodles and with crescent rolls. Delicious!

very tasty mild flavor; the onions sure do the trick. I replaced wine with chicken stock though. It still turned out pretty awesome!

Great recipe!  I didn't have pearl onions, so I used what I had, red onion.  I browned the beef, cooked the onions, and put everything into my crock pot and let it cook on low all day.  Served over rice, awesome.

Except for halving the recipe I followed it exactly and wished I'd made more as it is excellent.  Husband wanted seconds and it would have been better the next day to allow all the flavors to really mingle. I'll definitely make this again.

I improved this recipe by adding  1/4 cup red wine vinegar, a bay leaf, and adding the onions only just before serving. I like to use pearl onions intact and slightly chewy.   You should also add a bay leaf. A Greek would say "Poli nostimo !"

This was good, in that it was not bad. But, it doesn't stand out to us. Possibly this was because I was too cheap to buy the pearl onions (which were $3/pound) and substituted a pound of regular Spanish onions, diced up. Having no memory of having eaten that type of onion other than canned (and not impressed with canned), I can't swear to it. The recipe didn't say whether to drain the tomatoes or not, so I didn't. I wound up using a cornstarch slurry to thicken the sauce -- after 20 minutes of simmering uncovered it was showing no signs of thickening, & we were hungry! :=) (Use 2 TSP cornstarch in 1/4 cup cold water; mix; add; bring to a boil & let bubble gently til thickened.) The cinnamon, nutmeg, & sugar do add a flavor here, but it isn't a dessert-like flavor. If you enjoy the things in this stew, you will probably like this recipe. I served this over white rice with a Greek salad on the side. Thanks for the recipe!

I added two things to make this a whole balanced meal.  Carrots and peas.  Left out the pearl onions, we are still in debate if we like the texture of them or not.  Did use the chopped onion though.  I changed the way I cooked everything in this recipe and was able to use one pan instead of how many call for.  I was really worried about all the spices but they worked, but I did leave out the sugar.  Had to add about a cup of water throughout cooking to keep liquid in the pot so I threw in a beef cube at some point, it got bland.  I served this over cauliflower rice, it was a delicious dish in the end after my tweeks and everyone enjoyed :)

We liked it.  I would like to make it in a crockpot, but I’m not sure the flavor would be as good. I will use frozen pearl onions. I will make this again.

Easy and delish!  My fav combo,  I made it during the week too and it was a synch.  It is so flavorful and unusual, not your average stew!

This was pretty good served over brown rice, but I was a little disappointed that the orange rind flavor wasn't more pronounced.  Next time I will grate it and leave in.  I caramelized half a package of frozen peal onions, thawed to remove excess liquid, which I will add to other stews now also.

Made this Sunday and heated it up today.  Served it over egg noodles.  It needed salt.  Easy and the meat was very tender.   It was a-ok.

This "Beef Stifado" was very classy in appearance owing to the presence of pearl onions, and it presented with wonderful "aromatherapy flavors." The combination of red wine, orange peel, cinnamon, and nutmeg was delightful. I liked the orange flavor so much that when the stew as done cooking I added an additional tablespoon of grated organic orange rind that I happened to have in the freezer. I did make the stew a day in advance as per a few recommendations, but I didn't notice any improvement in flavor with sitting. It was equally perfect when I first made it. Thank you Lolly B for sharing your recipe.

A friend served this and I can hardly wait to make it myself.  Wish it were lower in calories and fat.  Considering the cost of beef, it's worth the splurge of money and calories.  The orange in here is perfect.

This was very good but definitely needs salt and pepper!
