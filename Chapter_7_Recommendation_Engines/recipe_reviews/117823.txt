Yummy in my tummy! My girlfriend made this simple chicken piccata, and it was good. The only thing we added was about three tablespoons of capers to the sauce. It nicely cuts the acidity of the lemon and adds a nice complimentary flavor of its own. Also, be sure to squeeze a real lemon instead of bottled juice. C'mon...trust me! Try this simple version first, then you'll have a good reference point for some of the more complex versions.

This is a great basic recipe.  Since then I've made some modifications....  I use chicken tenders so I don't have to pound.  I cook the chicken in a combo of butter and extra virgin olive oil.  I tent it while I starting the rest in the skillet.  I add the remaining butter with garlic and shallots adding portabella mushrooms once the onion is transluescent. I then add 1/4 white wine and 1/4 broth and 1-2 tab of lemon juice.  I add the chicken back in and add capers with parsley.  I serve this over pasta of some sort.  Yummy!

Very good!  The only thing I did different was dip the chicken in a slightly beaten egg before I put it in flour mixture.  The whole family enjoyed this reciepe. Thanks!

Easy, delicious, and super convenient. This makes a very moist chicken. Did not used flour to coat the chicken.  Just salt, pepper, and thyme. Also added an extra half cup of chicken broth and finally used up that sauv blanc in my fridge. Thanks!

This is a good basic recipe for this dish. It did in my opinion need garlic and mushrooms, this improved the flavor. The next time I make I will put in some capers. Had this in Italy with the capers and it was wonderful!

This was so simple to make & delicious!  I served it over spaghetti squash instead of pasta & added capers.  The only thing I'd do differently next time is make more sauce!

This is one of my favorite chicken dishes.  I follow the recipe exactly except that I add some fresh garlic and a little more white wine and lemon.  DELISH!

I was so happy to find an easy piccata recipe that I felt I couldn't screw up. Simple ingredients, and room to play with it. I had 3 big chicken breasts, cut them in half so they were thinner, added a bit of breadcrumbs with the flour, and instead of a tablespoon of lemon juice, I put thin slices of lemon in when I added the wine.  I also added capers. Really nice and didnt feel too heavy. Super recipe all around.

I used roasted garlic flavored chicken broth instead of the white wine and cooked the lemon juice with the sauce.   The chicken was tender and moist and next time im going to make more sauce.   This recipe is easy and a keeper

Absolutely delicious! I followed suggestions of some here and added shallots, capers, mushrooms. SOOOO good! Definately use real lemon juice, it makes a big difference! Also, I use white cooking wine instead of the "real thing", I never just have wine laying around and won't buy a whole bottle just to make this.I use only 1/4 cup of that and it's superb!Thanks so much for the recipe Cynthia!

This was very simple to make but a little bland.  I used white wine so perhaps chicken broth would have been better. Next time I think I would also add capers to the sauce for a little bit of "zing".

Amazing recipe -- LOVED it. Did modify by cooking onions, crushed garlic and mushrooms in the pan first, then added the chicken breasts. Used lemon white cooking wine -- but about 2 cups instead of 1/4 cup and added capers as well. SO good - a definite repeat recipe.

I ruined it. I tried to make extra sauce, as many Rreviewers had suggested.  I tripled the lemon juice and the wine  HOWEVER....I neglected to compensate for the juices in the pan - no one to triple them.  The result was WAY TOO TART!  To the point of YIKES!  THAT'S LEMONY.  Still tasted ok and would have been delish if I'd of added some chicken broth to compensate for the pan juices.  I can't wait to try it again.

The chicken was really tender and moist; it was great.  I eyeballed the wine, and it was probably closer to 1/2 cup.  Next time I will brown the chicken for a longer time to get more color and crisp before adding the liquid.  Lemon is a must!

I absolutely LOVE this recipe!!!!!!  Whenever my mom asks me to make dinner with chicken, I make this chicken piccata.  My sisters, my mom, and my dad all love it.  I usually eyeball the cooking wine, I don't measure it out.

This is a pretty good basic recipe. I added garlic powder and basil to the flour and after browning the chicken, I cooked some minced garlic and portabella mushrooms. I also ended up tripling the sauce as it kept reducing so fast. But boy was it worth it! Absolutely fabulous! I think this will be my go to recipe with my modifications.

Yummy! I followed the advice of others and used capers, onions, and garlic. I also used more wine (moscato) than called for (maybe double?) Delicious!

Wonderfully delicious and super simple!  I halved the recipe and followed it nearly exactly, the only change I made was adding a few Tbs of capers to the sauce.  Highly recommend!

Both times I've made this, I used chicken cutlets and adjusted the cooking time. Used cooking white wine so I left out the salt. This recpie is quick, easy and very tasteful! You'll love it! Serve it with some salad/veggie and bread of your choosing. We like our bread with fresh made pesto in the summer.

Excellent!  I changed it a little.  I   used 3/4 cup of wine and 3/4 cup of chicken broth (I like a little extra sauce) but it simmered down to a nice thick sauce.  I also added 6 or 7 mushrooms and threw sliced lemon in the pan while it was cooking.  Turned out perfect.  This is a wonderful, quick and easy meal that is well appreciated.

This is a very good recipe. I also added capers, used half wine and half chicken stock. If you use wine make sure you let the alcohol cook off.

4.5 stars - this was really good!  My 16 year old son had 3 helpings.  The only thing I did differently than instructed was to remove the chicken once it was browned, deglazed the skillet, added broth and wine (tripled amount), then returned the chicken to simmer.  Don't worry about the sauce being thin at first, it will reduce and thicken as it simmers.  Used chicken stock and chardonnay, very very good!  Thanks for sharing your recipe.

This is an awesome, tasty and very easy recipe. I added a can of stewed tomatoes (drained), a can of artichoke hearts (drained and sliced in halves) and two teaspoons of capers...Couldn't be more delicious. Even my 20 month old baby kept asking for more. Thanks for this yummy recipe.

The combination of the wine, butter and lemon make a delicious glaze on the chicken.  I really enjoyed this.  White Zinfandel wine gave a slight color to the sauce which was nice.

I tried a chicken piccata recipe from some magazine that was suppose to be from some gourmet chef and it was aweful and nearly imposssible to eat.  Then I found this nice little recipe that is perfect!  I used white wine and added 2 TSP of capers for the perfect balanced recipe.  I definately reccommend fresh lemon juice.  It was still a little lemony for my kids, but I will just serve there's plain next time.  My hubby and I really liked this!

Tasty and easy!  The only thing I did different was add the lemon juice along with the wine and let the chicken simmer.  I made this for just the 2 of us so eyeballed most everything I put in.  It's really hard to mess up so "exact" amounts are not necessary.

Worked out quite well but it wasn't until I was cleaning up from dinner that I realized that there weren't any MUSHROOMS!  I looked up Piccata, tonight, because I have mushrooms in the fridge that i need to use!  Guess I'll have to make mushroom breakfast and lunch before it's too late!

This is so easy and yummy. I made it tonight for my boyfriend and I and we ate it all. He REALLY liked it. The only thing I did different was add red pepper flakes, because we likes spice. I did use the wine and not the chicken broth. Yum!

this was delicious!  At first I was a little worried b/c it looked kind of bland and like there was not much sauce.   So, I added exra wine and a teaspoon of capers and half a can of quartered articoke hearts.  I served the chicken on angel hair pasta.  Instead of pounding out the breasts, I just cut them in half and they were so tender.  I will be making this over and over.

Quick and delicious.  Chicken was very moist.  I minced some garlic and sauteed in the butter before adding the chicken.  I also doubled the sauce after reading other reviews.

Fantastic!  Took hint and used tenderloins (no pounding) and doubled sauce (1/2 cup white wine and 1/2 cup chicken broth).  Also, took hint and simmered with lemon slices instead of lemon juice.   Wonderful!  Kids (and neighbors) loved it!

Excellent recipe, just loved it and so did my lil ones. I did season the chicken well and also added some spices to the sauce but did not add the lemon juice because  I knew that they would not like it with lemon juice. Did use the wine and capers though for the sauce... MMMMM MMMM Good!

This is a great basic Chicken Piccata recipe.  I added a touch of cayenne to the flour mixture and sauted a clove of garlic and a tablespoon of capers in the pan after removing the chicken to make the sauce.  Fast, easy, delicious and elegant.  What more could you ask for!  Oh use a good white wine and fresh lemon juice.  It makes all the difference.

My husband is always talking about his friends, wife's chicken piccata....and quite frankly I got tired of hearing how good it was....so I made this recipe for him without saying anything.  he loved it... not only was it better than 'hers'... he stated that it was better than one of his favorite dishes at a restaurant. woo hoo!   My son thought it was a little sour. :-)

Very tasty! A few guests thought it should have more lemon, but besides that it was a hit! One of the guests cannot eat gluten, so I used sweet sorghum flour instead of all-purpose flour and it worked just as well.

This was an easy recipe. I added more lemon. I used frozen chicken breasts which were difficult to work with, i recommend fresh or recently refrigerated chicken instead!

I made this and it was sooo good! I read the reviews and one of the more popular things to do was to make double the sauce...I didn't do that, I was only making this for 2. What I did do is zest 2 baby lemons and added 1/2 the zest to the flour mixture that breaded the chicken and the other half into the sauce...so good!

I just made this delicious chicken dish.  We are having it for dinner in about 5 minutes.  I go exactly by the recipe, except I don't measure the cooking wine, I just eyeball it.  There is nothing wrong with this recipe.  It may be a little bit salty, but just a little bit.  I hope you enjoy this dish as much as I do!  :)

Tried this last night as a last minute dinner and it turned out wonderful! Piccata is one of my fave dishes and this was a great, quick, and very easy recipe for it. Next time I'll probably add some capers, but that's just personal preference. Didn't have any last night and I was still a happy camper ^_^

I'm giving it 5 stars because there were no leftovers and everyone loved it.  I thought it was only a 3 star meal, but I admit I didn't keep a close eye on the dish while it cooked and I think I had the pan too hot.  But it did take good.  I've received several requests to make it again.  This time I'll watch more closely.  I'm sure it is just me being picky because even the toddlers loved it!

Excellent; substitute garlic salt for regular for a little extra pep. Serve with a linguine lightly coated in butter, lemon, and garlic salt also.

Oh yeah, this turned out quite nice! For some reason I was drawn to this version because of the simplicity then went ahead & did my own thang with it: First I lightly seasoned the breasts with salt/pepper/cayenne & gave them a light dusting of flour. Used 1/2 the butter to brown the chicken,  about 4-5 minutes per side, removed it from the skillet then sauteed a small handful of chopped green olives (don't have/use capers) & a small clove of minced garlic in the remaining butter. When this was soft I deglazed the skillet with leftover chicken broth, added the chicken breasts & simmered on low for about 8 or 10 more minutes. Just before serving  squeezed the juice of half a lemon over all & a sprinkling of fresh Italian parsley.  This turned out very tasty with just the right zing - not overpowering at all & something I'll definitely try again!

Simple and delectable! I really do think the aroma filed my whole apartment. In fact, I'm sure it made my neighbors very jealous. :) I did, however, fine tune it a bit. While I was browning the chicken I added a tablespoon of jarred garlic and olive oil. By golly, the aroma!! Towards the end of the simmering process I made a couple more minor adjustments. I added about 1/4 cup of artichoke hearts cut evenly. I also added about 2 tablespoons of capers. Of course I squeezed fresh lemon as well. Lemons are cheap. And I think theres actually a difference between real lemons and the fake stuff. I will definitely make this recipe over and over again! Thanks!

I use the chicken prep method in this recipe for chicken fried chicken because the chicken fries fabulously and is done to perfection. The sauce wasn't as lemony as I thought it would be, so I make regular old gravy instead and pour over the chicken and mashed potatoes. My boys love, love, love this.

You'd never guess by the finished product how easy this recipe is. Instead of lemon juice I placed two lemon slices on each breast and added capers.

I stayed true to the recipe with the exception of adding capers and sporadically squirting lemon juice onto the chicken as it was frying.  It is excellent and very easy!  I rarely give 5 stars, but this is truly deserving!  Thanks!

This was good.  I added 2 minced garlic cloves to the olive oil for extra flavor.  I also added both white wine and chicken broth instead of choosing just one.  I thought this made a big difference in flavor as well.

Quite tasty!!  I love lemons, but I think it was to "lemony" for hubby.  I did add some capers (I rinsed them so they were not to salty).  You could serve this to company.  Good recipe.

We didn't care for this much. Way too bland even after adding a garlic clove and a splash of wine to the broth. Otherwise we followed exactly. We won't make this again; there are better recipes out there!

I was very impressed with the finished product. It was far more flavorful than I anticipated given how simple it was to prepare. I followed the recipe with just a couple minor tweaks. As recommended in another review, I beat an egg and coated the chicken with it before adding the flour mixture. The recipe called for white wine or chicken broth, and I used both ... adding a little extra wine mid-simmer. I also had white mushrooms in my fridge so I sliced them and through them on top, letting them simmer with all of the juices. I squeezed all of a large lemon over the chicken the last few minutes simmering, which was not overpowering at all. The result was soft, tender chicken where hints of each flavor were apparent but none of them overpowering. I will make this one again!

Very yummy and the coating made it seem like there was a skin even though I was using skinless chicken. I added garlic powder and more wine, then used the leftover sauce to pan-fry steamed potatoes as a side dish.

This recipe was fantastic, my whole family loved it. The chicken came out real tender. I'm glad I didn't try the other recipe that used bread crumbs, because this one came out light and tasty. You don't even need a knife to cut into the chicken. I did add capers to the recipe, whick add more tart flavor. I told my oldest son who is 20, that I have to teach him how to cook this, because it is so easy. It helps when the chicken is cut diagonal and pounded flatter. We served ours with french bread, vegetables, and spagetti pasta with parmasean cheese with basil. It made an excellant meal, and I will be making this again.

Very, very good.  I used both broth and white wine.  I should have listened to the advice of others and cooked the chicken first, and then made the sauce.  My breading was nice and brown and crisp before adding the broth and wine, but was soggy afterwards.  I also added some cornstarch to the sauce to thicken it some.  I made this with Lemon Pasta sauce(also on allrecipes) and served with angel hair pasta.  The whole family loved it!

Absolutely wonderful classic dish!  Nicely simplified.  Chicken broth is ok but wine makes it special.  I hate to be picky but chicken piccata has no mushrooms or egg as some reviewers suggested.  It then becomes (as I call my own modifications of classic dishes) a concoction.

This was a gourmet meal without the long cooking time! I used a mix of butter and olive oil in a pan, I also coated my chicken in egg and then dipped it in the flour. Mixed 1/4 cup wine and 1/4 cup chicken broth, plus 2 tbsp fresh lemon.  Delicious!

This was good.  I added garlic powder and a little thyme to the flour, doubled the sauce ingredients,and used a mix of chicken broth and wine.  I browned the chicken in olive oil with a couple tsp of margarine.  I added minced garlic to that which I don't recommend as mine burned.  I would wait till half way thru the cooking time to add the garlic if you do. I also added mushrooms.  The sauce and chicken tasted AMAZING.  My only suggestion is if you are going to make this to serve on pasta (as I did), I would at LEAST quadruple the sauce ingredients.  I did run short and had to add parm and butter to the pasta.  The mushrooms added so much to the dish, they absorbed the flavor of the sauce nicely.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Served this for company last night over penne pasta w/ broccoli & fresh rolls. EXCELLENT dish!   I more than doubled the sauce to have enough for the pasta - 14 oz can of chicken broth, then used the can to put the same amount of white wine in, 2 T cornstarch (mixed w/ cold water first to dissolve), more salt & pepper, and about 2 T of lemon juice.

A great recipe-but did it a little different....I couldn't pund my chicken breast that thin so I browned them in the skillet with the butter first then removed them to a baking dish.  Then I added mushrooms and the green tips of scallions to the pan and made the sauce, more than doubling the sauce recipe (it is so yummy).  Then moved the breast back into the pan to let it all simmer together.  Add the lemon juice at the very end. Then transfer breasts back into the dish, cover with sauce, and move to the table to serve! 
If you like your sauce thicker, you can use some of the excess flour from coating the chicken to thicken it, just make sure you let it bubble and cook so it doesn't taste raw.
Will be making again!

Easy and good!!  Smells awesome while cooking!  Mostly I follow the recipe 2 the T the first time I make it and then make adjustments later.  I tasted the chicken before I served it and thought it was great but might be missing a lil something so I got out some fresh mushrooms and sliced them sauteed in butter with garlic sauce.  Then topped it with the mixture. This was simple and quick.  Although next time I might try olive oil to replace the butter.  Thx for sharing!!
