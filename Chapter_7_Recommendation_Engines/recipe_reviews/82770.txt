I had friends over for an impromptu game night and decided to try out this recipe. My problem was I didn't want to spend the time to assemble 10 sandwiches. So this became an "assemble your own" party.
I made everything separately.  I grilled the chicken breasts and basted them with a garlic infused EVOO rather than BBQ sauce.  (I put the BBQ sauce on the table as part of the assemble your own.)  I cut up green and red peppers and a vidalia onion and grilled them while cooking the chicken. The other addition was that I offered flour tortillas as well as sub rolls. When it was time to eat I had a huge platter set out with all the ingredients and let everyone make their own.  It was a big hit.  

Some observations. No one used the avocado. Almost everyone agreed that they would forgo the BBQ sauce. People were happiest with just the ranch dressing or in several cases, mayo.  The grilled onions and peppers went great with this sandwich. And lastly, most people preferred the tortillas over the rolls. It gave the sandwich a much lighter taste.  I will definitely make this again. If you do it this way, beware it is a LOT of prep work but once it was done I could enjoy my party along with everyone else instead of being stuck in the kitchen.  Thanks Dan.

I must agree with “by Reviewer” who asked why do some people come on here and write remarks like "way too much fat" blah, blah, blah without actually trying the recipe. Or why some people come on here and change the recipe so much that they've actually posted a new recipe? I made this sandwich for my slim and trim family one Saturday for lunch and we LOVED it! Then we went out and shopped for the week ‘til we dropped - in other words, we efficiently used up the calories. Still, I get so annoyed when I read reviews that complain about the ingredients being to fatty or high in calories. I want to read constructive reviews. I also get annoyed when these same people recreate the entire recipe. Why give a low rating if you don’t even know what the recipe tastes like? AND, if you made the recipe wrong why give it a low rating based on your mistakes? Can’t people just enjoy reading the recipes for what they are? And, if they make the recipe, then judge it on how it tastes. We ALL know how to lighten up foods and what we should and shouldn’t eat. Come on people, let’s be fair and judge a recipe for what it’s worth, and don’t redesign the entire thing - otherwise, post your own version of the recipe and see how YOU get criticized.

Awesome.  I've made these several times.  I had better luck when I mashed the avocado instead of using slices because the slices are so slippery.  I made these for a party and everyone loved them.

I was not sure about the BBQ sauce/ranch dressing combo, but it works!  I also mashed the avocado because I can then spread it on the bread for avocado in every bite, but that is not really a problem with this recipe... it's a very minor change!  The combo of all the flavors is really good!  The only change I made was to use a nice, crusty sourdough roll instead of the soft hoagie... and that really made it stellar!  DH and I often eat only one meal on weekend days... so this sandwich is perfect because it fills us up and I don't worry about fixing a big dinner!  Thanks, Angelshark...

Delicious - I can see why this is "Dan's Favorite Sandwich"! My husband loves anything with bacon so this was a winning combination for us! I chose to grill the chicken instead of baking and basted it with a bit of KC Masterpiece BBQ sauce which made it moist and juicy. I cooked the bacon separate, toasted some kaiser rolls and added some fresh crisp lettuce and sliced tomato. The warmth from the grilled chicken melted the cheese and we didn't bother putting anything in the oven. These were perfect with some kettle cooked chips! Easy and very filling!

Yum yum yum!  I cut recipe to make one sandwich.  I made this as a melt on dark rye bread.  I used my George Foreman grill to cook the chicken and cleaned it off to grill the sandwich.   Was really good and filling too.  Tasted like a sandwich you'd buy for $8 in a sit-down restaurant!

Made this tonight for myself, it was fantastic.  Made a few variations for personal preference; I used potato bread instead of hoagie rolls, I just like the way it toasts up and absorbs all the oils; I cut one large chicken breast in half lengthwise, I thought it was the perfect amount; I'm not really an avocado person so I used tomato istead, it was a nice substitute I think; and I added a little hot sauce to the BBQ when glazing the chicken to give it a little kick.  Take what you want leave what you don't.  The original recipe is great, I just thought I'd change a few things for fun.

My hubby loved this.  I liked it, we'll make it again.  I think when I do it again, I'll slice the chicken breasts and layer the slices on the bread - it will make it easier to eat.
Thanks for the recipe!

I had leftover grilled chicken to use for this sandwich.  I used 9 grain petite bread, subbed fresh spinach in place of the avocado and mixed Bubba's BBQ sauce recipe with the Herbed Buttermilk Parmesan Dressing recipe. Nice summer sandwich.

I had this for lunch but it was so filling, I doubt I'll be wanting any dinner tonight. The only changes I made were to cook the chicken on the Foreman grill, and I microwaved the bacon. Next time, I will omit the barbeque sauce - it didn't complement the Ranch dressing well. Other than that, this is a great sandwich. Thanks, Dan!

I applaud this sandwich and I high five Angelshark for posting it!  It's SUPER yummy and that's why I come to allrecipes; for yummy recipes.  it's good to have in my recipe arsenal.  That being said, this sandwich makes me happy on one of those Saturdays when everything has to be done in one day.  One sandwich and POW, my taste buds are happy and so is my tummy!  Job well done. :)

Very good!  Only change was to cook bacon separately as we like it crisp. Although I've never submitted a review before I felt compelled today as I am getting so tired of reading reviews from people who don't  even follow the recipe! What's with that!!!  One reviewer even said she did a buffet style with ingredients that aren't even part if the recipe and people liked her additions better.  How would anyone know if they liked this recipe if they didn't try it? Sometimes the most unlikely combinations are the best. Don't make it again if you don't like it. Submit your own recipe.

A 5 star sandwich! I love combination of ranch/bbq sauce together. This sandwich got me a second date with my lady friend, so thank you for your post! PS I also mashed the avocado as previous reviewer noted.

Delicious! I seasoned my chicken breasts w/ salt, pepper and garlic powder and cooked it in a pan. When it was done, I placed it on a cookie sheet and topped it w/ the bbq sauce and cheese and put it in the oven until the cheese was melted. These had a great flavor from the combo of the bbq sauce and ranch. The whole family enjoyed these...a keeper~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

Thank you Angelshark for a great sandwich!
Exactly as you wrote it,  and can be changed up
a little bit if desired.  Seasonings were perfect!
I have to watch my diet like a lot of people, but 
this did not seem to be a high fat sandwich for me.
I will make this whenever I need comfort food!
Thanks Angelshark!

I needed something to take to a family get-together and this worked out great. I followed the recipe, giving a choice of lettuce or avocado on the side and I did make some sandwiches with provolone because I knew some family members didn't like Swiss. It was a huge hit with everyone, even the picky kids loved it! The BBQ/ranch/bacon was a great combo. This will definitely be a regular in our house.

WOW. I was a little worried about the ranch but it worked, and was so much better then i thought a chicken sandwich could be! I did forget to get bacon, and when i served this to my husband the only thing he said besides oh my god this is so good, was this would be so much better with bacon. Will make again.(with bacon.)

I made this last night as per directions and it was great. (Always try by directions first) Next time I will toast roll with BBQ sauce on it, take chicken topped with bacon and cheese and place on cookie sheet in oven until cheese is melted, remove from oven and place on roll and add condiments. Great recipe...Thanks

This sandwich was so good! I used turkey bacon, added grilled onions, used provolone cheese instead of swiss, loved the avacado and used the ranch and bbq sauce as condiments on the sandwich. I also grilled my chicken instead of baking. Served on toasted flax and fiber sandwich thins, such as Arnold brand. Such a yummy and tasty sandwich. Thanks!

This is a tasty sandwich and very filling.  The bacon doesn't get crispy in the oven so I ended up finishing it in a skillet - next time I'll just cook it separately in the skillet...

I really thought the cooking instructions were silly.  Cook bacon on top of chicken, remove and drain bacon strips on paper towel—What  about all the grease on the chicken?  Or the fact that all of the BBQ gets removed in the process?  Well, after trying it several different ways, I have to admit that following the instructions yields the most flavorful sandwich and the chicken is super moist. The only bad part is the bacon does not brown and looks uncooked.  Even after the broiling phase,  it does not get crisp.  To complete the sandwich, I replaced the soggy bacon with strips that had been fried in the skillet.

This is my first review, and I have to say this recipe was wonderful!  I made this for my husband and my parents, and everyone agreed this was a do-over.  I think the secret to making this so good was the fresh baked rolls we used and a perfectly ripe avocado.  The only thing I did different was to fry the bacon slightly before baking it with the chicken (my husband prefers bacon to be crisp), and I toasted the inside of the buns in the broiler slightly before adding the other ingredients.  We will definitely be adding this to our last of favorite sandwich recipes!

This was delicious!  The only thing I did different, was spread the ranch dressing on one side of the bread; and some bbq sauce on the other side.

Yum this was delish.  My family loved it.  My son said he felt like he was eating in a diner and we love diner sandwiches.
I used others suggestions, grilled the chicken on the bbq, cooked bacon separately this morning and smashed the avocado on the rolls to make eating it easier.  I also sliced the chicken like others said, it did make it easier to eat.  What great flavors.  One thing I added, somehow I thought it was part of the recipe, was sauteed mushrooms.  Now I see that was not part of the recipe.  Oh well, it was tasty anyway.  Thanks so much for posting.  This will defintely be a staple in my house and save me lots of money at a restaurant!

As someone who needs to watch my fat/cholestrol intake, I make a few changes. I substitute turkey bacon for the regular bacon, use fat free ranch dressing, and use low fat Lorraine swiss cheese. The avocado also helps with "good" cholestrol. I also substitute whole grain bread. Still delicious and healthy!!

The bacon and ranch were a superb match for the bar-b-que sauce. And the nutty flavor of the swiss topped it off. Stuffed in a hogie with chicken and Avocado this is a perfect party sub.  Thanks

Good sandwich. I make a similar one using large shrimp and instead of cheese I use sprouts or leaf lettuce. Just mash the avocado, its easier to eat. Thanks for the recipe!

Really really good!  This was like some sandwich you might get at a restaurant.  I added extra avocado, since I'm an avocado freak.  Also I was out of ranch dressing, so I used the Ranch Dressing III recipe from this site (glad I did--I wont be buying ranch anymore!).  Had only enough swiss cheese for part of them, so jack worked just fine for the remainder.  YUM!

very tasty!  Lot's of flavors going on in this sandwich.  I pounded my chicken flatter to our preference and baked for 10-15 mins.  I also layered one half bun with ranch, cheese, then bacon so it would crisp up under the broiler.  Next time I will toast the buns before topping them with the ranch, etc.

Yum. I baked chicken and glazed it with bbq, I bought thin cut chicken breast. I pan fried the bacon then added it to the top of chicken and melted cheese on top under broiler. I sauted some green pepper to add in place of avacado. Great recipe!

I used Sweet Baby Rays original bbq sauce and Marie's ranch dressing, sliced part of a red pepper and through it in the oven with the chicken, scrapped the avacado, cooked the bacon on the panini grill, sub-ed the cheese for monterey jack, rolled it in a wrap, and finished it in the panini grill on high.  Basically the same as the original recepie.  Real simple and sounds boring but wow.

We had this great sandwich last week which by itself made a full meal. I left off the bbq sauce and used blue cheese dressing in place of the ranch.  My husband who is pretty fussy about his food, raved about it.  Yes, I will have it again as it is a great way to get avocados in your diet.

This is a great recipe - we made it for dinner and it was very good!  The only modifications we made were to use mozzarella rather than Swiss, only because we had it on hand (I imagine it would be even better with Swiss).  We cooked the chicken on the Foreman grill and bought fully cooked bacon.  Next time I will definitely not skimp on the condiments.  All in all it was a fast and easy delicious meal!

Mmm mmm mmm this was delicious, I was surprised but I enjoyed the ranch barbecue mix. I also mash the avocado for easy spreading and made sure I did not burn the bacon I used a maple peppered bacon it was great! Company after church all loved it, better than the usual tuna chicken salad or cold cuts.  5*

OMG??So good! Didn't change much except instead of the roll, I used whole wheat sandwich rounds. I'm not big on a lot if starchy foods. I also added onion to enhance the flavor. It should be noted that I am a calorie watcher. I ran the ingredients through an app on my smart phone - 566 calories per sandwich. It was high in sodium and fat - a guilty pleasure! This is not a sandwich I would eat often but would enjoy it on rear occasion. Sooo good!

HUGE success. Do not change a thing about this recipe. I ended up cooking it all on my grill so it didn't quite take 25 minutes. I was able to pull the chicken off after about 15-20 minutes and they were done perfectly. My 14 y/o son at 2 of these!!!

Really good, juicy sandwich.  I agree that the sliced avocado makes them a bit slippery.  They are already pretty messy.  Almost need a knife and fork to eat them.  But, overall, really good.  Husband and kids both liked them!  The only change I made was I used the precooked bacon.  So I didn't put them on the chicken until the very end when I was broiling everything.  Still came out perfect!

Made this tonight for the 1st time. I don't care for bbq sauce or bacon. But used everything else. I loved it. Also made some with bbq sauce minus the bacon & my son ate two! This recipe is a keeper. Tweak it to your liking. Thanks.

Very good recipe! I've made it several times and even my picky son loves it. I took earlier suggestions of crushing the avocado, which was very helpful. It tends to be a bit messy, but oh so delicious.

Delish!  My bacon didn't end up crunchy, though.  Next time I will cook it separate from the chicken.

I made this using Perdue breaded chicken cutlets. I also used a couple of different types of sliced cheese that I had on hand, for my family's individual preferences. But the base flavors of chicken, BBQ, bacon and avocado were left intact and we each liked our slightly different version very much! Easily customizable. Good Saturday lunch.

This was very yummy... just next time I would cut up the chicken differently than directed in the recipe, to make it easier to handle the sandwich.

This was a five star hit in our home. My husband, five year old son and I all enjoyed it. The one small modification I will make next time is to salt the chicken slightly before adding the bbq sauce. Yummy!

This is one of those meals thats good on the nights where you don't feel like cooking much.. The bbq and ranch combo with the avocado was sooo good. We didn't have any swiss cheese on hand but provolone worked really well.. We'll definitely make this again ..

My husband and I LOVE this sandwich! We dont really change anything about it.  I do broil it for only 2-2 1/2 minutes. I also cut my chicken up in strips after it is cooked, but before I put it on the hogi roll... it just makes it easier to eat, and I only use 1 slice of cheese per sandwich. We also use microwave bacon- so I dont cook my chicken with the bacon and I add the bacon to the sandwich when I broil it!  Other than that we LOVE this. Hope you enjoy!

The ranch dressing was fantastic with the bbq sauce. It was a super simple sandwich to make. I omitted the avacado as sometimes I have an adverse reaction to it but it was still perfect...my boyfriend thought he'd died and gone to heaven!

My husband always complains that it takes too long for me to make everything, because I insist on starting from scratch. He took it all back when he got one of these for lunch, served on Belle's Hamburger Buns (also from this site). He said it was the best sandwich he ever had. I used muenster cheese because that's what I had, but I am looking forward to using Swiss on the next rendition. Amazing sandwich.

We enjoyed this sandwich. I grilled my chicken on our George Foreman grill than added the BBQ  and I saute' some green bell pepper, onion and mushrooms in butter and omitted the avocado, as i didn't have any on hand.  Turned out very well. Thanks for sharing the recipe!

This is a great recipe.  I cook for four guys at my house and they ALL loved this! The only change I made was I let each person put on their own condiments.  Some use the ranch dressing and some liked more barbecue sauce.  Delicious!!
