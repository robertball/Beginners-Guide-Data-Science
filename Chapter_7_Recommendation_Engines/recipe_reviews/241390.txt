Delicious!  Weâ€™ve added this as a spread to our Reuben sandwich instead of plain Swiss. Perfect crowd pleaser!

My friend made a similar recipe for a girls night at the cabin. For Thanksgiving I decided to give it a try. Since her recipe didn't include amounts I searched this recipe. I think I need to chop the onions more. But overall very yummy!!
