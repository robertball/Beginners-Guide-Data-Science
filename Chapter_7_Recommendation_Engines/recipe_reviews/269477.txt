I made this for dinner at our ladies' bible study and everyone said that it was great! It's easy to make. I used ground turkey instead of beef and used white corn tortillas.  I topped it with black olives, chopped tomatoes and scallions with sour cream, avocado slices and lime wedges on the side with a simple salad. I will make this again because I really like casseroles and mexican food. It seems to be more like an enchilada style casserole to me than burrito. Thank you for the recipe!

This was so easy and so tasty!  I probably used the wrong size tortillas because 8 wasn’t enough and I couldn’t cut them into 2” strips but otherwise it was amazing!!
