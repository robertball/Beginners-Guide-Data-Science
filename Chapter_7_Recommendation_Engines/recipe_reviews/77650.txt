I am usually a wuss and only make recipes with multiple reviews.  Well, I knew if I wanted to bring brownies to a potluck, they better be different. (And good)  Someone else DID bring boxed mix brownies (Pa-lease), and mine were the first to go. (Hers were hardly touched.)  I highly reccommend this recipe.  It turned out beautiful & tasty.  I made it in a springform because I do not have an 8x8 dish.  Served on a cake tier with powdered sugar.  Beautiful.

If I could give 3.5 stars I would. These have a great texture, but are not nearly chocolatey enough. I think it needs another block or two of chocolate. The texture is very fudgey with chewy edges. The batter seems very thick when you mix it.

I have to say this recipe is awesome!  I made it for the first time this past Saturday to take to a fundraiser.  The "brownies" turned out so great....chewy and tasty.  I did modify a little by adding a TBS of Cocoa powder just because a couple of the reviews said it wasn't chocolatey enough.  Mine was chocolatey!  :)  This was so easy to make and a big hit at the event!
