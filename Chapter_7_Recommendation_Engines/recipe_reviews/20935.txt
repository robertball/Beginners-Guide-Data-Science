Try this; it's much easier and includes butter--which will add flavor and depth to this recipe: 
In a SMALL bowl, stir 4 OZ of softened cream cheese, 1/2 stick butter, and 1/4 c syrup. Then simply microwave for a minute. Pour over bread cubes (make sure pan is generously buttered so that souffle will "rise." I've used all kinds of bread).  Combine six eggs, 3/4 t vanilla, and 1 1/2 c half-and-half.  Pour over the top, sprinkle cinnamon over it, and refrigerate overnight.  Cook for an hour. Virtually same ingredients, different preparation--more flavor!

Let me just start by saying that I know zip about cooking and/or eggs. I went to the store to buy eggs for this thing, and figured, hey I'll just get the jumbo size (the idea being that bigger is, naturally, better). Then I proceeded to construct the souffle following the directions to the letter. As it was baking, I finally got around to reading other people's reviews of it. Oh, a lot of people like it. But everyone who did changed the recipe. "Six jumbo eggs were all I needed. Heck, four or five would suit you just fine." As I'm reading through these the thought staring me in the face is "My souffle is going to suck." As serendipity would have it, it did not in fact suck. It was actually quite good. My company was pleased with it. I have seen others here say that it was too gooey or some such. I did not find that to be the case. It was warm and soft for breakfast. Later in the day we ate it cold and it was great---very much like a cheese danish. How versatile! From breakfast to dessert. And the moral of the story is: Leap before you look. Thank you.

Delicious for brunch!  My kids don't want regular french toast anymore.  To avoid sogginess, I bake it (covered) for 30 minutes and then remove the cover and bake 15 minutes more.  Yum!

This recipe is so amazing. We made it today for my son's second birthday and it turned out wonderfully. I started the dish out with a thick french bread and then I coated the bread in sugar and cinnamon before pouring any of the cream cheese mixture on top. I used six eggs and 3/4 cup of syrup with a couple handfuls of brown sugar, and a couple of teaspoons of cinnamon and nutmeg. I cooked this casserole at 350 for forty-five minutes. When I removed it from the oven, I drizzled syrup all over it and then allowed it to cool for five minutes. I then took a sifter and shook powdered sugar all over the top. The extra sugar and syrup allowed it to acheive a very moist consistency and almost the entire dish was gobbled up in a matter of minutes. It is the perfect dish for a potluck, birthday, or shower. I highly reccomend this!

Great!  I used a loaf of day-old sourdough (day-old bread is really cheap from the bakery section of my local grocery store).  I really liked the sourdough taste and texture with this dish.  It is very rich and filling, so a little goes a long way!  I used skim milk for the milk, and whole milk for the half-and-half (since I didn't have any).  It was so good!  Used and served with real maple syrup.

I have made this several times adding cinnamon, nutmeg, brown sugar and pecans to the bread before pouring the milk mixture over top.  To help with the sogginess, stir well and then stir again about an hour later.  Stir well one more time before baking in the morning.  I find this helps the mixture to soak more evenly.  Tastes awesome.

I modified the recipe slightly and it came out perfect!  I bought a loaf of THICK cinnamon swirl bread (they sell it at Costco), which I think was key.  I reduced the eggs to 5 and also added 2/3 cups of brown sugar.  I served this at my Mother's Day brunch, which I hosted and it was a hit with everyone!  Someone even ate it as dessert with vanilla ice cream!

I have been making this for the last 2 Christmas brunches.  My extended family demands it :-)  I have started making it with 6 eggs and keep it in the oven a tad bit longer because we like it less soggy.

Meh.  Made exactly to spec, and wasn't too impressed.  Bottom was more of a bread pudding than a french toast.  Top was better, but not that impressive.  Won't make again.

Mine never got done in the middle and it was soggy and goopy like uncooked custard. The bread was wet too except what was above the custard, that was dry.

I prepared this for a group of critical fire fighters Christmas morning for breakfast, and got a unanimous 2 thumbs all the way around the table.  I made a few changes to this, and it was phenomonal.  For starters, I used thick (1") sliced whole wheat french bread to cover the bottom of the pan.  I coated the french bread with melted butter, and cinnamon sugar.  I substituted the half and half for heavy cream, and used all eight eggs in the batter.  I added an additional 1/4 of maple syrup, and approximately 1/2 a cup of brown sugar, as well as a heaping teaspoon each of nutmeg and cinnamon, and 3 tablespoons of butter.  I also used the regular Philadelphia cream cheese vice the low fat version.  I let it emulsify all night in the fridge, and in the morning I baked it at 350 degrees for thirty minutes, to find that the knife wouldn't come clean in the center.  I baked it for an additional 10 minutes, and it came out just right.  I would suggest checking it at 30 with the knife, and using that as your guage for when it's done.  It came out with a delicious sweet taste, that was not overbearing, and light and fluffy, with a very smooth texture.  It wasn't too soggy at all.  I served it up with grated sweet potato hash browns cooked with diced bacon and chopped onion, and linked sausage.  It was EXACTLY what Christmas breakfast in the firehouse, or any house, should be.  This was delicious throughout the day cold, and would also make a great dessert.  Don't forget the confection

Followed recipe to the letter and it was very bland and soggy.  For those of you who rave about this recipe, what makes it so great?  I don't get it.  This was a flavorless mess.

I thought this recipe was great. I printed it off before a vacation to Florida and made it for the whole family while we were there. They all loved it. Easy to make.

Needs some more work. Followed other posts and reduced to 6 eggs and 1 cup of milk. Also added 1 teaspoon of cinnamon and nutmeg. Still kinda blah. Pepperidge Farms cinnamon, raisin, or maple syrup bread might help. Will also add 1 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice. Will make a couple more times with these changes before giving up.

This recipe is FANTASTIC!!!  I made it for a holiday brunch and everyone loved it.  I served it with the Brown Sugar Sauce (Which I found here on Allrecipes.com) and it was a huge hit.  It was the first dish I ran out of and my husband has asked me to make a couple more times already!  It is easy, quick to prepare and tastes wonderful.  Also, I prepared it that morning and let it sit for 3 hours in the fridhge and it turned out great - you don't HAVE to let it sit overnight, but you need to give the bread time to soak up the liquid.  This is a Bread pudding it will not be crunchy like french toast - Just be aware of that.

After reading all the reviews, I made some changes, I used bread I made from my bread machine, 4 oz of cream cheese, 1/2 cup of syrup, 4 eggs, 1 cup of half and half.  It turned out really good, not soggy, not eggy tasting.  Actually better than regular french toast and less work.  I did half the pan, and I baked it 35 minutes covered and 20 uncovered. Served it with Honey Creme Syrup.  This is really good, thanks!

As in other posts, the outside edges and the top of this dish were very tasty.  The center middle was a gloppy, soupy mess.  I will try this one again following some of the other posts about dryer, harder bread.  All in all, not bad and worth the effort.

I used 6 eggs and cubed a loaf of french bread.  The crusty bread kept it from getting soggy.  A huge hit at my job!  I'll definitely make this again.

very fluffy and light in texture.  I cut the recipe down to 1/3 and made it in a 1-Qt casserole.  Followed some other users' advice and tossed the mixture a couple of times and did not have a soggy problem at all.

Very very good. A great "base" recipe for a yummy casserole. I tweaked it just a bit. I found a bread called "French Toast Bread" at the supermarket (Vons). I cubed 2/3's of a loaf, and followed the recipe and advice of others (I used 6 eggs) and also added brown sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg, and Butter Pecan Syrup to the cream cheese mixture. Before pouring the egg mixture onto the bread, I sprinkled the bread with cinnamon and brown sugar. After the casserole baked, I squeezed a swirl of syrup onto it so it would melt into the souffle. It's a great recipe! I made it for an Easter Brunch, and I will DEFINETLEY be making it for a Baby Shower Brunch that I'm having in June. YUUUUMY YUMMMY! Everyone LOVED IT!

This was a big hit when I served it at breakfast for some friends.  I like things more on the dry side than the soggy side so I used the previously recommended 6 eggs, and between 10 & 11 cups of Pepperidge Farms cinnamon swirl bread, which is almost a loaf and a half.  (I don't think I would have enjoyed this near as much made with white bread.) I didn't change anything else in the recipe but I did serve it with heated maple syrup and it was VERY GOOD. THANK YOU BETTY!!

This was awesome.  I used about 5 very large plain bagels cut into cubes instead of bread.  My theory being it's much less soggy as bagels have more crust to them.  YUM!  I forgot to add the eggs one at time, oops! But it turned out fine.  Also used 6 large eggs instead of 10 small.  Thanks, I'll make French Bagel Souffle again soon!

My husband and I both enjoyed this dish -- and he generally doesn't like "sweet" breakfast dishes. I used only five eggs, added about a half-teaspoon of almond extract along with the vanilla, and sprinkled it with cinnamon before baking. I served it with fresh strawberries.

We made this last year for Christmas morning and I'd forgotten to buy bread, but we had left over cinnamon buns. Cut them up and used them instead and it was FABULOUS! Making it the same way again this year.

This recipe is not at all what I expected. It's not anywhere near a souffle, so that is extremely misleading. It's definitely more like a bread pudding. The bottom was slightly soggy and was a slightly unpleasant texture.
I ended adding cinnamon, nutmeg, and brown sugar. Without those additions it would have been completely flavorless. 
I will probably never make this ever again.

This is a good alternative to the usual savory breakfast casserole. The second time I made it I sprinkled one cup of blue berries over the top which added a little different flavor and a little nutritional boost.

I just have to say how much I enjoyed the previous review on this recipe. It really is true that people change so many things about recipes that it's difficult to see how they can accurately review a recipe. At any rate, I made this exactly the way the recipe was written. It came out great and everyone that tried it asked for more. The only change I would consider making is adding a teaspoon of cinnamon to the liquid. Thanks for the great recipe Betty!

This is a great starter recipe. I ran out of white bread so I used 1/2 cinnamon rasin and 1/2 white. The casserole came out superb!

Great treat, easy to make! Made this for my family and my girlfriend and it was awesome! It turned out wonderfully and will do this again for sure. Great tip on using butter instead of oil, kick it up a notch, BAM!

I wasn't impressed with this recipe.  I'm not sure if I did something wrong or what, but the bread on the top got too crusty and burnt tasting and the souffle part underneath was mushy.  Don't think this is a winner in my house. Sorry

My family loved this, but I really felt that something was lacking.  It would have been so much better with cinnamon.  But it's super easy and great comfort food.

I've prepared this dish many times in the last couple of years.  My co-workers even request it on our "food days".  I've found that using thick Texas toast bread gives the best results - holds up better than regular bread with the "drenching" of the egg mixture.  I also use a 9 by 13 glass baking dish - that way, I can keep an eye on how it's browning.  One more thing - I always bake for 40 minutes.  It rises nicely, is not too brown and is moist in the middle without being soggy.  Delicious!

This recipes is actually from cooking light, and my grandmother gave it to me. I was so glad to find it online here at allrecipes since I have a tendency to lose papers. BUT THIS IS SOOOOO good! super easy to make and can be made the night before, so its great for easy brunch entertaining. You can add some grand manier and orange zest, and it adds great flavor to the souffle. I made both one with orange and one without, and everyone who tried it loved both, but the orange was the first to be finished! but everyone wanted to take the rest home... great recipe, and love the fact that its not too sweet because people can decide whether or not they want to put maple syrup on it. BUT AWESOME!

I'm am not a very experienced cook and I managed to make this recipe and have it come out very well. Even some fussy eaters liked it. I used challah instead of white bread and probably had about 12 cups of bread pieces rather than 10.  I also used 4 eggs and 4 eggs worth of egg substitute.  I used real half and half, but I'll try fat free half and half next time. Mine puffed up like a souffle and smelled really good. Like many others, I also added cinnamon and nutmeg on top before baking and I included some walnuts in the bread mixture.  I think this recipe is probably very forgiving in terms of being able to tweak it according to one's preferences.

After reading the other reviews that suggested using less milk and eggs I decided to try it...it was wonderful!  I also used 11 cups of cubed bagels as opposed to bread and it tasted just like french toast - not soggy at all!  I decreased the eggs to 6 and used slightly less than 1 1/2 cups of milk.  I also added 1 tsp of cinnamon to the egg mixture.  It was wonderful!  Many, many people requested the recipe!

the first time I made this it turned out a little bland but not soggy. I followed some reviewers tips (adding butter) and this time, it was full of flavor but soggier. My kids do love it either way, but I'm not sure if I'll make it again.

both my husband and I LOVED this recipe! I did make a couple changes in the basic recipe, which was adjusted to 3 servings: Whole wheat bread (I refuse to use white) and to keep the fat down, I used 1 whole egg and 1/4 cup whites, and 2 tbsp of low fat plain yogurt. After it baked, I mixed some fresh raspberries, blueberries, white chocolate, and slivered almonds. I didn't top it with the confectioners sugar, but mixed some in with some plain yogurt as a sauce. I look forward to making this again, but maybe trying it with diced apples, chopped pecan, and butterscotch chips!

This was okay.  I prefer the creme brulee casserole on this site but tried this one because I liked the idea of the inclusion of cream cheese.  The kids and my husband thought it was okay but asked I go back to the "other" way of making french toast casserole.

Very good recipe.  I think it tastes best when you use 12 grain bread and honey & nut cream cheese.  In the reviews section - you can rate by most helpful.  I have used the suggestion of using less cream cheese, adding syrup, & less eggs, plus more half & half & thickly buttering the pan.  I often get this as a request.  Taste great.  My only caution - you do need to let it set in the fridge for a few hours (at least).  This way everything has a chance to set.  And don't forget to let it set out so you don't break your dish (been there done that).  Will keep and make often!

Great flavor.  We didn't care for the bread pudding texture for breakfast, but would be an excellent dessert with the right sauce on it.  Used sour dough french bread and loved that the cream cheese melted in so that my picky husband didn't notice it.

This recipe was good b/c I heeded the advice of member "trouts328".  I thought that the souffle turned out very flavorful, and you only needed a dab of syrup for this dish.  My parents raved about it!!!

This is delicious!  I make it for every brunch occasion.  Only things I add to it is some vanilla extract and a generous sprinkling of cinnamon before it goes in the fridge.  I serve with a blueberry sauce made from frozen blueberries, orange juice, almond extract and thickened with cornstarch.

My family liked this well enough but nobody asked for me to make it again.  They all put syrup on it.  I let the bread stale so it wouldn't be too mushy and that seemed to work out well.  One of my daughters even ate the leftovers for dinner when the main dish was too spicy for her, so I guess it was reasonably successful.

I've never been a huge french toast fan, however, my kids are and they loved this dish. If you're going to use white bread I suggest using a dense one rather than the soft poofy kind, or you'll end up with mush. I took the advice of others and used a hearty cinnamon swirl bread and also added cinnamon to the liquid. The souffle didn't have any sog at all, but maybe it was because I halved the recipe but used the same size pan as the recipe suggested. I topped each serving with powdered sugar and drizzled syrup around the plate. This was so easy Betty and it was really nice to have breakfast ready to just pop into the oven. Thanks a heap!

I served this as part of my Mother's Day brunch, and had nothing but rave reviews.  The only change that I made was that I substituted a cinnamon raisin bread (and sometimes apple bread when I can find it) for the white bread.  That made a big difference - for those who feel that it was not sweet enough.  I served it with maple and regular syrup, but no one used it.

I had four requests for the recipe after I served this - so it had to be good.

At first, I thought that I was going to be disappointed with the final product. However, after letting it "set" after removing it from the oven, it was great! I recieved several compliments from coworkers. YUM! Let it cool almost completely before enjoying this yummy souffle!

This is excellent.  I used one loaf of cinnamon raisin bread, 5 large eggs, and pure maple syrup. Excellent without the powdered sugar or additional syrup.

This recipe is excellent!  I am not a big French Toast fan, but I loved this one!  I also used the Cinnamon swirl bread, and toasted it in the oven first for a few minutes.  I used only 6 eggs, a little less milk, and 11 cups of bread- it came out wonderfully!  It was not soggy at all.  I will make this one again!

This recipe was nothing short of wonderful!  I substituted breakfast bread (a cinnamon swirl bread with raisins)for the white bread and used skim milk and low fat cream cheese to lighten it up a bit.  My boys and I made it up the night before and it was super easy to put together.  We refrigerated it for the night, took it out the next morning and let it sit the required 30 minutes, then plopped it in the oven.  We left it covered and at the end of the 30 minutes, it still seemed somewhat soggy.  So, I uncovered it and put it back in the oven for another 15 minutes which caused it to come out perfectly!  This is a wonderful, melt in your mouth, very filling, very tasty dish that's super easy to make.  We usually have stuffed french toast on Thanksgiving and Christmas morning; however, my family has decided to toss out that old recipe for this one.  YES, it's that good!!!  Thanks so much for sharing.

Well, I did the recipe as written and then dotted with butter and sprinkled with a mix of white and brown sugar and cinnamon, as I prefer it sweeter. Then family drizzled syrup over it and a shake of powdered sugar. MMMMMMM so great. I made another version of this before, but I really think this one was better. I also tossed the bread around and I put it into two round cake pans. The result was not too eggy, and it had crispy yummy bits on top from the butter and from baking. Everyone love it.

We will often use a loof of french bread, cover with foil and then remove foile 5 minutes before it is done cooking.  We never have issues with casserole being soggy.

This is one of the better French Toast dishes I have made.  I liked that the cream cheese is blended with the half/half - milk before pouring over the bread.  I modified by using Cinnamon Swirl bread, adding 1/4 cup of brown sugar to the mixture and only used 6 eggs (actually Eggbeaters equivolent to 6 eggs) and cut the milk to 1 cup.  I was also very generous with the "10 cups" of bread.  Sprinkled the top with a couple of tablespoons of brown sugar and some cinnamon before baking.  Baked for a hour and it was not mushy at ALL.

Pretty good, but I don't agree that this tastes like French toast.  It's more like a bread pudding.  I put it in a bowl overnight and stirred it a couple of times throughout, and then transferred to a baking pan in the morning.  I baked this twice as long; I'm not a huge fan of soggy bread.  We enjoyed this, and it really isn't too sweet.  We don't have syrup, so bf added honey to it to make it a little sweeter for him.  Bc I didn't have syrup, I used honey in the recipe itself along with maple flavoring.  worked well.  Thanks for the recipe!

Tried this 3 times. Getting it to cook evenly was the challenge I just couldn't meet. Middle was always soggy. Edges were always over-done and tough. Regular old french toast is way easier and tastier.

This was pretty good, but not as great as I hoped.  I made it exactly according to the recipe except I used cinnamon raisin bread instead of white bread.  It was the texture that I didn't like...it was too mushy.  Maybe I made the cubes too large.  I wish the recipe would have advised what size of bread cubes to use...mine were about one-inch square and 1/2 inch thick.

This recipe turned out incredible when I used 6 supermarket bakery croissants instead of white bread.  Feel free to use day old, it makes no difference.  I used 6-7 eggs depending on size of eggs based on others reviews.  Also, this needs to cook for MUCH longer, at least 60-70 minutes.

This is a great recipe.  I have made it at least twice this year while having company.  Just make the night before and bring out in the morning and pop in the oven.  Using real maple syrup helps plus adding  a little cinnamon to the 10X sugar helps.  It's a great recipe and IF there is any left over it is still good the next day, heated up.  Love it and will continue to use it.

After reading all the reviews, I thought I'd never make this souffle - there were so many modifications, suggestions, etc. that I was ready to give up. I use all the ingredients and made some changes to a few: Decrease eggs by 2, add 1 tablespoon white sugar, use 11 cups of bread (I mix cinnamon raisin bread and French Toast bread from Safeway), and add 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon. Bake about 1 hour - everyone loves it!

I keep making different variations of recipes like this thinking that my family and I will like it. Only thing different I did was stir in a cup of blueberries. It baked up perfectly and we all ate it. I just don't think that any strata is for us, no matter how you change up the name or different ingredients. Only person who really enjoyed it was my youngest son, who ate his portion and his brothers.

Delicious and easy to make! Followed another users advice and Used 1tsp vanilla, 1tsp cinnamon, 1tsp nutmeg, 6 eggs and 1 1/4 cup milk. Added strawberries and whipped cream for topping. made once with white bread and once with cinnamon raisin bread. Both taste great.

I did not care for this recipe! I prepared it for a brunch we were planning with family. I read the majority of the reviews as I always do to get a sense of what might need to be done to make a good recipe that much better. It seemed the consensus agreed that it had to many eggs and needed baked longer. So I adjusted accordingly. I used 6 eggs instead of 8 and baked it 45 minutes instead of 30. It was a mushy tasteless mess. Luckily for me the brunch was canceled so the only one subjected to it was myself and my husband. We each took one bite and didn't eat the rest. I am going to try one more time only I am going to cut the milk way down (at least by half if not even totally) add more maple syrup and melt some butter and brown sugar together to add to the mixture. It is not the egg content making this dish mushy as eggs solidify but the mass amount of milk that is in it.

We made this last minute and didn't have cream cheese - so instead of cream cheese, milk and half&half - we used 1/4 cup butter, 1 cup heavy whipping cream, 6 eggs, 1 tsp vanilla, 1 tsp cinnamon, 1/2 tsp nutmeg, 1/2 cup syrup and 1/2 cup white sugar.  Poured over half loaf of white bread cut in cubes in a 9x9 baking dish and baked at 375F for 45 minutes.  It was perfect and not a crumb left.

I'm not much on breakfast but i've been wanting to do this one for a while now.  Wow, I'm glad I did.  It was really, really good! It was easy to put together, I especially liked the day-ahead preparation.         Thanks for the post.

This tastes great!  I made a few minor changes based on previous reviews.  Nothing major, just what seemed to work for other people.  I didn't make it overnight because I didn't have the time.  I made it the morning of, and let the ingredients soak together for about 45 minutes before putting it in the oven.  I used French bread.  I added 1/2 stick of butter, because other reviews said it made a difference, plus I increased the vanilla to 1 tsp. and added 1 tsp. of cinnamon.  Also, I didn't have maple syrup in the house, so I used honey.  Again, this was a GREAT recipe and everyone in our house LOVED it!  I will definitely make it again!

Found this from Cooking Light. Excellent recipe, very easy. I used whole slices of stale white bread. I did flip the slices before cooking so that all sides were evenly coated with egg mixture.

When I make french toast I use a bit of cinnamon in the egg and milk dip. This recipe did not call for cinnamon, so when I sifted the powdered sugar on top I also added a bit of cinnamon.  This recipe is absoulutely delicious!!

Yummy! Perfect for lazy Sunday morning brunch. Don't worry about it if you don't have time to let this sit overnight. I've made it before in the morning, and I just let it sit out 30 minutes or so before baking. I gave it five stars, but I added a few flavors to compliment the base recipe; a splash or two of orange juice (I never measure!), a few shakes of cinnamon, and a little nutmeg really add depth. I sprinkle cinnamon sugar on top as well. I'm looking forward to trying this cold as a left-over, but so far I've never had the chance...there's never any left!

I am giving it 4 stars because it is a very nice basic recipe. However, I have made some changes because I felt it needed "something". After trying it exactly as the recipe suggested, I made it again with a few changes. I used an italian bread (I have tried it with challah too- yummy!) I took frozen berries and sprinkled them with a little sugar (to taste really). I put the berries in a small saucepan and let them reduce into a yummy sauce. I then drizzled that sauce on the souffle after it came out of the oven. You may wish to add fresh berries after you drizzle the sauce. I used this instead of using maple syrup. I served it to a friend who said it was divine.

I thought this was wonderful. It was not so sweet as other similar recipes. Also fewer calories. I baked just a little longer. It turned out very fluffy. Followed the recipe exactly.  I took it to a church brunch and everyone loved it and asked for the recipe. Keep extra syrup handy for those who like it sweet.

I made this last weekend to test it out for Christmas, and we loved it!!  However the Souffle collapsed after taking it out of the oven (had to bake it for one hour) so we are goig to make a few changes to it, and try it again.

Changes:
* Cut Milk to 1 cup
* Use 1 Cup of Half & Half
* Add an additional pkg. of Cream Cheese (16 oz. total)
* Use Cinnimon Swirl Loaf of Bread
* Add some Brown Sugar on top (1/2 Cup probably) 
* 1 pkg. thawed frozen Strawberrys or Blueberrys as a garnish (not baked in the Souffle).

This was amazing with some changes I made ;) got many compliments from my friends staying for the weekend.  I mixed everything together in the pan before covering it for the night.  I added 1 container of fresh blueberries with the bread/egg mixture.  I cut the milk a bit and used a full cup of fat free half and half.  I used a full tsp of vanilla, and used the "texas toast" (thick sliced) style bread (a whole loaf) instead of plain white bread.  I also used a corningware pan that was larger than a 9x13 so that it was a thinner covering across the pan (had read some reviews that it is soggy).  I also ended up baking it about 40min.

Thanks for the good recipe base :) its now part of my book.

This is a Christmas morning tradition in our household.  Very easy recipe. Very yummy, too! You can't go wrong with cream cheese! I added raisins to my souffle - very yummy! BUT, make the raisins are buried in the bread because the ones on top can get burnt & they taste bitter instead of sweet. You might even want to put the raisins on at the very end of the baking process so they don't have time to get "burnt".

Because this recipe needed too many adjustments, I couldn't give it five stars.  I did all of the things that the others suggested (cinnamon bread, six eggs, lots of cinnamon, brown sugar, nutmeg, I even sprinkled a pinch of salt over the bread before I added the cream cheese mixture); however, the next time I make this, I'm going to add 1/4 to 1/2 cup granulated sugar after I beat the cream cheese.  I'll let you know how that turns out.

This is a real family favorite in our house. I've been using this recipe for a couple of years now, it is so good. I use regular cream cheese just because that's our preference, and I always sprinkle with a cinnamon-sugar mixture before baking. Great recipe...thank you!!

This is a consistent hit with my large family and anyone who happens to join us for breakfast. I buy french bread loaves from the day-old (or older!) rack at the market. That way, the bread is already a little on the dry side. Once home, I cube it (2 in cubes)then I store those in the freezer until I am ready to make this recipe.  I follow the recipe exactly, with the only addition being 1/2 tsp of almond extract. If I have dried fruit on hand  (apples, raisins, cranberries) I add a handful to the recipe and it is always tasty. Thanks for a great recipe for this busy Mom!

I don't think I will make this one again, I used cinnamin swirl bread also like alot of other people suggested, I also toasted it first, but my kids didn't like this at all. It is like a custard bread pudding texture. It didn't come out soggy but my 8yr old son wouldn't eat it, he took a bite and spit it out. I think it was because of the texture of it. Although it does smell good while it's baking, I suggest if you don't like bread pudding then don't try this one.

I have made this twice, once using french bread and the other using texas toast, I also added a teaspoon of cinnamon and 1/2 tsp of nutmeg.   Both times it was a huge success and will continue to make this cause it is tasty, easy, and convenient.

Terrible. I had to cook it for 90 minutes, and was still not cooked. Tasted like scrambled eggs. If you don't want to listen to me and you really must make it, 4 eggs would be enough. And I'd recommend more syrup in the batter. The only saving grace was the blueberry syrup I made from another recipe.

I loved this and so did my husband.
I *halved*  the recipe and used the following swaps:
- Used ~ 5 oz of vanilla Greek yogurt instead of cream cheese
- Used 3 eggs total
- Added 1/8 C butter
- Used 3/4 C of  half and half and milk mixed 1:1
- Used 3C of French  bread cubed into 3/4" cubes
- Used 2C of sourdough bread cubed
- Used 1/4 C maple syrup
Sprinkled cinnamon over top and a bit of raw sugar before sitting frig overnight. 
Cooked as directed (sat out for 30 min before cooking) at 375 F for 45min without a cover in smaller casserole dish on Christmas morning and served warm with blueberries and red raspberries.  
I was totally awesome and using the yogurt and sourdough gave it a less-sweet, perfect flavor. My picky husband told me not to change a thing and I agreed! So good - made 4 servings.

I've been making this for years now, I sometimes add more cream in the morning and/or replace half the cream with milk. It always gets rave reviews! Great for Sunday School breakfast potlucks since all you do the morning after is throw it in the oven!
My modified recipe is as follows- 1 loaf texas toast/french toast bread, only 6 eggs, only 1/2 cup maple syrup, one pint of heavy cream, 1/2 stick softened butter, 1/2 cup milk, 1 8 oz brick of cream cheese, Sometimes add 1 cup frozen blueberries, or 2 tsp cinnamon. This goes into 1 oversized 10x15 dish or, two pie dishes. I will also bake covered for 30 minutes and uncovered for  and additional 15 or so. (Altered recipe requires this) I smother butter all over the top while it's still piping hot before sprinkling with the powdered sugar.

I really enjoyed this recipe.  I took the advice of some other reviews and changed the following.  2 handfuls of brown sugar and one less egg (they were large).  I also added cinnamon and fresh blueberries.  Raspberries would also be delicious and pretty.  When it was done baking I sprinkled it with cinnamon and sugar.  Yummy!

Per other reviews, I tossed the bread cubes with a little cinnamon and sugar mixture and it was great.  My only complaint is it is a bit soggy.  I will tweak the time/temperature or perhaps add more bread, but I will definitely make again.  Great make-ahead recipe for a change from basic meat & cheese quiche.

I also modified the recipe by using the suggestions below.  I only used 6 eggs, cinnamon swirl bread, a tsp of extra cinnamon, and 1/2 cup of brown sugar.  I stired it twice before baking so that the bread was uniformly coated and all the liquid wasn't on the bottom.  I also cooked about 10 minutes longer.  We could not taste the cream cheese so I may add extra next time.  It turned out great and I will make it again.

I liked this recipe. I, like many here, changed a few things. Along with using cinnamon bread, I added cinnamon and a 1/2 tsp salt to the egg mixture. It needed a little to bring out the flavors.

This was such an easy recipe.  I do have to admit that I did make one change.  I used Italian Panetonne Bread instead of white bread and added some extra raisins.  My family raved ! It was gone is seconds.

This is my go-to brunch recipe.  I've served this for several crowds, and it's always popular.  I use cinnamon or cinnamon raisin bread whenever I can, and only about 6 eggs, depending on the size of the egg.  Cooking time was longer than 30 minutes--closer to 60.

I made this for an Easter brunch at church. I used some butter as suggested and I added a little extra maple syrup then called for. I thought this was very good and it was all ate up! I am even making it tonight for a quick breakfast tomorrow and thought about maybe adding some chocolate chips sparingly on top. I reccomend this recipe, it's really good.

I used six eggs and added about 2/3 cup of evaporated milk I had left over.  Also added a little sugar to the egg mixture and sprinkled the bread with cinnamon and some nutmeg.  I don't think you can go wrong with this recipe!

I made this for an easy prepare ahead of time Christmas morning breakfast and it was so yummy. I ended up halving the recipe since I only needed to feed 2 people. I used 3 eggs and eyed my bread to fill a 9x9 pan. This was light and not heavy like traditional french toast.

This was basically a bread pudding that just wasn't very good. The texture was very mushy and the flavor was bland. I did add cinnamon because I couldn't imagine french toast without it but it did little to improve the taste. I have a great bread pudding recipe that I will stick with. As written, even with cinnamon, I could not recommend this recipe.

Yummy...I did change one thing. Instead of white bread I used some apple fritter bread I had bought. It gave it just a little boost in the flavor. All in all I will make this agian!

I made this for a group while we were on vacation.  It is wondeful.  Easy to make and convenient to make ahead the night before.  Everyone loved it.  It would really be good to add cinnamon or some other flavoring.  I think fresh strawberries or blueberries would complete it perfectly.  Thank you!  I will be making this again and again.

This was really good and a snap to put together.  My kids "don't like French Toast".... aka "they haven't tried it..." and both of them seemed to be able to put this away without problem.  I made it as written, but divided in 1/2... next time, I will stir the bread and egg mixture before refrigerating... as it seemed that the eggs settled to the bottom 1/2 and left the top 1/2 rather crouton-y.  I cubed up part of a French baguette.... the texture was really nice.  A keeper!  Thank you for sharing!

This recipe was great! I made this for Christmas brunch exactly as the diretions said and everyone loved it. I did cook it for longer than the recipe called for, but I didn't let it sit for 30 minutes before baking. I also added pecans and brown sugar - amazing!

I made this recipe for Christmas morning.  I love the idea of the overnight casseroles, but my husband doesn't like them because they have too much "stuff".  I halved the recipe and used a thick, cinammon bread and it came out perfect!  Delicious - everyone loved it (husband, 4 year old and 18 months).  Served it with fresh blueberries as well and that really was the perfect topper.  Will make again!

extremely good for the amount of effort put in.  I did bake covered for 25 mins, then uncovered for 15 mins. I didn't have any mushy parts.  I added a lot of cinnamon and 2 tsp of nutmeg.  I love making this when we have a houseful over for breakfast.  Everyone eats at the same time!!!  No waiting for the next piece of french toast!

This was just o.k.  I would agree with other reviewers in that I felt it needed something...just not sure what.  I will probably try again with another reviewer's changes; adding butter and cinnamon.  That may have been what it needed.  Thanks.

On a recent trip to California, we had a breakfast dish at a B&B that was awesome. I went hunting for a recipe, and this one is very close. I made 1/2 the recipe which was more than enough for 4 people. I served it topped with mixed berries (frozen, then thawed) including some of the juice. Thanks so much for sharing the recipe Betty.

I have made this numerous times for groups (teenagers, college students, showers, brunches) and it gets rave reviews every time.  Someone always asks foe the recipe.  It is delicious and a definite crowd pleaser.

WOW! Thats really all I can say about this.  It was amazing! I made it for Christmas morning and it was  HUGE HUGE hit.  Even the kids loved it.  The only changes I made where a little x-tra maple syrup and used 6 eggs instead of 8.  Turn out perfect, served it with blueberrys and strawberries!

The taste on this souffle was wonderful.  My guests went back for seconds and thirds.  The only reason it's not 5 stars is that it took much longer than 30 minutes to bake, leaving everyone hungry and waiting for an extra 45 minutes.  Yeah, my bake time until all ingredients were set (and I followed the recipe exactly) was 1 hour and 15 minutes.  Still, worth the wait, I just wish I would have known.

Absolutely delicious!  Made this exactly as stated, except needed to cook for 45 minutes to get a nice crunchy crust on top!  Even reheated very well the next day!  Will become a Christmas morning staple in our house!

This recipe is a good one I use when I cater breakfast for my clients. I dont use regular bread, I use day old danish, It gives this casserole a nice kick in the mouth.

Loved when my mother used to make this and just taught it to my class mates in baking and pastry class. Very Yummy with cut up apples mixed in and even better with strawberry jelly.

Followed others advice and used 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/4 cup white sugar.  I used 1 cup heavy cream with 1 cup milk and added a chopped apple. Its over half gone.  Delish!!  will make again, thanks for sharing!!!

My husband and I really enjoyed this dish.  Only used 6 eggs, 3/4 cup syrup, no half and half--increased milk instead, and I baked this about 20 minutes longer to be sure the middle was not soggy.  To also avoid sogginess, it helps to really stir up the bread cubes with the mixture before putting in the pan.  Served with bacon and strawberries.  Had a few pieces leftover so froze them to enjoy another weekend!

This was as great as the reviews.  I was looking for a secret pal breakfast recipe and tried it with my family the Saturday before. I used the adaptations of fat-free milk and milk in place of the whole milk and half-and-half.  It was wonderful.

I made this recipe for Easter for my family.  They loved it and said it was a hit.  I followed TROUTS328 recipe below...I liked that she used butter and cream in the recipe for more flavor.  Just keep an eye on the soufle.  I set my timer for 60 minutes and it was done in about 54.  It started to get crusty on top.  Very yummy!!!!

This is the greatest thing since the paper clip.  I made it for my church brunch, and everyone loved it.  I am now nominated to cook for the mens bible group.  It is so easy and so delicious, I will never make regular french toast again.

Made this for a baby shower and everyone liked it.  I thought it was ok.  My biggest complaint was that it took longer than the 30 minutes to cook - probably about 45 and I was afraid that it was still too eggy in the middle.  But it disappeared from the table, so everyone else liked it!!

Very good recipe.  As other reviewers did, I also used the pepperidge farm cinnamon & brown sugar bread, about two loaves, and I also baked for a little longer, just to have it a little on the crispy side.  Everyone seemed to enjoy it and I recieved many compliments.

I changed the recipe a bit, as suggested by other readers.  It turned out pretty good.  I don't think I would make it again.  It was nice for a one timer but that is it.

I just went ahead and made as suggested by TROUTS328, except with 5 eggs and 1 c. half n half, since I only used 1/2 a loaf of cinnamon bread. Didnt use the milk. Easy and excellent!! Will double for more guests and make in 9x13 next time.

I made this for Easter breakfast and everyone enjoyed it.  The only two changes I made were to use cinnamon bread instead of white.  The bread is firmer and added a great taste.  I also used only 6 eggs as others have stated in their reviews.  This will be made for all special occasions.

I made this for Christmas brunch using a 12 oz. loaf of challah.  I added cinnamon and sprinkled it with walnuts before baking.  It was tasty and enjoyed by all.  Served it with powdered sugar, sauteed apples and maple syrup - would do again.

This was very good and easier to make than regular French toast.  I liked the ease of popping it into the oven the next morning.  I thought that it tasted better the second day.  It made a great lunch.

This recipe was at big success for our carry in at work.  I followed the advice of some of the others and used french bread, used 6 eggs, and uncovered it before baking and it turned out wonderfully!  I then served it with maple syrup.  Thanks for the good advice!

The entire faculty loved this at our breakfast! I think the reason some people say it is soggy, is that they don't uncover the casserole before baking. Don't keep the foil on!

This recipe is okay.  It's not a flavorful as real french toast.  I significantly decreased the eggs and milk and it came out a little dry.  But nothing a little syrup couldn't fix.

This recipe was generally very good, with modifications.  To keep the recipe from being soggy, I lightly toasted the bread (and I made about 11 cups of cubes) and used 6 large eggs.  I aslo sprinkled cinnamon on it before baking.

This recipe was an immediate hit with all of my family from age 4-70.  It is now in the hands of many more friends and family and they have all tried it and will not make the traditional french toast again.

I HAVE A VACATION HOME IN THE MOUNTAINS WHERE I HAVE FREQUENT GUESTS.  I SERVED THIS RECIPE TO TWO DIFFERENT GROUPS.  EVERYONE WANTED THE RECIPE. I THINK THAT SPEAKS FOR ITSELF.  IT IS VERY GOOD.  I ALSO SERVED SLICED STRAWBERRIES TO SPRINKLE ON TOP.

Delicious and easy.  Guests loved waking up to the aroma while it was baking. I used 7 large eggs and it was perfect.  Served with fruit for a wonderful meal.

I made this with skim milk and fat free cream cheese, but still used the half and half.  It was delicious and people were asking for the recipe!!

This recipe is real good.  It has the consistency of a bread pudding.  When you put the maple syrup over it, it really tastes like french toast.

Amazing to make and enjoyed it a lot. My only regret was that it was a bit dry, but adding some more maple syrup to that fixed it right up!

I had a hard time getting all of the cream cheese to mix in. I needed to bake it a few extra minutes. I thought the end result was just average - nothing extra special. I'd try another French Toast casserole-type dish next time.

Had to alter the recipe to improve outcome.
I used day old dutch loaf of bread. 8 Eggs seemed like too much so i reduced it to 5 eggs. I added a little bit more milk, 1 tablespoon of cinnamon, a little butter, and 2 tablespoons of brown sugar.  Baked it  covered for the first 35 mins and uncovered the last 5 minutes. Definitely came out better.  The powdered sugar and syrup on top perfects the sweetness. Texture was perfect.

This is just down right delicious!  Everyone who eats this loves it and begs for the recipe.  It's really easy to prepare and leaving it overnight just adds more flavor.  It's wonderful; you must make it!

I used the revision that TROUTS328 and it was delicious. My family loved it. The only thing I would have done different would be to add nutmeg and cinnamon in with the eggs, maybe 2-3 teaspoons each, to give it a little more spice.

I thought this was very good.  I halfed the recipie and it seemed to come out great!  I would recommend adding some cinniamon and nutmeg to taste to give it a little flavor, the maple syrup is not enough!  Also, next time I make it I will cut up cooked slices of breakfast sausage and mix with bread cubes before I add egg mixture.  Over all easy and a crowd pleaser!!!

i made this for a work potluck and it was a HUGE hit!.  For the most part I followed the recipe, but did tweak it slightly.  I added some cinnamon to the bread cubes and a little brown sugar since some of the other reviews said it wasn't sweet enough. I think using cinnamon swirl bread would fix this problem.  I also substituted  four of the eggs with egg substitute and used sugar free wheat bread.  It was really fantastic.  I will definitely make this the next time I have people over.

This was so delicious! I had to make a few changes based on what I had on hand: I used whole wheat bread and all 2% milk (no cream). Much healthier and it still had a ton of flavour. I also sprinkled some cinnamon right before baking, just because I really like the flavour. Some reviewers said they found it bland and/or soggy. I didn't find either to be the case. I served the maple syrup and banana sauce from this site and it went really well. The best part is that can you prep it the night before and it's virtually no trouble to finish in the morning. Makes it a perfect dish if you are having guests. I will be making this all the time.

I liked the idea that you just have to wake up Christmas morning and bake this dish.  I thought it really lacked in flavor.  It just needed something.  Maybe putting the syrup in it not on it.  I will continue looking for easy wake and bake dishes.

This was made for Christmas morning. Overall I think it was missing flavor. I even added cinnamon before baking. I wasn't overly impressed. My husband liked it. Regular french toast would have been just as good.

Gave this a trial run as I am planning this for Christmas breakfast. Made exactly as it was written and found it to be a little dry and unflavorful. I would suggest adding cinnamon to the egg mixture and maybe 1-2 more eggs. Otherwise I like the fact my Christmas breakfast will be quick and east this year.

I made this with freshly baked whole-wheat apple bread, so it was super amazing.  Because the bread was so soft, I didn't need to soak overnight either.  This came out more like a bread pudding than a souffle for me, but it was still AMAZING.

Made this totally last minute this morning, looking for something to do with Gluten Free pumpkin bread that didn't turn out quite right. Used the little leftover cream cheese I had, rice milk (maybe 1/2 cup?), and a few TBSP butter, added a dash of vanilla, three eggs, and then used one small loaf pan worth of pumpkin bread broken up. Didn't have time to let it sit, just baked it about 45 m at 375. Turned out great! And because we used the pumpkin bread, it didn't even need syrup or any extra sweetener. Can't wait to try this the way it's written! :)

Kind of blah, but did the trick. Filled some bellies. Next time I will add maybe 4 eggs with 4 egg yolks to give it a richer flavor.

This recipe came through my email one day. Since we were going to our Escapee Chapter Rally, I thought this would be a good dish for a crowd. I was wrong. It was an excellent dish for a crowd and it was gone in no time. It was easy to make and tasted delicious. I did add cinnamon to the powdered sugar on top, but will add it to the eggs next time.

this is an unbelievable breakfast and dessert in one! So decadent and rich, one of the best things Ive ever had--seriously! I highly recommend however, forgetting about the confectioner's sugar, its already SO sweet, and topping it with a fresh, homemade warm strawberry sauce and whipped cream. Maple syrup was just too sweet for this delish dish!

My husband and son, bread eaters through and through, loved this.  I thought it was better than most baked french toast dishes, but lacked the richness I'd expect with the cream cheese and half and half.  I did make one change - no real maple syrup on hand so I used honey.  It was sweet, but not too sweet. Topped it with fresh made blueberry syrup and it was a very filling and very pretty dish.

I made this for my mom on Mother's Day.  It was very simple and very good.  I didn't change a thing.  It baked up beautiful.  I served it warm with fresh sliced strawberries and a dollop of whipped cream.  I would recommend this for any (or no) occasion.

This was more like bread pudding than french toast. I used half the cream cheese and added a couple tbsp of melted butter. I also used cubed french bread instead of white. It was very tasty and my brunch guests really seemed to enjoy it.

This was not my favorite. It definitely needs something like cinnamon, which I couldn't find at the time. It also came out more like a bread pudding than a souffle. The taste was good albeit a little boring.

My family liked it but it needed to bake longer.  I read reviews and baked it for 45 minutes but I actually think 1 hour might have been needed.  I'll make it again.

I made this for Christmas and it was delicious! I followed TROUT'S tips from below as well as added fresh blueberries to the bread mixture. Next time I might try fresh strawberries instead. I think this would even be good with some chopped pecans.

I made this for Christmas breakfast, it was delicious.  And very easy to make.  The recipe itself could probably use a little more syrup in it, but I just served it with syrup on the side if anybody wanted extra.  I also had Strawberries & Blueberries on the side. I will use this recipe again!  Thank you

Made this one for a baby shower and turned out great!  I assembled it in (2) 9x9 baking dishes the night before and followed the directions of Trout (reviewer) by adding butter to the cream cheese mixture.  I used King's Hawaiian Sweet rolls for the bread (2 trays of 12 rolls) and the dish came out light and fluffy.  45 minutes cooked it throughout in my oven.  Will make again!! (great as leftover too!)

This was good - nout outstanding, but good. I made this instead of another recipe I like because my husband doesn't like really really sweet food, at least for breakfast. Based on everyone's comments, I only used 6 eggs, and I used a little extra maple syrup. I would make it again. I think that I just saw this exact recipe in my Best of Cooking Light.

This was just OK.  Everyone ate it, but it wasn't sweet enough, and it was very eggy.  I followed the recipe exactly, except that I added cinnamon sugar to the top (which didn't really make it better).  I think I'll look for something with less eggs and a bit more sugar/sweetener.

This was very delicious! I wanted to try it but didn't want to make a lot, so I cut the recipe in half. The only difference I made was even though I cut it in half, I kept the same amount of maple syrup since the author said it wasn't very sweet. I also sprinkled cinnamon on the top. Super recipe. My 4-year-old son who usually doesn't like the new recipes I make actually liked it. I was surprised but pleasantly so!!!

This recipe needs a lot of additions because otherwise it is pretty bland.  I used cinnamon bread and the sprinkled the bread with a lot of cinnamon, brown sugar, and some nutmeg.  I also drizzled the bread with maple syrup before adding the egg mixture.  I thought the amount of eggs was okay but it needs to bake for at least an hour.  When it comes out of the oven, I pour a little more syrup on the top.  My friend actually has a better recipe for this same kind of souffle and I will have to post it some time.

Delicious recipe; next time I will make it in a larger baking pan (the center tends to be a little too mushy, but the top is delicious).  Absolutley wonderful with strawberries and a little bit of whipped cream.  Thank you for the recipe!!! :)

I love these make-ahead oven breakfast/brunch recipes. I made up a pan of this on the day my daughter moved to her first city apartment. I expected it to have a richer taste, given the cream cheese and half-and-half, but it was pretty ordinary. I wouldn't make this again, not because it's a "bad" recipe but because I have made others that I like better. Love trying new recipes! Thanks.

Very good & easy.  I used 1 pound cinnamon raisin french bread, 6 extra large eggs, all milk instead of milk & half & half, 1 teaspoon vanilla extract & 1 teaspoon cinnamon keeping everything else the same.

This wasn't awful, but we won't be making it again.  It sounded really good, but it was gooey and soggy.  The flavor was so-so and the sog scared my kids away!  I was really excited about it and really let down.

Many of the reviews said this was too sweet, but I did not find it to be sweet at all! I followed the others' suggestions and took the cover off before baking. It got too dry on top and too mushy on the bottom. Not much taste of any kind.

I fixed this for Easter brunch. What a hit it was! I've made several types of French Toast casseroles but this one is decidedly the best. I served sausage,bacon, and melon as accompaniments.

I dont know if I did something wrong or if it turned out the way it was supposed to but it was really soggy.  I even cooked it for 20 extra minutes.  Yuck!  I will not try this one again.

Exelent! However, the second time I made it I added rasins to the mix, and right before serving I decided to put fresh strawberries on top for color and it was a big improvement!

I made this for a brunch.  I personally didn't love it.  But, my guests did.  Several people asked me for the recipe and raved over it!  I will make it again.  I think - next time - I will try it with the cinnamon swirl bread that I read about in someone else's review.  My kids didn't eat it - they are only into straight french toast.

This was a good recipe! I used the cinnamon swirl bread like someone had suggested and added a little more powdered sugar on top.  It was really good, but a small portion of it got soggy in the middle. Maybe next time I will try and bake it a little longer and/or use less eggs.  I made it for my coworkers and they loved it!

This was a big hit. Instead of using the white bread cubes, try cinnamon swirl bread or hawaiian bread.
