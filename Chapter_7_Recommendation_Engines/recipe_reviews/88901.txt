Great recipe. I only made a few changes. My zucchini are large. So I used 1 large zucchini and cut into 1" slices, then cut the slices into 4 pieces.  1 TBSP of salt is too much so I salt and peppered the pieces. I sauteed 1 sliced vidalia onion in olive oil. I mixed 1 TBSP of basil and 2 minced garlic cloves in a can of diced tomatoes. When the onion was soft, I added the zucchini and tomatoes. Cooked over low-medium heat for 20-25 minutes. Stirring occasionally. Then sprinkled with generous amount of parmesan. (probably 1/4 - 1/2 cup) Mixed all together and cooked another 5 min. Not only is it good that night, but left overs are just as tasty.

This was fantastic!  I made it as described, using vidalia onions and adding freshly crushed garlic from 2 cloves.  I served it over linguine and it was a hit - even my 12 yr son loved it!  I've made it with chunks of Italian Turkey Sausage and served over rice, also.

I have made this before. It is so yummy! You can also put all your ingredients in foil and cook on the BBQ for about 20 minutes. Also try with your favorite spaghetti sauce instead of the tomatoes and definately add some garlic.

This was the first time the family has had zucchini. Someone gave a bag full of them to my husband, so I had to look up a recipe for them, and I'm glad this is the one I chose! As one other reviewer had mentioned, I only used enough olive oil to properly saute the onions. I didn't have any italian seasoning, so I added some basil, salt, pepper, and garlic salt. I didn't measure the seasonings, just added to my liking. I also didn't have a can of diced tomatos so I added some tomatoe sauce and I cut up some fresh tomatoes. I will be making this one again!

I was looking for a zucchini/tomato recipe I remembered my mother making... this is it! It is delicious. The only chages I made were cutting back on the salt (I only added a few shakes) and added a little fresh ground pepper. Also, I didn't use as much oil, as suggested by another review, I just used enough to saute the onions. Love, love, love it, and easy, too!

This was really good!  Being a confirmed tweaker, I added garlic, some crushed red pepper and used basil rather than Italian seasoning since I had some fresh.  Yum!  Further proof that good food doesn't have to be complicated.

I have made a similar dish (sans sugar) only, instead of serving over rice, I used the zucchini combination instead of meat to make lasagna. Even my kids loved it, and we're not vegetarians!

Super dish! The perfect way to get picky kids (and husbands) to eat their veggies!  Used a side, but would be wonderful over pasta or rice.  I used one yellow squash and one zucchini, and substituted fresh oregano and basil from the garden for the italian spices.  Thanks for the recipe!

I thought this was really good. I didn't use quite as much salt as called for and I used fresh herbs instead of dried. It made a great side dish.

Athough this tasted alright, the recipe calls for entirely too much olive oil.  I was forced to treat my veggies like a pizza and dab all of the oil off!  Gross!

Excellent recipe.     I used only 1/4c or less of extra virgin olive oil  After saut√©ing onions, I threw in sliced garlic for a bit.   Added a little pepper "to taste".  I could see adding  some red pepper flakes.   Had some fresh basil from the garden, put that in near the end.    At some but then put it over the breaded chicken cutlets I made.  I might add another  small can of diced tomatoes and throw it over macaroni.

This was great my hubby loved it... it's a keeper.
Only thing different I'd do next time is cut down to about a 1/4 c. of olive oil and less salt.

Big thumbs up.  The family loved it.  I didn't measure it, but I cut the oil way back.  I would guess maybe a couple of tsp.  I cooked it in a nonstick skillet so I didn't need much oil - just enough to cook the onion.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This was tasty, but had WAY too much salt.  I added 1/2 tablespoon and it was too salty.  Next time, I'll add 1 teaspoon.  I wondered if this was a typo.

This was very good, but next time I make it, I will reduce the amount of olive oil.  1/2 cup olive oil was just too much, but overall the recipe was simple and delicious.

I followed some of the other reviewers suggestions and added parmesan and Italian turkey sausage and egg noodles.  I also greatly reduced the amount of EVOO and totally eliminated the salt and substituted basil and oregano for the Italian seasoning.  We ended up with a wonderful casserole which we enjoyed with whole wheat dinner rolls for a low fat, high fiber delicious dinner.

If you reduce the oil to a reasonable amount (I just sprayed the pan with EVOO), this recipe makes a fantastic side dish. Nothing too fancy but it goes well with fish or chicken. The pinch of sugar really brings out the sweet taste of tomatoes.

Really good and tasty!  Made with a red onion instead of of white.  Also used a fresh tomato. A great compliment to Chicken Saltimbocca.

We liked this, but it needs a little something.  Garlic would definitely help, and I think increasing the herbs would also be an improvement.  We eat a lot of zucchini and thought this was just okay.

This was a great, easy recipe for a side dish - we made it in winter but I would definitely make again in the summer when zucchini are plentiful!  Good flavor, easy to make and leftovers are wonderful!

Made this with zucchini that a friend gave me and myself and my whole family really enjoyed it.  I did forget to seed the zucchini,(my cooking skills are extremely rusty) but no one seem to care...Delicious, tasty and most important fast and easy.

My husband loved this recipe to my surprise. Only change, I used fresh oregano with italian spices and added some fresh grated parmesan cheese (buy in bulk, freeze slices and keep some in fridge to use ALL the TIME - great for simple pasta etc.)
great recipe to have on hand.

I thought this was great.  I didn't really measure things out, but the combination of zucchini, onion, tomato and italian seasoning was wonderful.  I even added some parmesean cheese before serving.  I will definitey make this again!  Thanks for sharing.

This was very good.  I added a little German sausage I'd gotten on a trip to the onions.  I also added a yellow sqaush, as I happened to have it on hand.  I should have cooked it longer, as the squash were still a little firm, but I really liked turning this into a one dish meal.  My boyfriend said he would have preferred it as a side dish without the sausage, but I liked it.

Made these with a flank steak & baked potato - delicious.  Best zucchini recipe I've found so far.  Going to make them again today.  Thanks for the posting.

I liked this okay but I didn't add tomatoes because I do not like them and I didn't really like the taste of the italian seasoning on it.  Next time I'll just use basil, garlic, S & P.  I think a little more sugar is good too.

This was an awesome dish!  I loved how light it was for a warm summer night.  I used fresh herbs from the garden; oregano, basil and chives.  I replaced a can of stewed tomatoes for fresh.  I served it over fettucine noodles.  Thanks for the great recipe! My whole family had seconds!

I love this recipe.  I used way less oil (about 1 tablespoon) because I wanted it to be lower in fat. I of course added some minced garlic as well as some green peppers and mushrooms.  It is great healthy side to any meat or just with pasta/rice.  I put mine over some tilapia I baked and it was wonderful.

I asked my hubby what this rated as and he said 1*. My brother said 3*. I say 2*. Below average and I found I had to add a lot of flavourings to bring it up to standard. More salt, brown sugar, bbq sauce, worscheshire sauce and still not that great.

I added more spices (pepper, parsley, basil) than what it called for. I prefer lots of spice---not because I thought it lacked flavor. But I think I could have used less oil. The vegetables were bulky in the pan, which may be the reason for the quantity...but made it a bit oily as leftovers.

Oh my, this is now one of my favorite zucchini recipes. I did make a few minor changes suggested by others - much less oil and salt, used 3 med squash, fresh herbs, added garlic and Tony Chachere's. (I'm from La) Also cooked down for about 30 mins to allow tomatoes (no salt added kind) to lose their bite and develop some sweetness, so no sugar needed. This did cook the zucchini well beyond any crispness, so I might try adding them later next time. But the taste is wonderful. Will definitely make again.

I used this recipe for lasagna sauce, so instead of the 1/2 cup of olive oil I fried 1 lb of italian sausage with the onion and added some garlic. I followed the recipe after that except for adding a can of tomato sauce and some more spices(italian oregano basil...) it turned out to be one of the best lasagna sauces I have made and most certainly one of the easiest.  I will definitely be making this again.  Also I will try it served over spaghetti for an easy meal sometime.  Thank you for the great recipe!

This was a great first attempt for us. I used Thyme & Rosemary think next time I will use a bit of sage also.(Instead of italian herbs had none). I used pasta sauce had no tomatoes, should have used more it was a little drier than i would have liked but only used 1 cup so next time will use more, on the whole really nice, will do it again.

This was great.  I did make a few changes as well.  I only used about 2 tbsp olive oil and substituted zucchini with yellow squash,  I also added fresh spinach, garlic and fresh ground pepper. I did not add any salt and before serving I added a touch of parmesan cheese.

This was very good. I used a Mediterranean blend of vegetables of zucchini with other veggies and then added a clove of minced garlic because I just couldn't imagine the olive oil and onion without it. Without the garlic though I think it would be having that "missing something" flavor. My husband said it looked like a heartburn waiting to happen so he wouldn't try any. The hungry teen and I liked it. It was even better after a sprinkle of grated parmesan cheese on top.

Very tasty veggie dish!  I only used 1/2 the zucchini and added about 500g of chopped fresh mushrooms instead, to give it a little more variety.  Thanks, Colee576  :)

I thought it was a good recipe, but the Italian seasoning was a little bit too much for my liking. Possibly decreasing the amount or using a different seasoning would be good.

Great start...but add fresh garlic and omit the salt!  Herbs and garlic are perfect, no need for the high sodium.  Easily 5 stars wihout the salt.

I think the natural flavors of this recipe are masked by the oil.  I might try this again, but substitute the oil with butter or vegetable stock.   As is, it was not well liked by my family.

Excellent. I'm not much of a zucchini/summer squash fan, but we got two from a neighbor and I wanted to use one for dinner tonight. I used one large zuke, sliced my onions instead of wedges, added a few garlic cloves, chopped up some fresh basil leaves and towards the end threw in some bread crumbs also to thicken it.  My inlaws loved it and there was none left over.  PS -- one person noted there was too much salt; I didn't use any and rarely do with most dishes.

A tablespoon of salt is way too much. Even if you follow the 4 portion, guide its almost your entire day's worth of sodium in a vegetable dish. Leave it out and slat/pepper to taste per serving.

Great recipe. Reduced salt to teaspoon, added garlic, fresh herbs from the garden, and what I had in the fridge - colorful small peppers sliced the long way and three large white mushrooms.

I'm sorry but we didn't like this very much. Way too much oil, Italian seasoning and salt for only 2 zucchinis. Might be good after revising quantities of each though.

I made a smaller batch, only using 1 zucchini, yellow onion, avacado garlic infused olive oil, diced canned tomatoes with italian seasonings,  and a pinch of stevia in place of sugar. Served over brown rice.  Very tasty!

This recipe was both very easy and good. I reduced the amount of oil and salt that I used - as written it just seemed like they would be too much for this recipe. The oil I used maybe about a 1/4C. and the salt I just sprinkled some into the pan and didn't really measure it, but I know it was a lot less than what it called for. It was a winner with my family, other than my 5 year old picking out the tomatoes. I made this as a side dish to go with hamburgers and pasta salad, and it worked great for that. Since everyone seemed to like it I'm sure I will be making again sometime. Thank you for sharing the recipe, COLEE576!

YUM! I wanted this to be as healthy as possible, so I didn't use the olive oil, just heavily sprayed my pan w/ cooking spray. I added about 3 cloves of crushed garlic in with the onions and zucchini and sauteed that, then added the tomatoes. I eliminated the sugar and just used a nice sprinkling of salt, pepper and italian seasoning. This was a wonderful side and I can't wait until I get garden fresh zucchini because this is a great way to use them up! Thanks for sharing. :)

I prepared this as a side dish. The ingredients were good, but there are so many other wonderful ways to make zucchini. I probably won't prepare this again. I added a pinch of sugar which I feel made it too sweet and added no salt. I will be searching for another recipe soon since the summer months and all the fresh produce are appearing

this was okay... but i might be a little biased since my garden is hyper-producing squash and zucchini this year so i am a little tired out :( i would recommend using fresh herbs if you have them, the dried seasoning is a little bland.

Having just graduated from college, my cooking expertise focused soley on cereal, spaghetti, and canned soup. I never, ever cook but now that i'm living back at home before I start my job, my parents suggest that I learn. This recipe was DELICIOUS and SO easy. I used a little more italian seasoning then what is called for, but then again I like food with some flavor! I recommed this recipe to anyone, especially beginners! I will definitely be making this again!
