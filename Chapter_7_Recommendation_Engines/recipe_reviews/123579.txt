In a word, delicious. The lemon juice makes all the difference in the world, cutting down on the somewhat bitter taste broccoli can sometimes have.

My neighbors gave me a similar recipe, that their "chef" son gave them, but it was a lot more complicated.  I found this recipe years ago in one of my TOH magazines & have been making it ever since.  I follow the recipe to a T, but I do press my garlic into the lemon juice & let it stand for a while, to "cook" the garlic, before combining all the ing.  A little freshly grated parmesan gives it a really nice touch!

Quick & simple to take to a dinner! Ahead of time, I slightly under-cooked the broccoli, plunged it into ice water, drained it well and dried it with paper towels. I mixed the dressing to take in a small jar.  When we arrived, I heated the broccoli in the microwave, tossed it with the dressing, and added some tiny halved grape tomatoes for color. And it was delicious and looked great and didn't inconvenience the hostess in the kitchen! The dressing also works well with green beans.

This recipe was so amazingly simple and it was ablsloutely delicious too!  I plan on preparing my broccoli this way from now on.  The only changes I made were to add just a little less lemon juice than was called for and to steam my broccoli rather than boil it.

DELICIOUS! Pressed the garlic and let it sit in the olive oil & fresh lemon juice for a few minutes before adding the rest of the ingredients. I added a handful of fresh cherry tomatoes (halved) before tossing everything together. The final result is such a pretty presentation and the flavor is so yummy! This is my new favorite way to make broccoli! Thank you so much for the fantastic and simple recipe!

I was surprised at how good this was. The lemon is so great with brocolli, I bet it would be good with other veggies.

I took the advice of other people and added the lemon a little at a time.  I ended up just squeezing a lemon over the brocolli and tasting, it was great.  Didnt need as much as the recipe calls for unless you like it lemony.

I was looking for a quick way to jazz up steamed broccoli and this worked perfectly!  I followed the recipe as is and it was gobbled up in no time.  Some other reviewers thought the amount of lemon juice to be too much, but if you want a bit of a lemon tang, I think that the amount listed in the recipe is perfect.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This is darn good.  I made it exactly as as specified and mine had a subtle flavor.  It didn't overpower the broccoli but rather made it tasty.  It didn't seem too lemony or garlicky at all.

I hate broccoli, but this recipe made it enjoyable.  I made it as is except I used garlic powder instead of a garlic clove.

This is a great recipe! My dad even said that this was the first broccoli recipe he's eaten that doesn't need butter. And if you know my dad, that's impressive! The lemon and garlic really add a lot to a vegetable that is so often frowned upon.

Loved, loved, loved this! Trying to eat more veggies and this was right up our alley.  Made as written except I put the evoo & garlic in the hot pot I cooked the broccoli in to let it warm a little and sweat the garlic.  Will use this as my go to broccoli recipe. Thank you Shirley!!

I've made this several time and this is very good as is. I didn't give it 5 stars because it's not 'amazing' but after all, it's only a broccoli side dish so don't hesitate to make this. I didn't measure the ingredients, which is my usual cooking style. I prefer to take the ingredients listed and then make it to my tastes so I didn't think it was 'too lemony' as others have noted. What I did do that was very fun was to use my immersion blender in the sauce since my minced garlic was too big. It made a super nice emulsion like an aoli that then blended beautifully into the broccoli instead of separating as olive oil mixtures usually do. Next time I'll do this again and not bother mincing the garlic.  Super easy way to give broccoli a flavor boost - Thanks!!

This is my family's favorite way to eat broccoli.... only I use A LOT more garlic... usually the whole head.  Sometimes I sprinkle grated mizithra cheese over it before it's served. I omit the lemon juice.  I buy the chopped, fresh broccoli from Costco and trim off the ends if they're dry.

Delicious and simple to make! Lightly seasoned without it being overpowering. I love the combination of lemon juice, olive oil and garlic. I soaked the garlic clove in the lemon juice, olive oil, salt and black pepper. Paired nicely with, "Orange Pork," and "Colorful Fried Rice," also from this website.

This is a very easy to make recipe... i made a few changes like most people. I first steamed the broccoli until slightly tender and sauteed with garlic and one teaspoon of olive oil and the juice of half a lemon. I used no salt or pepper... the flavor is amazing!! And oh so healthy!!!

This was good. I made it two ways. First I made it as written, except put in a little less lemon juice and added Lawry's season salt, instead of the salt -and it was nice and zesty. Next, I made some using italian dressing, instead of the olive oil, lemon juice and garlic clove mix - This was even more savory. Both are good and would make them again for dinner if I have broccoli hanging around :-).

Delicious and easy to make. Can also be used to toss with pasta or shrimp. A great base sauce. You might want to cut the lemon juice in half.

This was very good.  The kids and husband loved it and there were no left overs.  They are not huge veggie eaters.  Thanks for the great recipe.

4.5 Stars: I liked the flavor of the sauce, but overcooked my broccoli a bit.

My Family has used a similar recipe for as long as I can remember, except after tossing the broccoli with the dressing, we refrigerate for a few hours before serving allowing the flavors to develop.  Excellent cold!!

I would give this 5 stars but my kids like broccoli but didn't eat this version. I loved it! I thought it was a yummy and different twist to steamed broccoli. I wouldn't use full strength olive oil though, unless you really like the strong taste of olive oil. The first time I made it I used light olive oil and it was good, the second time I was out of the light and had to use the extra virgin and it was a little strong. The minced garlic is my favorite part, the lemon gives it just the perfect flavor. I would make it again for myself!

Nice way to dress up broccoli. I like to mix up the sauce and then warm it up for 30 seconds in the microwave. Really brings out the flavor.

Half of us liked it, and half didn't.  I used a few tbsp of butter instead of oil.  Next time (and there will be a next time)  I'm going to clarify the butter beforehand in a saucepan and add the rest of the ingredients from there, plus increase the lemon.  PERSONALLY, I LOVED IT!

I did not care for this recipe. It tasted exactly like the ingredients - lemon, raw garlic, & broccoli. The flavors did not mix well at all. Thankfully I only used half the broccoli for this recipe and put boring ol' butter on the other half.

My husband gives this dish a 4.5, since he loves garlic. I thought the flavor was good - the garlic was a little strong, but I would make it again. My kids ate it up.

Very, very good. I did make one change with the cooking process. I roasted the broccoli for about 20 minutes (I don't normally time my cooking, I just kind of guess.), after I'd tossed the broccoli with the oil/juice/spices. Brought out the flavor even more of the broccoli and spices. We all inhaled this.

This is an excellent and simple recipe.  Less is sometimes more, and this is the time.  For all of the lemon-phobes, just use less.  I go through about five lemons a day, so this dish was perfect for me.  Beautiful and easy for time-conscious people.

Well, I was a little unsure what to rate this.  It was easy to prepare.  The flavor was a little off though.  The lemon juice needs to be cut back a bit, and I think the garlic should be cooked just a little.  We love garlic...a LOT...but the taste of the raw garlic was a little much in this...especially with all that lemon!  Next time, I'll cut the lemon down by half, and maybe put a little heat to the pan after I add the oil/juice mixture just to cook the garlic a little.  Otherwise, it's a great idea and went fairly well with my grilled salmon and rice.

As a huge fan of garlic I am never able to stop at one clove.  Other than adding more garlic the only other change I made was to sprinkle a little Parmesan Reggiano on the top before serving.  The lemon was a nice addition!

This was great. I didn't have any lemon juice so I substituted the juice from one lime.  I also added a few extra cloves of garlic.  My 5 year old went crazy for this!

Excellent!! The only changes I made were to use less olive oil (probably only 1 tsp or so) and add parmesan at the end.  Unbeatable!

These were actually really good! I cooked the garlic in with the broccoli because I don't care for raw garlic. I haven't eaten broccoli in years and I actually ate the whole bowl of broccoli that I cooked.( i don't think it was a full pound)I will definatly use this recipe again. I loved it!!!

For years, I have tried to liven up steamed broccoli on my own. I never could figure out what I was doing wrong. I don't have to worry anymore because I have this awesome recipe!! My family loved it! What an amazing, fresh, zippy way to eat broccoli. I steamed mine with my microwave steamer, but other than that, didn't change a thing. Thanks!!

Wow!!  I loved this!  I wasn't expecting it to be anything special, but it is.  It adds so much flavor to broccoli, I just love it.  I steamed my broccoli, and just estimated the measurments.  I used less oil than stated.  This is so yummy- I'll be doing this again.

I used frozen broccoli. Frozen veggies just aren't as good as the fresh ones so this was a great way to season them. Everyone ate them right up without any complaints. Thank you.

I made this just as indicated and it was a tasty broccoli dish; next time I will cut back on the lemon juice and add more garlic as some other reviewers have suggested. Served it with Salmon with Brown Sugar Glaze (also from this site).

Make sure that the broccoli is completely drained and patted dry or it will be watery.

This is a super easy and tasty way to dress up broccoli! I made it as written, and it turned out very well. No one raved about it, but I found it to be pretty tasty. The garlic and lemon flavors were not real strong, but still gave the broccoli a pleasant taste. Thanks for sharing the recipe!

We didn't care for the lemon juice - I'd leave it out next time.  We topped it with fresh-grated parmesan, which was yummy.

This was delicious and SO easy.  I used a bag of frozen broccoli, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  They didn't really taste garlicky to me...but very tasty nonetheless.

It was pretty good. . you really need to be careful that you don't over cook the broccoli because it will be all dried out. . make sure you use enough olive oil to coat. . and keep an eye on it while cooking. I'd make this again. . (I baked this in the oven instead of boiling it. . baked on 350 for about 20 min).

Excellent recipe, quick to make and delicious to eat!   Remember to whisk the dressing ingredients briskly in order to pull out the full flavor of the minced garlic.  I'd suggest using olive oil rather than vegetable oil.  Don't let the broccoli get soggy!!

I thought they were delicious.  I followed another reviewers advise for taking it to a party and it turned out great.  I took the broccoli and dressing separate.  Heated the broccoli up a few minutes in the microwave and them tossed with the dressing.  Great way to make broccoli!

This is a simple and delicious recipe!!  It was super quick and it tasted just like the borcolli my italian mother used to make.  I think I'll even try this dressing on other vegtables too!!  I though the taste would be strong, but the flavors were perfect together!

Simple and delicious, need I say more?!!  Made this recipe as is, only difference is that I steamed my broccoli per my norm and probably used a tad less oil.  Otherwise, great dish and went very well alongside Chicken Breasts Stuffed with Perfection (from this site)!

I dont know if it's just me but...the oil made it taste weird. I'd attempt it again only with changes.

This lemon-garlic sauce was excellent. I also tried drizzling it on asparagus before cooking in the over and I thought it had a wonderful taste as well. I also added a pinch of brown sugar to the mix just to sweeten it a bit.

Excellent recipe!  Such an easy way to add a lot of flavor to ordinary broccoli!  My family loved this, and this will definitely become our standard preparation method.  The only thing I did differently was to use steamed broccoli florets instead of the larger spears.  The dressing is wonderful!

Next time I'm going to cut back on the lemon and increase the pepper.  Pretty good, but will need adjustments.

This was a nice change from regular broccoli. It was a bit peppery, but I enjoyed it. It tasted good with older broccoli. I'll try it again. Thanks!

I thought this was rather bland, but still a nice change once in awhile from plain steamed broccoli.

Best broccoli in awhile. I just made this and it is easy and tasty (I am a bachelor and generally poor cook).  I used about half a pound of broccoli, 1/4 lemon, 1 tbs EVOO, and 2 cloves of garlic.  I was confused as to whether or not the garlic was cooked with the broccoli.  I added the garlic at the end, and this seems to be the correct way.

This was amazing!  I typically add lemon juice to my broccoli, and I wasn't sure how this could be much different, but it is so good!  I used a little more lemon than was called for, and a little less oil.  I think this will be the new "usual" broccoli around here- and we eat a lot of broccoli!

Great recipe.  I didn't follow the measurements, I just estimated it.  It was a great way to add flavor to broccoli.  My husband ate every bite.

This was simple and delicious! I used frozen broccoli florettes instead of fresh spears, and it was excellent. I added a little more lemon juice and a bit more garlic than the recipe calls for, just because I wanted a more intense flavor, and it didn't disappoint. I'll keep this one on standby as a quick and easy side dish. I've always got all of the ingredients on hand.

Excellent!  Prepared exactly as written and it was fantastic!  The next time I made it I increased garlic to 2 cloves and it was amazing!  We love garlic!  PS:  made it again with EVOO and we prefer it with canola or veggie oil.

I first of all I have to say that I am not a huge fan of broccoli but I actually really enjoyed this.  Made almost exactly as written...only change was to steam the broccoli instead of boiling. My 2 1/2 year old ate this and my 14 year old finished the bowl.  A hit!  Will make again!

I steam the broccoli in a steamer.  Don't over cook the broccoli unless you like mushy broccoli.  This is tart and garlicky and yummy.

I thought this was okay. I found the cooking time to microwave the broccoli to be double what I normally do. I am guessing, because the recipe calls for 1 lb of broccoli. It just didn't have lots of flavor compared to roasted or broccoli recipes that are also sauteed. It worked fine, though, tonight as a steamed vegetable side dish.

This was pretty good.  Serving broccoli spears is really more elegant then just the tops.  The flavor was very mild, but good.

How can something so simple, add so much flavor? ;o) I overcooked the broccoli a bit & they were still great. Am eager to try this on  asparagus too. Thanks for a staple recipe that will be used for years, Shirley Glaab!

This is DELICIOUS!  I was bad and used butter rather than EVOO.  This will be a regular veg for us.  THANK you, Shirley!
