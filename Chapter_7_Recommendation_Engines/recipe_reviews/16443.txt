I tried this recipe but the pot we have would not hold all eight cups of water 
and the rest of the ingredients.  As I followed the instructions in the recipe 
and I got to the part where one adds the water, I realized I would only get 
about four cups of water into the pot.  (I also added a half teaspoon of Basil, 
Marjoram, Pepper, Oregano and Salt.  It seemed way too bland otherwise.) 

As my wife and sat down to eat, she commented that if I had managed to add 
all eight cups of water, it would have tasted as if the water had a very brief 
passing encounter with a tomato.

A few nights later, I warmed up the leftovers.  Most of the water that had been 
in the bowl must have been absorbed by the spaghetti so I added an eight 
ounce can of tomato sauce.  I filled the can with water and added that.  Then I 
added about a tablespoon of Basil, Marjoram, Oregano and Thyme. 

When I served it up this time, my wife said, "now this tastes like something!"

I'm going to assume that the eight cups mentioned in the original recipe was a 
typo.  Some of the ingredients must have been missing.  If the recipe was 
made as stated, it would have been more than bland.

In fact, I think maybe only three cups of water would be sufficient in the 
original version.  I guess with all of these alterations I can name the resulting 
recipe after myself and call it B.J.'s spaghetti soup, but I've got a few more 
alterations in mind to make it better.  ;-)

This recipe, as written, was a good bae recipe, but very bland.  I added 1/2 tsp each of thyme, tarragon, oregano, salt and pepper and it made it into a wonderful soup.  My wife and daughter say that the spaghetti should be broken intoi 1" or 2" pieces.

This is very close to our old standby "Quick Hamburger Soup" recipe. I increase the meat to 1 1/2 pounds, decrease the water to 6 cups, use a 28 ounce can of organic crushed tomatoes, and add 2 T beef base and 1/2 tsp freshly cracked black pepper. Instead of the spaghetti we use half a cup of acini di pepe which I stir in after the soup has simmered 25 minutes. Add some crusty bread and a salad and you have a hearty warming meal.

Instead of corn, used mixed vegetable and 1 lb of Angel Hair Pasta broken in 1/3rds.  Doubled other ingredients.  Was a bit bland on first taste, but added seasonings to spice it up.  My son loves any kind of pasta EXCEPT spaghetti, the angel hair was a big hit with him.  Fast, easy and I thought a 'fun' recipe to play with.

Try using chicken broth in place of at LEAST half of the water. I think he probably adds chicken cubes and they were somehow left out of the  original recipe. Just be careful then about adding salt.

definetly SEASON!  I put some garlic powder and italian seasoning when browning the meat.  I added 3 "Cans" of water, and cooked rice instead of pasta (what was on hand).  I added about a TBL. of fresh herbs at the end, and this really tasted wonderful.  I added shredded moz. cheese, but it just got stringing.

I made this recipe when I was in a hurry to fix dinner.  My children really enjoyed it.  It was tasty, however, it really needs salt and pepper.  Without them, I thought it was bland.

My husband and I enjoyed this soup. The taste is similar to the goulash I make occasionally. I added salt to the recipe to give it more flavor.

I did not care for this recipe. I was able to save it after A LOT of tweaking but that really wasn't fun for me. Nice idea, though.

We added kidney beans and I used mild canned spaghetti sauce. It's what we had on hand. Add a few extra spices, oregano, and basil.  Huge hit. Quick and easy!

As written, this would have been very bland. I added herbs as some other reviews suggested and a TON of salt. I'll make it again, but next time I'll use broth instead of water.
