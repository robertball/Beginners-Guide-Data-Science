Fantastic flavor!  Took all day to make, but worth every minute.  I used a double pie crust instead.

I used the filling and cooked it to its full length. Don't cut down on the time simmered and baked, because as the water evaporates the flavor only becomes more robust. 
Modifications I made: 
- Mash Potatoes in place of crust. More like a Shepherd's Pie. It's also cheaper. About 3lbs of yellow potatoes, boiled then mashed. 4 Tbshp of unsalted butter, 1/2 cup of heavy whipping cream. Salt and Pepper to taste. (I don't use a blender for potatoes because it changes the dynamic of the mash) Chunks are good. 
-Doubled the recipe because I had a feeling this would be a hit and for all the time you put in it, you might as well have plenty of leftovers. 
- 2lbs of chuckeye with all the fat removed which probably made it about 1 1/2lbs of meat. 
- Used one white onion, then 2 shallots.
- added about a 1lb of fresh cut up green beans. 
- Baby Portabella Mushrooms in place of crimini     and I added a little more than what it called for.
- Didn't add the sugar 
- subbed bay leaf for sage. 
- I also think you could add caraway seed or fennel seed, but didn't want to mess more than I did.

Since I didn't feel like making pie crust, I made this as a stew instead (added potatoes).  Wonderful! It was gobbled up by my guests before I could get another bowl.

Important Note: The recipe should state "dried thyme", NOT ground thyme (a completely different ingredient), which is why i think some people have found the thyme flavour overpowering- i think Allrecipes got confused, perhaps our British and American wires got crossed! As other people have mentioned, as well as making this as a pie i often just eat it as a stew or casserole- it works brilliantly both ways! It does take a while to cook i guess, but the rich flavour you get at the end of it is so worth it!

Very good and flavourful, however, I don't think you need the last half hour of cooking. The vegetables (I added peas) in my filling turned mushy.  Also I used half the puff pastry as a base crust, and that shrank when I baked it on its own. BUT I will definitely try it again, the ale gave it a fantastic flavour and normally I hate beer. Thanks!

I loved the taste of this dish.  I skipped the long stove-top cooking and instead put the mixture in the crock pot after thickening the first time.
I cooked it on high for about an hour then turned it to low for another hour and a half.  I then put the mixture in the fridge util I wanted to make the pie.

delicious, but the guinness flavor really develops as it sits - so the flavor is a lot stronger if you eat it as leftovers the next day. i made it with ruth's grandma's pie crust from this site.

I made this for St. Patty's Day.  My husband and I thought it was excellent.  It certainly takes awhile to cook, but the filling is delicious.  I used Guinness Extra Stout and was afraid it might make it a bit bitter, but the result was fantastic.  Extras are already packed up for lunch tomorrow!

This recipe was a winner, made it exactly as written, and it was a hit! The bacon and the beer make it so good. I was so glad when the hours of work payed off, my husband loved it.

This recipe is just fantastic, the perfect traditional Steak and Ale Pie.  I pretty much followed the recipe as written.  I did triple all ingredients to make 2 x 9.5" Deep Pies.  I also added 1/2 cup of frozen pies to the vegetables.  I cooked for the amount of time stated which produced a nice thick stew.  I always brushed the top of the pastry with milk rather than the egg the recipe called for.  This recipe really is a keeper for me.

I made the recipe without changes.  I thought the stout was too bitter in the pie.  In the future, I would use maybe 1/2 cup vs. 1 cup.  Also, I think this would be better as a stew without the puff pastry on top.  Overall, a good recipe.

Yum! I made the recipe almost as is, with the exception of using a bottom crust (which I wouldn't do again since the crust come out a bit mushy) and I baked it at 425 degrees which crisped up the puff pastry really well. I will definitely make this again using the same baking temperature. Very good.

Over the weekend I happened to come across a dish like this in an Irish pub and come Monday I was bound and determined to find the recipe. Well, if this isn't it it's pretty close! I made the recipe exactly as is only making the pie in individual ramekins. Despite having to eat dinner at nearly ten thirty at night, I absolutely loved this, and after travelling to four different liquor stores looking for individually sold Guinness, I am sure glad I ended up having to buy a four pack because I cannot wait to make this again!

Very good!  Had concerns making this after reading the review from the person who did not like it due to the flavour of Guinness.  Was not able to taste the Guinness at all and the gravy was very flavourful

Absolutely delicious! Everyone loved this dish. I used fresh thyme instead--a little more than the dried thyme called for since it's not as strong. Oddly enough I only had frozen phyllo dough on hand instead of puff pastry,  but it made for a nice, light, flaky topping. This recipe does take all of the three hour cooking time listed, but most of it is simmering and baking which don't keep you chained to the stove/oven.

I used this recipe for a "steak pie" with puff pastry but for anyone who doesn't like the stoutnes/bitter flavor of beer or especially Guinness beer which most beer drinkers LOVE ( I didn't use it because I dont like beer..too bitter) but I DID  use the exact same with Red wine instead! I only changed beer to wine and didnt have mushrooms but added some baby potatoes cut small. GREAT RESULTS! needed extra s&p for us but only adjusted to taste and IT TURNED OUT GREAT! You can actually use filling w/small amount of gravy into iindividual puff pastry enclosed pies! Like "jamacian paties" it is GREAT to do several things with this filling! Thank you for the post!

Delish.  I doubled the filling for a deep dish pie plate.  Also used a store bought double pie crust, baking bottom crust before filling.

Wow this was outstanding! I made a few changes to the recipe... I left out the mushrooms and added celery and also used Shiner Bock beer instead of the Guinness since that is what I had on hand!! I also doubled the puff pastry making an extra layer ... Even thought this takes a while to make it was definely worth it!! This will become a staple meal in my house!!! Everyone went back for seconds!!!

This is a great dish. It takes some time to make and disappears really fast. I have made it twice in two days and my only gripe is my crust not looking as good as the picture. Definitely a keeper.

I made this last evening and my husband and I thought it was delicious.  I actually used red wine instead of Guiness because I did not have any in the house.  It made a good substitute.  Other than that I followed the recipe to the letter.  I made my own puff pastry which was more labor intensive, but well worth the effort.

OMG!  Loved this recipe!!! My grandparents are English and my grandmother made meat pie just like this! When she passed away 15 years ago she left no recipe for it. This recipe took me back I had been craving her meat pie for ages and now I can make it!!!

I made this for my boyfriend and his friends to have between football games. Our house has been voted in for all future Super Bowls. The gravy got thick and rich and the meat tender. Portions seemed generous to me and I wasn't able to finish but none of the guys had this problem.

This was a very yummy dish.  Especially since I am not fond of Guiness.  Made it for a St. Patrick's day lunch at work and everyone raved about it.   Will definitely make this again!

I made this for St. Patrick's Day. It was delicious! I used ground beef instead of the cubed stew meat to reduce the cooking time. Other than that, I followed the recipe as written. Very very good! Thank you.

Wonderful!  So hearty, and the mushroom flavor really comes through with the long cooking time.  And I loved the puff pastry on top - much lighter and more elegant than regular pie crust.  This is a new favorite - well worth the time and effort!

Delicious! The Guinness gives it a uniquely rich and satisfying flavor. If you enjoy Guinness beer you will be delighted with this recipe. I used ground beef instead of stew meat out of necessity and it still came out tasting great. I also used more corn starch than the recipe calls for in order to thicken the stew. Will definitely make this again.

Amazing Pie and Amazing Flavour.  My wife and I devoured this pie.  It is all about the low and slow cooking method.  The Guinness made an amazingly rich and thick sauce that worked perfectly.  I added more mushrooms though and also added a few closer to the end to retain their shape and texture.  I will be making this again and again!!!!

This is excellent!  The only change I made in the recipe is to add in another carrot and next time I'll add a third.  Even though this takes "time" it doesn't need constant attention.  Once it's in the pot on the stove, you really can walk away and let it cook with a stir in the middle.  From there, into the pie plate, top with the puff pastry and into the oven.  We had our salad course while this was on its last ten minutes in the oven.  We let it rest about 5-10 minutes before cutting into it.  It was still piping hot. The flavors in this are wonderful and complex, far more interesting and satisfying than a traditional 'beef stew' recipe provides.  My guests were able to pick out the bacon flavor and also identified the Guiness accurately.  I served this with a simple salad course, savory scones, and steamed white asparagus along side.  Definitely worth your time and good enough for company.

Excellent recipe! I used homemade pate brise for a crust, worked great. I also experimented with Gruyere and Havarti cheeses. I put a layer (about 1/4in thick slices) of cheese in the bottom of each pie shell before I put the filling in and baked.(Havarti in one pie and Gruyere in the other) A-Mazing. my guests couldn't get enough!

This is one of my favorite go-to recipes. Sometimes I make it ahead to bake just before serving it, sometimes I make one and freeze portions for lunches. ALWAYS it is a big hit with people. I like to use fresh thyme, but other than that, I change nothing. ????

You do have to make sure that you do use a dark beer as it is described or it's not going to come out as well as you would want it to. As far as using a coke that is for the next time to try.

This was a good dish, although I'm not sure the amount of time required is worth it. Cooking the filling in a crock pot makes some sense, so I might try that next time. Still, I'll probably save this for special occasions (like St. Patrick's Day). If you have the time, go for it.

I pretty much followed the recipe. My pastry was probably “Aged” in the freezer, so not the best result. The filling was tasty. 
I recycled the filling on day 2 and made a great beef barley soup.

OMG  This was sooo amazing.  I had 5 teenage boys to feed.  I made enough for 2 pans, and used puff pastry over one and Mashed Potatoes with Boursin over the other.  I used Bisto gravy thickener instead of Corn Starch becuase that's what I had.  Also I couldn't find cremini at the store, so used bella mushrooms, maybe they are the same?  Not sure.  And whenever a recipe calls for a certain number of slices of bacon - I read that as one pound - and trim the fattiest bits away.  The house smelled wonderful and the boys were all looking for leftovers later.  I would make this every weekend if I could.  I may have added Worcestershire sauce too because it seemed like the right thing to do.

This pie made my entire family jump for joy. It was the perfect warm end to a relaxing day. If o were to make a suggestion, I would add salt and pepper to the beef as it's browning for more tenderness and to b4ing out the flavors of the other ingredients. But other than that it is the perfect recipe!

Omg!! This turned out so delicious!! My family LOVED it!! I had a bunch of mushrooms, and leftover prime rib, so I used more mushrooms and then the prime rib. Didn’t need to cook it as long on the stove top. I’m going to make this every time we have leftover prime rib!!

This was a little time consuming, but so , so worth it. The flavors were wonderful. I added a little more vegetables and used a regular pie crust for the top. I also added shredded Irish cheese on the crust. Will most definitely make again!

I made this recipe, and when I did I changed it in the following ways
I used three cups of Guinness which I reduced down to one cup for a more powerful Guinness flavor.
To offset the extra bitterness of the Guinness reduction and to add a more velvety texture to the Stew, I melted in 4 tablespoons of butter directly before filling the puff pastry.
I really enjoyed this recipe!

Since I had everything on hand but the puff pastry, I made this into a stew. Other than that the only changes I made was to use elk instead of beef and I added potatoes in the last half hour. Very good and a perfect dinner for a cold dreary day.

I use fresh thyme and added more carrots than the recipe called for This freezes very well. I tripled the recipe.

What a fantastic pie. The only thing I did differently (because I had the girls coming round for dinner on a weeknight and wouldn't have been able to get home from work in time to cook it all) was I popped all the filling stuff in the slow cooker this morning. So when I got home all I had to do was thicken it, fill the pie crust and bake. Delicious! And definitely hitting repeat on this one.

We made this for St. Paddy's Day--my little ones don't like cabbage or the saltiness of corned beef, so we were looking for something new. This was AWESOME. I was a little worried that the Guinness flavor would be too bitter for a three-year-old and a five-year-old, but they scarfed up every bite. Like other reviewers, I used a double pie crust. Next time I may try doing the filling in a slow cooker before thickening it with corn starch and baking it in the crust; the only problem with this recipe is that it takes forever. We're making this every St. Patrick's Day from now on!

So good, my husband and I loved every bite! Only change I made was to add one  parsnip cut like matchsticks. Definitely will make again.

O-M-G!!! This was soooo good!!! I followed the recipe exactly except added one more piece of bacon. My boyfriend couldn't stop raving about it and leaned over the table to give me a hug after he finished his plate!

This is delicious and it looks wonderful too. Except for using thyme leaves instead of ground thyme, I followed the recipe. I made two pies for my husband's birthday luncheon. He  declared it "so, so good" and people asked for the recipe. This is like the beef and onion pie served at the historic Olde Angel Inn in Niagara-on-the-Lake.

This takes a while to prepare but it's worth every second. I used a chuck roast that I cubed instead of stew beef, and it's so much better than the stew beef you get at the grocery store.

Turned out exactly like the beef pie I had this past summer in England. Loved it there & just knew I had to make the identical at home. My husband is not a fan of dark beers such as Guinness & he loved it!

Rejected by both my husband and daughter, both strongly disliked the thyme seasoning, and that was after I used less than half of what the recipe called for. 

I think it would be quite excellent if I left out the thyme.

Great recipe!  Cook time is a little off so use best judgement.  Read all the comments and modify based on your preferences.  I used a dried mushroom medley that turned out well.  Might be cook with pie crust top too.

Perfect in every way. I would not change a thing.
