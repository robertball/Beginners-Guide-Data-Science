After reading the reviews about the grill catching fire, I decided to put the fish on non stick Reynolds wrap. I folded up all the corners and got an excellent crisp with all the flavor grilled in. My husband and I agree it was the best prepared halibut we've had! I too put the grill to high for 5 min then cooked one side on medium and then down to low.

I used an air cooker instead of grilling --- always too afraid they will fall apart. In lieu of the individual spices, I used Costco's salt free blend of spices.

We tried this recipe and thought it was great, the seasonings were enough to taste but not overwhelm the mild fish.  I did as one person suggested and made a container out of foil, sprayed lightly with pam.  Leaving the foil open at the top you still get the outdoor flavor without having the fish fall apart.  Sweed

Awesome flavored. I've made this a number of times and the only change was to reduce the butter by half and pan fry. Perfect!

I found this very hard to BBQ on the grill. The butter would cause flames when I tried to flip the fish over and could only cook on one side. But the flavour was pretty good.

Made this with Alaskan frozen cod fillets tonight in the oven at 450 for about 20 minutes. They were thinner fillets; maybe an inch tapering down to a quarter of an inch. I doubled it for 6, but it would have been fine without the doubling. Fantastic recipe! All seven of us liked it, from ages 2 to 39, and the oldest one is the pickiest with fish recipes. He said it was pretty good. I will make this again for sure.

Ok. The seasoning is spot on. Using butter on a mid-high grill is tricky. Recommend lower the grill to low to cook off some of the butter and then raising the the temp to high. 
Delicious!

Absolutely fab!!! We fish halibut and salmon every year and always looking for new recipes and modes of prep. For this recipe I used grilling sheets so there was no flare up, no mess, easy to clean. Fish was absolutely perfect!

Used this recipe in the past. Prepared by grilling fish, give it a quick sear and place on soaked wooden board like Alder. Excellent combination.

The butter mix kind of just fell off on the grill. Was pretty disappointingly bland.  Would probably try this on a pan/seared, but for grilling, I don't recommend it.

It caused a fire on my grill so won't be doing that again. The butter mixture smelled amazing so in going to try it in the Oven next time.

This turned out amazing on the charcoal BBQ; followed the recipe exactly. Did 6mins per side indirect, then a flash over direct to get the beautiful grill lines. Definitely adding this to the 'keeper list'!

I made just a couple of changes that I don't think affect the final outcome much: 1) I used fresh chopped dill from our garden and 2) I grilled the halibut first with just olive oil and then drizzled the sauce on when I served it. It was delicious.

Delicious.  We did this on the gas grill but on a piece of foil with a little butter rather than placing it,on the grill itself.  Moist and delicious.  Will make it,again!

This was very delicious, and so easy! We used one of those copper grilling mats and the fish was perfect. There’s no flare up, or worry of losing pieces of fish between the grates if you use  a mat.

This is a great way to cook almost all fish!  We all love it! I have made it several times.  I always use an foil pan to contain all the butter and no flare ups.  Making it again tonight with grilled asparagus and grilled peaches.  Yum!

Excellent!  Mild meaty flavor.  Grilled on non stick foil which I poked a holes in.  The fish is meaty enough to cook on the grate for a bit,adds great flavor.  Definitely will make for company in the future.

There was so much butter that I decided to put the halibut on foil on the BBQ grill.  We did like the flavors of the butter spread, even though I wish I hadn't run out of dill because I think that would have been perfect.  This was good, but I wonder if it wouldn't have been better baked in the oven.  Thanks for the recipe because we did like the flavors, just not the cooking method.

I followed other reviewer’s recommendations and wrapped the fish in foil envelopes prior to putting the fish on the grill. My husband, two year old sons and I enjoyed the taste, but I also thought it was missing a little something - maybe more salt?

Didn’t enjoy it. Was disappointing.  The butter constantly flared the grill and dried out the fish.  Would not make again.

I used lemon pepper instead of lemon juice & pepper. Pre-Heated the grill on high then grilled on low. Halibut turned out fantastic!

I tried it with aluminum foil and was very good. I garnished with a few bacon crumbles.  Grilled on low for 6 minutes and then finished it on medium.  The butter can still run out and ignite the flame. Watch closely. Very moist. Will make agin.

I used fresh lemon juice instead of lime. I also added these fresh herbs from my herb garden: 1 tablespoon of oregano and 1 tablespoon of rosemary, finely chopped.
Add these herbs to the Butter sauce and pour over fish!

My son said that this recipe was a little bland, but I substituted a combination of olive oil and extra virgin olive oil for the butter, which probably takes away some of the richness, but is healthier, of course. I thought the halibut had a good flavor. I used Halibut filets from Costco. Although frozen, the fish quality was decent. I also like a heavier spice mix than that provided in this recipe. If you are one that appreciates subtle flavor, this recipe is just fine. It can certainly be healthy if prepared with olive oil and I will definitely have it again.

Made this tonight for dinner.  I never had halibut before.  What a delicious fish & I'm not much of a fish person.  It picked up the grill taste very nicely and the flavor was nice.  I used half butter and half coconut oil, I thought there was too much butter.  It was very good.  The only thing i would do different is save some of the butter mixture and brush while it was cooking.  Would make again.  :)

I made this halibut recipe for dinner this evening, and everyone loved it. I will make it again and again. I was concerned it would not be great, at $20. a lb. but it was a big success. I did change a couple of things. The first thing I did differently was broil the fish, I also minced and sautéed a small onion instead of using onion powder. The seasonings used were just enough as to not take away from the mild taste of the fish.

Due to my husband's dietary requirements, I used EVOO in stead of butter. Also, the halibut steaks were about 1 1/2"-2" thick and I only had 2 of them. So, I cut the recipe in half. I chose not to use the sugar. My grill flamed up a little when I first put the fish on. But, I had used canola oil on the grill grates right before putting the fish on them and again when I turned the fish. I also had the grill set at about half-way between medium and low. The fish was cooked perfectly at about 3 1/2 minutes on each side. I used the remaining mixture to brush on the side that was up and then the other side when I turned the steaks over. 
My husband, who is quite finicky (whether he admits it or not) really liked the fish (I don't like seafood at all). Plus, it was the first time I've ever cooked halibut. 
So, thank you very much for this recipe.

This was a great recipe! I used the gril, and the fish was fatty enough with the butter (I basted both sides) that it didn't stick at all! This was excellent & will definitely be in our regular fish rotation.
