Really, really good.  Made these along with Lamb Kabobs.  Great chilled on a Summer day, but don't hesitate to eat them warm!

I just wasn't too crazy about this flavor. I think the flavor of the prepared dressing was too strong; perhaps it would have been better if the dressing itself had been better.

This was delicious, it had an interesting almost bubble gum flavor at first bite.

It wasn't anything special.  But, I did the recipe in reverse which may account for it.  We were using the shrimp for fondue night, and I marinated them first and then cooked them in a Coq Au Vin style fondue.  They still tasted good, but I've had better.

Delightful! I added a bit of fresh basil and served this over pasta salad made with the Italian salad dressing from the recipe. I served the shrimp a little warm with garlic butter on the side -which no one used! Excellent and I certainly will make this  again!
