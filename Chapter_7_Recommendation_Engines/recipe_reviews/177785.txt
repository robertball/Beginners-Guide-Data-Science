Don't let the short list of ingredients fool you: this soup is so satisfyingly delicious!  I used fresh tomatoes and roasting those veggies prior to adding to the soup adds a whole other dimension of flavor.  I used organic veggie broth rather than chicken.  A change to the recipe indications: I did not add the roasted veggies until right before serving, as I didn't want them to lose that baked flavor & texture while sitting in the soup.  Also, if you use quick barley, this soup only needs to simmer for 10 minutes before it's ready.

This was one of the best soups we've had recently. Proof that sometimes the simplest of ingredients are all that's needed for a great tasting recipe. I followed just as written, although I deglazed the roasting pan first with some of the broth before adding all to the pot.

Made this for lunch today.  I used 1 14oz can "no salt" diced tomatoes and 1 can RoTel tomatoes with green chilies.  Made the "homemade chicken broth" from this site.  This is very healthy and very tasty.  I can't wait to take in my lunch.

This was a hearty, healthy, easy to make soup. I added more garlic and 2 carrots diced small. I would also recommend drainind the tomatoes as well as you can before roasting. The less liquid, the better the "roasted" taste. I will make this again.

Such a simple and tasty soup! I added a can of mild Rotel because we like a hint of spice. Hubby LOVED it and wants it again!!

This soup is fantastic!!! Just make sure to not over due the barley. I have zero broth because I dumped to much in! Reguardless it is amazing! I added green peppers and Italian seasoning for personal taste.

This soup was so easy to make and tasted great!! I added a pinch of salt and pepper and a shake of hot pepper flakes to the original recipe. Loved it!  Then I had leftovers which were on the thick side so I added a small can of diced tomatoes, about a 1/2 cup of leftover pizza sauce and some salsa and it was even better!! Both days I put shredded Reggiano Parmesan cheese on top and it made it even better!  I am the type who can't stick to an original recipe!  I have to create!!

Excellent soup.  I added carrot, about 1 tsp salt and some pepper.  Also a few bay leaves.  I didn't roast my vegetables, rather I just did about a 5 minute saute of the carrot, celery and onion, and then the garlic for the last minute or so.  Then you add in the tomatoes, broth and barley.  I don't really recommend quick cook barley, it's more expensive per oz. than pearled...  but if you do use it I would simmer the soup a good 40-45 minutes anyway, to let it all come together and become dense and flavorful.  Then add the quick cook barley.  I used Imagine brand broth.  Great recipe, just what I was looking for.

I roasted the garlic with sliced onions, and used canned fire roasted tomatoes.  Simple and delicious.

I made this with chicken boullion cubes and used diced carrot and a cooked diced sweet potato to cut the acidity. I omitted the celery because we don't care for it. I thought the idea of roasting the vegetables to deepen the flavor was terrific.

Wonderful!!  Put a little more barley than it called for a about two cups of water added as I went.  It took way longer than 25 minutes for the veggies and barley to become tender, so it needed the water.  Otherwise great, we loved it!

This soup is intensely flavorful. I used real tomatoes instead of canned and less onion than called for. It would make for a nice appetizer or side dip, not so great as a soup.

It was ok.   I added a couple of minced carrots, and used a concentrated chicken broth.  I also increased the garlic.   A good quick meal.

My kids ate this up and loved it, but my husband I found it to be "just okay".  Just not as much flavor as I would have liked.  I did feel that perhaps my tomatoes didn't get roasted enough, so that probably was part of it; I followed the directions and ingredients as written aside from omitting the parsley as we do not care for it.
