Too bad I didn't have this eggnog ice cream FOR Christmas rather than after Christmas! It would have been just perfect for a quick dessert with a couple of Christmas cookies! This was wonderful.  I'm fairly experienced with making ice cream so in looking over the recipe I knew it would need to be tinkered with a little.  First, for my liking anyway,  there's  too high a ratio of milk and eggnog to cream which I knew could make this a little icy or grainy - in any event not as smooth and silky as I prefer - so I used a ratio of half eggnog and half heavy cream.  I also like a rich, custard-style ice cream so I added a couple of eggs. Finally, no extra sugar was used other than what was in the eggnog, nor was there any vanilla.  I knew it would turn out kind of flat, so I added some of each.  So...scaling this down to 6 servings to fit my ice cream maker, I used 1-1/2 cups eggnog, 1-1/2 cups heavy cream and 1 tsp. vanilla, which I whisked into 2 eggs beaten with 1/3 cup sugar for 1-2 minutes. As written this really is only a 3-star recipe for the reasons I outlined but I don't want to discourage anyone from trying it because with just a little tweaking this was a delightful, rich, frozen eggnog custard!

I hate it when I read a review and they say I love the recipe but made all these changes...... but that is exactly what I'm doing. I followed the advice of the previous reviewer and made the following changes 1-1/2 cups eggnog 1-1/2 cups heavy cream 1 tsp. vanilla 1 tsp. fresh grated nutmeg the previous reviewer said that this way it would not have the ice crystal consistency and they were right! making it this way it was VERY smooth and absolutely delicious!

This was a little bland. I used fat free half and half and used a light eggnog. Could be why it was bland and definetly not as rich. I liked it much better after I added 1/4 teaspoon of rum extract and more nutmeg.

This recipe is NOT good. Its way too bland, because there's not enough sugar. My whole family could only eat one bitet. So I started over and made allrecipes' "No-Cook Eggnog Ice Cream" instead and it was perfect.

This stuff was amazing! Wish I had used an instant custard mix instead of the instant pudding mix though (for the flavor). The ice cream turned out creamy, flavorful and delicious!

This was ok. I followed the recipe to a T and added chocolate chips at the end of freezing. It was ok, but it was pretty bland. I wish I had read the first review listed and added some vanilla, eggs, and sugar to give this more pizazz. It wasn't bad and we'll eat the whole serving for sure, but it could've been better. This was my first time making ice cream in my new ice cream maker so I'm still learning and experimenting.

The flavor of the icecream depends on the quality of the egg nog.  I used some that was made at the dairy creamery  that also makes ice cream. It was left over because I forgot we had it. I did not add anything to it...and it is awesome.  I added some bananas to another quart and that also turned out very well. Smooth creamy...and very flavorful. I suspect I could add almost anything and the result would be fine---as in real ice cream.

Way too bland and got crystallized since there's no alcohol in the recipe.  It needs at least the alcohol in a teaspoon of vanilla extract!  I made a second batch with a tablespoon of bourbon and a swirl of crushed graham crackers, and it was much improved.  Certainly an easy ice cream recipe, but pretty disappointing as written.

This is a very easy recipe to follow. Great taste and rich.In the future though I will use whole milk. For added flavor add some Rum or Rum extract and Nutmeg. If you would like to make this later in the year, Purchase a couple extra quarts during the holiday season and freeze it.Thaw it completely in the refrigerator before using it for Ice Cream.

I did not care for this recipe. We followed the recipe to the letter and found it very bland and without any distinct egg nog flavor.

This is the best holiday ice cream! I didn’t change a thing but I doubled the recipe (I wanted extra for the freezer) and I used a super high quality eggnog, Broguiere’s. It’s only available this time of year and I’ve always wanted to try it as ice cream. It does not disappoint, truly a show stopper!

I just made this ice cream. I rated it 4 stars because the base recipe is good. I added a half cup of sugar, a teaspoon cinnamon and a dash of rum......great taste.

I made it following the recipe and, while its a good base for the ice cream, the diluted flavor is disappointing. What I really want is the rich flavor of eggnog. When I make it again for the holidays I will include sugar, real vanilla, cinnamon, and nutmeg.

Don't forget to add some Hennessy or booze of choice and the extra cream, fresh nutmeg and vanilla make it delicious.

love this recipe; very easy and simple to follow.  I don't like overly sweet desserts so this ice cream was perfect.
