This recipe was fantastic! The dressing had key Asian ingredients that really brought the noodles to life! I didn't have all the vegetables, so I added a few of my own and it turned out great! Didn't take too long either ate it with chopsticks! Yum!

I thought this was good... the next day.  I tried it right away and then again 4 hours later. .. I didn't like it much.  The wine flavor was very pronounced.. too much for my liking.  The next day it mellowed enough for me and then I enjoyed this
