I made these for Valentines day with my British friend (in picture).  She says they taste just like her Mom's!

I must say- I found these to be very disappointing. I made the recipe exactly as stated and found these to be too dense, chewy and not as light as I would have liked. They need the jam for flavor- the dough itself is pretty bland.

My husband said this was one of the tastiest recipes I've made. Rather than jam, i put in dried craisins--I dont know how much as I eyeballed it. I also had to add a tiny splash extra of buttermilk since my dough was a litttle to dry to stay together (bcs i live at altitude?). They turned out perfect. any dried fruit you like would be good. i put them in the dry mix before the buttermilk went in. 5 stars from him, 4 stars from me. Great balance of slighty sweet and salty, fluffy and dense.

Excellent scones.  Not tough, just the right mixture of soft and flaky inside, crisp outside.

These were some really good scones, I can't compare them to any other scones since I generally don't have scones, but these were delicous! I really enjoyed cooking them to, it was really fun. Overall, a great recipe to try, go for it!

A nice and light tasting scone!  I was looking for a recipe to use up some extra buttermilk and this was a good one.  I cut mine into wedges since I didn't have a heart shaped cookie cutter and then I spread boysenberry jam in the middle.

Love this recipe!  Omit the sugar for delicious biscuits; add whole wheat flour in place of half of the white flour for a healthier alternative and they still taste wonderful!  Thanks!
