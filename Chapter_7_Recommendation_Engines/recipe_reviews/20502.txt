With the changes I made to the original recipes I give this 5 stars - otherwise if I'd followed the recipe - probably a 2-3 star.  I did cook up the macaroni as advised by others - otherwise I think it wouldn't have cooked properly with the amount of liquid asked for! I didn't add the canned veggies - but cut up my own and cooked them up in abit of olive oil and added them to the mixing bowl.  I didn't have a can of cream of chicken - so added mushroom instead - which was fine. Also, for the milk mixture - I glitzed mine up by substituting a 1/4 cup of the milk with marsala wine - made for a very rich sauce. I also added a few drops of Tabasco and Worchestshire sauce as well as Mrs. Dash. I think the next time I make it I will make a bread crumb topping. I can't wait to make it again!!

The recipe doesn't say to cook the macaroni before mixing everything together and it should.  I didn't cook it beforehand and it didn't get done all the way.  It was okay - I'm sure it will be better the next time when the pasta is cooked all the way.

I didn't have a package of macoroni, so I used a box of mac & cheese. I cooked it according to the package, then added the ham, about 3/4 c of milk, 1 cup of frozen veggies, and a can of cream of chicken soup. I poured it in a 1 1/2 qt casserole dish and topped with french fried onions and crushed crackers mixed with melted butter. I cooked @ 350 for about 35 min. GREAT!

This was an easy, good tasting way to use up some leftovers.  I had a hard time getting the macaroni to get done, though.  I think next time I will boil the macaroni before adding it to the casserole dish.

This recipe is lacking serious instructions. What the author forgot to mention was to add 1 (8 ounce) package elbow macaroni - COOKED!  If you follow the instructions given you will not be eating in 45 mins.  I followed this recipe without cooking the noodles but felt because the noodles were uncooked it needed more liquid - so I doubled the milk.

I had a leftover pork roast that I used for the meat.  Used bowtie pasta and only 1 c of cheese to reduce calories.  Doctored up the spices as others suggested with Worchestershire sauce, Mrs. Dash, garlic, Tobasco, etc.  Cooked bowties separately.  Added probably 1/2 cup more milk as I didn't want it to be dry.  Nice dish to use up leftovers.

This was excellent.   I used cream of mushroom soup (since I didn't have any cream of chicken) and I also left out the vegetables.   I did cook the pasta al dente.  I also put a few drops of tabasco sauce in the milk and soup mixture.  When all ingredients were in the casserole dish and mixed well, I topped with some italian spiced bread crumbs.   It was delicious.

Good stuff. I halfed the recipe with good results. Next time I might want to put some kind of cracker or bread crumb topping but there will be a next time. Cook the macaroni first also, thanks.

I have made this a few times now...  I use the basic idea but always change it up a bit due to what I have on hand.  This evening I made it with some leftover smoked turkey, mushrooms, onion and of course garlic. Very easy to make it to fit your families taste.

Another comforting dish which tastes even better on a cold N.J. winter night. I added an additional can of soup along with garlic and onion powders.

This is a great base to use up whatever leftovers you may have in the fridge and cupboard.  I've done it a couple times with various ingredients and it's always come out good.  Tonights dinner consists of smoky links, ham lunchmeat, red potatoes, broccoli and cauliflower along with the cheese, soup and milk (omitted noodles).  I use whatever cheese we have in the fridge also.  A great way to use up those scraps that accumulate!  Thanks so much for sharing this idea.

Don't know how this recipe would taste as written, but with my changes I'd say it's 5 stars. First of all I used left over pork roast. Don't know how my changes would work with ham, but chicken I'm sure would  be just as good. 

I saute'ed some onion, green pepper, mushroom and garlic. I cut the milk in half and substitued sour cream for the other half. DEFINITELY cook the noodles in water until tender. I didn't use canned vegetables, but had some frozen peas and beans. I put some of these in with the noodles as they  were cooking (for about 5 minutes). I used cream of mushroom soup instead of the chicken. And lastly I didn't put cheese into the noodles, but used some cheddar cheese as a topping. I cooked the casserole covered with foil (do not grease pan) for about 25 minutes. Remove the foil and topped with some cheese. Turn the oven onto broil and let the cheese brown. I also used a little steak/chop seasoning to the mix. You'll love it.

Dry and blan, needed to dilute the soup or to cook the macaroni first. A little heat from cayenne or chili powder maybe.

I used shredded pork leftover meat, wheel pasta (cooked), frozen green beans, cream of chicken soup (I seasoned the milk with worchestshire sauce, cayenne pepper, garlic & onion powder and basil), cheddar and jack cheese shredded, and topped it with bread crumbs and remaining cheese.  Its baking now, I'll let you know how it turns out...I'm guessing pretty good!

Made this without my usual habit of first reading the reviews. Wrong move! I thought it highly odd that the noodles weren't cooked, but the recipe had such a high rating, that I thought it must work. I was still uneasy, so I added WAY more liquid to the recipe, though. Instead of just one cup of milk, I added 3-1/2 cups of milk. All milk was soaked up by the noodles & the noodles were cooked, but still not as tender as I like them. I also had to add an extra 15 minutes to the cook time. When it was finished, it was edible which is why it got two stars instead of one, but nothing I'd cook again. It was extremely dry (even with all the extra liquid added).

My husband and I had this with leftover ham.  I wasn't sure from the directions if the macaroni was suppose to be cooked and drained first.  I just added it dry.  I used 2 cups dry macaroni.  Also I used frozen mixed vegetables, so I added a little water to be sure there was enough liquid.  Thanks for a good recipe.

My husband LOVED it.  We followed the recipe using ham.  I did cook the noodles before I added them to the rest of the ingredients, and that worked great.  I used cream of mushroom soup instead of cream of chicken, and I used half swiss cheese and half chedder, which added some additional flavor.  My husband recommended crumpling potato chips on top for the last 15 minutes of baking, which turned out to be a nice touch.  I will definitely make this again with whatever leftover meats I have.  It was simple and delicious.

This was very good and simple to make.  I added 2 cans of cream of mushroom soup instead of the one can of cream of chicken soup.  You can toss in any left-over or canned veggies too.  You really can't mess this up.  It was very good!

Not bad, a little bland. I used leftover cubed turkey, pre-cooked the noodles as others have suggested, used frozen, chopped broccoli (thawed) in place of the canned mixed veggies and added garlic & onion powder to taste.  The result was okay.  I really like the idea of this recipe but if I make it again, I will saute some chopped onions and fresh mushrooms in a little butter and add them in to.  I'll still use the broccoli but maybe I'll also add some minced garlic or additional spices. At the very least, I'm willing to give this recipe a second try.

Super easy and equally delicious. I modified spices to my families taste. I added some tabasco sauce as we enjoy a little kick to every meal and topped it with Italian bread crumbs during the last five minutes of cooking! I used left over pork instead of ham. Makes me happy the extra meat went to another meal! Will definitely use the recipe with other meat in the future!

This is a great recipe.  I took the chance and put in raw macaroni.  What a time and pot saver!  It came out great.  I did add a little dried mustard and paprika.  I will definitely make this again.  This is a delicious, quick, easy meal.  Even my 12 year old liked it!

WOW! This was an awesome recipe. I made this using leftover boxed mac and cheese and then I followed advice of others and added worcestershire and a dash of cayenne pepper and one fresh jalapeno with the seeds removed. It was not too spicy and added great flavor. This one is going to be added to my recipe box.

I was very pleased with this recipe. Everyone in the house liked it. I did add garlic and green onions to recipe. On top I used cracker crumbs and a small amount of french fried onions. Yum!!

This was pretty good. I had already reached the point of running down the street naked, screaming all the way before eating another turkey sandwich. This was a very nice alternative. I'll keep this handy.

This is a really quick, easy, and delicious way to use leftover meat.  I used leftover pot roast as the meat.  As per the other reviewers, I cooked the pasta before hand.  I made the following substitutions: 1 can of cream of potato soup for the cream of chicken; 1 (16 oz.) bag of frozen peas for the canned vegetables; and I used 8 oz. of mostaccioli for the maccaroni only because that's what I had at home.  This was extremely tasty!

I used this for some leftover beef roast and it was really a filling meal.  Rather than mixed veggies I would add frozen peas next time; after reading other reviews, I cooked the macaroni prior to cooking...I can't imagine how poorly it would have turned out without this being done.  Overall, a good meal.

I tried this after Thanks giving and was so impressed that I sent it to my sister

My husband said it was good but I thought it was just ok. I used leftover chicken from a roaster I had cooked and removed the bones. Because I had the liquid stock, I did not add milk. I cooked the macaroni first and used what vegetables I had left over from other meals, carrots, celery, and green beans. I also topped it with a few crushed club house crackers I had hanging around and sprinkled with parmesan cheese (a suggestion from one of the reviews).

It defiantly needs to be edited to say cooked macaroni, otherwise good recipe. I think if I added 1/2 c water it would have helped with the original recipe.

Very good, quick and easy.  We cooked the ham with one small, sliced onion and a clove of garlic, before adding to the rest with a dash of thyme and black pepper.

We loved this casserole.  Only changes I made was to saute a chopped onion in a couple of tablespoons of butter, used egg noodles rather than macaroni and topped with crushed Ritz crackers sprayed with butter Pam.  It was enough for 3 meals for my husband and me.

Great! I used a can of green beans instead of mixed veggies because that's what I had on hand, and it was very tasty! I also cooked the noodles about half the normal cooking time before adding them so that they would be partially cooked, because I don't think that amount of liquid would have cooked them completely. A great way to use up leftovers and a great comforting potluck meal. Next time I might put a little more liquid in it and cover it for half the cooking time so the noodles on top don't dry out.

Very good recipe.  I didn't have any cream of soup so I added more milk and used left over pork roast and frozen mixed veggies.  I did not cook the pasta before hand, I figured the extra time in the oven was worth not dirtying another pot and colander and being the same amount of time.  I was very crunchy on top.  I think this would work better in bowl type casserole dish than in a 9x13 pan.  Less surface area to get hard and crunchy.  But, my hubby said it's a keeper which he doesn't say very often to new recipes.

My family really enjoyed this with a few changes that I made.  I cooked the macaroni first, substituted cream of mushroom for the cream of chicken as that's what I had on hand, added some garlic powder and cayenne pepper, and sprinkled french fried onion rings on top.  The only other change I'll make in the future is to saute some onions to mix in to give it a little more taste.

I tweaked this also.  I used two cans of chicken breast and one can of chopped ham for the meats.  The can of mixed vegetables I had consisted mostly of carrots, so I added a can of corn and a can of string beans. Instead of cream of mushroom, I used cream of celery.

As far as it being bland, I fixed that with crushed red pepper and ground black pepper!  And changing the cheese from cheddar to a mix of mozzarella and cheddar/monterey jack mix added even more flavor.

We'll be making more adjustments as this becomes one of our new favorites!

It wasn't too bad. I wanted to add a little more flavor and grabbed the garlic salt. But with the ham it made it pretty salty. I will use the powder next time. I also didn't have cheddar so I used mozzarella cheese...which the kids loved! I used bow-tie pasta and cooked it "almost" done that way it would finish in the oven. Most of us loved it and a couple just thought it was OK. But it is something that I will make again if we ever have leftover ham again!!

very easy recipe....i used leftover ham along with about a cup of frozen peas.  i also combined melted butter with bread crumbs to put on top.  you definately have to cook the macaconi first...i'm pretty sure that there's no way you could expect it to turn out with uncooked pasta.

okay I'm one of those people that reads all of the reviews and recommendations before I make a recipe. From there I decide whether I'm going to tweak the recipe or make it just as written. first thing, definitely cook your pasta first and separate. I highly recommend fast boil pasta- it takes less than 3 minutes. I added a splash of Tabasco and Worcestershire sauce and for my vegetables I used steamed green peas because I don't eat canned vegetables everything else I did the same and then the end it was "just okay. IT'S MISSING THAT "ONE THING". and it definitely was on the dryer side. a good recipe to start with but highly recommend tweaking... it was missing something. I just don't know what that something is.

Well... I started with this as a template. I didn't measure the ham. And I added a 500 gram bag of frozen broccoli. Used a bag of shredded mozzarella and cheddar. Then I used a fusilli pasta. I cooked the pasta first. I also added a can of Campbell's cheddar soup. Sprinkled bread crumbs on top. Same time in the oven and I let it stand for 15 minutes. Super creamy. I wish I could give you the exact amounts. But I measured nothing. But my 12 year old does not like Ham. And she ate it all!!

This was amazing!  Very tasty. I used one cup of ham and one cup of turkey. And my husband and I ate every bite over about three days. I'm keeping the recipe for future reference. It will be a good one for church pot lucks.

I did everything as the recipe called for, but changed the milk to lactose free milk, and I doubled the recipe. I reduced the milk by 1/2 cup, and replaced it with 1/4 cup Marsala wine (as did someone else who tried this) and 1/4 chicken broth. I added a little extra cheese on top & parsley flakes for looks. It is delish!!!!!! But I agree that a bread crumb topping would be amazing! Thank you for the recipe! We love it & WILL make it again!

Followed others suggestions - definitely cook the pasta first!!   That appeared to be a misprint in the recipe.   Used leftover cooked rotisserie turkey breast from the store, cream of mushroom soup and fresh mushrooms, a package (about 10 oz.) of mixed frozen veggies - which I cooked in the microwave for about 2 mins. before blending with everything else.   Also followed another person's suggestion to use 1/4 cup of marsala wine with 3/4 cup of milk.    Grated a little more cheese on top of everything before cooking.   Done in about 30 mins. or so, and really pretty darn good.

I added chopped white onion, chopped red bell pepper and substituted frozen peas for frozen mixed veggies.  I added black pepper.  It was a HIT.  The leftovers should even be better!  This is comfort food.

I used chicken.  It was pretty good, and froze well.  I had it for dinner and several lunches.  Great way to use meat from a rotisserie chicken!  I did cook the macaroni before making the casserole and I used a bag of mixed veggies from the frozen section.

Excellent way to eat up left over turkey. As others have said you really should cook the macaroni first which is what I did. I added more turkey than the 2 cups called for and more mixed veg (used frozen as that's what I had) but it just made for a richer mix. I added an extra cup of shredded cheese as I love cheese. I added a topping of crushed Breton whole wheat crackers and I gotta say that was a really good addition.
My Girlfriend and I ate our fill and I probably have enough left over for 3 or 4 more meals throughout the week...just heat and serve.
We loved this recipe.

This was a good basic recipe. I used left-over Easter ham. I cooked the macaroni first and added frozen peas the last few minutes of cooking instead of the mixed vegetables. I also added 1/2 a diced onion, garlic powder, and dry mustard. I substituted Monterey Jack cheese as that was what I had on hand. It was quite tasty and my husband liked it a lot.

DON'T FORGET TO BOIL THE PASTA FIRST! I see this was a common mistake from other users... I liked this, it was perfect for leftover ham.  I would probably make again with ham steaks.  I too, did not add the veggies when I made it, served them on the side.  Next time I will mix in.  Make sure you use a giant size bowl to mix well before putting into a baking dish.  The family liked it a lot, even my 7 yr old son...

awsome recipe, the only recomendation i can make is to add more cheese, and put cheese as a final layer on top of the casserole.

This recipe was delicious!  I precooked the macaroni a bit (boiled 5 minutes of the 7-8 minute box directions) to avoid the problems other people had where the macaroni took longer to cook.  I omitted the vegetables since I typically don't like everything all mixed up and just served them on the side instead.  The ham gave it a really good flavor... yummy!

This is a no-fail recipe and very adaptable, Providing you cook the macaroni first. I used cream of celery soup, ham, and the recommended 2 cups of cheese.  My secret ingredient: 4 chopped jalapenos, any fresh or canned chilies  will work great. This dish comes out bubbling and tasty!

I agree with others that it needs extra spice and it is versatile so you can add other ingredients. However, I think it's a great recipe in that you do NOT have to cook the macaroni first. Simply add an extra cup or more of cheese on top, and it will keep the pasta moist.

This was alright. A good way to use leftover ham. It's also very versatile. You can add or not add veggies. It definatly needs seasoning up a bit though!

This was pretty good. I did make a few alterations also. I cooked the macaroni first and then added the ham, used cream of celery soup instead of chicken, added garlic powder, cayenne pepper and 1/2 cheddar and 1/2 hot pepper cheese. Not bad will use again!

This was exactly what it said - a leftover casserole.  Is was good, but not exactly exciting.  It was very much like macaroni and cheese with ham and peas (the meat and veg I used).  I did add some water to the sauce to thin it out to cook the pasta and I had to turn my oven up to 450 to getthe sauce hot enough to cook the raw pasta.  But that worked well.

I made this recipe with ham without the vegetables, and it was a bit too salty for our tastes (I did not add any salt).  Perhaps using the low-salt version of the soup would be better when using ham.

This is super easy to make!  I used turkey and since I didn't have cream of chicken, I used cream of celery.  I didn't have mixed vegetables, so I used a can of corn.    My family liked it.  I'll be making it more just because it's super easy and tastes pretty good.

This recipe was great for my one year old and husband, who both have simple tastes.  I used chicken, and found it o.k. but a little bland.  I'll make again for the rest of the family, but will probably add a little more flavor to my plate.
