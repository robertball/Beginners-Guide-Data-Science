AWESOME and EASY! I used an 8oz. pkg. of sliced mushrooms, because that's all I had, which I sauteed in the 1/2 cup of butter (omitting the 2 tbsps.). Then I added in a clove of minced garlic (which I left in there). Once that was done, I added in the block of cream cheese and melted it in. I then added in the milk and combined until smooth. I added the parm to thicken and at the end, I added a box of frozen peas that I had cooked. Heated it all through and seasoned with pepper and a little dried basil (it's all I had)...YUM, YUM, YUM!!!! I served this over wagon wheel shaped pasta for something fun. I LOVED the ease of this recipe, and the outcome was nothing short of DELICIOUS! The beauty of this recipe is that it is so versatile and pretty much anything you like can be added. I will definately be making this often (I'm an alfredo addict, lol)! Thanks for sharing. :)

I have been making this recipe for years (given to me by a friend).  I use Chicken or Shrimp instead of the mushrooms, or make it plain.  However, I DO NOT use the butter at all.  It does not need it and is still SO GOOD.  That really cuts down the fat content and almost makes it a healthy recipe!

This is perfect for home cooked alfredo sauce! I cut down the butter amount to just 2tbsp. If your sauce ever turns out to be too think and you want to cut down on calories, try addding chicken stock instead of milk to thin it. Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe!

I gave this 5 stars because it was EASY and DELICIOUS. I omitted mushrooms (don't care for them), but when the sauce was complete, I spooned it over rigatoni(I didn't have farfalle or linguine),chopped broiled chicken breast and steamed broccolli. Yes, it is a little rich, but worth the splurge! Plus, if you are calorie conscious, you shouldn't be trying this one, anyway? Some italian bread rolls finished it off perfectly! Thanks for the recipe! Will be making again (and again).

Directions read: remove the (crushed) garlic? I sauted the garlic in the pan after the mushrooms were removed then added the rest of the ingredients. To change it up from time to time... you can add cooked chicken and fresh spinach at the end.

this just didn't have a good flavor;  I think the cream cheese is just not a good ingredient to try to make an alfredo sauce.  I made the recipe per measurements, except I used a bunch of mushrooms and doubled the garlic-- really the only good part of it.
Ok to eat once-- never repeat it.

This was delicious!  I used shredded Asiago, and it was awesome!  I will make it next time with Parmesan just to compare, but I am sure it will be equally great.  SO fast and easy!  The best alfredo sauce I've made to date, and I've tried several on here.  Thanks for sharing!

Great Recipe, I have been using this recipe for over 2 years now, everyone loves it. Its even better if you split the cheese do half Parmesan and half Jack cheese. I've even used this recipe to make a Mac and cheese, just replace the parmesan with cheddar and cut the basil. It has so many possibilities! My next goal is to make a queso dip out of it.

I love this recipe. Its a quick and easy alfredo sauce, I really like garlic, so this was perfect for me. If you dont like garlic, you shouldn't try this recipe.

Best homemade alfredo ever! I only had powdered parmesan, and used basil pesto to taste;  but still turned out amazing! This is the only alfredo I'll ever make again :) I served with basil pesto stuffed chicken breast, wrapped in prosciutto.

Very tasty. I'm not much of an alfredo person, but this one was really good.  I had some mozzarella on hand, so I tossed some in and used the sauce with the Sausage and Bow-tie Pasta Florentine (pamelina77) found on this site. It was creamy and cheesy and a wonderful balance to the hot Italian sausage.

Yummmmmm.

I just made this.  Yes, it was good, but it took forever to thicken and it never would have without adding a little flour/milk mix to it.  I probably wouldn't go to all the time and trouble when there are several pre-made sauces on the market that are much faster and taste just as good, if not better.  I added shrimp and baby peas to the final dish and everyone love it.

So I used this recipe constantly, but it is my habit to make adjustments every time until I find a new twist that I like. This is a wonderful base to use when experimenting and testing your skill, and is also great when the recipe is followed. I make "my own" version of this sauce at least 4 times a month.

I just finished eating my Cream Cheese Alfredo Sauce.  It was DEEElicious!  I had a handful of shrimp and some small scallops, which I added to the Alfredo Sauce, when it was prepared.  Then I added in the noodles.  I have enough left over for at least 2 more meals and I 1/2'd the recipe!  Easy peasy and I had 2 slices of Garlic Toast to go with it.  Thank you for sharing this easy recipe!

This was excellent!  Lovely consistency and flavor.  I changed a little bit up according to other reviewers but it is still the base recipe.  I added chicken that I had baked and then cut into bite size pieces - served over angel hair pasta.  I froze the other half, so time will tell how it tastes the second time around.

Excellent. I didn't skimp on butter.  I added some wine and red pepper flakes.  I would think you could add other veges, as well as mushrooms, and shrimp sounds good (I added peas because I try to add vges to any preparation I can).  I tasted it before I added the wine and pepper flakes, so I tasted the original recipe. Hope it freezes well.  I minced the garlic and didn't remove it.

I've made this over and over and LOVE IT. It's so easy and tastes awesome. I haven't changed anything in all the times we've made it. I've only altered what I pair it with, from different pastas to chicken, shrimp, etc. It's my cream sauce go to!

OK. Yum. This sauce is delish, its heavenly. Just what I was looking for a creamy white sauce for some veggies and chicken. My fam loved it. It is a Keeper for us! I left out the mushrooms, sauteed some carrots and zucchini while the sauce came together and then threw it all in with some roasted chicken over pasta. Wow.

I liked it BUT it has way way too much butter.   Following comments on here, I cooked this using only 2tbs of butter, 1/3 less fat cream cheese, and 2 percent milk. 

I then  thinned it out a bit using vegetable stock. 

So, I gave it one start so others might read my comments and adjust, too.

I put the sauce over just cooked noodles + green peas. 
I've also put it over noods + baby spinach.
Kids and adults loved it alike.

I put sliced mushrooms because I didn't have anything else, added thin slices of a left over smoked pork roast, added some onions to the bottom of the pot let it simmer and cook down a pit then I added some white whine and let it cook down. mean while I whipped up the Alfredo sauce. above recipe. tossed it over fettuccine. added some fresh diced basil. Delicious. I would not cut down on anything. Just play with it as a base. The possibilities are endless. mmmm mmmm mmm

Consistency is good, I thought it was going to be to runny by the way it looked in the pan but set up nicely when plated.  It is lacking in flavor needs more parm and garlic.

Whole family loved it.  I added sauteed chicken and fresh spinach and eliminated the mushrooms.  I cut butter to 2 Tblsp and didn't miss it at all.  I also added a teaspoon of cooking sherry.  Quick and easy.  If it's too thick, I sometimes add a bit of chicken broth.

I reduced the butter in the melted cream cheese sauce to 2 tblspns. I left in the garlic, added dried basil and some dried parsley. I sauted the mushrooms with 1/2 red onion, one diced fancy large radish.  I poured the sauce mix over brussel sprouts that I had preboiled until tender, slicing some in half. The mushrooms were really good in it, (crimini sliced, 6 oz) as was the radish. I then baked it for a little bit while the ham was finishing off, and never added the extra parmesan, it was tasty without it. Delish.

Very easy to make and delicious tasting! I used black pepper because I didn't have white pepper. Also I used shredded parmesan cheese. I added frozen veggies which I seasoned with garlic salt and black pepper. I also used unsalted butter because I added plenty of seasoning.

Y'ALL !!! this recipe, THIS RECIPE!!! Are 10 stars available ? 

I've been wanting to make homemade alfredo sauce for years and thought it was too much trouble. This is so easy ! I like spicy foods, so I added 1tsp of cayenne. This recipe is already pretty twangy, so I wouldn't change a thing. Poured it over chicken, andoulle sausage, and green peppers. Y'ALL !!! you gotta do this very simple sauce. Tweek to your desired spice level. Again, are 10 stars available

LOVE THIS RECIPE!! I was apprehensive at first. But, after I made it. I was ecstatic over the flavor!! Ok, as with everyone else. I made some changes. After reading some of the reviews I did these 2 things: #1.) I used/substituted regular Cream Cheese with GARLIC & HERB Cream Cheese. #2.) I reduced the butter by just a little bit. Instead of a whole stick of butter (1/2 cup), I used between 1/4 to 3/4 stick of butter. and that is it! It was creamy. It was rich. And I will definitely make it again.! 


I made a Lobster & Shrimp alfredo. So I made the sauce. Then I used my Traeger grill and smoked the shrimp and lobster for 20 minutes. then I combined them with the sauce. I let the sauce simmer for another15 - 20 minutes and serve!

I made this tonight and it was great!  I actually made it with smoked salmon cream cheese and served it over cheese ravioli.  So very easy to make.   I will use this recipe again and again and just adapt it each time with different flavours.

This was so good, I did not add the mushroom and I used black pepper instead of white, also used a little less butter  than what it called for.  It tasted so good but definitely doesn't feed 6 people.

I didn't have mushrooms available, but I did everything else as the recipe states. It was delicious, and a great, quick substitute for Alfredo sauce. I put this over pasta and steamed cauliflower and my picky kids devoured it!

I left the minced garlic in the sauce and added some pesto,cooked chopped spinach and also had some grilled salmon that I broke up and added. Mixed with some penne pasta. It was delicious!  Might need to add more milk to make sauce not so thick. Entire family loved this dish. Will add it to family favorites

Made a skinny version of this just substituted low fat and smart beat instead of butter, otherwise followed as is.  Oh I threw in a little cracked red pepper just because I like it.  It was delicious!!  Will definitely make again!!

I didn’t add mushrooms as I do not like them. I only used 1/2 cup of parmesan cheese. I’m glad because any more and it would have over powered all the other flavours. Awesome recipe. My only complaint is that it was too runny and loose. I love a thick creamy sauce

I didn’t have any butter so I used just a bit of evoo then added whipping cream instead of cream and milk. This was great! The consistency is great! I also added some broccoli and chicken tenders and served over linguine. It’s a keeper!

This is  a good recipe to start but, I will make some changes.
First I will use Asiago instead of Parmesan. Then I will use 6 cloves of roasted garlic chopped (we love garlic), replace the milk with 1 cup of real cream and spoon over a bed of angel hair pasta and cooked chicken cut into thin strips.

I have made alfredo sauce from scratch with cream but this was sooo much better.  I actually followed the recipe except -- I used regular black pepper and I added chopped sun dried tomatoes.  It was so easy I sent it off to my son at college.

Loved this recipe as it was super easy, and it tastes totally delicious!! 

I did make a few changes....
-used white mushrooms instead of portobello. 
-cooked sliced mushrooms in the 1/2 cup butter (omitting the 2 tbsp)
-added cream cheese to the mushrooms. 
- then added garlic and left it in
- added approx 1/2 cup white wine in the end (adds wonderful flavour while making the sauce a bit thin to make it go a longer way)

My family loved it. I only used parmesan cheese, cream cheese, butter, milk and garlic. We are not big mushroom lovers.
Family said better than Olive Garden. Winner!!!!!

Delicious.  We made it with bacon bits and kale in addition.  Served it with steamed broccoli and it was terrific together.  We made it as directed.  I wouldn't hesitate to reduce the butter a bit next time, but I also don't feel the butter was too rich.  It was very good.

I have made this recipe a couple times now and it is a winner for sure!  I did modify a few things I used 1c whole milk and 1/2 cup heavy cream I also sautéed yellow, red and orange peppers, onions and added chicken to this recipe.  It is excellent and received nothing but compliments and requests to make it again.

So delicious, everyone in my family loved I! I made it with spaghetti noodles, and added chicken, spinach, and red pepper flakes. Didn't use the white pepper, and (accidentally) minced the garlic and it was still absolutely perfect. Tenouttaten.

I used garlic salt to taste instead of crushed garlic and a five Italian cheese blend instead of plain Parmesan and it was fantastic! Also seasomed some chicken and baked it, them mixed it in for a full meal!

I thought this was pretty yummy--I was surprised at the cream cheese, but the flavor really developed with the garlic and the parmesan. I think that it's key to use quality ingredients for this, and that might help for those who ended up not liking this. The first time I made this as directed and thought it was lovely, but I made it just for myself and a friend. Now when I make it, I omit mushrooms and basil because of DH's food pickiness. I cut the amount of butter to just 1/4 cup the last time I made it just to save a little on fat. I use lowfat cream cheese and skim milk. So I know--this isn't "authentic" alfredo sauce but so far, it's the winner in my house.

I used fresh button mushrooms instead of portabellas and added 10z frozen chopped spinach drained and a pound of baby shrimp.  Added minced garlic to the butter/mushroom mixture along with seasoned salt. 
I found out I had no milk so I subbed 1/2 heavy cream and 1/2 chicken broth.  When I first tasted the sauce all I could taste was the cream cheese.  However when all the other ingredients went in it was very good and I will make it again.

I used the less fat lite cream cheese, added garlic powder, blended Italian seasoning, a dash of Italian dressing, milk dash of salt and black pepper.  Instead of mushrooms I used broccoli & added chicken, served over bow tie pasta.  Deliciousness!!

Great recipe that was easily made vegan! Substituted vegan butter, tofutti cream cheese and unsweetened silk coconut milk and the results were great! Got a lot of compliments on this dish. Also added green beans and broccoli and served with pasta and garlic bread! Made it for my mothers birthday, Great recipe, it's a bit on the unhealthy side so I'll reserve it for special occasions but it taste great even vegan!

This was awesome.  I did use presliced portabella mushrooms and marinated them with steak I was pairing the sauce with. I also paired it with Rana portabella and porcini mushroom raviolis. Instead of regular parmesan cheese I used a parmesan, Asiago, romano mix and added the marinated mushrooms to sauce. It was a birthday dinner and a huge hit. Definitely making again.

Yum!!!  Followed directions exactly. Will mince garlic and leave it in next time. Super rich! Also added smoked salmon and a squeeze of lemon at the table.

This is the best alfredo that I have ever made! I added more parm cheese, about a half cup and about 1/2 more milk to try to make a little extra and it worked fine. We did not use mushrooms and we grated 4 cloves of garlic into it. Delicious!

Super easy,  first time and I nailed it!   
I added chopped frozen spinach,  roasted onions and peppers to mushroom saute and added it back at the end. I aslo added Romano, &   six Italian cheese mix I had in the refrigerator awesome but way to thick.  I wanted to add some chicken stock to thin but I was afraid it would ruin the sauce so I just used more milk.  Next time I'll use less cream cheese.  After reading the reviews I saw someone say you can add chicken stock. I served the sauce tossed with bow tie and tri-color pene and grilled  pork  chop.   

Only Complaint: my sauce had a little kick at the back(lingered around my mouth to long).  Did I do so something wrong?

The only thing I ALWAYS add to my alfredo sauces is a DASH of nutmeg...barely a measurable amount...but it adds a mysterious nutty flavor to the sauce...SO good!
