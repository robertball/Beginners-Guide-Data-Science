Kinda has a Mongolian beef thing going on, seemed a tad salty which is probably the oyster sauce. Tastes like the closest thing to take out Chinese I have ever made. Can't wait to make again and add Siracha and more veggies like baby corn, matchstick carrots, water chestnuts, bean sprouts, sugar snap peas maybe an onion or scallions. Maybe an extra 1/2-3/4 cup of water to tame the salt and help steam the extra produce.

Absolutely yummy!!! I had to substitute a few things since I live in the middle of nowhere in the Deep South but it's on the make again list for another night. I didn't have sherry so I used a Pinot Noir. I didn't have fresh broccoli I had to use frozen, the roasting and charring helped this ingredient. I had a few mushrooms that needed a meal so they were thrown in. Finally I don't own a wok, I've found a well seasoned cast iron skillet can substitute for lots of pans when needed.

I liked the basic recipe, it went together well enough. However the gravy to felt a little too portage like, I lightened it up with a table spoon of rice wine vinegar. I recommend cutting  the soy in this dish down, I ended up adding a teaspoon of sugar for balance.  Will make it again.

I made this and it was very simple, however; I didn't do such a good job reading the directions and I didn't roast the broccoli but it still came out really good.

I have tried other beef broccoli recipes without much satisfaction. This one was perfect. My entire family, adults and children alike enjoyed it. This recipe will certainly rotate through our regular meals. Thank you for sharing ??

Made as written and doubled the sauce and Chef John mentioned in the footnotes. We like it saucy. This was fantastic! The roasted broccoli gives the dish an added layer of flavor which sets it apart from any other beef and broccoli I've had. 5 stars all the way!

Want to thank chef john for allowing me to stay  home to enjoy Chinese take-out. Followed the directions spot on but I used brown rice instead of white.

Thanks for this great recipe and preparation instruction, Chef John! It tickled my own palate to a T as prescribed although a couple other family members found it a bit saltier and "saucier" than they thought optimal. Next time I'll halve the oyster sauce, broth, and corn starch and see how it goes. Great video on the prep. Very easy to learn from. Following this chef.

Quite good - I substituted Xanthum Gum for the cornstarch to keep it a bit more Keto friendly - turned out rich and delicious.

It was yummy but noticed that ingredients called for a pinch of cayenne pepper but didn't see this mentioned in the directions so made without it. Not sure where cayenne pepper was supposed to be used on:

I love everything about this dish..simple ingredients, easy and quick to prepare.. followed the recipe exactly and it was very good..not spectacular but above average.  (maybe cut back on the oyster sauce just a touch next time).. second time I made it I doubled the sauce per other reviews.. BIG mistake.. the sauce is very good but very strong flavored, when doubled it over powered everything instead of enhancing the dish. do yourself a favor and make it exactly as written the first time..

Seemed the charring did give an extra something tasty to this beef'n'broccoli.   Not too hard  since I used pre-chopped beef and very nice flavor.

Absolutely delicious. Seriously amazing. I'm so glad I found this recipe. We moved to a place that does not have a good Chinese food, and beef and broccoli is my favorite. This recipe is perfect!  I made it exactly as directly.  Next time, I will lessen the soy sauce and I won't salt the beef. It was a bit salty, and I'm a salt lover.  Will 100% add this to my recipe box!

I followed recipe exactly, using minimum charring time, as I wasn't sure how I would like the flavor. It was delicious...next time I will allow to char even more.

If you feel this is salty, check your oyster sauce. Before buying oyster sauce read the ingredients on the label. Oyster sauce should always be the number one ingredient. If it isn't, keep looking on other brands.
