I bake the cake in a 9x13 pan, place the drained pineapple on top and then frost with whipped topping/pudding frosting. It's a great recipe!

This cake is fantastic...  I made a few easy changes based on the  6  reviews  that were already on here.   I used a yellow butter cake mix which replaces the oil with melted butter to add richness.   I used 20 ounce crushed pineapple in heavy syrup instead of 16 ounce in juice which added moisture and sweetness to the cake.   I made it in a 9 x 13 pan baking it for 30 minutes at 350 F instead of 2 layers since everyone was complaining of it falling apart.  My  husband could not get enough!  He ate 3 pieces at one sitting!  He is not normally a big cake eater.

This recipe is very similar to the cake I remember my mother and grandmother baking for special occasions.  A moist cake with a sweet light frosting, it brings back happy memories. It is a simple uncomplicated cake of pure straightforward flavors. Love it. Next time I think I will be a little less zealous in draining the pineapple; my cake is maybe a little too moist and my frosting a tad dry. Not the fault of the recipe though.
