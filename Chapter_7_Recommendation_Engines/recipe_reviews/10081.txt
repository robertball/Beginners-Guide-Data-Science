Pretty runny batter. Turned out to be pretty flat cookies which were fine. I topped with orange cream cheese frosting. I left out the walnuts. Got lots of complements!

Amazing!  I used whole-wheat flour for the all-purpose flour.  I used 1 can carrots (drained) that I pureed along with a handful of raw baby carrots, grated. I juiced some Cuties oranges, and used the fresh juice in the batter & frosting.  In the frosting I added some Grand Mariner.  Baked as instructed- they came out perfect- soft- not hard.  Cooled then frosted.  I WILL make these again!

loved this simple recipe. i used canned carrots, mushed up before adding, because i had extra on hand. and to adjust for high altitude, i added 1/4 cup more orange juice and 2 T flour. topped with store bought cream cheese frosting. i made a tray of these for teacher appreciation at my kids' school - they were a huge hit!  am making again and again! Thank you Debbie Rowe!

Well I used fresh grated carrots , 1/2 cup. 
The mixture turned out very dense and I could roll them
Into balls. They stayed that way. Took about 18
Minutes to bake. I used 1/2 cup brown sugar and
1/3 cup honey. 
The cookie balls turned out okay. 
I'll make them again.
