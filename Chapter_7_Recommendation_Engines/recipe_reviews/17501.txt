These were pretty good.  The filling is a little blander than I would have liked-- I would add more salsa.  I used brown rice instead of white for an extra-high-fiber meal!

This recipe was very easy to make, although I changed the peppers to a red and yellow mix, the rice to brown rice and the salsa to spicy for added flavor.  I didn't plan enough time to cook the rice though (45 mins!) which was the only difficulty - more my fault than anything else.
This recipe froze well, so the extra portions make great lunches at work.
