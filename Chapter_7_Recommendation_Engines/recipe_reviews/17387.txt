My father-in-law is from St. Louis and said it was wonderful!   I almost used one of the other recipes with the cake mix and cream cheese.  That would have been a disaster!!!  I was told this recipe is just like the real thing from St. Louis!!!

This is the same gooey butter topping from Richard Sax's cookbook, but with a homemade crust.  Surprisingly, I really enjoyed the crust, but not the goo so much!  It was too sweet for my taste, too gooey (when I cut the cake, the goo oozed down the sides instead of remaining firm), and there was just too much goo for the amount of crust.  I'll definitely use the crust recipe in the future, but I'm still searching for the perfect goo.  I suspect most bakeries here in St. Louis use a cream cheese variation.

I have been searching and searching for this recipe for a very long time.  I was pleased to find the "original" recipe here with no shortcuts. It takes time, but it well worth it!

I have been searching for this recipe for so long and am thrilled that I finally found the right one!  Most of the recipes I've found are the ones with the cream cheese and cake mix, but those can't hold a candle to this one.

If I could divide the rating into two, I'd give the crust a 1 and the "goo" a 4.  The crust is too doughy and not enough like cake; it's very dense and heavy.  I also think the crust is too plain. I was born and raised in St.Louis and all of the gooey butter cakes that I've had, had more of a cake feel and taste to the crust.  The "goo" is very tasty, but was way too runny.  The crust made by the goo on the very top was excellent, though.  The "goo" definitely tasted like the gooey butter cakes I've had growing up, but the one on this definitely needed to be less runny.  Nice try, but it needs some tweaking!

We're on the right track here, but anyone who enjoys the real butter cake recipe will find this one overcooked.  Where is the "goo"?  18 minutes may be too long.  It makes 2 large pans -- why not put in a 9 x 13" pan??  The recipe calls for one TBSP. of vanilla extract under ingredients, but only 1 tsp. of vanilla in the text, which one is it??  Not as expected for the amount of time and effort.

I have lived my whole life in the St. Louis area and grew up near a metro east bakery that is famous for gooey butter cake.  Cream cheese solidifies gooey butter cake's topping and gives it a cheesy danish taste.  The end product of a gooey butter cake should be gooey, running gooey, and buttery in flavor.  It is a messy, but delicious result!  This recipe is spot on for my favorite.

My grandparents owned a bakery in St. Louis and this is the recipe my mom uses (and has been for decades) that's as close to theirs as she can find.  Authentic St. Louis gooey butter does NOT use a cake mix OR cream cheese!  And to those complaining that it is too gooey, that's exactly how it's supposed to be--oozing and gooing all over the place, not holding its shape.  If it's firm, then it is overcooked.  This dessert is quite rich but oh so delicious!  A family tradition for generations of our family.

This was very good!  I've been hunting for a recipe similar to Sara Lee's Butter Coffee Cake (frozen) and first tried one of the Gooey Butter Cake recipes that used cake mix and cream cheese - NOT it!  So I tried this one, and it was dang close (minus having a streusel topping).  Halved the recipe and used margarine for the shortening and butter - but changed nothing else.  Yum!  So much better than the cake mix/cream cheese recipes.

I had never baked, or eaten anything like this "cake" before so I had no expectations. I love it and so does everyone who has had some.  I had ghee (clarified butter) on hand so I used that in the "goo" the third time and what a wonderful flavor. Thank-you for a wonderful addition to my "something special" collection.

I grew up with a MOM that made this on a regular basis, per request from our large family.  We LOVED that the 1st day this would "run" but the 2nd day it was like a whole 'nother cake that you could eat on the run by picking up a piece...  We baked with the notion of telling when it's done by the golden color of the cakes and that they should still be a little wiggley.  { and yes, this is the original cake  from South St. Louis }

Well, it's not quite like the ones I grew up with.  Our family would always get our gooey butters from Kruda's bakery in Collinsville.  Hands down best ones anywhere!

This recipe calls for too much filling to crust.  You can put in 9x13 cake oan fine and cut the filling amounts in half or even 1/3 and have it turn out great. Otherwise, your crust gets way over-done and the filling is not done enough to cook the flour taste out.

Still good flavors and very close but just not there.  Kruda's just won't give up there recipe unfortunately.  I'll try this one again just adjusting the amounts.
