Reading the reviews and negative responses...there is no ginger in the recipe, so how could your Mom dislike it? A little thin but tasty?

A little thinner than the store bought version but the taste is superior. Excellent recipe! If you are sensitive to heat leave the pepper flakes out and it will still be just as flavorful.

good but a little thin, and for some reason my mum hated the ginger. She said compared to hoisin from the restaurant it tasted off, she was the only one though.
