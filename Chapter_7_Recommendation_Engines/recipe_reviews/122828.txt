my family loved this recipe...however i did some things differently. i used a 13x9 in. dish. i didn't have frozen potatoes so i used about 6-7 real potatoes diced up somewhat thin. i layered the potatoes into the greased dish and added deli thin ham & then sprinkled cheese over top. then i mixed the cheddar cheese soup, cream of mushroom, & about 1/4 cup of french onion chip dip(*i didn't have sour cream*)poured that over top of the potatoes and ham. added more cheese on top and baked at 400 degrees for 45 mins. came out perfectly...very yummy!!

Great basic one-pot recipe.  I always love basic recipes that you can use and by adding things make my own.  The first time I made this, I used all the ingredients called for in the original recipe.  The second time I made this, I did not have sour cream or a can of condensed potato soup.  So, instead I used a package of cream cheese, a half of pint of heavy cream and a can of condensed mushroom soup. Both times I also used 16 oz of shredded cheddar cheese. It turned out great both ways!!! A totally yum recipe that can be made for breakfast, lunch or dinner.  I am going to make it for my mother's group.  Thanks for sharing!!!

Great comfort food!!  I made this the other night for supper, and got rave reviews from my husband and son!  Had some substitutes, used about 3/4 of a med block of Velveta in place of cheddar cheese soup and used 2 cans of cr of potatoe, very creamy!!  Leftovers are even better.  It's a keeper!

I made this and my family really enjoyed it. I did use fresh potatoes that I had precooked, cooled and cubed. I also added broccoli at the end (so it didn't get mushy). My 5 year old said gross when he saw it, but loved it when he tried it.

I'm 9 months pregnant and I've been looking for recipes that i can make and freeze to heat up once baby is here.  I made this and cut it in half to freeze half.  I haven't had much of an appetite, and I'm really picky but i couldn't stop eating these leftovers! It was so yummy! I made it almost exactly as written, but I left out the onions, because my hubby isn't a fan. I have made it 2xs this month already! We love it!

I'm not a big fan of cream of soups but I wanted to make the recipe as written...yummy!!! I did add bacon and green onions to the top..sometimes that's the only way I can get my teenager to eat meat. I will be making this again:) Great recipe!!

Rave reviews at home. Quick assembly and easy to  make. I substituted plain yogurt for the sour cream, used shredded cheddar cheese, and used cream o mushroom soup. It had a wonderful tang to it. I also used shredded hash browns instead of potatoes o'brien, and added dried onions instead of fresh. Hubby cleaned the casserole dish!

I made this for a potluck at church and it was one of the first dishes to go! It was simple to make and my family loved it. The only thing different I did was add garlic and saute it with the ham and onions before mixing it with the other ingredients. Great casserole recipe!

Easy and so yummy, great comfort food ! Hubby and kids really like it so I make it whenever we have leftover ham. I chop up whatever is left from a spiral ham and freeze 2 cup portions just for this recipe. I have used whatever "cream of" soups that I have on hand. Cream of mushroom,  Cream of celery even cream of chicken. I do like to throw some Panko or bread crumbs in a skillet with a pat of butter and a little olive oil, toast it then sprinkle on top the last few minutes of cooking. That little crunch really compliments the creamy texture of the casserole. MMMMM, MMMM, GOOD !

This recipe was very good.  I followed some of the other reviews and only did one can of cheddar cheese soup.  It came out perfect.  My boyfriend is having the leftovers for breakfast!

Good recipe.  Simple ingredients.  I added some more cheese than what called for.  I might only use one can of soup next time.  But over all, very good, there weren't any leftovers.

This was a good recipe.  I had leftover ham and needed to find something to do with it.  I used a couple of green onions instead of a whole onion and I'm glad I did.  With the onions in the potato mix, it didn't really need more.  I would probably add a bit more green pepper next time since we like the taste.  I probably wouldn't put this in my regular dinner rotation, but with leftover ham to use up, I will keep it handy.  This was an easy meal to prepare and could be mixed ahead of time and put in the oven for a convenient meal.  Thank you for sharing this recipe.

This is a wonderful recipe, I didnt change a thing. Made it for my office Thanksgiving potluck. Got rave reviews, no leftovers. Only one peice of advice, hard to stir the sauce in with frozen hashbrowns...

Yummy!  Perfect comfort food on a cold night.  I made a half recipe and divided it evenly among 4 ramekins.  Only needed to bake 45m.

I liked this well enough, it was simple and tasty however, because of the canned cream soups it was a bit on the salty side. Sadly neither soup comes in a low sodium form.

I made this and my kids didn't like the O'Brien potatoes.  The second time I used regular hashbrown potatoes and cut the sour cream to 1 cup.  I would recommend reducing the amount of sour cream.

WOW ... I needed something to do with leftover ham.  This is the perfect recipe for that!  I followed the recipe to a tea almost but didn't have cheddar cheese soup, so I sub'd with cheddar broccoli soup.  The family loved it.  Next time I will add some green chiles.  Thanks for a great recipe!

My boyfriend loved this dish!  I decided to only add the can of cheddar soup, no potato soup.  I also added some crumbled bacon on top of the casserole before baking it.  Great recipe, I think next time I will add a dash of hot sauce to the soup mix for some extra flavor

This is comfort food at it's best. I did leave the onion out as the potatoes obrien had onions in them and I was glad I did. It was pretty "oniony" but not overwhelmingly so. I think the extra onion would put in over the top.

This was awesome! I didn't expect it to come out so creamy, almost like a chowder.  I didn't have potato soup, so used a bit of milk with it. Next time I will try leaving the milk out and maybe not as much sour cream, or add more potatoes.  Not sure yet, but we still loved it.  I crumbled up some saltines in mine.  Thanks!

I sautéed the ham & onions first, I probably also used more cheese than called for..  :p  
I broiled it for the last few minutes so the cheese would be crusty, really good

Excellent potato bake. I used two cans of potato soup instead of the cheese soup. Probably one of the best potato dishes I have ever had. Everyone has raved about it!

Brought to a brunch and it was gobbled up.  I did not add additional onions since the o brien potatoes had onions in it.  Otherwise I followed recipe exactly.

Never made anything like this before, and i'll be making it again! I used 2 cans of the potato soup mixed with a little milk and shreaded cheese. Came out perfect! Topped it off with more cheese and bread crumbs for the last 20-25 minutes in the oven.

It tasted a little too much like cream soup to me or maybe it was the cheddar soup I didn't care for. I think I would have preferred something a little more buttery in flavor. I did not have hash browns on hand so I shredded 6 med/large russet potatoes. Would also be good with thinkly sliced potatoes. I increased the ham to 2.5 cups and it was fine, but a little more wouldn't hurt either.

Gave 4 stars because I liked it, but probably will not make again.  The way we usually make this is with 2 cans of cream of chicken soup and no potato soup.  When my husband saw me making it different he said "I was ruining a dish he actually likes".  I also ended up needing part of a 3rd can of soup anyway, which was cream of chicken, so needless to say I'll save 1/2 a can of soup and make it without cream of potato next time.

Very easy to make yet very, very good! I did use 30oz bag of hash browns per some reviews and it seemed just right. I also used honey ham which tasted wonderful. I like lots of cheese, so I doubled the cheddar. I served this with steamed broccoli on the side. (Gotta love those steam-in-the-microwave veggie bags!) This recipe is a keeper!

Great recipe.  Very rich and tummy filling. I realized after baking it I left out the sour cream accidently...and it was still great!  I am sure if I make it correctly it will be even better!
