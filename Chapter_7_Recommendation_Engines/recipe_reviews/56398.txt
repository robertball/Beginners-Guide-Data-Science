This is wonderful.  I doubled the recipe and set half aside to freeze for a rainy day.  Needs more bread crumbs, but that is a personal preference.

This is almost identical to a recipe I have.  mine also adds in some crab meat (about a cup or so).  A friend from New Orleans originally made it for me- and I was HOOKED! this stuff is great!

Great recipe.  I think it's sad that this is the only recipe that comes up for mirlitons.  They are a great vegetable to use with roast instead of potatoes too!

Ok, so here's my Cajun twist on this recipe.  Instead of regular breadcrumbs, I used Italian style.  Instead of Parsley, I used fresh chopped Cilantro.  I used a Jumbo yard egg (we have chickens), three large Mirlitons (boiled, peeled and seeded) and three cups of cooked rice.  I pinched the dried thyme to release its flavor and boiled the shrimp in Creole Seasoning for a better flavor (no, not crab boil, that would've been too much).  I used Andouille sausage instead of ham and sauteed them in with the onions, garlic, olive oil and added in the Cilantro and thyme toward the end.  Then I mixed everything in a large bowl and poured it into a casserole dish.  I poured a cup of evaporated milk evenly over the top and topped with a shredded 7 Italian cheese blend.  I baked it at 350 for about 40 to 45 minutes, let stand for 10 minutes and served.  Shortly after, it was GONE!!!

I got this recipe from my southern Louisiana grandmother years ago and my kids love it! We use jimmy dean roll sausage and shrimp with Italian bread crumbs, No cheese! And of course lots of Cajun seasonings and old bay.  It's so good we use to fight over it!!!!

Tried this with my home grown Mirliton.  Only had to boil 30 minutes and I followed the receipe as written except, except being a cajun I added a spicer seasoning than it calls for.  Delicious.  I froze half after baking - hope it is still good after thawing.

I made some adjustments based on my family tastes and history in New Orleans. I added crab meat and andouille sausage instead of ham. I also sauted 1.5 green peppers, 1 jalapeno (seeds removed), and 1 celery stalk with the onions.
