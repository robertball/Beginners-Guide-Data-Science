This was sooo good!  I couldn't find lime salt so used fresh squeezed lime on fish and in bread crumb mixture which turned out awesome!  Definitely a favorite that I will make often.

I loved the crusty, tangy textures and flavors in this very easy recipe!  I didn’t have the lime flavored seasoning, so just used some Tone’s Zesty Country Seasoning, and increased the amount to 1 tsp. in the crust mixture.  I also used Italian seasoned Panko. It was very easy to mix so no blender was needed, Yay! I baked at 425 for 15 mins. just until meat turned opaque and crust browned, and that kept the fillets from drying out.  I think this recipe would work well with any good quality halibut or other firm, white fish.

This was delicious!  I would have given it five stars except the cooking time was too long. I think it would have been done in 15 minutes rather than 20.

We love halibut, and we thought this was very good.  I didn't use the exact brand of lime that you recommended, Josh, but I did come up with a decent substitute.  I otherwise followed the recipe with the exception of just heating the oven to 425 degrees.  We enjoyed our dinner, so thanks!
