I make this every year and family and friends just love it. It is so yummy it almost tastes like dessert itself! Great with Ham! *Warning, make sure to NOT put the bread cubes on until you put it in the oven or it will get mushy!

This was pretty good but my BF liked it more than I did.  Instead of using the butter to dot the bread cubes, I just buttered the bread before cutting into cubes.  It was easier that way and I didn't have to use as much butter.

Awesome recipe. Everyone loved it.  I changed a couple of things though.  I melted the butter first, added the bread and stirred it together rather than just leaving it on top.  It cooked up a little better than just leaving the bread on top.

Soon to be a tradition at Thanksgiving and Christmas, just like green bean casserole.  After topping with the cubed bread, press them into the pineapple mixture a bit and then top with melted butter instead of just dotting with pieces of hard butter.  Be sure to bake until golden for that crispy texture.

I liked this dish quite well but I still thought it was missing something.  I was complemented and even asked for the recipe.  I plan on keeping this recipe but intend on trying others similar to compare and find my favorite.  Unless of course I can improve on it myself.  I still would recommend it and think it was easy to prepare and worth the effort.

Absolutly wonderful!!!  I made this to go with a cranberry glazed pork tenderloin.  Everyone loved it and asked for the recipe.  I will definitly make this again!  I'm anxious to try this with turkey.  I followed the suggestion of buttering the bread before cubing.  Thanks

This casserole is very good. I used 1/4 cup light brown sugar, 1/8 tsp salt. I left the bread out a 1/2 day to get a little stale.  It was easier to cut into cubes. Tossed cubes in bake dish with 5 tablespoons melted butter.  This helped grease the dish.  Then mixed the cubes into the pineapple mix.  Let the dish set for at least an hour and drizzled 1 tb. butter over top before baking.  This is a great side dish for ham.

This is a staple for Thanksgiving and X-mas. Instead of just bread crumbs or crackers I use the Hawiaan sweet rolls. It goes great with ham!!

Excellent!  I doubled the recipe and used one can crushed pineapple and one can pineapple tidbits.  I also added about a teaspoon of cinnamon.  Wonderful--got rave reviews!  Buttering the bread before cutting up was a bit messy but made it a better dish.

I prepared this recipe for Thanksgiving this year and WOW everyone thought it was great.  Was one of the recipes that many people requested the recipe for before leaving that day.  Needless to say, this recipe will become a regular dish I serve for every holiday meal.  Thanks.

We tried this dish this year for Thanksgiving.  Super easy and it went over great.  Probably the favorite side dish on the table.  Many of our guests said it tastes like pineapple bread pudding.  You won't be disappointed.  It's going to be one of our staples for years to come.

This is really good & soooo easy.  I used sourdough bread, buttered it first, then cubed it (like another reviewer suggested & added a couple dollops of butter to the top), baked it for 45 min., then put it under the broiler for about 2-3 min. to brown the bread.  Everything else was just as the recipe was written--it turned out light & airy, like a soufflé!  Yum!  Will definitely make again & again.

Thank you for the recipe!  It is an interesting side dish for a sweeter taste.  I used some hamburger buns for the bread topping that I buttered before cutting up.  My granddaughters will like this!
