I made this but, I tweaked it a little. I used everything she said (minus the Salt due to the cheese already having it) plus i added a big can of Cream of Mushroom, a Can of Ro*tel Tomato, and I cheated w/ Fajita Chicken. Yes I had to basically double everything but I ended up making 2 9x13 Glass Casserole Dishes and it was still gone the next day. Everyone loved it and said it was the best Chicken Spaghetti they had. Also I used the Mexican Style Velveeta Cheese too. Enjoy is all I can say.

Honestly, I wasn't convinced that the Velveeta cheese on its own would work, but this turned out to be pure creamy, cheesy, mellow goodness.  The only liberty I took with the recipe was adding some buttered fresh bread crumbs as a topping, and I'd do that again.  Thanks S, you made a Velveeta believer out of me with this recipe...enjoyed!

We made it just like the recipe and it was very bland so the next time we made it, we used Mexican Velveeta and used a can of Rotel tomatoes. It was delicious with the additions/alterations. This is now a go-to for us when we need something to feed a large crowd or just my hungry family.

I tweaked this recipe slightly based on the ingredients I had. I added a can of Rotel tomatoes and some chopped onion so it was more of a Mexican spaghetti and it was delicious this way as well

I doubled the recipe and put in a whole poached seasoned chicken.  I used the seasoned broth that I pouched it in for the Chicken Stock required in the recipe.  It turned out very nicely.  Will make again for sure.  I picked this one because it DIDN'T have canned soup (ugh).  I was able to convert it to organic very easily because of this.

I liked this recipe because is was easier than other chicken spaghetti recipes I've seen.  I used cream of mushroom soup along with the cheese, white sauce, and broth.  Next time I will use just a bit less cheese and more chicken.

I used fresh cayenne peppers instead of powder , plus I added 1/4 more cheese than recipe calls for. This is definitely a Keeper Yum. Bake time at 350 is 30 min.. Great recipe and it makes a large amount. Freeze leftovers..

Made it last night exactly to directions.  Wasn't creamy at all, pretty thick and sticky.  Wouldn't make it again.

This made enough chicken spaghetti to feed a small army... and it was incredibly delicious. I baked a topping of Italian-style bread crumbs, Parmesan cheese, and olive oil on top; I also shredded the chicken instead of chopping it. Thank you so much for this recipe!
