I'd done something similar to this recipe as a mousse before. I prepared 1 package of instant pudding using about a half cup less milk than the package calls for then folded in a container of thawed whipped topping. After that I stored in the refrigerator not the freezer. It made a good and fairly healthy snack.

I must admit that I accidentally added too much pudding to this recipe however this is insanely good. I really don't remember how much pudding I added to the whipped topping but when I make this again I will update the amount of pudding I used. My 14 year old grandson tasted it and thought it was ice cream giving it 5 stars. I only gave it 4 stars due to me altering the recipes.
