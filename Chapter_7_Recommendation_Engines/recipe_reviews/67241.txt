I made this last night and it was very good. My husband and I like our food very spicy, so in addition to the red curry paste I added one Fresno chili. I also used 1 can (2 cups total) coconut milk, rather than the 2 1/2 cups called for. It still made a lot of sauce.

I changed the veggies to green beans and yellow bell pepper. If you use bell pepper it should go in later than the other veggies or else it will get mushy.

I'll definitely make this again - it was just as good as the Thai takeout we get all the time!

Perfect! UPDATE: I had a green curry recipe all picked out tonight and found myself out of green curry paste at the last minute. I revisited this recipe and was thrilled once more. I had to improvise the veggies again, and I amped the curry for heat, but the sauce itself is excellent made as written - especially when served over jasmine rice. Thanks again!

I have to apologise to Meghan - intended to follow this recipe exactly, but lost my nerve.  Anyway, the way I made it, it was delicious; a bit different and my family loved it.  I used low fat coconut milk, which is a bit watery; added it all at once to the curry paste and boiled a while to reduce.  I added the chicken pieces right at the end and simmered gently until just done.  I halved the fish sauce and basil - it seemed a bit much.  The end result had a well balanced and delicate flavour. BUT:  I've dared myself to try the full amount of fish sauce and basil next time!

I really, really enjoyed this. But I didn't rate this FIVE stars because there is room for improvement in the recipe as it is. First, I did find the sauce a bit mild for my taste. It lacked a "wow" factor. It was still super delish, like Thai comfort food though. Second, and this is the big reason for the four stars, I think that the cooking instructions need to be improved upon. If you cut your chicken into bite-size pieces and then brown in the curry-coconut mixture, trust me, your chicken will be cooked through without an additional 15 min. of simmer time. Additionally, you do not need to pre-thaw your veggies, and even frozen, a 15 minute simmer just kills their texture, color and taste. Finally, like others said one can (2 cups) of coconut is more than adequate for the entire recipe. I even increased my chicken to 1 1/2 lbs, and added a box of shitakes to my veggies and everything was still swimming in sauce, and usually, I like a lot of sauce.

Here is how I would alter this: 
1. Use one can of coconut milk total. I would still use half cup to cook chicken in, and then just add the rest of the can later.
2. Increase the curry paste to 2 or 3 T
2. After my chicken has been browned, I would add everything except the peppers, basil and lime juice, and then cook for only about five minutes--just until the veggies are done. Oh, and I wouldn't bother to thaw them first.
3. I would add the red peppers at the very end, then cut the heat off and pop in the basil and lime.

Amazing! I make this all of the time and it is a huge hit with everyone who tries it. My only suggestion is using lots of frozen peas, the taste goes really well with the curry

i, like many here, used only one can of "light" coconut milk.  i can't imagine using two, it would have been way too much.  i also used half fish sauce and half low-sodium soy.  i doubled the amount of curry paste...we like it spicy!  (served with Thai chili sauce at the table, which everyone used to spice it up!)  i did not used veggies, but did add half a white onion, sliced thin.  served over Jasmine rice.  i almost never eat seconds, but i could not get enough of this.  EXCELLENT!

This is a great recipe that can easily be altered, depending on what ingredients you have on hand.  I didn't have any frozen veggies, so I added a can of baby corn and some fresh mushrooms along with the bell peppers.

Don't be scared of the amount of basil and fish sauce.  They balance out the dish very nicely.

This. Is. Fantastic. I simply added fresh snap peas and extra bell pepper in place of the mixed frozen vegetables, and increased the amount of curry paste. This is by far the meal of choice for my husband and I, and everyone else I have made it for has raved about it and asked for the recipe.

Awesome! I didn't have any fish sauce or bamboo shoots so I used 3 Tbsp mashed sardines and 3/4 cup sliced celery instead. I only used one 13.5 can of coconut milk rather than the full amount listed. This was so delicious, easy, and cost effective that I can't wait to make it for guest next. Thank you!

Delicious delicious delicious. I used waaayyyy more curry than it asked for. I think it provided more flavor as well. I didnt use bamboo shoots and I didnt use the lime juice that it asked for. I really enjoyed this recipe and next time I'll probably use fresh veggies as frozen veggies get mushy too fast and most thai cuisine uses fresh vegetables anyway. I thought this recipe tasted very authentic.

This is the easiest curry I've ever made! I used a red bell pepper, onion and 2 potatoes for my veggies. I let it all simmer until the potatoes were done. The longer it simmers the better the curry flavor will be.

I would recommend making this dish with lite coconut milk instead of regular coconut milk.  Two cups of regular coconut milk makes the dish very thick and heavy in both consistency and taste.  We used Thai Kitchen red curry paste, we doubled the quantity and it was still bland.  I need to look for a more authentic and spicier curry paste.  It called for too much fish sauce for our taste.

Good recipe but very mild.  I added potatoes instead of the frozen veggies cooking them slightly before adding them to the dish.  Don't be afraid of fish sauce.  It adds great flavor and won't overpower this dish...just make sure you don't smell it before you add it...it smells pretty gross. :-)

This has a really mild flavor as written and is pretty soupy. I think next time I'll cut down on the coconut milk by 1/2 of a cup and increase the curry paste by a teaspoon -- only a teaspoon since the lesser amount of coconut milk will increase the curry flavor. It's a good base recipe, though, and will work with a wide variety of fresh or frozen vegetables.

Very easy and super tasty. I used light coconut milk and added about a teaspoon more curry paste, and threw in a bag of frozen Asian stir fry vegetables on hand. The one thing I'd adjust the next time is to pull back on the fish sauce as it was too "fishy" for the kids - however a squeeze of fresh lime juice over the curry seemed to neutralize the "fishiness." We ate this with jasmine rice (super easy to make on the stovetop) and I had a beer with my meal. Going to brew a Vietnamese iced coffee with sweetened milk for my nightcap. Yum!

This was great! But...I changed it to what my family likes. I used shanghai bok choy and onion as the veg. I used 3 large cloves of garlic and about 1 tbs fresh grated ginger. I used about 3 tbs dark brown sugar, and regular basil that I had kicking around. I also had to use lemon instead of lime since I didn't plan ahead. Oh, and I just used 1 can of coconut milk and the moisture from the bok choy for the sauce. Anyways, it was delicious!

This recipe was so incredibly simple, and extremely delicious.  I added some rice flour to thicken the coconut milk.  Instead of frozen veggies, I added fresh broccoli and carrots.  The broccoli was perfect with this dish because it absorbed the sauce.  I will definitely make this again.  Even my little girl ate everything on her plate.

This is really good! I used a heaping tbsp of red curry paste and a dash of cayenne pepper and red pepper flakes to give it extra kick and did not add in the lime juice at the end. Other than those, stuck closely to the recipe. Delicious!! Definitely something that I will be making again. Thanks, Meghan for a great coconut chicken curry that did not disappoint!!

This is an amazing recipe, it tastes exactly like my husband's favorite dish from the local Thai restaurant. I did substitute honey from brown sugar and zucchini for bell pepper only because that's what I had on hand.  To add spice I added Thai peppers.  It was amazing.  Thank you for sharing!

My oldest child loves curry and other dishes so this is what I made for his 16th bday this year.  We added more chicken to it - 2 pds - and I was out of brown sugar so I used regular white sugar.  I also only used 1 can of the coconut milk and I added water chestnuts and I used the stir fry frozen veggies.  Overall a good recipe - it was well liked by my bday child and my husband.

I was really excited about this meal with all the rave reviews, but my husband and i actually thought it was kind of bland - i had made a few changes though to make it healthier which might have reduced flavor. I used low fat coconut milk, 1.5 tbsp fish sauce (the sodium in one tbsp is outrageous!) and lots of curry paste (and some sziracha) - will try a different curry next time

I was SO hungry and SO excited to try this recipe, I love Thai red curry chicken.  After reading the reviews, I only used 1 can of coconut milk instead of adding the extra amount from a second can, and I think that was a mistake.  I think the sauce would have been creamier if I had used the full amount the recipe called for.  It (the sauce) was very thin.  I also had to sub fresh organic basil from my garden for the Thai basil and we don't care for bamboo shoots or frozen mixed veggies so I subbed organic bok choi, organic onion, and organic purple and yellow peppers (all from our CSA, and all worked really well in the dish), and organic cremini mushrooms (which I wouldn't recommend).  All in all, the dish was good, yet disappointing.  It was very bland.  If I were to make it again, I would double the curry paste and the brown sugar.

We loved this.  I used one can of coconut milk and probably doubled the curry paste (I used maesri brand, and this was really spicy).  I left out the peppers because I hate them, but added a bag of stir fry veggies (broccoli, carrots, snap peas), a small onion, and some ginger.  I wish I'd had thai basil, but didn't have time to run to the asian market so I just used italian basil, which was still really good.  I can't wait to try it with thai basil though.  I cut the fish sauce down to 2 T based on the reviews and added 1 T of low sodium soy sauce.  I think though that 3 T would have been fine.  I think the quality of the fish sauce makes the difference - good fish sauce never seems too strong to me.

I gave this recipe 3 stars because of the modifications necessary to make it perfect.    1. less coconut milk - one can is more than enough 2. half the fish sauce  3. double or triple the curry  Other changes - couldn't find bamboo shoots so I used bean sprouts.   Use your favorite fresh and/or frozen veggies....as they make the meal.  I couldn't find fresh Thai Basil so I used dried Thai Basil.  Do not substitute for any other kind of Basil.  This is where most of your flavor comes from. The dried worked but I'm sure fresh would have been that much better.   This is a good base reciipe but it's not very tasty without the 3 changes above.

Easier to make than it looks, so  I was pleasantly surprised.  I let it reduce for a longer than the 15 minutes, because I wanted it to be thicker.

This dish was good, but was missing something. I used frozen asian vegetables (water chestnuts, broccoli, snow peas) and it was very good. But, I think the water from the frozen vegetables waters it down too much so next time I will use fresh and add mushrooms. Also, I added the vegetables in frozen (no need to thaw them). Only 1 TBSP of curry paste makes NO heat whatsoever, so if you like a hint of spice, add 2. I used 1 can of regular coconut milk, but might try 2 cans of reduced fat next time. The dish got better when some of the liquid evaporated. My family loved it (even my picky 7 year old!)

This is to die for. However i used one can coconut milk, added mushroom, onions, green and yellow pepper instead of froz veg..i added a 1/3c maple syrup and zest of 1 lime instead of lime juice..also thickened it a bit with corn starch. Served over broad rice noodles.  Omg! Yummm  will make again for sure

Loved it! It tastes almost exactly like the coconut curry I get at my fav restaurant - the restaurant makes it sweeter with more brown sugar, so I adjust accordingly. Thanks so much. It's also so much quicker than another Thai curry recipe from this site, that I can even make it on a week night.

The base flavor of this recipe is soo delicious. Next time I will add more heat, as I like spicy thai food. I'll also use only fresh veggies instead of the frozen ones. The frozen veggies were okay, but got too soft for my liking. I will definitely be making this again though.

If I could give this 6 stars+ I would.  It is by far the best recipe I've found on this site. One can of coconut milk is enough - use it all at once to cook the chicken. We like hot curry too but for this recipe 1 TBSP (of my brand anyway, Patak) was subtle enough. I then threw everything else in together.  I used interesting stir fry veggies(unthawed). I cooked everything just long enough for the frozen veggies to be hot but still crunchy which was ample time for the chicken. 3 TBSP of fish sauce is  necessary - don't be put off!  I used regular fresh basil leaves and it was fine.  We can't wait to have this again, and it was sooo easy.  Thank you Meghan.

Hubby liked it. If he had more curry even though he doubled the recipe amount would have possibly earned it five stars.

I prepared this dish using beef.  I did pre-cook the meat 3/4 of the way and set it aside.  It came out GREAT.  My family really enjoyed this dish which was a part of my "Thai Extravaganza" over the weekend.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.    PS:   Fish sauce smells awful!

Made this last night and my boyfriend and I loved it!  I didn't have frozen vegetables, but lightly steamed some broccoli before adding to the sauce.  I also added mushrooms and a bit extra red pepper and red curry.  Like others I reduced the coconut milk and only ended up using 1 can (about 1 1/2 cups).  Served over brown rice and added crushed red pepper.

Excellent!  As good as if not better than you'd get at a restaurant - tasted very authentic.  I agree with others that 1 can of coconut milk is plenty, and I substituted more fresh veggies instead of the frozen.  Big hit with the husband - will definitely be making it again!

My family, who doesn't love spicy food, really enjoyed this dish after a few minor tweaks.  I used yellow curry paste instead of red -- it has a sweeter flavor from onion & lemongrass, but still is flavorful.  Thai basil wasn't available so I used more readily available Genovese basil (this is the basil most non-specialty grocery stores carry in the fresh herb section).    Even with the fish sauce, the dish still needed some salt to enhance the flavor.    My husband simply added red pepper hot sauce to his bowl to get reach the spiciness he prefers and he liked every bite!  Beyond those minor changes the dish was delish and the kids asked if I'd make it again!

I agree with some others that there is to much coconut milk. Next time, instead of the 2 cups of coconut milk, I'll use chicken broth. I used mushrooms, spinach and bell peppers and other than being too sweet it worked well

Not our favorite.  I have another coconut curry recipe that we prefer.  I did like the frozen vegetables, typically I only use onions and garlic.  I used a frozen cauliflower/broccoli mix and it was a good addition.  Other than that the dish was bland and just okay.

I haven't always liked curry - until my husband made this dish. It is extremely flavorful and not too heavy. The amount of basil sounds like a lot, but it's not overpowering.

Brilliant! I'll make this again and again. I used lite coconut milk and it was still really creamy. Also, I did not have the fresh Thai basil, so I used the regular basil from my garden and it was still really great.

Thanks for this recipe!

Tastes like takeout!  The changes I made - I used two cans of coconut milk (light works fine), 1.5 times the amount of curry (I like spicy!), and about 1.5 cups of broccoli that I boiled for about 3 minutes and then drained.  I added the veggies too early, if you use fresh ones like me wait until the last 5 minutes of cooking, they get mushy fast. Overall, great recipe and I'll consider making this next time instead of ordering takeout!

I can't say this is a totally fair rating.  I didn't have all the coconut milk I needed, so I sub. chix broth and some water.  I don't know if more coconut milk would've made it thicker but it was more like soup so I added corn starch to make a "gravy".  I also didn't have red curry paste so I used my green.  I used snow peas and yellow bell pepper.  It had a good taste but not great.  We ended up adding peanut butter and chili sauce to our individual servings.  Maybe someone else will have better luck following the directions completely.  Thanks, it was interesting!

Love this recipe so much. Have made it a lot. You can use pretty much whatever veggies you want, except peppers are kind of a must. Only change I usually make is I always add some salt. Wouldn't recommend soy sauce because it is kind of watery to begin with.

I've tried many different curry recipes, and this by far is the best Kang Dang recipe. I've made it 3 times now, and the curry tastes just like from my favorite Thai restaurant. For those making it for the first time, I have some suggestions. The type and brand of coconut milk and red curry makes a HUGE difference.  They are not all created equal. The first time I made it, I used some off-brand regular coconut milk, and it turned out really thick. The second time, I used lite coconut milk, and it did not taste that great. The third time, I bought Choakoh coconut milk (metal brown can),  and it turned out perfect. Also, I used Mae Ploy red curry paste found at Asian stores. It is very spicy so use in moderation, but I still added about 3 tablespoons.  We like it hot. Thai basil is hard to find at regular grocery stores, so while you are at the Asian store getting the red curry paste, look for Thai basil. You cannot substitute with regular italian basil, completely different flavor profile. I didn't add any other vegetables besides bamboo and bell peppers. In order to prevent the vegetables from getting soggy, I added them to the curry at the last minute and turned off the heat.  Then I put a lid on the dish and let the veggies steam in the curry. Ready to eat with perfectly cooked al dente vegetables after about 10 minutes. This is a must try recipe if you love Thai red curry!!!! So easy and so yummy!!!

We really enjoyed this dish,  it was wonderful, but 2-1/2 cups of coconut milk was way too much and made the sauce too thin and watery.   The second time I made it I used one 13.5 oz can of coconut milk total.  Because it was so thin the first time, I added a pkg of Ben's  Ready Rice to the pan (instead of on the side) and that also helped soak up quite a bit of the juice , as an alternative to using less milk.  I also added about 10-15 drops of hot sauce to give it more of a "kick".

friends absolutely loved dish... Will for sure make again. Very quick and easy ...all while keeping quality and flavor excellent. Served with Jasmine rice.
Increased red curry paste ~3x (full small jar of paste), full 2 - 16 cans of coconut milk. During 1st of boiling 1/2 cup of coconut milk and mixing red curry pasted also added 5 fresh Thai Dragon hot peppers (stemmed and kept whole with slice down length wise) and then browned sliced chicken.
Vegetables- skipped bamboo and frozen vegetables ..... Instead used 3 fresh green peppers, 1 yellow onion, halfed and quartered 2 BIG beefeater tomatoes, used traditional small leaf Thai Basil (4 - 5 handfuls ..~3x original recipe). Kept same amount for fish sauce (3 tbs)  , brown sugar (1 tbs) and lime (2 tbs).

Quick and easy recipe to prepare. Also great to improvise. I had left over chicken that I cut up (about 1 1/2 cups).  I used leeks (2 med.), spring garlic (2 bulbs), 1 yellow squash, snap peas cut on diagonal 3/4 inch, broccoli flowerets (two stalks) and cilantro (didn't have Thai basil). I sauted all vegetables except the cilantro in a wok with canola and a little sesame oil. Saute the leeks and spring garlic before putting in the other vegetables. I also microwaved the broccoli  for 1 1/2 min. before putting in wok. Saute until vegetables still have some crunch. Follow the recipe from there. Delicious over thin rice noodles.

Super good! For my own personal taste, next time I will add a bit more of the curry paste and a little less lime, but over all had a great flavor. I also did as another person suggested and used steamed broccoli instead of frozen vegi's. Super yum! This is going in my recipe box for sure!

I just made this tonight & it's very fragrant and tasty. Next time I make it I will probably brown the chx pieces first, by themselves. I didn't use 2 cups of coconut milk, only about 1 1/2 cups total (light & regular). If you use all light c. milk it will be more on the runny side. Also, I didn't use mixed veggies- just frozen broccoli florets. I also used 2 tblspns of brown sugar, rather than 1. Overall, worth making & will make again!

This is pretty good.  I only had green curry paste & I didn't have the bamboo shoots or peppers, but I used a frozen stir-fry veggie mix & that worked well.  I also only used one can of coconut milk & that seemed to be enough.  I used dried basil, but it would be much better with fresh.  It had a slight kick to it.  I will make it again.

Almost identical to 'Thai Pineapple Chicken Curry' recipe from this site which i absolutely love.This one is just as good. I always use one can of coconut milk and find that to be plenty.I also like to thicken it up a bit by adding equal parts cornstarch/water.Delicious!

This was very good! I used only 2 tbsp. of fish sauce and cut the bell peppers because I don't like them but added mushrooms. Other than that, I did everything as suggested. Although, I felt like it was missing something....not sure what because I never cook thai food but it needed a little more flavor. I will use a little more thai curry paste next time and try to figure out what else it needs...but, the recipe is very good and very easy! Thanks!

This was not at all what I expected. I was thinking it was going to be on the sweeter side, but it was not even a little bit sweet. I also couldn't get past the 3 tablespoons of fish sauce in there. When I went to eat it I was completely grossed out thinking about the smell of the fish sauce. However, it did not taste BAD. I used all of the coconut milk that the recipe called for, and there was a LOT of sauce - using 1/2 cup less would probably have been better, as other users suggested. Also doubled the curry, and it was the perfect level of spicy - enough to make your tongue feel zippy, but not enough to make your nose run! I asked my boyfriend if he wanted me to save the leftovers, and he said no.

I loved it.  There is a great Thai place in town that I've been to that first turned me on to curries.  This tasted just like the Red Curry that they serve and it was very easy.  I probably will use a little more curry paste next time because it was pretty lightly spiced with the amount in the recipe.

I make a recipe that's nearly identical.  I use frozen green peas for the veggies and use a can of coconut milk.  That's too much fish sauce: don't forget, that stuff is fairly high in sodium!  This makes an easy and pretty authentic dish.

I've tried other chicken curry recipes and this is my favorite.  I used a bag of frozen vegetables that had squash, red bell peppers and onions. Next time I make it, I'm going to add more coconut milk and curry paste and less fish sauce.

This is a wonderful and authentic recipe, my husband and I loved it!
I followed the recipe pretty closely. I only used one can of coconut milk (which comes out to 2 cups) and half the curry paste.  However, when I make this again I will use the full amount of curry paste but 2 tblsp. of fish sauce is adequate.  Everything else is fine.
