great but... ** Vegetarians take note** most stuffing on supermarket shelves contains some form of vegetable fat or broth so it is not suitable for veg*ns. Other than that its a great recipe, try Morningstar or Lightlife  for unchicken variety! :)

I thoroughly enjoyed this recipe...instead of the FriChik...I used Quron's Fake Tenders...only because store was out of FriChik...also used the Stove Top Stuffing - Turkey flavored...I will never by the premade patties again...I let someone who swore they would never try vegetarian food taste...he could not believe it was "not Chicken"...

This is by far the best vegetarian meal I have ever eaten.  My husband doesn't usually care for vegetarian food but this is one he will actually make a request for.  It is so good.  My friends and family just love this.  I have not found one person who doesn't like it.  Thank you for this wonderful recipe.  Keep them coming.

This is a great recipe!  I am always looking for another way to serve FriChik and this by far was the best! The patties come out light and fluffy and the mix holds well in the fridge if you do not want to fry all the mix at the same time.

These were ok, but not as good as I hoped, and not worth the extra effort for "homemade" patties.  Leftovers sat in the fridge and went bad.  I won't bother to make again.

Wonderful flavor. I have a personal "rule" of cooking only one patty first to adjust recipe as needed. I forgot to do that this time and was sorry. I needed to use a little flour to help bind the mix together or the patties fell apart. My carnivore son even gave them a "not too bad".
