I’ve never had tomato basil soup at Applebee’s, but I can only hope that it’s as good as this.  The fresh herbs and marinara add layers of flavor, and the croutons (mine were garlic & butter) and freshly-grated parmesan are the perfect topping.  This soup has the bold and rich flavor that you get with homemade tomato soup when tomatoes are at their peak.  Do allow it to simmer the 15 mins listed in the directions, as the flavors do intensify.  Trust me, nobody will ever know that this soup wasn’t made from scratch (no need to tell them, either) because it doesn’t taste like you started with a can of tomato soup.  Honestly, the quality of this soup surprised me.  Thanks lainalee for sharing your recipe, this was a very nice lunch today.

Yummy just as written, VERY close to Applebee's!  I added a splash of heavy cream because, well, what can't be made better by adding heavy cream!?!

We really liked this soup and will definitely make again.  I also froze some for later meals and still tasted good.  I made it in a crockpot and allowed it to simmer on low for 2 hours.

So good.  Doubled the recipe for the two of us and used a spicy marinara sauce (Barilla).

Delicious! I used Amy's Organic cream of tomato soup for the base. It's not condensed, so I just used about 1/4 cup of water. I didn't sauté all the herbs and garlic, but used dried herbs from my garden last summer and garlic powder. It still turned out yummy! I agree with another reviewer that heavy cream would be great instead of water :)

This soup was amazing! Super simple and impressed my boyfriend who owns a restaurant. I served it with grilled cheese using freshly made sourdough and 3 year aged cheddar. Perfection!!

I love Applebee's tomato basil soup and just knew there had to be a good recipe online somewhere.  This is it!   This soup is SOOO delicious!   So far I've made 2 batches over the past month and doubled the recipe each time.  Didn't change a thing.  I used Barilla's marinara sauce--it's rich, tomatoey and delicious as is the soup when it's done.  Quick and so easy.  I want to freeze some but usually eat it all before I get around to freezing any.  If you love tomato basil soup at Applebee's, you'll love this recipe.

Very good!  I made a double recipe for three of us.  I used milk instead of water for richness.  Quick on a rainy, chill evening served with grilled cheese.

My husband liked this - a lot!
The recipe was  easy, tasty, and quick!
I did, however, add a pinch of sugar, and more basil, as my husband loves fresh basil.
I doubled the recipe, which was a perfect amount for the two of us.....we must use larger bowls!
Will make it again!!!

I made this for an event that I had my food truck at and it went over GREAT! I served it with grilled cheese made with mayo instead of butter and they all loved loved loved it!
