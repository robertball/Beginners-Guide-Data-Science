Absolutely fabulous recipe!  Taking into account others comments, here's some clarification:  Use 1 teaspoon of tobasco sauce, as you never can tell how much 10 drops are.  Add a good dash or three of Old Bay Seasoning and about 1/2 tsp of crushed red pepper.

Use Fillo frozen fully cooked pastry shells.

Used hubby as a ginea pig last night and he ate a whole sheet of these yummy morsels!  Excellent with a nice chilled white to compliment the creamy seafood taste.  My next party will be a hit.  And you can easily keep the simple ingredients for this recipe on hand to whip up in a moments notice to wow drop-in visitors!

Wow - Oh Wow !!  This are scrumptious.  I love crab so this one is a definite keeper!! I sprinkled the top with Old Bay seasoning instead of paprika.  This recipe wasn't as spicy as I thought it would be.  Make extra - because these are addictive.

I wish I could rate this with 10 stars!  This recipe is truly outstanding and pretty to serve as well.  Next time I think I will use more fresh shrimp and more hot sauce. I had plenty of filling and thus used three boxes of shells.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I made this last night with one major change. Instead of using mayonnaise I used 8 oz light cream cheese. I melted the cream cheese in a sauce pan, added 1 can of crabmeat, used 6 large fresh shrimp cooked in white wine then chopped. Added the fresh parmesean cheese, shredded Gruyere cheese, 2 to 3 Tbsp of cocktail sauce, old bay seasoning along with the worcestshire sauce and hot pepper sauce. Served some in the mine phyllo tarts and some of pumpernickle cocktail bread. Both were delicious!

I started this recipe 45 minutes before I was to appear at a party...and made it there on time!!!  It was EXTREMELY easy, delicious and fast.  The recipe states it uses 36 tart shells but I used 45 and had leftover filling.  Next time I think I will perk it up a little with the hot sauce or something.

I had some phyllo dough that needed to be used so I made my own tarts by using 4 buttered sheets of phyllo, layered on top of one another. I cut the layered sheet into 6 equal squares & tucked them into standard size  muffin tins that I had sprayed w/ Pam. I had a bit of trouble getting the first one out but then I let the others cool a bit before giving them a twist & popping them out w/ the aid of a knife. For the cheese filling, I did add Old Bay seasoning & additional hot sauce & worcestershire, as well as some dried parsley & thyme. Instead of sprinkling the top w/ paprika after baking, I sprinkled the top w/ dried parsley before baking. These were so good & so filling that my husband & I made our appetizer into our meal. All we did was add a salad.

Wonderful recipe!  Even my husband who has warned me on several occasions that he will die on the spot if he ever eats crab had several of these and he's still with us!  I did make a few changes.I used fresh shrimp and lots more hot sauce.  It's easy to taste and adjust along the way.  Thanks Mary Beth, this is a keeper

Wow, everyone loved this. It was so fast and easy in the pre-baked phyllo shells. I like spicy, so I added some ground red pepper and also Old Bay seasoning in addition to the hot sauce. I didn't have swiss cheese so I used white cheddar and it worked very well.

Not a big hit at my party.  They taste better when they are hot, but they are hard to keep hot.  And I just didn't think they tasted all that special.

Great recipe.  I don't use the shells and just put it all in a pie dish and bake and it comes out great.

Fabulous!  I did however make a few changes.  Instead of regular onion, I used thinly sliced green onion.  I also added a bit of ground red pepper to give it more of a kick.  Other than that, it was perfect.  Thank you for the incredible recipe!

Ridiculously easy.  I thought when I read the reviews.....Ya right, like I'm going to whip these up before the party.  Well, I did just that.  I got the frozen little pastry cups (3 pkgs), filled them while still in their plastic holder, put them all on a cookie sheet for transport, got to the party, placed them on the cookie sheet and BAM!  What a hit I was!!  I think using  fresh shrimp and Miracle whip really made this great.  A KEEPER!!

After reading other reviews, I changed the recipe slightly.  Instead of Mayonaise, I used Miracle Whip to add a little depth; also, I added a Tablespoon of Hot Sauce and a Tablespoon of Horseradish to give the recipe more heat.  It turned out perfect!  Thanks for a great basic recipe!

I baked three first to try them and then added more hot sauce and 3 ounces of cream cheese.  This made them taste much better, with more flavor.

I tried these for a Thanksgiving appetizer this year and they were so good, I've made them several times since to rave reviews everytime. Easy to prepare in advance and easy to heat up once cooked as well. 
Thanks for sharing!

I liked this recipe, but I tweaked it a bit. I used cream cheese instead of mayonnaise as 1 reviewer suggested. I also used Gruyerre cheese (hope I spelled that right) instead of swiss cheese. I used fresh shrimp and canned crabmeat. The crabmeat kind of gave it a fishy taste that i didn't like. So next time I may use all fresh shrimp or if i do add crabmeat it will have to be fresh. But this was a very good appetizer.

This was very good but there was something off about them.  I had to eat a few before I figured out what it was...the canned shrimp.  I'll never use canned shrimp again!!

Awesome recipe. Great for entertaining because they are so easy to make and they look pretty. I modified the recipe by adding 4 oz. of cream cheese and reducing the mayo to 1 cup. I also used only 1 cup of cheddar instead of the other cheeses and I used green onions to give it more color. I also used 3/4 lb.fresh salad shrimp instead of the canned seafood. Don't be afraid to go 15 drops on the tobasco, it still had a great taste and wasn't too spicy. Everyone at our party loved these and they were the first things to go.

Outstanding recipe.  It was a hit at my Christmas Eve get together.  Even my friend who is comparable to a chef requested the recipe.  Not one for canned seafood, I used fresh shrimp and imitation crabmeat (a first for me but small portions of crab unavailable).  I also used the pre-made phyllo shells.  Excellent!

The first time I tried these WONDERFUL appetizers I almost ate them all at a friends get together. Everyone including myself raved at how delicious they were. On Valentines Day I went ahead and made them for my husband. He kept asking me for the recipe but I wouldn't tell. He wants me to make them again!!!!

These were the tastiest little crabby gems. Made them for hubby to take to boys' night, but I could not stop popping them. I did buy 3 packages of the phyllo dough and had enough filling with the recipe to use all of it. Will most definitely make again!

This was a hit! I did follow other's suggestions and added Old Bay and crushed pepper chips. I made these along with the Spinach Phyllo cups from this site and they made a pretty presentation together. I made both fillings in the morning (could probably make a day ahead as well)and filled the cups just before guests arrived. Hot and ready when they arrived!

I made these appetizers for New Years and they were a hit (at least with the seafood lovers in the crowd).  Very Easy to make!  I bought 3 boxes of Phyllo Shells and still had extra filling which I used on crackers then.  I will most certainly make this yummy treat again.

These sounded really good, but I was disappointed.  I wish the recipe submitter would list the manufacturer of the "shells" and if they are frozen, etc.  I couldn't find any phyllo shells so I cut Pepperidge Farm pastry sheets into squares.  They puffed up well and looked nice but they took about 35 mins to cook.  The filling was too fishy tasting for me.  If I made these again I would get fresh crab meat and shrimp to cut down on that.

Thank you Mary Beth..I am always looking for new appetizers, my family and friends love when I make several, and this one is a keeper.  I've made it three times since Christmas and everyone LOVES it. I do use a handful of fresh cooked shrimp cut into small pieces instead of the canned, since this reciepe deserves the best ingredients!  The last time I made it I didn't have the shells to bake them in so I poured it into a small corningware baking dish and baked it at 375 for about 15 minutes, until it was browned and bubbly and served with chips. Yum, Yum,Yum! Thanks for sharing!

I love this recipe! It is the best, the easiest and the most impressive looking appie I've ever made. I had a non-onion eater in my group so I substitued finely chopped celery for the onions and this worked fine. (I'm sure the onion version would be even better.)I used about 10 drops of Louisian Hot Sauce and still barely felt a kick so next time I may add cayenne or garnish with cayenne. 

I had extra filling so put it in a small dish with a knife and crackers and it disappeared!

These were scrumptious!  I made them the first time for an appetizer cook-off -- and won first place!!  The only thing I did differently was to add onion salt in place of onion.  The second time I made this, I used both swiss and sharp cheddar cheese.

Awesome!  Not as spicy as I thought they'd be.  Next time I will add extra hot sauce or something.  I used 2 packages of the phyllo shells and had left over shrimp mixture. Later that night, after all the appetizers were gone we baked the left over mixture for about 20 minutes and finished it off with crackers.  It was just as good that way.  I used frozen salad shrimp instead of cannned.

Quite good - got rave reviews at Super Bowl party.  Giving 4 stars because, as many other reviewers noted, some tweaks can make this recipe better.

I usually follow a first time recipe as written which I did with this one.  It was really tasty and rich but I tend to agree with other reviewers who said it was a little too mayonnaise-y.  I used canned shrimp and canned crab meat and had no problem with that at all.  I also used prepared phyllo mini tarts as the recipe noted. I live in a major market and found these in my local grocery store but they may not be available everywhere.

Lastly, I definitely would kick it up a notch with more hot sauce and red pepper flakes. Personal preference.  Overall, very good and with some minor changes..a 5-star recipe!  Thanks for sharing.

These were a big hit.  I used puff pastry in cupcake tins.  Switched 4oz of light cream cheese plus approx.3/4 c of mayo for the mayo.  added a sprinkle of red pepper flakes and switched and used approx. 4 tsp of chipotle hot sauce.

These were great!  Didn't change anything in the recipe, however, I served them in little phyllo shells and sprinkled Old Bay on top instead of paprika.  They were a huge hit on our Easter buffet.

These tasty treats were really good.  I followed other's suggestion using some Old Bay Seasoning and crushed red pepper.  Be sure to use fresh crabmeat and shrimp, not canned.  It makes a nice presentation to any buffet.

I used primarily crab meat and add to the recipe about 20 drops hot jalapeño sauce and Old Bay Seasoning.  I only used about 1/4 cup of mini shrimp, chopped very fine.  Also used green onions rather that regular onions.    Also, I used won ton squares (bake at 325 for 7 minutes) instead of phyllo tart shells which I stuffed last minute so they wouldn't get soggy.  Was a great hit and had a great kick to it.

I made this for New Years Eve.  They looked very pretty on the platter( I garnished them with cut up chives).  But I thought they needed something.  I followed the recipe, the only thing I replaced was green onion instead of regular onions.  I will make these again, but I have to play around with the flavors.

These were okay.  I made them for a party and I bought a bunch of the phyllo cups to fill with different mixtures.  These seemed to be the least popular.  I think if I made them again I would leave out the shrimp.  I think they would have been better with just the crab.

I am giving it three stars which in this case was high, but I feel terrible giving it anything lower since I didn't follow the recipe exactly.  I was out of phyllo dough when I decided to make for the Super Bowl yesterday so I used ready made pie crusts.  Everything else was exact except I did add some garlic powder and used fresh seafood.   My husband took one bite and that was enough, I took a bite of the rest and it was enough for me too.  Sorry Mary Beth!!!!

These were pretty good, though my husband liked them more than me. Despite adding way more hot sauce than the recipe called for, I still didn't think they were especially spicy. I used half-and-half and an egg instead of the mayonnaise. Also, the crab meat seemed to disappear into the cheese/cream filling, so I would probably use imitation crab meat next time to improve the texture of the filling while retaining the flavor. Finally, I thought the pastry shells were pretty expensive. I would use a regular pie crust shell next time.

This is a great appetizer recipe.  I've mainly used this as a filling for the mini phyllo tarts, but recently I wasn't able to get the tarts so I baked it in a pie plate and served it as a hot dip/spread with melba toast rounds. Great this way, too!  I use crushed red pepper instead of hot sauce to spice it up a bit and usually use fresh shrimp instead of canned.  This is always a hit at parties, and many people have asked for the recipe.  Thanks,Mary Beth.

This was a huge hit. I doctored it a bit adding additional hot sauce and less mayo. My friends loved it. We had some leftover filling that I put onto sourdough baguettes and toasted the following day. That was delish as well.

Delicious! I followed the recommendation of another review and cut sheets of phyllo into 6 squares, then baked the filled cups in regular-size muffin tins. The only change I made to the filling was to sub cheddar for the swiss, as I don't like swiss at all. This made 12 large shells, so I froze the leftovers for another time. Thanks for the recipe!

Loved this recipe!  I did a little tweaking to it, such as using frozen shrimp, chopped up and imitation crab rather than using stunfortunately from cans. I also used wonton wrappers because I couldn't find phyllo dough. I have made them on two different occasion and they were a hit! I will definitely be making them again!

These weren't spicy. I would add some extra heat if you like spicy. To me the mayo was over bearing. I will decrease it next time. All in all very good, just very rich. Can't eat to many at once.
