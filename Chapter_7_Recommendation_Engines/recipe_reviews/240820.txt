I'm sorry, but this did not work for me. I tried making them twice in case I messed up the first time (first time I used coconut creamer instead afterof coconut milk).  But both attempts failed. The cupcakes looked nice after 20 min in oven but they would NOT set. Kept them in oven a little longer, but only the top and sides would bake, insides were still gooey batter.  Since they were not baking I continued to leave them in oven, and after 45 min they were brown (but would not burn!) and STILL very gooey in the middle.  I bake a lot so I know it was not the oven's fault.
