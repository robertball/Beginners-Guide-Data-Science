I left the cream & gin out & it was very good. The spices really make it.

WE love this recipe.  Made it 5 times now.  It's my boyfriends favorite "show off" dish.  He gets to grill the steaks and I pull out hte mortar and pestil to grind away.  The first few times we couldn;t find juniper berries so we doubled the all spice and I added a few cloves.  We found the Juniper at our local organic store and can't wait to do it up right.

Not a big hit here. Too much allspice, in fact I would leave it out. Also needs a bit of sugar. probably won't make this again.
