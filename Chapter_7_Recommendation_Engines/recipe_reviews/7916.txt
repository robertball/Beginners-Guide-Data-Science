Instead of poking holes in the cake, I poured the glaze into the Bundt pan and merely reinserted the cake into the pan allowing it to absorb all of the glaze. Took about an hour to do so.

I have to say I have been using this recipe for two years and have gained some noteriety for it. Whenever there is a bake sale or picnic I am asked to bring the rum cake. In fact it fetched $130 at a cake auction ! The glaze is the trickiest part but just keep sttirring and it will thicken. The nuts at the bottom of the cake become soaked with the glaze and many people have told me that is their favorite part. If you like rum- you will LOVE this cake ! YOu can always cut back on the rum in the glaze a bit if you don't like a real strong rum taste. Most of the rum cooks off though, so don't worry about getting drunk by eating this cak.

This recipe is the best after trying several others. I took not of others suggestions and left the cake in the pan to pour the glaze over and let it soak into the cake. I also used fewer pecans than called for and added about a 1/4 cup brown sugar in the bottom of the pan before pouring the batter in. Finally, do not let the glaze cook too long. It will burn and/or turn to sticky candy. 5 minutes is sufficient on med/high heat! You can not beat this recipe!

This recipe was "the bomb"(meaning great).  I followed it exactly to the "tee" and it came out perfect.  It looks like a lot of people had trouble with the glaze however, it will come out great but you must dissolve the water and sugar first then add the butter. I split the sugar half brown, half regular and added a teaspoon of vanilla.  This cake had a lot of compliments...whew lord, I have a dinner date tonight and I am baking one to take along. I am sure that I will get my man.

I have been making almost the same exact recipe for years.  It was given to me by my grandmother.  The secret to this cake is the type of rum you use and the glaze.  I only use Bacardi Anos rum.  It gives the cake a much richer flavor.  You should start cooking the glaze about 10 minutes before the cake is done.  I combine 1 cup sugar, 1 stick of real butter, 1/4 cup rum & 1/4 cup water.  Cook it for exactly 3 minutes.  Pull the cake out of the oven, and pour the warm glaze right over the cake while it's still in the bundt pan.  Make sure the glaze gets down in the middle of the cake near the hole.  Use a knife if you have to loosen the cake up a bit in that area.  Let the cake sit 30 minutes so the glaze makes it's way down.  At 30 minutes flip it over on the plate.  You will see that the glaze has covered the top and been aborbed.  Once the cake sits awhile, the glaze will become slightly crunchy.  This cake is suppose to be VERY dense and moist and I have never ONCE had anyone say it tastes like it comes from a box.  I only use Dunkin Hines Butter Recipe yellow cake mix.

Thanks Laura for sharing your Mom's very tasty rum cake!  I mistakenly added the rum glaze to the bottom of the cake instead of the top.  When I turned the cake upright onto a platter, I realized my mistake. I felt I should redeem myself by making more glaze for the top of the cake or no one would be able to taste the rum.  Well, obviously doubling the glaze is not necessarily a bad thing, because I had more compliments on that cake than any other I've ever made!  Several friends asked if they could take a slice home.  I refrigerated my leftover slice and had it the next morning with my coffee.  YUM!  I liked it even better when it was cold. Yes, I'll be making this one again.

I used the glaze recipe from this one, as I had already made a yellow cake from scratch.  YUM, was this wonderful!!!  I reduced the amount of glaze that I allowed to absorb into the cake, and with the glaze I reserved, I spooned onto individual servings of the cake.  It was fantastic and I will definitely be making this again :)

This is such a wonderful Rum Cake!  Seriously, it rose 50% more than others that I've tried.  I took the advice of another reader and poured the glaze into the tube pan and returned the semi-cooled cake to that same pan.  What a great method and all of that delicious rum glaze was absorbed by the cake.   FANTASTIC!

I dont usally go through the trouble and time for reviews but everyone needs too try this one. I actually received the receipe from a girl at work whos grandma makes it all the time. I to wasnt sure about the glaze. That is why I looked it up here. Did I add to much water? It seemed to make to much and I was worried about it becoming soggy so I added only half. Now that I have the official receipe I will make it accordngly. Once again this is the best cake we have tried so far.

A good gift for a hostess or to take to a dinner!  However, the recipe is incorrect as written.  This is the Bacardi Rum Cake recipe word for word except they are using the wrong amount of butter which is why it's too thin.  It's 8 TBS (1 stick) of butter in the glaze, not 3 TBS.  Also, just pour the glaze over the cake while it is still in the pan and it will soak into the cake in 5 mins.  Invert onto a cake plate and it's done.

I tried to find faults with this cake since it was so easy, but no luck.  I used 70 proof spiced rum which kept the alcohol from being overpowering, and added a aromatic Caribbean flavor to the cake.  Rum=Good, Cake=Good, This Rum Cake=The Best!

Good recipie, however, the glaze instructions were a bit unclear.  If you cook the glaze too long, you get candy! Also, the instructions don't tell you that the cake get 1/2 cup water and the glaze 1/4.  It also says the nuts should be on the top, however, the bottom of the Bundt pan (where the nuts are) is the top. These seemingly minor details tend to cause trouble for the novice cook! You also can add the rum to the glaze while it's reducing to cut the alcohol. Excellent recipe!

This cake is very moist and delicious.  I substituted lemon cake mix for the yellow cake mix.  For the glaze, I ran out of rum so, I used 1/4 of rum and 1/4 cup of orange juice, it turned out great!

Born, raised and living in the US Virgin Islands, the rum cake is a big part of our culture.  I was quite skeptical about this recipe.  It just seemed too easy and simple. I made this yesterday and it is AWESOME!  Tastes exactly like the ones I'm used too!  I did add a half tsp of rum extract for extra flavor-wow!  The glaze...well it was not a glaze. The sugar crystalized when I added the rum so it was thick and crumbly and the cake did not absorb most of it and still the cake was great.  Next time I will add more butter and melt the sugar in it 1st and then add the water and lastly the rum.  I think that should do it.  This cake gets a 5 star from me!!

I have been making this during the holidays for 20 years both for gifts and as a family favorite.  Yellow cake mix with pudding already in the mix works just as well as the two separate parts.  Usually I use Capt Morgan's rum, but have substituted Bacardi silver or gold. Either way, it's tasty.

I bought 1.5 oz pudding mixes because I didn't have this recipe on me to know what size so I just bought a bunch of the small ones.  So I used two small packages of pudding (3 oz total) and even that was WAY too much.  The batter is So thick!  I was making a bunch of mini Rum Cakes so I wasn't planning on turning them upside down.  Now I have to because the batter was so thick that the tops are  ugly.  No word on the taste yet.  I'm sure they'll taste fine.  But presentation was key for me this time because I was planning on giving them to co-workers as gifts for Christmas.  LESS PUDDING!  I'd make more with less pudding but "The Rum's Gone!"  

Planning on maybe cutting off the tops and turning them upside down?  But I don't have pretty paper plates to give them out on... I'll figure something out.

As a non-alcoholic drinker (I am allergic) I thought the rum was too strong, but got raves that the quantity of rum was 'just right.' Leftover cake was cut up in equal pieces for guests to take home. As for the glaze, I believe I found the solution. Initially, it's very runny, but if you remove the glaze from the stove for about 20 mins, it will thicken to a manageable consistency. I followed others in inverting the cake pouring the rum glaze over it, then let it sit 30 minutes and then flipped it over, and glazed the top, dusting with powdered sugar. I used a decorative mold and the cake turned out beautifully. Just be sure you spray the mold with cooking oil first, or the cake will stick.

WOW what A cake! I used spiced rum and it added quite a bit of flavor!  I used the spiced rum in the glaze as well and poked several hole so the glaze completely soaked in. I had served this at a holiday party and it was definitely the hit of the party!

Very good base cake recipe. I was skeptical at first because the batter is very thick and I thought the cake would come out thick and dry, but it did not. The cake is very moist and light. 

And instead of 1/2 cup of spiced rum, I used 1 cup of spiced rum. The cake has more kick and you can smell the rum, and really taste the rum flavor. I placed sliced almonds in the bottom of the pan instead of pecans. 

The glaze is the weakest link of this recipe. It is too watery. Instead I used West Indian Cream Rum Liqueur (like Bailey's) and I added the sugar and butter, and sliced almonds to thicken up the glaze and then I let it cool. I it added after I took the cake out of the pan and let it cool.

Best Rum cake recipe out there. This is so moist. At first i thought it called for too much rum but after tasting it, it was perfect to say the least. Everyone raved about it. The pecans really add the flavor too. I followed the recipe in detail & didn't change one thing. Just can't say enough. Wish i could rate it 10 stars!!

This is a wonderfully delicious cake. My daughter makes this cake. She began making it at 16 years old. She is 18 now. She has received orders for this cake from several of my coworkers. My daughter has discovered that the cake has the best flavor and moisture when you USE PILLSBURY CAKE MIX and Myers's Original Dark 100% Fine Jamaican Rum.

This is a great recipe for sure!  I still have a problem with the glaze.  My husband's grandmother made this cake (same recipe) but her glaze hardened on the cake and it was DELICIOUS!!  I can't get my glaze to harden.  I follow the glaze directions to a T....any suggestions?

I do love this cake recipe and have finally mastered the glaze!  Like others have mentioned, you have to get it to a boil before you pour on cake.  I usually boil for 5 minutes and it comes out fantastic!

This is the same recipe my mom has been making for years. Perfect in every way. I added 3/4 cup of Rum to the glaze mix and depending on your oven, baking time may be shorter than 1 hour. Perfect and moist to the last piece and easily freezable.

Very moist and good! I think I would add more rum in the batter next time.

This cake was easy and delicious. I've been holding on to it for a couple of years but decided to channel my inner Julia and make it. I used a pineapple cake mix because every knows you can't go wrong with pineapple and rum.

Not to detract from the person who posted because my family has always thought of this as 'my' rum cake recipe too, but I got this exact recipe from a friend years ago and she said she originally got in from a Bacardi bottle.  It IS the best Rum Cake ever and we too have enjoyed it for years.  I always sprinkle the top with a little powdered sugar letting it fall over sides like 'snow', then I put 4-6 cherries on top using toothpicks and it makes a nice presentation.

Made this and it didn't turn out so great. Tasted like yellow cake mix with rum. Oh wait, that's what it is.

I made this cake during the holidays. After "sampling" several pieces I took the rest in to work, and it was gone within 5 minutes! A woman there who is "known" for her rum cake emailed me to tell me that she thought this was better than hers! I like having a lot of glaze, so I doubled the glaze recipe and spooned it over the individual slices on the second day when I took it to work. YUMMY!

It's good enough for cake from a box but I don't understand all the reviews calling it awesome.  The rum in the mix isn't strong enough to really flavor the cake leaving all the rum taste concentrated in the glaze.

I made this for Super Bowl Sunday and it was a huge hit.  The only thing I did differently was I let the cake cool in the pan while a made a batch of glaze.  I poked some holes in the cake and poured half the glaze on it.  After it soaked in, I turned the cake onto a pan, poked holes in the top and poured the rest of the glaze over it.  At that point I decided to make another batch of glaze, poured half of it into the pan, reinserted the cake and poured the other half over the cake.  This way the glaze soaked through the cake evenly.  I will be making this again............soon.  :-)

Really good-followed directions exactly. Thought I did something wrong when I added the rum to the glaze because it got so thin but poured into bottome of bundt pan like others and put cake back in to soak.  The top was strong but good!!

moist and wonderful cake, as good as you get when down in the Carribean.  But instead of 3 Tablespoons of butter in the glaze, try 8 Tablespoons of butter!  (With 3 T. of butter in the glaze, it would cristilize!)

Great recipe! although the glaze was a bit difficult to make, so I would def. opt out from that the next time around. It definitely tasted like a rum cake and it wasn't too sweet or too strong, just right! the cake was moist yet took longer to bake than expected.

I've made this rum cake (without pecans though) at least 10 times. It's absolutely wonderful, my family goes crazy over it. I've experimented with different liquors as well (lemoncello with lemon cake mix and baily's irish cream with chocolate cake mix), it turned out great. Still, rum cake rocks! Thank you for sharing it.

I made this in a 13 x 9 pan, dusted it with powdered sugar and took it to my church council meeting.  It got rave reviews.  The little bit that was left over went to work the next day, and was gone in a heartbeat.  Delicious (and easy to make)

Cake is by far everyone's favorite. I have been making it for over a year now and finally thought I should chime in. I too had much problems with the glaze getting runny as soon as you add the rum. Many reviews suggested putting the cake back into the pan and pouring the glaze over it and letting that soak in for an hour. Well it worked! I finally have a cake with a nice hard glaze on the outside just like my MIL always made it. Thank you all so much for you reviews!

I made this for the first time and brought it to a New Year's Eve party.  I didn't have any dark rum so I used the coconut rum I had on hand.  It was absolutely fabulous!  I brought Cool 
Whip to serve with it, but no one wanted it as it was great by itself!  Thank you for sharing the recipe.  It's definitely a keeper.

This is a great & tasty rum cake recipe. BUT it isn't an original! This is the EXACT same recipe that's on the back of the Bacardi rum bottle and in their cookbook. It's been around for years! And I have been making it for years. So this is basically Bacardi's rum cake recipe with another name attached!

This rum cake came out just wonderfully.  It was my first rum cake, made while hosting my first holiday, so I was more than a little nervous. I attempted the glaze 3 times, and each time I ruined it. It must either be a very fine art, or I'm a clutz, though  my boyfriend couldn't do it either. We were so worried about the warning that it might make the cake mushy if not done right, so we abandoned the glaze and simply topped the cake with powdered sugar, and it was so rich and perfect I can't imagine it being any better! We used a bundt pan instead of a tub pan, and it was a big hit!

I have long been in search for the perfect rum cake recipe, similar to the one my great aunt used to make when i was little. This one was it. It was so good and moist. I shared half with some neigbors, they called that very night to get the recipe. I will definately make this one again. Thank you so much for submitting this recipe!

This disappeared when I made it for our Friday night dinner at our American Legion post.  Even though I didn't try it (had already had enough sweets yesterday), it looked tasty and I'll be making it again.  I used what was left of our Bacardi rum.  Since I was making it to go with dinner, I used a 13 x 9 pan instead of the called-for Bundt pan, figuring it might go further, be easier to slice, too.  And I substituted walnuts for the pecans.  I had a little trouble getting the glaze to thicken, especially after adding the rum, even though I cooked it for the recommended 5 minutes.  It didn't seem to be thick enough so I put it back on the heat for a couple minutes, then went ahead and spooned it over the cake, which I left in the pan, after poking holes in it with my metal cake tester.  Also used half brown sugar and half white for the glaze.  Will definitely be making this again so my husband & I can try it.  Thanks, Laura, for sharing.

I made this cake some time ago but just now getting around to making my review. This cake was delicious. My mom used to make it and when I came across this recipe I had to bake it for myself. I followed the easy steps to the tee with and exception on the glaze. I made the recommended amount of glaze however I did not pour all of it on my cake for fear that it would be soggy. I did pour about half on but I recommend pouring all of the glaze on the cake. I did have the rum taste (I used a dark Jamaican rum) but it was a very light. Next time I will use all of the glaze. Thanks for the recipe.

I decided to use spiced rum, added coconut to the pecan topping and cinnamon to the glaze- the cake came out absolutely beautiful, fragrant and I sprinkled the fresh glaze with a little more coconut . My wife and mother in law took pictures before it went home as a gift to my MIL . This recipe is a definite repeat !

Recipe itself is very good -. I messed up on the glaze & cooked it too long so it got really thick. Also only used 1/4 cup of rum in glaze as I did not want it to turn out too strong. You can taste/smell the rum in the cake so that turned out well. First time baking Rum Cake - will definitely try this again & hopefully get a better result. Thanks for sharing.

Loved this! Had several people tell me that it was one of the best cakes they had ever eaten. I left out the pecans though.

I followed the recipe to the T.  The cake turned out very moist and was very pretty.  I found the vanilla to be dominant flavor w/ a hint of rum.  The glaze was very nice.  Thank you for the recipe.

I got excellent compliments on this cake!! It came out so pretty too.  I did do one thing different and used powdered sugar and 8 tbls of butter.  I also added a little vanilla in the cake mix and cut the rum a little in the glaze.

This is a wonderful recipe.  As a variation, I use Limoncello liqueur instead of rum in the cake and the glaze and add 1/3 cup lemon juice to the cake portion.  It's a real hit at home and at work!

wonderful! delicious! couldn't wait 1 day to let "soak". can't wait to taste after it's been sitting for 1 day. only 1 suggestion: where it calls for white sugar, it should say powdered sugar. didn't work well with regular sugar.

Hubby gave this a 5.  I didn't have dark rum but will get some for next time.  I think our rum was old.  He couldn't stop eating it.  I poked holes after taking out of over and cooling a bit. Doubled sauce, poured in holes (no longer than 15 minutes-it can get hard) flipped it on a cake pan - and brushed remaining sauce over cake letting it dry between layers.  He says I need to make this very often. Thank you!!

This is the perfect Rum cake recipe! I've made 2 in less than 5 days and will be making another tomorrow for my husband who can not stop eating it. The only thing I changed was, I added a few pecans in the batter and the glaze.

Good cake ... liked the heavy moist texture.  My glaze worked well ... cooked it till it thickened to almost a paste, but, sure enough, the minute I added the rum, it was total liquid.  I let it sit for about 5 minutes, which allowed it to thicken a little, and then poured very slowly over the cake.  As it cooled, used a pastry brush several times to brush the glaze over the cake, and it was perfect.  Left it covered in a very cold garage for 24 hours to "age", and then served for an adult pirate party ... while most of us aren't rum drinkers, we all enjoyed this cake!

I remember my mother making rum cakes when I was young and I am pretty sure that this is the recipe she used.  I lifted the cake a bit and poured some of the glaze into the bottom of the pan and then reinserted the cake.  I also took a thin wooden skewer and made holes in the top of the cake so the glaze could seep in.  I loved the flavor of the rum, but the finished product still tasted like a boxed cake mix to me.  I think the glaze would be fabulous on a good homemade yellow cake such as David’s Yellow Cake, one of my favorite cakes from this site.

I substituted yellow cake for golden vanilla and used white chocolate pudding mix... mmmmm... this was good. Only complaint I got was "more rum please!" Next time I'll use 1 1/2 cups or 2 cups and a little more glaze.

was very dry; not like Mary Nortons.  She used more butter, maybe 1/2 cup (1stick)in the syrup. Mary's cake had a plate full of syrup after it was turned over.

This rum cake is spectacular the only difference is that for the glaze I split the white sugar with an equal part of brown sugar and added a tsp of vanilla to make it richer.

The cake turned out delicious - very moist. There must be a real trick to this glaze. I tried making it two times and each time I ended up with sugar candy crystals. Next time to make I plan to try previous suggestion by pouring glaze in bottom of cake pan and placing the cake back into bundt pan to soak up the glaze. Great idea!

This was an easy recipe. I used a 10" bundt pan. I also put brown sugar on bottom with the pecans. However, mine stuck to the bottom.Next time, I will use parchment paper and regular tube pan. I also used coconut pudding instead of vanilla. Great recipe. No one could believe it was from a cake mix.

Not only is this recipe super easy and very good, it must be nearly foolproof!  I had no tube pan, but it puffed up fine in my shallow cake pan and in cupcake tins.  I coconut pudding instead of the vanilla; it makes a colada flavor.  I couldn't even make the glaze, and wound up just adding some rum to a butter cream icing, and it's *still* terrific- and easy enough to be a regular recipe.

Absolutely delicious!  Easy to make.  I followed the instructions exactly. Baked for less than 60 minutes due to our altitude (6200 ft).    Cooked glaze for 3 minutes as previously recommended.  Did the hole-poking, then spooned on the glaze.  Used Bacardi 
rum.  It is a fabulous cake.  Thank you for sharing.

The best rum cake I have ever made, the whole family loved it! I did have a problem with the brown sugar/  rum mixture hardening though. I added more rum and butter to make it a smooth consistency again. This is our new favorite!

I looooove this recipe.  I enjoy cooking but sometimes like to take out a little guesswork and no one would EVER suspect that you used things from boxes anyway.  I wanted to give y'all my little secret not for better necessarily but for DIFFERENT! I like to use malibu rum in pineapple or coconut flavor because it adds a touch of the fruitiness and everyone has a preference! People always request one or the other for the birthday etc.

Absolutely delish!! The only thing I changed was I used vanilla rum and coconut rum. I took it to work and it disappeared quickly.

This cake is FABULOUS.  I DO NOT agree with the other review suggestions that you should pour the glaze into the pan and reinsert the cake.  This leaves the top scrumptious and the bottom plain and boring.  It probably would be easier to leave the cake in the pan, POKE HOLES, and pour over the bottom of the cake, but I don't think this would leave the top very "glazy" or pretty for presentation's sake.  I think it's best just to stick with the glaze application as indicated in the recipe!

Great cake, I just got back from Jamaica and was desperate for a rum cake. This worked great, everyone loves it!  I sprinkled the bottom of the bundt pan with pecans and flaked coconut. Poured in the batter. I inverted it on a fancy cake plate and spooned on the glaze. I added the rum before cooking the glaze. It didn't thicken at all - no matter how long I cooked it, but it seems to crystallize nicely when its on the cake.  Its good out of the oven or the next day.

Come out beautifully.  I have trouble draining the glaze into the cake (I use toothpick to poke holes, maybe I need to make larger holes).  I wonder if I can use other liquors besides rum to make it taste more alcoholic?

The cake itself is very  easy. The glaze I had a little trouble with but I know what I did wrong and will definately correct it next time. I have a habit of experimenting with recipes until I get it perfect. My husband will not object to my experimenting with this one as he loved the cake itself. Thank you so much.

SO MOIST! this cake never gets dried out, it's so moist and delicious, altho i did find that the glaze with the rum needs quite a while to soak in and mellow out, otherwise it tastes very alcoholy. i would even suggest putting no rum in the glaze but puttin a little more in the cake (less water). GREAT RECIPE ive been making some for all my neighbors

This is the same recipe for rum cake in the Cake Mix Doctor cook book, although the CMD calls for Bacardi dark rum (I use Myers).  I have made it a few times now, and it is very good.  This recipe calls for 1/2 cup more rum in the glaze than in the cook book version, so not sure if more is better or not.  I'm sure either way, it will be a hit for you!

The cake is excellent, but 3 stars because of the glaze problem.  It didn't seem to be thick after 5 minutes of boiling so I boiled a little longer and then had the same problem that others have had with it turning to liquid when adding rum.  I used the liquid in a powdered sugar icing and drizzled it over the top.  Not as pretty as a glaze would have been, but tasted fine.

First time making rum cake and the cake itself turned out delicious and made my house smell heavenly!  However, I "goofed" on the glaze.  I thought I had it thick enough but when I poured the rum in, it liquified so I substituted with powdered sugar  :o(  Someone feel free to explain my error here...

WOW!  I made this for a friend's birthday.  It was all I could do to keep from eating it when I got it out of the oven!!  Oh my gosh, heavenly!  Usually when I try recipes from the web I am disappointed, but NOT with this one!  I did reduce the rum in the glaze to 1/3 cup to make it more buttery tasting and not such a strong alcohol taste.  This is a REAL KEEPER!!!

This cake is awesome! As for the glaze--I couldn't master it so I took some confectioner's sugar and stirred it together with a little rum & water and drizzled it over the top. Just as good. I had three pieces before the day was over. Thanks for a great recipe!

I used French Vanilla instant pudding and reduced the rum in the glaze to half.  I had a problem with the glaze too - I must have boiled it too long because it crystallized when I added the rum.  I whisked together as much as I could then strained the glaze and it was very tasty.  We'll make again.

I had a problem with the glaze.  I cooked it until very thick, but it thinned to almost like water when I added the rum.  I let it cool a bit before I put it over the cake.  I used a hint that I read about pouring part of the glaze in the pan and putting the cake back in the pan to soak up the glaze.  I ened up with the pecans on top and I spooned the rest of the glaze over it.  No matter what, it was a big hit......everyone loved it!

I had trouble figuring out if the glaze was actually done--it seemed to take awhile. Then it seemed like there was too much so I only poured half on cake to prevent sogginess. The cake was very good and very moist.

This was very delicious.  Guests won't know it is a box cake!  My family, including cousins from Italy, all loved it.  It was very easy to make.  The glaze had a wonder rum-caramel flavor.  I wasn't sure about judging the "doneness" of the glaze.  I also didn't want much of any alcohol in the glaze, so I added the rum early enough to burn off the alcohol.  I'm not sure if the glaze was supposed to congeal as firmly as it did, but with the pecans, it had an exquisite flavor. The cake itself was a flavorful pound-cake-like consistency.

Very good. My family loved this. I don't love using box mixes but it definitely makes it easier to make.

I think 60 minutes was too long to cook this.  I made another recipe today and the cake instructions were the same as this except added vanilla.  It instructed to cook it for 40-45 minutes and that was perfect.

I added 3 oz flour to the 15.25 oz cake mix, and a 1/2 tsp baking powder to the dry ingredients.  Thanks Google!

Aside from the glaze instructions being 3 not 8 Tbs...it smells great.
Question...let it sit all day at room temp. And then store in refrigerator.?  Is is to be wrapped in foil or plastic wrap?

This is a classic, I have been making it for probably forty years. For the young cooks out there, my advice to you is to try it. The reviews have some different methods for the glaze, I just poke with a wooden spoon and then drizzle the glaze over the cake. I am sure any of the methods work well. It is just delicious

Delicious and easy! I used butter instead of oil (ew) and the cake came out wonderfully light and fluffy. I used spiced rum for a little kick. My boyfriend has an alcohol allergy, so I added the rum to the glaze with the rest of the ingredients and then boiled it down for a good half an hour. My parents were thrilled when I brought this out after dinner, and they said it looked as beautiful as it tasted.

I have made this several times and it comes out moist and wonderful taste. I play with the flavors. My favorite is German chocolate cake mix,  chocolate pudding and orange rum!  Another is a white cake mix, pistachio pudding and lime rum. The possibilities are endless!

They loved the cake; however instead of nuts, I used dried cranberries.  I never bake with box cakes, so I'm still looking for a rum cake made from flour.

I use apple sauce instead of the oil, equal portions in stead of the oil, this make the cake more moist and less fat. Be sure to use un-sweeted apple sauce.

What an extraordinary cake! You won't be disappointed with this one. I used a Betty Crocker mix, real farm eggs, and spiced rum. It was out of this world, and I'm not a very good dessert baker at all. I also used a Nordicware pan which I highly recommend, and a convection oven.

We loved this recipe,  I made it for my Dad's birthday.  I made it exactly as the recipe said, but I also made a home made whipped cream with about a tablespoon of rum, and a splash of vanilla in it to top it.  Everyone loved it!

This rum cake was so easy and sooo delicious, definitely a new family favorite!!!! One health conscious change I made was to not use as much sugar and butter for the glaze. I couldn't bring myself to put in as much as it called for and it actually tasted just fine. Other changes I made followed the first review....sifted the cake and pudding mix, used low fat milk instead of water, used Meyers rum for cake and a mix of Meyers and Bacardi dark for glaze (just because I love Meyers ??  Will make this cake again next year...thank you!!

I made 2 slight adjustments:  I used 2 tsp bourbon based vanilla and 2 tsp rum extract with French Vanilla pudding.(it was the only 3. 5 size left)  I have a scratch yellow cake recipe which I followed ( I found out that box mixes yield half the cake they used to so no more box mixes for me  personally).  I didn't have enough rum so I saved it for the glaze.  Long story short is that I don't know how it tasted since it was eaten by everyone else at the Christmas party.  I am assured by one and all that it was moist and delicious.  I must take their word for it.  So YES  I will make this again.  I want to try it with brandy next time just for fun.   I love how if you want to use the box mixes it's so simple and no fuss.  I also call it the 130.00 Rum Cake.  Pretty good for a simple cake.  Take that, Cake Boss.

I have made this cake so many times I cannot count. I made it the first year that Bacardi came out with the recipe, probably back in the 70s. I've made my own variations  over the years and it's always a hit.

I have been making this for several years now and it is highly requested in my family. I've never had any problems with the glaze but a little trick I do is make a buttercream frosting from scratch and dollop that around the cake and then pour the hot glaze over it. It makes an amazing yummy, creamy glaze. Also, for coconut fans, I will use coconut cream pudding mix and coconut rum. Yum!

1.  Use milk with mix. 2.  Cook 50 min. 3. When out of oven for ten min. Poke holes in bottom and add glaze.  Let cool. 4. When cool turn over and make another batch of glaze. Put on top. 5. Let it sit for 48 hours.   I made it first time with more butter in glaze. It's ok but it will be more mushy.   Put in refrigerator to get firmer if that takes place. It's so good. Use little chopped pecans.   Oh. If pudding in the mix no need to add more.

My husband and I were craving a good piece of rum cake after our vacation from the Cayman Islands and this tasted just like the delicious cakes we ate there. A definite keeper! I don't typically like the taste of rum but I love the flavor of it in this cake.  It's always a hit a parties as well as many of our friends and family had never eaten rum cake before

I used melted butter to replace the oil, doubled the rum in the glaze as well as letting it reduce for the entire hour cake baked, then poured it over cake as soon as it came out of oven. These were honest mistakes made by hurrying. The results were nonetheless amazing. Have made it several times to the ravest of reviews. Thank you someone's  Mom. Chris

I've been making this cake for years, having found the recipe from Barcardi's. Recently I've made this cake in canning jars and gave them for Christmas gifts. And you can change the liquor, cake mix, pudding and substitute juice for the water. I made lemon-lime vodka, pina coloda. Just use your imagination!

Wow....I made this cake for my moms birthday. It was AWESOME!!!! The only things I changed were, instead of plain run I used 1/2 Captain Morgan Spiced Rum and 1/2 Vanilla Rum in both the cake and the syrup. I also added Vanilla Paste to the sauce. This is by far the best rum cake ever. Thanks Laura

Mistake that turned out good - I added the 3 tablespoons of butter to the batter mix by mistake, but went ahead and baked it and the cake turned out to be the moistest, yummiest cake ever.  I'll make it again and do the same.  Also, I made a chocolate cake for people who might not like rum cake and the two together were outstanding.  I think, next time I make this I'll also include chocolate syrup along side as an option.

My first attempt at a rum cake and it tasted AWESOME!!! I wanted to use a recipe that wasn't too strong with wum since I wanted my kiddos to be able to eat it as well and this was perfect for the family. Unfortunatley I didn't grease & flower the pan well enough so my cake stuck to the bottom.  It looked hideous in the end but still tasted great!  I will make sure to use more shortening and flower on the pan next time.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.  This is a MUST TRY RECIPE!!!

I just made this and wow is it good!  I am looking forward to giving them out for Christmas.  I made them in small pie tins so that they would be in about 2 serving amounts.  I am thinking I might try it with a spice cake mix next time.

Although the bottom of the cake where the nuts and the glaze were good; the cake/crumb is too spongy and airy.  Can definitely tell it's not from scratch.

I'm not going to rate this recipe from my own taste buds because apparently I don't like rum at all. My husband on the other hand does and he said it was extremely good! Finding out I wasn't a fan of rum was a big bummer because it looked wonderful!  Thank you for giving my husband's tastebuds a real treat!

I had intended to make one cake to take to a New Year's Eve party tonight. I ended up having to make two - once my family cut into the first one, it was gone!!

I had no problem with the glaze. It took about 12 minutes to get to the perfect consistency, and I did find that it worked better when I spooned it over, rather than pouring it.
