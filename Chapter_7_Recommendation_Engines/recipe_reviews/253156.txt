This is a solid recipe, and it is a creative way to prepare BLSL chicken breasts.  I prepared the recipe exactly as stated.  The chicken was moist and flavorful, and the oven time was just right.  I drained my tomato, after chopping, and I wish I had pressed it a bit, to take out even more moisture.  I let the spinach cook a bit long, while waiting for the liquid to evaporate.  As a result, the spinach was over-cooked, for my taste.  I also wished for some minced garlic in the spinach.  This recipe makes a lot of gravy, too!  As you can see from my photo, I rolled three chicken breasts, and there was plenty of stuffing, and gravy to spare.  I added the cooking juices from the chicken, about 1/2 cup, to the gravy, and it was still quite thick.  The ratio of flour to liquid seemed a bit off.  This was my first time to use Lactaid, and I could not tell that it was not milk.  Overall, this was a good main dish, which I served with green beans and a baked sweet potato.  Thanks for the recipe!

I added carrots and celery an egg, croutons crumbs and partisan cheese with the spinach mix. I had also marinated seven chicken breast in a garlic herb pesto over night. It was delicious with a home made white sauce and parmesan cheese melted into the sauce. Served it with broccoli and quinoa/rice mix.

Delicious,  my only substitution was heavy cream for whole milk because it's what we had on hand.

I only had skin on bone in thighs so I stuffed those.  Very good and I will make this again.  Will switch to this gravy recipe from now on and add sauteed mushrooms.  I had to use more milk.

Followed the recipe as is for the chicken and it was delicious. For the gravy I made a roux from the chicken fat that was rendered and then added the milk and squeezed in half a lemon.

I've made a variation, whereby I combined 3 recipes -- the one with bacon-wrapped-chicken breasts and this recipe's stuffing and used a balsamic sauce from another recipe.

I didn't manage to buy roma tomato, and used regular tomato, which turned out to be too moist.  In future when I make it again, I'd try a different combination.  I was limited to what I could do as some of my friends couldn't take cheese, and the stuffing here was good that there's no cheese.

Overall, it was really tasty and pretty straightforward and easy to prepare.

This dish is not only easy to make but tastes amazing! I didn't have fresh tomato on hand so I used a can of fire roasted tomatos  and I drained the liquid before adding it to the spinach and used it in the gravy.  I didn't use as much salt as the recipe required and found it still tasted wonderful.  This chicken dish will definitely have a solid place in my menu rotation! Thank you for posting!

I followed the recipe exactly and the chicken came out very well.  Like other reviewers, I had extra filling to spare and think this could easily make 4 rolled chicken breasts.  I botched the gravy and will have to try that again.

I substituted kale for the spinach. I will definitely make it again with the spinach required in the recipe. Enjoyed by all.

Fantastic! Made this recipe exact and it was great! I had a lot of gravy which was wonderful because I like to dip the chicken in. Will make again and again!

I followed the recipe exactly as written, but had so much stuffing left over that I rolled up 2 more chicken breasts. This recipe easily feeds 4 people. Thankfully, I had just gone to the store and had the thawed chicken breasts readily available.  However, if I hadn't, I would have served the chicken over the leftover, warmed filling. It would be delicious that way.  I cooked the chicken 40 minutes, and it was tender and moist. I really liked the simple filling inside the rolled chicken. The gravy was good too...a little thick but I could have easily thinned it using more Lactaid milk. This is easy enough for everyday yet fancy enough for company.
