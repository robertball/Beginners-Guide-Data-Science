I located this recipe after having a a similar 'appetizer' in a restaurant. This was awesome. After reviewing several other recipe comments on line, I made some minor adjustments in the temperature and cooking time:  400 degrees and I watched it very closely. It took about 25 minutes for the sprouts to bake to a golden brown. I shook the pan frequently. Also, we're not crazy about feta, so I used shaved parmesan instead. Yum!!!!!

I will definitely make this again; it was marvelous.  

Per advice here and elsewhere on the internet, I set the oven at 400 instead of 450.  The sprouts took 25 minutes to become tender and golden brown, and the sauce thick without burning, but I was also toasting the walnuts on a separate cookie sheet for some of that, which may have added to the cooking time.

Fantastic recipe! The flavours are very well combined here. The lightly sweet maple flavor melds so well with the tang of the balsamic vinegar. I toned down the garlic and only had pine nuts and goat cheese on hand. The roasted, earthy flavour of the brussels sprouts and the delicate cheese just seem to be meant for each other. A wonderful array of warm flavours for a winter delight! Thank you for this recipe.

This is my favorite brussel sprouts recipe.  I love it just as written; AND I've played with it.  Comes out yummy either way.  I've used pancake syrup when I didn't have maple syrup - still works; omitted the walnuts or cranberries (only when I had to), still yummy (but not as sweet minus the cranberries);  substituted the feta with goat or blue cheese (cuz that's what I had and you can't omit the cheese!) - yumm-o!  (Think I like the goat cheese the best, honestly. )  As far as the temp. - when I used an older pan for roasting, it burnt at 450.  However, I purchased a new pan and magically, the recipe works perfectly every time.  Granted, I check it every 10 minutes and stir it up, but it doesn't burn anymore and caramelizes perfectly.  Thanks for sharing this family-favorite recipe!

I had to pull my sprouts out of the oven at about 30 minutes because all of the liquid had become a big burned mess of charcoal on my cookie sheet.  Next time, I'll start roasting the sprouts and then add the rest of the ingredients about half way through the cooking process.  I will also add more of the liquid ingredients.  I think that the flavor will be fantastic it doesn't burn.

Good dish which I will make again.  There were a couple of issues.

Cranberries+syrup+balsamic = too sweet!  Next time I will just skip the syrup altogether. 

The cook time is too long at such a high temperature, at least for my oven.  Take a look at about 25 minute mark, and pull out when you see the flat tops are golden brown color.  Also, drain the excess liquid before putting on the sheet to prevent smoke from burning of all those sugars.  450F is scorching hot.  BTW I used Almonds although I do think walnuts would be better.  The pic in this recipe showed pine nuts.

Hubby said this was definitely "company worthy". I liked it because not only was it delicious but it was easy and "hands off".

I have made this recipe twice both times it burnt to the pan. I read reviews and decreased the cooking time to 20 minutes and it still burned. The first time I made it didn't burn as much, and when it is mixed with all the other ingredients it is very tasty. The second time it was too burnt to taste good. Next time I make it I am going to reduce the oven temperature, not add all the liquid and reduce the cooking time to 15 minutes.

I made half a batch and followed others with 400 degrees for about 30 minutes.  Turned out fantastic!  Loved the feta cheese mixed in to make it creamy. Will definitely be making again!

For someone that hates brussel sprouts as much as I did-try this recipe-it will change your mind. It’s delicious and disguises the brussel sprout taste. Thanks so much for the recipe!!

Sorry I didn't read year reviews first! They burnt and I wasn't able to serve. 450° 40 minutes was way too much time and heat

I am admittedly not a huge fan of brussels sprouts but this recipe may have changed that.  I'm trying to eat more of a plant based diet without getting bored with plain steamed, roasted, or raw vegetables.  I had this over rice with a salad and it was a perfect meal.

My husband and I have never been a big fan of brussel sprouts, but, I am determined to try and find a recipe to like them!   My brussel sprouts did take longer to cook than the recipe stated, but, they were really large sprouts.  I probably should have cut them in fourths.  We did like the balsamic flavor and I thought the feta worked well with the sprouts.
