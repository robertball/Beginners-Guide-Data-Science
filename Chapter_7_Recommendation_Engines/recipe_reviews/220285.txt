This recipe is great. But, we always make sure we eat it right after it comes out of the oven. It isn't as good the next day.  But, we usually don't have any left.  Ooeeyyyyy Gooery!

I made this cake for my grand young 'uns and they loved it. I liked it too, but it was too "tame" for my wild & overactive taste buds.
I'm an old-fashioned, country cookin', 67 yr old grandma who loves highly seasoned food.
I tried this recipe because it is so similar to mine. 
In my recipe, I add 1 teaspoon vanilla to the batter; 2 teaspoons cornstarch and 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon to the dry cocoa/brown sugar; equal parts hot water and hot milk.
The cake is more flavorful and the sauce is creamier. 
(I use brown sugar in ALL chocolate batter.)
Sometimes I would add a bit of flavor to the hot milk/water and lightly dust the top of the baked cake with powdered sugar.
I've also made this cake by combining all the
dry ingredients for the sauce/pudding, add the hot milk/hot water, mix well, pour over the batter.
It worked for me! Deeeeelicious!!

Was excited to try this but not that impressed.   Not enough chocolate flavor and too sweet.  Prefer chocolate lava cakes -- richer flavor and not any more trouble, just as easy to prepare and makes for a much prettier presentation for company.

This is a very old recipe, it was originally named: Hershey's Hot Fudge Pudding Cake, made without the nuts.  I have made it for years and it never fails to please, especially the men.  I prefer it hot, about 20 minutes out of the oven.  It is a great company dessert, bakes while you are dining.  I usually serve it with vanilla ice cream.   Give it a try, you will not be disappointed.

This looks incredible when it’s taken from the oven.  The dessert is all “chocolately” with the fudge sauce bubbling enticingly through the cake layer.  I admit I’m a chocoholic and couldn’t wait to dig in.   I made a mistake when I made the cake base using ¼ cup of cocoa instead of the two tablespoons.  It must have been a Freudian slip.  I also added ½ teaspoon of vanilla to the cake base and boiled the water before pouring it on the cake.  I’ve made several pudding cakes but I like this one the best.  There is plenty of chocolate sauce and it has great chocolate flavor.  This was a last minute thought to make for dessert and had I planned to make this earlier I would have saved leftover coffee to add to the liquid to enhance the chocolate flavor.  Serve warm with vanilla ice cream for a perfect dessert.

This recipe was in the 1952 edition of the Betty Crocker Cookbook. I have made it for over sixty years. It is a family favorite. I use pecans instead of walnuts, and I usually add a teaspoon of vanilla.

Made this recipe as stated.  It had plenty of pudding and chocolate flavor.  Will make this one of my favorites.  I did have left overs and they are good the next day.  Just pop the serving into the microwave to heat.  Yummy!

With a couple of variations this recipe goes from 4 star to 5 stars in my recipe book.  I use brown sugar throughout the recipe.  It gives a complexity of flavor that is sorely lacking otherwise.  I also add an extra teaspoon to cocoa to the batter and the pudding.  Adding a teaspoon of cinnamon also subtly enhances the flavor.  Then it's definitely a 5 star recipe!!!  :)

This recipe is delicious, as well as quick and fun to make!  

I appreciate the way THIS recipe was written, with measurements given in step order, and  accuratet to that step.  When 2 T of cocoa powder is listed when it is actually used, and the 1/4 C of cocoa powder is listed later when it is used, errors are avoided.  Beginning cooks make mistakes when TOTAL ingredient amounts are listed in the ingredients section.  Experienced, 40 year bakers like I am appreciate breaking them down to make baking faster.  ALL recipes should be written to facilitate the baker/cook's "mise en place" time!  Unfortunately, americastestkitchentv.com uses the total ingredients method.  I do so detest errors when I cook, and any site that saves me from the wasted time of figuring out a  fix to a recipe that was badly written, or saves me the time I would waste in rewriting a recipe properly is my friend!  Hot Fudge Pudding Cake II is one of those poorly written recipes.  I rarely make baking errors anymore and they really annoy me when I do!.

Really tasty. The only reason I gave it a four out of five is because, even with my habitual reducing of sugar, it was still too sweet for me. My tweaks: Reduced sugar to 1/2 cup and 1/2 cup. Added a teaspoon of vanilla to both parts. I will make this again, but might reduce the sugar a bit more and use milk for the syrup.

It tasted good, but I believe the amount of hot water to pour over batter is too much. My pudding was runny.  I couldn't find my regular recipe for this cake, so I used this one. I think everything is the same except for the amount of how water.  I would say no more than 1/2 cup.

Oh my word! Excellent!  I did double it since I knew we'd want leftovers so I baked it about 10 min longer.  Also subbed boiling leftover coffee for the water as I have done in the past for similar recipes.  A new favorite!!  And it was just as good the next day, zapped in microwave with a scoop of vanilla ice cream on top!

This chocoholic has been making this for 30 years:
1) Follow the liquid instructions exactly! Ignore all reviews that didn't do this.
2) Feel free to add a teaspoon of vanilla to cake batter.
3) Use boiling strong coffee instead of water, coffee always enhances chocolate flavor. I usually add instant coffee to the water.
4) Use good cocoa. Ignore any review saying it wasn't chocolately enough or too sweet, they aren't using good cocoa. I use Hershey's Special Dark (or Droste), it is like the  difference between dollar store chocolate and Ghirardelli.
5) Eat warm with ice cream, it is not as good reheated.

Just like my mother used to make!  If it truly is out of the 1952 Betty Crocker Cookbook, then it is the recipe she used to make.  I did add a teaspoon of vanilla to the cake batter as someone else suggested.  Other than that small tweak, it's a very yummy cake!  My grandson loved it!  He wanted something fudgy, so I remembered this cake and made it for him.

I was trying to find a pudding cake recipe like the boxed mix they used to sell in my youth. This one seemed easy enough. Unfortunately, I also found this a bit watery and sickeningly sweet. Like another reviewer; I, too, reduced the sugar (1/2 cup in the cake, 2/3 cup in the sauce) and added about a tsp of vanilla to the cake. I also needed to add an extra 1/4 cup of milk to the cake, as the batter was literally like biscuit dough without it.

I used slivered almonds instead of walnuts in the cake. It added a nice texture.

Next time I'd suggest upping the butter to 1/4 cup, and/or using whole milk or light cream in both parts of the cake.

I followed one reviewer's suggestion and used brown sugar in the cake as well as on top.  I also doubled the cocoa in the cake.  I thought it was good, but way too sweet (though my daughter, who wanted it for her birthday cake, thought it was scrumptious!).  Serving it with vanilla ice cream helped some, but not enough (in my opinion).  If I make it again, I might try it with unsweetened whipped cream instead, to tone down the sweet a bit more.  The chocolate flavor was really good, though, and I loved the texture of the cake - it gets a nice crunch on top, but stays moist inside, like the best kind of brownie.

Turned out wonderfully. There were others in previous reviews who suggested that you add brown sugar to the cake batter, and while I personally didn't, I do believe it would have been even better if I did. Don't get me wrong, it's a fantastic recipe, but perhaps could have been made a bit sweeter.

Very good. I would leave out the walnuts next time, didn't find they added anything to the dish.

I followed recipe as written and will not make it again. The cake part was dry and tasted more of flour than chocolate. The pudding part was mediocre. I won't take time to adjust either later.

So yummy! I think it's a little cocoa powdery but that is quickly and deliciously mellowed out by vanilla ice cream.

This is an easy and exciting cake. The way the ingredients "move around" during baking fascinates me. Flavor-wise, it is really tempting to eat this cake while warm, but the chocolate flavor needs to settle. It is a million times better cooled, and even next day from the refrigerator. I make it in my 6" springform pan, it's pretty tiny.

I loved it but sort of feel like something is missing.  Would like to try it w/ coffee in place of water next time.

Super easy and delicious. My mom used to make a cake similar to this, but it was less gooey.  This would have probably been better if we ate it immediately out of the over.  Had noo complaints though!
