Since this is the first time I have made this recipe, I followed the directions exactly. That was a mistake. I'm sure the cooking time is off. * hours on high for a 3 lb piece of meat produced a stringy mess. Parts of it had to be discarded because they were impossible to chew. Maybe this would work on low for 8 hours.

After i made this, i decided that Flank Steak is one thing that DEFINATLY should NOT be made in a slow cooker. I think you're better off just marinading for a couple hours then making it in the oven or on the grill.

This turned out great! I would add more onions and carrots next time. The cook time is off. I cooked about 2.7 lbs of flank steak in the crock pot for about 5 hours on low. It was tender considering the type of meat, and cooked to perfection. DEFINITELY do not cook on high for 8 hours! I was at home and was able to keep an eye on it. The taste was perfect. This was my first time cooking flank steak and would probably just buy chuck roast next time because it is more of a tender cut and is cheaper from what I can tell. Not sure of the benefit of flank over chuck. Taste wise, not overpowering, but throw in some extra veggies.

Made it completely according to the recipe...EXCEPT on LOW, not high..... it was PERFECT.  Juicy, cut with a spoon, better than a Pot Roast..PERFECT!!!!! My kids gobbled it down, my husband raved, my foodie sister freaked!!! This will go in the all-star recipe file!!! (I did cut the steak up into 4 ounce pieces, and stirred everything up every 2 hours or so)

I'm only giving this recipe *3* stars.  Would like you to know, though, the meat was absolutely melt in your mouth tender.  The carrot, though, tasted nasty, even my husband mentipned how bad it was.  I would recommend leaving out carrot (cook on stove instead), then if you choose to add to dish when all done cooking, do so.  Sorry for not so good review.

This recipe was delicious and steak tender. The time is very wrong. I cooked on low for four hours. I also rubbed the steak with steak seasoning instead of just salt and proper.

I cooked this in my dutch oven, and my oven runs a little hot, so I used 1 cup of liquids instead.  I used the crock pot to dutch oven conversion to come up with 2 hours at 325 instead of 8 hours on low (you can look this up on the internet).  My husband loved it, and it was not too dry.  I did use vegetable broth instead of water.  It was very similar to a pot roast.  I'll be trying these ingredients out with a pot roast next to see how different the meats taste.  And yes, it makes it stringy.

I used more water than the recipe called for and substituted some of the water with chicken broth because I had to leave it cooking for 10 hours while I was at work and would not have an opportunity to turn the steak. For this reason, I also cooked it on low. It was fantastic! My husband loved it. I served it with Mashed potatoes and green beans.

I read the reviews and decided to cook it on low instead of high. It only took it 5 hours to cook on low. It was very bland, so the next time I cooked it, I rubbed it down with Old Bay seasoning from Penzy's, added garlic, salt, pepper, onion powder, and two bay leaves. I also added more carrots and onions. It turned out perfect this way! I think cooking it on low is what really makes the difference. The only reason I'm giving this 3 stars is because of the cooking time and it was just too bland to me when I first cooked it.

This was to much meat falling off the bone. My first time cooking in a crock pot! I'll add vegetable later next time.

I think a flank steak needs to be grilled/broiled, I did not like the texture of this cut of meat in the crockpot.

Many are saying to cook double the time. I'm not sure they read that recipe cooked for 4 hours, then ANOTHER 4 hours. 8 is enough, dont cook for 16 hours :) 
***I found 8 hours on low was perfect! 
I had never cooked this type of meat before. Lots of research brought me to this recipe. I added some "home-made" italian style spice, added 2 more carrots and served over rice. 
DeFreakinLicious! Thank you!

Came out ok but a bit weird. Long strands of meat.... I’m not anxious to make again. Maybe this type of steak just isn’t best in the slow cooker!

I thought this came out perfectly, as written.  Some might prefer more spicing but, for an incredibly easy and tasty recipe, this one is fantastic!

The only thing I changed on this recipe was that I added more water so that the whole steak was covered. Everything else I followed and I loved how tender and delicious it came out!
