The strawberry lime combo is a great way to spruce up a glass of water! I really love the flavor. It's makes drinking water a whole lot more enjoyable! Thanks!!

So refreshing!!!... I think I'll make this infusion more often, my oldest daughter is drinking a lot and she hates water. Strawberry and lime work perfectly together.

3.18.16  Had some  lime sparkling water in the fridge, so I used that in place of regular water.  Very fresh and thirst quenching.

Suggested by another... Sometimes I use sparkling water and add mint....very refreshing!  Also suggested...  I recommend drinking this within a few hours. The longer it sits, I find the lime starts to add a bitter flavor.

What's not to like?  Infused water is an easy way to get you water intake up and not be board.  It was very refreshing.

What's not to like? A very flavorful way to up your water intake, without added sugar and calories. I recommend drinking this within a few hours. The longer it sits, I find the lime starts to add a bitter flavor. Such a  versatile recipe!

Nice and refreshing! I plan to try different flavor combos, though the strawberries and lime was a good one. I drink a lot of water, so this is nice for a change~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)
