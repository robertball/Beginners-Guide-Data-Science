My family *loves* this recipe and it is so easy! I usually throw all of the ingredients in the crock pot and walk away.

This dish was great! I added a bag of frozen veggies to it so it would be more then just meat and potatoes. I also cooked it longer for more flavor. Very good!

This is one of my favorite beef stews. That curry adds an exotic zing! I love the flavor and nutrient value of swapping out the white potatoes for all sweet potatoes or a mix of sweet potatoes and turnips (equals more nutrients and lower glycemic effect than white potatoes). As another reviewer suggested, I also like to add a thickner for that real stew quality. (Personally, I always prefer using white or even better, whole wheat pastry flour for my thickner to lower the glycemic effect - something even us non-diabetics benefit from health wise. Of course, whenever one uses wheat flour compared to cornstarch, you must take some liquid out, add it to the flour, and then add the mixture to the stew.)

My wife suprised me with this dish.  It was wonderful.  Only thing she did different was she added cornstarch to thicken it.  She wanted a beef curry dish, not soup.  It still turned out lovely

Yummy! I followed the recipe except, like others, I added some cornstarch to thicken it and I also added some veggies (carrots and celery). I accidentally let it simmer too long so a lot of the liquid evaporated but it was still delicious! This is a recipe that can be easily adapted to each persons taste depending how strong you like it or what veggies you want in it. Would porbably be good with chicken or pork instead of the beef too.

This recipe was easy to follow, used simple ingredients, and tasted delicious! I added half a bag of frozen California Blend vegetables(carrots, broccoli, and cauliflower) about ten minutes after I added the potatoes. I served it over a scoop of rice in a bowl. It was great!

This is now my favorite soup ever! I make fresh French bread to dip in it and it is AMAZING! I cook it for about an hour and then add potatoes and carrots for the last 30 minutes. Absolutly a keeper!

This did not turn out well for us. I did cook it in the crock pot instead of on the stove, but other than that, I followed the ingredients exactly.  I did not enjoy the flavor.  I usually have great success with AllRecipes.  Sorry!

I really took the reveiwers comments to heart.  I cooked in a crockpot instead of a pot.
I used curry paste instead of powder, its what I had.  I subbed  sweet potatoes  rather than white potatoes. I also thickened it with cornstarch and served it over rice.  It was good but not great.   I will make it again,  but will probablly add spinach at the end for color and might add cashews as well for crunch.  But a good base will use this recipie again

Loved this soup!   So tasty - great on a cold day!   I didn't use bay leaves and I used sweet potatoes instead of regular potatoes and it tasted incredible.  Prepared it in crockpot.

I needed more so increased recipe by 1.5 X. I also added 1/2 cup barley,doubled patatoes  and cut the beef cubes into 3/4 inch cubes. I used the slow cooker once beef was browned for about 3 hours low heat. It got better with more time. This was "FANTASTIC" if you like curry and both my kids( 14 & 16) and even my wife want it again. This recipe got me huge bonus points as a good cook from the kids....one up on the misses. if you like curry you will love this recipe! 
warning dont cook it in a sweater as the curry lasts for days everywhere I went hahaha!

Wow.  Is this soup delicious!  I'm a lover of beef soup and curry-anything so this was a wonderful blend.  I made it exactly as the recipe states but next time I'll throw in some extra vegetables.

What a great simple and tasty recipe! I had never dabbled in curry cooking, but after a recent meal at an Indian restaurant in the big city I figured, why not! The only thing I added was some red curry paste along with the curry powder I had on hand, and some carrots to go along with the potatoes.  I am one of those people who tastes as he cooks, and the second the curry hit the soup, I knew this was a winner! Thank you so much!

The only changes I made were to add chopped celery and 3 tablespoons of curry. I found the beef dhydrated powder is too salty so next time I make this soup I'll use a low sodium boullion. Asides from being to salty it was very good.

Great! Excellent basic recipe base that can be played with liberally.  I substituted a prepackaged black bean soup (Trader Joe's) for half of the beef broth and the results got rave reviews here!
