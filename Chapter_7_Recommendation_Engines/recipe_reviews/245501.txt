I've made this recipe 3 times, have taken GREAT liberties with it and it is still delicious!  I didn't have several of the spices on hand so I left out the basil, turmeric and garam masala (which I've never even heard of), also adjusted the cumin down at the suggestion of the other reviewer, and reduced the mustard by 1 T since it was a little too mustard-y for me otherwise. Instead of deep frying I made little patties and fried them in a frying pan. But my favorite way to enjoy this recipe is to simply use the filling as a spread on crackers or just eat plain. (Saves tons of calories and great when you're craving something salty.) I did take the submitter's suggestion and put the sauerkraut in the food processor, which gives it a great texture. And it's even better the next day! Thank you, Emma, for sharing this recipe!

These were a bit time consuming but really good. I am a huge fan of cumin but thought there was a little too much in these. I suggest using half the amount the recipe calls for. To speed the cooling process up, I stuck my mixture in the refrigerator for 30 minutes and they balled up just fine.

Not great. The balls did not hold together well. But more importantly, they tasted like cumin only. Try 2 teaspoons, not 2 tablespoons. This must be a misprint.
