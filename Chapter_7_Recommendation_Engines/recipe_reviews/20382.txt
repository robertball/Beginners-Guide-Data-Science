I increased this recipe to make 100 servings and baked it this past weekend.  I added just a little more Amaretto and a touch more sugar to the recipe.  I cannot say enough about how wonderful these cookies turned out.  My husband who is not a major sweet freak tried one and fell in love, because, aside from the confectioners' sugar on the outside, these are not super sweet cookies.  They are just right.  I will definitely be making more of these cookies in the future.  A big hit!

This cookie was horrible...it was the very first thing I've ever baked that DID NOT turn out.
4 cups of icing sugar to 2 1/2 cups of flour?  One batch wasted and into the garbage.
Never again.  Please re-check your ingredients list!!!!!!!!!!!

I made these cookies about 3 weeks ago. I just took them out of the tins to serve. For those that aren't happy with this recipe please note: This is what you call a butter cookie..it has no eggs. The flavor mellows while stored, yes for 2 or 3 weeks. The trick to this is use a foil lined tin with a tin top, NOT plastic. Seperate layers with wax paper NOT plastic wrap, set aside on a shelf where your family won't start taste testing! (Not the refrigerator) You will be amazed with the results. This is a wonderful cookie to make at Christmas, because it is best made ahead when you aren't quite as busy. They were excellent & almost dissolve in your mouth as a very tastey buttery treat.. My coffee gang devoured them. I gave them only 4 stars, only because I think the recipe needed an explanation about serving true butter cookies.

These are very tasty and buttery. I would use less salt, maybe just 1/2 t.  I definitely added the almonds, made for a nice texture-flavor combo.  Instead of just rolling the cookies in powdered sugar at the end, I made a glaze for them, as you might do for an anginetti, of powdered sugar with enough Amaretto for a glaze consistency.

Exactly what I was looking for. I used the small Papered Chef cookie scooper and baked for 8 minutes, which yielded 52. This will be a permanent addition to my Christmas Cookie list.

I am sorry but these "cookies" were terrible. Lack of sugar was most noticeable. I followed recipe to a "T" and was greatly disappointed and threw them in the trash.

These are pretty good, but really they could pass for sugar cookies.  If I make them again I'll add more amaretto.

I thought this seemed to be a great recipe, but unfortunately, I was out of amaretto. Instead I used cointreu, and hazelnuts instead of almonds. The cookies tasted GREAT, I will definitely make them again.

Being a working mom of 3 boys and short on time, I made the dough (including the almonds) two days before I was going to bake the cookies.  I double wrapped AND rubberbanded the bowl before refrigerating.  Well, last night I took out the bowl and some little hands had taken off the rubberband and the plastic was barely on the bowl.  I tried to make the dough into balls, but it was extremely dry and crumbly.  Anyway, somehow I managed to get them into a ball and I threw them in the oven, not expecting much.  Well, these babies BLOW AWAY all of the other cookies I have EVER made or tasted from others -- and I consider myself a cookie snob.  In my book, this will be the cookie that all others are measured against.  Michelle -- THANK YOU!!!

YUMMY!!!  Little cookies of perfect yumminess!  Can you tell I love these cookies?  What a great find!  I used a cheap brand of Amaretto (it was on sale), and I've been living with that for a while.  Next time I make these it will be with Disaronno!  I chose to add the chopped almonds to the batter, and I baked them for 12 minutes.  It's best to use a sifter of some sort to get the powdered sugar on the outside so it doesn't cake on.  These will definitely make my day again.  My biggest disappointment?  I only made half a batch today!

They are the quickest and most delicious cookies I make during the holidays. My co-worker said, "I don't know if I should hug you or hurt you…these are SO good!" Beware: they are incredibly addicting and so easy to make you won't be able to help yourself.

Absolutely delicious! Not too sweet, more bread-like. I added more almonds and amaretto

These are pretty good - instead of rolling them in powdered sugar, I make a glaze with powdered sugar and a little amaretto and dip them.

I followed recipe as directed and  it tasted like balls of cooked flour, and salty.  Quite possible I did something wrong, but won't try again.

I read the reviews about it being bland, so I tasted the batter.  I'm glad I did. You can't taste the creamed butter/sugar.  It tasted like flour.  I added more Amaretto, lots. And more powder sugar.  It turned out okay in the end, but a little pasty to eat.  I guess less flour is the key.
