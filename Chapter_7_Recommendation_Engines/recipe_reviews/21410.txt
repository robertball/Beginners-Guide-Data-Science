Absolutely delicious!  My husband told me I could make it seven days a week!  The only thing that I did different was use Splenda instead of sugar (because we eat low-carb,) used butter instead of lard, and added some minced garlic (because I love it!)  I will definitely make this again.

Omit the salt and it's perfect!  I also used ketchup instead of tomato sauce to avoid opening an entire can and it came out great.  Very flavorful and perfect served over rice with a side of steamed asparagus.

This recipe was very easy and has a LOT of flavor to it!  We used striped bass instead of cod, and recommend to use a not-too-expensive of a fish since the strong flavors of the hoisin sauce and soy sauce, really over-powered the fish flavor.  We really enjoyed it.  Thanks!

The fish needs to be cooked longer than indicated for the first frying, otherwise the fish isn't done and won't flake.  I breaded with flour.  Then in another pan, I added all the sauce stuff and then transferred the fish into there (where again I cooked it longer).  Overall pretty good.

EXCELLENT!!!  I used a fresh whole red snapper and can't wait to do this recipe again.  My mom made her creole sauce she always makes for fried fish but this time nobody even looked at it.  She even took my printed recipe to make some shrimps with it, we loved it.  I was even goin to take some pics to post but...

Like Chinese BBQ.  Even the kids like this one.  I used walleye instead of cod and tomato paste instead of canned tomato sauce.  I served with White and Wild Rice Pilaf.  Num.

I cooked this last night and it was really lovely. I only tweaked the recipe by useing low salt soy sauce as my husband is diabetic and I was not sure what the tomato sauce was as I think our tomato sauce in australia is like your ketchup so I used that as I was not sure what you meant is it what we would call tomato paste?  Cheers

Not my favorite!  Very unusual.  I did change the fish - I used Orange Roughy b/c we were out of Cod. They are both very middle fish so I figured it wouldn't matter.  My husband loved the dish and so did my four year old as well! So maybe I'll fix it again just for something different.  I LOVE salt and ended up not added as much salt as it called for and thought the recipe still was too salty - so be careful!

Very good. Used Ocean Perch because it was fresh. Doubled the ketchup/tomato sauce, and added a tablespoon of Dijon mustard to cut the sweetness a bit. No salt needed. Hoisin,soy sauce are both salty. Taste like BBQ fish!

The sauce was really excellent!  Very flavorful.  I did leave the salt out of the sauce, but I also coated the fish in cornstarch seasoned with salt and pepper before frying, so that added most of the salt back.  I made this recipe with some other Chinese-ish dishes, and this one was my favorite, hands down.  I will definitely make this again.

I gave this a 4 star rating only because I would not serve this to guests but liked it myself. I got mixed reviews from two other family members, one liked it and one didn't. The sauce is a bit on the strong side. The changes I made were 1T of ketchup instead of tomato sauce as I didn't want to open up a can for 1T and I used 1/2 tsp salt. I served it with fried rice.

I made this as written, and thought the sauce was super sour and strong-tasting. I diluted it down a bit with low sodium chicken broth, but it was still really salty and overwhelming. I don't really understand the whole "twice fried" thing tbh. It didn't add anything to the fish at all. Anyway, this turned out ok but not amazing. There are better ways to cook cod imo. Thanks anyway!

Good dish, but rather bland for using Hoisin sauce.  Fish tasted very mild.

This was so good with some fresh/frozen fish my friend's uncle caught.  i wsn't sure what kind it was, so the strong flavor was a plus.  Hubby wanted it right away again.

This had some good flavor combinations, but it was way too salty for our taste.  I think I'll try this again but keep the soy sauce and leave out the extra salt.  
We served it with fried rice and a cucumber salad.

I like fishing and fish food. I'm not too good in preparing food...but this recipe was easy to do and it really tastes good! I used North European whitefish (Coregonus lavaretus). Next summer I'll try with boneless pike-fillets aswell!

This was pretty good. I used Swai fish in place of the cod and butter instead of lard. I did have problem with the cornstarch and wish I would have left it out altogether. I dissolved it it cold water but as soon as it hit that skillet it began to clump. I will leave it out next time and will also double the sauce ingredients.
