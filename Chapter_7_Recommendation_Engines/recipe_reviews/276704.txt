We really liked these, my husband could not stop eating them. Mine did not come out like the pictures, they spread out thin and crispy, probably because I used butter instead of margarine. That’s just fine by us, but I’ll try the Margarine next time just to see the difference. I’ll probably drop in an extra tbsp of bourbon too. I did add some mini chocolate chips ... had to!
