I also cut this recipe in half and used it for a chicken.  It turned out moist and tender, but a little too salty for our taste.

Very good, the turkey was moist and seasoned just right.

I used this recipe on a chicken instead of a turkey breast so I just halved everything and let it sit in brine 8 hours.  Only change I made was to use fat-free greek yogurt instead of butter for the rub.  So juicy and flavorful with a bit of earthiness coming from the tea and bourbon and the orange adding a touch of brightness.    Brining is so worth every bit of extra time.

We received so many compliments last year on our turkey that we are doing it again this year.  We hosted two Thanksgiving dinners totaling 45 people and used this recipe.  Rave reviews.  Turkey was moist and had a great flavor that was subtle and delicious.  Thank you for this wonderful recipe.

This will be my third year using this on a whole turkey.  It's great!  Everybody loves it.
