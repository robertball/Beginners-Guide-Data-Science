Who would have thought to put shrimp sauce over tator tots?  Well hats off to whoever came up with it.  I had to look up Newburg, and I learned that it is a creamy sauce and this sauce in the recipe is very tasty.  I did add just a couple of extras.  I added some green onion because when I got the celery out, well there was the green onion right next to it, just starring at me.  So I grabbed it and the roasted garlic also.  Added a little pepper also.  I was concerned about the 4 oz of shrimp.  I just like more meat than that, but it seems to be just fine.  This was so simple, so quick, and so tasty.  We really enjoyed this, and you just can't beat how quick and easy it comes together.

Loved this and I didn't expect to love this. I am not a fan of cream of soups and never have been but this was the bomb. I made one change and that is that I chopped up cooked shrimp instead of using those freakish little things that come from a can. If I had one suggestion and something I will do differently next time is that I would use cream of celery soup. The cream of chicken was fine but didn't really go with the dish as well in my opinion. This has a Poutine feel to it and we really liked it. Definitely use no salt butter because the soup and cheese packs a ton of sodium in this recipe. I was pleasantly surprised with how this turned out and I will most definitely make it again.

Lightning fast and pretty great. I didn't make any changes, but next time I'd double the shrimp.

My family was pleasantly surprised that this was sooo good, even my picky eater loves it! We also use fresh cooked medium shrimp rather than little canned shrimp, and have added crab also. Thanks!
