3 stars as written, 5 stars with minor alterations.  I took the advice of others, and cut the sugar in half, and it was still too tad sweet for my taste. Tried to remedy with about 3 T. bottled lime juice, but still a bit sweet. Sugar should be omitted, but the lime is a nice addition. The heat of the salsa (somewhere between mild and medium) is good, but I like a little more  kick.  In subsequent batches, I adjusted the ingredients more to my liking, being mindful of the acid / non-acid ingredient ratios for safety reasons. The addition of the lime juice allowed me to use 5-6 cloves of fresh minced garlic (instead of garlic powder) and 2 T. of freshly minced cilantro. I stuck with the 3 cups of mixed onions, but played with the peppers. Keeping the total amount at about 2 1/2 cups, I used 4 jalapenos, 2 banana peppers, and then 2 green bells. I also upped the cumin to 2 tsp.  Cooking for 3 hours is ridiculous... to do so would leave you with no texture to your salsa at all! After chopping all the veg, I placed them in a colander over a bowl for an hour to drain excess moisture. When I mixed all the ingredients in the pot, I boiled for about 15-20 minutes, which is plenty long enough for safety issues.

Taste is fantastic. family wondered why in the world I was spending 10 hrs on my feet to make something we can get at walmart for a few dollars. Cause it's ROCKIN! They agreed- it turned out great and we ate a lot fresh. This was a fun way to use up extra produce from the garden. I'm completely new to canning but it wasn't hard. Instead of cooking off the water I ladled it out carefully so as not to pick up the chunks. Worked like a charm. But (I'm very frugal) I saved the juice and made "taco soup" with it later. To the salsa I also added chopped fresh oregano & parsley from the garden, and more cumin b/c we like that flavor. Tomato paste is essential- makes it thick and rich. I had no idea what "6 lbs" of tomatoes was b/c we had no scale... I "guesstemated" But later discovered this to be a dangerous thing in canning. Tomatoes provide the acid that kills Clostridium botulinum (the little anaerobic buggers that make the tasteless toxin responsible for deadly Botulism) thus having the right proportion to the low-acid onions and peppers is ESSENTIAL. Learning after the fact, I had a mild freak-out b/c I had added extra onions (we grew A LOT) & extra peppers to my batch. I ended up throwing out all my hard work which, as a frugal woman was EXTREMELY painful. But...this was NOT the recipes fault, this was MY fault. I had to write this in the review to save my fellow newbies from a similar mistake. FOLLOW THE RECIPE! Or use a pressure canner.

We love salsa to eat and share with friends and neighbors so we went to a farm and bought three cases of tomatoes. We made this recipe four times over a week, with adjustments as we sampled and evaluated. Our conclusion was that this is an excellent recipe that offers you a pleasantly sweet upfront taste followed by gentle or more heat as you choose. You can make adjustments within bounds that won't alter the acidic balance necessary for preservation. You can use three cups of onion, any kind. Two and a half cups of peppers, hot or mild or any mixture, with seeds or not, depending on your heat preference. We liked lemon juice instead of vinegar for flavor and an additional boost of acidity just in case. We added a teaspoon and a half of oregano, a standard in a former recipe. We reduced the sugar to a tabespoon of each white and brown sugars and it was still plenty sweet. Plus, we found that using roma tomatoes for half of the tomatoes yielded a thicker, less watery salsa that we preferred. We also used one of those choppers that allows you to push vegetables through a sharp grid. We used the smaller grid instead of the coarser one because that too seemed to contribute to a better consistency. From here on, this is our go-to salsa recipe.

Ok here is my only warning, I changed a few things and after 6 batches here is my current, onions same, tomatoes same, I have used sweet peppers and banana same amount little difference, 1 8 oz can paste, 2T apple cider vinegar, adds sweet to allow for less sugar, and it also keeps levels ok for canning, 5 cloves chopped garlic, salt same, sub red crushed pepper for cayenne, 1/2t cumin, 3T brown sugar,  2T white, now the big changer is yellow bell peppers they are sweeter and to me less dirty tasting,(all peppers =around 2 1/2 cups) and 1 T lemon juice.  I add jalapeno peppers 2 omit the seeds for milder, buy pickled for milder yet. We also like 1t cilantro. Here is the thing I have found.... The type of tomato changes the salsa more than anything. I made my 1st batch with sweeter tomatoes (I exclude some sugar 1T of each I think is what I used with sweeter tomatoes), and my last with late season seconds they are from one end of the spectrum of sweet to the other overly tomato tasting... Keep this in mind. Also there is no need to cook for 3 hours, I cook anywhere from 20 min to 1 hour based on what I am doing (2 little children distract me) remember your hot bath cooks this too. And if you grind with a hand held mixer there is no need to simmer flavor away. The longer it cooks the more it changes taste to me. As a previous person commented it only takes a hot bath 10 min to process, but some stoves it takes 20 to 45 min to get to a good boil, so remember this also!!!!

I come from a long line of salsa makers and have made various salsas for years.  This salsa recipie is the best I've ever tried.  I added two jalepenos for a little fire and doubled the recipie so I could get rid of some tomatoes I'd grown.  Only warning I can give any of you is if you double the recipe, make sure you have a BIG pot!  Love it, wouldn't change a thing.  Hopefully I can get some more tomatoes of of my garden again before it freezes so I can make another double batch.  A+  Thanks for the delish recipie.

This recipe is PERFECT as is!! A little sweet and a little spice. When I try recipe, I like to try it the way the recipe is written. If I don't like it, then I make changes. I don't like when people change 2, 3, 4 and so on of the ingredients and then rate it bad when they altered the recipe. I don't think thats fair to the creator either. I'm going to make a couple more batch AS IS and a couple of batches, but add  corn and black beans. Thank You for sharing this AWESOME recipe. It will for sure be the go to salsa recipe in our house. Once you eat this, you will never want to buy store bought salsa again!

This is by far the best salsa I have ever made.  I really love the amount of heat it has.  I can't stand sweet salsa and this has just the right amount.  I made it exactly as the recipe called for.

I fed this to a bunch of cowboys, our boss and an executive chef. They all loved it. I was told to "keep track of that recipe".The chef said if you didn't want it quite so sweet, to add just a touch more salt. Great canning recipe!

Personally I though this salsa was too sweet. I would make it again, but I would cut the sugar back at least by half. I also added larger amounts of spices than what was called for, and I used extra jalapenos to add more heat.

I had made salsa before, but only from a pouch mix. I decided I wanted to try it from scratch, so I searched on the Internet for salsa recipes. This recipe was the first one I looked at. It sounded so good and got such great reviews, it was the only recipe I looked at. I made a batch, and now I'm back to add my own glowing review.  This salsa is FABULOUS! My 18-year-old son loves it and says it is the best salsa he's ever had -- he went through a pint by himself in two days -- and a friend of mine who said he doesn't usually like salsa all that much couldn't get enough of it and had me give him a pint.  I did alter the recipe a bit. Instead of the mild peppers, I used jalapenos from the garden. And I like cilantro in salsa, so I added some of that, but I think the cooking time took most of the flavor away. Next time, I'll add it closer to the end of the cooking time.  Now I'm trying to get my hands on more tomatoes so I can make more Rockin' Salsa, and I don't want to eat the store-bought and from-the-pouch salsa I already have. So, if you're looking for a good salsa recipe, look no more -- try this one! And many thanks to the submitter for sharing this recipe.

The recipe I have been looking for!  I have already made 3 turns of it and plan to make more.  I think it is comparable in heat to a medium salsa you would buy at the store.  I used a 12 oz. can of paste because it was all I had and it turned out thick enough.  I also used 3 regular onions.  We have enjoyed it with chips and it will be great with Mexican dishes.  Too spicy for the kids so I may try a batch with very little cayenne.  Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

I am a 1st timer canning salsa and I liked that this recipe had cumin so I gave it a try and it is sooooo good. Followed recipe, but left out sugar because I don't like sweet salsa. Also subbed jalapenos for banana and added 2 T of cilantro,  also added 5 garlic cloves. Added 3T of lime juice (at end of cooking time) Cooked for 1-2 hrs until I got the consistency that I like. I don't like watery salsa.  Decided to pressure cook just to be safe. Thanks for a delicious recipe.

I am editing my review to include all the things I changed.  I use 8 cups of tomatoes, 3 cups of onion and 2 1/2 c peppers. I usually use one Hungarian wax pepper, one half off a serrano and one smaller jalapeno chopped fine and the rest bell peppers.  I use 1/4 cup white or cider vinegar and 1/4 cup plus 3 tablespoons lime juice, and add finely chopped garlic, like another review suggested.  I use about one tablespoon cumin, 1-2 teaspoons of ancho chili, 1 heaping teaspoon Mexican oregano and cut the cayenne pepper down to 1 teaspoon and add a teaspoon of chipotle pepper.  With the hot peppers you don't need as much cayenne and the mix of hot peppers give a good flavor without being overly hot.

I also add just under 1/4 cup of white sugar and omit the brown sugar altogether.

I only use one can of paste and cook about 1 hour or so.  Three hours is way to long.  You want the salsa to have a thicker, not watery consistency but still have the integrity of the peppers.

I have made this salsa 5 times, doubling it the last 4 as it was so good!  I have friends that beg for jars of it, one who will eat a one litre whole jar in two days!  I misread the recipe the first time i made it and bought a jalapeno pepper to put into it instead of banana peppers - i didn't want to waste all my chopping work so added half the pepper diced up and reduced the cayenne pepper to half...it was a home run!  I have made it to the recipe once (just to see what the original was like) and 2 more times with the jalapeno - and the "mistake" version is my most requested but both are awesome.  I have also added a mix of yellow, red and orange peppers instead of the green, added all of the sugar and replaced the yellow onion with more white and red - and it was a different flavor each time but was really good too.  This is a very flexible and forgiving recipe which i know i will make over and over and over - planning my garden around it for next summer!!  Thank you!

Well two years later and i STILL get friends offering to buy any salsa i make.  I did plant a salsa garden this year and my first doubled batch is canned and being eaten already!  I added a full jalapeno and a habenaro pepper to a regular recipe and can't wait for the ones who like hot to try it.  For the garlic lovers, i added a tsp of minced garlic and doubled the garlic powder to an earlier batch to give it a really strong but tasty garlic presence.  I am being asked to do that again!

Great recipe!  This is my first time canning salsa and it turned out very successful.  I made a few alterations based on some other reviews.  I made a TRIPLE batch.  I omitted the sugar, added 6 cloves of minced garlic, 3 jalapenos.  At the end of cooking for an hour I added 1/4 cup lime, 1/4 cup lemon, and a tube of cilantro paste.  Turned out awesome!

Awesome flavor! I did NOT use any sugar, used about 3 large cloves of garlic instead of garlic powder and added the juice of 1 lime. I also used apple cider vinegar instead of white. I did not use the variations of onions and peppers, just used what I had in my fridge and garden (medium hot peppers). I peeled most of the tomatoes and left some unpeeled. Next time I will not peel the majority because the lycopene is in the skin of the tomato! I chopped the tomatoes, peppers and onions in the processor so you didn't even notice the skins. I upped the cumin to 2 tsp. and omitted the cayenne since I used all moderately hot peppers. I cooked everything down until my likeness for the thickness and then processed in a water bath for 20-25 minutes.

Loved this!! I made 2 batches last summer and now I'm about to make it again.  I love using it in tortilla soup instead of regular canned tomatoes, and in any mexican recipes.

I made this salsa from tomatoes and fajita peppers from my garden.  It was a little sweet at first, but after setting up a couple of days, it was great.  I love a chunky salsa.

My first attempt at canning anything and this was easy and tastes great.  I modified just a little since my grocery didn't have fresh banana peppers.  I used 4 Hungarian hot peppers and a tad more cayenne pepper.  Also, I used 5 lbs of fresh Roma tomatoes. It is a sweet salsa with a kick aftertaste.  It'll creep up on you...in a good way.  Very similar to Tostitos or Bravo salsa in consistency.  I cooked for 2.5 hours and then canned.  Perfect outcome...my family keeps stealing jars of it when they come over ;)

Awesome salsa!  I stayed pretty much with the recipe as written except used 5 garlic cloves instead of powder and lemon juice in place of the vinegar.  I was going to cut down on the sugar, but after my daughter taste tested and I ended up using the exact amount called for.  No more fine tuning, perfect...will definitely make this salsa often!

This is the best ever salsa recipe! I first made this with my in-laws (we had never made salsa before). We were blown away with how great it turned out. 

I now make double batches any chance I get. I give out jars to friends and family, who keep asking me for more. Several people have asked me for this recipe, and friends of friends are even requesting it. It's quite the talk of the town!

The changes I make are eliminating the banana peppers, and possibly adding one jalapeno for a little kick. I also use a food processor to chop the onions and peppers up (this saves a lot of time/headache). I also add a bunch of cilantro about 30 min before it's done cooking.

I have also cooked this in a large crock pot with the lid sideways. It works fine, but takes about double the cooking time.

I really wish I could give this recipe more than five stars!!

Big props for this recipe, probably the best that I've ran across! We killed 2 jars of this in about an hour at Thanksgiving and there were only 3 of us. This salsa has an amazing taste with the perfect amount of heat.

I made some changes as well just out of personal preference. I did cut the sugars back some as others had indicated. Also substituted fresh habenero peppers from the garden instead of banana along with some chilpotle peppers in adobo sauce which even enhanced the flavor just that much more. In addition we added corn, black beans and cilantro to our preference.

I think this will easily be my "go to" recipe for salsa from here on out so thanks for sharing!

Absolutely wonderful salsa, I left out all the sugar and added Jalapenos from my garden to it....I like my salsa a little on the hot side. I keep trying to can enough to get us through the winter but it's flying out of the pantry faster then I can keep up.....making more today. Thanks for the recipe!!!

The salsa was delicious! it was a great use of the tomatos and other vegetables in our garden. I put in half as many peppers, but I added a cup of corn to the salsa. I will definately make this again!

I started canning a few years ago and one of the first things I made was this salsa.  YUM!  Everybody who's tasted it says it's fabulous!  And I made it EXACTLY as written!  I'm going to pick tomatoes today to make my next batch.  Can't wait!

This is an amazing recipe for salsa. I used maple syrup instead of sugar. I also simmered for less than an hr. It does become a bit mushy. I used all white onions since I didn't have the others. I used all roma tomatoes. It has a "kick' to it but not too much. I used fresh garlic chopped instead of garlic powder. (6 buds) I will definitely make this again.

Excellent salsa. First time I made it, I omitted the sugar. I like my salsa spicy. The second time I made it I mixed up the peppers and added jalapeno and orange habanero peppers. With this combo, I added only the white sugar. Wow, those habaneros are spicy and the little bit of sugar offsets that just right.

LOVE this recipe, I cut the sugar in half did not use banana pepper but added 3 jalapeno peppers(seeds and all) instead and added 2 tsp cumin. I also used the juice of 3 limes and a little cilantro. I only simmered for 1hr. We like to add a some fresh tomato and a little fresh cilantro when we open a jar.I love this salsa and it would be good to use in chili or recipes that call for canned tomatoes it is very versatile.

My girlfriend and I used this recipe for our 1st time canning salsa. Good recipe, but a little too sweet for our taste, so we cut the sugar in half, added more onion and peppers, and it was really good! will use this recipe again next year!

I bit sweet for my taste. I made my 2nd batch with less sugar. Much better. I used 3 green peppers and 2 jalapenos. Just 2 onions. This made 8 pints of salsa using romas. I simmered 1 hour and it was thick enough for our taste.

Delicious.  Weighed 6 pounds at the green grocers = 20 medium sized tomatoes.  Used fresh garlic (5 chopped cloves) and 3T of brown sugar and 2T white sugar.  Will reduce sugar to 1T each next time.  Made 6 1/2 pints.  Next time will be soon!

Family, and friends love this salsa, and so I have made many batches over the last couple of years. I have even made it during the winter months using 6 pounds of canned Roma tomatoes.   I chop the whole tomatoes up, and then let them drain for about an hour.  I researched to see if it was safe to use canned, rather than fresh.  It is, but simmer time, I have reduced to 15 minutes so that the canned tomatoes do not turn to mush.  The flavor, and texture is still great.  After opening a jar, I add a fresh tomato or two if I have them on hand. Just wanted to share this idea!  Thanks so much for the great recipe!

Awesome recipe.  I made a few changes.. I added tomatilloes and corn, but kept everything else pretty much the same.  I tripled the recipe, and it is so good the jars are just flying off the shelf.

I have made this 2 years in a row with fresh tomatoes from my garden.  2 batches last year and 2 batches this year.  It turned out awesome all 4 times.  Sometimes I use all yellow onions because that's what I have on hand more often.  I've also used different types of peppers.  It always turns out great!

This is an awesome salsa. It is a sweet salsa recipe. 3 pints were eaten within 2 days by my family it is so good. If you dip your veggies in this you will eat them and not miss chips. It is also a thick salsa however I squeezed, seeded and drained my tomatoes.  Used Roma in 3 batches and regular round ones in second 3 batches.  The round ones needed a lot of squeezing and did not yield as much do to being a more watery tomato. Both types of tomatoes made a good salsa.

I used this recipe last year for my salsa. I made 75 pints of it. I still have a little left just enough to carry over until I start to make it again with this recipe. I drained the juice off of some and not on some for husband. I like it thicker than he does. This is the best recipe I found so far!! I took some to work and my friends loved it. The word of how wonderful my salsa was went around the factory really fast. I even had people asking to buy it. THIS IS A KEEPER FOR ME!!

Living overseas and can't buy my Newman's Peach salsa. This is a fantastic and easy stand-in and easily adaptable. I've made it with a little less tomatoes and 2-3 pounds of mangoes, I've also used a bunch of chipotle seasoning.  The tomato paste is absolutely crucial. I put some in the fridge and some in the freezer. I don't can, but this may have inspired me to start.

This was my first experience with the hot water bath process and I found these instructions to be easy to follow.  The ingredients in this recipe are versatile enough to change up.  I don't care for bell peppers so I used 6 banana peppers and one jalapeno.  We like our salsa sweet, so I kept the sugar as stated in the recipe.  There wasn't quite enough to get a full 8 pints, so we kept out the last bit (almost a pint).  Wanted to try it right away anyway - it was gone in 15 minutes!  We love it!  Probably won't change anything the next time I make it, which will be soon.

This salsa is excellent. BUT whatever you do, CUT down the sugar! I used 1 T. of each brown and white and it still has plenty of a sweet undertone to it. Otherwise great texture, thickness and flavor.

O...M...G!  This is amazing salsa!!  I add cilantro and jalapenos for our taste, use fresh garlic.  We don't add the bell peppers or banana peppers, just because that's not the taste we are going for, but I imagine you can't go wrong with this recipe!  Awesome!

Salsa turned out excellent. The only thing my husband and I would change is to put a little less sugar, but was still fabulous!

The first time I made this, my husband ate an entire pint in one sitting!   I'm making another batch today-the first only lasted a few months!  Headed to the farmers market to get my ingredients!  YUM! 

Only changes I made were using 1 green bell and 2 reds (I don't like green bell peppers) and I added 3 jalapeno peppers (no seeds) and cilantro.  Delish!

I love this salsa! I did make a few changes ( no sugar, use chopped garlic instead of powder and add cilantro and lime)....I've made it 5 times this summer:)

LOVE IT! LOVE IT! LOVE IT!  I changed it up a little bit to make it pretty I put a green bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, and a red bell pepper.  All in all we had all 6 pts. gone in a week!  I am making more again this week and have already started planning our garden for next year to be sure that there will be plenty of fresh ingredients.

Easy recipe. I used 1/4 cup of white sugar and no brown sugar and it was perfect amount of sweetness. I also did the lime juice, garlic cloves, 4 jalapenos instead of bannana peppers, and added extra fresh cilantro about 3 tbls. I only cooked on the stove for about 20 minutes so the onions and peppers in the salsa stayed nice and firm. Great recipe.

Loved this recipe.  Only thing I did to it was add two jalepeno peppers.  It was delicious.  Hubby and I were dipping chips as it was simmering on the stove.  I have never tried making salsa, and now I am going to make it every year.  Yummy!

I found my batch tasted more like tomato sauce than salsa. It was too sweet and the tomato paste gave it a pasta sauce taste. I was exited to try it but was disappointed.

I think I have reviewed this recipe before but worthy of 5 stars again. If you're looking for a way to use up the extra tomatoes in your garden this is the finest way I can think of to do so. Awesome salsa!!!!

I canned a large batch of this mostly following the recipe. In the middle of December in Ohio, I popped open a jar and it tasted just as good as the day I canned it!

Very good. I used double the cumin, no cayenne, six jalapeños, one bell pepper and only two table spoons of brown sugar, no white sugar. Marc would prefer no sugar and chunkier. I boiled for three full hours. I did not have tomato paste so I used some homemade tomato sauce. Overall, this is a hit. Worth making again whe the garden puts out lots of tomatoes and peppers.

I've tried many salsa recipes, looking for "the one" that would satisfy my entire family's taste buds.  This is it!!  Hubby, kids & spouses as well as grandkids love this!  I use my own tomatoes & peppers which makes it extra delicious.  May try to grow my own onions this year as well.

This is absolutely by far the best salsa I made. I am new to canning and wanted a simple, easy recipe that tasted great. The salsa came out so good. My family and friends can't wait for me to make another batch. I wouldn't change anything.

The best salsa from allrecipes so far...cut back on the sugar, half of each was plenty. Added 4 jalapenos, 2 with seeds and cut back on the cayenne to please all the non "hot salsa lovers"...was perfect! I could add more heat for the "hot batch" no problem with more cayenne or hot peppers...good stuff

I'm a newbie at canning so wasn't sure about quantity of ingredients, duh. Small peppers, onions? Med? Lg? So i guesstimated and for other newbies I ended up with 3 c onion (per other reviewer), no room for the yellow, 3 cups assorted peppers from garden but could've added another cup i think. Everything else was the same. The salsa is excellent, definately a medium, NOT mild, not runny or to thick but yielded only 4 1/2 pints. A lot of time for so little but very, very good.

This salsa is the best I have made.  I did change the recipe a little.  I took out the white sugar as it was just to sweet for my taste, and instead of the cheyenne I used fresh hot peppers to the heat I wanted.   Either way you do it, it is very good.   Make more than you think you will need, cause it will go fast.

Great recipe!  I substituted cayenne for fresh jalapenos, about 6 seeded, and added cilantro.  I only added 1T of the sugars too.  I needed to do something with all my garden tomatoes.  This was perfect.  Thanks!

This is one of the best recipes of salsa! Thanks for sharing it. I followed the recipe most of the time but here are some changes I did. After peeling the tomatoes I let it rest them for about 30 mts. In the meantime I had chopped all the veggies. As I recall some of the reviews had said it was a bit soggy. So to avoid this. First of all I put all the ingredients in the pan and let them fall a bit.  Tomatoes and tomatoe puree I added to the pan after about 20 mts. Then I added the chopped tomatoes after draining out about 2 cups of clear juice from the botton of them. So this made the salsa not very runny. I just took brown sugar and avoided the white sugar, took fresh pressed garlic and a big bunch of fresh korainder. My husband is very hard to please. But he and my girls loved the recipe. Definitely a keeper. It makes great home made gits too. Thanks again :)

I just made a batch of this after a fellow cruiser sent me a jar that she had made. It's a sweeter style of salsa. I only used 1 teaspoon of cayenne pepper.

I used this recipe to can for the first time, and it was nearly fool-proof. I didn't use the same ratios of vegetables and added a bit or omitted spices. However, I kept the sugar amounts. My boyfriend loves it, and if there is ever a judge of food, he is it! Very customizable ~ I can't wait for the next round of tomatoes to ripen!

I love this salsa, it has just the right amount of sweet and spicy. So easy to make. I made this recipe 3 times this season. Everyone eats it up so fast i have to make more.

Great recipe!  I halved the sugar, used jalepeno peppers instead of banana, and doubled the cumin.  Very tasty, so glad I found it.

Made this today and it is really good.  I will use this recipe for my salsa canning from now on.  I left out the sugar, I thought it was good without it.  I also used three jalapenos which I seeded and deveined.  The heat was hot enough for my husband, without chasing the kids away.  I doubled the batch and got 16 pints.  I still have some tomatoes leftand I'm thinking about making some more to give away.

I had never made salsa before,but had so many tomatoes from our garden I was looking for a new way to use them. My family never cared for salsa, that is until they tried this! Now they can't get enough!!! I made a double batch & did add a few more peppers (a couple really hot ones too) just because they were in the garden. I've had so many requests that next year I'll make several batches! P.S. Makes a great Mexican Pizza! Just use instead of traditional sauce!

Great tasting salsa!  However, it is way too mild for my crowd so I add lots more cayenne and hot diced peppers (jalapeno, sarento) and hot sauce (Franks or Tabasco).

This is great salsa with a nice heat to it. I followed the recipe as it was written and would not change a thing.I do not see where it was to sweet unless they measured wrong so stick to the recipe. It made more that stated though which is a good thing.

I made a half batch, due to fact I didn't have enough fresh onions or tomatoes. as called for. I substituted 4 jalapenos(deseeded) & combined cumin with green cilantro. I also added can puree & small can tomato sauce to make up for shortage of fresh tomatoes. The above recipe didn't call for any jalapenos; sorry but Banana peppers just don't cut it for heat, that's primary reason for 3 star.
Will have to make the full recipe next time, but still skip banana peppers

Amazing flavour but I would omit the sugar completely or put 1/8 of what the recipe says. I have a sweet tooth and I found this too much, Other than that I would use more spice (my preference, I love things spicy). Dice/chop things on your preference of chunkiness. I found that the bigger the tomato, (don't bother peeling), the chunkier the salsa!

I made this last year and canned them in pint size jars.  I gave a few of them out to my friends and I was told it was the best salsa they had ever had.  Time to make more for the upcoming winter.  thanks for a great recipe Tami.

This recipe was FAR from what the other comments say they are! This salsa was SUPER sweet even with the sugars cut in half, was super thick and I think Pace's picante sauce is actually better. Suggestion- No sugar, no tomato paste, and add some spicy peppers!

This is a good salsa recipe. I will cut back on the Cumin next time - personal preference. I cut back the sugar by about 1/2 and that was just right for us.

My whole family loved this salsa.  I did cut down on the sugar like other people said. I put 2 Tablespoons of each and it was just about right.  At least that is how we liked it. It was a little sweeter still than the store bought but I thought it gave it something special.  Thank you so much we will be making more of it in our house!

This salsa is a big hit around my house. Thank you for sharing! I did find it a bit sweet, so the second time I made it I only used 1/4 brown sugar and no white sugar. Yummmmmy!

Bland in flavor and very little spice when following the exact recipe. We fixed it with Cilantro, Lime, and Jalapenos.

A little too sweet.  Needs a little more kick to it.  Otherwise, my husband loves it.  Add some more hot pepper for you liking.

This is a wonderful recipe. I had never made salsa before, so I called my brother to ask if I really had to PEEL the tomatoes...he said yes, but it is easy if you put them in boiling water for 2-3 minutes, then put them in an ice bath to cool. Core the tomatoes and the skin will slip right off. I also could not find fresh banana peppers, so used ones that came in a jar. This salsa was great fresh, but I did cook it, although I did not simmer for 3 hours. Worth the effort!

I made this twice, once as directed, it was too sweet, the second time I omitted the sugar, and the tomato paste, and just added a few more tomatoes. also the second time I used Jalapeno peppers, and not the banana peppers. the tomatoes and Jalapeno peppers came from my garden. I did not need the cayenne pepper when I added the Jalapeno peppers.

FABULOUS!! I used 2 jalapenos in place of the banana pepper, and plan to add an additional one next time (no seeds) - wonderfully sweet, and could use more heat so can stand the substitution. If you want a sweet salsa, this is the recipe for you!!

THis is great.  Our grocery stores were out of banans peppers (small town) so I put a couple of jalapenos in and added a handful of cilantro.  I also cut the sugar down a bit and used the splenda brown sugar.  Will probably ccut the sugar down a little more next time because we tend to go pretty easy on the sugar.

I enjoyed snacking on this all the way through! I followed other's advice and not only cut back on the sugar, but substituted 1/4 of pure maple syrup in place of the b & w sugars.  Also added 1/2 jalapeno pepper - right amount of zip.  Makes 6- 500 ml jars.

We loved this salsa my 9yr daughter used this recipe for her 4H project.  It won best of show and 1st place. We omitted the sugar, brown sugar and banana peppers and added jalepeno's it still had a sweet taste.

I read the reviews and using a few suggestions made some changes, and it turned out delicious.  I omitted all the sugar, used 2T cilantro, 3T lime juice, 6 cloves minced garlic, 3 cps red onion, 2 1/2 cups peppers, and only 12oz paste.  Following suggestions, I too cooked for 20 minutes and thought the flavor and consistency was 'perfect'.  The only odd thing is it resulted in 5 1/2 pints instead of 8 pints.  Next time I'll double the batch.

1st batch turned out good.  2nd batch omitted the banana peppers and added 8 addt'l jalapeno peppers and 2 pears diced up like the sweet but not too sweet taste then POP the heat hits you in the back of your tongue and throat!  Great Recipe!  Will make again.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

Too tomato-y and too sweet. I probably did something wrong with it, but out of five salsas that I made, this was the 2nd least favorite of the bunch. Four other friends tested this with me and agreed.

Average salsa, added more heat and cumin to bring up the spice level. Other ingredients like jalapeños, corn, black beans,etc can be added.

love this recipe thanks. as noted I did make minor tweaks as I dislike sweet salsa and turned out amazing. just a note I peeled and chopped all tomatos then let drain over night. this greatly helped with less runny salsa.

I’ve made it twice once as listed.  The second time with apple cider vinegar, fresh garlic and different peppers.   I prefer fresh garlic and will make again and use more hot peppers for some heat.   Thank you.

I made only half a batch - 3.5lbs of tomatoes (Celebrity and Rutgers mix) because I expected NOT to like it.  It was AMAZING!  Used 1 green pepper, 2 jalapenos (one with seed, one without) and one pepper that I have no idea what it was.  It looked like a banana pepper but was much bigger...about 6" long.  No label on it at the grocers...someone said it was a "Hatch" pepper.  I de-seeded it too.  Used just over 2 cups of onion...red, yellow and white.  Used 1 1/2 cans of tomato paste and 1/4 cup white vinegar, then the seasonings as per the recipe but added some oregano.  DID NOT USE ANY SUGAR!  And I don't think I would have like it if I did!  This still filled up my Dutch oven to the 1/2 way mark so still made quite a bit.  DEFINITELY will make again with all the ripe tomatoes I cannot use!

1st time canning anything and I ROCKED the Rockin Salsa! Neighbor gave me 3# tomatoes and a large quantity of a mix of jalapenos,  serranos and banana peppers so I adjusted the recipe to 1/2. After seeing reviews, cut the sugar to 1T mix of white and brown sugar, used 11 of the pepper mix, no bell pepper and added cilantro for last 15 mins. Had hubby taste after 1 hour 15 mins and texture/heat was perfect. Water bath for 15 mins for my altitude (2250). 4 pint jars of heaven. Thank you!

Very flavorful.  I roasted some hatch chilies and put them in.  I also roasted the jalapenos.  At the very end, just before spooning into the jars, I threw in some cilantro.  
My only complaint is that it was WAY too sweet.  I am not sure why sugar is even an ingredient on this recipe.  Next time I will not add any and maybe sub out the white vinegar with apple cider vinegar.

Have made this different times over the years. Only changes I make is using splenda brown sugar for all the sugar. Sometimes my tomatoes are so sweet I don't use sugar at all. I found its best flavor comes from  using all roma tomatoes.

I am cooking the jam down now. I started off with making 2 types. One following the recipe exactly and one with apple added. I found that the onion only was getting mushy way faster than the apple added one. I just combined the two and am very happy with the results. I have lots of Walla Walla Sweet onions from my garden along with apples from the tree. I hope this freezes well.

Fantastic Recipe.  Second time making it. I added some Cilantro and used two Jalapeno peppers to give it a bit more kick but it was PERFECT just as the recipe is prepared.  Love it!  Had to make a double batch this year to keep up with the demand!!

I did take note of the garlic powder and used fresh garlic.  I also used jalapeno peppers in it.
I liked this recipe so much, I decided to use a variation of it for Bloody Mary mix.  I now have 5 quarts of that canned as well.
I know its going to be a good winter now!!

This salsa is awesome!  It is nice and spicy and if you cut the vegetables a little on the large side, they stay a little crunchy.

Doubled the batch, added a bunch of cilantro, and one jalapeno. I used low/no acid yellow tomatoes because I needed to use them, about 13 pounds. I first thought I was making yellow salsa but after adding the tomato paste, the salsa turned red. Wish I had taken the time to read the reviews and had removed some of the liquid plus cutting the sugars down because it is a tad sweet but not too bad. I will make again but will add more heat, thanks for this great recipe!

Very tasty, used 3 fresh cayenne peppers, 2 jalapeños, about 2 tbsp of cilantro, and 1/2 a tsp extra of both cumin and cayenne pepper, followed rest of recipe as stated. Will definitely make again, may need to add more peppers still because we like a warm medium to hot salsa.

I made this last year and about to make another batch. I like to spice it up a notch and add chopped jalapenos and  can half the pot.  Then add a couple of Habaneros in the other half of the pot. 
I gifted a few jars for Christmas and everyone loved it!

This is one of my favorite salsa recipes. I can make it as hard or as mild as I  wish.  Sometimes I mix it up a little bit,  I add roasted corn to it.

I'm only rating four because I did make some changes.  This recipe is a lot of effort, but you get lots of salsa.  I followed other peoples advice and reduced the sugar.  I didn't want to omit it because I've heard that sugar changes the flavour of tomatoes, but I've had good, sweet salsa before and thought it would have been great salsa if it wasn't so sweet.  I also like it hot, so instead of 2 banana peppers and 3 green peppers I added 3 jalapeños, 6 serrano and 2 sweet peppers (I didn't have green peppers, so I used 1 orange and 1 yellow). I also simmered the salsa with 5 whole serrano peppers and removed them when complete.  Simmered the salsa for at least two hours.

I give this recipe 5 stars mainly because it is excellent for non-Texans.  I am from Texas and grew up cooking Mexican food.  I made some changes...  Sorry.  I removed the sugars and banana pepper.  I cut the cayenne in half because it gives heat with no flavor.  I like it hot but I'd rather use jalapenos or chipotle peppers for heat because they also add flavor.  I like to see that it is chunky because that is the way it should be.  Also, look for a good Pico de Gallo recipe.  It is great with Mexican food.  It is very good with my substitutions and deletions but then I have different expectations of Salsa.

Wish I found this recipe earlier in the garden season!  I didn't follow the recipe exactly as I was trying to use up all the last tomatoes, peppers and such from the garden so my batch made a little more than the traditional recipe made.  BUT having said that it was still the very best salsa I've ever tried.  I honestly don't think you can go wrong with the recipe as I had all that was needed and then some of different veggies and it still came out OUTSTANDING.  Thank you for submitting this recipe!!

Excellent with minor changes. Read reviews and reduced sugar to 2 tablespoons of each, white and brown. Used fish peppers (10-15) from the garden, removed majority of seeds. Used apples cider vinegar rather than white. Definitely will make again when cupboard runs low.

I made this salsa with my bumper crop of tomatoes this year.  It was a nice mildly sweet & spicy salsa.  My family and friends loved it.  I would not change this recipe except for adding more heat to some of the batch for my heat loving friends & family. 
I will definitely make this again!

Very good recipe. Scared to start this as I have never tried canning before. Easier than I thought. Starts out somewhat sweet but then you can taste the heat. I added two jalapenos. Will definitely be making this again soon.

This is our main salsa recipe and everyone we share it with loves it. We start with the basic recipe but substitute yellow, red and orange peppers for all but one of the green peppers. We also add one jalapeño and one Serrano pepper instead of the banana pepper. For tomatoes, we use only Romas and they are fantastic in this recipe. No change in seasonings, but we hold on the sugars because the colored peppers are sweet enough. Cooking only for 1 to 1 1/2 hours at most before canning. I recommend cooling down some for taste testing before canning - just in case you need to add anything more!! Great recipe!!!

Great recipe! We added some more peppers because we like our salsa a little spicier. Was super easy and pretty fun to make! Be sure to give the tomato paste plenty of time to marry with the veggies. Otherwise it tastes kind of sweet.

I made this as written, and it was WAY too sweet - more like barbecue sauce. My daughter loved it, though! I did can it all and I'm sure I'll find a good use for it. I made it again without the sugar and it was better, but still a bit sweet - probably because I used fresh garden tomatoes. I also used 3 jalapenos instead of the cayenne, which was yummy. I like it best with a some chopped fresh tomatoes and fresh cilantro.

I've been making it for several years and usually I stick to the recipe as much as possible. I vary the amount of hot peppers so we have a sweet or a hotter version. We use it as salsa or even pasta sauce. I never had a jar going bad. It is delicious and everybody we share it with loves it. Great recipe!!

This  Rockin' Salsa is so good that we have planted nothing but tomatoes in 1/2 of our garden  for this recipe. We are on our second season, so it has been 2 years, and well worth it!  A family favorite, everybody begs for a jar of salsa to take home or back to college. For all those who think it is too sweet, I agree! I simply omit the sugar all together. Problem solved.

Everyone who tasted it loved it.  I think the sweetness is a good thing. I used less cayenne than called for--less than half a teaspoon.

I've made this twice now. First time I peeled the tomatoes and added no sugar. 2nd time I didn't peel the tomatoes, still no sugar. Both came out great. Don't know why sugars needed but it is GREAT without.

If you like sweet salsa this is for you.  I didn't add the brown sugar or the tomato paste as I prefer a more watery salsa.   By omitting these ingredients it had more of a "tomato" flavor.

Turned out to be a very fresh and delicious salsa that my family loved! I followed the recipe except I also added 1/2 cup of fresh lemon juice, 2 jalapeños, seeds removed and chopped, 1-1/2 tsp oregano and 1-1/2 tsp parsley.   Also, I boiled the mixture for only 15 minutes instead of the recommended 3 hours.

This recipe did turn out really awesome! I did follow the other reviewers suggestions and put in half the amount of sugar. Next time I may only add a quarter of the sugar. I also used 4 jalapeno peppers instead of banana peppers because we like a lot of spice. I will definitely use this recipe again in the future!

I love this recipe! I have made it 3 times this summer and have canned around 30 pint and quart jars. Everyone loves it so much that I can't keep it long enough to store! The first batch was really good, the second batch I burned and everyone thought I put BBQ sauce in it. So to redeem myself I made another batch. I added jalapeños and a quart bag of frozen sweet corn. Also I use 2 or 3 large sweet Marconi peppers and omit the banana peppers. This was by far the best salsa I've ever had.

The only change I made was using jalapenos instead of banana peppers because that's what we grew. It's easy to modify the amount of peppers to get the called for spice level. Everything else I followed exactly and this was fabulous! People who've eaten it have asked for the recipe because it's so "on point". I wish I could take the credit. Thanks for the recipe. It's a keeper.

This is a great recipe but like everyone else I did tweak it quite a bit to our tastes.  We chopped the vegetables and peppers the day before.  The next day I drained the chopped vegetables and tomatoes in cheesecloth.  I simmered the mixture for about 20 minutes.  Having drained it before made it not as runny and just the right consistency.  I made this with only 3 tablespoons of sugar and 1 tsp of cumin.  Made it last year with all the sugar and it was way too sweet.  I used Serrano Chili peppers, Jalapeno peppers, and green peppers.  We did not remove all the seeds because we like the heat.   I added 1/2 cup more white vinegar andI also added 1/4 cup of apple cider vinegar.

Great Salsa!  Not too spicy!  We don't care for lots of 'hot' and this recipe is easy to adjust.... It is perfect.... just the right amount of alittle spice with sweetness!  I've made this at least 6 times!

Loved it, however, I added more fresh peppers and 1 small can drained jalapeno peppers.  The longer salsa cooks, the more heat is cooked out of the peppers.  so adding extra actually gave it a nice,not overly strong, kick.  Would definitely make it again.

This is truly a great recipe loved by the many I gave jars to! I have made several batches now. After reading many reviews the only changes I made was fresh garlic instead of garlic powder, cut the sugar in half, and added fresh lime juice. Absolutely great recipe!!

I think I would rate this a 5, but I made some changes that caused it to be almost too hot and spicy.  I was afraid that this would be too sweet based on the reviews listed.  And because we like things hot and spicy, I reduced the sugars by about 1/2 and added about 8 jalapeno/Serrano peppers with the seeds and membranes.  I substituted for 1 of the green peppers by using in total about 8 hot banana peppers (seeds and membranes too).  I can tell you it's very hot, without much of a sweet flavor at all.  I also added 5 garlic cloves and 1/4 c. fresh lime juice and 3 T. bottled lemon juice to increase the acidity as per others suggestions.  Used only all yellow onions because that's what I had on hand...and doubled the cumin due to taste preferences.  I know that this salsa will get hotter in time and that thought makes me concerned that we won't be able to tolerate it.  I plan to add store bought salsa (mild) to it if that's the case.  I also only used 2 cans of tomato paste, but wish I'd used 3...it was a bit runny in consistency.  Only cooked for 1 hour per others suggestions...but the chunks of tomato totally disappeared.  The next time I will make it chunkier by maintaining larger pieces of tomato.

I used this recipe as a guide for quantity and made so many changes, I think I created a whole new recipe! I didn't worry about acid content because I freeze my salsa- you get a true burst of garden freshness with frozen salsa. Here are my changes: I deleted garlic powder and added 6 huge cloves of garlic (diced); I added 1/2 bunch of cilantro (chopped); I deleted the cayenne pepper but  added 10 thinly sliced jalapeños and one red hot chili pepper; deleted the vinegar but added the juice from 2 limes; my garden tomatoes are very sweet so I reduced the sugars to just 1/2 T of white; reduced the salt to 1T. I had never thought to add tomato paste to my salsa and was curious (and a bit concerned about possible bitterness) - but I love how it thickened my salsa! I had also never added cumin to salsa and I love the depth of flavor this adds.

I'm an old Texas gal and salsa is practically served with every meal.  I must say this is very good.  Thick with just the right amount of kick.  Would definitely make this again. I gave a neighbor some and he posted on FB that he loved it too and from a man that doesn't say much, he was impressed as well.

I love this recipe. It's quite time consuming, but very much worth it. Everyone that tries it love it. the first time I made it I followed the recipe exactly and it was very good. I have also altered the recipe by using one red and two green peppers. I have added jalapeños and have reduced the sugar. The thing about this recipe is that you can cha your liking.

Sweet & spicy!  This is my first year growing tomatoes and first time trying canning on my own.  I'm sitting here with fingers crossed, hoping the jars seal.   I think I waited too long for enough tomatoes to ripen to make this.  Some of my tomatoes turned to mush.  That being said, I didn't need the 3 cans of tomato paste, I only used 2.  I agree with others that it is a bit too sweet, but it is still really good.  I think I might even use it as sloppy joe sauce!

This recipe is so tasty and so easy. I have received so many compliments on this salsa. People ask for the recipe all the time. It's definitely a sweeter salsa and isn't spicy at all (so if you want spicy this is not the recipe for you). Might be the best recipe I've found. Love it.

I doubled this recipe with a few changes.  I didn't have the banana peppers so substituted with serrano, jalepeno and red chili peppers and I always put in more than any recipe calls for. This  added a nice touch of heat that we love in our salsas.  I make several different salsas that are tried and true and this salsa will be among my favorites!

Love Love Love this recipe! My husband and I make a day of it and we each make our own batches with little tweaks. He likes a little more spice and adds jalapeño peppers to his and a little less sugar. I like it with a little less cayenne. Give this one a try, you will not be disappointed!!

this is an excellent basic recipe! Sugar should depend on how sweet your tomatoes are. to make a little hotter i added a dried thai chili pepper during the cook stage and removed before canning.  that balances out sweetness as well. I have made this several times. yeah it rocks!!

I did make some changes and had to adjust amounts as I didn't have enough tomatoes from the garden at the time. I cut the sugar way back as we don't like sweet salsa. I omitted the jalapenos and added green chiles.  The salsa turned out great!

This is an awesome salsa! Delicious as a dip or added to salads, scrambled eggs, etc. I followed the recipe as written, letting it simmer for two and a half hours, and stirring frequently. It turned out beautifully! Tami, you have a winner on your hands here. Thanks for sharing your great recipe!!

It's peak time for salsa making right now with fresh ingredients from the farmers markets and personal gardens. I made some yesterday with this recipe as a starting point and I took into account what some of the reviews stated and my own personal taste for salsa. Here are the changes I made:  I used 1 red onion and 2 sweet onions (vidalìa), I used 4 jalapeños and 1 Anaheim peppers, I used fresh garlic, about 1/4 cup cilantro, 1 tsp sugar, and half the called for amount of salt. I used my food processor for everything and I don't skin my tomatoes but I do squeeze out the liquid before chopping. I also only cooked for about 15 to 20 minutes since I squeezed out the liquid and didn't need to cook it out. Everything else I kept the same. In my opinion if you cook the ingredients too long it ends up tasting like you used canned, store bought ingredients rather than fresh.  This made a total of 9 pint jars for me and left me a little to "taste test". It was delicious.  I also want to clarify why I used different ingredients, it was because that was what I found at the farmers market and what we grow in the garden.

This was great! I cut the recipe in thirds. I didn't have the white or red onion on hand, but it's good with just yellow. I have seen some comments about the sweetness. I like it as sweet as it is.

A very good salsa and I'm very grateful for this recipe.  I used the sugar as indicated, but I think I will just go with the brown sugar and leave out the white sugar entirely, next time.  Just a tad sweet for my taste, but that's part of the fun of discovering new recipes:  deciding what works for you and making your own version of it.

All-in-all, a really nice recipe for a great salsa and one that will sure to be a hit if you give it a try!

I canned 5 gallons of this stuff (3 batches of this recipe doubled!).  My husband's go to snack is chips and salsa. I  hated how we went through so much salsa, so I found this recipe. I DID make some minor changes:

For a DOUBLE batch I use 2 Tbsp brown sugar and 2 Tbsp white sugar. I also brought cumin down to 2 tsp and halved the cayenne down to 1 Tbsp.  I found that the volume of bell/banana peppers came to around 5 cups, and the onions came to 6 cups. Again, all these are for a DOUBLE recipe! A double recipe yielded me a little less than 8 quarts of salsa. My husband loves this and is rationing his stash off carefully so he doesn't run out before I make more. I find this to be really acidic to my sensitive teeth, but he can eat it without a problem.

I made it to specs except I added some lime juice and cilantro, as one other reviewer recommended.  All I have to say is, it's not tomatoey enough.  My main complaint is the cumin and cayenne pepper together is way too much.  I would leave out the cumin.

I found this recipe when my dad's garden was full of tomatoes. My mom always complained that he planted too many tomatoes. Everyone loves his salsa and begs him for more. Now my mother wants him to plant more tomatoes, so they can make salsa!

This is my go-to salsa recipe! Thanks for posting it. I add fresh cilantro at the very end of cooking because I love it and salsa doesn't seem like salsa without it.  I prefer using plum tomatoes but when they are out of season I resort to canned whole tomatoes.

This is perfect as is..  But since I'm a Texan I had to add cilantro, garlic ,not garlic powder , (since I grow it and had plenty available) lime juice, jalapeno's, and pablano's...  I would not have added the tomato paste.But that's me.  I like my salsa chunky and loose..  Not thick and saucey.

Really enjoyed this recipe. I did replace the banana peppers with jalapenos for a bit of extra spice to it.

I made this and gave it as gifts with great compliments.  I did not think it was too sweet, just right with the kick from the onions and pepper.

This is the second year for this recipe for me. My family and friends love it. Very forgiving and a good basic recipe to jump off of. I only put 1 onion and 2 1/2 bell peppers in, and used 10lbs of tomatoes. Added 1/2 cup lime juice and anther tsp salt. I used chilli powder because I like it better. When cooked down, I used an immersion blender to make it very smooth. Like the Salsa in a restaurant. Very Yummm!

Absolutely awesome salsa! I picked a bunch of garden tomatoes and peppers to make this. I used 9 lbs, 3 banana peppers, 2 Georgia flame hot, 5 tequila sunrise sweet, added about a cup of freshly chopped cilantro. I only used a large candy onion and red zeppelin onion from our garden. I threw in a few Thai chili peppers. We let this set in the fridge overnight and were literally eating spoonfuls of it. I only cooked all the ingredients for an hour which was plenty of time. It made a total of 8 pints and 2 half pints. What a great recipe with the tomato paste, vinegar, & sugars. If it seems too sweet, just add a bit more salt. It is the BEST salsa my husband and I have ever had.

I used fresh garlic and adjusted the cayenne pepper to one teaspoon, because we like mild salsa.

I haven't tried it cold yet, but while it was cooking I was test tasting and at the last taste test it was super yummy. I took other suggestions and only added 1/4 cup brown sugar, used half chipotle and half cayenne for the spice, also added a half of some crazy hot pepper we grew in the greenhouse rather than banana peppers. Used only two cans of tomato paste because I took another person's advice and let the tomatoes drain for a few hours. The spice is just right, has a bit of heat but doesn't burn.

This recipe is fantastic.  I made this with garden tomatoes, peppers, garlic and a few hungarian hot peppers, its awesome.  Because my tomatoes are so ripe and sweet, I only added two tablespoons of sugar.  I omitted the brown sugar altogether.  I went for a thicker salsa and canned up 8 pints of it.  I eat it on eggs in the morning, so it wont last long!   A great recipe, just don't need all the sugar if making during the summer with homegrown vegetables.  If making in winter, that much sugar may be necessary with store bought produce.

I had a ton of fresh tomatoes so ended up making 3 batches of this recipe. The first batch I cut the sugar to 2T, used only 2 cans of paste, and added cilantro and lime (which I love in salsa). It came out sweeter than I though salsa should be so, the second I cut the sugar to just 1 T, but did everything else the same. The 3rd batch was the same as the second but I substituted hatch chilis for all the peppers and blended everything. I did find that only using 1T of sugar was plenty. It is a great recipe otherwise!

I read the other reviews, and as many have said, the kind of tomato will depend on how sweet the salsa turns out to be.  We made this salsa with our tomatoes from our garden and followed the recipe exactly.  Yes, the salsa is sweet when you first taste it, but then there's a kick of spice that's absolutely divine, the sweet then spicy combination is a perfect.  Word got out about our salsa we made, and now we have "orders" for the next batch.
Other reviews state you don't have to boil for so long, but I think that is dependent on how much natural water you get from your tomatoes, onions, green peppers, etc.  I did boil the whole 3 hours and we "lost" about 2 cups of water, which made the whole batch thicker and all the vegetables thoroughly cooked/softened.  A few compliments we received was how each bite was the same instead of the store bought stuff, that each bite's texture and taste is different because you get different amounts of peppers, onions, etc on your chip.  We will be making this again this weekend, a double batch this time.
One thing I am not sure of is the pounds of tomatoes listed, is that BEFORE boiling and skinning the tomatoes, or after?  I weighed before boiling, not after... think this time I'll weigh them after.

So good!  I did tweak it a tad as per some of the suggestions on here... I halved the amount of each sugar and I think I bought yellow hot peppers by accident.  I just seeded them really well.  The end result was amazing!  I will absolutely make this again!

I have never canned anything before, so this was my first attempt. I made only a couple of changes.  I left out the sugar because I do not like sweet salsa and I used jalapeno peppers instead of banana.  I thought it was good, but my husband thought it was too sweet! (even without the sugar!)  I think we just had a batch of really sweet tomatoes.  Next time, I will test the tomatoes before adding anything to them and determine if I need more vinegar or salt to cut down on the sweetness.  I actually thought it was pretty good just the way it is, but I do agree with him.  I can see why people think it's too sweet.  If they have sweet tomatoes and add the sugar... it would be way too much.

UPDATE:  I gave a couple jars of the salsa to co-workers and they said it is the best salsa they have ever had!

Yeah, this works just fine, and you can adjust the heat (pepperyness) to suit your taste. Great thing to do with that bumper crop of tomatoes in the garden. I like it with a touch less sugar (I use white sugar) and a bit of cilantro.  Save some more money and grow your own peppers and cilantro.

We have made this 3 years in a row.  Our family LOVES IT.  We leave the sugar (some reviews I'veseen cut the sugar) but we add some jalapeno peppers.  It's sweet and spicy.  --Nice kick without overpowering.

If you love a hearty medium salsa, this is your recipe!  We cooked the salsa by the book and I must admit I wanted to add some more kick to it, but I'm glad I didn't.  Turned out perfect; too hot for Mrs Johnson=more for me!!

Love this Salsa.  I read previous reviews and cut the sugars to 1 tablespoon each.  I also added jalapeno peppers for added zip.  Using my home grown tomatoes and peppers, it turned out wonderful.  I may never buy salsa again.

I made the recipe as written but switched out the hot peppers for mild. This recipe came out sweet, but was not overpowering. Mine however was super watery right from the start. Definitely drain your tomatoes, before adding in. Also in the future I would use Roma's, since they are not as watery. Good as written. Better with a few tweaks.

It is too sweet, so you do need to cut the sugar considerably. I used about a third of what was called for. I did not peel my tomatoes and it came out just fine. I am not a big fan of creating extra work for myself!

This was my first experience with canning. Due to our overload of fresh tomatoes from the garden, this was the perfect opportunity to give it a shot.  Delicious and easy!  We did add one jalapeno since we like things with a little spice and it was perfect.  We are planning to make some more this afternoon!  The quality is better than most store bought salsas! (Next time we are going to reduce the amount of sugar as a bit too sweet for us)

A 2 day 48 pound tomato  marathon with my sister on this awesome recipe. My sisters family loved what we did last year so much, so we did 4 times more. This time 4 different amounts of Chili-flakes instead of hot peppers. Mild 1/4Teaspoon to Extra strong 1-1/4 tsps per 12 pounds batch.

I loved this recipe!  This was my first time every making salsa and it turned out great.  I do think the amount of time suggested for cooking was really long as it thickened up a bit too much for my husband's liking.   A friend also made salsa at the same time I did and brought it into work to share. Shhhhhhhh but this recipe way better!!!  This is my go to recipe.  :) Won honourable mention at the Fall Fair with this recipe (first time I have ever entered at the fall fair)

This recipe was great. Wife and kids loved it.  The only changes that I made was not putting any sugar or brown sugar and I put 8 tablespoons of the cayenne peppers because we like it spicy.  I like the fact that you have canning directions too. I have never canned before and it was simple to do following your directions. Thank you for sharing that fantastic recipe for others to try!!!

I am not a salsa dip person, mainly cause I don't like spicy food, I didn't use the cayenne pepper, and half what it called for of the banana peppers, and it's perfect, just to my liking. My boys love it.

I loved this recipe with slight variations...I agree that cooking the veggies for 3 hours is too long.  An hour or so is plenty.  I added 2 chunks of fresh pineapple for a fruity undertone and slight sweetness, instead of all the sugar.  I also added some of the brown sugar, a few tablespoons and a tablespoons of  home made maple syrup.  It is a nice subtle taste.  I also added smoked paprika and some different peppers, but kept the tomatoes the same and I also added fresh sweet corn!  I reduced the garlic, since I dislike a garlic aftertaste that lasts overnight.  I used fresh, though, not powder.  I substituted lime juice for the vinegar and this , combined with the pineapple gave my salsa a very citrus undertone that is nice with a southwest flair.  The smoked paprika and roasted peppers added a chipotle component to the salsa.  It is a fun recipe to make and to add your own favorite flavors and textures.  It allows you to customize your salsa to your own and your family's tastes.  A bit sweet with some texture and some smoky goodness is how we like our salsa.

All in all a great starter recipe and one I have used twice now.  I will use it again next summer.  It is a great  way to use your garden surplus.

I made this, but reduced the amounts of each ingredient because I only wanted enough for my boyfriend and I. It was really good. :) To me, it tastes a lot like the salsa at La Carreta. I didn't have bell peppers or red onion on hand, so I left those out. My boyfriend also requested that it be a little hotter after he taste-tested the salsa I had made, so I added more banana pepper and cayenne, and I also threw in a little white pepper and some tabasco. I really liked it, and I am not a salsa eater. My boyfriend wants me to make it again.

Tried this recipe for the first time ever making salsa. My family loved it so much, I have to make more this weekend! Great recipe, I will never buy store brand salsa again. This was so easy.  This time I'm adding jalopenos instead of cayenne powder.

This salsa was disappointing. 1. no cilantro, 2. no jalepeno peppers, and 3. tomato paste.  but gave it a shot. I used a red and white onion and raw sugar only, nixed the banana peppers, sauteed the onions and green pepper in a pan, added the tomatoes, paste and spices, and voila! It tasted like tomato sauce. I even added cilantro to try and make it taste more like salsa... but it didn't help. Oh well...

Since I've not tasted it yet, I will give it 4 stars.  I usually read reviews first but didn't do it this time.  I followed the recipe exactly except I added roasted hatch chiles.  I hope it's not too sweet!  It was a little soupier than I typically like but if it tastes good, I can deal with that.  I might mention this was my first go around with canning salsa.  I chopped veggies FOR AN ETERNITY!  I sure hope the flavor of the salsa makes all of that time spent chopping veggies worth it.

I do love this recipe so I use it every year for using up my garden goodies. I add jalapenos for a bit of heat, swap out the powdered garlic for fresh and omit the brown sugar. S&P to taste. It is requested by friends who ask, "Did you make the salsa this year?".

I've made this recipe for the past 2 years and I LOVE it. A few alterations though that I think really make the taste (for me at least)is that I vary the pepper mix. I tend to add jalapenos in place of the green peppers and add more banana peppers to make up the difference. I just like the brighter taste, and I think the spice helps cut the sweetness. The other major change I make is the most crucial, and that's that I get rid of the sugar all together and replace it with maple syrup at a 3/4c maple syrup:1c sugar ratio. The slight smokiness from our maple syrup (home cooked) really seems to complement the peppers and keep the salsa from getting 'candy-like' sweet.

I just made this salsa recipe - my new favorite salsa!  I used our own home grown tomatoes - a new seedless hybrid variety that proved to be perfect for salsa.  Some alterations I made were:  I added fresh chopped cilantro,  only used 1 white onion, substituted jalapeno peppers for the banana peppers, used 1 green pepper and 1 sweet red pepper, and used 2 - 12 oz cans of tomato paste.  I agreed with some of the other reviews that it is a bit too sweet so I added more salt as 1 person suggested.  This salsa has a wonderful blend of flavors.

Excellent salsa. We made it again this year for the second time. This has been our favorite also. 

We added 3 tablespoons of lime juice for a nice touch.

This is great! It is a little sweeter tasting than store bought. Instead of the banana peppers (I didn't have any) I chopped up 2 jalapeno peppers (left in 1/3 of the seeds). It turned out great! The jalapeno's creep up on you because of the sweetness. My husband says it is sweet with a kick! KaPOW! It's an awesome recipe and I will be using it from now on. THANKS!!!

I've never made salsa before and I decided to try this.  My husband isn't a big salsa fan and he loves this recipe.  I didn't measure the ingredients exactly and it turned out great.  Just enough kick for my taste.

Wow!  This is better than anything you can buy in the store.  I only cut sugar in 1/2 and added a couple of jalapenos for some extra kick.  Everybody wanted more!

This is s great recipe giving a nice consistency and a good base for some alternatives.  I made four batches altering the amount of sugar (1/4 cup brown sugar only, left out thr cayenne pepper and substituted habenaro and ghost peppers (fresh) along with the juice of two limes, three cloves of garlic, and a handful of fresh cilantro (enough stems to fill the circumfrence of your thumb and index finger.

I love this salsa!  i've made it last year and this year, and I forgot how the balance of spicy and sweet are just perfect together.  I really appreciate the instructions on canning too, since i'd never done it before last year.  I was deathly afraid of getting everyone sick by not sealing the cans right, but we didn't have time to find out, my familly ate it so fast, the whole batch was gone in a week!  
Thank you for sharing!

Made a half sized batch of this using stuff from my garden.  Used a jalapeno, a habanero, a cayenne and a lot more tomatoes than onions.  Kept the rest the same, except I omitted the cayenne powder because I didn't know how hot it would end up.  It turned out awesome, and not all that hot but very sweet with a good bite.  

I don't even really like salsa, but I canned this stuff and I've personally eaten three jars this month.  Next time I'll make it hotter and give it out.

We are still loving it! Got 7 pints yield. This is an awesome recipe!! I'll just add that doing this alone, as I did, the prep time is much longer than 45 mins. I spent about 6 hours total from blanching tomatoes to dropping jars full of salsa into the water bath. I might be a little slow though.

Whatever the case, it is worth the effort ... DELICIOUS!!!

Canned 1 batch of Salsa.  It was so good, we had to can up another batch.  This is the best Salsa Recipe that we have ever had.  We threw out all other recipes for Salsa that we had.  This is the only we will ever use!!  We used the 1/2 the amount of sugar in the first batch and in the second batch we used what was called for.  We preferred the batch that used the full amount of sugar!!

After all of the raves for this salsa I was highly disappointed with the outcome. Too sweet by far, had a pastey consistency and taste and was all around very bland and lacked any spark at all.  It's not even worth altering the 
recipe to make it better... Just start over with something better. We will keep one jar but the rest is going for presents.

I am making my second batch of Rockin' Salsa and I can't say enough about the recipe!  It's perfect.  I did make one change.  We do not like garlic at all, so I simply skipped putting that ingredient in.
Thank you for posting this recipe.  Loving it in Vermont!

Great flavor and will definitely make again. I would describe this as a "cooking salsa " that I would use in a receipe. For chips and salsa I would prefer something with more heat !

i didn't care for this salsa at all. It had way to much of a tomato taste that it really hid a salsa flavor. It also have a pretty strong kick which I didn't want. I like my salsa a little more mild. Over all though I wouldn't have minded the spice if it would have had more flavor

I've been making this for a couple of years now, and I love it! I do tweak the ingredients and quantities a bit based on what I have available. I grow jalapenos and portugal peppers here in NH every year, so I use those, as well as sweet peppers. I use red or white onions, and I add extra seasonings. I've found that apple cider vinegar and lemon juice work just as well as white vinegar. I also agree with other reviewers who reduced the amount of sugar. This is an amazing recipe, and one I will continue to make for years to come!

As written it was quite mild for me, so I added 1 cup of jalapeños and some jalapeno powder and it was ok, not great.  I tried it first without the sugar as I did not want that many carbs, but it was quite bitter.  I think the bitterness came from the membranes of the peppers which I left in there, but I'm not positive.  The only other place it could be from is the tomato paste, which seems a long shot.  I omitted the salt as I am on a low salt diet and even with canned jalapenos it still came to around 50mg per 2 Tbs. serving.  Hopefully after it sits awhile it will seem hotter and a bit more flavorful.

Amazing salsa!  I used 2 red onions and 2 white onions, 1 red pepper and 1 green pepper, this is seriously the best salsa I have ever made, it's so good!

A little too sweet for my personal taste, but a huge hit with everyone!  I skipped the banana peppers and added four jalapenos instead, two with full seeds, and two with no seeds.  This added the perfect amount of heat for a wuss like me!

This was alright. Very easy to make. Way too sweet though! Next time I will cut the sugar at least by half.

This is my first attempt at salsa and absolutely love this recipe, it's easy to make!! I've made 2 batches, the first, I didn't measure the tomatos, it was good, but needed more kick, the second batch, I used the correct amount of tomatos and added cilantro and it's better, but I think it's still lacking something.  I'm going to make another batch this weekend and add a jalapeno from the suggestions indicated. My family and friends love this recipe.

This salsa is terrific.  We love it.  My only complaint is that it was too sweet for my taste.  I will cut back on the sugar next time.  I also added more garlic, because we LOVE garlic.  I can't wait for the rest of my tomatoes to ripen so I can make more! Thanks for the great recipe!

This salsa is wonderful! I tried the recipe as written and it's great!  For my tastes though, I think it's a little too sweet and could use a bit more heat.  I'll adjust and will definitely be making this again - thanks for sharing!

Tried it as written and did have a few comments about it being too sweet so next time will either omit the sugars or at least half them, but it was chunky, good flavor and had the right amount of kick for the crew around here. I'll definitely make it again.

Sorry - not my favorite.  After reading the other reviews I opted to add only a quarter cup of white sugar and omitted the brown sugar, and added only half a tablespoon of cayenne pepper.  The result was perfect as far as how sweet and hot it was, but I think the tomato taste is a little overpowering, probably because of the tomato paste.  It could also be that cooking for 3 hours is just too long and it had reduced too much.  I have tasted homemade, canned salsas that have a much more "fresh from the garden" garden taste.

Made 96 servings and used 9 lbs of tomatoes, 2 Tblsp sea salt, 1 Tblsp cayenne pepper, and 1 tsp cumin. Cooked for 2 hours and canned in pressure cooker for about 25 minutes. Made 12 pints and extra to snack on. It was a bit sweet so next time I would like to use 2 Tblsp brown sugar and 2 Tblsp white sugar for 96 servings.

This is the first salsa I have ever made.  I found it to be easy and a very good salsa.  tip for everyone out there... boil some water, drop the tomatoes in for about 20 seconds, then pull them own and dip them into an ice water bowl... the skins will peel right off.  Salsa has a kind of sweet taste and my kids really liked it.  I'll be keeping this recipe for my next batch of tomatoes from the garden next summer... and enjoying these all winter long!

The best salsa! Added 2 serrano peppers and it was perfect. Took about 4 hrs of simmering to cook off the liquid... well worth the time and effort!

Very good salsa recipe.  I canned my salsa and it turned out excellent.  It started out a bit too sweet for my taste, but the flavors blended better after it was in the refrigerator for a couple of days.  I will definitely made it again.
