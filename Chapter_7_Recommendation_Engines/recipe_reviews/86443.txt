These were delicious! 
I used fresh ripe peaches, sliced them in half, and filled the centers with a little bit of butter. Then I drizzled honey on them & sprinkled them with cinnamon. I put them in a foil packet and stuck them on my Cuisinart Griddler (with lid closed) on high for about 7 or 8 minutes.
I do think they needed a little bit of brown sugar, so next time I will add it and serve them over vanilla ice cream.

Delicious...but I added some sugar to them before grilling to get better color.  We added some vanilla ice cream.  Thanks for a delicious dessert.

Grilled peaches sounded strange, but we loved these. We used fresh peaches, placed them flesh down on the grill. We left them there for 6 minutes, then turned over, drizzled with the honey and cinnamon, and grilled an additional 5 minutes. They were great.

This isn't the most attractive dessert ever, but it's so incredibly easy and convenient. I cooked the packets in the oven along with a couple of other things I was baking. I wouldn't go out of my way to make it again, but it's good for when you have the oven or grill on anyway. Oh, I used fresh peaches. Thanks!

These were good.  I sliced mine in half, removed the pit, sprayed each with a little olive oil.  I mixed the honey and cinnamon together in a bowl with a little brown sugar.  I dipped each peach 1/2 in the mixture and layed them "meat" side down on the gril.  Beautiful grill marks and carmelization from the brown sugar. We served ours with ice creama and whipped cream. Very good!

Very good. I added some butter, just to get some richness. We had these out over the firepit at a BBQ. Turned out great. Very tasty, and really quick and easy :)

I used some peaches and nectarines that were going soft.  Cubed them and wrapped them in foil with brown sugar, honey and cinnamon.  Cooked on the grill for 10 minutes.  Very tasty!  Will make again.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.

This is one of those "why didn't I think of that?" recipes. So easy - yet so good! Did with fresh peaches and added butter per suggestion of one of the other reviews. Served this with ice cream. The perfect complement to the rest of my grilled dinner!

I have used this with both fresh and frozen and the fresh was much better for the flavor and the texture.

this was very simple to make. i do not like to use as much cinnamon as it recommends as it is a little too much for me, but it is wonderful to add to taste.

This was a nice recipe, but not so great.  It's a nice recipe to make if you have some peaches lying around.

I used fresh peaches, sliced them in half and squeezed honey into the dip where the pit was and added brown sugar along with the cinnamon.  I served it with ice cream.  We liked it, but it was hard to deal with the peach skins when eating it.  I thought it was pretty this way, but would have been easier to eat if I'd diced up the peaches.

Use fresh peaches and peel them! Like many others here, I added brown sugar to the peaches. If you are going to pair it with ice cream, make the peaches when you're making your dinner and make sure they cool down a lot so your ice cream doesn't melt!

I wish I had taken a picture because my product honestly looked amazing. I'll be making these again so I'll update the picture!

This was good but the timing on the grill was wrong.  I finally put all ingredients in a microwave safe bowl and nuked it for 3 minutes.

Very simple, very good.  I used fresh peaches and only cut 2, then just drizzled with honey and sprinkled with cinnamon--didn't measure, just used what looked good to me.  I love it!  Nice and sweet, a good treat for the grill.  I did cook it twice as long--my grill isn't doing well with the wind today or soemthing.  Thanks for the recipe!

I hate to be the voice of dissent, but this really didn't turn out for me at all.  I followed the recipe exactly:  used frozen peaches, cooked over a medium gas grill for 10 minutes, flipping after 5 minutes.  Well, when we opened the packet, the peaches were still cold, but everything had a smoky, burnt smell and flavor, although nothing was visibly burned.  We put it in the oven for about 10 minutes, which warmed up the peaches a little, but the taste was still kind of smoky/burnt tasting.  The texture and color was beautiful, but everyone in our house ate around the peaches and only had the vanilla ice cream.  Thanks anyway for the recipe.

We enjoyed the taste of the peaches and honey.  I pitted fresh peaches and we grilled them flesh side down and then flipped and added the honey and cinnamon.  I liked the peach texture remained and it didn't turn mushy.  A nice recipe that we will be using again.  Thanks, K Douglas for sharing.

great idea!  The peaches were perfect and very tasty.  I used fresh peaches from the farmers market-some peeled and some with skin.

Really good! I did make a few changes. I added brown sugar, more cinnamon, a splash of vanilla and used fresh peaches. I will try this with frozen peaches this winter. We were not using the grill so I heated peaches on top of the stove till heated thru. We do a lot of camp fire cooking and will try this on the fireside. I served these on top of waffles for Sunday breakfast. This was a hit! Will make this again!

This is an easy and wonderful summer dessert!  I added a tablespoon of melted butter and about 1/4 cup of brown sugar before I grilled the peaches, and it was perfect, served over vanilla ice cream.  I would certainly serve this to guests at a summer cookout!  Thanks for a great recipe.  It's a keeper!

Pretty good dessert. I added a bit of butter and 1T brown sugar. I'd probably cut the cinnamon down to 1T instead of the 2 called for in the recipe.

Have not tried yet, but am going to do these as a side with grilled double thick pork chops on a charcoal grill tonight.  Might marinate the chops in honey and peach juice/nectar with a bit of brown sugar for fun.  Will post a followup to be sure!

Delicious and easy!
I had some ripe peaches and wanted dessert so I searched and found this recipe.  Didn't follow to a T - I sliced one ripe peach and removed the pit, added butter to the pit center, sprinkled with turbinado sugar, cinnamon, a little ground ginger and drizzled with honey.  Placed in sealed foil and under the broiler for 10 minutes.  Delicious and great with vanilla ice cream on top, would also be great on waffles for breakfast. Low fat and tasssssty!

This was not very good using the frozen peaches, per the recipe, but it was fantastic with fresh peaches!

This was good, a little too much cinnamon for my taste.  Will try again with less cinnamon and some brown sugar.

I think this recipe is ok but nothing special. I used fresh peaches instead of frozen. I thought it came out mushy and too sweet. While it wasn't bad in taste, I will have to keep looking for something else.
