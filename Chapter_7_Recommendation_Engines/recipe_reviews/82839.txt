Yummy! We also like adding a little mayo, lettuce, tomato slices and mild banana pepper rings.

Yummy!  Made these for dinner last night along with "Roquefort Pear Salad" (absolutely amazing salad) also off this site.  Used what I had on hand, so I replaced swiss with muenster, and hubby wanted whole grain bread and I chose cinnamon raisin for mine for a different twist!  Spread regular yellow mustard and a bit of mayo on the toasted slices before broiling.  The sandwiches did get cold fast after broiling so I zapped in the microwave for 15 seconds each, did the trick! The cinnamon raisin bread was so yummy, I knew it would be, often when you cook a whole ham for Easter or whatever, you sweeten it with a glaze, so you kinda got that same effect with the cinnamon raisin bread!  Try this sandwich with that type of bread!

My husband made these for dinner (so you know they're easy to prepare!).  Make sure to slice the onion really thin, or else all you'll taste is raw, crunchy onion.  Also, 4 minutes was too long under the broiler - crust started turning black right after 3 minutes.  So don't walk away!!

What a coincidence, we just had these the other night.  The only thing I add to mine are sliced kosher pickles and tomato.  The mustard gives a nice tang, and the pickles give it a real crunch.  So easy to make, too.
