I could not get by the name.  Scots or Scottish is correct.  "Scotch" is a derogatory ten YES I was born and grew up in Scotland.  I am Scottish or Scots but NEVER "Scotch"

These are hearty cookies! Good with chocolate chips. But found that it needed about an extra 1 c oat flour (and so 1 more T sugar). Also made a vegan version with 1/4 c almond butter and 3 T applesauce in place of butter- 1/2 T oil for egg- and almond milk. Good!

the measurements are all over the place, the dough is really a lumpy batter and it didnt rise. the only way to sdave it at all is add a cup more flour and another half cup sugar, another tablespoon of vanilla and then pray really hard.
