Delicious! I used what I had on hand, which was golden potatoes. I did half with the relish and half without. While both were good, I Preferred the one without the relish (just my personal preference). We thought the addition of the pesto seasoning was a nice change from the usual. I will be making this one again! Thanks for sharing. :)
