Enjoyed this salad a lot. Scaled it here to 3 servings to use only 1 can of black-eyed peas, and I ended up with enough salad to easily make 4 servings. Didn't have a tomatillo, added salt and black pepper, but otherwise kept to the recipe; except didn't use red pepper flakes since I was serving it along side a spicy Cajun Chicken recipe. Wanted this to be a fresh, cooling element along side the main and not another source of spice. Worked excellent for that. That's a meal I'll make often.

Terrific!!! I had to sub in for the black-eyed peas but  I wanted to try it& had everything else. So I used 1/3 of each: Lima beans, white beans& chick peas.  Makes a large salad!

This recipe is so refreshing!  I made it according to the recipe,except I opted out of the cucumber, because I don't really like it. This recipe is a great jumping-off point. Next time I make it I might add two grilled chicken breasts cut into bite sized pieces.  It might be good with bacon crumbles and shredded cheddar, the possibilities are endless!  Thanks, Gumaraid!
