Very, very yummy. We actually used this as a side dish with dinner. I agree that one teaspoon of cinnamon instead of one tablespoon is better. And I just noticed the other reviewer's suggestion to put it in oatmeal...can't wait to try that in the morning! Thanks for the great recipe, Lauren!

This really did not turn out "syrupy".  I let it cook for 15-20 min in hopes that more water would boil off to form a syrup.  It never did.  If I make this again, I'll just skip adding extra water because enough water is drawn out of the apples by the sugar.  The apples were very good though - I cut down on cinnamon and added a bit of nutmeg.

Give this a try and you won't be disappointed!  I served this atop the Buttermilk Pancakes II recipe and it was delicious!  I used saigon cinnamon (a bit spicier cinnamon) and Granny Smith apples.  I actually halved the recipe since I was just making enough for hubby and me.  Other than that though, I followed exactly.  Bravo, thanks for sharing Lauren!

We're cinnamon lovers, but thought this recipe calls for too much!  The cinnamon was a little overwhelming, almost bitter.  The second time I made this, I used 1 tsp & it was perfect.  Used it to top dutch babies & it looked very pretty.  I've also used it to top pancakes & they were delicious!  Thanks for a good start on a nice & simple syrup recipe!

I used homemade apple pie spice instead of plain cinnamon and apple cider instead of water. I spooned this topping over homemade vanilla frozen yogurt. We ate every. single. bite.

What a great idea for using over pancakes!  Yum! I used two gala apples, and decreased the sugar to 1/4 cup because gala apples are pretty sweet as it is.  Decreased the cinnamon to 1 tsp as previous reviewers recommended.  I didn't decrease the amount of water.  Granted, the syrup doesn't thicken up which is what previous reviewers were commenting on, but oh my goodness, the liquid tastes so good I didn't care!  It soaked right into the pancakes and the flavour was incredible! Thank you very much for such a great recipe :)

This recipe was okay as is, but when I added brown sugar- it tasted MUCH better. I think next time I'll do half brown sugar half regular, and i added a pinch more than 1/2 t. cinnamon as suggested by other reviewers and that was a good amount, not too much, not too little. It did turn out syrupy for me, because of letting it simmer for the appropriate amount of time - as stated- 10 minutes or until the apples are tender. I did add the full 2 T of water, too. This was a good base recipe that you can tweak to make for your personal tastes.

This sauce was good and I read the comments about using less cinnamon before I made it.  However I think it was too sweet and I only used about 4/5 of the sugar.  Next time I will use sweeter apples and less sugar

This was really good.  I gave only four stars cause I too thought the cinnamon was a bit much-and we eat cinnamon like it's going out of style, but I took suggestions from other viewers to use 1 tsp. and it was perfect.  My husband loved this recipe and we will be using it again-thank you for sharing!

This was great.  I served it over pumpkin pancakes and it was a hit for supper.  I pureed the leftover syrup and stirred it into oatmeal the next morning and I had another hit.

This recipe tasted excellent the second time I made it.  The first time I thought there was way to much cinnamon.  The second time I made it, I added one teaspoon of cinnamon instead of one tablespoon, and it was great!

Awesome!  Very similar to Cracker Barrel's pancakes w/ cinnamon apples.  I might top with whipped cream or cool whip too next time!  This is definitely a keeper!  This was only enough for 2 of us....but I like to load up my pancakes.

I have made this twice now - once exactly followed the recipe, which was fantastic, and second time I halved it and added nutmeg and walnuts.  Also, I chopped the apples into smaller pieces to make it easier to pour over ice cream...so good!

Had this this morning on pancakes- was great! I cut the apples into smaller chunks, not slices. I put a little less water and also let them juice with the cinnamon and sugar on them for several minutes before putting them on to cook (while I began to prepare the pancakes). Also, cooked them longer than the recommended time, leaving the syrup less watery and the apples less crisp.  Fantastic, and I will use again!

Yummy, except I'd cut the cinnamon to 1 tsp. (too overpowering). As another reviewer said, this does not really turn syrupy. I thought this recipe to be more like apple sauce depending on how much may mash the apples as they cook.

I made this as directed but cut down the cinnamon. I didn't think this was thick enough so I turned up the heat and the syrup cooked down in short order. (If you do this, keep an eye on the mixture or it can simmer dry.) I used this to fill crepes so used quite a bit and a full recipe filled 4 crepes, topped with toasted walnuts. Great for fall.

I loved this recipe and served it tonight over vanilla ice cream for dessert. I used light brown sugar and thai cinnamon, which has a deeper, richer taste. Turned out amazing -- simple, quick and yummy.

Yum!! This pancake recipe is delicious! However, I made a few changes! I substituted melted butter for the shortening. And I only added 2 jumbo eggs, so if you have large eggs, I suggest using 3. I dont have Vanilla, so next time I'll add a Tablespoon or so. Also, when making pancakes, make sure to oil or butter your pan a little bit. I only added about 2 teaspoons of baking powder. I also added about 2-3 T. extra. However, this is for 16 servings. I added some caramel syrup and apple sauce recipe... its delicious! Better than Aunt Jemima's mix!!! :) I made Cinnamon Apple Syrup. Trust me, you wont be sorry! These pancakes, taste like perfectly sweet, light, and fluffy clouds. You can use strawberry syrup, choco syrup, top with ice-cream, whip cream, your choice! Thank you so mcuh for this recipe! I saved it, I'll be making this more often!!! (=

Very easy and simple.  I actually substituted pears for the apples.  Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly.  I baked little shortcakes while the pears were cooking and made my own whipped cream to go on top.  Yummy!

Very good, but if I were to make it again I would decrease the amount of cinnamon - I love cinnamon, but it was still a bit overpowering. Thanks!

This was very good. Had to add some cornstarch to thicken the syrup.  Next time I won't add watwr, as it is not needed once the apples cook down a little. Used as a topping for pancakes.  Hubby loved it, will definitely make again. Thanks for sharing.

This was great! I did make a few adjustments so we could have more of a syrup base. First I added 3tbs of water and about 1 tbs extra sugar a pinch of nutmeg and 2 tsp of cinnamon. One tablespoon of cinnamon was to much in my opinion. This was a great recipe and was amazing over buttermilk pancakes.

I love it! I did use half brown sugar, and I topped it with some vanilla yogurt, which made it even better.

I agree with the other reviews that suggest there might be a bit much water as is, but the apples turned out so delicious. I will definitely be using this again and again!

This was delicious. I made it according to the recipe and I think I would decrease the cinnamon a bit, maybe to 2 teaspoons. I was a little dubious that it only needed 2T of water, but it worked!

Good.  Served over "good old fashioned pancakes" from this site.  I didn't have enough white sugar so I used half white and half brown.  Can't wait to try this on some vanilla icecream.

I did not like this at all! It was easy to make, but that was the only good thing about it. It was dreadfully sweet  in an almost cough syrup kind of way. My sister tried to be nice and poured a  bit of it on her pancakes, but she couldn't finish it, and neither could I. I will not be making these again.

This was good and I think the recipe has potential...I agree with another reviewer that it calls for too much cinnamon. So much that it almost makes it bitter. Next time I'll try using less cinnamon and maybe add some lemon juice or something to add dynamics.

This was nice, but it didn't seem much like syrup.  It was more like a thick applesauce or apple jam.  It did smell wonderful, though.  Maybe I just had the heat too high.

This does taste really good, though as others have noted, there is a typo--use a TEASPOON of cinnamon, not a tablespoon!  This definitely does not have the consistency of syrup.  If you want that, add more water, plus corn starch.

Used sweeter apples so I cut down on sugar and added a splash of lemon juice to compensate. Cooking took much longer than 10 min for topping consistency, but delicious!!!

I found syrup to be too thick so made and added a Cinnamon Simple Syrup of 2 cups water, 4 cinnamon sticks and 1/1/2 cup sugar.
Bring water and cinnamon sticks to a boil  and simmer for 12 m minutes. Discard sticks, add sugar and stir until sugar is dissolved.

I made this with tsugaru apples, so I cut the sugar down by a little and I also added dried cranberries for tartness. I agree the cinnamon should be cut down maybe to 2 tsps as well. Served over ice cream.

It tastes amazing, I used gala apples instead of tart but it still turned out good. But because I did that I added a bit more brown sugar. Also I added a  tablespoon of maple syrup to get that thick consistency. Overall it worked out well, I just wish it was a bit more syrupy.

I really liked this recipe. I had left over apple slices and decided a syrup would be awesome to make for waffles. Used all the ingredients but not the same measurements as I just guessed since the syrup was only for me. I really liked it and will make again.

Wonderful, thanks for posting this great recipe.  Only changes were to use Splenda ( dietary restrictions) and a bit less cinnamon ( about 1/3 less).  Husband was ready to eat it on its own!  Made it w/6 small gala Apple's and only 1/4 C. Splenda.  Should have made more!!!  I do try to follow the recipes, but must sometimes adjust for taste and restrictions but do not feel this detracts from the original as I wouldn't have made this without the recipe being posted.  Thx again.

Just made this, and it turned out quite well. FOR THOSE HAVING ISSUES WITH RUNNY SYRUP: add 1 1/2 - 2 teaspoons of corn starch during the simmer phase, and you'll be left with a much nicer, thicker syrup.

It was delicious!! I made the topping with half white and brown sugar. I was out of vanilla so I added about 2Tbsp. of maple syrup as well. Next time I will not add the water as the consistency is a little watery. I just dusted the apples with cinnamon and pumpkin pie spice vs. the recommended measurements. I will definitely make this again!!

Made this with the Apple cinnamon pancakes on this site. Was excellent, made the recipe exactly how it was written and it set perfectly. This will become a regular "cheat day" treat for me.

Yum! I decreased the cinnamon to one teaspoon like everyone said and decreased the sugar to 1/4 cup. Then I subbed one of the tbsp of water for a tbsp of Chardonnay (saw it on another recipe and it seemed interesting). I served it over some Blue Bell homemade vanilla ice cream and added some pecans for crunch, and I had to go back for another bowl full. This is so freakin good!! Since my husband can't have ice cream, I put it in the fridge for us to enjoy tomorrow over some pancakes. Great recipe!!

As I wanted to make this sauce for 24 guests, I obviously had to double up on quantities.  I also took into consideration other comments, and used less cinnamon (1 tsp iso 1 tbsp).  As I had so much to do for the breakfast function, that I decided to buy tinned apples.  I used 3 large tins, cut them up, and followed the recipe.  I did add a bit of corn starch to thicken it up a bit, listening to other comments.  After breakfast we had this with pancakes, Maple syrup, honey, whipped cream, etc.  Our friends couldn't stop eating!  Definitely a keeper, and so easy!  Thank you!

This was delicious! My husband and I had this with peanut butter pancakes.  Maybe next time we'll use a bit less sugar though...

I just tried this. Followed it exactly. It turned out too liquidy so I added a bit more sugar hoping that it would caramelize a little and make it more syrupy. Then it became too sweet so I added more water. I was supposed to use it for pancake topping but since my apple to syrup ratio was now off, I just added it to oatmeal.

Overall I think this is a good basic recipe. I used 1/3 cup brown sugar instead of white and added about a tablespoon of honey. It turned out plenty "syrupy" with these modifications! Delicious!

Leave the water out! The juice from the apples is more than sufficient. Very cinnamon-y, not very syrupy,  great over waffles.

I Made this for dinner with Strawberry syrup and pancakes. The cinnamon was a little over powering so i added and extra 6 teaspoons of sugar and 6 teaspoons of brown sugar and it made all the difference! Can't wait to try this out again, it is now my little brother's, 8, favorite meal that I make.

This turned out to be a wonderful syrup and accompaniment to the buttermilk pancakes II recipe. I halved the recipe as I was only making for two, but we both felt that we could have easily eaten the full 4 serving recipe between us. I also used a tsp water (instead of a tbsp for a half recipe) and added 2 tsp of maple syrup, and used only 1/2 tsp cinnamon. Will be making this again very soon!

I've made this a few times. Maybe it's just me but the 1 TBS didn't bother me.  This is a staple in my kitchen and I enjoyed trying it a different way (1 tsp being in my staple recipe)!  Thanks so much for sharing!!!  I ate it all after sharing with the only child I had around who wanted to try it :D  I will definitely be making it again, at some point, I'm sure!

WAY way way too much cinnamon! i took it down to 1 tsp and it was still a bit much. i also added a dash of nutmeg and a tablespoon of salted butter. the butter really added flavor! it was easy to make alongside our french toast, but i'm going to keep tweaking this recipe. as it stands, not the greatest, but if you tweak it a bit, it's really good. my husband said it tasted like the sauce you get at restaurants :)

I used two big red delicious apples. I used about the given amount of cinnamon and added nutmeg. It was not syrupy, but it was very good. We topped waffles with them and it was delicious!! Thank you!

This was okay. I changed the serving size to 6 but still used a Tablespoon of cinnamon and it was still too much. I agree with other reviewers that a teaspoon would be sufficient and I'm a cinnamon lover!

I really enjoyed this recipe.  However the amount of cinnamon was overkill, i recommend cutting to half of the cinnamon or adding in a bit more sugar.  I wasn't really sure what apples to use so i just made it with granny smiths.

Wonderful!  Cinnamon is so good for you, thus I would leave the amount as given.  The only changes I made was cut the apples in chunks, and increase the cooking time.  This is also great used in cooked oats!!  Just add during the last few minutes of cooking time.  Delicious!!

These were really good.  The only thing I have to say is to cook them a little longer if you don't want them too crunchy.  But I will def make them again!

This is a good recipe.  Just to note, I tried to make a half batch and it was too dry. I would add another tablespoon of water if you want the "syrup." Having more water would also give something for the cinnamon to dissolve into better.  Our apples were coated with cinnamon - a bit chalky tasting.

As per the other reviewers, I reduced the cinnamon drastically. I used one heaping teaspoon instead of the tablespoon, and it was still super cinnamony (I love cinnamon). Turned out great! I had to  cook them a little longer than called for. I served them on French Toast. Easy and super yummy. Thanks!!

I followed the directions but the batch came out tasty way too strongly of cinnamon. My kids would not eat it after a few bites because the taste of the cinnamon was too overwhelming. I suggest using half the amount of cinnamon.

I was nervous about this because there wasn't a lot of water involved-so I didn't know how it was going to make a syrup! But it ended up smelling delicious & it thickened up a bit as it simmered. Can't wait to try it on some pancakes tomorrow. Used Splenda for the sugar. I liked how simple it was-whipped it up in minutes!
