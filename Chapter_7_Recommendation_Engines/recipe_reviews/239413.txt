The produce guy at the grocery store told me yes, $5.99 a pound for asparagus is pricey, but this is some darned good asparagus – it came all the way from Washington State!  (I’m in Wisconsin).  I bought it, not because I felt it was extraordinary asparagus, but because I had planned it for dinner that night.  As it pertains to this recipe, now get this – I had the second half of the bunch standing in a glass of water in the fridge – for well over a week!  Believe it or not it was as though it had just been picked so it was just fine for our supper tonight.  Anyway, one of the things I liked about this recipe was that it called for the asparagus to be cut into pieces!  Every piece, every nook and cranny, gets a good coating of all the good stuff you’re dousing it with, for one thing.  Also, it is a heckuva lot easier to eat!  No messing with cutting it with a knife and fork!  And it sure looked awfully pretty piled onto the plate.   Now whether it was the $5.99 a pound expensive asparagus direct from Washington State, this recipe, or a combination of both, this was some GOOD asparagus!  Cooked just right, by the way, at 12 minutes.  Happy to be the first reviewer and rate this an enthusiastic two thumbs up.

Doubled the recipe for a church dinner - brought home nothing except an empty dish and a request for the recipe. Great recipe :)

Easy and very good!  My only change was to juice 1/2 a lemon (used zest of whole lemon), as that was enough lemon for my taste.  The family loved it!

We loved this recipe. It is easier to eat when cut up, but either way, the flavor is great. Our market, for Easter, just lowered the cost to $.79 a pound. I bought 5 lbs. Some will get frozen. We add more garlic as it's a personal preference. No change in lemon. It is not overwhelming, so that's good for me (not fond of lemon, overall). Family loved it! Will make again.

I made this on New Year's Eve along with a prime rib.  I liked that I was able to just pop it in the oven for 20 minutes while the meat rested.  Next time I may add a little less lemon unless you really like that lemon flavor to come through!  All-in-all, it was different and very enjoyable.  I'll definitely make it again and not necessarily for a special occasion.  Good for anytime!

I made the dish per directions given to go with a lemon dill chicken dish.  I love asparagus especially roasted and seasoned with lemon.  The full lemon plus zest was a bit too lemony for my taste.  The Parmesan was a nice addition, but I will most likely just do my usual simple oven roasted with salt and olive oil.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.
