I have been eating venison all my life and this was hands down the best I have ever had.I used the tender loin instead of roast and cut the oven time in 1/2,It came out perfect.If I were on death row this would be my last meal!

This was delicious!  I used milk instead of cream, eliminated the parsley (didn't have it) and some round steak my husband had cut up when processing the deer.  I also used Panko (Japanese Bread Crumbs) instead of regular bread crumbs.  I also added garlic powder and onion powder when I seasoned the meat before cooking.  Also, didn't have sherry or marsala, so I used some white wine I had on hand.  I will definitely make this again!

This is a really great recipe!!  I used panko bread crumbs instead of regular and I think that made a difference. I made this for my husband, friends of ours, and our four children (ages 4, 5, 1, and 6). I made the first batch with the sauce, and the rest they were eating as soon as I could fry them up! The sauce is okay, but next time I will fry the meat, make the sauce separate, and not bake it. The bread coating got a little mushy when I baked it. It is a great recipe though, and my only suggestion to others is to make sure that you flatten your steaks or cutlets very well - the thinner you flatten them, the faster they will cook and there's really no need to bake it - mine were fork tender after the frying step. Very Good!!!

Great recipe. I used venison steaks rather than roast (didn't have roast) and followed the rest of it to a T (although I did double the liquid and served it over tortellini). It turned out AWESOME. My Husband loved it and it was even good the next day!!! Thanks for such a great recipe.

Fabulous! My only tip is to be sure to cut the meat thin enough...at least a quarter of an inch, then pound the life out of it ! Thanks!

Loved it had great flavor!  There was not much sauce when mine was finished so we thought the noodles were bland but I would definitely make this again.

Everyone loved it!  I used apple juice instead of the sherry/wine.  It turned out so tasty!  I served the meat over wheat spagetti and I made a side salad that had thin apple slices and shredded cheddar cheese in it with a vinagarette that included a hint of applejuice.  I have to say the recipe really does take venison to a new level!  Will try it again with the wine in it next time, just didn't have any on hand.

Top-Notch! This was excellent. As another reviewer said...this is hands down the best venison recipe! I started with 2 steaks (bone-in). I cut each steak into 4 pieces and flattened real thin. I fried them without ever putting them in the sauce or oven. They didn't need either one. I did made the sauce, but nobody eat it. My kids actually asked for apple sauce and it tasted really good that way. I will be making again providing my husband can make the bow hunting deadline. Thanks for sharing.

This is a good recipe. I sliced a small roast, sliced it thin and fried. I did not bake in the oven. Takes time to prep but it was worth it. 
Thanks for sharing!

This recipe was fantastic!  I'm not a huge fan of venison but this may have converted me.  The meat was flavorful, tender and there was no gamey taste at all!  I will definitely make it again.

Fantastic! I followed this recipe as well as I could with ingredients I had on hand, therefore; I did have to make a few substitutions. Per suggestion of another review I only used a splash of milk in the eggs instead of cream.  I also substituted 1/4 C. acv, 1 Tbs of sugar and 3/4 C of beef broth for the sherry/broth mix. I will DEFINITELY make this again and  plan to try it as it is written.

I used a piece of venison loin and knew the steaks would be done quickly so I didn't bother with the oven, just a large covered skillet. I also added a cup of wild mushrooms (thawed) from the freezer. I substituted a little milk for the cream since I had none of the latter. Original recipe has great flavor and is nearly identical to the chicken marsala recipe I use. I'm sure it would work with pork as well.

Excellent and easy to make.  We used the 'stew' cut and it tenderized nicely.  Used a cast iron pan with lid for baking.

Very good. I used venison chops  cutting off the bone. Pound the meat to 1/8 inch thick. Use just the egg to coat the meat and dipp in Italian bread crumbs with the other recommended ingredients. I used olive oil to brown. Added the rest of the recipe except I kept it in the heavy skillet on med low covered. Simmer 45 minutes. Delicious! No wild taste.

I was skeptical of this one, but it really turned out well.  I had several thin venison steaks, too many to fit in my big roaster, so I had to fry in batches first.  (Took a lot more oil than recipe states, but I was probably making at least double the recipe, maybe triple.)  I wasn't too precise with my breading measurements, either - added a little extra milk to the egg mixture, used a mixture of both regular and panko bread crumbs, just because that's what I had on hand, but nothing that varied critically from the recipe.  Stacked all the meat on a plate, poured in the broth and sherry and deglazed the pan before I put all the steaks back in, stacked on top of each other.  I made sure there was enough liquid to barely reach the top of the meat, and put it in the oven.  Outstanding flavor, and a hit with my family.  Thanks for this one!

This recipe takes a bit of time and was worth every moment. A warning....you may overeat because it is so good. We served this with pasta and a red sauce made with high quality tomatoes.  Served it with a deep red wine.  Great meal...fine restaurant quality without the price. Thanks for sharing.

The men in my family turned into great hunters this season so I have a freezer and celler full of Venison. This was a great way to combine my husband's favorite (traditional pan frying) with my desire to always try something different. I doubled the recipe because I sliced up a large deer ham, and then used 1/2 sherry and 1/2 red wine. My family loved it and I think we'll use this one again!!

I made this recipe alongside chicken (in case my guests didn't want venison) I have to admit, its a bit of work to make this, little time consuming, but EVERYONE raved about this dinner.  The chicken was the only portion of dinner that was left.  My husband said it was hands down the best venison he had ever eaten and he has been eating venison his whole life.  The true test was when people argued with me and said no way was that venison, and then they asked if they could have seconds!

Good recipe!  My family is not a fan of parmesan cheese, so I made it without the cheese and served it with wild rice.  It was a big hit.

I got a very similar recipe from my NebraskaLand Game Cook Book. My family RAVES!!! Every fall when my husband goes hunting, thats' the first thing they ask me to make after processing. I usually just use the loin steaks and pound them out. It's less work than cutting a roast. Plus, it gives the prefect size portion. I had never thoughtof serving with pasta, though. Next time I will try it.
