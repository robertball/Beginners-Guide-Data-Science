This is a fabulous recipe!  Perfect for a cold winter evening.  I modified it a bit, I sauteed 2 carrots and half an onion in Extra Virgin Olive Oil and rosemary before adding them to the soup as well as using milk instead of heavy cream....it thikens just perfectly if you let it simmer on Low for 1/2 to 1 hour.  I served it in bread bowls and everyone loved it!

This recipe really only produces a 3 star soup unless you make some modifications.  The following changes produce a really good soup, though still not 5 stars...

I wanted to be sure the rice cooked, so I turned the crock pot on low overnight rather than the 4 hours suggested.  

(The other reviewers said the rice didn't cook well enough in that amount of time.  Mine cooked about 8 hours, I think it would have been done an hour or two before I woke, but it still turned out fine letting it go so I could get a full 8 hours of sleep.) 

I couldn't bring myself to add the flour to the cream the way the author suggested, so I used some butter and made a roux.  I added the cream and a little sherry to the roux, and then added that mixture back in the crock pot.

This recipe is not very flavorful and it tasted a lot better when I added garlic powder, cayenne pepper (just enough to make it warm, not enough to bite), and quite a bit of sage.  Then I had a soup worth making again.

This recipe is so yummy. My family really enjoyed this. The soup tasted so good without the whipping cream, so if you don't want to add  the cream you don't have to. I didn't have wild rice so I used basmati rice, but you have to cook the rice first...i found that out the hard way. Thank you for sharing this recipe!

I used milk in place of cream, thickening it with cornstarch, but I wasn't happy with the results.  It was too watery.  Next time I will try it using cream.  It had a great flavor and was very easy.

I followed the recipe and it turned out great.  My whole family loved it.  I would  back off on the onion slightly and add a bit more wild rice next time.

My family gave this recipe a "3".  I don't eat meat, but they indicated that the chicken was dry (maybe from needing to cook the rice so long).  I would suggest cooking the rice for awhile before adding in the other ingredients.

This soup just did not work for me.  The 4 hr. time wasn't long enough to cook the rice and onions; overall not much taste.

This soup was not what I expected.  I would not make it again.
