I wanted to make it a bit more healthy so I only used boneless, skinless, chicken breast. I cut them up into chunks and cooked them in a wok with the onions, apples, paprika, salt, pepper, and butter. I also used skim milk instead of cream. This was really good, and time saving. I just didn't have 2 hours to make dinner. I would also suggest putting a crunchy green veg. in there as well, maybe sugar snap peas. I served it over long grain brown rice. The sauce was amazing though, and the recipe was really easy to convert. I loved making it a one dish sort of dish, aside from the rice.

This was awesome - couldn't find my curry powder so the spices that I used were the paprika, salt, pepper and garlic powder.  Turned out well - raves from the hubby.

If you love curry, then you'll LOVE this simple recipe!  Only one suggestion-if you decide to separately cook with skinless, boneless chicken breast instead, then saute the onion and apple much longer. This way the sauce is smooth and not crunchy.

I LOVE this recipe!!! and my wife does too!!  We double the Curry powder and use milk instead of cream and sub boneless skinless thighs for a bit healthier dish, but the core of this recipe stays the same, I had never made Curry before reading this, we're on our 3rd time in two weeks :)

Weirdest recipe ever (curry + canned soup?), but DELICIOUS and FAST. My husband loved this even better than a time consuming curry I made from this site. If I can please him with a LOT less work, I'm headed for this one, no brainer! Try it!

This was a really good recipe.  To save time, I fried the diced boneless, skinless chicken breast with the chopped onion and 1 clove chopped garlic, along with the apple in olive oil.  In a medium sized bowl I mixed the cream with the mushroom soup and the spices (including some chili powder to spice it up a bit). I added the cream mixture to the chicken and let simmer on low for about 45 minutes to tenderize the chicken.  I also added some currents and frozen peas about 1/2 hour before serving over rice.  Yummy!

I've made this a few times. The first time I used boneless skinless breasts and followed some other reviewers' suggestions to brown the chicken before covering with sauce. The chicken was kind of dry and the sauce didn't taste great. Now I use a big package of bone-in thighs and drumsticks and don't cook them at all (just season them as instructed in the recipe) before pouring the sauce over them. My goodness! This is one recipe I'd highly suggest following as written. The chicken is incredible, and the sauce is MUCH better for having all that time to bake in the oven. I've used variations of dairy, just depending what I have on hand. Anything from whole milk to heavy cream (and mixtures of the two) have worked great for me. I've also used cream of chicken instead of cream of mushroom soup - tastes great! This is a keeper! Oh, and if I have extra apples, I use two. Same with onions. I just like the texture of those things a whole lot. Finally, the recipe says to add salt, pepper, paprika and curry powder to taste - it might take a couple tries to figure out what amounts of these things you like, but it's worth it :) As others have said, it's impossible to be precise with curry measurements because curry powders vary so widely.

This was a good base, but wasn't enough flavor for me. I added lots more vegetables (mushrooms, zucchini, potatoes, chives and kale) and didn't have to add any more sauce base. Two tsp of curry and a pinch of indian chili powder gave it a nice kick. I also added about a tsp of maple syrup to sweeten it slightly, and it had a nice effect! The end result was almost identical to "yellow curry" which could be ordered at a thai or fusion restaurant. :)

LOVE this recipe!! But I don't see a need to put it in the oven... I follow the recipe mostly, though I use 3-4 chicken breasts chopped up into bite-size pieces (season with salt, pepper, paprika as the recipe states). I cook up the apple and onion in the melted butter, then I add the chicken in and season with the curry (we like more than a Tbl... usually around 2, but I start with one and add more as I go). Once the chicken is browned, add the mushroom soup and skim milk (instead of half and half)... cook until warmed through. Serve over rice. Experiment with different types of curry too!!

I grew up on this recipe (the submitter is my dad) and I love it! It was one of the first dishes I made when I was trying to cook for myself and I still make it for guests and my family. It is super adaptable, you can throw in different veggies if you want or use a lighter milk. I've made this vegetarian with mushrooms instead of chicken. Has a very complex flavor for being so simple. A+ (Hi Dad!)

I was excited to try this.  I love curry but have never made it myself.  Thought this recipe seemed a little odd with the cream of mushroom soup, but it was easy so gave it a try.  Did not like the sauce at all.  Hubby was not a fan either. I followed the recipe exactly.

Loved this recipe, nice creamy texture and a light flavor. Next time I am going to add more curry to kick it up. I omitted the apple for my picky eaters.

VERY YUMMY RECIPE!  Because it was a hot day and I had to cook dinner quickly, I did everything on the stove top.  I seasoned (with S&P)& cooked 4 skinless boneless chicken breasts in olive oil and then added a clove of chopped garlic at the end.  Then deglazed the pan with a little chicken broth & set aside.  I cooked a chopped onion, carrot, and small potato in the butter instead of the apple.  I only had fat-free half & half so I used that.  The curry powder didn't seem like enough flavor for our taste so I also seasoned the chicken with a teaspoon of additional curry powder.  Then poured the sauce & veggies in with the seasoned chicken.  OMG - SOOOOO GOOOOOOD!  I served it with steamed white rice and my boyfriend could not stop eating it!  We love Indian food and this recipe is quite a gem!

This is the first curry dish I ever made. The recipe was very simple...and OH, SO GOOD! We used boneless, skinless chicken breats, two apples (cored and peeled), and 1 and 1/2 T's of curry. Served over brown rice. Enjoy! We will again and again.

This was delicious!  I cut chicken breast into chunks and let it simmer to speed up the process, and make it a bit more healthy.  The second time around, I added a bit of fennel seed.  This seemed to be the missing ingredient to me!  

We make this ALL the time and my version has morphed a bit.  We now add lentils, cashews and a bit of coconut milk.  We also completely OD on the curry.  It's one of our staple meals now.

This was my first attempt at curry chicken and I am 100% impressed with how it turned out. I made a few modifications; I used pre-cooked chicken and reduced the baking time down to 25 minutes. I also wasn't sure if I'd like the apple in there so I only used 1/3 of an apple (next time I'm going to use the whole apple). I didn't measure any of the spices but I'd imagine that I used more than a tablespoon of the curry powder and paprika since I kept tasting it and it seemed like there wasn't enough. In the end though I had a fantastic dish that I will definitely be making again. 

I laid a piece of garlic naan on the plate, piled on some white rice, and covered that with the curry chicken and sauce. It tasted and looked like something from a restaurant!

We recently had a get together with family and friends where we all made Indian dishes. I almost felt guilty listening to how long some of the other cookers spent searching for ingredients and making their dishes. This recipe is easy and by far the best one! Even all the kids  loved it!

I haven't ever cooked a curry dish myself before but I've had several at restaurants so this was kind of a experimental recipe. It was very good and had a nice texture and flavor. I, like many other reviewers, changed it up a bit. I didn't have cream on hand so I used whole milk. I used chicken breast cut up into bite-sized pieces and I also added some chopped bell pepper the last few minutes of cooking. I agree with one of the other reviews I read- it needs more curry powder than what the recipe calls for and also some sort of vegetable to add more texture. Overall this is a good recip with a little bit of tweaking. Thanks for sharing!

Well!  I liked the easy part of making this curry.  Tried a bunch of different ones and this one was simple!  Just used chicken breasts and 2% milk over the other two.  Added garlic and coriander also.  Was nomnoms!!  Made the sauce and added the raw chicken to the sauce, covered it and let it simma down for like 30 mins.  :D

My boys loved this recipe after I changed it up a but. I used goats evaporated milk instead of cream and cream of broccoli instead of mushroom. My boys don't like mushroom. They ask for it more often now.

One of my favorite dishes in years of being on AR. Doubled the curry powder, added turmeric, cumin, crushed red pepper to the sauce mix, along with some fresh garlic and ginger. Chopped up 10 thawed chicken tenders that were previously cooked and let it simmer in the sauce while I cooked basmati rice in the microwave for 18 minutes. Very pleased.

Very good.  I've made other curry dishes that took so much more effort. I used chicken breasts and I did not add an apple but to add that sweetness I included several dashes of garam masala in the sauce.  I was generous with the curry (used more-red curry) and overall liberal with spices that we like, such as cayenne pepper, dash or two of hot chilli powder, diced jalepenos and red pepper flakes for heat.  So easy!

Grade A meal! Next time I think I will cook the chicken first and pour of the oil, then cook with the sauce. Delicious though :-)

So so good! And so easy, I can't believe I've ever tried to do this till now! I did make some changes, first I have to say I added ALOT more Curry powder! And also more paprika since I enjoy more of a spice. Also I added cumin as well. I did a cream of potato since I don't like mushrooms, added carrots and half a garlic clove... also have to say I did only half a apple in it, even tho I wasn't sure how everyone would feel about it, but it really added something special to it, and you totally couldn't tell there was any apple

Made this before added more curry seasoning, can cook on stove top, just simmer till chicken is nice and tender.  I also added more onions.  I used evaporated milk instead of 1/2 & 1/2.  Husband loved it.  He is a joy to cook for because he likes almost anything I cook.

I made this as written only halved it as I was only serving two. I made 1 chicken breast and halved the sauce. The recipe did not state as to whether or not to cook uncovered or covered. The answer is to cover it. I don't think I've ever eaten curried chicken, so I don't have a point of comparison, but I must say, I didn't have any trouble putting this one down. I really thought it was very tasty and delicious. I will make again. Thank you for sharing.

I grew up eating real Indian curry.  This is an easy recipe and yet is very authentic . I made my own condensed cream of mushroom  with mushrooms a,onion and garlic sautéed in butter some flour, half and half and chicken broth. Much better than canned.

I made this for me and my husband after a long work day. The 75 minute cook time was to long to wait as we were both starving so we subbed the chicken pieces with chicken tenders and reduced cook time to 30 minutes. We both loved the flavor of the sauce so I am adding this dinner to my Recipe Box for keeps. Enjoy!!

We've been craving Coco's curry like we had overseas. This recipe really helped. I made changes per what I had on hand. I boiled boneless skinless chicken breasts and added some fresh cut carrots. In another pan, I added the butter, apples and onions and  seasoned with cumin, turmeric, chili powder, paprika, black pepper and salt and cooked til tender. Then added cream of mushroom soup (2), the carrots, the chicken breast (finely chopped),  2 cubes of mild curry sauce and one finely chopped pear. I also put breaded chicken patties in the oven for 15 min. To serve, I put the sticky rice first, then the curry, then a chicken patty cut in strips, a little more curry and topped with a little fine shredded cheese. Thanks so much for this recipe. We have a keeper!

Followed advice of divajend and used chicken breasts cut into bite size chunks, seasoned with paprika, salt and pepper.  Sauteed onion/apple with 1 TBSP curry powder.  Added chicken cooked until brown and then soup/milk.  Wound up adding an additional TBSP of curry powder for taste.  Hubby liked and would eat again.

This is a delicious recipe.  I was looking for an easy curry chicken recipe and this is the first one I found.  I used regular milk, but simply because that is what I had on hand.  My family loved it...especially my husband.  Will be making it again and again.

Doubled up on apples and curry. Also added some honey during the last few minutes. I used cocoanut milk instead on half and half. YUMMY!

I was so surprised how good this was. The only difference, which I think is what made it special was that I sautéed the chicken in coconut fat.  Used zingy marleys brand that I had on hand.  Can get it at whole foods.  Can add nuts and raisins which makes it like traditional curry.

Yum!  Great for a poor girl dinner!   Good, but not amazing, but what can you expect with mushroom soup and curry powder?  I paired this with two buck Chuck chardonnay and had a great meal.

I made this for supper tonight.  A real keeper!  I used chicken breasts instead of a whole chicken and cut them into five or six pieces each so it would cook faster.  Used green pepper instead of the apple and milk instead of heavy cream.  The amount of curry powder was perfect.  The only thing I'll do different next time is make twice as much sauce.  It is SOOOO good!  Served it over white basmati rice and it was perfect.

We used pre-cooked & cubed chicken (about 3-4 breasts) and used green pepper instead of apple. It needed double the curry powder. good recipe!

Currently living out of country, so adapted this a little bit.  Used a skinned and deboned charcoal rotisserie chicken for the meat, substituted evaporated milk for the half-and-half and baked about 30 minutes.  I used about 1-1/2 T curry powder, but I think it could have used more.  We liked it but my husband has requested that I make it "spicy" next time as he like spicy curries....maybe add cayenne pepper?  Well worth using my $5 can of cream of mushroom soup I have been hoarding : )

Great recipe!  I did the fast way like a lot of folks- but the sauce was delicious- since I was using a mushroom soup- I decided to add some fresh mushrooms to the mix when I was sauteeing the onion and it turned out amazing!  the mushrooms were my favorite part.

So delicious and yet so easy! This has become one of favorite dishes to make. I make it a little faster by seasoning and cutting up chicken tenders and baking them alone, then adding to the sauce and baking for another 20 minutes. My hubby loves this! Thanks!

The chicken was good but could have used more flavor. I did add an extra tablespoon to start with, but since it was the first time I'd cooked with curry, I didn't want to go overboard. Next time I make this I will add more curry powder and probably another apple.

Great base! Made this for my mom, who is pescatarian, and used eggplant, zucchini, onion, and mushrooms. I did it as a stir fry instead of baking it, obviously. Also added a tsp of garlic and used coconut cream instead of half and half.

I found this simple recipe to be a life-saver when I needed dinner fast, particularly since it goes well with so many other things.  I did not change a thing since that seems to be the only way to do a fair review of a recipe!  What I will probably change next time is to use some cream of celery or onion soup as opposed to cream of mushroom (we didn't care for the pieces of mushroom in the sauce) and I will increase the amount of curry and paprika.  I am thinking of using hot paprika to enhance to the spiciness factor.

I use left over chicken in this recipe sometimes and adjust the cooking times accordingly.  I have tried cooking Indian inspired dishes without any luck, but this one I can make. Very delicious , adjust the spices to what you like.

I found this a bit blandness and mushroomy. To save it I added 2 tablespoons of Sambal Oelek, garlic powder, and cumin.

Super easy, super quick, very tasty. We both enjoyed it and I enjoyed how quick it was to put together. Served atop rice but hubby would prefer a noodle. Only change for us would be to add some vege like julienne peppers and carrots. Yummy!

I've made this a million times now and it's a big hit with my family. My husband LOVES every time I make this. The small changes I make is chicken breasts cooked and sautéed in a large skillet. It's completely unnecessary to cook a whole chicken in the oven - in my opinion. Also, for a healthier option, I use coconut milk instead of heavy cream. If I need to thicken the sauce a bit, I'll mix some cold water with corn starch and add it into the sauce. This recipe is fantastic. Give it a try. Oh, and I recommend granny smith apples for the best flavor.

 modified- substituted mushrooms for the apple, halved the recipe but doubled the curry.
I'll make it again and again!

Very good!  I upped the curry and paprika a bit and I want to try and add a little more heat the next time I make it.  Very buttery and flavorful!

This is one of my new favorite recipes. I found it a few months ago and absolutely love it. Since then, I’ve made it at my house several times, once for my parents and grandmother (all of whom are picky), and once for my lunch group rotation at work (it reheats in a crockpot really well). Everyone who has tried it liked it. It’s not spicy (unless you want it to be) and the apples give it a hint of sweet. I personally use extra apples and onion because I like a lot of them. It’s super easy to make and absolutely delicious!

Unbelievably tasty for such a simple meal.
I added paprika and nutmeg to the chicken pieces and seared them in a Wok before adding to the baking tray/ oven dish.

Love  this curry

I used two large boneless, skinless chicken breasts, diced. Sauteed them in the butter  with the onion & apple. Mixed the other ingredients, together (added 1 tsp chili powder). Then thickened the sauce a bit in my instant pot using the saute' function. Added chicken mixture and set to manual pressure for 5 min. Quick release. Served over rice. Big hit!! Yum!!

So I followed the recipe for the most part but used boneless skinless chicken breast instead, sautéed the apple and onion with olive oil for about 5mins then added chicken chunks with salt and pepper to taste... in a separate bowl I mixed the paprika/curry powder/ mush soup and used sweetened coconut milk instead of half and half. Once the chicken was cooked I added the sauce and perfecto!!!  I let the sauce boil and then simmered for about 10-15mins...

Great dish to prepare quickly, lots of flavor. Easy Percy to make and a crowd pleaser. I added more than  1 tbsp of curry, depends on taste preference.

We love this dish; it is a household favorite. The kids (all twelve and under) actually cheer when they learn this is planned for dinner!  I make it all in one pan for simplicity and use boneless skinless chicken thighs due to preference.  It can be done entirely stovetop.  Served with rice.  Not sure if it authentic, but it is yummy.  The apples are a nice touch. Sometimes we add golden raisins.

It was delicious! I seared before to put it in the oven because my oven is very small and I was afraid it couldn't  be well done, I also added a few leaves of cilantro to decorate it.

We were skeptical but it turned out great. My very picky boyfriend gave it a 10 out of 10 after he added some salt :) I did use chicken breasts and cooked them in pieces instead of using the oven.

Was great!! I looked at other reviews and I agree a good based recipes. Flexible enough to put a personal twist to it. For veggies I chopped garlic, onion and squash(it's what I had in my fridge lol). Also, I saw someone used cream of chicken instead of mushroom( great idea and also was in my pantry) and also saw to brown the chicken (chopped chicken breast) before the curry veggie mixture....DELICIOUS!! Served over rice...amazing!! Will definitely keep this recipe in my back pocket :)

Easy and delicious. Like another cook, I also wanted it faster  so I  browned the chicken in a pan then added everything else and cooked till veggies were tender. So simple. i added mushrooms, green pepper, frozen corn and a bit of maple syrup to sweeten. Mixed milk with cream to lessen fat. Served over rice. Everyone loved it.

Made this exactly as shown. I thought it was horrible and had to throw it out. I have no idea how it got so many good reviews. In my opinion, it is a better idea to make it with proper ingredients instead of mushroom soup.

I make it gluten free with homemade gluten free chicken soup (3/4 cup organic chicken stock, 3/4 cup milk and 3 TBL gluten free cornstarch) and still add 1 cup half-and-half cream. I love curry powder and add turmeric also. Cut chicken into smaller chunks so cooking lasts

OH PRAISE GOD!  We make this all the time and LOVE IT. 

We do not use cream or butter, and we add a bag or two of frozen broccoli.  We serve over rice.  It's a family hit and a hit with guests!  ~great when sick, too~

Just made this and was pretty happy. I altered the recipe some. Instead of cream of mushroom soup I just made my own homemade cream of chicken soup (didn't have any mushrooms). I used skim milk instead of cream. Also I boiled chicken breasts and shredded them into the sauce I made with the seasonings, butter, onion, and homemade cream soup. I would make this again.

Great recipe,  nice touch with the mushroom soup. If you really want a good curry flavor try a little sri lankan roasted curry powder. I got some off ebay called Ma's organic roasted curry powder, it really gives it a unique taste!

I fryed the chicken in a bit of veg oil before hand. I used Jamacian curry, bonless/skinless thighs and added extra mushrooms and subbed the regular onions for  green onions. Two packets splenda (ran out of apples).  and baked it at 350 for 45minutes. No foil nessesary. I put it on top of Lipton's Singapore Curry Noodles in which I added an extra teaspoon of Jamacian curry,  extra green onion.

I garnished with even more green onions. (love my green onions :)  ) I added the photo above.

This was DELICIOUS - I made a few adjustments, such as cubing chicken breast and pan frying them, seasoned with paprika, turmeric, salt, pepper, garlic, and ginger. Also I added some green onions, diced green chiles and chopped garlic to the sauce and substituted half and half with culinary coconut milk - kicked it up by adding a little salt to the sauce and it was AMAZING - this will be a new weekly dish in my house

I used boneless skinless chicken thighs. I omitted the apple as I didn't have one. The dish was good, but I wish I would have had the apple to add in. I think it would have added to the flavor. I will try again

The only modifications I make: 
I use more half and half instead of  adding the soup.
I cook bite-sized chicken in a wok (instead of the oven) and then add the onion and apple.
I add bell peppers  too.
We eat this every week as it is one of our very favorites!!!

When I read the recipe, I almost didn't make it. I prefer cooking curry in a wok. But I was intrigued by the ingredients and thought it would make an excellent dish. How pleased was I to read MEGAN's comment. I cooked in a wok, but did the curry in butter to start the "broth", and then Granny Smith apple and white onion.  And then chicken, paprika, pepper, and salt.  I confess I used coconut milk instead of mushroom soup and cream...  Added snap peas.  Rather adulterated, but delicious!

So easy to make!  I decided to make it on the stove top since i didnt have a lot of time.  i added peas ( a nice suggestion from someone) and i used 1 % milk because that was what i had.  i thought two tablespoons of curry helped cover up a bit of the cream of mushroom taste, but the combo really was delicious!  Next time i think ill add mushrooms!  :)    Definitely adding this to the rotation!

This recipe really has the right favors.  I followed the recipe exactly.  I won't change anything the next time I make it other than my wife would prefer the chicken to be baked so it is more tender.  This isn't  a big issue if you are serving immediately after preparation. But, the re-warm the next day left the chicken chewy.  I suppose this is part of my cooking learning curve.  Thanks for the recipe! I will definitely make again and have already shared with my daughter.

This recipe is a great start, and tasty, but I used far more spices. Here's what I added, FWIW: I added a fresh, diced long hot pepper and a diced poblano pepper, and a teaspoon of minced garlic to the onion, apple, and butter sauté. I doubled the curry and mushroom soup, and I added 2 Tbsp minced ginger, 1 Tbsp garlic powder, 1 Tbsp brown sugar, 1 Tbsp tomato paste, and 1 Tbsp cayenne to the sauce. I sprinkled smoked paprika, salt, black and cayenne pepper, and garlic on both sides of the skinless, boneless chicken (and I cooked it only 45 minutes (no bones!). I also added a cup of fresh green beans and an already baked sweet potato (just because it was in the fridge (and it was yummy). So, I can only imagine that cooked as is it would not have been nearly spicy enough of a curry for me. However my alterations brought the spice level up to my standards.

I made this last night. I used golden cream of mushroom soup because I keep it on hand for other recipes and think it has a richer flavor. Added a tad more curry than the recipe called for originally after testing and used fat free half and half.  Needless to say, my husband had (4) helpings and the rest of the family ate the rest. I had an empty casserole dish, which I was not expecting.  This was outstanding and easy to make!!!

really good. I used 4 chicken breasts instead of a whole chicken. I did make the mistake of not peeling the apples and the skin came off. it was gross.

I used pre-cooked, seasoned rotisserie chicken.   I hate cooking meat... and this comes out perfect!  Also, I do saute the onion and apple first then add cream of mushroom soup and milk.  I next add curry (a few different types) and paprika.  The type of curry matters!  I wonder if people who did not like the recipe, but who usually like curry they eat out, are not cooking with the one they like.  ANYWAY, love this! Super quick to cook!

Really good recipe and very easy to make. I did a few things differently than the directions. I use chicken breasts for the meat and I boil them (takes less time). I also use a can of coconut milk  and supplement with half and half if I want to make it creamier. The coconut milk gives it really good flavor though. I like serving cranberry sauce with this dish; the sweet side goes well with it. This has become one of my husband's and my favorite dishes!

hands down a delicious recipe.. instead of using a whole chicken I used boneless skinless chicken breast and cut it into cubes, I lightly  browned the chicken and added the chicken to my sauce.. all done on the stove top! amazing!

We loved it! It tasted like restaurant curry. I didn't have cream, so I used 2% milk instead, and used two heaping spoonfuls of Korean curry powder. My husband and I both enjoyed it immensely. The only downside was it was pretty heavy (maybe because of the milk or because we ate it with a brown/white rice blend), but very filling and delicious.

Like others, I'm surprised at how good this was!  It's certainly not authentic but for a fast week day meal, it's a perfect curry dish.  I added some coconut milk and little Garam Masala but the rest of the recipe I followed exactly.  Will definitely make this again! 
Update: I've now made this several times and we still really enjoy it.  I add a little Garam masala in with the curry powder and it's always delicious!  A really fast and yummy curry!

I've made this twice and find it a bit bland.  I used much more curry than called for and still can't get the flavor right.  I will keep trying using it as a base (however, will omit the apple as I find it weird with curry) and try adding more spices.  I marinaded the chicken this time and still bland.  If I get it right I will update.

It tasted bland to me.  I added non fat milk and half and half to give it a less thick consistency.  I added 1/8tsp of cayenne pepper. It helped sooo much..  I baked boneless breasts, and just added to the pan. I simmered instead of baking the whole batch.

I used chicken tenderloins and cooked them in the sauce instead of baking. I also steamed broccoli, mushrooms, and green beans. I mixed them into the sauce once the chicken was done and served over rice. Delicious!

I cubed boneless skinless chicken breast put into the skillet with garlic oil and chopped onions.  I also used Cream of Celery soup instead of Mushroom. I also used can milk instead of half and half.  I didn't use butter or apple.  I did use much more curry powder.  I cooked the entire dish on the stove top.  Delicious.  I will definitely do this again.  Thanks for the lead.

I can see how FatManWhoCooks got fat...this is Yummy!  Used boneless, skinless breasts since that's what I had.  Added a green bell pepper and a few cloves garlic.  Doubled the curry power as several have suggested and did it all in a large skillet (butter, curry, pepper, onions a few min then chicken, spices, soup)  This is definitely on the staple list now.  Very tasty and quick.

Didn't change a thing other than I didn't have enough rice and served it over Orzo pasta.  Oh.  Wait, I followed other reviewers and used 1/2 milk and 1/2 sour cream instead of half n half (only because my half n half was expired!!!)   The British husband devoured it!!!  And he was ye of little faith that this would be a 'true curry'  the kids devoured it too!!!!

This was awesome! I used boneless skinless chicken breasts and added cut up red potatoes to the onion apple mixture. I then poured it all over the chicken and baked uncovered for 50 min. I also doubled the Curry and onions. I also added coconut oil while sautéing the onion potato apple mixture.

It's tastier than I expected given the "cream of" soup; my kids liked it, and it was mild enough for my youngest. I didn't have half-and-half, so I used evaporated milk. I'd use less soup nest time or dilute it more. Oh, I also only used half an onion (picky kids), but I've been pairing apple and onion quite a bit lately.

Never made curry chicken before. This was so yummy. The entire family
loved it. Just made one change and used chicken breasts cubed and did
it on the stovetop. The apple was a great addition think I would use
2 next time and definitely double the recipe for my 3 hungry boys.

Love love love it!  Great, EASY recipe for curried chicken.  Definitely a keeper.  I used chicken breast which were fine.  I cut them into strips before putting them in the oven so that all the seasonings and flavors would get in there good.  You know how chicken breast can be.  ;o)

This is delicious!! The only thing I changed is that I used cayenne pepper, didn't put the apples in and I used chicken breasts. The cayenne pepper gives it a little more kick to it. :)

I added bell peppers and chopped asparagus with double the required curry and a pinch of red pepper.  While overall it was a great dish, I will try chopped walnuts and capers and omit the apples next time.  I also suggest cooking the chicken in a separate skillet instead of combining all for oven.  It will keep the asparagus crunchy and the bell pepper lively.  Thanks for sharing!

OMG
I threw it in the oven. Went out to the pool and came back 45 minutes later and it was done. We don't like chicken breast so I used skinless boneless thighs. Very filling from the 1/2 and 1/2 I think. I would serve this dish to company. Served with rice and chrirzo and Brussels. Sprouts.

I used boneless skinless chicken breasts cut into chunks and cooked the chicken in a large frying pan (7 minutes) with the butter spices apples and onions - I added Garam Marsala to the spice mix - then mixed the soup and cream in a bowl and added to the pan simmered until chicken was cooked through - loved by all

I used boneless skinless chicken breast as I have picky eaters in my home that won't eat brown meat. I added in some cubed potatoes and some frozen mixed veggies. I also think that it needed a kick so I added in some jalapeño powder! This turned out soooo good! The basics of this recipe make it so easy to add in your own twist. So creamy and better than going out for Indian food (which in my area is very overpriced). Next time I may use cream of chicken soup instead of mushroom. Overall a great recipe!

I used boneless, skinless chicken, and I had no cream on hand so I made do with milk. I also added extra curry powder and crushed red pepper and some bell peppers. I'm at a loss for how it could be so tasteless. Disappointed.

This was good! I'd call it a westernized version of curry, but still very good. I used carrots instead of apples and added mushrooms, but otherwise followed the recipe. So good on a cold day, easy to make and hard to mess up.

I really enjoyed this recipe and the only thing I changed was the amount of curry I put in it.
I only put in 1/2 a teaspoon for my picky eaters in my family and I will for sure make this again.

I used chicken breasts instead and cut them into bite sized pieces and seasoned with the seasonings in the original recipe plus turmeric, sauteed in veg oil removed to plate, added more oil and onion then seasoned again with same seasonings as chicken. I added soup and half n half but it tasted too cream of mushroom soupey so I added more curry powder, turmeric and also ½ C chicken broth. Served with basamati rice. Very good but even with all the extra curry powder not a very strong curry taste. I will make again cuz it was easy and delish

Great recipe. My wife lived it! I used boneless, skinless breasts (2 lbs) and cut them up in small 1" or smaller chunks. This put the cooking time back to an hour. We love curry so I used a tablespoon and a half. Next time I will add an additional apple.  Served over brown rice.

The cream of mushroom soup gave this sauce a great texture but it threw off the taste. To compensate I added another half tablespoon of curry powder and threw in a pinch of cayenne pepper. I also added half of a green pepper and half of a red pepper to the sauce. It came out amazing. The chicken came out plain though. It needs to be seasoned differently. Instead of curried chicken it tastes more like chicken with a curry sauce. I'd try it again..just not the same way.

I had been curious to try a curry recipe and when I saw this recipe, being so easy and with positive reviews, I decided to try it.  Added carrots to pan at the start and frozen peas near the end. Turned out really good!  This recipe is definitely a keeper!

Good!! And super easy to make too. I used Tandoori Curry and hot paprika, and it was just the right about of spicy for me. Could not taste the apple at all, which is what I was hoping for! You can make this into a quicker meal by precooking your meat and throwing it in the sauce once finished!

Very good.  You can add more curry for more flavor. I also added Gram Marsala spice and omitted the apple. I sautéed the onion and garlic then added the chicken in a sauce pan, then added the spices and soup and I used heavy whipping cream because that is what I had on hand. Perfect and Very Good!

I made this but instead of using a whole chicken I cut up boneless/ skinless breast and instead of using apples I heated onions til soft in butter alone then added other ingredients as directed BUT I also threw in about 1/2 cup whole cranberry sauce, brought it to a simmer then poured over chicken and baked it. INCREDIBLE!

Awesome. Like others I also prepared this on the stovetop with boneless skinless chicken breasts, more curry powder and some chili powder to give it a little kick. Delicious and so quick. Simmered on the stovetop until done.

When I made mine, I used only half an onion and used a Californian Apple. I also seasoned the curry sauce with this Salt Free All Purpose Greek Seasoning, lemon pepper, and paprika. With my chicken, I seasoned it like I would any other chicken. I used Slap yo mama, the greek seasoning, paprika, and curry powder. I would also recommend cooking it for an hour and thirty minutes also.

This was my first attempt at curry. I wasn't sure if my younger boys would like this as well as my teenagers.  They all loved it and so did my husband. We will definitely be making it again!  I had to sub 1/4 tablespoon of cayenne pepper instead of paprika and it turned out great!

I made this with chicken breasts and it was delicious. I was so pleasantly surprised because I thought the cream of mushroom would be incompatible but it was not. It is such an easy and delicious meal for a weeknight!

This was a great recipe. I was in a hurry, so I sliced 2 chicken breasts. I seasoned them as done in the recipe. Fried them quickly in some olive oil. Then Combined them with the sauce and let it simmer for a few minutes. Served it with rice. Dinner was ready in less than 30 min!! Love the apples in there!

Yep, this is the one to get.  It was easy to prepare, inexpensive, and quick.  I pressure cooked mine so it wasn't nearly as thick and used it on rice, chicken, and bread.  It's quite a great dish and left-overs tasted even slightly better as the mixture of the flavors melded.

My family loves this recipe!  I don't use half and half, I just use extra cream of mushroom soup.  Pineapple is a great substitution for apple.  Also I serve this over rice.  This is my go-to curry recipe.

really easy curry dish. As others I used boneless breasts. And I wanted a little green in the dish so I added a handful of peas and served over noodles. It was very tasty!

This was very good and so easy to make. I had chicken thighs on hand and thats what I used. I had no leftovers, family loved it served over rice, with a crusty bread and salad. thank you.

I also used the wok to saute everything for a faster meal. First I sauteed the seasoned chicken cubes until they were fully cooked, then I removed them and drained them of any juices. Next I added minced onions, apples, butter,(added in peas) and curry powder. I think this would've been tasty with chopped potatoes as well. Once they were tender I added the cream of mushroom soup and 1 cup of whole milk, I then added the chicken back in and served with white rice. It was good but it wasn't mouthwatering- which curry usually is to me!

I used cut up boneless pork which I dipped in flour and fried first. Then made my apple mixture in the same frying pan. I increased the curry and added some cayenne for a bit of heat, some sliced mushrooms, and frozen peas. Great over boiled potatoes.

I love this recipe; it's very easy for a lazy cook like me and it tastes great. I use boneless, skinless chicken breast--1/2 breast per serving and find that it only takes 30 minutes for cook time that way. I highly recommend this dish.

Thank you, thank you, thank you! Best curry recipe I've ever tried at home. Even my 7 year old loved it (grated, she likes spicy dishes as much as me, but still).
