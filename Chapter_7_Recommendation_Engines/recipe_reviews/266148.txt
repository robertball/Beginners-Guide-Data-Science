At first I was concerned about cold zucchini. I let them soak for a day and a half.. Oh these are good! The deep flavor of the balsamic vinegar with Italian spices is broken up by the flavor of the feta. I will salt and  pepper before browning next time. Thinly sliced gives the best presentation for these easy appetizers.

I really didn't like this recipe - I found the flavour mix didn't work.  I won't make it again - it's more labour intensive than it deserves.
